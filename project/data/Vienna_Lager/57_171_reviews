"Very thin, basically a Vienna/Dark lager, very light malts, drinkable but just far too thin in body."
"Harsh after taste.. Enjoyed this beer for many years... Than I got into craft.. No longer what I'm looking for"

"Disappointing in almost every way. This is not a bad beer, but it's not nearly good enough to justify the price. I'd rather drink Miller Lite."
"Nothing special, would rather drink a corona with a lime"
""
"Decent Mexican amber lager. It is labeled as a Vienna style lager, but it seems like a premium adjunct lager, IMO. However, it is refreshing alongside Ensenada style fish tacos."
"Pretty good drinking beer, but didnt have much flavor. Kinda tasted like filtered water with a pinch of alcohol mixed in"

"(Draft, revisited) at Canyon Club in Agoura Hills. Wheaty and plain but refreshing; 3/8/15."
""
""
"Lite gold pour with white head. Bready notes and flavor. Lite mouthfeel. A crisp and refreshing lager."

""
"Good amber. Not great but I'd get again."
"It was drinkable, do not see myself buying again."
""
""
"serve cold with mexican food... delishous"
""
"Nice, refreshing beer that goes down smooth."
""
"Best when really icy cold, very drinkable with spicy food, chili relanno's...this beer brings down the heat, clean finish, good with lime wedge, this beer is much better in draft form than in a bottle every time I have drank it"
""
""
"Aroma has a bit of nutiness, flavor is very malt forward but tastes a bit stale and has cardboard flavor. Hints of nuts make it tolerable."
"One of my favorite mexican beers that I can get right at the local mini market. If I can´t find Bohemia I get some Amber Lagers."

"Good summertime beer. Light and easy to go down."
""
"Dark amber pour with excellent character & drinkability."
""
""
"Better then any other beer south of the border."
""
""
"Why is so heavenly good on draft with a lime and some chips and salsa?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice refreshing lager. Nothing special but great at a Mexican restaurant."
""
"Pretty standard weak Mexican lager you wouldn't drink it a second time"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is okay on draft with a lime. Much better than Corona in my opinion."

"For a Mexican beer its not bad. Thin... mighty thin..."

""
"The best in my opinion in the line up of Dos Equis"
"Tastes a bit like water with bread in it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can't complain too much. A decent mass-produced beer at a reasonable price, and there are far worse lagers on the Australian market than this. Nothing special and it's a bit bland like most beers for the mass-market, but quite drinkable."

"Dos Equis Amber is best on tap, with a lime on the edge of the glass.  The beer is not great, but it definitely passes the time with some good old Tex Mex.  The color is a deep copper, with a golden hue in the right kind of light.  The head is rather small, about a finger's width, and it lingers.  Its aroma is of corn, not overly strong.  It tastes of grain, a bit watery actually.  It has a dry after effect.  Not bad.  Not good either, but overall, this is a beer you can have with dinner, and it won't ruin your evening at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  This is not a terrible beer.  It is not a great one either, but in a pinch, this will do."

"Reddish orange in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a short off-white foam that quickly reduced to thin wisps. Buttery, toasted malt and burnt caramel aromas with hints of herbal hops. Medium bodied with a slightly watery feel up front that transitions to light, tangy, crispness through the middle to the end. Burnt caramel malt and light toasted malt flavors with herbal hops through the middle and clean finish. Flavors are generally subdued with dominant burnt caramel character."

"Overall (3.96) : I'm a chatterbox tonight. Sorry for the long review. This is one of my top ambers now. Next time I see it for a good price I'll pick up a six or twelve. I was not expecting this as I typically don't like mexican style beers. But this one somehow rises above. Lovely yeasty bread dough with a slight sour malt character. Bravo (in every sense of the word)!"

"Overly sweet Vienna Lager, not that bad, but I will pass next time."

"Overall, this was a beer had in desperation.  We had flown into Boston on an evening flight for a friend’s wedding.  After the hour long drive to Worcester we found ourselves with a hankering for some sauce at about 11pm.  It was a Friday and the beginning of a wedding weekend.  Highly understandable.  We drove around Worcester for an hour looking in every Walgreens, CVS, and sketchy corner store we could find, looking for a pack of local beverages to bring back to the hotel and relax with.  Alas, to our surprise, we found no such thing.  Frustrated and defeated we turned back towards the hotel, and were happy to find an alcohol-slinging establishment a mere half mile from our temporary abode.  This was the only beer available, aside from Pacifico, so we really just flipped a coin here.  The “amber lager” is a standard Mexican adjunct lager, giving cheap grain through the nose and mouth, with little to rest upon for feel or sustenance.  We drank the swill quickly, and it served its purpose, but after this we rapidly moved on to sampling the beverages for which this cantina was named."

"This beer was okay. I enjoyed the barley that was in it, and I enjoyed the malt of this beer. I liked the hops that this beer has as well. Ir was not too heavy at all. And for a fairly cheap beer it was a decent beer. I have only had this beer in a bottle, I would like to try it on tap and see wich one taste better."

"O - A below average lager. Tastes very underwhelming, as expected from macro. Its watery and metallic, and the standard lager characteristics are so downplayed. I find this drinkable because well it is easily drinkable with its underwhelming tastes, but nothing really here to note."

"One of my favorite lagers and much better than the special lager. Goes down easy and has a rich taste and feel to it. Very refreshing. Has the dark brown color I expect from a lager and isn't anything fancy or expensive."
""
""
""
""
"It's a decent amber lager that is much better on tap then out of the bottle. You can expect a slight metallic taste when drinking any bottled beer but it is even more so prevolent in this Mexican favorite, it completely takes away from the true flavor that Dos Equis has to offer."

""
""
""
"Overall: This is one of those beers where I just don't understand the appeal. It's not bad in the way bad beers are bad - meaning it's not funky or full of adjuncts or super watered-down. But it's also thoroughly eclipsed by so many other options (Sam Adams flagship is the same style, probably around the same price point and is so much better than this). I don't always drink beer, but when I do, prefer it to taste like something."

"Doc Equis Amber Lager is my favorite ""anytime"" beer. I buy this anytime I spend more that a minute staring into a beer cooler. It's a safe bet that I'll enjoy it and the beer will complement whatever I'm eating. It's much better in flavor than Sam Adams (in my opinion), less expensive, and more pleasant to drink. I think it's quite flavorful and has a pleasant ""finish"" that sort of wafts around my palate. Gracias!"

"O-one of the best lagers I've ever had in my extremely limited tasting experience. Other lagers I've had didn't have the flavor this one did"
""

"O: Seems kind of like a hybrid of a Vienna Lager and an American Adjunct Lager, certainly not one of my favorite brews but not horrible. Easy to drink and pairs well with spicy foods."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I would actually prefer their lager because it is even less bold in flavor, bad flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is actually a decent beer, very flavorful and refreshing, worlds better than the basic Dos Equis lager. I frequently have this (or Negra Modelo) at Mexican or Tex-Mex restaurants."

"So when you are eating a wonderful Mexican breakfast, avoid the pale ales, stouts, and IPAs and get a XX Amber lager... ...well before noon. Yes, I don't always drink beer before noon, but when I do....its a XX Amber."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a schooner glass. It has a nice light amber hue with a very small white head that dissipates quickly. It has a very faint sweet smell. It has a light malty taste with a good sweetness to it. It has a smooth mouth feel with a lightly dry finish.  Overall it is an ok beer."

"Although a somewhat average beer, I find the Dos Equis Amber Lager to be a very refreshing and smooth beer. It has a good amount of taste and is not as watery as many beers of similar pricing. I find this beer to be the best of the beers that one can get a pint of for $3-4. Though it won't overwhelm you with complicated tastes and smells, it will refresh you and satisfy you. Goes well with a lime garnish and makes a hot summer day that much more pleasant."

"Pours a clear amber with about a 1/2-finger off white head that settles down to just along the sides of the top of the brew and sides. Some very spotty lacing is seen.. Very light aroma of malts and caramel. The taste is the same with more malts coming through. A little 'watered-down' but decent. Overall smooth to drink with just a little bitterness for the finish. Overall, a decent brew."

"O - This is an overall refreshing Mexican beer. Good with spicy food and good after cutting the grass if it happens to be around. I'll never turn one down."
"O - Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. I'm more of an ale drinker myself, so when I go to Mexican restaurants, I'm always slightly depressed when I can't order a good IPA to go with my meal. This one definitely lifted my spirits, and will probably be my new favorite when it comes to Latina brews."

"It is what it is. Decent when paired with food, but not great on its own. I don't always drink beer, but when I do, it's probably not going to be Dos Equis."
""
""
""
"O: This is decent for what it is. When you're at a Mexican restaurant eating spicy food, you could do far worse than to order this beer. I think it would do better with food than when drank on its own, as I'm doing now."

"Great Session beer. Very smooth with a really good taste. Could drink like 7 of these in 1 session. very easy to drink beer and very tasty. Overall pretty good beer and I really enjoyed it. Bottle is better then Draft. I was very impressed about how great it went down and like it a great deal more than the regular Dos Equis"

"Straw colored; pours out into a white frothy head that quickly dissipates into minimal lacing. Slight malty smell with hints of bubble gum and salt water taffy. A little malty in the front with a slight hop finish. Light to medium body. I like to drink this with Mexican cuisine; barely touch this otherwise."

"The beer is clear and amber with a small white head. Weak aroma. What's there is adjuncts, grain, lager type scents. Pretty clean flavor initially with a bit of corn and grain harshness in the finish. When paired with saucy and spicy food, this flaw is disguised to some degree. A tad sweet with some fruity malt. OK."

"Had a few bottles of this watching football at a friends this weekend. Its an easy drinker, slightly sweeter than I'd like, but its got more taste in the malty range than the domestic ""chuggers"". Decent aftertaste too. When in the land of Mexican macro-brews, this is my go-to. I've not had it with a lime that I can recall, but that might give it a nice acidic balance. ( I prefer Negro Modelo to be served with one. ) Also, I agree with others that this is best when Ice cold. Gets skunky when it warms."

"""Dos Equis was crafted in Mexico in 1897 by a German brew master, who deluded his brewing heritage with the spirit of Mexican traditions. Originally called Siglo XX to celebrate the arrival of the 20th century it later became known as just Dos Equis (or simple, two Xs in Spanish.) Dos Equis Amber is a full flavored, yet surprisingly smooth amber-colored lager from Mexio that is easy to drink with a clean finish."""

"Pours a dark ruby brown with about 1cm of creamy head that fades away some but hangs onto the glass around the edges. Smells yeasty, mildly fruity and a little spicy. Tastes very mild, very watery. No hop flavor or bitterness to speak of. Mouthfeel is creamy and a little fizzy, not too bad, but not too good, either. Overall, it's fairly bland. I guess I should have expected that from a macro."
""
""
""

"Pours a ruddy copper body, with a slight, short lasting, head. Head disolves into a thin film with slightly spotty lacing. Unusual aroma, which I realy couldn't identify, but my wife describes as ""feet""! The surprise is in the taste; it's crisp and slightly sweet at first , barest hint of hops. Aftertaste is a tad sour. Loses flavor and appeal as it warms."

"Would not drink again. Certainly wasn't a well crafted beer. Reminded me of some dry beers. I see why a lot of Mexican beers are served with limes in them, because this flavorless, dry beer, needed something to add a little life to it."
""
""
""
""
"O - I didn't have much for expectations, so I can't say I was overly disappointed. A touch more flavorful than their lager, but certainly nothing memorable here."
""
""
""
"Overall, this beer seems to get progressively worse as the years wear on. I remember I used to love this one, now ... not so much. It tastes like metal and wet cardboard. Maybe I need to drink it from the bottle, with a lime. Dunno."

"On tap in a mug. Pours deep copper color with fizzy head that dissipates quickly. The nose is unimpressive, some whole grain bread and caramel. The taste is slightly metallic with caramel sweetness and the palate is pure water. I drink this with Mexican food, overall just average."
""
""
""
""
""
"Straight out of a "" Beers of Mexico pack "". Smelled as most Amber Lagers do, Can't speak for a appearance since it was in a bottle. This beer is quite tasty, With the taste outperforming the original Dos Equis. Mouthfeel was pretty great, Though you could taste the alcohol. But it must be had ice cold for it to be as good as mine was, My buddy had one that was piss warm and it tasted like horrid Jose Cuervo"

"Pours a clear light amber with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, slight caramel, and some metallic aromas. Taste is pretty much the same. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer but at least it’s pretty drinkable for what it is."

"supposedly one of the better mexican exports, but i did not care for this. smells like an adjunct lager with a touch of sweeter malt, kind of off-putting in an extracty way. flavor is the same, very corn lagery, artificially sweet. feel is really weird for a beer, expansive like a shaken up soda, overly bubbly, and funny in the stomach. body is less than medium and its actually really drinkable, aside from the way it made me feel. i think its also much less refresing than the regular dos equis lager, which i dont mind too much. this one is all up a pretty nasty beer, but still preferable to corona by a long shot."
""
""
""

"Overall I picked this one over the regular lager since it had a brown bottle. And damn it if they are right I got a non skunked beer! If only it was cheaper I would have it as a regular in my fridge."

"O-as far as the mini tour goes this was probably the best of the bunch but when they have to slice a lime for every one of the beers on the tour its not good especially when they ruin the only decent one with a lime, which is why I don't usually review my Old Chicago beers but this Cinco tour was just not that good"
"Amber body with a short off white head. Smell is faintly malty, toast, Caramel. Taste similarly has toasted elements, malt, mild sweetness and enough floral hop to keep the palate clean. Mouthfeel medium-light with good carbonation. One of the better Mexican mass beers."

"Thin bodied on the palate (I guess is the rule for mexican beers?) and light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is the best Dos Equis that I have tried so far. I like the golden amber body of the beer. The crisp clean taste, not chemical after taste. The grains come through in the flavor. It is one that is an enjoyable drink with a meal or just while watching TV. I will be enjoying this beer during my off time this summer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Light copper color with a good head. It’s hard to judge a lace as it was served quite cold. Not much of an aroma, but at least not offensive. A nice hops taste when compared to other mexican beers of this style. Light taste, but indicative of style. I would order this over Corona any day."

"Pours a clear amber color with no head or lace. It's aroma is caramel and bread crust. The flavor is sweet malt with no hop bite and a hint of caramel, bland. The mouthfeel is thin. Dos Equis Amber Lager is just a regular beer, nothing special, not recommended."

"Lightly creamy in flavor with a decent fine carbonation. Bit of caramel sweetness and finishing with a hint of drying bitterness. Slightly nutty after some agitation but otherwise a bit thin in the end. Clean yet subtle across the board, a good warm weather brew and more of a Dunkel given the malt structure."

"Poured this Vienna Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This brew poured a light brown to copper color and produced a off white head, decent retention and nice lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this brew consists of toasted malt and some trace amount of hops. Light in body, this brew has the taste of sweet toasted grain, semi- dry feel, some earthy hop bitterness. One of my favorite ""Mexican Lager's"" sure beats the heck out of Corona. Prost!"
""
""
"The taste had hints of caramel and roasted malt with a slightly grassy hop flavor. Not bad but not spectacular either. One of the better mexican beers but that's not saying much. Usually my go-to with mexican food."

""
""
"Overall: Again just an awful example of what a beer could be"

"I have also had a bottle of this served ice cold; this mutes the flavours and produces a very lame, C-grade Vienna lager. This is one that definitely benefits from ten minutes on the counter before being poured. Regardless of the serving temperature though, you can be assured that this is a much tastier beer than the majority of its Mexican lager counterparts. This is often the optimal choice at Mexican restaurants, and it's a respectable session beer if nothing else. I would not be opposed to drinking this again, but it's not something I'd ever get regularly."
"O- A decent brew. Certainly better than the adjunct/macro lagers out there. I would certainly choose this over corona. It has the look of an amber ale to it."
"Taste is equally as inoffensive, slightly malty with very little hops, Mouthfeel and a dry finish. Good on a hot day and refreshing with Mexican food but that's the range of this beer."
"O: I’ve had this beer every time I go to a Mexican restaurant but this is the first time I’ve actually taken the time to review it. It is a decent Mexican beer – but nothing great."
"Finish-A little bit of chocolate, spice and hops. This beer is not good at all, especially for the price, though not bad. It doesn’t really seem to have a place, body of a summer beer, taste that doesn’t match, overall it’s lasting qualities in the glass are poor as well"
"overall = This beer is ok."
"Well, I certainly prefer this to the Special Lager. I think this has a bit more character and the sweet malts do accompany the food quite well. On it's own, it's not the worst beer in the world to drink; however, I probably will only consume these at Mexican restaurants. It just puts me in the mood."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"Overall, this is a pretty good brew, always my choice at the mexican restaurants and much better than any of the other mass produced beers out there."
"I had a bad experience before- last time I had it it was served with a lime in it and it was terrible. Keep your damn limes out of vienna lagers, please and thank you."
"Well, the color is nice, a medium amber. Smell is OK, just a beery whiff. Faint taste of caramel? No, that's imagination from the color. Bitterness is the soapy dishwater style. I didn't realize this stuff was so bad. It's just a flat, dull flavor with an unpleasant cardboard sort of taste. Faintly woody. Not crisp enough for a decent gulp."
"O: This was really gross tasting. If this is supposed to be the same style as Boston Lager then the differences are night and day."
"this beer is not bad. The colorisa very nice rich brown- crystal clear. The smell is nothing special, about average. The taste is better than a usual lager, more malty. There is a nice flavor here, nothing exceptional, just slightly above average. I think this beer is pretty sollid, I like it better on draft with some nachos on the side- that's how I usually take it."
"Not sure if this story amounts to a compliment or an insult, but it is all true."
"Had a 12 oz bottle of Dos Equis Amber with my dinner at home tonight. It is a good overall beer that goes almost with anything but is especially suited for Mexican food. I think Dos Equis Amber is the best of the ""Mexican Beers"". It is better on tap and the only Mexican beer that does not require a lime to ""enhance"" the taste. Like the commercial says:"" I don't often drink (Mexican) beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis"""
"O: Nice, easy drinking lager that pairs well with Mexican food. Not anything outstanding but nothing offensive either."
"A nice enjoyable brew..."
"Overall: This is a nice amber. Nothing special but very drinkable."
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer. I'd consider this over other generic lagers on a hot day."
"O - A pretty solid beer, the most interesting man in the world should advertise their amber instead of their lager."
"At least as much in common with an American adjunct lager as a true Vienna lager which is a shame - but one of the better big-name pasteurized beers available."
"Overall, this is not a bad beer when you consider the Mexican beer market, but if I'm to compare it to other Vienna Lagers this beer is mediocre at best."
"Poured a dark, caramel-amber color. Smelled of malts, grains and hops. The taste was sweet and heavily dominated by a malt and caramel flavor; very light on the tongue and not much complexity. Finishes crisp and slightly bitter but has a nice aftertaste. Not bad, but not outstanding either."
"Vienna Lagers should offer more than this, but so few are available on the market this is one of the few examples most people have had. That's a shame. This may be on of the better Mexican beer available, but that sets the bar pretty low."
"O – Surprised by this beer. It was better then I thought though I may be effected by the atmosphere around. Solid and much better then BMC’s. Well worth a try."
"I have to cop to being impressed by the finger-and-a-half of thick deep-tan head with decent retention off of my pour. Color was a gorgeous coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had a caramel sweetness, very nice and very unexpected. Mouthfeel was medium with a mildly malty sweetness on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry and quite drinkable, plus the lacing it left behind was also notable. Now, I am doubly interested in trying it from a CAN. This was good, not great, but still ..."
"overall, this beer strikes me as a step between budlight and bud. i have alot of respect for this style, but justice is not done here."
"M./O. Mouthfeel is crisp, clean and smooth with a slightly creamy taste. Overall, a decent beer that goes nicely with mexican food and is much tastier on tap than in the bottle."
"Overall: For this category you could do a lot worse. I would certainly pick this over many of the other mass-produced beers that are similar in style."
"D: overall, not the best or worst vienna ive ever had. just wish there was slightly more noble hop presence."
"T - Not sure what this beer is trying to be, as it wouldn't quench a thirst."
"an enjoyable mexican brew with a bit more flavor than a lot of what is out there."
"The taste is mostly a combination of the above. A light bodied mass production type beer. It was very drinkable and would serve the purpose in hot climates."
"O: not a bad pairing with Mexican food, the beer serves it's purpose, but it lacks a bit in the flavor department"
"Looks like a typical vienna malt except for no head at all. Coppery colored and translucent. Smell, however, is terribly thin compared to many other similar offerings. Sure, its refreshing with your food, but that's because there seems to be so much water in there. Taste is similarly bland and watered down. It does have one thing in its favor, and that is the lack of typical adjunct lager off flavors which I understand to be common for Mexican beers. I can't really detect any flavorful chords of any significance, however. Easily forgettable, but not terrible or disgusting to taste."
"This beer pours out as a relatively decent amber color with not a lot of head or lacing. The smell is rather generic, its grainy and mostly a nose full of malts. The taste has some hop bitterness to it but nothing too special. The mouthfeel is a little watery to me. Overall I won't need to have this one again I don't think."
"Overall: It's been a while since I last had a Dos Equis and I'm afraid my tastes have just changed. Either that or this beer is trying too hard not to offend anyone's sensibilities."
"D - Simple lager but not much else. Don't really care for it."
"This is my favorite beer from south of the border."
"Overall: If you want a beer to wash down those enchiladas and tastes better than Corona, go for this. If you're looking for a genuine-tasting Vienna lager, stay far, far away. Not bad for what it is, but probably not worth pursuing outside of this kind of context."
"In comparison to its Grupo Modelo counterparts, this Cervecería Moctezuma Vienna-style offering is much more acceptable and closer to the mark of an authentic European amber lager. It's also a far more drinkable beer, in my opinion, than the standard Dos Equis Lager. It's still no substitute for the German or American examples, but it at least provides a little actual diversity and quality to the otherwise shoddy Mexican portfolio."
"Not the most flavorful beer around, but smooth and easy to drink. Good to chug down on a hot day or when eating spicy Mexican food. If you’re going to try it, get a 6 pack when it's 30C out and enjoy."
"Overall / Drinkability: Well, with Mexican food this beer does quite well from what I remember in the past the many times I've had it. It does a great job quenching spicy heat without drowning the flavor. By itself though after mowing the yard...I'm not as enthusiastic about it. I fear I let General Zaragoza down with this one. I'll have to try something better next year."
"Will not have again."
"O - By no means is this a go to beer of mine, but a quality choice. Much better than the reputation it usually gets IMHO."
"Stay thirsty my friends."
"At my watering hole (again) for the mini tour. A bit of a red/amber color with no aroma (again) and very little head. Taste was actually not too bad: the sweet malt that seems so prevalant in Mexican brews is more laid back. I won't go out of my way to buy this but at a Mexican resturaunt with little/no choice, I'd do this one, especially on tap."
"This is just my personal opinion but this beer isn't that good. Although darker than it's lager counterpart, it pales in comparison (ha ha). Not the great-tasting highly carbonated beer from Mexico I've come to enjoy (Green Bottle Dos Equis). This one is a whole other animal and the taste is pretty awful. It tastes like it has more alcohol than it does, which bothers me on this one."
"D: Medium light mouthfeel and smooth."
"Pours a dark amber color with a short lived head of foam. Has a rather weak scent that makes it really hard to pick anything out. For the taste you can pick out some wheat and malts but that's about it. Very simple taste and nothing special here but it's probably of the better mainstream Mexican beers."
"The beer is served on tap in a giant mug. Hazy and lots of bubbles, it is an amber color with a thick, frothy, offwhite head. Toasted oats and semisweet caramel smells. The beer is a decent tasting lager, and is my go to beer at Mexican joints. Toasty and light flavors on a sharp, crisp body. Very easy to drink, and does not interfere with your food no matter what you are eating. Decent beer for what it is."
"O: A better beer than I expected and while I would not buy a sixer of it and bring it home, I would buy it if out if limited to Mexican beers."
"Drink - Probably one of the better beers available from Mexico. It's not offensive and it's highly drinkable. I wouldn't purchase it again but I wouldn't turn one away if offered."
"OVerall: See drinkability. Decent with Chipotle though."
"O: I really enjoy this style, and Dos Equis Amber is an honest effort from a macro. Not in the same conversation as a Sam Adams, but this is probably among the best choices at your local Mexican restaurant."
"Interesting style, but not the best lager ever. The biggest fault is the weak flavour; it's watery and lacks depth. I imagine that there are better examples out there. Drinkable if you don't want your tastebuds challenged in any way."
"This one reminds me of a cheap Newcastle. Definitely watered down compared to it, but sort of your average non-light beer. Probably would not order this one again as I am not a fan of Dos Equis."
"D- very drinkable, buy one and try it for your self!"
"D - This is a fairly drinkable beer. A lot of Mexican restaurants don't give you much choice of beer, and I prefer this over most of the others. That said, I'm not a big fan. I'll buy it again in a restaurant, if there's nothing better to choose from, but I won't be keeping it in the fridge."
"The body was a bit thin very the style but still decent. Drinkability was good, but this beer isn't anything special, so why bother? Try it or don't, it doesn't really matter."
"Poured a pretty sexy one-finger off-white head. Unlike the original Dos Equis, the one has a good smell to it. Moderate banana bread character. Had to stick my nose close in there to smell it though. Hints of toffee. Taste is a bit like coffee, maybe a little bit of herb or dark tea. Mouthfeel is a bit spicey and goes down smooth."
"The aroma is watery and slightly like caramel and paper. The appearance is light amber with a small head. The taste is slightly sweet with a chemical bitterness that is horrible. The palate is average. The beer is not good overall and I think it's a drain pour."
"Try it wiht Enchiladas, or fajitas."
"Drinks about average but maybe slightly above."
"Final Thoughts: All it all, probably one of the better Mexican beers out there and worlds better then their Lager. This was interesting, and I was happy to drink it, and would gladly have it again. As a side note, I can also see this being a beer you could sell your non-BA buddies on too."
"D - Good. However, there is nothing that differentiate this beer from others of the style."
"Solid amber colour, so-so foam up that vanished..no effervecence. Smell is pretty harsh whn cold - nasty corn and crap hops, but when it warms it...well...I guess it doesn't get any better really...still sweet. Taste is ok with some tasty weak malts that come across sort of dry, but the corn, alcohol and whatever else kills any real enjoyment here. The brew comes across a bit watery, fizzy and with some noticable alcohol (weak) - realistically it feels lilke I have foam in my mouth. Empty finish."
"Final thoughL Vienna lager? Not quite. Color is the only thing this beer has in common with a vienna lager. Not hoppy enough, not crisp enough."
"D- A solid beer, I could session this with no problems and I can find no faults in the beer. I am kinda impressed as I was expecting something horrible."
"If it didn't look so pretty in a glass I wouldn't of even tried."
"D - Drinks ok for a mexican beer, But I prefer corona over this. Not the best amber if you ask me."
"D - Good to drink, easy and satisfying"
"Once again I find myself having stayed thirsty throughout the better part of the day. After summitting my second mountain in as many days (photographing a very rare predatory mountain goat), I arrived at the Buddhist temple in search of enlightenment. Instead they handed me this fine, chilled bottle of Mexican lager and a fine tumbler. My thirst was modest and started becoming quenched with the fine tawny juice. A very nice balance of noble hop and toasted malt, slight metallic flavor and finishing a tad sweet. Overall, it was a delight. A finely crafted large production entity."
"It's a dark colored lager. Smells of freshly yeasted sour dough. The taste is very mild and non-descript. It has a slightly sour bite, but not very much flavor. It is watery and unoffensive....just something neutral to drink while you are having dinner or doing whatever you like to do."
"It strikes a nice balance in my belly with some fresh tortilla chips and salsa fresca."
"Had this beer at home in a bottle. It wasn't terrible. However, it wasn't great. For me it was just an average beer. For it's style it was a bit better than what i have had. Drinkability is good. You could do worse. I could drink a 6 pack on a warm summer day and be content..."
"I would be disappointed if this had been an American amber beer. Nothing out of the ordinary, part of a variety pack of 3 different Dos Equis beers. Sad to say, it just does not live up to the mystique of Mexico. Go with an amber American beer, you will be more satisfied."
"Pours a pale amber colour with almost head. No lacing either. Small amount of caramel, some grains, but mostly not too much in the smell. Flavour is equally bland. I wouldn't trash this beer because it doesn't taste bad, it just needs more flavour."
"Drinkability - This brew, while not bad, left a little to be disired in all categories. This could be a beer to drink when not desiring anything complicated. Nothing distracting about it and it's easily drinkable."
"Drinkability is pretty good for a lager seeing as I don't enjoy the style. I had 3, but had trouble getting the last 2 down, just a lack of REAL flavor. Only reason I even had these is I was receiving free beer for finishing the race."
"12 oz bottle at Boiling Pot in Rockport, TX. Pours amber hue with a small, white head. Aroma is of sweet caramel malt. Light to medium body, medium carbonation. Unpleasant, metallic taste made me regret trying this beer. I would not try this beer again."
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Color is a modest copper-brown with a slight head. The nose brings forward a bit of light bread and some very mild and earthy hops. The taste combines a bit of earth and a touch of toast fairly well, at least given who the producer is. Decent body and carbonation; this isn't half bad."
"drinkability; very drinkable because it's delicious, well done indeed!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: Goes down quite easily, and works well on a hot day."
"Overall this goes down very easy and is a worthy go to brew when ordering Mexican food in a restaurant."
"Drinkability: This is reasonably drinkable and while not a beer I'd go out of my way for it is certainly one I'd drink again."
" Strictly a session beer that is more costly than is should be. Really feel like it is on par with most ""beer commercial"" offerings in taste. I wouldn't buy this again unless I was going to a party and it was cheaper than Budlight."
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a thick white head and a little lacing. Smells of vanilla and roasted/toasted/burnt barley with some broccoli in there. Tastes of vanilla and roasted somewhat burnt materials. Not a fan. Maybe spoiled. Mouthfeel is thin and weak. Drinkability is decent."
"Overall its nothing special, but its not a bad beer in my book."
"When in a Mexican restaurant, drink as the Mexicans might. Enter Dos Equis. It pours a clear sunset amber topped by about a finger or so of white foam. The nose comprises light burnt wheat, very light roasted malts, caramel, and flowers. The taste follows pretty closely, with the roast toned down even further. A light bit of toasted biscuit comes in, but dies away just as quickly. The body is a heavy-ish light, with a moderate carbonation and a finish that really seems to wanna be dry. Overall, nothing special going on here, but enough drinkability to go with my tasty enchiladas."
"D: Not a big fan of this at all. Can't say I will grab this again unless there's nothing else better to drink."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, but refreshing. Easy drinking, if you don't expect much its a nice option, especially when in Mexico."
"A go to beer at most Mexican restaurants that only stock Corona, Modelo Especial, and other piss-tasting swill. It has no real flaws other than it's lack of character."
"RJT"
"I didn't enjoy this brew much. It poured an amber color with a decent cap of foam. The aroma is grainy malt with a dash of hops. Nothing to exciting here, but decent enough. The fermented grain on the palate has an off flavor to it. A little tinny, perhaps. As the brew progressed this almost skunk like flavor strengthened. The bite of bitterness at the end was welcome to balance the malts."
"Well it is not the best beer I have ever had, but I have to say it is one of the most refreshing. It goes very well with food. One of my beers of choice at a BBQ. It has a great amber color, a good amount of carbonation, crisp taste, and is great for those long summer days."
"A dark tea amber, rating a 21 on the SRM chart. Clear with micro bubble action. The head was heavy soap bubble in texture, with light yellow bubbles. The head dissipated to a heavy lace ring that has little clinging power. Roasted wheat and corn, with a little sweet malt in the aroma. Rich grain and malt flavor with a hint of bitterness. The flavor is robust and crisp, with a good balance of sweetness and tart. Plays well with my tongue and palate, nice tingle and aftertaste. This is a good choice of brew with steak and cheese. A good party pleaser, although the price is a little high, I would spring for this for my discriminating guests."
"D - not bad for what it is. I don't always drink Dos Equis, but when I do, I could do worse."
"D- It's lightweight so a good drinker. I won't drink it again unless it's with mexican food, but interesting beer and an odd take on a vienna lager."
"Pours a orangy amber color, moderate offwhite head with some retention but little lacing. Scent is a light blend of light carmle candied, brown sugar with a touch of bread and grass. Taste is suprisingly decent... nice light malt sweetness with touches of bread and grass... not the freshest tasting, but the sweetness covers that up. Lighter side of medium bodied, decent carbonation. A nice suprise of a beer."
"D: Decent beer with some mexican food."
"Note: started to notice a little bit of a corn flavor in the flavor. Nothing too much."
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass, nice orangish red hue, not too dark. With a slightly tan head of about one finger that doesn't last very long, nor leave much lacing. Smell has the grassiness expected with a typical lager but not much else, very non-descript. Taste is similar with some slight maltiness, but nothing to really distinguish it from others of the same style. Feel is really pretty good, with some light, tight carbonation and a generally smooth finish. Overall it is not terrible, but really indistinguishable from others, I will drink it if it is the only option but will probably not search it out."
"Crystal clear medium amber with a thin white cap and collar. Short lived, streaky lace and decent head retention. Malty aroma, essentially no discernible hops but they seem to be there in the background. Toasted, slight fruitiness, brown sugar. Low bitterness, sugary, toasty, with a faint dark kilned and dry maltiness. Quick finish, slight fruitiness that keeps it from finishing really clean. Medium to light bodied with slightly creamy carbonation, dry. Not bad at all. It works for a Vienna lager and is quite drinkable."
"D: This is a nice and drinkable brew, a light body gives for a easy drink. Although the flavors are not what is calling me back to the glass, the overall refreshing taste wins it over. Great Mexican beer."
"Poured a deep amber into a pint glass with a small white head, served with a lime. Malty taste, yet not sweet like a Bock. Some light hops and grain flavours came through. Very refreshing beer."
"and sweeter, more of a carona, but better even though it's not nearly as tasty as this beer."
"Have got to admit, after drinking two 40 oz. mugs of this every Saturday at the Mexican restuarnt for the past 15 years I guess I would have to say I have a good relationship with this brew! Better than the average American swill(BMC) this stuff actually tastes pretty decent and goes down real clean. So.... If yer out gettin some enchaladas and such don't be afraid to check this one out, Stay Thirsty My Friends!"
"A watery ""dark beer""."
"Rusty in colour with not much head. Light malt sweetness on the nose with some caramel and chestnut. No freshness date, I'd say it's about 9 months on. Good carbonation, a touch of sweetness in the finish but mostly dry. Mild bitterness mostly malt driven. Not bad. A good consistent finish. Wouldn't go out of my way for it but wouldn't avoid it either."
"A formidable entry to Mexico's lineup of macro-micros, Dos Equis Amber, like most other of its genre, gets by on its exceptional drinkability. It's almost as if Mexico's beers were crafted solely with the thought of guzzling them under the hot Mexcian sun - don't try drinking these in the cold and dark of winter. Slightly skunky, even with brown glass (though far less-disarmingly so that Corona), this is a beer to be be enjoyed one after another, in the hot, hot heat..."
"D - Mildly drinkable and refreshing... Not bad, but far from memorable... A viable alternative to craft beer when in a tough spot, but nothing I would recommend..."
"D- This is just a so so beer for me. A good pairing with mexican food, but compared to other vienna lagers, this one falls a bit short."
"NOTES: Had this on tap over the weekend (8/6/2011) and it was very creamy and smooth, making it a great session beer when it's flowing like that."
"Brown 12oz bottle $7.29 a 6 pack."
"Taste reflects the nose. Nothing great, but very sessionable."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a translucent copper with a one inch, loose, bubbly, cream-colored head. Head eventually dissipates into a broken skim; some spots and strands of lacing revealed during the session - decent adhesion. Not much happening in the nose - some light malts maybe a nutty quality. Taste consistent with nose - not much complexity, a little watery and maybe a hint of acidity and a little residual sweetness. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with a pleasant, lively carbonation and a fairly clean finish. Not a a bad brew. Drinks easy and pairs well with Mexican."
"Overall its strongest point is probably its ability to quench a mouthful of flames after too big a bite of jalapeno. Not much of a stand alone beer."
"this is a decent beer but really there is not much to it.. I would put this in the neutral beer category.. this is something that is only sessionable and not really enjoyable as a center piece.. everything about this beer is typical - grainy, very slight malty sweetness, mainly just carbonated beer flavor.. I would not highly recommend this unless it is a hot day and nothing else is available."
"Mouthfeel is a little watery and tingly. It drinks good, just doesn't have much flavor."
"D: This is a decent beer on its own without any fruit wedge needed. Goes best with Mexican dishes"
"The mouthfeel is decent. It is quite drinkable. My wife loves it, but I can't say that I will be drinking it again real soon."
"In general, not worth it."
"I have spent many nights ordering nothing but Dos Equis Amber. The lager is good too, but the amber is the real good stuff."
"Probably my favorite of the widely available Mexican beers, but it's still nothing TOO special."
"I'm not generally fond of Mexican beer, but this was ok. I wouldn't pay for another, but would drink it if given to me."
"A friend told me about this beer, and I finally tried it at a local Mexican restaruant. I don't usually like dark beers but this is quite good. The first two I had were drafts, and they were refreshing after a long day. If you've read my reviews prior I hate alot of carbonation and like a smooth beer, without the fiz. This beer is just about right, very drinkable and without the fiz."
"Mouthfeel was fairly light & well carbonated. It was easy to go through a pitcher of this. Decent Mexican beer."
"Side note: I love the Dos Equis ads with the Most Interesting Man in the World, but they did not contribute to my purchase of this beer. Fantastic advertising, though."
"Arguably the best Mexican macro out there. Highly recommended, as we turn the corner into summer."
"The body of the beer is medium and the finish is lightly medium. This beer is lacking a lot of characters of a Vienna Lager. It is easy to drink because there is not a lot of flavor but it isn't nasty."
"I would assume this is a beer that the locals don't drink south of a couple boarders from here"
"Served to me in a pint glass with a small head that dissapated quickly. Color is amber with a dark undertone. Smells a bit bready with a sweet caramel hint. Taste is better than anticipated. Very smooth malt flavor that works very well. Sweet caramel flavor that hits the spot without being too unbalanced. Hop profile is low, as it should be. Easy drinking, flavorful beer that falls short of Boston Lager but is easily the best Mexican macro I've had to date."
"Stay thirsty, my friends."
"Really good beer for drinking if you want something with mexican food. I am a huge proponent of drinking beers that match your food, and if I could have a bunch of these, a margarita or two, and some chips and salsa, I would be one happy SOB. It's very smooth, and it's actually smoother than their lager especial which surprised me. This is my favorite Dos Equis, but I do wish that it's ABV was up there with the Lager Especial, which actually tastes like a lighter beer. Go figure. Drink and be merry."
"Well, yeah, the lack of fizz did kill the thrill that might've been had drinking this. It's not all that bad for what it is: a stagnant, leather-brown, wanna-be Vienna lager, malty malt beverage. In all seriousness, a little CO2 could be all it needs to be worthy. Really, it wasn't tasteless by any stretch, just thick and caramelly in the mouth, but that's about it. More than 2 or 3 in a row and you might find yourself wanting to lay down and rest that gut."
"Happy Cinco de Mayo!"
"Well it is only slightly more interesting than a Corona so it isn't worth trying really."
"Technically faithful to style while being a quick quaffer in hot weather. Given the distro, though, probably the best option in some backwaters."
"(It doesn't hurt that you can find these things on special at different Mexican joints in 32 oz mugs... hell to the yea!)"
"Drinkability: While nothing spectacular, this has to be one of the best mainstream lagers around. Always good with standard fare and Mexican food."
"Drinkable enough, but kind of pricey for the quality."
"An enjoyable enough amber lager; there seems to be a quiet beauty in its simplicity, maybe because of the lack of off-flavours and concentration on the malt, something that seems typically wanting in many of its peers to the north. It definitely outshone what passes for a Mexican restaurant plate here in Hogtown."
"Pours a light amber color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Drinkability: It's cold and wet. I bet this is thirst quencher in the low latitudes. In all, an average beer."
"Taste is malty, toasted, and just a little sweet on the finish. Just really isn't very flavorful, or really anything that makes it a dynamic or enjoyable or experience. Just a little thin and quick drink - particularly for a vienna lager. It is what it is, but its just not that great."
"D-I guess better than other macro imports but I see why they always offer the lime. I would avoid."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy, and is enjoyable for what it is. A nice brew to have a couple of with some fajitas. Probably not the best representation of the style, but a decent brew."
"Its fairly weak in taste, but provides a nice refreshing experience."
"This is however the best mexican beer I can think of, without a doubt."
"This beer is a one of my go-too's when i'm eating mexican. Pours a deep amber color. nice off-white head. smells of grain, rice, lime, and barley. tastes the same. mouthfeel is light to moderate fullness. this beer is solid. nothing off color. it's well rounded and perfect for mexi-pairing. by itself on a hot summer day with a lime (yes, it's ok. it's your beer. do with it what you will. i like it with and without. depends on my mood.) cheers."
"D- While this is easy to drink, due to it being a lighter body and not the most flavorful Vienna style beer, it's not a very inspiring beer. It's better than a lot of other Mexican beers I've had. I say it's very average and might be better with some spicy food or something."
"I imagine this would be even better for enjoying all day long pool side. Not something to bother smelling or noting head retention. Just enjoy."
"I want to lower my score more with every sip."
"This brew just does not hit any marks that you would look for in a a good brew. It looks decent I guess, but is just way too watery and unflavorful to recommend. Next time pass."
"Appeared amber/gold- red and consistent, smells forward, pungent, thick& earthy, a muddy taste, grainy mouthfeel, limit 1 and this is acceptable and fun with strong/spicy food. Looked forward to getting it over with overall without food. Did not involve a lime, maybe should have. Came highly recommended, did not deliver. This was out of the bottle and into a pint glass, have heard better about tap and big happy hour glasses."
"I am pretty sure I've only had this beer on tap. I always get this when we go out for Mexican food; $4 for 24 oz. is pretty awesome. Has a very nice dark amber color, fluffy off-white head. Minimal lacing. Taste is very balanced and smooth, always complemented nicely by two slices of fresh lime. This just has a great bitter hop and malt presence that can be appreciated by beer people and casual drinker alike. Mouthfeel is thin to medium, drinkability is rockin'. Awesome before, during and after the beach. Enjoy this with a burrito the size of your head."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees/ The color was AMBER. The beer had good lacing. The beer had a bit of a skunky green smell but did not taste that way. In fact it is a good ber. Taste is slightly sewwt of candy with a malty finish. The beer had no head at all. Despite the retard commercials for this beer I will buy again, Stay Drunk My Tasty Friend1"
"Pours deep amber with a nice head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is slightly grainy and thin. Flavor is slight but crisp, with good amber malt flavor and a hint of hops. Slight metallic character, a whiff of sulfur. Flavor falls away to slight finish. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, but not unpleasant."
"In any case, it's often king of the molehill in a restaurant. Keep your Corona's and limes away from me, and I'll generally be happy with this in my pint glass."
"I would take one of these over a Corona any day of the week. I know it doesn't have the overpowering flavor that us hop heads love but it still has a good taste. The one thing about this beer is the drinkability of it. I could take a 12 pack of this and have a good night. But overall its easy to drink with a good taste but nothing special."
"This beer is ok. Not bad, not great, just ok. But if the Mexican restaurant carries Bohemia, get that instead."
"Taste is similar, lightly toasty grain, hints of nut and mineral, hint of caramel, light grass, hint of leaf. It's lightly sweet with faint bitterness in finish, with a lingering toasty grain aftertaste. It becomes a bit watery and thin over time."
"Mi Rancho in Germantown with the Platos Maria combo. I didn't have high hopes for this. I'd had it in a bottle before and it was a forgettable (albeit slightly darker) Mexican lager. But on tap, well... Color is dark gold with a nice head; a bit of bubbles dancing through the glass. Smell is all malt. Light to moderate mouthfeel with nice carbonation. Taste is all malt with something else (rice? corn?) that provides a slick, smooth maltiness that stops just short of cloying by a slight hops bitterness. Actually quite tasty and drinkable (the light body and carbonation helps a lot in that department) and, while I kept asking myself ""this is Mexican beer?"" while the quality and drinkability of the product won me over. Great with Mexican food and I'll do it again, if on tap."
"Fairly easy to drink a few of these in a sitting."
"D: Not too heavy, not too light, pretty good weight. Goes down easy except for the aftertaste."
"Decent mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Drinkability: A supremely easy to drink brew. Would I want to drink more than a few of these? Only if there was nothing else but the standard BMC+Imports fare. It still tastes like they didn't put much effort into quality and taste, but its better than most ""shitty beers"""
"Came home and had a Stone Levitation to end the night on a better note."
"Drinkability- Fairly boring, but goes down smoothly and easily. I drank this fairly rapidly and could drink a second without complaining, but I'd ""prefer"" something else."
"Drinkability- Not very interesting or especially easy drinking."
"cheers! ... i guess"
"Drinkability is just ok.Its not a terrible beer, but it just doesn't leave me wanting more. Just an ok beer in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Kind of a ""meh"" beer for me. Not the best I've had, not the worst I've had. Probably worth a try but don't go out of your way."
"Overall I'm not impressed. Miller light is cheaper and offers just as much."
"D: I hate this, so not drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Pour is amber, as noted. Smells adjuncty ... and of sweet malts. Taste is of malt and grain. This beer may not be the most interesting beer in the world but compared to the other Dos Equis we're leaps and bounds in the future here. I'll be drinkin you with my burritos for years to come, I think. Who's to say though."
"Sorry Rips, next time you might consider buying American... Or at least European..."
"Notes: It's not the best or most complex Vienna Lager but it is drinkable with no off putting flavors."
"Aside from the obvious Mexican or Tex-Mex, this might go really well with corned beef on rye."
"Drinkability is quite good, it is refreshing and I imagine these would dissapear from my glass quite rapidly expecially if I were having friends over for Mexican if if we were gaming or having a barbecue. I believe it would go quite well with most foods. However I can think of a number of better beers I'd rather buy for approximately the same price."
"Aroma is of toasted malt. Tastes like bready malt (not as toasted as the aroma had hinted at) with an oaken cherry syrup running through it. Not good per se but good enough to wash down some Tex Mex."
"D: Well, I had 3 or so cups at a party, and I remembered why I haven't had it in a very long time. But, when in rome..."
"This is a low class beer that I do not mind that much. The color is nice amber, there is almost no smell. Moderate carbonation with a diffuse head, nothing to speak of really. No lacing on the glass, drinks fine. Minor aftertaste, does not last, does not really affect the overall drinkability. This is an average beer."
"again had this a party this weekend it was this or coors light or miller lite.. had this one... the color is ok and along with the head its a nice amber and the smell is malts and grain faint hops the mouth feel is ok and yeah you can drink a couple nothing offensive here just would never purchase this one"
"Easy to drink, yet hard to actually enjoy since there's nothing fun about this. It's potable, but that's it."
"T- To be honest, maybe I was drunk already, but it tasted very similar to the Dos Equis regular lager (out of the green bottle). Pilsnery and refreshing on a hot summer day, but it's best in that setting."
"Always pleasantly surprised to enjoy this drink, don't find it in front of me much, couple times a year or so."
"Drinkability: This is one of my favorite drinkin' beers and I can drink this stuff all day and all night. While I actually haven't had a Dos Equis Amber in awhile, I'm finding myself really enjoying this one."
"Not the most complicated beer out there, but who said you could only enjoy complicated beers? Easy drinking with decent flavor, and does a good job of washing down Mexican food."
"d- nice and drinkable, i'm enjoying it on a nice hot day, one of the better mexican brews that i've had, i'd drink again."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a touch of malts. Taste is malty, a touch of caramel, light hops, very easy drinking. Feels a bit light in the mouth and overall this makes for a good session beer."
"This is just a good, simple sit around the fire on a cool summer night, with good company, on the edge of a lake, watching the neighbors across the lake shooting off hundred of their own dollars in fireworks, while playing guitar. Just to give you a little visual. But really this is a decent beer. Very fairly priced in most locations. Good amber/auburn color. Small and quickly dissipating head. Nice malty aroma, and I may be wrong but I believe there is almost a slight woodyness to the beer. Very well could have been the where I was, that the woodyness came from. Good crisp mouth feel. Taste is mild, nothing about the beer will take you back to wonder weather or not you'll be able to finish the beer. Even for those with not so adventurous palates. A very drinkable and enjoyable beer."
"This is a great beer. Dos Equis is a truely great brand in the world of 7 dollar six packs, and with their Amber beer, they hit a unique style of flavorful brew and melds perfectly with any spicy meal. Not only is it flavorful, it is drinkable, so if you are going for the gold this is a winner in all respects. If you are a drinker of light beers and affordable pilsners, this may come across a bit too dark, but it is an excellent gateway to stronger beers while remaining in the mild, drinkable category."
"Mexican brews may not be the most complex in the world, and this is no exception - but they're all drinkable, and they all go well with a big fat chimichanga."
"Drinkability: I thought this was pretty good. It's something that I could see myself drinking on it's own, with no food or anything. Worth a try."
"The body of this beer is medium-light, with a good amount of carbonation: not too much, not too little. Very drinkable and hard to dislike, but still somehow not very memorable. I would drink this again if it was offered to me, but I definitely would not seek it out on my own or pay for it. It's really just okay."
"This is a very quaffable beer, kind of like a lager-version of a mild brown ale, though less cloyingly sweet than a lot of browns. Not a flavor bomb, but definitely something I could drink several of in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but not much character."
"D- For a Mexican beer i found it to be pretty good, normally I have had bad experienes with them, but this is good"
"A hot weather beer or a food chaser. Not terrific, but one of the fairer choices from Mexico."
"Appearance is slightly pleasing, a crystal clear dark amber without any head but some nice lacing. Smell is thin and pungent, smells skunked even though it came from a keg... just something off about it. Mouthfeel is nothing special, sparkling water almost. Drinkability isn't bad because there's hardly any flavor so you can gulp one down without giving it much thought."
"Out of all the Mexican imports, this has to be one of my two favorites. Much better on draft than out of the bottle, and the lime isn't necessary (even though I receive one everytime I order). Great with burritos, or nachos -- really anything that might be overly salty with cheese. Nice to have on hand for grilling too. Refreshing."
"D: Well, I would not recommend it as there is really nothing going on here. Better option than many macro types but not worth seeking out."
"ah, not very delicious. easy to drink but mild at best."
"Mouthfeel is way light, deceptively so for the rich color, so fairly underwhelming. I really think this one is better out of the bottle for some reason...having it in the glass just makes it look better than it tastes."
"D - Goes down easy. Nice to sit back with after some yard work."
"Started well, but as the review progressed it became obvious this wasn't a good beer, no matter what style it is placed into."
"It's got a nice Amber color to it and it smells really good until I sipped it. I got it on tap and I do not believe that they cleaned the filter at all because it tasted like metal and there was no fizz in it. It was not a good beer. It was only $2 on tap and it was because the bar had too much of it. It was a disappointment."
"Overall a pretty decent beer and compliments Mexican cuisine well. Not my favorite Mexican beer, but not bad."
"The feel of this beer is light, crisp and refreshing and is light in ABV so it makes for a good session beer. This is a fairly easy drinking beer and is a better beer for hot days, goes well with steak."
"It is hard to know how to think of Dos Equis. Part of me wants to praise it for being much better than Corona, the only other beer I have tried from Mexico, but in reality it is a relatively average beer."
"This is more drinkable than most American macros, though drinkability is lowered for a bit of a lackluster appearance."
"D - I can see it going down bottle after bottle but for its cheap flavor and gross after-taste, I wouldn't want to put very many of these back."
"Final Thoughts - Decent amber lager. Makes for a good session beer, and what Dos Equis should really push. Worth a 12 pack, especially during the warmer weather."
"Overall, pretty average but not too bad. I've had better amber lagers."
"It's got a nice, clear amber color, leaning towards orange, with no real head or lacing to speak of. There is a light sweet malt aroma with some citrusy hops, showing promise. But it tastes like dirty water, no complexity or character to speak of. It's got a light mouthfeel and is pretty easy to drink"
"Amber colored beer with a very rapidly fading head.Aroma is bread and malts.Taste is the same bread and malts with a touch of caramel mixed in.Smooth and tasty goes down real easy.Recommended and something I can see myself purchasing in the near future."
"From the 355 ml. bottle marked 02239. Sampled on April 25, 2009 (without a lime wedge). The pour is amber with a slight haze to it and a limited amount of head that fades away in short order. The aroma is kind of bready with a tad bit of hops in the background. Slightly below medium mouthfeel but not watered down by any means. The taste is bitter but not in the traditional English Bitter style. Bitter, as in sour or tart. This is a good one for a hot day."
"drink a lot of these 20 years ago in a neighborhood bar i frequented - people used to comment on the 'dark beer' i was drinking - i haven't had one of these lately, and these weren't bad on tap, especially with the spicy enchilada's i was eating - nice to revisit dos xx in it's proper environment."
"Beer with a dark amber color and coppery tones, small head of foam that disappears quickly; the smell is floral, hops, is pleasant; the taste have some roast malt, wood, and some caramelized hops, tasty; the mouthfeel have a medium bitterness accompanied by a high carbonation, little dry, good body; in the drinkability i love drink this beer with blue cheese."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Overall very decent, has some decent flavors which are a little watered down, but it's not like this is some expensive Ale where talking about. This beer reminded me of Negro Modelo, with similar flavors and aromas, and surprised me in a way with it's subtle oak wood like flavors. Pretty enjoyable and very affordable! Id say give this one a try, for the flavor the price is right! Cheers!"
"Not horrible, not good. It may be better than most macros, but it is more expensive too."
"A decent amber lager. I would order this in a Mexican restaurant but not buy again off the shelves. It's well constructed with no off flavors (like skunk in Corona) but uninteresting. It is highly drinkable."
"drinkability: very easy but horrible dirty aftertaste. beer than a bud but not better than much other."
"Drinkability: This beer sucks, but it still goes down smoother than a lot of other cheap macros."
"this beer probably would have been more satisfying with a meal, for it was pretty dull by itself. however it is definitely a more noble choice than some other macro brews from south of the border....which all have one thing in common ($$$$)"
"This is one of the best beers available easily to me that is brewed in Mexico, and it is worth a try. I wouldn't pass if it was the only thing around, but it's not my first choice."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of slight hops up front, then pale malt, and finally some yeast cleanliness. Fits the style of a Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt up front, then very slight hops, and finishes with strong yeast cleanliness. Overall, just another poorly made Vienna."
"D- Easy to drink just nothing to write home about."
"Clearly not a horrible beer but it's just enough to be average for the style. It's certainly too bad as it had a potential to be decent. You could still enjoy it but it would be easier to just drink water."
"D - Overall this beer is ok its better than other macro beers but thats about it theres better beers out there that I'd drink before this one"
"D 4.0 - good balance, I enjoyed the malty subtle hop presence"
" Drink: very drinkable goes down good, for around 20 bucks a case not to bad the best mexican beer i ever had"
"Cheers!"
"I had the beer at a restaurant and for some reason they did not managed to get me a glass. Without glass, I am unable to say anything about the color really. Carbonation seemed well balanced, aroma was nice and malt/hop flavor was well balanced. Not sure if it really can be considered a true Vienna Lager by style since it appeared to be me more of a BMC type beer. Overall beer went down well and I wouldn't mind getting another one at some point despite the mainstreet touch to the style."
"drinkability- Extreme, a session beer in its glory meant for drinking alot and quick, but still enjoyable enough to be appreciated, cheap cheap and good for the price you pay for them, I can get 12 for under 10 bucks worth the buy. good value for what it is"
"Medium carbonation, fairly light, not too watery. True to the cliche, pairs well with Mexican food and probably makes for a nice lawn mower beer at the very least. I usually don't like Mexican beers but this one is alright...you don't even need to shove citrus down the neck, hell you can actually pour it into a glass..."
"Overall: for a cheap beer it's not too bad, well carbonated and actually has some flavor. Very easy to drink a lot of."
"Overall, a nice surprise -better than other traditional macros IMO."
"A little better atmosphere than the ""Special Lager"". Flavor is pretty decent, and feel is not offensive. Overall, decent quaff."
"Not a bad beer to drink, but not something I get my hopes up for. Not exciting, but tolerable."
"Drinks down smooth enough."
"A dark amber color,with light tan head. Malty slightly caramel aroma.Flavor is somewhat fruity,with toasted biscut malt,seems subdued.This could be a really good beer if the flavor came out a bit more,I detect little if any hops.Crisp finish,smooth mouthfeel.Better if drank cold.Drinkable but not special in any way."
"Drinkability is good, not much overpowering flavor to get in the way of drinking lots of this. Pretty much just a thirst quencher or pairing with mexican food when nothing better is to be found."
"Not a bad beer at all, but I could never see this being one of my regulars. The only time I normally drink this is at Mexican restraunts, where it is often the only thing on tap outside of bud light. Goes good with mexican food. Almost always served with lime."
"Don't drink and review."
"Clear brown with a short white head. No lacing. Sweet aroma of caramel and cereal, possibly some grassy hops, and, as this is a Mexican beer, corn. Taste is the same, only watery. Works for Mexican food as there is nothing to fill you up. The original XX is better."
"Pretty drinkable, very average. A bit dark, some caramel, some malt. Forced carbonation destroys the mouthfeel. Overall, pretty average, uninspired beer. But I suppose it's better than some of the other awful Mexican beers I've had."
"This beer couldn't be any more average to me. Tastes oddly similar to the other Dos Equis out there, just darker in color and maybe a small tad more taste. I mean, it's right on par with Michelob as a mass produced ""Amber lager"" but it cannot compete with the microbreweries with this style. They usually cost the same price too which makes it obsolete. Basically it's drinkable and and quench your thirst.. but look elsewhere for well balanced, tasty beer."
"The taste is very watery, very weak, and not terribly interesting, but it's an okay beer. It's not objectionable by any means. The beer is primarily caramel malty but cheaply made with hints of adjunct, sweetner, and macro who knows what. There is a slight graininess to the beer, maybe a slight corny-ness to the beer too. Dominant is the caramel malts and adjunct sweetner. The beer is light bodied, only moderately carbonated, and light in the mouthfeel. No real aftertaste to speak of. A pretty mediocre beer that works well in the right occasions, like a Mexican themed cook out."
"Pours a clear amber with a small head after a vigorous pour. The quickly fades to a thin cap. Some spotty lacing is left on the glass during consumption. The aroma consists of some malt and light, floral hops. Very subdued aroma even in my Sam Adams glass. Flavor is good with a semi-dry flavor profile. The malt is there but again lacks any strength. Hops are light and add nicely to the finish. Has a light body and a bit overcarbonated. Not harsh but just a little fizzy. A decent beer but lacks enough flavor to make it one of the better lagers. Good enough to drink but a bit expensive for what it is."
"Pours somewhat dark with an indifferent head. The smell is very grainy, mostly corn. Taste is alright. The hops are there, just not jumping out at you. Malt is weak. You get a strong taste of grain in this, not as bad as some, but you wish there was more malt. This is better than Corona, that's not saying much."
"The Mexican restaurant has a couple of Sam Adams products on tap as well as Wachusett IPA. I'll be having those from now on and not stray back to this one."
"A very drinkable brew, but as far as amber or Vienna lagers go, this one is certainly geared more toward the masses than even the renowned Sam Adams Boston Lager. Not bad, but certainly nothing exceptional as far as complexity goes. Still, a good alternative to the blander mass-market lagers that dominate the shelves."
"D: This is just another mass-produced beer with little to recommend it. There's little taste or character with this one."
"This one's a nice spot start. Not one for the regular rotation but when the matchups are good it'll eat up some innings."
"D- A decent beer to go for at a Mexican restaurant, though not a great example of a Vienna Lager. However it does make for a refreshing beverage."
"Light bodied but not too light and not overly done with the carbonation, this is an easy drinker and I'm glad I tried it again. Yes I am."
"My favorite mexican import. Great with mexican food - chips, salsa, etc."
"Drinkability: Well its refreshing enough on a hot day, but it isn't the best beer to do so with. I'd say its a good beer though, just not amazing."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a dark amber color with a thin, quickly disappearing white head. Aroma of light sweet malts, grass, and a touch of hops. Flavor is basically the same, slightly bitter finish. Pretty smooth and somewhat dry finish, a decent Mexican beer."
"The head on this one starts out fairly thick w/ tiny bubbles and medium dimples but then fades away into obvlivion. There is some mild lacing going on. The smell is mostly malts as well as the taste. It does the style justice and is a great beer for those just starting to experiment with darker beers. It is smooth and drinkable."
"Aroma is just not there, and the same can be said for the taste. It is very thin on the palate, and you keep smelling and trying again so you can write something meaningful, but it is just near tasteless. Add a lemon, so it tastes like lemon; but the best option is to stay away."
"I went on the recommendation from the most interesting man in the world and it could have been worse."
"Not a good beer."
"A thinnish, seethru cocoa puff brown that has a small head but does leave some lacings. Weak hop smell of floral/earth notes mixed with a little bit of sweet malts (coffee, chocolate, caramel?). While overly dry and husky on the tongue, it does have a crisp backbite from the hops (not much else from the hops) and a semi-sweetness from the malts. A little too much of a bland aftertaste, but this is not a bad beer."
"One of the better Mexican beers out there. Pretty refreshing. I think it might be better with a lime wedge. *hangs head*"
"I'd say this is a little better than your average Mexican beer. It pours a dark amber color but it tastes a lot lighter than it looks. Watery at times. Easy drinking though and refreshing enough. I'd be curious to do a taste test with this and, I don't know, almost any other Mexican beer and see if there's a difference. I suspect this one would be a bit better than many of the others."
"Prost!"
"A very watery mouthfeel, but a nice refreshing beer, probably the best mexican beer I've had so far, beats the hell out of corona."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer that is actually a nice mexican alternative."
"D - Not a terrible brew, but average at best and certainly a pretty lackluster vienna lager, though I actually thought I was drinking an amber lager."
"Pours a darkish, very translucent amber with almost no head. Smells like beer. Maybe some malt comes through a little bit. Tastes kind of like bread, but there isn't a whole lot of taste to it. Mouthfeel is pretty light and makes it a pretty easy beer to drink. Overall a very average beer, though it does go down well with some enchiladas."
"Plenty light and refreshing. Very drinkable on a hot day."
"The mouthfeel might be the most disappointing part of the beer. It feels extremely thin and watery. Undercarbonated, to say the least. I don't really want another one."
"Overall a nice and refreshing beer, one I bought by mistake but I'm glad I had the opportunity to re-evaluate!"
"Recommended..."
"Not much of interest here. I can think of a Mexican Vienna Lager that blows this out of the water (Bohemia). On it's own - bland, but generally inoffensive."
"The taste did not match my expectations. It was very thin and watery, which made it easy to drink, but who'd want to? Tasted very sweet and citrusy. No crispness, no bite. Nothing much going on. Unpleasantly surprised."
"Could drink a lot of these. One was good with pork chop the other night, too. Overall, this is a good brew for the price"
"D: I could drink this all night, it goes down easy and smooth. A great thirst quencher on a hot afternoon, or with a plate of Mexican food. Don't knock this one until you have had it on tap."
"D: This is a great warm weather beer or just a beer to enjoy when you are broke. Grew up on the stuff and it never gets old to me."
"Unbalanced, all malt. Like a doppelbock mixed 50/50 with water. Expensive to boot due to import status. Not at all worth it."
"Can't believe I had never tried this before, now that I have and I'd drink it again. Maybe get some the next time I have Mexican."
"I seriously down about 2 tall mugs of this stuff every time I head out to the local Mexican restaurant. For only $3 you practically get two pints worth of this stuff and it's definitely a steal. It's a great summer beer!"
"D: Having this after Negra Modelo, it didn't really stand up to it, not a horrible choice overall though, it has its moments."
"D - Excellent beer for a hot summer day. Taste is not overpowering, making it easy to throw down a couple at a time. An excellent choice for enjoying a couple at a BBQ."
"mouthfeel is sessionable, light, crisp, but not a lot of flavor - a far better choice for a hot day than an american lager"
"D: Despite the taste being nothing spectacular, the mouthfeel was fairly nice and pleasant, making the beer easy to enjoy and nice to drink. This beer is definitely one I could see myself drinking with some friends and just chilling during the summer."
"I had this in Mexico last weekend, its certainly superior to most Mexican macrolagers. It's a good escape from corona and other Mexican crap, goes well with authentic Mexican tacos."
"Notes: Tried this at a Mexican spot and it was not bad at all. I probably won't buy this for my home stock,but it is a decent beer. Not complex,average for it's style."
"This is a great beer to start the night off with. It isn't a common, corn and rice reliant domestic, but it won't destroy your pallet either. You can drink one of these and still enjoy heavier, more pronounced beers later on in the night."
"I tried this beer on March 7, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joe's"" in Toronto. The beer poured a solid reddish-brown colour with a thin white head. The aroma was primarily grassy with a little malt. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied, but highly carbonated. The flavour was grassy, a little malt, and a little sourness. Definitely better than a Corona or a Tecate."
"Thank goodness this was included in a ""beers of Mexico"" mix pack from the brewery; otherwise I'd have written them off completely with the exception of this and Bohemia, which should replace Sol in the pack, but can't for bottle's size sake. Damn."
"Picked up a six pack yesterday to celebrate Cinco de Mayo and paired them with a taco dinner. Poured into pilsner glasses. Reddish orange color with a thin wispy head that fizzled out quickly. Didn't get anything in the odor department. Taste was somewhat bland, mostly just corn. Other than the color, not much difference between this amber lager and a regular lager. Tried one with a lime and one without, not much difference. Thin and watery overall. I guess it's a good beer if you want to swig down a few while munching on some Mexican, but I won't seek this one out again. A bit better that Corona, if that means anything, I guess."
"One of the better mass-market Mexican beers, for sure. Kicks Corona and all the American macros I've tried in the balls."
"MF & D- kinda fizzy, but i'm thankful that it doesn't become syrupy as the temp goes up. perhaps i have all those bubbles to thank. finish is crisp and clean and there is enough flavor going on the keep me interested while putting back a few of these"
"Not a bad session beer. It has an amber color with a white head. Pleasant syrupy flavor, somewhat like molasses. Smell is sweet but light faintly of hops. Mouthful was lite. It'd be a good beer for sessions as it doesn't seem to be as strong as some other beers."
"D: Average drinkability. You wont be wowed but actually wont totally turn you off as well. You can drink this easily but may disappoint the hardcore fans of the American amber style."
"Some may sell this beer short, as it is not as full-bodied and interesting as most US amber ales & vienna lagers. However, in comparison to most other Mexican offerings, and taking into consideration its design to be a darker, quenching brew for hot-weather climates, this is a very good example of what beers from Mexico can bring to the table."
"I have this on tap every Thursday at my local Mexican restaurant. Is an amber/brown color with a moderate amount of lacing along the glass. Taste is relatively bitter. It's kind of lacking and watery with the mouthfeel. Overall, not a bad beer - average across the board."
"M/D: The feel is lightly carbonated and watery with a decent bitterness to it. The drinkability is good for a light beer to drink while working or playing. This one can be kept in a bottle or poured in a glass the air does enhance the flavors a bit and reduces some of the carbonation."
"d: a decent beer for spicy foods like curry or mexican and a decent macro but that is all that is really in this beer's favor"
"This beer poured a dark brown with a red tinge and next to no head. The smell is of sweet malts with a slight caramel scent. The taste is of slightly toasted malts that start off with some sweetness that is cut with a slight amount of hops. The mouthfeel is slightly watery with a moderate amount of carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good for a lager, but I'd say the best part about this beer is how well it pairs with good Mexican food."
"smells and tastes ""clean"". Alcohol in the smell and taste. A nice sweetness comes through in the sip. This is not a great beer but better than most lagers I have had."
"D - Easily drinkable, but slightly low on malt character. Not particularly interesting, but good for what it is, and it deserves some recognition for consistently being the best beer available at most Mexican restaurants."
"wow, i got this on sale for $ 5.99 a sixer at the grocery ; pours a clear copper-gold color w/ a decent white frothy head which dissipates very quickly leaving a fair amount of lacing in my nonic ; very faint smell, a bit of floral hops w/ some hints at graininess and a touch of alcohol ; a bit more malt present here w/ caramel-like flavors and hop bite initially followed by a nutty, faintly metallic taste midway, got the tradional munich/vienna-type finish ; a bit watery, dry, light body , decent co2 helps thicken it though ; overall, a fairly decent vienna and at an even cheaper than macro price, this one's above average on the drinkability scale in my book...."
"Easy to drink and unique from other popular brews."
"You could do a lot worse."
"D: Perfect with Mexican food. Among the best mass produced Mexican beers."
"D- It's a refreshing beer and something I'd drink when options are short on a mainly macro taplist."
"Pours a nice golden clear copper. Very attracive. No real head and not much lacing though which takes away a little from the apprearance. Smells of alcohol, some malt and an unpleasant ground corn. Tastes of a slightly roasted malt with a slight trace of a mild hop. Taste is much better than the smell. Very smooth, somewhat crisp and yet a tad dry. Very drinkable because it is smooth with no bitter bight, but has a pleasant flavor. Stacks up very well against other macros. On a side note, this beer is best consumed out of the bottle (and with some chips and salsa of course) because of the aroma (smells like a cheap macro to me) is not appealing. Straight out of the bottle this becomes a very good, easy drinking macro."
"This is a tasty Mexican lager and usually the best one available on draft at a Mexican restaurant. It pours nice with a small head that leaves decent lacing. It tastes of fresh malt with a bit of noble hops. It was very drinkable and went great with Mexican fare."
"A go to beer when in a Mexican joint for me (probably because nothing else decent is available). I find myself always going back to this beer. Pours an amber red. Smell is of straw. Taste is a malty sweet straw flavor. Infinitely more flavorable than most other Mexican offering readily available in Northern California, but rather bland when compared to good beers. However, this beer does go excellent as a thirst quencher when eating spicy Mexican food, and I find myself drinking it quite a bit."
"Avoid."
"Flavor has some toasted malt character, lightly sweet with a dry residual sugar in the aftertaste. Hint of tart apple bitterness is there, also white grape, but not too pronounced. It's light, also balanced with good carbonation and light maltiness. After finishing one I had another, and so did everyone else. Not a bad choice, but I still prefer Bohemia as my #1 Mexican lager. Paired well with a carnitas/pulled pork dinner. As a side note, this makes a mean michelada..."
"Drinkability: I wish that some of these Mexican chain restaurants could get some decent cervesa! This beer is refreshing.... but not interesting enough to have again."
"Overall better than many, not as good as some. For the style and for your money, just get a good ol Sam Adams."
"I had this brew on-tap at El Coyotes in Crestview Hills, KY. It is amber in color (go figure) and is transparent in appearance. The barkeep at El Coyotes needs to learn how to pour a beer! There was absolutely no head so therefore there was no head retention to speak of. Taste was average and slightly hopped. This is the perfect beer for enchiladas. If you get into mexican food you gotta pair this beer with it. On its own, i would skip it unless it is the only beer worth drinking on the happy hour menu."
"D: It pairs well with Mexican cuisine, and is pretty good served at low temperatures. Good for mild summertime. It's my standard when eating Mexican."
"Mouthfeel + Drinkability - A very smooth beer, very easy to drink these one after another, however I don't know who would actually want to do that."
"D- The primary saving grace of this beer is the fact that it is very easy to drink and is a decent thirst quencher, especially when enjoying hot Mexican food."
"This beer goes very good with Mexican food. Perfect to sip on next time you go to a Mexican restaurant."
"This was once a Vienna beer. Unfortunately, most of the character has fled over the years, and it is now only slightly more interesting than Michelob Dark. Grainy nose, with hints of malt. Nice color, decent head, but fades fast. Flavor is dry for style, but not too bad, some decent malt notes. Hops virtually absent, except in tail."
"My sample came with a frozen goblet, which kept the beer cold the whole time. Light reddish brown color topped off by a good head. The smell is dextrin like, but much of the aroma is muted by the cold temperature. More of the same in the taste, but with a little bit of caramel and a light bitterness to level it out. It features the Mexican trademark of a light and easy drinking beer. Very similar to the other Mexican beers brewed in the Vienna style. Keep this cold, or risk dealing with corn flavors."
"Review added 11-20-2007, translated from french 3-2-2008."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't stand up on a chair and cheer about it, but it's not altogether terrible, actually."
"."
"D- Not bad would not run out and buy it, but good when you are out to dinner or having Mexican food."
" This was a curiousity beer that I know many folks enjoy, but i still trying to figure out why."
"It is what it is. Nothing to make this beer stand out, but stylistically right-on. I would grab a sixer of this in the summer if it weren't so expensive. For the price there are definitely more interesting beers out there, and people that like these kind of beers generally go for much cheaper offerings within this style, IMHO."
"Note: I see that the ABV isn't listed, I've seen a couple of sources that say 4.7 - 4.8%t"
"Overall a tasty and easy drinking lager. Certainly worth a try on tap."
"Its rather meek and mild, but it pairs really well with food and thats why I give her an A!"
"Nice brownish-copper in colr..a pencil width of head was all that an aggressice pour would brong. Small gobs of lacing on the sides of the glass. Faint aroma of roasted malt and some very faint, floral hop. Not much there for taste other than some very faint malts and a metallic taste that's hard to describe. Found it had a slight 'plastic-like' aftertaste...maybe that's the old shoelace Iron Dijn was describing. Average mouthfeel for a mexican beer, somewhat watery, but easy enough to drink on a hot day."
"Would probably go with something else next time if my buddy offered"
"Dos Equis Amber has dark caramel or copper color, but theres almost no head and it dissipated quickly. A touch of lacing. Although the smell is light it was a nice combination of lemony citrus and caramel with a general hoppiness underneath. Nice carbo sharpness in the first part of the taste, then the caramel comes through, but its not overly sweet. Hops are also around (with a touch of lemon highlights), but its the malts the stand out here. Finish was mild and light with just a touch of dry. Mouthfeel was light but not watery and I enjoyed the carbonation that was about dead center (not too little or too much). Drinkability: like the carbonation, Ill call this one down the middle too. Its nice, but unexceptional. Having said that, I should also say its far from bad. A good beer for passing the time when you dont want to beer to take center stage."
"Of course a good old standby while visiting a latin eatery. I do appreciate this beer although I find myself only consuming it with a meal. Not a beer I drink without accompanying latin food. It just pairs up nicely with such. Amongst other large scale brewing companies I will give this beer a fair amount of credit. The taste usually clouded by the meal so I will refrain from getting too deep with characteristics."
"Definatly a summer time mexican beer. Light bodied despite the slightly darker color. Decent choice for a bbq or outdoor party."
"M&D: quite smooth in carbonation and the body is light w/o tasting thin; however, this beer succeeds as far as here. Its super easy-drinking but very boring amber lager, desperately in need of lots of other elements to boost up the profile."
" ~ This is one beer I can't see having again, it's a 'One 'N Done.' I compare all Amber beers to Point Amber brewed out of Stevens Point, Wisconsin and this one is having a hard time holding its own in my opinion. To top it off it cost me $2.99 for the bottle, no thanks."
"As for drinkability, this was a rather flavorful and easy-drinking Mexican offering. However, too many aspects of this beer seemed ""off."""
"I had this at a Mexican restaurant yesterday and after years of enjoying this, largely from a bottle, I have to give it some benefit of the doubt in my review, because this sample was a bit disappointing. Although it looked its usual beauteous deep copper color, the head was a bit thin on this one, modest lace. The aroma was also very thin and barely suggested some wheat perhaps but not much else. The head died pretty quickly and with the first swig I was surprised at how lifeless this was. Not quite flat officially but definitely not what I have come to expect. There is a light carmel flavor but I also got a slight metal detector reading. There is a fine carbonation though it is not too powerful. There is some sweet wheat noted but overall I was disappointed in this on tap. By the bottle it is almost always a winner and a great choice with heavy food like you might typically have at a Tex/Mex restaurant. I will have to review a bottle to help even up the score here."
"Had this at Hooters tonight, because well, there was a decent selection for Hooters, about 40 beers, but this was the only one I had never had, so that was reason enough for me. Pored a golden amber, with a slight reddish hue. A big fizzy white head graced the top and faded quickly leaving behind a decent little top of film, and some residual lacing for a minute or two. Nice carbonation was evident from the start. Smell was very light, practically non existent here. What was there was maybe some kinda light grain, but it was really faint, maybe a touch of some kind of bready yeast..The taste was rather blah and non descript. Your typical amber lager really. Lots of malt, no hops, and a touch of grain, thats about it. Pretty good mouthfeel as the carbonation kept things pretty lively on the palate, and it went down very smooth, with a quick, crisp finish. Very clean. Drinkability was above average, as very cold this was one that you could throw down a ton of. Overall I have had muc worse, and for a macro, not actually half bad. Went pretty damn well with dinner. I would definatly have one again, though I wouldn't put a sixer in my fridge"
"More than competent beer here and another that stands out from the Carta Blanca and Corona clones of the Mexican beer scene. Not my favorite but worth drinking."
"Definately sometimes the best choice available unfortunately. Thanks Josh for the sample."
""
"I had this at Abuelo's the other night...Abuelo's, good. Dos Equis, ehhh. Served in a pitcher then poured into frozen glasses, ehhh. Amber in color. Smell of grains, corn, some light malts and a lighter hop scent. Taste is somewhat bland with nothing standing out too much. Corny, grainy, sweet malts. I don't find much balance in this brew. Average mouthfeel. Right carbonation and kind of refreshing once you get past taste. I couldn't really even pour my second beer from the pitcher. For some reason I used to enjoy this a little, but it's lost what qualities I used to see in it for the most part. Negra Modelo es muy bien, Dos Equis, asi asi."
"D - Good stuff. One of the better beers to come out of Mexico, but it's still nothing to get exticed about. I drank two with dinner, and could happily session a six pack summer or winter."
"had this on-tap at a hoochie bar in a plastic cup. appearance was nice, a hazy amber (really?) with a creamy head and sticky lacing. the other facets of this beer did not live up to the looks, kinda like a good lookin' girl who was lame in bed. bouqet was pretty much non-existent. i tried to pick up some aromas but did not discern anything in particular, maybe a touch of roasted grains. taste is dry and a bit creamy with a hint of roastiness. mouthfeel was ok. drinkability is alright assuming a relatively low abv, but there's really not enough going on to compel you to keep drinking this."
"D- I am not trashing this beer, but it is one that unforunately taste better freezing cold in a frosted mug at your favorite Mexican food place. I understand that is probably the best way for me to drink it."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking beer. Would be good on summer days of working out in the yard, or anytime you go to the Mexican restaurant and don't want the girly margaritas."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. But, you kind of have to choke it down. Not drinkable at all. It doesn't taste good. Overall, it's not a good beer. I wouldn't recommend it."
"There's nothing like celebrating Cinco De Mayo with a bad Mexican beer. The pour brought an initially promising head retention that disapeared after the first sip, leaving a film atop that proved not appealing. A weak amber color (caramel) later confirmed by the watery texture and taste that the brew makes no real attemp at quality. Aromas and flavors display light caramelization, but not enough to make any meaningful impact in the brew. Flavors hing on graininess, watered-down cola, and a faint resemblance to a lager. Thin body, and adjucts lead to astringency and residual grain and sugars on the palate. Though the beer is not awful, it makes a good run of it. Best to stick with the Negra Modelos next year."
"Picked up at Costco in a Mexican beer sample case of Sol, Dos Equis Lager, Dos Equis Amber, and Tecate. They were out of Sam's brewmaster collection so this looked like something good to try. Not much smell to speak of in the bottle. Poured into my chalice a nice copper bronze color. Nice big bubble head with good structure. Taste is subdued by carbonation similar to the Lager Especial I previously reviewed. However there is a slight sweetness followed with a bittersweet hop flavoring. This is a refreshing beer, but nothing outstanding."
"One of the more flavorful beer choices as far as Mexican lagers go. Pours a light amber color with a small white head that fades to a ring. Decent but subdued aromas of mild malt and grain...nothing offensive. Clean and crisp malt display and refreshing mild bitterness washes down burritos easily. Your best bet at a Mexican restaurent if you want to avoid skunked lagers and corn taste. Very drinkable."
"Rather pale overall, maybe served to cold. One of the best Mexican import lagers, at least has some malt character. Not a great brew."
"D- I got this at a mexican restaurant. Not bad for a mexican beer. its worth a try."
"D- If you are painted into a corner, its better than most American lagers."
"Eric"
"D - This is one of the better brews from Mexico. Certainly worth having on a hot day."
"D- Interesting enough to be sessionable. The flavor is growing on me, but the smell and mouthfell are lacking."
"12oz brown bottle. Reddish-copper crystal-clear body with a thin light tan head. Smells sweet and roasty, like caramel and biscuit. Tastes roasty and grainy and slightly watery with a clean finish. Light body with only moderate carbonation. Better than standard macro lager, but nothing particularly special. You'd be better off with Negra Modelo. Having said that, It's a light drinkable pleasant amber lager."
"I've had this and the lager here in the US, and found them lacking. Tried this again on a recent trip to Mexico, and I swear there's a difference. The beer was a dark brown with a thick tan head. It had a nice malty aroma. Taste also malty, with a little caramel and some hops. Very enjoyable, and it stood up well with Mexican food."
"Dos Equis amber pours a dark amber color with a one inch white head, leaving a fair amount of lacing along the glass. The smell is malty with hints of hop--very nice. The taste follows suit, with a crisp, malty kick. This beer is very refreshing and obviously goes well with mexican food. I had this for years with the lime, but when I had it again for the first time in a while w/o, I definitely agree with purists to leave lime/lemons OUT of beers."
"I have this beer only twice is a nice beer ..but for one or two not more...it have a very nice color (dark),have a little hard taste but i like it...i would drink it again... This is not a beer for hot weather...I buy it from a gas station for $1.61 including tax so is cheap and you can find it almost anywhere"
"Not a bad beer, pretty tasty on a hot day."
"D - Pretty good. Very nice amber brew for those hot summer days. Goes with almost any food."
"12 oz bottle into a mug. Pours a fairly nice amber color, with a small white head that dissolves quick. Smell is grainy and sweet, but very mild, and definitely nothing good (a little metal tossed in there for fun, even coming from a bottle). Flavor is likewise shitty, all crap sweetness, mostly grain, straight-forward. Taste is pretty thin, with high carbonation. The beer is bad, plain and simple. It's a macro-lager that tastes like a macro-lager, but that color is trickily attractive, so the crap taste is all the crap-per when it hits your sad, slowly grimacing lips. It's still better than pretty much every American macro, but I guess I just had expectations that were a little too high. In any case, it sucks."
"The dark brown-amber color invites a taste. Smell is weak but hoppy, and taste is fairly strong although not complex. It has a good tingly mouthfeel with minimum bitterness. Though this is not a ""fine"" beer, it is a good companion to Mexican dishes."
"I would recommend this beer to those who prefer a lager style finish with a bite."
"Poured clear amber with a white head that dropped pretty quickly. Aroma is very subtle, almost not there. The taste is bigger than the aroma would suggest, but still pretty mild. Sweet maltyness rounded out with bittering hops. Rather pleasant overall. Better than macro, if you're in the mood for something light."
"Drinkability- Not as easy-drinking as you might think for the style. It's okay, but it doesn't make up for the blandness in taste and aroma."
"D: It continues to go very well with spicy food, as it did with tonight's enchiladas. Very easy to put a few of these away."
"Enjoyed this beer with a slice of lime. Did not see much difference either way as it did just as well without the lime."
"Not in my usual beer rotation, but there aren't many Belgian's at our local Mexican restaurant... Nice amber color, with minimal head (and the obligate lime slice). Not much aroma of note; essentially masked by the fruit. Taste was clean and crisp; in general malty, with a very little aftertaste. This beer goes down very easily, and pairs nicely with an enchilada."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no head really. It was amber, duh. It smelled of malt, no surprise. The flavor, well, it's malty. Had a zesty mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Very drinkable. It washed down our tacos quite nicely. After two it started tasting a lot like Brooklyn Lager. I never noticed this. Maybe it was just lager lag."
"D: Tastier than I expected, goes down easily, slightly filling, this was not a bad beer and I think it is the type of beer that would go very well with a meal rather than just pounding it down."
" Color is unimpressive and nose is decently malty with some adjuncts. Taste was reasonably full with a bit of creaminess in the aftertaste that I enjoyed. Not great but drinkable at Mexican restaurantts when all they offer is BMC and Corona and its clones. My second rated Mexican beer after Negra Modelo"
"Not bad, actually enjoyable (or was it the scenery?). It's has a nice pour and some simple malt aromas and tastes. Just a touch of bread dough, but enough to make it pass mustard. Texture was good, and the <low> alcohol makes this one a decent pick."
"Also tried this beer last night.. it was better than the Kirin, but not by much. Had a slightly sweet smell, and I tasted a sugary, almost caramel flavor right away. A few people I was with had it with a lime wedge. After a few more sips, the flavor lessened, but the carbonation remained high throughout the whole bottle. Better than a Corona if you have the choice, but I still think there are plenty more options available that are much better."
"A beautiful looking beer with crystal amber clarity and a strong, but not big, head. Taste was lacking somewhat in anything really noticable, but probably because it was served too cold (about 33 degrees). No hop aroma or bitterness to speak of, well balanced by not much maltyness either. Would be improved by more body to back up the color."
"Not very good. Pairs well with bad, chain style mexican food."
"A perfect session beer,not a lot of flavor,but enjoyable,neverless."
"I had previously reviewed this one from a bottle, and I have to wonder if it was skunked. From the tap, this was not half bad. Nothing flashy, but very drinkable. Light and refreshing, nicely balanced--if a little forgettable. Nice amber color, not much head. Went great with my enchiladas!"
"Mouthfeel is a great consistency but damn, this is one flat beer, and still, it stung the mouth a tad."
"amber brown color half inch head fades fast. smell is slightly fruity first taste very sweet apple with some malt. mouthfeel is light not overly carbonated, clean no lingering after taste but not much else going on there. very drinkable very light flavered nice tasting beer. i would buy it again."
"This beer poured a clear amber color with a big persistent head. The smell was sweet and malty. The taste is malty and kind of bland  but not bad. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of thin. This is a very average but highly drinkable beer as it seems quite neutral in flavors."
"My first impression is that this beer seems a little muddled up. There's a faint metallic twinge along with the faint roasted malt presence, and a nuttiness that never really materializes like it should. The adjunct skunkiness is present as well, but mostly it's a sour-sweet combination like unsweetened Apple Juice. Body is thin and watery, but the carbonation is near perfect. Slides down like water as well. This is an unexciting beer but still not nearly as dreadful as most beers from Mexico."
"Try it for a change of pace, you may even like it."
"I've had this many times and I wouldn't call it bad, it just doesn't leave me with any particular memory to speak of."
"Overall - An OK, if slightly bland, beer... Probably worth a try if there's nothing else available..."
"I had this on tap with dinner. Poured to an amber color with off-white head and okay lacing. Seved cold in a cold mug, with lime, and I added salt for extra effect and flavor. While not the typical beer we rate here for taste, flavor, and appearance, it was actually a good beer, given the circumstances. While it was no premium micro brew, it beat the hell out of most macros on the market, and I will likely have again under similar circumstances (read...limited chioices)."
"D- Very drinkable in the warm south in the summer. One of the better imports from the land of Sol. Goes good with all mexican food to tone down those spices and heavy cheese. A light version of Vienna style lagers."
"Amber in color. Large head at first, falls quickly though. Smells of malt, and grains. Taste is of bready malts and a small amount of a hop backbone to throw in some bitter. Pretty light mouthfeel, wish it was a bit thicker. Still not bad. Overall an ok Mexican beer."
"Pours an amber color, don't blink or you might miss the head disappear. Taste is bready malts and noticeable hop flavor and bitterness. I remembered this beer being better than this. Its not bad, but of the Mexican Vienna lagers, I prefer Negra Modelo."
"This poured a not too bad looking amber with a boring head that quickly subsides to nothing. Smell is not so nice, rotten cabbage and some metallic notes permeate the nose in this one. It however really doesn't taste as bad as it smells, a sweet malty aroma that goes down very easily, with a smoothness I really did not expect. This is a decent easy drinking lager that would go well with hot spicy food, or as a refreshing end to a hot day."
"I haven't had Dos Equis in quite a while and that was the stuff in the green bottle visitng Baja. This pours an attractive caramel brown. Smells somewhat sweet. Taste, well here is where I'm not impressed. A bit of a metallic taste along with an average macro graininess to it. Not as nice tasting as it looks. Overall quite disappointed, it's not a drainpour but for any Mexican vienna lagers, Negra Modelo is the one to stick with, not this stuff."
"Above average amber lager....thirst quenchng with some good roasted malt flavor...body is on the light side of medium....not much of an aroma...I like this on a hot summer night when I am thirsty but looking for something with a bit more flavor than a basic macro. I usually start with this but then move on to a Summit Pale or something but occasionally this will hit the spot so good I'll kick back 3 or 4 of these at a time...probably the best Mexican beer I have had"
"Dos Equis Amber pours a copper color with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is very little aroma, just a hint of malt. Decent malty with a mild caramel flavor, with just a little bit of hops. Pretty good compared to most of the Mexican beers I've tried. Worth a try. No lime necessary."
"Overall this beer got the job done, and it was much better than your average Carona."
"They call this ""full-bodied"" on the label..is that a joke? My favorite local Mexican restaurant has anything from flavorful local witbeirs like John's White Ale to St. Bernardus 12 on-draft, so I'd be hard-pressed to find myself ever drinking this there. Flavorful than most macros, but still misses the mark."
"Doverall, it is average. Not much else to say about it, really. Itll do in a pinch."
"This isn't a great beer, but for washing down some Mexican food it's not bad. As far as ""what to order at a Mexican restaurant?"" if the choice is between this and Corona, there's no contest. Nothing to seek out on its own merits either, though."
"Happy Hora @ Mad Mex Robinson yes there were many better options but this one I hadn't had since I was underage so figured it was time to revisit. Appears caramel amber with a white creamy head leaves a trail of fine speckled lacing behind. Aroma contains a touch of metallic character touch of caramel sweetness with not much a hop character to speak of. Flavor fruity note fizzy caramel tone light spritzy citrus note a touch of an herbal edge noted...not bad at all. Mouthfeel is light bodied higher carbonation doesn't make it undrinkable. Drinkability this one's a decent go to in a Mexican restaurant however not at Mad Mex where the selection doesn't even warrant this brew to be imbibed there, nice toasted malt character but I need a bit more flavor on average to be happy."
"One of the better (if not the best) mass-produced dark lagers in North America. I will usually get this at restaurants (if there isn't anything more interesting) and will occasionally get a 6-pack if it's on sale. Though usually it's not any cheaper than buying a much better beer."
"Crisp and light-medium in body, this is an easy-to-drink lager that offers a bit of character in its toastiness."
"Notes: Run of the mill mass-marketed lager. A cut above some Mexican imports (Corona), but not as good as others (Bohemia). The taste unfortunately just can't live up to the appearance. Go with Bohemia if it's available."
"This beer is fairly light bodied and is average in the mouth, nothing out of the ordinary or spectacular. This beer goes down easy, but I probably won't be buying it again. If I want a vienna lager from Mexico I think that I'll go for Negra Modelo. This beer just doesn't do it for me."
"This is a good one to accompany food. Nothing wrong with the beer but nothing exceptional about it either. Pours a fairly clear amber color with a small head, minimal lacing. Smell is very mild malt. Light taste of malt and some bitterness,but once again very mild. Mouthfeel a bit thin, nothing unpleasant in the aftertaste. There is enough flavor here to warrant drinking a few of these, but a session beer should have a little more interesting taste."
"Overall, it is better than macro lagers, but it is a bad Vienna lager. Nothing in the beer to make it a beer worth seeking"
"This is one of the better beers from mexico. and for the record i don't know why people think mexican beer is so awesome, it's not that special"
"Poured a clear amber color with a small head of foam that went away quickly. Aroma was malty with some whiffs of caramel in the nose. Taste was a pleasant mix of sweet malts, some nutty flavors and a faint flavor of cherries. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth and light on the palate. Very easy drinking and actually paired well with a Cuban roast pork sandwich. However, Negra Modelo has more character and would have been a better choice."
"Limp head. Almost no head even with a wild pour. Looks whatever.Smells like industrial cleaners. Tastes a bit like some kind of berry Kool-Aid. Cotton candy dry mouth aftertaste. Does not go well with Mexican or any food.. It's just the kind of beer that says ""I don't care. I'm just barely trying."""
"This beer poured a rusty amber with a decent sized fizzy white head that held for a little bit but eventually left leaving some lace. The smell is all corny adjunct and really not plesant. The taste is a lot of adjunct but some nice amber malts and balanced with some bitterness. Fairly thin and overcarbonated mouthfeel but overall highly drinkable in a mexican resturant."
"Poured this into a pint glass from the bottle it came in. Appearance is a pleasant brown color that makes you excited to try to beer. Nice head that takes a while to calm, but which leaves a decent lace. Smell is rather bitter and smells a bit sour. The taste is not what I was hoping for. Very bitter, almost metallic taste. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. I could see myself drinking this beer again but not as a result of my own beer run. Still, it's worth a try, aren't all beers?"
"Mediocre, but decent and drinkable. Pours out to an amber color with a vigorus head of foam that calms after a minute or two. Some lace, and a medium level of carbonation. Aromas of fresh pancakes and malt, with some yeast notes. Different. Taste is bland and bare; light bready malt with some hop bite is overshadowed by cooked corn and cereal grain elements. Mouthfeel is unexceptional. Drinkability is fair. Nothing offensive, but nothing great either."
"i love XX i worked in a mexican resturant for years and devoloped a taste for good mexican beers and tequila (bohemia/xx and petron). it goes down great in the summer sun and quinches your thurst."
"NOTE: The lime murdered the head, and didn't enhance the flavor at all."
"Nothing unpleasant ,just nothingness."
"Pale amber color, though it was tough to get a proper guage in the varied lighting of the Mexican restaurant in which I sat. Thin head disappeared very quickly. I tried to keep my palette clean for the first half of this beer, and I was not all that impressed. The aroma was faint, sweet, and maybe slightly toasty. It went down easy...too easy. It seemed really thin & watery, not offering up much complexity as I swished it about. Easy enough to drink, but not all that interesting or delectable."
"And it paired very well with crab tacos and warm tortilla chips."
"Carbonation seems to be just right, and this finishes pretty clean. Flavor is primarily toasted malt, the corn is more noticeable on the nose than the pallette, and the mouthfeel is a bit on the watery side. An average amber ale, better than some macro amber ale's i've tried, but not one i'll seek out."
"And this beer is really easy to drink."
"Body is just above light, with a crisp texture and average drinkability. It went well with the Mexican feast it accompanied."
"D- this most likely can be sessioned. easy to drink, enjoyable, probably can go with almost any meal. Good taste."
"Actually a really nice beer. I tend to drink it with enough lime to drown out any flavor, but by itself it's very pleasant. Not the greatest beer in the world but very drinkable."
"Da: Id be willing to bet that Dos Equis is considered cool on Lansdown Street right now. ;-)"
"The Beer smelled of light malts and hops...nothing distinctive. The taste was well balanced and smooth. Once again nothing extremely distinctive, but that is because of the balance. Mouthfeel/drinkablility: this was a beer that was made to be easy to drink, especially with spicy food....worked great to wash down my burrito."
"D: overall an ok beer dispite the modest numbers but i wouldnt drink it on a regular basis"
"D: I didn't buy this so I'm not pissed about wasting money, but I would never buy this. The only plus about it is you can drink a bit of it, but whats that worth in the end?"
"Opinion: I don't really have much to say about this beer. It is really common in the Houston area in all of the little cantinas around. It isn't objectionable, but just really thin. Even though I don't seek this beer out, I will drink it over iced tea...and it actually tastes pretty good with lime juice in it. It is so neutral, it doesn't take much."
"Totally drinkable with a Mexican meal, because it's light and Mexican food tends to be so heavy. But still, not a beer I would die for."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Drinkability: Not bad, but there are much better beers for the price."
"D - I'm glad I only grabbed a single..."
"This pours a nice dark reddish color with a smallish head. The smell is slightly fruity and malty,but it is very hard to smell this. The taste is light and crisp and very refreshing with some maltiness and a bit of fruit. The m/f is light and alittle watery, but not bad. This is a drinkable beer,not great,but I can see myself having this on a hot summer afternoon."
"Copper color with a tannish head. Smell is citrusy and sweet, vanilla-y. Floral. Taste is similar- clean, simple, malty and slightly toasty. Grainy. Mouthfeel is a tad watery but creamy enough to make it okay. Drinkable, sure. Light and easy. I've had worse."
"Overall my second favorite Mexi beer (Negra Modelo is my fave). Nothing exciting but won't let you down either."
"This brew pours a clear amber color. The head is one-finger in height, white in color, and recedes quickly. The aroma is what you would expect from a Vienna Lager. It is rather sweet with some mild caramel and floral notes. The taste is a let down after the nice aroma. It is watery above anything else. Some sweetness does make itself present in the aftertaste, but it is very mild. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with nice carbonation. It is rather perplexing in that there are detectable residual sugars yet they leave to taste making the mouthfeel seem watery. Overall, this brew isn't horrible, but it is not good either. It is not so bad that I wouldn't drink it, but if I had a choice between this brew and SA Boston Lager, I would choose Boston Lager ever time."
"I tried it straight from bottle but I think is better on tap."
"I decided to try this while out to lunch recently. I was under the impresssion that this was supposed to be the better of the two major Mexican beers, the other being Corona of course. Now I can't figure out why. I took this straight from the bottle so it should get a rating of 3 even, but I'm subtracting half a point because there is absolutely no way a beer this weak could possibly have the right color for the style they claim (they say its a Vienna Red Lager, every indication I got was of an American Light Lager). And to put this in perspective, Sam Adams Boston Lager is ALSO a Vienna style Red Lager. I defy anyone to sample this next to a Sam Adams and claim they both correctly fit the same style. Smell was of alcohol and tiny bit of sour hops. Taste was of sour hops, alcohol, the faintest wiff of grain and get this: the bottle. Almost everyone who drinks beer has noticed the taste a can imparts, but how weak does a beer have to be to taste like the glass bottle it came in? As weak as Dos Equis apparently. Eventually, when I was almost at the bottom of the bottle a tiny bit of hop bitterness and adjunct grain flavor came through, but for at least 3/4 of the bottle, a little bit of sour, a little bit of alcohol, and a lot of carbonation were the main flavors. Mouthfeel was very watery and fizzy. Miller Lite has less carbonation. Drinkability lost some points because this beer is just so weak you may as well give up and drink water. Really it is harmless though, it was hard to find anything objectionable because the lack of taste was so complete. If I was going to take a guess at the recipe for this beer I'd say: Drink half to 2/3 of a Michelob Light. Leave it out till it gets warm and flat. Fill the bottle back up with seltzer water and chill. That'd probably be pretty close to Dos Equis. The weakest tasting beer I've ever had. It tastes even weaker than Coors Light or Miller Lite. Though it still compares favorably to Coors Light because at least what little flavor it had wasn't bad and I can tell there's some alcohol in it."
"Enjoyable and certainly a good option to pair with spicy Mexican food."
"With that being said it isn't something that I would buy and take home or would order if I was just hanging out in a watering hole. It is good for what it is and that is a companion to Mexican food."
"Overall, not a very fun beer. I'll take Sam Adams any day."
"A light brown beer with hints of red. It has a slightly roasty and sweet smell, with a roasted grain and caramel flavor. It also had a bit of a chemical note on the finish. Definitely thin in the body, but maybe I'm just a little too used to the heavier bodied Oktoberfest beers. Overall, this beer is just a little too muted both flavor and aroma wise to be anything more than average."
"Not as ""good"" as Sam Adams Boston Lager but overall I think I'd rather drink this stuff if I had to choose (price pending)."
"Pouring into a glass provides a nice, two finger fluffy head that quickly settles with almost no lacing. The color is amber, almost root beery. Little smell. What's there is mostly clean lager smell; slightly sweet/toasty. Taste is similar to Sam Adams and other Vienna lagers, but with almost no bitterness. It's slightly sweeter. Mouthfeel and drinkability is fine, nothing special. As the temp rose, some off flavors began to show. Went ok with my slice of pizza! Not really great, but it does have some interesting flavor at least."
"Overall: A good brew to enjoy with Mexican food."
"another vienna lager from mexico, brewer country in latin america rich in this beer style, this beer is exceptional but not over negra modelo, servin type in bottles and in nitro tap, is popular in the waist of my country, but since the fusion of great breweries Cuauhtemoc and Moctezuma, are distributed and enjoyed across the country, not sold like his sister XX lager (The Gren bottle) is powerfull in its drinkability and smell lilke a real vienna lager ancient heritage of the veracruzans brewemasters."
"Everything about this beer was average imo. If we were rating based on country this beer would be like a 4/4.5 but within its style its aveage to slightly below average. A little too sweet for my liking, the toasted nutty base character isn't as strong as I would like and the hops were very weak. The finish is a bit sulfuric and really kills this beers chances of being good. With that being said, the malty flavors were enjoyable and the thickness of this beer was nice. Average beer here, not worth the price, and I'd get a Bohemia over this any day when at a Mexican restaurant, but its not the worst option either."
"The taste is crisp and malty. The hops are barely there. The mouthfeel is sorta creamy and carbonatedely crisp to the tounge.This is nothing special but it is the most drinkable thing i have had out of mexico. The price makes it pointless for me to buy though as there are much more enjoyable brews out there. So yeah...Mehh. Not bad but not impressive, i don't need it and i don't really want to drink my last 5."
"Drinkable? Sure. I just dont want to here this beer is good with Mexican food. Give me a break. It might be the best thing on most Mexican restaurants, that doesnt mean you need to drink beer with dinner. I say skip this beer, it really isnt that good. I purchased my bottle in Omaha."
"Drinks OK and useful to wash down hot-spicy food but otherwise, unremarkeable."
"Well, nothing special to say about it. IT is like the other lager beers, but a little more bitter. One of the elderest beers in Mexico, perhaps. Hops are obviuosly there, although with a little foam. The taste is ok for a while, but it is easy to get tired of it."
"Drinkability: From most of the Mexican beers (lagers) this one will be had again"
"M: Light-to-moderate. The use of corn sugar adjunct has lightened the body, making it a nice summer drinker... though I'd prefer a little more malt flavour."
"The beer itself had a solid, and recognizable flavor a Vienna Lager. It finished with some bitterness. The taste was surprising, but not astonishing. The style was recognizable, but a watery rendition of what I had hoped would come of it. It's a very drinkable beer though, but because of it's light mouthfeel and accessable and ""not bad"" flavor, not because it is a very superior brew. In my opinion, Negra Modelo is still the best Mexican lager I've tried, and one of the best Vienna Lagers I've had yet. This one, although better than the standard Dos Equis, is nothing to write home about. A nice beer to have on occasion if the mood will strike me, which it might, but nothing to go clamoring make a Beer trade for."
"Drinkability: Pretty smooth considering what it is. There's enough taste to make it worh drinking, but it won't overpower even a taco salad."
"Far superior to the standard lager, this is actually a fairly respectable, tasty brew. I had mine in a huge frosted mug and it paired perfectly with my spicy Mexican food. Appearance is a nice, deep amber and the taste, while not fierce in the least, does have a nice refreshing, well balanced flavor. I wouldn't impress anyone with this beer but it did the job and I respect it for that."
"Orange-amber color with a decend lace for a head. The aroma is a roasted malt and thin spicy hop. Medium-light body and moderate amount of carbonation. Roasted malts and grains dominate the flavor. A small amount of hoppy spice can be detected. Dry kind of sweet finish. Overall a slighty above average amber lager. Not something I would buy on a regular basis, but always a favorite when eating mexican cuisine."
"Pours a light golden color. No head to speak of, and little lace.Lots of carbonation. Taste was not bad. Light,but desent flavor. Has a fizzy feel that I did not mind. All in all not a bad beer. I would buy it again. Give it a try if you get a chance.."
"I think its a decent beer, very drinkable but thats it. Very average. Good for casual drinking with friends, or pairing it with mexican food."
"Pours crystal clear bronze. Soapy one-finger head, lacking retention almost no lacing. The nose is pretty clean, some vienna and dextrin malt aromas, but not much in the way of hops. Sweet munich flavor upfront, which becomes more like karo syrup in the aftertaste. Pilsener spiciness is suggested at, but the taste is mostly bland. Perle or Hallartau hops are mild but present a good balance. Light bodied and highly carbonated, this has a rather thin mouthfeel for the style, but a high drinkability. This beer is well-suited to warm weather and mexican quisine, but Vienna lovers will be dissapointed."
"Never had this...you would think that I would have at some point, but it just has never appealed to me until...I got a free bottle from a friend. Pours out to a crystal clear copper, forming a modest off-white head with poor retention and absent lacing. Carbonation is medium. The aroma is of herbal English hops with caramel and mild toast. Not really my cup of tea although it's not bad for a macro. Mouthfeel is zingy with a light body and crisp finish. If I close my eyes, this tastes like a mix between any domestic big 3 continental lager and a german big three dark lager. The result....boring. Bitterness is mild. Finish has a touch of caramel sweetness. No discernable toast. I have no interest in drinking this again."
"Appearance is reddish brown with beige foam and lace that hangs around for a while. The aroma consists of roasted grain, malt and minimal hops. Initial taste is clean and dry, with a hint of bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and pleasant. Superior to most other Mexican imported beers. Goes well with your favorite Mexican food."
"one finger of head on top of a darkish amber brew. the head quickly drops to a thin layer, but retains to the bottom of glass. decent lace. smells of mostly malt with a hint of corn, maybe a little hop smell. smell is fairly faint. tastes mild, toasted malt mostly. fair body, a little thin for my taste. most definately one of the best mexican beers i've had."
"A very decent brew especially when paired with Carne Asada and a cheese enchilada. Very drinkable for a lower priced beer."
"Well for an adjunct german knock-off, this is not bad. It has a decent amber color and a white head. Smells a tad skunky but I think it is more the adjuncts I smell as most adjunct beer smell like this too me. It has a very clean even taste there is a decent hop presence but not a desercnable flavor. It has a good body and is easily drinkable and forgetable."
"Had one at the Santa Fe in Hilton Head, SC. Pours a very nice dark amber color with just a little head. Aroma is of faint roastd malt with just a hint of hops. Just a hint of bitterness with a good, smooth sweet malt finish. Considering everyone around me was drinking Corona, I made the best choice."
"Poured a light amber, crystalline clear, no head whatsoever. I couldn't smell a darn thing really, perhaps a bit of citrus/acid but that's it. Malty and dry across the tongue with not discernable finish. It was carbonated just right but left something akin to battery taste on my tongue for minutes. It was easy all around though so it was another summer-easy drink but nothing special."
"It's also typically cheaper than both."
"It's ok, dog."
"Drinkability: Great with red meats or just to sit in a hot afternoon and relax."
"Decided to stop being such a butthole and give Mexican beer a chance while out for lunch one day, had this with a veggie burrito. Rather dark body, darker than I expected, a rusty/copper color, with a head that lingered. Smelled of faint malt and clean hops, slight citrus. Light body, tasted the light malt and was impressed by the moderation of the hops which made everything extremely crisp and drinkable. Not by any means the best beer, but one that I enjoyed nonetheless. I'd probably get this again on tap with some veggie burritos."
"This beer pours a brilliantly clear, brown-amber color with frothy tan head. The aroma has notes of grain, caramel, and a hint of herbal hops. The taste is lightly sweet up front, and this sweetness actually holds up throughout the beer. There is a hint of bitterness in the finish as well as some light astringency. A pretty simplistic beer that has a nice caramel note it, though it does have a distracting astringency/ vegetal character to it that I don't find all that good. In the end though this is not nearly as flavorless as I was expecting it to be."
"Not a bad beer at all. I highly recommend pairing it with spicy foods or barbecue. Good finish, good mouthfeel. Right carbonation level. Order one up the next time you go out for some Tex-Mex eatin'."
"Poured a great dark amber color, with nice 1"" tight off-white head with slow lace. Nose was light, floral, sweet. Tongue was even, some body, but largely uneventful. Very little or no hops. Swallow was a slightly bitter version of the tongue. This is a tough call. I would drink it again, but would try something else if it were an option."
"Overall-a nice stab at a Vienna by this Mexican brand, far better than other Mexican beers currently running over the U.S. market and a fine beer on its own. Give this a shot."
"Drinkability is pretty good, because it is very easy drinking- this is not a great beer, but is a preferred alternative (more body, more flavor) to most of the fizzy yellow Mexican beers found in most Mexican restaurants."
"I enjoyed the beer and would have had another poured with more head than the bartend did with this one, but the goblet was 25 oz. (!) and I was quite good where I was. Remembering back to a bottled version of the primary Dos Equis lager, this one is much better. Will try on tap on more occasions to verify quality."
"Drinkability: I couldn't even finish my pint it was so insipid"
"Notes: If you want Mexican beer, go with Negra Modelo. It's more flavorful than Corona, and not skunky at all."
"I got my moneys worth, but there is nothing to write home about."
"I haven't had one in years, so I was pretty excited to order one at a mexican restaurant the other day. The problem is, my tastebuds have matured and become a little more sophisticated since the last time I had a ""Dos"" as we used to call them. Same, pretty, light brown color, virtually no head as it arrived at my table. Mild toasty malt aroma, everything's fine so far. Then I had to taste it, watery and fizzy are the two best adjectives that come to mind, I thought it was like Bud with a couple drops of brown coloring in it. Drinkable on a hot day of course, but now that SA is it's competitor in the Vienna/Amber lager category...""fugettaboutit"""
"Not bad. I don't recall if I've ever had the amber, but it's superior to the ordinary Dos Equis. It even has a touch of character."
"I had this beer poured from a bottle in a Mexican restaurant in Arizona. Its a reddish amber liquid with a nice, thick, firm white head. Theres a toasted, bready malt aroma, with a touch of hops. The taste is slightly sweet, clean, and has a notable malt presence. The beer dries out a little in the finish, which has a good hop balance. This is a respectable, drinkable, surprisingly malty brew."
"Not bad for this country. That is drinkable with some taste. Nice foam in pour and amber colour. Works as a Vienna. Smooth drink with significant malt. Light mouthfeel, mild bitter aftertaste. Would work with spicy food. From broken sixpacks at LCBO."
"Drinkability: A very easy drinker, nothing extraordinary here, but it's still good. A definite departure from most Mexican beers I have had. Miles apart from the adjunct lagers that are normally available from Mexico. If it is necessary to consume a Mexican lager, I would recommend to give this a try."
"Brew pours to an amber color and is very clear. Has a white head that breaks down very quickly and leaves very little lacing around the glass. The aroma is ok, grainy with a malt flavor, not to bad for a Mexican beer. Taste is pretty good, highlights of malt and a little citrus twang with a nice amount of carbonation. Not a overly interesting brew but better than other Mexican brews I have had. This is a beer that I could drink more heavily on a warm summer day while in the sun."
"This is a passable lager, definitely better than north american macro lagers but not without NA macro flaws. Its like a corny macro lager with some roasty nutty specialty malts put in it."
"Poured clear and amber with a slight cap of froth. Smelled hints of grain maybe citrus but a definite floral tone. Taste wasn't bad at all. Hops are detected but faint. Some grain, maybe a small hint of lemon, nothing over the top but worthy of a second if handed to me. I could do this again if another selection wasn't available. Maybe the next time I go the local authentic Mexican eatery."
"Had this at Hernando's Hideaway in Toronto. It came in a really cool hand-made looking glass with a tinted rim. It was a nice amber colour with an off-white head that laced well. Smell, well it was almost non-existant, but at least it didn't smell all skunky like Corona, a bit of faint hops. Taste was rather good, some malts and a bit of hops on the finish, but not too many favours or too much of it, but it was really good with the Mexican meal. It has a nice light mouthfeel that goes well with the spiciness of Mexican food too. I found it very drinkable despite its shortcomings, and it definitely it the best Mexican beer I have tried so far."
"Big foamy almost creamy-looking head from an aggressive pour. Head lasts for a bit and is followed by very subtle lacing. Color is a clear dark golden honey shade. Not quite amber in my opinion. Smell is hardly detectable, but is malty and slighty fruity. First taste is light, but starts off with a good malty quality and finishes with just a hint of bitter. It doesn't really excite my tastebuds beyond that. Mouthfeel is light and watery. This beer isn't horrible, but I think it needs to be teamed up with some good spicy food because alone it really isn't that exciting."
"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. About your typical Mexican beer. Poured a medium copper-amber color with a small head and maybe the slightest of lace. Smelled like a combo of corn and malt. Very light carbonation, but not super watery like some of the others. Maybe a tinge of sweetness? Went down pretty easy. A decent beer for a hot day on the beach. Would have others above it though (while in Cancun)."
"Thin in body, but flavorful, especially for a national import. A little over-carbonated for my tastes. There's also a touch of aluminum in the flavor and aftertaste. Quaffable, certainly the more flavorful choice against the other mass-marketed beers of the world."
"It was medium bodies with decent mouthfeel. I would have again if I had limited options, not bad when compared to american macros."
"Skip it an look for something better."
"Tried a small glass at the Goose Island Oktoberfest ""Beer Academy"" - pours a very clearn, medium brown color with small amounts of white foam. There's a light malt scent, but nothing overpowering. The taste is also very light, with citrusy hops and an odd vegetable flavor in the background. The mouthfeel is nicely crisp, but after a few sips that green hop/veggie flavor starts to get a bit annoying and unpleasant."
"When poured it had nice amber color with very little foam. That was the best of this beer. The smell of any spices or hops were not evident and the taste was very flat, with no flavor what so ever. Will NEVER waste my money or time drinking this amber ale!"
"Not one I would go out of my way to get, except at a Mexican restaurant. But better than the Special Lager."
"This beer is a very clear amber color with a thick white head. Moderate head retention with minimal lacing. Smell is malty. Taste also has a mild malt flavor. Body is medium. A good beer to have with a mexican entree but otherwise there is better beer out there."
"This ale pours a clean amber with a bubbly of white head. Has a grainy slightly sweet aroma. Nothing that really jumps out at you. There was alight hop sharpness at the begining of the taste. With alittle sweetness in the middle and a very light finish. Drinkable, yes. Do I want it more, no."
"I may still order Dos Equis Amber Lager on occasion to wash down my enchiladas. Otherwise... never. I've had worse Mexican beer, but that doesn't mean that Dos Equis is anything to celebrate."
"Thin body but nice carbonation, and I had no problem downing a couple big ass glasses off it during the course of a meal."
"Decent Mexican beer. Poured from the jug a darker amber colour with a bit of red tinge. Heavy, one finger head that lasted and lasted. Bit of a curtain lace on the glass. Sweet, light malty smell. Bit of sugar as well and some pepper(?). Again, sweet malty taste. Didn't detect any pepper, though. For a lighter taste, this has a bit of a heavy mouthfeel. Creamy and thick. Highly drinkable, considering a few of us had 5 jugs of it."
"I bought this because I like a well made Vienna and Im on a search to find one I like....so far its Eliot Ness but I cant get this in Canada and St. Andre is too bitter and weak. This is a revisiting of Dos Equis after having being bored with it some years ago. The pour reveals a red-amber beer with a smallish off white cap that goes to a ring quickly. Aromas of sweet malt and cinnamon...very subdued.The start is sharp then mellows as the sweet malts mix with the spicy tastes and tart hops...the malt is pronounced and has a layer of spicyness in balance with the hops....finish is clean and slightly dry with a malt aftertaste...For now I will grab a DE-XX if I feel the need for a vienna"
"Managed to sneak this one into the Festval of Beers in Brisbane, but after i tasted i wondered why i even bothered, very bad. Amber-red colour. Zero head retention. Sweet toffee and plastic, watery. They obviously used corn in this one, almost as bad as the regular Dos Equis."
"Has this on-tap in a 23oz tall glass. This came out with a copper body and a tan head that goes away fairly quickly leaving a slight amount of lace around the glass. The aroma is sweet with a good amount of malt to and a touch of hops can be detected as this warmed up. Taste is crisp and clean with malt and grain being the main contributors. There is also a slight sweetness and bitterness in this as well. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but not too bad and it is adequately carbonated. This is very drinkable and refreshing to have with a Mexican dinner. Definitely my favorite beer to come out of Mexico."
"-Oelergud"
"I generally prefer lighter, hoppier, pilsner-style lagers, but as far as darker lagers go, this is one of my favorite widely available beers. Seems like it would be perfect to drink outside on a hot summer day, unlike many similar beers. Quality/price ratio is pretty good; I'm sure this won't be the last one I buy."
"Tap: Clear amber colored beer with a thick bubbly head with average retention. Aroma is quite sweet with some weak malt also noticeable. Taste is quite pleasant with again some sweetness and a bit of malt that can be notice. Very refreshing while drank on a patio of a Mexican/tex-mex restaurant. Much more enjoyable then Corona or Sol but by no mean is it a complex or extreme beer."
"Slightly fruity w/ mild hoppy aftertaste. Decent for what it is, but not an everyday beer, or anything to get excited about."
"Drinkabity: Let's just say I wouldn't turn one of these down if one was offered. I won't make a point ot buy more, but it's not bad. A shade better than average."
"Its head lasts a little longer than most macros, its color is darker, it has more malt presence and body, but in the end it is still not something I can imagine wanting to drink. It must be that momentary caramel sweetness that helps it sell. There is just not much there, and it has a bad finish. Not recommended."
"The color is red brown. Served with a small head that left some lacing. Smell was slightly sweet. Taste was very smooth, a hint of sweetness, and not much of a noticeable hop characteristic. Mouthfeel was a bit thin. Not a bad beer, one of the top Mexican lagers. Will drink this again if there are not other more interesting choices available at a Mexican restaurant."
"Had a pint of this on tap at a Mexican bar and restaurant. The beer pours an amber color with a big white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is one of grain and hops. The flavor is malty with a hint of hops bitterness. It is refreshing and clean in the mouth and lead to drinking a couple. This one doesn't need the lime."
"Another old friend. Always reliable. This is the only beer I actually like with a lime. I've also only drank it out of the bottle, so I am not too sure of what it looks like. It is slightly hoppy, with a slight bitterness to it. But the lime makes it a citrusy sour, which is great on a hot day. Plus, it makes you pucker up a bit and want to drink more. A couple of these on a hot day always help cool me off."
"This beer pours a nice deep amber color with about 1 finger of head that quickly deteriorates into only a thin ring. There is Hardly any lace on the side of the glass. The auroma of this beer is mainly of roasted malts and not much else. The taste very much mirrors the smell of this beer. Malt and not much else. Its not a strong malt, but very little of the hops gets noticed. Not watery, but not overly malty. This is by far the best beer to come from south of the border. On a hot summer day, drinking many of these would not be a problem."
"Dos Equis Amber tastes very closely to AB's Texas-only beer Ziegenbock, I think Amber wins by a nose. Both beers are well worth drinking as session beers and have similiar pricing."
"I picked this up in a 12oz bottle. No freshness date to be found (supspicion might have had a bad bottle). Pours a brown copper color with little to no head, lacing was minimal with each gulp. Smell was fainly of malt with an alcohol twist. Grain bringing up rear. Taste was very skunk and to bitter, not a good balance of hops and malts at all. Very dry amber and flat. Light bodies amber for sure. I would never drink this again, even though I think I might have had a an over dated beer. Pass on this amber, better ambers out there."
"I had this on tap at Don Pablos. It took them three tries to get through their thick skulls that I did not want a lime wedge stuck on the lip of the schooner. Once they did, I was plesantly surprised. I've had this several times, but I'd never really turned a critical eye to it before. The malt sweetness and carbonation combone to make this a drinkable and refreshing beverage. As far as Mexican beers, this currently occupies the top spot for me. They go down very easy, and are a fine accompaniment for the standard tex-Mex fare you get in my neck of the woods. I might not buy this one off the shelf, but at dinner, with some Black Angus fajitas, this one is always welcome. But minus that damned lime!"
"Sampled 2/6/04"
"A clear amber pour with a nice head. The nose is very mild...light fuitiness takes some shape. The taste overall is bland. Almost no hoppiness. Malts are sublte if not hidden. There seems to be a pinch of citrusy sweetness on the finish but that fades quite fast. A light bodied beer with a decent mouthfeel. An easy drinker but little in the way of interesting qualities."
"Amber brown color. The head was very thin and disappeared very quicly. I didn't find anything particular in the smell. The taste is malty, a nice combination of caramel and red fruits, but without the sweetness. The carbonation is weak. Hops are pretty much hidden. A decent lager."
"chestnut brown with foamy white head that quickly vanishes. mildly sweet grain aroma and nothing else. aggresive carbonation makes this beer bubbly and sharp. mild vienna malt flavor and a detectable macro corn-syrup sweetness. kiss of the lightest, most non-aggresive hops in the end. finishes clean and the aftertaste isn't all that bad. overall, a better than average macro that i can stomach at chain mexican restaurants."
"This was a pretty good mexican beer. It poured a dark brownish color with a thin fizzy head that faded quickly. The smell was strong on grain and malt. The taste was pretty decent with good malt flavors and a touch of hops. Although the taste was dominated by grain it was a smoothe flavor that went very well with the chips and salsa I had. A good mexican brew to get if it is offered."
"Well, an amber Mexican beer would be a step up from the average yellow lagers that are on the market, or so at least I used to think so in theory. This XX Amber pours out a decent looking clear roasted amber colour, very little head to speak of with no retention at all. It has a faint roasted malt aroma, more on the grainy/husky side. Flavour is very mild and light, hints of roasted malt and metallic grain, and something of a trace of floral hops. Aftertaste reminded me of what chewing on a shoe lace might taste like, and I couldn't drop that sentiment after the first few sips. Watery mouthfeel, it is easy enough to drink, but that aftertaste ruins it for me. This would be a beer that would have to be paired with something or other, preferably spiced food."
"Hadn't had the amber version of Dos Equis, so I gave it a try. Pours the expected amber color with a small head and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is pretty plain, but there is a little maltiness to it. The flavor is a little bland as well, but not bad. Kinda weak. There is a little maltiness in the flavor with possibly some caramel as well. Pretty well done for a south of the border beer, but not spectacular either."
"Poured a decent enough amber brown color with no head to speak of.Not much aroma-your basic beer smell Id say.Slight malt flavor and no real discernable hop bitterness to it.Very slight caramel or toffee flavor.Nice smooth body but again nothing special.Overall an ok choice to go with your Mexican meal-sure beats a Corona or a sharp stick in the eye.Seems to be a bit ""brighter"" when I have had it in a bottle-might be dirty lines or something similar here."
"It really is a nice amber color in the bottle. That's about where the good comments end. Has a very harsh taste; I guess that's the corn or rice or whatever. Little tinge of alcohol which makes it slightly more palatable, but I'd only drink this from a pitcher at a Mexican restaurant in the future. 20% less harsh with the addition of that forbidden fruit, the lemon. Best thing I can say: at least it's not MGD."
"The Dos Equis Amber poured a clear copper with a fizzy head that quickly disappeared. It has a sweetish, starchy malt aroma with some slight fruity hints. Like the regular Dos Equis, it is thin and watery. It tastes a little better though. The taste is mostly sweet malts and some caramel hints. It has a kind of skunky, metallic finish though. Overall, it's better than regular Dos Equis and at the upper end of macros...still not something I would get again, unless choices were very slim."
"Not exactly a world classic, but something that goes well with Mexican food, and that's all you can really ask. A much better choice than Corona, and one that I'd enjoy again the next time I do eat Mexican."
"Fizzy head to top of this brownish amber lager. The aroma is of faint hops and a floral hints. Taste is a crisp fruity taste with hints of grains. Very sweet malts and an almost sugar character without being overdone. The hops are present but nothing too strong. Carbonation plays a nice role and the aftertaste is very sweet. This is am easy to drink lager and pairs well with a mexican dish. Would be a real treat in the summertime. Again this is a quality lager."
"Pours amber (duh) with a small head that quickly dissapated. Smells slightly sweet with a slight citrus element. Medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Slight citrus flavoring with little aftertaste. Decent mexican beer, good with enchiladas but wouldn't drink alone."
"Nose is all malt. Flavor starts as all malt sweetness, then evolves into some breadyness,yeast,and caramel notes. Mild hopping. I remember when this was ""the good stuff"". This is a refreshing and decent quality brew. Works in a pinch when only macros are available."
"Except for looking reasonably good, this beer doesn't seem to put forward much of an effort. Inoffensive, but uninspiring. Good to wash down a sandwich with."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is decent. It smells of pale and light crystal malts with that lager yeast zing. The taste is good. It is refreshing with a light maltiness and some bitter hops. It's a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking Mexican lager."
"Reddish amber in color with a small head that is gone before I know it. A few malt hints in the smell. I also pick up something metallic as well. Immediately after I try this beer I an suprised how low the carbonation is. I am not sure if this is how all bottles are or not. The flavor is even weeker than the smell. It kind of reminds me of Newcastle for some reason but not as sweet. Very easy drinking but lacking in flavor."
"No born on or best by date, so you are taking your chances with this one. The body is amber in its truest form. Off-white head that is thin but tall in the beginning and then quickly disappears to a lace that lingers around till about half way though the beer. Smell is better than I expected from a Mexican import. It is sweet and a little grainy. Very nice to the nose. Taste was very clean and crisp though not much flavor. Not very hoppy. Some malt but not much. Very mellow. Only distinct favors I could pick out were maybe some orange and some corn. A smokey aftertaste. It's a tad bit on the watery side. I think this beer would be very good with spicy Mexican food. It acts as a pretty good thirst quencher. Medium to high carbonation though the mouthfeel is still pretty smooth. There is also a little bit of creaminess to the beer. Over all a very very easy drinking beer."
"This is a decent mexican amber beer. I drank it straight from the bottle, but it does have a nice light amber colour and a small white head. Aromas are of slightly sweet, bready malts and very background floaral hops. The taste is very sweet, bready and malty with a nice, sweet, floral hop after-bite. The mouthfeel is thin but not too thin for this style and the drinkability is damn good for a Mexican beer. Decent."
"It pours an impressive dark body with a strong yet pleasent nose. The taste is crisp and inviting with none of the brackish after taste that you get sometimes."
"Dos Equis impressed me after all these years and would be a nice session beer. Would go nice with your typical bar food."
"i had this with chorizo enchiladas, and was a great compliment to the spiciness of the sausage. definately a dinner beer thats to be consumed with food from its home country. not a world beater, tho i did rather enjoy it over the meal and would drink it again next time im having mexican food."
"Prost"
"Overall, a real bummer of a brew."
"Minimal head and a sour maltiness are the first things noticed in this one. Light bodied and fairly lean in the mouth with a tangy malted twang. Quite carbonated-not a lot of flavor and even a bit dilute. However, this is a sound choice if you can't find Bohemia at your next Mexican feast."
"Mouth feel was good... pretty malty, definitely not watery."
"Pours a brownish amber colour with little or no head ( this could be due to the freezing mug it was served in-despite my request.) At first no smell, but once it warmed there was a bit off malt on the nose, but not much else. The taste was OK. It had a balance of slightly toasted maltyness with just enough hops to keep it dry. Overall one of my favourite mexican beers. I will have it when i go out to eat mexican food, or at some sort of Fiesta, but i wouldnt go out and buy it for a session beer any time soon."
"Drinkability: Not the worst beer I've ever had, but overall rather bland and uninteresting. Drink it if you're handed one, but I can think of a lot of things I'd rather be drinking."
"Two ways to describe this: Better than Corona, not as good as Carta Blanca. Basically, a somewhat flat lager, nothing exceptional about it. I tried it one night after dinner, and I got the same impression from this beer, as other mexican brews, although I think XX had a bit more alcohol. This was yet another below- average beer. Save the dinero and buy Americano. Or Carta Blanca."
"Drinkability  Not the tastiest beer in the world, but fine for a hot summer day."
"Overall, not too bad a beer. Pretty average, in fact. Does a good job of smothering some spicy Mexican food. Not a beer I'm going to stock my fridge with, though."
"Dark amber color, small head. Vienna style lager, slightly caramelized malts, slightly hoppy. Mouthfeel is slightly malty. Balance is OK. Flavor is mild, but acceptable. Mouthfeel is very thin, sort of watery. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This is better than most Mexican beers. It pours a medium to dark amber/brown. It has no nose at all that I could detect. (which is better than smelling like an American Macro). The taste begins sort of mellow and finishes out on the back of the tongue with some uninteresting maltiness balanced out with some bittering hops. Not much of a head. It's ok at ChiChi's if there's nothing else there."
"Not a very drinkable beer in my opinion its to watery and yet is harsh..worse than I expected."
"Very smooth, crisp, clean taste with the dominate flavor of dry malt. Medium body that finishes with a slight hop and mineral taste. Goes down very smooth, and very easy. One of the top selections of Mexican beers available at nearly every Mexican restaurant. Pairs well with the food and much better than the other XX offering and head and way above a Corona."
"XX Amber is way ahead of XX Special Lager in the flavor department, but lacks the character of Negra Modelo. This stuff is easy to drink and might be a wise selection at a Mexican eatery."
"Not much to report. I might drink another one if offered. I would never buy it."
"Nothing too exciting going on here. Pours a dark amber color with a medium and foamy light beige head. Aroma of light malt. Rather light-bodied with very little flavor. Lightly sweet finish. My money is on Negra Modelo or Victoria over this any day as far as Mexican Viennas go."
"In a word: unobtrusive."
"I had this at a local Mexican Restaurant with some enchiladas and tacos. Pours an amber color topped off by a tiny head that settles down very quickly. The aroma is malty with mild hops, caramel, and fruit undertones. The taste is like any other average run of the mill Vienna lager. The carbonation level is a bit too high for this style of beer. Even though I didnt really care much for this one its still better than Corona."
"Pours from the bottle a dark amber, with a pretty large light tan head that quickly diminished to leave a minimal lacing. Aroma was quite light, mostly sweet (corn?), with some toasted smell hinting in the back. Flavor is almost purely sweet, like corn and caramel mixed, again there was some toasty malt flavors hinting at the end. Quite watery and overly carbonated."
"A good solid beer with the desire to please. Decent dark lager coloration with a small, non-retentive head. Minimal lacing. The taste and smell are of grain. Enough hop sense to moderate the malt sweetness. This is a good beer with Mexican food as it blends well with tortillas and quenches the spices that are present. This is a good go-to beer in many seetings where macros predominate."
"Pours brownish/amber, with little head that thins out to leave a ring around your pint glass. Slight malt aroma but not strong. Smooth taste some malt, slight carbonation easy to drink. Not a bad tasting lager. Better than Corona and its lighter relative Dos X."
"Pours somewhat dark with an indifferent head. The smell is of grains, mostly corn. Taste is smooth. The hops are there, just not jumping out at you. Malt is weak. You get a strong taste of grain in this, not as bad as some, but you wish there was more malt. This is better than Corona, that's not saying much. Still, worth a try if your at a nice Mexican bistro."
"All in all, this is a good beer to be served with chips, salsa and Texas cheese enchiladas."
"A clear, darkish amber pour with minimal had and almost no lacing. Generally put, this is an inoffensive beer, but hardly a noteworthy one. Smell is dominated by grains with bready and floral notes less prominent. Taste starts out clean and crisp, moving quickly to a bready middle and a sweet, malty finish. Mouthfeel is rather sticky with the aftertaste flavors clinging a bit."
"Pours dark amber in color with a thin white head that immediately fades into a thin lace. Nose is lightly toasted sweet malts and grains with a touch of spicy hops. Taste is sweet and crisp up front followed by some malty and bready notes. Mildy bitter hops are present in a dry finish. One of the better lagers from Mexico. Goes great with a plate of spicy Tex-Mex."
"Very nice little brew from our neighbors down south. Has nice color to it and a little head to it as well. Finishes smooth and leaves you wanting more. Has a little bite to the first taste. I like it almost as much as Bohemia and Negra Modelo. Darn good for the price too, I think it's like $6 a sixer, which is good for a good beer."
"The colour however was nice, a very deep amber with a large island lace and thick glass ring."
"Pours a decent amber hue with a white head, not a bad beer. Not exactly like the other vienna lagers I have tried. More along the lines of a traditional american lager with a little bit of extra malt. If I have one of these in my hand you know I am enjoying some mexican food; which it pairs well with."
"The pour a cloudless amber gold color, the head modest and the lace sufficient to coat the glass, nose is all malt, crisp and fresh, front lightly sweet with a slender top. Finish is quite acidic, the hops adequate and the aftertaste dry. As I said before, a good drinking beer that is pleasant to the palate and always acceptable to me."
"Pours a deep amber under a nice sticky head. Toasty metal grass nose. Well-balanced through a draught although somewhat of a contrived sweetness lingers along with the mild hops. Clean and quenching and a fine choice for washing down some tasty chilaquiles."
"Usually I am not a big fan of Mexican beers but this one definitely stands out from the crowd. It pours a rich amber color with a very weak head that fades to alomst nothing within a minute. It has a light aroma consisting mostly of hops. There is minimal bitterness and the taste is not at all complex like the smell, but you can percieve hints of caramel. The mouthfeel is alright. There is a slight carbonation fizz and it is tad bit watery. It is very drinkable though. It is smooth and goes down quite easy. While although I gave this brew a kind of average review I do enjoy it quite a bit and will surely purchase it again in the future. Plus, this is my favorite beer to drink with Mexican food."
"Pours an amber colour with topped by a poor head that settles down quiyte easily. The aroma is malty and light hints of fruits. Flavor nothing special really. I wouldn't look for this beer again. Carbonation is quite poor and mouthfeel is average. I haven't discovered a decent Mexican Lager yet and this Vienna Style Lager won't make me change my opinion"
"The flavor of most Mexican lagers fails to impress me, but Dos Equis is a nice selection.  Pairs naturally with Mexican food (tried it with fajitas), spicy dishes and pizza.  Flavor of the beer doesn't compete with food, but instead refreshes the palette."
"This is one of the better Mexican lagers.  Definately a refreshing brew to pair with a Mexican meal.  I like this one better then the special.  It has a good flavor for a mexican born brew.  Nice dark color and aroma from the bottle.  The lime helps but is not necessary.  I would order if it was available at a restaurant."
"Clear amber with a thin lacy head which almost dissapears.  Malty aroma... biscuity and somewhat fruity smelling.  Flavor is not overly complex, but has a slightly sweet breadlike flavor.  Medium thin body, with medium carbonation.  This is one of the better Mexican lagers, and a decent Vienna Lager.  Definately a refreshing brew to pair with a Mexican meal."
"More starchy tropical fruit smell here, like underripe bananas, mangos etc. A hint of caramel appears. What does one say about something so ""average?"" I could imagine a context where this beer would be welcomed for its simple warmth, hydrating qualities (It is very watery) and lovely brownish amber color. Think of it like industrial 70s and 80s music. (Abba, Barry Manilow, Hall and Oats...) Repetition would not be kind."
"A nice dark amber/cooper color brew. Alittle higher in carbonation makes the head appear fizzy with medium-low lace. The taste has some bite. A balance of more hop over malt. I agree it goes well with mexican food. I thought it brought out the corn flavors very well. I was alittle scared of a mexican brew. This was given by a friend and thankfully-so.I'll get some for such dinning."
"Notes: One of the better lagers to be imported from Mexico and a better pick from mass-produced American amber lagers like Michelob Amber Bock and the like though pale in compairison to some of the more flavourful Vienna Style Lagers. Pairs well with mild bean or chicken burritos covered with Monterey Jack cheese."
"Pours a dark tea color with a very small head that dissipated rather quickly.  The smell and flavor is rather mild that goes nicely with Mexican food.  It is a very smooth and very drinkable beer.  Has a very mild hop taste.  I liked this better personally than it's brother Bohemia.  I could drink a few of these without that ""high and dry"" feel that Bohemia has.  Salud!"
"That I even had this to be able to post a review is surprising. Went out to a Mexican food dinner and Suzanne wanted a beer. I was going the water route until she mentioned this. Anyway that this was the obvious choice gives you an idea of what was being offered.  It arrived with a chilled Miller Light glass (geez) after letting the glass thaw a bit I poured it. Appearance is surprisingly good and lacing was decent. Sweetish flavor but essentially flavorless at the same time. Not my favorite but much better than your average adjunct riddled offering from south of the border."
"Bottle at Cantina dos amigos......About average on every category. Poured dark amber/copper to brown color. Nothing real noticable smell wise. Lots of carbonation bubbles, easy to drink with Mexican food. Some faint malt taste, not much. Very thin, watery feel. I would have it over a Corona at a Mexican place."
"Okay, this is a beer that I will have at one of my mexican hangouts.  While I usually opt for Negro, this is the one I will pick over Corona.  It arrives as a light copper color with a good head.  It's hard to judge a lace as it was served quite cold.  A nice hops taste when compared to other mexican beers of this style.  Light taste, but indicative of style.  I would order this over Corona if you don't want a Negro style."
"Medium copper/amber in color.  Good head, and nice legs.  Smells is somewhat grainy with a hint of floral hops.  Very drinkable with slight malt taste and smooth adjunct mouthfeel.  Slightly hoppy, but not floral enough.  As the MAN said, drink this with mexican foos."
"Lovely dark copper color with a prominent off-white head that fades, but remains to the end and a thick curtain of lace.  Mild malt, grain, and hop aromas.  Taste begins with malt, rises towards a pleasant sweetness, finishes rather bitter and dry.  Not bad, but best enjoyed with Southwestern cuisine."
"Bronze in hue w/ excellent clarity.  The head retention is poor and only a thin ring of bubbles is left. Lots of grainy malt notes in aroma at first, but lightly toasted Munich and sweet crystal malt notes follow.  There's a bit of grassy Hersbrucker hop nose there as well.  A bit rough in aroma.  Light and almost thin and high in carbonation.  Malt flavors do manage to assert themselves and are comprised of caramelized sweetness from the combination of crystal and Munich, and / or perhaps a large percentage of Vienna malt in the grist.  Flaked corn sweetness is perceptible as well.  The hop bitterness is mild, but does provide an adequate foundation to the malt.  The use of adjuncts diminishes the malt backbone.  It finishes quite bready and grainy with a touch of sweetness.  Hmm... Dos Equis is a decent brew, but isn't the type to sip and savor.  It really does need to be paired with food."
"This is in the same league as the rest of the Mexican selections in restaurants...a bit more flavor than most...I can actually taste some malt in this."
"For Mexican beers offered in restaurants, this is one of the better ones. It is best on draft. Limes and salt are not necessary. It is decent, but does not have the body or flavor that a Negra Modelo has.  As with other Mexican beers, I recommend it only within the context of the Mexican restaurant; otherwise there are better beers to have."
"Dry, crisp and bland is almost every description of Mexican beer. Dos Equis is no different. Unless you are eating Mexican food I don't see how people can enjoy Mexican beer."
"A very tasty darker lager on draft...I have never had it any other way. It also isn't as watery as the other Mexican beers I have had, so that's a big plus."
"Anyhoo, this was a decent lager.  Nice malt taste (that you'll miss with lime and frosted glass - so, as I noted above, don't let them serve it this way!).  Good compliment to Mesquite steak and enchiladas."
"I love the fact that due to Maxamillian's connection to Austria, that Mexico does a Vienna Lager (history buff, here)...this is a very drinkable, non-agressive malty brew...so, one need not ""wash down"" Mexican food with Corona.  Up here in Minnesota, Schell's does a ton of cold-fermented styles including a great Fire Brick Vienna Lager...Dos Equis can't match the Brick's subtle notes..."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color, with a decent white colored head. On the nose the aroma is of light malt and mild hoppiness. The same story on the palate, a crisp bitterness in the flavor, some what dry. Overall a decent Vienna Styled lager, but nothing to get excited about."
"I had one of these last night at the local Mexican/Creole joint. A barely above average lager, but somehow it goes nicely with enchiladas. If forced to drink Mexican beer, this will do."
"My favorite Mexican beer.  Cools down spicey food without giving in like light beers. It's what  I order when eating Mexican food.  In fact, I once ordered one without eating, and I was not impressed."
"A decent amber lager. Better than some, but mostly just an average beer."
"Nice substantial body, without being heavy.  Great choice with any Mexican dish, and is probably better with food than alone."
