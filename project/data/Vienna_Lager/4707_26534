3.82,13.4,3,3.5,4,4,4,"This was better than the one I had a few years ago. Maybe the the other one was old but it was awful. This one however was pretty tasty and well balanced. A little rough around the edges but in a good way. An excellent session beer that I could drink all night long.","StaveHooks","Aug 18, 2012"

3.63,7.7,3.5,3,4,3,4,"D ~ Good Local, not out of this world. A good session beer that Tastes fresh. The label artwork looks great this year.","chocosushi","Oct 23, 2010"
3.23,-4.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"D: Decent drinker & unoffensive. Just a tad sweet for my taste.","soju6","Oct 01, 2010"
3.9,15.7,4,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Great drinkability, not a perfect Vienna lager, but acquits itself very well. This will go into the fall rotation when ever I can pick this up. was pleasantly suprised by this. This was better than most of the O'Fests/Viennas I've had this fall","russpowell","Sep 05, 2010"
2.4,-28.8,3,3,2,2,2.5,"The look of the beer may be the one thing Choc got right on this one. It is dark and inviting, and despite the sweet smell you get, you could easily mistake a glass of this to be an actual malty Oktoberfest brew by appearance alone. The taste is what destroys this beer though, and that's a pretty important category in my book. The beer contains very little malt, or malt that one can really taste and decipher, and a whole lot of sweetness. With little to no bitterness, the brew actually tastes more like a sweetened ice tea than a Märzen or even a quality lager. This is the worst Choc beer that I've ever consumed. More bite and a lot less sweetness would go a long way towards improving this one.","TylerBGoode","Aug 14, 2010"
2.61,-22.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Hope this was just a bad bottle/batch.","htomsirveaux","Apr 09, 2009"
3.02,-10.4,2.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Some additional lagering time and better fermentation control would go a long way. I won't be picking up another bottle but it's decent enough for a hot summer afternoon spent watching some TV.","bump8628","Mar 20, 2009"
2.58,-23.4,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Poured a dark golden color. Smells like tart apples. Tastes like...tart apples, and a bit metallic. mouthfeel is good though, medium. overall, Its the same flavors that I get from most of the Choc line, that i dont like, tart apples and metal. I really want to love this brewery since its local, but havent found anything yet that I can get excited about....but I will keep searching...","webbcreative","Mar 14, 2009"
1.74,-48.4,3,1.5,1.5,3,1.5,"Drinkability: Pete's Place, along with Siletz and Northwoods is quickly becoming ingrained in my mind as brewery with infection issues. What a shame.","ChainGangGuy","Sep 10, 2008"
2.71,-19.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a clear copper color with a small off-white head that quickly dissipates. Smells of sweet fruits like plums and apricots with some mild floral notes present. First sip is fresh and clean but like other beers from Pete's Place there is just not enough flavor present. The flavor that is there is good....just not enough of it. It is clean and refreshing but nothing special.","ATLbeerDog","Sep 06, 2008"
3.53,4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D-Not my favorite style to begin with but save for the light mouthfeel this one has a nice sour tinged roasted caramel malt flavour...at least enough to hold my interest.","Deuane","Sep 04, 2008"
3.53,4.7,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Overall: This is a pretty solid Vienna lager. I wish more widely available lagers tasted this good.","Stinkypuss","Dec 18, 2007"
3.65,8.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"It's that time of year again, and you can smell autumn in the air. This has always been my favorite time, made even better by one of my favorite local breweries rolling out their Munich Lager. This is a hazy light brown brew with a one-finger topping of off-white head. Retention is adequate, and a thin layer of bubble specked lacing is left behind. It actually mells earthy and hoppy up front with a good layer of sweet malt and caramel underneath it all which makes for a good combo. The taste is more mellow than the aroma, but still not bad. Hints of sweet malts, candy and a little spice exist. Some very mild fruitiness lurks down below everything. Carbonation is evident only after a good shake. This one goes down extra smooth secondary to it's light bodied mouth-feel. This is a good session beer to help you welcome in the season.","stephens101","Nov 27, 2007"

3.53,4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer pours a cloudy brown color with a huge creamy head that leaves a ton of lace. The smell could almost be considerd a malt bomb. Super sweet malt character. Has an almost nutty flavor at times. The taste has almost too much malt sweetness to it for my liking. This beer has a nice smoothness to it most likely from the bottle conditioning. Not a bad beer. Of all the US made oktoberfest beers it reminds me most of St. Arnolds version. Nothing like the German versions but thats ok.","ttu94","Nov 07, 2007"
3.92,16.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Between the 2 beers I have tried from Pete's place this one was the clear winner, the other beer being Choc original. It seemed to be a good single bottle beer, I tried one bottle right after eating, and was not that impessed, but I had another bottle while working on an art project, in which I had not eaten or had drunk anything for quite some time and was pretty blown away by the flavor of this local brew. The second time around was much better.","skeetermoses","Oct 27, 2007"
4,18.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy dark orange color, nice carbonation, very nice thick creamy off-white head, tons of creamy sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slightly spicy, and a good dose of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, spicy, and some caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty Vienna Lager, would buy if it was available in my area, recommended.","Wasatch","Oct 12, 2007"
3.45,2.4,3.5,3.5,3,4,4,"Pours a dark orange, hazy from being unfiltered. Has a large tan head. Smells earthy. Taste is quite smooth, almost has a lemony, citrus like taste. A bit tart and metallic too. Almost has an ale like quality. Very unique for a lager. Good mouthfeel, carbonation is good. Quite drinkable too, I could drink several of these. Bonus points for being bottle conditioned. I don't think I've had a bottle conditioned lager before so this is pretty cool.","tronester","May 24, 2007"
3.69,9.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Overall not bad - I didn't expect much so I was very pleasantly surprised. Would make a fine session beer.","OKCNittany","Dec 01, 2006"
3.38,0.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Thanks to beertracker, who I'd like to do another trade with in the fall, as I'd like to try this again when it's fresh as it has something to it...","jwc215","Nov 03, 2006"
3.67,8.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Not a bad beer, but it is merely average compared to other Octoberfest beers.","jmbranum","Oct 28, 2006"
3.78,12.2,4,3.5,4,3,4,"This is another good brew from Pete's Place and I really cant decide if I like choc or chocotoberfest more. This beer has a very good amber/brown hazy appearance (since its unfiltered).The very large foamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing. I loved the texture of the head. The beer has a nice malty flavor which is followed by a nice touch of hops. Overall a very tasty brew.","boblog","Sep 20, 2006"

3.57,5.9,3,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,"Mostly I think this beer has suffered in the bottle some. It has low carbonation and that really effects the rest of the perception of this beer. So I only punished it in the mouthfeel as it still smells really good. Like sweet wort with a mince of german hops and a light touch of alcohol. The taste is how I prefer my Octoberfest beers, a little on the sweet side full of caramel and toasty flavors. Good stuff I think it would be better on tap.","Higravity","0"
3.3,-2.1,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light tan head above the clear orangey amber brew. Head fades quickly down to an even layer of bubbles, with average lacing. Aroma is balanced, with a tending towards grain hulls. Taste follows the nose, but with a bit more tart fruitiness in the middle as I would want/expect. Closes slightly chalky. Mouthfeel and drinkability not too bad, but this one kind of let me down in the end.","ppoitras","Beers"
3.53,4.7,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,4,"Pours to a clear light amber color (if you pour carefullly off the sediment) and permanent white head. Aroma is malty and a bit sharp (is there wheat in there?) with caramel notes. Flavor is semi-dry and malt oriented, with no discernable hop character other than balacing bitterness. Finishes dry and malty. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and fizzy. This is a bottle-conditioned malt-oriented amber lager with a distinctive original ""choc-beer"" personality. Not an extraordinary beer, but a solid citizen nonetheless.","EagleTalon","0"
