"Pours a clean copper color, little head. Scent brings toasted and nutty grain, faint kiss of caramel, some earthy, leafy hops. Tastes follows scent, mild but flavorful. Perhaps undone by the body which just misses being crisp, lighter side of medium, lightly coating. Overall, a decent, although light flavored and bodied Vienna."

"Overall: Quite enjoyable. Not sure why it's labelled an American Amber, when I'm certain they told me it was a vienna style lager."
"In NO for a wedding and sat and had a sampler with dinner. This brew was a very thin and light amber color. Nearly no head on this to speak of. There was a mild malt aroma and faint hops present. The taste was very thin and watered down. My wife really enjoys ambers and she had one of these and didn't enjoy it. For being in the sampler I would not recommend this brew."
"Nice amber/copper/rust color with about a half inch head and a fine bit of lacing. Flavor of nice toasted grains, slightly malted with a nice little hop punch at the end. Made for a nicely balanced beer, though a litter lighter than I hadbeen initially expecting."
"Drinkability: an excellent beer to beat the new orleans heat!!"
"Decent, but the diacetyl is a little to prevalent. It does not ruin the beer, but it is there. A small grip, and an overall good beer to quaff at the brewpub."
"Light to medium body with medium carbonation. Nothing special but it seemed like the best offering available. I only found myself in this setting for a meeting so I doubt I'd make my way out again for another. Overall, a decent brew but nothing to get excited about."
"D 3.0 - drinkable, but not excellent. Okay at best for the style."
"Clear, light amber beer with a thick, cream coloured head supported by constant, aggressive carbonation. Chunky lacing with rings of foam clinging to the glass. The aroma had a bit of C-hop to it, but was dominated by an acidic bite from the excessive carbonation. The flavour was mild, perhaps delicate, with a bit of fruit, malt and hops staying nicely balanced. Unfortunately, the bitterness became a bit dirty and harsh in the finish. Light bodied with too much carbonation, but the mouthfeel did stay fairly soft. Fairly easy to drink, but the carbonation was a serious problem."
"Mouthfeel was darn nice - much more appetizing than the Black Forest. Drinkability is good with this one."
"This is my favorite offering from this tasting at Crescent City. The bartender told me that it was their signature beer. I agree."
"This tastes a lot like Crescent City's Pilsener, except this has a more lemony finish and a slight bit more malt flavor. Red Stallion pours an amber color with a good head. Smell is appropriately hoppy, with some lemon zest mixed in. Taste is broadly in the Vienna style, I thought malt flavor wasn't present enough for full satisfaction. Tastes too close to their Pilsener for a strong distinction. This is easy and enjoyable enough to drink, I just wish it had more kick."
"The mouthfeel is smooth with a relatively clean and quite finish. Medium bodied, very light carbonation level. The flavor is slighlty off balanced to give it a better score in drinkability, and I was getting slightly bored by the end of the drink."
"This is a Vienna style red, but is actually more of a copper color with a low beige head. Aroma is malty and biscuity, but not hoppy. Mouthfeel is average, moderately carbed. Flavor is medium malt, a little doughey, with bits of caramel and diacetyl. A lingering hop bite can be felt in the back of the throat. This one is average to above average in all respects. Stick with the IPA (if they have it) or the Black Forest."
"It isn't quite red, as the name might make you think. It was more of a dark golden color, with maybe a tinge of red to it. It had a big, strong head that had good lacing. The nose was somewhat weak, with no hops there at all. Some sweetness to the nose. The taste was a bit sweet. Not bad, but not real exciting either."
"Mouthfeel is on the thin side, drink ability is fairly decent as the carbonation seems perfectly calibrated."
