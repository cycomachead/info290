"O: Way better options out there for a vienna lager."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a thick film of off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of sweet bready and caramel malt. Flavor starts with caramel malt with hints of toasted malt, slight brown sugar, finshes a bit thin with a faint reminder of the sweet malt. Medium bodied with a peppery almost overactive carbonation. Starts off pretty well, if a bit mild, but the flavor tapers off fairly quickly at the same time that the active carbonation becomes a distraction. Pleasant enough to drink with lunch, but fairly unbalanced and light tasting in the finish."

"O: suggests an odd cross between a light Euro pale and a Mexican amber. OK but not worth seeking."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, slight adjunct, hint of hops, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of an Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hint of hops, sweet malt, pale malt, slight adjunct, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, good appearance, feel, and blend."

"Hope this is okay, first review, novice who just discovered real beer tasting at 40."
"O: The taste of this beer might seem to be a little bland but it is still easy to drink. Some hints of hop flavors might have made it a little more interesting."

"Overall, nothing special, but fairly easy to drink. Forgettable but still enjoyable."

"Easy to drink, enjoyable. In a blind taaste test I would have guessed an Austrian Märzen."

"Overall: Great wines come from Italy, but they might want to focus on their beers in their future. Might have to stick to Morretti's. This one reminds me of European lagers I have had over the years."
"Pours a nice clear darkish amber with a fairly thick ivory-tan head. Aroma is crisp, more fruity than malty, not strong but still appealing. Malty flavor is crisp and a little fruity, nothing special but enjoyable. This makes a good accompaniment to a meal rather than a stand-alone drink. Texture has average body and a decent amount of fizz. Overall, fair to middlin' and worth at least a try."
"Overall – not a bad brew, but not very interesting either."
"It's a'ight."
"O: Drinkable and enjoyable. Style over substance as it looks better than it tastes. Still, I would have again."
"This beer really reminds me of a slightly stronger Yuengling which isn't saying much overall. You could do worse, but I would have to say I wouldn't want to have this again really if I had a choice."
"Drinkability: Without having heard of this beer or brewery, the waiter at the Italian restaurant I was at said this was an Italian microbrew and was much better than the rest of Italy's offerings. He showed me the interesting bottle and I decided to make the plunge. Menabrea will not be getting any more of my money, especially at 'import' prices. I would love to have a good Italian beer that would hold up to my Italian meal, but this just simply does not do it."
"Libation: On the plus side, this is a very well balanced, lively beverage, with some minor complexity. An the negative side it brings nothing to the table in any of those areas that makes me want to try it again. It's a mediocre beer, but add to that the $2.49 price tag for one bottle and this is too high a price for too low a value."
"D: Experience wouldn't have been so bad if not for the horrible aftertaste. Also, carbonation was almost too filling to even stomach one bottle."
"Drinkability is fair. The smell is good, but the beer goes downhill from there. Mouthfeel is definitely the worst aspect, and it detracts from the drinkability."
"D: Body is medium to low which would have allowed a moderate session but the poor characteristics blew the deal on this one."
"D - A lager I kind of wanted to like, but it is not one I would recommend at all, obviously. I found this one just was not good to begin with and left a not good taste in my mouth."
"I'd consider this a below average Amber Lager. But as a Vienna Lager, it fails in maltiness, breadiness, richness, and depth. No where near the intended flavor descriptions."
"Why is Italian beer so damned expensive? It isn't like they're in anyone's Top-10 Brewing Nations of the World. I've seen 750s for $15-22 (and even higher) that aren't that highly regarded. This single cost $2.49, which probably translates to a six-pack price well over $10. Bottom line: this is lousy beer at any price."
"Drinkable sweet brew."
"Overall not much to say, don't think the long voyage did this beer any favors. Would not get this again."
"You can drink this one very easily and I might say it's not bad afterall. Much much better than the lager version of Menabrea."
"The beer pours a clear copper color with a little dish water head. The detected aroma is exclusively from the toasted malts. Light to medium bodied on the palate. The flavor is grainy, husky, bready a little caramel sweetness. This is all balanced with some spice in the finish. Drinkable and pleasant, not to bad."
"Pours a four finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer, leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Good carbonation and light-medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is sweetish caramel, don't get the metallic that some raters have noted. $1.99 for a 330ml bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"overall below average."
"Too metallic, slightly salty and bland-ish for me. Not a fan of overall character (or almost general lack thereof). Aftertaste not too thrilling, either. Not horrible, has something of a standard Vienna/Amber lager character to it, but I certainly wouldn't get it again."
"Pours a bright burnt orange with a tall tan head that retains exceptionally well leaving lots of sticky sheets of lacing as it falls to a quarter inch cap that holds the duration.The nose is mildly sweet with some nuttieness as well.Malts up front are sweet a caramely with toasted bread notes along with hints of roasted sesame seeds and gentle,earthy,spicy hops.The body is solid in every manor of the word with a nice dryness factor and an aftertaste that works as a constant calling card for another sip.Keep brewing this shit people,this is a fine Amber!"
"Overall - A pretty good amber ale... shame it's retired as could happily drink a few more of these..."
"Sampled 1-25-2007. Pours a clear amber brown with a big off white head. A slight sweet hoppy nose with a nutty edge. Metallic with a slight nutty flavor. There's potential, but it doesn't really come through. Though the nut character is nice. It is drinkable, sure. But for an anniversary edition brew, I am not blown away."
"Pours medium amber with a nice head that lingers well, leaving some lacing. Slight haze. Aroma is pretty strong malt and honey, somewhat reminiscent of a marzen. bare hints of hops. Tastes pretty fresh for a ""retired"" beer. Again, sweet honey-malt characters up front, but not as strong as the aroma. Hops in the background, faint but noticeable. Much better than the original Menabrea, and something I will look for next time I am in Italy. As long as I am somewhere with other choices, I will probably not seek this one out."
"Anyway, on to the review. This was quite a weird beer for me. Opened and poured into Chimay glass; an almost overwhelming aroma of molasses hit me. This thick maltiness made me worry about what the taste was going to be like. The appearence was a clear dark amber colour with a thin head. Thankfully, it does not taste like it smells. It had a much more subdued malty taste, with some sweetness and very little complexity. I tired of the taste quite quickly. It's not a beer I would be rushing out to buy again."
"Appearance is a nice amber with a thick crisp head leaving a nice lace. Aroma is mainly sweet like honey blending nicely with the hops. Taste is not as sweet as the smell, bready, light malt and hop. Mouthfeel is light - medium, but maybe a bit thin, carbonation is good giving it a crisp finish. Towards the end of the glass I think my buds got tuned to beer, wish I had another to confirm that."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is approacing medium bodied. The beer is well carbonated. There are no off smells or flavors present in the beer. This is a very easy to drink beer. This beer went over very well with my macro drinking friends."
"Overall it's a pretty decent beer, similar to a Vienna-style lager (I actually though of Dos Equis when I first tasted it). It's not great, but it's certainly not bad."
"Cheers!"
"330 ml bottle, now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet). Amber colour, large white head. Moderate malty aroma with notes of toffee and some fruity hops. Flavour is moderately malty with some caramel and tolerable hops, but this is really not much more than ""average"" beer. Some metallic notes in the aftertaste."
