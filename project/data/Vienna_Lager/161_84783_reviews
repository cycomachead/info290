"Looking forward to trying this again!"

"Overall- A solid lager with bright citrus flavors and a nice malt backbone of caramel sweetness and toasted grains.  Slight clash in flavors with the citrus and toasted grains, but its a minor flaw.  If this beer was in my neck of the woods I'd gladly buy this on occasion as its a step up from lagers like yuengling and it makes for a nice food pairing beer. (81/100)"

"Pours a medium straw color with a short lived head. Cracker like aroma, some bread and floral as well. In the taste, grainy and malty but fairly clean. Inoffensive and easy drinking at the least, and cleaner than many lagers I've had. The body is medium somewhat heavy for the style. Overall, a decent Vienna lager, not great."

"Chilled haze on a honey colored body. Initial 2-3 finger head settles to a fat ring with pock marks and mild lacing. Aroma is of nutty malt mixed with grainy cereal. Flavor is much the same. Honest, clean with no flaws. Came expecting not much but it's alright."

"O: basic lager, clean, bitterness gives it some character"

"Picked this up at a resort in Florida. Better than most of the stuff in the fridge, but well below some of the good lagers I have had."

"Flavor brings this one back, though, with an odd tinge of tropical fruit rounding out the toasted grains. Seems quite well-balanced and not over-malted as some lagers can be. I say, this one's solid and well worthy."

"This pours a clear, amber color with a slight, foamy head. The aroma has grains, malts, and a bit of spicy hops. The flavor is full of cheap grains reminding me of Busch or Genuine Draft but this is a little better tasting. Very simple and plain as it’s nothing out of the ordinary other than a basic local beer."

"Brown tinted amber, minimal head on the pour. Scent brings notes of sweet malt extract with faint stale hopping. Taste carries over from scent, lightly bitter and earthy, sweet but not overly flavorful. Medium bodied, some heft and lacking in carbonation. Nothing to see here folks..."

"Really couldn't distinguish this from one of my early homebrew recipes. These guys must be starting out in the craft business if this is their lager offering. Got 3 bottles as part of a monthly beer club. I guess I'll drink them...? Also got Key West Ale in the shipment which is also by Florida Beer. Hope it is an improvement."

"Overall – A pretty tasty lager. Very drinkable and a nice blend between sweet and malty. Not bad."

"This is a medium bodied, lightly carbonated offering. It is fairly easy drinking adjunct lager of sorts that was worth it to say I had it. Under other circumstances I probably would have hated this but in the hot sun, it wasnt bad."

"O - A decent Vienna lager. Nice to try to see the local take on the style, and a good update to their Ybor Gold Amber Lager. You can find better takes on the style though."
