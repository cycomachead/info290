"I love a good Vienna lager and this one delivers the goods. Toasted biscuit, slightly floral hops, and a deep Amber color with red and orange hues. Paired excellently with fried cheese curds and Olaf sauce."
"Very smooth with a nice follow through."

"High C-"

"The beer is amber hued with a half inch of head. Aromas of lager yeast, light fruity character, a touch of bread / grain. Fresh, really smooth on the palate and well balanced. Easy to drink and enjoy. Refreshing on a warm summer day. I sat outside and alternated between this and Live Oak Hefe, both tasty brews. Definitely above average for the style. I normally don't enjoy amber lagers this much. I would definitely have this again."

"After drinking the belgian ale, this is one is a refreshing light beer. The beertender reminds me this is not a light beer. The color is amber. There was a good head on it after the pour that is gone now. It has a decent finish. Easy to drink with an ale-like bitter taste I like. I could drink quite a few of these, me thinks!"

"O: Overall, rather unremarkable. I dont think Id drink this one again. Not that it was bad, but it certainly nothing special. Glad I was able to try a beer that is usually not available to me though."

"Pours a very pretty amber with no head. Flavour profile is well balanced, fresh-tasting and all around decent, but nothing particularly interesting. Tastes like lots of other local ambers. The fresh hops are not really something I'm particular fond of, but it adds a nice fresh, fruity, bitterness a lot of people might like. It's just not something I'm personally a fan of."

"O: Very enjoyable and a decent example for the style. The lingering bitterness (it lingers for quite a while) makes the beer not very sessionable. But I would enjoy this beer at another opportunity, just not many of them in a sitting."
"This pours a clear caramel color with a tight layer of foam topping it. There’s a muted aroma and this light, malty flavor with a sharp, hoppy bitterness that rounds it out. And, honestly, that’s the way I like my amber lagers: with character and a kick, not just malty syrup. Good one."

"Overall-If these beers were canned/bottled this would be my go to session beers. Another really nice offering from Live Oak."
"O - really exceptional beer... tasty and drinkable & good representation of the style. Happy they gave this year around."
"Overall: Honestly I’m not that big a fan of brown ales or amber ales and this one was no exception. It didn’t do much to separate itself from the pack. I always enjoy Live Oak’s beers so I was slightly disappointed by this offering."
"Amber in color. Smells of toffee, and a hint of cinnamon. Taste is light grainup front followed by caramel and finishes with oaky smoke. Mouthfeel is smooth low carbonation. A pretty good beer, somewhat bland though. I like their Hefei much more than I like this beer personally."
"D - amazing drinkability. could drink this for several hours. really enjoyed this one, will not be seeking it out soon, but if its on the menu i may grab it again."
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is very nice. I get quite a bit of toffee, but I also get some bread and a little bit of grape. The flavor is more of the same, with a lot of toffee and bready malt as well as a little bit of pine and grass from the hops. I also get a little bit of grape in the flavor as well. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"with that said... don't go to cane and abel's in austin. it a waste of time. had it again in much better quality but still nothing equal to their other beers."
"D - Overall this is a good sessionable beer it has a good taste thats easy to drink not the first Live Oak beer I'd pick but a good one thats worth a try sometime"
"Pours with a dark amber color, minimal head, with a transparent body. Smells were abundant with malts, low in hops. Compared to other amber lagers I've tasted, the malts weren't overpowering. The taste was bitter with malts, but it wasn't an uncomfortable bitterness. Was a smooth drink overall. This is not a style I'm very particular of, but this was definitely one of the better ones I've had."
"A thin, off-white head that had begun to dissipate even as it was being served to me. Color was a medium-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was fairly sweet for a lager-style beer. Mouthfeel was medium with a good bit of sweetness on the tongue. Finish remained sweet. Decent, but not compelling."
"There is just not a lot here. I can't see reaching for this over the Hefe. Though, worth at least one try."
"D: I liked it, didn't love it."
"I'm glad I got to try a local Austin brewery beer, I'll look forward to trying more when i'm in the area."
"D: No problem with hammering this one over and over if you so desire. Smooth and not syrupy."
"Poured in a Fireman 4 glass. Small light tan head. Lightly carbonated. Clear orange brown color. Faint caramel malt smell. Starts with some caramel nuttiness, turning slightly astringent. A little vegetal. Med body. Finish gives the slightest bit of hops on the back of your tongue. Med alcohol."
"Smells of citrusy (grapefruit?) American hops and maybe a little caramel from the malt. Taste is dominated by big hop flavor with a little caramel adding some balance. The mouthfeel is thin, making it good for washing down a meal. An alright beer but a little one dimensional."
"Drinkability- Excellent drinkability. I could drink this all night and be happy. None of the flavors are too overwhelming, I found it nicely balanced, and I kept wanting more. I always find myself ordering this when I'm in Austin."
"A nice amber lager, with a tasty hop assertiveness that - while welcome - might give this beer a just slightly unbalanced quality."
"This was a good beer - very drinkable. Definitely worth trying if you find yourself in Texas. I was told Live Oak is a good brewery out there - this was my first of their line. I'd have it again, but wasn't my favorite. Not bad at all though..."
"The aroma is full of smooth caramel malts. The flavor matches with the same caramel and bread, but with a dry, almost burnt toffee note. The beer finishes with grassy bitterness, its not big, but its the most prominent taste."
"D - this is a really nice amber from a great brewery, but i was hoping they would do even better with this style."
"The mouth is smooth, could be a session beer, but I would want something a bit more bold."
"Draft at Billys in Austin. Light Amber in color, with light to medium carbonation and small to medium white head. Smell is of caramel sweetness, intense juicy dried apricots, slight maltiness. Taste is similar with a mild bitterness as well. Medium finish and a good beer overall. A nice vienna-style lager."
"It came in a big 20 oz glass, without a lot of head on it. It was a sparkling amber color. Aroma was a good amount of malt without any cerealness, and with a bit of hop. Flavor was more of the same; a nice amount of malt without any loss of refreshingness. Very good."
"This beer is pretty decent and clings to the palate well. Makes for a decent session."
"The mouthfeel is very light."
"Very sessionable and pretty tasty. If you like a beer with a fairly low hop profile, and a nice flavor, this should do the trick for you."
"D - Good drinkability. High sessionability. Went great with some pizza."
"Pours a deep amber color with a creamy light tan head that settles into a nice lace. Nose is grassy and citrusy hops. Taste begins with fruity caramel malt and a toasted nuttiness followed by a somewhat spicy hop bitterness with a bit of grapefruit rind. Finish is crisp. Would make a good session beer."
"Opinion: This was an OK beer, but there were a couple off flavors to add to the lack of carbonation that was disappointing. Perhaps I had a dirty glass as I saw latter pours that had more head retention. I would like to try this beer again at the brewery to make sure that I was getting what they intended to be poured."
"Draft at Flying Saucer in San Antonio."
"Live Oaks Big Bark Amber Lager is a bolder Amber lager with some combat going on between the malt and hops as noted by other reviewers. This beer wont please everyone but still holds up with Live Oaks quality standards."
"The color is a shiny amber with an average-sized, light brown head. The aroma is of lightly toasted malt, pretty good, but not quite rich enough. Taste is more of the same, the strength of the malts seems to be just a little weak for the style. A little graininess does give the flavor another facet. Looking at the other reviews it seems to have been hoppier in the past or I got a weird batch. Anyway, this beer seems taylored for session drinking, but cannot compete in taste with some of the maltier ambers."
"This beer could have been so much better if the hops were more discernable. Otherwise, this is a sweet lager that seems more like an Oktoberfest to me."
"Overall Impression: A very thirst quenching beer. I enjoyed it. It reminded me of Abita Amber or St. Arnolds Amber, so I think it is fairly close to style. I would make a decent session, but I was happy after one beer. Next time Ill try another Live Oak."
"This is a delicious, balanced, malty-hoppy-nutty amber lager. Fantastic!"
"Drinkability/notes: A bit off-trail with respect to the hoppiness to judge by the amber ales that I have sampled, but nonetheless tasty and quite drinkable. Reviewed on tap at Waterloo Icehouse in Austin, Texas."
