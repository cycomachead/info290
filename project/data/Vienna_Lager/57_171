The color is a deep copper, with a golden hue in the right kind of light.  The head is rather small, about a finger's width, and it lingers.  Its aroma is of corn, not overly strong.  It tastes of grain, a bit watery actually.  It has a dry after effect.  Not bad.  Not good either, but overall, this is a beer you can have with dinner, and it won't ruin your evening at all.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Nov 05, 2014"

Poured with a short off-white foam that quickly reduced to thin wisps.Â Buttery, toasted malt and burnt caramel aromas with hints of herbal hops. Medium bodied with a slightly watery feel up front that transitions to light, tangy, crispness through the middle to the end. Burnt caramel malt and light toasted malt flavors with herbal hops through the middle and clean finish. Flavors are generally subdued with dominant burnt caramel character.","IronLover","Oct 07, 2014"

2.53,-18.6,3,2.5,2.25,3,2.75,"Overall, this was a beer had in desperation.  We had flown into Boston on an evening flight for a friendâs wedding.  After the hour long drive to Worcester we found ourselves with a hankering for some sauce at about 11pm.  It was a Friday and the beginning of a wedding weekend.  Highly understandable.  We drove around Worcester for an hour looking in every Walgreens, CVS, and sketchy corner store we could find, looking for a pack of local beverages to bring back to the hotel and relax with.  Alas, to our surprise, we found no such thing.  Frustrated and defeated we turned back towards the hotel, and were happy to find an alcohol-slinging establishment a mere half mile from our temporary abode.  This was the only beer available, aside from Pacifico, so we really just flipped a coin here.  The âamber lagerâ is a standard Mexican adjunct lager, giving cheap grain through the nose and mouth, with little to rest upon for feel or sustenance.  We drank the swill quickly, and it served its purpose, but after this we rapidly moved on to sampling the beverages for which this cantina was named.","TheBrewo","Sep 21, 2014"

But it's also thoroughly eclipsed by so many other options (Sam Adams flagship is the same style, probably around the same price point and is so much better than this). I don't always drink beer, but when I do, prefer it to taste like something.","illpass78","Jun 08, 2014"

It's a safe bet that I'll enjoy it and the beer will complement whatever I'm eating. It's much better in flavor than Sam Adams (in my opinion), less expensive, and more pleasant to drink.

3.63,16.7,3.75,3.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Although a somewhat average beer, I find the Dos Equis Amber Lager to be a very refreshing and smooth beer. It has a good amount of taste and is not as watery as many beers of similar pricing. I find this beer to be the best of the beers that one can get a pint of for $3-4. Though it won't overwhelm you with complicated tastes and smells, it will refresh you and satisfy you. Goes well with a lime garnish and makes a hot summer day that much more pleasant.","TheOneCleanHippy","Mar 17, 2014"

Very light aroma of malts and caramel. The taste is the same with more malts coming through. A little 'watered-down' but decent. Overall smooth to drink with just a little bitterness for the finish.

Its an easy drinker, slightly sweeter than I'd like, but its got more taste in the malty range than the domestic ""chuggers"". Decent aftertaste too. When in the land of Mexican macro-brews, this is my go-to. I've not had it with a lime that I can recall, but that might give it a nice acidic balance. ( I prefer Negro Modelo to be served with one. ) Also, I agree with others that this is best when Ice cold. Gets skunky when it warms.","bambam2517","Nov 28, 2012"

The aroma of this brew consists of toasted malt and some trace amount of hops. Light in body, this brew has the taste of sweet toasted grain, semi- dry feel, some earthy hop bitterness.

This is one that definitely benefits from ten minutes on the counter before being poured. Regardless of the serving temperature though, you can be assured that this is a much tastier beer than the majority of its Mexican lager counterparts. This is often the optimal choice at Mexican restaurants, and it's a respectable session beer if nothing else.

Sure, its refreshing with your food, but that's because there seems to be so much water in there. Taste is similarly bland and watered down. It does have one thing in its favor, and that is the lack of typical adjunct lager off flavors which I understand to be common for Mexican beers. I can't really detect any flavorful chords of any significance, however. Easily forgettable, but not terrible or disgusting to taste.","WastingFreetime","Jun 03, 2011"

3.38,8.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"In comparison to its Grupo Modelo counterparts, this CervecerÃ­a Moctezuma Vienna-style offering is much more acceptable and closer to the mark of an authentic European amber lager.

The smell is dextrin like, but much of the aroma is muted by the cold temperature. More of the same in the taste, but with a little bit of caramel and a light bitterness to level it out. It features the Mexican trademark of a light and easy drinking beer. Very similar to the other Mexican beers brewed in the Vienna style. Keep this cold, or risk dealing with corn flavors.","DoubleJ","Nov 30, 2007"

3.14,1,4,2.5,3,3,4,"I had this at a Mexican restaurant yesterday and after years of enjoying this, largely from a bottle, I have to give it some benefit of the doubt in my review, because this sample was a bit disappointing. Although it looked its usual beauteous deep copper color, the head was a bit thin on this one, modest lace. The aroma was also very thin and barely suggested some wheat perhaps but not much else. The head died pretty quickly and with the first swig I was surprised at how lifeless this was. Not quite flat officially but definitely not what I have come to expect. There is a light carmel flavor but I also got a slight metal detector reading. There is a fine carbonation though it is not too powerful. There is some sweet wheat noted but overall I was disappointed in this on tap. By the bottle it is almost always a winner and a great choice with heavy food like you might typically have at a Tex/Mex restaurant. I will have to review a bottle to help even up the score here.","Durge","Jul 25, 2007"

Pored a golden amber, with a slight reddish hue. A big fizzy white head graced the top and faded quickly leaving behind a decent little top of film, and some residual lacing for a minute or two. Nice carbonation was evident from the start. Smell was very light, practically non existent here. What was there was maybe some kinda light grain, but it was really faint, maybe a touch of some kind of bready yeast..The taste was rather blah and non descript. Your typical amber lager really. Lots of malt, no hops, and a touch of grain, thats about it. Pretty good mouthfeel as the carbonation kept things pretty lively on the palate, and it went down very smooth, with a quick, crisp finish. Very clean. Drinkability was above average, as very cold this was one that you could throw down a ton of. Overall I have had muc worse, and for a macro, not actually half bad. Went pretty damn well with dinner.

A weak amber color (caramel) later confirmed by the watery texture and taste that the brew makes no real attemp at quality. Aromas and flavors display light caramelization, but not enough to make any meaningful impact in the brew. Flavors hing on graininess, watered-down cola, and a faint resemblance to a lager. Thin body, and adjucts lead to astringency and residual grain and sugars on the palate. Though the beer is not awful, it makes a good run of it.

I was under the impresssion that this was supposed to be the better of the two major Mexican beers, the other being Corona of course. Now I can't figure out why. I took this straight from the bottle so it should get a rating of 3 even, but I'm subtracting half a point because there is absolutely no way a beer this weak could possibly have the right color for the style they claim (they say its a Vienna Red Lager, every indication I got was of an American Light Lager). And to put this in perspective, Sam Adams Boston Lager is ALSO a Vienna style Red Lager. I defy anyone to sample this next to a Sam Adams and claim they both correctly fit the same style. Smell was of alcohol and tiny bit of sour hops. Taste was of sour hops, alcohol, the faintest wiff of grain and get this: the bottle. Almost everyone who drinks beer has noticed the taste a can imparts, but how weak does a beer have to be to taste like the glass bottle it came in? As weak as Dos Equis apparently. Eventually, when I was almost at the bottom of the bottle a tiny bit of hop bitterness and adjunct grain flavor came through, but for at least 3/4 of the bottle, a little bit of sour, a little bit of alcohol, and a lot of carbonation were the main flavors. Mouthfeel was very watery and fizzy. Miller Lite has less carbonation. Drinkability lost some points because this beer is just so weak you may as well give up and drink water. Really it is harmless though, it was hard to find anything objectionable because the lack of taste was so complete. If I was going to take a guess at the recipe for this beer I'd say: Drink half to 2/3 of a Michelob Light. Leave it out till it gets warm and flat. Fill the bottle back up with seltzer water and chill. That'd probably be pretty close to Dos Equis. The weakest tasting beer I've ever had. It tastes even weaker than Coors Light or Miller Lite. Though it still compares favorably to Coors Light because at least what little flavor it had wasn't bad and I can tell there's some alcohol in it.","casualbeerman","Dec 31, 2005"

Some malt but not much. Very mellow. Only distinct favors I could pick out were maybe some orange and some corn. A smokey aftertaste. It's a tad bit on the watery side. I think this beer would be very good with spicy Mexican food. It acts as a pretty good thirst quencher. Medium to high carbonation though the mouthfeel is still pretty smooth.

Light and almost thin and high in carbonation.  Malt flavors do manage to assert themselves and are comprised of caramelized sweetness from the combination of crystal and Munich, and / or perhaps a large percentage of Vienna malt in the grist.  Flaked corn sweetness is perceptible as well.  The hop bitterness is mild, but does provide an adequate foundation to the malt.  The use of adjuncts diminishes the malt backbone.
