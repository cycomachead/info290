"Hard to find down south, so that probably causes me to rate it higher than some. Not a true micro or artisan beer, but a decent attempt by a large brewery to appeal to a different taste."

"Here I am at the Milwaukee airport thinking, yeah Leinie's Red...been there done that... Turns out that no, I have never reviewed this beer and here I am having it on tap in its home state. Pours out to nice head that falls down and pale reddish amber hue. Aroma is mild, sweet malt and grassy hops. Flavors is balanced and refreshing, although a bit weak. Mouthfeel is light. overall a decent quaff when burned out on hop bombs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"chill it cold and enjoy. not your average lager as it has a bit of a malt backbone with a hop tingle at the end. nice ruby red color . try it as cold as you can."

"To start, I'm going to say that I love Leinenkugel beer. All of them, whether it's Creamy Dark or Summer Shandy, there isn't much wrong I can find wrong with them. Leinenkugel Red is no exception. My only complaint is that I wish it had a little more head when poured. This beer is refreshing and it's aroma and taste are superb. If you are a fan of Red's, try this out!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Of course it poured out well with a half-inch cream head and a ruby-orange color. This beers taste is well balanced with no one characteristic that shines through. That's why it's such a great beer. Extremely drinkable but hey I'm biased here what can I say."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a reddish, copper color with a decent fluffy head. The aroma is slightly malty with a slight bit of spices. The taste is fair with a decent malt and spice flavor that you would expect from a red lager. Drinks pretty decent with a likable texture and flavorful finish."

"This beer holds a special place in my heart. It was my gateway beer to microbrews and craft beers. Back when I was drinking MGD, Red Dog, Icehouse and other ordinary beers, this one was my first ""chance"" taken on something off the path. Applebee's had it on tap and I watched a server carry one by in a ""Brewtus"" glass. I said to myself, "" I must have one of those"". So I did and I enjoyed it. It became sort of an after work tradition and soon after I tried Warsteiner and Guinness and the rest is history. Can't remember the last time I had an MGD. Do they still make it? Anyway, about the beer....smooth...red....nice beer that deserves to be tasted. I confess that I haven't had one in a long time. I can't find it anymore around here. What happened to it? Wish I could find it. I would get a 6 pack or two of it. If it's in your area, try it."

"This is one of my facorites that I have tried from Leines thus far. The small was very pleasant, while the taste was even better. I was given a bottle of this on accident while at a restaurant. I am very happy about the mixup or I would have never tried this beer. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good red beer."

"Leinenkugel's Red Lager ---2.5/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Just the right hops. Too many craft beer snobs have to have over hopped beer that leaves a horrible taste when you belch. I agree that the head dies too soon. Otherwise this reminds me a bit of the cold fermented ales (Alt Biers) served only in Dusseldorf. Clean taste. Good mouth. Great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: NOTHING stands out about this beer. I really wanted to rate it lower but it really is just an ""average"" forgettable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good session beer. That's about the best thing to say about it."

"O - Pretty good. As someone else said, it could serve as a ""gateway"" to other craft beers. Drinkable."
"Not too much going on here. Basic and plain, actually has a pretty nice amber color, but after that pretty straight forward plain. Aromas of very slight spicy fruit, and that is being nice. taste is on the boring side for me, I expect more from a craft beer."
""
""
""
""
"Red pours a slightly dark golden color, with very small head. There wasn't much of an aroma at all. The taste was rather malty, and yeasty, no other flavors came through. Rather light in taste, no hops whats so ever, and watery. Overall this isn't a horrible beer, but their isn't much here, but it doesn't have a bad taste."

"O - The smell and the taste didn't leap out and grab me, but overall I'd say it's a refreshing beer that'd be great for rejuvenating on a hot day. I'd drink it again, and I'll likely buy some more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Slightly disappointed with this one. Comes off at the start with the biscuit dryness and then heads to bitterness from the hops and then a dry alcohol feeling. Not much flavor that i thought i'd have after smelling the nice aromas. Would like to try on tap to compare."
""
""
"3.1/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is light but pleasant caramelly toasty barley, light vaguely peppery- woody-grassy hop bitterness. It’s not great, it's thin, simple, and rather vague, but it’s reasonably good, goes well with chicken, and has just enough hop and malt, sweetness & bitterness, and overall depth to keep to somewhat enjoyable."

""

"Pours a clear reddish-orange with a thin tan head. Smells of some brown sugar and a hint of cooked corn. Taste is initially some toffee sweetness, followed by a bready middle, and a slightly tart, earthy finish. Average mouthfeel. Overall an average beer."
""
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, faint caramel note, thin mouthfeel. Pretty average overall. A step above macros and could be a ""gateway"" beer towards craft beer in general."
""
""
""
""
""
"Reddish beer, average pale white head. Smell is faint sweet malts. Taste is mellow slightly sweet maltiness, no hops to speak of. A touch watery. Mouthfeel is pretty boring without hops, spices, lots of carbonation, or something else to liven things up a little. A harmless session beer, easy to drink, better than macro brews but without a lot of character."
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't a great beer. It may be alright for someone working their way into craft beer, but it's definitely not a great representative of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: a tasty-enough and drinkable beer. Not a bad thirst quencher, despite some flavor difficulties."

"D: One of the nicer Leinie brews I have had (at least recently). Looks good, feels good, tastes fair, and smells alright. Nice and easy drinking. Pretty solid."
""
"This is a bitter beer, and not complex, but the bitterness is not overpowering nor unbalanced. It compliments pizza and spinach (or a pipe) quite well, but it is not the kind of beer I want to drink on its own."
""
""
""
""
"Translucent coppery red in color with a return to the usual fizzy stubby head without lacing from the majority of the members of the Leinenkugel session. Smell is very faint, almost non-existent, just a ghost of a whisper of malt nuance, tastes like a watery and thin-bodied vienna lager with a lackluster sprinkling of hops on top. I'm...not particularly impressed or offended by this one either. Middle of the road watery and thin beer, but still better than a BMC."
"When i poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a light reddish brown body with a very creamy,sticky white head. I don't pick up much from the smell but a little malt. The taste is a little malty with some hops on the back of the tongue. The mouth feel is ok and overall, i wasn't inpressed at all."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours an unsurprising copper red with a thin beige head on top. Decent lace left behind. The nose is mild with slight hop scent, but mostly sweet malts and breads. Good clean mouthfeel. Crisp with decent carbonation. A nice sweet lager here. Light toffee, fresh bread, little bit of graham cracker. Nice beer. Nothing earth-shattering, but a beer I wouldn't turn down."
"Overall, its okay. I like the hops but other than that nothing special."

"Overall, it's just ok. It has that Leinie's taste that every one of their beers has, and I don't know what it is or how to describe it, but it's always there. A decent brew, but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Nothing really special here. It's a vienna lager but that's about it. Seems muted and missing a bigger malty backbone."
""
""
""
"O: This is an average beer. It is drinkable, but I wouldn't buy again (in favor of trying something new)."
"O) Although they are different styles, this was somewhat similar to the classic amber. I thought the red was a little better. I actually think, that as far as Leinie's beers go this is pretty good. I have found Leinie's at many a family gathering, because they brew middle ground beer. It doesn't typically scare of the macro light crowd, and it doesn't completely disgust those with a preference for craft."
"D- Rather enjoyable. That said I'd prefer a Sam Adams to this."
"Had on-tap at a little place in Port Clinton called Bel Mel Tavern. Leinenkugel much like Sam Adams are usually solid choices when nothing else but macro is present. I find both companies produce fairly decent styles if a little unremarkable most of the time, though I find Sam to be better with their offerings then Leiny, but I digress. Poured a nice amber red into pint place which arrived with a quarter inch or so of fluffy head. Taste was a good mouth feel with a noble hop crispness that mellows to a nice clean drinking biscuit like finish. I have to say I would get this again, probably my personal favorite that I have had from Leinenkugel's as I actually found myself wanting another instead of wanting something else with a little more. A good solid vienna lager for sure."
"O: Probably the best I've had from Leine's, but that's not really saying much. A similar beer to Yuengling but not as dry. Worth a pickup if you like the style."
"I'll call this one AVERAGE, even though my ratings for appearance and smell will inflate the overall score."
"Wow, I can't remember the last time a beer left me so stricken for words, in the manner of 'I just can't describe this, it's so booorrring...' Not bad, not good, just, well, not even meh. Cripes, this is the beer equivalent of being home by 10."
" Sure, there's alcohol in here and I could have downed a few bottles of this if I had nothing else to drink here. This is a session beer but that's not saying a whole lot when this doesn't have a lot going for it. Having a Blue Point Toasted Lager or the Vienna Lager from Trader Joe's would be a wiser option than this since they have body and flavors to match. This may be the darkest ""lawnmower beer"" that I'll have this year."
"My first visit to Red Lobster (seriously) and my first Sam Adams pint glass with a lobster on it. Right on. The beer pours a rusty amber topped by nearly a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises caramel, stale rye bread, and musty oranges. The taste holds notes of musty caramel, orange rind, light lemon peel, black pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Things don't quite meld well, ending up with a harsh bitterness shrouded by a meek attempt at sweetness. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, I was nowhere near enthused by this brew, but luckily the tilapia dish that accompanied it salvaged the dinner."
"Very basic beer here. Subjectively, I am enjoying this quite a bit, and find it to be a great session possibility. But it lacks any distinguishing characteristics that would allow me to rate it higher. Solidly above average brew, though."
"Final Notes: Yet another letdown from Lenie's. I keep hopin they give me something memorable but it hasn't happened yet. I won't be buying this again, and there are much better Vienna Lagers out there (Snake River Lager and SABL come to mind)."
"My Leinie Lodge newsletter arrived the other day and it made for a pleasant read. The beer poured pleasantly enough, giving me two-plus fingers of thick, tawny head that began to fall like Wile E. Coyote off of a cliff. I am a big fan of truth in advertising, so a reddish-amber beer that bills itself as a ""Red Lager"" is right up my alley. Actually, it was closer to copper and it had NE-quality clarity which makes for a pretty beer, if nothing else. Nose was quite malty sweet, making good use of the four varieties mentioned on the label. Mouthfeel was medium with an initial sweetness, but giving 'way to a mild bitterness, especially on the finish. I shake my head in disbelief that I did not like this on tap at one point, but the circumstances are lost. I know that it was quite enjoyable this evening and if I could get it in a CAN, I would be up for a try."
"The red lager pours out as an mildly attractive amber color much like any of the red lagers out there. The head is a very light tanish yellow color with little retention. The smell is a little hoppy and a little bit of malts going on in there. The taste is malty up front with some other grains and finished up with a little hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is light and easy to drink like most of Leinie's brews. Overall it's not bad, it's not great either but worth trying."
"Drinkable but unremarkable. I'm not a big fan of the red lager style. If you like this one is probably decent."
"Not a bad lager though and I'd drink it again because it was refreshing but simple."
"This is way better than I expected it to be. Lots of clean flavors and very refreshing. One of the best I've had from this brewery."
"D - Fairly simple beer, but good flavor; a pleasant experience"
"Overall- Not too good, though I do feel Leine's makes a couple decent beers."
"Poured from a brown 12 zo. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is dominated by malts. Taste is also very malty, some hops present, clean and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall a good quality brew."
"overall not bad. like i said best of the lot but that is not saying a whole bunch."
"From notes: Poured into a pint glass. Crystal clear light copper color with a beige head that fizzes out quickly. Toasty tangy malt aroma, with nothing else really. Flavor is similar, malty with a faint tanginess and a cereal grain finish. Light body with medium-high carbonation. Good drinkability but pretty watery and boring."
"D: Hey it is not a bad Red, pretty average... Low ABV makes this a pretty good session beer. Nothing to run out looking for but nothing to run away from."
"The mouthfeel is light. A bit wispy and a touch sour in the finish. Could use a lot more depth and complexity. Would like more malt backing and the hops are wrong for style. Clean yeast notes though."
"Drinkability - fairly drinkable. Not a lot of complexity but not bad tasting either."
"M/D. Light bodied watered down feel that makes it easily drinkable, but than again the low quality macros are easily drinkable, but doesn't mean I'd want to."
"Overall: An average beer overall with some aspects I like, but definitely some artificial aspects I don't."
"D: WOW! This is just nothing special. I'm not a huge fan of Vienna Lagers, but there are must better representations of the style than this one."
"Pours a nice amber color with an actual head, creamy and sticks to the glass. Smell is modest and nice, slightly toasty with a bit of mineral. Tastes the same, a little spicy with a mostly malt presence. Finishes with some mild bitterness that lingers for a while. I could use some more body. I can't help but think this is akin to a starter homebrew, but this beer is pretty decent and easy to drink."
"Looks more than decent; solid red color with orange/amber coloring. Good head of 1 finger head with a light tan color. Clear and lively. Smell is crisp but highly adjunct and thin aromas. Taste is a little better; cheap malt character and some noticeable sweetness.. Acceptable hops taste I'm proud to say; true to Vienna styling with a honey hops finish. Taste is better than I expected, tasty, pretty balanced and crisp with a clean finish. Some sourness present, but overall a surprisingly decent macro beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. Color is a darker ruby color with an off-white head. The nose is some bready malt with a bit of caramel and light sweetness. The taste is definitely characteristic of some amber malt with a bit of dryness and some slight earth. Feel is a bit sweet yet still slightly dry. Pretty decent drinkability overall, but not something I'd really come back to."
"Poured into my Coors Banquet beer sampling glass. I like the amber color but the head is gone in a flash. No lacing at all. Smell is almost metallic and malts. Taste is uneventful, a little bit malty and some caramel. Mouthfeel is light to medium body. Drinkability is average, I bought a sampler with thee in the box so I will drink one or two more."
"D: few distinctives in this beer make it unappealing for a return visit"
"I'd have another one of these (in fact, I will in a few minutes). A good example of a Vienna Lager from my (somewhat limited) experience."
"D - This is a pretty weak beer. Not many redeeming qualities apart from that it looks like a good beer. Not impressed."
"A great beer. Looks good. Not too much head. Smell of strong, but pleasant hops. Taste is strong, but not too strong but it keeps you coming back for more beer. Mouthful is okay could be better. Drinkability goes along with taste. The better this better taste the more you feel like to drink and the more that you will drink"
"D- This beer is merely average. There is nothing very exciting about this beer. Just ok for me."
"D: Pretty decent for the style. Good for more than one."
"D -- All faults from its self-proclaimed title, it's really not a bad-drinking beer for those grab-a-brew days."
"D: Not the most exciting beer in the world, but it's light and goes down easy. A nice session beer."
"Taste, not bad. Better than Killians, but not by much, nor anything to brag about. A real straight forward beer. Middle of the road. Got a lot more expensive lately, not worth anywhere near $6.99 a 6er."
"Notes - A flavorful lager that ins't trying too hard. Which is a good thing since it is just a so-so beer."
"Cheers!"
"Okay, not the best tasting, not the best on the nose, not the best drinking experience ever, but hey, very easy to drink if you ask me. Makes a great beer from a keg for party in my opinion. Not a bad offering."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a big foamy off-white head that hangs around a long time till going into a film with minor lacing. Clear deep reddish copper color. Not much of an aroma. Tastes a little watered down. Almost seems like more maltiness will come out but never does. Some hoppy bitterness. Overall I wouldn't turn one down if offered but will not go out of my way to get one. Drinkable."
"D-This is probably not one that I'll revisit anytime soon, but I'd probably drink it if someone handed it to me at a party. The reasonable price point for this beer doesn't save it."
"T & D: Tastes just like it smells -- and this is nice because it isn't a blow-your-doors-off hop bomb of a red, or an extra-bitter, etc. As the Vienna style indicates, it's an easy drinker that always pleases and doesn't make your brain or taste buds work too hard."
"Amber color, small white head which disappears quickly. Smells of caramel and toasted malt. Not that impressive. Tastes a bit watered down. Some caramel and toasted hops. Not that impressive. High carbonation, thin, watery, and not the best drinkability."
"Drinkability: An average Vienna Lager. I like the caramel malt, but it is rather tame--especially for this brewery. A solid beer that I would not turn down, but most likely would not rush out for either."
"Leinenkugel's Red is an average Lager that is an easy drinker."
"All in all, this is a boring beer. I have enjoyed some of their offerings a lot more than this one."
"Drinkablity: Good brew. Decent richness while maintaining overall drinkability."
"For a Vienna lager, I feel that this beer is a very good example of the style. It is clean and has the toasty quality that you should see in a Vienna Lager. The melenoiden character is nice and he hops are sitting where they should be for this beer style. The only downfall of the beer is that it is a bit small on the malt side. Although all the flavor and aroma components are there, they are just too small."
"This here beer was really nice to drink. I had heard a lot about Wisconsin beers and this brewery in particular, so I looked forward to checking this one out. It turned out to be a delightful experience. Poured into a pint glass at the appropriate temperature for a lager resulted in an adequate head. Smell and appearance were good. However, taste and mouthfeel were just average. This is a drinkable brew. I look forward to trying more varieties from this brewery."
"Drinkability: This really isn't anything to write home about..."
"Drinkability: A pretty good Vienna lager. This style is hard to do well, in my opinion, so this one is certainly worth a try."
"Pretty generic beer, not a big favorite."
"Drinkability: A fairly pedestrian American Amber beer (not one of my favorite styles to begin with). It's not bad, but it's not anything special either."
"A watered down almost flat beer, with not enough flavor to make you want to drink a second one.You're better off drinking a light beer from one of the bigger companies, at least that way you'll get some sort of taste and flavor."
"I have had this in Wisconsin and locally and it tastes just as good as the brewery, as good in bottles and on tap. It makes the Killian's and Sam Adams Reds wanting more and not getting it. Without Miller involved it wasn't getting the exposure it deserved but it is always present in my fridge."
"Poured a clear, reddish amber with a respectable head that faded to a skin. The aroma was slightly malt. Malty sweetness with a little caramel. Mouth feel was light bodied with a good carbonation. Drinkability was good. Nothing special; good, solid Vienna lager."
"On tap at a Door County golf course after a round of 18. Served in a shaker pint glass. Medium red color with a dollop of white creamy foam. Light malt taste with caramel tones/sweetness. Mildly carbonated in the mouthfeel. Somewhat watery, and lacking real pizzazz. Good drinkability, worked well as a post golf brew. Not anything to search the ends of the earth for."
"Drinkability: This is pretty good. It's certainly something I could drink again."
"whoa. this was a very good vienna lager. creamy, malty, pretty...what more can you ask for? I coud drink this all night...and I just might."
"A medium amber color body with a small white head. Aroma is somewhat light,toasted sweet malt with a pinch of hops. Flavor is equally subdued with a light roastyness,light sweetness with a touch of hops for some balance, light carbonation,medium body, short finish , quite drinkable but nothing very special for me ."
"Pours a clear copper amber color. The carbonation is pretty intense that you see. There is a one finger head that gives way to okay lacing. The smell is of malt and some spices, maybe cinnamon. The taste is malty with a slight bite of hops to balance it out. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated. The overall drinkablity isn't that high. You could have one or two but not more than that."
"I had trouble putting down two of these in a row. Not one of Leinie's better beers."
"I know that many talk about Leinenkugels' as a good ""tweener"" that acts as a bridge between the craft beers and the standard macros. I think this beer fits that characterization quite well. It's not too special, but it's better than something mass-produced. The sweetness is nice, but it seems a bit ""artificial"" for my taste. This is a good beer to have at a party given its price and quality. I don't suggest that you go out of your way to try this beer if you're an enthusiast, but if you're just entering the wonderful world of beerdom, then I suggest you try it."
"D - For a cheapo session brew, it's OK. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, but if it's available and my budget's tight, I'd pick it up every now and then."
"Grabbed this one on tap because it was the best of the offerings. Kind of surprised me - while it's no mean a brewing masterpiece, it is a nice, mild, light little red lager with a nicely balanced mix of malt and hops. I don't expect much from Leinenkugel, and this did just fine."
"This beer pours a clear light red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of faint floral hops and caramel malt. The taste is fairly well balanced with a little more malt than hops. There is a nice lingering maltiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is an alright beer that would be really good if it had a little more hops in the taste ans aroma. I have drank this beer numerous times at bars when it is the best thing available, and will continue to do so."
"I've had Mexican Vienna lagers that are better than this(Victoria and Bohemia)."
"Thick caramel colored head which regretablly disappeard quickly. Obviously being a red it was a darker color but not as red as I expected. Looked more like a brown with red hint. Smells of some hoppiness and spice. Taste hits the tongue as bitter and smooths out as I run it around my mouth and ends with a very slight kick of nuttiness. Enjoyable but not the most drinkable beer. a couple would be plenty"
"though i wouldn't go out of my way for, would be nice to have to persuade your simple minded buddies away from macros, because it's not very extreme"
"D- Another watered down red, with not enough malt to save its self some flavor. I would rate it with most other mid level reds."
"D: Leinies is never that bad I guess it really is better after you have had the first one and then you can really think about the beer a little more but the same can be said about most of the commercial brews you have, really I don't know if it is the beer talking beyond that point but I think it is best put in the same terms as Ruffle's if your going to drink Leinies, ""You can't have just one."" Their Red Lager is neither bad nor that good. But whenever I go over to dad's house he will always have one waiting for me. And what can you say, its beer and sometimes a beer is better than no beer."
"D - It's a far better than average party beer. Something you could have lying around that wouldn't be intimidating to just take, but isn't crap."
"D-easy to dring quickly, but not one that I would reach for over and over"
"Pretty decent beer to drink since its not expensive."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Carbonation is light and a medium body make this an easy beer to drink."
"Decent atmosphere. Appearance a bit more notably, but a distinctive nose as well. Pretty decent flavor, feel is okay. It's light body does lend to good drinkability though. Pretty nice quaff."
"Good Lord, someone should bonk me on the head the next time I reach for a Leine because I have yet to taste one that I would consider good. This one could be the worst yet. It is dreadful. It doesn't look bad mind you, a very clear amber with red notes, some carbonation. The nose is typical of Leine beers, it has that wet cardboard, malty mustiness that just seems indicative of a cheaply made beer. One or two sips of this and away it went. This has a very dry, cracked malty flavor, with a strong musty red roasted graininess that is really hard to get down. The aftertaste is like a chemical explosion in the mouth of flavors that just shouldn't be there and have no business being something one would drink. Wow! this is bad stuff."
"Drinkability is average. It goes down pretty easy, and this would make a great cheap pizza beer. This beer isn't fantastic but has a nice enough flavor and drinkability that it could be paired with some other snacky foods or improved."
"Decent but less than spectacular lacing. Somewhat respectable head of foam, though, again, nothing spectacular. A rich red-amber hue with about a medium body. Some hint of spice and a little nuttiness, but traces of bitterness at times. Nothing spectacular, but you could give it a try. Not bad."
"Reminds me of Murphy's Red, not an overpowering taste, not too light either. Probably better in the summertime but living in a warm climate as I do, enjoyable even in January, not as good as my favourite red (Boreal Amber), but not bad and worth a try if available to y'all."
"Pours a fireball red coloring with a very frothy tannish head. Aroma is of lightly roasted hops and some dark cherry. The graininess and maltiness counterbalance the sweetness in a way that is somewhat pleasant. At first I thought I was drinking it too cold, but as it warmed it still didn't have much of a taste."
"D-Not great. This beer has few redeeming characteristics, and I don't expect I'll look for this one any more in the future. This beer would be a good one if you're going to drink several for an evening, with its thinner body and flavor."
"Poured a deep amber color with off-white head that held some decent lacing. Sweet maltyness with some grains on the aroma. Taste is of grains and has a fresh biscuit flavor as well. Minimal hop flavor. Medium body and nice carbonation combine for a good mouthfeel and also make it very drinkable."
"Flavor is not unified in this one. Unimpressive."
"A solid drinkable lager, could be really good if they gave the hops a little bump."
"No overwhelming taste or complexity here but okay as a well rounded any occassion beer in my opinion. Can hit home with the ""cheap beer"" drinkers and passes for those who like more complex beers. Definately an okay beer and I always come back to this one. A great introductory beer to anyone that usually indulges in ""cheap beer"" to open their horizons on the true world of beer."
"Overall, very passable, not recommended. I won't be drinking this one again."
"(rated Jun 12, 2008)"
"Pours a copper color with a nice off-white that quickly fades leaving light lacing. Aroma of some bready toasty malts and very light hops. Tasty is pretty much the same as the nose. Toasty malts, slightly metallic, light hints of fruitiness. Nothing too special going on here. Crisp mouthfeel, average carbonation. An ok lager, but Leinie's has better."
"I've had ""cheap"" red lagers that are better than this. In the end, cold, fizzy-ish water with a touch of caramel balanced only by a vague hop bitterness that goes in the wrong direction. Not easy to finish."
"Poured to a nice head after a violent pour. Head hung around quite awhile. Lacing was decent. Head was slightly offwhite in color and beer was brownish with a slight reddish tint. Smelled of a little malt and slight hop. Not much there really. Tasted a little hoppy with malt. A little bitter and had that dry aftertaste. Felt okay in the mouth and carbonation was right. All and all it was ok. Dont think I would make a session out of this one."
"Poured into a pint glass. Crystal clear light copper color with a beige head that fizzes out quickly. Toasty tangy malt aroma, with nothing else really. Flavor is similar, malty with a faint tanginess and a cereal grain finish. Light body with medium-high carbonation. Good drinkability but pretty watery and boring."
"Leinenkugel just gained this distribution in California, but I don't see much place in this market for such a beer. A step above the macro lagers, but California's craft brewers put this to shame. California already gets much better products aimed at the mass market from the Pacific Northwest. Definite pass."
"I bought a few 12 oz bottles to share with my son-in-law. I found this beer to average throughout. The appearance was , of course, reddish, and it did pour with a decent head. The smell and taste were okay but nothing spectacular. The mouthfell likewise was so-so. I would not add this to my favorites."
"D= Easy to drink with very average qualities for a craft beer. I like it."
"D- Fairly easy to drink. Just nothing to it."
"D: Drinkable, just nothing very special."
"D - Low on flavor and aroma, this is a half-way decent stab at a drinkable lager. This reminds me of Amber Bock or something...not really all that good, and not very flavorful, but better than a pale lager when you are at a restaurant or bar that doesn't carry craft brews."
"Got this in a Leinenkugel's variety pack given as a gift. Leinie's Red is an average red lager, that goes down quite easy, and won't fill you up much, but it is far from outstanding. Leinie's Red looks quite nice poured from the bottle, a light redish hue topped off by a nice head of foam, which dissipates after a couple sips. The malty smell is poorer than expected, even kind of rotten-ish. I prefer to not sniff it, and take it straight to the mouth, where it is all right, but nothing above average. A slight sour tasting lager, Red is easy drinking, but ultimately thin and without a lot of character."
"Poured from the bottle into a glass. Nice light amber color with minimal head and decent lacing. Sweet malty aroma that reminds me a little of licorice. The mouthfeel is full and smooth with an exceptional finish. The flavor is really nice. Sweet malts dominate the overall taste followed by a hint of hops. There is a slight watered down/thinness to the flavor, but not the body of this beer which is perplexing. Overall I do enjoy this lager much better than most of the standards that are out there. Leinenkugel has yet to disappoint me."
"Been years since I have had Leiny's Red but now after trying many different beers and coming back to Red, it is actually pretty good. Color is a dark copper with an impressive head and retention. The aroma is malt with a slight citrus component. The flavor is malty with a mild hop bitterness. It is a bit astringent with a metallic note. A bit overcarbonated but has a satisfying body. A better than average lager for sure. Nice alternative to the pale lagers and quite widely available in this area."
"Leinenkugel's Red is a very good introduction for a beer drinker who thinks Killian's is a good red. The beer is reddish brown in color, with a rapidly dissipating head. The beer is best cold, but it's extremely pleasant to drink a pitcher with some BW3's buffalo wings. The flavor is semi-astringent, bitterness mixed with grassy/metallic tracings. The mouthfeel is thin but hearty, in a weird way. You feel like you're drinking a very solid lager with excellent thirst-quenching abilities."
"Pours reddish with a lasting beige head. Smell is mostly slightly tart and sweet caramelly malt. Taste is actually quite hoppy up front and throughout, with a nice citrusy and lemony bittersweet caramel malt flavor. This was balanced, refreshing, and actually pretty enjoyable, surprisingly."
"Drinkability is fair, quite a substandard lager with too much carbonation, easy-to-drink but lacking in any creative or bold flavors"
"It does however have a nice drinkable balance to it. One of my go-to beers when trying to save some $ or picking up a 12er to bring for a crowd pleaser to a party."
"Bottle, Crimson pour and quite carbonated. Pretty good for Leiney's. I think this is a good deal better than their other mass produced beer Honey Weiss. I liked it something to get when you don't have alot of cash and don't want to buy the regular American Pale Lagers. Resonably priced and decent taste is a good combination."
"This is a pretty decent offering for the price. I made a session of five of these while watching a Cubs game yesterday, and it was fine for that. That being said, it did not endear itself to me so much that I would pick it over other offerings in the price range."
"Try it."
"Had a couple of these on the plane on the way home. A decent brew. Defenitely one to take on hiking trips (cans) in the summer. Pours an amber red color with pretty good head and lacing. Malty aroma. Taste is lagery crispness with a little boosted malt presence, some slight caramel maltishness, but very very faint. A good session brew, that is easily portable. Keep in mind this review may be flawed from drinking nothing but lager in South africa for the last two weeks. haha."
"This lager pours a clear red color with a weak beige head. The nose has some stale malts and not much else. The taste reminds me more of lager than red. Really light malts with some old hops. The body is watery and over carbonated. I had a few sips of this and dumped the rest out."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light and thin. Sharp and almost acrid carbonation. As far as Vienna Lagers go, give me a Boulevard Bob's '47"
"Went down smooth and satisfying. I'll be buying a sixer next time instead of a single."
"Not a bad lager, could have a bit more complexity. Pours a hardy rouge color with an OK head. Smells of little malts and maybe a floral hop in the very back. Tastes pretty clean with a mild malt and an even more mild hop character. Had it in a pint glass."
"Nice burnt red tone, with a finger or two of head space. Lite taste, little fruit taste, and bubbly. Goes down fast...I'll give it a whirl from time to time...for something refreshing this would work. I prefer my beers black, but I had to try a Leinies since I was in northern WI fishing."
"Not the greatest beer I've ever had -- and not one I'd ever purchase at a store. But it was a decent option from the crap that's generally available on a flight. Met my needs at the time."
"Poured a nice red color, with very little head and no lacing to speak of. Clean scent, a little sweet, but very weak. The taste was weak, as well, a nice mix of malts and hops, but very little in the way of defining character, other than a little bit of sweetness. Goes down fine, not the smoothest beer, but it's not rough, either."
"Poured a light cherry color that foamed a small white head that vanished fairly rapidly. Nose was kind of blah. Malts is about all you smell here. The flavor stayed the same throughout, no late bitterness or anything like that. This beer was soft, if you don't like bitterness or bite it might be easy drinking for you."
"Overall: You won't be thrilled, but you'll be refreshed."
"The drinkability is not so good, I will not need to drink this brew again. MK"
"This beer poured a brown color with a thick white head - tight bubbles. The aroma is faint and slightly floral. The taste is malty and a bit spicy. The mouthfeel is medium-light with a carbonation bite. This isn't a difficult beer to drink - but it isn't particularly interesting either."
"Not a bad beer, not a great beer or even a good beer, but it is an ok beer. Has a crisp hoppy taste with a bubbly punch to the tongue. The flavor is nothing extraordinary, and the smell is neither. Sort of bitter sweet in taste. Still it is an easy to drink beer and one worth more then one bottle of if it's available at some kind of social gathering."
"It's alright. I could drink it on occasion."
"Slight bitterness in the back of the throat, smooth maltiness across the palate at first. Yeast produces a vague fruity note. Light and a little watery, slight dextrinous sweetness, but easy drinking. Wouldn't refuse this under any circumstances, it's a bailout beer in many a crappy dive bar."
"Medium-bodied and a moderate level of carbonation. Not much to it but not offensive either. This beer defines average."
"There's a weird orange/red/brown color... Like I ate Those colors of Crayola Crayons then puked them into a glass. That's what the foam indicates also. I guess a burnt sienna crayon could be in there too. And I don't have a cold but still I can't smell much. Slight malt smell but very mild. Not much aroma at all. Not much taste, either. Very slight detection of sweet malt and that's about it. Not too bitter. It's easy to drink because it not much of anything. Leinenkugel makes better beers than this one. The Big Butt Dopplebock is pretty good and the Sunset Wheat's good but I won't get the red again. It's classified as a Vienna Lager but it's not even close to what a Vienna Lager should be. I'm going to try the Honey Weiss one right now."
"Red lagers are very good about taste. This one is no exception. This local brew is very good, like one of the most recent beer advocates Killians Irish Red is very much like leinenkugel's. the taste was average with little hints of hops with a smooth smell. It goes down smooth and little effort. It is again one of those beers I suggest if your in the area you will have to try and get a 12-pack."
"I am reviewing this beer after 3 weeks removed from drinking it so i cant say much except that i love red lagers and Killians is one of my favs. I give this a beer a 6 out of 10 in relation to that."
"12 oz bottle. Pours clear amber with 1.5 cm off-white head that is quickly diminishing. Aroma is very light and slightly sweet. Initial flavor is balanced with malts and hops, no distinct flavors, lightly flavored, pretty watered down. No real aftertaste. Light, watery body, no lacing, no alcohol noted. Drinkable as better than some domestics from macrobrewers, but would most likely need a gun to my head to drink it again."
"Pours an amber/red color with decent white head that hung around a while. Aroma is not real strong, but is a bit malty. Flavor doesnt really have any real strong dominant characteristics either. Mouthfeel is okay and lacing was light. Average beer that is easy drinking."
"This one pours a little red indeed. Mostly brown or auburn. Head is medium but won't stay around. You can smell hop and malts. Easy to drink but a little metallic or bitter. Easy to get and moderately priced. Still better than macros; taste is unique to me."
"Taste is slightly grainy, slightly bitter. Fairly balanced with no particular part of it standing out. On the downside, no particular part of this beer is worthy of standing out. A good, if not overwhelming lager."
"Pours an amber with minimal head. A virtually non-existent nose. Taste seemed to have a somewhat apple tone and I felt there was a thick syrupy finish that stays on the mouth. It's easily drinkable and certainly is a good session beer with a smooth mouthfeel - though I wouldn't pine for the day to be seeing it in the store for me to buy. Best when fresh like I got it, I'm glad this was the alternative to Bud & Bud Light on my flight (Northwest Airlines)."
"Drinkability: Excellent. This beer can go with almost anything and is enjoyable pretty much all the time. Dinner, a ballgame, or a nice long bar session at the end of the week. This is what a blue-collar Wisconsin beer should be (not the plagues of Miller, Pabst, Schlitz and Pabst)."
"I wonder how this tasted before Miller got their hands on it.."
"Anyway, despite the above negatives.... seriously check out this brew on color alone.... I have no Idea how they can pack that much color into such an otherwise average brew."
"I poured a cold Red into a pilsner style glass and enjoyed a light, sweet smell. After sniffing the beer I wanted to drink it immediately. It poured a nice two finger head with plenty of lacing. The taste was not as sweet as the smell, but it was nice and smooth with good mouth feel. The after taste was a little hoppier than I had expected, but it was nice. I don't have a lot of experience with Red Ales, but I know that I liked this one and would definitely reach for it again."
"Comes out a crystal clear orange copper color with a light tan head that doesnt dwindle away too fast; after the heads settles down into a thin layer you begin to see some mild lacing -theres very little carbonation. It does smell sweet and has a mild scent of caramel but I didnt smell anything resembling hops. It has a sharp slightly bitter taste but it is smooth and it has a sweet hoppy flavor in its aftertaste. Its got a fairly light body but full of flavor overall Id have to say this is Leinekugels best, but I havent tried them all yet."
"D - This beer is easy to drink could be a session beer"
"Pours an orangey color.Aroma is average nothing to brag about there.Taste has corn but there is also a hint of sweetness.I would recommend this beer to my friends and I would buy it if I came across it again.This is a much better offering than their honey weiss!!"
"Overall this is one of Leinies better beers and can be mixed with several other Leiny products for many different tastes."
"Pours a nice crisp amber with a decent off-white head. Decent caramel aroma with a hint of earthy citrus hops. The taste is not what the aroma advertised, in fact, there doesn't seem to be much to the taste at all, some maltiness, but the color seems to be the only thing distinguishing it from a normal macro lager. The beer is light bodied, but that doesn't really matter with the lack of flavor. This one will make for a moderately decent nightcap at best."
"Drinkability- An average red that I would drink again but I would not go out of my way."
"drinkability is good. not much here, just malts and a touch of grassy hops."
"Pours red...go figure. .25"" head ...whispy.. poor retention.. taste... pretty good... definately some decent roasted malt here.. A little bitter... some hops detectable..nicengrassy..caramel..a 'thankfully not worse' metallic hint..all these flavors are subdued... like the mouthfeel.... This is a decent fall brew... just a chill in the air...with an easy drinkin red to keep you goin.... suprisingly for 4.9... both in taste and flavor... for an accessible brew(at least in the midwest)... you could do worse.."
"Like others Ive had from Leiny, this is a good session beer, and one I could probably drink several of on a hot sumer day, but not one to just sit and enjoy."
""
"Not bad, not great. If you compare it to macro lagers or other Miller products even then it's a pretty damn fine beer to have under their belt but as far as Vienna lagers go it's a little bit unimpressive."
"Overall, a pretty good dark amber with good flavors. Satisfying and easy to drink, but only slightly above ordinary. By Leinenkugel's standards, its good."
"Not a great beer, not a horrible one either. I think I can sum this beer up with one word 'meh.'"
"No hops, no malt...once again, almost like drinking carbonated water that looked like good beer."
"D- Fairly drinkable, but not complexity to really enjoy."
"better lagers- and yet another choice for a good session brew. Decent."
"overall this is a good beer, better on tap than any other serving styles ive had this in"
"The flavor is as you might expect based on the aroma, and it's subtle caramel character blends quite well with its delicate floral and grassy hops. The bitterness is restrained, and needs to be, because there's really not that much malt here... just a tiny step above a standard American macro lager. It finishes dry with some residual hoppiness and a quick fading note of malt."
"I had this beer on tap at Maury's Tiny Cove in Cheviot, OH. It goes great with a cheeseburger and fries. This is the beer that inspired me to give homebrewing a try. It has a nice zip, is flavorful and has a crisp finish. The is the definitive Red Lager. Well done Leinenkugel!"
"It's hard to make a well balanced red ale; the hops usually get in the way of the malt or they're not present at all, and when balance is achieved it's usually way heavier than the style is supposed to be. I am amazed that I am saying this, but Leinenkugel's, a subsidiary of Miller Brewing Company, has made an *excellent* example of the style with their red. Not servicable, not decent, excellent."
"This had a distinct caramel taste, like Killian's, but not as strong. A pretty easy drinking beer, but a warning: Drink only if you know you are in a distribution region, or you may be drinking an old beer that didn't sell well....my mistake the first time I tried it. There was a slight bite to it, not quite bitter, more like a sour bite. Probably the breakdown of the sugar in it. I would recommend this, but try to drink close to the source (Wisconsin). This has a color slightly lighter than Killian's, but not as strong or sweet tasting. Still, a halfway decent lager. It doesn't have that flat taste that the big brewers have, but it doesn't have the kick that most craft beers have. Comparable to Heineken in taste."
"Easy to drink Red copper color, I dont know if I would go out of my way to find it, but alas, free to me beer is beer indeed. Really, cause yeah, its interesting enough, but doesnt wow me."
"Drinkability - Tastes similar to a Killians, but is easier for me to drink. Started as a little bitter, but after the 3rd or 4th sip became really smooth. Not very strong, but nice beer to drink while watching a game on tv."
"It pours a nice deep orange color, with a creamy small white head. It has a nice aroma of toasty malts. It is slightly bitter to the tongue at first, and mellows into nice malt overtones. It is pretty well balanced, but may be slightly on the bitter side (which I actually prefer). It leaves a wonderful aftertaste of toasty malty vanilla flavor. It isn't extremely drinkable, but you can definitely put down a few of these in one sitting. Overall not bad, and well worth trying if you haven't had it yet."
"This is a crisp beer that starts off slightly bitter and mellows into creamy vienna malt goodness with a nice toasty undertone. There is a very soft wisp of hop in the finish. This is an extremely soft, smooth, and balanced beer. This is probably the best Vienna Lager I have had, althought I'd have to put it up against Negra to see for sure."
"Drinks allright, a blast, from the past, the classic crossover beer. I wonder if it was any better before miller got their hooks in. Had it back in the mid 90s & it tasted about the same"
"Nice head and retention that stays for a while. The smell is nice and present, but a little weird. Thin on the malts and hops aren't very good. Average taste but a little bit of an astringent dryness that isn't very pleasant at all. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. I could drink this beer easily, but the wateriness would make me search for something else readily available."
"A very simple beer, but tasty, and very cheap - around here is the same price of Buds and Millers, and definitely a lot better."
"Poured beer from bottle into a pint glass, beer is golden amber in color with an off-white foamy head. Smell is sweet, mostly of crystal malt. The beer is well balanced with an initial malty taste, followed by a hoppy, dry finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, creamy. Overall, this beer is a definitely drinkable and for the price its a pretty good value."
"drinkability: quaffer"
"I remember this being a better beer but it drinks like something that was rushed. Goes down easy but without much good flavor."
"."
"D: Don't think I'd get this again, not very fresh tasting. pretty unimpressive"
"Overall a decent beer, but not one I'll go out of my way for again."
"This beer isn't bad, but there's not much to recommend. It has the backbone of something good, but appears to have been ""dumbed down"" for mass appeal."
"Overall not a bad macro offering, similar to a Genny Red. A flavorable alternative to BMC. Thanks to makeitavintage for this one."
"D- It is much better than most of the Macro reds but has no game for the craft variety this is styled after. Very drinkable as it doesn't offend the taste buds but there are better choices for a night out enjoying brews with friends."
"I'd recommend this beer if you want to try an easy going, light-bodied amber brew."
"I said, why not, I enjoyed the Big Butt from Leinenkugel. I just did not enjoy this one, especially compared to the other Vienna lagers i've enjoyed lately. It is crisp and rather light with a malty characteristic, just not my thang. Do not recommend this one."
"Pours a reddish amber color topped by a small amount of creamy white head that quickly subsides to a thin ring, leaving some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of light roasted malt with a touch of adjunct funkiness, and not much else. Palate is roasted malt blended with adjunct, and some kinda harsh hops for balance. Still, pleasant for a mass-produced lager. Body is sturdy, if a touch foamy. I could see drinking a few of these if options were slim up in Wisconsin or similar locales. Not a bad beer, really. It is what it is."
"D - It is a descent lager. It certainly isn't my favorite Lenie but it will work."
"After drinking quite a few of Leinenkugel's brews lately, I didn't hold out much hope for the Red, but I found myself liking it. A little hopped up for the style, but it hides a lot of would-be flaws. Toasted malts give a rich, but mild malt sweetness, caramel, and toasty flavors. Feels a little less than creamy or smooth, but not watery either. Finish is a little malty sweet, but offset by the added hops. A simple, but solid brew."
"Drinkability is good as well."
"Poured a reddish orange , clear , with a thin and quikly dissipating white head. Smell is slightly malty , with just a bit of spicy hop in there. Taste is not bad , a little thin. Some caramel malt taste , slight hop. Better than killians and other big brewery reds ive had and wotrh a try , just not quite enough flavor for me."
"The color is an attractive shade somewhere between red and amber. Head body is creamy and thick, with an average height. Aroma is of sweet malt with light touches of toastiness and caramel. Taste is sugary sweet, with lightly toasted and caramel malts. Better flavors are overun by the sweetness that is too strong and somewhat cloying. This is average accross the board."
"I wanted to like this beer. I really did. The Leinenkugel's culture, marketing, packaging, etc., was so appealing. But in the end, the ""book"" didn't live up to its ""cover."" Pale, reddish color (reminded me of strawberry soda) with minimal head. A bit spritzy and thin in the mouth. The taste, at first, was rather benign; but as the glass wore on, I noted a strong alcohol taste that seemed to overpower it all. Not something I'd recommend. I still have extremely high hopes for the other Leinie's products. I'm a Leinie's Lodge member, after all. I can't wait to visit Wisconsin and see if all their beers taste better in its home state."
"All in all I didn't think this was a bad beer. It poured a nice reddish color with about an inch of foam at the top that didn't stick around for very long. I got some citrusy hints from the smell, but couldn't pick up much else. Overall taste was pretty good. Not spectacular, but not horrible. A not too strong bitter finish on the beer made me want to keep coming back. The mouthfeel was very light at first and then gave way to some noticeable carbonation. On the whole, drinkability is pretty good. There's other beers I'd choose first, but I would still take this if given the chance."
"What can I say but that this is Killian's little brother who tags along and pretends he's all grown up too. And I guess he is, if we can call a beer a he and give it human charateristics and wants, but he isn't brash enough to put up a billboard proclaiming ""savoRED."" It's not as baritone (I know, I make non-beer comparisons, but I'm an intuitist at heart.) as his pseudo-Irish brother from Budskiland or wherever it is Big Red is from but this little bird sings just as loud and for a few pennies less. Plus it has an indian as its emblem and what says beer like a stoic-faced injun? Three cross bows and a pouch of wampum."
"A common step-up beer a Milwaukee church festivals famous for featuring Miller Lite. This brew pours red in those plastic church cups with a light head with a lager flavor. Red is a great beer with brat and cheese curds. It cuts the fat of these foods with a refreshing finish. A good fill in beer in a pinch until you get to your favorite pub for your top brew."
"Pours a coppery red. What head forms quickly dissipates quickly. Smell-wise, caramel and sweet malts dominate with some traces of floral hops. As far as taste goes, its nothing real complex, just sweet up front with a very light cirtus finish from the malts. It's a little too thin and lightbodied for my tastes, but its highly drinkable and is not bad for a Leine's. There's better Vienna Lagers out there, Negra Modelo and Bohemia come to mind, but Leine's Red is a decent, abiet average, beer."
"I'd probably still not pass one up if offered one (or more)."
"Not a bad Leine's."
"As with other Leine's, a smooth, easy drinking brew that trades fullness of flavor for easy of drinking."
"D- Better than Killian's Red, but that is not saying much is it. I guess my point is, if you are going to brew this style it can't be strip filtered and perhaps pasteurized. Lacks that malty lager freshness. Not bad but nothing to go out of your way for."
"Drinkability - Not as poor as many of Leinie's products. The flavor is not bad on this beer, but doesn't match up to the standards for a dunkel. I'd drink this before most large brewery products. I would not, however, buy this if I wanted a dunkel."
"Easy enough to drink, but nothing special. My memories of this beer are much better than the beer itself..."
"A simple beer. but man, what a good tasting one."
"The beer poured a vibrant amber color with a medium thickness tan head that lasted a few minutes. The aroma is of caramel but balanced out somewhat with some hop bitterness. The taste is a bit of caramel with some citrus notes and a touch of bitterness but not overpowering. This is a very drinkable beer as it is fairly light and refreshing."
"Clear red with a bit of an orange hue, topped by a thin skim of white foam. Sweet caramel in the aroma, along with some bitey, herbal hops. Light bitterness, not enough to balance the sweetness. Very mild citrus and floral hops make a brief appearance. Herbal character lingers. The body is light, but feels a bit syrupy yet dries the palate. Quite strange and not appealing to me at all."
"I can see why so many people drink this beer. Its non offensive and gets the job done. Mouthfeel is a bit thin yet creamy. It beats the hell out of any macro."
"Drinkability: Very, very drinkable, an excellent session beer. There are better Vienna lagers out there, but this is always reliable, cheap, and easy to find. People don't give Leinie's enough credit."
"This is what I figure Budweiser should taste like but doesn't. I was back to my original happy hour grounds in Detroit last month and savored Leinenkugel for three weeks. It is not available in my current hometown of San Diego; Red Trolley there is similar tasting. Strangely enough, I learned that Red Trolley is brewed in Wisconsin where Leinenkugel is from and trucked to Calif."
"Leinenkugel's Red is the first member of the J. Leinenkugel family I ever tried, and still enjoy occasionally. Any of which are excellent values at no more than $6 a six pack, and far better than any six pack I've found at that price. Readily available at practically every grocer and liquor store around, Leine's Red pours a dark crimson with little or no head that quickly gives way to a miniscule amber-hued lace. A little over-carbonated for my liking, although does not take away from the light bouqet of fruit and citrus flavors. Light mouthfeel, finishes clean with a crisp aftertaste."
"Pours a brownish orange hue, with great clarity. Dense one finger head with decent retention and weak lacing. Toasted munich malt and caramel aromas but no hops. Sweet upfront, like toffe and amber malt. Balanced well with a semi-dry and hoppy aftertaste; but this faux german hop flavor becomes stale and harsh in the finish. Light body and lively carbonation soften the mouthfeel but the offensive hop flavor ruins the drinkability."
"I had a really enjoyable beer, here. I was lucky to score it as part of a 12-pack Lieney's sampler case for $9.99. I would seek itbeer out again in the future; especially for a price in that range."
"Pours a nice amber color. Head quickly went into a weak lace. Has a strong lager smell. Lots of carbination. Light mouthfeel. Has a bit of a spice/friut flavor that was intresting. Bit of a edge to the finish. One of those beers that you might try once and a while, but not run out to buy."
"Drinkability- This is a rich enough dunkel without being too heavy. This makes a nice session brew. Reccomeded, espescially if you're in search of a tasty beer on a budget."
"I'm not saying this is a great beer, but I surely think it's better than the average reviewer here will admit. I'm able to score this consistantly for $8.47 per 12-pack, so I'm also slightly partial for the amazing value. It pours as many average beers pour, has a reddish hue of course, very thin and clear. It has a nicely balanced malty character which actually gives it some flavor, unlike some of Leinie Red's other family members. Nothing challenging, nothing groundbreaking, but c'mon, we're talking about a Vienna-style lager here. And a pleasantly drinkable one at that."
"Eh. That is how I feel about this beer. Its apperance is average, red, like I would expect from an Irish Red, nothing really stands out from the flavor except that its body is watery. The finish is crisp and clean but leaves you desiring something. Same goes for the drinkability, you can drink it, but after awhile I forgot that I was drinking a beer."
"I tasted this beer, and many others on the SS Badger ferry boat traveling from Michigan to Wisconsin. Although it was served in a plastic cup, which lowered it appearance and possibly it aroma scores, I found this to be a very drinkable offering. Poured a crystal clear red, with a slight grassiness to the otherwise malty nose. Nice flavor with slight roasty notes. The body is crisp and sweet. The finish is dry and short."
" Nothing special but easy to drink."
"A cult favorite, this beer is really popular in Wisconsin where I lived for a while. The appearance is translucent copper in color, a nice sized head of foam head that lasts a good while, and leaves some lace. Aroma contains medicinal herbs, malt, and dextrose  resulting in a sharp experience on the tongue that gradually mellows. The body is medium, dry on the palate, and leaves a slightly unpleasant aftertaste  and not much desire to repeat the experience."
"Clear amber pour with a moderate head. Not much lacing. Aroma is of caramel and a little weak. Taste has that caramel malty sweetness in it and some Euro style hops seem to be there as well, but they're a bit on the weak side. Finish is momentary and forgetable. Nothing inspirational here but nothing to scoff at either. Just a simply somewhat decent beer that could easily be sessioned given the flavor, alcohol content, thinnish body, and most importantly price. Worth a try."
"The beer poured a rich amber with a nice tan head, The presentation left you saying now that's what a beer should look like. The aroma was of sweet malt. The taste was big malt taste with just the right hop finish. The feel was medium and creamy. I happened to find myself in a Bennigan's in Elgin, IL and looking through the taps I saw this one. Being the only beer I hadn't heard of I had to taste it. I had gone through two before I knew it. I had to think long and hard before getting a Hacker-Pschorr HW for the finale. I was quite impressed and can't wait to get back and sample this fine beer again."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer has a clear amber color with a medium sized head. The aroma is sweet, malty, and just a little fruity. The flavor starts out caramel sweet. There are some fruity berry flavors. The finish is hoppy and bitter, but there is an off-flavor in the finish, like soap. Light to medium mouthfeel. I thought this beer was ok, not flavorless like other reviewers have described it, but still not a great beer."
"Pours a ruby amber color with an average looking head that doesnt last very long. It has a strong ""red"" hop smell paired with carmelized malts. It tastes great. Has a nice bite to it, but not too overpowering. This one could definitly hold its own against counterparts like Killians or Smithwicks. The mouthfeel is almost creamy, not heavy-bodied by any means, but not too thin either. Very nice job on this one, one of my favorites."
"Dark reddish amber with an off-white (slightly reddish?), large, rocky head that stayed a for a little while and left some lacing early. Aroma is a little sweet with light hops and mild caramel maltiness over a bit of an adjunct stink. Taste is grainy and bland with a short, slightly bitter finish. Not bad really, but nothing really noteworthy. Thin body, watery texture, average carbonation. Nothing special, but still enjoyable for what it is, a reasonably-priced break from the norm."
"The beer pours a reddish/amber color with a 1/4"" offwhite head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry lager yeast scent along with a weak caramel malt aroma. It smells like a weaker Killian's. The taste is decent also. It has a sweet caramel malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and grainy. It has a bit of an aftertaste that lingers. It's a bit musty and bitter. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average drinking red lager. It is weak in aroma and taste as well as mouthfeel. It's one and done for me."
"I don't agree with this beer beign classified as a Munich Dunkel Lager. I looked back at my reviews and this beer is far from any of those. Color is RED, with a small creamy off-white head. Smells slightly sweet and carmely, not very strong. Taste is also very light and creamy. Light grassy malts and slight sweetness. Maybe this is a munich dunkel, but who cares? It is an unimpressive, underpowered beer in any sense of the word."
"Yet another bottle of cheap Wisconsin beer unfortunately. The appearance is very unimpressive, there was some head, but the beer itself looked watery with very little lace. The smell was almost non-existance, other than a slightly unpleasant odor. Tastewise is was undrinkable, watery, sour (not in a good hops sour way either), with little taste what so ever except for an after taste that made you want to dump out the rest of the beer. Which is exactly what I did. I don't recommend this to anyone."
"This beer was drinkable, but it didn't do a whole lot for me. This is in the same vein as Killian's, but that seems to have more flavor than this brew. I could take or leave this ""red"" beer."
"A pleasant and inexpensive beer, a good everyday type beer."
"Drinkability: It's a relatively thin, sweet, smooth beer that's can be drank in succession. The attractive price and good drinkability make this beer one I'd definitely recommend anyone try."
"Pours light amber, redish (suprise) Leaves some nice lacing. Not much nose detected. Lightly flavored, malt, slight burnt flavor, chalky and dry finish. Light, redish beer, not really much going on with this one. Another middle of the road, slightly better then Macros brew from Leiny. Pass it by, you/we can do better then this limp and lame stuff."
"Good red color, but the cap seemed ""loose", kind of affecting the carbonation. Not a disaster however. Smooth with a slight hoppy tinge, this was a good beer for eating with. Went down too quick, when I looked up I had finished four. Now that's a good beer!"
"Easy drinking lager, overall, and crisp and refreshing in the right circumstances. Not very complex, with a sweet malt dominance. Worth a try, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Poured a clear reddish-copper color with a short-lived foamy white head. Left a little patchy lacing on the glass. Mildly malty aroma. Taste was slightly sweet malt with just enough hops that you know they're there. Slightly tart finish. Mouthfeel was on the thin side. Good drinkability - goes down smooth, no off tastes. Easily the best ""Leinie"" I've tried so far, and really not a bad beer at all."
"Appearance: Caramel amber tone with an off white two finger sized head leaves nice lacing not a bad appearance from this brew. Aroma: Slight toasted malts smooth somewhat bland sweetness here. Taste: Clean amber alger typical grainy sweetness very slight bitterness not much to the flavor of this beer. Mouthfeel: Very mild brew lighter body strong carbonation. Drinkability: Easy going effortless not challenging to my senses in anyway not too enjoyable for me."
"Overall--a nice session and not bad for stepping above the usual crap. I like it, but it's not perfect."
"This is a half step above the mainstream lagers."
"Leinenkugel Red is one of Leinie's better beers, second only to Creamy Dark, but isn't one that I'll be coming back to."
"12 oz. amber bottle. Poured a reddish-brown in appearance, with a bustling white head that lasts briefly. No lacing. Tough to pick out any distinct aroma, but finally some malts decided to show up. Flavor is more of the same...a rather uninspired attempt at an amber. Others have commented on a chemical-like flavor and I also noticed something amiss in the flavor. Malty sweet and not well-balanced. Finishes with nothing on the palate, like it just disappears. Mouthfeel and drinkability are par for the course. There's just nothing about this beer that stood out and kept me coming back for more. Any beer that often gets compared to against Kilian's can't be good. Pass."
"Medium dark amber body with a cottony white head. Smells of cereal-tinged amber malts. Not much hop presence at all (not surprised, this is a Leinie's product). Tastes of sweetish malts with a light cookie-dough flavor. Hops, again, are minimal and don't add much at all to the taste. Leinie's manages to produce another lager that is definitely better than it's parent company's lagers (Miller), but still too bland, mild, and run-of-the-mill. Could/should be better"
"Final Thoughts: Can be had cheap (some one always has this on sale for $3.99 or less a six). Different than the macros its easy to see why this could be popular. Around here at footbal parties it gives the impression you are a fine beer drinker, when in reality the person drinking this is not, he is only drinking it because it is Red."
"Appears as a dark amber / slightly red color. Good head but didn't hold all that long. Smell was underwhelming, but still pleasant. I couldn't discern any particular scent to describe it with. Taste is decent but nothing spectacular. Slightly on the dry side, but still pleasant. Mouth feel was on the lighter side, but not offensive. Overall I think its a pretty good lager that could be consumed en masse' if you so choose. Nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing to shy away from if you're just looking for a cold one."
"Maybe...there's always the next one..."
"this is what i call a transition beer. a beer that is easy to drink and will tell people that there is more to beer than macros."
"Leinie's Red pours out to a dark amber in the glass with a very slight head. The smell is slightly sweet, with the faint whiff of malted milk balls hugging Wonder Bread on the nose. The taste is pretty good. Very thin, but some malt character and a slight caramel sweetness comes to the forefront. Is it world-class? Hell no. But it was a fun, easy to drink, red/amber beer in a cheap-beer serving locale."
"I've been a bit underwhelmed by this line of beers, but the red is the best by far. Pours a reddish amber (big surprise) with a moderate head. Aroma is pretty nondescript. Flavor is malty with a bit of acidic tangyness. Light but adequate hopping. Not much in the way of a stand alone beer, but a good background beer for food."
"Having it on draft makes it taste slightly improved over the bottled version. I would like to report I tasted a bit more malty profile, but the establishment poured it into a danged frozen glass. I suspect this obviates Miller from having to come out with a ""Miller Dark," for which we should all be grateful."
"This was a pretty good beer. A nice amber hue with a decent head on top of it. It had a nice matly taste with some hops to back it up. The mouthfeel was light but it had a great consitensy and great carbonation. Definitely a beer to get when you don't know what to get."
"Tried this on tap recently. Not much to say....deep red color with a tired, short-lived head. Aroma is mostly hops, but not a strong smell. Foretaste is grain and aftertaste is very faint hop bitterness. There's just not a lot going on here. This is a common, uninteresting brew."
"Reddish brown color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet, touch grainy. Slightly malty, slightly hoppy, caramelized malts. Nice flavor. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is not very hoppy, crisp with a slight bitterness. Simple beer, but for some reason I like it."
"ng"
"Lackluster Red. Pours a nice clear reddish-copper color in a appearance with a creamy light tan head. That's as good as it gets. Odd malt aroma. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Taste consists of lightly toasted malt, with some hints of caramel. The finish has an unpleasant grainy texture and flavor to it. I don't even think I'd reccommend this vs other macro reds, such as Killians."
"Pours an average red color with some head, but it didn't last though that may have been from my glass. not much of a smell to it, just average beer smell that my dorm smelled like last year. pretty good tastenot too extordinary in any way, but it goes down easy and enjoyable so i'd recomend it if you're looking to save a couple bucks and have a halfway decent beer."
"This brew poured a medium sized white head of fine to large bubbles and left no lacing as it receded. It has a very mild malty aroma and a transparent light brown body with carbonation. There is a slight initial bite in the flavor and it is a bit fizzy. There is a typical ""red"" flavor to it that I can't put into words. This is a nice brew, but nothing to write home about."
"Color is a nice dark amberish brown tinted, thin crowned glass of loose yogurt-like off-white head, some lacing begins to stick in spots as it becomes consumed. Smell is nearly nonexistent, a barely there sweet sense of malt and maybe corn grain. Taste is limpid sweet malts, unbalanced approach in light floral hop, it has some corn huskyness or raw grass notes and light metallicness in its quality of drying in the finish. Blah, blah, blah, no, bling, bling, bling, thinner than most ""reds""/dunkel but not by much in some standards of how this style is suppose to be. Needs a boost in every aspect, and I'm suspect of the color, that too may be artificial; as in coloring."
"Deep auburn brown , medium head, quickly fading. Unexpected fruity aroma. Smooth and delicate taste. However, finishes with an acidic bitterness which lingers. Traces of hops, but just a tad. Linnys is again close to a good beer, but their constant attempt to distinguish themselves with their unique taste, leaves this beer in a class by itself. Unfortunatly it is a class I prefer not to frequent."
"Recomended...."
"This beer poured a ruby amber orange color. Head was large and dense. Beer has a pungent grain and malt aroma. Very light in body, almost watery, with not much body. Has a breadiness to it. Yeasty dough with some fruitiness. Theres a hop bitterness there, too. This is an easy drinking, dry and fairly tasty lager but nothing spectacular."
"Taste is malty sweet, but isn't very complex or deep. It's pretty drinkable, feels a little heavy in the mouth, lowers drinkability a notch but still a decent beer."
"This brew poured a medium head that quickly dissolved. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass. It had a nice aroma to it. There was carbonation in this brew. It had a slight bitter taste to it. I was not overly impressed with this particular brew."
"A reasonably solid ""red"" lager. Creamy head, medium to thin bodied. Big malty flavor but more or less straight forward and not terribly exciting. No real balance to the beer as it just has a wet malty taste through the finish. It's OK, but there's nothing standout about this beer from cracking the bottle to the last sip. Not a bad beer to use as a party brew -- pretty cheap and probably better than most things that a lot of folks have lying around."
"Looks can be deceiving. I really like the look of Leinie's labeling, this being a nicely done red. An added bonus was the initial look of this pour that was very appealing. A great deep amber with traces of red and very well formed tan head. Some retention and very light lacing. First hint of trouble came from the aroma, or lack thereof, since this has little nose. Some light malting and small sense of hops. Flavor of malt was only slightly balanced. Worse was an odd husk flavor and over use of adjuncts. Oddly chemical-like as the beer warmed; almost a lacquer sense. Not enjoyable to finish, I probably trusted this beer too much and should have had it more deeply chilled."
"If they could reduce the chemical/adjunct presence, this would be a much better beer. Still, sometimes this is the best beer some nonbeer bars in the Midwest carry."
"Notes. A bit odd for a red beer, this would be confused for a simple lager, this beer lacks body."
"Leinie's Red is solid enough to stand on its own merits. Loses points for a fully diminishing head. Malty, yet well-balanced. Unfortunately for this label, but fortunately for beer lovers, the ""Red"" pseudo-style fad is behind us. Could have more carbonation. Better tasting than most of the Reds."
"I sought this brew out for the bottle was a 135th anniversary, so if I were to try it, nows the time. It poured a beautiful red color with a massive off-white head that settled to a full coverage film. Lace is good for the first half of the brew. The aroma is of slight barley malt and a note of sourness. The taste is the same with the mouth left tart. The body of this brew is weak, for after about 15 min., the brew waters down. Other BAs have said don't let it sit and I agree. Also colder is better for a crisp start for thisone. Mine was 55 and could of helped with 10 cooler. I will buy this again, around Thankgiving for a non-pumpkin autumn offering.( Indian labeled bottle )"
"It has been a while since I had one of these. Pours a red-amber color with a minimal head that fades to nothing fast. Left just an island of flat head floating in the center of my glass. Deep malty aroma, sweet with a faint scent of mollasses. Taste is more bitter than I thought it would be since I didn't really smell a lot of hop presence. Where are the malts I smelled? This beer just doesn't seem right--almost sour. I won't be drinking this again anytime soon."
"tasts average, pretty sweet an little bitterness. A thin mouthfeel with a little carbonation sting on the tounge."
"I consider this a pretty good red lager. The color is a nice dark amber with average head. The smell and taste are mostly malty with the hops taking a far backseat. I enjoy this beer, but it seems a little too thin. I think Killian's does this style better."
"beautiful amber color which pours out a thin head.  slight malty nose with a hint of hoppiness.  the malt flavor is pretty thin,  leaving me with a watery aftertaste.  it slides down pretty good but so does water.  i've had all the brews from leinie's before, and upon revisiting a couple of them, i remember why i waited so long to review them.   because they suck."
"I decided to give this beer a second try, and yes, I did like it better this go-a-round but I still dont find it outstanding. Id drink it again without complaining!"
"Bright amber, very red color indeed. Pour produces a thick, foamy tan head. Not much noticable smell wise, some decent malt smells. Very beer like. Taste is always pleasant to me, malty, slighltly thin on the hops, but very decent. I always thought it was a amber ale, not a dark lager, that shows you what I know. Bigger bodied than you would think.But with a wierd tongue coating slime, if you live it sit too long.  I haven't tried the others in the Leinekugel line, but I would give them a try. I used to drink these all the time in college, they were always a $1.00."
"Not a bad beer, and used to be one of my favorites when I thought this was ""microbrew exotic"".  Pale red in color with almost non-existent head.  The aroma was slightly sweet, although it was not malt, more of a corn/grain sweetness.  The flavor was more of the same with slight hops appearing at the end of the flavor to give the lager taste.  From Leine's offerings, I like the Original and Creamy Dark better.  Not a bad beer for a change from the macro lagers and because of the high availability, can be found at most of the same places for the same price."
"Leinenkugels Red Lager is not a watered down and over carbonated red Beer. Good Beer taste with pleasant mouth feel, the only thing I would want more of is alcohol, I think this Beer is a bit light in that regard."
"I liked this one almost as much as Killian's. Similar color and flavor but this one seemed a little more carbonated but that may be because I had it in a keg. If I was having a Leinie I would take the Creamy Dark hands down."
"A long enjoyable evening drinking Lenie’s Red, which really grew on me over the course of the night.  It is reddish, with a nice head that was lost fairly quickly.  This had the malt taste that is typical, but I kept noticing an assertive hops flavor that was as surprising as it was enjoyable.  Very crisp, drinkable and refreshing for its style (thanks to the hops)."
"Light red in hue and typically clear.  The head is poorly retained, leaving an unimpressive and thin layer.  Odd metallic, sharp husky grain notes in aroma.  The hop nose is paltry. Tastewise this beer is expectedly bland, but there are no outright flaws.  Sugary corn sweetness is prominent, but not overbearing.  There's no way this brew is all barley malt. It's very thin in body, and malt flavors are lacking.  That being said, this is the epitomy of the style.  Leinenkugel's red is bland and the color serves only for asthetic purposes."
"I like this style of beer,drink alot of this on tap in the summer just as good as killians I think.Nothin special but I like it."
"Perfect amber color with a frothy white head that has some retention.  Slight caramel malt notes detected in the nose.  Pretty clean taste.  Just a tad musty.  Hop taste is negligible.  Nothing distinctive about this brew.  Tastes like a macro."
"Drink better."
"""Leinies"" try hard but just don't seem to measure up (try a Creamy Dark, its too obvious and one dimensional in its ""chocolate"" approach)...the Red is the same, a little tangy and granular but thin overall, mouthfeel suffers the most...a Winter Lager that they used to do was one of their best, real spice notes brought on by complexity -- but more lately, they seem to be focusing on fewer offerings. The Red just dissappears off your tongue..."
"Just a basic run of the mill red...not a lot of flavor, but some maltiness tries to fight its way out..Easy drinking..I thought this was better than Killians but I'm not sure right now...It's not bad, but it's pretty non-descript..creamy finish..Last time I tried it I thought it had more hopping than Killians and a unique taste..I get very little hops out of this one.."
"An average red, nothing more, nothing less...yawn. Not bad if the choices are limited. It'll suffice in a pinch."
