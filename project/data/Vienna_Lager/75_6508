2.89,-0.7,3.25,3,2.75,2.75,3,"Bottle poured into a standard pint glass in Cabo San Lucas. A light coppery brown color with a will o' the wisp of a white frothy head. Aroma is a muted caramel sweetness, corn bread, and white grape fruity notes. Inoffensive and thankfully lacking an obvious DMS element. Still has that inescapable macro-lager smell though. Body falls squarely in the moderate range, with excessive carbonation. Taste is a smooth light corn bread sweetness coupled with the subtle grape notes from the nose. Minimal hop aroma or flavor. I do get a sultana raisin sweet dried fruit note here and there. Finishes fairly dry, with a grainy astringency and a few metallic off-flavors. Rather pedestrian brew unfortunately, even if it does represent the vestiges of a rather cool Austrian/German brewing tradition. This one plays it overly safe and still manages to hit a few bum notes.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 30, 2014"

I will buy Vienna Lager, as indicated on this site, but it was not clean. I was also getting Minhas-like notes of bubble gum and dry cleaning plant. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the taste was oddly unique or should I say uniquely odd? It had a slightly medicinal quality underlying the utterly sweet malt flavor. It was sugary with a tang of hospital sterilization, if that can be quantified by anyone else. Warming, I was getting a kind of peanut taste. WTF?!? The finish was semi-sweet with the melange of off flavors getting the better of the malt, but not in any kind of good way.

Out of the bottle the beer had a great dark amber color with a perfectly white head to accent the beer. Unfortunately, the head had no staying power - dissipates ting very fast and leaving no lacing to speak or write about. I was very disappointed with the coppery scent of the beer and was wary to actually drink it, but was surprised at the decent flavor and mouthfeel. Overall, if you can get past the weird odor, Victoria is pretty decent.","jjamadorphd","Mar 22, 2014"

For a Vienna Lager there are definitely better beers that you can find from Mexico. If you're looking for something similar I would suggest maybe Indio, Negra Modelo or Bohemia. Those have more flavor than this. Plus, I've seen these sell for about $26.99 for a 24 pack; an insane price for the quality that you get.","Weston19","Dec 05, 2013"

We've all heard the stories of the clear Corona bottles, however in Mexico Corona is distributed in brown bottles, making the overall taste a little better. Sure its not PtY, but then again this is America, a place where all things merge together to form pieces of art, like Fusion Cuisine or Megan Fox, making our land a canvas for craft brewers. So when I saw the ads for this beer I was extremely happy. Sure I didn't see an amazing craft brew, but I saw a new standard of Cerveza in the states. Go try one for yourself and be sure to have a good time with a little Jugo de Sanchez mix, or some lemon and salt.

The liquid is a blend of browns and yellows based in orange, has a metallic sheen which brightens it some, clear on the whole, a few lazy bubbles meandering here and there. Basic nose of grains, wheat, straw and then banana and corn, mild presence of flowers and peach, apple fruit, nothing really stands out from the pack, while uninteresting equally inoffensive. Medium-bodied, for its overall weight comes across as dense and unyielding, were it not for the charge put into it by the carbonation you might not feel it move. The initial sweetness provided by the banana, yeast, clove, flowers and corn fades in the face of wheat germ, rye and dried brown straw. Lowgrade mixed white citrus and stone fruits.

2.83,-2.7,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Not so hard-drinking though. Since this is usually the next best thing to Corona, it's tolerable. That said, this one is crappy, but doesn't taste like seawater and actually comes in a dark bottle.","WildMaverick1200","Apr 13, 2009"
3.14,7.9,2,3,3.5,3,3,"In the appearance is a copper color, poor head of foam, and some bubbles due to the high carbonation; the smell is fresh, some essences of roasted malts and carbonation; in the are roasted maltas and caramel, some carbonation again too; the mouthfeel have a little bitterness and a very refreshing end, beside the high carbonation again; in the drinkability, its good with the food or for parties, but sometimes i feel is "apple soda".","roddwolff","Mar 03, 2009"

We went for the victoria because it was darker and we had never seen it before. It was surprisingly good. I have never seen it since. We wiped out the supply that the lady and her kids were selling.","RobertSimmons51","Mar 12, 2007"

3.27,12.4,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Picked up a 940mL bottle for the beach for about 15 pesos. Not bad for beer that doesnt suck. Like most of the big mexican lagers, this is fairly mellow in flavor. Its got a decent aroma of caramel and barley. The flavor is pretty similar, but not as strong and a little sweeter and fruitier. Not a bad choice for a vacation.","tempest","Dec 21, 2006"

3.63,24.7,3,2.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This is a very basic beer with a bland lager taste (a lot like Sol in a way). It goes down nicely and doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. Although not very strong it yields a satisfying buzz (probably due to the fact that I drank about three litres of it). It's pretty cheap too so in summation I'll say it's a decent beer to get if you're low on cash standing undecided in front of the cooler at a Mexican 7/11 five minutes before midnight (when they stop selling alcohol).","d07c0m","Aug 26, 2006"
3.51,20.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This brew poured to a deep golden color showing a fair amount of carbonation. Had a white head that was medium in size but does break down quickly leaving a very fain trace of any lace on the side of the glass. This brew is actually quite nice smelling, malt seem to come out as well as nice sweet aroma. Over all not a bad smelling brew but not overly exciting, did not have the skunky characteristics that a number of the other Mexican brews showed. The taste is good, nice malt flavors mixed in with a little hop flavor at the tail end, and good carbonation. This brew was one of my favorites while on vacation, very drinkable with its taste, carbonation as well as the 4% ABV. Overall this is a good brew, not sure I will run out trying to track it down while in the states but one I would definitely look for while back in Mexico.","Stimack","Feb 20, 2006"

3.45,18.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours with a decent white head, settling over clear deep gold gently carbonated liquid. The nose is nothing more than light maltiness. The taste as well is very light, with notes of brief grassy malt before drying out with a nice amount of hop bitterness. A slightly above average Mexican lager.","beerluvr","Apr 06, 2004"
2.97,2.1,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. Pours with a pretty nice head and a bit of lacing. Suprised me considering the rest all disappeared with a blink of the eye. Smells of malt. corn, maybe rice fill the air. A bit of a hop smell too. Definite hop tatse with the malt background. This would be a decent beer to choose while having dinner. Fairly easy to drink. One of the better ones down here, but still nothing even close to brag about.","GClarkage","Mar 03, 2004"
2.98,2.4,3,2.5,2.5,3,4.5,"I recently sampled this beer while vacationing in Cozumel, Mexico. It was a decent beer, typical of most Mexican beers in my opinion. Light and easy drinking.

2.33,-19.9,2.5,2,2.5,2,2.5,"Definitely one of the better Mexican beers. This one actually has some tint to it. It is really easy to drink and tastes like a ricey-watery malt mix. I don't think it is as good as the Negra Modelo or Indio so at this point you may envision Victoria as a decent alternative to Corona with a little color..","stoutman","Nov 07, 2002"
3.4,16.8,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer saved my trip down to Playa del Carmen, MX. It is the only darker beer I could find (and I use the term loosely). Pours a little browner than a lager with a thin head and little lacing. The smell is sweet with some hoppiness. The flavor and mouthfeel was existent, great for a Mexican beer. This beer is actually very good, however, after 8 days in Mexico, I noticed inconsistency which may not be the brewery's fault. The brown bottle is also a welcome sight in an area that is not overly concerned with storage issues.","doho95fu","Beers"
3.03,4.1,3.5,3,3,3,3,"One of the few decent Mexican beers I have been able to find. Maybe not quite as good as Negra Modelo (which isn't really saying too much) but along the same lines and a decent alternative. On the scale of Mexican beers this is in the upper echelon, but it really does not stand up against other more readily available Viennas. I would go with an Elliot Ness here in the states, but this one is worth a shot if you are in Mexico with only Corona and Sol as your other options.","Dogbrick","0"
