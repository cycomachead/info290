The taste was slightly floral, with some hoppiness on the tongue, but it didn't hit me with the same bang that Eliot Ness did a while back.  The mouthfeel is pretty solid, with medium body and a decent bite on the back of the tongue.  Overall, this is a slightly above average Vienna.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Mar 05, 2015"

Especially since the next 3 beers may not be as kind.  Anyways this beer was a little wispy.  No head, golden amber color.  Not a hop to be found. Crispy and wet.  I will give it that.  If there was a fire, I would immediately think to get this beer.  My dislike has more to do with the vienna Lager style I think.  This was just ok in my mind","BradMacMullin","Sep 17, 2014"

3.67,-1.6,4,3.75,3.75,3.25,3.5,"My aggro pour created a pseudo-cascade that formed a brief finger of tawny head that quickly exhausted itself and became wisps. Color was a deep-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very sweet with notes of maple syrup and clover honey. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, very soft on the tongue. The taste was much like the nose - quite sweet with notes of syrup and honey along with molasses and brown sugar. Finish was semi-sweet, not quite as cloying as I might have expected. Once again, this was more of a curiosity for me than anything else and now my curiosity (and thirst) was satiated.","woodychandler","Jul 07, 2014"

Light bodied, easy to drink, and hitting the spot, there's not much at all going on with this beer but it is enjoyable. Not as bitter or dry as I am accustomed to, a good balance is in here from the dry, floral hop notes to some sticky sweet caramel. As said, not too much going on here but not a water light beer either and I can't complain.","clayrock81","May 05, 2013"

A little bit of burnt sugar, toffee, toast and bread are also present, all excellent flavors in great balance. What this beer does lack, however, is a little bit of body to carry these flavors, as it is a little watery on the mid-palate. Drying, mildly bitter (herbal, leafy) on the finish, with a light mineral character, this beer is light (too light) in body and has a medium-high level of carbonation.
