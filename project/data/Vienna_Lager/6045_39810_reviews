"O: a very well crafted version of the style."
"Unfortunately, I have to review this from memory, but based on what I've got stored in my brain, this was a good beer. It was malty, but not strong, and it was a nice shade of red. I'd order it again."

"8/16...take away growler. Pours bright copper amber with burnt red tones. Fizzy white foam. Bready caramel nose. Taste is a light sweet, bready, and roasted. Quite smooth and toasty. Good bodied lager. Really tasty."

"An under appreciated lager style in my opinion... looks the part with a clear copper tinted amber body, minimal head. Scent is pale with notes of caramel, dried malt, light toast, faint earthy hops. Taste follows suit, maybe a bit too clean lacking a little bit of malt depth and sweetness preferred in the style. Lighter bodied, could use a tick more carbonation. Fresh and decent, but lacking something that even some of the Mexican macros offer in the style."

"Medium-light bodied, medium carbonation; the feel is smooth enough. Decent session choice, I suppose. This beer has a lot going for it in terms of feel, appearance, and even aroma, but ultimately winds up a little bland and muted for my tastes with just a smidge more sweetness than I'd like."
"Overall: The malts in this one are very flavorful. I would like a little more out of the hops however."

"Pouring a sample out for the appearance, looks like a nice reddish amber with a thin off white head. Nose is slightly too sweet, carmel malt, toasty grain, and minimal hops. Biscuit malt in the flavor, with a grainy sweetness and bready finish. Medium light body with high carbonation. I'm indifferent to this beer most times, but when I want something for my mug for dinner, this usually works."
"On tap at the brewery. Couldn't see the pour as it was served in a clay Pub Club mug. 24oz for $4.50! Nose was grainy, some off corn sweetness. Mouth was grain, lightly hopped, a residual corn-type sweetness that was disconcerting. Longer finish was a pleasant remembrance of German hops. But overall, this style should be dry, crisp, and snappy, and it was over sugary and cheap tasting."

"Overall not bad, nothing really wrong, a bit on the light side."
"O: Nice and drinkable Vienna lager. Always my default choice at Iron Hill if there's nothing seasonal that's interesting (which is rare)."
"Overall- Excellent and interesting red considering it was a lager. The mix of flavors of a traditional red with the lager yeast notes was very interesting. Great warming property and excellent drinkability."
"M: The mouthfeel is hard to dislike, both bready and light. Full caramel adds depth."
"On tap at Iron Hill Phoenixville. Pours amber hue with a white head and light carbonation. Aroma is sweet caramel malt and hints of hops. Full, crisp body. Caramel malt is nicely balanced by herbal hops on the palate. Long, dry finish. Very fresh, excellent Vienna."
"Poured a clear amber with a small white head that receded to a film. Light malts in the aroma and not much more. Starts off malty and nutty, but sort of gives over to a watered down taste. Grassy hops are just barely noticeable. Light body. It's not a bad beer, and good for casual drinking, but not something I'd go back for."
"Very drinkable and refreshing. Versatile too, a safe bet for a non-connoisseur friend who doesn't know which beer to order. I can even imagine sipping on this one while playing softball on a hot summer day."
"It's medium bodied, but all that malt makes the lager drink a little chewy at points. It was like to body of the beer was not consistent from start to finish. It's an eminently drinkable lager though with an ABV of 5%. It was a good introduction to a style that you do not often see."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability: another easy drinking beer from IH, but the style is usually lackluster in flavor overall. Not a bad beer, but not overwhelming."
"Fuller bodied than expected with some nice toasted malt, biscuit and subtle spiciness. Nice crisp hop presence balances things out pretty nicely. Slightly dry finish. Well balanced easy drinking session beer."
"D: Easy drinkabilty and average enjoyment gives this a push to just slightly above average status here. Once again a good lawnmower beer or tweener but nothing to rush out or enthuse the more demanding craft driker."
"This came with a good, foamy finger of tawny head with good retention. The color was a deep reddish-amber with NE-quality clarity. The malt was much more evident on the nose than it had been with the Light Lager, sweetish with a bready accent. Mouthfeel was medium with a red raspberry flavor on the tongue. I was put in mind of Jell-O. I do not know if that is good or bad, but I liked it. I also liked the biscuity finish. This was head and shoulders over the Light Lager, but they were both very light for my taste."
"Drinkability: A tasty brew, one of my favorite for the evening given the selection I sampled. It was drinkable, but average tor a lager."
"An OK beer, but nothing great."
"Poured a clear amber with some red hues, but not as red as I was expecting it to be, little head, but good lacing. Smells of biscuits and grassy hops. Taste is very similar, sweet biscuity malt up front followed by a dry grassy and floral hop finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Good for a staple beer with nice hop flavors, very sessionable."
"D: This beer reminds me a lot of Yuengling Lager without the graininess. A little sweeter than I would like for a go to session."
"This beer appeared a clear, amber color in my glass. There were may be a few hint of red in the color, but if they were going for a traditional red color, they missed the mark. The aroma was intially hoppy, then had hints of berries, which I thought was neat. The flavor is pretty malty, but generally it had a clean lager body with hint of caramelized sugars. The beer was a little flat in my glass which made it a little less drinkable, but I wouldn't say this was the case everytime it's served. For the most part, this beer is just a really malty lager."
"D - A fine Vienna, just not my favorite style and lacks some German malt character. I would try this one again, since it is quaffable and perfect for sessioning."
"Very solid lager- slightly reddish tint, nice head- strong hop aromas. Taste was balanced but surprisingly dominated by a strong, crisp hop presence. Slightly bready malt,not too sweet, but it lends the brew a lot of weight. Slightly thick wih moderate carbonation. Very refreshing; great session brew with a moderate ABV."
"Appeared a nice copper color with a thin lasting head and very little carbonation noted in the beer. Produced light lacing as well. Aromas of bready malt, all the way. This followed through in the flavor which was an airy bready malt with slight roasted quality as well. A little sweet too. Mouthfeel was nice and full, but not overbearing. This was a perfect summer beer, consequently, I think I'll have some more!"
"A clear, deep amber body is capped by a short, off-white head that holds OK before dropping to a thin creamy collar and leaving some spotty lace. The nose is gently malty, and a touch toasty. There is a very minimal fruitiness to it but you have to look to find it. The body is medium and it's lightly crisp in the mouth. The flavor displays the 'juicy' malt that Vienna style lagers are known for. It's lightly fruity (red berries) and toasty. The bitterness is restrained as expected, but firm enough to balance, and it finishes dry with some lingering toasty malt and fruit. Very well done; very clean. A highly enjoyable lager that satisfies. It offers enough full flavor and complexity to maintain interest while still remaining quite drinkable. It's worth trying, and since the food and atmosphere are so good it's definitely worth making a trip."
