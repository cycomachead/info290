This German-style lager has wonderful maltiness underscored by the German noble hops for a smooth and satisfying brew!","BeerFMAndy","May 09, 2013"

3.23,-4.4,3.5,3,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Gotta love Paul Simon gettin' stuck in your head. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by over a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises flowers, very light biscuit, and even lighter (somehow) orange rind. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a mild sense of honey-like sweetness that pervades all aspects of life. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, an okay little amber lager, something I could see drinking fairly easily, but not something I would actually aim to drink all that often.","TMoney2591","Mar 24, 2012"

2.06,-39.1,3,2,2,2,2,"Not impressed. Bought this beer soon after moving to Wisconsin and trying all the wonderful craft brews available. Poured well enough into tall glass, took a sip... and then nothing. Tepid first couple of sips, followed by that taste of phenol that a lot of the commercial cheap lagers have over here. Very surprised to taste such a limp lager. Poured rest down sink. This beer tasted watered down, and much like a run of the mill, cheap commercial lager. For this beer, read: Miller, poured into a bottle with a fancy label to make it look appealing.","baldiegooner","Aug 23, 2011"
3.58,5.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall, not an extremely exciting beer but very drinkable. A good full-bodied feel with good carbonation and pretty decent flavor just nothing that stands out as being particularly outstanding.","adman08","Jul 24, 2011"
3.65,8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not a bad brew, and I expected a hoppy blond ale, but to my surprise this is a helles. It is a little full flavored a helles for my taste. I would like to try this one cleaner. Is this from the bottle conditioning? The yeast they used?","tapman","Jun 25, 2011"
3.5,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The Flaming Damsel pours deep golden/light amber color, it almost has a red-pink hue to it, with a thin skim of white head. The aroma is moderately malty--grainy, sweet, some hints of caramel, inviting. The flavor mimics the nose, moderately malty--grainy, a bit toasty/bready with just a bit of spicy hop flavor. The finish is smooth, slightly dry in part to a medium-low hop bitterness. Carbonation is medium and body medium as well. Overall a decent beer, yes there are better of this style, but I would gladly take a second one.","uwmgdman","May 23, 2011"
3.53,4.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Once again a thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer for me to try. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by malts. Taste also has considerable malts, grains, a touch of hops are present. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a refreshing and good beer.","tone77","May 17, 2011"
3.03,-10.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Taste: Mild malt, small hops, low bitterness, but very balanced. Pleasing and quaffable, but not for me. It's a nice enough amber lager (blonde lager, is that a style?) and I wish them well with it.","feloniousmonk","Mar 03, 2011"
3.75,10.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"This is a clean & easy-drinking beer that would pair perfectlly with a book, porch, & cool fall day. If I didn't already have a couple of go-to summer beers, this one might get an extended try-out. Refrehsingly good brew.","maximum12","Jan 20, 2011"
3.48,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Their website indicates that this is done in the Vienna Lager style and would be inclined to agree, as this possessed that tangy mix of fruit and bread that I find so often in these beers. This was decent but not overly memorable.","Kegatron","Aug 29, 2010"
4.35,28.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bottle poured into a New Glarus pint glass. Good appearance, poured a cloudy dark caramel ale color. Smelled very good, like a good blonde beer. Excellent taste, some hops, but understated. Great mouthfeel, super drinkable. I will be picking up more of this next time I am in Wisconsin.","deadbody","Beers"
3.7,9.5,4,4,4,3,3,"Following the Crack & Glug, the pour resulted in two rocky fingers' worth of ecru head that burbled and fell like a diver entertaining the turn of the 20th century crowds. Color was a medium-amber with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Following their advice, I put my face in the glass and was rewarded with a wet nose. Confound this beak of mine! Regrouping, it was certainly malt forward, but underlain with the tang of Saaz hops. Mmm. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin but with a pleasant lager sweetness on the tongue. Finish continued to be malty sweet, which is OK for the style, but less to my liking. Not a bad beer, but not one that I would want a whole bunch of either.","woodychandler","0"
