2.55,-13.9,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Overall - Nothing to write home about. Just another basic adjunct lager that is inter-changeable with so many other beers in it's style category.","spinrsx","Dec 26, 2011"
3.1,4.7,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Final Grade: 3.1, about a C+. This tallboy was priced the same as a can of the 'premium' macro equivalent (e.g. Canadian/Keith's), rather than a value brand like Lakeport or Lucky. In terms of quality, I would wedge Trailhead between those two groups - a little better than the cheap stuff, but not any better than your typical domestic premium lager. Purchase accordingly.","thehyperduck","Oct 29, 2011"

3,1.4,3,3,3,3,3,"You know, this is a lawnmower beer but it's tasty. Clear with a little bit of head around the edge, applejuice yellow in colour, hoppy smell. Little bit of bitterness going down, very pleasant and no weird aftertaste. I'm going to call it average all around, but I'm enjoying it.","Antikythera","Mar 08, 2011"

2.65,-10.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Drinkability - From a beer perspective, this beer does not have a lot to offer. Would i drink it again, ya, i could see myself drinking if i wanted a fresh light tasting beer. But i would not stock these on a day to day basis.","Swedes21","Sep 27, 2010"
2.98,0.7,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear pale orange colour with white head that dissipates quickly, but some lacing around the glass. Smells of bready malt with some very faint grassy hops. Not much in the way of flavour, but nothing off about it. Is there actually adjuncts in here? Ok carbonation level and easy to drink.","kwjd","Sep 23, 2010"
2.94,-0.7,4,2.5,3,3,3,"D = This beer was just alright. Nothing fantastic here. But it would do quite nicely on a very hot summer day.","grac1970","Sep 11, 2010"
3.37,13.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Mouthfeel is medium, pretty smooth but ultimately the beer does have quite a sweetness to it and ends up hurting the drinkability. I have no problem with sweetness in something like a Barleywine or RIS because it has depth but this is just grainy sweetness.","roadhouse","Beers"
3.59,21.3,3,4,3.5,2.5,4,"D - Fairly high. If I wanted a really really easy drinking Ontario lager with just barely enough flavour for an evening of drinking,this would have to be it. The 4.5 ABV is also swell.","tbeckett","0"
2.83,-4.4,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"As far as a "discount" brew goes, you can do much worse. At around 30 bucks for a 24, it's not a bad brew. Can't say I really enjoyed it that much; it's not among Wellington's best offerings.","JohnnyBarman","Jul 02, 2010"
2.61,-11.8,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"D: a drain pour for me, and yet another clunker in the Wellington lineup. They still make some good beers, but Trailhead isn't one of them. Don't bother.","cratez","Jan 16, 2010"
2.8,-5.4,3,3,2.5,3,3,"D - It's drinkable but only because it's plain and bland. It could definitely use more hops. There's nothing redeeming about this "macro" wannabe.","decimator","Sep 23, 2009"
3.18,7.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"A fair shake better than your typical AA (heh) Lager, classification-wise, but it doesn't quite follow through on the packaging's promise of a Vienna Lager by dint of Czech hops and German malts - the requisite crispness and zing just aren't there.","biboergosum","Sep 17, 2009"
2.61,-11.8,3,2,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Overall verdict: Wellington should stick to English ales. This isn't a bad beer by any means, it's just a really boring one.","MeisterBurger","Sep 05, 2009"

2.85,-3.7,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Pretty average lager all around, and not the best I have had from the brewery, but a decent beer nonetheless. Head is foamy, and white, medium sized. Body is a dark amber colour. Aroma is stale hops, corn, and a faint sweetness. Taste is hoppy, bitter, sweet like sugar, and slight corn. Finish is a tad watery, leaving a mild bite in the throat as well. Not horrid, but they make better stuff!","mrmanning","Jun 08, 2009"

3.12,5.4,2,2.5,3,4,4,"Final Thoughts: Well, I knew this beer was one of Wellington's weaker offerings, but even still it has it's niche. This would be a great after a long hike in the woods, which is really what this beer sorta implies by it's name. It's not bad for an adjunct lager, but when you pour it into the glass, the lackluster smell and appearance doesn't do it any favors during the review.","TheHammer","Oct 18, 2008"
2.28,-23,3,2.5,2,3,2,"Drinkability - for me, this will be the first and last time for Trailhead Premium Lager. Not a good product, not a good beer.","DoctorStrangiato","Oct 16, 2008"
3.44,16.2,3,4,3.5,3,3,"This has potential for sure, just round out the carbonation a bit and we have a winner here, otherwise a great malty lager.","IronDjinn","Oct 11, 2008"
2.98,0.7,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours clear golden yellow with moderate white head which dissapeared quickly. Smell - malts mostly, average smell for this type of beer. Taste - sweet malts, corn, not too bad actually, at least id doesn't taste like medicine, like other brews of this kind. Feels a bit flat, but stil OK with clean finish. It's pretty drinkable, this is not something I'd drink on a regular basis, but still an OK beer.","Voonder","Oct 06, 2008"
2.81,-5.1,3.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Easy enough to drink, but it really lacks in substance. Could work for a lawnmower beer.","elricorico","May 29, 2008"
2.99,1,3,4,2.5,2.5,3,"Not terrible, but not worth what I paid for it. Why couldn't they have found an extra case of Arkell in the storeroom?","hegelec","Apr 28, 2008"
3.15,6.4,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Honestly I expected a bit better than this from Wellington, but for what it is it's not terrible. Worth a try at least.","funkengruven","Feb 26, 2008"
2.59,-12.5,2,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I was expecting something a bit better from Wellington brewery. This seems more along the lines of the discount, buckabeer brews. Perhaps that's what it's meant to be? Anyways... Pours a very pale straw colour with a head that quickly fades away, leaving a small film of foam on top. Sort of a basic, sweet, bready smell with a small floral hop scent. Bit sweet tasting with plenty of grain. Has a very mild citrus and grassy/floral aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and watery. Sort of a 'meh' beer. Decent for camping, but their are much better session beers.","slitherySOB","Feb 19, 2008"
3.03,2.4,4.5,4,2,3,3.5,"But coming from Wellington I would expect much better.","Antilochus","Feb 16, 2008"
2.73,-7.8,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"D - Overall, a clean, light, watery brew. A good choice for people who don't like beer.","allergictomacros","Dec 27, 2007"
3.4,14.9,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Any way this beer is like that. it tastes alright but just isn't anything memorable. So i won't try it again.","shamus","Dec 12, 2007"
3.15,6.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Straw colour witha half finger white head that spread out soon enough with minimal lacing. A mix of large and small bubble carbonation. Smells of fresh grass, mild citrus. Taste is citrus hoppy, dry, bitter, malt, slightly sour finish. Light to medium body. Not a bad lager overall but not a great one by any stretch. This might appeal to the scores of lager lovers who don't want to spend too much, it's certainly better than many of the macro lagers that have unfortunately cornered a certain market here in Ontario. From Wellington County, an honest effort at compromise, better than most they're competing with on this level.","ThatWineGuy","Jul 26, 2007"
2.56,-13.5,3,2,2.5,3,3,"A very lackluster beer, but still a notch up from BMC","CAMRAhardliner","Nov 06, 2006"
3.08,4.1,3,2.5,3,3,4,"Overall for the price of this beer you can't go wrong. You pay for what you get, and in Trailhead Lagers case, that is an above average brew at a great price. Its hard to find cheaper beers that are of decent quality but, Wellington brewery makes a pitch into the buck-a-beer market and for once we see a brewery make a decent,drinkable, natural beer thats better than you're basic macros at an unbeatable price. Give this brew a shot! It may not be the best beer out there, but it sure is one of the best discount beers.","drinkininthewood","Aug 21, 2006"
3.12,5.4,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Fortunately there's enough good beer out there that none of us should ever have to settle for something that's just 'agreeable'. Trailhead was obviously designed for those with low standards and, while not the bottom of the barrel for beers in this style and price range, I personally would have to feel pretty down on myself to sit through another pint of it.","biegaman","Beers"
3.27,10.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"D: A good, sessionable beer, but the hop profile isn't my style.","Derek","0"
3.22,8.8,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Taste is a little more muddled, with an unpleasant acidity that sets off what is otherwise a pretty tasty beer. There's a slight citrus and grassy hop presence along with a punchy malt backbone, but something in the finish says "cheap". A shame really, because otherwise this is a very refreshing lager. A bit over-carbonated perhaps, but full-bodied. A decent offering, and certainly drinkable, but not the Holy Grail of lagers either....","trevorwideman","Oct 12, 2005"
3.37,13.9,3,3.5,3,3.5,4,"This is definitely a good summer brew - when the budget is low, but the heat is high, this is a brew that fits the bill. A thirst quencher that I wouldn't think too much about, but would certainly enjoy - in a pint glass, or even straight from the bottle. Trailhead is, in all likelihood, the best lager you'll find on the discount board at the Beer Store. So bottom's up.","headlessparrot","Mar 29, 2005"
3.13,5.7,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Very clear golden colour topped with a thin sheet of fine bubbles. Fair retention and a bit of lacing. Smells of malt/corn sweetness with a bit of fruit and mild spicy hops. The flavour is a bit fruity, the bitterness quite mild, and it has a slightly acidic sharpness at the end. Very light hop flavour that's on the spicy side, it finishes off-dry. Sweetness is pronounced throughout and it's too much for the beer to handle. The body is light, but not to the point of being watery. Easy to drink, nothing special but worth a try.","DrJay","Oct 25, 2004"
2.92,-1.4,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"On tap at the Shepherds pub: Tapped a golden colour. Moderate heaed...soft carbonation... Light doughy malt aroma mixed with light fruit tones. Soft malty, taste in a light/soft mouthfeel. Tasty light lager with a hint citrus and low bitterness. If I closed my eyes Id have though this was Neustadt Bruce county lager. A faily light lager...good thirst buster.","pootz","Aug 08, 2004"
2.42,-18.2,2,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Trailhead Wellington. Dark yellow colored ale with small head and not a whole lot of retention. Aroma is mostly subtle floral malt and very little else. Taste is a balance mix of floral malt with some dryness at the ends. This one lacks character overall and is probably not the best beer from this brewery.","Phyl21ca","Jun 15, 2003"
2.51,-15.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,"A pourout at the Fort York Brew Fest 2004. Wateriest and absence of taste of the Wellington line. Golden appearance, no noted aroma. Corny sweet. Some honey mid-sip from yeast. Crisp from Czech hops, altogether below average. Bittery finish. Doesn't work.","Sammy","Feb 20, 2003"
2.8,-5.4,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Drinkability: It's very light and somewhat refreshing. Possibly on a hot summers day but otherwise, this beer is average at its best.","Popsinc","Beers"
3.22,8.8,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"The taste is a little sweet but the hops are also evident in a twangie(sp) aftertaste that also leaves you dry and wanting more..Worth a try.","Shiloh","0"
