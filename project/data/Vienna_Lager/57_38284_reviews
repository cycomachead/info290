"My favorite mexican beer, I wish the world would consider this as the beer from mexico and not corona."
"One of the best mexican beers I've had. Incredibly smooth"
"One of my favorite dark Mexican beers. Easy to drink, great flavor and feel, and something I search out now when I'm buying beer in Mexico."

"Overall, this beer is just alright. Highly forgettable. The thing that gets me about this beer is the pretentious bottle -- wrapped in foil as if this is a really rare treat. I'd not be opposed to having it again, but it's just too ""blah"" for me to warrant ever buying it."

"Overall: this is a tasty and drinkable lager, and while it may not be quite stylistically accurate, I quite like it. Would definitely have again."
"A quick observation: i have been told by a friend that Bohemia uses artificial colors and additives in it brewing process and that it will give you rather nasty hangover. Though i can advocate the former to be false nor true, i can say that i have yet to experience any kind of hangover from Bohemia Obscura, even at times drinking more than a dozen in one evening."

"Overall interesting but not great, some decent malts but skunked bad lager."

"Overall, a good beer among all of the popular Mexican beers out there; one of the best but not for much. It's great for a dry and hot weather, like those in a typical Mexican summer. Highly recommended if you come to Mexico and want to taste something different and better than Corona."

"A pretty good beer, all things considered. So far, it's the best of the local options I've had. I'll continue exploring other Mexican beers, but I suspect I'll come back to this one."

"Hints of hazelnut and coffee save this from being really bad, but it's not far off. Fortunately it's not cloyingly sweet like some other Cuauhtemoc brews..."
"Overall - not a very perplexing beer to taste, but still interesting and good."
"Pleasant appearance, but unfortunately a brutal corn syrupy aroma. The higher alcohol content (as compared to most Mexican beers) deepens the flavour profile, which has some maltiness along with the fundamental sweetness and over-riding corn adjuncts. What a shame hops don't seem to have made it south of the border. However there is an underlying slight bitterness to the finish, so this beer is actually growing on me as I finish it..."
"A tasty beer best consumed from the bottle or a glass where the aroma does not pool."
"Again, drinks well, both mouthfeel and drinkability are nice and will have a few more in the next few days."
"M/D: Goes down very smooth, extremely drinkable. More complex than most Mexican beers, probably my favorite, but a little harder to find in stores than most in Mexico. If it is available, its what I am drinking."
"D: Very drinkable as all are when temps are over 100 F...lol"
"D: As a macro, drinkability is high. This is a little bit more expensive than most of mexican macro beers, and could be the best of them. Very good to pair with spicy mexican food."
"Its decent but nothing I drink in the US, and while on vacation probably wouldn't drink this in the hot sun either."
"Perfect choice. Screw overpriced coronas at the Mexican shores. Get a 6 pack from the local Wal Mart for $60 mxn...you save money and get 6 delicious beers. This beats easily most other Cuahtemoc beers and Modelo beers. Remember, this is not the regular Bohemia, this one is Bohemia Oscura and has a silver seal on top instead of gold. Very recommended!"
"D: Is true that is uncomparable."
"Tastes of smooth malts with nutty caramel and lingering coffee undertones. Feel is quite nice. The light coffee sticks around in the finish and is met with some malts for a balanced close. Not very sweet and light on the tongue with just the right amount of carbonation. Easy drinking. Dark and reasonably complex yet smooth, making it well suited for the typical weather of its homeland."
"Sometimes it is creamy somwtimes it is quite alcoholic. BUt it has softer aroma than the regular. It broke the myth of Bohemia being a dark one. It is malty in tste and I prefeer it over the other one. The quality is good but not exceptional. Let us say it is a potable beer in here."
"¡Salud!"
"¡Salud!"
"85% recommended."
