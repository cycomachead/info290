3.78,11.2,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Another entry in the winter sampler from the post-DLD death march. The pour results in a clear tawny amber with a half-finger of cream-colored foam that lingers for quite a while. Moreover, a thick bit o' lacing is formed as the head glacially recedes. The nose is toffee, walnut, and a light mixture of wheat and tallgrass. The taste shows a similar profile, with notes of toffee, caramel, butter, walnut, and sweetgrass. Though I prefer the smell, the taste ain't all that bad in its own right. The body is light, with moderate carbonation and a feel that is smooth, crisp, and slightly watery. Not the best of the box, but pretty good nonetheless.","TMoney2591","Apr 06, 2010"
3.31,-2.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Clear copper with a creamy tan head that leaves filmy lace on the glass. The nose is faintly caramel with a whiff of noble hops. Ths flavor is mostly sweetish caramel with an earthy hop bitterness but not really well balanced or particularly flavorful. Medium bodied with gassy carbonation. Not the best tasting example of the style.","biggred1","Apr 05, 2010"
3.53,3.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Out of a bottle this beer was a copper/bronze color with good retention of the one-finger beige head. The aroma was of bready/biscuity malt and a little sweetness from some caramel malt with a touch of herbal hobs and vanilla. The flavors were similar with the caramel malt sweetness coming forth clearly with the herbal hops remaining in the background. A little butter, hints of nuts and brown sugar but overall rather bland. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation right on. Ok, but forgettable.","thekevlarkid","Feb 22, 2010"
3.6,5.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Notes: For the style it seems just a little on the light side but everything is in good balance for the style. Once again Saranac has brewed another decent easy drinking beer.","generallee","Feb 15, 2010"

3.33,-2.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear amber color with an offwhite head. Decent retension and a nice amount of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, bit of grain, little bit of hops and sulfur in the end of the nose. Taste follows suit with much the same characteristics . Picking up on a bit of caramel sweetness but balanced well with the hop bitterness. Very crisp finish. Light feel and moderate carb. Nothing super exciting but overall not bad.","stakem","Jan 22, 2010"
3.38,-0.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a dark brown with a two-finger head. The smell is a mix of sweet biscuity malt with a smattering of spices. The taste is a pretty good reflection of the smell, I should have paid more attention to the label on the bottle to figure out exactly what kind of spices they used but it was a nice addition without turning the beer into something that's like drinking potpourri. A nice solid beer that's probably one of the better ones in the Winter holiday pack.","TheTrevor","Jan 22, 2010"

3.92,15.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: A light winter lager? Yeah, that's what this one feels like to me. Good interpretation of one, but watered down. Even so it could certainly be a session brew, and even beer rookies might enjoy this one.","irishking1977","Jan 19, 2010"
3.5,2.9,4,4,3,3,4,"Drinkability: A very easy drinking Vienna lager. I do prefer this to some of the more commercial ones out there. However I do find the roasted malts a bit distracting and not true to style. It maybe kinda suited as a ""winter lager"". If they bottled this year round it might make a good addition to Saranac's line up. Overall not a great brew, but worth trying and worth drinking if its around. However this is only available in the 12 beers of winter.","MaxBrews","Jan 16, 2010"
3.75,10.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"My pour resulted in two fingers' worth of eggnog-colored head with decent, if not great, retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a rich, malty sweetness - somewhat caramel-like in its intensity. Mouthfeel was medium with a light caramel taste in the mouth. Finish had a light hoppy bite. Score another one for the Saranac variety pack!","woodychandler","Jan 11, 2010"

Sweet malts aroma, mild yeasty smell along with sweet spices. Carmel, some wheat and yeast flavors, almost like a biscuit. For a winter lager I would expect more of a robust flavor. Mouthfeel is okay, and drinkablility is high.","mtnbikerpa","Jan 03, 2010"
3.88,14.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a really good Vienna Lager. Too bad it's called ""Winter Lager"" because this would make an excellent addition to their year round offerings.","Deus1138","Beers"
3.82,12.4,3,3.5,4,4,4,"From the winter sampler case, this beer is a brilliantly clear copper-amber color. The head is a little slim, with white wisps. Nice aroma...barley, a bit of caramel, cereal, mildly toasted malts. Not bad. The taste is quite good, with a lot of malt and sweetness. Fairly medium-full in body, this could be a great session beer. Firm hop bitterness in the finish, although malt is centric in this brew. Very enjoyable.","Suds","0"
4.03,18.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"pours a clear copper color with a light tan two or three finger head depending on the pour. head holds well and leaves a nice sticky lace as you drink. smells of fresh malt and very slight spice. taste is subtle, sweet strong tea thats lightly spiced comes to mind, slight lingering after taste that not unpleasant. mouthfeel is light and a medium carbonation that fits well with this beer. easy to drink and subtle taste make it very enjoyable.","billybob","Dec 31, 2009"

3.75,10.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"12 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Off-white head lasts for a just a short period and than disappears, leaving mild lacing.

3.45,1.5,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall a fairly nice winter lager that definitely warms you. However the odd bitterness and lack of balance seems to detract from my desire to seek this out.","Mardukk","Dec 13, 2009"
3.5,2.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured into a pilsner style glass. Nice copper color with a head the quickly turns into a film. Sporatic lacing. Hint of caramel in the finish.

2.68,-21.2,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Copped as part of a twelve-pack Winter sampler... One of the better brews in the bunch but still, nothing to write home about...

3.48,2.4,4,3.5,3,4,4,"Part of a case version of their twelve beers of winter (double the enjoyment for the holidays, nice). Longneck was poured into a tall, slender German lager glass. A hard pour produced a couple healthy inches of cream-colored head on top of a darker than expected amber colored liquid. Very lively carbonation working its way up through. Smells of golden brown toast, some cooked vegetable, and sweet malt. Flavors include lightly toasted malt, some light caramel sweetness, cooked vegetable, and a metallic bitterness in the finish. Feel in the mouth is medium with a bright carbonation. This is a pretty easy drinking beer for the season that is dominated by heavier, stronger ales. This lager is close to being very good, but falls a little short compared to some of their others I think. A nice mix up to the winter pack.","kkosmoski","Nov 30, 2009"

3.5,2.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"12 Beers of Xmas 2009, this one pours a deep caramel ruby color crystal clear visuals. Light beige head forms thick and dwindles slowly. Aroma has some slight caramel malt sweetness with herbal German hops in the background. Flavor has a nice rounded caramel sweetness with slight roasted nut edges. Clean mildly hopped finish with a mineral edge. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied for a lager carbonation is decent just not as soft as it should be.

3.26,-4.1,4,3,3,3,4,"From the newest Saranac winter sampler pack... pours a nice semi see through brown color, little wisp of head.. some lacing. For a winter lager, this is definitely on the light bodied side.. not the typical hearty/heavy winter seasonal. Still pretty drinkable though, not too much there flavor wise. If this is a vienna lager I'd much rather have Boston Lager.. that one has a lot more pronounced flavors than this one. Not bad, but I've had a lot better ones from this brewery.. rest of their winter mixed pack is better.","oriolesfan4","Nov 11, 2009"

The pour is a darker amber color with a lot of bubbly carbonation flowing upward to a thin off-white head. The lacing is limited. In the aroma I note some muted malts and hops with something a bit fruity and grassy. The mouthfeel is thin. The taste has a bit more to offer than the aroma with a hint of caramel bitterness with a slightly bolder hoppy finish. But overall it is quite average, although easy to drink, but with the character of a cheaper winter lager for a slightly larger dollar.","puboflyons","Nov 08, 2009"

3.43,0.9,3.5,3,3,4,4.5,"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a tight egg-shell colored head that settles into a light ring. The aroma is of a light caramel malt, a bit bready with hints of copper. The taste is of caramel malt, a little doughy, light spice, and a touch of grassy hops. All of the flavors are rather light. The feel is light but not watery, plenty of carbonation, well balanced; finishes with an ever so slight bitter hop. This is a darn refreshing beer. Very clean flavors and very crisp. No off-putting flavors. Not the most flavorful brew but its very drinkable. Great to session.","Gmann","0"
3.51,3.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Not what I was expecting, more of a lighter Octoberfest (can't say I am familiar with the Vienna style lager before this one). Still, it is done well. Well balanced albeit a bit uninteresting, I tend to go for darker ales in the winter.","BeerPhan86","Nov 02, 2009"

Smells slightly caramel malty with a bit of a soapy quality. Tastes malty, with caramel, chocolate and a slight fruity. Medium in both body and carbonation.
