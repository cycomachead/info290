The aroma is of caramel malt with a fairly strong sourness to it. It smells more like a Berliner Weisse than a Vienna Lager. It's not a bad aroma. On the contrary it is actually quite pleasant. It just isn't what a Vienna Lager should smell like. The taste is a lot less sour then the aroma, but there is still a faint hint of sourness in the background. Up front there there are some nice caramel notes with some light floral hops. I think I would like it a bit better if the sourness were a little stronger. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation for the style. Overall, I'm not sure if something is off or if the brewer really did intend on this beer beings slightly sour. Either way I can't see myself drinking this one again.","KarlHungus","Apr 15, 2012"

3.74,4.2,3,4,4,3,3.5,"Taste: My first impression is of a slightly above average Oktoberfest. The beer is smooth, light bodied, full of biscuity, toasted malts, and ultra drinkable. It does come in a bit fruity though; maybe cotton candy like? A pinch of spice from the hops compliments the finish along with that lager sulphur-like quality. I'm detecting a bit of apple and white grape juice in there as well. For a beer clocking in at below 5%, I have to give Millstream credit for pulling out tons of flavor from the malt bill. If you're looking for a beer to pair with brats/kraut or chili, look no further.","knepper","Dec 10, 2011"

When smelling the beer, toasty, bready flavours come out. In the back end is a nice malty sweetness. When drinking the beer, there is a huge maltiness coming from the Munich malts, and some caramel comes through as well. A floral noble, type hop comes through at the finish with the nice crispness from the lagering of the beer. I think the extra hoppiness makes this beer a little bit out of style, but this tastes great; moreover, this is probably closer to a hoppy Vienna lager.

The nose is suprisingly hoppy and has nice soft floral notes as well as a hint of caramel malts. Millstream has a good Marzen here, not outstanding, but very solid. A superb balance of malt and hops, and a near perfect match, though the caramel malts slightly over shadow the fruity hop undercurrent. A touch of spice is very subtle and blends in well. A little tartness / bitterness on the finish adds another dimension and is easily appreciated. The body is full figured for a Marzen and delivers a good amount of texture as well as a nice dry finish. It may be out of the Oktober Fest season, but that didn't stop me from enjoying every drop of this delicious offering.","orangemoustache","Jan 23, 2009"

Has a smooth clean sweet taste with chocolate and biscuity flavors. There may be some roasted grains beneath. Very drinkable, but not much in depth of flavor.

Doesnt really drink like a Marzen/Oktoberfest in my opinion, although it shares some of that styles sweetness and maltiness in a lighter way. Its more like a lightly hopped red/amber ale. Not a beer Id go out of my way to find (as they say in Michelin), but what Id probably be drinking if I were a student in Iowa.

Great head, moderate lacing, great smell, great taste, goes down easy, lasts a long time. It's strong enough in the winter time, yet not too heavy to drink in the summertime unless I was working outside or something, in which case I'd probably be drinking water or Powerade anyway, not beer.

The nose is realty lacking in potency, hard whiffs induce only a trace of toasty-caramel malts and I am making an assumption about that. The palate is decent, toasty malts with a well-balanced addition of hops for a crisp bitterness that cuts the toasty malts just long enough to allow for a caramel note in the finish. There is an odd mineral twang but it is tolerable. This is a solid amber lager. Medium in body, natural carbonation, this allows for an easy drinking beverage. I could session with this but I might get bored after a couple. It is worth drinking if in Iowa, you need not seek it out unless you want a beer from all fifty states.
