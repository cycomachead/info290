3.86,24.1,4,3,4.25,4,4,"This beer holds a special place in my heart. It was my gateway beer to microbrews and craft beers. Back when I was drinking MGD, Red Dog, Icehouse and other ordinary beers, this one was my first "chance" taken on something off the path. Applebee's had it on tap and I watched a server carry one by in a "Brewtus" glass. I said to myself, " I must have one of those". So I did and I enjoyed it. It became sort of an after work tradition and soon after I tried Warsteiner and Guinness and the rest is history. Can't remember the last time I had an MGD. Do they still make it? Anyway, about the beer....smooth...red....nice beer that deserves to be tasted. I confess that I haven't had one in a long time. I can't find it anymore around here. What happened to it? Wish I could find it. I would get a 6 pack or two of it. If it's in your area, try it.","todrinkornottodrink","May 25, 2013"

Poured a nice amber red into pint place which arrived with a quarter inch or so of fluffy head. Taste was a good mouth feel with a noble hop crispness that mellows to a nice clean drinking biscuit like finish. I have to say I would get this again, probably my personal favorite that I have had from Leinenkugel's as I actually found myself wanting another instead of wanting something else with a little more. A good solid vienna lager for sure.","Blueribbon666","Oct 01, 2011"

The beer pours a rusty amber topped by nearly a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises caramel, stale rye bread, and musty oranges. The taste holds notes of musty caramel, orange rind, light lemon peel, black pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Things don't quite meld well, ending up with a harsh bitterness shrouded by a meek attempt at sweetness. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, I was nowhere near enthused by this brew, but luckily the tilapia dish that accompanied it salvaged the dinner.","TMoney2591","Jul 16, 2011"

I am a big fan of truth in advertising, so a reddish-amber beer that bills itself as a "Red Lager" is right up my alley. Actually, it was closer to copper and it had NE-quality clarity which makes for a pretty beer, if nothing else. Nose was quite malty sweet, making good use of the four varieties mentioned on the label. Mouthfeel was medium with an initial sweetness, but giving 'way to a mild bitterness, especially on the finish. I shake my head in disbelief that I did not like this on tap at one point, but the circumstances are lost.

The malty smell is poorer than expected, even kind of rotten-ish. I prefer to not sniff it, and take it straight to the mouth, where it is all right, but nothing above average.

There was a slight bite to it, not quite bitter, more like a sour bite. Probably the breakdown of the sugar in it. I would recommend this, but try to drink close to the source (Wisconsin). This has a color slightly lighter than Killian's, but not as strong or sweet tasting. Still, a halfway decent lager.

Pale, reddish color (reminded me of strawberry soda) with minimal head. A bit spritzy and thin in the mouth. The taste, at first, was rather benign; but as the glass wore on, I noted a strong alcohol taste that seemed to overpower it all. Not something I'd recommend. I still have extremely high hopes for the other Leinie's products. I'm a Leinie's Lodge member, after all.

Others have commented on a chemical-like flavor and I also noticed something amiss in the flavor. Malty sweet and not well-balanced. Finishes with nothing on the palate, like it just disappears.

First hint of trouble came from the aroma, or lack thereof, since this has little nose. Some light malting and small sense of hops. Flavor of malt was only slightly balanced.
