"But that maltiness isn't overwhelming in the taste. Nice balance with that and noble hops, grassiness. Easy drinking, nice light weight feel and good carbonation fizz. Would go well with many menu items, or as a beginner in a flight."

"Sure, but when am I gonna finally get my hands on an Innsbruck-style amber lager...? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper-amber topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises dried maple syrup, straight barley, light biscuit, and a hint of lemon pepper. Didn't see that last one coming... The taste brings in more of the same, along with some very light sweetgrass and a thick veneer of some strange, vague fruitiness, one with a bit of vinosity buoying about every now and again. It's a kinda odd combination, really, and it has me vacillating between bemusement and very minor disgust. It's hard to explain... The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a sub-standard Vienna lager, one that just comes across as off-the-mark to me."
"Problematic on many fronts, the beer in extremely very few ways resembles a Vienna Lager. If this is the style you seek, then you'll find great favor in Samuel Adams Lager, Negra Modelo, and Flying Dog Old Scratch. But if you want a real delight, Great Lakes Eliot Ness is a must-win choice."

"O: This beer seems to be a little too malty and sweet for the style; it could use a little more bitterness from the hops. It's easy to drink but I'm not sure if I would have another one of these."
"O: Much more ""amber"" than ""Vienna."" I'll pass in the future."

"Plays a hazy, copper/red color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, hops, slight floral notes, hint of citrus, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of a Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight caramel malt, slight hops, hint of bread, hint of citrus, and a hint of floral notes. Overall, good appearance, decent body, blend, and aroma."

"O) I've had my share of this style. This is middle of the road at best. I have plenty of local options that are superior. I don't see myself revisiting this beer."
""
"Zum Wohl!"

"D - maybe not my first choice bit it's an easily drinkable and enjoyable beer"
"Overall - Not a bad beer, but nothing stands out either. To sum it up in a word, it's forgettable. The flavors seem to compete with each other, no real defining characteristic. I'd drink it again if offered, for sure, but I wouldn't buy it."

"A great tasting to lager."
""
"Overall, I'm surprised at how well i liked this one. The smell and taste of sweetness is present without being overdone. Highly drinkable. Recommended."
"Not a bad beer, but the malt and hop character seem to be at odds. For the style it's a little sweet. This probably won't be a beer that I seek out again."

"Overall not a really exciting beer but not half bad. Also not worth getting again."
""
"Overall it's a pretty good red but isn't outstanding in any way."
"NOTE: Live review."
"Overall I'm not sure why they didn't blow up this style to a bigger beer. There are good flavors here but really this is one of the most pedestrian ""craft"" beers ever."
"Not that great an example of the style, pass on this one, lack any real flavor or depth"
"Conclusion: This isn't a bad lager, but it seems to lack a clean crispness that the best of this style have. Amber lagers can be quite tasty under the right conditions. The flavors I can taste are good, but they don't mesh as well as they could."
"O: Good malt character. Needs a little carbonation."
"Dr: Cheap enough, and pretty drinkable, but a bit too close to watery for my tastes. I won't have it again, but serious fans of the style might enjoy it."
