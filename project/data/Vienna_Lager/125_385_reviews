"Overall- A nice Vienna Lager, I came across this by accident and if I see it being served I would order it again."

"This was kind of a hazy amber color. It had off tasting muddled, grainy sweetness. This was probably at least partially due to dirty lines at PNC park. But still..."

"Overall –The flavors of the brew were rather nice, as the drier yet still somewhat complex flavors of the brew were quite appropriate for the style, making it a rather good choice. If only the body was a bit thinner and carbonation a bit higher than this would have been very enjoyable for the flavors and style. Overall however, the brew is well worth a try."

"Good with Mexican food and most food, really. Perhaps its best attribute , good food pairing ."

"The flavor is more helles than vienna to me but still could pass for either -there is a lot of pils taste for the low abv with mild floral hop accents and subtle yeast flavor which adds some depth with a gentle mineral note. The overall impression is it is pretty decent for a german style lager pretty expressive and very full of flavor but I consider it more helles so it doesn't fit the style to a T in my opinion...but very drinkable nonetheless."

"A solid drinkable pilsner which goes down smooth and pairs well with average food like a burger or a chicken sandwich. Doesn't try to do much more than that. Just a solid lager, worth having."

"O - Pretty decent for a 4% brew. More malt-focused than crisp/bitter hops. Had this in a Pilsnerpalooza tasting with their Kaiser Pils, Troegs Sunshine Pils, Victory Prima Pils, Church Breworks Celestial Gold Pils. and Victory-Fat Heads collaboration ""United"" Pils. This Penn Pilsner finished below all the above although it shouldn't be discounted to the point of ignoring it. It certainly gets props for being sessionable and decent-tasting."

"Overall: This was not a Vienna-lager. Whatever style it represented it was awful. I am confident to say this because I have enjoyed this beer for over 15 years. This was not even comparable to Sam Adams Boston Lager or the Great Lakes Eliot Ness. This brewery does not consistently produce this product well. I am not sure why this beer is totally different than in the past, but I will never order it again."
"Moderately overpriced but crushes tha mainstream Miller, Coors, and Budweisers of the world."

"Get this as it is good. Very drinkable! But keep in mind this isn't a traditional pilsner as the label suggests."
"Overall: Served itself well as an aperitif before heating up some sad, old leftovers. Thanks, Penn Pilsner, thank you for that."

"Frosty gold beer with a thin, soapy head. Has a bready, fruity aroma with hints of spice and orange. Flavors of fruit, oats, light spice; the taste is very crisp and dry. Has a good body without seeming heavy-this is certainly something I'd drink again."
""
""

"Flagship beer with flagship taste."
""
"This is ok (though I finds it's much better as it warms). That said, I have fond memories of visiting Penn Brewing a few years ago and I reckon I have a soft spot for several of their beers."
"Overall this is their flagship beer and I must say I don't like it as much as the gold or dark. Ow well can't love them all."

"Nice beer."
"Ok brew. The tart edge threw me, and is really a distraction and a negative trait. A bit of a raw beer."
"Notes: A very drinkable Lager overall. Cheers."
"O - Not my kind of beer. Nothing special going on overall. The smell ruined it for me."
"Some days this hits the spot and other days, not so much. Today happens to be a good one. Sessionable at what, 4% ABV? Have mercy."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, saaz hops and a small caramel like roast. In the taste, saaz hops, a caramel like roast, quite crisp and a nice dryer end. A hop bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pils hop in the aftertaste. Big hop presence and mellow overall."
"overall: premium lager-pilsner, all the attributes are there, nothing to rave about, but nothing to knock about it either."
"Flavor is similar to the nose advertises with grainy malt and a little toffee, actually just a bit of general malt sweetness. There are a bit of spicy hops but not huge flavor contribution. I enjoy this beer but was thrown by ordering a pilsner and getting a vienna lager."
"Richer body than I would expect. Comes across like a pale ale. The hop is less flowery than the Czech versions of pils. Fairly typical malt base."
"Overall not bad, a nice easy drinking summer beer, hops are an interesting character, the light DME like aroma and flavor takes away from it a bit, but it's not that strong."
"Overall: A disappointment for me. This smelled so good, but the taste fell flat as the flavors really just did not mesh well. I have had lots better in the style and will pass on this in the future."
"Hip Hip Horay Penn Brewery!!!"
"Overall, I enjoyed it and would have it again when in the mood for a pilsner/light lager."
"This beer pous a golden color with a small long lasting head. The smell was weak and watery. The taste is light and a bit sweet. Very easy to drink and very nicely caronated, could use more flavor. Overall not bad could be better, like a watered down sam adams."
"O: Not a bad beer by any means. Not great, yet not subpar by any means. Having lived in Pittsburgh for a number of years, I'll come back to this one if nothing other than supporting a PA brewery. Cheers!"
"D - A good representation of the style, but nothing in particular that would make me come back to it."
"The first taste is surprisingly sweet and it's apparent the brewers are pursuing a more Bavarian-style pilsner (as opposed to the paler and crisper Bohemian versions or the drier Northern German varieties). With a hoppy Hallertau bite that's rather more of a nibble, this brew could easily be considered a Vienna lager, rather than a true pils. Still, it's a very nice, drinkable brew that would serve its consumer well over the course of an evening."
"M/D - mouthfeel is a itthin but not bad, leaves a pleasant hop aftertaste. Reasonably drinkable but I think the flavor profile might get to me after a few."
"An amber Vienna-style lager beer that is smooth, mellow and full bodied, with delicate hop aroma. A session beer head and shoulders above most in this style. I have this beer on tap in my man cave, it is easy drinking, great tasting and priced perfectly. A must try for someone who wants to get into drinking craft brews."
"D: Goes down easily, very tasty, mild kick, nice representation of style. This beer completely hit the spot. One to drink for a while."
" The original owner recently came out of retirement and bought the brewery back. He was upset that his labor of passion was run into the ground and eventually closed and contracted the brewing out of the area. Well Penn Brewery is back and is now brewing on site again and it shows. This is the Penn Brew we loved not that other stuff that just had their name on it. This is what Pennsylvania German craft beer is all about my friends. Thanks to Tom Pastorius for bringing traditonal German craft beer back to Pittsburgh. Try it. It's a great lager. Cheers!"
"Deep golden color head disapates quick. Smells grassy and of saaz hops pretty clean. Tastes like a pilsner with a clean hop crispness and a nice flowery aftertaste with some grassy notes with some pilsner malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is drying and thin just how a pils should be. Very drinkable. It hit the style on the head even though BA has called this a Vienna Lager it is a pilsner. Prost!"
"This beer reinforces the fact that some of America's best beer comes from the beautiful state of Pennsylvania. A total winner from Steel City. Drink it."
"D - nostalgia for me, one of if not the first craft beer i ever had. did me very well back in my college days. this is easy drinking all night."
"Pours a very yellow/golden (not anywhere near amber) color, but with some nice head and lacing, along with a lot of carbonation. Very malty and lager-ish aroma, more of a macro ""skunk"" lager aroma than having a clean and crisp scent. Decent taste, a nice crisp maltiness, and just a slight bit of noble hoppishness at the end. Goes down fairly well, but a bit over-carbonated."
"A: Impressive head which has stuck around for several minutes and leaves some sticky spots down the side of the glass, medium gold in color with a slight copper hue, lots of active and visible carbonation - 4.25, S: There's a pronounced doughy sweetness to the nose as well as some caramel and possibly pear - 4.00, D: Mild to moderate hop bitterness especially at the tail of the taste, quite herbal and grainy, subdued but noticeable sweetness - 3.50, M: Smooth and medium bodied - 3.50, D: A respectable pilsner, very quaffable - 3.75"
"My concern is that I am simply enjoying this as a first beer of the evening and that if I had more maybe it wouldn't still sit so well. It's sitting well enough now that I will have to seek some out. Another problem may be finding this around here."
"D-very easy drinking and has big flavor for such a low alcohol content beer. definitely a great session beer!"
"Pours a clear golden color with a finger of white head. Fair amount of lace clinging on the glass. Aroma is light in malt and a bit of citrus hops. Has a lingering aftertaste that is somewhat grainy with a lingering sweetness that is offset by a bit of hop bitterness. As it warms, a bit of caramel comes out in the nose. Medium to light feel with mild amount of carb. Overall not bad, I would drink it again."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable, nothing that I would seek out, yet wouldn't turn down if I were offered."
"Overall, not the tastiest of all the session beers I have had, but this one is not too bad. Definitely recommended if you just want to kick back and have a session beer."
"This isn't really a pilsner, not as hoppy as most, but I still really enjoy this as a fantastic session beer."
"Drinkability: High as heaven with this one - very tasty beer and nice light body that went well with the food (Italian, if you're wondering); not heavy in the least and this would be an easy beer to drink in a session with that really low 4% ABV."
"Bottle smell is a little skunky, hope the taste can prevail. Pours to a golden yellow with a medium bubble head that recedes but leaves lacing. Taste is malty and dry with traces of bitter hoppiness in the finish. Very light and crisp yet flavorful. This tastes like a distinctly German brew without a doubt. Good flavor for the lightness of the style. A very refreshing brew for hot weather. A high class"" lawnmower brew"" or a great brew for BMC breaking into craft. A tasty example of the style."
"D: This is certainly a Vienna lager and not a pilsner -- strange to name it a pilsner and then call it a Vienna on the back label. Tastes sweetly malty with not quite enough hops in the finish to make it interesting. I like it but wouldn't seek it out."
"Everything about this beer just seems to border on reminding me of something horrible and disasterous. It's not bad, but I almost feel like something bad will happen when I drink it. I could drink more of these, but not going to seek it out by any means."
"N: A nice beer. Could easily drink a few of these with friends."
"Notes: I really enjoyed this. Sessions with this beer are great and while it states that it is Pilsner it is actually a Vienna Lager. What a good beer that is so easy to drink."
"This is the second Penn beer I've had, and both had a very strong mineral taste which I cannot stand."
"D - I could pound these all night! If I am drinking a pils its early in the session, and it doesn't take long to switch to a darker brew. But I could definately have a few before I thought about moving on."
"Comes out of the tap a clear golden yellow with a thick white head. Aroma is crisp, malty and quite inviting. Flavor is crisp and malty like a typical pilsner, with a fruity undertone and more rounded out than most pilsners I have tried. Texture is tingly, lively and sassy. I am not a big fan of pilsners or lagers, but I did like this one and I recommend it to pilsner lovers."
"Offering from the beer of the month club. I'm not usually a big lager fan, but this was wonderfully drinkable. Poured a nice, clear gold with a foamy white head. Grains hit you up front with a sharp spice undertone. This is a great beer after mowing the lawn, which I just happened to do today right before drinking. I'm not sure I'd buy these if I was out shopping, but definitely not upset to have found three of them on my doorstep. A very decent and well made pils."
"Drank very easy a Vienna lager that matches most I had over in Germany"
"This pour was a translucent gold with a small bit of head. The smell was nothing special, but certainly appealing. I was expecting this to be more hoppy than it was, but the hops taste was more grassy than I was expecting and I was pleased. My big complaint is that I could barely tell of was drinking this beer. I was about halfway through that I kind of wished I was drinking something else. It was smooth and easy to drink, however it was a bit boring overall."
" ~ Other than the looks I'd have to say this is one you might wanna pass on. I will say this though, I like the photo of the old man on the label. Now if only the beer had that kind of character."
"D - This is a very nice Vienna-style lager. It's clean and malty and very well balanced. It's very sessionable also."
"Beer of the Month Club arrival that poured a gold/orange color, with a small white head that smelled malty with a whiff of orange. Malt and yeast flavor combo up front, with a crisp earthy finish that has a hint of spice; medium to heavy carbonation makes it a crisp beer that goes down smooth. Overall a bit dull, but it's an OK to good pilsner based on the slight spice taste. After drinking 3 of them I conclude it's a little boring for my liking, and I wouldn't seek it out at a bar."
"Very drinkable. Pretty refreshing, I wouldn't mind having a few of these."
"Of the May BOM brews this was my favorite. Poured into a pilsner glass this brew is a golden wheat color with a clean white head that left no lacing but settled in a nice cap. The aroma is very doughy with some sweet floral notes. The taste is crisp and had a bread taste but there was a faint floral balance and a mild bitter bite in the finish. This was moderate in body and a little higher in carbonation. All around solid brew. The taste was so fresh, crisp, and refreshing. I wish I had more to share (but the cost for an extra 12 pack is just too much). I guess I will need to keep my eyes open if in Pennsylvania."
"Maybe on the sweeter and darker side of the Pilsner spectrum, but definitely refreshing. Recommended."
"Overall- A simple easy drinker."
"This beer has a rich golden amber color with hues of autum orange. Virtually no head or lace. It has a somewhat sour yeasty smell, not that appealing. The taste is very bready and yeasty with some hints of carmel. Leaves a nice tingling sensation throughout the mouth. If find this beer quite drinkable. Pairs well with wings."
"Very drinkable."
"this has easily become one of my favorites, just wish it was more available."
"If you like SA Boston Lager or Brooklyn Lager, I'd say give this one a try. Doesn't have the same hop character--American style hopping is truly unique--but is much fresher than a similar-styled beer coming from Germany. Not a pilsner, so the name's stupid, but just forget that once you pour it into a glass!"
"D: Exceedingly drinkable. Definitely looking forward to these over the summer. Fiancee thinks its ""okay."""
"Overall, this is really a good beer, just don't call it a Pilsner. Very sessionable at 5%."
"D - An easy drinking beer, if only because it's bland. An average beer, but it misses the mark of both a pilsner and Vienna lager."
"M/D - not a whole lot to this one in my opinion. I don't think I'd search it out again."
"single from Whole Foods Raleigh"
"D: very enjoyable lager; would definitely make this a go-to beer. Good local when looking for something in the pilsner or vienna lager genre."
"Pours a clear, dark yellow with a quickly receeding two finger soapy head and leaves some lace patches. A mix of grassy, earthy hops and some sweet malts like caramel or honey. This beer is real smooth, smoother than most pils I've had and has a more pronounced hop/malt balance. Good and dry on the tongue with a crisp finish, this medium-bodied beer also is a little creamy and a tad sweet. I'll have this again anytime."
"D-Very drinkable , a great session brew and luckily brewed 20 minutes from me and always available."
"I like it. The US needs more brewers taking the German styles and giving them a twist like this."
"Poured a medium brown, small head. Hazy in appearance, odd for a pils. Not a real strong presence of anything to me in the aroma of this beer, hoppy, grassy, and a light hint of sweet apple.. I don't know if it's because it's 10 am in the morning, but I smell an undertone of bready Guinness in this one for some reason. Tasted bread notes, grainy and malty.. Started out a little sweet and finishes a little bitter, nothing outstanding in the taste either. Mouthfeel is thin and light, drinkability is pretty average to me.. Overall not a bad brew for something from my own state."
"D: Another solid offering from Penn, PA should be proud to have a well rounded, classic style brewer like this sharing it's name. Don't go too far out of your way for this one, but if your in Western PA, pick one up."
"My brother and sister-in-law brought back a bottle of this from brewery. Decanted into a pilsner glass. Pours a clear orangish color with a thin white head. Good clean smells and tastes. A bit biscuity. Kind of your standard pilsner. Loose mouthfeel - a little bit of fizz. Overall good although not exceptional."
"Poured this into a 12 oz glass from a 12 oz bottle. The color is a light to medium straw color with some visible carbonation and a small amount of head that disipates quickly. The taste and smell are rather bland, some hops are evident but not much else. There's a nice crisp taste to this beer, nothing spectacular but it's a decent beer. It's not my favorite so I can't see keeping it on hand except that it comes as part of the brewery's Gourmet Selection. Hey...it's a good lawnmowing brew!!!"
"Could drink this often."
"This particular one was a little on the flat side, but not a bad drink."
"Overall not a bad pick. Not a champion but not bad."
"Not bad but wouldn't be my pick for a nice Pils to drink on a warm day. Golden colored, smallish head but some nice lacing is produced. The flavor is sweet fruits with some grassy notes. Mild hops but they are sweet and the whole flavor seems just a little too sweet. Decent mouthfeel but not as crisp as I'd like a Pils to be. It's quite drinkable but no better than average."
"This is a well made beer with enough flavor and character to satisfy."
"Another note on this brew is the resemblence it has to its european brethren. This tastes like something coming from Europe, not the states."
"Recommended..."
"Poured into a plastic cup. But a amberish deep copper good looking beer. Big head with lots of lace. Smells sweet. And the taste backs that up. Sweet malts upfront with an earth graininess(is that a word)with a sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and crisp. Nice tasty beer that goes down well at the baseball game."
"Drinkability: very easy to drink lager and much better than the usual macro offerings. Worth picking some of this up for some easy to drink beer."
"Pours a crisp dark yellow with a thin head that diminishes to nothing. The aroma is a very weak trace of sweet malts and citrus hops. The taste is a nice jump up from the aroma, nice sweetness with a decent hop balance that leaves a nice lingering finish. The beer is very light and crisp, a refreshing summer beer. This is an enjoyable beer, but I'd have to be in the mood for the style to try it again."
"Drinkability- Very tasty beer, good summer beer."
"Nicely drinkable due to balane, a solid brew."
"D: This is definitely a beer I try to find at the stadium checking out the Pirates, trying to support the local guys. Good in the summertime."
"Pours a clear golden hue with a full one finger white fluffy head that sticks around for a while. Nice creamy lacing is left on the sides of the glass as the cloudy foam dies down to a thin layer. Continuous bubbles rise to the top throughout the entire tasting. Smell is pretty sugary. A good amount of grain, malt, and honey. A bit of freshly cut summer grass in the nose as well. Overall, pretty sweet aroma. Toasted grains on the tongue up front followed by more of that sweet malty goodness. A minor metallic flavor is hidden underneath all the sweetness which I could do without. Aftertaste is a bit watery with a hay like flavor. Medium body with a creamy feel and steady carbonation, pleasing to the mouth. A bit too sweet for me, but still very refreshing. Definitely worth a shot, especially with summer approaching."
"A very fresh herbal smell with a taste that is very consistent - more body and flavor than a macro pilsner, but just as drinkable, cold on a spring or summer day. Have come to prefer their Dark, St Nicholas Bock, Marzen and my favorite, their Weizen, but this is a very nice go-to beer for company, who might want an alternative from the standard Crap Light. Very nice after grass cutting. Easy to find in Western Pa."
"Final Thought: An excellent example of a German pils that is considered a vienna lager, but hey... it's all good!"
"This is a very solid brew, very sessionable. Not in the same league as some other Vienna's like Great Lakes Eliot Ness, but very good in its own right."
"D - It is a little light for the style I think. But enough flavor to make it enjoyalbe. Because of its mellowness this goes down quite easily. I probably would not buy this again. If faced with Sam or this, I would likely take the Sam."
"Mouthfeel is not too heavy, a little slick. Overall this is a relatively nice brew, could go through a few of these pretty quickly and easily. Won't overwhelm your palate if you pair it with food. No idea how much a 6 goes for, as I picked this up as a single... but yah. Nice brew."
"Pennsylvania Brewing Company Penn Pilsner pours a clear golden yellow typical of light lagers. Smell is ever so slightly malted, but mostly nothing. Aromas given off are similar to that of a German style lager. The taste is as well, but its watered down and on the weak side with not a whole lot to offer. Mouthfeel for the best part is light and smooth, but it is also thin and watery. Drinability is fair at best, it's easy to choke down but its lack of everything makes it rather dull."
"overall a very easy drinking, basic , quality craft beer. great beer to drink in the spring and summer months."
"This beer poured a nice golden, straw color with a huge, fluffy white head which dissaptes fairly slowly. The aroma is of citrus and bread not much hops detected. The taste was a bit metallic but not so as to be off-putting. The taste was light. Not too much flavor to it but it is a drinkable beer. Very refreshing on a hot day. The mouthfeel was medium body with medium-high carbonation. Overall not a bad brew."
"Just tried this last weekend and I like it. Pours a nice medium yellow with touch of Grain in the smell,kind of toasty grain. Pours with about 3/4 inch head light lacing in the glass. Mouth feel is very nice as soon as I had one I ended up having 3. A very flavorful drinkable Pilsner in the old style. I have to say for the price not cheap, but they have hit a home run on this one I will go back for more in the very near future. This is one very Drinkable Beer!"
"Nothing special, but not a bad beer. Poured a little darker than most Pilsners, but still had the grainy nose and taste of Pilsners Medium bodied with a short finish. Pretty much a so-so beer. Unfortunately, this is another one of those Pilsners that would be okay if served very cold on a hiot summer day, but one to be avoided if looking for an enjoyable sipping beer."
"D - Overall this is just an average beer it has more taste than a macro but not by much"
"Pours a very chill-hazed dark straw color with a soon to fall quarter inch of head. Aromas are just dominated by a barely colored malt with an overall grainy sense. I believe there is some slight skunking in this bottle. Having tried SA Imp Pils, I know what Hallertaus should taste like, and this one doesn't give too much of the flavor or aroma of them. A medium light bodied lager, this one has just a touch of sweetness with the lightly toasted malts taking over. I really am missing much of Hallertaus delicate floral flavor in this bottle, hopefully it is not too old. A crisp and dry lager, nice for the summer, but one I will probably not revisit."
"The beer was an amber color. It seemed a little dark to me for a pilsner. I heard the beer was a good one, and overall, I was not disappointed. I liked the taste. It had a good hop character, and clean taste. It wasn't very heavy, and I felt like I could have several (if I had been so inclined) without getting filled up."
"Golden in appearance with a one inch head served in a pilsner glass. Slight toasty smell with a hint of grains. The first taste was refreshing and a slight tart taste and a hint of lemon. A drinkable beer. A good pilsner that sticks to the glass and palate. Really enjoy this offering from a beer of the month club. Thank the wife for that."
"D- This beer has a nice full flavor for a Pilsner and good depth yet still subtle. I was shocked at how quaftable this beer was."
"D - pretty good I'd wager. I'm not the hugest pils fan, but this going down rather nicely and I look forward to drinking the others. Worth a shot, and this is coming from a total hophead."
"This is a good thirst-quenching beer and a great choice for an everyday brew that doesn't blow you away with powerful flavors."
"Overall a great beer with a lot of flavor for this style."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a decent off white head that does not really stick around too long. Nose is a bit woody with a slight perfume to it. Flavor is much more robust than I was expecting. Thick tree character with a stringent sweet edge that has an overall thick caramel tone to it. Feel is smooth on the liquid with a fairly low carbonation. Very drinkable. A very well made brew with a lot of body and character to it. Definitely worth a try."
"D- could be my new summer beer, drinkable...no, chuggable"
"I think there's some identity confusion between the ""pilsner"" on the label and actual style, but it's still a good beer regardless. It doesn't have the rich caramel malt of a SA Boston Lager, but there's still a smooth sweetness with a touch of esters. A crisp, grassy hops note finishes out the beer to make it a nice, clean lager with character."
"After the smell test, I was concerned that Penn Pilsner would be nothing more than another forgettable, Euro-style lager. It's much more than that, though. It's a very good example of a style that too few American craft brewers will tackle. Even though I've only had two beers from these guys (St. Nick Bock), I'm mightily impressed so far."
"I poured the 12oz bottle in to a pint glass and it had a ordinary appearance for the style I believe. It was a light gold color. The smell was pretty much of adjuncts like corn. It was a good crisp smell. The taste pretty much followed suite with the smell, it had sort of a corn laced taste, but was crisp and refreshing. Hit the spot so to speak. There was barely any head, I don't know enough yet to know if there should be for this style. :( It felt great in the mouth and I feel would be a good summertime beer. It was pretty drinkable because it wasn't too heavy in the mouth or stomach. I would very much get this again if I am ever in Pittsburgh again to visit the brewery or can find it somewhere here in Ohio."
"This is an extremely drinkable, light version of a vienna lager which leads me to question the name, ""Penn Pilsner."" Even the brewery website describes the beer as a ""vienna lager."" In any event, I quality lager I highly recommend; despite the lightness of the beer, the taste is complex and remains appealing."
"Very clear and dark gold with a short cap of fine, white foam. Good head retention with lots of lacing that showed some stickage. Big hop aroma, mostly floral and a bit sulfury, with a mild grainy malt quality. The flavour was quite malty, but not overly sweet, with a low, solid bitterness. Some grain character with faint caramel and spicy/floral hops. Fairly dry with a light body and moderate carbonation. A decent lager, though it misses the mark for a pilsner, and a decent summer beer."
"D: Reasonable. It's not as refreshing as other pilsners I've tried. I could have a couple in a session if I wanted to, but I won't stock my fridge with them."
"Nice dark red/orange color. No head or lacing to speak of. Some sediment floating around. Not sure what that is?! Taste is very smooth, fairly light, and decent flavor. Drinkability is prob. pretty high with this, being that it's pretty light. Very malty...caramel-ly...and yeast-y. Not a bad brew, but I think I like the Penn Dark better. (Although that's light too, for a dark beer, but it's good.) I'd recommend Penn's brews. They seem to do a quality job. Just not sure why the Pilsner is brewed out of state, and not in The Burgh like the rest. Good stuff, Penn. Bottoms up my friends!"
"Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear bright gold/orange color with a half inch white head which goes away very quickly. It smells like grassy hops, sweet malt and some bread/grain. Overall the aroma is light, but clean. It tastes like toasted malt, grassy hops and bread with a slight bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light/medium, and it's crisp and smooth. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and it wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these at a time. Overall I think this is a decent beer, good and easy drinking."
"Don't drink and review."
"D- This was pretty good overall. I'd session it if it was the best choice available. My least favorite of the Penn Brews that I have had so far and it happens to be their flagship. go figure. Its a decent pils but I probably won't have it again being that I like thier other brews so much."
"A nice German pilsner all in all and a another good beer by the Pittsburgh Brewery."
"Sean"
"It's light-bodied, but got some depth and complexity. Very drinkable.Solid"
"A fairly light mouthfeel,tangy with some slight cloying. Very easy drinking, could drink this beer all summer long. Very good summer session beer. Could keep this beer on tap all summer long"
"All Penn beers taste best when fresh and on tap this is a very good beer. The consistency once was a problem but with more in house brewing this beer seems to taste good every pour. Not really a pilsner, not really a Vienna, but a very good lager. A little bit sweet but very easy to drink more than one. Highly recommended when in Pittsburgh."
"This beer pours a bright deep gold. Has an inch thick bubbly head that dissipated rather quickly with a little bit of lace. The aroma is of light spicy hops with some fruity undertones. The malty aroma is in the background and comes through in the flavor. It balances nicely with the hop flavors. There are some light DMS flavors in the middle. But they are only light. The mouth feel is light and crisp. But it has a rather salty feel to it. Overall its a rather drinkable beer, but not outstanding."
"From the beer of the month club. 12 oz. Bottle. The beer pours a clear golden yellow with a white head and slick lacing. The aroma is full hop sweet malt and earth. The taste is smooth and malty with a light body and crisp, clean finish. Very drinkable and clean pilsner."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours light golden, low carbonation, with a thin white head. Smells slightly of toasted caramel. Has a mild tart start and a malt finish. Smooth and tasty, a good session beer, and good staple to come back to. Not a true pilsner, but hey, who's counting?"
"D- A very good beer, which could, and no doubt, will be, enjoyed all night."
"This bottle was a gift from friend Paul B. Poured with a nice head that soon faded; no lace. Has a hazy amber color. Nose was sweet, bready, caramel malt. Flavor is a bit tart however; maybe from the carbonation. Shallow beer. Not at all a pilsner. The finish is the sensation of the carbonation on the tongue and not much else."
"Pours a transparent copper color with a short-lived white head. Aroma consists of mild fruit notes with a touch of the hops...not much else there. Taste begins with some slight hop bitterness, with a hint of orange peel, and finishes with a bread / cereal like grain character that lingers for a bit. Light bodied...carbonation might be too much, but doesn't hurt it's drinkability. Goes down the hatch very easy. Not exactly a benchmark for the style, but it is a quality beer in it's own right, and is very much available in the surrounding areas."
"Excellent. A fine beer. Refreshing & sessionable. Not going to blow your mind with flavor or ABV, but a pleasure to drink. I think this is going to start me exploring this category again."
"Pours a nice thick white head. Carries some decent lacing down the glass. Smell, very average, as are most of Penn's beers. But it tastes of slight twingy hops and a very malty sweet front. Very easy to drink. Six can probably be consumed in a short period of time. A very nice session beer."
"Poured cloudy gold in the glass with a small foamy head that went quickly, leaving a fairly flat, foamless top. Not much in the way of visible carbonation (cloudy?) but definitely there in the moderately thin mouthfeel. Smell is mild malt with a touch of fruity hops; taste is the same, but with a somewhat pleasant tartness that is really unique (if a true German-style pils). Incredibly fresh taste and oh so smooth that it goes down with food or as a session drink. In this case, it's lack of complexity is actually a benefit, as you can really enjoy the drink. I bought a whole case (had to... it's PA) a month ago and have been enjoying it ever since. As Penn's brews go, this is one of the least flavorful and yet it's great."
"Draught: This one pours a slightly dark, mostly clear golden color. Mine had very little head and only a little bit of lacing. The aroma was a bit lighter. There were some notes of sweetness, otherwise fairly non-descript. The taste was OK. A decent beer, but not a true pilsner. Some malts, a hair bitter. Not a bad session beer, but nothing special."
"12oz. bottle clear clean dark golden color with small white head leaving spotty lacing around the glass. Smells of malt and a faint of scent hops. Taste of light caramel malts and a bit of a hop bite. Feels crisp, clean and refreshing and is very drinkable. An easy beer to turn to when your in the mood for something light and thirst quenching."
"tried this one again. it is growing on me. stats have been adjusted accordingly. i found this bottle to be full-flavored and delicious. pretty looking pour as well."
"Pours a light honey amber with a foamy head that dissipates quickly. Slight lacing, good carbonation. Smells of funky malts and hops, smells like a pilsner. Taste is pretty well balanced, slightly hoppy yet refreshing as well as having some actual malty body (which poor pilsners seem to lack). Overall, a pretty decent pilsner."
"D: The beer is very drinkable. The moderate abv and sweet malt flavors allow you to have a few."
"Beer poured a golden color with a nice white head that is hanging around. I am detecting sweet and sour notes from the boquet which I did not expect. Taste is malty and finishes with a nice crisp hop but not overwhelmingly hoppy. Mouthfeel finishes crisp and clean. It is medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall drinkability is good. I am impressed with this brewery and will seek them out if in the western Pa. area in the future."
"The drinkability as A'OK. One fine and fresh example of a difficult beer to brew right. Prosit MK"
"Dgood. Ill enjoy the other two I received. Easy drinking, but a different pilsner in my opinion.perhaps because it is classified as a Vienna lager?"
"The pour into my Prima Pils glass raises a two-finger off-white head, slow to fall. The lacing is sudsy but sticky. The body is too hazy for a Pils, and in fact, I see it labeled here as a Vienna Lager. I don't see it to be dark enough for that either, despite their website's claims. It's a barely transparent dark gold. The nose is actually quite weak, with only a slight sweet grain aroma. The taste is close to what I expect from a Dortmunder, with less pronounced hop taste, but more body and ""kick"" than a helles. There's really not much to it. The mouth is somewhat thick, and the carbonation is tingly. This is indeed easy to drink, but I'm glad this is my last bottle, since there's not much going for it, and the beer has something of an identity crisis."
"Pours a golden yellow/orange color with white head that quickly turns into a thin lace. Aroma is faint with sweet malt and caramel. Smooth and malty taste that finishes with a dry hop bitterness. Overall, this is a pretty decent brew but lacks anything to make it stand out."
"."
"Drinkability: Overall, not bad but the finish detracts from what would otherwise be a decent session beer"
"On draught at Heinz Field. Amber color with a medium thin beige head with decent retention. Cannot comment on lacing as it was a plastic cup. Lightly malty aroma. Medium-bodied and sweet with malt and caramel flavors. There is a touch of hops character too. The finish is mostly sweet but has touches of bitterness here and there. Pretty average all around."
"This beer poured from the bottle, came out a nice dark golden color, some orange tint. It produced next to no head, with next to no retention, with next to no lacing. It gave off a decent smell, with good malt and some sweet caramel aromas. The taste was OK, but somewhat below average I thought of the style. Again some roasted malt with lightly sweet undertones. Mouthfeel seemed somewhat syrupy, mild carbonation. Overall it was OK, but probably the worst beer I had from Pennsylvania Brewing, which produces some otherwise really good beers."
"Prost!"
"Overall not the greatest example of the style. Certainly drinkable, but there are better out there."
"This is not a pilsner. It looks and tastes like a weak amber lager. Even for that style, this beer does nothing for me."
"This is an orange pilsner with a thin, bubbly head. The nose is quite floral with generous helpings of biscuit and fresh bread aromas. The beer tastes very clean with citrus and date flavors. The carbonation is fairly low and the mouthfeel is crisp. Drinkability is good. This goes well with light, vegetarian fare."
"Overall: Curiously listed as a Vienna Lager and called a Pilsner. Darker and maltier than most, it seems to fall between the two. Styles aside, I just found this to be So-so with a finish that was mucky, as say in Yorkshire."
"A medium bodied vienna with a dry and sweet finish. Now, knowing the style as a vienna I understand its malty aroma and malty taste. Satisfying, not offensive nor interesting. Corn and carmel too, a macro brew replacement. Apparently not made by the brewery."
"An easy session ale, but pretty forgettable for flavor."
"Cheers!"
"Penn Pilsner pours a yellow color with a nice white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is somewhat hoppy with a bit of sweetness. The taste is nicely hoppy, but not overpowering, it doesn't hit you over the head and steal your wallet like some of the double IPA's out there do. There is a bit of sweetness, but it finishes with hops so it doesn't seem too sweet. Nice sessionable pilsner, worth a try."
"It looks good before the head disappears, but it's too dark to be a pilsner. It smells nice, but it's too sweet and bready to be a pilsner. The taste? It's a Vienna lager, with all of the malty, toffee and caramel flavor that you'd expect from Sam Adam's Boston Lager and the like. I was expecting, and looking forward to, the crisp, spicy hop flavor profile of a pilsner, so I'm disappointed, but a solid Vienna Lager for $4 is still worthwhile."
"Another fine traditional german-style beer from Penn Brewing."
"Yeah my chili is goood."
"Not too great of a beer; will drink again, but only because there are 4 left in the pack."
"Drinkability: A solid Pils, and one I'll definitely drink again. I'm sure there are better out there, but for a pretty tasty session beer when you don't want something super complex, this is definitely good for that."
"Notes: Not for me thats for sure. I love a good pils but this one falls a few yards short."
"Poured a clear light brown color with a 1 inch head of white foam and plenty of carbonation bubbles through out the entire Pilsner glass. There wasn't much of an aroma with this one. Mostly some sour hops and with little malt in the background. Not too pleasant. The taste was like the smell except it wasn't sour, Mostly hops with just a little malt in the background. The mouthfeel was a bit too watery and thin. There also some bitter hops in the aftertaste. It did make for a nice above average Pilsner beer, but it isn't my favorite from Penn Brewery."
"Had it in a pils glass. Was a clear honey color leaning towards golden with a finger of good white head. The bouquet was biscuity and on the grain side which is a good seguey to the taste. That of toast and bread crust on the dry side. Good balance and carbonation on the crisp side. I wasnt wowed but the brew was good. I'm new to the Pils style so i'll revisit this brew after i have more of the style under my belt."
"Cheers"
"I would get this again. I'm not sure it's in the right style; I think it should be a Vienna. It's pretty damn good, whatever it is."
"An OK drinkable beer but this did not wow me."
"label states ""brewed and bottled for Penn Brewing by Frederick Brewing Co"". Poured a dark amber color with slightly off-white head that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is malty and a bit sweet. Taste follows through with the maltiness and a nice finishing dryness. A nice tasting easy beer."
"Clear gold in color. A little darker than you would normally expect from a pils. Thick lumpy white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Smell is mostly malts with a slight hops citrus. Malt taste that is balanced nicely by the hops. Just a touch of hops bitterness at the end. Nice drinkable beer. As a friend of mine said it's Yuengling Lager without the skunk."
"Drinkability: I have had this in bottle before, and I didnt remember this being so malty. I think its so malty that it really doesnt taste like a pilsner, more of an American lager. Still, it was enjoyable and very drinkable. But I did have to dock it some points for not being a good representation of the style."
"12 ouncer sampled, no freshness dating to be found. Pours cloudy orangy amber, with a white head, leaving nice, fine lacing. Nose is of slightly burnt crayons. Not all that fond of this one, lacks the typical clean crisp hopping of the finer pilsners that I've come to enjoy. this is mostly malty thru the midsection, and not as snappy in the finish as would be expected from the top notch examples of the style. Prima Pils, I agree, would be the choice of Pennsylvania Pilsners"
"Smooth for a pilsner, more malt than hops, with a (theres that word again) surprising caramel peak right on the tongue, which slides into a slightly more hops than malt finish. This was...well, that word...for a pilsner, not bitter at all. Very drinkable. This could easily be mistaken for a lager in a blind test. While not spectacular or a roller coaster ride of taste, its certainly better than everything else that was on tap here in PA, with the possible exception of Yuengling. Certainly worth a try."
"A small foamy head is produced from pouring this dark golden, almost amber beer. The smell is light malt and a hint of hops with a sort of metal/oily aroma lurking in the background. The taste is malty, reminiscent of corn and yields to light hopping with slight spice in the back. This beer sits well on the tongue, but might be a bit too watery, however, I say that about a lot of beers. I mean, water is the main ingredient in beer, so.... Anyway, this was a good beer, but for a Pilsner it lacked the sharper hops quality I have come to expect. I'd have a Prima Pils before this one, no contest."
"Taste is similarly plain. Rather common malt flavor and placid flavors doesn't completely turn me off, but its nothing too intersting. A seeming lack of bitterness leaves crispness, a preferred attribute in pils missing. Its not bad, but just not very good."
"Thanks to Francisweizen for this one. No freshness date. Pours a light apricot in color with some haze. Very thin head that quickly settled to a ring of teensie bubbles around the glass. No lacing. Smells of honey, apples, and hops (Saaz?). Tastes malty. Sweet with some vienna character. Noticable hop, not bitter, just tasty. Probably not Saaz as I guess in the smell, it's more likely Hallertauer. A hint of frutiy, which isn't to style, rides along with the chalky character of the Vienna malt. Mediuim mouthefeel, a nice example of the style."
"Totally clear golden pour with a bit of carbonation and minimal head. Surprisingly thick, sweet smell of malts with a whiff of hop bitterness. Sweet, bready taste that might be overly cloying were it not for hoppy flavors that balance the malts throughout. Uncommonly thick, smooth texture is a real treat and makes this a very drinkable pilsner."
"When poured into a pilsner glass you can really get a look at the rich golden color. This beer is an easy drink with a good aftertaste. Unfortunately, I have to cross the border to PA because they do not sell this beer in my hometown. One of my regulars."
"Had on tap at Bruno's in Indiana, PA. Pours a clear amber with little to no head. Smells very balanced with nothing but malts and hops. Taste quite bready and malty at first, with the hops shining through at the end. On tap it tastes much hoppier than out of the bottle. The carbonation is great. Got a little bored with the brew near the bottom of the glass. Overall this is a nice pilsner, a little above average, but nothing complex or special."
"This has long been one of my favorites. It's what I used to keep in the fridge all the time. I took a little break from it though and just had one on tap and am rating it for the first time. The appearance in good. A little more amber color than a pilsner usually is, but it just looks delicious in the glass. The smell is staightforward malt and hops. Taste is outstanding. Perfect balance to my taste. Bready malt flavor balanced nicely with hops that are not overpowering, bitter or dry. Just right. Mouthfeel is good. Not thin, not thick. Carbonation is right on. Very, very, very drinkable. I will be buying a case of the bottles very soon."
"Easy to drink. This is a very good pils."
"All-in-all a very nice beer."
"Pours a deep golden pilsener color with a big thicket of off-white colored head. Bready, biscuity and grainy pilsener malt profile with a bit of floral-like hops thrown in to balance. Tastes mostly malty sweet with a small hop finish that is pretty crisp. Good for a U.S. brewed German style pils, but pretty average when compared to it's European counterparts. Enjoyable."
"This is a very drinkable brew and I'd certainly recommend it... I'd have given a higher ranking for both taste and mouthfeel but I felt I had to deduct points for deviating from the style. When I drink a pilsner, I expect a more carbonated, light-bodied beer with a pretty light taste and a crisp finish. If you had handed me an unmarked glass of this brew I would have guessed it was an amber ale and would have said lots of very complimentary things about it - it's a complex, well-balanced brew. But it's not what I'm looking for when I open up a Pilsner."
"Drinkability - a good beer that could be enjoyed on any occasion."
"This beer (and it's advertizements) seem to be everywhere in Pittsburgh. On a recent trip, I had pleanty of bottles, and was suprized at how drinkable the beer is. It's golden and clear, with a thick, bubbly head. Moderate carbonation and a nice flowery hop aroma. It's initially sweeth and malty, with little breadiness. Very soft and extremely drinkable. I didn't expect much, but the beer was fantastic."
"D&N: A very nice beer from a local (to me, at least) brewery. Alcohol level isn't too high, smells and flavor are very nice. I'd recommend this one."
"Pours a clear, medium gold with a one inch beige head that has good retention. Sheets of lacing follow. Nice aroma of sweet caramel malt, lemony ctrus, and a touch of pine. Taste is extremely pleasant. The sweet malt backbone is well balanced by the bittering and aromatic Hallertau hops which lend considerable bittering. This one finishes clean and dry. This may be the best Pilsner I've ever sampled. Certainly, the best American pilsner I've had. This is only my second brew from Penn, but I've been very impressed with the quality of these Pittsburgh brews."
"Pretty good pilsner, maybe a tad too sweet. Kind of boring but not offensive, not an everyday beer but interesting to try."
"Pours a darker golden,darker than most pilsners I have had,aroma is malty and bready not to sweet.Taste is a nice malt accented crisp as a cracker with some zesty hop in there but this more of crisp,dry malt accented brew.A little more heavy I thought than most of the style but still a appetizing beer none the less."
"Prosit!"
"How sad is that?"
"Translucent amber-to-bronze in color with light carbonation; about one finger of white head, small to medium-sized bubbles, after a vigorous pour. Head becomes spotty and quickly fades; clings slightly before sliding down edges of glass. Aroma has a soft, cookielike malt basis--shortbread?--with slightly fruity hops rounding out. Good, clean lager flavor, although as the color would suggest, a bit bolder and nearer to a pale lager than most of the other pilseners I've had. Flavors are nicely balanced, though: bread-and-buttery maltiness finishing with slightly lemony hops. Mouthfeel not quite as light and refreshing as other pilseners--again, a pilsener leaning towards pale lager; still, this has a smooth, medium fullness to the body which is consistent from start to finish. Highly drinkable; mellow flavor combined with satisfying body. One of my staple beers... a good beer for everyday drinking."
"Medium amber color. Small head. Aroma is malty and slightly sweet. A medium bodied pilsner. Darker colored and very malty and hoppy for a pilsner. Perhaps it supposed to be a cross between a Pilsner and an amber? Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are citrusy. Touch of orangish flavor in the taste. I'm not sure what this beer is supposed to be, it not a pilsner and not an amber or Vienna. Its somewhere between the two and gets sort of lost somewhere along the way. Its drinkable but lacks any sort of identity. Mouthfeel is round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Per label: ""2 row barley malt, Hallertau hops"""
"Prickling carbonation and a medium-light body. Overall a pretty nice beer."
"Had this on draft in Pittsburgh. Nice golden copper color - very lively in the glass with tingly carbonation on the tongue. Solid body for the style, with some big malt at the front, that finished up a bit dry. Something about the beer suggested a touch of mineral, like a hopped-up Bass. Very drinkable and pleasant."
"the head comes on big and dies in a half a minute to a lacy blanket and left next to no trace on the glass. clear orange with yellow tinture and a bubbling body. what a great malt this beer has, a wonderful bitter pinch of hops on the mid palate and a floral scent lingering on in the mouth and nose. outstanding scent for a pilsner, not a bit skunky or bland. an earthy quality also is notable with a flavor evoking the early fall by the three rivers. (you don't have to drink iron city to enjoy the steelers without getting beat up.) this is very drinkable if a bit watery. beautiful light beer, loaded with beer. thanks for reading my review."
"This was probably the first micro I ever had in my life, and err, some years later, it's still one that I enjoy quite a bit. It's a shame this isn't a nationally distributed beer..........but hey.......more for us in the Burgh!"
"-F"
"An easy drinking, relatively malty pilsner that lacks some of the qualities I expect in a Pilsner....I want a Pilsner to look clean, and clear, and special....this is a dark gold hazy color....the haziness is a turnoff right away...On the nose I want some spiciness...with this I get fruitiness like apples....On the finsih I want a crisp spicy hop bite...On this I get pretty much nothing except lingering sweetness....On the plus side, this isn't a bad tasting beer. It's easy drinking with some good maltiness on the taste but overall I find it lacking in many areas....I suppose I could have a bad bottle but it doesn't taste spoiled or old...Nothing special here in my opinion..."
"Appears an amber gold in color with an off white cram colored head. Leaves rings of lace as the glass empties. Aroma consists of caramel like malts with mild floral hallertau hops kicking in the background with a sweet buttery nose. Very sweet taste at the forefront with a mildly syrup like flavor that is balanced by the delicate hop bitterness this beer will live on as a true classic from the Pittsburgh area. Mouthfeel is medium to light in body, but the sweet malt rolls over the palate sticking to the tongue as each sip is swallowed down. As for drinkability the flagship beer of the Penn brewery is one of the most refreshing/satisfying session beers around."
"Overall a good beer. One pilsner I wouldn't mind drinking a few of."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style of beer, but this does a good job of keeping my interest. A hot and humid Richmond summer day, with a nice grass-cutting session thrown in for good measure, would make this beer taste even better. A good candidate for a transition beer for the macro-minded beer-drinker."
"Pours a clear amber color with a white head that leaves some lace. Medium bodied. Nose is a slightly sweet and malty. Starts sweet but finishes with a some hoppy bitterness. Actually a simple pilsner that isn't overloaded with hops. The ABV is 5.2%."
"Appearance: Pours a bright and very clear golden color. The head is white in color, creamy and super dense with great retention. Slow but steady carbonation. On the nose the notes of grain, touch of lime, and a pepper/spicy hop aroma. On the palate the flavor is the same story, peppery,biscuity, grainy, bitterness, lime or pine notecrisp. Good brew"
"I thought this was a very unusual Pilsner. My experience with Pilsner (and I am not a big fan of the style) is they are usually harder, crisper, lighter and hoppier. This one I liked a ton. More roundness and depth of flavor then what I am accustomed a pils to be. Great job here. This could become a staple of mine."
"I am not usually a fan of pilsners, not able to accept that pilsners could be rescued from the macro-world I suppose, but this brew impressed me some. Deep amber, slightly hazy color with a foamy white head. Slightly malty aroma with hints of spicy floral hops. The flavor is initially malty with a great spicy hop presence. Very flavorful and smooth lager with a clean sharp bitterness touching the finish."
"Pours a dark amber with a bright white, dense head. The head slowly fades to a ring of foam around the edge of the glass that leaves a light lace as you drink. A slight chill haze is evident. The aroma has a noticeable malt component backed by the crisp yet spicy hallertau hops. The taste shows a bit of malt sweetness up front, with excellent hop levels in the mid, which results in good bitterness on the finish. The aftertaste is comprised of the lingering hops, but a bit of the malt sweetness reappears after a few seconds. The mouthfeel is solid for a pilsner, with just enough carbonation to lend a crispness to the palate. The drinkability is also very good, as this balanced beer is very enjoyable and goes down smooth. A very good beer that is the Penn Brewing staple, and one of the first true local beers I experienced."
"This pilsner poured a surprisingly dark bronze color, much darker than your normal pils. Thin head, but good retention. A malt sweetness greets the nose, with a bit of spicy hop notes. The taste also reflects the considerable malt presence, very sweet with only a bit of hops toward the end. I was again surprised by this beer and its interpretation of a pilsner style...only small bitter notes and not too much sharpness or crispness. The mouthfeel was good; lighter body, with good prickliness on the tongue. While this was definitely a new pilsner experience for me, I was impressed by its honest, easy-drinking, and quality taste. Like most Penn Brewing products, this makes for a great beer to be had day-in and day-out, while retaining the German roots of the recipes. Great job from the folks in Pittsburgh."
" Worth the time to drink a few with friends..."
"Clear copper color, surprisingly dark for a pilsener. Light brown bubbly head. The head fell nicely down the glass. Noticable malty sweetness on the smell. Taste was bubbly, and much sweeter than I expected as well. In fact, I would have never guessed it to be a pils at all. Subtle hop flavors finally show up toward the finish...Lacks the sour sharp bitterness of other pilseners as well as the bubbly back of the tongue finish....Very easy to drink however, I think this would make a suitable transition beer for the macro drinkers."
"Quite dark for a Pils.  Maybe they should have kept the crystal malt out for the sake of style conformity.  Also, not enough hop for the style, IMHO.  Tastes great though!  I could quaff ten of these easy and still enjoy the flavor.  Bears a striking resemblance to their Marzen."
"Clear golden in color. Fresh smell of quality ingredients.  Rather boring taste, not enough in the way of subletees or nuances to warrent a higher praise.  A little spritzy. A pedrestian brew, but an above average lawnmower beer."
"I am sorry! This beer may be traditionally decoction brewed with all Barley-malt, but it does not have any real malt character. It is kind of a boring Pilsner. There is nothing in the way of hops in the aroma or flavor. It tastes almost ""Anheuser Busch"" clean. It seems like a transition beer made for the Bud crowd... The Schnitzel I had there was delicious though! I appreciate their efforts to help people along with development of their beer palates."
"Notes: Hmmm ... tastes like it was freshly shipped over from Germany. Not bad at all, a good find for any pilsner geek or even a macro brewery Beck's (or similar) drinker."
"This beer tases like an ale. Maybe the slightly darker color is throwing me off.  It is smooth to the mouth and does invite you to try more.  Overall it is above average and would be great with spicy foods.."
"Back in my Pittsburgh days, I was a big fan of the brewery as it was one of the first to open a public beer garden on site...Penn Pilsner is my favorite of their bottled products, but not as hoppy as the Kaiser Pils on tap at the pub...nice color (bolder than a Pilsner Urquel) mouthfeel is good and a nice aftertaste...(the slightly maltier Dark has all the charm of a Michelob Dark)...but, now, I'm an avowed ale guy and rarely stray into cold fermenters except for malty Oktoberfests and Bocks..."
"I remember this as a standout from a nearby brewfest a couple years back."
"An authentic version of this much copied style. A nice balance between the grainy malt flavors and the subtle spicy hops give a smooth satisfying taste."
"Though not my favorite style, this is a wonderful Pilsner.  Crisp and refreshing, how could I not like this beer in the heart of Pittsburgh, with a great view of the Heinz Plant."
