"I used to enjoy this beer, but I opened one today and poured it down the sink. The aroma is completely wrong for an amber ale, and reminds me of a coors lite. If I had any, I would do a comparison. The taste of this beer is also terrible and is reminiscent of a budmillercoors lager and is not anything like an amber ale. There is a faint hint of toasty malt but the aftertaste is more like that of a cheap lager. This beer is also very sweet."
""
""
"Overall : it's whatever. It's not a standout beer but it's not terrible either. A pretty average Amber lager, no bells or whistles, nothing memorable in a good OR bad way. Definitely a blue collar beer at an inflated price."
"High hopes came with a very nice pour of clear honey color, a 2 finger head and plenty of carbonation. head slowly subsided and disappeared in about 2 minutes but left some lace about halfway down. The initial aroma was faint but pleasant, sweet malt but went away quickly never to return again. I liked the carbonation and crisp mouthfeel but taste was blah, to be kind, with some kind bitter, not in a nice hoppy way, after taste. I'll pass on any more of these."

"Not a bad beer... Have had better..."
""

"This is a solid, good tasting amber lager for a good price. This beer has a nice balance of hops and malt flavors."

""
""
"Very surprised!  Very Nice.  Not too Hoppy.  The rating asks for smell?  This doesn't smell like it supposed to.  Beer is flavorful and a great texture."
"Only one word necessary: Meh."
"Great taste with a nice price."

"Pours with a small, white head. The beer is golden in color. Initial aroma is stench and of a pale lager. Tastes likes a generic amber lager with a hint of hops. Goes down slightly harsh. Overall, not a good quality beer. But I have had worse."
""
""
"Yuengling, but not quite as good. Suck it, Coors!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I don't think much when I drink this beer. That it is light, sweet, juicy and cold is all that matters. That it's a Coors product isn't even on the screen."

"I had this on tap. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this was a very decent beer. For a lager from a big company like MillerCoors, you’d expect hardly any flavor. This one does have flavor and it was good. I would drink it again."

"Overall I did not care for the bottled version but this review comes from a 16 ounce can brewed in Ft. Worth (Miller) and it is much better than the bottled version. I hate to say this as a long time union member but the boys in Ft. Worth are brewing some excellent beers. Check out the Fosters Oil cans from the same brewery. Best Fosters ever. The can date Jun 16 2014. Has to be the brewed on date cause this beer was really tasty."
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. smell is very mild, some light malts. Taste is also mild, malty, a bit of grains, refreshing but bland. Feels light in the mouth and overall not terrible, but nothing special about this beer."

"Awesome. This is a really good lager for after a long day at work. The 6 pack is really cheap at $5 and some change. I really like this beer. I will keep this beer in my fridge.I really don't know what else to write because it keeps saying invalid comment length"

"Bought a 6-pack of this at the grocery store liquor store because I noticed it was on sale. Drank from the bottle poured into my beer glass. Tried it both cold, and again when it warmed to room temperature. I really liked the appearance of this one- a rich, golden red. 1/2"" head that dissipated very rapidly. Very very light lacing on the glass. The carbonation was decent, but almost too much for my taste. Very light smell- hard to pick it up, but I'd describe it as wheaty with a light caramel apple in the background. Taste was excellent. Very flavorful, but not too strong or overpowering. Malt, grass, citrus, and apple with a very light bitter citrus aftertaste. I actually liked the beer better after it warmed up to room temperature. The taste became much more sweet and defined. I had mixed feelings about this beer before trying it. I had heard good things about it, but wasn't sure how it would be, especially since it's made by Coors. I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed this beer and would definitely drink it again."

"I didn't realise this was made by coors when I bought it on holiday in America. It's a shame as I could've brought something else back. Unfortunately it just tastes the same as coors light with a slightly more bitter backbone. Maybe I'm bias as it took up a space in my suitcase something else could've, but it's an experience and at least I know for next time."
"Solid beer! The appearance was the first thing that stood out to me, I drank it from an imperial pint glass that really made the carbonation look cool coming up the side and gliding off the ridge. There's some really cool amber notes in there and it's very drinkable. The mouthfeel is really really nice, carbonated but still smooth. Definitely found a new fridge staple."
""

"overall, a run of the mill amber lager. there is little to suggest that this resembles a vienna lager in any way. a beer for the masses. luckily i scored two cases of this, still fresh, for under $20. not really recommended, but i suppose it has it place."
"I'm drinking this as we speak from a bottle. The mouthfeel is pretty good. The taste is average. Not a drain pour, but not the best either. It really doesn't have a smell. Overall, it's an okay beer, but I don't see myself buying a six pack anytime in the near future."
""
""
"Overall: A very fine and drinkable beer."
""
"It is a darker, amber color. The scent isn't very strong, but is earthy with a malty scent. It tastes malty and oaky. Slight hops and slight sweetness as well. Has a simple finish with a hint aftertaste of the earthiness. Overall an average amber lager."
""
""
""
"Dessert: cannot say anything commendable, but not as horrifically ""poisonous"" as overall review average denotes; believe people skewed by fact its Coors under a different label."
"Third Shift Amber Lager brewed by Coors Brewing Company. This brew pours out a dark amber color with a small white head. I like the color of this brew- not too light, but not too dark. Third shift has a an abv of 5.3. The smell is rich and sweet. There is nothing bad about the smell of this brew. The taste is rich with a hit of sweetness but a bitterness at the end. For being a dark amber brew it is well balanced. No hard after taste at the end. This brew is not overpowering but not underpowering. Third Shift Amber goes down smooth with a little bit of bitterness at the end. Over all I'm giving this brew a 3.75 out of 5. It is not something I would drink everyday but I would get this brew again."
""
""
" A triumphant 4 is earned ,in my opinion. I loved the roasted malt taste without unwanted sweetness. I will certainly buy this brew again. It's a great all-occasion, any day of the week type of brew. I'm willing to bet it makes KILLER brats too!!"

"[I am copying these notes over from RateBeer ... it does not require as long of review. I tasted this some time ago so I can't add anything.]"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Dry and crispy at first which mellows well into sweet maltiness. Some crushed aspirin at the end."
"overall i would consider this an american red/amber lager, not a Vienna lager. it looks o.k. it has no smell. it tastes adjunctant. mouth feel is best. but most of all where are the noble hops? i don't know what Coors master brewers were thinking, at least blue moon was pretty good."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Meh, middle of the road amber...more dull maltyness, more off putting metal and plastic notes..just not really doing it for me. C'mon coors, if you are going to try to get part of the craft beer pie...make a true, tasty craft kinda tasting beer..."
""
""
"I can drink this - it's not a ""good"" beer, but it's cheap and the price is right. It's better than other cheap swill in this range like Old Milwaukee, Natty, and Keystone."
""
""
""
"Again, wet dog."
""
""
""
""
""

"O-I would not buy this beer again and was let down a bit but judge the beer by its cover."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's funny how the first couple of quick gulps are pleasant but the funny flavors emerge to the detriment of drinkability. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at a Von's supermarket. I'm sure I thought this was New Belgium Shift when I bought it."
""
""
""
""

"This stuff has the color of a damn good craft beer, color of your piss if you dont drink water after a week or so. The taste and mouthfeel is oh man i dunno what the hell it is?!?! Only thing it has going is its looks, its darker than your regular american adjunct lagers so i thought what the hell until i tasted it, oh man it lives up to its name of a bunch of drunks on 3rd shift making beer! believe that folks!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad and would drink it again if handed to me."
"Poured slightly warm with a nice, cream-colored, foamy, thick head that soon settled to a ring and some scummy islands and a bit of lace. Color is a clear amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is fresh beer with a little malt. Flavor is dominated by corn sweet, has some malt, and carbonic tang with a hint of hop bitter. It's also shallow. Body is a little thin and carbonation a tad sharp. Finish is like flavor, trends medicinal, and is forgettable. This is just drinkable and will be my first/last."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was really suprised on the smell! I was not expecting it to smell so nice and sweet. I took a sip and swore I had tasted this before. I had Dogbite high gravity lager and it tastes similar. However, this is much smoother. As for the appearance it has an amazing color!"
"The look i am not sure of drinking straight from the bottle. I never drink lager beer so this is new. Smell kind of sweet like honey very pleasant. Taste the first one was kind of strong for me with a strong aftertaste. I really enjoyed the second easy to drink kinda sweet and for $6.28 for a sixpack that is a great value we can't all drink the best. But i recommend this."

"12oz. bottle: Bought this at noon on a Sunday in Bay City, TX at a gas station: best thing in the store. It pours a clear amber color. There was a small off-white head on it that didn’t linger long or leave much lacing. The aroma isn’t too bad. Malts, a little grainy and earthy. It isn’t great, but really doesn’t taste too bad. A bit of caramel malt sweetness, a little grainy and just a touch of grassy hops. It’ll do in a pinch."
""
""
"O - The smooth lager feel is very pleasant, but nothing else really stands out."
""
""
""
"O: An good example of my favorite lager styles with good hops and malt character."
""
"O: This beer tastes less maltier and a little watered down when compared to other beers in the style, but is easy to drink and doesn't have any ""off"" flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt, grain, and slight grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, biscuit, and metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a below average beer that tastes pretty decent but the metallic aspect detracts from things."
"Overall - I'll drink this one, but I'd likely skip over it next time. It isn't a bad beer, but theres nothing that really makes me want more and more. If you like malty beers than you might pick this one up."
""
""
""
"Even better its often on sale. Its officially my ""sale Lager"". Its a great lager with food."
"It's very drinkable, kind of like a watery boston lager except significantly less bitter. It's a little thick on the tongue, but hey a very drinkable and fairly decent beer from coors. I wouldn't trade my Sam Adams for it but I could definitely drink it again."
""
""
"Bready , sweet aroma. Pours an orange amber body with full but short lasting beige head. Head quickly turns to thin oily film, no lacing. Taste follows nose, sweet and Bready. Acidic aftertaste. If I could use a one word description : Meh!"
"Watered down Sam Adams Lager, at best."
""
"O: Nothing special... but I would drink it again if nothing else was available"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent brew but nothing special. It was good good with my burger I had, easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad attempt at a vienna, but it is more an amber. It's doesn't have enough hops as vienna should be. Very drinkable and not bad. I will be getting a full case of this to experiment further."
""
""
""
"Overall: thirst-quenching and flavorful. Even if it is Coors, it's not a bad product."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Better than I expected after all the advertising. A decent brew that friends can share around the barbecue pit, pretending they have a rare craft beer and feeling better about themselves."
""
"I've given Third Shift a 3.0 rating as a good example of the ultra-malty beer style [actually, it's closer to an ale]. But, it's not to my taste. I really don't like heavy, malty beers or ales. But, if you do, then this one should please you. Just pretend it's brewed by the Insane Poison Stoner Brewery, and you'll get past any biases you may be harboring."
"Tasty, well balanced beer with good hops and malt flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty good, very drinkable. Overall, very good for a ""mass-market craft beer", a clear step above a macro brew. Good value and worth drinking if you are a fan of malty beers."
""
"O: thirst-quenching lawnmower beer,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Light crisp refreshing, goes down easy. Not imposing. very tasty - would buy again."
""
"Overall, I could session this all day because of it's lightness. It's a macro amber, that's that."
""
"A dark amber beer usually a good sign of rich taste in amber beers, Unfortunately not so in this case only a strong bitter after taste. A thick foam head produced when poured into frosted mug The label claims it is a gold medal award winner it definitely does live up to that promise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Third Street is an easy going beer. The beer pours a lighter clear amber with thin if any head that is not lacing. The smell is mostly malt/bread. The taste is a nice balance of bittering hops and malt. The mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a nice sessionable beer...but nothing noteworthy."
""
""
""
""
"Drank straight from the can, so no real comment on appearance. Scent was mostly fruity lager esters and some sweet malt. Not horrible. Pretty appetizing actually. Taste was fruity with grain husk, malt sweetness and possible maize adjunct with some moderate hop bitterness. Not that bad, fairly standard and mild, but inoffensive and pleasant. Mouthfeel was light bodied with high carbonation. Pretty standard macro mouthfeel, not horrible, drinkable. Overall this was a standard beer. It wasn't bad, it was rather good, but it did nothing to really stand out. Still, that's not too bad for a Coors product."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a somewhat reddish gold, more gold than red, good head but not really any lace. I get a grainy maltiness for an aroma with a touch of sweet malt. Beer is easy to drink, not too rough, more grainy pils-like malt and some bitter hops than any sweetness or anything. Not an amber lager in my opinion despite the name. Nothing really much going on although for a macro it's not too bad (that's a backhanded complement)."
""
""
"O- I should've gone with Corona."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a bit too muted for my taste. For a cheap beer, it's good, but it doesn't stand out amidst craft beer."
""
"A good beer after a long hard day of work. Drank right from the sixteen ounce can. Nice, smooth and light, nothing to right home about, but I would definatley consider adding this to the list of go to cheap beer I keep in the fridge because hey, I can't afford the outstanding stuff all the time."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied. It washes down quick and easy as any beverage by this company."
"I thought this was pretty good for Coors. Fuller taste but pretty sweet, bit of chocolate or caramel, with a sweet apricot or date sort of tone. Bit of alcohol and tends to get thin. Inexpensive relatively but a good find in typical convenience stores."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Saw so many commercials for this that I had to try it. Nothing much to report here. Good session beer. Standard amber lager. Very sweet and malty. But also seems very light for an amber. Out of the six pack I had there were inconsistencies among the bottles. Some were very good. Some had a rather strong presence of dimethyl for an amber."

"This is now one of my go to beers. It is hard to find. I hope it sticks around. Nice head and lacing. Great color. The Taste is unique with a bitter finish. Some of my Summer Shandy drinking friends don't care for it. Your friends will either like it or hate it! It is affordable ($6.49 a six) but the taste is what makes it enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is decent. Lots of effervescence, slight head, slight lacing. Nose is roasty with wood, spice, and sweet notes. Peaty and roasty malt flavor, accentuated with a little savory spice, bitterness, and a very slight sweet balance. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""

"O: I was hoping for a beefed-up Coors, but what I got was its ugly cousin. Everything was in order for the easy-sipping summer night beer that I wanted except for arguably the most important factor, the taste. Reminiscent of what third-shifters might use to lubricate or clean their machines. Granted, the harshness alleviated somewhat upon the third and forth tastings, but I'm left with an aversion to drinking it. You might get more judgmental stares for buying the more-noticeable flagship MBC beers, but once you get over them you won't have missed anything for skipping this one."
""
"bought this on a whim,,,( it being cheep),lol. not what i expected given the hype about it. it has a nice color, not much head or laceing. like others here have siad the corn taste overpowers the hops. not one i would buy again but worth trying it all the same. i may have under rated it,, however to my palet it is swill."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I initially rated this beer as okay but after going back and REALLY paying attention to this beer it's not all that great. Or even good. It's barely drinkable and smells like they brewed it with vomit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean pale orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, a caramel malt and a small hop presence. In the taste, a small hop bite, and a small caramel roast. A small hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry roast and small hop in the aftertaste. A step above swill, ugh..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a buzz beer. 5.3% alcohol gives it more of an IPA taste, except it lacks the jacked up hop taste of said beers. Its more tart ( i have discovered that comes from the malt factor) than bitter. Looks are amber well enough but does not have the full body taste of a true lager. Really more sweet and sour like a wheat.Just sort of green. I am not a fan of wheat at all. But with all the let down it is drinkable. But do not take my word for try it yourself. Bottoms up!"
""
"O. This is just a horrible taste. So much of a macro taste with an attempt to give it a malty ale taste. Just pure crap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note: I had a plain old lager from a legitimate craft brewer the other day and I must say the quality there was higher. It's obvious this is a product of a macro. That's a shame."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer reminded me of a 40 ouncer of malt liqour. Not tasty. Not enjoyable. I thought it was a craft beer--misleading gold medal award winner on the label--but it is definitely not. It tastes kind of metallic, and has a bad after taste. Drink at your own risk."
""
""
"Overall, this was a decent job by Coors! Yet, this is not going to be a frequent flyer in my refrigerator. Quite frankly, I'd have this over a PBR, Bud, or Miller Lite."
""
"I was quite surprised by this one. Even though the smell gave the expectation of a singular type beer; hit had quite the variety flavor. The hops was an appropriate amount while the a hue of sweetness prevailed at the tail end of each drink. I drank half and used the other half to cook into some burgers. As irrelevant as it may be, the beer added a poppy bitterness to the meat once cooked. Overall, I am impressed that a macrobrew made a good a beer as they did. Congrats to Coors for this one."

"a freebie from a neighbor. deep yellow with a white foamy head that dies to just a bit around the rim, basically no lacing. not as thin as i'd expected, but then i wasn't expecting much. smell is sweet, tad metallic. a bit of malt, bit of barley, and a weird corn syrup sweetness. not much going on, but nothing really offensive either."
"I did not prefer this lager. It leaves my mouth with a dry taste that I only get when I drink commercial beers. I bought it on a rack of ""build your own"" and later realized after I had tasted it, with some research, that it was a Coors brew...which did not surprise me after I had made my decision about not enjoying it. All in all....it was an ""eh"" kinda beer."
""
"The price of this beer is not on par with the price. I assumed this was a was a scam by big brewers to tap the craft beer market when I saw the commercial and was right when I saw coors makes it! Sweet and bitter, rather have the silver bullet ... tap the rockies might leave you tapped out"

"12 oz bottle, pours amber with amazing clarity, tall bubbly white head fades slowly, no lacing is left on the glass.  Minimal aroma, faint toasty grain, faint yeast, grass, earth.  Tastes are toasted grain, earthy, grassy hops, caramel.  Light-medium body, moderate carbonation, finishes semi bitter with a sourish earthiness.  Overall, wasn't sure what to expect with this one, but it doesn't deliver."
"This is really a terrible beer. Maybe in the style of a marzen it would get a little bit of better rating from me. But it comes off as a Miller High Life with red food coloring, a few days over the best-by date. It's really a shame that the price point for this is inline with other premium craft-style BMC selections. Nobody should have to pay that much for this."
""
""
"This beer is easy drinking and refreshing, yet provides good complexity for the style."

"O: macro pretending to be craft"
""
""
"Also, I have to laugh at their marketing. How stupid do they think we are?...well"
""
""
"Overall: Average to below average for the style. Like a watered down version of a decent Vienna lager. Not so bad that I would pass this up at a party, but I would be searching the coolers for anything else available."
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of sweet malt, pale malt, sugar, slight hops, and adjunct. Fits the style of a Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of adjunct, sweet malt, slight pale malt, and a hint of hops. Overall, except for the adjunct, this is a decent brew, alas the adjunct undermines the body and aroma."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent sessionable beer but there are other beers in the style that I would choose first."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste reminds me of Budweiser Black Crown, which is an amber lager, I believe. Somewhat malty with a little red ale tinge, it's very smooth and easy with no harsh adjunct flavor."

"Amber body it's third shift band of brewing amber lager, gold medal where? Clear amber body fizzy carbonation is all over the place the head is creamy textured and colored with large bubbles. Aroma has cooked cereal grains, corn and caramel coloring as the base malts somewhat earthy pungency in the nose...how is this stuff even on the same level as the Batch 19....it's a modern day lager that they want you to believe has been brewed by a band of brewers who are like brothers taking on the masses when in fact this is the masses brewing an amber lager to compete with Black Crown and Yuengling Traditional Amber Lager. Faint biscuit malt and caramel flavor with a hint of spicy peppery hops, not really bad in the flavors just in the sense of texture that it tastes like a mass produced product with a harshness that's hard to describe with loving and discriminatory words. It's just not that good and sales will project the same opinion especially for the price point this beer has I'm glad I found an individual can to review, not bad really after one it's not bad could a pour another in my glass, hell no. Overall impression is that the big brewers need to stop going pseudo-craft and go all the way and claim it as there's Miller can brew a great mass produced light lager why not a great IPA???"

"Third Shift, to me, tastes a lot like Batch 19 (also from Coors). The difference there is, this is classified as a Vienna Lager, while that's considered an American Adjunct Lager. For that reason, and the fact that this beer was only a buck less than a Boomba of Two Hearted (albeit at a different bar), it's hard to recommend it. It's not an awful beer, but it's stark raving average, and quite a lot like Batch 19 for more money. Eh."

"Appearance has a golden amber color supporting a fair dissipating head leaving nill lace. Smell of adjunct grains and mild hop. Taste is grainy, slightly sweet with big adjunct flavor. mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Probably the one and only time I'll give this one a try."

"O - Its pretty much what I anticiapted. Very nice tasting beer and very easy to drink. There is just nothing that sticks out though. Not really a very memorable beer."
""
""
"Aroma is clean and grainy with a light hint of vienna malt character and a faint touch of hops. Warming does expand the hop experience with some agitation, yet seems oddly out of place overall. Taste is dry with a hint of caramel up front and offers a coarse and grainy finish. Lacking as for depth as a Vienna Lager but an easy quaff for a medium bodied lager. Light and smooth feel, simple and without any defects. Average."
""
""
""
"O - not bad but bottom line its an average beer"
""
""
""
"for a coors product, this is excellent"
"O: Overall I was expecting much worse since it's by Coors but it's alright. Nothing special, just a run of the mill wheat beer, but not too bad, I could drink lots of these with no discomfort. Unoriginal but relatively enjoyable, I'd recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not half bad ... just a plain amber lager. Lots of faux marketing thrown at this. Not sure of their intention but seems the idea was a hesitant pull of a trigger. Not really worth the time IMO."
""
""
""
"Overall: Great accessible, reasonably priced lager. I encourage people to taste this blind. It doesnt knock your socks off, but it's a perfectly fine above-average amber/ale/pre-prohibition-style-lager."
""
"The beer pours a deep golden, amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry lager yeast scent along with a touch of caramel malts for color and malt character. The taste is decent. It has a smooth and easy drinking pilsner and caramel malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry. It's nothing spectacular, but it's quite quaffable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinker and a good go to cheap beer."
""
""
"All in all, i actually enjoyed this brew. I found it similar to Coors' Batch 19 (which I liked a little better...). I found this to be in the pre-prohibition American lager style, which i like. For a beer from one of the big brewers, this was pretty good."
""
""
"Batch 19 was much better compared to this. I think Coors would be better off sticking to their light beer spritzers and leave the real beer to others."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"This pours a dark amber color with an average off-white head. It has a very mild aroma of mostly grains. Surprisingly decent tasting for a beer that going in I knew was brewed by Miller/Coors. This is a pretty average to high average macro-brew attempting to appeal as craft. Some caramel sweetness is mixed nicely with the grains. Tons more flavor than Miller Lite or Coors light!"
""
"Poured a flawless amber color into a pint glass with a quarter inch head. Nothing offensive about the smell. Nice, crisp and refreshing for an amber. A well-balanced beer with a touch of bitterness, roasted flavor and effervescence. Could become a go-to for an amber fix from here on out."
""
""
"A solid, refreshing, flavorful lager. I very much enjoyed this beer and I'm glad I grabbed it. I was going to say, it reminds me of something out of the current ""Pre-Prohibition"" lager trend that seems to be picking up. Now that I hit the site, I see it's a Coors product and a sister to Batch 19. Hey, if Coors starts putting out rich, flavorful lagers at this price point, more power to them. Drinking $12 bombers and $15 4-packs gets expensive damn quick, and if I'm going to be occasionally forced by my budget into the lower tier, I applaud the lower tier rising up to meet and even exceed my expectations. My overall rating takes this value into account."
""
""
""

"Overall not a bad beer for summertime barbeques but I wouldn't pick this up to satisfy any cravings."
"2 oz bottle from a six pack from ""Habits"" in Salem. $5.99 a sixer. Light copper coloured lager, large ,thick and rocky off white head. Not much to the aroma, grainy,cardboard ,slight grassy hop. Taste is thin caramel, with a certain astringency in the end that is perhaps hop? Watery palate Not impressed very pedestrian"

"Reviewing this as well as Batch 19, another Coors craft beer experiment, together. Poured a light amber with better head retention than Batch 19, lighter color and less viscous looking. The smell is much more subdued; slight caramel and toasted bread, no scent of hops at all. Very easy drinking and smooth taste that follows the nose; subdued caramel, lightly toasted grains, slightly nutty. A barely-there hop presence hides in the backbone. The mouthfeel is medium-thin and the carbonation is appropriate. This beer is very easy to drink and sessionable, but I also see this as the main flaw as this beer just has no ""wow factor"" to it. I preferred the thicker, rougher, more characterful taste of Batch 19. Easy to drink, tasty, and finely made, this is still not the best example of an American amber lager. Samuel Adams still dominates in that category but Third Shift is worth picking up if the price is right. (Paid 9.99 on sale at Rite-Aid.)"
""
"The Verdict: Meh. Even though this says it is made by “Band of Brewers” it is actually another Coors brand and it shows. Tastes very similar to a Coors or Blue Moon. Inoffensive perhaps, but the same blandness you can get from many other beers."
""
""
""
"Pours out to a nice 1/2 inch head. Color is medium-light on the amber spectrum. Aroma is a faint caramel malt and grains with some grassy hops faint in the background. Flavor is rather bland and nondescript, starts out grainy/biscuity with a crisp noble hop finish. Mouthfeel is light, CO2 is on target. On the balance, the beer is very much in the mold of Killians and other mass-produced reds and ambers brewed with the lager yeast and processes the big boys use. I've had this beer again since the original review was logged on April 2013. It has disappointed me even more this time. It seemed blander and more metallic. Never again. Even at the deep discount prices, it is not worth it. There are many better Vienna style lagers out there."

"O: Well, it's better than regular Coors/Coors Light..."

"The beer pours a burnt orange color with a foamy white head. Sounds weird, but I could smell green beans, along with sweet malt and adjunct. It tastes like veggies as well, with some lemony hop flavor and malty sweetness, that's about it. The beer is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. This is better than your average macro but rreally doesn't have much to it."
""
"Decent amber lager, yes. Gold Medal Winner, from what competition? Band of Brewers shouldn't set themselves up fo...oh, it's Coors? <facepalm>"
""
"The taste starts echoes the aroma with a subtle sweet bready character up front and a slightly lingering clean hop finish. Well balanced and fairly drinkable."
""
"Coors did a decent job at creating a ""crafty"" amber lager. My only regret was drinking this too slowly. In order to maintain the crisp hoppiness and keep the malt sweetness in check, this should be both served and consumed very cold."
""
""
"o overall this is a decent albeit somewhat unimpressive."
"Third Shift Amber Lager is the macro answer to the recent bashing taken by the craft crowd. I am just a fan of beer in general, and I have no agenda. I am not trying to gentrify beer, nor am I trying to suggest that only large, industrialized beer is the way to go. I will say that Coors got it right with this one, and some of the more off the wall breweries should take note--this beer holds up as well as many for such a simple style, and I also find that it is much better than many lower budget efforts at the exact same thing."
"O: very easy to drink. better than most macro beers and the same price."
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and a better offering than I expected from a micro label from a BMC brewery. It has pretty good toasted malts notes but I wish they had left out the adjuncts..."
""
""
""
""
""
"As if we did not know, weathered copper glow with a thin fuzzy head. Aroma was that of heavy grains aka adjunct products with a slight hint of mildly roasted malt and almost sweet whiff. Some bready malt up front with a twinge of preserving hops going down to add just a touch of balancing bitterness as it fades quickly. Lacks any complexity as we should coming from a big box brewery though props for attempting to set foot on to the craft beer scene. Highly drinkable beer for the average joe but, not for the Beer Sith."

"Bought this after reading a good review at the beer store. Nice amber color. good pour into tall pint glass. Foamed and reduced to thin layer. Carbonation gives it a little bite. not overly hoppy, slight bitter taste. date on the bottom is jul0113. Nice looking can, No where does it say Coors on it. I might have put it back if I known it was a coors product. But after tasting it, I would not say no if I were offered a can. Not a bad beer, I will enjoy finishing the 4 pack and continue on in finding the perfect beer!"

"I have been looking in vain to find any verification that it is a ""gold medal award winner."" Not listed among the world beer cup winners of 2012. Also could not find it among the winners at the Great American Beer Festival. Another article I read said it was marketed under code name Flor Hosen and won in German style Marzen category. I looked it up and that name was listed as a winner. Awfully close to false advertising..."

"O: A good beer from Coors."

"This stuff is not outstanding, but it costs about the same as a domestic macro and tastes about 50 times better."
"Great option for the price $6.99 for a 6 pk."
""
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden yellow color, nice carbonation, little fizzy white head that disappears quickly, not much sticky lacing left behind. The nose is slightly malty, with some grainyness, nice little sweet note. The taste is mostly grainy, but with a hint of maltyness, slightly sweet, Medium body. Overall this would be a thirst quencher, but I will not buy it again."
"Now, if you want a beer - go get you a Doghead Fish or a Pliny the Elder."
""
"O - This is okay. Didn't realize when I purchased it that it was a Coors product."
"My pour began with two fingers of fluffy, bone-white head that fell as I was typing the above screed. At least there was nice lacing in its wake. Color was a bright amber that had me looking for prehistoric bugs that might have been preserved in it. I kid you not, if I had one of those beer color charts, this would be spot on for ""Amber"". I am going to guess and place it at 15 degrees Lovibond. Nose had a honey-wheat bread quality which seemed okay to me. I have grown so tired of adjunct-filled lagers that any lager that smells like something other than cobbled together liquid will get my vote. Mouthfeel was big and full, not overly carbonated, but dense. The flavor was quite sweet, caramel and bread bein the prevalent tastes. Finish was semi-sweet, not overly sweet and refreshing. I wish that they would CAN this one as it would be nice on a hot day."
""
""
"Overall, it is a nice easy drinking beer. Better than your average BMC product and not over priced."
"For whatever reason, I'm always up for trying these ""crafty"" releases that the macrobreweries release. Call it morbid curiosity. Third Shift isn't bad looking at all, it's a nice orange-amber color with a large head that retains well for a Coors product. The aroma lets me down right away though. There's the distinctive ""wet dog"" aroma that I associate with every American Adjunct Lager. There's a touch more malts in the background, but beyond that it's remarkably similar to a Coors Heavy. The taste starts off stronger with a nice caramel malt, but quickly collapses into the same AAL finish I'd expect from a Coors product. The mouthfeel is nice though, it's got a heavier body than a normal Coors and a spot-on carbonation level, and the drinkability is solid enough. Overall, it's basically Yuengling but worse. It's a step up from the average Coors product for sure, and something I'd get if there were no better options. Gotta say though, I love seeing Union Made on the label!"
"O: A drinkable beer, but nothing special. I wouldn't seek it out, but I would drink it again."
""
""
""
"***An undeniably nice looking beer in a nonic glass, but its sort of a slightly above average amber lager overall. Sesionable and refreshing, so, yea."
""
""
""
"I'm sorry I don't have a more well-formed argument, but the idea of drinking Coors products disgusts me- even more when they use well-researched marketing and advertisement to get people like me do drink it. Ugh - its a good Lager but I wouldn't put my money towards it."
"I wonder how many of the reviews of this beer are negative because it's a coors product. Whilst not being a big fan of the big breweries, this beer is pretty good, and should be given its due. However, had I researched it a bit more I may have passed on it once I discovered it was from coors. That in itself should say something to any coors representatives reading this review. However, once again, a good beer is a good beer, regardless of who produced it. This is a good beer, and my review reflects that. Is it the best vienna lager ever? Probably not. But it's damn enjoyable."
""
""
"This is my first review,so it may lack the in-depth information that regular contributors can offer.My overall impression of this beer was fairly positive,considering that it is a mass produced attempt at a craft beer.But to give the devil his due,I really enjoyed it,and have bought it 3 times now since the initial purchase. I generally like a hoppy malty type of beer,but I am not too snobby about it,and I think that Third-Shift would fare pretty well against similar craft beers,IF it were done in a blinded taste test,as I suspect that some people would dismiss it out of hand if they knew it's pedigree. So my advice is to try it with an open mind,and consider that it's a decent,more interesting beer for the price of a more common,less interesting one."

"This was the best big brewery beer i could have bought at the gas station i live near, Well besides sam adams boston lager and yuengling lager which is hit or miss in the cooler there. Anyways seen this in 16oz cans and bought two. The apperence to me not really amber more like a bud but more orange i guess. the head didnt last to long, and leaves a tiny ring aorund the glass. Smell is pretty good, though i do smell corn but not sure if it is used in the beer. toasted malt no spice no hops maybe nutty. The taste to me is just like the bud crown if you have had that, this is very much the same, toasted malt i do taste the corn but not over done. sweet nutty after taste, enough hops to balance the beer pretty good for what this is. This beer to me is coors/miller way to compete with bud crown which it does, and i also think the whole amber lager kinda crafty thing is a way for both of these companys to compete with yeungling. though i think yeungling beats both by far with a more session abv at 4.4. I will say it is better then any american lager from BMC. though ill take yeungling if i can find it over this."
""

"The smooth taste of corn resonates through this lager, which may have a trace or two of hops in its finish. This is one of those beers that gets over powered by the Doritos at a party, mostly due to its inoffensive character."

"Wake up call for ""Ale Lovers""...if you don't like lagers, why bother reviewing them..?"
"Pretty easy to drink. Not bad, but nothing special. Decent price - pretty average amber lager."

"Poured a brilliant amber-copper hue, producing a 1/4 inch cream-colored head that dissipated quickly. Some malt in the nose - not much hops. Grassy notes? Medium body. Light to moderate carbonation. Sweet malty palate. Short. Fresh. Crisp. Easy to drink. Not a cerebral beer. Lacing does form. It is an OK beer, but not good value considering the quality that exists at this price point."

"At first taste I didn't think it was anything special but I did enjoy the different kick that it offers. It's not a Fat Tire or an Alaskan Amber....but it is it's own flavor. After the second one I tried a couple days later I had no complaints. It's a mild Amber that I guess you could consider universal to any crowd that enjoys trying new things. Doesn't overwhelm the taste buds or leave a pungaent after taste in your mouth. I'll throw my thumbs in the iar for this one. It's gonna catch on."
"Mu buddy used to work third shift...he seemed to dislike it...I don't blame him... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber (shocker!) topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises biscuit, light dried honey, light barley, and a hint of flowers. The taste pretty much brings in more of the same, along with a vague sense of candied orange peel in the background. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a decent little beer, but one that lacks any real character of its own. It ain't bad, but nothing I would exert myself to drink again."

"12oz bottle purchased at Market Basket. Pours a crystal clear amber body with nearly an inch of off white head. Smells malty and nutty. Sweet bread, caramel, nut make the flavor with notes of chocolate and floral hops. Light bodied with medium carbonation. Pretty good actually. One of the better "" amber lagers"" I've come across."
"Overall: Easily drinkable, accessible brew with ample flavor, crispness. Politely tolerable."

"Well, no matter its heritage and whatever its ingredients, it's a drinkable if not exactly exciting beer. No regrets about buying a six-pack, but will probably spend my money on better, more forthright beers. However, in a pinch, this brew would be a nice thirst quencher."
"OVERALL: Decent drinking lager, but more or less a mainstream college party type beer. I wish the big three did more experiments for good like this back in the day, rather than just diluting the $hit out of everything. Slightly better than average for the style."
