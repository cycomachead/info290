"O-not sure about this one. It was not good, but not bad just okay"

"Had this at a Cuban restaurant and it went nicely with some salty sweet plantain chips. Definitely worth pairing with something, as on its own it was a little harsh and dirty. But the salt contrast made this plenty OK."

"Picked this up at a resort. Better than the ghastly Bud Light Lime offering, and fun to drink a local, but pretty uneventful. Much like that movie Trouble with the Curve."

"Drink- Just an average beer, nice to try a local but wouldn't seek this out."

"O- a very meh beer. Easy drinking and forgettable, but I drank it pretty fast, so at least it is smooth."
"Pours a golden amber with a 1 finger head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of some malt and yeast, a hint of grass to it. Tastes grainy and one dimensional, no sweetness or hop flavor. Overly carbonated, harsh, and watered down. Not impressed with this."
"O - Pretty drinkable, if very average lager. Goes well with sushi, but unremarkable otherwise. I like my second pint better than my first, which couldn't stand up to the spicy food I paired it with."
"Overall ok, glad I do no have a 6 pack of it, but nice to have tried."
"I think this beer may have been defunct for a while; maybe not, but I haven't seen it around in a few years. The brew pours a rich brassy golden hue and is capped with an inch of moderate-lived white head that settles to a covering film. Spotty lace is deposited. The nose doesn't do much except avoid offense and comply with style norms; there is not a tremendous amount of character expressed int the aroma. The flavor, however, is explosive by comparison; it is also very tasty. This bottle must be fairly fresh because it has a good deal of sublime and dynamic hoppiness; herbal and grassy notes are initially observed on the palate but they turn to piney and cannabis-like on the finish. The malt is very pale and mineral-y at first (AKA @ ~55°F) despite the relatively rich hue; as it warms and airs out notes of caramel and ripe fruit come through. The feel is light and refreshing, offering soft carbonation and medium-light body. Overall, I am stunned by this brew, as I did not expect it to be anything better than mediocre at best based on my recollection. It is pretty close to everything I would want from a straightforward lager, excepting the vagueness of the aroma, and it is definitely a case of the whole being better than the sum of its parts."
"Delta lounge, Tampa airport."
"D: Easy to drink, but the overall lack of flavor does not lead me to want another one."
"d- easy to put these down, good beer for kicking back and in the fall, gets the amber lager idea across without being too malty for certain people's tastes"
"Drinks okay, but nothing to write home about"
"Not too clean for a lager, the DMS (cooked veggies) comes out a bit too long. Subpar compared to their counterparts whom they are trying to emulate. There are far better import and craft lagers out there to even think about bothering with this one."
"D - Very drinkable. Better than most."
"D - OK, but not a great brew. Lacks staying power."
"Fairly drinkable. It's not fantastic, but it could find a place in my line up."
"Poured a golden-reddish tint, with medium thick white head that lasted thru mid glass, yet left little lacing. Aroma and taste were both very muted, yet what was there was a fruity hop. Smooth drinking and thirst quenching. I found this to not have too many characteristics, good or bad. An average beer all around."
"Pours a clear amber with one finger white head. Smell: grassy hops, musty husky grain. Taste: wheat cracker, grassy, with a crisp mildly sour note, sweet toasted malt. Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, active carbonation mixes well with a spicy bitterness. Works alright..."
"D: Light, but fairly flavorful. Very easy going down."
"I can't really comment on the appearance as I drank it from the bottle. Although I did like the label, how it had this rating scale for hops, darkness and drinkability (I think). It hit middle of the range in all of those. I actually picked this up in Ybor City and after seeing what looked like could be a gang scuffle, I promptly headed pack to my hotel to enjoy the beer and avoid getting shot. Anyway, the beer was good, but I'm not going to go out of my way to get it. I would like to try some of their other beers on another trip to Tampa. I felt it was very drinkable and fits well into that Bavarian style."
"Other comments: An OK lager, but nothing to spend time seeking out."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Would not kick this beer out of bed for eating crackers."
" Body is light and airy, very refreshing and fitting for a warm-weather beer. I have to say, even in December, this is a nice, refreshing, thirst-quenching ale that's perfect for the Florida climate."
"M/D: The beer had a medium body with maybe a little too much carbonation. Overall, the beer is really not that good and I did not finish the second one that I ordered."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, I guess, if this is your thing, but very forgetable"
"This os the Florida Beer Company's flagship brew. I used visit Ybor city for concerts and ""guava-ween", their version of MArdi Gras. I had this one nicely chilled in a pub glass. Poured exactly what it says on the bottle: a gold amber color. Smell was malty and a little citrus hops. Tastes was farily well balanced with mild malt and hop character. Fizzy on the tongue but has a crisp, clean finish."
"D- It was a good drinker. Light enough to enjoy in the muggy weather, but solid enough that you're not going to mistake it for a macro-lager."
"Gold color with small dissipating head. Smells faintly of hops and malt. The taste was quite excellent, reminding me highly of Sam Adams. Crisp and delicious with noticible hop bitterness. I'm very glad that at least one really good brew is coming out of Florida."
"Pours golden with minimal white head that dies immediatly. Smells grainy and, like water. Taste is mildly refreshing with grain and water and a hint of something that might be malt. Smooth and thin in the mouth. If you dont need taste and want something that can go down quick and easy, this could do it."
"Good smooth nice MF. Prickly outro."
"Overall, I think it would be a great gateway Beer for someone just getting into the world of craft Beers."
"Overall, an easy beer to consume. Not really a top notch offering--something of a mix between the macrobrewed and the microbrewed. This is a great stepping stone for the Bud and Miller drinkers who think microbeers are too strong."
"Ybor Gold Amber Lager pours a light copper color with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I can smell a touch of malt in the aroma but that's about it. Flavorwise, I'm most struck by the caramel malt of this beer, there are some hops, but this is just a mediocre beer, it's not well balanced and not very enjoyable."
"Opinion. This is a pretty decent beer. I think that the malt is a bit too in charge and that the additions were too little too late. Other than this, the lagering gave the beer a clean palate. I would drink this again, but I hope that it would be a bit more...flavorful I guess."
"Overall: Decent but hardly a standout. Worth a try."
"I got this brew at a wedding in Tampa, Fl. It poured a nice amber color, that was rather translucent. There was not much head to speak of, and what was, retented fast. The lacing that sould have been left was absence. On top of this, there was no aroma, reminisecent of a macro lager. The taste had hints of hops and a tinge of malt undertones. The mouthfeel was the best, being sort of smooth. A fair beer. Don't drink and review."
"Not a great example of the style. But, not bad as a quick thirst-quencher on a hot day or to wash down some food with."
"Bought from a mix pack of Ybor Gold brews and this was one of the 5 beers featured. Pours a slightly hazy pale orange color with a quickly dissapearing white head. Aroma is malt, biscuits, grass and hops. Taste is light and crisp with malt dominating the taste followed by a quick hop bitterness towards the end. Just not too much going on here. Will not be purchasing this again unless I find it on tap somewhere."
"This american amber poured just that , a golden amber/orange hue with a small and quickly dissipating white head. Smell is mainly of the malts, toasty ,vienna/munich malt and also a fair amount of hop scent , quite nice. Taste is also malty. Some distinct hop bitterness to balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a slight crispness to the carbonation. I found this to be very tasty and drinkable american amber lager , brewed in the german lager style. I'll have to try and get a keg from the brewery here in FL!"
"This beer leaves me wanting. I'm just not a fan of the balancing. My first bottle the bitterness was excessive. The second time that wasn't so, but the malt had a grainy flavor that I didn't like."
"Easy drinkin all in all."
"Received this in a Beer of the Month club and enjoyed every one fully. Interesting story about the history of the brewery, its transformation from Cuban cigar factory, and its storied past. Great label that includes a chart of its color, taste, and body (considered above average in darkness, maltiness, and body). A bit lighter for a nut brown. Would definitely be interested in trying more Florida Beer Company brews."
"Pours a brilliantly clear copper color and is topped by a thin pale cream colored head. The aroma has a nice toasted biscuit malt note, a bit of sweetness that seems a bit fruity (which is atypical of a lager), in fact it smells a bit like grapes in the finish. The taste has a light malty sweetness to it up front, which continues through to the finish and is in fact the dominant note of this beer. There is a nice light bitterness in the finish as well that lingers for a bit. The beer also has a nice toasted malt taste to it and a bit of thin astringency to it. This is a really easy drinking, light and simplistic."
"A pretty good bee considering the style. Pours a nice clear golden-copper color with a little more carbonation than expected. Somewhat fizzy head that faded to a film. Holds nice aromas of barley malt, caramel, apples, bread, and a pleasant yeast souring. Tastes are similar, throw in sweet wort-like flavors with a nice dosage of bittering and flavoring hops (the American way). Feels light to medium on the palate, waters a bit in the finish leaving an abrupt hop residual flavor. A pretty good beer, although a but raw or green."
"I have usually discounted Ybor beers, even though they are just about the only ""local"" craft beer available here. This is a great alternative to macro lagers and a good session beer for drinking on a hot, humid Florida day. Give this beer to beer drinkers who only drink BMC products. I bet they'll like it."
"After a couple days on the gulf coast, I needed to find a real beer. This was my choice. (frankly it was this or Yuengling) I wouldn't call this spectacular, but Ybor was damn refreshing. I'd take this over your everyday fizzy yellow lagers any day."
"Drinkability  This was a funny mix but it all worked out well."
"Pours a clear, slightly copper golden hue under a 3/4 finger off white head with decent retention and a touch of lace. The nose is mild and slightly grainy, with a sweet undertone and a hint of bread. The mouth is very prickly and quite light. The taste opens with lots of barley, slightly sweet. A touch of slightly metallic hops emerges in the finish, getting stronger as the liquid warms. The aftertaste is sweet grain with just a touch of hoppy bitterness. An unimaginative but drinkable brew."
"From a 12 ounce bottle: The body is a tawney golden color with a supple off-white head. There is a hint of grain and herbal hops in the aroma. The taste follows through with plenty of grain sense along with the herbal hop notes that were present in the scent. The feel is medium with decent crispness in the finish. Good drinkability."
"Upon pouring, you wouldn't think it's an amber. Very light in color, bordering on being yellow. Thin layer of white head leaves little chunks of clumpy head atop the beer. Aromas are mostly maly sweetness with some grassy bitterness as well. Ditto for the flavor. Nicely balanced. Lingering hop bitterness. An OK amber."
"Overall a decent beer that I will have again when in Florida since that is the only place I have seen it."
"--Joey"
"The hops are lightly citrusy and a bit metallic. The finish is lightly sweet and fairly dry and clean."
"Poured a bright gold (well, that is quite a surprise). Aroma was slightly phenolic with a touch of metal, not off to a great start. Started off with some grainy sweetness that I thought was going to devolve into a corn-adjunct flavor, but the beer managed to keep it together and sailed through to a moderately bittersweet finish. The middle was noteworthy for some rather tart dryness, and the finish was fairly clean. Pleasant, and easy drinking."
"Medium gold color, small head that fades very quickly. A middle of the road lager. Lighter tasting. Mild malts and hops, but well balanced. Has some flavor to it, but nothing special with this beer. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Color is a lighter glowing gold of yellowness, silk thin white head, minimal drippy lace. Smell is clean with a musty malt overtone, lightly sweet and crisp of citrus. Taste is light and crisp of malts, quick sharp little bite then ends with a slight uneven hoppy light bitterness. Uneven lighter medium body with many spots of emptyness and a grainy textured middle, unpleasant and plain."
"Thanks to JohnnyDuvel!"
"Taste was a bit sweet-sour, clean, crisp and light. Toasted malt taste was vague. Hop bitterness was low end but about right for this beer. Tasted a lot like an American macro with a little more umph. A fine beer if you like a lighter style and just want to kill a few without really thinking to much about it."
"On the pour a clear gold with the head modest in size and a frothy white color after its evaporation, the resultant lace a thin curtain to drape the glass. Nose is malt laden and sweet, fresh and crisp with the start sweet with a fair grain profile, the top light. Finish adequately hopped and minimally acidic with a dry aftertaste, just a tad to sweet overall for me."
"I have got to say that I wasn't that impressed with this beer.  Looked OK, and a nice malty aroma was a good start, but I did not like the taste.  Sort of thin and sour tasting.  Maybe this was a bad bottle, but it did taste fresh and was just shipped to me.  Didn't really have much of a pleasent body either."
"Crystal clear dark golden, topped by a thick large bubbled head that settles readily.  Loose lace is left.  Soft bready malt and lightly toasted grain along with a mildly herbal and floral noble hop nose.  A snap of moderate hop bitterness quickly yields to mellow grainy sweetness and a persistent toasted malt note.  An herbal hop flavor then emerges and provides contrast.  Lightly bodied, but just full enough in mouthfeel to prevent overall weakness.  Finishes clean, w/ just a hint of light caramel malt.  Ybor Gold is a no frills brew with more than sufficient overall character to facilitate excellent drinkability.  Very quaffable."
"great session beer, light and crisp, like a lager should be. poured with minimal head which disappeared almost immediately. beautiful golden, clear color. unusual hoppy, but not unwelcome. malt character is there in the beginning but fads fast to leave nothing but hop after. reading about it, says there is a ""malt spiciness"" but i dont see it, the thing i get from it is the hoppiness flavor and no bite."
"Golden color, not much head and some bitterness.  After taste is slightly hoppy, the malt and hops are a much better mix as it warms up.  Hops are stronger when temperature is 40 or so."
"Notes: Good quaffing micro brewed lager. A little over the top for the hop flavour ... hell that is what micros are for."
"Good light lager with an assertive hop character."
"An excellent lager. Crisp and very refreshing. The brewery is an old cigar factory that I pass every day to work in Tampa"
