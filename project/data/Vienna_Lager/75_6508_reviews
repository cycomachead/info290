review_text
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It has a full taste - a bit malty - very bubbly. I would say it's my favorite Mexican beer that I've tried so far."
"Malty but very skunky in aroma. The flavor is clean and decently malty. Not bad overall, passable"
"Overall : A less-than-decent beer with a high grain bill and a low hop presence. The carbonation makes it drinkable but again, as a mexican beer the corny skunk does show up and rears its ugly horns. I'll pass next time, but this was a fun experience."
"Complete and Utter crap. Drink water instead."

"Clean crisp and light.  Not your typical light beer in that it's cleanliness taste is not muddled by sweetness."

"Served in a Mug"

"Great mexican beer, but not my style"
"This is another example of a beer that is very good when it´s fresh, but when not (most of the time) it tastes like you stuck a penny in your mouth, metallic notes everywhere."
"Nose of bread, hay, grains, slight fruit & honey. Taste sweet malt, touch of apple, hops, citrus, light bitter finish."
"Not too bad when lying in the sun in Puerto Vallarta"
"I think this beer is a little under rated. For the style beer, this is a refreshingly good beer especially in the summer months. Crisp taste, easy drinking and no bitter after taste makes a good beer for the novice drinker."
"One of the better Mexican beers"
"No Guinness at this Mexican joint in Arizona so they poured me this.  Not a bad beer at all ice cold and they didn't have my Irish brew"

"Bottle poured into a standard pint glass in Cabo San Lucas. A light coppery brown color with a will o' the wisp of a white frothy head. Aroma is a muted caramel sweetness, corn bread, and white grape fruity notes. Inoffensive and thankfully lacking an obvious DMS element. Still has that inescapable macro-lager smell though. Body falls squarely in the moderate range, with excessive carbonation. Taste is a smooth light corn bread sweetness coupled with the subtle grape notes from the nose. Minimal hop aroma or flavor. I do get a sultana raisin sweet dried fruit note here and there. Finishes fairly dry, with a grainy astringency and a few metallic off-flavors. Rather pedestrian brew unfortunately, even if it does represent the vestiges of a rather cool Austrian/German brewing tradition. This one plays it overly safe and still manages to hit a few bum notes."

"Sorry"

"This Modelo produced lager was pretty good. It was a light tan beer with a thin head that disappears quickly. The aroma was only slightly hoppy but the taste was crisp and refreshing"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not too good."
""
""
""
""
"I knew people who would bring Victoria back with them from Mexico back before it was commercially distributed in the US. I am not going to argue that it stacks up to craft beers but if you are looking for something on a hot day or something to stock for a party of non beer geeks this is a solid choice."

"Dark gold to light brown in color with wonderful clarity.  Just a trace of white head covers about a third of the top.  Aroma is predominantly corn but there is also light malt.  The taste is similar to Pacifico with corn being dominant.  There's a coppery hop bitterness at the very back of the palate that is prevalent in the fade.  The mouth is lightly carbonated.  Another warm weather quaffer from Mexico."

"By far my favorite cerveza from Mexico.  Not too watery, not to plain.  Great flavor, easy drinking and smooth.  Smells like a lager would but its not worth skipping.  Viva La Mexico   :)"
"This is possibly the best tasting Lager made in Mexico that's available, but hard to find, in the U.S.   I do not expect ale drinkers to ever give a favorable rating to a lager or pilsner.  In the same respect, I will not rate a heavy, dark beer unless I like(d) it.     Those of you who like the clean, refreshing flavor of PACIFICO ( Mexico ) will likely find that you'll love VICTORIA.  UNLIKE CORONA... you don't have to throw a salad into it to realize its beauty!"
" The malt has a good amount of flavor with mild caramel in the taste and there is a slight buttery diacetyl element with mild yeast flavor and practically no hop flavor. This is a pretty standard vienna style lager with mild malt and ok drinkability...I could take it or leave it."
""
""
""
""

"Standard Mexican lager. Light, malty , refreshing and empty.... Only for summer, only if you thirsty."
"The flavor has some mild toasted malt and biscuit notes and a clean hop finish.  It is a beer that is meant to be enjoyed as an adjunct lager and yes, it was.  But craft? No way.  Think of it for what it is and it will get better than a ""Poor"" rating. I didn't mind it considering the circumstances and I had two of them for dinner so that says something."
"Surprisingly good, great taste, no lime or salt needed. Only down side is availability. Not well known so few sellers."
""
"Mexican beers tend to be a little singular. But this one comes out of left field and is actually pretty good. Great flavor no corny/rice after taste found in most mexican beers. It isn't skunky, it's really decent. Good for a nice session and good at a BBQ a change of pace from coronas."

"Overall: this beer is listed as a Vienna lager, it's gotta be better than your typical AAL. I'm glad some of my family grabs this instead of coronas at family gatherings - I'll go for one of these if offered. Paired with Mexican food I might have more than one"
"Great from the tap with some fresh Mexican chow. Pretty good in a bottle on a hot summer day... hanging by the pool. Okay on an average day, though nothing special. It's not a strong beer; it won't do much for your buzz. Not worth the price in my opinion."
""
"Pours to a thin white head and light amber color. Aroma is mildly grainy and malty with a whiff of hops. Flavor is mild and grainy and reminiscent of corona and negra modelo. Mouthfeel is decent. Overall, a good Mexican Vienna that makes for a good summer session."
""

"O- it's drinkable and it would be nice on a hot day."

"Cheers!"
"Pours a clear amber in color and much darker than a Corona. A small white fizzy head was seen but didn't last long and settles to just around the sides of the 'boot'. Some very light lacing was seen but not much. The aroma is like more other Mexican beers, just some grains and malts but that's about it. The taste is pretty much like the aroma with a hint of some caramel malts sweetness. Lots of carbonation. Overall, just another average Mexican brew."
""
""
"My pour netted me a brief finger of fizzy, tawny head with lousy retention, acting more like pop and dissipating all too quickly. Color was a deep-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a malty sweetness that made me think that it was other than an AAL. I will buy Vienna Lager, as indicated on this site, but it was not clean. I was also getting Minhas-like notes of bubble gum and dry cleaning plant. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the taste was oddly unique or should I say uniquely odd? It had a slightly medicinal quality underlying the utterly sweet malt flavor. It was sugary with a tang of hospital sterilization, if that can be quantified by anyone else. Warming, I was getting a kind of peanut taste. WTF?!? The finish was semi-sweet with the melange of off flavors getting the better of the malt, but not in any kind of good way. I have had far worse, and thanks to it being available as a single, it was a one-and-done, but this was no bueno."

"It may be a BA misclassification, but if this is out there in the same market as Negro Modelo, and they're going to claim the same style, this one might as well not even be out there at all. Negro isn't great beer, but it's respectable, as opposed to this beer."
"Overall: I rate on style, and in this case Mexican lagers get thrown in for comparison, and this was pretty decent based on that. I imagine it tastes a whole lot better out of the bottle on a nice Mexican beach."
"Nothing to write home about. Not bad. Adjunct lager. Cool looking bottle label. Has some character. Not offensive. Good with food."
""
""
"Another brew from South of the Border that didn't quite cut it for me. Out of the bottle the beer had a great dark amber color with a perfectly white head to accent the beer. Unfortunately, the head had no staying power - dissipates ting very fast and leaving no lacing to speak or write about. I was very disappointed with the coppery scent of the beer and was wary to actually drink it, but was surprised at the decent flavor and mouthfeel. Overall, if you can get past the weird odor, Victoria is pretty decent."

"O: This beer doesn't taste much like a Vienna Lager and seems to be more like a sweetened version of an adjunct lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer looks OK and it smells like there is malts in the beer, but when you taste it it's really bland and there's not much there to look at. For a Vienna Lager there are definitely better beers that you can find from Mexico. If you're looking for something similar I would suggest maybe Indio, Negra Modelo or Bohemia. Those have more flavor than this. Plus, I've seen these sell for about $26.99 for a 24 pack; an insane price for the quality that you get."

"Thin and on the watery side, with just some faint caramel, and sweet malt. Would be passable on a warm day or if I was actually in mexico eating some tacos with hot sauce. Besides that stay away."
""
""
""
"Clear amber beer with med head.  Scent and flavor are similar with caramel and syrup notes.  Weighty mouthfeel because it is heavier on the malt than the hops, but not cloyingly so.  Overal a tasty beer.  Kind of like a Mexican Shiner.  Ask for this if you were thinking about Modelo Negro, it's a good alternative and one that isn't found many places."

"OK for what it is."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a amberish color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, bready. Taste is very mild, crisp, some grains, not exactly bursting with flavor. Feels light in the mouth and overall is nothing offensive, but rather boring."

"O: Fine in cloudy/cool Oregon; terrific in toasty/sunny Mexico. I now 'get' the allure of simpler, low-alcohol cervezas in a tropical climate. An enjoyable, no-nonsense pour - I liked it both straight and mixed with lime and other fruits in a 'michelada'. A good base beer or a fine quaff on a hot day - i may now look for this at the local tiendas (we do have a few here in Portland) to enjoy on those hottest of summer days (we do have a few of those, too)."
"I'm trying to figure out in what situation I would enjoy this beer..."
"Over all the beer is suppose to be a Veinna lager yet has no more flavor than your average mass produced lager."
""

"Overall – A pretty easy drinking session style brew. There is nothing great about it but nothing really all that bad. Just a so-so brew."

""

"A drinkable yet uninspired lager. Good to quench your thirst and probably on par with a classic Budweiser."

"Overall - One of the better beers to come out of Mexico. It's not a lager that'll blow anyone's socks off, but the flavors are fine and it's got a great mouthfeel. This one doesn't need the ""lime"" treatment."
""
""
""

"Victoria lager is a decent enough product and it likely won’t offend anyone, but it is quite unremarkable and it leaves little that is memorable. Try some if you like, just don’t expect to come away from the experience feeling very impressed."

"Nice amber lager. I have good luck with this beer. It has a nice aroma and a sweet and light hoppy taste. Great summer beer not heavy but has a bit of color and nice head. Being from Texas maybe we get fresher bottles. I am surprised about some of the weaker scores here. I have never found this beer to be flavorless or lacking carbonation. Maybe they should complain to their supplier."

"Aroma is crisp, malty and a bit fruity - nothing special, but at least palatable. It pours a nice dark amber with a fairly thick, though not persistent, eggshell head. Flavor is malty and crisp, a little fruity, again nothing special but better than what I expected. Texture has a good amount of fizz, if average body. Overall, a decent beer. Though it’s nothing spectacular, I’m glad to see this finally available north of the border."
""
"The body was nicely typical, good, smooth and even, perhaps a bit fuller than average and was just a wee bit sticky on the finish. Drinkability was good, I'd have a couple of these on a hat day at the park or beach. Overall, a nicely typical example of the style. You can find both better and worse versions out there. this one is worth a shot if you see it."

"poured into a glass from the bottle... actually looks very promising a brown/amber color not much head or lacing though. Smell isn't really that pleasant or present not offensive just not much there... Same with taste, what little taste there is in this beer isn't that great... Glad I got this one as a sample and didn't pay for it. Wouldn't turn it down if someone handed one to me at a cookout but wouldn't ever buy it in the store..."

"If I remember correctly, this one was my first beer in Mexico, so I might have been more generous than usual."
""
""
"Rather watered-down, though clean and straight-forward. Not bad, though rather boring compared to what the style could be..."
"Review from 7/2011 notes. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber. Thin white head, dissipates quickly, but stays effervescent. Light malt and grain aroma. A standard light sweet malt with light hopping average beer taste. Pleasant, but unremarkable. OK for drinking with Mexican food."
""
""
"Very poor choice of beer for myself. The color was a simmered brown, taste was completely lacking, not hoppy, nor bitter, nothing - no head at all, light on the carbonation. I felt like I was drinking a beer that just had no heart or soul put into it. sad"
"O - Nothing spectacular here, though nothing offensive and I'd certainly recommend this over a Corona Extra. Main downfall is that at 4% this stuff is a bit too close to water. Certainly an option to rehydrate from the hot sun though."

"Listed here as a Vienna Lager, but it seemes too light to hit that style. Unimpressive but unoffensive as well. Nice smoothness to the body, and, while there is a distinct corn adjunct note, it also lends a pleasant touch of sweetness and softens the beer. Finish is even, with some lingering corn sugar inflection. One of the better Mexican lagers."
"Overall pretty typical Mexican beer but it isn't bad."

"Overall: A Fair Lager, Better Mexican beers, wouldn't seek out again."
"From notes at a Mexican restaurant in Old Town where it was on tap. Not much to choose from and I hadn't heard of this stuff before. I would stick to Bohemia or Negra Modelo."

"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of rice, slight sweet malt, pale malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of a Vienna Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of pale malt, sweet malt, hint of hops, and a hint of rice. Overall, easy-drinking and well blended, but the rice aroma is off-putting and appearance is lacking."

"Overall: I thought this would be slightly better than the usual AAL crap...not sure why I thought that. Its just as bad if not worse. Nasty stuff and if this is a Vienna lager, then I'm Santa Claus."
""
"O: I like a good Vienna Lager, and Mexico makes some solid examples, Negra Modelo for instance. This is not one of them. Tastes like it could be the light beer version of Dos Equis Amber, just nothing going on. I'll finish the bottle, but I'm not buying this again."
"Overall, I'll give this a three because it's drinkable, and nobody cares about mouthfeel, anyway."
"Overall: a better brew that I have tried from Mexico. I doesn't sell itself with lime or salt and doesn't require it either. I would buy this beer for a Cinco De Mayo fest or if I was in Mexico and my choices were limited. (thanks to my friend Jose for bringing it to me for lunch break. as its a rarity that he gets it from family from Mexico."
"Terrible. TerriBLAY. Typical macro, perhaps ever worse. Absolutely no taste. Might as well have been water. I drank 5 beers in one hour and didn't feel or taste a thing. What's the point? Taste? Nothing, almost like water. Smell? Nothing. Mouthfeel? Slight carbonation...SLIGHT. Overall, terrible f-ing beer. I'm glad I didn't pay for it...I'd probably rather take a BMC over this. This is the stuff I'm glad I avoided for so long. PASS."
"O: Not worth the calories. I would gladly drink a number of adjunct lagers over this one."
"Overall, it's a clean, solid, tasty beer. Not my first pick, maybe, but my first pick out of what's currently in the fridge..."
"12 oz from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $1.35 In appearance its a light amber lager with a sparse dirty white head. Aroma is strange..certainlly slightly toasted malts but some hops too..the strange part is i get some old style rubber band aromas! Taste is semi-sweet..malty..a hint of hops.Actually OK. Nice hot weather type palate. I liked this..and if on vacation in Mexico this would be an excellent choice."
"Overall, not a good beer for my tastes; almost a drain pour. Maybe a bad batch? Won't buy again."
"O - I picked this up when I was last in Dallas. I'm going back soon. I won't be bringing this beer back with me."
"Overall I don't really enjoy this, it's mostly flavorless."
"Overall a very plain beer. Probably won't buy again"
"It's certainly better than its stablemates Corona and Pacifico, but far less spectacular than its in-style mate Negra Modelo. At least I won't need to spend two bucks in the future for a single bottle just to cure my curiosity."
"Mouthfeel nothing special! Needs a lime or lemon. way too expensive for this product. buy a 40 ounce before you waste your money on a six pack!"
"It smells ok. Looks decent, and the taste is pretty good. I will say it is a refreshing beer. Not the top Mexican beer, but you may want to try it...it's pretty good."
"Victoria has a clear, deep golden or even amber appearance, with some bubbles streaming up and a medium, white head. The aroma is of toasted barley malt and clean water, and the taste is also of barley. A light hop presence is in play for balancing. Also, one detects a pleasant sweetness. Mouthfeel is light and watery, and Victoria finishes crisp, refreshing, and mostly dry, although not as much as American beers. This is a low-alcohol, yet enjoyable Mexican beer. I certainly think it’s worth giving a try. RJT"
"Overall: I quite like this beer. A nice Mexican lager, for me it's right up there with Dos Equis Amber and Negra Modelo."
"For a Mexican beer, it's about average."
"Drink- Eh, not something I was gonna have again for fiqured why not. Better than I thought though."
"T: The taste is eerily similar to Corona and there's not a whole lot to like. Grain and a slight bit of lemon but nothing worthwhile."
"Overall: It's easy drinking and one of the better lagers out of Mexico. A good substitute to drinking the water when on vacation south of the border. Refers to itself as being ""pilsener-vienna"". I guess I can see that, as it's falling in between a lackluster pilsener and a hohum Vienna."
"Drinkability is good. Not going to be mistaken for a German Lager anytime soon though. A decent beer and a low alcohol one to remember if you want a beer at lunch while eating Mexican food."
"O: okay for what it is, a macro vienna lager, but not much there. Preferable to say Coronoa, Sol, or Dos Equious, but that's not saying much. It's 4.00%, so it is certainly a beer you could session, but in a world of so much choice, imho, choose a more flavorful beer."
"What would a Cinco de Mayo tasting be without some brews from beneath the border? This one pours a clear very pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises rice, wheat, light flowers, and a very light tinge of caramel. The taste holds notes of light wheat, hard water, flowers, and a tinny twinge in the back. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, this stuff is nice for a watery lager, but as a Vienna it falls pretty damn short of anything really good. Compared to similar bottles, though, this stuff ain't exactly horrid."
"Definitely not my favourite beer style, but an easy drinking light beer - a decent choice for the upcoming lawnmower season."
"Having the same people that make Corona attempt a Vienna Lager is akin to casting Mel Gibson in a remake of Schindler's List. It's a joke - and a twisted one at that. It's interesting that many Germanic styles have been preserved in Mexican brewing culture, but it's unfortunate that that culture now lay in the hands of Grupo Modelo and like breweries."
"Picked up from beercart on beer friday at work. Poured into a plastic cup. Amber colored, very clear, with no hint of a head upon the pour. Aroma is nearly non-existent... a faint hint of grainy malt. Flavor is very bland. There's some light caramel maltiness. Bitterness is very low. But, there are no off flavors either, no corniness. An extremely inoffensive beer. And I find that offensive."
"Growing up i've always heard the stories of things here being better in Mexico, not the water of course, but mostly edibles like Coke, Shrimp Cocktails, and of course, Corona. We've all heard the stories of the clear Corona bottles, however in Mexico Corona is distributed in brown bottles, making the overall taste a little better. Sure its not PtY, but then again this is America, a place where all things merge together to form pieces of art, like Fusion Cuisine or Megan Fox, making our land a canvas for craft brewers. So when I saw the ads for this beer I was extremely happy. Sure I didn't see an amazing craft brew, but I saw a new standard of Cerveza in the states. Go try one for yourself and be sure to have a good time with a little Jugo de Sanchez mix, or some lemon and salt. No need to be a snob about Mejicos beer scene, they're not telling you to pour this in your snifter you know. However if its Mexican Craft Brew you seek, please look up Groupo Cucapa. Stay thirsty my friends."
"M/D: Very light and refreshing, well carbonated but appropriate for the style, finishing dry and clean with no funk aftertaste that a lot of other Mexi beers have. Without a doubt - an all night drinker, and especially with a low ABV of 4%."
"Overall: Definitely worth a shot."
"O: Misses some style points, but nothing terribly wrong. Very drinkable overall (just nothing special)."
"Aggressive pour only gets you about half a finger of mixed bubble size head, pure white, lacks meaningful retention as well as lacing. The liquid is a blend of browns and yellows based in orange, has a metallic sheen which brightens it some, clear on the whole, a few lazy bubbles meandering here and there. Basic nose of grains, wheat, straw and then banana and corn, mild presence of flowers and peach, apple fruit, nothing really stands out from the pack, while uninteresting equally inoffensive. Medium-bodied, for its overall weight comes across as dense and unyielding, were it not for the charge put into it by the carbonation you might not feel it move. The initial sweetness provided by the banana, yeast, clove, flowers and corn fades in the face of wheat germ, rye and dried brown straw. Lowgrade mixed white citrus and stone fruits. More dirt than earthiness, increasingly metallic through the finish. Not much more to say, lacks the native complexity to elicit further prose."
"The flavor is quite nice, however, with characteristics of sweet corn and light caramel that are expected from a Mexican-style lager, but there is very little of the metallic graininess that most of the adjunct-laden Mexi-lagers suffer from. As a result, this beer is an improvement over many of the other options available at most Mexican eateries, but it still did a fine job cutting through the savory spice of the food."
"O: While this isn't terribly offensive, it wasn't very flavorful either."
"O -- Overall, not a bad drinker, but certainly not worth the premium price for which it's been selling. The above-mentioned Negra Modelo is easily as enjoyable and more economical. The sourness in the flavor starts to become more distracting after a couple, probably be hidden when paired with food."
"O: very drinkable & not a bad brew.. needs some tacos to go with it.."
"I had been waiting for this beer to be imported to the states for a very long time. Best mexican beer out there. 100 times better than that bullshit Corona. Overall I think this is one of my favorite beers. I would recommend for everyone to atlas try this beer once. You will love it. No doubt about it."
"What's up girlfriend....happy 40th! Yeah baby. So my Son's hockey team manager turns the big 4-0!!! YIKES! they have the Soirée at a N'ville saloon. On tap is Victoria....I said Hey man come down here...he said what you want....I said I want to try the Victoria! And I am glad I did! This beer is the best Mexican beer I have ever tasted. It doesn't have that Mexican I need a lime bullsh&t! There wasn't much aroma, but the taste and color were very good. Did I session....F yeah I did!"
"Drinkability - Easy drinking. Not complex enough to stay interested, but beats the hell out of American Adjuncts."
"Lightly sweet in flavor with some watery caramel notes. Bit thin in the middle and with a bit of Vienna maltiness on the finish. Feel is decent but in keeping with the light approach to the style. Decent drink given its lack of complexity. Tastes like a Corona with some added specialty malts, though not enough to give it any real character."
"D: This beer is unremarkable, but fairly refreshing. Its lightness makes it an easy drinker. There's a touch more flavor going on than in most mainstream Mexican beers."
"Overall, a light version of a Vienna lager. Hop bitterness comes on stronger than a BMC pilsner; but not to the level expected of a Vienna lager."
"One of the better mexican beers I have had, which still doesn't make it great."
"Poured into a pint glass, it has a thick light tan head and is very bubbly, the head dissipates quickly forming a thin tan crust on top of the body with no lacing. The body is crystal clear and is a semi dark bronze color with some good carbonation. You can smell some very light alcohol aromas mixed in with some wheat but not much else. The mouth feel is very light with mild malt flavors and some mild wheat flavors as well but not much else. This is a good simple beer."
"Pours an amber orange color with a mild malts scent. The taste starts rather bold with different grain but subsides shortly after. Very litte carbonation making the texture feel rather thin. A simple beer for people looking for some simple. Nothing too special here."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain and grass with not too much else going on. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of grain and grass, with some very sweet malt in there as well. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Extremely simple, but actually not too bad. Better than expected."
"It's finally available on the Texas side of the Rio Grande (at least in the RGV) better than Corona or Dos Equis but that's not saying much. Good drinkability, descent hops. Given a choice I'd rather have Pacifico or Barrilitos but this isn't bad."
"very good drinking beer bought one for me and my father paid $25 bucks for both 40oz bottles, herd stories from the old folks about this beer when i was growing up they swore that beers today dont compare to the unpasturised beer that victoria is they said they could even drink this beer at room temperature which i came to find out is very true and ill stick with the old folks knowledge since they've been around longer than me so cheer this is mexicos bet keep secret."
"Drinkability: Cold and wet. You will wonder if you are drinking beer."
"Nice almost amber color, darker than any other Mexican lagers, which are usually yellow. Enormous foamy head which sticks around, and tenacious, thin lacing. Smells like your basic high quality adjunct beer: corn husk, grain, faint lemon, salt water. Flavors are also of the HQ adjunct variety: bread, corn, slight tart fruit, some nice caramel malt flavors and more of a pronounced hops flavor than most with a dry finish. All in all nothing special, but definitely nothing bad either. It's a hot-rod version of a macro lager - a cut above, but just a small cut. They're marketing this as a kind of ""Mexican Premium"" beer and the price is way too high for what you get. This is priced alongside microbrews at $10 a six pack. Should be $7 max. Not really worth the price, which bugs me. If BA had a ""value"" category I'd give this a 2.0"
"Super high carbonation makes this really crisp, but the body is more watery than water itself. This is a really thin beer. One of the worst Mexican beers I have had. If you want something in this style in Mexico grab a Bohemia or a Negra Modelo."
"This beer sucks."
"Crisp clean taste, carbonic bite, a bit fizzy. Mild hint of apple and crackery malt. In a brown bottle, no detectable skunk. Fairly dry aftertaste. Easy enough to drink without thinking about it, but not really flavorful or memorable at all. The kind of beer that would improve with a lime in it, unfortunately."
"I really think some of my beer bretheren should give this beer another try since it is finally available in the US, right now its only available in Chicago But hopefully it wll move its way to Los Angeles and Dallas"
"You could pound down a bunch of these and not feel much, but if you're looking for a good tasting Mexican Vienna Lager, leave this one on the shelf and get some Negro Modelo instead."
"Certainly thirst quenching for those hot Mexican days but really doesn't belong in the conversation with Yuengling or Negra Modelo."
"If anyone has acess to any other Mexican 40oz please send me a message!"
"Avoid this beer, I don't know how this could have possible earned a B-. I would drink a 6-pack of corona without the lime before I drank another one of these. It's that bad."
"Not so hard-drinking though. Since this is usually the next best thing to Corona, it's tolerable. That said, this one is crappy, but doesn't taste like seawater and actually comes in a dark bottle."
"In the appearance is a copper color, poor head of foam, and some bubbles due to the high carbonation; the smell is fresh, some essences of roasted malts and carbonation; in the are roasted maltas and caramel, some carbonation again too; the mouthfeel have a little bitterness and a very refreshing end, beside the high carbonation again; in the drinkability, its good with the food or for parties, but sometimes i feel is ""apple soda""."
"Light to medium bodied, this one has taste, compared to the others. Same caramel, cookie, some hoppy bite. Nothing in your face, nothing spectacular, but tasty, and the best option I found around."
"Small off-white head doesn't last for long. Clear copper/orange in color. The smell kind of reminds me of a German marzen-bier. Caramel malts with a little bit of floral hops. Really good stuff. This is one of the best Mexican beers I've ever had."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer with substance that is worth drinking for a while."
"Last summer I went on a cruise to mexico with family and friends and before we got back on the boat in ixtapa-zihuatanejo, not sure which city it was, they were the same port, but anyways there was a dollar beer stand with corona and this victoria. We went for the victoria because it was darker and we had never seen it before. It was surprisingly good. I have never seen it since. We wiped out the supply that the lady and her kids were selling."
"D- Certainly a session beer, despite the comments."
"Picked up a 940mL bottle for the beach for about 15 pesos. Not bad for beer that doesnt suck. Like most of the big mexican lagers, this is fairly mellow in flavor. Its got a decent aroma of caramel and barley. The flavor is pretty similar, but not as strong and a little sweeter and fruitier. Not a bad choice for a vacation."
"Goes well with Mexican food."
"This is a very basic beer with a bland lager taste (a lot like Sol in a way). It goes down nicely and doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. Although not very strong it yields a satisfying buzz (probably due to the fact that I drank about three litres of it). It's pretty cheap too so in summation I'll say it's a decent beer to get if you're low on cash standing undecided in front of the cooler at a Mexican 7/11 five minutes before midnight (when they stop selling alcohol)."
"This brew poured to a deep golden color showing a fair amount of carbonation. Had a white head that was medium in size but does break down quickly leaving a very fain trace of any lace on the side of the glass. This brew is actually quite nice smelling, malt seem to come out as well as nice sweet aroma. Over all not a bad smelling brew but not overly exciting, did not have the skunky characteristics that a number of the other Mexican brews showed. The taste is good, nice malt flavors mixed in with a little hop flavor at the tail end, and good carbonation. This brew was one of my favorites while on vacation, very drinkable with its taste, carbonation as well as the 4% ABV. Overall this is a good brew, not sure I will run out trying to track it down while in the states but one I would definitely look for while back in Mexico."
"¡Salud!"
"Pretty light lager mouthfeel, hops aftertaste is quite nice. I could drink quite a few of these. As far as macros go, this is a very solid beer."
"a beer bad classified; is a Vienna Lager, not a marzen oktoberfest; how ever, a beer made only for the domestic market, special for the mexican quesadillas and bbq; recommended with german cuisine too; its bitterness and strong flavro make this beer favorite for mexicans; in its bottle etternaly appears ""king Juan Primus, duke of brabant"" alias GAMBRINUS; an indomitable drinker monarch."
"¡Salud!"
"Pours with a decent white head, settling over clear deep gold gently carbonated liquid. The nose is nothing more than light maltiness. The taste as well is very light, with notes of brief grassy malt before drying out with a nice amount of hop bitterness. A slightly above average Mexican lager."
"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. Pours with a pretty nice head and a bit of lacing. Suprised me considering the rest all disappeared with a blink of the eye. Smells of malt. corn, maybe rice fill the air. A bit of a hop smell too. Definite hop tatse with the malt background. This would be a decent beer to choose while having dinner. Fairly easy to drink. One of the better ones down here, but still nothing even close to brag about."
"I recently sampled this beer while vacationing in Cozumel, Mexico. It was a decent beer, typical of most Mexican beers in my opinion. Light and easy drinking. Nothing really special about it. Although it does make a great beer to chill on the beach and drink."
"Decent mouthfeel with very good drinkabliltiy. While not a world beater, this was one of the best beers I was able to find in Cancun. Seems to have good distribution. It is worth a try!"
"It is smooth and medium bodied. A bit over carbonated but it finds its way down easy. I did notice some inconsistencies from beer to beer. Maybe storage problems or the brewery is not able to continually be accurate. Still I enjoyed this beer."
"Definitely one of the better Mexican beers. This one actually has some tint to it. It is really easy to drink and tastes like a ricey-watery malt mix. I don't think it is as good as the Negra Modelo or Indio so at this point you may envision Victoria as a decent alternative to Corona with a little color.."
"This beer saved my trip down to Playa del Carmen, MX. It is the only darker beer I could find (and I use the term loosely). Pours a little browner than a lager with a thin head and little lacing. The smell is sweet with some hoppiness. The flavor and mouthfeel was existent, great for a Mexican beer. This beer is actually very good, however, after 8 days in Mexico, I noticed inconsistency which may not be the brewery's fault. The brown bottle is also a welcome sight in an area that is not overly concerned with storage issues."
"One of the few decent Mexican beers I have been able to find. Maybe not quite as good as Negra Modelo (which isn't really saying too much) but along the same lines and a decent alternative. On the scale of Mexican beers this is in the upper echelon, but it really does not stand up against other more readily available Viennas. I would go with an Elliot Ness here in the states, but this one is worth a shot if you are in Mexico with only Corona and Sol as your other options."
