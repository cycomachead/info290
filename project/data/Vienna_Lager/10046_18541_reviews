"Worst beer I have ever had."
"3.07/5: No estÃ¡ mal"

"Overall: A lacking, humdrum lager. No Mas."

"Overall: A great, for my tastes, amber lager.  It seems to be they brewed an Amber Ale with Lager yeast, rather than a lager with some specialty malts.  I'm not positive I can slam it back like some easier drinking amber lagers, but the first one sure does go down better."

"It began foaming through the neck as soon as I popped the cap, which is always my cue to begin a gentle pour. As you might imagine, I was faced with a LOT of head, so I decided to let things settle through a rest before continuing. Finally, a dense finger of light-tan head that was collapsing in on itself like a black hole! Color was a deep coppery-amber (SRM = > 13, < 17) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was sweet, but pleasant, with notes of caramel, freshly baked bread and honey. That is what I am usually looking for in a lager - the honey-like sweetness! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, almost, but not quite, creamy. It was sweet, of course, and the bready malt was in balance with the honey sweetness. I was really digging this, especially following another AAL. Finish was semi-sweet with a taste like honey-drizzled biscuits. I would certainly drink Uno Mas of these!"

"Eh. Mediocre."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of light malts, grains. Taste is malts, caramel, some hops, very refreshing and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is good summertime beer."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."
"as amber lagers go, this is a great one, pairs well with fresh street tacos too! luscious white head, lacy and robust, several inches tall and long lasting. medium amber color, clear but leaning dark, smells like lager yeast more than grains, but dry red malt is ahead of sweeter caramel malts on the nose at least. a little sweeter in the flavor, even brown sugar notes here, but everything is so relaxed, its just sort of a refreshing nondescript all day drinker for me. nobody would ever know this is over 6% abv, feels barely like 5%. clean as lagers are, but this one is super down easy, even washes away Serrano pepper heat rather effectively. better than many ive had from lost coast, a real crowd pleaser here, with a medium but refreshing body, happy carbonation, and enough hops to balance out a slightly more elaborate grain bill. it works for me, especially with Mexican food, and I suspect it would work for anyone in that context. beyond that, maybe a little boring, but a tasty brew overall that looks superb and overall does the trick."

"Pours a murky honey brown with a 2 inch foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some slight sour cherry aromas. Taste is of toasted and slightly burnt malt, caramel, and a slight sour fruit note on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer flavor wise and definitely not something I would go after again."

"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent beer. I personally like the malty balance, but they may have over-done it a bit for this style. I like the high carbonation, and it definitely keeps the beer from getting boring. If you are a big fan of the Amber style, I would definitely recommend that you pick this one up to recalibrate yourself toward the malty side of this style as it is still probably within the guidelines, but it is a bit of a loner for a brewery on the West coast."
"Nice mouthful of malt. Caramel is the pleasant taste. Hops come along before long. Surprisingly tart after a few sips. A bit of a dirty taste after a while. Nice roasted malt nose, a hint of fruit. Quite attractive coppery amber in the tulip glass, nice lacing. Clean and well made, a good quaff. Each sip renews the malty flavor with just a touch of sweetness."
"Taste is definitely caramely on the malts, fairly sweet and has some butter-flavored diacetyl issues that actually work ok for this style of brew. Moderate toasty flavors but never nears harsh, and it probably helps that I cannot detect any hops at all. If I did not know better, I would have said no way this is a lager...tastes more like an ale with a nutty yeast presence. I like it well enough though and would reach for this before a Fat Tire anyday. After trying 5 different Left Coast beers, I feel like Im going back to the early 90's to a brewery at the forefront of the craft beer movement. I think these beers would have been looked at as fantastic back in 1992, but now they struggle to be even average compared to their modern counterparts. Id be more willing to drop 7 bucks on a sixer of this than ever pay 6 bucks for a bomber again."
"A decent beer - fairly simplistic (not much complexity at all), but nothing particularly bad about it. One of the more pleasant beers I've had from Left Coast, however. Just not one I think I'd pick up again."
"Not a bad beer, for a hot day, but not too complex. Lacking any strong hop flavor so the finish is a little flat, but a wholly drinkable beer that is a step up from the mass market stuff.That said it is priced with premium beers that are more interesting. I would use this as a good beer to introduce craft beer to someone, as a step up from factory beer."
"Drinkability is OK. OK beer to sweet for my tastes."
