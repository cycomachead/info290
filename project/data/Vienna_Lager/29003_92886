4.04,11.3,4,4.25,4,3.75,4,"Really an full-flavored and highly drinkable beer. And for this category, it's far above the middling. I think Gigantic is making some very interesting as well as drinkable brews. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle.","mactrail","Sep 23, 2013"

3.88,6.9,3,3.75,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy dark honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, toast, and brown sugar aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and caramel flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 21, 2013"

3.83,5.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,4,"The palate opens moderately sweet with whole wheat bread(yum!), brown sugar, a little buckwheat honey and the hop flavors - am not, earth and lemon. Hop bitterness is medium low with a pleasant earthy bite. Medium in I'm body with a long sweetish finish with bread, brown sugar and earthy hops, this beer is very smooth on the palate. Carbonation is creamy and delightful. Quite clean on the palate as well, i don't detect any obvious flaws, though their is a hint of sulfur way in the back.  Thoroughly enjoyable.","DefenCorps","Beers"
3.28,-9.6,3,3,3.25,3.25,3.75,"The body was good, a bit lighter than normal, not as sticky as you often find, and with a crisp finish. Drinkability was very good, if I had had a six pack, I probably would have drank 3-4 of them. Overall, a pretty tasty brew. Not typical for the style, but very enjoyable indeed. Worth trying when you see it.","beertunes","0"

4.18,15.2,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Drinkability is pretty high, a fairly tasty, satisfying Vienna larger that is full enough to satisfy, but balanced enough to session. The malt is well show cased, but I could use less phenols.","ccrida","Apr 27, 2013"
3.9,7.4,4,3.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Poured into a Warsteiner pokal. Pours medium coppery amber with a two finger white head retained by active carbonation. Spicy aroma of biscuit malt, slightly nutty with an unusual cola component. Flavor of bready and biscuit malt, light toasted brown bread, slightly sweet with a pleasant slightly spicy lightly toasted biscuit malt finish. Light bodied with active carbonation. This is very nicely made in a style that often is encountered as a mass market beer. If this is true to the Vienna lager style, I'm sorry I've missed a great example all these years. Subtly flavored, but refreshing and delicious. I enjoyed this more as I drank the bottle and boosted the taste rating a bit as a result. This is a nice light lager.","LiquidAmber","Beers"
3.73,2.8,4,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"For whatever reason, this brewery just recently popped into my local area (don't worry, I'm not arguing, just expressing the surprise at the randomness, that's all), and this is the first I'm gonna try. Why not, right? It pours a clear auburn-copper topped by a finger of lightly off-cream foam. The nose comprises candied orange peel, light brown sugar-cinnamon, and a healthy dose of biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with the piloncillo sugar really shining through, providing a nice sweetening foil to the biscuity mass interpenetrating with it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a pretty nice Vienna, one that showcases the quasi-exotic sugar quite well. Not a bad debut for these guys (it's their debut for me, anyway).","TMoney2591","0"
