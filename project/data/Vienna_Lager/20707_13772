3.57,15.9,4.25,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Fat Cat pours out a hazy burnt orange color with a head that retains very well. The aroma is deep and malty, with a touch of macro-esque twang that honestly doesn't work too bad. The taste offers a well-developed caramel malt, without much else to hang out. That said, it's tasty, but lacking in any depth whatsoever. The mouthfeel is light for sure, but has a little heft and smoothness to help the malts along. The drinkability is good. Overall, Fat Cat is a solid malty lager.","shand","May 09, 2013"

I recommend that anyone who gets the chance to taste this beer, do it! It is amazing, with a malty toasted arome and slightly bitter crisp taste and a dry finish. I wish it was available in San Diego, although I hear it is coming soon.","Fusionfingers","Feb 28, 2013"

3.32,7.8,3,2.75,3.5,3.25,3.75,"It's like good cheap diner food ...but in beer format. It doesn't really conform to any style per se, but say yes to the wiley pie-eyed cat. It far surpasses any of the American pißwassers and even some of the PBRs, Naty Bohs, Rolling Rocks, and Yuenglings for comparable or lesser price.","gunterheidrich","May 12, 2012"

4.61,49.7,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"I had this one at a small dive bar on tap for a buck a pour (1 pint) its great beer for a great price. The initial look of it is light, golden had a great head that lasted for a good amount of time. Smell of a bit of corn, kind of like a Pabst. Its mainly a basic lager mouth feel but its good for after the expensive beer. The taste was nice, crisp clean and down to the point. Worth it!","KC9LDB","Dec 04, 2011"
3.08,0,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Beer is medium to light in body and sweet with a heavy finish. Not very good but not too horrid. I don't think I'd ever have it again but it is a new brewery and worth a look. Mildly corn / grain finish on the backend.","drabmuh","Sep 23, 2011"
3.38,9.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O – This is a pretty decent brew and highly drinkable. I could have a few of these on a hot summer day. Absolutely worth a try.","GallowsThief","Aug 29, 2011"
3.33,8.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Nothing overly exciting, nothing really offputting, just a very straightforward beer company beer. Clever marketing and a cat on the can and voila - perhaps people will buy it.","indiapaleale","Aug 25, 2011"
3.47,12.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not half bad, the real factor will be pricing ... the value is there but only to a certain level with many other craft lagers in the market.","Jason","Jul 31, 2011"
3.77,22.4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The legendary woodychandler comes through again with another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a caramel color with orange hues and a 1 inch head. Smell is big on malts, biscuts, a touch of sweetness. Taste is also very malty, some biscuts and hops, more subdued than the smell. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality brew.","tone77","Jul 09, 2011"
3.26,5.8,4,3,3.5,3,3,"This is a nice amber/vienna lager, and nothing like its packaging and price range (less than $9 for a twelve pack) would suggest. It is brewed and canned in Monroe, Wisconsin so apparently contract brewed by Minhas.","cpolking","Jun 30, 2011"
3.36,9.1,4,3,3,4,4,"For an orange can with a silly slogan, it is actually good taste and overall mouthfeel. Amber in color, this beer is perfect for quenching your thirst on a warm, summer day.

3.41,10.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D- 3.5 I could easily put down a few of these, though I probably wouldn't want more than a couple. It is unique for what I've tried. I find it a little off-balanced on the malt side but there are some other notes coming through. Not my favorite combination of flavors but decent... For 5.99/12-pack, I can't complain. Better than the average mass-produced domestic anyway!","KYBrewgrass","Apr 18, 2011"

2.34,-24,3.5,2,2.5,1.5,2.5,"The flavor is a bit heartier than your typical adjunct lager, but it is much lighter than a malt liquor, it is like a bastard melding of the two. I wouldn't go so far as to say it is a vienna lager, maybe it is brewed with vienna malt but i can't really taste it.","crossovert","Dec 14, 2010"
3.06,-0.6,4,3,3,3,3,"D: Decent, but not great. I could see this being a pretty good choice for a hot summer bbq. But then again, there are a lot of canned beers out there that are way better. Average all around.","Beejay","Dec 05, 2010"
3,-2.6,3,3,3,3,3,"This is the definition of a hipster beer. The same people who drink this stuff are the same people who ironically drink PBR, pretending its cool, which it is not. This beer is exactly what you would think it is and has no distinguishing features other than the cute can.","ronniebruner","Dec 04, 2010"
2,-35.1,2,2,2,2,2,"Overall: The body of the beer is thin and the finish is medium thin. This beer is not at all good. The nose gives an English barleywine aroma and the taste is just a cross between an American Adjunct lager and a red ale that is sweet and under hopped.","colts9016","Nov 23, 2010"
4.17,35.4,3,3.5,4.5,3.5,5,"The Crack & Glug produced a little better than a finger of ecru head with better retention than the Bros experienced. Note: please see me if you would like to see the Glug pour performed before your very eyes. It CAN be done in the privacy of your own home or on-stage as audience size may dictate. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber, hence the CAN's color. I really dig truth in advertising. Nose was very malty-sweet with a hint of hops underlying the sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a really honey-like lager sweetness on the tongue. I may be jaded following so many clinkers out of a CAN, but this was both pleasant and enjoyable. This was unencumbered lager, plain and simple. Finish was unobtrusive, slightly sweet, but not sugary and unquestionably lager. I really liked this and would certainly put it in my infamous beach cooler. Where CAN I get some more?","woodychandler","Nov 13, 2010"
3.18,3.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Sometimes beer is just beer; perhaps this is not the poster beer for Vienna Lagers, but it does quench the thirst. Aside from the poor head retention, this is your basic quaffable Amber Lager.","BeerAdvocate","Nov 12, 2010"
2.87,-6.8,2.5,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Pours a rather dirty orangey-golden like hue with huge tan head. Nose was a little bready. On the palate it was light bodied, watery even, with mellow malt flavors and a bit of melon fruit. A peep of hop bitterness hits towards the end, and into the finish. Drinks easy but only because flavors are so muted and body is so light.","yemenmocha","Nov 07, 2010"

3.48,13,3.5,3,3,3.5,5,"Final Notes: I actually, for some reason, really like this beer. An ideal beer to take with you to the beach or tailgating when you can't carry glassware and just want to drink straight from a can. Your lesser-beer drinking buddies will also appreciate it, I think.","bagpiper2005","Sep 01, 2010"
1.9,-38.3,3,3,1,2,2,"It has been a while since i last found this beer but i do remember it being a not so good experience. I found this beer once at a local sams club and have not seen it since(and i am not sad about it). The can is eye catching and looks like an old cartoon series. the smell was average. I remember the taste was that of a cheap domestic beer with a taste of aluminum. most beers are worthy of trying at least once but you may want to purchase only 1, not an entire case.","dostom","Jan 18, 2010"

3.2,3.9,3,3,3,3,4,"This one is a staple in my house, which is a good thing, for the style and price this beer goes great on a summer afternoon. Nice orange copper pour but no head to speak of after a real short time. Aroma is of a typical vienna lager, malt. Taste is much of the same, mostly base malt, with a touch of specialty caramel malts and possibly even a tinge of rye (probably not). Some hops just to balance it out. This is a very drinkable beer as are most in this style, but what I like is that at $6.49/12 pack, I get no hints of crappy additives in this beer, their may be a touch of corn, but it tastes pretty good.","mnstorm99","Sep 09, 2008"

2.78,-9.7,3,2.5,3,2,3,"Originally reviewed on March 16, 2006. Poured from a can. Pours an orange copper, with a fast fading white head. Aroma of dusty malt and light sweetness. Flavor is similiar, with a markedly surprising sweetness and caramel quality, for the style at least. Palate is watery, but drinkable. As I commented to the purveyor, for a Pale Lager in a can from Wisconsin, its not bad.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 08, 2006"

2.38,-22.7,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"This beer may be the only beer with orange food coloring added to it. The body is bright orange, head is small and off white. Smells like sweet and sour sauce, really a funny egg smell to it. Taste is rather thin and one note, malt and slightly sweet, with barely perceptable hops in the background. Not very good, this is cheap beer that makes an attempt at something other than the classic cheap macro flavor, which is admirable.","TastyTaste","Sep 16, 2005"
3.18,3.2,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This is not bad for a cheap macro-style lager. The flavor characteristics are more positive than not.","garymuchow","Dec 27, 2004"
2.66,-13.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Darker than I expected, fully reddish copper with a watery 1/8 of an inch head that hangs for about 40 seconds. Comma-like lace. Lightly butterscotch malt aroma. Flavor goes the opposite direction, slightly astringent with lemon Life Saver candy elements. Flattens and bottoms out at the close with just a touch of bittering. A little south of par in comparison to regional macros, but the appearance was much more impressive than it could have been.","ADR","Oct 26, 2003"
3.26,5.8,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Well I wasn't really expecting much with this beer and actually I was pleasantly surprised.  I found out about this beer on this site and I always kept an eye out for it.  I finally found it being sold in single cans.  I figure since Mn Brewing is bankrupt, they are just trying to get rid of it.  I does have a nice deep orange color to it and a surprising foamyness that sticks in white lace. Taste is mostly malt with a slight hop bitterness.  I'd take this over most American Style Lagers (esp. the macros).  While it is enjoyable  I don't know if it is a drink all day kind of beer.  I'll test that out on my labor day weekend fishing trip.  I was looking for another decent beer in cans (no bottles allowed)!","JeffreyG","Aug 27, 2002"
