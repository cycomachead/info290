"A solid amber colored Vienna Style lager. The beer has a nice roasted malt backbone with only a touch of sweetness. The finish is crisp and refreshing. This has been one of my go to beers this summer since I first saw it in the grocery store a few months back. I fell in love with Millstream's Baltic Porter over the winter, this is another offering from the Amana, IA based brewery that does not disappoint."

"The body is medium, maybe on the lighter side but not too thin. Crispness is just active enough."

"A very drinkable, respectable amber lager. Perhaps it won't blow you away, but it certainly won't disappoint you either. Nice and refreshing."

"O - A decent low ABV beer. Nothing mind blowing, just an easy drinking Lager."
"Prognosis: thirst quencher it is, and not bad, just not overwhelmingly ___ (fill in the blank) or not overwhelming in any way."
"Head dissipated quickly. Can not get past the sour aroma and sour taste. Will not buy again, but probably is just my personal preference for a more balanced, overall drinkable beer, without a major spike in one characteristic that you fixate on while drinking."

"Medium bodied with light carbonation. Not bad, but nothing to get excited about either. I will pass on this one in the future."

"An above average vienna lager."
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer overall. Others in this style have more hops presence than this one, which is a positive to me. It is a touch sweet, but the nut flavor and hop bite at the end balance it nicely. Easy drinking and worth a try."

"Finishes clean with light bitterness and lingering sweetness. Quite drinkable, nothing spectacular but I'd drink it again."
"This beer pours a cloudy orange-amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt with a fairly strong sourness to it. It smells more like a Berliner Weisse than a Vienna Lager. It's not a bad aroma. On the contrary it is actually quite pleasant. It just isn't what a Vienna Lager should smell like. The taste is a lot less sour then the aroma, but there is still a faint hint of sourness in the background. Up front there there are some nice caramel notes with some light floral hops. I think I would like it a bit better if the sourness were a little stronger. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation for the style. Overall, I'm not sure if something is off or if the brewer really did intend on this beer beings slightly sour. Either way I can't see myself drinking this one again."

"O: A solis, sessionable lager. Worth buying."
""
""
"O- An ok beer but other than the aroma it more or less disappointed me."
""
"O- tasty with a < 5% ABV, i could drink this one again , recommended"
"This is a very nice and easily drinkable beer. Not at the top for the style, but overall, a beer that would easily be sessionable."
""

"Taste: My first impression is of a slightly above average Oktoberfest. The beer is smooth, light bodied, full of biscuity, toasted malts, and ultra drinkable. It does come in a bit fruity though; maybe cotton candy like? A pinch of spice from the hops compliments the finish along with that lager sulphur-like quality. I'm detecting a bit of apple and white grape juice in there as well. For a beer clocking in at below 5%, I have to give Millstream credit for pulling out tons of flavor from the malt bill. If you're looking for a beer to pair with brats/kraut or chili, look no further."

"Taste is again somewhat average. It certainly has the malted punch that my nose picked up. The fruit tones aren't there as much but it is slightly sour. It's not complex so I wouldn't call it balanced but it is enjoyable. It's good in it's simplicity."
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice solid beer worth pounding for while."
"I seem to be consistantly disappointed by this brew. It looks good but has kind of an odd, slightly sour smell to it. The taste has some good malt character but that same slightly sour essence detracts from that too much for me to enjoy it. The body is good but the sourness seems to linger. I've had a bottle before that I drained because it was so bad. This would most likely be a good beer if Millstream did better quality control on it. I've haven't had this problem before with their other brews."
"Cheers!"
"D: I would try this one again in Iowa, but never again any where else."
"M - Light body with good carbonation. Has a sticky finish."
"Taste, smooth and the malt content seems to be just right, thin enough, yet chewy. Would have liked to have seen just a little more hop zest, 20-30 ibu, instead of what tastes like 10-15. But its probably more in the tradition of a good Vienna or oktoberfest. Plenty of that nutty caramel thing going on in the mouthfeel, but it just is too middle of the road for me."
"Drinkability: Not much complexity, but it is tasty, rich, and very drinkable. As an Iowan I hate to say this, especially since this beer just won a gold medal at the World Beer Cup: when it comes to Vienna style lager, I think Trader Joe's Vienna Style Lager beats Schild Brau. By a hair, though."
"D: Not my favorite but would drink again."
"The liquid was a very light amber/ copper color with a thin white head. It smells mostly of sweet caramel malt, there is a hint of nutty malt and it's a little yeasty. I could taste some apricot, also toasted bread and sweet caramel candy. The body is light - medium and the carbonation kind of bites the tongue and it leaves the mouth sticky. The Schild Brau has very rich flavor for a lager, I would love to be able to get this on a normal basis."
"Quite simply, this is outstanding."
"Nice amber color, good taste and feel. A little bit of a bitter aftertaste. Almost no head at all when pouring. It's worth a taste."
"D: sessionable (relatively), but interesting as well."
"Notes: An average/middle of the road beer. Not bad but not outstanding. A lot of malty flavor with a decent hop flavor."
"I know I like bock brews the best, but this brew is my top favorite brew from Millstream Brewing Co. (their bock beer trails in a close second). At least once or twice a year, my wife and I visit the Amana Colonies when we visit her sister, of whom lives in Cedar Rapids (not too far away from the Amana's). We always go to the colony where there the brewery in located, which I think is in Middle Amana. Great beer!"
"I really enjoyed this beer. Looks great, dark amber color with nice head. Great taste and flavor, very drinkable for any beer drinker. Being in Iowa, I need to try some more Millstream beers. This was the first I've had and I look forward to trying others."
"The palate starts malty and ends malty. But the middle has a weird, musty hop palate that doesn't bridge the gap between sweet and bitter very well. All and all a nice session lager that I wouldn't mind buying again."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied and very crisp feel. Very easy drinking."
"I had several of these in Iowa over the holidays from the sampler pack and it was by far my least favorite in flavor. Those were drinking straight out of the bottle vs. this review, where it was from a glass, made a huge difference. From the bottle, not palatable at all, very metallic. From the glass, the floral and malt sweetness comes through and hides most of the metal. Decent beer, not my favorite style."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice one to drink."
"D: this is quite quaffable and enjoyable. The flavors are subtle but there seems to be a decent amount of complexity for such a light beer This leaves a nice flavor in the mouth which will keep you coming back for more. This typically isn't my style, but I found this version to be quite enjoyable"
"not bad at all, pretty easy to drink and a nice flow of flavors that complimented each other."
"A very drinkable beer, especially sitting out in the brewery's beer garden."
"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Pours to a copper color with a nice, fluffy off white head. Aroma is mainly malt, some caramel. Sweet taste, caramel, kind of bready with a slight bite at the end. A very tasty beer. Medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation. Overall a pretty good beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a pilsner glass, beer is a clear, copper color with a thin but solid off-white head. The nose is readily apparent and is of lightly toasted, slightly sweet amber malt. No hops to speak of. The taste has the same feel; lots of caramel and lightly toasted grain (victory perhaps?), a bit bready and hops to balance but no real hop presence. The mouthfeel is light in body with an almost creamy carbonation and a slightly dry finish. Certainly a drinkable beer, this could be an easy session beer."
"The mouthfeel is not very refreshing and is kind of rough. I do like the carbonation because it redeems this brew from being almost undrinkable. This one could use more of everything, more hops, grain, nose, flavor, you name it. One word can describe it... boring. It's a girlfriend beer."
"D: This is a decent beer. It didn't tug at my heartstrings, but I still enjoyed it."
"Decent offering of the generally bland ""amber"" non-category (which oft-times gets shuffled into ""Vienna Lager."" Well-balanced, with a nutty, bready sweet flavor offsetting a moderate amount of bitterness. Defintely a step beyond the ""Fat Tire," ""Killian's"" breed of this entry level style; with a more forceful front edge and a thicker mouthfeel. Enjoyable enough, but nothing to set the world on fire."
"Not a bad start, but this beer seems like its crying out to be something more. I enjoyed the bottle I had, but I wouldn't fancy a second."
"Overall a surprisingly tasty lager, not at all what I was expecting. Very enjoyable!"
"D - I enjoy this beer and it drinks as well as any marzen that i've had the pleasure of drinking. I am eating some buttered popcorn along with this beer."
"D: This is a great summer / BBQ / session beer. It's nice to have a good lager that reminds you of what you enjoyed about beer in the first place. I'll look around for a local brew that is comparable to this for my summer drinking."
"The beer pours with a very light copper colour and a slightly off white head of about a centimeter in height. The head lingers for a while, which makes the beer look quite nice. When smelling the beer, toasty, bready flavours come out. In the back end is a nice malty sweetness. When drinking the beer, there is a huge maltiness coming from the Munich malts, and some caramel comes through as well. A floral noble, type hop comes through at the finish with the nice crispness from the lagering of the beer. I think the extra hoppiness makes this beer a little bit out of style, but this tastes great; moreover, this is probably closer to a hoppy Vienna lager. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy with a good carbonation. Quite drinkable."
"Hallertau hops and a most decent lager. Quaffable and satisfying. A medium yellow colour, minimum white head. Neutral aroma, medium mouthfeel. Decent beer all around,I could have one or two. Nothing edgy or really tasty though. Appropriate carbonation."
"Pours a striking resemblance to cheap Canadian Whiskey(my favorite kind) a brown amber is topped by a thin soapy beige head that has poor retention and no sticky remnants. The nose is suprisingly hoppy and has nice soft floral notes as well as a hint of caramel malts. Millstream has a good Marzen here, not outstanding, but very solid. A superb balance of malt and hops, and a near perfect match, though the caramel malts slightly over shadow the fruity hop undercurrent. A touch of spice is very subtle and blends in well. A little tartness / bitterness on the finish adds another dimension and is easily appreciated. The body is full figured for a Marzen and delivers a good amount of texture as well as a nice dry finish. It may be out of the Oktober Fest season, but that didn't stop me from enjoying every drop of this delicious offering."
"A: A burgundy bronze color, paper thin layer of tight bubbles over the beer, very clear - 4.00, S: Lots of amber malts, some burnt brown sugar, faintest sign of hops - 4.25, T: Very smooth and pleasing, more malt than hops but there is the slightest touch of hop bitterness on the tail of this beer, caramel - 4.00, M: Pleasant mouthfeel - 4.00, D: This beer was a surprise, not generally my style but I found this to be extremely drinkable, a solid representation of the style - 4.00"
"Overall: Thanks to BuckeyeNation for generously giving me this beer. It was a good beer, but the flavor was pretty mild and slightly boring. Definately not bad though."
"Schild Brau is a good beer, not a great beer, but a good beer. Its flavours could be more pronounced, but the whole experience is uplifted by a heavenly drinkability, and in this sense the more muted tones do help to make it sessionable. I would definitely return to this oktoberfest again."
"Very solid brew from Millstream. Quite impressed. Hope to try some more from them in the future."
"Taste has a decent malty character with a strong bitterness upfront and lingers, but I can't help the feeling that this just feels a bit thin and watery."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer. I am looking forward to trying others from this brewery."
"I would drink it again!"
"Clear, pleasant copper-orange body topped with a thick finger of off-white head; modest duration and lacing accompany it. Subtle malty nose, decent caramel and a bit of hazelnut--not enough of either. The flavor is better with a bit of chocolate emerging eventually. Smooth mouthfeel, very nice. A fine all-around beer, certainly not spectacular nor off-putting, a good solid representative of the style. Wroth trying."
"D-A decent session brew...but too sweet for me to make it one. This is the Iowa version of Yuengling Lager...only sweeter."
"Medium bodied and drinks smooth and easy like a malty lager should. Very good beer from a behind the scenes brewer. A close to session brew for cooler temps with the 5% abv."
"Medium-heavy carbonation, a bit stinging, medium body. Pretty drinkable."
"D: It was a refreshing and crisp brew that has a body and ABV level meant for a long session."
"D - This is pretty good. It may have been a little too old. I'd like to try a fresher one during Octoberfest."
"Drinkability: A fine, easy-drinking beer. Why, it's schild's play!"
"This brew pours a nice deep amber into my pint glass. The head is off white and suspended in the beer are some small chunks, likely a bit of yeast, as it looked to be bottled conditioned (I dont think it was dry hopped judging by the aroma). Speaking of aroma, the aroma has a moderate-high caramel sweetness, with a bit of toasted character, as well as some dark fruits like raisin and a little spicy hop, a nice nose. The flavor is moderately sweet, has a moderate spicy, toasted malt character, as well as a hint of dark fruit, almost a bit bittersweet. The hop bitterness is moderate and provides a nice balance to lots of malts. The finish is balanced and the beer has moderate carbonation and medium-full body. Overall this was a solid brew. Id drink it again."
"Served chilled, in a half-liter mug."
"Poured a copper/red color with a short white head. No real retention or lacing. Aroma of toasted bread, malty with just a bit of grass. Taste has more maltiness as expected woth some very light hop finish. Clean and light, slightly dry finish. Nothing spectacular, but well made. A great choice for something flavorful but not 'over the top'. I bet it would be great fresh from the tap."
"This is a decent crafted all malt Vienna....very servicable and drinkable"
"Quite a nice beer and one that I could see drinking again."
"Smooth quaffable beer. Certainly not mind blowing in it's complexity or anything. But, it serves it's purpose. I enjoyed sitting down with this one. Wish I had a couple more."
"I think this is a good example of an oktoberfest. It's a bit malty for my own personal tastes of routine consumption, but it's very tasty none-the-less."
"Schild Brau Lager was a clear orange-red color with a small off-white head that quickly faded to a thin layer. The aroma was sweet caramel malt and a little toasty. The taste was sweet toasty malt upfront with some bitterness to balance in the finish. The body was medium with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was above average. It's a decent beer that I have from time to time."
"This is a great concoction. I'm probably going for a record on using the word ""smooth"" too much, but that's exactly what this beer is, and I was so ready for another one. Never have I been so disappointed before about only having 1 bottle. It's ironic I've eaten at the Amanas a hundred times but never visited this brewery. Well that is going to change and I'm putting my mouth on this beer's tap!"
"D - Too many flavors I did not like to try again."
"This one is not overly complex, but is a pretty good marzen nonetheless. Good for a session."
"Worth a try."
"Looks like an Oktoberfest, on the darker side. Flamed malts add distinctive character to nose and taste. Smell a little underwhelming, some grassiness. Taste is very smooth, nothing offensive to the palate, nor particularly stimulating. Light bodied, good spicing from Bavarian hops. Each sip goes down smooth, but I don't think I'll need more than one for now."
"Thanks to Mynie for the trade!"
"Easy to like, hard to deeply love, but a good, sensible, worthy offering. Marzen/Oktoberfest purists may have some issues, but I'd never kick this out of my festival mug."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Glistening caramelized amber. Short, crackling khaki colored head that quickly vanishes leaving only a few stray bubbles. Vibrant carbonation streams pepper the surface with gunshot-like action. The surface moves like smoke across the water. Sweet, glazed apple aromas rise from the glass, but do not drift too far. The taste is slightly sweet with some of the same glazed appley notes present in the aroma. The malt is modestly roasted, with a slightly bittering edge. The hop finish is spicy, but not overly so and it lingers just a brief moment. Medium body with a slightly slick mouthfeel, there is ample but not excessive carbonation. Drinkable, but the malt profile could have been beefed up just a bit to give it a bigger mouthfeel."
"Nice to try, but not worth a second try."
"The flavors are fairly subtle, and lacks any bold flavor whatsoever. The toffee & caramel flavors come out alright, but the hops are lacking and so is the body. Not bad, but nothing worth tracking down either. If this had more ""punch"" to it, it would certainly improve by leaps and bounds."
"Will grab this again."
"."
"Clear copper. Thin beige head. Spotty lace. Aroma is fairly light. Toasted malts and a little biscuit. Body is close to full. There's a good amount of carbonation. Taste is kind of forgettable. Not a lot going on. Some of your basic caramel and toasted notes, light as they may be. And also some sweet sugary kinds of traits. But all in all, it's not doing anything for me. Average...at best."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear dark orange-copper color, nice white foamy head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Has a light flowery and malty caramel aromas, sweet and roasty malts flavors, finishes clean and sweet, medium body, a little thin and semi-watery mouthfeel, an average amber."
"Appearance is weak with a faint head; amber in color. the nose is malty and slighty sweet, with brown sugar undertones. Its light in the mouth and easy to drink. very little taste; malt, and a light sweetness. Although this beer isnt that good, because im in college, i consider it my budweiser when im out with my friends at a party. Its easy to drink and it doesnt taste bad."
"Clear amber/ dark copper color. Faint head, medium carbonation. The smell is weak, just a lightly malty ""beer"" aroma. Taste has a clean, mild, caramel malt flavor. The bitterness is very low. Mouthfeel is light, but coats decently with adequate carbonation. With its mild flavor, and low alcohol, it is an easy drinker, however it lacks any real complexity."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out a dark brown color with a small head. Weak toasted malt aroma. The flavor is nutty malt with some candy sweetness. Grain flavor comes in at the finish. This beer is much too watery. The malt flavor is too weak. I did not detect the sourness that other reviewers have mentioned. There is nothing bad about this beer except that it's boring."
"looks good, and thats about it. avoid."
"Not quite dark enough to be a dunkel, somewhere on the darker end of the ""amber"" range. Almost a marzen, but not substantial enough. A good choice if you're looking for some flavor without having to think too hard about what you're drinking. I'd have another."
"12 ounce twist off bottle, thanks MABZ! 20th anniversary cap."
"I'll have to try drinking some more from different glassware, or even from the bottle itself, but this doesn't seem hardly at all like the beer I remembered. Sure, I remember it tasting like juice compared to BMC, but I don't remember it being overwhelmingly lambic-like."
"Biting grainy aroma, maybe a pinch of malty sweetness. Fine bubbled, cream colroed head. Amber colored beer is mildly hazy. Faintly sweet pale malt flavor rides just above sweet and spicy piney hops. Noticable alcohol flavor is cut by mild bitterness. The beer sweetens up in the end. I wasn't expecting so much hop flavor in a lager, but it was a nice surprise. Body is just on the light side, just right. Flavors stick to your mouth, but the beer is still an easy drinker. This would have been a pretty good beer, but the aroma just killed it. Thanks again to BuckeyeNation."
"I like Millstream. The brewery couldn't be less pretentious; you'll never see a double IPA coming out of a Millstream, but it simply produces great basic beers. This is an unusual Marzen, it comes off a lot more like an amber. It is amber in color with a 1/2 inch head. The flavor's tart, with hints of apple and plenty of toasted malt. It is easy drinking and simply a great beer to have in the fridge. Cheers to Millstream!"
"Taste...sweet and tangy, nutty, fruity, zingy,...big malt, but maybe over-carbonated. Light in the body, but filled with flavor. Easy drinker, good taster, hard to find a fault here. Although it falls somewhere in the middle, at the very least...something I'd have no problem downing were I down Iowa way."
"12 oz bottle obtained from To Your Health (Coralville) in Janurary 2005 and consumed that same evening. Didn't realize I'd already reviewed this one until it had been poured. Freshness date is November. Schildbrau is the pride and joy of Millstream, having won several awards at the GABF. Poured a half-finger head that quickly settled to a ring around the glass. This beer is crystal clear and is a light amber color with a bit of orange. Smell is caramel and water. Really, water. Further sniffing yielded baker's chocolate. Has a smooth clean sweet taste with chocolate and biscuity flavors. There may be some roasted grains beneath. Very drinkable, but not much in depth of flavor. Dry finish, plus I get a slight sour at the end, probably from carbonation acidic. Medium to medium-light mouthfeel. All in all, a decent beer."
"Taste is lightly sweet cookie malt. Pretty clean. A flash of brandy, and then a smooth, relaxed German bitterness takes it into the short finish. Medium-bodied lager, with a little too much carbonation that makes for a fizzy feel. Decent amber lager."
"I had this after drinking a few of the Oktoberfests, and I think that it might have been a mistake. It basically tasted like a nuetered version of that great beer. Still, this is a good lager, and well worth a try."
"Very nice little lager. Nice dark amber-brown body topped by an ok head. Aroma has a touch of corn at the beginning of the aroma, but that fades quickly. A touch of caramel and a hint of sweetness keep this from getting too boring. Very clean flavor, but not too bland. Very drinkable and a nice example of the style."
"Thanks to BUCKEYENATION for the trade.Very nice coppery color.Slight head that quickly receedes.Malty aroma-slight caramel and toasted malt aroma.Great malty flavor-toffee like.Killer residual sweetness.Good body-not too thin like some maerzens can be.Overall a really good beer.Would be a great session beer.Well made."
"Dull deep-amber in color with a semi-lasting layer of rocky off-white head. Sparse glass lacing. Aromas are sorta tough to discern. Roasted malts, some sweetness, and a dash of fruity hops. Flavor also is subdued. Nothing memorable. Some caramel sweetness that only briefly steps aside to let any sort of brisk bittering hops to see the spotlight. Odd undertow of a sourness that I get later on, and it lasts well into the aftertaste. Thin and not overly drinkable. Perhaps I got a bad bottle?"
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for the trade. The beer is a dark copper/amber color with a thin beige head that dissipated rather quickly. Very thin lacing. Lightly malty aroma, with a hint of nuts. Medium-bodied with a flavor somewhere between a Marzen and a regular Amber. There is a tartness under the malt and caramel that made the character seem a little off. However it was still fairly easy to drink. The finish is alternatingly fruity and malty. Overall not an exceptional beer but it is smooth with a nice taste."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep brownish-red with one finger of head that dies down to a small collar quickly. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is malty with toffee sweetness. A slight grassiness and even a touch of cocoa on the nose as well. The taste is rich and full of sweet caramel malt. Some toffee and burnt sugar linger. Touches of hops here and there. Fairly well balanced. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and smooth. The drinkability is great. A really good Marzen."
"Thanks to mentor for the cross border exchange!"
"First sip, medium bodied with average carbonation. Flavor is rather malty with some caramel and a light chocolate hit on the swallow. I even detect a faint sweet fruit presence. No hops to be found. The beer is very crisp and has a clean finish. A tasty beer that is very easy to drink. Thanks Bditty187 for this treat!"
"Pours a medium amber color with a short creamy off-white head that soon fades into a thin lace. Nose is lightly toasted malts and caramel with some faint underlying sour grain notes. Moderate in body and carbonation. Taste begins with sweet buttery toffee along with some light fruity notes followed by some mildly bitter hops. A decent brew though nothing special. Thanks to bditty187 for the sample!"
"Backwash: Whenever I drink a beer like this, I always ask myself, Why in Gods name, would someone local EVER buy something from Bud, Miller, or Coors? This will certainly not blow your doors off, but its a fine, drinking beer. Probably my second favorite of the Millstreams (after the odd Oatmeal Stout). Doesnt really drink like a Marzen/Oktoberfest in my opinion, although it shares some of that styles sweetness and maltiness in a lighter way. Its more like a lightly hopped red/amber ale. Not a beer Id go out of my way to find (as they say in Michelin), but what Id probably be drinking if I were a student in Iowa. Im not sure of the cost, but Im sure this is a good value."
"I'm very experienced with this particular beer, as I've had it on tap at the Amana Colonies (the source) during Oktoberfest 2003, on tap at Old Chicago, and in the bottle from HyVee Liquors in Coralville (formerly Regal). Now, Ambers/Maifest/Oktoberfests are my favorite style of beer, and this is my favorite example overall, so my review might be a little biased and over-high. Great head, moderate lacing, great smell, great taste, goes down easy, lasts a long time. It's strong enough in the winter time, yet not too heavy to drink in the summertime unless I was working outside or something, in which case I'd probably be drinking water or Powerade anyway, not beer. I recommend this to anyone passing through Iowa whether on tap or in the bottle, and the Wheat beer if on tap (wasn't too impressed in the bottle). Great everyday beer."
"Schild Brau is my first beer from Millstream, the only brewery left in the state of Iowa. It's no world-beater, but it's a helluva lot better than similar offerings from the Big 3."
"Clear bronze-amber hue, served with a modest off-white head of a finger in height, it faded to half that size, a loose cap hung together well. No lace was produced. The nose is realty lacking in potency, hard whiffs induce only a trace of toasty-caramel malts and I am making an assumption about that. The palate is decent, toasty malts with a well-balanced addition of hops for a crisp bitterness that cuts the toasty malts just long enough to allow for a caramel note in the finish. There is an odd mineral twang but it is tolerable. This is a solid amber lager. Medium in body, natural carbonation, this allows for an easy drinking beverage. I could session with this but I might get bored after a couple. It is worth drinking if in Iowa, you need not seek it out unless you want a beer from all fifty states. It is a decent beverage and probably the easiest to find from this brewery."
"Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for another hard to find Iowa sample!"
"You may call me prejudiced because Im from Iowa, which doesnt have a major brewing scene, but this is one of the best ambers Ive had. Has a nice malty smell and pours a thick brownish head over an excellent coppery, bubbly body. There's a big caramel and brown sugar maltiness, with the right balance of German hops to keep it from getting too cloying. Won a Bronze at GABF, where it competed as a Vienna, and at the North American Brewers Association where it competed as a Mârzen. Go figure. Just a short detour off I-80 at the Colonies."
"Pours a two-fingered white head that goes slowly and leaves a little lace. Clear amber color. Moderate carbonation. Starts with a good mix of malt and hops, finishes clean but slightly on the sweet side but there are metallic hints. Light - medium bodied."
"A little white head sits on this amber colored body. The smell is of a caramel flavored lager. As for the taste, its pretty good. Similar to some oktobers that ive had, with a little more of a bitter finish in the back. Metallic notes in there as well. Not a bad drink, could be worth your while to try if you run into it."
"Deep red color, medium head. A full-bodied amber. Intense malt flavor, sweet and very robust. Not very hoppy. Good balance. Nice flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and very smooth. Aftertaste is malty and slightly sweet. Very nice beer."
"On the pour, the beer is a translucent deep copper color on the pour with the head minimal in size and frothy in texture, the color an off white with the resultant lace a fine sheet. The nose is malt, sweet; hints of caramel or maple syrup more like it, with the front is sweet and fair in malt; the top skeletally thin. Finish middling in carbonation and the minimal hops spiciness does little to help this beer."
"Dark amber / light red hue and lightly hazy, lacking lager - like clarity.  Thin, but dense off white head leaves sparse lace.  Dry, toasty malt, subdued caramel and fruity sweetness in aroma, w/ trace herbal and spicy noble hops.  The flavor mirrors the aroma, with generic caramel malt sweetness and toasty munich dominating. Non - diacetyl buttery malt notes thankfully add depth and richness only to be downplayed by an overly light body and thin mouthfeel.  Lightly herbal hop flavor.  Finishes lightly toasty, with dextrin pseudosweetness lingering. Nothing outstanding in Schild Brau, but clean and just malty enough for good drinkability."
"I am rating this on the heels of several Great Lakes Eliot Ness'....my premier Vienna.  This one pales greatly in comparison.  Not bad, but well short of stellar."
"Notes: Reminiscent of the Oktoberfest style this turns out to be a great amber lager ... very drinkable and very satisfying. A proud beer to have brewed."
