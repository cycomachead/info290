4.02,7.5,4.5,3.75,4,4,4.25,"The beer pours a bright tangerine color with lively carbonation that sends bubbles streaming to the surface. This one could grace a beer commercial. Perfect, thick white head that falls gradually with lacing all the way to the rim. Impressive. Fruity esters and a buttery malt aroma in the nose. A little bit of citrus and spice from the hops. The flavor is malty, complex and delicious. I think we beer advocates forget just how good this beer truly is. There's just a touch of caramel sweetness, with cereal grain and a well-balanced bitterness in the finish. Hints of orange peel spice and some toffee on the tongue. The body is remarkably fuller than one might expect. I attribute this to a little sleight of hand with the aggressive carbonation. The prickly suds convey a creamy mouthfeel and feign fullness with masterful precision. Nice clean finish that begs for another gulp. At under 5% ABV, this is a powerhouse of flavor and texture. I cannot think of a single small lager that packs as much moxie as the flagship beer from Boston. Still world class in today's glut of aspiring craft kings.","JohnnyI","Dec 29, 2014"

Bought in a quest to find the best beer at my gas station. Between this lager, and sierra nevada's  pale ale. We have a lager winner and a Ale winner. Blue moon belgian white is better than the shock top equivalent. Over all good buy and an excellent buy for the money. Enjoyable and just easy drinking lager. this is something i would keep around. Beats anything else besides the sierra nevada. Over all a 5 out of 5. Excellent quality at a low price. After all, SA started the craft revolution. Considering this is my first craft style lager, its better than all the Bud miller and coors lagers.","Alestorm4069","Dec 08, 2014"

The smell is light, a subtle dry hop smell to it perhaps.  Very easy drinking tastes of a nice light hops flavor mixed with a light citrusy flavor. This is very easy drinking and has a great traditional clean lager taste.  I especially enjoy the lightly dry finish to the sip.  If your looking for something that is quality and easy drinking for a simple night , this is it!","MIchelle","Nov 12, 2014"

It is a great ""transition"" beer, or starter beer, for those used only to the super mass produced stuff and isn't too bold or daring to intimidate most. The beer itself is a shiny amber with a fizzy head that really sticks to the sides of your glass. It's a pleasant yet mild caramel aroma and tastes similarly of sweet malts and caramel with a solid finish, good with or without food and not too strong or weak for sit down to a single bottle or a few. Versatility is yet another one of its many finer points.","ob_carr","Sep 15, 2014"

The taste was much stronger than I was expecting, so much so that it was off-putting.  Consisted of hops on a smoky wood background. The finish was very bitter and gives it a lower drink ability score than most beers in this category. For what this is, it's a decent beer but for the hyped up price, there are better, cheaper options that will provide the drinker with a more desirable experience.","18CGL","Sep 08, 2014"

It has no appreciable nose.  The taste is not something that I like and the body was unimpressive.  Overall this is not a beer I would ever seek out.  Even on a hot day I'd skip this in favor of water.  I guess if this was the only ""craft"" beer at a place that server BMC then I'd go for it.","fscottkey","Sep 04, 2014"

3.5,-6.4,,,,,,"Pours a pretty amber in color with a good 1/2+ finger off-white foamy head. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped that actually leaves some rings even. The aroma is of roasted malts for the most part. The taste is right up front with the sweetness of the roasted malt followed by a very slight hoppy finish. It isn't bad actually and doesn't linger. Even better on draught. Overall a decent beer though many of their seasonal beers are better.","BeerWithMike","Aug 20, 2014"

5,33.7,5,5,5,5,5,"I gotta say i love the hoppy taste and all of the nice flavor of this beer. It is strong. Tastes sweet and very delicious. Fruity Hops to me anyway dominate the experience in the taste. to me its fruity Hops And i get a malt taste. Unlike coors light, which is what i drink all the time, it has a taste to it that is distinguishable. I like this more. It is Something beer geeks could appreciate. I taste the hops, unlike with budweiser or the AALs. The AALs taste like corn and barley and things like that. This tastes Different. Its been a while since i had it but it tastes like caramel malts with hops. Best i've had besides guinness blue moon and Bourbon stouts.","ElijahCraig69","Aug 07, 2014"

This lager beer has an impressive taste, much more going on here with a impressionable, strong mouthfeel and taste. It lingers in your mouth as a reminder that this is not your typical domestic budweiseresque lager. Of all the lighter beers or lagers I have tried, this is one American classic I can always depend on as a quality go to brew.","Gabriel_Vaughn","Jul 08, 2014"

The color is dark gold (not quite amber) and the taste is crisp and refreshing. Sam is a really good macro-micro brew ( a larger brewer who pretends to be small). Imagine 3/4 Sierra Nevada Pale ale, 1/4 spring water. You have a Sam Adams.","cb500rider","Jul 05, 2014"

This Vienna lager might appeal more to the masses looking for something beyond fizzy yellow swill but by no means does that make it any less noteworthy. The skill it takes to create a nicely malty and balanced brew that's a bit lighter with no flaws is what I would call an art. This work of bottled art is delicious on it's own, balancing toasty, bready malts with just enough bitterness but also begs to be paired with pub fare as it's easy going and extremely drinkable.","BeerFMAndy","Jun 19, 2014"

My biggest problem with the beer is that even though it does all the things a good beer should do, it doesn't stand out. It's basic, but basic is good too sometimes.","WhiteHillsStore","May 28, 2014"

The taste is bitter you can taste the hops. Samuel Adams Boston Lager is not like most American style lagers, this brew is much more bitter. There is not much else to say about this brew. It is not smooth ,but it has flavor. If you like bitter beer- then this one is for you. Not my type of brew at all.

I feel like Sam Adams is being slightly down graded from craft brew to mass produced near beer... and i get it. but they do tend to make some nice classics such as this beer here. enjoyable crisp Lager, very sessionable and has a decent complexity with the hop characters. all around a very well performed American Lager. perfect for watching the game, or the summer picnic.","berkshire413","Jan 30, 2014"

Nose was grassy, Noble-hop like in its intensity. My mouth was watering in anticipation. Mouthfeel was full, almost downright creamy in its fullness. I CAN only hope that Jim Koch deigns to begin putting some of his beers in a CAN. Lots of grassy hops on the tongue, making me think of the Gasthaus Waldesruh in ""Cabaret"" - the biergarten where they spent a pleasant afternoon until the Hitler youth began his song. They were putting away a good bit of lager bier, along with brats and pretzels. Say, it's time for a mid-afternoon snack and brats and pretzels would be most excellent with this beer. Finish was clean, hoppy, a very satisfying beer. 1) Why jam it into the Winter Sampler box? and 2) Why CAN't it come in a CAN so that I CAN take it to the beach or school (in my imaginary cooler that I imagine every day in that classroom)?","woodychandler","Dec 17, 2013"

Foamy tall head and strong body. A burst of flavors great for having with any type of food including carmel malt hint, a large diversity of grains including wheat and barley, tastes of yeast that makes it seem like water-bread almost, and even a hint of some citrus (that might just be me). A little watery however. Somewhat hoppy at the end, but not as much as others say. Overall, this beer is the gateway craft beer.","jedijezus","Dec 04, 2013"

Aroma brings a malty sweetness, some sweet fruity notes almost akin to grape, floral hops, a hint of spice. Palate is impressive, there is a downplayed hazelnut richness, a dry but somewhat fruity bitterness like watermelon rind, a sour note that just barely hints at citrus, and the expected toasty malts. Although each individual component is subdued, it all adds up to a malt forward, flavorful, and well-crafted offering that deserves the sometimes grudging respect of craft snobs like myself. A lot better than many import lagers and also widely available. You have to try Sam Adams if you call yourself a lager fan, and you'll be appreciative to boot.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 04, 2013"

It only lacks on the potency of the hops, and the fullness in the mouth. I would highly recommend this beer.

It's a solid beer that goes well with many food dishes and just like the bottle says, it is a well balanced full flavored beer. This is always my beer of choice when it comes to having a beer that I want to drink a lot or with a friend. This is probably one of the most inoffensive beers around for those who want to try out beers outside the generic BMC.","Weston19","Aug 08, 2013"

Oddly, however, and unfortunately, their iconic, flagship beer is one of their least impressive. The main problem is that it is just a little too bitter for the style. I like an aggressively hopped IPA or DIPA, but this beer enters a level of hoppiness that is just a few IBU's higher than it should be for what it is, and leaves me with an unwelcome and unwanted aftertaste.","LukeH","Jun 17, 2013"

3.99,6.7,4.25,4,4,3.75,4,"For this review I will pour a little into a taster, and sip the rest from the can. I will provide a side by side comparison of the two drinking experiences except when it comes to appearance, as the can is not see throughâ¦ From the can the beer pours a crystal clear, amber-orange color with a beautiful head of creamy, medium sized bubbles. The head leaves a lacing of sticky thin lacing that leaves spider webs on the glass. From the glass, the beer graces the nose with a clean, crisp, fresh cut grassy smell with a light biscuit smell wafting beneath the grass and giving a warmth to the nose. From the can, the smell is slightly intensified to provide slight citrusy notes with the grassy hops, alongside slight hints of wet dog and metallic can though those might just be me. The glass has the better smell. From the glass, the beer tastes cleanly bitter with a warming bready sweetness that balances out the beer. Acids are very light in the mouth, only providing a slight wetting to the tongue. From the can the beer tastes slightly sweeter, mellowing the bitters into a more manageable taste. In flavor from the glass the beer begins as medicinal bitters, but quickly blooms into wet, bitter grass with a warm backed biscuit dough and a touch of caramel. The beer finishes grassy bitter with a touch of lemon citrus. The aftertaste is very light with bitter grass. From the can, the taste carries some slight citric lemon from the start, mellowing out the grassy bitters and bringing the caramel malt more onto the palate. Doing this review, I am a little surprised that I am liking the can more than the glass. On the mouth, in the glass, the beer feels on the heavy side of light with a heavier carbonation of fluffy bubbles that blanket the tongue nicely and provide a slight scrub. From the can, the carbonation scrubs the tongue slightly more, perhaps due to the smaller hole. After the beer leaves, the mouth is left slightly damp with saliva. Overall, this beer is quite similar from the can and the glass, which is surprising since I have had several of the cans now, and actually thought it tasted a little differentâ¦ That being said, this is a terrific simple lager with light complexities that make it interesting, while at the same time inviting you to drink more and more. Boston Lager is nearly sessionable, and is a great lawnmower beer in my mind. A true classic.","Maxwell","Jun 16, 2013"

The beer did not ""slide"" as it normally does for me. I will be sticking to bottles in the future.","Yo_Millhouse","May 14, 2013"

Well, tastes change, and after downing my fair share of pale ales and trying a number of beers, I decided to give it another try. I was not disappointed. The hops are clearly present, but really just introduce you to the rest of the beer, instead of overpowering it. Behind that, the mild amount of malt and the rest of the flavors come through cleanly.","Roguer","Apr 11, 2013"

I think there are some reviewers here (in my humble opinion), who forget to do it based on the style of beer.

Aroma is big, with notes of fruit (raisin maybe?), caramel, and little bit of hops. Taste is a little dialed back from the aroma, as those aroma notes are present, but more blended together as opposed to being distinct, as they are in the aroma. Still, a nice flavor to it, with a very slight hop bitterness on the finish. Fairly carbonated and a slightly thinner mouthfeel. A good craft fall-back.","delta490","Feb 25, 2013"

Aroma of biscuit malt, grassy hops and faint light fruit. Flavor follows, biscuit malt with well integrated moderate grassy hops, a hint of pear and apple juice, nuttiness. Nice medium body with light creaminess. A very balanced, pleasant to drink lager. Nothing really stands out here, but the whole lager is in perfect harmony. This makes it clear to me how Boston Beer Company got its reputation.","LiquidAmber","Feb 09, 2013"

Lots of spicy hops and a nice strong malty backbone. The mouthfeel is also quite nice, although there is too much carbonation. The mouthfeel is pretty light as well. Now the bad. Up front, it tastes of stale beer. Off malt flavors intertwine with hop witternes to create, well, I don't know. That dank malty flavor never goes away.... There is about a 4 second window of delectable hops, but then it fades back to the aforementioned stale malt. It was good until I tasted it.","silverking","Jan 10, 2013"
4.18,11.8,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"I had this one in the bottle a few times and never thought much of it aside from the fact that it was an easy-drinker and quite palatable, but once I had it on tap, I was hooked. This one opened my eyes to the fact that a ""lager from America"" can be a very, very good thing. It pours a nice light orange/red with a golden hue (that's how I'd describe a Vienna lager too). It smells of fresh, earthy floral hops and a touch of sweetness. Nice head, great lacing. It teams well with the Sam Adams pint glass it was poured in and it went exceptionally well with my caesar salad and sammy. I had a couple pints of this solid brew that day and have since proclaimed this to be the best American lager on the market today! It doesn't try too hard to be different, it just happens that it is brewed with all malt and no adjuncts. Gee, Big Boys, maybe you should take a hint that even the least educated of palates can tell the difference between your toxic slop and good, all natural and real beer.

Pours slightly hazy golden copper color with a nice 1-2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, pear, apple, toast, bread, floral, light citrus, and light herbal hops. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, toast, apple, pear, light nuttiness, biscuit, cracker, floral, light pepper, and earthy hops. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, light fruits, cracker, biscuit, light nuttiness, floral, and light pepper on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor robustness and balance of malt/hops; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and fairly crisp mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is completely hidden, with zero warming noticed as expected for 4.9%. Overall this is a damn nice vienna lager. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering; and a nice option that is available anywhere.","superspak","Jan 08, 2013"

I thought it was pretty neat to have an American beer accepted for this big fest overseas and really enjoyed it (as I recall). As the years have progressed, I've slipped away from drinking Boston Lager except when it's one of the few bottled or draft beers available at any eating establishments my wife and I visit (there are just too many other new beers to explore these days -- a good ""problem"" if ever there was one). But back to this review -- this is still an excellent lager overall. It's nicely balanced and is a mellow, yet very tasty beer.

True to its label, this beer really is ârich, balanced, and complex.â As a student in Boston, this has served as a reliable fallback option at bars and restaurants when other Sam Adamâs varieties are unavailable. As Mr. Adamâs most popular brew, this lager can be found in almost every seasonal variety pack available from the Boston Brewing Company and its popularity is certainly well deserved.","FratyardVines","Dec 04, 2012"

4.03,7.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"One of the most beautiful beers I've seen, it pours heavy burnt orange with hints of brown and gold. Floating off the considerably thick head, strong pine notes from the Noble hops are followed by a subtle citrus background. On the tongue, milder that the strong hop scent would lead you to suspect, a slight honey sweetness taking the edge off the confident hop bite, and a quick clean finish that leaves you either refreshed or disappointed, depending on your mood. This is a sold beer, not too complex but hitting all the basics, giving a great baseline with which to judge more unique beers if you so choose to experiment, or just a palate cleanser to go with a burger or fish and chips.

4.1,9.6,4,4,4.25,4,4,"Poured a nice clear amber with a thin white head and abundant carbonation bubbles. A good look for a Vienna lager. Scents of grainy malt, sweet, honey malt and some undertones of earthy and herbal European hops. A quite nice aroma profile. Malty with a nice hit of hops, very good. Taste begins with sweet, caramel and honey-like malt flavors, backed by earthy and herbal hop flavors. The hop flavors remain throughout the sip and into the finish and aftertaste. Midway through the sip the hops get a bit more intense but not overly so, still balanced by sweet malt. The finish continues with the sweet malt and hops, but with a little bit more grainy malt. The aftertaste is honey, grainy malt and herbal and earthy hops. A nice flavor profile, very balanced between malt and hops, pleasant to drink. Mouthfeel is light bodied, moderately carbonated, on point for the style, with a crisp feeling. Very good, what a lager should be. Overall this is a good session lager. Its balanced and flavorful, but light enough to not be overwhelming. Its also available everywhere, which is nice. Its a winner.","Auraan","Sep 09, 2012"

Poured a golden yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head that remained throughout the glass. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, earth, earth hop, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, earth, earth hop, and wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I have to give this beer credit as it has definitely done its part with converting people over to craft beer. There is not a huge amount going on here, but it is rather easy to drink and is fairly well balanced at the same time. This fact makes it rather easy to drink and enjoyable for those without a palate for big and bold craft beers. However, if you do have a palate like that this one might not be your favorite. But always remember to give credit where it is due and this one deserves some of that.","thagr81us","Sep 04, 2012"

Now, I still like it, but I realize that it's not the best, even for its style. Prior to the bottle that I am currently drinking, I haven't had this in a while. And it's because I think this beer seriously upsets my stomach. I don't know why. But I guess I will find out if this is still true tomorrow morning...","angrybabboon","Jul 15, 2012"

Pours a clear copper with a beautiful 3 and half finger white head. Some bubbles within the head from the carbonation just adds to the beauty. It doesn't sound THAT spectacular but you must see it for yourself. The smell reminded me a lot of the Latitude 48 IPA, grapefruit, Lemon, Hops, and a whole variety of other scents coming through, Although it was a bit toned down in this brew. Still smelled great. The taste followed the smell, It pretty much reminded me of an easier, slightly lighter version of the Latitude 48. Lots of hops, Lots of grapefruit, And a delicious but very slight sherbert creaminess flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is just as good. The flavors pretty much stay the same, But my oh my is it creamy and delicious. Definitely one of the best beers that I have ever had, If not THE best. Pick up a 6 pack of this NOW","SometimesIfart","Jul 15, 2012"

Pours a solidly clear deep golden color with a fuzzy white head that slowly fades but also leaves some stickage on the glass. Smells of bready and sweet pilsner malts with plenty of earthy and floral hop kick to go around. The flavor is rich and malty with lots of sweet and bready honey like and pilsner malt to go around. Earthy floral and herbal hop flavor cuts through the malt to provide some great balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick sweet resinous mouthfeel. This is a great beer and over the years as my palette has changed its great to see what more I can pick out of this beer. I still think its too hoppy for a Vienna lager, but the hop head in me likes that more now.","johnnnniee","Jul 03, 2012"

Smell carries a nice malt sweetness and good yeasty bread with a lovely spiciness and light leafy hop character. Taste is well balanced with a solid, bready malt core of caramel with a hint of molasses and caramel sweetness. Superbly balanced hop bitterness is an artful combination of florals and spicy but gentle Sazz like notes. Feel is crisp with mildly a carbonated, almost creamy touch. Light enough for sessioning but enough weight to satisfy with one. A great beer in total and one I enjoy again and again. If my drinking consisted of this and a few choice now and thens I would find enough quality, variety, and flavor to be happy.","scootny","May 24, 2012"

Nothing too extreme, but quite pleasant nonetheless. Taste is a smooth balance of light roasted malt, hop spice and lingering bitterness.

3.83,2.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"When in the course of human events it becomes necessary to drink a more perfect beer, one should really start with a Samuel Adams Boston Lager. Back in the dark ages when all you could get at the packie were Buds and Coors and Millers, in rode Sammy A. proclaiming that better beers were coming for the betterment of all humanity. Approachable flavor, classy packaging (I especially like the design of the 22oz. bombers) and an extremely affordable price ($3.25/22oz.!) have likely been responsible for the enlightenment of many a swill chugger. The real treat of Sam Adams, however, is that it takes the lager, the most American of beer styles, and elevates it to a level on par with more evolved styles. Even after all these years it remains a true pioneer and sets a standard that few lagers can match.","Maximusmaximus","May 16, 2012"

I seem to remember this beer as maltier when I've had it in the past, but maybe my palate has changed so much I'm tasting this quite differently than I remember. Not sure. I'll have to try it one more time at a place where I know I can rely up on the quality and see if the beer is different yet again. If it's better - this one is getting deleted as again, something isn't quite right or my palate has really changed a lot since the last time I had this beer.","damndirtyape","Apr 04, 2012"

Smells of malt dominantly and some sweet tones, possibly from hops, but cannot put my finger on it. Tastes of sweet malt with a a little bite of hops, but definitely on the malt heavy side, which is fine for a basic lager, but this one is superiority more flavorful than most American lagers. Carbonation a tad heavy, but not offensively so. Goes down smooth with no bad aftertastes and definitely sessionable. Overall, a very good beer and one of my mainstays when I go to bars with not much selection of on tab beers, as many will have this one.","cyclonece09","Feb 21, 2012"

Sam Adams is interesting to me... some of their beers I find barely drinkable, and others like their flagship beer I think are just solid and decent all around. That being said, I think this beer in terms of appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel is a beer that was responsible for bringing people over to the craft beer side, and I can see why. It's got some hops, but it's not overly aggressive. It has some slight sweetness in the taste. It's well balanced. It is certainly more full then the common American Adjust Lager. Definitely enjoyable and easy to drink.","ely2000k","Jan 15, 2012"

If you haven't tried this beer, ignore the detractors and give it a fair shot.","mrfrancis","Dec 13, 2011"

This pours a nice amber color with nice foamy white held with good retention. The smells are of crisp floral hops and malts. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good, crisp floral hops and a nice malts backbone. This was always one of my early go to beers, and its still good these days even if I don't get it as often.","DavidST","Nov 06, 2011"

Nice firm malty backbone, slightly sassy, with a nice smack of hoppy bitterness. Not trying to prove anything with its medium body this lager has got what it takes to keep my attention.

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Even though I only bought and had the one bottle during my session, this was weak enough in the alcohol department that I could have easily had two or three. I know that Lagers get a bad rap on here since they don't measure up to their stylistic opposites but this beer is as dark, complex, and enjoyable as most Ales on the market. It's not the best beer available on tap as might have been the case when this was new in the 80's but all beer lovers owe a debt of gratitude for the trailblazing role that this brew once had. It's just as good now and still deserves to be considered a classic!","JerzDevl2000","Oct 14, 2011"

When Jim Koch started making this beer, the craft brew revolution was still in its infancy. Mr. Koch bucked the trends and got this beer to the thirsty masses, and the rest was history.

3.85,2.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a 12 ounce mason jar. A vigorous pour resulted in a nice amount of foam that dies down and produces a thin layer of bubbles and residue. The beer is a warm golden-amber color, like autumn leaves. Consistent and clear. Thereâs a sweet maltiness to the nose, not so much hops as malt. This bears out on the palate as well. The carbonation is there, and thereâs a bit of caramel that hits at first, then returns in the finish. Very soft, balanced, and inviting. I am feeling kinda like the guy who stopped listening to his favorite band because it became too popular right about now. The Boston Lager is what it is, and for being what it isâand being so widely distributed (and heavily advertised)âit doesnât disappoint.","elNopalero","Sep 15, 2011"

3.43,-8.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: Hey, if I'm in a place that only has macro lagers, this is probably what I'm getting unless they have Sierra Nevada. Its a great entry level brew that isn't necessarily craft, but it is definitely a crossover into getting beer drinkers to see that one-dimensional macro lagers cheat them out of respecting their beer. :-) However, is it just me or has it gotten progressively worse as Sam Adams has produced progressively more year to year?","paxchristi","Sep 12, 2011"
3.8,1.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Overall, pretty much the gold standard for its style. Good amount of flavour that could potentially bring in drinkers to craft.

Smell is heavy on hops with a undertone of malt. Mouthfeel is very good and easy to drink. Taste is very much like the smell... Heavy hops with malt undertones. Very well balanced. Slight bitterness in the back of the pallet due to the hops, but it's a good bitterness. You could chug these they're so good.","jeffbrister","Sep 05, 2011"
4.17,11.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"O - A very flavorful beer for a lager. Not sure how they got away with calling this a lager really.

It's not great either. IMHO the sensory glass looks great, but gave me the same experience as the mug. I've always been back and forth with Sam Adams brews. However, this is an average brew. If you are into this style and want something with a speciality glass get the Sam Adams. If you want a great brew in this style get the GLBC Eliot Ness. We dont have tons of options here in town, but everywhere I go that has Boston Lager 6 packs also carry GLBC Eliot Ness. Both are considered Vienna style lagers, both are around the same price. Dont get me wrong, Boston lager is a better than decent beer, but the GLBC is world class for the vienna style. IMO that is.","BradtheGreat7","Aug 29, 2011"

Thankfully, this does not apply to the taste. There's a faint noble hops taste with a little malt sweetness, and not a whole lot else. Mouthfeel is exceptional.

4.27,14.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"What is there really to day about this brew. It's what really got me into craft and a solid offering at most places that carry only bmc. It sure is a looked with a nice amber color and fluffy two finger head. Smell is very floral and inviting. Nice malt profile up front with a subtle hop flavor that comes around after a while. Mouth on it is almost perfect for the style and is velvety smooth all the way down. Overall you know this beer and probably have had your fair share but its always welcome in my home.","brobeerbot","Aug 13, 2011"
3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, this is an eminently drinkable, finely-balanced beer in many ways: first, it finds a nice ratio of hops to malt, skimping on neither but also neither letting the flavors get out of hand; and second, it manages to find a nice middle-ground in the larger panoply of beers, easily staying away from the water-like qualities of, say, Anheuser-Busch, but avoiding the harsher, polarizing palates of, say, Unibroue. Yes, there are those who think Samuel Adams doesn't make anything decent, but there *is* a reason why their beers ""have won more awards than any beer in history"" (as per their website).","jondeelee","Aug 13, 2011"

Taste is malty with some citrus kick, grassy at points, light hoppy finish and fairly clean all around. Good feel, medium carbonation, medium body. Really nice lager, full flavour and quite enjoyable.","peensteen","Aug 11, 2011"
3.9,4.3,4,4,4,3,4,"Iced-tea colored pour with an off white head. Plenty of fuzzy bubbles. More hops in the nose than expected. Definitely more floral than citrus/pine (nice for a change). Malt smells sweet w/o a lot of distinction other than a hint of Grape Nuts. This sample is the first where I detect an estery component that seems a little out of place. Can't call it a flaw though. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, and a bit to the beer's determent. A tad more body would be perfect. Still not bad. Finishes like not quite burnt toast.","specksnreds","Aug 07, 2011"

Taste was cereal grains, yeasty, something that played at hops, and overall completely non-descript and generally weak. Overall this is a completely middling offering. Drinkable certainly, if you have nothing better to do and some on hand.

The notes here are slightly toasted malts with a smooth hop bitterness that is pronounced but not at all overpowering. There's a slight sweetness that nicely balances this bitterness.

3,-19.8,3,3,3,3,3,"I first want to start out by saying that many great beer companies put out much better product and don't pump their advertisement every couple of minutes because...they don't need to, the product sells it self. I maybe a bit bias on this review because I had been putting off trying it for so long. But you can only go to your local store so many times and buy the greats before you need to branch out. After feeling a little bold I picked up a sixer with my buddy. This brew pours clear amber color(let me quickly say that it looks darker on tv haha), small bit of froth, no lacing. Smells sweet, malty. I taste some caramel in the body, sweet and simple, but balanced just like the commercials say. In the mouth it feels like a bit like soda...Not bad for what it is, but it is way over priced.

3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The taste is hoppier than most lagers, but not enough to stray from the style, nor turn away those not quite accustomed to hops. Some slightly toasty malts round out the flavor and put a nice bow on the whole experience. There's a lightness and refreshing quality to the mouthfeel and the crispness of the hops, but it still remains full-bodied and pleasant. Best when fresh, of course, but great for any season. It's just one of those great beers that got so many people into beer that has quality ingredients and better taste than most macros, despite how big BBC gets.

It would be very cliche but I'll say it anyways, Boston Lager changed my life forever. Review #200, a special one here.","Duff27","Apr 19, 2011"

The taste was very fresh and crisp on the palate and very different from bottles of Sam that I have had. The floral hops started the palate experience that slowly faded and was nicely balanced by the mild maltiness. This brew finished very nicely. The mouthfeel was crisp and refrehing. Overall I am aware that after drnking water over the past couple of days of hiking and camping this beer deficately had an advantage but can you really go wrong with a Samuel Adamas Boston Lager.

4.5,20.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The biggest difference between bottle and tap with this beer is that the roasted bready malt comes out a bit more richer than usual and the hops of course are bit brighter and citric in taste and bitterness. The drinkability is awesome on this and the alcohol content is just right plus its hidden real well with the sweetness and malt profile. This is probably one of my favorite malt profiles in any beer. I've tried quite a bit craft beers and this one is still an amazing example.","thebrood1987","Apr 13, 2011"

The golden straw transitions to orange as it nears the thick cream coloured 2 fingers of head. I get alot of spice on the nose and some herbal, grassy and pepper flavours.

Served in a Weisse-vase, it's an amber-gold color with a nice, thick white foamy head that slowly recedes as the beer sits. A malty aroma with the slightest hint of hops on deeper inspection. The beer gives you a malty-caramel sweet flavor with very slightly bitter hops right behind it for balance, and also a slightly peppery characteristic at the end.

The beer starts off malty, moves to sweet and finish's dry as you swallow. The dryness leaves you wanting to take another sip! This Vienna Lager has some hop bitterness which is more then I can say for most lagers. This is a lager that is very drinkable yet has some character.

It's sweeter or I guess more floral-y tasting than I thought it would be, which caught me a bit off guard, but I can't say anything negative about it.

This is especially true at busy restaurants where this beer seems to sell well and stays fresh. The copper color is inviting and again, the hops keep this beer refreshing, the perfect foil to greasy burgers and deep fried food. There is enough malt and sweetness to make drinking a breeze.

Almost every bar worth visiting will have this on tap, so I'll always have something to drink when I go out with friends. There is a reason this beer is popular.

The nice balance of caramel and malt gives the aroma and flavor a nice 1-2 combo. There is a wonderful toasted aroma and flavor that goes along with this beer.

The flavor is really smooth but not a lot going on. Some caramel maltiness and sugary biscuits. Mouthfeel is nice. Very good smooth flavors round out a mild hop balanced bite. Drinkability is a perfect 5 and really a perfect session beer, not by definition but by intention of drink at least a 6er of these.","Augustiner719","Aug 23, 2010"

I immediately catch a whiff of the malts in the forefront, though some floral notes are detectable. Taste is very crisp and clean, the hop flavours are slightly more prevalent in the taste, but the malt backbone is still the star here. Feels great on my tongue, with adequate carbonation and not being too this as many in this style attempt to do, so as to have more in common with the Macro competition. Sam Adams is the perfect ""gateway beer"" They make well done craft beers that are easily accessible, reasonably priced, and almost always delicious.","jamiesessions","Aug 21, 2010"

The lager has a sweetness up front & crisp dryness on the finish with a definite hop presence.

That being said, I intend to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its brews revival, (the original recipe dates back to the late 1870s) from bombers on several more occasions, so further elaboration of this review will subsequently take place. Its appearance grand, pleasing to the eye, a faint amber, bubbly, with good white head, just like sea foam from the shore. It smells fine, slightly hoppy, nothing overbearing, almost sweet, very good. And the taste oh, how crisp and refreshing, its what defines a lager. The mouthfeel, crisp, that drinkability above and beyond. Great choice from a bottle, always a fine option on tap, you really cannot go wrong with this fellow, its a stand by fine fine choice.","Saint","Apr 11, 2010"

However, don't let that detract from this beer. It's good. Pours a clear amber. Mix of floral hops and toasted bready malts. Taste is much of the same. It's good and sessionable with the low ABV.

Actually much sweeter and fruitier smelling than I seemed to recall. Flavor has the same white grape sweetness with some toasted malts thrown into the mix on the midpalate. Lightly grassy hops and a mild floral finish. Maybe a bit simple for a lot of BAs, but all in all I feel this is an extremely solid brew. Probably more interesting than the ubiquitous ""amber ale"" I see at so many microbrewers Medium body with a nice medium carbonation that matches the crispness and light fruity flavors. Extremely solid, I actually will probably start to buy this when I am at places with a limited selection. Glad I revisited this, easy to see why Boston Brewing.

I've enjoyed it for so long both on tap and bottle but never taken the time to review it and finally took the time to do it tonight. Had it poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, pours a light amber color with a decent sized head that will go away after a few minutes in the middle but sticks around on the edges with some good lacing to it as well. Oh yeah, and perfect clarity, absolutely perfectly filtered. It smells very good, very well balanced between roasted, caramelized malts and, with great hoppy floral aromas at the end. Excellent full bodied, and perfectly balanced flavor of again the malts followed by a hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good not much of a carbonation bite to it. You can really taste the sweet in the beginning and the bitter part at the end. Its full bodied, but I still find it very drinkable. Just a good overall beer. I'll put a disclaimer on this, it said drink by 11/09 and it's July right now, so you know this beer was EXTREMELY fresh. Glad I got a hold of it before anyone else.

Quite simply you can always know that you have a beer that you can drink in nearly every Pub or Restaraunt from coast to coast. This brew never disappoints. It is best drunk from spring through autumn at a temperature between 40-45 degrees F. but unlike the big 3 and many other middle of the road lagers, it still tastes excellent even when it gets closer to room temperature, a rarity among any lager or pilsner. It has a pleasant hops aroma and maltiness is predominant in the flavor rich with caramel and vanilla tones. overall a solid inexpensive lager.","bill93063","Jun 18, 2009"

However, I just had this beer on tap in a plain pint, and I have to admit that neither the taste nor the smell of the hops was nearly as good. In the Sam glasses, the color is lovely, and the column of bubbles coming up from the center looks nice. More important it keeps a small head and aroma from beginning to end. The dry hopped Hallertauer hops are very nice, and the bitterness nicely matches the sweetness of the Vienna style malt. Just wonderful.","DudleyRose","May 23, 2009"

I have to tip my hat to Jim Koch and his team for a job well done. Like many I'm sure, I first discovered Sam Adams in the early eighties along with a few other craft beers, and then began seriously sampling from there. Since then I've tried many different and amazing beers from all over the USA and the world. I recently decided to buy a case of Boston Lager on a whim, because i couldn't find anything else interesting I hadn't tried at the store i was in. I was really amazed at how much i actually enjoyed this beer. I have definitely bought more expensive "" high quality micro brews"" in the past that were not better than this mass produced lager.

However, it has a few misgivings that make it near the bottom of my list of beers I'd buy and keep on hand in my home. It is too sweet a beer, i dont know if that is indicative of all Vienna lagers, or just this one, but its too sweet. Carbonation is also a bit overwhelming, especially when its too cold, which is why you need to drink it at 40- 45 degrees, not the crazy freezing temperatures they would normally serve it at bars. That being said, this beer broke the way for commercially acceptable ""good"" beers. It deserves a place in history for that. A really good brew, not great, but good.","rodney45","Mar 20, 2009"

A bit hazy, perhaps showing its age, but probably chill haze. Aroma was a bready malt with a hint of orange, still quite pleasant. Taste began with malt sweetness having a hint of caramel.

A good balanced smell between all flavors as nothing really sticks out to me. Enters your mouth and the smell is what you taste, and it is a medium thickness which results in a medium drinkability.

Little bit of caramel present. Medium body and refreshing. Not the biggest beer nor the most complex. This leads it to be a bit thin, but a very easy drink.

Clean and bready with a slight tang. The taste is equally firm and bready with a modicum of firm, earthy bitterness that carries through to the finish and marries well with the light sweetness of the malt and gets support from the firm baked bread flavors. Very well balanced and well made. This is more than just a ""gateway"" beer for emerging beer aficionados, this is a solid beer in its own right that plays not at all to the lowest common denominator.

I always notice when the beer's water characteristics seem separated form the rest of the beer.

The hoppiness makes the beer, very strong hop flavor. Carbonation is present but not overwhelming. The strongest point of this beer is its availability- without it we'd be stuck with the token light beers at most mainstream restaurants. As a beer alone, I'd rank it in the lower threes. However, the Boston Beer Company gives me hope yet for macros- they have marketing on par with the watery, fizzy ""light"" crap produced by Coors, Miller, and Anheuser-Busch, but make a solid product that American beer drinkers can be proud of.

Body is solid, although nothing too impressive. Might have to experiment a bit more, but is seems possible that I prefer this one on tap, although it's certainly a solid brew (and better than all the BMC out there in a landslide) in the bottle as well.","soupyman10","May 23, 2008"

Bouquet of floral hops dominates with a wheat backbone. Taste similar to nose culminates in a clean, crisp finish with just a hint of wheat left lingering on the tastebuds.

Mouthfeel is a medium fullness. Overall, a very good beer. This is very much deserving of it's iconic status in the craft world. I can't understand why so many people want to put this beer (and the others in the Samuel Adams family) down. Why?? Because it's become so successful & mainstream? Because it's gone from a small, one man operation to a high volume player in the beer world, thereby becoming ""too big & macro-like""? Bullcrap!!! If the boys at the big 3 brewed something this good, the beer world would be 10 times better off!!! Give this brew, & this compamy, it's proper respect!!!","CJfromPhilly","Jan 29, 2008"

A creamy, heavy type body that fills the mouth, this can be a session beer but a few can fill you up. In this case that's a good thing, because I am using that phrase not to slam this beer but slam other beers that it takes a 12-pack to maybe break the seal.

Pours a deep gold almost amber with a decent head that diminishes to a thin layer. A decent amount of sweet malt comes through even as the glass gets less full, but there's not much else to the aroma besides sweet malt. The taste is more of the same, with some citrus hops poking through from the background. The beer is light bodied and very crisp, but that does not make up for the lack of flavor. While I will admit, the glass does bring out more from this beer than I have noticed in the past, there still isn't that much to it in my opinion.","atsprings","Oct 16, 2007"

I very much enjoy its aroma, very strong without overpowering. although it goes down smooth, it's definitely not a chugging beer.

Under sober conditions, I've found that the 12 oz. bottle pours out an attractive head. Nothing fancy, quite simple in appearance. The smell is strong spices and hops. The taste is quite good, reminds me of real earthy tones and spices, with a good blend of hops. But just like when I was hammered, this brew was filling as all hell. Quite thick and dense for a lager and really makes it hard to go through too many. Overall, I don't think this is Samuel Adams' best brew.

Taste is full flavor that did not let me down. You can really taste the hops and a slight bitterness that blends together perfectly.

Great lacing. Nice signs of carbonation edging up from the bottom of the glass that kept chugging along even after a few minutes. In fact, they were still slipping up at the bottom of the glass. [N.B. This is without the new Sam Adams glass.] Smells initially of peach and caramel together (the fruit is light) with some hops backing up. Sweetness (but not oversweet) in the taste comes off like a combination of vanilla and light brown sugar. Hops fill in toward the end and in the aftertaste. Great creaminess to this and moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. While IÂve enjoyed Sam Adams for a while, IÂve never actually reviewed the Boston Lager until now. Two things strike me: first, itÂs good to remind myself that lagers can have a depth of flavor (macro-lagers do lagers a disservice).

Flavor is fairly subdued with hints of malts and a bit of light citrus. Body is light to medium with a heavy dose of carbonation. Leaves a bit of a hoppy aftertaste that is not present during initial consumption. A good session beer, but nothing more.","mdm46410","May 28, 2007"

Taste is pretty good I can taste a bit of bread and also some roasted barley and malt in the mix also a bit of bisquit that makes me quite hungry.

This vienna lager pours amber, a very rare style in American craft brewing, but seems taken for granted of late. The aroma is alone in the beer world as it is an unforgettable recipe of noble hops. The taste is of balance, but when paired with food the caramel flavors work well with seared, grilled or roasted meats, fish and vegetables. The noble hop aroma and dry finish act as an herbal finish, thus complimenting anything from the main course to side dishes. In the New England area Sam Adams lager is found everywhere from sub shops to chinese restaurants and Italian restaurants and is established in many restaurant chains. In my experience this beer has even saved many dull meals that would not have been as enjoyable if I didn't have Sammy to wash it down. A Boston, New England, American, and now world classic.","mshallah","May 18, 2007"

The beer still has the same smell and the pour is reasonably heady. The body is medium and color is still amber. The taste is different. I remember it as having a lot more balance, a lot less molasses/caramel malt flavor, and just more interesting hopiness. The aftertaste is also sweetish malt and caramel. It is just too imbalanced and overpowering for my tastes. Blah ... this is a beer I will only drink if it is around and nothing else is available, which is usually at cookouts and the like. It's okay, and I barely recommend it, hence the scores of 3, but it is barely squeeking by, and it might be for nostalgia's sake that I don't sink this one into the thumbs down category.","albern","May 12, 2007"

Maybe because it is simply a plain ol lager, a higher quality version of the stuff you bought in college.

The first sips of this beer produce a bread and toast-like flavor that is blended with some caramel sweetness and rounded out with a noble hop flavor. There is some bitterness to the finish, which is nice. As the beer warms up by mid-bottle, the hop flavors come out even more and have just as much presence as the malt.

You can't go wrong with this one. Very well balanced when it comes to hops/malts so it doesn't offend those who feel a beer is too heavy or too bitter. ABV makes it very sessionable.

The bitterness was medium, and the beer was fairly smooth and easy to drink. Thee carbonation was medium for this beer.

The taste is nicely hoppy too, for a mass produced american lager the hoppy flavor is great, almost reminds me of a good pale ale, the hop flavor settles nicely on the tongue.

As for the tiny breweries, I have tasted some brews this good, but they were few and far between. This is the first beer I have ever given a 5 rating on taste.

This beer pours a clear light amber color with a one inch head that dissipates slowly. The smell is malty, with a pleasing aroma of hops wafting from the glass. Taste is also malty and sweet, with a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. This beer leaves a slight citrusy aftertaste in my mouth that blends well with the sweetness of the malt. I don't think this beer's character has changed at all over the years. Jim Koch continues to brew this beer as tasty as it was nearly 20 years ago.

Crisp, robust noble hops combine with the lager's inherent snappiness to create a rather enjoyable, drinkable beer. There's still enough malt to provide some beef to go along with the hops but I feel that hop character is really what can seperate bottled Sam Adams from its draft counterpart. One slight knock, however, is that I feel this brew is just a tad overcarbonated, most likely to appeal to the expectations of the larger beer-drinking market.","VoodooBrew","Feb 03, 2006"

4.6,23,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"This is another of my favorite brews. Nothing unique here. Just a good lager that's really been done right. I've had this both on tap and in the bottle, but I chose a draft beer for this review because for me the draft works pretty well with this beer. The appearance is a rather dark tan, this is probably the darkest lager I've seen. The head is usually moderate but well formed and stable. I seem to recall this beer being pitched by floating the bottle cap on the head. Anyway appearance is pleasant and beerlike but not the least bit unusual. Really the color is just about typical of the beer I usually drink. Only the head is a little different, being a bit longer lived. Smell is also straightforward. Its a hearty mix of (surprise!) yeast and malt. Definately some caramel too, and in spite of the strength of the smell its still a very clean smell. As with pretty much every beer I've ever had, the smell was reflected in the taste. This is a relatively rich, sweet brew that is balanced by a strong hop presence. The famous ""two row barley"" (Boston Beer Co likes to remind you this is a high quality and expensive ingredient, but damned if I know its exact significance) makes for malt flavor that's deep and rich, but still very clean. The hops are one of my favorites ever. They provide a perfect balance, and though they're strong and pretty bitter they are also quite flavorfull and the bitterness does cross the line to become what I consider excessive. However, they don't suggest any specific ""notes"" that I can think of, just hops. In case you're as big a fan of the hops used in this beer as I am, samualadams.com tells me they are ""German Noble aroma hops"". Mouthfeel is a little on the thick side, but usually does not inhibit the drinkability. Sometimes a Sam Adams is exactly what I feel like, and then its really a beer to be savored. Sometimes it turns out to be a good session beer for me, other times it weights on me after a glass or two and I have to switch to something lighter. While Yuengling Traditional is my top favorite, this is one of my favorites. To me its sort of like Yuengling's older (in style, obviously not the age of the brewery) and heartier cousin. It has a bit more depth than Yuengling, and its thicker. Sometimes this is just what I'm craving, sometimes Yuengling's even easier flavor and superior drinkability make me reach for it first. Anyway, as many other people will probably tell you, there's nothing this isn't complicated, it isn't fancy, its not exotic. Its just a hearty lager that they took the time to really do right. If I had to offer a lager to a more experienced beer drinker who tends to turn his/her nose up at Lagers in general because they're too wimpy and don't have enough flavor I'd probably go with this even though its very unlikely I'd be broadening their horizons any.","casualbeerman","Dec 31, 2005"

The taste is somewhere between a quality light beer and a red beer. The mouthfeel is exceptional. No bite whatsoever. As a result, I could drink these all night. This would certainly be a session beer. I think a 12 of these will come along with me in a couple weeks to the annual New Year's Eve bonfire.

Fairly well balanced in my opinion and I could not find much I didn't like about this beer.

I poured the lager into my Sam Adams pint glass, and noticed a very golden-like hue. At the top of the glass formed a very nice white head, which stayed througout my drink. The nose of the beer was full of fruits and some nice maltiness. The taste of the beer wasn't as good as the smell. I was expecting more of a sweeter taste, however, seemed a little bland with a little spice at the end. The mouth feel was average, and of course the drinkability is quite high.

Anyway, I opened the bottle and sniffed the beer. It has a sweet, flowery aroma and I then poured a little into a clear glass. It pours a reddish-amber type color with a brownish head that stayed there for a long while. I then tasted it. Wow, my relatives were wrong! I liked the mellow, sweet taste of Sam Adams. The taste was kinda nutty in the middle of the sip, and left a clean, crisp bite at the end of it, and the aftertaste was a little hoppy, then mellowed a bit.

Not quite transparent copper colored beer with very little carbonation activity. Mildly sweet caramel/butterscotch and toasted malt flavor is enjoyable and balanced by some mildly bitter hops midway though. The bitterness drops back towards the end and the original flavors make a faint reappearance. Body is moderately light, and the mouthfeel is a bit fizzy in the middle, but generally soft.

The flavor is very good with an excellent balance of light malt flavor with floral hoppy flavor. The malt profile is not bready in nature, but more crisp and sweet.

Good mouthfeel. Samuel Adams is kind of maligned in that they aren't really a micro, but they make a solid product that is way better than BudMillerCoors and the ""imports"" like Heinekin.

IÂm actually getting sheets of lace down the side of the glass and the head retention is pretty great as well. The nose is sweet toffee and biscuity malts with a faint sprinkling of earthy bitterness about the edges. As I swallow the first thing I notice is this is quiet a bit sweeter than I remember it being. Nice round toffee flavors up front accompanied by a mild fruitiness, the middle is grainy (in a good way) and is eventually accompanied by a well-balanced earthen bitterness in the finish.

It shouldn't win any best of show awards either, but the fact that it is a decent beer in a market of fizzy yellow beers is something of merit. Quite sweet, hops are subtle, there are certainly no bold Czech hops here. Strawlike and sweet, then dry on the aftertaste.

The taste is smooth and a little sweet at first, followed by a hint of dry bitterness when swallowed. The body is very full and malty.

Taste is a nice balance between malty sweetness and a fairly decent helping of hops in the middle. Finishes a semi-dry with hop bitterness lingering. Very good overall. Mouthfeel is a tiny bit thin due to notable carbonation, but still very pleasant. Drinkability is probably the strongest suit for this offering: well balanced and flavorful without going overboard in any particular area. This is an excellent beer that opened my eyes to a wider world many years ago. Probably never going to make the top of the lists, but a solid beer for any occasion and worthy of a place in your refridgerator!","niknar","Dec 07, 2004"

After being attacked by bubbles, the taste is dominated by bitter hops and a little bit of toasted notes. At the end, the bitterness lingers as does the carbonation. As with all the Sams I've had, a helluva decent beer for such a large brewery. But, I wouldn't get it again until I start to like this style.","aquatonex","Dec 06, 2004"
3.8,1.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a light golden color, which is very clear. Light shoots through the beer without any problem. A fairly thick rolling white head forms as the swirling carbonation rushes to the surface. A nice flowery aroma wafts up gently from the glass. A firm maltiness is shoulder to shoulder with the hops aroma. The hops embrace your tongue immediately, but quickly take a back seat to the semisweet maltiness. Now there's a slight caramel taste. This bit of sweetness fades into a nicely hopped finish, which is softly bitter. The aftertaste is refreshingly dry and on the bitter side. This is an easy drinking lager that will always have a special place in my heart. It's not the best beer out there, but like so many others, it was the first craft beer I ever drank regularly. For that, I'll always appreciate it and there will always be room for it in my fridge. It doesn't hurt that it's very tasty!","Hagbard","Dec 02, 2004"

Either way, I revisit it often and enjoy the beer immensely. It pours a nice amber color and has the trademark thick foamy head that you can float a bottle cap on. The aroma is a truly great mix of noble hops, Hallertau Mittelfruh and Tettnang Tettnanger, and wonderful sweet and malty. The flavor is every bit as good as the aroma and the floral hoppiness is in the forefront and the heavy sweet malty backbone melds the experience into a mind blowing taste nirvana...

It certainly isn't earth-shattering amazing, and it definately isn't anything close to awful. It's just good. A great beer to sit down with and drink four or five. Perhaps more. The taste has an ""allowable"" (to me) amount of hoppiness. Nice balance. There is a nice, almost dry, maltiness at the finish that I really enjoy. I would have to say this and the SA Light is to me what, dare I say, Bud and MGD are to most everyone else in the USA.

Finished not horribly with a nice hop taste but still stale and bland. I think it could be a lot fuller in the mouth.

It pours a clear, golden amber with a respectable, offwhite head that retains well before fading into patches and a few sheets of nice lace. Aroma is the low point, with a malty grain nose, and a hint of pine hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. There is a very pleasant feel of pine hops in the back of the mouth, toward the finish, that earns good marks here. Taste is well balanced, dominated by a caramel malt taste, some grain, a bit of pine cone, and even a hint of grapefruit. Supremely drinkable, with an enjoyable aftertaste of slightly bitter hops that even out the malt sweetness. Nicely crisp all the way through. A fine session lager.","merlin48","Mar 15, 2004"

Appearance was pretty good, with a healthy foamy off-white head that left a bit of lace. Light honey color. Aroma was light, a bit corny, not too much hops. Flavor was also pretty light, and unimpressive. Not much balance or character. Very faint light malt, teeny bit of hops, perhaps a bit of sweet corn and honey. Some cinnamon lingers, but a faint acrid note emerges in the finish.","far333","Sep 14, 2003"

Taste is a bit unusual, and it's maybe a bit hoppier than I'd like, but that's a personal preferance thing.

I believe it was the first ""good beer"" I had tried, and it did not disappoint me then as it does not now. The beer pours a clear deep red/light brown with a nice fluffy white head. The smell is of floral hops, a highly drinkable blend that Sam Adams is known for. The hops are present, not in the fashion of a pale ale, but moreso than in other lagers. There is a good malt base that gives this beer more prescence and a more fulfilling feel. Although I've branched out and found true happiness in the world of microbrews, I still enjoy a nice big steak with a tasty Sam Adams on occasion.","99bottles","Jul 18, 2003"

Pours out a good looking clear light amber, small foamy head, and some decent lacing. Nose consists mainly of floral hops, a bit of malt behind it. Flavour primarily spicy hops, some sweet malt to back it up. Creamy mouthfeel, but the whole deal seems to bite on the way down, doesn't sit well. Best before mark on the label says it's alright, yet I can't see this being a regular of mine, given the caustic side effects.","IronDjinn","Jul 15, 2003"

The aroma of the hops in this beer are good. You can taste the malt character, and the beer finishes very clean. This is a good beer to have around for your macro friends, because if they don't drink it all, you won't mind having it around.

One of my favorite fallback beers, mainly because its available almost anywhere I go. The beer itself is very good, pours a nice copper color, with good carbonation and a thin white head, with a nice hop and spice smell. Hops and carmelized malts seem to be the most present flavors, with a hint of spicyness, and a very very small hint of fruit. The brew finishes very dry, and leaves you wanting more. Overall, for being so widely available, this beer is an excellent choice when the alternative is bud or coors. It is a mass produced beer that actually has flavor.","usualpulp","Jul 08, 2003"

The beer produced a decent head, white in color and semi lasting in nature. It was fluffy and sticky which was evident in the lace that it left behind. The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet malt, caramel, flowers, hops and a hint of citrus. The flavors were exactly the same, sweet malt, caramel, hops, citrus (light) and flowers. It left a semi hop finish that was light and semi dry. An all around smooth and quaffable beer, it is very easy to drink. A good staple to have around because of its balanced flavors, aromas and drink ability. A must for all those who want to step into the craft world.","Jarod","May 31, 2003"

An aroma of malt and slight touch of hops is also present with some grain elements. A flavor of malt and caramel. The finish is light with a touch of tang to it. Lagers have ceased to be my beer of choice but in my old Bud days this beer easily would have replace it.

Before Sam Adams I was not a beer drinker so I give credit to Jim Koch for introducing me to good beer. Although I no longer drink this one that often, I did have one with dinner the other night at a restaurant. On draught, clear light amber with very little head and only slight lacing. Decent hop presence for a lager but a little too watery which obscured the malt flavor I was looking for. I've been to the brewery in Jamaica Plain MA many times in the past, and I know what Boston Beer is capable of.

This is my choice when I'm at bars who have a shitty selection and think this lager is the best that they can supply. I love the darker appearance it has compared to any other beer you would drink at said bars. This is my sentimental value me talking now. But anyways, it has a wonderful balance, malty more in the start with a nice hop kick in the finish. And it's very refreshing and perfect for all night sessions. I have gone broke many a night spending 4 dollars a bottle on this stuff from 11pm-2am nonstop. But in all honesty, this beer was the very beginning of my crossover into ""craft beer world.""

4.3,15,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Clear, copper in color forming a beautiful sticky head atop small to medium-sized bubbles with excellent retention and lacing. Thick clusters of foam sit atop the head when it thins. Aroma is rich and satisfying with aroma of floral noble hops, pure water, roasted grains, and pale and amber malts. Fermentation is clean without much fruitiness aside from the hops. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Mouthfeel is excellent...soft, easy to drink, with a slightly dry finish making you want more. Taste begins with floral dry-hopped flavor with pleasant, balanced intensity...pale malts and what appears to be caramunich malts fill up the middle with a nice maltiness that balances out the excellent bittering hop finish. There is a very nice cookie-like sweetness towards the middle which nicely complements the bittering hops, reminding me of Rogue Dead Guy Ale. There is a subtle hint of chalk and husken grains towards the end with a smooth and soft mouthfeel. This is an excellent go-to beer that is reliable, easy to find, easy to drink, and has been a staple in my fridge for the last 10 years.

Aroma consists of a full malty almost bready aroma with a subtle hop aroma that diffuses very well into my senses. The hop aroma presents a slightly piney very aromatic aroma. Taste is predomanitely a buttery malt sweetness balanced by the bittering hops with a very solid all around good and refreshing flavor. Very smoothe mouthfeel that has a silky texture found in this medium to light bodied classic amber lager. I'm glad that Jim Koch found ol' gran dad's recipe, this beer has been the backbone of the Boston Beer Company.

I suppose it depends on the setting as to which one I would prefer, but these days, with two kids and seldom an opportunity to sit down and enjoy a beer, the Lager gets the nod.

Body is thoroughly on the thin side, and not 1/3 through the pint I'm feeling awfully bored. Not enough of what I like in a beer, but then I don't normally drink this style.

The taste is more malt than hops in my book with some sweetness despite the citrus smells. There is a hoppy finish, with an aftertaste of something sweet that I could not place (caramel? molasses?).

The hops flavor and slight bitterness are what make this beer for me. It makes it so much more interesting than other American lagers. It seems like I don't quite get the full hops flavor in many of these. The only reason I can think of is out of date beer. This one seems to have retained freshness. Leaves a nice ringing aftertaste of sweetness rather than the sour taste many lagers leave. Not a bad option when microbrews aren't around.

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a clear amber with a nice foamy head about an inch thick. Aroma consisted primarily of hops. Taste is light bodied, but flavorful. Not much up front, but then a toasted flavor is introduced in the middle. Finish has a touch of bitterness and light caramel, followed by a pleasing return to a toasted hop finish. I tried this out of the Winter Classics sampler pack and I have to admit that this was one of the freshest tasting bottles of Sam Adams Boston Lager that I have ever had. Sam Adams was one of the first beers during the microbrew revolution in the mid 90's to get me to convert over to micros.","Winter","Nov 20, 2002"

Head poured is fluffy and it leaves a nice trail of lace down the glass. The bubbles of carbonation are tiny but produce a small head that lasts throughout the glass. Fragerance is balanced with a trace of hops. Flavor is good; its well balanced with mellow carmel-like malts with a nibble of hops that hits the tip of the drinkers tongue. Very pleasant brew to drink. Not my favorite, but a beer that I enjoy alot none the less.","allboutbierge","Nov 17, 2002"

Straight from a Sam Adams sampler case, the bottle poured a nice golden color with just the right amount of head and subsequent lace on the glass. An enticing malty scent greeted my nostrils, and the taste was everything I look for in a finely balanced, pure amber lager. A slight fizziness on the tongue was complemeted by a filling, creamy mouthfeel. This lager is very drinkable...luckily the sampler only had 6 in the case, or I'd be in trouble! Very enjoyable beer, and its reputation is well-deserved.","SchmichaelJ","Nov 11, 2002"

Floral and slightly spicy hop character, a bit oily. Some would say metallic, but I would attribute this to the hops. Malt is again sweet and grainy, a great character. Exceptional balance and a great malt and hop pairing. Flavorful medium body that almost seems like a full body. Sweet and hoppy dry, crisp finish. This beer is a classic in so many ways. A crossover beer that converted many palates and created many beer advocates, as well as being a wonderful beer in itself and a great session brew.

I have to believe they were from different brewerys under contract to BBC. Now, after years, I open another Detroit sample. It looks great, with reddish gold color and a neat, concise head of off-white, tiny bubbles. Then there's the smell. Other than the dominating notes of brushed metal, it seems like there's quality here. I just have a problem with strong metallic notes in my beer. It appears on the palate as well, where otherwise creamy, fizzy flavors of buttered toast and clean, soft hops appear. I'm willing to bet that I could get used to the metal after a few of these.","putnam","Oct 13, 2002"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear light copper color with a nice creamy head that laces the glass very well.  Nice caramel malt flavors are definitely present along with a fairly aggresive hoppiness as compared to the other beers I have tried in the style.  Smooth and not overly sweet caramel malt opens up the brew.  The malt holds up and supports the brew as the tangy hoppiness takes over at the end to provide a nice crisp finish.  Very full flavored, this medium bodied brew is creamy and nicely crisp with the hop twang at the end.  This beer has always served me well as a fall back brew and goes especially nice in the summertime.","Murph","Oct 09, 2002"

Taste is fresh, slightly fruity, notes of subdued flowery hops & slightly biscuity malt. Finishes smooth and mellow, with nice hop and malt interplay on the palate...invites another swallow. A great session beer...although it seems to me that when this beer was first rolled out on a wider scale back in the mid-80's, it had a bit more balls in the hop dept. It seems the recipe has been ""tweaked""since then. Or maybe since it's made in a few different locations the final product varies slightly, I dunno.

I was not disappointed.  The amber hue and thick white head, although short-lived, were pleasing to the eye.  The smell was of hops that had overwhelmed its malty companion.  The taste went to the malt, however the hops were making a comeback at the end of the flavor.

Still, it was the first ""national"" beer I can remember that decided that a brisk hop aroma was not a bad thing as the macro brewers had seemingly ordained.  Amber color with long-lasting medium head.  Dominant noble hop aroma over caramel maltiness-very nice.  Taste is malty sweetness followed by sharp and crisp hop bitterness.  The body varies somewhat between light to medium-perhaps based on the brewery from which it was contracted?

The mouthfeel oddly seems a bit oily.  The hop bitterness is mild, and the crystal malt sweetness is fairly high and the beer is thus on the sweet side. The pronounced, enjoyable and quinessentially floral and refined Mittelfruh hop flavor is very welcome.  The finish is slightly sugary, but with bready malt notes as well.

4.2,12.3,4,4,4,4,5,"When is doubt, drink this.  It has become a staple here in the Northeast, that you can always fall back on it.   I try to only order this on tap; great balance of hops and malt with enough flavor to drink alone or with food.","AaronRed","Nov 25, 2001"
3.86,3.2,4,3,4,5,4,"Sweet n' Malty.  Very slight hops presense here to keep the malt in check.  Sweet caramel on the nose.  Available everywhere, an enjoyable brew.","Jordan","Nov 19, 2001"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Light golden color, strong white head and lace until the end.  Clean maltiness nose with just the right amount of hops.  Slightly sweet, malty, nicely hopped flavor with a somewhat dry finish.  Medium body and rich, creamy mouthfeel.  Medium carbonation.  A very good tasting and refreshing  Classic American Pilsner.  Prosit.","ThreePistols","Nov 16, 2001"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"The new Classic.  Availability is probably its greatest attribute.  You can be at a mom-and-pop restaurant in the middle of nowhere and cahnces are they'll have a Sam for you.","pbrian","Oct 29, 2001"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Notes: A very well crafted brew, enough hops to go around yet still very balanced. Soon to be a classic (first brewed in 1984), an excellent fall back or session beer also.","Jason","Sep 09, 2001"
3.66,-2.1,4,3,4,3,4,"Not bad.  Not nearly as good as their seasonal beers, but better than most American (non-microbrew) beer.","bk3nj","Jul 06, 2001"
