"I will be letting a few more secrets out about other Stroh's Beers in other reviews. ;)"
"It's no worse than anything else at the price. Why not drink the Detroit version of Bud?"
"True story: In college, I purchased a 12 pack of Stroh's. I could only drink three of them. I gave the next six away to one person at a time (because no one would take a second one). I ended up pouring the last three down the drain after a year in the fridge. Make of that what you will."

"Used to tend bar 30 yrs ago, and still carries the same taste and characteristics today.  Was a very popular pour in the 'rust belt' region, mainly used to chase the after shift 'shot and a beer'.  The price is about the same today as it was 30 yrs ago (I bought a 15 pack of cans for $8.49 in October 2014).  Given that, it has weathered inflation better than most beers."

"Light corn grist, faint hops, near toffee like malt.  Light bitterness, coupled with corn cob.  Ever so faint diactel but not too bad, I've had dirtier lagers but can't call it clean.  Light bodied watery brew. Overall, this is an ok adjunct lager."

"Tastes like another 'premium' beer, Michelob- bland."

"Taste is astringent and watery, slightly harsh. Papery grainy ""flavor"" that's extremely hard to pick up. Bland and only slightly offensive. Has little redeeming value, it's not one of the better nostalgia macros out there, PBR is far better for a generic macro."

"Overall this is a great beer to get drunk on. It is not a horrible thirty pack like a natural light but it is not a fantastic beer either. I do like Milwaukee's best ice better but this is god for the price and I'll buy it again because I definitely like it better than bud light."

"Stroh's is a Fire roasted hops brew. This brew has a nice golden amber Color. Has a rich taste and smooth. A taste you will not find anywhere else. It is your everyday American Larger Beer. This is a good drinking brew. Goes down smooth. Priced right. I will be getting this brew to change up on other main stream brews out on the market."

"Final Grade: 3.14, a passable C+. Stroh's obviously isn't the greatest beer I've ever had, but as far as cheap adjunct lagers go, you could do worse - far, far worse. This is a serviceable macro brew that will get the job done; I could pound these all night, and - thanks to the relatively clean taste and lack of cloying adjunct notes - never get tired of it. One of 3 or 4 'value brand' lagers available in the Ontario market that I would consider worth re-purchasing. Stroh's floats amongst the rest of the cream of the crap, and I hold it in roughly similar esteem as the likes of PBR, Miller High Life, and other 'upper tier' domestic US macros. Bottoms up!"

"Poured into pint glass. Foamed and quickly went to thin layer. Slight stickness to glass. High carbonation. Very light, watered down flavor,pale yellow. Better then bud or coors for a cheap beer. Not bad for just a plain basic no frills beer. I will buy a case again for river float trips. A good river,fishing kinda of beer."

"We switched to National Bohemian as a step up from this - not a great night for good beer."

" I liked this beer as compared to the American Lagers of the time. Was a good price and tasted better than Bud or Miller, at least to me."

"Oh, you'd better believe this is part of a Spelunky fest! It pours a clear yellow topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises corn and very light wheat. The taste holds notes of corn, flowers, and a slightly odd and vague sweetness. The body is quite light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, one of the better adjunct lagers I've had in a while, though still a good distance away from a truly good beer."

"I’ve tried many different beers, ales, etc., over the last few years, making an effort to visit breweries to sample their products at their freshest. While there are certainly many wonderful brews available today, Stroh’s is the one to which I continue to return. It’ll always bring a smile to your face, and the certainty that it tastes the way beer should."
""
""
""
"Taste: I got this expecting it to maybe be like a Blue Ribbon, but Stroh's pales in comparison. This is a drinkable, better-than-BMC macro that I wouldn't mind having again, but I'd definitely take a PBR over this one. PBR's hint of sweetness and seemingly better quality makes me choose that one over Stroh's."

"O - Overall, this beer wins an award in my opinion. The award for blandest beer I have ever had. They shouldn't even brew this stuff, it actually has less flavor than Bud Light. Luckily, I didn't pay for it, as I had it at a party. The party was definitely some fun after knocking back 10 of these though!"

"this beer is good for when you want to still drink abunch of beer then be completely fine to drive. Ive drank this all day and had buddies call me at night to go get a bite to eat and do some real partying afterwards so if anything its a good warm up beer i suppose."

"Light bodied, this is a lawn mower beer or weekend party through and through. It's slightly sticky and coats the tongue a little going down. Also slightly drying."

"An okay beer, better than the average macro but not better than anything else."

"Surprisingly, I enjoyed this. For the style the hops were impeccable. The grainy qualities were kept to a minimum and it was easy to drink."

"Strohs is a light colored beer with a quickly dissipating head. For the style it goes down nice and simple if you get a nice batch. Not a lot to talk with the taste. Really like that you can buy a 15 pack. made by pabst better then the bud or miller offerings"
"Overall it's quite unimpressive but not entirely undrinkable."
"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of slight sweet malt, pale malt, grain, and slight citrus hops. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of grain, pale malt, hint of sweet malt, and a hint of citrus hops. Overall, decent aroma, blend, and body for an American Adjunct Lager."
"for me this is another beer i can add to list of fridge beer for my none craft friends."
"Quite a pale yellow beer, typical macro looks. Decent head, a little thicker than most and lasts about as long as any mass-produced AAL; that is, not very long. Not much visible carbonation, glass like clarity. Boring looks. Smell is grainy, a faint hops nose, subtle metallic aroma, wet grass. Taste has a brief flash of grainy sweetness, fades quickly to adjunct/barley lager tastes. Minimal hops bitterness, clean finish. About average tastes. Light, bubbly carbonation, a little too much for my tastes, but not bad overall."
"Overall, I definitely think that Stroh's is one of the best, if not THE best, of the macro adjunct lagers. The fact that the price is right only makes it better. While I would still rather have a well down craft ale, sometimes you just want a simple, cheap beer, and this fits the bill."
"I wonder how many people referenced '30 pack of Stroh's, 30 pack of ho's' in their review?"
"O - It just doesn't have that Detroit River water taste anymore."
"The wife has me on a beer budget this week and I needed something to last me a weekend. Its really no worse than most premium-priced domestics in the same vein and actually better than most comparably-priced beers. It's still pretty gross though."
"If what you're looking for is a cheap beer to keep your fridge full, this is my first suggestion. It's not much different from others in this category, ie. macro brew adjunct lager, yet the one thing that sets it apart is hops. Granted it's no IPA (I'm no noob, I'm a certified hop head) but I swear to you, there is an essence of hop oil in this beer; certainly more than can be found in High Life. Oddly enough, I find it to be most present when imbibed directly from the can and not so much from the bottle or glass. Put it in a keeper-cooler on a hot day and get it before those annoying hipsters do (this'll be the next PBR on campus)."
"Took it down straight from the can. Not a ton of flavor, some corn and grain. Nothing overpowering. Light bodied beer with plenty of carbonation. Went down smooth. Could drink a lot of these without a problem."
"D-Really easy drinking cheap domestic beer that's nice every once in a while."
"Yet another classic domestic cheap beer! From random notes: Pours a light golden yellow brew with an average white head that quickly dissolves to a fine film and white ring. Aroma of corn grits, some watery citrus peel and a touch of burnt ash. Flavor is light bodied, well carbonated, a gritty texture with flavors of watery corn syrup bread crust and some citrus. Finish is crisp, clean cut with a very short lasting bitterness."
"D: Hop character in an American lager? It has a decent body and mouthfeel. Looks okay and tastes okay, but does fall down a bit on the nose. Still, it is a fair bit better than many others at its price and more than a few above it."
"d-overall not very good beer but not terrible for what was paid, if your looking for a beer to just get trashed on or need to be economical this would be a good one to consider... trust me im an engineering student"
"Pours with about two fingers of light, airy head that quickly dissipates. Liquid is bright gold and seems to have a bit more color than most adjunct lagers. Odor is grassy and mild, don't notice much from the malts. Tastes like grains or grass, fairly dry for this style. Stroh's is crisp and easy to drink, not too sweet and not sour or stale. If you're looking for a brew to buy in mass quantities for a party, you could do a lot worse."
"The mouthfeel was very light and watery, but still a very crisp, clean taste."
"Better than many others (anything bud except for the new wheat, which might be better)."
"Overall, there just isn't too much to write on a beer like this. Not a lot of flavors here, no surprise. Not something I plan on drinking again, but I could if I had to."
"Overall a OK beer , would be good for a hot summer day."
"RJT"
"goes down easy. could have quite a few of these on a hot day and not really notice. much less offensive than other examples of the style."
"-- it's only sold by one supermarket chain, in 15-packs for $8.99 -- making me wonder whether it will be discontinued a la Oldsmobile. It has a drier taste than most American macros -- not rice-y and sweet -- but fewer hops than most of us would like."
"Stroh's pours a clear straw gold with a thin head that disappears quickly. Dry graininess dominates the aroma, not too much else there. The flavor is crisp dry and a bit grainy, with a surprising decent amount of bitterness. No hop flavor to speak of. Just another cheap lager, but I think it's a hair better than average."
"Mouthfeel is sticky, with a below average amount of carbonation for an adjunct, and overall nothing special. This is something I could drink a few of on a party night. Something cheap, but still is far above average for the price. Probably won't buy it ever again, just something the roommate grabbed on a whim and thought I'd give it a try."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Picked up a 30-pack from Shangy's for, well, not much, to share with friends that enjoy cheap beer. I was pleasantly surprised to discover I could actually enjoy a can. Sure, it tastes a little like cooked corn and white bread, but it's smooth enough without any off-flavors (I figure DMS/corn adjunct is acceptable for the style). It's simple, it's kinda tasty. It's not... that.. bad. I said."
"A clear pale golden color pour with a two finger short lasting foamy white head , high carbonation . Aroma is lightly sweet with some actual hop notes , faint but thewre . Flavor is much the same as the aroma a nice tiny hop note in there , crisp clean finish and mouthfeel , light body , very sessionable and non offensive for the style."
"Notes: I would definitely classify this as a premium american adjunct lager. It is miles above any BMC product in this category. The fact that you can actual taste and smell the hops, combined with the normal beer looking head (instead of soda-like) makes it memorable."
"Local bar in town was selling 6 Stroh's in an ice bucket. Figured I'd give it a try. I had been surprised at how well I liked Schlitz. And Stroh's like Schlitz had been bought out by Pabst. I was surprised, had a really good taste, a friend with me said it is much better than Miller or Bud. I have to say I enjoy the Schlitz better for one reason, after a couple of beers the Stroh's was heavier on the stomach. But overall, taste was good and I'd drink it again. 6 cans of Strohs on ice, beats Miller or Bud on tap anyday!!"
"Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. It's cheap beer after all."
"D: More flavorful than most others in the style, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representative of a lackluster style, if I were forced to drink pick a beer in this style to drink, this one would be at the top of that list."
"I have two different standards for evaluating beer. The first involves new or interesting brews and is not applicable to Strohs.The second applies to older brands and American mass brews, and it is to ask whether the beer in question tastes and feels like the first beer I sipped from a crockery mug while sitting on my mother's knee many, many years ago. Does it have""beer flavor"" More tha any American beer I know Strohs gets high marks for""beer flavor"" and I rate it highly."
"D- For what it is, I would say that it is highly drinkable. Not bursting with flavor, but it is incredibly smooth and non-offensive."
"Mouthfeel was pretty watery, but honestly that is what I expected. At less than $8 for a 15 pack, my expectations weren't all that high. All I know is that this is a better choice than some of the other cheap adjunct lagers in the beercave at the local gas station. And on a warm summer day tending the BBQ grill, this beer does the trick."
"Not bad to quaf on a hot day."
"Almost pale yellow with an airy finger of pure white head. The smell is cereal grain with a whiff of lemony hops. This beer is simple but good, toasted grain, a slight corny sweetness and squeaky clean in the finish. Smooth carbonation and medium light bodied. This beer is honestly much better than any of the BMC light beer crap at a fraction of the cost."
"Drinkability: While this isn't awful, I would prefer something else. There are even other Adjunct Lagers that I feel are better than this one."
"Drinkability is good for an American lager. For a non-light beer, it has a lighter feel to it than most normal lagers. There is a good, solid taste that keeps you drinking without overwhelming you."
"D- could chug it as a thirst quencher but other than that it's only a hand or two above the big guys."
"D -"
"Very light bodied and airy in feel. Yet there is still a crisp structure here. It's totally and brainlessly poundable, and more or less everything a lower/middle rung macro needs to be. Inoffensive and thirst-busting and inexpensive."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light pilsner malt and adjunct scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. There is little hop aroma to speak of. The taste is below average. It has a weak and watery mlat flavor that's really telling of the amount of adjuncts present. It's a quick drinker with a dry, musty finish. The mouthfeel is below average as well. It's a low bodied beer with tons of carbonation. This is a forgettable brew and very low on my list of top macro lagers."
"Poured from a can into a weizen glass. Very pale yellow color with virtually no head. Not much aroma to speak of either. The taste was very light and watery in the mouth. This is a good beer for chugging on a hot day but not a good tasting beer. At $3.39 for a six-pack, I can't complain to much."
"All in all, a good choice comparable to Pabst or Miller High life."
"A surprising change on the mouthfeel, almost makes this beer feel substantial."
"Definetely taste light hops. Very clean and crisp lager. Nothing glamorous, nothing horrible. A solid cheap macro, that is good for tipping a few back. One of those beers when you don't want anything too complicated."
"Drinkability: This one is what it is. And what is it is ""not very good, but probably average or a little above for the style."" So I'll give it that, as well as that it's probably 4% abv or something like that. It's good to try these old world American lagers, though it's sad that they were likely at one point much, much better."
"Drinkability - easy to throw back a few."
"M + D: A sharp carbonation, with a bit of foaminess on the way down. Body has a little bit to it, at least for the style. It's unfortunate that the flavour seems to go downhill so quickly. It could have potential as a lawnmower beer, but this is more a choice to simply get drunk and guzzle."
"This is my ""Lawn Mowing"" beer. Pours very light gold, heads quickly and fades. Slight hops smell and clean taste. After an hour pushing the lawn mower on a hot Summer afternoon two or three of this is a good thirst quencher. Costs only a little more than bottled water."
"Bright yellow gold in the glass with a small head of foam, it has a lightly malted flavour with a pretty nice hop bite. Easy to drink and cheap(for here) at $4 a six pack. A pretty good value for what you get, imo, and would certainly pass as a good summer time thirst quencher."
"Sampled on New Year's Day 2009 and poured from can no. 12018-E50503. This used to be available everywhere in New Hampshire but now it is a challenge to find it. However the local distributor must be doing some kind of push because I am seeing more of it. It pours a carbonated yellow tone with fizzy white head that bubbles lively and then slowly diminishes during the course of the tasting. Aroma is grassy and metallic. The taste is slightly bolder than most macros and finishes on the dry side. This is pretty typical of American macros. You either like 'em or hate 'em. This is more tolerable on my wallet at $2.99 a six pack."
"D: Some of the other reviewers for this beer compare it to PBR, and I don't think that's very far off the mark. Compared to Pabst, it's a bit maltier and not quite as bitter, so pick your poison I guess. Very drinkable as an inoffensive throwback beer and obviously quite affordable. Plus the cans have an awesome design. I'd put this on par with Bud, PBR, and High Life atop the dubious macro throne at this point."
"Yikes. The fire-brewed disaster. Nearly clear, with a hint of yellow. Paper, metal, ash, and bum urine in the nose. Bizarre sour/metallic taste throughout (must be the fire-brewing). Just terrible. You are high if you think this beer is anywhere above a ""D-"""
"D: A purported step-up beer from our friends at Pabst. Not really any better than PBR and therefore not worth the premium over it."
"Overall for the price i paid for this, i can do much better. It did however serve its purpose for washing down; chips, dip, wings and pizza. If your sitting around with your buddies just shootin the shit and consuming anything of a salty nature this beer will do the trick. Id say give it a try, it really isnt that bad."
"Yes, yes I'm definitely not a beer connoisseur as of yet. I'm a bloody 19 year old kid, so at least I'm somewhat prone to drinking this, right? Pabst this, Pabst that. I like PBR too, but for the price and taste, this really is the best American Macro lager out there. No questions asked. I too think most products from Pabst (well Miller) taste similar, but Stroh's really is in a league of its own, even though I acknowlege this isn't the premier league when it comes to beer. Actually this tastes similar to Pabst, except that this seems to have a little more taste going down, and it has a more bitter, but cleaner aftertaste when compared to PBR. Really, be grateful that this is still being sold in some parts of the country. If you're gonna get a macro American lager, check out Stroh's. It really is the most earnest in price and taste. Keep it alive!!"
"I can't believe they still make this stuff. Well, I can actually. As long as people drink like my departed grandfather and my uncle, there will be a market for this ""upper end"" cheap macro. Gave it a 3 just because I didn't pour it out into a glass. Of course the can smelled metallic, but also like dewey grass and grainy adjuncts. Despite its wateriness, there was some sweetness in this otherwise pale immitation of a real beer. It is a real American macro though. Not harsh at all on the aftertaste and in fact goes down smooth. This is one of those beers that people my age pass over for Bud or Natty or Corona at a BBQ, but people the generation or 2 above us take. That is what it is. A light drinking, summer beer really."
"Pours a average golden urine color with a three finger tall fizzy white head that is less than impressive,leaving behind zero lacing. The nose is grainy and just a tad peppery with some faint earthy hop aromas. This is a pretty good macro when it comes to flavor,that being that it actually has some flavor,not an abundance,but more than normal. Mostly malty and grainy tastes a little like Pringles potatoe chips,with some grassy notes on the tail. The body is light,and the finish is clean and refreshing."
"Well what can I say, this is my every day beer. When I go to the store to buy a 30 pack to re-stock my fridge Strohs is my old stand by. My best friend's uncle got me hooked on this a few years ago. The great part about Strohs is that along with being the best tasting american swill around here, is that it is also very cheap compared to Budweiser, Coors, and Miller. The only downfall is that it is a little difficult to find so I am forced to buy it at room temperature at the local grocery store. Things could be worse. Oh by the way around here we call it by its name if you spell it backwards!!!! May the shorts be with ya!"
"D - I'm floored by this one. If I could find this more easily this would be my cheap fall back session lager of choice...I currently drink PBR or Old Milwaukee (strangely, both Heilman brews) when I just want to drink four or five beers with my buddies on the cheap. Good stuff for what it is."
"Drink: Very good, no harsh. A good recommendation for Stroh's."
"Overall, I feel that this beer is underrated amongst it's American macro lager peers. A nice addition to any cook out or to quench your thirst after chasing your dog around the neighborhood."
"Pale yellow colored beer with the expected macro taste and and aroma.Goes down smooth and has no offensive aftertaste.Another one of those beers I drank as a youngster and will continue to drink in the future.It's good on the palate and on the wallet.I recommend and will purchase again."
"Today, I got a rocky, bone-white head from the pour with good retention throughout. The color was a light yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. The nose was somewhat sweet, nowhere near as bitter as I remember it as being. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. There was very little flavor associated with this beer. It was very bland, even more than the Corona that I had consumed a little while previously. To think that this was what used to routinely kick my sixteen year-old ass ... No wonder my Pops used to laugh at all of us Bill Badass wannabes. The finish had a slight metallic aspect. I'm done with Stroh's after this. Short's on the other hand, now there's some good beer."
"Yep, that pretty much sums it all up. If you're going macro-lager, and want to get a good laugh from your buddies, this is a must-buy. Often overlooked in college towns alike, Strohs is the redheaded stepchild of yellow fizzy beers. And for good reason. At least the others go down smooth or taste enough like water to get you by. But no, Stroh's affirms its place as party pooper (emphasis on the poop) right in your mouth. Get it for a good laugh, but you'll soon reconsider your ""drink to get drunk"" binge drinking ways."
"This was my dad's beer of choice, so it's my go-to when I'm feeling old school. I'm told it used to be better when they still fire-brewed it, though I haven't a clue if that's just the nostalgia talking."
"Drinkability - Nothing special. Okay if you want a cheaply priced beer."
"I remember going the Stroh brewery in Detroit back in the early nineties for my first ever real beer tasting. I never grew up in the Detroit area, but remember many of my friends who were from there - their parents always had this stuff in their fridges. Nostalgia play a part in my slight fondness for this beer, but truth be told, it's really not a bad macro lager."
"D- This beer is one of the most drinkable beers at the end of the Eco section in the store."
"I poured the longneck bottle into a pint glass. Decent golden color. Not much head. It faded quickly. Smells better than Budweiser or any other American macro that I can think of. Hints of hops & malt. Tastes pretty good for a cheap beer. Probably better than any cheap beer that I can think of. Growing up in the Detroit area, this was the beer. My old man drank it from his youth and continues to drink it today. This is about the best $3.99 six pack of longnecks out there."
"The 30 pack for 12.99 inticed me. It had the look of a typical American lager, but OH MY GOD it was like drinking Ohio river water with a hint of dead Carp. I could tell that there was a hint of hops, but it was over powered by the unfavorable hint of mint. Where the Hell did that come from? Never again will I consume a beer that had absolutely no hint of flavor, except the morning after need to brush my tongue and apologize to my wife for drinking it."
"Damn, this might be the most watery, thin-ass beer Ive ever had, except for Strohs Light. Of course it has the pale yellow color with no head, but its difficult to even find carbonation in this one. They could of atleast gave us something in this beer to enjoy. Your better off tossing the last 1/4 of the beer and grabbing a new one as is just gets worse and worse the further into the can you go. My cuttoff limit is usually the whole damn thing, but for this beer, I cant even finish the whole can without being damn well sick and tired of it."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: What can I say, this is a fizzy yellow beer, expected to feel fizzy in the mouth and light bodied...and it is. The beer is easy to drink, and one could drink this all night, however I think that there are better macros out there, why someone would want to regularly drink this for any reason but to get drunk is beyond me."
""
"A good beer. Excellent for mowing, yard work, and hanging around. Certainly not like Bigfoot. Decent head, minimal lacing, crisp smell with just a hint of hops. The hops are more noticeable in the taste. Really nice American Lager. Makes Bud look like the crap it is. A bargain wherever you buy it. My only macro beer(maybe amber bock, too)"
"Me and my friends used to drink this during our college days in Pittsburgh (the fine years of '88 to '90 - I think Stroh's was the first to do the 30-pack, please correct me if I'm wrong). What brought me back was a few years ago Consumer Reports rated all of the domestic beers and Stroh's won. I was like WTF??? Really? So I bought a 30-pack of cans, and wow, was I surprised. Not the crap beer that I remembered, but a decent, smooth, American lager. My friends laughed in my face when I told them I was drinking it again - ah well. Pours a nice, deep golden color, good foam and lacing. Taste is above average for a macro. A great session beer. And the price? $15 for a 30 pack? Tough to beat. This is a great one to just have on hand for whenever you need a good, after a long workday beer."
"Light smell and not as bad as I would have expected. Taste is light, but there is some sweetness and a bit more taste than most maintream brews. Easy to sip down with plenty of carbonation and I can see why people can put down so many of these things while mowing the lawn or fishing on a hot summer day."
"overall for a macro this isnt half bad, I think that its a beer ill have around for nights that ive already have had a few"
"Well, this isn't the worst macro I've had. It's certainly smoother than your standard fare. Corn, cereal, and a slight sour taste dominate the flavor. All that said, the mouthfeel is actually ok (not overly fizzy, surprisingly), and the finish is tolerable. Really, this is an ok beer for barbecuing on a lazy summer day. But not something I'd have regularly."
"Mouthfeel is a little sticky but the beer is predictably light bodied. Carbonation is a little heavy handed but not too bad. It improves on the Bud by providing some flavor for the carbonation to contend with. I tend to go with the Stroh's simply because there is some flavor to experience even if it isn't very good. My comparison tonight reinfoces this idea but I may be more prone to buying High Life for occasions of easy summer swilling."
"I tend to have a soft spot in my heart for some of the retro beers: PBR, High Life, Olde Style, Schlitz etc. I remember drinking ""fire brewed"" Strohs on tap during a beach trip after my freshman year of college. I have to say like many of the aforementioned granddad beers it has much more taste and character than BMC. The color and carbonation was right on for American lager. The smell was mostly corn, but enough malt to note. Taste was more of the same, but really pretty pleasing considering the style. Mouthfeel was fine, again relative to style, and the drinkability was very high. It is no longer sold in my local market, and I was glad to have found some on a recent roadtrip in a 30 pack for 12 bucks. Definitely a better bargain than most macros. If only it still said ""Firebrewed"" whatever the hell that means."
"I had my first Stroh's when I was in basic training at Fort Knox in 1969. At that time it was still advertised as ""Fire Brewed"" and was made at the original Stroh brewery. Since then Stroh's has been literally around the block and has turned up as a quite average beer, among many, made in Milwaukee. But, like many of my memories of 3 cases of ""backyard fence"" beer for $7.50, Stroh's will always have a place in my heart if only due to that first bottle at the PX at Fort Knox."
"Overall a pretty decent beer. Much better than any other macro I have tried. Drinkability is high with this one."
"Stroh's in a can, why not let's do this...appears a golden clear bubbly quote, unquote beer look to it with large heavily carbonated bright white head floating above body dwindling at a moderate pace leaves some nice patches of sporadic lacing around my Duvel chalice...sorry Duvel. Aroma is heavy on the cooked veggie quality often described with these types of brews, mild corn sweetness something gives me the notion that there's just a touch of mild hop herbal quality going on which says alot when compared to most American light lagers. Taste not overly sweet definitely ridden with adjuncts but it's somewhat enjoyable combo of mild sweetness with corn and rice finish and a light herbal undertow of hop flavor not much bitterness of course but balanced and finishes with a touch of offness grainy/metallic combo...while the drinkability of this brew is solid all around ""American"" or ""old timer"" beer I'm proud to still be able to drink this over Bud, Miller, Coors just to be different, sometimes you get enjoyment with that as far as the mouthfeel goes it's light bodied heavy with the carbonation prepare to say excuse me honey...and yeah I know this one doesn't smell as good as my usual IPAs but come on our grandfathers drank a version of this beer."
"This has a nice alcohol bite;in that it has it, then it doesn't. Unlike PBR. Second to Schlitz on my under '3.99sixthatI'llbuy' . Grainy, watered down obviously, but decent gold color with more 'flavor' than most in the genre. Excellent for cooking beer brats, beer chicken,etc...I dont know why but this is my preferred beer for cooking....also makes mean beer batter. Relatively low on the adjuncts compared to Bud Light/Busch/Busch Lt. It was better for some reason about 15 yrs ago...maybe it's my memory or I think someone said it used to be firebrewed...maybe that's it. Maybe it's the 'stronger' aroma and flavor than that of its' competitiors that I like...unlike Natty....when you drink stroh's....at least you know you're drinkin beer!"
"Now this one is for sipping around the campfire all night. and the can is pretty too. I was buying this for 9.99 per 30pk before it got all popular or something. Clean with corn, and some burpy rice, watery to quench that thirst born of a long day on the assembly line. No aroma I noticed, no finish save a trace of thin grain water."
"Nice looking can. Stroh's pours your typical deep yellow with little head that dissipates quickly. Smell is mild sweet malts with a touch of grain. Mouthfeel is light with nice carbonation that isn't flat or fizzy, it's right in the middle. The taste is good with sweet malts on the tongue (not fizzy!) followed by a finish with decent hop presence and a litte sweetness. Not much complexity at all but certainly nothing that would offend. This beer is best enjoyed directly from the can as is PBR and Schlitz. Another one that is so much better than the big three. Many thanks to P.O. Box 739, Milwaukee WI, 53201 for a good value ($7.49 for a 15-pack)."
"Pretty average for a weekend-at-the-lake beer. Typical of American Macro Lagers in that it has a pronounced pilsner malt base that shows moderately high grain flavors, lightened body, straw colors and lacking head retention. A bit special in a lemon-zest, green apple skin, character that adds to the refreshing quality. Quite efforvescent on the toung and dry in the finish. Though not a great beer, I have had worse from some good craft breweries."
"Somewhat muted golden color. Thin foamy white had that is gone in a second. Somewhat chemical and wet cardboard aroma-not even ""beer like"" that some macros are. Slight malty flavor with a decent grainy tinge to it. Just a slight bitterness to be found. Decent enough mouthfeel-theres not much there it does hold up well considering the style. Above average drinkability-has a slight ""snap"" to it which I like in a macro. I am all over it for hot summer drinking-and I love to point out that Strohs spelled backwards is shorts !!!"
"I haven't yet entered the scores, but it looks as though Pabst Blue Ribbon will take the blue ribbon in Macro Smackdown X by a slight margin. That's not to say that Stroh's is a dog. If matched against almost any beer in the MacSmack series, it would probably emerge victorious. I'm surprised, and pleased, by both of these Old School brews."
"This is a very malty brew for the style and has a slightly buttery wheat bread taste balanced by a zippy bitter that slides in smoothly and leaves a crackery finish. It is mid bodied with a soft carbonation that slowly creeps in intensity, and drinkability is limited only by a full feeling in the gut. This may be the best macro lager I've had."
" I find this beer very drinkable. I would love to try the Stroh's Dark. I didn't even know Stroh's made a dark and I would bet it's a step up. Stroh's is a beer I used to drink many moons ago. It was a beer me and the guys could all agree on. I was surprised to find it was still in production and just had to try it. Though my taste has changed I was not nearly as disapointed in this ""old"" beer as I have been in others I have gone back and tried."
"I used to drink a lot of this in my younger days, and I haven't seen it since I moved to Houston. It's really not a bad or offensive beer, but better cheap beers are available (High Life, Schlitz). I wouldn't turn it down if offered to me, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it, either."
"Bottom line: beats the hell out of BMC."
"The mouth is a trifle thin, but the drinkablity is surprisingly strong. I would love to find this on tap or bottle. I have some fond memories of getting 16oz returnable bottles of this back in college."
"I suppose I can buy a dozen of these average beers. Many are cheaper. Strohs has an edge a slight bit on flavor, but it seems to be on par with every other macro lager. So, average drinkability. I did enjoy it a bit better from the bottle."
"Ah good old Strohs. Cheap and solid. Clear medium yellow with a medium sized, white, foamy slowly diminishing head. Grainy nose with a light hops presence thats rather good for a cheapo. The taste is refreshing and crisp. Some more weak malt, light citrus, and some doughy yeast. Lightly sweet up front but finishes lightly dry. It has a thin body, slightly oily (in a good way) texture, and moderate to lively carbonation. I bought a case of this for pretty cheap, and the more I drink it, the more I like it. Its nothing special but among the domestic macros, I rank it high."
"Poured a clear yellow color with a white head a foam that came up very fast and dissipated very fast leaving a small ring around the glass. The aroma is that of sweet grains and malt with an alcohol aroma in the background. The taste was that of bland hops and malts with a light, sweet and watery mouthfeel. Since the taste was bland, this will go down nice and smooth. Since this beer is cheap, you can drink a couple of these in a sitting. This had lawnmower beer written all over it."
"This is in my opinion one of the worst beers ever. It pours a poor yellow and some froth. The smell is crappy. Bland with a hint of sweetness. The taste is the worst, it is so bad it sends shivers down my spine just thinking about it. It starts lame and uninspiring with the taste of the all to familiar cereal malts. Then comes the hops and that adjunct sweet taste. Oh sweet Jesus it is Camo all over again! Luckily it is a very watery beer so it is just drinkable enough to chug and get over with."
"Back in the late 70's this was my favorite beer (How could you pass up a beer that was Fire brewed, whatever that means). Lets give it another try, almost 30 years later. Poured a non-impressive pale yellow color, with modet white head that fell to a thin ring but left nice lacing on the glass. Smell is virtually non-existent. Taste is also very minimal, but at least not disgusting. Finishes easy and refreshing. Good as a spacer, lawnmower beer, or on a hot summer afternoon. Would be a nice beer to pair with spicy wings."
"An american lager made by pabst breweries of San Antonio Texas, in general is like a few of mexican beers worst to drink, appearance, taste, and drinkability are not for me its adjoincts of rice and grains, give an awful flavor, mouthfeel is low in the average, good for the mexican food; 25% recommended."
"This beer poured a nice golden yellow, kind of similar to honey, with a small and short-lived white head. It smells nice and malty, much better smelling than say, a Budweiser. The taste is good and malty, much like the smell, with a bit of hops to balance it. Very, very good tasting for this style. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp, not too carbonated. This is a very drinkable beer, and at $7 for a 15-can suitcase, it's just about unbeatable in terms of value, especially considering how good it tastes."
"This beer tastes good. It seems to me that this beer is a combination of a macrobrew like a Budweiser, mixed with a quality stout. This beer has flavor. Some of that typical macrobrew flavor, but some of that good stout flavor. It's satisying to drink. I'll have more at the bars in the future."
"The second one I poured into a glass to get a look at this beer. A nice slightly darkened yellow with a fine white head that hangs out for a little while and actually leaves some lace. The smell is of a malty lager there is none of the corn smell I was expecting, the hops are very muted though and there is still this cheap beer smell. It has a pleasent taste I welcomed, lots of malt and a slight bit of complexity as it warms, the hops however are so muted and dull that all they add is a little bitterness. It does have a full body and I would cheap drink this all night if need be."
"If you review this beer objectively, according to style, this is pretty damn good. No off flavors whatsoever, and one of the tastiest ""macros"" I've ever had. Maybe the fact it's an all barley malt beer has something to do with it, but if you're looking for a good macro, this would be the one."
"This was a decent offering, esp for its price. Very bright in color with almost no head, which sucked a little. Aroma was grainy and basically, like a lager but nothing off about it at all. Flavor is a bit bland and mellow with wheaty notes coming through. Not really any adjunct taste or off flavors. The body was real mellow and not all fizzy like most macros. I liked it better that way. Finish is crisp and dry, lingering just a bit. Not sweet, not dry, but nice."
"The body is crisp and smooth, quite refreshing, and it goes down easy."
"Light gold with one finger head. Poor head retention but nice lacing. Aroma and taste are a pleasent balance of malt and hops. Smooth, and the crisp bite that is familiar to the all-malt lager style.Pabst brewing company excells at making affordable session beer with above average flavor. While not very different than your american macro, the absence of adjunct malts and smooth drinkability make it superior, even to other popular all-malt lagers."
"The drinkablilty of this beer was quite good. I could drink this all night with some friends around a camp fire."
"Stroh's is hard to find in my neck of the woods but I always pick some up when I see it. At less than $5.50/ for 12 short necks, this beer blows the big three away. Pours a clear golden straw color with good size head. The crisp, clean aroma is nicely balanced between the malt and hops. Sweet malty taste with just a hint of hops. An excellent lawn mower beer."
"clean, crisp and slightly dry on the finish."
"The final beer during Farewell to Falstaff. For a cheap, ol macro, not terribly bad. Sure, fizzy yellow, fast disappearing head, no aroma  but the taste was somewhat malty behind the corn. If some guy gave me one I would finish it off, but I wouldnt buy any (except for the one $1.50 can at the fallback bar, Tin Can."
"Clear sun yellow. Not a lot of carbonation noticeable on viewing. Big airy white head. Lace is definitely there. Moderate in quantity. Aroma is all corn. And a little grainy sweetness too. This tastes to me the way Old Mil used to taste to me when I was a youngin. Very bluntly sweet and grainy. The mouthfeel isn't quite as fizzy as most macros, but rather subdued in its carbonation. Not one I'm gonna hit up again and again..."
"Okay, this was the cheapest beer available and since i haven't reviewed it yet . . . not a good excuse. I haven't had a Stroh's since my freshman year in college when we hosted a huge party and bought 15 cases of this stuff (to the dismay of some). It took all year to finish it off. Not as good as a Miller Lite, but I've had much worse. Still a good choice for a college party, 9 years after the fact."
"Pours light gold in color which is pretty good for a American Macro. A nice white head which is gone in less than five minutes. Not much lacing in glass. Just a bit more hops than what normally find with this style. It finishes dry and crisp. When face with the choice of drinking a macro vs not drinking beer at all, I choose this beer."
"A Michigan classic. Nice pale golden color with a solid medium carbonation. Short lived head leaves a touch of lace around the glass. Strong scents of corn and barley are present, as well as the presence of alcohol. Straight forward well made American Macro. Not what it used to be, as I am told by the old timers, but still pretty good. Flavors of corn and grain, not overpowering, but not wimpy either. Recommended for lager lovers."
"Very light, almost straw gold color, with a nice looking head, which fades to a layer of tiny bubbles. Smell? What Smell? Maybe a light touch of grain, but that is it. Taste is about as average as you can get. Malty, but at least it's not corny or overly sweet. Mouthfeel is well carbonated yet thin. Not bad for a macro, good for the price."
"*edit: it was a can I reviewed not a bottle!"
"Picked a sixer up in Mississippi while on vacation. Stroh's color is golden yellow with an average-sized head. Aroma is very light on the adjuncts, mainly a grassy sweet smell is noted. The taste is fairly average overall, but very good for a macro product. This is very smooth without adjunct nastiness. Stroh's flavor starts off crisp and finishes lightly malty. This probably the best macro I've had, just a little ahead of PBR. I wish I could get this in Houston, I would make it my standard lawnmower beer."
"I admit a bit of nostalgiac feeling toward Stroh's. It was my go-to beer of choice during college when my wallet was a bit thin. It pours a pale gold with a frothy white head that hangs around for a few minutes and even manages a little lace. The aroma is dominated by pale malt with a slightly mineral undertone. The taste is, again, malty with some crisp hops bitterness providing balance but never usurping the malt. Thankfully (and surprisingly) the adjunct flavors which dominate other macroswill are absent here. A great value, I'd choose this over other macroswill in a heartbeat, on a hot day or any other. I give this brew a slight edge over Miller High Life, but both are tops in cheap U.S. macros."
"Verdict: Wow. I've been on a bit of a macro kick lately, and drinking a Stroh's so soon after drinking a Budweiser really puts this beer into perspective. While this certainly isn't a standout beer by BA standards, it's a fantastic budget beer that tastes way better than it has any right to."
"Nothing to see here folks, just move along quitely to pleasanter things."
"I used to buy Keystone Light in college because it was always $10 for a 30 pack. When the tax on alcohol was increased (I hate government) I could no longer spend $10 for a 30 pack of stones...but there was yet another beer, Stroh's. I picked up a 30 of this and started drinking a few while playing my Game Cube. A few easily turned into 8 or more as there were cans all over the room before I realized it. The beer is quite tastey for what it is. There is plenty of carbonation, but much more flavor than stones. Your typical lager, malt with a little bit of hops and some sweet corn flavors...and a slight aluminum taste. The can is pretty cool looking as well. I don't mind the smell but many girls have told me that this ""aweful"" beer smells like s@#t when I crack open a can."
"Pours a three-fingered white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Clear, light amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Slightly sweet and clean, tastes like a light, good lawnmower beer. $1.00 for a 12oz bottle from LiquorBarn, Lexington, KY"
"Overall not a bad beer, but definately not great, very average, but for the price its a good deal, would be good for hot summer days, when you just want something cheap and wet."
"This beer is the best you can get for the money. I mean, anything that beats the hell out of Bud, Miller, Coors, etc... and comes in a 30 pack for a few bucks less than most 24's, is a sure thing. I'm a poor college student and this is what I pick up all the time when I want to chill and have some cheap brews."
"Pours slightly darker than pale straw, big white head that quickly runs and hides, but leaves a bit of lace behind. Aroma is grassy, earthy, tiny bit of hops, and some cardboard. Flavor is sweet, a bit grassy, some smokey apple, and a bit of hops in the finish. Thin body, crisp and refreshing...pretty much what you would expect, although it seems to have more hops than the typical AS lager."
"I was looking for a beer thats been around awhile, but not as big as the major mac's. Stroh's came to mind after seeing it, that its been around, since I was a kid. I had to search alittle for the bottle ( cans are plenty ). Im glad I found it. An American classic thats easy to drink and affordable. No major stand-outs about it. Pours a pure gold, medium carbonation, a white not-fizzy head with little lace. Taste is grassy, grain, slight hop/malt,but a hint of sweetness. A crisp beer that goes well with about anything, thats not as big as the mac's, but yet, been around forever and it won't break the bank."
"This is a very drinkable cheap beer at $6 a 15 pack. It was right next to the PBR, so I could kind of figure out what of brew it was. I was skeptical, but as the saying goes, ""curiousity didn't kill the cat"". Well, it was a little different from that, but you get the idea. In a town where Natty and Bud rule, it's good to finally have a change of pave from the usual swill. It's apperance wasn;t that amazing and neither was the smell. Infact, I really didn't smell that much. the taste was light on the hops, almost no hops that I tasted, but had a bit of a honey taste to it. That's something that most cheap beers do not possess. What else more can I say. Sure, it's no Weste, but it's good and I like it."
"Light clear gold, slightly darker than straw. Refuge adjunct head of big, thin bubbles and no lace generation. Malty aroma, a little corn husk in character. Flavor profile is based on maltiness, a little Karo syrup non-descript, but fairly smooth and inoffensive. The finish falls down to me, not really hoppy, but a metallic bitterness that might actually indicate that but that's also emphasized by too much CO2 that tends to shove it back up your nasal passages. OK beer, not a favorite. Sorry, proc... ;>)"
"As far as American macro-brewed beers are concerned, Stroh's is, in my opinion, among the elite. It pours a pale, straw yellow color with a fluffy white head that disappears way too quickly. Lacing is sparse. The aroma is a mixture of grainy, husky, metallic, and mildly hoppy. There are some hops lingering, to be sure, but a malt character is hard to detect in the nose. The taste is rather mellow and pleasant, with notes of grain, corn, hops, and pale malts. The finish is crisp, fairly clean, and inoffensive. The mouthfeel is fairly prickly and carbonated, but not overly so. This is definitely a drinkable beer, and is a cost-effective lawnmower beer if there was such a thing. It would also work wonderfully for beer-marinated bratwurst on the grill. Give it a try."
"maybe the best beer you'll find for less than $4 a six pack."
"As far as beers go that you buy in packs of 30, this isnt the worst one that you can come across. Its pretty much your basic macro brew, but it lacks the extreme shittiness that most of them have. If you are looking for a beer to drink a lot of outside or something along those lines, this would be a decent choice."
"On an aside, when I first enjoyed this beer, my buddy and I saw the beer episode of Modern Marvels on the History Channel. Several of the pictures they showed during the program were of guys sitting on barrels of Stroh's. Imagine that. The first time you have Stroh's and there's a bunch of hearty, early 1900's guys sitting on barrels of beer that probably taste a lot better than what you're drinking. Oh well.... Next Superbowl!"
"American lager is certainly not my favorite style, but Stroh's remains my pick among the Megas. Not as tasty as I remember it being, when it was still an independent, but not offensive either."
"Not to get carried away, this is a cheap, thin lager. But it's an exceedingly drinkable cheap, thin lager. Much drier than most corn or rice filled swills, this goes down easy and inoffensive; actually tastes like beer. Cheaper and better than most macros, or even the typical ""premium"" euro-skunk-lager."
"This beer is actually not too shabby, when compared to most domestic macro-swill. It is brilliantly clear, beautifully golden with peach accents, forming a large sea-foam white head atop medium-sized bubbles. Carbonation is moderate, and retention and lacing are actually pretty good. Ah, the delectable aroma...corn, fertilizer (I'm not kidding!), rubbery dirty hops, alcohol, and memories of throwing up on the beach. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth with a thin body. Taste...begins with fermentation by products, middle is mostly harsh alcohols with lots of sugary sweet corn, and the finish is rubbery hop extract...Licking the lips, one tastes chemical bitterness and feels head retention agents. Delicious!"
"Sentimentality aside, this is still a decent beer. Like many others whose first (1000?) beers were Stroh's ""Fire-brewed"" beer, it's hard to forget the glory days. We loved this beer. And it still satisfies much the same as it once did. It pours a yellow to pale gold with a short-lived white head and little lacing. Some hop and malt sensed in smell and taste. Light-bodied, but less watery than many macro brews of the same ilk. Nice finish with some bitterness noted. Better than many macros, the quality is matched to the price."
"Taste was light, slightly bitter at first, followed by a touch of sweet grain. Adjunct taste was not really evident in this beer. Super fizzy mouthfeel which I really did not care for bulldozed itself into the mix. Overall impression of this beer compared to its other macro buddies - A little more hoppier then average, a bit more bitter then most, more carbonation then some, very light in body. Hop heads could dig this beer I suppose, definitely leans more towards bitter then sweet. However, for me, I think I will pass on this in the future."
"Very clean tasting. Without a doubt this was a bargain. It was flavorful and only $7.50 for a 15pk. Great for the style."
"Pours a sligthly darker gold than many macro beers. The bright white, modest head quickly fades away. The aroma is faint and grainy. The taste has a touch of sweetness, with a light malt taste and some bitterness in the finish. A touch of lemon also slides in. The mouthfeel is harsh, with excessive carbonation. The drinkability: well it's drinkable, but not by much. Unlike most macors, it actually inproves a bit as it warms a little. However, the five that I have left may well be my last. For a cheap everyday beer, I'll stick to Rock and Amber Bock. VENOM and proc can have the Stroh's."
"stroh's pours out a clear pale light golden color. a big fizzy head works its way up and dies to nothing in record time. no lace and somewhat light carbonation. it does have a pleasant grassy, grainy and light malty aroma with a just hint of hoppiness. sort of a light, but rough taste. pretty grainy with more grassy flavors. medium-light bodied, not real sweet, but dry. no real adjunct obnoxiousness. a little spritzy in the finish. i can see why some macro swillers would be turned off by the ""dirty"" tastes in this lager. this is a macro with some flavors to think about and has some refreshing qualities too. a step below high life and PBR, but a step above old mil, and coors. more flavor than bud and MGD."
"Stroh's is a cheap beer that doesn't taste too cheap. Better than the Big 3, and infinitely better than their sub-premium brands. Has good flavor and is very drinkable. I would drink this again if I had to."
"Stroh’s Fire Brewed Beer:  I am more than a little surprised at the low rank this beer has.  It is hands down better than the vast run of American macro-lagers, and in fact, is better than most of the skunked out euro-lagers.  The beer is slightly darker than most of its ilk, and I think it has a unique taste that certainly plays down whatever adjuncts it may have (I’ve heard it has none, but I find that hard to believe).  Cripes, in a thirty pack, this beer is well nigh unbeatable, except for its stable mate PBR."
"My college favorite. Always on sale, in the 16oz. I could drink this all night, and pay all day the next day on the throne. It gives you the worst case of gas/diheara. It tastes cheap, barely any hops or malt. Best served cold."
"This is a below average beer but at way below average prices.  This beer goes along with the law 'you get what you pay for' and in the case of stroh's you're not paying much so one shouldn't expect much either.  In the cheap beer category its my third or fourth choice (PBR is MUCH better).  Has a slight hoppiness to it but much stronger in the malt department.  I can see how someone might like this beer but not how they could enjoy it.  It has no appeal other than a cheap way of getting loaded."
"Ahh... the beer of our fathers.  This is a decent beer and beats the coors lights and buds hands down.  This has a golden color with decent head and fairly good retention.  The nose is slightly malty and a hint of hops.  There is a reasonable malt taste and little taste of adjuncts (they're there but not overwhelming).  Not a great beer, barely a good beer, but not too bad.  At the local hick bar, I'll take this over the usual swill."
"Legend has it one of my uncles used to kick back a 30-pack of this every night...one of the freshest and most flavorfull beers I ever had was one in the brewery bar in St. Paul in the mid-to-late 80's...picked up a 15-pack for kicks the other day and thought I'd drop in a review..This has a bit more taste than most macro's but it has a bite to it as well that most macro beer drinkers don't care for...If you try real hard you can get a tich of a caramel flavor....not sure what the fire-brewing does or even if they do it anymore now that Pabst brews it..Overall, its a nice changeup for the every day American lagers available but not one of my favorites."
"12-14-01: When this beer was made in Detroit, it was hands-down better than other U.S. macros. When production shifted out of state, the taste suffered. Pabst has done a decent job of reviving it in recent years, but it is still a notch below what it was years ago. I still have a soft spot for this beer, but it isn't as widely available as it used to be. Good old Detroit Strohs was a very good American Lager."
"Somehow this stuff showed up at the hotel bar of the Hyatt in New Delhi of all places while I was there awhile back. I thought, wow, I can't really think of many beers which would've been a poorer representation of American beer. I chose the Indian beer. This stuff is a quarter notch above the typical mass produced swill."
"This is the lake beer of choice. Moderate body with a bit of hops (a surprise in a macro). Finish is clean without astringency. No overwhelming corn or rice notes, again a surpise in a macro. One of the better mega beers - best ice cold from the cooler."
