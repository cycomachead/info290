"Very light beer, even fresh I got notes of lightstruck. Almost no smell and almost no flavour. Less flavour than a mexican light beer."
"Overall:  Quilmes is a beer that can be appreciated with heavy meals in warm climates."
"Just really uninspiring shit. The sole resemption lies in that if youre swilling this its probably 3 in the morning, youre probably outdoors, and youre likely surrounded by the worlds most breathtakingly gorgeous humans. Vive Argentina!"

"Refreshing Adjunct Lager, not bad when cold, and even though it does not have a character on its own, it is a bit above local average cheap adjunct lagers. Its relative bitterness, a tick above average, partially offsets its sweet corn notes."
""
"There is a bitter aftertaste which grows on you. It certainly is a very drinkable beer, light and good for a session."

"Pours a straw pale yellow with a medium lasting white head. moderate lacing. Aroma and taste is of grains, hay with light malt notes and maize. A light to medium body and mild carbonation on the palate. Finish is sweet mild grains and grassy flavors and light fruity notes. Overall a somewhat muted and bland brew, but ok for a hot summer day."

"Crisp, yes, moderately clean and even with some smoothness to it, this beer is just unoffensive all the way around. If you have your choice of pale/adjunct lagers, this will be better than many of your other (albeit limited) options."

"The appearance isn't anything out of this world, neither is the smell, but the taste is amazing. Very smooth and no nasty after taste. Great for on the beach or at home, give it a shot."

"O: Welp, I just ticked Argentina. Granted, the tick was just another lame macro lager, but who cares?! I ticked a country I never thought I would be able to relatively soon. I'd never want to drink this again, though - even among similar AAL's it blows chunks."
"O: Watery and cold, at best."
""
"I find Quilmes a great beer, even though it is mass produced and distributed. It pours light golden, with little fizzle bubbles, and medium/average head. it has a hoppy taste, with hints of tropical fruits, citric, and rice,. It drinks smooth, with a mild edge, and mild aftertaste. It leaves the plate refreshed and wanting more. It is widely sold in the United States."

"Not enjoyable."
"O: I'll remember this beer better than what this bottle offered. Having a ""chop"" with a big steak is unbeatable."
""
""
"Overall: a decent lager, but I'm a little perplexed by the price of AU$55 - 60 per case of 24 (2013) - seems a bit steep for what is advertised as Argentina's most prevalent beer (i.e. New, VB etc). Certainly not worth the price until someone realises that a standard cheap lager should be... cheap."

"O: Not a bad Pale Lager, with it had a bi t of crispness to offset the lingering sweetness."
""
""
"Another crappy macro lager, though it tilts at the low end of the quality scale. You can taste the corn straight away; fresh out of the fridge. It looks alright, and that's about all it's got going for it. Aroma and flavour are weak and beset by unpleasant off-notes. Watery body. Not good and not recommended - avoid."

"O: Interesting lager – went down smooth – just not a whole lot of flavor."
""
""
"I've had this beer several times. It goes very well with chicken or fish. Has a nice blend of malt and hops. Not too sweet and the hops don't overwhelm your palate. A really nice back porch in the summer brew. This beer compares more than favorably to a Corona for example but it will never be mistaken for a craft beer. And it shouldn't, it's an everyday beer and it kills American lagers such as Bud, Coors etc. It has a decent head, and is a bit thin. That said for this style of beer it rates highly for me."
""
""
"O: This beer doesn’t have a very pleasant smell or taste, both of which seem bland. Other than being relatively easy to drink, the only notable aspect about this beer is that the mouthfeel isn't that bad and it doesn't taste watery."
""

"Poured into a small pilsner glass. Pours pale golden with a white head that dissipates a little slower than the typical adjunct lager. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass. There is a lot of carbonation present in this beer as made evident by abundant streaming bubbles rising in this beer. The aroma is of bready malts with a little bit of sweetness. There's a touch of grassiness from the hops. The flavor is grainy and bready with some sweetness. The hops do provide some mild flavor that's a little grassy. There's not much back end hop bitterness. The body is light with strong carbonation. The beer finishes crisp and clean. This is a highly drinkable beer that is a very good beer overall."

"Poured from a 33cl bottle into a pint glass, best before 11/10/12. This pours a clear light yellow straw color with a small short lived white head. The smells are sweet full of adjuncts, no hops. The feel is light. The taste isn't my cup of tea but better than the american light counter parts, you get some light grass, light hops, mid sweetness."
""
""

"Crisp feel, slightly gassy with CO2, light and fizzy, somewhat watery. Saltines, wafer crackers, bland grains. Simple and not especially flavorful, though clean with no real off flavors. Scrubs the palate nicely when paired with food, in this case Argentine empanadas from Buenos Aires Deli."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden with foamy head. Malty sweet aromas, but an actual hop smell...it almost smells like it was dry hopped. Taste is not bad. A definite malt flavor, but an almost sweet hop and crisp taste. Its way diferent than an American adjunct...its really unique in the ""Adjunct"" style. Worth a try just because its a bit diff than most of the style."

"Another from the chronicles of Central American Lager fest this weekend. Thanks to Roswell the Dog for bringing this back and sharing. Pours a clear golden straw color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly in the July sun. Smells malty sweet and lightly grainy with the faintest of floral hops to provide a hint of balance. The flavor is what I expected, a bit sweet hints of honey almost no hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet grainy mouthfeel. Feels like a light lager, taste like a light lager but really went down easy on a sunny 85 degree day. Not something I'd ever seek out, but glad I got to try it."
""

"330ml bottle. Lager glass. Enjoyed on jul´12. Pale straw color. Clear appearance. White, brief crown. Herbal & yeasty aroma, wet paper odor. Slightly citric, smooth tasting at first sip. Fizzy & grainy. Light body, high carbonation. Earthy bitterness, dry finish. Watery texture. Sweet maltiness on the aftertaste."
""
"O: Not horrible. It's simple an american adjunct lager. Better than most of the domestic premium categories."
""
""
""
"Refreshing,dry on the palate, high carbonation, medium thickness on the body."
""
"O: Very easy to drink and more enjoyable than many others in this style, easily a session beer and probably best served on a warm day when cooking out. Not one of my favorite styles but certainly a decent example."
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable, but there's not much to interest me here."
""
"O - Quilmes is a good contender for ""most drinkable american adjunct," even though it's Argentinian. Very good for session drinking and definitely more enjoyable than other beers of the same type. 2.0"
""
""
"There is not much to say about this beer except that is one of the worst tasting beers that I have ever had. I can taste the corn and  has a grassy after taste it grows skunky by the second....enough said. AVOID"
"The only way to drink it is pressing your nose while drinking and it must be almost frozen so you can not get its real flavor."
""
""
"Drink- Well my boss tried. I dont work with beer drinkers so I got stuck with this one. Wont be coming back to it."
""
"Is what it is and does a decent job of being a SoAmer adjunct lager."
""
""
""
"Could use lots more carbonation."
""

"This is a light golden colored, clear lager with a decent white crown and good lacing. The aroma is a crisp metallic wheat, with rice and oats all evident. The flavor brings on a grapey overtone on the grainy theme noted in the aroma, along with an interesting peppery cinnamon flair. It’s medium light bodied with tiny but aggressive carbonation. Fortunately there’s no “metal” in the flavor and it mellows into a decent grain refreshment. This is another beer du jour for a particular cuisine. I guess every country must have one or two Budweiser beers to bring to the respective restaurants of the world. This was my first Argentinean experience and it was fine for having a grainy brew to wash down your meal. If you’re looking for something special, look elsewhere."
"O - Even for an adjunct lager, this is pretty poor. The sweetness just feels artificial and distracting. None of the other flavor components can overcome this flaw."
"Reviewed @ http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"O - Boring, basic, watery adjunct lager. Lacking in everything."
"D - Boring old humdrum lager. I've had worse, but this really isn't anything too great."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a 1/2 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Frothy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains, corn flakes, and slight sulphur. Taste is pretty faint with some sweet grain and corn flake flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer - nothing great, but nothing offensive really."
"This beer pours crystal clear, and opens up in to a very grassy hops flavor. The flavor itself was fairly bitter, a bit skunky, and not incredibly enjoyable. The beer was a little under-carbonated for an American Lager, making it less enjoyable on a hot summer day. Overall it's a typical macro lager, and left something to be desired considering all the other amazing options from microbreweries in Argentina."
"No better or worse than any other American style macro."
"Dr: Refreshing, but bland. Good for the price, which I think was something around .45 Euro."
"Plenty of graininess in the flavor, but it's agreeable enough. Inoffensive and bland. Mostly lacking character, but the aftertaste is reasonably clean and overall this is at least average for a South American lager from a country more famous for red wine. I wonder how it would go with a steak."
"Why buy a beer from Argentina if you can get one just as bad brewed in the good old US of A? I now have one more country added to my tally on my profile. That's my reasoning, but I'm sure that there are many Argentinians living in the US who grew up on this beer and drink it out of nostalgia...as I do PBR. But as an American, I must apologize for making any country think that this is an acceptable excuse for beer."
"The beer pours a piss yellow with a frothy white head that shrunk into a filmy layer. Smells of sweet adjunct corn beer with hints of lemon. Not much taste, slightly sour lemon with apple in the background. It's light with an average amount of carbonation, finishes like water. For an sandjunct it's not bad, I would drink this over American macros."
"O - Not very impressive. I can only see myself drinking this again if I'm in a situation where someone else brought it along to the party ... and everything else was gone."
"Overall Drinkability - This is like a lager for a cold day, if there was such a thing. Too creamy to make a good refreshing, crisp summer lager. Not interesting. Very mediocre at best."
"The last couple sips showed the best it had to offer. Drink it either ridiculously cold or wait til the glass/bottle ain't so cold to the touch."
"D- very easy, but in a big bottle."
"This isn't a bad beer. Surprised me. If I had only a choice between this and BMC...it would be this"
"Very pale straw colored with lots of large carbonation bubbles. Crystal clear, white head that produces a fair amount of lace. Excellent head retention. Grainy/earth aroma with some detectable sweetness. I smell mortar (the stuff used for concrete). Very bland over the entire palate with the exception of some bitterness in the back end. If any flavors predominate it would be cereal with a touch of aluminum. Artificial sweetener sensation after the finish. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Light body."
"Drink is OK, not great, very watery on a hot day, but skunk flavors don't help."
"I was at an Argentinian restaurant in New York City. I saw a bottle with a blue label above the bar and the waitress told me it was an Argentinian beer. I figured I may as well and try it, since I've never had a beer from that country. Pours a light yellow colour with very thin white head. Head dissipates pretty quickly, leaving no lacing. Smells grainy and a little bit metallic. The metallic flavour seems to last in the aftertaste, though it was fairly faint. I don't notice any hops or bitterness. Carbonation wasn't over-the-top as with many lagers, which made this smooth to drink. I could see the appeal of this in a hot climate, but not in January in NYC."
"A pretty boring, unimpressive beer, not that it taste bad but why drink it? Very pale, slight hops with an orange smell and a tart balance. Taste pretty much like nothing, only the slightest and bland, hints of hops and malts. Feels like water in the mouth and goes down as such."
"D: nothing to write home about and proving once again that I have never had a fantastic South American beer. Save your money for something better. Typical BMC quality about it."
"I've yet to try the other varieties, but I'd like to try a pumpkin one if they made it."
"D: intensely boring. I don't think I could pick this out of a lineup of national beers of South American countries, or the national beers of North America for that matter."
"With all the individual flaws built into the flavor and aroma profile, the sum of the parts kinda come together for a more pleasant drinking experience than you'd think. Still, the popularity of this beer is beyond me."
"overall not terrible but i will have to pass."
"Easy enough to drink, but best described as lightly beer flavored seltzer water."
"Good drinkability if you like basic / safe / standard beer that's good for washing down food or mass consumption. Again, it's just very basic overall."
"Drinkability: this beer is a middle-of-the-road adjunct. It's light and refreshing, but the weird plasticy character is not something I like. Eh."
"drinkability is low cause I will never have one again."
"Drinkability: There's nothing necessarily wrong with this beer, but it is far from outstanding and, being an import, isn't necessarily worth its usual price. If this were domestic and a lot cheaper, I may have it again. Surely this is very drinkable, but not worth it."
"I know Argentina has a sizable European population - too bad their ""favorite beer"" falls along similar European populist lines. Overall, Quilmes is macro-heavy in its bearing, and not worth a deflated peso on its own."
"O: Medium drinkability. Not that bad for an adjunct lager, however, the corny end compromises its drinkability"
"nothing special going on here, one way to knock a country of your list but other then that not worth trying"
"D: The aftertaste of this beer is just horrible. I struggled trying to finish just one bottle."
"Bottle, pours a pale golden colour, with a thick head that doesn't hold long, but it keeps a think layer all the time. Smells of grain with a hint of lemon, taste exactly the same, with some metallic notes. Good carbonation,medium body. Just a refreshing beer, I could have some of them in the summer if it wasn't for the metallic thing."
"D - I don't know how this beer can clock in at almost 5%. There is NOTHING to it! Still, I hate to say it, but there isn't anything off-putting about this beer which makes it really quite drinkable, especially on a hot day. But honestly, I'd rather have water. It tastes better."
"Crystal clear and golden in colour with a massive foamy white head and an abundance of carbonation. The aroma is light with a mild graininess, with hints of lemon (very light) and a biscuity malt. The taste is clean and crisp, however, it lacks something in the taste, there is not a great deal to the flavour. It's is hard to describe the taste, it is simply bland and cardboardy. Not a beer I would go out of my way to buy."
"I'm judging this brew on how it compares to others of its style. It's a light golden color I haven't seen for a while with a copious amount of carbonation. The aroma has some corn and a bit of hops. The taste is corn with a bit of a tang. The tang is reduced with further enjoyment and becomes rather likeable. Growing up in Iowa, you come to love the taste of corn, so having it in my beer is a nice treat. It isn't a complex brew for analyzing and searching for the meaning of life in, just to enjoy."
"A better beer in my quest for a great lager."
"Look: Bright yellow color, small foamy head with half a finger thick, lots of bubbles and medium lacing; Smell: Corn and some hops with grass notes; Taste: Corn, corn and more corn, some sweet malt at the finish; Mouthfeel: Refreshing and high carbonation; Drinkability: Good thirst quencher, the only beer from Argentina i've tried."
"Very pale yellow. Incredibly thin and watery looking. Big head that takes up over half the pint glass. Metalic grainy canned pea smell. You can find a tiny amount of hops if you are looking for them. Taste is very light and watery. Ok clean slightly bitter aftertaste. This is the Argentinian High Life. Don't look for anthing other than a light fizzy watery yellow beer. Having said all that, it's not that bad. I could pound quite a few of these if giving the chance. And I've drank beer from another continent. That's always cool."
"D - I think the best way to put it is that this may be the Argentinian version of Bud Lite. Drinkable low alcohol beer, but flavor-seekers need not apply."
"beer overall in my opinion is still a ""D" if not ""F+"" either way STAY AWAY!"
"D: Really not a bad little lager. I'd much rather drink this than Bud or Coors or Miller."
"Overall - Better than most Latin American lagers, but wouldn't go out of my way to buy."
"Not a very impressive beer. Pours very clear, with a small nice white head. Smells like corn and malt. Tastes like it ... well, like most major American beers watered down. Overall it does seem to be a great summer beer if weather was right and it was cold enough. There is a light malty, hoppy taste in it that reminds me that I am drinking a beer. Not something that I would go out of the way to get, or even get again."
"Overall a full bodied adjunct lager. Not as easy to drink as most."
"This beer is a small step up from the usual macro fare. I bought a six pack, but was glad when it was all gone. Not a beer I'll be spending money on again."
"Pours a clear, yellow color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of adjunct, yeast, grain, and pale malt. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, adjunct, grain, slight hop, slight metallic, and some pale malt. Overall, a smooth bodied and easy drinking beer, but not much else."
"Taste: Simple and straightfoward, nothing fancy about it. Just a solid and drinkable example of the style. Grassy with a light bitterness."
"Wouldn't drink this if I were in Argentina, the local beer is bound to be better."
"D: Not that pleasant. No better than any number of mediocre beers of this type. The mineral flavors in the middle were this beer's one way of standing out. Unfortunately, those flavors were unpleasant. I guess this would be an OK summer quencher if served ice cold. I'll pass."
"Drinkability: Also, like the mass markets, this beer is easy to drink all day long, and with the low alcohol content and the afternoon siesta, nothing is stopping you."
"Brown bottle poured into a weizen glass. Has a slightly dark golden color and a fairly weak aroma. It has a good but not very strong flavor with no aftertaste. Somewhat watery in the mouth. Drinkability is good especially in warmer weather. A decent but not great beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Pale yellow/golden color with a thin white head. Smells faintly of grain, maybe a little grassy aroma as well. Tastes very dry with a slightly metallic finish. Faint grainy malts dominate the palate. There's just not a lot too this beer. It's pretty inoffensive but not all that interesting. Drinks fairly easy but I can't say I was itching to have another one after this, especially at import prices."
"Hey, it's not bad, but neither is it huge or spectacular. Pretty drinkable though."
"Drinkability - As drinkable as water."
"Mouthfeel is painfully thin. Drinkable? Yeah, well water's drinkable. Confuckulations."
"D- Nothing to write home about. This import is the closest in style to the American macros that I've had in a long time. It's price was on par with much of the BMC at the bottle shop, so it's got that going for it. That and it's pretty refreshing on a warm evening."
"Overall, like I said if everyone is drinking it and it is so cheap, why not?"
"This is a great import beer. Not too heavy of a taste, but the elements that are there are tied together nicely and make a delicious beer. It is extremely easy drinking and would go down smooth and refreshing on a summer day. From the moment I cracked this bottle I was in love. What a good buy."
"I tried it a few more times and I still loved it. I know there isn't much going on with this beer, but this is my opinion and I think it is an excellent macro beer. I would drink this over Sam Adams Light any day (it kind of reminds me of that). Give this beer a second try if you get the chance and really examine it this time."
"The taste is corn and bread with a nice malt back. Not too bad if you expect nothing but Busch Light with a touch of Presidente! Quilmes feels clean, crisp and NOT overly carbonated. It says something about a beer if you can drink two of them after playing basketball for two hours and find them as refreshing as gatorade, right? Well, I for one was pleasantly surprised by this beer. For my money, it's the best mass market South of the border beer there is. Only Bohemia (Mexico) and Belikin (Belize) come close. As such, this beer gets the highest possible marks for drinkability so long as it is taken for what it is. This is the Two and Half Men of beer."
"Poured into a pint glass. Beer is light blonde in color, completely translucent, with ample carbonation. No head really, just a very thin sheet of white fizz. Nose is grains and grains, not much else. Beer is watery with mild bread taste. About what I expected which doesn't make it good, however, if you want something you can drink a lot of, it will work."
"Drinkability: If you can drink water, you can drink this beer."
"Notes: well, i think the only other adjunct ive had was a leinie. so in that context, and being from argentina, not a bad job i guess."
"I know that I reviewed this here years ago and it's gone. Eh?"
"Appears a crystal clear pale yellow bright white head forms thick with large bubbles and a thin lacing forms spradically with each methocdical sip. Aroamtics offer up light cereal notes, light cooked veggies and a mild sweet sugar coated pastry. Flavor provides creamy sweetness with a touch of lemon grass in the finish, very thirst quenching offering along with the cooked veggies and creamy corn accents. Definitely not overbearing on the palate. Mouthfeel is light bodied with a spritzy natured carbonation, bringling clean finished with no residuals noted easily unchallenging to the senses much like co2 the watery texture adds to the unrefined and non complex finish. Drinkability is overall very enjoyable but it definitely is not remarkable a beer I dould reach for on a sunny day to quench my thirst but that's about it."
"Pours translucent gold, thin white head that doesn't retain well. Aromas of malt and corn. Simple. On the palate this bear is watery with an almost artificial malt sweetness, with more corn, and rather thin bodied. Easy drinking, almost no hops, but certainly would prefer this over any BMC offering at the office party with limited selections."
"drinkable pretty much year round in Texas, easily a session beer, not much flavour, but what are you comparing it to? If I had to choose between this and mass produced Budweiser, Coors and Miller this would get the nod. A bit of a corn kinda feel to it, like Presidente (from Dominican Republic if I remember right)"
"Pours a clear yellow color with a decently frothy white head. Now thats an unpleasant nose if you ask me. Stankin corny roasted malt, sweaty, stale, metallic, machine-like funk, corn flakes and a biscuit like sweetness going on. I get limes initially on the tongue, grassy and floral, this beers got some hop character to it, even if its not such a pleasant one. Tingly in the mouth, a bit too over carbonated, in turn making what little malt character this beer has drop right off the face of the earth mid palate. The after taste is nothing but whiffs at bitterness. I guess this would be a refreshing beer on a hot day but im not going to stick around to find out."
"easy to drink adjunct larger a very standard example of the style."
"Not much of any smell excepting a slight super sweet malty (rice?) smell. Pours to a pale yellow with a big bubble head that recedes fast but stays on the surface. Taste is sweet with hopping only in the far background at the start then coming towards the front in the end. Mouthfeel is very good, smooth with no overpowering carbonation. Overall, too sweet for me! If this is Argentina's favorite beer, as stated on the bottle, I think they know alot about wine, but are painfully ignorant when it comes to beer."
"I got this as part of a beer sampler pack, and this was the Argentinian choice. I guess as a lawn-mower beer, it could work. But my advice? Drink this one cold, and fast."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Lager."
"Poured into a pint glass. Same old pale lager straw color with a fizzy white head. No lacing. Aroma is corn syrupy sweet with little grain. Corn syrup flavored mineral water with a touch of alcohol? Blech. This is almost cheap malt liquor bad. No coincidence that the name is almost 'Kill me.'"
"OK lager taste, but nothing stood out and grabbed me with this beer. The 4.9% wasn't to be found either, it wasn't wishy-washy, but it wasn't a full bodied little babe you could cuddle up too."
"D: I could drink a lot, but I'm glad I only bought one. OK, no big imperfections that tend to stick ouot in this style...just nothing special. (I hope there are craft brewers in Argentina)"
"The taste also is light but thoroughly pleasant with a hint of complexity, but it is lighter than the aroma. It has light grain, lemon, 7-up, and herbal hoppy bitterness that is light but persistent and just dominates the finish. It's clean, crisp, and very easy to drink. The main problem is that the taste is too light and thin, which is too bad because what I can taste is good."
"Drinkability: Shamefully watery. Great for rinsing out your glass for the next beer - hopefully one with some actual flavor and character."
"Watery and awful. Drain pour."
"Pours a very light pale color with a small almost non existent head. Smells of corn and not much malt. First sip is tad bitter with an ok hop presence but not much flavor. Very light bodied with average carbonation. Very typical for beers from South America. Not enough flavor to be called a ""beer""."
"A 330 cc bottle of Quilmes cristal cerveza. Light golden color with a decent head. The bottle was a little warmer than ""ice cold"" which turned out to be unfortunate. A bad malty and unpleasant palate with a corn background. Probably would have been better if it was colder, but as is I didn't enjoy."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light, fizzy yellow beer mouthfeel...as it should be. Carbonation is high and scrubs the palate. As afore mentioned it finishes dry. This is quite easy to drink and is, in fact, one of the better macros I've drank. On the other hand this isn't one that I'd buy again....for 9.99 a sixer its overpriced for what you're getting. It is better than the majority of macros, but not so much better as to offset the price. A nice one to try, if you want to see what a pretty decent macro is like, but overall not worth the repeated buy. Macros have their place...though they all taste so similar that one can easily be substituted for the other....especially with food pairings, or the after the lawn beer. This one is too much money for pretty much the same product. I'm torn on the drinkability of this one because it is a higher end macro, but on the other side it is overpriced as well."
"Certainly a good beer for a hot, Summer day..."
"Its a plain kind of lager-- but no major defects in execution, so that alone beats a lot of macros. Still, its mostly uninteresting in the taste department. If I ever find myself in Argentina, I won't turn this down as a thirst quencher; but I won't be seeking out much otherwise."
"D: I could put down a ton of these, but I really wouldn't want to. It is however better than most of the macro lagers out there."
"Besides Bud, this one reminds me of Red Stripe as well. Have to wonder about the commonality of their brewing processes."
"Overall this was a suprise from Argentina, I was quite pleased with this one. I did not know what to expect, but I did not have my hopes up for this one. Over all a good feel in a beer. and would gladly drink it again. If they offered it in Oklahoma, but I bought it in Austin"
"Drinkability: Bad. I'd sell this to minors to teach them that underage drinking is wrong."
"D: Gets a bit more bitter and metal as you drink. Starts out really good though. I'm not mad at myself for buying it."
"Drinkability is utterly worthless. I had absolutely no desire whatsoever to finish this beer. No reason to drink this. I'm not sure if I can think of another beer I'd drink less than this - I would even drink Michelob Ultra before this, or just plain water."
"Avoid. I will."
"An acceptable beer, but has absolutely nothing in the flavour department!"
"M/D- Very dry and not very smooth as it goes down. It is very watered down and not very flavorful. Nothing more to report on this end. This would be a beer that the average person would enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is pretty clean and crisp. Tight carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. Would be even better in a cafe in Buenos Aries."
"Light yellow watery color with medium lasting white head. Smell is malty and yeasty. Became stronger as it warmed. Taste is light flavored and bodied, with a malt biscuity yeasty flavor. A touch doughy flavored for me, but drinkable when cold. Nothing special here."
"Argentina is pretty hot right? Well this would be quite refreshing in the heat, but so would a cool glass of water. I wouldn't turn this beer down, but there really is very little to it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Goes down smooth enough since it's so watered down. Perhaps tolerable on a very hot day. Even then, there's much, much better to choose from. Overall, not impressive."
"A decent beer, considering it's 'classmates'. I'd certainly try one over Brahma if in SA, but I woun't be running to my preferred beer store begging him to stock this one either"
"Pours a clear straw gold. Good sized white head, but it falls very fast. Nose is typical, but no skunky attributes or metallic tones at all. Slight earthy tone going on. Flavor is very uneventful. Just typical macro lager style. Minimal flavor impact. Still though, it isn't total garbage. Feel has a good amount of carbonation on it. Typical liquid feel. Drinkable sure. It is what it is. I am sure it would be even better if I was stuck somewhere in Argentina and no Duvel was to be found anywhere. Decent enough to try, but no great shakes here. Way better than most macro crap, though."
"Would not drink this again or recommend this beer unless you are just curious to try a cheap beer that you never heard of like I did"
"D - Not too bad but not too good. Just another run of the mill import lager."
"Pours a pale golden color with a decent amount of creamy white head that fades away fairly quickly, leaving a thin layer on top. Smells a little yeasty and vaguely hoppy. The taste is very clean, but fairly well balanced. I'm not tasting any malt though. Just some nondescript sweetness and just enuff bitterness to balance it out. Mouthfeel is tingly with some carbonation burn on the tongue, and otherwise pretty light and airy. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer, probably real nice on a hot day."
"While not a great beer, this was not actually too bad, especially for a South American beer."
"Quilmes pours a golden yellow color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There's not much to the aroma, some grainyness. The taste is grainy, a bit grassy, maybe even a bit hoppy. Nothing special, but on the other hand a respectable beer for a Latin American brewery. Worth a try."
"Not interested in having again, but not substantially better or worse than a lot of other macro lagers, and a better body than some. Pass."
"Drinkability- Alright in a pinch. It is good cold and some what refreshing."
"... ""relax and enjoy life"" ..."
"Overall: made for the masses. Too watery and boring to justify a second try."
"Overall, this is a pretty standard American lager. It's not horrible, but not really remarkable - just kind of there. I perceive a certain amount of malt adjuncts that make it somewhat unappealing to my palate and while this is indicative of the style, it should not be the most notable characteristic in my opinion."
"This is the kind of beer you might expect to be popular - light, fizzy, crisp, and quaffable. Although corn is detectable, there are no major off-flavors in this brew. The result is a semi-sweet beer with a slap of crisp bitterness on the tongue. A decent imported brew that I could suck on for awhile, this goes for $5.69 a sixer at the local BevMo. I could drink it for awhile, but one sample from the Traveler's pack will do me just fine."
"Drinks alright despite all the weird things going on here. I'm sure this is better if tried closer to the source & fresher. I'd still take this over BMC any day"
"Overall, not bad, but really not too good. It isnt offensive, but i would have liked more of a crispness to it, which it did not have."
"This one seemed boring to me, even for an American Macro Lager. The finish is very clean, with very little flavor beforehand. At least other Maco Lagers have a little more character to them than this."
"Perhaps on a very hot day by the beach, but I really disagree with the overall rating - it is not worth a try."
"Drinkability - not an import I'd buy when there are so many low-budget, similar tasting alternatives in the macro market. A lawn mower beer at best, not a bad thing necessarily."
"Drinkability is good since it is smooth enough to down a few after work without much strain."
"D: Not too much too my liking, but did have some positive characteristics. Taste wasn't up my alley. Nothing really negative to say about this beer besides its not really anything for me."
"This is not good beer, even for the style. I picked up a six-pack of this because I never had beer from Argentina. I wasn't missing anything in this case. Save this one for the macro-drinkers."
"The flavor is nothing to rave about, but I'm surprised that this brew could offend anyone. It's a pleasant, light bodied Lager. Nothing to dislike. The light malt body offers some tastes of herbal malt grain with a dose of sugary sweetness. I would have preferred a bit more hoppy (any kind) bitterness, but it is what it is."
"Salud !"
"This is what you might expect as an Argentinian export. It is a pale lager. It has slight malt flavor and is effervescent. It has little hop flavor and is drinkable in small quantities or more if you want to become bloated. The color is suitable for the style and is formidible with little aroma and light body."
"A pale yellow color, a slight white head forms and disappears quickly; really, really, really quickly. No real aroma, slight scents of hoppiness but, very faint. The taste is nada, zilch, a goose egg, totally non-existant taste. The feel is thinner than water, enough said. This beer is NOT a very drinkable beer, period."
"Pours with a three finger head that fades quickly leaving no lace. Chrystal clear light amber color. Very light carbonation and light bodied. Hoppy nose. Starts slightly hoppy with a corn husk flavor, aftertaste has a slight bitterness. Another one just for the country. 12 oz bottle part of mixed 6-pak for $7.99 from Friar Tuck's Peoria, Il."
"Quilmes was something of a surprise. I know it'll never happen, but BMC should take a few cues from some of the better 'world beer' that makes it our shores. This Argentinian product would be a great place to start."
"I kind of feel silly now, after having written such a rambling explanation about why I bothered to try this beer, in spite of its rather poor ratings. Seriously, this ain't bad in the least."
"Argentines need to step up, in my opinion. They've got some up-and-coming wines, so why don't they have a good beer to match? There's enough German immigrants there to help get the brews going."
"The beer pours a rich golden with a light head. There is a light smell. The taste was crisp and refreshing but it had a tiny after taste. The beer is light and does not linger in your mouth. Over all it's drinkable beer but I wouldn't go out of my way to get a bottle."
"Overall I thought a slightly better than usual macro lager, and whilst not reaching great heights stands as a satisfactory beer"
"is smooth in taste, not like water but is indeed very light"
"This beer poured a light yellow, carried a half inch, pure white head that left lacing along the glass as I drank it. Though I know that this is a macro, I found it a cut above the American macros. Unlike American macros, this beer still resembled a pilsner, which all macros purport to be. Don't believe the bad rankings. Though by no means the best beer around, this is about as enjoyable as a macro can get."
"The Quilmes pours a clear light golden color, with about an inch fizzy head. It smells mainly like adjuncts and there's also a slightly metallic smell (weird considering it's a bottled beer). There's a sweet grainy taste to the beer, pretty much the same taste as most macros out there. However it's light bodied and non-offensive, and it goes down really, really easy. It's appropriate that I'm drinking this out of a Budweiser glass, because that's what Quilmes reminds me of. On a hot day I could down a few of these, but there's many other beers out there I'd rather drink. If you're a fan of macro beers, then Quilmes is as good of a choice as any out there."
"The pour is a medium gold, so it's darker than BMC, barely. The white head lasts through the first half of the glass before fade to a thin ring. I can hardly pick out any aromas from the faint nose. Maybe sweet malts and corn. The flavor is crisp, clean and very weak, but at least it's not offensive. This is hardly a beer to accompany Argentina's meaty cuisine."
"Eric"
"Clear gold color. Smell is herbal grassy skunkiness. Very subdued however.You can smell some adjuncts like corn too but it isnt too bad. The taste is just a basic gold colored beer--certainly more flavor than our own bud and this is likely the bud of Argentina.For the style this is a pretty good one. Quite swillish but I still think its decent."
"*Note* BA indicates this is a 6.5% ABV beer. If that were true it would make this beer a little more worth drinking. Unfortunately the label reveals that the ABV is in fact 4.9%."
"Drinkable but nothing special."
"Bought a six pack of these in Mexico for 17 pesos (about $1.50USD) what a dea! So I was not expecting much here.. For the price this is not bad.. Crisp, light malt aroma, where is the aroma? Watery with some noticable hops. Clean but bland. Some lacing noted. There is just very little here. The flavor is just as bland, with perhaps a vague grainy sweetness with a light bitter aftertaste. Refreshing on a hot day, due to its watery character... better than a bud !!"
"Flavor is not much better, grainy sweet with a light bitter finish. Better than BMC but not by much."
"Well, another good lager beer for hot days. IT is not that great, but is good for refreshing. Very crystal and light Yellow. Although I got i a little frozen. IS the most comercial beer in Argentina, and there is even a Football team with that name, and a lot fo teams has the QUILMES name in the T-Shirts."
"Sorry for the belived most handsome people´s inthe word they have the worst beer sell in mexico, its remarked grains flavor made worst, its patagonian hops not help its flavor, but in general is good only one or two no more, they give a several head pain and cruda"
"As I've said before, one of the hazards of country collection is knowing that 90% of the countries are going to feature the same boring adjunct lager as their national beer, so I'm not surprised about Quilmes. If I ever went to Argentina, this might be worth having in the spirit of ""When in Rome..."" , but here in the US this is another one I wouldn't bother with again."
"I'll avoid this one as long as I can."
"""Argentina's favorite beer"" pours a crystal clear pale straw-gold body beneath a short head of bright white foam that holds well and leaves some nice splashes of spotty lace about the glass. The nose is displays lightly sweetish, adjunct enhanced malt and just the barest essence of grassy hops. In the mouth it's crisp with a slightly elevated carbonation (@ 2.57-2.6) and medium light body. The flavor displays more hops than the nose suggests, but it's still very basic. Surprisingly, there's a touch more hop bitterness than might be expected, and it finishes dry with some quickly fading sweet malt."
"Absolutely tasteless, anonimous, and completely useless."
"The beer after its decapitation sets in the glass a limpid light gold with a modest bright white head that is frothy in texture and quite short lived, the lace left behind a velum like sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is as expected, malt, crisp and clean start somewhat sweet and lightly malted, top thin as water. Finish is moderately carbonated, the hops light but present, dry aftertaste."
"I'd pick this brew of the Pampas over the legion of light Mexicans with spicy food.And if this is the Budweiser of Argentina it is a better Bud. All relative, I guess."
"Sampled at the Southside Beer Expo, Frankfort, IL. Well, I may be sampling this just so I can finally claim to have had a South American beer. But this does have a little more character than the standard pale ale. Served a little warm, it demonstrates a bit more hoppiness and a few good malt notes than the standard megabrew. Just not too much more. Insert your joke about Argentinians and Germans here."
"I long ignored this beer, figuring its lack of positive reputation said enough. My wife brought one home, so I had to try it. It pours the same pale yellow as the bulk of mass-produced American lagers. It also has the decidedly nondescript smell of most mass-produced American lagers. The most noticeable smell is a grassy aroma; hops are lurking far offstage somewhere. The taste? Just like a mass-produced American lager. Again, a grassy flavor and also some metallic taste. It's not quite bad enough for a drain-pour, but it's close."
"12oz. Bottle: I saw this and decided to try a beer from a country that I had not yet sampled one of their beers. It pours into the glass a plae yellow color, and is pretty clear. A big white head that fizzes down rapidly. There is a good bit of carbonation to the beer. There is a sweetness to the nose, but it is mostly just sweet with a general lack of character. Maybe a hint of honey. The taste is definitely light. There is a bit of a sweetness to the taste, with a slightly dry finish. Incredibly non-descript and forgettable."
"Looking for something new and interesting from a country I have not sampled, I found this at the local pub. It poured a pale yellow color with a finger of head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was slightly honey-sweet with a healthy dose of corn and a slight noble hop spice. The flavor was pretty pedestrian. A slight graineyness and corn flavor without a real hop character. The feel was thin, almost like a bubbly water. Not a great beer. The flavor is lacking along with the feel. I won't be having this again."
"Not much to recommend this over other beers. Probably their attempt to be budweiser. Nothing horrendous, mind you, just nothing interesting."
"Would not have even picked this up for curiosity sake unless no other option would be available. This time, I received it in a Beers of the Worlds gift pack and complemented with some Mexican take out. It's better than a Corona or any commericalized beer, but not by much. Tastes of light corn and little hops. Okay carbonation and lacing (who knows how long it's been on the store shelf). Try something else."
"Luckily, from the outset, I didnt expect much. So, I wasnt disappointed when I got exactly what I expected. The beer is very clear, yellow in color, has a nice white (typically sized) head. My bottle seemed to have a bit less carbonation than similar American-style lagers. Faint, almost non-existent aromaprimarily composed of adjunct and vegetable smells. Very faint hops in the smell, provided you really look for them. Soft, and slightly sweet, but also thin, watery, and weak. Finish is clean, but devoid of much taste. On par with most American macros."
"It featured a standard, factory-grade, anemic, gray-colored fizz on top. It went away quickly. The aromas told of accelerated fermentation : grain; sugar; and alcohol. Bland and dry, it served up impressions of rice pancake and mineral water. Very Bud Light-like in it's candied, thin flavor profile. Stale, freeze-dried pea flavors lurked on the finish. This was the most tasteless imported beer I've ever consumed -- utterly meaningless."
"You always walk a fine line when buying a beer just because it is from a new country. I knew this wouldnt be good, but darn it I wanted to try an Argentinian beer! I am sure I am not the only one. Pours a clear pale gold color with a thin white head that lasted pretty long. Thin lacing. The aroma is lightly hopped. Thin-bodied and adjunct-ridden with a weak hops and malt flavor struggling to be noticed. The finish is clean but nearly flavorless. I have definitely had worse but this beer really serves no purpose other than being from Argentina."
"Pours a bright clear yellow with large bubbles in a 1"" head (I don't like large bubbles). Aroma is of burnt grain, oily with a slight hop touch. Flavor is moderate grainy, with slight hops at the end. Processed flavor with alightly sweet nutty notes. Very easy to drink, but mainly because there isn't much going on. Fuller and richer that standard US macrobrews, but that's about it."
"I really like this beer for sitting around telling lies and eating BBQ. I will most certainly pick some more up to have on hand."
"The beer has the words The Favorite Beer of Argentina on it. WTF?? Who is gong to believe that crap, oh shit I did, and thats why I picked up a bottle! On reflection, the advertising slogan sounds like The Favorite Child of Michael Jackson or The Favorite Battle Cry of France; no-one is going to believe it is either good, or even for real. Sure enough, its neither. Could this be South American AB (Argentine Bud)? Maybe!"
"Super drinkable brew, it goes down fast. Nothing offensive about this but it IS low flavor compare the craft brews that most here are used to. Not a beer I would seek out again but it is a good food-chasing brew."
"The high appearance marks are related to the consistent liveliness of the carbonation, fine bubbles and holding of the head in the glass."
"Overall: As a pilsner lover, I don't love this beer"
"This beer has no taste at all it just goes down fast and easy, pretty clear and crisp. Hopy smell and a lttle malty. It reminds me of alot of the other Latina American beers that have mad it big in the US (Corona, Dos X) in the sense that it should be consumend if you are going to fry under the sun. Good substitute for water."
"I thought Ultra was the most flavorless beer I'd run across. Here, it has met its match. Aroma - well, if water has an aroma, this smelled about the same. As for flavor - no malt, no hops - about all I got was some vague olive-juice sourness. I had no idea that a beer could have some an utter absence of flavor. If this is Argentina's favorite beer, heaven help me if I ever have to go there."
"Big pour -- tiny, fizzy head. Gone in 30 seconds. Clear, pale gold beer. Smell is somewhat nutty. Front is sourish; middle is thin, tangy, sourish; finish is slightly bitter, chemically. There are some nice grains in the aftertaste. This isn't great, but it's not completely unpleasant."
"ng"
"Carbonation good but not over the top, about right there. Flavour not so much, quite insipid in fact. A bit of hoppiness for a nanosecond fades into very little; as much aftertaste as a bottle of spring water. No nasty chemical or processed tastes that I could detect, though. A fine beer to choose for a summer thirst quencher (apart from the smell, maybe) but little else. Adios..."
"The flavor is a different story and not one I'm pleased to tell, as this brew has an off taste that is just not that pleasant. An off-putting pungent flavor invades the palate and lingers far too long. Just not sweet nor sour but rather strong and pushy. The feel is acidic and peppery. Not one I'll go back to again."
"My girlfriend allowed me the honor of sampling her bottle of this at the Brickskellar. Poured a pale golden color with a thin, foamy head that was gone in a few seconds. Big bubbles, I think this one had been sitting in their cooler for a few months. About the only thing it had going for it was its lack of skunk, though. Very light, thin body, with almost absolutely no flavor. There's just not much to this one. Maybe if I were in Argentina and needed a thirst quencher I'd drink it, but there's absolutely no reason to have one here."
"Lager??Reminds me of my favorite beer style.NOT!!A small sized creamy white head with fine-small sized bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was carbonated and clear with a yellow hue.The nose was malty, hoppy and fruity with a hoppy flavor.The mouthfeel was tingly, thin, watery and medium bodied.The lacing was very sparse."
"An average lager. pours a pale golden tone with a slight foam head. The smell is not very present but shows a few hops. The taste, sweet and somewhat bitter reflects some maltyness which leaves behind no bad aftertaste. A good south american beer, above the average and always a good purchase in the region."
"A little sourness and hints of hops that are very reminiscent of about 90 percent of all Latin American beers made in the pilsener style that I've tried."
"Drinkability/notes: Severely lacking in character, though not offensive, it could just as well be Miller Lite or Amstel. Greatly overpriced at $6.99 for a six-pack."
"Pours a pale golden straw color with a pillowy fluffy white head that fades into a semi-sticky creamy lace. Nose is sweet malts and a bit of stale grains. Very light in body with a good amount of active carbonation. Taste is sweet malts and grains at first followed by some sulfur notes. A pretty boring beer overall. This is my first time sampling an Argentinean beer. I hope their other brews have more depth."
"I was expecting something interesting from this beer, since I have never had an argentine beer before. But I came to find out that it is average at best. The beer had a decent frothy white head that lasted for a little bit and then settled into a small white lace for the rest of the glass. The smell did nothing for me, and was a little sour. The taste was average at best, and reminded me a little of the usual macro beers available in the U.S. It would be easy to pound back a few of these but it is nothing that would be very enjoyable to the palate."
"Quilmes, from Argentina:  pale golden colored beer, with a thick white rocky head, with great staying power and lace.  Sweet, light bodied beer.  The first few sips are unusual, but the taste seemed to improve as the beer warmed up slightly.  Clean dry aftertase, all in all not too bad, but the price (almost $8.00 for a six) ensured I’ll not be buying this again."
