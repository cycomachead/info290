Light banana aroma, not picking up much else. Not very flavorful. Tastes like a decent balance of sugar and bitterness. Also tasting banana, but not much else. Very straightforward, much expected from a large brewery. Feels watery, and lacks any grit or tack. Almost oily quality. Overall, easy to drink, but lacking in complexity. I like to keep some in fridge for when I want to catch a buzz, but can no longer appreciate a more decent beer. Boo for use of GMO corn, but can't expect much else from cheap beer. At least it doesn't give me a headache like other macrobrews.","sporklift87","Mar 18, 2015"

For whatever reason, it disappeared until the last couple of years. It amazes me that people pay nearly $30 for a dozen Banquets in Alberta. For a mass produced lager, this is as good as it gets. It looks like beer, smells like a vegetable garden, and has a surprisingly refreshing taste. This batch cost me $21 for a 30 pack, so I'm planning to make it last for the rest of the month.

This sample is straight from the brewery. During tour of the brewery at Golden, CO they had us sample some of the beer coming straight from the source. It was crisper and much more fresh tasting (obviously) than that swill you buy to drown your consciousness on the cheap. Somewhere between the brewery and your local Kappy's, this decent ale degrades significantly into under-the-table beer.","PrimeLion","Jun 03, 2014"

To me this is how brew should look. It is not to light in color and not to dark. The smell rich with flavor, also smells like beer. The taste is rich and smooth. There is nothing bad about this brew. Coors has a nice clean finish. This brew has a real nice balance to taste and smoothness. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Coors is a good drinking brew, and a classy brew at that. This is how beer should be. Not overly light and not so alcohol taste that you can not enjoy the brew. Over all I'm giving Coors a 4.25 out of 5.","nicholas2121","May 27, 2014"

How many Banquets have you been to, where the food alright or good but certainly wasn't exceptional? Myself, not a lot as the cooks generally need to make enough food quickly for everyone. See the parallel on this one? So Coors is an alright beer, but if not for being a large producer whose name you cannot escape, it is a rather unremarkable beer. It's certainly not an unquaffable brew, but really this beer exemplifies a just plain average beer.","TheHammer","Apr 22, 2014"

Surprisingly, there was no metallic taste with this beer, it is watery, and has a malty, corn taste. It is not filling and goes good with food. Nothing sets it apart from other big brands, other than it is the last wholly own big brand company because Miller (SABMiller) and AB (InBev) are both foreign controlled.","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","Apr 10, 2014"

It has way more flavor and a little more body than a Coors Light, which for some reason is extremely popular around here. It goes really well with grilled meat.","archyquaffer","Mar 11, 2014"

Aroma is sweet for an adjunct lager, with a lot of corn and some subtle hop extract that veers towards the fruity. Palate is rounded cornflake sweetness, a touch of green weedy hops, a hint of butter, and some harsh notes that recall a chemical sweetener like aspartame. Body is thin and soda-like as per the style but finish is less astringent than rice adjunct beers like Bud. My ratings might be a tad higher than deserved but Coors is probably the best in a bad bunch of industrial lagers and at least this one has more flavor than many mainstream Euro pale lagers or American adjunct counterparts. I try to keep my ratings relative. Coors Light is awful, devoid of flavor and meriting no consideration. Coors proper isn't a must-try but you might be surprised by how drinkable it is in quantity, and no one wants to empty their beer fridge of superior craft offerings during a binge episode.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 06, 2013"

While I have little doubt that the usual BA set will pooh-pooh this brew as a matter of habit, the fact remains that it is still a highly quaffable, moderately tasty pale lager that I would never turn down (as opposed to Coors Light, which you would need to pay me to consume). I'd take this over most of the comparable lagers available in this province - certainly long before I'd consider picking up a Budweiser, Labatt Blue, or most other 'premium' (snort) brands.","thehyperduck","Sep 20, 2013"

3.43,34,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5," The flavor is decent with some gentle corn pop flavor but in general it is clean and refreshing the only real gripe is the minimal amount of malt flavor but it is not that offensive and is pretty crisp flavor-wise. Overall I don't find this to that bad of an example of the style, not my favorite type of beer, but perhaps if you are having a bowl of spicy chili or some extremely hot wings it would not be a bad choice since it is pretty mild and refreshes the palate with moderate but not overdone effervescent quality.","Slatetank","Aug 05, 2013"

This beer has been enjoyed a many night in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado. I've toured the famed Coors Brewery in Golden, witnessed the river flowing into their operation, indeed flowing out of the mountains. Driven by many of cold mornings, seeing the brewery in full swing with mass production. My point is, this beer is the flagship of Adolf Coors and his legacy. I'm sure it's been watered down and modified for mass production and distribution since its original inception years ago. So we have the modern day Banquet beer, as it were. It is what it is, Coors present tense. Still my favorite sessionable adjunct American Lager. Pound them down cold. Not for everyone.","Lagerquestrian","Mar 30, 2013"

No hops presences, almost a syrupy flavor, but one thats actually pleasing. Whether or not you like it, you have to agree that it tastes like SOMETHING, which is sadly more than you can say about its competition. One of those classic cookout beers, you can drink a ton without feeling sick. Coors has tried to step up their game as of late with Third Shift and Batch 19, and in hindsight, Coors banquet ain't so bad. Just don't expect a new "usual"","bullwinkle88","Mar 27, 2013"

The color is golden typical of an AAL, the smell is sweet, kind of grainy but not overly sweet, it has a crispness to the smell, clean. The taste is smooth and has a clean carbonated mouthfeel. This is not thing really surprising to the style, but as this is one of the first good mass produced beers I have ever had, it has a special place in my memories. Although I like to try a variety of beers nowadays, this one is one I will go back to on a hot summer night, you know during the beer drinking weather!

For that reason, it's fairly tricky to score, because I probably like it slightly better than my score presents. I also love water.

Smell is of malt, grain, and a distinct popcorn aroma. Taste is much the same with a sweet finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that is only drinkable when it’s super cold.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 29, 2012"

The appearance is golden colored with soapy, fizzy head--after the initial pour the head disappears but find it much less carbonated than other macros. Smell is slight lemon/banana and sweet grains, taste is sweet grains and very mild hops. To me the adjunct taste is rice, not corn dominant.

On the smell I pretty much get the same thing I do with the Coors light, adjuncts, small amounts of malt, no real hops to speak of. It smells sour as well, just like the Coors light did, the smell is pretty bad. One thing I do notice is that the flavor is a tiny bit bigger and the mouthfeel is also a tiny bit bigger than the Coors light, but for the most part it's the same exact taste and feel. Not comparing it to the Coors light - the mouthfeel is actually probably the most surprising part, it's not that bad, and the taste is bad, but like I said not bad as I thought. The mouthfeel though, is actually acceptable. Drinkability is a little better too, but it's not that great either, the mouthfeel makes it a little more bearable.

I guess it doesn't matter with appearance of this beer since most people would just drink this out of the can or bottle anyways. I can smell some fruitiness which what smells like to me Belgian yeast strain with some very light wheat malt. The taste is crisp right up front with the wheat malt and belgian yeast combining together with a quick flash of hop which is so subtle its barely noticeable until it warms then it becomes slightly more noticeable. I can tell Coors makes Blue moon and uses the same yeast in that beer as it does this one same malt too. It's so drinkable its ridiculous though you could finish this beer so quickly. I almost think they dial back the flavor just so that you keep drinking it more and faster so you can let the flavor build up on your tongue more... which is the only way you can tell what flavors it has. You also get your typical corn smell and taste in this as well but not as much as other adjunct beers. I actually like this better than Budweiser regular and Miller because of that slight Belgian yeast fruitiness that it gives off combining with that pretty okay subtle wheat malt. I don't know why you'd drink Coors light when this is light and extremely drinkable enough. Definitely not horrible by any means.

This beer will be a nice choice though kind of watery on taste it is not filling at all in my opinion.

In the years since I've had so many different beers from all over the world. We were really into import way back before all the micro thing got off the ground...so I've had a great variety.

And at one point my local beer distributer was selling Coors for a brief time in New York at 3 times the price of Bud. When I visited my sister in law in CA, I guzzled cans of Coors and when my buddy went to visit his parents in Colorado, I always had him bring back a case of Coors. I remember Adolf Coors saying they wouldn't sell their beer unless the retailer kept it refridgerated. I seem to remember Coors to be an exceptional American beer at the time.

Not to deny the outspoken desires of the fresh rocky mountain water, I obliged and tapped in to it. Taste of refreshing tin canned sweet corn. Fantastic. My taste buds were high fiving eachother, and chest bumping my uvula. They realized they were being rewarded today. Reminds me of the creamed corn gatorade flavor that was short lived in the mid 90's. The body on this exceptionally well canned beer was thin, just like I'd expect.

Another reason I respect this brew is the fact Coors has not watered down the recipe for Coors original over the years. Honestly, especially on a hot day, this is a good brew to drink.

I noticed hints of sweet malt, corn and some slight floral hops, and well carbonated. These flavors tasted different then the craft/micro beers that I am used to. You could tell that it was a macro-beverage. I would drink this again if the choices did not include anything micro.","Jarod","Jan 08, 2003"

2.6,1.6,2,2,2.5,2,4,"Overall, this is a decent, non-offensive beer. I don't know if I could classify it as an American Pilsener as I would expect more hop presence from that style.  If this were labeled a light beer, it would be a decent light, but we have to take it for what it is, and in my opinion its an average American standard lager.","Beastdog75","Nov 07, 2002"
1.58,-38.3,2,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,"Pours an ultra-clear pale golden color with a white soap-bubble-like head (even sounds soapy with the fizz of popping bubbles).  The strong smell of a twangy corn are present with nothing else, although I searched and sniffed and searched again.  Tastes of a weird twang with semi-sweet corn are present   I can barely stomach this stuff, but I'll take one for the team here ;-).  Those commercials with all those "original" sports stars made me do it.  The mouthfeel is very light bodied and finishes with a crisp clean carb bite, although lightly.  Better than the light version, but not much else good to say.  Cheers anways!","BeerAngel","Nov 02, 2002"

2.33,-9,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Light yellow in color with the taste of a hint of banana's. There is just nothing to be excited about!

3.48,35.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Crystal clear and straw gold in color with a 1/2" dense creamy head that holds OK but soon drops to a thin surface covering. It leaves some minor lace about the glass. The aroma is mainly of a mild grainy malt with some minimal hops mixed in, and a bit of sulphur. It's also slightly fruity. The body is light/medium with a very fine and moderate carbonation that leaves it crisp but smooth in the mouth. The flavor is reflective of the aroma: a semi-dry maltiness with minimal hop flavors that are so buried in the malt that they appear just slightly grassy like fresh straw, some light fruitiness (gentle strawberry?), and a slightly crisp sulphur that actually helps give the beer some character. It finishes crisp with a gently lingering maltiness. Refreshing and enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Oct 12, 2002"
3.22,25.8,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Light yellow, in comes out the way it went in. This is the one mass produced pilsner beer that I will drink on occasion. It can be refreshing on a hot day. Must be drank cold, at least for me, to kill any sense that it might be beer.","bewareOFpenguin","Oct 01, 2002"
2.19,-14.5,2,3,2,1.5,2,"Absolutely clear, straw-colored brew with no real head. Doesn't smell too bad for a macro, a little malt and a little hops. Despite the smell, there is almost no malt flavor, and zero hops. Instead, there is corn sweetness and a bit of grain on the finish. Any taste is completely overpowered by the carbonation; there is way too much. The carbonation actually imparts flavor to this beer, that carbonic acid taste that you find in seltzer! I actually used to prefer this over the other macros, but now that I've actually taken a close look at this, I'm not so sure.","yen157","Sep 22, 2002"
1.7,-33.6,2,2,2,1,1,"Not that different from Budweiser. Makes a very large head initially, but that is because of over carbonation. Head recedes to a flat rim that is almost infinitesimal. A very low quality fragrance no real hop or, otherwise, pronouncing aromas.  Bland taste a very watery mix. Soda pop like burn on the tongue and gaseous trails all the way down.","Mick","Sep 13, 2002"
2.2,-14.1,2,2,2.5,2,2,"Clear pale golden color with lots of carbonation, pours a thick white head that lasts a minute or so, modest lace, heavily carbonated.  Rather sweet aroma with some faint floral notes. Taste begins with sweet malts, which the aggressive carbonation quickly overwhelms, followed by washed out hops.  Finish is clean and crisp.  There is not a lot here, I'm afraid.  This is a beer I really liked in college, but with the passage of time, if all goes well, our tastes do improve.","Pegasus","Aug 17, 2002"
2.17,-15.2,2,2.5,2,1.5,2.5,"Now here's some straw color, clear with a head that's down to a fine layer of small bubbles quickly. A slightly grassy aroma, a little hops, not very interesting. The malt flavors have little chance to establish themselves, the brew diminishes extremely early in flavor. Tight in profile, I can see how people get used to it, but very limited in anything that represents a memorable taste, other than a vague stale aftertaste. Sweeter than a Bud, less cooked carrot than a Miller. Hops are on the light side for a macro, but somewhat less soapy than some.","ADR","Aug 12, 2002"

The only thing going for it really is the head, which quickly dissipates anyway.  A beginner beer at best as it brings little to the party in the way of flavor or aroma.","goindownsouth","Jul 01, 2002"
3.32,29.7,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Crystal clear yellow color....thin rocky white head. Laced down the glass nicely. Grainy sweet smell, not overly offensive. Very beerlike, like the stuff you would sneek out of your dad fridge back in '90. Taste is somewhat grainy, very sweet, and crisp. Crisp, bubbly refreshing pilsener finish...A pleasant surprise....Highly charged carbonation (Not Hops) burps that only Venom could appreciate. Paired with a cheese topped chunky chicken noodle soup it was very refreshing. Not a beer to savor on it's own, but pairs well with meals. I don't know if it's the high country barley or the Rocky Mountain water, but I stand before my ba brothers and proudly proclaim, I enjoy an Original Coors now and then.......","StevieW","Jun 07, 2002"
1.9,-25.8,2,2,1.5,2,2.5,"This is just bad beer.  The only thing going for it is that it's not Coors Light.  It looks like every other macro but tastes worse than Miller and Bud--or really tastes less than Miller and Bud.  Despite being watery, it's not even a good thirst-quencher because it has an unpleasant sweet aftertaste.  I grew up in the west where Coors was always available, so the mystique associated with its unavailability is lost on me.","mickeymac","Jun 05, 2002"
2.3,-10.2,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Light yellow in color with medium head. Lasts for a decent time. Thin lace tries to cling to side of glass.  Smells slighty metallic and grainy. Very clean tasting and smooth drinking.  Slightly bitter with very light malt.  Corn adjunct taste is noticible.  Finishes slightly dry and smooth with a trace of bitterness.  I have new respect for this beer.","psugrad98","Jun 05, 2002"

I can at least give it points for the good memories that I have of driving from Austin to Dripping Springs, Texas, in 1974, when Dripping Springs was as far south as they sold the stuff.  And of smuggling a case of the stuff back from Dallas on a high school trip in 1973 (when 18-year-olds could drink!).  Original Coors still beats Budweiser, if you ask me.  The original cult beer.","BKotch","Jan 06, 2002"

Bland?  Perhaps.  Couple of raw barely notes here.  A barleyish smell, but something isn't right, corn?  Not a big fan of the yellow urine color.

Front is slightly fruity/apple with a bland, sort-of-there hops finish.  The label proclaims "the original banquet beer."  What the heck is a banquet beer?  And to think that people used to drive across the country for it before it was nationally distributed.","Brent","Aug 17, 2001"
