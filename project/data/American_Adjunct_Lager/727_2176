Still have to deal with the malty, cereal, cheap flavor, but this one goes a bit above with a smooth mouth feel and drinkability that I did not expect.

Classic adjunct aroma of light sweet malt, hints of apple and grassy hops. Flavor follows, light sweet malt with mild biscuit, light apple, a hint of butter; finishes with light biscuit and grassy hops. Light to medium bodied. One nice thing about adjunct lagers is that they are designed not to offend and this is a bland, but pleasant light lager with perhaps a bit more biscuit and light apple than is typical, to its benefit. Not sure why this rates at poor here, it seems to be right on the spot for style, perhaps a bit more character. If I was stuck in Singapore (not a hot bed of craft beer, I suspect), I would have no problem ordering this.","LiquidAmber","Oct 16, 2014"

3,11.5,3,3,3,3,3,"I found this Singaporean Beer at Binny's Beverage Depot in Chicago and at Feldman's Market in McAllen, Texas. I must say this is a good beer from Asia, it has a simple but complex taste, goes down great, and does not leave you to bloated. It pours clear, with a light golden color, with white laces running up to the average head, which dissapates quicky. The body is solid, with decent carbonation, and has decent malt aroma. There is a slight metalic edge, but is overshadowed by a malty aftertaste.","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","Apr 10, 2014"

Easy to drink, not forgettable, probably would be good with Asian food. Decent mid-day drink, but not something to order at a place with better choices.","morebeergood","Mar 21, 2009"

It's pretty creamy and leaves a bit of lacing as the beer recedes down the glass. The aroma is, what I consider, mildly generically sweet. There really isn't that canned corn aroma that comes with most macro lagers. The flavor reminds me of a mix between Heineken and Bud Select. It has a bit of a sulfuric funk and bland canned corn sweetness. Also there is an odd aspartame chemically-ness to it also. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and just a touch of dryness. As with all macro lagers, I think its pretty drinkable, especially on a hot day.","hwwty4","Mar 10, 2009"

The taste is a bit sweeter, and there is a slight graininess that comes through as well. Some very slight hops on the finish that are mostly overwhelmed by the adjunct sweetness. Not terrible, but a bit too sweet and uninspired. The carbonation is right, but it would be crisper without the adjuncts. Just okay.

It was sort of heavy though, so not the best choice for a long session beer. It had a very non obtrusive aroma... almost nothing there. I think that contributes to the overall appeal to me.

Very mild bitterness, sweet with some grain and faint hop character. It also seemed to be a bit sour with some acidity that seemed to come from the carbonation. Light bodied and dry, CO2 was crisp.

The best things about it were the label and the bottle cap.","genaro","Jan 03, 2004"
2.5,-7.1,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Nothing remarkable happening here. If I were blindfolded I would be hard pressed to differentiate Singapore's Tiger beer from Japanese and Korean beers.","mwrseeley","Dec 27, 2003"
3.48,29.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall, this rates as probably my favorite Asian beer, easily beating out others like Singha and San Miguel. This brew has a fuller, more rounded and balanced profile than most Asian lagers. It also brings back some pretty fine memories of good times in Singapore.","Boilermaker88","Nov 13, 2003"
3.51,30.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"slighty malty aroma with maybe a hint of corn or some other adjunct(not exactly sure though). somewhat thin watery mouthfeel followed by a little hoppy bitterness and some co2 to balance off the malt make this a very refreshing lager.","shippos","Oct 30, 2003"
2.28,-15.2,3,2.5,2,3,2,"As an import it costs a lot more than the average local stuff. Pass!","koolk","Oct 30, 2003"
2.01,-25.3,2.5,1.5,2,2,2.5,"Drinkability: Ranks right up there with most domestic macro lagers. Bland, pretty boring and straightforward. Thank goodness this was a gift.","winomark","Oct 12, 2003"

2.38,-11.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,2,"Light gold color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and swet. A light bodied lager style beer. Light and crisp taste, malty and fairly hoppy. Mild flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Fairly standard lager","beerguy101","Sep 28, 2003"
2.88,7.1,3,2.5,3,3,3,"My advice (for what its worth): keep a few in the beer frig for your friends who are still exploring the world of beer and for yourself for a good breakfast beer.","PiratePete","Sep 27, 2003"
2.77,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,"Flavor is light, yet fairly rich and mildly hoppy. A little plain and bland. The hops are actually very nice, providing a spicy finish. The malting isn't perfect, kind of muddy, with a light corny taste. Not super crisp, but the finish is very good. Reminds me of Heineken or Becks. Well carbonated, light body. A decent pilsener or american style lager, but plain. It beats Bud, but nothing to write home about.","UnionMade","Aug 20, 2003"
3.73,38.7,3.5,3,4,4,4,"The flavor is crisp and malty. There's a dry aftertaste that leaves a clean feeling in the mouth.","freed","Jul 03, 2003"
3.6,33.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a clear golden straw color with a fluffy white head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is sweet malt and bitter grain husks. Light to medium in body and quite crisp. Taste is sweet malt with some grassy notes followed by some spicy alcohol. This is a good quencher and would make a great lawn mowing beer. One of the best Asian brews Ive tried. Thanks to Loki for the sample!","Morris729","Jun 27, 2003"
3.46,28.6,4,3,3.5,3,4,"sparkling gold body no head. Light malt aroma. Light pleasant hops (light, light, light). Ingredients malts, hops, grains, abv 5. I can taste no adjuncts, so i imagine the malt content to be high. Marvelous extra-light beer (if that is not a contradiction in terms). This was a great beer for the tpo.","Naerhu","Jun 13, 2003"
3.35,24.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"My favorite beer from Asia, it's lost its charm over the years, but I still come back to it from time to time, especially when eating out Thai or Vietnamese food. This one came in a big 640ml brown bottle with gold foil around the neck and cap. A clear golden colour, it pours out with a sizable white head, which sinks to about a dime's width after a short while. Can't pick up any discernable nose at all, but the taste is sweet and light, and not as dry as one would initially expect. It goes down easy, and is great partnered up with spicy Asian food, or just really hot weather.","IronDjinn","May 27, 2003"
4.37,62.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"The taste was excellent, full bodied with a hint of spice. Tiger has a nice malt sweet nice that balances the spice and a very smooth even finish. I would rank this by far the best Pacific-Rim beer and put it against any lager around the world.","Loki","Apr 16, 2003"
2.9,7.8,3,3,2.5,3,3.5,"I think it would go well with the right dish, maybe a pasta or a salad.","Anonmatel","Feb 16, 2003"
3.64,35.3,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Compared to say Heineken this is better..It's not a spectaculr beer but for its style it is very good and worth trying if you see it..","ZAP","Jan 15, 2003"
2,-25.7,2,2,2,2,2,"The beer pours a translucent gold color with a head that barely there, the color white and the texture frothy with some scraps of lace. Nose is all malt, sweet as is the start, the malt profile sparing, and the top cadaverous in feel. Finish is spitefully acidic with the hops meek and mild to the palate, quite dry aftertaste, and it truly does live up to its name of Tiger Piss, but it was better than the American Macros we received in Viet Nam, laced with Formaldehyde!","Gusler","Dec 09, 2002"
3.07,14.1,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Had this at a Thai restaurant in my neighbourhood. Posters on the wall proclaiming it's gold medal at the Brewing Industry Awards or some such in London '99. I'm not really all that impressed. Virtually no head, undistinguished aroma and flavour. It's not bad, but it's barely better than a Labatt or Molson, if at all. Good thing I didn't go for the Thai beer though - Singha - turns out to be a malt liquor.","the42ndtourist","Nov 16, 2002"
2.79,3.7,2,3,3,2.5,2.5,"I found this Tiger lager a disappointment.....Very little head, and what there was quickly disapaited...there is no sparkle to this product and certainly no fizz....Nice colour, full bodied...but flat, as if it had been poured the night before..How sad!","Shiloh","Oct 24, 2002"
2.8,4.1,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"An average beer. Medium straw in color with slight head and no lace.  Slightly sweet cooked veggie taste with slight hop aftertaste.  Goes down smoothly but lacks more character.  A little too fizzy.","psugrad98","Jul 18, 2002"
2.43,-9.7,2.5,2,2.5,3,2.5,"Quite a light lager, but mananges to maintain an Ok rounded flavour. Good when the weathre shot, gos down smooth.","rastaman","Feb 21, 2002"
2,-25.7,2,2,2,2,2,"A super light pilsener beer. Bland and inocuous, yellow and fizzy. No real flavor to speak of other than some rice adjuncts. Popular in Asia as many similar beers are. This one is about the lightest one I've tried on this trip to China. Skip over this one and try something else.","John","Nov 25, 2001"
