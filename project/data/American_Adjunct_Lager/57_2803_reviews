"Not much going here. Weak on smell, taste and body."
""
"Taste is light grain and wheat with a touch of lemon.  I would never rush out and purchase this beer as it is slightly above its competitors in the adjunct lager style.  That said, I think this is infinitely more drinkable than Corona and several other Caribbean adjunct lagers. If I was not rating to style, this would come closer to a 2."
"Nothing special. Decent ""light"" beer though for those summer session drinking days."
""
"Prefer this beer over a corona any day"
""
""
""
""
"Beer Hunt said the ABV is 1.4%.  Anyway, very sour Cerveza."
""
""
"Plain taste, smell of corn. Better option than corona if your in Mexico."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL-  Maybe this might pair well with Mexican food but I probably won't try it again.  There are to many other Mexican beers that go well with food."
"Just another beer from the south, flavor like corona, pacifico, etc...."
"Very light beer with dominant skunky notes in the aroma. I hate it."

"I ordered Sol directly after the Modelo Especial.  So this lager tasted like a watered down Miller Lite (yes, you heard me correctly -- watered down-- and that's saying something, given how watered down Miller Lite is).  There was no body or carbonation to speak of and the taste was... well, there wasn't much taste.  I learned my lesson here.  I will not be revisiting this one."
"A very light tasting Mexican beer. I squeeze a wedge of lime in to it. My days of strong tasting beer are few and far between. Good alternative to Dos XXX."
""
"This beer is Downright enjoyable when it is ice cold and you are on the beach in Mexico.  Any other time I would take a pass"
"Regardless of the qualities of this brew, I'll never turn down a Sol!"
""
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is a lawnmower beer, nothing more, I would not willingly seek this out  again unless there were no other options available."
""
"Better tasting than I expected.  Nothing to look at, more like yellow water.  No smell, but for some reason that was not a bad thing.  Feel is watery.  But overall, I did not mind drinking it."
"Of the three beers we had at our resort, Dos Equis, Corona Light, and Sol - I definitely enjoyed Sol the most.  Excellent for pool/ocean side drinking, especially with a lime."
""
""
"This is not any different than Corona. Maybe even worse."
"So overall would I recommend it ? F*** No ! Even if a friend give it to u for your birthday, but that directly I'm the garbage"
"Dosen't even satisfy that rare urge for a cheap mexican beer. Just plain bad, no redeeming factors for me."
""
""
"Mexican Shit !!! ""South of the Border"" High Life !!!"
"Refreshing  on a hot summer day"
""
""
"It tastes better then corona"
""
"I once saw  this listed as the best mexican beer you can buy... wonder what they were smoking...  lol"
"I just sampled a great many beers in Mexico, most mediocre at best, although I will endeavor to provide a focus on any differences I was able to discern and will also attempt some degree of objectivity. This one is actually harder to find than Corona and Pacifico, at least in Cabo San Lucas and surrounding area. Finally snagged one at an American burger joint. A pale yellow, maybe just a hair darker than Corona, with obvious effervescent fizz but no true head of which to speak. Aroma is the expected meld of creamed corn, skunk, rank grass, and ever so subtle citrus fruit notes. Little in the way of aroma per se, though. Again, just a hair more flavor than Corona but a near clone thereof, less corn and perhaps more of a citrus and grape candy note. In other words, slightly more mainstream lager ""character"". Does not improve as it warms, needless to say. Nil hop aroma or flavor but plenty of skunk in this here example. Far too fizzy, which serves to mask the few flavor elements present. Not great. Not worth a serious tasting session."
"Not the worst Mexican AAL I've tasted, but pretty bad even with a lime in it."
"Yea not the worst I've had"
"Requires a lime to enjoy :)"

"This Mexican beer poured nicely with a clear yellow color, 1 finger head and decent lacing. Looked pretty good! The aroma reminded me of a back road along a farm that had recently been fertilized. Add to that a dead skunk and it sums it up nicely. The taste? This is just one nasty beer! Let’s put it this way. An ice cold Rolling Rock is a glorious thing on a hot summer day. A piss warm Rolling Rock is well like… piss. This beer, even served ice cold makes me prefer a warm Rolling Rock! It was actually difficult to finish! A drain pourer for sure and not worthy of even beer batter for frying.  4.5%ABV"

"Edit : upon review of other write-ups from BA'ers, perhaps Sol changed their formula and its now great? My sample had a great head with rings of lacing, good crisp flavor and no skunk. Hm."

"Sol brewed by  Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, S.A. de C.V. with an ABV of 4.5%  This brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice white head. Smells rich grains and corn. There is some skunkiness to this brew. The skunkness is not to overpowering in this brew. The taste is sweet with some grains.  This brew has a light body to it. There is not a lot to this brew but it is good.  Sol  goes down smooth with no bad after taste. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. Overall I'm giving this brew 4 out 5. I would buy this brew again. I'm reviewing the bottle version of this brew but it is better in a can. If you are going to get this brew get in a can."

"Looks like a soda and corn barley slightly bitter... Fill your belly but does not cause anything... But taste is taste..."

"Surprisingly, the aftertaste is not an overwhelmingly bitter, or metallic/rocky taste. Overall, this is a decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes like a slightly improved Corona. It has very little merit, no character, little or no flavour, rather sweet. But there is nothing bad about it. I see no reason why I should buy it, but it's okay. I expected a lot worse."

"Great taste, attractive design. One of oldest Mexican beer full of history and tradition from German founders. Full of tsar and refreshing, most of people in USA like to introduce a lime in the bottle, not necessary at all. perfect companion for beef, strongly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 2.76, a C. Sol is one of the better imported cervezas I have tried, but believe me when I say that this is far from a ringing endorsement. It is fairly bland and corn soda-like, with no especially offensive attributes. This one's main attraction is the relatively low price, but there are domestic Corona knock-offs that manage to beat it in that department. In hot weather this beer will refresh you, but I can think of plenty of other lagers I'd rather be drinking. To be fair, Corona is not one of them, so you could certainly do worse."

"Sol is a decent beer, I have had it a few times. I enjoyed it every time that I have had it. It has a Champaign look to it as well. The taste is not that bad. It goes down smooth and it does not make you feel full like some beers make you feel. If you have never tried this beer you should at least try it once."

"O: Decent thirst quencher, but lacking in flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Meh. Reminds me of beer I stole from grandpa's fridge as a kid that came in a plain white can with the word ""Beer"" written in black on the side. It's pretty close to drinking water."
""
""
""
""
"While I do tend to like the darker beers, I didn't think this one was too bad! Scent is not too great, taste is mildly bitter but not a whole lot going on in the background. Not too ""deep"" of a flavor. Reminds me of other Mexican beers.. not too serious, good cold after a dip in the pool, maybe with a lime. ;)"
""
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of corn, hint of sweet malt, hint of pale malt, hint of hops, and rice. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Tastes of strong adjunct, hint of pale malt, and a hint of hop. Overall, not much to report. Almost exactly what I was expecting."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is more corn and adjuncts. Body is very light, even watery. ""Beer flavored water", this one. A little tinny and metallic near the finish, Sol is very light and lacking in flavor. Not one I'd care to revisit."

"Pale straw golden colored with a half inch of white head that faded quickly. Excellent clarity. Brussels lacing. Aroma is of corn and a faint trace of bittering hops. The body is very light and highly quaffable. I get a blend of corn,light malt and a bit of hops in the front of the palate. The taste rapidly disappears. There's no real aftertaste. This a hot weather brew."
""
""
""
"From Mexico"
""
""
""
""
""
"This would appear to be a Corona clone but it tends closer to Bud Light. It holds a very sour mash flavor with a rice/corn mix and a tinny aftertaste. Most aspects of this beer are weak and it begs for a lime. Once a lime is added it does give a crisp clean thirst quenching feel which ultimately may be the brewers intent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Sol isn't all that bad. I'm sure I will have it again in the future as I have in the past. It does what it's brewed for and makes sense in certain situations. I'd reach for this before Corona any day."

"It's a step down from the more familiar Corona, but similar. It doesn't taste like much of anything, sort of a corn-ey single note. It is far from being good by itself, but that would really be doing it wrong anyway. When it's 100 degrees out, a few of these chilled to almost freezing with salt, lime and some picante sauce (maybe a splash of tomato juice, too) are exactly what you need. If you like to cut frozen margaritas with beer, this is good for that too."
"Went on a little family vacation to mexico and the mini fridge was stocked with these. An american adjunct lager, but made in mexico...interesting. Poured into a glass. As expected transparent straw yellow (actually, kind of urine looking). Hard pour yeilded a big frithy head that was gone quick leaving some bubbles on the surface of the brew. Nose is grainy and reminds me of the beer i drank in high school. Little corn. Taste, if you can call it that is also very grainy. Not much of anything there. Mslightly less bold and flavorful than the american counterparts. Think i will stick to margharitas this trip instead. Not a drain pour but not something to drink if looking for a beer."

"Pours a pale yellow in color with a very thin white head. Some very spotty lacing was seen. The aroma is nothing special and is of just some grain. Above average carbonation as seen from the tiny bubbles streaming up from the bottom and sides of the glass. The taste is watered down and on the 'thin' side. Nothing special here."

"Well, it doesn't quite taste like water, but it would be difficult to really appreciate this as a quality beer. Nothing awful about things, just a near lack of aroma and flavor. Too bad most adjunct lagers can't follow-up a fair appearance with a decent tasting beer. Sol follows the pack with this one. Pretty much forgettable as a whole."
""
""
"I drank several of these ice cold from the cooler while wasting an afternoon in idle conversation. This was an okay to drink a lot of but don't write home about it (oops). This tastes better than American macrobrew that has a pale yellow beer much like this one. I could drink these with Corona and not really know the difference. I ate tacos and frijoles with this and worked out nicely. Not really good when warm, so crank em down."

"Overall - If you're looking for something cold and wet after a hard day's work this will do. However beyond that, definitely not a sipping beer and as expected was not a beer that improved as it warmed. Fortunately it was gone down the gullet rather quickly."

"In the bottle and out, the beer has a beautiful golden color. It pours a very nice white head, but it has not lacing or staying power. I smelled hints of honey and even sugar, which I have to admit I found appealing. The beer unfortunately felt way too watery for my taste - it was as though I could have drank an entire six pack without thinking I was really having any beer. The watery-ness lent itself to the blandness of the beer, and although it wasn't the worst I ever had, it left me wanting for more."
""
""
"Overall: Lawnmower beet. Nothing more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Why bother?"
""
""
"In the realm of American adjunct lagers, Sol falls near the bottom of the pack. Though not quite as offensive as its Mexican brethren Pacifico, this beer had an odd, astringent, bitter quality on the finish that was likely the result of a poor quality hop extract. If you must drink this, definitely mask the flavor profile with a lime or two."

"It is drinkable...and is better than a lot of really cheap stuff...I just don't like the aftertaste and the fact that it is 6.99 a six vs 3.99 for Natty Light...or Miller ...two cheap beers that I would rate higher on the overall scale..."

"This beer is moderately carbonated. An effort is almost made for crispness, but it dies off. It might be a little smooth...at least it's clean. It could be slick, after all."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Actually a really nice head, and some strong lacing. Nose is light and pale, not much to it. Completely shallow, and devoid of any flavor. Overall, this is a pretty poor quaff. Not really a horrible, repulsive experience; just... nothing."
""
""
""
""
"From a can into a pint glass, one finger of fizzy white foam quickly fades, leaving a tiny bit of lacing. Some carbonation precipiates from a clear golden yellow body. Nose is grainy with corns and malt. In the mouth, big flavors of adjunct and a bit of artificial sweetener, off flavors and a hint of metal. Fizzy and watery in the mouth. Overall: A very poor macro adjunct lager."
""
"My Crack and subsequent inverted Glug produced a sudsy finger of bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a gorgeous sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of sol-heated and fermented silage. Now, before you take exception to that, please understand that AALs are the backbone of The CANQuest (TM) and as such, I CAN recognize the scent quickly. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and it had a slightly vinous flavor in addition to the usual melange of adjuncts, especially corn. Finish was semi-dry, slightly refreshing, but nothing terribly different from any of its brethren."

"grain aroma."
"This one was a stinker, there are better beers to drink with Mexican food for sure."
""
""
"Poured this American Adjunct Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a pale yellow color, produced a decent white head, average retention and does leave a little lacing on the glass. The aroma consists of mostly corn- not very appealing. Light in body, the foundation is derived from corn and some husky grain. There is a slight bit of hop bitterness but overall, not very complex, not very flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"bad, but not that that bad. its better than a corona, not better than a pacifico, in my humble opinion. the color is straight piss, it really looks pee from someone that's rather dehydrated. there is a decent head on it though, and with a lime wedge it can look appealing after a hot day of work. the flavor is obviously adjuncty, corn heavy, syrupy, metallic, and a little bit decomposing, but taken in a big gulp from the bottle, its passable in some ways. the aftertaste is long and rotten though, yikes. fine carbonation but a little thick for a beer that's supposed to be a summer slammer like this one is. I usually hold the fruit in all beers I drink, but this beer is really only tolerable in quantity with a lime wedge, otherwise its pretty foul. time and a place though, time and a place..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The bottom line is that this lager is better than Corona Extra, better than Dos Equis Special, and better than Tecate. It's an awesome summer beer when you are from the upper Midwest."

"Sol has a a strong foamy presence. The irony is that Sol has medium carbonation. Sol has the grain and hop presence that can be recognizable. There are not any real strong flavours within Sol. There is no bitterness at all within Sol. I enjoy drinking Sol. I enjoy Sol because the price is right and the beer is easy to drink."

"O: Low drinkability. One of the worst ""beers"" that I've ever had"
"O: Very easy to drink and sessionable, would be a good beer for a cook out on a hot summer day or at the beach. Pairs well with just about any food style as it does not have competing flavors."

"glassware: Warsteiner pokal...occasion: uncertain at this point...appearance: frothy foam that leavees a trace but thinly so; another clear body, with sparce effervescence.... aroma: thin, pingy scent--as expected...palate: effervescent, thin body that skips the teeth and heads straight for the throat...taste: empty pilsner that doesn't have Tecate's strength or Corona's charm--and that's not saying much...overall: fulfills its duty of quenching and complimenting Mexican food--little other reason to soak up this sun!"

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the brew pours a clear straw gold color with about a half inch white head that doesn't stay around for too long. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet and bready malt, and some corn. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's mostly sweet and grainy/bready malt along with some corn/adjuncts. Surprisingly with the clear bottle it's not skunky at all, so I assume this bottle hasn't been sitting around for too long. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's easy to drink and is well carbonated. Picked this up as a single at Andersons, might as well tick it. And this really wasn't too bad at all, worth a try at least once!"
"O: too drinkable for me, however, it is an AAL, so, whaddaya say - something I probably won't seek out again, but if I wanted to get wasted quickly after mowing the lawn, gimme some sol."
""
""
""
""
"O: It is not too bad, compared to beers in the same style like Corona or Bud, but the only reason to buy this is if you want to look different from the person drinking the Corona or Bud. Much better beers in this style and price range."
""
""
"12 floz. bottle. Lager glass. (From my notes: Bought at “Mexican Week” in a mall. Enjoyed at home). Pale yellow color. Crystal clear bottle & appearance. White froth. Brief & little head. Light maltiness, hints of corn & grain to the nose. Crisp & fizzy upfront. Some hoppiness lingers into a dry bitter, slightly husky, finish. Light body. Moderate to high carbonation. Smooth adjunct palate. Watery texture. Refreshing but don´t forget a lemon wedge inside."
""
""
""
"This would make a good session beer but it's boring and forgetful."
""
""
"Poured out a nice medium pale yellow with two inches of white frothy head. Head dissipates into a foamy film with some mild lacing on the glass. Scent is citrusy grass, the taste is slightly soapy, but crisp; nice on a hot summer day.Better than I expected given the reputation of Mexican brews!"
"O: Not something to drink on its own just for the taste, but paired with spicy fish tacos on a hot day, it's a reasonable choice. The lime is a must, and since it's the accepted way of serving this beer, it's not really ""cheating"" in my book (any more than serving lambic at 50-degrees in a fluted glass is cheating -- that's just the way it's generally done)."
""
""
""
"Got this beer as a summer, hot weather quencher. Just drank it straight from the bottle, because I didn't expect much. Smells of adjunct corn lager with a watery tinge. Pale gold in color. It tastes like a sweeter corona for me, with a bit more carbonation. Hops are there to back up the lackluster taste to some degree. Leaves a coated mouthfeel after a few swigs. All in all a decent beer to cool off with and just enjoy. A change of pace."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes pretty much like a more carbonated Corona. Bought a few "" Beers if Mexico "" 12 packs for a party recently and this was one of the beers in that pack. Looks like Corona, Smells like Corona, Tastes like Corona, Except it is somewhat more drinkable I guess. Nobody at the party really preferred it over anything else"
""
""
""
"O: The best way to describe this beer is that it's a more carbonated version of Corona. If the price is right and you're looking for an alternate to Corona this will fit the bill."

"Pours a clear gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is pretty watery with aromas of grain and sugar. Taste is pretty much the same and like the smell is watery. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with no real aromas or flavors."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours straw color with a white head that dissipates very quickly. Smells of slight lime, but has a general adjunct beer smell. Tastes of adjunct beer with a slight fruity taste, but not really anything. Goes down really smooth, good carbonation, and could be very sessionable. Overall, a below average beer."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a pale, crystal clear, yellow-gold color with a thin, sparse, white filmy coating on the surface. Aromas of toasted grains, roast corn, and a slight char character. Flavors are watery and light, with a roasty backbone of corn and grains, leading to a slightly filmy, toasty aftertaste. The finish is light and smooth, albeit slightly limp and watered down once again. This brew is nothing if not consistent."

"O-fizzy, yellow and wet not that good if you are looking for flavor. Mexican version of BMC just another macro brew"

"O: Would have been much better with a lime, grab a few to drink on the beach, certainly not something unique or worth discussing further"

"Despite reminding me of the corn pops I used to eat as a kid, Sol is a notch better in nearly every respect than the big three macros. This is the first beer i've tried from the ""Beers of Summer"" variety pack I got on clearance at World Market for $7.50. I'm glad it only contained one Sol and hope the remaining beers have more soul."

"O - On a hot day down in the Yucatan where I travel on a regular basis this beer is refreshing if you slam a lime into it or make a Chelada of some sort. This said, I do prefer Sol over Corona but will seek out Bohemia over both."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I used to love Sol, before I got heavily into craft beer. It seems like it's become worse than Corona lately. In the tier of Mexican lagers, Sol is near the bottom 1/3."

"O: It is what it is. If your looking for a beer on a hot summer day or to just drink passively, this is it."

"Drinkability: A soda drink masqueraded as a beer but nothing purely offensive either… It's up to you. Not my preference by any measure."

"O: I don't see it being any worse than the average, middle of the road AAL. It's low alcohol and refreshing to drink so to me it fits any situation I'd have with Bud Light. Hell, I'd play beer bong with this beer."
"Picked up a 32 oz bottle of this stuff at a gas station in Tucumcari, NM. I had just got into a hotel after a long day of driving. No need to pour it, it's a clear bottle. It smells super sweet and the taste matches. Just what I'd expect from a Mexican beer. Light bodied and carbonated well. This is a ""just got doing something all day"" kinda beer. Not much taste. I will drink beers like this every once in a while. It serves a purpose, but it's usually because you want to throw your dollars somewhere else."
""

"12 oz bottle poured right into the mouth. What you would expect from a mexican lager. Thin and clear yellow with minimal aroma. Taste is simple and feel is quite watery. Thin with a touch of carbonation. Overall- Call it for what it is; a good session brew for hot summer days or chilling in the pool. Not complex or full flavored. Pretty simple and average. It serves a purpose, but too much like so many others."

"A typical Mexican lager; very watery, meant to be served ice-cold under a broiling sun or at a cookout or what-have-you. Not much aroma at all; what’s there is mildly sweet and citric. Little in the way of flavor besides corn adjuncts and faint bitterness. Again, think frigid here–what minimal taste exists isn’t particularly pleasant. Light-medium body with good carbonation make for a refreshing drink, which is about the best you can say about this. Often skunky, too, by the way. Pass."

"Overall: Not a very good quality beer, but it is a decent one for drinking several of them in a night."

"Beer is super thin, light, there is a mild aftertaste of grain astringency but overall the beer is unoffensive, mildly skunked but I won't bother having it again. I was bored so I drank this."
"O: One of the better mexican brews that are adjuncts. Not something I would normally buy, but good lawnmowing beer."
"Not a bad session beer if you're looking for something with very mellow flavor."
"O: Typical Mexican lager, OK on a hot summer day, but lacking in flavor, complexity and mouth texture."
"Overall - refreshing, nothing bad, easy, watery. Recommend instead of Corona."
"Sol as in most Mexican beers taste best in teh summer with a lime...however, judging Sol solo...its just another no frills cerveza! The beer poors golden clear with good carbonation that give a white foamy head for a brief time. The smell and taste are enhanced with grain. The hops help somewhat with teh taste so that it is not bread water. Mouthfeel is easy especially on hot days...enjoy!"
"O: The beer makes a great companion on the “how many beers can I drink in the night” game, but perhaps the beer should be put down those nights for something stronger."
"O- As an adjunct lager, this is average at best....not the worst, probably not the best. In comparison to the Mexican lager scene, this is the best one to have in my humble opinion. I disagree with others when it comes to needing a lime with this...I feel that this is one of very few Mexilagers that doesn't require it. Not nearly as good as Sol Brava (dark lager), it still hits the spot and doesn't demand much on the palate. I recommend giving this one a go and I will purchase this again!"
"Drink- Another free beer at a party. Eh."
"The interesting thing about this beer is the taste, while it is not offensive in any way, there just isn't much of it, slight corn-pop sweetness is about all I get the flavor is not bad slightly grainy, no real hop taste and the mild malt is slightly overtaken by the high carbonation. I don't get any diacetyl really so I am talking about what isn't there inasmuch as I am trying to describe flavor. The good thing about this beer is overall I can't really fault it for doing what it sets out to do -the kind of beer you don't think about it is refreshing crisp and light bodied with a easy to drink quality and went very well with my fajitas texanas."
"Light, fizzy, easy to drink: the terms are value neutral, or more precisely value situational. On a hot day when you want to suck down a few, this works just fine, but more in the manner of soft background music than a live band. I favor it over Corona and several other Mexicans, and I am surprised at that."
"O - One of the better Mexican brews. Cheers!"
"Overall...the weather needs to be hot and the beer needs to be cold."
"The mouthfeel is too watery. I know that watery bodies come with the style, but this is too weak even for accepted adjunct lager standards. Overall, this beer is a horrendous effort. Where is the beer flavor? Please avoid this beer at all costs. It ranks as one of the worst beers I've ever had."
"Pass."
"Overall - I could drink a few of these for hydration purposes only but I wont. Im one and done on this beer. Maybe good for a college kid who is trying to get buzzed at a bbq or float trip. Otherwise, stay away from this one."
"D-"
"Cheers!"
"This beer serves its purpose. It's a refreshing, summer brew. If you look at a bottle of Sol you know you're not going to get a beautiful, delicious beer. You're going to get a refreshing but adjunct Mexican lager. As long as you go in with that in mind you won't be too disappointed."
"It's Cinco de Mayo today, and I am drinking Sol this year. Flat yellow color, fizzy but not overly carbonated. Smell was mostly absent. Taste was just a lot of corn, and while its taste was fairly mild, it was not offensive. I put a quick shot of fresh lime juice in there, which seemed to liven things up a bit. Mouthfeel was watery and thin, but smooth and easy to drink. My impression is that it is a typical Mexican hot weather beer. Perhaps though, Sol might be a bit better than Corona due to the better color in the body and slightly improved mouthfeel. Still, this is a beach brew through and through."
"Pours a clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, with a fizzy white head, minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is kinda sweet, slight hop note, the usual grainy/ricy notes. The taste is slightly sweet, kinda malty, but with a slight hop note, mostly grainy/ricy. Light Body. Mostly a thrist quencher."
"Would be refreshing on the beach or out in the sun. But thats about it."
"Overall: Slightly above average. This is a brew to drink on a hot summer day at super cool temperatures while enjoying a burger off the grill...and that's about the only place you can truly enjoy it."
"I'll take this over Corona any day. This beer is much like any other pale lager, the color is yellow the head it white. The aroma is slightly skunked the taste is rather boring but with a lime added it's pretty good. The best part of this beer is the label design. I'm a stickler for good design and this beer has some really good eye catching design in my opinion. Worth looking at, at least."
"abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Overall, this is a very basic, but not flavourless adjunct lager. I'd say its defining characteristic is a very mild sour note that I wouldn't quite call citrus."
"O - I suppose there is some sort of up-side here; it's not flavorful but it would certainly go down well and quench a thirst in the hot Mexican heat. Utterly bland otherwise."
"Pours a light amber color with a rather foamy head that lasts an average length. Has a the typical American Adjunct Lager scent with a slight bit of citrus. The taste is very weak and rather basic. Has a mostly water type consistency that leaves your mouth empty much like the cotten candy does. Something for people that don't like strong beers so I don't see many BA's finding this worth their while to drink."
"O - It's drinkable, but not particularly pleasant. Pretty average."
"D- Meh. Better than expected from a clear bottle(but still meh). It keeps up with budget macros. Could serve a purpose on a hot summer day when looking to be refreshed. It was pretty cheap."
"Pour a very thin looking yellow straw color with a medium thick soapy white head and no lacing. Smells of wet hay and corn and some olive oil. Tastes of sweet corn and some malts and some very mild hops. Mouthfeel is medium with a huge amount of carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"Bottle/12oz - Pours a bright yellow/amber in color with a very small head and little carbonation. Aroma is pretty skunky (clear bottle) with just a hint of grainy malts and no hops to speak of. Flavor is pretty skunky too with some grains and a bit of an ""industrial"" taste at the end that made it less than pleasant. Needs lime or some tequila to go with it."
"D: Not something I'd really care to have again. Luckily it was free to me, so I can't really complain about the tick too much."
"An insubstantial lager. Bland - nothing to grab your attention. Most of the past occasions where I've consumed this beer have involved adding a lime to the bottle; this improves it greatly but a requirement for fruit is hardly an endorsement. Probably quite refreshing in a hot climate, but there are plenty of other beers out there. Avoid."
"About one finger of head, dark gold body with rosy hues. Smells sweet but has some metalic qualitites. Taste has a little of that same metalic. Both smell and taste have noticeable ethanol. A little toasty banana bread in the taste. Mouthfeel is smooth with nice carbonation. A little sweet but still strong on the butter. Very drinkabout. Thin bodied. Not too much hops taste. Leaves a clean palate. This beer would be so much better without that metalic taste and if it wasn't so watery. It has potential but those bring it down alot."
"Cheers..."
"Rough texture to the beer, gritty, corn husky, alcohol too evident for such a weak beer all around. Vegetables cookin' on the grill. Why is this stuff $7 a 6er? Garbage dude."
"As far as this particular soulless corner of beerdom is concerned, Sol is a passable enough member - nothing all that skunky, once past the nose, which is surprising, given the serving vessel. A plain and innocuous adjunct lager, and, relatively speaking, drinkable enough in certain common situations, where the weather and/or beer selection conspire against you, and perhaps the food is spicy enough for one not to care."
"I guess in order to be offended a beer would have to have something to it. Therefore, due to the lack of strong characteristics this beer falls short of offensive. It's barely on the radar - basically it's an unobtrusive little amigo. I feel kinda sorry for it."
"Poured into a pint glass. The pour brings a yellow colored body with a very thin white head of large bubbles that disappears nearly as quickly as it forms, kind of like a soda. Nose is light grain and some adjuncts. The taste is just gross. It's kind of like Corona, but perhaps worse. Light grain with some bitter husks. Very light body. Lots and lots of carbonation. Again, not good. If that's all some place has, I'll have a water. Same taste, less filling, to paraphrase what some might say."
"Drinkability - Can't say it's a bad brew because I can't really taste anything. But that being said it's kind of boring. Otherwise alright."
"Pours an extremely pale straw color with active carbonation, no head. Scent is pale cooked corn and light malt. Taste brings the same qualities as scent. Body is light and watery. Similar to Corona with slightly more adjunct flavors and even more watery."
"M/D: Light and very thin, sort of refreshing I guess. It is a less commercialized version of Corona, but a little better. Always served with a lime, which speaks to how great it is. Could do worse, but not hard to do better."
"Goes from boring to crappy. This is one to end the night with, after you've drank the good stuff and there's not much taste left in your mouth. If you go back for more, I'm going to assume you're already hammered."
"But I will not do that mistake again! Ever!"
"RJT"
"Overall another macro lager that just is what it is. It has a place for everyone, just not in my fridge, not again."
"Could easily drink a lot of this beer, but why would you want too?"
"D- Not that great of a beer. Very average mexican lager."
"D: A warm summer day on the beach - this beer will do the trick. But any other time or place - avoid!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"As with a lot of Mexican beers, they tend to taste better closer to the source, so I will have to try it again sometime and compare."
"Nope, no skunk in the aroma, no other scents either. A very slight grain taste was the only clue that I was drinking beer and not water. The body was typical for the style. Drinkability was good, but, unless you're sitting on a warm sandy beach somewhere, would you? Drink this just to check it off your list."
"Would not purchase ever. Free maybe, only on a bus from the Cancun airport to the hotel."
"From a bottle served with lunch at a La Caretta Mexican restaurant. Sampled on April 29, 2010. It poured straw yellow with a quick burst of fizzy white head and thin lacing. The aroma is fairly bland with a note of malts in the mix. The taste is about the same with a vaguely malted element and a watery mouthfeel. Typical for thie kind of Mexican adjucnt beer."
"Taste was thin for me. Definitely an adjunct beer. More notes on the hops side than the malt side."
"I first had this beer years ago at a Mexican restaurant, in Southampton, England and has not improved with age."
"Drinkability: It's cold and wet."
"D- Very poor. Just a hair above the competition in everything but smell. God, that is a rank smelling beer."
"Taste is skunky and corney. Not good."
"D: Another excellent hot weather beer. One of the better adjunct lagers that I've had during vacation."
"Mouthfeel is super light and not drinkable."
"D-Very drinkable. This was my go-to for the beachside during this trip. It's very tasty, relative to other Mexican lagers."
"D - For Mexico, it is fine. Drink with shots and fish tacos."
"Taste: More corn/grain/sugar. That's all this beer has to offer. I was expecting this to be rather gross, but I find this better than most adjunct lagers."
"Slightly better than Corona...slightly."
"for a mexican beer this is about as good as they come. they've got very little flavor other than riced up water with a little little little hint of malt. they smell like that very ""beery"" almost skunky type bud-esque brew. although, if it's hot and you're in mexico, you're not going to be complaining when you're drinking one. plus, it's sort of mandatory that you drink beer in mexico, regardless of if you're actually enjoying yourself or not."
"Poured from a clear 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of corn, some malt. Taste is crisp and refreshing, hints of corn and malt. Feels light in the mouth and goes down very smooth. Overall a decent brew on a hot day."
"D: ok when very cold! and only when cold."
"Its well, a close cousin of Corona, couldn't help but compare. Very similar in appearance and smell, but taste and MF is more defined - means definitely has more body than Corona. Very refreshing and light, though I prefer Corona, even though Sol is less ""corny""."
"Drinkability is weak. Honestly not horrible, and I'd drink this over Corona any day, but this isn't a beer I'd seek out again."
"if you are served this at an all inclusive ask for something else a pina colada instead"
"This beer comes in a clear bottle which would not block out any light. Grainy, corn taste. With very watery mouth feel and smooth drinkable nature. Not overly carbonated which make this very average. Served with a slice of lime to add some flavor. Not to much different than other Mexican brews."
"It must be called SOL, because you'd be Shit Outta Luck drinking only this."
"Finish: Dry and with a little bitter aftertaste. Good for hot summer refreshment."
"Flavor follows the smell. Standard mass-market Mexican, closest cousin is Corona. Sol is slightly maltier. Surprisingly little carbonation, and a thinner mouthfeel than I'd like. Drinkability is, unsurprisingly, its strongest point - you could make a nice afternoon on the beach out of these. When put into the right bracket of comparison, Sol is pretty decent. If you're looking for strong, complex flavor though, you're not going to find it here."
"What a bad beer. This deserves a good spanking."
"Try it again guys in the summer, that's how i fell in love!"
"Drinkability: Maybe it'd go okay with a palomilla or bistek, but otherwise I'd skip it."
"D: This is definitely a shitty beer, but they go down like water. On a hot day, they are light and refreshing. Pop a lime in the bottle and you're good to go. Maybe I'm biased because I think back to pounding down buckets of Sols on the beach in Cancun."
"D - Give me a hot day and something to do and I could easily kill a bunch."
"Poured a light yellow color with a thin head of white foam. Aroma of corn/grain and grass. Typical macro taste with a slightly sour finish. Pretty much what you would expect. Drink it extremely cold on a hot day or don't drink it."
"Thin and watery, just like I expected."
"Drinkability - I first had this in quantity on a boat cruise a few years ago as one of only a few choices. It's not that it's not drinkable but it's pointless to choose this intentionally since there are so many better options."
"Drinkability: I expected this, and won't even bother pouring the other five in a glass. Maybe Sol could spend a little less money plastering soccer stadiums with their logo to give their beer more bite. Even that ""triple hops"" brewing process may be worth checking out."
"Final Thoughts: No lime? Then you are S.O.L. my friend."
"One can really taste the corn in this beer, has a corn flakey, mealy feel to it. Tastes fresh and clean, but there is just not that much to it. The carbonation when it is drank straight from the bottle helps add a bit of sustenance to it. I also like this one better without the lime."
"Overall, I drank the whole bottle but that will be my last."
"Pale yellow beer with a head that is gone in seconds.Aroma and taste are your basic macros from Mexico.This beer is smooth refreshing and pretty decent.A great summer outing beer.I would recommend and enjoyed it enough to want to purchase agsin shortly."
"D- Ya I could drink this all night, but I won't if any other style of beer is available."
"Good for knocking back when you can no longer taste what you're drinking (if you're into that kind of thing). Mind you, there's cheaper beers that are better for that anyway."
"So, even if you're in a tropical beach tanning yourself with the sun and begging for something to refresh you, I still don't recommend it."
"Drinkability?! Almost excellent because of its price and freshness. Love it!"
"Your average Corona wanna-be. The exception is that I can actually keep this down while I'd be spitting out Corona. Average at best."
"Look: Maybe it's a redundancy but the color is golden like the sun (sol in spanish), bare head of foam with acceptable lacing; Smell: Corn syrup and sweet malt, smells strange but not bad; Taste: Corn syrup, pineapple concentrate and lot of carbonation; Mouthfeel: Like sweet medicine, medium carbonation and light body; Drinkability: Very sweet, seems serum of beer, too sickly to drink several."
"Drinkability: Dreadful and quite sol-crushing. Some of these mass-produced lagers can be quite serviceable, some just bland and forgettable, and some are downright awful. Sadly, Sol is one of those awful, awful lagers."
"Either way, it is highly drinkable for what it is."
"This beer seems to have one purpose - it will get you drunk. I made the comparison to college beers earlier in my review, and this is probably the most simplistic way to describe it. I've had several Mexican beers that are better than this, but it does have a purpose. If you're looking for something to slam while you're either grilling or throwing a fiesta, then this is the beer to get, but if you're trying to pick up something nice then I suggest you choose something else."
"Drinkability: This beer is awful, Im pretty fair in my reviews but this beer misses the mark entierly. Taste like a mixture of corn, water and metal. If your going for this style, do yourself a huge favor and get a Corona, this is the worst Mexican beer Ive ever tried. Absolutley pitiful."
"Appearance from within this 1qt. clear bottle is a light golden yellow that leaves no head in the glass. Smell of light corn, malt with not much else to it. Taste has sweet corn and a light hop and seems pretty watered down with a light mouthfeel. Not much depth to it, but a great thirst quencher on those hot lawn mowing days."
"Drinkability: I'm glad this stuff was free. I doubt I'll have it again. It may have just been because my beer was outside (I don't know how long it was there), but this just seemed stale and crappy."
"""Thanks"" to bort for giving me this brew as my ugly in the Good, Bad, and Ugly BIF. Pours the color of urine with a thin head. Not much smell except maybe corn. Does not have much taste at all which is better than a kick in the balls bad taste. Mouthfeel is OK & it is drinkable in the same sense as water. I was afraid this would be a lot worse. Not a drain pour but not something you would choose to drink."
"Better than Corona but that's not saying much. If in Mexico and it's over 30c / 85f I'll have a couple but otherwise no. It's too light, little if any flavor, but is drinkable with a lime. Don't go out of your way for this unless you drink swill like Coors as your daily beer."
"Pours clear yellow with a fizzy yellow head out of the clear bottle. Corn syrup, metal, and skunk all over the taste and aroma. Stick the lime in and pretend its a Corona, because that's pretty much what this is, even down to the clear glass bottle with the painted label."
"Not something I would go out of my way to drink again."
"Certainly not a beer to go around looking for if I feel like a drink. Also never see it on draught either."
"D: I hadn't had this beer before, and I shant be having it again. There are much better macro lagers out there"
"Slam 'er down hard is about the only way"
"I have had many, many Sol cervezas both in America and in Mexico. I can tell a bit of a difference between the US and Mexican versions (the US bottled is better than the Mexican cans, but I have not had a Sol in a can in the US). On tap, this beer is pretty darn good on a hot day in Mexico. It has a little skunky flavor, but I enjoy it much more than XX and Tecate as it is very light and refreshing."
"the only thing impressive about this one is the head that comes to the top of this one, about 4 to 5 fingers, after that all i smell is corn, the taste dry with a sour taste at the end, its not real flavorable at all, just what i would expect from a macro lager, more conserned about fast concumption by frat boys than any thing that might resembel flavor. great stile on the painted lable but not a beer that i want agan"
"It comes in a clear bottle, so it is easy to see that this is a typical, not inspiring clear straw yellow. Aroma is so-so; I had a hard time discerning it thanks to the obligatory lime, which masked what little aroma the beer has. Flavor is typical of a lager, rather thin and not memorable. Texture is smooth - the best aspect of this beer."
"D: You can drink this stuff because it is a step above the cheap stuff you bought in college. Otherwise, I can't really see myself buying this one again."
"More yeast taste in the brew. Adjuncts, lemon hops. Tastes like a bad homebrew. Too much carbonation with a really light watery body is a bad combo here"
"Don't drink and review."
"It's quite chuggable, not a good sign if you're looking for some taste."
"Drinkability is actually quite good for hot weather refreshment. Might be a good alternative to water. A better choice than Corona for sure."
"D: With some lemon & sunshine, it might be alright."
"Very pale piss yellow, bubbly with small white head and little lacing,not much to the nose here,some grains and wet grass,no skunk though,suprised me,you can taste the grains,grass and maybe a little sour that puckers the mouth,very lite,goes down really easy,not for sipping just chug-a-lug on a hot day,very easy to drink and drink....no buzz though."
"PROST"
"Very easy drinker. This beer was much better than I had expected. I bought a few of these in Mexico while on a cruise since they were $3 cheaper than the beer on the boat. This is one of the better macros I've had."
"Mouthfeel is very watered down and over carbonated. Not good at all."
"Notes: A Mexi-lager that you can out down cold out of a cooler. Has its place in that capacity."
"For what it is, not a bad brew. I will be buying some more."
"I was not impressed with this beer and I cannot imagine it gets any better at the source (in Mexico). My wife tells me they sell these two for $1 on the beaches of Cancun. Needless to say, I think they probably are overcharging."
"a great mexican beer, not as good as tecate, but way better than the overrated corona. this beer is very refreshing and is good with lime and salt on a hot day. they finally started selling it by my house, its a little pricey for a six pack, but a 32oz caguama is cheaper than a 24oz of corona"
"Some sweet malts on the nose with notable corn scents as well. Taste is more on the malty side and with a slight bitterness in the finish. Carbonation is moderate allowing for a decent feel and drinkability. Not too fizzy like their light beer."
"D: OK with mexican food I guess. A cut above Corona, but that's not saying much."
"D: Overall a sweet drinking beer by style, probably good for the warm weather and beaches of mexico. Would definitely pick this over a corona any day."
"Tried this beer just for the heck of it. It tasted bad and tasted like weak lemonade. Did not like it at all. It was pale in color and a weak appearance. I guess all beers from Mexico are not alike. This beer looks and taste as if someone brewed it in there backyard. I'm not a fan of Bud but next to Sol but was far and above 99% better"
"I had this last week while down in Cozumel in a can while wandering around the island. Hard to tell for sure on the appearance, other than peering into the can in the massive sunlight. Seemed okay; I would assume that it's the same appearance as their bottle offerings in the states. In 88 degree weather and 70% humidity, the smell and mouthfeel were decent. However, the taste was difficult due to the rapid warming nature of the beer in my hand in that environment - it got hot quickly. But, when I first cracked it open, it was quite drinkable. Apparently, many locals prefer this beer along with Dos XX. Myself, I stuck with Negra Modelo on tap at the resort for free."
"Drinkability was pretty good! They go quickly and certainly leave a stigma in the mouth for wanting to drink more. Overall, it isn't a bad beer at all. I'd but it again to battle against the hot summer days of this burning sun!"
"Served straight from the bottle. Bartender did not offer a glass. Ice-cold this is crisp, slightly sweet, and not alot going on. As it warms a bit it is slightly more flavorful but not in a great way. I never let it warm too much as I knew what it would taste like. Some adjunct flavors are detected but when drank at a cold enough temp, they aren't horrible. Yes, avoid, but when you are offered a mystery beer on the cheap. Try it and enjoy cold."
"I feel dirty giving this such high marks but hey, it's not trying to be an IPA. It is definitely, definitely better than the majority of macro lagers out there. Within the style, a surprisingly good brew."
"Overall not the worst macro I've had. I'd drink this before a Corona."
"This is a very underwhelming beer. The color is pale, straw yellow. Fizzy white head. Smell & taste? Well, there really is no smell & taste to this beer. Maybe a hint of malt in there somewhere. Otherwise, it really just tastes just *slightly* stronger than carbonated water. Could you drink a bunch of these on a hot summer day at the beach? Sure. Would you enjoy it as much as a Dos Equis? Not at all."
"Drink: It's... OK. If you like Corona, give this one a try. It's better in my opinion, but I dislike both."
"Might as well buy some Tecate for humors sake. Better than Corona, but that's not saying much. Skip it."
"d: Well, like I said, it doesn't taste gross. That is the biggest complement I will give to Sol. I suppose its total lack of aroma, flavor and mouthfeel could make it appealing to some. Of course these would be people who do not like beer or flavor in general. I guess this would be an acceptable beer if you wanted to pound as many as possible, but BAs should avoid it for sure."
"This beer poured a corn yellow with a very small head. The smell is some sweetness and some grassiness. The taste is very typical of an American macrobrew with some sweetness and maybe a little bit of citrus. The mouthfeel is very watery with some light carbonation. The only thing this beer really has going for it is drinkability, but even then it's nothing to write home about. Typical American macro in a Mexican bottle."
"There's not much to say about this beer. It looks like any other Macro - clear, golden with a bit of head and some lacing. Smells cheap - like beer, but not. Taste is fine - nothing stands out. Mouthfeel is on the harsh side and thin. All of that said, this would be easy to drink a lot of on the beach, especially if you add the lime or whatever. I like my beer without fruit, but if you enjoy that sort of thing, this would be extremely easy to drink. Recommendation to avoid."
"Just took a sip of this from a friend's beer to get the rating. Let's just pretend that he didn't squeeze a lime in it and turn it upside town to distribute the juice through the beer, because that would be an unfair advantage to Sol's rating. I didn't detect anything worth writing home about, so I won't."
"This is a very simple beer, no outstanding qualities. Imagine this would be refreshing to drink if it's above 40 C outside. Other then that, there's no reason to drink it."
"Avoid."
"Quite drinkable. At 2 bucks for 32 ounces, quite a decent deal, too."
"From a 33 cl clear bottle...clear yellow color with a shallow white head. Not much of a brew to look at: average. The aroma is a mix of sweet malt, cereal grains, and grassiness. It's not a faint aroma, like many macro's, but it's certainly not a pleasing or appealing smell. Lightly sweet in taste, but also quite watery. Adjunct flavors (corn?), and a unappealing hollowness. Light in body. Not much of a finish, and almost zero bitterness. Better than a lot of it's competitors, but still nothing that I'd ever look forward to drinking."
"I just returned from a trip to Mexico and this was the beer of choice on the small island I stayed on. The big difference is this. The Sol I drank in Mexico was different than the beer I drank in the states. The Sol in Mexico tasted well, much more fresh, for lack of a better term. Everyone I knew on the island who drank Sol bought it the day they drank it, storing the beer was not done. I was even directed to the store that moved more beer so that it would be fresh. This is a beer that was crisp refreshing and easy to drink. A great social beer, easy to drink with fresh fish meals and spicy foods. A mild Pilsner style, much better than Corona. No lime needed. I probably would not buy it in the states, I will wait for another Mexican trip."
"Easy to drink if you just want a cold glass of water. Avoid this one."
"12 oz. glass glass bottle- color of bright gold, with a medium white colored head - nose of light grass oats, and sweet  taste of citrus mainly lime zest, and watery - body is nonexistent thin and weak, and with low carbonation  aftertaste is not there , and semi-lingering"
"No head, not bad mouthfeel...some hops...very little malt...not much flavour but is expected. Best served with a lime. I think its a great social beer plus the bottle says class. Good all around macro lager...much worse out there."
"Reviewing as a macro lager. 12oz clear bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium gold with a 1 finger head, very little longevity and just OK lace. Light honey and malt aromas mixed with a bit of rice. Tasting it, its very light. Some malt flavors mixed with rice and a touch of hops. Even as macros go, this one is below average in taste. You could drink a ton of these though. Very nice if your on the beach and its 90 degrees out."
"This beer doesn't have much complexity but some things are better simple. I'd say that this beer is just an over all decent light beer. In my opinion it's a better version of a corona."
"Best drunk when dying of thirst in the desert. Otherwise forget it."
"Drinkability : pas terrible"
"This is a nice alternative to the more popular and well-known Corona... This pours a nice yellow color that would look appealing on a hot summer day... The smell is about average for this type of beer... The taste is pretty good - nothing to write home about, but would definitely be enjoyable on a nice lazy day in the backyard or relaxing on a beach somewhere warm... It's a brew that's easily drinkable and I wouldn't mind downing one of these on occasion... If you enjoy Corona, you would definitely be pleased with this sample..."
"Had this for the second time today straw with a white head. Didn't have much smell so just average for a Mexican brew. The tasted was pretty good nothing really stood out. It had a good amount of carbonation but wasn't bad in the mouth. Overall drinkability I could have a few of these while having fun in the sun but not my favorite Mexican brew. Would recommend it with the standard salt and lime."
"I tried Sol for the first time while on my Honeymoon is Mexico. Maybe it was just because it was an open bar but I really enjoyed the stuff. It went really well with all of our meals and was just as nice while lying on the beach. This has definitely replaced Corona for me when I eat at a Mexican joint."
"Could drink a lot of these, super light brew"
"I guess if you are attempting not to drink the water and you're in Mexico and it's 47 C with the humidity, then this is a beer you'll be reaching for."
"D: If this beer is uber cold and it is a super hot day out. It manages to hit the spot. I had it on this 91 degree day in September with some pizza and it suited me fine."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability : Very dry beer, you would look for some water around after having a couple, cheap beer and really average."
"D: A below average macro lager, drinkable, but not really anything that makes me want to come back to it, would be a good thirst quencher on a hot day."
"D - Overall, not great, but an easy-drinking bland macro."
"Drinkability: OK on a hot day I suppose. There seems to be no end to the number of Mexican Macro Lagers I can get here. In a crowded market segment his one does not set itself apart from any of those, though."
"poured a clear light golden color with a frothy one finger head that disappeared to just the beer and no lacing at all. smell was weak, corn grain and metalic. taste weak corn grain and that was it. mouthfeel weak, watery, weak carbonation, drinkability? i don't think so."
"A worthy substitute to Corona? Ah, why not (anything is)! The beer really has no redeeming qualities except for maybe the image and associations it might have go along with it. I've had this beer a few times, and even on occasion enjoyed it. Tonight is not one such occasion, however, if in the mood for Mexican swill this can do the trick about as well as any other option."
"Pours a clear amber, thin fluffy white head forms, disappears very fast, leaves a few lace spots, no retention. Smell is sweet, very corny/adjunct, bit of citrus/floral, wheat, not very much aroma. Taste is almost non existent, sweet corn, some floral, light citrus, no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, almost nothing there. Can see how it might be refreshing in hot weather if it were up your alley, although there are better picks."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a standard lager in appearance, golden in color with a thin ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. The smell is non-distinct, slight graininess and a hint of the lime that the beer was served with. Taste has a slight fruitiness about it that is accented with the served lime. Not overly tasty, but it is crisp and quenches your thirst. Overall this beer is drinkable but not overly desirable."
"*obviously a joke since it's clear that no such job exists"
"no too impressed. better than corona. its very refreshing. good on a hot summer day. Kind of like a beach beer. good with a wedge of lime. It doesnt have much of a taste to be honest its a very mild beer. goes down extremely easily. i kinda wish there was more to the head tho. it goes away in like 2 seconds"
"D - This is really boring stuff. Weak nose and very little flavor. This might be a good choice for someone on vacation who wants to lay out on the beach with an authentic Mexican brew, but doesn't normally drink beer. It does kill the heat though...so I wouldn't turn one down whilst basking in the Caribbean sun."
"Poured a very clear yellow, practically foamless. This had to be one of the most tasteless beers I've ever encountered - reminded me of Coors Light but even lighter. I have to question the 4.50% ABV on this one - it took about 3 of these before I began to feel anything. I'm usually impressed with Mexican lagers (Corona the exeption) but this one was very disappointing. I would not buy this one again."
"Cheers, amigos!!!! UN-DUH-LAY!!!! :o)"
"This is definitely along the same vein as Corona - a light mexican lager, begging for a lime in the neck. That being said, its not a horrible beer, and it tastes a bit better than Corona to me. Best served on a hot day with a lime, and ocean side. Seems to be a bit cheaper both in the US and Mexico than its more popular counterpart."
"giblet"
"D: Tasty for the style, goes down easily, not too filling, even though there are much better beers out there, this one isnt too bad for a macro."
"Overall: characterless and empty. I still have to find a good Mexican beer."
"The drinkability is high, since it can be very refreshing on those hot days."
"Part of a Mexican Sampler from Costco. Cool bottle but not much smell in the bottle, just a little bit of corn. Color is a pale yellow as evidenced through the clear bottle. Poured into my chalice had a little bit of head that quickly disappeared. Taste is sublime, not sweet or bitter, not much backbone. Mouthfeel is ok carbonation seems right but nothing standing out in this brew. Best thing about this brew may be the cool painted bottle. I'll have to save the rest for when it's time to mow the lawn or catch some rays in the hot sun. Refreshing but very basic."
"A good alternative to a Corona. Tried this at the 9:30 Club last week. Nice and light, with medium carbonation and a crisp mouthfeel. Nothing distinct about the flavor, but the color was a bit off. Maybe I'm just not used to seeing that color yellow through a clear bottle though. Worth a try, but nothing special."
"Believe it or not but there is a difference between Sol and Corona - albeit a small one - and Sol comes out on top. When I was in the Yucatan last year I spoke with a local guide who explained that most of the locals prefer Sol, while Corona is sold to the Americans. Having said all this, it is still a basic Mexican lager which is best served on a hot and humid day. Though I prefer mine with a lime I don't feel it's as much of a necessity as with Corona. Complex, dark and sophisticated? No. Cool, refreshing and drinkable? Yes."
"i'm ashamed to say it wasn't that long ago that i really digged this beer. maybe because i first had it when i was thirsty as fuck on a hot summer day. maybe because i didn't know good beer. at least it's a step up from bmc but basically the same thing. fizzy pale yellow beer. i used to like the buttery diacetyl and corn adjunct flavor aroma in this. no malt or hop character. not much else going on to speak of. at least with sol i didn't need a lime to make it palatable. light in body, short, crisp finish."
"Let's be frank - this is a Corona clone, plain and simple. That being said, in my experience, it's not only succeeded but surpassed its inspiration. The body, aroma, mouthfeel and taste are all the same - I wonder if theirs is a citrus brew as well. On top of that, the label is much more engaging and they've recently dropped their price (at least in my area) to 8.99 a Twelve Pack vs. the standard 12.99 - 13.99 for Corona. If you're a fan of an ice-cold Mexican, probably with a lime, on a hot summer day, switch to Sol."
"D - Not impressive. It is fairly typical of the style and the country of origin. It's probably very refreshing on a sunny beach in Cancun, but a little dull in your living room on a cool night."
"Easy enough to drink because its really hard to offend taste buds if the beer taste like nothing. Probably pretty good if your working out in a Mexican field all day long. Another free one from my AB buddy."
"I don't think I would want more of this beer, I'm glad I only got 1."
"D: As long as the following criteria are met: it's hot outside and you want something cold to drink, this brew is served w/at least one lime, and it's served ICE cold, this beer is fairly drinkable (not to mention it's cheap in Progresso, Mexico). However, if the above criteria are not met, this brew would get a 1 for drinkability in my book."
"In a world where there are plenty of excellent, full flavored beers, there's no reason whatsoever to drink this anymore... and I don't intend to."
"Not very high on the Macro Lager scale. It's hard to believe, but there are better ones out there."
"Bought this out of pure curiosity, having recently been trying some Central & South American beers with mixed results. One of the dullest beers I've ever had. Won't get this again."
"It's a lifeless light color with a pale, fizzy head. Perhaps the only good thing to say about this beer is that it's not skunky like some of its neighbors. But really, it's on the border (no pun intended) of being light beer. Very faint smells of corn and the taste of good ol' Green Giant canned corn, if not carbonated water. I'm sorry that I tried this beer, but at least it didn't cost me much for a single bottle."
"There are cheap, swilly mexican beers which could actually be refreshing on a very hot day with the dreaded lime. Then there's Sol, which fails the ""if handed a free one"" test. Water please."
"Drinkability- This is one of those beers that you drink ice-cold on a hot day. No other time should this beer be intersecting your taste-buds."
"Very light bodied, a bit watery, as most Mexican brews. Refreshing and easy to drink. Although a typical light Mexican lager in most respects, the taste is a bit ahead of the pack. The flavor is light enough to drink with most food, but seems meant to wash down spicy foods of whatever variety.."
"Crystal clear, barely yellow color with thin white head and essentially boring appearance. Nose is corn syrup and adjunct city. Taste is sweet but decent and rather refreshing. Pseudobitter but more nasty than true bitter flavor to the aftertaste takes away any momentum this beer has built up. The mouthfeel is watery and not going to win too many accolades from the likes of me. This is subpar Mexican lagaer, almost indistinguishable from its stablemates Carta Blanca, Tecate, etc. No thank you."
"still wouldnt buy it again though."
"No head, no lacing. Beer is amber-ish yellow. Taste is slightly sweet and not great but totally inoffensive. For what it's worth, this stuff is actually pretty drinkable, as in, I could drink a lot of it."
"Another BA said that it's better than Corona... I agree, far better. In the crop of Mexican beers this one stands out. There are better beers out there, but this one isn't bad by any means."
"This beer pours a very pale yellow into the glass. The most remarkable part of the appearance is the decent head and the amount of lacing that is left on the glass. Other than this there isn't much to speak of. The aroma is of some grains and a bit of hops, weakly. The taste is a perfect example of why many BA's avoid micros like the plague-- there is simply nothing there. If you have one of these and don't mind it i suppose you can have more but there is much better beer out there."
"Pours a clear fizzy golden with barely any head and not much carbonation going on. Smells of sweetish grains and not much else. Really impressed for what a beer of this style is able to pull off. Yes, I get some grain and adjuncty flavors, but I also get a sweet malty flavor that is quite unique when compared to other similar beers. This is a thin and light bodied beer. No surprises. This has a decent malty flavor while maintaining its lightness. I like it."
"M & D- High carbonation, easy enough to drink, it's just that I don't want to. Far too watery and lacking flavor. One or two is good with some spicy Mexican food though...and could do the same 1-2 on a very hot day. I would just rather have something with more body and flavor. I'm not a huge lager fan and this is on the low end of lagers."
"Bottle: Poured a bright yellow color beer with a small bubbly head with very little retention. Aroma of corn and adjunct is totally dominating and not very interesting. Taste is bland and boring with some corn being sensible and for the rest it is mostly watery. Just another boring pale lager I guess."
"Clear, but not interesting. Nothing offends me and nothing attracts. Just another Corona - from a different brewery. Avoid it!"
"Overall it's pretty vapid, which limits it's drinkability because there's just nothing there to keep your attention. And you can't really use the ""on a hot day"" excuse either because almost and golden, adjunct beer would do at that point."
"the drinkability is average as I don't especially care for corona. I will say this beer is better than corona."
"I could see myself drinking a lot of these if I needed to. Seriously, in a blind taste test, Id bet you would have trouble guessing that this was made in Mexico. I must say, I was impressed by this beer."
"The thing is, there's not much taste, smell or anything to it. Bland, watered down, just your macro lager. It doesn't taste or smell bad, it's just that it quite almost doesn't smell or taste at all. Yellow fizzy water, with a hint of beer."
"Sol pours a light yellow with a fluffy white head from a clear bottle with silk-screened graphics (cool label in my opinion). Not much in the way of smell, and what little smell there is isn't good. Taste is fairly bland. I expected it to be more offensive as I'm not a fan of the Mexican version of lagers with a few exceptions. Fairly drinkable as lawnmower beer."
"Flavor actually isn't as bad as i thought from the aroma, but that's not to say it's good. It is somewhat crisp, and there is some mild hoppiness present, but the corniness lingers on the pallete, and it's not a very plesent flavor. I wish I had a corona to rate this side-by-side as I am thinking this is a better option than Corona (also not sayiing alot there..). Bottom line, any beer that needs a fruit wedge (lime in this ones case) to enhance drinkability is probably lacking a bit in the flavor department. Decent lawnmower fodder."
"As the name sugests ""sol"" sun, is to be dunk at the beech under unbearable heat and extreme thirst. Nobody should drink sol to taste it."
"This is a hallmark beer for me , as I have finally convinced myself NOT to buy beers that are highly likely to be poor beers and wait , just wait for someone else to buy it for you.This is the first of what I hope will be many, so that I can reserve my money for decent beer."
"Pours a very pale straw color with a lot of bubbly head that takes a while to fade. Smells a little of yeast, and a little flowery, not too bad. Tastes slightly sweet, but with no malt flavor, and no hop flavor at all. Really doesn't taste like much of anything. Mouthfeel is very watery with no creaminess and not much carbonation. Again, like nothing. All in all, it's very drinkable, because it tastes like water. Much better than bad beer, but much worse than good flavorful beer."
"I am not a Corona fan so it was with some reluctance that I tried the beer that is sometimes referred to as a poor-man's-Corona. I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. The presentation of the actual bottle is excellent and the beer itself is a pleasing pale yellow. As expected, not much aroma to speak of but there was a slightly sweet undertone. The taste was significantly better than that of Corona despite the similar corn flavors. No lime necessary. Being smooth and refreshing are this beers main pluses. Goes down like a glass of water and is perfect for outdoor drinking any day the temp climbs over 75 degrees."
"""Cerveza Importada"" ....yeah, whatever."
"Sol is a very good choice for those hot summer days but always will be better than Corona."
"Drinkability/Overall: I would say its better than corona or cantina but does the same job on a hot say but doesnt offer a taste bud rush of quality taste."
"-UF"
"Drinkability - Goes down like water, could down a 6-pack of this easily. With lime it's excellent."
"a beer only for drink with buddies, my father´s favorite beer, i dont think that this beer is good for food, but its presentation in 12 oz bottle is fantastic for drink, in a domino, etc, drinkability is over the average because i drink a couple if days in the week; however i recommended 75%."
"Taste is much what I expected. Corn syrup sweet in the beginning and ending with the slightest hint of something bitter. Or maybe past it's prime? I can't tell. Overall this ranks about in line with Corona. Not impressed and would never buy on my own. There are better Mexican beers out there."
"It depends of the presentation, regular bottles taste nice for a while, non retornable and cans are impossible to drink for someone who likes craft beers. But it may be, according to some rumours, because these last presentations are filled with the beers who went beyhond the date."
"An OK tropical lager beer. Nothing special, but not bad either."
"Another one of those imported beers that will work on a hot summer day. This is not a beer that I see myself buying a 6 pack of soon. It's a nice alternate to Corona and similiar in taste."
"poured a pale amber yellow color with large white head that fell to a slight ring. Smell is of a little sweetness and slight malt. Tste is of a little malt and some corn textures. Mouth feel is refreshing and satisfying. Not a great beer but hits the spot on a hot day."
"Maybe I am just tired of seeing Corona, but unlike many of the other reviews, I enjoy a nice ice cold Sol over a Corona anyday. Is it full and powerful bursting with malts and hops, no. But, it does have a slightly light malt flavor. It goes down smooth with or without that lime they love so much. Sit in a bar, drink a Sol, and watch the ocean. Thats what its there for."
"Poured out to an over-carbonated white bubbly head with no lace around the glass. Not much of an aroma, hints of straw and malt were noted, but very light. Flavor was unimpressive, very weak, with overtones of corn and a touch of grain. Very watery. Finished weak and light. I guess this could be a lawnmower beer, but otherwise, rather boring. Worth a try for fans of Mexican beers."
"One of the most watered down tasting beers I've ever tried."
"Really easy to drink --if the thermometer climbs above 100!"
"(12 oz. silk screened clear bottle)"
"The beer pours a very yellow color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is unimpressive. It has a very dry pale malt scent with adjuncts and a lager yeast aroma. It really is devoid of any real beer smell. The taste is unimpressive as well. This beer tastes like watered down swill. It has a very light pale malt flavor that is almost undetectable. This beer must be loaded up with adjuncts. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a terrible beer. I've had other adjunct lagers that were much more flavorful than this. Michelob Ultra drinkers would probably go nuts for this. It's one and done for me."
"Poured a clear light golden, no head to speak of, no smell to speak of, no taste to speak of, not bad, not good, not really anything, I couldn't really discern any taste or smell from this, I guess it would be better than drinkin water in the hot Mexican climate!, plus...ya can't really drink the water in Mexico!"
"Overall-I still have to review Corona but from my last memory of it it was not as good as this beer, which is being called a Corona clone. Overall this beer isn't much to look at but it has a solid taste and is very drinkable, which is what counts most anyways. Then again you could get the same results with other lagers for less. A fine change of pace beer though.Give it a try and see what you think."
"Consumed October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. Pretty much a Corona knock off. Copy any Corona review and rate it a little lower. Pours straw yellow. Smells kinda skunky. Heavier han expected carbonation, but more watery than expected. Very dry finish also. Nice bottle, but that's about the only praise from me. If that's all they had at the beach, I guess it would have to do. Go for the Corona any time over this."
"This cerveza pours a light golden yellow color with a frothy head that quickly dissipates. Smell was a little skunky, but other than that I couldn't really detect much of anything else. Having not had anything to drink all day this actually tasted pretty good at the outset, but as my tastebuds awoke I found this beer to be too light. What I did taste was some hints of malting and not much else. Too much carbonation. After pretty much downing one I hardly felt anything so I went on to the next. It went well with chips and salsa, but then again so would water."
"I've always said anything you HAVE to add a lime to must not taste that great, that being said Sol follows that line. Pours a clear gold yellow with no head to speak of. The smell is of grain and hints of citric syrup. The taste is flat and grainy, corn with no sweetness to back it up, very rough. Light bodied and just another mexican beer. I had to add a lime just to finish."
"Hmm. This is not a very good beer. Still it is a better beer than any Anheuser Busch product and about even with the norm from a brand such as Miller."
"Continuing my tour of macro Mexican beers with this Sol, cost me $1.99 for a 32 ounce bottle. Appearance is standard pale lager, nose is adjunct standard. Nothing unexpected. Taste is actually pretty good, compares to an above average American macro. No off-tastes or bad after taste. Definently not a craft beer, but unoffensively drinkable."
"A bit better than Corona but still a bog standard mexi lager"
"Ok, so we go out with a friend to a bar/club in paris, and he says 'ill get us a beer'. I say ok, hoping his like for witbier (the minimum you get at this sort of place) will last. He pops a bottle with a lemon inside, to mi disgrace, i said 'ugh, corona'. I sip it, corona. I smell it, corona. I ask for a glass, pour it, corona. But as i poured, i see the label, printed into the bottle (like corona), reading 'sol'. Couldn't be. It's just as mediocre and needs a lemon as well. same bottle, same pisswater bottled. How depressing. mexicans."
"Add a lime and you can pretend you are on a beach in Mexico. This beer is like a friend of friend of a friend that you met once at lunch or happy hour--they were okay but nothing special."
"Pretty solid, average beer. But I wouldn't drink it except to hold the bottle it comes in."
"Drinkable as in, only if I have no other choice. This is not a good brew!"
"Taste is as bland as the beer looks. A bit of sweetness and not much else. Here is one beer that a lime helps the taste as there is no real taste to begin with. The beer is very thin and watery. Why would anyone drink this?"
"Looks like a Corona (pale gold), tastes like a Corona (has that funny 'edge' most Mexican macros have but otherwise is pretty tasteless.) Didn't smell like much of anything and has an unpleasant aftertaste. On a hot summer day this might be OK with a lime, certainly not my choice though. If you like Corona you might like this, they are pretty similar in color and taste. Buy whichever one is cheaper, they're interchangeable."
"This beer is kind of like corona in look and taste. However, I liked this more than corona because the smell wasn't so skunky. This was also pretty drinkable, mainly because it tasted like water. I didn't try it with a lime, which may have given the beer some positive taste. Overall, I don't see a purpose in drinking this any more since it doesnt offer a distinctive taste that I could enjoy, although I would be willing to have it at a party or something."
"Pours a clear pale gold under a big but thin white head that fades quickly to film but does leave some decent lacing. The smell is pretty grim - corn, dirty laundry, and bitter lemon. The mouth is prickly and heavy from a hint of corn syrup. The taste has lots of grain and popcorn features, followed by, well, nothing actually. No hops, no finish, really no aftertaste. This is not really, really horrible, but it sure is unsatisfying."
"Its drinkable and certainlly much better than Corona..ah well but i can wait another 13 years until I have another."
"A nice mexi-lager sampled in Tijuana. A light golden colour with light aromas of hops and malts. The taste is well balanced but the mouthfeel is a bit too watery for my tastes. The drinkability, however, is wonderful in the 90 degree Tijuana winter sun!"
"This beer poured into the glass a crystal clear golden yellow that when held up was chock full of carbonation bubbles dancing in the light. The head that was produced was pure white in color, somewhat sticky, and lasted for a few moments then fell to nothing but a ring on the edges. Some sticky lace present. The aromas were hardly there, very plain. I nosed corn grains, pepper, and light alcohol. Not very appealing in the aroma dept. just plain. The tastes were alittle better then the smell, I tasted some malt, corn (grain, husk), black pepper, a hop and an overall feeling of wateriness on the tongue. The aftertaste was more of a feeling of water and hints pepper. Light to light medium bodied. Not that good of a beer, the lime is a must. I tried drinking without for rating, but the lime is needed. It also must be served cold. As it warms, it becomes less desirable. Not a great example of Mexican beer."
"It's interesting that Corona would is more popular than Sol, considering Sol is the same type of beer, about the same price, and is better than Corona in my opinion. Pale yellow in color, smells of corn. Also tastes somewhat like corn. I'm not sure if I'd drink this again, but I'll take it over Corona."
"Comments  This is one bad beer. The Sol has set."
"Mamma told me if I ain't got nothin' nice to say, don't say nothin' at all. Pours a light straw color, if you're inclined to actually do so. Also smells and tastes like straw. A bit of a can of corn flavor, with slightly more more life than a corona but not worth the movement to remove the cap. Nothing terribly offensive at least. Really, this is some crappy stuff."
"This beer is the best of both worlds."
"It pours to a brilliant, clear straw color with a white head. The aroma is grainy, with corn aromas. The flavor is light in malt and hops, with a bit of sweet graininess. It is very light in body. There is not much to say about this beer. I'd never drink it again."
"Because of the lack of skunk and harshness, this is a little bit easier to drink than Corona. It would probably benefit from being served with a lime, although I had none handy at the time. In summary, this is another mainstream Mexican beer that can be passed over."
"Pours a yellowish colour topped by a very poor thin head that fades very quickly. The aroma consists of hops and very light lemon hints. Awuful taste PLUS while in the mouth it doesn't feel like beer at all. As long as u swallow it before it even touches ur taste buds this beer goes down like water. If it does touch ur taste buds u might even want to spit it. Just don't drink this beer."
"Got a sixer of this the other day. I was in the mood for a real light beer, so a real light beer I got. If I were a football team(hypothetically speakin' ofcourse) and I was looking for some drink to have during the game, I would go with Sol, because it's so watery. It's watery, but refreshing. Other than that, it has no redeeming qualities. I might get it again, if I am looking for imported water... er um, beer."
"The beer pours a clear gold with a smallish white head that is bubbly in texture, the lace a decent covering sheet with the front sweet and lightly malted, top is watery. Finish is somewhat acidic, the hops mild and the aftertaste sweet and somewhat dry, a totally forgettable beer."
"I didn't mind this beer as much as previous reviewers. The context may have something to do with my opinion since I was in Mexico where good beers are few and far between. The color was the typical lager yellow and the flavor did yearn for lime. However, there was no Corona aftertaste, and it did feel good going down. With an ABV of 6%, it was a more welcome beer than others in MX."
"Yikes but this is not a very good beer. We had no other option on a Margarita Cruise in Acapulco so I had a few cups of this to verify my dislike. Typical Mexican watered down, yellow, bland crud."
"One of these is enough....but I am glad I met it.....ABV listed on this imported bottle at 4.5.....Limited carbonation leaving a flat taste and limiting drinkability....no harmful aftertaste but also no desire for another...."
"Pours a very clear golden color with a small head that fades quickly as do most of this style.  The smell is that of a slight hint of hops and sweet grain and corn which also seems to be common to the style.  Has a dry type taste that drops off quickly while leaving your mouth with the taste of almost pure water.  Odd experience with each swallow!  You have to discern the taste quickly because it disappears as quickly as it comes.  Hops can be tasted in this brew but much else....I don't know except the normal VERY faint sweet corn taste.  Not good in my book.  Salud!"
"Just like Corona, needs a lime  any beer that needs a lime is not worth drinking.A sub-premium lager."
"Sol:  I do not know how I got this, but it was much better than several mexi-lagers I’ve had in the past.  Every thing about this beer screams light: aroma, body, taste, head, and appearance.  On the other hand it did not have that unpleasant aroma of Corona, and it was as easy a beer to drink as I’ve ever had."
"Medium gold color with lively carbonation, decent snow white head, modest lace.  Cooked vegetable aroma with astringent odors as well, slight hints of malt.  Taste is quite weak, little more than carbonated mineral water.  Hints of malt at the beginning, lots of stinging carbonation and a powdery dry finish with some washed out hops.  I am not certain that I would recognize this as beer in a blind taste test - not saying that to be insulting to this beer, but the taste is that weak.  Try Carta Blanca instead."
"A beer with zero flavour, and very similiar to Corona, i suppose i'd drink it if i was in Mexico, but why bother when at home with abigger selection?"
