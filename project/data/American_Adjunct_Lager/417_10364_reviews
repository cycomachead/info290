"This is a good cheap beer. It has a very unique taste, which some love but I admittedly don't. Still, looks great and goes down smooth. It also gets points for being brewed in my home state of MN."
"This is a classic beer, with rich flavor, and an unpretentious reputation originating in Northeast Minneapolis. I rate it so highly based on its simplicity, full flavor, and also quite if bit of nostalgia."
""
"Smells fruity, kinda like bananas."

"This is what I drank before before the craft beer explosion. Well, this and Summit Pale Ale. It's got a whole lot more flavor than Bud, which isn't saying much, and I still buy it for making beer brats--then save the leftovers for guests who don't appreciate the ""good stuff."" Overall? It's okay. But if I want to really enjoy a lager, I'll pick up some Brooklyn."

"As a Minnesotan, this is what I ""grew up"" with, as far as my early beer-drinking days went. It's better than your typical American lager, and is sometimes what I'll buy when I need a break from my beloved stouts and other heavier beers, especially in the summer. Is it a world-class beer? No, but it's a quality, easy-drinking beer that's a good value. It's like a friend you occasionally hook up with, but don't feel awkward or ashamed about afterwards."

"This is my fallback when not drinking craft brews. It doesnt taste like water like most macrobrews, easy drinking when you plan on having more than one. I also like that it is brewed in my home state of MN."
""
""
""
"This is my go-to, favorite beer.   Same for my grandfather and his grandfathers.  Goes down smooth and easy, and tastes soo good.  Beats Bud Light, Coors light, etc. for me on every level."

"Drain pour."
"That might not be everyone's idea of a good time, but I always have some Grain Belt standing by."
""
""
"Overall: well balanced and outstanding in the adjunct lager style. Perhaps the best I have had thus far."
""
"In short: You get what you pay for."

"hopped crap. there's a ton of AALs, especially grain belt, that are (in my opinion) better than most craft beers. anyway, overall a great beer and staple of the Midwest."
""
"Overall - This beer is a clear winner. It's got the right flavor in the right areas and keeps it simple. This beer is like High Life but better. Grain Belt is a beer I would recommend to friends for almost any occasion. The friendly beer!"

"Not going to lie, I'm a homer and this is the home town beer. Well, GBP and EPA are THE home town beers, but this is the original. It's a corny lager, not my favourite, but probably my second favourite. It's sort of sweet, which is my only complaint, but it's a nice sweetness. We like sweet here. Give me a Jucy Lucy and a Premo and some fries and I'm in fucking heaven. GBP is liquid history, a regional brand that somehow didn't get sucked into the multinational brewing conglomeration, a fucking time capsule. Your grandfather drank this beer. And so do his grand kids. I'm grateful for that and I'm proud that Pennsylvania and Minnesota somehow managed to keep the wolves at bay and retain their regional brewers (Schells in Mn's case, who keep the GB torch alight). A far from useful, but from the heart drunken review. You are welcome."

"What can I say. This is the greatest beer in the world for the price. Where else can you get a case of tasty suds for so little. I know you beer snobs will turn your noses up at this awesome Midwest treat that's been passed from father to son for over a hundred years. Clean,smooth and sweet. I love it goes great at the ball game,deer camp,or avoiding the wife. Take my recomendation and pick up a six pack of this you won't regret it. All hail to the big friendly!"
"Enjoyed this beer and would definitely purchase as a workhorse in the fridge if I lived local. See why it is very populer in the college town of Eau Claire."
""
""
" This is my ""Up North"" brew, in the taverns as well as the cabin. I love seeing the old Grain Belt signs in the small towns in north western Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Its great to see the neon Premium signs, and places still serving it on tap. The name Grain Belt, how working class, no nonsense can you get? Love it!"
""
""
""
"Well, this is a commercial beer that Schell's bought out some years ago so it is no suprise that it is a lot like other commercial American Lagers. However, I think this one is a cut above and makes for a great brew on hot day."
""
""
""
"A flavorful, clean, crisp lager. I wanted to dislike it, but I don't. Sweetness is almost too much, but it backs off right when I want it to. It's close to being really really good, with a few little things not quite measuring up. But overall, I dig it."
"At home I pour a 12 0z bottle into a pint glass, out, draft is usually pretty tasty."

"Overall, clean, crisp, refreshing, cheap (got a 12 pack of tall boys for $12), a bit above-average for the style. It is what it is and hits the spot after too many IPAs or Imperial Stouts, it helps to cleanse the palate."

"12 oz can into a pint glass. Thanks Bennett! This one pours a crystal clear yellow with a finger of awkward white foam. Excellent lacing and retention. Smell is cereal grains, sweet corn, and some chemical smelling fruit. Not a great aroma. Taste is spot on though. Great balance between the grainy malts and sweet corn with an underlying hop fruitiness. Clean and crisp this drinks very easily with no real aftertaste of any kind. Not overly carbonated or too thin. Just a damn solid adjunct lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a clear, light amber color with only a slight head. The aroma is mild with a fair amount of grains in the mix. Lots of flavorful grains in the taste that actually make this somewhat pleasant to drink. Reminds me of Miller Genuine Draft on steroids."
""
""
""
"Premium is kind of become a hipstery beer here in wisconsin, because you can't find it everywhere here, mostly just Minnesota, or wisconsin city near the border. Its a better than some of the other big macro brews, but not really better than high life , old milwaukee, or PBR in my opinion. Fun novelty beer in the sense that its not everywhere."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is like you would expect. Pretty much the same as a Miller High Life. Cereal grains with a sweet after taste. Nice light mouth feel. Almost a sour after taste. It's not offensive or over powering skunkiness like most cheap lagers that come in clear bottles. If you are in some small midwestern town bar and are looking to get drunk. I think this is the best you are going to find."

"Light, light yellow with a loose fitting cap of bone white foam. Absolute clarity. Smells super light, some grain, some maize, some grass clippings and a hint of bread. Taste is also really light with some light malt, a touch of cornbread with sweetness some slight bitterness and a overture of steel. Thin, real thin with moderate carb and an off dry finish. Could slam this all day on a hot one."

"Maybe I'm biased because I am from Minnesota, but I have always liked this beer. What I really like is the balance of the taste. The initial flavor is sweeter and somewhat fruitier than most American Lagers. But the after taste is a bit malty and grain-filled. I like that. It also has a fullness to the mouthful that I enjoy. The coloring is a beautiful gold, and although the smell is faint, it is inviting (especially on warm days)."

"Maybe my favorite lager, definitely one of my go to session brews. I like keeping a couple Big Friendlies around in case of emergency."
""
""
""
""

"Drinkability: It is decent enough, but the sweetness is very off-putting for a lawn mower lager. I’ll drink it regardless."
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Grab a 16 oz can for a dollar figuring it was worth a try. It's really what I expected. Light, crisp, refreshing but mostly devoid of any complex flavor. It has it's time and place, but it's nothing special (even for the style)."
"A buddy brought a 12pck of cans back with him from a recent trip to Minnesota. Beer poured a golden clear with thin white head. The smell and taste were a nice balance of malt, grain, and hop. The mouthfeel was light in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a good beer."

"Is it fantastic? Not really. It's cheap, tastes decent, and really beats the heat. Thumbs up."
"Overall: Above average in its category, but definitely in the bottom 10% of my favorite beers ever."
"O- It's not that good of a beer, but you know what? There's something enjoyable about these. Maybe it's just that it's an Adjunct Lager that is slightly better than some of the pack. Has worth at the baseball game."
"Poured a pale yellow with a light head that faded to lace quickly. Aroma was slightly sweet and was of malts and grains - slighltly fruity as well. Taste was unique - malt and corn with an interesting finish of light hoppiness. Tasted like High Life with an extra dash of corn just for good measure. That said, it was pleasantly different than other mass produced lagers in that corn flavor was not as bitter and unpleasant as many of them. Palate was acceptable but nothing special. Overall, not too bad for a cheaper pale lager."
"O - It's good as far as adjuncts go, I'd prefer it over most BMC stuff. Can drink all day, it's smooth and light."
"D: Extremely drinkable, but the taste might get a little bland after a while."
"O: When I'm in the mood for crappy beer this is a personal favorite, it has a fair amount of taste and aroma for an adjunct lager. Far from a great beer, but it's not terrible either. It's a good beer for when you're in the mood for crappy. To quote a co-worker of mine ""It's like Budweiser, but good."""
"Thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, some corn, slightly sweet. Taste is crisp, malty, a touch of sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good beer to have on a hot day."
"Can poured into my Capital Brewery tulip, just cuz. Pours a clear, light straw yellow with a nice big white head. Looked very classically like BEER. The nose is very bland, just a touch of sweetness and maybe the slightest suggestion of exposure to a hop or two. The taste is really nice for the style, drinks crisp with just the tinniest hint of blueberry, which really works for me. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, leaving just a bit of sweetness in the mouth. Overall, this is one of my preferred options for the AAL style. Can't call it a fantastic beer in any capacity, but that little hint of blueberry helps a ton."
"Notes: Premium is a decent beer with a little more body and flavor than others of the style have to offer. A bit too sweet for me, but sometimes it's just what's called for."
"I think a lot of people just dig this beer for the old school, retroness of it, its like PBR, but for the working man who doesn't smell and dress like hipster shit. My homie from MN swore by this stuff in school. Wasn't bad. Wouldn't be buying it anytime soon other, but it does belong in that cool class of adjunct beer like Blatz, Schlitz, Rhinelander etc. . ."
"As far as the American Adjunct Lager goes, this is the best I've had. It's smooth, inexpensive, and actually tastes fairly decent. If you're a BMC kind of guy that wants a real treat, I'd say check this one out."
"D - I was expecting some sort of BMC product with this but was pleasantly surprised. More flavorful and better drinking than its counterparts. Thanks to KeefD for the chance!"
"Overall this is my favorite adjunct lagger and it also bring back a lot of memories of growing up here in Minnesota. Great beer for the style but low on the complexity."
"Overall: A very tasty beer for an adjunct lager. By far my favorite for the style and a great tradition here in Minnesota."
"D: The sweetness...some have reviewed it as honey but it was more corn syrup to me, is just too much for my palate. There are several other adjuncts (such as PBR) that I would rather drink."
"There seems to be a slight sweetness in the flavor, along with some pronounced grains. I can actually taste some of the malts, although no hops. Overall, very drinkable, and always my choice over BMC."
"Drinkability- very drinkable but pales in comparison to Schlitz!"
"The corn puts the adjunct into this American Adjunct Lager, and they brewers are not being shy about it. In the end, a drinkable version of the style--better than many others I have had in this category."
"D - way easy to drink."
"Bottom line... there's little to commend in this basically light, watery, oddly flavored swill. Sure, there are worse beers out there (I'm looking at you Inbev-AB), but that's hardly an excuse for this crap. Given a choice, I'd probably save myself the calories and drink the equally swill like premium light. This is pretty bad..."
"D/O- My first experience with this beer was last night after hearing from a couple friends from MN how great of a drinkable beer it was. I'd have to agree. Drinkability is top notch. Perhaps the best adjunct lager I've ever had."
"D: Very drinkable, so easy to drink and it actually has some flavors. The rare times that i do want an adjunct, this is usually the one i go to."
"This beer is very drinkable. I barely wanted the first one, now I am looking at my second. All adjunct lagers should be this good."
"D - If I hadn't been so full of beer, various snacks and meals, and who knows what else, this would have been a little easier to drink. However, it was much better than the equivalently priced Miller Lite."
"D- I remember now why I choose to drink this over other adjunct lagers. Pretty good flavor for the style. Reminds me a little of a lighter malt liquor. I can see why my grandpa used to drink this but not warm though."
"I could drink this beer everyday all summer long. Everytime we go up to the cabin this is the beer we grab out of the fridge and have on the boat. It beats all of the Macro-brews lagers anyday and is brewed right here in Minnesota! I had this most recently on tap in my kegerator with a 15.5 gallon keg that I bought from Zipps in Minneapolis."
"My pour produced two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head with decent retention which also produced a good bit of lacing as it fell. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Liquid sunshine in a glass! Nose was the standard for the style - a slight lager sweetness upstaged by odd scents, in this case including a grapiness. Mouthfeel was medium and it was not as bad in the mouth as I was girding myself for. It was a typical AAL with the usual lager sweetness accompanied by cereal flavors. Finish was likewise passable, but somehow my fascination may have also passed."
"D) a decent lager. Good start to a beer session."
"D- Goes down pretty well, nothing to complain about just a simple beer."
"The mouthfeel was about medium for a lager. A good sumer session beer. And even better since this is sold at a price comparable to BMC but tastes better than the big boys."
"D: A decent adjunt lager with sustainable drinkability"
"Enjoy!"
"Brought back from Minnesota and shared with me by a former Minnesota resident who raved about it nonstop. Pours from the can a light to medium gold color, seriously carbonated and topped with a decent amount of white foam. Smells a bit grainy, and a little bit sweet. Nothing unexpected on the palate, a somewhat sweet, grainy and well carbonated beer. Crisp, refreshing and very good, for what it is."
"Great thing about this beer is that it's frequently discounted in minnesota (12pk usually), making it not only a very respectable American Adjunct, but a wallet-friendly one too."
"***Update 4/15: I went out and purchased a 12 pack and there's no ""cat poop"" smell in these bottles. I may have gotten an old one before. At $8.99/12pk here in the midwest, it's not too bad. I like its smoothness. I possibly may get tired of it after 5-6 bottles over the course of a week or so. Still not as good as Rolling Rock (my current fav) but not a bad beer nonetheless.***"
"Pours a clear, yellow color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of adjunct, yeast, and pale malt. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, adjunct, and a hint of hops. Overall, a slightly better than average adjunct lager."
"Properly carbonated, light bodied, slightly sweet aftertaste. Refreshing to drink. If only all American Adjunct lagers were this good..."
"Drinkability - Ha ha. Yeah, this beer is drinkable. A case goes by ridiculously fast. Easy and smooth."
"When I was growing up my dad collected old beer bottles, cans and glasses. So being from Minnesota he had a lot of Grain Belt stuff. So when i was old enough to buy my own beer, the image of the red diamond on top of a silver cap was engraved in my mind. My first taste was light on hops and had a nice refreshing almost sweet taste with a kind of banana taste. I was hooked and it is my number one beer for daily drinking."
"D: If you live in the twin cities and want a excellently drinkable barbecue or party beer that you can down gallons of this is the one."
"I gave this one a low rating because it isnt that good of a beer, however I am absolutely in love with it and cant live without it"
"A great beer to enjoy on a cheap tap or while listening to a twins game in the backyard with a burger. Something everyone in the state of Minnesota can agree upon."
"Overall for what this beer is, it is excellent. The sweetness is just slightly off-putting, but all in all this is a very easy drinking lawnmower beer I can live with. I can honestly say that I will buy this beer again and possibly stock it for my family that drinks what they call ""Light Beer"". It may not be my personal flavor of choice, but the obvious hop presence and malt flavor makes this beer a winning choice for my go to American Lager without a doubt. And coming from an IPA fan, this beer should be about as out of my range as they can get, but it wasn't."
"Overall I actually really liked this, for the style I thought it held up quite well and I would not mind having it again."
"In my opinion this is one of the better examples of the style."
"Pours a golden yellow color with smaller head. Smells of sweet grain. Sweeter than normal for this style. Taste is the same as the nose. Not getting anything but the sweet grain/malt. Not complex, but still pretty satisfying. Top end of light bodied, but not quite medium. Smooth. Very drinkable. It's easy to session and easy to find. I could do a day of these."
"D- This is a great beer for summers and nights out. If you have to go with an adjunct, go with Grain Belt."
"Nice smooth golden color with a scent of corn malt. The taste is very good for an adjunct lager, almost like a malty popsickle, strange way to define it I know, but very true. Smooth mouthfeel with a pronounced corn malt flavor and very little hop profile. This beer is way too drinkable. This may be the best example of a lawnmower beer out there."
"Pale gold with very little lacing on the surface and a light rim of foam around the edges. Pretty still with just some light prickle popping up through the center of the glass. Mild nose of malt and some touches of grain. The attack is pretty simple and doesn't really surprise you. The finish is pretty smooth and much maltier than I expected, I am pleasantly surprised. Low presence of grains and hops. Pretty smooth and clean and if I am ever stuck choosing between it and other mass produced beers, I will go this way."
"D- Good stuff here, I like this beer as a summer BBQ-type brew."
"D-VERY DRINKABLE. I may have a slight bias, as this was the beer we drank in college to drink ""the good stuff."" I once bought three casees of it and smuggled it into my dorm in a suitcase. Oh, the days. As a result of my history with this beer, it will forever be one of the most drinkable session brews around, regardless of its less-than-great taste."
"D: Meh."
"M/D: the feel is hard and rough but without a full body character. The drinkability is tough as well with the weird taste and the rough feel."
"Best by date of 8/05/09; logo-embossed clear glass bottle."
"This is considered a local favorite in the category, but I just don't like the corn."
"O) Nice, but fairly bland Macro/Adjunct"
"A Minnesota classic, my dad used to stock his fridge with this stuff (and Hamms and PBR). It has survived a few brewery closings but thankfully Schell's picked up the recipe and launched a great marketing campaign to re-introduce this beer to another generation. Not going to win any beer awards, but as other reviewers have noted, it's a great beer with food - most excellent to wash down brats and burgers in the summertime."
"Grain Belt is one of the true best in this style. It has a delicious and classic taste that time cannot affect. It pours nice, and although it doesn't have a great appearance or smell it goes down incredibly easy, especially when ice-cold. A true man's beer, Grain Belt is an excellent choice, especially with food."
"Pours a golden body with a stream of bubbles supporting a two finger white head. Smells fairly corny with graint, malt and the slightest amount of hops. Tastes very good for the style, maybe the best I've had. Strong grain with hints of corn and hop make a very mellow but flavorful adjunct. Mouthfeel is great, smooth and well carbonated. Very drinkable, as are most of the style (unless the taste is just awful)"
"I am reviewing this beer based on it's style, not on how it compares to DIPAs or Barleywines. Pours a crystal clear golden color. Two finger bone white head that left some pretty decent looking lace rings down the glass. Aroma is cereal grain and corn, sweet and very little earthy hops. Taste is sweet for the style but it's good. It's very grainy and cereal like. Think of pale malt mixed with corn flakes. Very tasty for the style. Hey at least there's no rice in there, right? I could drink this stuff all day long in the summertime. It's easily my favorite Adjunct Lager."
"D: Good to have with food or if I'm gonna be having several."
"Drinkability: An easy drinking macro lager style beer. Would probably be better in summer, but its ok as a substitute for BMC for high quantity drinking. Although, at $10.99 for a 12 of bottles it is not very cost effective. I'm not dissapointed I tried it, but unless I find this for $8-9 a 12, I'll be skipping it over."
"One of my favorite macros. Brewed in New Ulm so it doesn't travel far before it hits my lips. The large Premium sign in St. Paul is a landmark I smile at whenever I see it."
"On-tap at the Blue Nile. Appears a clear, brilliant gold with no head. I think this beer is really an example of how to make the most out of adjunct beer. Yes, it tastes like corn. In fact, it tastes a lot like corn. But unlike Miller Light (another corn-y beer in my mind), Grain Belt is smooth with subtle bready malts. I mean, unless you don't like corn-flavored beer (and that's understandable), this is a great lawnmower beer. Macro beer at its best."
"D= it's the perfect beer for a day at the ball park or an outdoor bbq with friends. Drink it like you would drink a bud or miller only enjoy it a million times more."
"I would drink this often. One of the beers I keep on hand. Found that women who like a casual beer like this."
"Grain Belt Premium on tap: what you'll get is a fairly bubbly, yellow glass of beer, with a pretty muted smell, and a nice effervescent mouthfeel, and a good grainy flavor. This is a humble beer that more than holds its own against phony craft beers like Leinenkugel, and blows macros out of the water. Perfect compliment to hot dogs on the grill on a hot summer day."
"Overall, it was a below average beer in par with the BMC's. Not one that I'd buy but glad I got to try since it's a Minnesota legend."
"Not bad. Not tremendously different from other American lagers I'm familiar with, but this beer offers an exceptionally clean (probably means tasteless) taste, and a clean (but not really watery) mouthfeel. It comes in a clear bottle, but is definitely not skunky. Appearance is yellow, brilliant, and fizzy, with a think and soapy head. Not bad."
"Overall this beer doesn't have much going on, but it is a local favorite. It doesn't cost that much which is nice and you can drink a few without filling up."
"Taste is smooth, sweet and a hint of hops. As with other macros grain is also predominant. Overall, this beer is pretty good with middle of the road taste."
"The more I drink this the more it reminds me of a low alcohol malt liquor. Avoid this beer."
"Overall an easy drinking session beer."
"Picked up a 12 pack for cheapo beer over the 4th. Unfortunately the taste reminded me too much of malt liquor. I'll still finish the 12, but I probably won't come back to it again."
"D: The perfect beer for a warm summer day with family. Hands down, Grain Belt is the best Adjunct Lager I've had thus far. I think I'll be stocking up on this the next time I head back east."
"The body is closer to light than moderate. Next to no carbonation and a offsetting finish leaves a filmy finish. Overall not recommended. Not recommended at all."
"D- The big key, as with most macros, at least for me, is bottle vs. in the glass. For me, this beer is quite a bit better from the bottle, but even in the glass, it beats out many other macros. Because of it's thirst quenching abilities, and low ABV, it has nice drinkability."
"This poured from the tap as a pale yellow gold lager with sparse white head and so-so lacing. I get a fairly classic weak wheat aroma but it's OK, a bit of lemony citrus overtone. More malt presence in the flavor, still very thin with a fair carbonation present. A bit of tang on the tongue. Pretty watery but really not bad tasting, OK for a refreshing guzzler. Nothing to go out of your way for. This will do nicely to wash down most anything. A good picnic beer I guess."
"This is my favorite summertime chugger up at the cabin."
"The taste is similar, with a definite, crisp apple/apple-peel quality along with aromatic grain, honey and flowers in the finish. It's smooth, very crisp yet flavourful, and has clean taste and feel."
"Surprisingly tasty flavors of apple and bready malt, with a little honey on the back end. A dry and clean aftertaste is what sets it apart from other lawnmower beers. Carbonation is steady and even, and gives it a light feeling. The clean finish makes it palatable and easy to session, no doubt."
"This is a surprising beer. If you pop a cap expecting a BMC, you'll be shocked. Real flavor exists here. Try it, and see what American lagers can be."
"Mouthfeel is good almost perfect for this style, high, but not to high levels of carbonation and thin but what did you expect with this beer. Easy drinking, good tasting macro lager? I'll have a few."
"This beer pours a clear light golden color. The head is small, and recedes quickly into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is of caramel malt, with a nice spicy hop edge. The taste is of light biscuity malt with a faint hop spiciness. The mouthfeel is light bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, if I had to drink an adjunct lager this would be it. It has more malt and hop flavor than any other macro lager I have had, and the carbonation isn't annoyingly high."
"The beer flattens quickly, with too modest carbonation letting this beer down. I'm far from impressed with this, and will studiously avoid it in the future. Not worth trying, in my estimation."
"D- This is the first beer I ever tried that I liked (a few years ago, prior to advancing to the fancier stuff), so it's nostalgic for me. Aside from that, this beer is quite tasty and easy to drink, so I would say that it's extremely ""drinkable"" !!"
"I have been a consumer of the ""Premium"" since the 70's when my attempt to keep the old Northeast Minneapolis Grain Belt Brewery in business failed. I am an avid collector of Grain Belt memorabia. Even though my tastes have branched out into the ale world, I still keep a case of Premium on hand. I believe that the currrent Premium is very close to the original recipe. It will always be my favorite lager. Kudos to Schell's for keeping the Premium alive for future generations to enjoy."
"A Minneapolis classic, but I still long for the tougher and better tasting Grain Belt Golden. August Schell has done a good job bringing the brand back to relevance. The Premium brand has a semi-sweet macro taste and pale yellow appearance. It is a good example of an everyday, Midwestern beer. This beer tastes very good alongside a roast beef sandwich at Mayslack's in Nordeast."
"Thinner medium body, good carbonation. A bit drying in the aftertaste. This is surprisingly decent. If this was available in my area I may even keep a sixer of it in the fridge for my macro buddies (and me occasionally). Thanks, Ed."
"very drinkable, can sit around and drink a 12 pack if you really want to... pretty cheap and enjoyable. also, being that i'm in mankato, this is brewed about a half hour down the road."
"Light and crisp, very refreshing, moderately carbonated. This is a good beer, great for social occasions."
"I prefer this macro over almost any other."
"No one's trying to impress anyone here. It's the beer grandma used to drink, and they're just keeping a good thing going."
"My main complaint is that it is a tad expensive for its market segment. If there are added costs due to superior ingredients and brewing processes than I will give a pass. Another is the clear bottle, put it in a proper brown bottle for longer shelf life."
"Overall this regional 'classic' isnt too bad but nothing that ill order again"
"Last swigs: Reviewed as an agreement with fellow BA DarkerTheBetter. He sad to me ""you can have this if you agree to review it."" So it goes. If this were sold around here, ya might find a six pack in my fridge."
"Cheers!"
"The aroma has a malty sweetness with a hint of corn and very faint hop aroma. The appearance is exception for a beer of this style with a nice golden color and a nice white head that shrinks to a thin lacy top that leaves some lace on the glass. The smell is not intense but that seems true of most American Lagers. It is a pleasant aroma but not very strong. Taste is crisp and somewhat malty in the begining and the finish has an unusal sweetness to it that I find intriguing and refreshing. Mouthfeel is as it should be for this style and it is one of the most drinkable beers around. I keep a half barrel on tap in my basement bar and when people come over all they can talk about is how surprisingly good this beer is. It is the perfect beer with BBQ and pizza and lots of other good food. A great all around beer in this style category."
"Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable macro lager. I was very suprised by this beer, considering the classic generic beer packaging. I only wish I could get these in NY. Thanks to mac56 for the sample."
"for those who like to order a beer with their spicy bloody mary, i've found that this is a perfect compliment."
"Not the highest marks, but still impressive."
"D - It doesn't look very good but the taste is just good. Also, the classic look is great."
"I'm typically a Brown Ale or Pale Ale drinker, but for summertime refreshment you can't beat this offering from August Shell Brewing, I would recommend this to any beer lover out fishing or after playing a summertime sport. It does have a sweeter tatse than most beers, but also it does posess a clean finish."
"D - A Minnesota staple that I'll never stop drinking."
"I had this one night on my recent trip to the twin cities. Light yellow in color with a white head. As for taste and smell, there is not much you can say about this beer that you couldnt say about PBR or Hamm's. However, I would say that Grain Belt wins by a nose. There was a little bit of canned corn in the smell, and a slightly metalic taste. The mouthfeel was wet and bubbly. I think that freshness played a factor in it's moderate drinkability. I woudln't really got for this stuff after it had been shipped 2 or 3 states away. This beer served it's purpose, and I can't really complain about that."
"Originally reviewed September 17, 2005. On tap at the Big Lake Brewfest. Aroma is a light dusting of grain bin over stale malt. Pour of clear yellow. Flavor starts with a surprsing run of decent malt flavor, but then quickly fades into something a little skunky. Finishes extremely clean."
"Ok so this is one of those beers you can drink all night and not be full. Appearance is decent for the style 1.5 finger head and some decent lacing. Taste and smell are very similar, malt and some dark fruit, possibley plum. Mouthfeel is above average, some nice carbonation that doesn't inhibit your drinking ability."
"Served in a 12oz bottle at the Doolittle American Grill ($3.50) Alexandria, Mn. Pours with two finger white head that goes slowly leaving a good lace. Clear pale amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Wet stainless steel nose. Starts with a hoppy citrusy flavor but weak, finish is clean since there is not much here. Good lawn mower beer."
" Call it an icon, call it tradition. It's a Minnesota staple. Who am I to argue?"
"Easy to drink one, if you drink fast, otherwise, be warned! run o the mill macroswill from a regional brewer"
"Very easy on the palate and a good beer to seek out at the end of the night..if you've already shocked your tastebuds with good beer."
"Premium is not going to impress anyone. It is your average american domestic pilsner, that actually is a bit sweeter, especailly out of a keg. BUT, I love this beer. It is local, it tastes better than the average domestic, and for some reason I seem to be able to drink this all night long and not make a fool of myself (much easier said than done). If there is not something decent on tap at a bar, this is the first thing I order. I have much more than respect for this beer, simply because it has treated me so well for so long."
"Dnot bad. I would drink this over a macro, maybe in the summer because it is so light and maybe because it is local. Easily drinkable."
"Pours yellow with a small white head. Smell is some sweet malts, maybe some corn, and surprisingly some Earthy floral hops as well. Taste mimics the smell pretty well. There is a nice refreshing bitterness. The mouthfeel is watery, as expected, but it has a small amount of body. Nothing here inhibits drinkability in any way. I would take this over the big three any day."
"This beer came a darker clear yellow with a thin film of head. Smells of lemons, roses (seriously) and corn. tastes of sticky candy-like wheat malt with a good pairing of citrus. There was also an odd hamburger-like flavor that came through that wasnt entirely un-pleasant. Mouth feel is very thick with a light carbonation. This is an extremely drinkable beer that gives little resistance to the palate with a pretty good flavor and a nice body."
"Macro color, macro taste..but I'll try to keep an open mind on the much talked-about ""Grain-Belt"". Let's go with the facts..it is a straw-yellow color...no head, no lace. The aroma is nothing but rice..grainy, grassy herbal smell with a hint of corn thrown in there. The taste comes down to a combination of very mild grainy malts and possibly good dishwater. Thin mouthfeel. Slides down as easy as corn-flavored water...remarkably, that's what I found out this is. Thank god this was the ""Premium"" grain belt..I'd hate to taste what the sub-par grain belt tastes like."
"This is not a bad macro; poured out to a solid golden color with a nice foamy white head. Looks like the beer you see Holmer drinking on the Simpson's. Aroma of malt and sweetness, with some cooked grain. Not bad. Flavor was rather good, I must say; bread, corn, malt and a touch of sweetness toward the finish was very nice. Mouthfeel was OK, but nothing amazing. A decent level of drinkability, this is an oldie, but a goodie. Wish we had it here in the Motor City. Beats the hell outta any other macro around here."
"this beer is a little hard to find in bars but fairly easy to get at booze stores all over the city it looks like beer always a plus in my book it smells like any other mass produced beer but with a small difference not sure what it is but i like it taste like beer once again a plus still it is sweeter then most other beers and it is verry drinkable i could drink it all day long"
"I have gotten this numerous times on tap usually to go with a sweeter desert since this is a rather sweet beer. It pours a pale yellow with lots of tiny bubbles racing to the top. It lacks carbonation but its lack adds to the sweetness and smoothness of this beer. Primarily it smells malty to be specific malt sweetness. It tastes of malt sweetness aswell with very little hop character to be noticed. However despite this beers failure to be unique and different it does go down as an enjoyable beer that is quite drinkable with a sweeter plate of food or desert."
"Grain Belt has two strikes against it right off the bat: the name and the clear glass bottle. Ultimately, though, they matter not. I do like the label and the cap; they ooze old school cool. This is one of the better (microbrewed) macro lagers in existence. Like anything else, it has its time and its place. I could see myself buying at least a few sixers every summer if it ever makes its way this far south."
"Hats off to Schell for making this wonderfully drinkable affordably priced brew."
"Hands down, way better then the tapped version I had earlier, but still not what the old belt was. Quite sad indeed."
"Wow! I've heard so much about this from old timers. Here's my chance. Pours a one-finger white (mildly yellow) head of large bubbles over a crystal clear faint golden liquid. Smells of noble hops and faintly of malt sweet. My guess would be Hallertauer hops or maybe Saaz. Not tinny enough to be Saaz, IMO. Tastes clean and malty. Some hop floral is present, but almost no hop bitter. Yeah, thin malt with mild hop floral, and that's about it. Perhaps a hint of munich malt in the form of the chalky dry I associate with munich. Pretty easy drinking. I can see why this was such a hit many years ago before craft beers came out. Doesn't hold a candle to craft beer, but it's a touch better than macro-swill. Light body (not super light, just light) and moderate, but sharp carbonation."
"Pours a clear and crisp golden color. Quick fading foamy white head. Smells of corn and grains, very sweet. Taste is sweet, pretty much all sweet grains, no noticable hops. This is a smooth drinking macro, not bad at all. The sweetness can get to you. And unfortunately a night of grain belts leaves me feeling like crap the next morning."
"Props to the Big Man for setting me up with a bunch of his leftovers from his ""Macro Madness."" ZAP, you do indeed rule. Except on the hardcourt."
"One of my all-time favorite beers. Granted, a lot of my love for this beer comes from the fact that it is what my Dad drank when I was younger and I distinctly remember fetching these beers for him and sometimes getting a sip. In addition, this was my staple session/party beer in college. I was and still am proud to drink this and I am very happy that Schell's revived it (smart profit move on their part too!). Anyway, pours a very clear, light yellow straw with a cottony fluff of cloud-white head that sticks around and even laces the glass. Aroma is mild, but nice; lightly sweet, crisp, honeyish malts, and some lemony hop notes. Smells refreshing! Crisp, light malty sweetness up front with whiffs of corn--good corn (fine, I'm obviously biased about this beer, but I don't care). Light hop bitterness has a hint of citrus in it and takes it into the finish. Light bodied and refreshing. A great summer party beer. Takes me back to my college days everytime! Thank you Grainbelt!"
"This one's for you, Dad. If it's true that ""in Heaven there is no beer", no offense, but I hope you're in a better place than that...."
"Taste is light and sweet, not corn but elements of apple and pear. No off-flavors but quite sweet with a faint maltiness. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy, not much substance. Much sweeter than I like my lagers but not bad overall. Thanks to TastyTaste for this sample."
"Thanks to Tastytaste for the sample."
"The mouthfeel was a little thin, but I liked how there was a little creaminess. Drinkability is decent and I had several at one sitting. It was very easy to pair with the walleye I had for dinner. This is another solid regional lager from the Midwest and I would compare it favorably to Point, Lenies, etc"
"I like it for what it is. Especially good for cold summer thirst quencher."
"Grain Belt Premium has a lot of history in the twin cities, too bad it is not made here anymore. Schell's took over but they still do a good job. The old Premium had one of the most distinctive tastes ever, very very sweet. It was great out of a bottle but when out of a can it tasted like the can. I've only had the new premium out of a bottle and it is much more watered down. Even with the new watered down taste, this beer is not a mass consumption beer even though countless of us students at the U of M think it will be. Take my advice don't get plowed off it or you will spend the night in the bathroom."
"This brew is a pale gold color, small white head on top. The scent is sweet malt. The taste of this brew is on the malty side, sweet taste, corny. Not a great brew by any means, but if youre going for a macro style beer with some decent flavor, this could be a good one to try. Comprable to high life."
"Clear light gold color, small head, terrible old corn aroma, very light corn taste, just a touch of malt sweetness. I guess you can tell its not a light, but I would take any Miller product over this. The third worst beer I've ever tasted. From the past reviews I'll assume its better when its fresher."
"Well, this is a beer that certainly has some history in the twin cities. I'm glad that Schell's was able to purchase the brand, keeping it in the state. I also beleive they have improved the quality of Premium. It seems much more consistent, and while it remains an adjunct beer I beleive the former brewer was using even more than the classic recipie called for. Schell's commitment to excellence certainly shows. All in all, this isn't a beer that would win a lot of fans on this site, but it stands up favorably to similar american pale lagers. If you beleive in supporting a local brewery this is a fine choice. It is what it is."
"Clear yellow hue, sad in color really, there was no animation, the head was white, the height never reached a fourth of a finger before it faded to a soapy collar before disappearing entirely. No subsequent lace either. The nose had minimal potency, slightly sweet, not so much from malt but from adjuncts. It is not really worth smelling. I was surprised at how bad the palate was, awfully sweet, like cream corn, slightly grainy, like cereal and as a whole it is borderline unpleasant. Id say the sweetness is almost cloying. This has the taste of a cheap American industrial lager and it makes no point to pretend otherwise. There is no malt influence, no hops bitterness or flavor either. In fact some hops would have been a welcomed addition to cut the sweetness. But that is not what this beer is about. There are minimal flavors that are favorable. Medium-light body, firm carbonation, overall it has a good mouthfeel, but I had a difficult time getting past the taste. One (clear) bottle was enough for me, Im glad I tried it, Im glad I reviewed it, Im glad I didnt buy a six-pack to do so. Otherwise there would have been five beers poured down the drain. Not recommended, as this is a poor example of the style."
"I actually liked this much better when I had it out of a can (or maybe that was the ""old"" grainbelt?) It also seemed to work better in the summertime. In any case it's OK for the price."
"The Minnesota Brewing Company version was a beer that i drank gallons of, so when that stock ran out, I got this. (You can tell the difference by the bottle caps, the MBC had an ""M" surounded by stylized hops and grain, the new one is the classic Grain Belt Logo). The beer has definitely changed since I last had it. It is more balanced, and less sweet than it's predecessor. It still has it's crystal clear gold color, and small white head. My favorite beer of the low cost, American lager sub-category."
"Crystal clear like apple juice is the color of this brew. A thick white head did meet the top of my glad but it rapidly faded away to nothing. A sweet aroma to this brew. Malt comes to mind, maybe corn and wheat? The taste is a dead match. Nothing to overpowering but nothing to rave about. It is a decent brew that works well with food. Good to clean the palate but leave the taste buds for the desert beer."
"Comes in a clear bottle that showcases its extremely pale staw color. In fact, I can see right through the darn thing! More like an Italian chardonnay in color than a beer. Sports a modest white head throughout-to its one credit I guess?! Aromas hint straight off of adjunct-lots of corn here folks! The beer actually tastes like a can of ""light"" cream corn-if there is such a thing. The mouth feel is redolent of water, and as the beer warms in the glass it loses its carbonation with the quickness of a cat, and actually, almost passes for water! Grain belt finishes with a lingering ""frito corn chip"" flavor! If you like em corny and flat this one is for you brave drinker!!"
"Draft, Minneapolis. Had this after washing the taste of a Labatt's Blue out of my mouth, but it was only a slight improvement. Since this really is my father's beer (that and Hamm's), and because it has such a generic name, it's a little hard to approach without preconceptions. What I find is the usual pale American Standard color, not much head. I did get a hint of lager yeast taste, but not too much else. When we had to leave, I didn't really want to stay and finish this. Schell's keeps this going because of nostalgia and name recognition as this area's standard cheap beer, but they'd really do well to push more of their own brand."
"Clear pale straw, decent head of short duration, but a left over ring laces the glass. Slighly metallic but sweet aroma, light corn syrup malt indications. The taste is similar, fairly corn husk in nature. Decent body, sturdier than Pig's Eye, but with flavor demonstrating less fruit. Slighly less carbonated late in the profile than the Minnesota Brewing version to my tongue. Hops are a little disappointing and sort of Miller High Life typical. A decent macro for those who like to support local economies but won't stray from American Lager. Thanks to Schell for preserving the brand, it meets a need..."
"Schells may have made this a better beer...just don't drink it out of the can..."
