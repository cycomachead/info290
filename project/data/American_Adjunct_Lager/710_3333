Color was a golden-yellow that would have made either/both King Midas and Croesus proud. The nose would make any local pig farmer proud, given its distinct resemblance to silage. The mouthfeel would make any chemist proud, given its resemblance to CO2. The taste would make Greg Koch proud, since he revels in being able to measure his beers by using AALs as his yardstick. The finish would make a drain proud as it either came from one or belonged there. No, sorry, that last was too harsh, but I was at a loss. It was simply a standard AAL.

This "original" pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of very quickly-dying white foam. The nose comprises corn, corn syrup, brown rice, and what the group collectively agreed was a mixture of taco seasoning and Jacob Leinenkugel's sweat and tears (no word on what happened to the blood, though...Count Yorga (or Iorga, to some) is a suspect). The other cans didn't really smell this way, nor did this odor come out of the can itself; we believe the snifter (clean, by the way) brought out some hidden smells. Something like that. Regardless, it smelled pretty damn awful. The taste mirrored the smell, minus that noxious second half of pain, though some tin and hard water seeped their way into the rice and corn syrup. The body is very light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, not the best of choices for fermented enjoyment, but the price and source are right for downing some brews on a boat while attempting to catch some fish.","TMoney2591","Sep 03, 2010"
3.01,2.7,3,2,3,3.5,4,"This was the main beer consumed on guys weekend. Appropriately it was in the Northwoods of Wisconsin, just like this brew was intended to be enjoyed. The appearance as expected is a pale straw color with light head on it. The smell makes me think I shouldn't have poured it into a glass. It smells of corn syrup and stale hops (or some other foul off smell). It's rather sharp on the nose. The taste has a slight bitterness to it which seems ok for a pale lager that it is other than that it tastes similar to the smell, just a little less foul. Bitterness seems to come from the corn syrup but there is some malt and maybe honey in it. That makes it surprisingly a lot smoother than I expected. I will consume a lot of this so I hope it's as drinkable as I think it is.","Vdubb86","Jul 07, 2010"

Pale, weak and straw-colored in appearance, with a rapidly disappearing head, and a smell that is nearly non-existent. Yet, there is some flavor there, and it is undeniably refreshing. It's not at all brackish like its big brothers from Milwaukee & St. Louis, and even has a pleasantly little tart taste and not at all disagreeable finish.

Pours absolutely crystal clear and golden in color. A considerable white head forms but fades in about one minute to a few lacy remnants. Smell and taste both had noticable sweetness. Regardless, I felt this beer left something to be desired. A rose by any other name may smell as sweet, but a lager that tastes like a concealed porter and goes down like water ultimately fails at mimicing any of the three.

3.37,15,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Clear gold color, moderate white head. Smells of grassy malt, a little stronger than your average macro offering. Taste is very full of malt and a hint of corn, but, unlike the macros, has a definite hops presence. Pretty good for an average priced lager.","TastyTaste","Mar 09, 2004"
3.03,3.4,3,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Leinenkugel's Original. A basic macro brew. Good color for a pale lager, golden and not too watery looking. Small white head tha dissapates quickly, fairly high carbonation. Taste is fuller than any of the big three's main beers. A hint of corn but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is fizzy but refreshing. This is a drinkable beer. I'd take it over the big three (but it is a Miller owned product). Personally I'll usually drink grain belt if I want this style (Schell vs. Miller, MN vs WI, easy choice for me)","JeffreyG","Oct 01, 2003"
3.59,22.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,4.5,"A decent session beer and maybe the best leinenkugel product.","jwilli7122","Aug 29, 2003"
3.35,14.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Overall this is no world beater, but it isn't horrible either...middle of the road American lager I'd drink over Bud, Busch, Old Mil (despite the fact they some how keep winning awards)...Perhaps the best of the Leinie bunch...","ZAP","Aug 20, 2003"
2.3,-21.5,2,2,2.5,2,2.5,"Definitely a beer that I was not impressed with as it lacks character and there was not much going on with it.It poured a medium white creamy head with fine sized bubbles that mostly dissipated.The body was cloudy with a lot of lively carbonation.The hue was gold and there was very little lacing.The nose was hoppy and slightly sweet with a slightly bitter flavor.The mouthfeel was tingly and light bodied.","hotstuff","Jul 06, 2003"

2.7,-7.8,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Once again, a beer happy in its mediocrity. Pale straw, adequate carbonation and head, flavor is slightly grainy but smooth and pasteurized. According to the brewery website, Cluster hops are used, but apparently in great moderation. Another lawn mower beer on an ever-growing list of unmemorable lagers.","Brent","May 25, 2003"
2.78,-5.1,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Average at best, but if its on the menu with only other macros, I guess I'll take it.","tavernjef","May 15, 2003"
3,2.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Better than most macros. Pours the same color as all the rest of them. Some head but dissapates quickly. Fairly malty with a little hops afterwards. Some velvet in the mouthfeel. Sometimes can have a little charcoally taste. This beer is cheap and passable. My wife will drink it. Not much more to say here.","daledeee","Apr 15, 2003"

3.1,5.8,3,3,3,3,3.5,"A good beer. Not great, but definitely worth drinking, especially as an affordable alternative to the big name American lagers.

2.85,-2.7,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Pours a clear light gold in color with no head. There is hardly even a collar of carbonation around the glass. Musty aroma with a thin hop nose. The smell reminds me of a lot of macros. Bland taste, slight sweetness, no real hop bitterness. This would be a good summer refresher as the beer is fairly crisp and clean. Nothing really offensive, just not a great beer for sure.","cretemixer","Dec 23, 2002"
3.35,14.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I think Miller has moved production from Chippewa Falls to Milwaukee, but the taste seems to be the same. This is superior to the Miller, Bud, Coors type of beers and holds up well to other good regional brews. No longer unique as it once was but still a good everyday beer!","Redrover","Nov 04, 2002"
3.27,11.6,2.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"pale straw color, thin foamy head that dies in seconds. refreshing pale malt aroma, no real adjunct smell...grassy hop aroma. tastes fairly grainy and crisp...some grassy hop taste and bitterness in the finish. a fairly light bodied, tasty and easy drinking american lager that has some euro-pils qualities to it. stands up to the big macro boys.","budgood1","Aug 07, 2002"
3.43,17.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Leinenkugels Original Lager is an all around good old fashion American lager that is not on steroids nor is it lacking in good taste. Wholesome body and flavor are readily found in every glass.","BeerBob","Beers"
3.3,12.6,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Golden color with moderate carbonation and head.  It had a hoppy aroma and a mild, but full, flavor.  A good lager, on par with Bud and definitely better than macro lights.","ryanocerus","0"
3.32,13.3,3,3.5,3,3,4,"Good premium American lager. No detectable adjunct character, decent bitterness to balance the malt, nice head retention for the style. Goes great with pizza delivery and videos. Reminds me of North American Lowenbrau. A solid dependable American beer.","EagleTalon","May 17, 2002"
2.03,-30.7,2.5,2,2,2,2,"Yellow-gold body. Large, smooth white head, recedes some, leaves some light lacing. Looks better than it drinks. No real strong aromas. Just a very basic American Lager beer smell, but not stale. Very little taste at all, but a soapy aftertaste.  Nothing to really recommend it, I would prefer Bud, Coors, or High Life, at least they are not pretending to be a craft/micro.  It is certainly not in Yuenglings class as a traditonal American lager.","RonfromJersey","May 16, 2002"
2.51,-14.3,3,2,2.5,2.5,3,"Not a bad looking beer, for a semi-macro lager.  Had it in a can, and it smells awful, it’s got a sharp metallic tang that runs straight up through the nostrils.  Decent first taste runs into an awful aftertaste.  I’ve had (and liked) Leinie products, and I know this is their bottom of the line, but I ain’t liking this.  I’ll get it in a bottle and update, but until then go with High Life or PBR.","jackndan","May 11, 2002"
3.18,8.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pale straw color with a mysteriously fast fading head.  Very little smell.  Quite sweet in flavor, I can't detect a macro corn flavor, though the malt may simply be barely "cooked".  Hops are minimal and mostly crisp at the back of the mouth.  Unlike many Leinenkugel products, Leinie's O doesn't promise a lot and let you down, its just an easy going American Lager.  It goes well with stadium food...","ADR","Beers"
3,2.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Light golden hue & very clear-- it's just a bit darker than a pilsner. Decent head retention allows for a sparse lace. Mild grainy & husky six - row aroma. A hint of cooked corn in the aroma (is this really all malt?) & just a touch of grassy Saaz nose. There's nothing outstanding in flavor in this brew, but there's nothing off - putting either. The mild hop bitterness & meager malt backbone are balanced. Hop flavor is insubstantial. Finishes dry, clean and with a slight sweetness on the tip of the tongue. This innocuous & fairly bland brew epitomizes the style. Ehh.","marc77","0"
