"Cheers."
""
"Rated from notes on previous tasting"
"OK beer, better that some domestics."
"Overall-  I haven't had Labatt Blue in 25 years and i remember it being more shall we say drinkable.  I don't know if my taste buds changed or if they tinkered with the recipe but this is terrible."
""
"I want to like this but it's just another adjunct beer heavily marketed around here. I guess moderate carbonation made the mouthfeel ok and it is not completely offensive when cold.  Corn aroma and taste become more pronounced as it warms. Perhaps it gets a gold star for nostalgia sake."

"Hey, listen. It's not on the top of the list of awesome craft beers but in a pinch ($1.15 for a 24oz) it works and isn't bad.  Plus, when your friends come over for football they will relish drinking an import instead of Miller or Bud"
""
"3/2 Bottle - Clear pour, not very thick or heavy. Minimal smell, not many flavours while tasting. Minimal carbonation."
"It's truly an awful beer."

"Overall : Bland beer with added sugar to compensate. Still feels relatively fresh."

"I don't understand some of the reviews. Top rated beers are nasty. And some of my favorite are ranked 6 or 7? I've tried the beers that are ranked high and have to ask… why? I've read the reviews and don't get it. I think, if it's not BAC over 5.9, it's considered piss water. But flavor that doesn't make me squeal and want my eyes to water, isn't a qualifying factor for a great beer for me."
"As far as adjunct lagers go, this is a better one.  Great appearance with color and head.  Nose is a weak spot though with some cereal grain and hint of canned veggies, but the flavor on the palate is a decent malty-grainy taste with balance of hops to make it have some overall flavor worth enjoying.  Too many adjunct lagers seem designed to have as little flavor as possible, but this one is more flavor forward and a decent flavor.  If I was a regular adjunct drinker, then this would be in my fridge fairly often."

"My only problem is that the bottles are only 11.5 oz and cans are 12oz. Hey do the math. Regardless, I'm a big fan of Blue, not so much Blue Light I love the taste and color. Its a beer that serves many purposes, great for getting a buzz, great for relaxing and great for watching sports. Can't really go wrong with Labatt Blue"
""
""
""
"Tastes like spoiled rice. Did not pair well with the barleywine I was drinking at the time. Awful beer. Don't know what it looks like because I drank it out of a can."
"Straw colored beer. Not much happening here in the way of flavor."
""
""
""
""
"I like it. Oh yeah"
""
""
"One of the worst AAL I've had the pleasure of tasting. Honestly cannot believe people regularly drink this crap."
""
""
"All in all this beer is a somewhat better adjunct lager than others I've had, namely Budweiser, Miller, or Coors, however as with any adjunct lager, I advise this be very cold when you drink it, or the funky sweet grain and corn notes will come alive in the smell and taste and it'll be much harder to drink, but this beer does have a nice crisp, smooth finish to it, other than that, it's got all the qualities of a typical adjunct lager."
"Easy drinking, better than domestic US beers"
""
""
""
""
"Light in body and mouth feel. Very drinkable and smooth."
"An OK beer on a hot summer day... but must be served very cold, goes bad fast once warm."

"Shared a pitcher with the bowling team. They always have a different $7 pitcher and this week was Labatt. Wow was it bad. Ugly traw colored body. Taste like stale Bud with some sugar water added. I don’t mind when the $7 pitcher special is Pabst, Coors, or Miller, but this stuff was terrible. We ended up not finishing the pitcher :("
""
"great beer!very floral and refreshing."
""
"Pours clear, light golden color with a very thin head that dissipates quickly.  Only a slight lacing. Heavy carbonation, mild flavor but not watery. Hints of citrus and nutty, bitter finish. Easy drinking. A very good everyday beer, even if unremarkable."

"I just like this.  It is mostly a historical liking on my part.  But it's a nice standard pilsner."

"When I lived in North Carolina for several years Blue was as expensive as any craft beer in the store.So- I chose other options. Take from that what you will."
""
""
""
"Bottle poured into a glass in a Calgary pub devoid of other options. There is a decent chance that this was the first beer I ever tried (when I was probably around 8 years old?). It tasted awful back then and is marginally better now. This was once a best-seller out here in the West along with Molson Canadian and the still ubiquitous Molson Pilsener but has since receded into the background as tastes have evolved and as other macro-breweries have gained ascendency since the 80s and 90s. A pale straw color and almost devoid of aroma beyond a vague sweet graininess. You might read things about the ""blue jacket"" on certain western Canadian barley varieties that imparts a distinctive dryness. Sure, whatever ... Although it is indeed the case that this brew is more crisp and dry than many of its adjunct lager competitors. Features a very subtle fruitiness that evokes apples and grapes, a generic white bread maltiness, almost no hop aroma or flavor, a massive dose of carbonation, and a faintly metallic semi-dry finish. I think this compares favorably to something like the massively sweet Sleeman's Original Draught, but you might be better served saving such comparisons for tickers like myself who keep finding themselves in places that remain craft-phobic. I do not get the same nostalgia here that Molson Pilsener evokes."

"Best thing about this beer is the free hat they offer as a promotion with the NHL or MLB"

"This beer was just okay for me. It was not my favorite beer. To me it did not taste good, it was ok but I have had better. The aroma was ok as well. I personally could just taste the alcohol more than the flavor in thos beer. I do not know maybe I got an old one but this was just me. But I am not going to try to put down any beer. Because everyone has their own taste and likes."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is the epitome of average in terms of beers, remarkably lacking a body or a real strong flavor and feeling like a domestic beer playing dressup in imported beer's clothes. The beer, as a whole, is surprisingly very flat and doesn't bear much taste, although I wouldn't say it isn't drinkable and likely easy to session. I will try to see if I can pick up other Labatt flavors throughout the rest of the year (Light, Royale Light, Lime, Max Ice, etc) , but these beers, after the disappointing flagship brand, will be one of the last I seek out, especially since finding single bottles of some of them proves to be a grating challenge and I doubt I'll be able to drink a six or twelve pack of these before they expire, if they're anything like regular Blue."

"Labatt Blue brewed Labatt Brewing Company Ltd. This brew has an Avb of 5% pours out a nice amber color with a thick white head. This brew looks like American style lager. Nothing good but nothing bad. The smell is good&has a rich smell of beer. At this point I'm liking this brew. Now for the taste. At first you get some richness but goes away fast. After that, it is just flat and than nothing. To me it tastes like flat bud light. It is smooth but ,the taste, there is nothing there. Mouth feel is ok it reminds me of a light beer. I can not tell the 5.0 abv. I feel if there was more of a taste this brew I would like it better. Overall, I'm giving this brew a 3 out of 5. Not the worst brew I had, but not the best."

"To me, it's the Budweiser of Canada, The Coca-Cola, and The McDonald's. Ya know the..meh.. the widely distributed, the average. No disrespect to any of those corporations. Ya pay a little more in the states with it being imported. The color and mouthfeel is light and uneventful but not offensive. Slight tracing in the glass, goes away quickly. Don't get me wrong, a drinkable beer, a buyable beer, drank it in Toronto and thought it was better there on tap. Leaves a heavy sharpy, alcohol residue on the tongue, so I wouldn't recommend combining it with other brews."

"Bottled clear and golden with a white head. It has a sweet smooth taste of hops and malt throughout. Could swear there is an after taste of wine grape skins. Overall this is a mass production beer that is a little different than other Canadian beers I've tried. There’s nothing to complain about and nothing remarkable either."

"The color is way too weak to have any real respect and the nose holds little to no personality. Despite the lack of nose I found the cereal grain and light Pilsner malts to be better than average. There is an easy drinkability but it's highly carbonated and very crisp. Overall it's not the world's best Pilsner but it will do in a pinch."

"DATE TASTED: November 23, 2013... GLASSWARE: Wychwood pint... OCCASION: PSU vs. Nebraska--a good reason for some EXTRA blue!... APPEARANCE: tawny clear straw golden body with swift bubbles that simmer to an uneven white,, filmy head--looks a bit weak... AROMA: thin, crisply corny malt pop with a slightly beefy afterscent; medicinal, almost band-aid-like vapor; then, nondescript... PALATE: THIN; Corona-esque mouthfeel; doesn't linger anywhere; gassy and bubbly...TASTE: THIN, woody, somewhat floral esters mesh with a 40-ounce malt to produce a drinkable, albeit pedestrian lager flavor...OVERALL: revisiting a beer I had over fifteen years ago, the experience is much shorter than the excitement I felt holding a 24-ounce tall back then; cookie-cutter and mouth-rinsing, with little to suggest a nuance..."
"O: Overall, yeah well you know already. Just another fizzy yellow drink that the masses drink. However, I am able to stomach this more than it's competitors. It's alright."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty mediocre, but better than some of the swill offered in bars. If I'm looking for something in this style though, I'm looking Canadian as it's better than this. Obviously anyone enjoying this, I recommend serving it cold and a frosted mug while not my thing, wouldn't hinder this beer in any manner."

"Overall: It's a typical AAL, which is to say, not very good. Within that classification, it's neither the best or the worst of the bunch."

"Overall: A poor beer and one that I would not drink again. A step below PBR and even other mass produced adjuncts."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and doesn't seem as watery compared to some of the other beers in the style. There's no ""off"" flavors."

"O: This is a nostalgic beer for me - lots of Labatt Blue was consumed when I was a college student in upstate NY during the early to mid 1990s. Not really any better than I remembered it being but not horrible."

"It would be easy to be a beer snob and belittle this. It is not what I would pick most of the time. But there really wasn't anything WRONG with it. It is a bit blah to my liking, but was fine with for the social gathering, and would likewise be fine to cool off after mowing the lawn on a warm day."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light gold with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and slight vegetal flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a slightly below average beer that is drinkable but the vegetal quality I am getting in the flavor isn't too enjoyable."
""
""
" The flavor has light malt up front slightly obscured by the highly carbonated quality with gentle hop balancing the light sweetness w/out any real depth or complexity in taste. Overall a pretty bland lager, just ok without any real noticeable flaws in the flavor department, not recommended based on enjoyment -it isn't bad per se, unless you expect the taste of malt or hops."
""

""
""
""

""
"Fun fact: if you purchase Labatt from one of Canada's liquor stores (which close by 5pm), the ""imported"" text will vanish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours to a 1/2 inch white head that falls quickly to a thin ring of foam around the glass and yellow gold color. Aroma is a weak grain and slightly buttery. Flavor is a bland mixture of corn and faint hops. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is appropriate for style. A very common North American lager that is rather unremarkable."

"Overall: This is a dry, bright macro brew. Less sweet than Coors and Molson. Less skunky than Stella. More personality than Budweiser and Miller. The first beer I ever drank was Labatt Blue in a red Solo cup. It was the beer we brought to the park before we were old enough to drink in bars and probably what I drank the night I kissed my first college girlfriend. My tastes have changed since then, but I still consider it a great beer for parties, camping trips, tailgating, and other situations where you just want to drink a bunch of watery beer with your friends."
""
"For all the mass-produced North America beers out there, this one tastes the best. Keep in mind, make sure you drink it cold, or it won't taste good (perhaps it's b/c there are no preservatives in this beer)? Anyway, this beer actually has a pleasant taste, no aftertaste, and is best among beers priced in the same catagory such as Bud, Miller Lite and Coors."
""
""
""
"you know, as the cheap after hockey beers go, i dont mind this. in the craft context, its obviously crap, but in the cheap beer world, its decently solid. the pour is of course an adjuncty piss color, with a marshmallowy white head. nose is watery malts, generic yeast, and a touch of aluminum. flavor is the same as the nose, slightly less off, bready malts, a lot more flavor than the blue light. aftertaste is a little metallic, but comparably less so. drinkability is high with a pretty light body and very active carbonation. it turns the stomach a bit, which has to knock it down a peg, but after a hockey game or on the golf course, there is a lot worse you can do for yourself than one of these."

"This is a drinkable beer. It isnt delicious, but it's alright. It's an adjunct lager, if I'm not mistaken, so no sense getting too much into the taste. It has a decent ""beer"" taste, but nothing to write home about. As ot warms, it leaves a slight filmy coating in the mouth. Drink it straight from the bottle, ice cold, with friends, and you'll have a good time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like it a lot better than any other cheap beer I've had. I give it the relatively negative reviews that I have because it's just a weak ""pilsener"" with no real substance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As a beer it is ok, but as a pilsener it's terrible. The appearance is ok and the smell too but the taste isn't good for a pilsener. The mouthfeel is average tough but the rest of the beer is certainly below average. In general, this beer is fine but it isn't a pilsener. I would definetly give it a 3 if it was a normal lager."

"Overall, I'd definitely choose this over some other cheap beers of its kind. I'd choose this over some other American beers of this variety. To be honest, probably my go-to AAL when it's available... inoffensive, and actually kind of enjoyable. Definitely my favorite ""cheap"" brew."

"Poured into becker pint glass. Light fizzy yellow, with minimal fizzy white head that fades fast into a thin ring of foam that leaves no lacing at all. Smell is weak, mostly grain malt, strong on corn. A little grassy hop smell is barely noticeable. I'm having trouble picking out any specific thing in the taste to describe. It's incredibly watery, with thin flavors of corn and not much else. Finish is metallic and dry. Overall it's drinkable, but almost literally tasteless. It's not...offensive, I'll give it that, but only because there are no flavors strong enough to be offensive. But I guess that's the goal of the AAL style; to be inoffensive to the largest amount of people. In that, this beer (if you can call it that) succeeds."

"Not terrible but not great either. Just a small step above your average adjunct lager."
""
"Tastes better than most of its adjunct competition and (in Canada) is usually a bit cheaper as well. If I'm looking for 24 beers for 29.99 to drink on a summer afternoon at the beach, rather than better stuff at 2 bucks or more a pop, I'll reach for Blue"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easily the best tasting beer in the "" standard "" section of most supermarket's. Labatt Blue has a somewhat distinct taste, And it is surprisingly VERY smooth for being a so called "" average beer "". I picked up a 6 pack for about $7, Which is a great price for what you get. MUCHHH better than Bud Light. This beer makes me wonder why people even still pay the same price for something as horrendous as that famous carbonated piss water. Definitely my beer of choice if I'm just looking to get a quick drunk for cheap"
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is stark. Flavor and aroma are almost non-existent, so all the bubbles just nip and nip, with nothing to release onto your tongue."
"overall - a tolerable and ok session drinker. I've had more refreshing adjuncts but this one still serves the purpose ok."

"3.0 D: It might just be nostalgia, but I swear this isn't as bad as some of the other AALs I've had lately. There's no sickly corny sweetness that is prevalent in others."

"Poured from a 11.5 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a straw yellow with a decent white head, but it does not stay very long at all. Doesn't really smell of anything, mainly of malt if anything. Tastes like a regular adjunct lager, just a little better than most. It is light bodied that is not overly carbonated and is definitely drinkable all night. Overall, a slightly below average beer, but definitely not offensive."

"They really shouldn't sell this beer. I don't know how they stay in business. It tastes like sweet skunk. It's so weak though, it could be a lot more objectionable. I've actually had a lot worse but this is definitely not worth drinking."

"Overall - This beer is very popular in my area, but this is actually my first time trying it.. It's not the greatest beer out there, but it's not terrible. I don't understand why so many people buy it though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It is very easy to drink. Its subtle flavor profile and light body and aromas make it very easy to down; like water. Likely would be good on a very hot day when served very cold, otherwise nothing to pine over and just pretty ordinary."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is almost alcoholic water. I swear, Miller Lite has more flavor than this."
""

"I haven't tried many Canadian beers but the ones I have tried including this one all tasted quite the same. They all had a sweet front fading into a bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel was decent and the color is nice. I guess I need to try more Canadian styles so I will have a better understanding."
""
""
"Much like Canadians there is nothing offensive about this beer, which is perhaps its biggest strong suite. It's nice that there wasn't any noticeable corn flavors in this brew and while far from impressive, the cereal grains translate into a simple and clean brew. I would take this over most of the Mexican and American adjunct lagers that I have sampled so far and would even consider purchasing it as a plain, simple, no frills cheap beer for the summer."
""
"O - The first time that I recall having this beer I liked it. That was in Canada and about 11 years ago. It's better than BMC."

"this stuff had some taste. You can drink a lot of this stuff. It's average, with nothing really going for it except its cheaper and you can drink it like water."

"Final Thoughts: Labatt Blue markets itself as the good stuff, however unless you are comparing it to a buck a beer, good stuff it is not. Unlike in the states where Bud and Coors seem to be the Macro standard, up here in Canada it's Molson Canadian and Labatt Blue. This is representative of what Canadian bulk brewing has to offer, so yeah..."

"Overall / drinkability: Meh is about the best I can say. When its very cold there is still something there, but as it warms up, it's all gone, and at that point you really have to chug the stuff fast to get much of anything out of it. Taste and appearance average for this style of beer and nothing special but not bad. Might be good during a hot day, but otherwise I'm not impressed. Oh well, not everything can be good."
""
""
"Labatt Blue is typical beer from North America. Pours golden clear with thin white head that eventually dissapates. The smell and taste include mostly grains and subtle hop to clear the pallet. Mouthfeel is light in body with good carbonation. Overall it is drinkable."
""
""
"O: There was a time when I looked forward to going to Syracuse to visit an old college roommate. He swore by this stuff then - mainly, I think, because it was cheap and perceived as fresh (having come not too far from Canada). But now when I go to Syracuse I visit Blue Tusk and drink good beer. For what this is, it's OK. I've had worse."
""
""
""
"In the great Canadian Macro Lager Battle, this loses out to Molson. Fizzy, weak, odorless and just kind of weak tasting, with a distinctly watery and undercarbonated quality. There's really very little to say about some beers, just that I found this had even less taste than Molson, and what was there was tinny."

"Overall, it goes down easy if your goal is to chug a few beers at a tailgate."

"Overall this beer is not very good. The whole grape thing was just odd and there are better alternatives out there for AAL's."

"A brew that will always have a place in my fridge."
"O: right on for the style, but just an average beer for me, probably better with food"
"Overall – My hockey team swears by pitchers this stuff after games.. I guess it serves a decent purpose in the refreshing/cheap beer department. Not something I would select."
"At $1.25 for a 24 oz can, the price is right. Not a bad choice out of it's category."
"O: Just a descent all around beer. Of the basic cheap beers, Labatt Blue is a favorite. Easy to drink and as refreshing as water."
"Overall, I recommend this for anyone looking to get drunk fast. Easy to drink, not bad tasting compared to other similar options, and if it's $.88 per 24oz tall boy, go for."
"M: The mouthfeel is dull but quite drinkable. When cold, I'm guessing that I could have gotten through the can in under five minutes."
"Overall, not a bad beer. Goes well while watching hockey."
"Labatt!! whatever that means in French, it must be close to the f-word."
"I brought this back from a recent trip to western NY, seems very popular in downtown Alfred. Pours a crystal clear deep golden yellow color with a thinnish white head that dissipates quickly. Looks like carbonated apple juice. Smells of grainy malt, hints of honey, slightly earthy hop aroma. Taste is grainy, grassy, slightly sweet with hints of honey. Medium to low body, medium level of carbonation, sweet watery mouthfeel. This is a bit better than a typical macro lager, clean, a bit sweet, nothing objectionable just nothing remarkable either."
"O - No real negatives other than the lack of substance."
"For the style it's not bad. None of those metallic or overly adjuncty flavors one would associate with this style."
"For beer like this, a 6th catagory should be added for sound, as the fizz is as audible as a can of Coke. We'll lump that into appearance. Smell is of corn. Taste was a surprising step up from the smell--nothing involving, but a pleasant pilsner sweetness. Taste does not reveal itself more with warming, rather it begins to break down. Despite the good deal I got, it was a mistake to buy this in 24 oz. cans. If you're going to drink this, keep to small serving sizes in order to keep it cold."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small sweet malt. In the taste, saaz/ pils like hops and a nice maltiness to back it up. A hop bite and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Ok, better than most, but still standard."
"Overall this is a slightly better then average adjunct lager that is good for an after bike ride session beer. Not going to win any awards but it does the trick."
"O - It's drinkable, but why would you want to? Maybe to cleanse the palate and make way for a good beer? I wouldn't buy it again, however it wasn't horrible."
"Final Grade: 2.94, a C."
"O- This was my college beer. After I graduated I still got 12 packs once in a while to drink along with my craft beers and still have a few of these left over from last year. I like it for what it is a cheap buzz that I liked better than most of the other AALs at the time, not sure if I would still feel that way, but I don't really drink them anymore. Probably my first time drinking this in a glass other than having it in pitchers at the bar. It is definitely quite sweet, but does have a little more bitterness than most AALs IMO. I don't really see my self buying this in the store again anytime soon, but will revisit it at the bars every once in a while."
"I kind of wanted a Canadian adjunct to be better but it's was average at best. Poured a bright clear yellowish gold. Almost no head to speak of. Smelled of rice and water. Chemical even. Taste was not so bad, refreshingly crisp. Did have a dry, rice like quality but drinkable. Overall, a drinkable adjunct but unimpressive on a good day."
"O - Fairly drinkable and quite inoffensive, but it is definitely not above mediocre."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Just had this on tap a few days ago, let's see how it compares. The pour yields the same pale gold with a thin white cap. The nose is just a mild - corn, grass, faint citrus. The mouth is crisp and refreshing still, albeit on the thin side. The flavors seem more pronounced from the bottle (though I think that has more to do with the ice-cold glass my draft was served in - how I hate that). Creamy corn, light malt, mild bitterness. Grainy finish. Not a bad brew. I'd reach for this before many other adjuncts."
"Tried for the first time while at Comerica Park in Detroit for a Tigers game. The beer appeared a light golden amber color with a nice white head that held up nicely that dissipated into a thin spotty cap. The aroma was kind of typical, light and grainy. The taste of the beer was better than expected (maybe it was just because I was at the ballpark), but I felt that it was strong than most in its class, but still grainy with no real hint of hops. It has a light feel, was clean, crisp, easy to drink and very refreshing and enjoyable. Overall, not a bad beer by any means."
"This has always been one of my personal favorites when I want to drink a quality beer at an affordable price. Whether it is in a bottle or can, Labatt Blue always seems to hit the spot. It has a sweet taste to it with quite a bit of flavor. It's a lot different than other Canadian Imports as a result of that sweet taste. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially someone that wants a quality beer without spending a lot of money."
"O/D-Have had much worse. Not a bad macro when compared to a few others. Probably would not by this as a cheap 'get drunk' beer because its a bit pricier than a High Life or a PBR. But, not too bad. Would drink one over most any Bud or Coors."
"O=Not impressed...will buy others from now on."
"Poured into a pint a light yellow with a lot of head that died down fast to leave almost nothing. Nose is nothing short of any other mass produced lager. A bitterness and pale malt if anything. The flavor is watery but with a brighter grain character than expected. A light bitterness that finishes. The finish has a light sour taste. I'll drink it if I'm handed one at a hockey game."
"Taste is corn and a light bitterness, but not of the hop variety. Very bland, light and tame. Skip it."
"Overall: Labatt Blue is about drinking, not thinking. It is meant to be consumed quickly, without tasting it. Hockey arena beer. Stadium beer. Hot summer day beer. Cheap beer. Drink it fast so I can get buzzed beer. It's scary to me that I still occasionally purchase and consume something so frighteningly meh ... but imprinting is powerful and the Buffalo beer gods must be appeased during Stanley Cup playoff runs. Twist cap at your own risk...."
"O - not a beer I'd drink on the regular but it is what it is and if I'm offered one I'll take it, thanks."
" This is my Grandad's favorite beer. He likes it in paper cups and that's how we drink it together. Somehow, drinking ice cold Labatt's out of 7oz. paper ""shooter"" cups while gazing out at a lake makes it taste pretty damn good. But for the more formal purposes of this review however, sorry Blue. (And I mean that)."
"All in all, a decent, if only a little underwhelming, beer."
"O: This beer is easy to drink, fairly crisp and refreshing, but nothing about it is noteworthy. Better than the alternatives. If you were to say, buy cases for a party, I’d recommend spending the extra dollar or two to upgrade from Bud or Miller to this."
"Labatt Blue is a pretty decent drinking beer. It's best when it's ice cold. It's much like other Pale Lagers, Yellow in color, dissipating head, and pretty smooth tasting. I'd go for a Labatt's before ever going after Miller or Bud. This beer gives us some good flavors and it could easily be much worse."
"Drink-ability: Easy to drink, this is definitely a lawnmower beer that you can knock back a few of."
"1/2 inch fizzy white head that slowly dissipates to a collar around the top. Lots of bubbles rising to the surface. Clear, sparkling pale gold body with good lacing. Hint of corn? in the aroma. Initial medium bitter flavor, with a light short finish. Watery, light to medium mouthfeel with lively carbonation. Good lawn mower beer."
"Labatt Blue pours a light, crystal clear yellow.There's a wispy white head that never rises in stature enough for there to be even a chance of having a discussion about head retention or lacing. What nose there is is largely of pale and cereal grains, and just a little bit corny. A faint herbal noble hop presence is a pleasant surprise. The flavor follows to a T, and I'm struggling to temper my disappointment in the relative lack of flavor with my expectations of the style. The body is predictably watery, but the carbonation does show some signs of life/assertiveness. All in all Labatt Blue is a serviceable macro ""pilsner", one that I find less offensive than some of it's brethren. That said, I don't see myself ever wanting to order it again."
"Solid beer for a solid price."
"Had this on tap in Buffalo right before crossing back to Ontario. $1.25 for a draft beer (I think 12 ounces) isn't a bad deal. This is even a fancy import (a whole 200 metres from Canada!). Pours a pale yellow colour with a finger of solid white head. Head doesn't dissipate at all, almost no lacing on the glass. Smells a bit grainy, pretty clean (ie. non-existent) for the most part. Small bitterness in the flavour. I suppose this beer is fine if you are thirsty."
"Drinkability- Average. Nothing special. Could pound if wanted too but I would choose something else for that."
"I'll admit the beer has taste to it but its very sweet (maybe its from corn?) and I am sort of having a hard time remembering if this is what I grew up with, it sort of feels close, but then again I always drank it out of the bottle. This is still pretty easy drinking all things considered but it gets into bubblegum beer territory."
"Had a few times by bottle and poured into a pint glass. From notes: Pours a yellow body. Nose is light lemon & very light malt. A hint of lactic sourness & a twinge of fruit (blueberry.) Flavor is light malt, a bit of lemon, minerals come through right before the finish. The finish itself is odd - a bit cloying but the fruitiness makes it taste almost corny. The lingering finish pils malt would be nice if not so cloying."
"RJT"
"D- Goes down extremely smooth could drink it all day!"
"This is average for the style but as most macros the flavor is very thin and watered down. Not really something I would drink again."
"The foam was light wheat in color and dissapated quickly. The color was deep golden yellow with some amber highlights. The taste had a balance of hops and wheat, a fruity and flowery undertones with a bit of tartness and end. Mouthfeel - medium to light bodied with a smidgen of dryness. Drinkability - smooth, somewhat dry and a little bitter. Ok session."
"Another example of a light, beer-flavored water that's tailor-made for drinking quickly, so as to avoid tasting it. Not one I'd drink again."
"Overall this is a stereotypical Adjunct Lager. Nothing horrible, but it is also boring. It is watery though, which makes it easy to chug down."
"Poured from a 16oz can into a standard pint glass (will keep it in the can next time for sure) pours a lite yellowy and fizzy, almost like a diet gingerale. head appears then disappears pretty fast. this has all the makings for a fine canadian pilsner... doesn't smell like much is going on, very bland. tastes like most beer of its style maybe with a little more sweetness. not a very good beer imo but i would still take it over a similar lager if i were given the choice at a hockey game or something."
"Labatt pours a light, golden hue with no head to speak of , just some random carb presence that manages to float up to the top. Aroma is sweet and grainy, that's about it. The taste begins with some sweetness from the malts, followed by a nutty graininess with just a touch of alcohol and no noticeable hop presence. Mouthfeel is light and watery with a moderate level of carbonation. Not much going on in this beer, the adjuncts provide some additional sweetness to the malt profile while a slight nutty/grainy presence pretty much makes up this beer. It's drinkable and more complex than some adjunct lagers, but not great by any means."
"Short review, but really not much to talk about. I would probably get one of these over a Bud Light but that isn't really saying much."
"Not a lager I would go looking for."
"Had this one when I was in Canada, and liked it fine. I even brought home some, yes I paid the duty. It smelled fine tasted good. Its look was average pale yellow. It had a higher alchohol content wich also helpped it.I would drink it again for sure."
"D- Very poor and boring."
"So I am not really sure what the exact color of this one is cause well I refuse to pour it into a glass. There is not much you can say about this one it is a normal macro beer,heavy on the corn flavor, very mild hops. They are built to drink and drink a lot of them. All in all I would rate this one way above most of the American macro beers, well except PBR. But this will defiantly have a place in my fridge especially during hockey season."
"Low head retention. not very easy to get it going either. Aside from that, no complaints on the appearance. Clear lager. Smells like absolutely nothing... taste clean and very slightly of yeast. nothing too fancy. bit watery. No bitterness or hop presents. actually highly drinkable. Another good substitution for water."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is on the higher side, but standard for the style. Drinkability isn't that great, there just isn't much going on here to make me want to drink more of it. Keeping style in mind though I think this is better then a lot of macros. Overall though it's just not that great of a beer."
"D: One of my two favorite macro beers along with Molson Canadian. A good choice if you're drinking for quantity and not for quality. There's nothing offensive about this beer but there's nothing that makes it great. Better then the usual macro."
"D: Blue is a good beer to sit around and drink and drink and drink and drink if that's your thing. It's easily drinkable and the taste isn't awful."
"Poured into a pint glass. Golden color with a white head that stays around for a bit at a single finger. The nose is a bit of light grain and some husk. The flavor brings a few too many grain husks. Light body with a lot of carbonation. Drinks well enough, but not all that good."
"Pours a typical straw yellow with a white head that receeds somewhat quickly. Smells of blunt corn and mild hops. The taste has almost no bitterness and is mostly muted malts and corn. Still the flavors are blended well enough to make a smooth and crisp beverage. Slight corny sweetness in the finish and the alcohol is pretty well hidden. This beer taste a lot less watered down and processed than the BMC beers. Overall it's a lousy style of beer and Labatt made the best of it. A refreshing brew when one drinks cold."
"From my brother-in-law's fridge. Offensive and detestable on every level. Carbonated brake fluid with infused mushroom juice -- that just about sums up this putrid macro swill. I can't remember any beer that has ever brought to the point of anger after consuming it. This one nearly has. Labatt Blue...a Canadian icon...a national shame."
"Pours a thin yellow color with a thick white head and a little lacing. Smells of grain, tastes of grain and some bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin but decent. Drinkability is okay."
"Keeping in mind that this is an adjunct, my expectations were low, but it was a cheap buy so I figured why not. The beer is the typical straw yellow color. Not to much in the way of smell, some light earth tones was all. Taste wise, it wasn't half bad. It was like most other adjuncts, but it didn't leave a bad after taste and was quite drinkable. Overall I would take it over the big 3 as far as a cheap beer goes, but it's nothing special."
"Years ago before I was into drinking and beer I asked a bartender for a good beer I should try. He said Labatt Blue, and I didn't notice anything wrong with it at the time. I know now one of several things were going on a) I was being hazed as a new drinker or a newbie to that bar, or b) He had some Labatt Blue he was having trouble getting rid of, or c) He was an idiot. Guess I'll never really know which one it was."
"This example was served ice cold straight from a 24 ounce can. It's light in color and bubbly from the healthy amount of carbonation that these types of lagers tend to have. The scent is unremarkable, if noticeable at all. It smells pretty watery really. The taste is what you'd expect from a sturdy adjunct lager. Blue rises above most of its American counterparts by being slightly more flavorful and thus, less bitter. Most domestic lagers seem so light to me that the carbonation creates a dominant bitterness in the flavor and mouth feel. Not so here. That's why Labatt Blue so middle of the road. It's flavorful enough that it's not offensive to the mouth, but light enough that it doesn't leave a lasting impression. That makes it an appropriate session beer for those on a budget, but I can't imagine trying to impress your friends with this, unless they're only familiar with Bud and Miller."
"Color is a little funny, almost a urine color, but who really cares? I really like this beer. I would agree with some who say that there is a ""funky"" after taste, but it's not horrible. I love the initial taste of this beer, and would recommend it to anyone."
"not something i recommend."
"It's nothing special but it's highly drinkable. I'd object to it calling itself a pils though, since it doesn't really seem like one."
"Poured in a glass for whiskey. Look: Very bright blond color, thin creamy foamy head, fed with many threads of bubbles. Smell: Very clean, some cooked vegetables. Taste: Pale malt and mineral water. Mouthfeel: Refreshing and extra fizzy, slightly bitter and very smooth body. Drinkability: I've drink better canadian beers but don't left me bad taste."
"I've never had Labatt's in a glass before, and I'm starting to think that I shouldn't have ventured into that realm. The beer itself isn't too bad, but it looks just like water with a drop of yellow food coloring in it. *Shrug* Just another beer."
"The color is pretty good, not nearly has transparent and water downed like some American lagers. Not much head or fizz going on, and I didn't catch much of a scent. But at ice cold, it's a great lager taste and it will have you reaching for more."
"drinkability-sort of the Budweiser of Canada and equally unimpressive"
"D - My first Blue in over a decade. I finished it but I don't plan on seeking this out again. Marketing this as a Pilsner is kind of misleading since it's really just a typical macro Lager."
"Drank from an 11.5 ounce bottle with no freshness date. Not a bad beer for the American Adjunct Lager style, I would choose this over most others. Nothing bad about the flavor, but nothing stands out either. Some malt flavor, no hops. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, very easy to drink after working outside all day in the 90 degree sun."
"D - For the style it has a very good drinkability. This beer doesn't make me cringe with every taste. It is easy to go through a few bottles and enjoy them."
"Drinkability: I suppose so, if your choices are limited. It's exactly as expected."
"D: Rather drinkable, goes down light."
"Another American Adjunct Lager, better some, worse than others. Not bad as long as it runs its course before it warms up."
"D: best when served cold. at least it is a step up from the light beers."
"Overall I have to admit it was not terrible. I am not admitting I would go by this one again, but it was certainly not the worst thing I had last night."
"d-beats most american macros, but only by a hair. a good beer for fishing or camping, but yeah, don't set the bar very high."
"Sure you can drink it, especially if you don't have taste buds."
"A great cheap ""Domestic"" (for those of you who live in Northern New York) I like the light almost as much."
"Taste, prickly carbonation hides a lack of substance for a little while. No discernable hopping. Malt was warmed, but definitely not roasted or anything similar. Good as a palate cleanser, but not much else."
"Not great. Not much taste. Not worth it."
"This is a prime example of Stone's ""fizzy yellow beers"". I could not even finish the pour before the fizzy bone-white head wanted to give up on me. Oh well. Color was a light lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity and loads of CO2 bubbles. Nose was not blue, green or even yellow - it was more brown. Sulfur, if you get my drift. That CAN actually be a good thing in some lagers, but not if adjuncts are involved. As Salty Dog once said, ""You homebrewers need to understand - the descriptor 'Fecal' should NOT be used as an adjunct!"" Ha! Words to drink by. Mouthfeel was thin for all of that carbonation. Jeez-O, I really feel as if I am missing out here. I refreshed the glass with more beer (I had a 24-oz. CAN to work with) and still did not get any fizz on the tongue. What I did get was that sulfurous nose, but a slight sweetness on the tongue. Maybe I should just hold my breath when I drink this. Or better yet, a clothespin, like I once did as a teenager with Stroh's (I REALLY disliked the original recipe as a kid, who knows what it is now)! That was actually better! It had the adjunct qualities that I now recognize immediately, but for the style, it was about par for the course. The nose, on the other hand ... Finish was slightly dry, unobtrusive, another dime-a-dozen macro adjunct lagers. Oh well. I still remember my first - liberty in Vancouver during Expo 1986 at a strip joint. It was much better then."
"Fair brew. Nothing great."
"There is a right time and place for everything and I enjoyed my share of these while visiting friends at college near canada. At almost 5.0% alcohol it might be worthwhile picking up a rack of these as opposed to bud."
"I first drank Labatt, my first Canadian beer years ago at a Red Wings game at the old Olympia Stadium...so I guess I have a ""soft spot"" for the brew. Labatt Blue is a better than average Macro."
"D- look... this is Syracuse. Labatt is the brew to have when you are trying to pound them out. It's everywhere! And it is a macro that is different. I will slam these all day long a scream an ode to Labatt as the best Macro out there"
"Avoid this beer!!! It's horrible and it's totally overpriced in the US."
"d- I tend to prefer my LaBatt one pitcher at a time, all night long. If you're restricted to bottles, you may need two hands. It's always available, it's always cheap, and it's better than the other domestics. Frankly, I like it."
"The appearance is sub-par (better on tap), the smell is sub-par, the taste is average, the mouthfeel is slightly above average and the drinkability is above average."
"Notes - OK mouthfeel with a good level of carbonation helping to deaden the flavor."
"Overall: My overall grade for this will probably leave the impression that I don't like this beer. That's not true thought. However given the grading criteria, Labatt Blue is an average beer, much in line with BMC products. It probably tastes better, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra cost. There are good domestic alternatives."
"A poundbackable brew, much better than Molson's. It's still not my style and not very tasty, but at least I know I can drink it. Cheap."
"Drinkability: It is a good pounder that leaves you wanting more. (3.5)"
"Overall a good reflection of the ""Budweiser-ization"" of mainstream North American breweries. A prime example of why good beer drinkers need to support good beer brewers - otherwise, this would be the extent of our variety. Canadian beer has SO much more to offer."
"D - There are better representations of this particular style out there, not that this is my favorite brewing style anyways. Move along folks, there's nothing to see (or taste) here."
"overall: great beer to hang out and chill with for no special events. Its a avg day beer"
"D: Upfront, it really isn't much to speak of, nothing jumps out or draws you to it, that being said it's not terrible and is a good doppelganger to the american macro's. All in All you can knock back a plenty of these, I'd drink again."
"Cheers!"
"Years ago, like more than 15, Labatt Blue was a much better beer. My father and I used to drink it, and when he'd give a bottle to a neighbor, they'd always remark how good it was. That flavor profile is sadly gone today. There is no hint of what of used to be. But, for one of today's macro brews, this stuff doesn't seem as bad to me as others have noted here. It's a passably good but somewhat plain tasting beer, maybe a little sweet. I can't find anything overtly bad or offensive about the flavor. It goes down smooth and it's a refreshing, lighter bodied beer. There are better beers for less money, like PBR. But, if you catch this on sale for less than $5 a six pack it's not a bad deal and good for something different once in a while."
"Had this beer in a bottle. No smell at all, small head. Color is average, taste is average at all. I would not have this beer all the time, it is not amazing! As far as a lager it is avarage, I prefer this one than a Molson. Would not recommend this beer to a friend. There are better beers than this! Cheers"
"This is not a favorite of mine by any means. It's too floral for it's own good, and it's trying to be different than the pack of Canadian Macro Lagers by having this floral characteristic so dominant in the brew. It's horrible for hangovers, so I do not recommend as a session beer unless you have an iron liver. The appearance on this beer is the only thing it has going for it in my opinion, which is average."
"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow with a fluffy white head that fades quickly. Has a malty and grainy smell with a little hint of sweet. The taste is pretty light with a slight malty sweet flavor. Has a pretty light bodied smooth mouthfeel. Goes down easy. I would drink it again."
"Buy Again? No"
"Can easily, and many times have, pound back quite a few of these a night. This is my go-to AAL."
"So overall, for drinkability, I'd take this over the actual AMERICAN adjunct lagers. strange."
"Hmm, what to say that hasn't already been said. I recall a time when I actually liked this, and thought it was better then your standard BMC. Maybe it was that appeal of it being an import and all that ice they use in the marketing. Having it again after all these years, and it is just a standard, terrible American (Canadian) Adjunct lager, and although many would claim it is somehow better than your standard BMC, I just don't taste it... Seriously, why even bother drinking this..."
"Pale gold topped by a fast-disappearing finger of fizzy white head. Faint sweet corn aroma, maybe a hint of straw. It's hard to tell, it's so tame. Mild, grainy flavour with hints of corn syrup and grass. It's very bland and inoffensive. Light, thin body; feels a little watery. There isn't really much to differentiate it from other adjunct lagers aside from the fact it costs more. It's not bad, but the quality of the product isn't good enough to make it worth trading up from High Life, Trailhead, or PBR."
"A pretty good Canadian Beer, probably not my favorite, but not as bad as others have said. Good option for a cheaper beer and still have pretty solid taste. My favorite thing about Labatt Blue is probably the drinkability. Smooth feel and taste, and inexpensive. I would recommend it."
"Overall conclusion: It's cheap! It's beer! It's decent! A pretty good value proposition."
"Drinkability: A dreadful product, really, that's both unpleasant and unrewarding and should be generally avoided."
"I gotta tell ya the truth. This aint nearly as good. It""s kinda watery, it doesn't have any kind of flavor, and frankly, it don't taste no different to me than something like Busch or Milwaukees Best. Kinda disappointed. Now, I will finish the six-pack, but I will be enjoying the Molson a whole lot more."
"D - not something I buy, but I've had worse"
"D: Overall this is a Par for the course beer. It's like nearly every other American Adjunct... So.. average down the board."
"I've had better macros from Canada but that's not saying much. You can spend less money on better beer"
"I like this beer. Smell is grainy, a bit sweet. Appearence is pretty typical of N. American lagers. Medium to light yellow, minimal head. Taste is good. Goes down smooth with a little bit more bite than US Lagers which I find enjoyable. You can drink this beer all nite long and not go wrong. Best for watchin hockey, the Canucks know what they're doing when it comes to beer (and hockey)!"
"Back in CA we'd say that since beer is mostly water you always wanted beer from as far north as possible, but Labatt Blue proves that geography is not destiny. Here endeth the lesson."
"There is nothing here that's 100% detestable. It has potential to be a decent beer, but it feels entirely compromised, rushed and made without a whole lot of love. It's just a commodity that somehow keeps this company in business decade after decade. So many better pilsners out there, you'd be foolish to go with this one for any reason other than total desperation and total lack of any other choices. That doesn't explain why I'm here looking at half a glass I'm not enthusiastic about finishing. Drain pour? Jury's out about that at this moment..."
"Conclusion: Nothing about this stands out...period...though, I would probably drink this over a Budweiser (as it's less sweet)."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a light pale yellow color, a thin white head that left no lacing. The aroma was of corn, some slight malt and a little sweetness. The taste is crisp with decent carbonation. Very clean but not much more to the taste. A lot of corn and some good bitter hop balance in the finish. Not a great beer, but refreshing on a hot day after doing some yard work. Was left over from a party so willing to drink a few, but probably won't pay import price for a sixer."
"Labatt Blue is very easy to drink and pretty flavorless. I guess it beats drinking a Budweiser since this brew has a little flavor going on. A decent lawnmower beer in the end but nothing too special."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, cheap party beer but severly lacking."
"D - Worth drinking but not worth buying often."
"Labatt blue is a straw yellow to golden with a little over a finger of frothy head that reduces its presence to a ring and leaves tiny trails of lacing. Aromas are weak, with really only grassy hops and corn discernible. Not impressive yet. The flavors are also weak and watery. Mildly toasted barley and biscuity malt with grass and steamed corn. This beer needs to kick up the hops a bit to fill in the missing components. Mouthfeel is the only thing this beer is good at. Medium body while still crisp. I wouldn't reach for this again, but I also wouldn't turn it down at a dinner (which Is where I had it tonight)."
"Drinkability: Typical mainstream pale lager - easy to drink but would rather have something else."
"OK, I was raised on Blue. Having said that, it is not the kind of beer that competes with the great breweries of the world. For a Macro, however, I find this beer exceptionally drinkable. The color is a nice gold with a frothy head (which disappears quickly). Lacing is not apparent. The smell is somewhat tinny. The taste is above average for most macro brews. A good session beer. There's nothing like rolling to a Buffalo Bills game with some Labatts Blue, a grill and a bunch af good friends! Cheers!"
"Not all that bad, for the style, for the first time in a very, very long time, and the 'when in Rome' environment surely doesn't hurt. Oh, who am I kidding - this is still a shitty, LCD Canuck lager, only bearable due to my current situation, and general don't give a fuck attitude right now. Put that in your marketing pipe, Inbev."
"Drinkability: Inoffensive and smooth, but lacking. It's easy drinking, the Canadian way. I'll take Molson or Moosehead any day, but Labatt Blue is still a decent brew to pound while watching the Argonauts and Eskimos."
"Overall: As a mass-produced and marketed beer, Labatt Blue's biggest strength is that there are competiting beers which are markedly worse than this one. While never offensive, it is never a rewarding beer to drink and only offers intoxication and thirst quenching as end benefits."
"light body, high carbonation, not great here either. like i said great drinkability when cold, terriable when warm. good party beer."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a one finger head to it with a slight lace left behind. The smell is of corn grains and some faint floral hops. The taste is a sweet malt and some floral hops that give a hop bitterness to balance out the malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is a little watery and moderate carbonation. The overall drinkability is above average for this one. If you judge it against other adjuncts it is an above average beer, it has some complexity and some hops attached to the grains."
"Cheers!"
"overall a decent macro lager, definitely more flavor than some others out there, and i like the floral hop notes, even if they aren't exactly overwhelming. minimal corn notes, more on the rice side of things."
"Just what you'd expect from the Canadian version of Budweiser... A thoroughly average beer. Can't understand why people drink this as oppossed to cheaper American Lagers.. Just goes to show image goes a long way in beer. The same people (mostly preppie college students) who insist that Budweiser and Genny are ""crap"" will call this their favorite beer. Very perplexing. Try a Molson instead!!"
"There are a lot of beers worse than this (Coors Light and Busch come to mind). I think this has more flaver than a good number of other adjunct lagers. That doesn't necessarily make it a good beer, but it's better than some others. No complexity, but something that is easily drinkable."
"Pale and fizzy beer with very little flavor, except some corn sweetness. Has a sort of metallic/odd aftertaste that unpleasantly persists in the mouth; the only think that makes it less drinkable than fizzy water. I don't see why bottles would taste like this. Definitely prefer PBR for my cheap adjunct."
"D- Not so much, could not finish my glass, I watered the nearby flowers with the rest of my ounces of this, hopefully they dont die."
"Well what can I say? It's canadas version of an american macro lager. It's yellow outta the bottle. A nice head after an aggressive pour. It smells slightly sweet. The taste is very light and basic. It's hard to review a beer that tastes like every other macro out there. Not offensive on the tongue. I moderate bite which I expected. I guess I could drink this but I would never buy it myself."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale straw color with 1/2 inch head. Hardly any aroma to speak of. Taste is crisp and not bad, although a tad bland. Refreshing in the mouth and good drinkability. Overall this is a very average beer."
"D- Highly drinkable. I would recommend over most American macros. Very enjoyable on a hot day."
"Looks, smells, tastes, feels, and goes down like a very very average macro. I'd go with any Pabst product before getting this again. Better than Bud or Miller, or no beer at all... but nothing exceptional here."
"Another beer snuck home from softball. A decent lager that actually used to be a ""favorite"" back in my early beer days. Now I don't particularly care for the flavor, but still can have a few after games."
"When watching hockey or just sitting after a day of work and classes Blue is normally a good choice. And if I don't wanna get drunk on something that is too horrible to stomach, Blue is also my choice."
"The taste is similar, firm apple cider with some grain and hay and a little grass, with wet grass coming on more in the finish. It has a good, zesty feel, and is crisp but not bland. Slightly sweet, it has only very light bitterness, but some of both, and the character holds up well, lasting 'till the end. For what it is, this is good."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very high carbonation"
"Not horrible, but not good....at least theres some hops in this one."
"Drinkability: It's not great, but in my opinion, it's better than some other American Adjuncts."
"Surprisingly thin mouthfeel with an accompanying watery flavor. A little grain flavor, little bitterness. Tastes like a typical mass light lager without the ricey adjunct taste found in some, a big plus. I was expecting a bit more flavor here, but I can't complain at this price. Goes down smooth and refreshes, a good beer to drink all day at a bbq."
"I'm rating the drinkability on this one average. It doesn't taste so horrible that you need to choke it down, but it is surely nothing to look forward to. At best, this is a beer for drinking when there is no other beer around. Not the best adjunct lager out there, but certainly not the worst, either."
"Bleh. This is boring and borderline offensive, even giving it leeway for its style. Stay away."
"d- goes down easy, great price, overall a beer to by in large quantities for bbq's and partys"
"Oh yeah, what's with the 11.5 oz. bottles? That's 1 less beer when you buy a case."
"The feel of this beer is light. Is pretty smooth and refreshing."
"D- It is what it is...really easy to drink, but no real taste. Better than most BMCs. Would make a good party/game beer."
"D- A drinkable adjunct, and one of the better ones. About a step up from BMC and a step below pabst. Also some of their hilarious commercials add some value to their product."
"Drinkability...well, if I was out on a boat and this was all there was I could probably finish a few without a problem. That being said, the other one of these in my fridge will be there for quite some time..."
"Labatts Blue is one of my all time favorites. To me it has a much better taste and body then your average domestic beer (i.e. Coors, Bud, etc.), which drives it's drinkability in my book."
"This is run of the mill macro lager. Pretty average."
"Drinkability- Very highly drinkable, so refreshing crips and enjoyable a good example of the lager style, worth a try, OH CANADA!"
"D- Beer pong, drinking game beer. Could have them all night, but I won't enjoy them that much..."
"This pours a pale, bland yellow like some many macros. The head is pretty thick, about one finger, and does leave a little lacing in the glass. The smell is corn and grains but nothing else, really. A light astringency follows. The taste is corn and light grains as well with very minimal malt and light herbal something. There's also a bitterness to it. Following is a very mild, somewhat odd sweetness. There's a twang of oddness in the finish. Skunk, perhaps? The mouthfeel is very thin and watery. This is, plain and simple, a regular old macro."
"Drinkability- I would obvious say this has no drinkability what so ever. Bitter taste, pungent smell...nothing good to say, except I'll probably never have it again."
"I was reacquainted with this brew at a recent function for my girlfriend and it seems as though Labatt has slightly modified the recipe. Pours a darkish yellow, carbonated body with a bubbly white head that swiftly dissipates. Smell and taste are corn, sweet malt, and light hops, with a mildly floral and grainy aroma. This time around, I noticed a much stronger hop presence in the nose, though cereal flavours dominate the palate. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and medium bodied with a smooth and watery finish. Overall, this is an okay option if you're at a bar or event that only serves macros beers."
"This beer is not too heavy, yet not too light. The way I would sum up Labatt Blue for you is ""the best of both worlds""."
"drinkability - well to put it simply ever corner bar in Buffalo has this in some form so I guess its pretty popular but I can't really get past the taste this beer always has going on, I'd rather drink Bud than this so I do, or there's always Molson Canadian"
"I poured this average everyday beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was very beercolored. The beer had no head at all and looked flat. The smell was a little like pee. Othere thanthat the beer was good.. It had a nice clean taste if you held your breath and was pleasant enough to drink. i will buy again."
"D - No doubt I could slam back a few of these fairly quickly, especially when it's hot. I had some friends from Canada who would drive into Louisiana just to pick up a couple of cases of Blue because they couldn't get it in Mississippi back a few years ago. I don't know why they went to all the trouble. This beer drinks fine, goes down easily and is crisp and refreshing but not much in the flavor department."
"Drinkability - another brand that simply survives on its ability to refresh when it's very cold on a hot day. There are many better choices, in my opinion."
"A very bland choice of brew. Doesn't go well with many foods and is not my first choice for a beer to watch TV with. Taste is sub-par and leaves a nasty after taste. I would just stay clear of this one. No head when poured into a glass (plastic cup) and color is pale and not appealing. Sorry but it a no go on this one."
"Pours basically the same color as other macros- maybe a slight hint darker. The foamy head disappears exceptionally fast. Within seconds, leaving a stale beer/ apple juice looking surface on top. I'm a little sick so I'm not picking up much aroma- maybe a little apple juice, metal, and adjunct. Nothing unpleasant, though. Mouthfeel is a little more fuller bodied than some other adjunct lagers that corresponds with some of the slightly maltier/apple juice (I'm not sure why I'm getting so much of that from this beer..) like flavors. I enjoy drinking this, but I also do not find it in any way delicious. Yet there's nothing wrong with it as far as I can tell. No paper taste like Miller Lite. No metallic smell like Bud. This is a good perfectly average beer to judge other beers by IMO. It's basically just beer- take it or leave it."
" Drink: very good can easly drink to many of these to fast"
"D: High, this is a beer you can pound back and get shitty with."
"D- lets just say i have had worse but i wont have anoth labatt. Its a nice beer to get a keg of if you are havinga huge party."
"Being that I used to live in Canada (more precisely Quebec) this is commonly found in my fridge, it's better than nearly all mass-produced American lagers and pilsners, but don't let the pilsner name fool you. There are better ones from Europe (like Pilsner Urquell) .. but this one isn't bad. InoffenCive taste, easy to drink, not much of a buzz. Cheers!"
"I've had this beer in draft, bottle and can, and the best is draft."
"An above average macro. Not too bad, but nothing great here by any means. Definitely a Lawnmower beer."
"I tend to drink a lot of Labatt since it is generally cheaper around here than many US beers. They claim it is transported into the state from Canada every day. Maybe it is, which is why is comes across as fresher than Molson brews."
"pours a very clear pale straw color about a one finger frothy white head and some light lace. odd cooked veggi smell. taste of corn with a very light mouthfeel and carbonation was good. it was left over beer that my daughter bought when she was here for christmas. so i thought i would try it but its not something i would buy."
"Used to be ""my beer."" Thank God it used to be, before I had my awakening. Had one from my buddy on New Year's. Very pale with a thin head. Smell was nonexistent beside some light grain odor. Taste was pretty blah or nonexistent. Definitely a beer made to be consumed to just pound back and get stupid. Not impressed with anything about this beer. I didn't drink the whole beer so I do not find it to be drinkable."
"I bought this at a distributor in town for 18 pack for $15.99, bit pricey for what it is... the appearance is paleish yellow. The smell isn't very strong, or appealing for that matter, mostly corn. taste is refreshing, carbonation is marginal at best. Easy to power a few of these down while watching your favorite hockey team play after happy hour. Nothing special, but not bad either."
"Another sampling from the ""create a sixpack"" at a local grocery. In college,many years ago, I thought this was a fine beer. It pours a very pale yellow body with an unimpressive white head that quickly vanishes without a trace. Aroma is faint, some herbal hops and a hint of skunk. Very light bodied, almost watery, but well carbonated. Taste is minimal. A hint of corn syrup and some grassy hops, nothing else to note. Nothing horrible, but nothing to recommend it."
"The beer pours like yellow-tinged water with a thin head. The smell is sweet corn malt with a little grass. The taste is sweet and a bit corny with a very clean finish. The mouthfeel is watery with weak carbonation. Look, this is a weak beer in taste and smell that is either meant to be consumed in large quantities or by people who don't know better. I guess there are worse things you can put in your mouth while watching a hockey game, but there's a lot more out there if you're willing to spend a little more money."
"If you want a watered down beer, that has little taste or aroma, and goes down like water, this is definitely for you. Compared to other macros I would rate this above average, but not by much."
"Cheers, EH! Hoser!"
"Pale yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste are the normal macro cereal taste.When served cold this is a fresh pleasant tasting beer.Good for watching hockey games or any sport at that matter.I would recommend and purchase again!!"
"(rated"
"Pours clear yellow with a white head. Grainy, kind of wheaty aroma, with sugar and metal. Crisp, slightly sweet taste of corn and corn syrup. Bitter hop finish. Similar to Mexican beers, some beers taste better with your surroundings. This beer is highly average, can be the wrong kind of bitter, and will easily skunk. But, if drank during a hockey game, it becomes quite enjoyable. Go Wings!"
"A clear yellow pour,white head that quickly fades to nothing.Slight grain aroma.A little bit sweet standard pale lager flavor but not gross like so many others,some detectable hop hints at leasst.Drinkable. I would opt for this over many american pale lagers."
"The flavor is really doesn't exist, no finish, no balance kinda skunky"
"Quite a sessionable brew. But it's very refreshing and it doesn't seem to carry that metallic aftertaste that you find in a lot of American Macros."
"D - Obviously easily drinkable in texture but will bore most who really enjoy the best in beer."
"MF&D - Thin and watery, but it did have a very slightly creaminess. Pretty much what you would expect all around."
"D: I have never understood the hype about Labatt. It's not even the best Canadian macro (Molson is actually rather good, in my opinion). It's better than your ultra-cheap Busch/Keystone/etc, but I'd take a Bud or High Life over this."
"Has a slight malty aroma, but not much more than that. And the expectant malty taste follows, with a fizzy palate. Body pours the color of a domestic-yellow, with some fizzy bubbles, very reminiscent of Big Brother beer."
"Labatt Blue, this is the clutch beer for when I am out at bars, or anywhere that serves beer. Since I am a college student, and when I do go out for a beer, I cannot afford much more than domestics at bars. So I drink this. For a macro this is really well done. But it is by no means a pilsner though. The price tag that accompanies this beer is quite ridiculous, at the beer store in Ontario, this retails for 36.50$ a case. By no means is this beer worth that price tag, buy at bars it is the cheapest beer you can buy. I've had this beer, in cans, in bottle, on tap. The different delivery modes, really don't affect this beer at all, it all tastes the exact same. When poured into a glass, it has a nice deep golden yellow color, and nice one inch head that sticks the whole way down. Smells of adjuncts, adjuncts, adjuncts! Specifically corn, and of that stock beer smell. For a macro its average, as they all smell of adjuncts. Blue has a very smooth crisp taste, nice hop bitterness, its surprising to taste hops in a macro, but this has it. Just a real enjoyable taste. Nice full, smooth mouthfeel, very satisfying. This beer is an easy session beer, when cold it goes down like water, and pairs nicely with pizza and chicken wings. I recommend this beer when you are going to a bar, but when staying in to get that buzz, you can do just as well for much much cheaper. I highly recommend this beer! As it is my favorite domestic beer!"
"Drinkability is pretty good but only if very cold. Good choice when selection is limited."
"D - This is an okay macro lager. Nothing to write home about, but it works in deep in the North woods."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. This might be my new go to beer for places that have bad beer selections."
"D - Bleh. Other American macros serve their purpose better. This is completely devoid of flavor and character, a poor example of the style and a poor beer overall."
"This is a very thin and watery brew that is as basic as it gets. Thant being said, it's not horrible as far as macros go."
"Pours the standard fizzy yellow color with a bit of nice head at first, but no real lacing. It has a good, sharp, scent, a little malty and a little skunky, nothing too strong, though. Good taste, a bit fizzy, slight spiciness, but mostly the malty lager flavor. Goes down fine. Overall, quite average for a macro; not bad, not good."
"Final Thought: Why drink this when PBR exists?"
"Not worth the price."
"Drinkability: Very easy...I could drink one after another. For what it is worth, this is a decent beer. I would hardly say that it is the best out there however if you are looking for a cheap beer with a decent taste this is the way to go. I'd also recommend eating it with some sort of beef."
"Best macro you can buy. If I don't feel like spending the money on a micro I pick up some of these. It is on the lighter side but to to light that you can't taste the pilsner flavor, I love pilsners. I can and have drank many in one night with no problem. I attend college near Canada and they are cheaper up here which is what mainly got me started on them, a giant leap in taste from the normal college beer of keystone light, blah. The beer is admititly better in Canada, they are keeping the good stuff for them selves. Ontop of all that they give away cool stuff in thier 24's certain times of the year. Recomend bottles in America and Drafts in Canada."
"The fizziness is pretty big and would get to me after awhile, even for the style, though it manages to keep something of a body. Very clean. Inoffensive. A bit of sweetness hangs on. Not a bad ""lawn-mower"" beer, though there are others that are cheaper that work just as well for that. Judged in style - could be better, could be much worse. I gave it the same score as Molson Canadian, but would probably take it over that."
"Surprisingly, however, this beer didn't offend me as much as I expected it to. As far as macro lagers go this one is above par and as far as my personal tastes go I've enjoyed this about as much as I'm capable of enjoying the style. That said, I wouldn't mind it if I never see a Labatt's product again, actually I might quite like it."
"Appearance straw in color with smale quickly disapating head. Smell some adjunents and malty sweetness. Taste sweet malt some corn and no hops. Mouthfeel light body mediem carbonation. Drinkability if its Ice cold and free I might have one or two its starts to loose its appeale after that."
"Pours a golden color with a moderate to large head for the style that fizzles away rather quickly. Corn, grainy, some sweet malty mixture but this is bad and actually not really drinkable. A bit skunky. I recall not even liking this one in College and I hardly had beer standards way back then."
"Big fizzy, frothy head display nice lacing and some retention before descending to a thing white ring. Aromas of assorted grains, sweet corn, rice some wheat. Flavors were bleached an unassertive but also inoffensive. Very macro-brewery. Quickly citric at first, yeast in the middle, wheat and corn at the end. Dry finish and rather clean. Light bodied with high carbonation but still quite drinkable. Pretty damn good for what it is and if you have to drink this type (think Coors, Bud, Miller, Michelob) it's really the best one out there. Beer pong!"
"D: For the style, this one is quite nice. A light and non-offensive taste makes this one an easy drinker."
"This is the typical Canadian macro. Not awful for the style. Dogs and burger type of beer. This is not the first thing to grab at the liquor store. But when the party/cookout offers this or Bud, I chose this and it was probably the better choice."
"There's nothing offensive about this beer at all, and I think it's one of the better mac lagers out there, and I don't mind even picking up a sixer once in a while."
"Thin watery mouthfeel. Canadian macro at it's worst."
"D. Not great. Good on a hot day or when you want something very light. I know that this may go against beer lovers rules but drink VERY cold!"
"Bottle - Pours a light golden color with a small white. Light lacing. Aroma is light grain and herbal hops. Flavor is much of the same. There is nothing really special about this beer, but it was easy to drink. Seems like a more expensive version of Bud, Miller, or Coors. Save your money and by PBR if you are going for a cheap lager."
"Labatt Blue is to Canada as Budweiser is to America. Nothing much else to say about this beer. A standard decent brew, I will order this on tap at a bar once in a while just for a change of pace. Medium yellow body, thin head. Faint aroma and a neutral, watery flavor."
"D: A drinkable macro and one I could easily enjoy if no other options were available. Quite surprised by this and respectable all around."
"Rather bland, it is decent at a bar on special and I don't mind one here or there while watching a hockey game."
"It drinks OK. One of my sentimental favorites for macros. Of course, this may sound like damnation with faint praise, as in saying ""one of the most benevolent dictators in Africa," but I've had much worse. Goes best with chicken wings from Duff's or your own deep fryer, or whenever a Bills' or Sabres game is on. Drink extra-wicked-super cold."
"Not at all a poor selection for the style, yet nothing above and beyond..."
"Overall a decent Canadian macro. Easy enough to drink."
"First, this is maybe my second favorite macro-brew. Appearance is clear-yellow. taste is decent for what your getting, II would say this is way better than the American macros like Bud and Miller. Not great but on a hot summer day, Ice cold very refreshing."
"Pale yellow,crystal clear with a slight fine head.Smells pretty darn clean a little cooked corn and a faint wisp of lemony hops.Not bad, but not really good either,tastes like other popular beers of it's ilk (Molson canadian,Fosters...)pretty run of the mill just bland and squeaky clean enough to be inoffensive.A clean little barely detectable hop bite in the finish. Smooth medium mouthfeel with a very mild carbonation.Overall this beer is okay but only if it's really cheap or free.You can find much more interesting brew in the same or lower price range."
"Leftover from my Game 7 shindig. This brew pours a very pale yellow with a fizzy white head with lost of bubble throughout. Aroma is not much, some corn, grassy herbs and lemon. Taste is sharp and carbonated, but a lot less than most macros, some grassy grains, but not a lot else, mostly watery. Finishes very smooth, not a brutal as some others from this style. Actually very refreshing. It's not a lot different than water, but that's what you're looking for here. Definitely at the drinkable end of this style."
"D Excellent, much like the water that makes up most of this beer. It is very ""refreshing"" due to its similarity to water. If you just want a light refreshing beer then this is your beer!"
"Passable for what it is, though it starts getting old after just a few."
"it pours with virtually no foam, it is clear yellow. smell is not pleasant, and the taste is watery with a hint of skunk. drinkable maybe if im on the lake with no other lager in sight. i would much rather have a keystone they both taste similar and one is a heck of a lot cheaper."
"Drinkability is pretty good. When this beer is on sale I don't hesitate to pick it up over other macros, just to have something in the fridge. And it's probably a little better than the score suggests."
"By no means a masterpiece, but definitely a good long-night beer. Especially at a sabres/bills game... Here's to everyone in buffalo that loves Blue!"
"Clearish yellow witha quickly disappearing white head. Very mild stale hop aroma. A decent malt profile here, I can almost taste them. Easy to drink as it taste much like water. A little bitter stinge keeps it from being too exciting. The Canadian version of an American version of a European version discount beer. I would pass on this in the future and go for a water."
"Appears fizzy yellow with a bright white head crystal clear body, and the head dwindles instantly as you pour it. Thin scant lacing is strung unvevnly around my pint glass. Aroma strong cereal notes very industrial lager in nature light grain notes with a mineral character with no real hops to speak of. Flavor is even unoffensive crisp and refreshing, definitely a solid option especially when 12 packs are 9.99 at the grocery store. Again American light lager prety boring not much to say no real hop flavor. Mouthfeel is overcarbonated thin water texture to me. Drinkability is alright for what it is, I do have good memories drinking this stuff my freshman year of college up around Erie seemed like this BMC and Yuengling were every where you went to drink."
"Labatt Blue is a Buffalo favorite. If you were to walk into any bar in Buffalo your sure to find Labatt Blue or Blue Light on tap or in bottles. Labatt Blue pours a light golden yellow with a big foamy head. It has good carbonation and clarity. The aroma is light with rice cereal malts and grassy straw like hops. The flavor is delicate with some sweet cereal malts up front that turn dry with a crisp citrusy bitter finish. ""Blue"" is light bodied thin and a highly drinkable Canadian pilsner. It's a great beer for watching hockey, [GO SABRES] or as an accompaniment to a traditional Buffalo style fish fry."
"M/D - Overly carbonated but not bad. Very drinkable given the type."
"A nice canadian beer. Color pours dark yellow with a strong yet not overbearring smell. A beer you can have by the pool and at dinner. Tastes strong but not overbarring either. The kind of beer you keep in stock. Not a one and done. A beer you can keep and offer up to friends."
"This beer is on a level with the Miller's, Bud's Corr's. Nothing at all special."
"D: I could drink this stuff all night, especially if looking to tie one on. It is boring and uninteresting, and would make a great party beer, something to drink, but nothing spectacular at all. I'd rather have a PBR."
"Otherwise it's your typical corn and grain tasting macro lager. It seems to go a little heavier on the grainy flavors, which would work if there was some carbonation to clean it away after drinking."
"Overall - a beer you get when you're having a ton of people over and you can't afford the good stuff, yet, people love it so you'll please them and please your wallet. A decent social drink when you're in the mood for something light and cheap."
"D- This is far from drinkable... however, if you're already drunk, then this will go down smoother than most other macros on the market. *Warning: don't drink sober."
"D--Just not very good even for this style. Bud of the North."
"Kinda thin and fizzy although the drinkability is a bit above BMC if this is your bag. This beer is very Canadian; sounds better than the American version but really is just a different take."
"Don't be afraid to drink it without though. Actually a higher quality beer than expected."
"Not much here as far as depth of taste, but this is definately an upscale beer of the style. It is very drinkable as a session beer, and it is popularly used as such. It should definately be chosen over many American rivals, but does not have any miraculous quality for being Canadian."
"nonetheless, it's still a basic man's basic brainwashed beer."
"The bottom line is that while this is far from the premium beer that many Americans seem to think it is, it's inexpensive, easy-drinking, and a bit better than BMC swill. If my budget is tight when I'm shopping for some weekend brews, Labatt Blue will usually suffice."
"The experience got better as I creeped along this beer, perhaps I got used to the adjuncts. There are imports in the US which are worse and more expensive than this. But remember (Americans) I sampled mine in Canada where it's considered domestic beer."
"I would take a Labatt blue over any American Macro-Brew anyday, not horrible for the price. I only drink it after I have had something else that is good on draft, or if it is a cheap draft at a bar, like for a dollar. I have found this beer is a little more tolerable with a slice of lemon in it."
"Color is yellow with white head characteristics of the style. Compares favorably to BMCs has a more interesting aroma and taste. Taste goes well with food. High drinkability. If you are willing to order the second one you can drink them all night. This is a great style of beer but within the style, Labatt is not bad."
"This is a nice, steady, reliable Canadian beverage. It's better than similar American staples such as Budweiser, but not spectacular. It's a nice golden ale, presenting nothing special upon pouring. But the taste is nice, clean and mild with no biting aftertaste. It's an easy beer to consume on a hot day, or hanging out on the porch with friends. Nothing about it will wow you, but it's a good steady--good to go back to after sampling other styles."
"Drinkability: Consumable beer. Seems to be trying hard not to offend. I remember that this beer used to have more character than this."
"I was hoping to find a decent cheap Canadian macro here, going on memories of yesteryear and attracted to the cool blue graphics, but the reality is this beer sucks. Tried to drink 2 cans on 2 separate occasions and proceeded to pour both down the sink. It's sweet, evoking dorm-room cleaner, it tastes like adjunct with no hop. For a go-to pilsner style macro I'm sticking with Beck's."
"I had three of these tonight (only thing available) and I came away being distinctly unimpressed. As far as macro lagers go, I suppose it's better than Budweiser, but still very generic and almost watery. It's not a terrible beer, but I wouldn't waste my money on a such a forgettable brew. Too much rice and corn in this one I think, because you can't hardly taste any hops. Give this one a pass. It's made for the market that doesn't want any flavor in their beer."
"Drinkability - Drinkable as in not filling, but there are several lagers out there that can say the same thing but taste better."
"Pours a typical golden yellow color with minimal white head. Average smell with some corn, some grain and a little bit bit of a yeast presence. Taste is a little watered down with a nice refreshing carbonation too. Some sweetness comes through in the end."
"The only issue with this beer in my view is that there's a ""twang"" at the end of any pull from it. Some people might like that, hate it, or just don't care."
"D- refreshing clean and easy to drink as a thirst quencher but molson or moosehead make a much better ""canadian"" macro lager."
"Sampled qutie a few Lagers and Pilsners during this session. This beer turned out to be the most sulfuric and ill-balanced of the bunch. Starts off with a typical crystal-clear, fizzy carbonated, active beer, with a head formation that failed to retain. Aromas of cereal grains / adjuncts and light pilsner malt are dominated by sulfury aromas of cooked vegetables (corn) and a harsh match-stick burning sensation in the nose. Flavors also pick up on the corn flavors (from sulfur and pilsner malts). A residual corn-like sweetness proves quite distracting. A follow-up of astingent husk flavors and green apples round out the beer. A bit heavy / oily in the mouthfeel with a finish that emphasizes the unbalanced sweetness. Those crazy Northerners will apparently drink anything."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a thin fizzy white head. The aroma and taste are both representative of your typical macro lager flavors with some faint grainy malt and a touch of hops. Overall, there is not much else to say about this brew. Nothing special here, just your typical macro lager that simply blends in with BMC."
"Pours a clear straw with a pure white, loose, head. Drops quickly to almost nothing. Smells typically macro-y, and tastes about the same. Maybe even less flavour than a typical macro. Light bodied, fizzy, nothing really interesting here. There's a odd chemical smell I associate with clothing stores in this one. Also the finish is a touch sweeter than the average. Not terrible, and oddly, not as bad as I remembered it. Still, one of the blandest beers I've ever had."
"I wanted to pick up the Labatt 50 ale, but decided on this instead. I'm hoping the other offerings from this Canadian breer are a bit different, but for now, Molson will stay on top as king of the Great White North."
"Buddy of mine buys this one all the time,and that's where i come in,cause i never buy Blue,but never turn down a beer when offered,hell no,this one's very pale yellow with 1 finger head that's bright white and don't last and no lacing at all,it smells kinda green and hints of corn and it tastes refreshing upon first swig but than the bitterness kinda kicks in along with the green and skunky aftertaste,,,you really notice the skunkiness when it warms up,it's got a med to heavy feel to it with the carbonation,..like i said before,i won't buy this beer but will continue to drink it if my buddy keeps offering,,,but drink it ice cold and before it get warmed so down it fast."
"Pours a very pale straw color with plenty of light fluffy head. There's a very very faint yeasty scent to it, but that's about it. It really doesn't smell like much at all. Doesn't taste like a whole lot either. It's very clean tasting with a tiny bit of bitterness there, but I don't detect any hop or malt flavor. Finishes clean (surprise surprise). The mouthfeel is watery and thin. Overall, it's drinkable, mostly because there's nothing there to object to, unless you object to flavorless beer."
"D - Overall it's not the worst thing I've ever swilled."
"Pours a mild yellow color with carbonation that fades after a minute. Very strong aroma with some malt. Somewhat sweet in taste with a weird mouthfeel, somewhat grainy. Not too bad but again, nothing really impressive. I forgot the last time I had Blue anyway."
"Pours a pale yellow color with no head retention or lacing (on-tap into a pint glass). Has a weak smell to it, which consists of the standard corn and rice malts. Weak taste, too, which also tastes like malted corn and rice. This beer has a very, very light mouthfeel, and is highly carbonated. A very easy beer to drink, but lacking in taste and depth. Drink this at the bar when you don't want to spend a lot of money."
""
"Flavor is worse than I expected. I think this is worse than even the big light American macros out there. Standard mechanical grainy flavor, no hops. Just as watery as a light beer, which is depressing."
"This is also my first review of a really big macro-lager, mostly because I just haven't had much since I started reviewing. And this Blue reminded me why that is!"
"revisited this one when i needed some beer to parboil some brats at someone's lake house and did not want to waste any precious 3f's beer. this is a light straw in color and perfectly clear. obviously, a snow white head. as for aroma, i was able to detect some sweet malts and adjuncts, along with just a hint of grassy straw. taste had a not so bad light malt sweetness that was balanced by carbonation and very little hop bitterness. light in body. on the better end of macro swill, that and 50 cents will get you a newspaper."
"Wow, I didn't expect it, but it makes sense in hindsight. This tastes worse than it's light version. I guess the additional flavor is more than it can handle. If you're going to drink this beer, I guess the key is to not let it warm up at all. Chilled, its plain and sweet, but all sorts of nasties come out with warmth."
"lawnmower applications."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a light gold, without forming any kind of head or lacing. The aroma is a suprise. Considering it is a macro-lager style, there are actually hints of hops on the aroma. The taste is a little more flavorful than your typical American macro lager. Not by much, but there are hints of hops and malts in the taste. The mouthfeel is also a little bit thicker for the style. A very drinkable lager. Overall, I was impressed. This is a step up from from the usual BMC lager. Worth a try."
"25.3 oz ""Big Blue"" can. Pours the standard macro fizzy pale yellow with a one finger head that leaves a sticky collar. A moderate aroma of cheap malts and corn on the nose. Taste is slightly sweet and somewhat tinny, is there such a thing as a corny metallic taste? Mouthfeel is a seltzer-like fizzy wateriness. The wording on the can indicates that this is a ""Canadian Pilsner", but somebody forgot to throw some Saaz hops into the brew kettle. Overall, like most canadian macros, this is slightly better that its American BMC cousins, but not by a whole lot. It would suffice as a ""between paychecks"" brew, or would be even better with a burger off the grill on a hot summer day. Better quality macroswill, but macroswill just the same."
"Not a beer that thrills me. First off...I have to admit that of Canada's two mega-breweries, I have generally supported Molson. In fact, I've only tried three Labatt products. Labatt Blue, John Labatt Classic, and Labatt Copper (you all remember Labatt Copper don't you? 1995? National campaign which had Copper X and Copper Y and beer drinkers voted which was their favourite? and the winner lasted all of 5 months in beer stores). Anyway, I digress. Blue is supposedly Canada's beer of choice. The aroma was malty, but dissipated quickly. The colour was a very pale yellow with a slight head. The mouthfeel was very watery suggesting that if you enjoy the flavour, you can probably down these by the case. The flavour was nothing to write home about as it too was watery with only slight malt tones. All in all a forgettable beer."
"This is my favorite of the macro family. Couldn't see the color because I had to drink it from the bottle. The smell was faint but malty. The beer tastes grainy and malty with very little in the way of hops. To me one of the better macros but too expensive for what is offered. This beer is worth a try though if looking for something light and not too complicated."
"Pours a typical clear golden yellow, head does not last. Aroma is average, malty without any undertones - nothing special, but not repulsive, either. Taste is about what one would expect, smooth with no bitterness. I detected a slight metallic hint - probably since I sampled it from a can - and found this beer a little watery but still palatable."
"The pourability of this beer was good. Not to much carbonation as to overfill the glass. The head was a little sweet and it disapeared very fast with no residue clinging to the glass. The beer itself was a light yellow.The carbonation lasted throughout the glass. It had a slightly sweet taste that wasnt overwhelming. The second glassfull provided very little head. The overall taste of the beer was one that provided very little flavor. I think if I caught a good sale on this beer, I would try it again, but not on a regular basis. It was good for a change of flavor."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is extremely clear and is a light yellow color. An effervescent head that quickly dies away to nothing is followed by a field of bubbles that rise from the depths of the glass. The smell is all malt, very sweet - almost apple-like, and slightly grainy. The taste is just as sweet as the smell with the fruitiness coming out slightly followed by a moderately dry, grainy finish. There is also a slight metallic taste. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a decent amount of carbonation, but not overwhelming. This beer is too sweet for me... the drinkability suffers as a result."
"D - This is a good ""getting drunk tonight"" beer. I know, I know...RESPECT BEER...well, most of the time anyway. If you so choose to disrespect beer, this would be a decent weapon of choice."
"This is generally my favorite macro. A stronger than normal malt flavor comes out and flirts with the tongue. But it is one dimensional and my offering today was overcarbonated. Would some hops flavor help? Certainly, though the bitterness is probably at just the correct level so no complaints there. A brew I can enjoy (instead of choke down) when circumstances dictate it."
"this was served at a colder temp than most at this bar, which was fortunate for this beer. Light white head that quickly disappeared; no lace. Sweet beery aroma with a hint of hop. Flavors the same. Finish is sweet. Yellow gold color. Not much going on here at all."
"D - Not much to describe here, it's a pretty standard macrolager. Not really sure if it's any better or worse than its American counterparts, although some swear by its supremacy / difference. Can't say that I agree."
"Pours a light yellow straw color, a small head that disappears quickly. Nose is very mild, some skunkiness, grain. Doesn't smell too good. Taste is also very mild. Light skunkiness, again, with some very mild malt, light apples. Overall a very mild flavor. Mouth feel is this bodied, standard carbonation. Its not a particularly great beer, but one you can drink a bunch of."
"Final Statement: This last one poured into a pils glass at home was no where near as enjoyable as the 7 I drank from the can on the lake. I guess there's just something about throwing cans of beer in a rucksack and drinking them in the wilderness. Regardless, this is one of the better macros, and its filled with memories of watching Labatt Blue Jays Baseball as a kid, so I go to it every so often for certain occassions. I'm reviewing it as a macro lager, but a macro lager is still a macro lager so I can't exactly give it 5's even though its one of the better ones."
"One of the least impressive beers I have ever had. The beer lacks an aroma on the first smell, even when a 1 finger head is present. Very light bodied. The initial taste was crisp, but very watery, it does go down quite easily, and somewhat drinkable. An ok beer for a small price."
"this is not a bad macro. It is a favorite among beer drinkers around here who do not mind forking over an extra penny. It is just your regular macro but adds an interesting hop bite to the initial taste and aftertaste. The mouthfeel is slightly overcarbonated and watery but its drinkable overall."
"Nothing special here. For the cost it has some decent taste but not exactly the best taste in the world. It's very smooth and goes down very easy. The head is simply white with no volume or thickness to it. A good comparison would be Budweiser. The smell is that of grain, and nothing impressive as well."
"This was very similar to PBR and Bud. The oilcan was a good value, though this is definitely a lawnmower beer."
"D- Easy going macro lager. One of the better North American macros I've had."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It goes down easy enough. But, it's not quite tasty enough for me to session this beer. Overall, it's drinkable. I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it. But, it doesn't offend me."
"D: Not tasty at all, the fact that it's not filling is about the only good thing I can say about it. I definitely would not drink it again."
"D: Good beer for a long night of drinking. Other than that, this brew isn't worth buying."
"As macros go, this is a non-offensive one. A good choice if there's nothing but macro."
"I see no reason to ever drink this one again."
"Very light and carbonated. I could drink several of these on a hot day after some hard work. I grew up on this stuff and it was more impressive then since the alternative was some western NY macro."
"Crystal clear pale yellow with a fluffy, coarse, white head off the pour that fell quickly. Not much lacing and the retention wasn't hot either. There's a bit of herbal hop and light sweetness to the aroma. Some bitterness, a bit sweet but not malty. Finishes dry. Not much flavour overall. Rough carbonation with a light, watery body. Not as bad as I remember, but there are definitely better macro lagers on the market."
"Not bad. Not my ""regular"" beer, but not bad at all. I can't wait for summer to mow the lawn and enjoy one of these."
"Drinkability, as with all the best macros, is very good. Labatt Blue is a versatile beer, for me at least. Good in the winter at the bar around the corner from the hockey rink, and good in the summer at the beach. Probably the most drinkable macro available if you live in the northern states."
"Drinkability: Not bad for a macro beer. The bitterness is unpleasant and unecessary. Would prefer more malt for a lager beer. Not much distinguishable flavors. Cheap beer is you want to get drunk. Stick to better beer."
"Eric"
"Clear slightly greenish gold under a one finger white head that fades very quickly to whisps of film and a thin collar, leaving no lace whatsoever. The nose is very mild and plain, with a bit of adjunct malt and a touch of metallic bitter. The mouth is very light and very well carbonated. Standard fare here, with little to compliment. The malt is weak and slightly cornish. The hops are mild and metallic, with a slightly harsh bitterness that barely emerges at all. It's not horrible (which is what I expected - sorry, Curtis), but it certainly isn't great."
"This is an old fallback for a hot day. This has your typical lager look, head, and taste. The bubbles are large, and dance off your tongue. If you are looking for something new, look elsewhere. If you are looking for Budweiser, grab this instead. I enjoy it infrequently, as is merited by it's quality."
"A nice, light amber body with a decent, white, thick head with good retention. Didn't smell much of anything. Didn't taste like anything either, more like a light beer. I had this beer a while ago from a bottle and it tasted better than from the tap. Not a good mouthfeel at all; felt like water. Drinkable if you like light beers or are in the mood for light beers."
"Drinkable if you are partying and want to get smashed I suppose, like the purpose of any Macro Lager. Other than that, nope."
"This was much better than the last time I had it. It was not extremely bitter like the last time, but was replaced with some tolerable sweetness and that finishing grainy corn taste. It is stronger compared to most weak-ass AMLs. I do not know why this beer changed so much on me. It was good enough to crunked off an 18 pack (not that I drank the whole 18 pack, at least I do not think I did) last night at my friends place. Cheers to more future 18 packs of a misjudged AML."
"This is the second Canadian beer I have been able to try. The first being Moosehead. Labatt Blue is a solid beer. I'd say the label is a little ugly, but then again it is what's in the bottle that matters to me. I found Labatt to have a good, but not overpowering taste. Labatt seemed to be very smooth on the way down. For me, I found that after having several beers in a row I still enjoyed the beer, which is saying a lot. Usually I would perfer to switch beers after 4 in a row, but Labatt I can easily drink an entire sixer and enjoy it the whole way through. All in all this is a fine beer."
"Color is light gold. Pours with a Light head which leaves no lacing. Nice dry slightly sweet taste. Easy to drink a ""decent"" Macro. Very light mouthfeel. Easy to drink, not expensive. Good session beer or party beer. Not very bad or impressive, but not a beer I buy more than two times a year."
"This is the beer that I drink with my friends who either dont want to drink or dont want to pay for microbrews. It is straw yellow in color and very carbonated with a slight hoppy bitterness. Its taste is average yet a little watery. Overall, it is a drinkable beer that is a better alternative than miller and bud as it still maintains the semblance of beer."
"Bottle. This has been my old stand-by since 1996. While it easily tops most other Mid-West Macros, it does not live up to the more favorful crafts and Europeans. ""Blue"" does have a bit of sweatness compared to most Macros. It's flavor does fade fast compared to better examples. But, it serves well when friends and family stop by and can be found everywhere in the Detroit area."
"Like many reviewers, I had at one time, thought this beer was an ""import"". My tastes have changed but I would still drink this beer on a hot, humid day, especially after cutting the grass. There is not much at all to this but that's OK. Just drink when appropriate."
"This beer essentially has no taste or smell to speak of. While in college, I used to view this beer as a treat from our Canadian neighbors to the north. I no longer hold that opinion. A: Standard macro pale yellow with very low carbonation, and practically no head or lacing. Smell was imperceptible with maybe a tiny hint of corn? The taste is much like the smell, not necessarily bad, just not there. Mouthfeel is standard macro fare i.e. thin and watery. DrinkabiIity is fairly high as with no real taste, it drinks like water. I could see this being a thirst quencher on a hot summer day, but not much else. I've been reinvestigating macros from my past to see how my tastes have changed and man have they ever."
"The can is fizzy and has a pungent corny smell. For some reason it always tastes like the aluminum can. Maybe a slight rubbery smell? wow. How my taste has changed..."
"I think if you like miller lite, you might like this. I don't think it's anything special, smells are faint as well as taste. Corn adjunct is just nasty. It's somewhat crispy and easy to chug I guess. I'd stay away from it though."
"Blue is what it is. It's a fairly average to sub-par macro lager. Nothing worth going out of your way for."
"Labatt Blue pours a typical macro yellow with a white head from a brown eleven and a half ounce bottle. Aroma is mild, perhaps a bit of malt. Taste is actually fairly good for the style. Decent lawnmower beer, good alternative to b/m/c. Not worth seeking out, but I wouldn't turn one down either."
"Overall: A substandard macro. I would avoid this one. I reviewed Bud Light the other day, and I think its the better of the two."
"If you plan on drinking a lot, and want something a step up, this is a fine option. When I feel like ""slumming it," I reach for this or Honeyweiss."
" . Bottom line is: Not a bad beer, and it's worth a try, If your a fan of canadian lagers, than you should give this one a try."
"Drinkability is okay. Certainly consuming it on a hot day or at a hockey game (Labatt currently sponsors Hockey Night in Canada) will enhance your experience with this beer."
"This isn't a bad macro, it jsut isn't good either, want a good macro, drink some Gumballhead, its tasty"
"Pretty darn drinkable. Was skeptical, so I had 2 more. This was tasty. I would say this beer must need to turn quick to stay in form, but maybe it just hit the right notes that evening"
"kinda boring eh."
"Drinkability: i would recomend it for a frat party otherwise i would keep away"
"Drinkability: Hey did I mention this beer is watery and non-offensive. A person could suck these down all day. The beer is not terrible but I would only drink this again if it was free and nothing else was available."
"Straw yellow in color, good initial head...kind of like colored water. Smells of corn and vegetables, still not skunky like some I've tried. Taste is similarly mainly corn, with some bitterness in the finish. I had this in my sunroom...where it was hot, so it was very refreshing. Mouthfeel is light, fairly smooth. Very easy to drink, good on a hot day. I definitely prefer the better brews, but this would defintely be a good lawnmower beer."
"This beer is absolutely atrocious. There is no flavor to it whatsoever. It is like drinking flat, flavorless soda. I would take Bud over this any day of the week. It is truly repulsive due to its absolute lack of flavor."
"Call it a triple-last resort beer, it isn't terrible. It can actually be quite refreshing in some circumstances, (think a hot sunny day at the ballpark)."
"Has a thin yet consistent mouthfeel, unlike many macros the carbonation isn't overpowering. Weak taste, a bit hoppy but not much else there. Due to this weak taste and thin consistency it is very asy to drink. Not a bad beer if you're not looking to shell out the cash for a microbrew, but for a couple more bucks one could get an 18 pack of American Macro rather than a halfrack of this. I don't see much of a quality difference between the two."
"Even for the style, just not a good beer. The only reason I can think the Bros would recommend it is as a lesson in pain and appreciation of much better beers."
"I've had this in Canada before and I swear it tasted better there...."
"I am perplexed. I usually drink cans of this stuff and I don't like it for the style, I have even expressed the thought that other than Corona it is the worst beer-for-the-buck there is ... paying import price for macro swill. Too carbonated, hops just taste skunky, and hard to get drunk off of (which is what I look for in a macro lager). Not the same on the 1/8th barrel, though! Quite a different story. This requires more research and maybe a new review ... for now, the higher rating (this one) stands."
"Overall: I must say it is still rather refreshing for a macro on a hot summer's day."
"Cheers!"
"Forget it. I had to try it out for old times sake."
"This is a slightly above average beer and definitely beats most american macros. Bottom line is this beer always tastes A LOT better while watching hockey!!!"
"Pours a yellow pale color, some carbonation, small head, some lacing afterwards. The smell is malty, but skunky. The taste is malty, watery with a dry finish. Light body. Drinkable if given for free. I remember drinking this alot in CA, way better than Bud or Coors though."
"OK This is not my standard review. I drink on rare occasions this Macro Larger. All I can say is, it beats Budweiser and Miller for the price paid. Its a totally clear larger that is a totally clear straw colored larger with little flavor qualities. Might be good just to drink with food as a by-product. It does have a light flavor, but not very bold."
"I have to begin by saying I remember this as a different beer, a bit bolder and more flavorful that this tasting. Needless to say, my view has changed. In the macro-lager world I think Id now walk somewhere else. The head is dense and disappears quickly. Has a strong corn smell. First taste is of sharp corn/alcohol with maybe a hint of hops and malt coming in afterwards. The mouthfeel, however, is actually quite nice. The aftertaste is in the back of the mouth, mostly corn sweetness."
"The beer pours a nice golden color but there is no head or lace. The smell is dominated by corn as is the taste. This is quite overwhelming. It feels overcarbonated and watery. Overall though it is easy to drink compared to others in its style."
"poured a paule yellow color with abundant white puffy head that quickly fell. Little lacing to be found. Smell is minimal, with only a slight sweetness to be found. Taste is crisp, but very little maltiness or hops to be found. Cold and refreshing and very easy to drink. Refreshing but not much else."
"Had Labatt Blue on tap at the Cat's Eye Saloon in Athens, OH. The beer was poured into a plastic cup with very little head. It smelled a little bit skunky; some of that typical macrobrew smell. The taste is not good. Couldn't find any hops or any other good flavors. Had a slight sweetness. Overall, not a good beer for any purpose."
"This is probably the most dead average beer I've ever had. It's certainly tolerable, but also very obviously unspectacular. Color is dark enough that you probably won't mistake it for Bud or Miller, but not dark enough that you'd ever mistake it for say Pilsner Urquell. Head is a little less foamy than something like Bud, but still not very stable. Smell is of a little bit of grain with the adjunct fortunately towards the background. The hops are pretty light, but at least detectable. Taste is middle of the road too. The grain taste is there, if a little bit light with the adjunct once again just barely detectable. There is a little bit of sweetness balanced out with a little bit of bitterness. It's not a deep flavor, but its stronger than any of the ""Big 3", although rather less bitter. And its less funky than either any of them or Rolling Rock. Mouthfeel tends a bit to the light side I could do with a bit less carbonation as well. Drinkability is actually probably above average, (though certainly not a 5), but I have never happened to drink more than one of these at a time and besides which I just think 3's accross the board suit this beer very well. I might have said the same thing about Rolling Rock, but Labatt Blue is really the best macro style I've had. Though its more expensive and less widely available so its not as always around as a fallback while Rolling Rock almost always is. It doesn't do anything majorly wrong, its clean tasting and a safe bet. But it sure doesn't do anything special either. I could probably drink this all night if there was nothing special around, and still enjoy myself. And it'd definately be my choice if I happened to be hosting a bunch of people who really prefer American style Macro brews (not that I know enough people who prefer that style for me to bother). But I sure wouldn't go out of my way to get a Labatt Blue. Though when you consider this is the Canadian equivlent of either Bud or Coors, you've got to give them props for having better tase than the average American. Or the average German or Dutch for that matter (I'd also take a Labatt Blue over their best selling Heineken or Beck's any day)"
"On special, $2.50 for a 23oz , so I choose this instead of the other BMC offerings. Canadian Budweiser. Straw yellow, decent white head. No aroma. Typical adjunct *malts* dominate the quaff. Lightly carbonated. Taste has an earthy, bitter finish, but in total it was not something to turn the nose up when offered- for the *style* not bad."
"Pours out to a golden color in the glass. It appears to be slightly darker than the average beer of this style. The aroma is of a very faint malt, yet its a fresh, almost sweet smell. The taste is decent. It is somewhat grainy, with a light hop presence that your can actually taste that gives way to a very slight sweetness on the swallow. I can actually taste malt in this, albeit, not much. This is a big seller in my neck of the woods (Detroit) and outsells Bud in many stores. It is one of the cheapies (yes, it sells for less than Bud/Miller/Coors when on sale) that I will go to on occasion."
"About the same as other macro lagers IMO. Slightly hoppy and sweet, with a bit of an off taste after a second or so. Gets a lot worse after a few minutes of warming. As far as macros go, it's really not that bad, but I'd probably stick to domestic beers. There's no sense in paying extra for an import of this, it's not any better than bud or pbr IMO. Wasn't bad for a free can that was left by a friend, but not something I'd spend money on."
"Looks like an average Macro, nothing exceptional, nothing out of the ordinary. Smell is nothing to call home about, mostly made up of adjuncts, but that is typical with most Macro's. Tastes ok, wouldn't dump it out, it's not horrible but there are thousands of other more appealing offerings out there. Mouthfeel is not too bad, slightly harsh as per most Macro brews. It is drinkable to a point, after a few your stomach will start to beg for mercy, but overall this isn't an absolutely horrible brew. I'd certainly take this over the other Canadian offering in this category."
"This is the first macro brew that I have reviewed. This is a little better then some of the macro lagers that I have tasted."
"Overall, I'm giving this a 2.5 for drinkability. As macro lagers go, this is one of the best I've tried. I'm not planning on buying this again, but as a cheap drink to have at a party where there's no good stuff available, it's better than many of the alternatives."
"Not even something I'd likely drink even if there were only macros available..."
"Pours a nice healthy golden color with a razor thin head buffered by visibly heavy carbonation. Smell is grainy but not strong enough to be unpleasant. The taste is watery and nothing special but it holds onto enough bitterness to make it a good sipping beer, perfect for a Saturday afternoon of college football, or a night of hockey or baseball in front of the tube. An overabundance of carbonation makes the mouthfeel par at best. This is by no means a great beer but you can have a great time drinking it, which must be worth something"
"Not bad if I'm stuck with it, easily beats the American counterparts but it still wouldn't be a first choice."
"Taste is that of perrier and egg yolk. A previous reviewer nailed it when he said it tastes ""like water left out overnight with a corn husk soaking in it."" Mouthfeel is that of overcarbonated water. Drinkability ... I guess you could drink these like ...well, water.. if you didn't mind the taste. To me this is the Canadian equivalant to Coors."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" white head over the oh-so-clear pale straw brew. Pillowy head lasts well, and lacing is surprising nice, with heavy foam coverage. Aroma is minimal, light sweetness and hops, kind of generic ""beer"" nose. Taste is sweet pale malts upfront, balanced and then overpowered by a bitterness that seems to come from some sort of homogenized hops, no real character, and a dry close. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh, with some overcarbonation appearing on the tongue, and the bitterness leaving a bit of an aftertaste, and the better sort. Have to admit, though, if this is what you're looking for, it is somewhat drinkable."
"Taste is just one might expect in a macro produced beer like this. A grainy, sweet quality at first with rice and corn flavors at the forefront of the palate. A rather straightforward brew that has a good drinkability level. A tad watery and bland in all honesty, but it is what it is. I paid $8.99 for a 12 pack and can't complain. It's an afforable Canadian beer that might be a better option than some of the macro beers on the market."
"not much to say because there is not much to this beer, at least it is cheap and the can is pretty. i won't be buying it ever again."
"Pours a light gold with good clairty. Two fingers of head retain surprisingly well for a macro, doesn't leave any lacing though. Grain and pale malt are about the only aromas present. The taste is the same, with the addition of a semi-skunky hops that smooth mouthfeel and give it a crisp, dry finish. Light bodied, if not a little watery with even carbonation, and an almost nil aftertaste. The nice light flavor and drinkability make this one of your better macros."
"Better in the can believe it or not. I think they use glass bottles made of ass."
"Overall-this beer is underrated, yes believe it folks. While it isn't by any means close to craft beer lager Labatt Blue is among the best Macro lager buys around. Crisp, refreshing, adequetely flavored, and smooth. Does the job in a pinch at places where craft beer isn't available."
"Here in Ontario, this and Molson Canadian are what you would typically expect to see at a gathering or party. I'll even admit that before I got into craft brew, Molson was my beer of choice. Nothing really terrible with this beer, it just is what it is, which is a typical macro session brew. However, I believe there are much better macro sessions out there."
"It's another one that poured a pale yellow color with a just a small amount of foam that disappeared quickly. The only smell I could smell was that of a small amount of barley malt. It tasted like an above average macro; watered down malt. Basically, a beer that tastes a little better than the average American macro. This would make a good choice for a session beer if you can get it cheap."
"This is one of the best beers i've ever had, I can't believe some of these reviews. This is my favorite beer, this and moslon canadian. Defiently my beer of choice. Pours a nice golden colour, with a nice tall frothy head. This is a great beer hands down. I love it in a cold glass, in a can, I just love it. My absolute favorite beer, if you are looking for a great beer this is it. Two thumbs way up. This beer is definetly recommend, these reviews are messed up, this is a great beer."
"Retried this after a coworker said that he loved Canadian beer- especially Labatt's."
"Mouthfeel had a refreshing ""drink me again"" attitude. Nice all around adjunct for hot summer grilling adventures."
"Still, it's not bad, fairly crisp and refreshing, drinkable ice cold."
"Hm. Been here before: a Canadian beer that is thin and boring. Appearance is translucent gold with a snow white head of foam that leaves some lace. Aroma is composed of dextrose, barley and not much else. Initial taste has too little carbonation and is quite bland. Smooth on the tongue but lacking in both malt and hops leaving a nasty taste on the tongue like an old tea bag."
"Been drinking beer for only a few years and I have never had a beer from Canada so far. Appearance is a clear gold color with a white head. Not a whole lot of lacing. Thin malt taste, but not unpleasant. A slight amount of hops detected at finish. The Canadian macros is about the same as the American adjunct lagers."
" Can any of you Canadians tell me if it is the same exact brew as you guys get in Canada?"
"Pours a white, 5-finger-head that vanishes quickly leaving traces of lace. Clear, very pale amber color, similar to urine. Light carbonation and light bodied. Nose is faintly skunky. Starts with more malts than hops but sweetness fades to a slight hoppy finish. Slightly more flavor than Blue Light. $1.50 for a 340ml from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"A decent Canadian import. Poured out to a darker yellow color with a head that wasted no time in fizzing away. Medium carbonation. Odors of adjunts were most noted - corn, grain and hops. Taste had almost a metallic quality, like iron had been dissolved in it. Other flavors of corn and grain were present, as were hops toward the finish. Not a terrible beer, but Canada has so many other better beers. Worth a try."
"Light palate with a watery mouthfeel. Did I really used to buy this? I guess I can forgive myself, I was 17!"
"I'm pretty sure this would be a Jim Lahey type beer. If Julian and Ricky went for beer instead of rum or vodka, I'm pretty sure that they would drink O. V. (anyone remember that one? it's not in the dB) or Carling Black."
"Finishes dryer than canadian..bit more bite...not as full flavored...it is what it is...Average"
"Blah."
"This beer caused an instant gag reflex, but I got it down. It has a darker yellow colr than most macro lagers, but this is still a pathetic beer. While it has a small sweet smell, it comes across as corn beer with the minimum amount of grain used to still label it a beer. Plenty of carbonation in this beer from the north, but not much else."
"I don't think it's all that great. Maybe on tap? I dunno I will give it another chance I think. Pours piss golden, light foamy head that quickly dissipates. Smells like skunk. Tastes like a dirty macro, swilly. I'd drink it if I had some nice greasy food with it :)."
"If this beer has anything going for it, it's a decent body which lends itself to an okay drinkability rating. Otherwise avoid."
"Clear piss yellow tone. Thin off white head. Minimal lace. Aroma is of soft, sweet malts. Nice graininess in the flavor. Also some malt sweetness and noticeable hop presence (for a macro). Mouthfeel isn't nearly as fizzy as most Macros and that's a plus. Body is about medium. This is an agreeable macro brew to ingest."
"Had a pitcher of this when we first arrived in Montreal last weekend. Nothing impressive about this beer at all. Clear, light yellow appearance. Dull aroma. Dull flavor. Doesn't excite the palate or even taste smooth for that matter. You could drink a lot of this if you wanted to...if you're in the ""I'm at a crappy frat party and I want to get wasted and hit on ugly chicks"" mentality."
"Drinkability: I always try to avoid Blue. I rather go with Bud before Blue. Also, Blue is very risky for hangover."
"Conclusion: This beer is a ripoff and couldn't be more overrated. Screw Labatt and it all stands for."
"Blue is one of those beers in which you could pound back a few and not have to worry, yet it becomes too overpowering to many is drank in too large of quantities. Lets hope this review helps you in your decision. Cheers."
"I imagine that calling Blue an *American* macro lager pisses off those from the Great White North who can be bothered to be protective about a macro. I would never buy it by the sixer, but as a poundable, 'don't wanna think about it' kind of beer, this stuff ain't bad. It has no real negatives, unless one considers a lack of positives to be a negative."
"I know I didnt give this high ratings at all, but its one of my highest ranked adjuncts (the bastardization of beer)."
"Really not a horrible beer for as much crap as some people give it. I'd drink it any day over Bud/Miller/Coors. While not a good beer, its different from other macro crap. Has much more of a hoppier, crisper euro-lager feel to it than BMC swill. Definitely still some corn, etc present but nowhere near as bad as a lot of stuff out there. If you live up north, in VT for instance, it is often also cheap as dirt. I've seen it as low as $2.50 for a 6 pack. Can't argue with that if you're faced with a swill situation."
"Overall impression: Drinkable - not a bad barbecue beer, but doesn't stand out amongst the other macros. I'd rather have a High Life."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy enough, probably because the bottles were 11.2 oz. I purchased a 12-pack of this with a 12 of Moosehead, which cost a dollar less, but in reality I only got about an 11 pack of 12 fl oz bottles. Felt a little cheated."
"Well, not much to say about this one really. Pours a medium golden yellow with a thin head. Nose is very faint, nothing really distinguishable, just a vague and general ""beer"" scent to it. Taste is very much the same, not a lot to it, but isn't offensive in any way, so it makes a good session beer and isn't something you really think about too much, just a run of the mill macro style lager. Unlike many other macros though, at least this is palatable. This one is very common in my part of the country and tends to be the only real option in standard bars with all macro stuff on tap."
"This is a fairly standard Canadian lager. It's very common in southeastern Michigan and usually the best option to order when you're in a ""small town"" bar. I find it to be rather refreshing all year round and very drinkable. I've drank a lot of it in both the U.S. and Canada (it's different). Well balanced malt and hops. Has almost a creamy mouthfeel. All this being said, I can't say there is anything distinguishable or special about this beer -- just a standard lager."
"Pours a medium straw color, small white fizzy head. SMell is mostly of adjunct grains, although unskunked, still not very impressive. Taste is relatively devoid of malt or hops, just watery graininess, no better or worse than any of Americas macro lagers. What's the reason for paying more for this stuff again?"
"Pale straw color. Minimal head retention. It has a pale malt mash smell to it, but, a bit sewery and sulfury. Hop aroma is a mild skunkiness. I'm not really sure why I'm even reviewing this. Cooked corn is a taste in it's malt profile. Crisp in its mouthfeel because it's very carbonated; too burpy. Light astringency in the finish. Boring and mildly offensive for a pale lager."
"But it doesn't make me choke, or vomit from taste (as opposed to sustained imbibing). It retains...1/20 of a head, which is better than some. And it's smooth, somewhat, in a depressing way similar to its doormat of a texture (which is just think enough to remind you this is beer, but not enough to make you taste too much). Sorry to be so negative, because I really do enjoy this beer for drinking games. But I think it's a total failure for really tasting, as opposed to swigging from a bottle or chugging whole."
"This isn't so bad for the style. The taste is crisp, grainy, and clear. This a little fuller in flavor than expected too. Aroma and appearance are about average for an adjunct lager. I'd recommend this over the Big 3 any day. This isn't a great beer, but if you're gonna have a simple, mainstream lager you can do far worse than Labatt Blue."
"Football beer. Pale yellow color, thin head, thinner body, no smell to me, OK taste. Really faint malty taste. Sampled this straight from the 5000 cu. ft refrigerator (garage) at about 50°. Better than any of the big three IMO. My choice for Sunday swilling."
"It's your basic macrobrew. The smell and taste is very similar to Budweiser- thin and corny with lots of carbonation. The finish is a little bit more malty than Budweiser and the smell isn't quite as strong (a good thing, considering Budweiser's less-than-pleasant aroma). It's not awful as far as adjunct lagers go, but a 6-pack of Labatt Blues costs about the same as a 6-pack of Samuel Adams Boston Lager at most of the places I shop. I'll take Samuel Adams over Labatt Blue any day of the week."
"Looks and tastes like an ""adjunct lager"" should - yellowish color, bubbly foam that quickly disappears. Aroma not bad, but not good either - grainy smell. Bubbly throughout which gives it a light crisp mouthfeel. Clean finish, no after taste. Easy to drink, generic canadian beer. Personally, I prefer it over Molson's."
"Palate is typical standard pale adjunct lager. Sweetish, corny, clean, with very modest hop bitterness. Theres more malt taste and more hop presence than in most BMC adjunct lagers, but not much more. Mouthfeel is fizzy, and light bodied. Not good, but not bad. I must admit I have a nostalgic affection for this blue Canadian brew. Takes me back to my pre-21 days when my friends and I would go up to Ontario and drink cases of this at Chads cabin. Walleyes, bonfires, logging road four-wheeling, splitting wood, busting beaver dams, wrestling bears, and Labatt Blue: good times. Gets a 5 for nostalgia."
"Didnt want another one, will only drink when I can choose between this and another poor macro."
"Taste was clean, corn, light malt, no hops. Very bland. However, I have having korean bbq and taking in tonnes of MSG, so this beer was quite welcome. Goes down great with grub. Otherwise, just another crappy lager for the masses."
"Nice and refreshing for an adjunct lager. Reminds me of the high school days with a friend that stocked this stuff in the garage fridge. Nothing too special to speak of but I will order this every time over Miller, Coors, or Bud Light. Plus, it's pretty cheap at the new place around the corner."
"Appears more like a sparkling cider or juice than a beer. Very clear, light, and bubbly. Smells like a macro; pretty bland, not a lot going on. Maybe even a little funky smell to it. It actually tastes passable for a macro. It's pretty watery overall but I can surprisingly pick up on a bit of sweet maltiness. That's it though. This is basically a boring beer, but it could be worse in the world of macro brews."
"Bender Factor: Blue light is a better alternative, Molson Canadian is the best choice. Everyone here in Buffalo thinks that Blue is the the sheezy, I say it makes me queasy. Labatt Blue is a sad excuse for a beer. It should be put out of it's misery. I feel bad for Canadian citizens who are exposed to Blue on a daily basis."
"This beer pours a very pale unimpressive urine like color with a thin head. smell was well... like... beer. very ordinary. taste was the same. mouthfeel was thin and watery. i wouldnt go out of my way to get one but, it isnt bad when nuthin else is availible. they are easy to drink."
"Reviewed as a adjunct lager. Poured a nice straw color with a crisp white head that faded quickly. A bit of lace, not much though. Smells of sweet malt with corn and rice. No noticable hop presence. Taste is about the same except the hops are a bit more noticeable. Its is crisp and dry and you can drink abunch of these. Its an average adjunct lager and still better than Bud etc. I remember these tasting much better when I was younger. I grew up in Buffalo and the big three beers there are Genesee, Molson and this, I grew up on this stuff and I just remember it tasting better then than it does now. Overall its a poor beer, but as an adjuct its average."
"Clear gold with a white head. Bread like yeasty smell, followed by a clean flavor with a little yeast flavor, not malty, or hoppy. Bit of a corn like after taste. Thin and dry on the mouthfeel. When I was younger Canadian beers enjoyed a good reputation for quality. Today the quality of their ads is great but the beer is just so-so. A descent beer, Id chose this over a Bud or High Life if those were my only choices."
"The beer after its release from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a luminous gold color with a moderate sized bright white head that is soapy in texture, the residual lace a thin but concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is malt dominated, crisp and fresh, start is somewhat sweet and it has a fair malt profile, the top light in feel. Finish is determined in its acidity, the hops standard in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, what can you say its drinkable and there are certainly many worse beers on the market."
"The beer pours a clean, clear straw color - initially the head is big and heavy with carbonation, but manages to die down in seconds. The aroma - as well as the taste of this beer - is adjunct heavy. More corn can be tasted than malts or hops. Overall, this is a very sad, entirely uneventful beer, akin to alcoholic seltzer water. Skip this one at all costs."
"I did not pour this golden colored brew. Smell was a bit bready. The aftertaste was kind of funky, almost a hint of rubbing alcohol. Mouthfeel was very thin as is typical with macro's. Drinkability is fine for soothing my bad swings on the course. I have seen this brew at the grocery store many a time but will definitely not buy into the urge to pick some of this up."
"Pours a light gold, lighter than straw. Decent head lasted about 5 minutes. No side cling, tons of carbonation. Has a malty and corn sweet aroma with a hint of skunk. Starts sort of light, then sweetens with corn flavor, becoming a bit fuller and finishing with a bit of sour skunkiness toward the back of the palate. Aftertasted doesn't stick around too long fortnuately."
"This is drinkable in a cold beer on a hot day kind of way. Drink it ice cold, there's nothing to gain by letting it warm up. This is better than most US macros, but that's like saying Jeffrey Dahmer was better than Jack the Ripper. Kokanee will remain my go-to cheap pale lager. It's nothing to fear from this."
"it is a bland super pale straw color with lots of tiny bubbles. The head was awol, and lacing was also nonexistent. The smell was of cooked vegetables and corn and chemicals. The taste was of corn and water, hello hops? are you there? *no*. It was cold so in a sense I guess you could say it is refreshing, like water is. This beer is awful and Im convinced people only buy it because of the slick multi-million dollar ads."
"This was a good session beer with Cajun foods. It did not wrestle with the food for flavor or aroma. It is better than a glass of water or a Coors LIght."
"A very pale straw colour, but had a nice foamy white head on the pour, not bad for a macro. Aroma contains sharp grain and the presence of adjuncts. The flavour has a bit of an industrial chemical presence, dry metallic grains, with a sweet twang of adjuncts on the finish, giving it a bit more of an industrial flavour on the aftertaste. Very watery mouthfeel, but a bit abrasive on the palate as well. This would be the lowest on the Canadian macro totem pole for me, in the great white north triumvirate of Molson/ Labatt/Kokanee (in comparison to the American BMC)."
"Taste: Again, hmmm. It's Labatt's. Light mouthfeel, frolicy carbonation, somewhat bitter aftertaste. I think there's more hop feel in this than in others. Yucky macro pucker. Easy to drink though. I usually just laugh when I hear my run of the mill college friends argue about how Labatt's is so much better than say, Bud. I think any difference I ever thoguht was there has left, and the macros are just rolling into one collective swill. Whatever. Not horrible. I'll drink it any time. Just not if it's my choice as to what we're drinking."
"Easy to drink beer. Better than Bud in my opinion. Flavor is lacking."
"This beer pours a dark yellow color with a small head and leaves little to no lacing on the glass. Had it on tap at the local pub. The aroma is plain - a little sweet. Very much a mass produced beer. The taste was much the same, somewhat bland without a ton of flavor, but a little sweet. Typical Canadian mass-produced beer."
"Labatt Blue pours a corn colored yellow. (Darker than most macros) The head was very foamy at first and shrunk to about 1/4 inch. Lacing on the glass was minimul. Smell is very sweet and grainy, almost popcorn smelling. Taste is very light but good, sweetness with a good blend of hops. Feels crisp and refreshing in the mouth. Drinkable in the summer months, still a couple of better macros out there for a cheaper price."
"This is a decent beer. I'm usually not crazy about Canadian beer due primarily to the fact that its from Canada. And I really do not like Canada all that much. Either way, it tastes pretty good. But nothing I would buy again, between it and Molson I would definitely take Molson. I think the best part about Labatt Blue is its commercials with the bear. He's so cute."
"I like it."
"Passable brew beats the American macrobrews."
"This beer, although straight macro, is actually not an entirely bad choice if youre strapped for cash and are in desperate for something alcoholic to pour down your throat. It pours a heavily carbonated light yellow, with the typical big bubble head. Smell is mostly just the malts, no hops really. Taste is wheaty, but it tastes more like a wheat cracker than a malt wheatiness, with the slightest taste of hops. Mouthfeel is heavily carbonated, and watery. Pretty typical macro-brew, and I might go so far as to reccomend for those on a really tight budget. There are better choices though, and for not that much more out of pocket."
"Drinkablility: Fairly drinkable. Better than BUDMILLERCOORS but barely."
"This beer taste much better on tap than in a bottle or a can. I know most beers do but you could really tell. The beer has some malty aromas. Taste wise i liked it, it had some maltness to it but not to much bitterness. Just some regular brew that you wouldnt pick if you were out in a nice restaurant but that you could buy by the case for a partty."
"Well, I can't totally write Labatt Blue off but I'm pretty sure I can find other pale lagers sporting more aroma and taste. Pretty bland, pretty boring, and pretty sure I won't get this beer again real soon."
"Drinkability - I like it. Not one I'd buy off the shelf to stock at home, but I have it on tap in the summer/fall now and then. A fine session beer if you like a pilsner style for the evening and you're at a macros-only joint."
"A less than adequate beer. Pours a true gold color, head is mild. Smell is of nothing, or sometimes of faintly skunked beer. Has a little more flavor than most big names, some hoppyness and some bitter, but nothing exciting or even interesting. Quite drinkable, because of the lack of flavor. One of my favorite macro lagers, though that isn't saying much at all."
"Char"
"Appearance of this beer was ... let me see oh yeah yellow fizzie beer. There was a very light grassy smell that dissappeared almost as fast as the head. I got a slight flavor of grain at the begining and then water flavor. Which is to say no flavor at all ( not a bad flavor just NO flavor) after the first mouthfull. It was as if after the first mouthfull it ceased being beer and became colored water with alcohol in it. I gave it the low taste rating based on no taste as opposed to awfull. The drinkability a bit higher because I guess you could swill down a bunch of this easily."
"Kabatt blue is an old friend of mine and everyone else from the area. It pours a clear yellow with a small, quickly diminishing head. The aroma has no hints of anything except slight skunk. Not even much of theis. The taste is grainy and kind of sweet with a slight bitter hop aftertaste. It did go down pretty good, but I'm going to have to say goodbey to this old friend. Like an old pair of shoes, I have outgrown you."
"On tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a medium gold color with one finger of head. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell has just a little bit of maltiness and grassy hops, but is very faint. The taste is fairly light as well, but it tastes very very much like rice. I'm not ever sure if they use rice as an adjunct, but it sure tastes like rice. There is just a faint bit of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is a little light and watery. The drinkability is at least fair. There are many pale lagers that can top this one."
"The only good thing about this beer is its smoothness. This is a beer that one could ""throw back"" and enjoy."
"I'll take Labatt over American macros, but that's certainly not saying much."
"Poured from a 11.5 Fl Oz bottle. Hum, couldn't even make it a full 12 oz."
"Plain and simple to me Labatts on a scale from one to ten is a 5. There is much better out there for the price, but there is a lot worse also. Their light beer is not bad and I rate that a 5 out of 10 as well. I found Labatts to be best when it is Draft or when it is out of the bottle."
"Bottle - Standard macro brew with no real head retention or any aftertaste. Aroma is almost non-existent. Body is really light to ensure you can drink a lot of this crap brew, not that you would want to. Not much else to say except I won't be seeking this anytime soon."
"This is noteably different in Canadian cans, as compared to US bottles. The appearance takes a hit, for I am drinking this straight from the can. The aromas are subdued, and a bit more ""grainy"" than in tap Labatt. The taste is similar to the tap and bottled versions of this brew, and it is surely a very easy drinking lager. I wish that they would throw some more hops in here or something to give it a bit more ""oomph"". The mouthfeel is thinner and more watery in the can than in the bottle, and the drinkability suffers a bit as well."
"The beer pours a very light golden golden with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is terrible. It is weak and watery. It has breadlike qualities and seems a bit musty. The taste is watery and simplistic. It has little malt complexity and flavor. The mouthfeel is perfect. It has a bunch of carbonation. This is a very low bodied beer. It is very drinkable despite all it's shortcomings. This was my first favorite beer. I drank more than my fair share of this beer in my late teens and early twenties."
"If I were a Canadian eager to prove my country is not ""the 51st State," I'd be ashamed to see the maple leaf on this product. It's just all the worst aspects of the standard American ""beer."" Pale, pale colour--but that is what the style calls for, so a few points there. Plenty of adjunct to assure as little actual flavour as possible. Unless the malt and hops are so well balanced they cancel each other out, like matter and antimatter... nah. The company claims this beer has a ""fruity character;"" since when are corn and rice fruit?"
"My wife really likes this beer, and every so often I get hankering for it myself. It's a nice beer to drink if you want something that you don't have to think about much. Kinda lika an old pal, it'll just come on over and watch a little TV or play some dominoes with you. It's actually a blessing to have friends like that."
"Labatt should be called LaBlah!"
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 21SEP03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"Non-distinctive. There are better. Not recommended."
"It beats drinking Miller. Sorta. I guess."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a straw yellow, with a moderate head that didn't last long, and no visible lacing. Aroma is slightly hoppy, with maybe a hint of grain, but that is about all. The taste is that of most macros watery, weak, and bland. This is an easy drinking beer because there isn't much flavor to get in the way."
"Labatt Blue has some corn and fruity flavors, and I think it is somewhat of a hybrid of soda and beer. Goes down really well at a sporting event or a barbeque or something, but nothing too memorable. The price of this stuff is the only reason I buy it every once in awhile."
"Poured pale gold with a short lived foamy white head. Slight hop aroma with some corn. OK mouthful with medium carbonation. Taste was typical mass produced macro style, with no off flavors, unless you consider corn off. Not much else to say about this one. Inoffensive and refreshing enough to satisfy thirst at a summer bbq, but not something I'd pay for."
"Light gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and very sweetish. A light bodied, light tasting pilsner. Not very hoppy, some citrus. Mouthfeel is slightly hoppy. Crisp and refreshing. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Average beer. Not skunky."
"This beer takes me right back to high school. I grew up in Michigan, and this stuff showed up at alot of ""events"" The drinking age was 18 at the time by the way. Uninspiring in color-watery looking pale golden-almost a shade of yellow. aromas include corn and more filler type aromas. The mouthfeel is ultra carbonated and sodapop-ish. The taste is almost of nothing with a hint of beer flavor. I could probably stomach more than one of these at a baseball game, but I'd need a hot dog to give the beer a reason to exist-I guess it would wash down a dog ok. Other than that, don't waste your money on this stuff."
"Mouthfeel is ok, beer is slightly harsh as if it wasn’t aged long enough. Drinkabillity is just ok. Not my favorite Labatt’s product. Well, at least the fishing was good!"
"Umm, not good. Not bad, but definitely not good. I got a large, 30 oz can from a neighbour who claimed to have too many Blue. This poured a grainy, lemon colour with a head that was too large. Hell, it was half the glass, and it took 5 minutes too settle down. Poured again, this time much slower, and the head still rose. Since this is a huge can, I spilled a bit of the head to try and get more actual beer. Smelled of lemon, corn, malt, corn, hops, corn, sweet corn, corn and corn. Tasted very citrusy. Not much difference from the bottle version, if I remember correctly. Fizzy mouthfeel. Below average beer, good for the masses."
"A crystal clear golden body rests below a short, creamy, bright white head. The retention is limited, and it shortly drops to a thin surface covering; although it does leave some thin streaks and spotty lace. The nose offers a twist on the generic beer aroma with the addition of some mild, hay-like graininess; a touch of fruitiness; and some very ""background"" hops. The body is light/medium ; and its crisp in the mouth with a vibrant carbonation. The flavor delivers a thin, sweetish, obviously adjunct-laden (there's no real grain flavor present) malt that's balanced by a firm bitterness. It finishes clean and dry with little residual aftertaste. It's not a bad mass-produced lager by any means. In fact, it's probably one of the better ones. But the slightly elevated hop bitterness leaves me wanting more, and it's just not there. No real hop aroma, no hop flavor, no real graininess. Crisp and well-balanced, but lacking in character."
"This heres yer draught beer in Canada eh?"
"I remember when I drank this and thought that I was better than the budweiser people because I was drinking such a higher quality beer. Ah, memories. This really is not that good, but not bad either. Very light. Piss colored with no head. Which makes me never want to pour it into a glass again. It's not like I am getting more flavor eitherways. Might as well just drink it from a bottle. Adjunct flavors are very noticeable with a slight amount of dextrin sweetness. Too expensive to buy."
"Buffalo is a drinking town, and this is our beer. It will never cause anyone to wax poetic over its virtues, but it could be much, much worse."
"Body is water-like. Very little lace on the glass. Gets worse in taste as it warms, as the adjuncts come out in force. My advice is unless you want to swill down beer like no tomorrow, and could care less about taste and body, go for it. And I always advise going with ANYTHING that is not made by A-B, so again, go for it. Personally, I would look for a micro - ANY micro - before drinking any macro beer ever again."
"Pours a very pale color with light carbonation. Very sweet corn syrup smell with a slight hint of grain and hop. A very light tasting beer, with somewhat decent flavor, fairly sweet and lightly bitter. Overall its an easy to drink beer thats refreshing, but nothing id go out of my way to buy, definately not something i would drink if i wanted flavor."
"Not a very drinkable lager..maybe if im trapped in a snowed in cabin in the Yukon with a case of this i might try it again."
"This is a clean beer, but not as clean as its main competitor Molson Canadian. The smell isn't the best, and the adjuncts are much more noticeable than Molson. I recommend this as a swillin' beer and nothing else."
"Definitely a party beer at best."
"Blue is siginificantly better on tap. It goes from one of the most overrated beers to one that is not all that bad. Not to say its transformed to a 'good' beer; it is meerly better. Appearance and smell is much the same except it has a slightly more 'yeasty' smell to it. The taste is also more yeasty, therefore somewhat more interesting. This really improves its drinkability. I threw back quite a few without problems or shame."
"Pale golden yellow color with a little white head. Nothing very noticable or exciting in the aroma. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the flavor as I was expecting it to be even more watery than it was. This beer is nothing special, but for an American/Canadian Lager it is pretty good. I had no problem downing many the night I had it, of course that could be because I had just completed my first successful black bear hunt and was celebrating."
"All around this is slightly less than average beer. Mostly like an average macro lager it has more graininess and body than some. The light gold or yellow appearance is matched to a quickly dissipated white head. Watery mouthfeel and standard carbonation add little to the overall sense of enjoyment. Lots better than Bud, but that's not saying much positive."
"Medium faded yellow color. Thin white bubbly head. Smells were mostly of slightly roasted corn, aluminium shavings and sour beer. Watery sweetness dominates the taste. Corn water finishes the feel. A faint hop presence as it finishes. Watery and harsh to get down. Flavors got rougher after it warmed a bit. A decent ballpark beer, but I switched to water after 2. Stay hydrated, that's the key."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Taste: light, watery. What taste there is was sweet, no hops bite to speak of. Unless you're buying 'em I'll pass."
"Not a good beer. I can't think of anything good to say except that its not horrible. Its what you drink if you know the bar hasn't had an order other than Bud or Bud light in a few years. I keep hearing about it being better in Canada...sorry. Its still garbage. Living in Detroit, I spend too much time visiting our neighbor to the south (Windsor), and I can say its no better on either side of the bridge. I actually think Blue light is better, at least you can pound it faster to get it over with."
"Sickly pale gold hue, translucent, brilliant white head that reached ¾ of a finger before it dissipated rather quickly. No lace of note. Uninviting nose, funky sweet (adjunct contamination), putrid like old gym socks, underlying grainy-husk. An uninspiring drink, watery, vaguely sweet no malt character, adjuncts for sure, no hops either, grainy. Thin, slightly prickly (maybe more accurately  harsh) mouthfeel. Id be hard pressed to say this beer is any better that an American macro. While I once thought of Labatt Blue as premium and exotic I now realize that it is swill."
"The beer is a reasonable change from heavier and maltier ales when you are looking for a thirst quenching beer on a hot summer day."
"Light golden in color with no head or lace when it was brought to my table. Typical ""beer"" smell with a little hop nose. Not a bad tasting beer, just not much to it. Tastes like a slighlty above average macro. Thin mouthfeel, medium carbonation, watery taste. It cooled down my mouth after an order of Buffalo shrimp but left me wishing I had ordered carry-out and eaten this at home with a real beer."
"Better than Budweiser, IMO. This beer would not offend a soul and because of the light carbonation would make for very easy drinking."
"Things that come to mind: the bear singing with the Japanese Men. ""no you didn't, no you didn't..""". Aside from a good marketing plan,  pours a light color with a thin head. No taste, just carbonation. Not even a hint of hops. I thought I tasted something, but that jingle came to mind, ""no you didn't, no you didn't.."""."
"Please do not confuse the Canadian Blue with its exported counterpart. Yes, taste is similar, but the original is full bodied with a slight after taste and not as sweet...and a tad lighter in colour."
"Pours a light yellow color with a temporary white head.  Bland adjunct flavor, no real hop or much malt flavor.  This beer was a gift from my stepfather who went fishing in Canada."
"Medium-light color, fizzy. A fresh hop/skunk nose that indicates good intentions. Unfortunately the palate doesn't deliver as it is watery with barely integrated sweet malt and hop bitterness. These two simple elements occur across a vast, yawning gap of flavor. A beer-flavored lake. No flaws but nothing special either. Don't waste your time."
"Starts off pale yellow in color with a very nice soft pillow-top head. Laces very well with thick sticky rings.Smells and taste is almost Bud-like.Smell is malty, almost skunkfully. The beer itself well balanced, malty hop aftertaste. A good drink with a meal."
"Very light in texture and flavour, slightly sweet, short finish, very watery, and slightly chemically finish, its obvious that they use the cheapest ingredients possible, not good at all."
"This is an average beer.  The clear golden color is hard to give anything but a 3 for.  The aroma was very faint hops.  The flavor was more of the same.  The high carbonation, but watery thin flavor deserved an average mouthfeel.  I gave it above average drinkability however as it is one of those beers you can throw back and not notice you are drinking beer (ie. macro lager).  Not one I would seek out again, but not bad."
"I had this beer at a recent summer party.  Not much aroma.  The taste was mildly sweet and grassy.  Very little hops; watery mouthfeel.  Unfortunately, theres not much to add.  Ordinary."
"Borderline bad, not something I'd want to have to drink that often either even if it was handed to me at a party. A run of the mill cheap American Lager with a funny smell and a bland taste. There are so many other beers, even macro beers, that are better than this."
"Crystal clear golden hue, topped by a head with better than average retention for a high adjunct brew.  Sparse lace is left.  Clean, mild corn sweetness, light DMS and hay - like grain.  Typical macro aroma.  This brew is soft all around with a bland, but innocuous grainy malt profile coupled with a very light hop bitterness.  Corn flavors are surpsingly subdued. Nothing stands out whatsoever, and hop flavor is absent.  Finishes clean and watery. There's nothing memorable about Labatt Blue whatsoever, but it seems less offputting when compared to many American macros."
"hey this is great beer! my friend tells me. then again, his favorite is Bass ale. well, i gave it a shot. not surprisingly, it sucked. tried it later on draught, and it was still no good. light and mediocre"
"A big fat can...very pale yellow, clear...large fluffy head that's just a touch longer lasting than a Miller High Life.  Restrained hoppish aroma, tad of macro sharpness.  Quite a bit of neutral malty sweetness, hops contribute to finish.  Not quite the weird aftertaste of many macros.  Ordinary in many respects, but I appreciated a restrained carbonation.  Where's the lawn mower?"
"About the only lighter beer I can enjoy. It is a beer you don't have to think about too much as you drink it. A small step up for the typical A-B crowd."
"Right now I am chilling down the last beer to see if I can get that wow taste back..."
"This beer has the typical color of most of the macrobrews.  Nothing special about it, but it does drink fairly decently which gives it points over alot of its American counterparts."
"LaBatt Blue:  In the 24 Ounce Big Blue can.  Pale golden beer, with a big here today/ gone today head.  Unpleasant chemical aroma.  Hey, the taste ain’t bad at all, not at all.  It has a typical Canadian taste, but a nice balance of sweet malt and bitter hops, without a lot of carbonation to get in the way.  For a macro-lager, I think it’s giving my PBR a run for its money"
"Typical of a Canadian export.  Clean, crispt and simple.  Light amber in color with a nice head. Nice blend of hops and malt, but slightly fizzy and  bitter (but in a good way).  Very drinkable."
"Just a poor poor beer. The smell is awful and strong. Ultra-thin. Aftertase like you were sucking on a battery."
"My first experience with Labatt Blue was quite a forgettable one. I suppose we got a skunky batch, because the smell was absolutely horrific; it was similar to that of rotten pork. It was indescribable. Since then, I have had a few more of these (in bottled form), and they are at the very least drinkable. The smell also was not there later on, but still nothing great. A little too pricey considering it really isn't much better than the cheaper beers out there."
"But if swill is your thing, here you go..better than alot of it's peers."
"well the previous reviews were all over the board for this one.....pours straw yellow with a nice little head that sticks around.  smells of adjuncts...but the medium body and smooth and creamy mouthfeel make up for that.  all around a nice tasting lager/pilsener, sort of reminds me of High Life a little bit.  definitely better than most macros within it's style."
"Canada's version of Bud."
"Notes: Water anyone? For those of you that appreciate hardly any flavour, body, aroma or beers that you can suck down just like water ... here you go! Seriously, this beer is a great alternative to BudMillerCoors anyday. Not as clean as these other big boys, but it's different. So, if those are the sort of beers that you are into, why not make a switch to Labatt Blue for a change."
"Lots of body.  Malt is slightly sweet and hops are mild and good enough to get the job done.  Not an outstanding beer, but easy to drink and pleasant."
