"A very crisp, light beer. I'm guessing all the bad reviews are from people who want a bold, slap-in-the-face taste to their beer. Sometimes you drink beer just to get a buzz. If that's what you're after, you could do way worse than rolling rock. I would rank beers like bud light, Coors light, michelob light, nattie light, etc below rolling rock."
"Not the worst beer i ever had, there are WAY worse. But really nothing special, it smells like glass, which is weird because on the bottle it states that it comes from ""the glass lined tanks of old Latrobe"" - the power of suggestion perhaps? Overall, i like it but certainly do not love it"
""

"A most forgettable ale. Where's the flavor and feel? There is so little depth and character that it's difficult to see why this beer is still made.  One is better off with a Budweiser or a nice glass of ice water. Well, my wife goes for this...and I use to settle for this a few decades ago, but I see little reason to go for this beer if other macro American adjuncts are available..."
"just checking off crappy beers i drank in the past!"

"watery. skunky. cheap. looks like a little yellow food coloring added to seltzer water."
"Nice light pale air beer"
"There's really nothing good nor bad about the beer except for the price, which, IMO, makes it one of the best beers for the buck you can get.  It's nothing fancy, has no good taste nor bad, no good smell nor bad, and gives you a decent buzz which doesn't hang around with any nasty headaches.  So when I can get an 18 pack for 12 bucks it's hard to find a reason not to when funds are tight.  It's no Aventinus, but I can get 2.5 bottles of Aventinus for the price of an 18 pack of Rolling Rock.  One is an everyday drinker, the other is a weekend brew.  Both have merit."
"Great beer gets you hammered quick!"
"Really?  Okay. This beer has less flavor than any other beer I've ever had.  Is that justification enough?  SMH."
"This ... was not great. We tasted this beer based on a listener's recommendation."
""
"What happened? This used to be a great summertime party beer. Now it is just lackluster at best."
""
""
"I absolutely hate this beer. It is the wist of the worst cheap beers"
""
"Tastes of sweet corn and grain. Not much else to say."
""
""
"Very light in color, same for smell. Flavor is on the light side also. Not much to rave about, but not much to complain about either. Low on the ABV, light and dry on the after taste, means it's head and shoulders above most AALs. Very kind to all the senses. Goes down easier than lemonade, this is a great summer heat slammer."
"One of the worst beers I've ever had."
""
"Something about the green bottle. If you buy, do not let it sit around long. Flavor changes drastically from bottle to bottle if you let it stay in the fridge for any extended time."
"This beer is an everyday drinking kinda beer. Drink em like pops."
""
""
""
"I bought a six-pack of Rolling Rock last night (Valentine's Day), partly for nostalgic reasons, and also because I just haven't had this in a long, long time.  in fact, as soon as I opened the bottle and began to pour it, I noticed that it differed from what I remembered from about twenty years ago.  It's a very light, pale straw color, watery, with heavy carbonation, almost like seltzer water.  The taste is actually blander than I remember too, but I do like the dry aftertaste.  It's not an awful beer, but definitely nothing stellar.  I miss what it used to be, but then again, maybe my memory has shifted toward the optimistic spectrum, given my youthful appreciation of the brew.  And also, my Grandpa loved this stuff when it was brewed in PA.  All in all, an average AAL in every sense.  Definitely better than Bud, MGD, etc."
"Tasted very similar to any other macrolager. Grassy, grainy, watery...not much flavor here. 1.75/5"
"i have to write this..."

"Blast from the past and really smooth and easy going down."
""
"i don't care about the head or any foam, I go strictly by the buzz and taste! It sets very well the next  morning and the taste is very pleasant, IMHO! As far as color goes I don't like pale beers and prefer mahogany colored beer, to me it taste better than bud light, i do get a corn taste(for those who like the taste of corn try Busch) and something i can't quite put my finger on! I get no nasty after taste like i do on other brands, it does have a dry finish to me. For the price and the way it sets on you the next day, I would recommend it to friends, that being said, there will be those who don't like it! Am I a beer expert , not by any means but I know what I like and my taste goes from IPA to this, give it a chance I think you will like it!"
"Great beer if you want to change it up. I usually drink heavy craft beer. But Rolling Rock was a surprisingly okay beer."
"This is my favorite of the light beers.  Granted it is a bit on the light side, and is similar to Coors and Bud but it is an easy drinker for those who do not like the more hearty of beers."
"Light & refreshing with little flavor."
"You can buy a 30 pack of this beer for $13.99 where I live, not bad at all for the price."
""
""
""
"Colored water, horrible. Wanted to a accurate list of beers I've had. That the only reason I reviewed this one"
""
""
"Dry and grainy, like the bottle tho"
"Easy to drink. Tastes light. Not very filling."
""
"Very smooth, like any premium beer"
""
"Who in the world drinks this?"
""
""
""
""
"Had in bottle at a wedding in September, sorry for the late review. In a nutshell, I didn't like it all. Give me a Bud Light, PBR, Old Milwaukee, Miller High Life, or just about any other AAL over this. Just did not do it for me at all. Won't choose to have another one."
""
""
"Overall this seems a reasonably good beer for what it is intended to be, light, refreshing and without any strong flavors.  Also it seems to me it is better than I remember some of its competitors being."
"Easy to drink 10-12 of them and wake up no worse-for-the-wear"
"Tastes like creamed corn. Yuck."
""
"Great beer for when you have no money and are depressed about your life. Sad but true..."
""
""

"I don't grab a 'rock I'm looking to build a memorable craft beer experience, I grab one when I want a casual adult bubbly beverage.  I'm honestly not even sure if it's possible got get drunk drinking these, much less have a night that ruins my next morning."
"So overall would I recommend it ? Depends on the price. If you find it on special, ok you can give it a try or else not worth it."

"I've drunk enough of this stuff to know it is a truly nothing beer. It's not BAD, but it's not very good. A regional adjunct lager that just won't die. I guess there are some die-hards out there that look at Rolling Rock as their go-to brew, but I have precious little respect for this line. ""From the glass-lined tanks of Old Latrobe," sounds like a pitch for a 1930's B-movie."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's pale, light, and refreshing. Nothing worth snobbery, but nothing I'm gonna turn my nose up at, either. It's not Schlitz, after all."

"one of the better schwag beers, at least it was until it went corporate. not its adjuncty and lazy like the rest of them. it is a lot better than a coors or a bud light though, with some actual flavor in here, aside from the weird fermentables they react this with. its definitely thin though, watery in feel even though its carbonated like a soda. hops seem false too, i have to look for them, and when i find them, they are fakey and forced. malt base is super light, corny but not sweet, which is its real redeeming value. its also real drinkable being so light, and has something above the others like it, in that its still beer. sweetness lingers, but it stays super chuggable. in a situation where there is no good beer, i would drink this. if this wasnt present and it was bud or miller, i would chose not to drink at all. i guess thats about all i can say for this. i also grew up on it, which helps for nostalgic reasons, but nothing more than college swill here. its gone downhill..."
""
""
""
"Overall, an average beer that I will not be rushing out to get more of.  I am glad I gave it a try but I am not real impressed.  It kind of led me on a little with the extra pale written on the bottle but to me there was nothing extra or pale about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good memories of this one. Still love the bottle, which is irrelevant. Can be refreshing on a hot summer day, but so can pretty much any cold beverage. Let's be honest: this stuff is crap, but if I was faced with a macro only selection, I'd pick this one."
""
"It's a light, easy to drink lager that has virtually no flavor. This isn't actively horrible, but it's really not worth seeking out and I'd hesitate to say it's any better than the main American macro lagers."

""
"This isn't good, but it is drinkable. Very light bodied, crisp carbonation. Corn meal and a little metallic taste. Alcohol and hops not really noticeable. Not impressed."
""
""
"So I'll start with the price, great value. Very great. But I thing I have noticed is that sometimes the beer is inconsistent.  One case will taste great, it will be very light and taste like corn lol and other times it will taste like stale Heineken Light. But it is a smooth beer with a sweet corn taste and worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"If you like college beer (Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light) and want a slight change in flavor, this is a good choice for you. If you are a beer snob, I'm sure you'll hate it."

"Had some Rolling Rock for the first time in quite sometime yesterday on the golf course.  It was a warmer day and the beer tasted good to me.  If this was middle of winter I might rate lower....but it hit the spot.  Just drink it when it is warm outside."

"Overall - Rolling Rock is a tasty treat at a perfect price. And dude, most places sell this for less than 10 bucks a 12 pack. It's cheap AND satisfying. It seems to always be sold out in my area. When I'm out, I buy more. Just make sure you serve it ice cold because once it stays at room temperature longer than 15 minutes it's no good."
"Straw golden hued with excellent clarity. A quarter inch of eggshell white head rests on top. Slinky aroma of corn and lager yeast is what I smell. Head retention is poor and it is gone. Tastes like stale Kellogg's corn pops. The mouth is thin and watery."

"my very first beer, handed down from my grandfather. I swear this runs through is veins...as long as I can remember, hardly ever saw him without one in his hand. always remember him sitting out late at night on his porch, drinking and as he would say, ""counting his blessings."" a beer that has sentimental value which puts it up there for me. love that green bottle! in my eyes, the drink of a hard working family man."

"O - One of my go-to AALs. It's an unabashedly delightful and delicious brew."
""
""
"Easy drinking with no taste whatsoever, I found Rolling Rock to be quite overrated and honestly it's a beer that should be avoided. On tap it pours a light yellow, the taste is non existent and it is a smooth finishing brew with a very light of water."

"Overall, for a massed produced beer, this ""extra pale"" is not that bad. Drinking after something awesome like an aamazing IPA or such, it doesn't seem that great. But compared to your Buds, Millers and such, this is a real nice beer. Aroma is not the greatest, do I detect a hint of skunkiness?. Overall, the taste is slightly crisp but does have a little more lingering aftertatste than I prefer with this type of beer. A good ""go to"" above average ""average"" beer"
""
""
"I like it on the same level as my go to PBR, but feel its a little lighter"
""
""
""
"I do not remember when I had this beer but this beer was okay. It was not my favorite beer that I have had. The smell was okay, and the taste was okay. This was not my favorite beer that I have had. But I am glad that I tried it. The aroma of this beer was ok, but like I said this was not my favorite beer."

"There's not a lot of flavor here, but what is there is a very clean and refreshing. Very light, and has the potential to be a great summer beer if it's on sale. Otherwise there are others from the style I'd take over this. I think what's best about this beer is not what it is, but rather what it isn't. That is, it's not harsh, funky, or metallic like some AALs, which in some ways is endorsement enough."

"Overall 3.0: In spite of this beer's many faults, it is still OK. Nothing fantastic, just a basic lagery, bubbly, malt beverage to quench your thirst or wash down some pizza or wings. If you can get it cheap in the summer, it is a great lawnmower beer. Still, if you pay over five bucks for a sixer of these, get your head examined. Again, this beer is not bad, it just is not that good. A classic and an OK beer."

"A clean, smooth, well made economy macro lager. 4.4% abv. 130 calories. 1.3g protein. That is a pretty high amount of protein for a light bodied 4.4% beer. That means they don't skimp on the barley malt. That means there's not too much adjunct in here. You wouldn't know that from the price. This beer is pretty good. Hard to find a better budget beer than this."

"In it's defense, it kept me very hydrated. Craft beers do tend to make me a little dehydrated after a session, but here with Rolling Rock it was quenching my thirst like a good sports drink while giving me a nice alco buzz. If you want to chug back on something close to mineral water and get a cheap buzz -- pick some up. Although I'd recommend PBR over this any day (assuming you're on a budget)"

"This was beer of choice as a young adult and college student, it just had a great taste and was a good beer to chill out and relax with, though it does leave you with a terrible hangover. The quality and taste did change when AB-InBev bought out Rolling Rock and moved production out of Pennsylvania. It pours real pale yellow, with a soapy head the dissolves quickly, and sparkles with carbonation. You get a mineral watery, malty taste, that is finished with a sweet taste. There is a malt aftertaste, no edge, light in body, and not filling. Good with food, working, and fishing."

"Rolling Rock Extra Pale brew by Latrobe Brewing Co but now Anheuser Busch. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. It smells like beer- what else can I say. This brew has the look and taste of an American style lager. Rolling Rock Extra Pale goes down smooth and crisp. This beer has body and flavor. Even the after tease is good. There is no bad after taste, just clean and refreshing. There nothing bad about this brew at all. Over All I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5."
"Not too bad for what it is, although the really watery flavor and mouthfeel is bit off-putting. I don't even get a subtle ""bite"" here. This is the first one of these I've had for a long time and I think I probably won't get it again for a long time unless it's all there is and I'm dying of thirst."

"Pours a crystal clear gold in color with about a 1-finger frizzy white head that settles down to just the top. Some spotty lacing was seen. Lots of bubbles streaming up from the sides and bottom of the glass with medium carbonation. The aroma is of sweet corn, rice and grains. The taste is about the same but is stronger and more of a sweeter finish."

"O: This beer seems to be a little more palatable compared to some of the other American Adjunct Lagers, but seems to be a little too sweet and could use a light amount of bitterness to balance things off."
"Not bad for the price. It's an easy drinking crisp refreshing lager."

"I really enjoyed this beer. it is tasty, goes down smoothly, and some how stayed cold for a while. (maybe because its winter) but my first time having this beer a year or so ago, i had to get it again because i enjoyed it so much. . although i think the packaging could be a little more attractive, its affordable, and as i said good. I will recommend this beer to anyone."

"The American Adjunct Lager...Have you seen it? Have you smelt it? Tasted it? Obviously no pretentious connoisseur will admit to it, or dignify it with a review. However, when times are tough, or even if they are not, why not get the most bang for your buck? I recently purchased a twelve pack of this beer for $8.94 . Any other beer in this genre that could be purchased at a competitive price would invariably cause headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and /or death. That being said, Rolling Rock is the supreme A.J.L. insofar as it has never caused me any of these symptoms, and has always given me a decent and refreshing buzz, without swelling my midsection into a gelatinous slime. At only 142 calories and $0.75 per 12 oz. bottle, Rolling Rock is my preferred session/go-to beer. A great value, and in the context of the genre, the best you are going to get as far as taste and mouth feel. DO NOT PURCHASE IN CANS! Bottles are far superior in flavor...and painting. Do not attempt to pour into a glass either! There is not much in the way of appearance or lacing to behold here. This is a beer for the masses, to be enjoyed straight out of the bottle, and for a reasonable price and caloric content. If you wear a monocle, and/or a top hat, steer clear, but if you are a practical and economical working person, this beer is a great return on investment."
"A GREAT beer. My first time drinking this was on sunday night and I must say after 3, I was craving more. It was a very smooth, tasty beer. Easy to drink and fun to just relax with. I highly suggest this to anyone else looking to expand their beer repertoire."

"O: I like rolling rock its my goto cheap beer. If Im drinking to get drunk Im drinking rolling rock. Ive had it out of the bottle and it is much better, however I can get 18 cans for $9.60 or a 6 pack of bottles for 6 bucks. This beer is incredibly refreshing and isn't revolting in taste it is by far one of the better AAL thats Ive had."

"The beer, if had out of a can, is a mistake. A 30 rack of this stuff just isn't the way to go (bottles and cans is like day and night with RR). Buy a 12 pack and enjoy! Very smooth and drinkable for a night out or a winter holiday such as Christmas or especially New Year's. A step above a typical Budweiser."

"Pours pale straw with little foam. Bubbly throughout and looks like alcoholic soda. Aroma is sourdough biscuit malt and little else, maybe a slight whiff of green grass and sulphur. Taste is similar to the aroma, with the barest hint of hop bitterness. Mostly sour uncooked dough and another thin sour flavor that calls to mind ultradiluted lemon juice. Cornflake sweetness. Maybe a hint of vinous fruit. Notable DMS. Very watery and thin, leaves mild bitterness on the palate and ends dry, with playdough and plaster notes lingering. Was expecting more skunk given the green bottle but actually wasn't too bad in this regard. Hard to imagine how a light version of an already very pallid beer would even qualify as beer."

"I think of this as malt soda, rather than beer, in the classical sense. It is a very crisp and refreshing beverage that absolutely has no equal in the summer months after a long day of lawn mowing in the hot sun. I grew up drinking this beer (back when they made it in Latrobe, PA), and it is the one beer that I still drink from my youth."

"Would I get it again? Definitely"
"This beer isn't quite the same since the boys in St. Louis took it over. Rolling Rock extra pale seems a bit watered down, perhaps that's why it's extra pale. Still it has a good light taste and if you get a fresh bottle you can almost feel the glass-lined tanks of old Latrobe, Pa. Progress is not always best my thirsty friend. Still maybe it's Nostalgia, but I find myself buying twelve pack of Rolling Rock on occasion and yes, enjoying it."
""
""
""
""
""

"I like it, not too and it goes down really smooth. I can't really find anything that I hate about this beer, I feel like its a weekend with the bros beer, it's so smooth that you could down a few and get a pretty good buzz. Over all, I wouldn't drink it all the time but I would get it every now and again."

" For those of you who would like a good, refreshing beer without a huge price tag, go for the rolling rock. For those of you with a bit more beer money, I'd recommend Alexander Keith, very similar but a bit more refined."
"O- I don't usually buy cheaper ales such as rolling rock as they are usually fizzy like a soda and lack any valuable taste and character. This time around I decided to try this one to suffice as refreshing beverage on a warm summer day. Go in with low expectations and you won't be entirely disappointed. I recommend this one."
""

"While green is my favorite color, the beer is definitely not. It is to my best belief that they have recently changed this beer, and in doing so greatly reduced the quality/taste. I used to like it at first (14.99 30 packs!:)) but now that I'm older, I have really learned that it is quite gross. In saying that, it is still beer, and if it's in the fridge or at the party, fuck it, because I'm drinking it!"
"Of all the American adjunct lagers I have tried, Rolling Rock is definitely one of the lightest and most bland. I can only image how flavorless the actual light version of this must be."
""
""
""
"Well, looks as if Mom knows her stuff! I often feel like this beer gets a bad rep from more experienced drinkers. It's very good, and one that I can consider a go-to beer for light and easy drinking."

"Rolling Rock - a little different. The mystery of the ""33"" on the label may refer to the fact that the beer is brewed at 33 degrees and is by far best served at 33 degrees. Or it may mean something much more mysterious. Despite the fact that it is now brewed in St. Louis and is owned by a Belgian global giant, it is still an interesting niche beer. I just purchased an 18 pack of 16 oz. cans for $11.99 in Seattle. That makes Rolling Rock a great warm weather bargain beer. Served ice cold in my stainless steel insulated mug, it is truly refreshing on a warm day. There has to be some appreciation of beers that are affordable for the masses and are clean and refreshing without the macro-brew name. I like PBR and Rolling Rock for this reason. I am rating it based on it's competition and price and not how it compares with Fremont Brewing's Summer Ale (freaking awesome). There ought to be another category for value. Rolling Rock would be a perfect 5!"
""
""
""
"An under appreciated domestic beer that possesses a unique pale ale flavor that is unlike any of the other MacroBreweries. Best enjoyed in the bottle. I've always been grateful for Rolling Rock's painted label, very cool. With all the other bottles out there you can peel their brand right off the bottle, but not Rolling Rock. A very good beer for an always reasonable price."
""
"Serving Rolling Rock at a near-freezing temperature makes it tolerable, but that glass is a ticking time-bomb - once that chill fades all kinds of horrors ignite. Indeed, drinking rice and corn lagers is a form of torture for any true beer geek - not because of their brand names or that they're mass-produced but because, simply, they're made with atrociously inferior ingredients."

"Light straw color, mostly see-through. Weak head, weak retention. Grainy aroma with hints of herbal hop. Mild malt flavor and lots of rice adjunct. Grassy, herbal hop and not quite enough to balance. Light bodied, coarse grainy texture, descent carbonation. Nothing special. No offensive flavors but nothing interesting either."
""
"OVERALL: Kind of odd when you actually try to taste this beer. If you're not paying attention, it drinks like water. Under the microscope, it's kind of odd like mentioned earlier."
""
""

"appearance is excellent, great styling, smell is good too, taste is excellent, they must use alot of hops in making it, yet its very sweet, its like a sweeter version of Heineken, mouth-feel is pretty nice I suppose, and overall I love this beer, my one and only beef with it is that its hard to find, but besides that I think this is the pinnacle of American Macro lagers, and I would hope that even all the craft beer preppies on this site try it and like it too."

"From the recognizable green bottle, this beer is a very light yellow with a negligible head. Completely clear. Clean grainy smell...not much of a hop aroma, but maybe a hint of malt. The taste is clean and has a little sweetness. Light in body. Average macro lager."
""
""
"When poured into a glass it's got a nice calm look, like others said very straw like. Smells like party beer. Cheap, easy to down. Bit of a hint of rice. You can't really taste much. Pleasant mouthfeel, unlike most cheaper brews. I still enjoy it because it's inexpensive yet appreciated my most when you show up with it at a get together."

"Didn't really like this beer that much. Drank it up in Vermont during a winter storm and it did its purpose it was something to drink, but didn't enjoy it. The main reason I had it was because it is cheap for a 30 pack and it's what my roommate enjoyed, so I obliged."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely an average beer, this lager pours a pale straw golden colour with a thick, three finger head that quickly disipates to one finger. Smells sweet, with grain and corn up front. Not as offensive as Natty Light, but very similar. Tastes sweet with malt grains and corn. Definitely an adjunct lager. Mouthfeel is light and easy, with a low to medium carbonation. Overall, a decent beer to have on a hot day. A beer to pound back after mowing the lawn on a hot summers day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as mediocrity goes, Rolling Rock takes the cake. The problem lies with it's complete and utter inoffensive nature; extra pale describes not just the color but the nose and taste as well. It's all light toasted grain and corn; there is a dextrinous sweetness that would be a flaw in flavor if its wasn't part of Rolling Rocks signature taste.The carbonation is lighter and the mouthfeel slightly thicker than you would expect, the problem is that none of this adds up to anything very interesting. A beer for those who want to venture from the confines of light lager, and no one else."
""
""
""
""
"Well, it is certainly Extra Pale, as the can said it would be. It has kind of a watered-down gold color, with a big fizzy head at first. This bubbles away to just a thin sheet of white that sits atop the brew. Carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of the globe at a steady pace. A very adjunct smell of white rice and sweet creamed corn dominates the aroma. Some hay-like dry grassiness may represent hops, or maybe actual hay in the mash. As liquid first touches the tongue, it seems a bit sweeter than most macro-brewed lagers. A refreshing, almost Sprite-like citrus flavor puckers the cheeks while the high carbonation and subtle, dry fruitiness make this a much more deserving candidate than Coors (or is it Miller?) for the title ""The Champagne of Beers."" There's really more adjunct grains than malt in here. Maybe just a little breadiness is all I can detect. Light body and lots of fizz make for a difficult mouth experience when cold, yet I don't think this would be palatable if it weren't cold."

""
""
"It's a really pale yellow straw with a central cylinder of bubbles rising to a central dome of white etch. Smells real distant, some flowers, some grains and white rice - this kinda reminds me of urine from a catheter bag. A very light flavor, with grain, a bit of corn some sweet bread flavors in there as well. Not a good flavor, but plenty of water like flavors. Thin, empty body with some hi carb and a slick finish. This is less than impressive."

"Note: I review for the style. I refuse to let my prejudices slant any review. Nothing worse than the typical beer snob reviewing an AAL, same for your AAL drinker reviewing a craft brew."

"This was my college beer. It was cheap, tasted better than the budweiser I was used to drinking and it was easy to down. Now that I have had some time to taste other types of beer, it is sort of disappointing to go back to it. I have noticed there is kind of a cheap carbonation type thing going on when I drink it, which I did not remember it having at all. It was like I was downing some beer soda. Not my style. Regardless, if I am short on cash and don't want a 40oz I tend to turn to this."
""
""
"This was my college ""homework beer""...it made engineering homework more interesting. I don't know if it is just because I have gotten older, but drinking it today was difficult. It has a corny sweetness that is almost overwhelming. It reminds me of the smell of wet corn and cardboard. It is incredibly simple, and a prime (but not good) example of an adjunct lager."

""

"Poured a clear yellow with no head. Par for the AAL course. Scents of lager yeast, slight apple juice, crystal malt and a hint of skunk. Decent enough, true to it's style. Flavor is sweet, mostly maize adjuncts with a bit of malt. Absolutely no hop presence. Again, much like it's peers, though less offensive than some. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with high carbonation. Very seltzer-water in feel. It's less watery than I recall, and is by far the best of the cheaper AALs, but it fails to compare to any craft lager or pilsner."
"The package is fine. The green bottle and clear labels are nice. They give me a hope that is inevitably let down. Perhaps in the 30s this was considered good beer given the environment at the time. But now I'm speculating."
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer, but must be served cold. Somewhat mild tasting, a very watery/seltzery texture. The flavor is not very colorful at all, in fact it's almost non-detectable. Compared to other cheap, pale lagers, Rolling Rock is still a refreshing drink, but it is simply boring on the taste buds. Overall, a decent beer, but nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
"Not the worse AAL under the sun, and in all actuality, probably one of the better macros, in my opinion. This bitch is best served cold, ice cold, right at about 33 degrees F (that's about 0.56 degrees Celcius for you normal people). You might consider freezing this with a twig shoved through the center to make yourself a Rolling Rock lollipop."

"Thin and watery with high carbonation. Just not a good beer, and the green bottle doesn't help at all. Nobody to blame but the brewery for this mess."
"It took me about 4 sips to finish a can of this, after drinking 2 pints of spaten optimator. It's an extremely watery beer, but the price is right. I could definitely continuously put these down, even after a day of drinking. Rolling rock is a good alternative to an American beer like budweiser. Yet not as feminine as drinkin a ligh beer. It is light on the palette."
""
""
""
"The flavor is as mild as the nearly clear color but it's got a decent abv and would be ideal for an informal social event over fishing beers or other mass produced light lagers."
""
"O-I do not recommend this beer. If you want adjunct lager, drink MGD. Maybe it was a bad batch, I don't know. There was not a date on it. I did not even finish the whole thing. I dumped it in the sink."
""
"A screw off cap to the bottle, in which, I consumed straight. The effervescence of this brew is interesting, pale golden in color with an excellent blend of light herbal qualities. This is a great session beer that goes well with barbeques; and it is light on the stomach. In addition, this beer reminds you of an alcohol based 'Perrier', minus the bite of the CO2 - goes down smooth but allows for belching after each bottle consumed. You actually don't realize the alcohol content, as it is brilliantly soft on the palate, although it is on the sweeter side for the ABV of this brand. A definite worthy try."
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 1/2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grain and corn flakes. Taste is of grain, corn flakes, and some light fruity flavors. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer mainly due to the nice mouthfeel and the refreshing quality this has when served extremely cold. I would much rather drink this than other beers of the style given a choice."

"Overall--for a cheap beer, Rolling Rock Pale Ale sets a bar that most other discount brews fail to achieve. That being said however, it lacks the inspiration and taste necessary to separate it from the pack. Drinkability is relatively high, but the carbonation inhibits the enjoyment of this relatively simple, yet consistent flavor. For a discount beer, Rolling rock certainly surpasses the competition, but falls drastically short of higher quality beer. Simply put, if you need something to drink, don't have that much money, but still value your tastebuds, rolling rock extra pale is the way to go. It leaves something to be desired, but not nearly as much as other contemporary discount brews."
"Rolling Rock 1989: good beer. Rolling Rock 2012: average beer. The name is there, but history is damned by corporate pirate assholes A-B who would pimp their moms for 0.02 cents on the dollar. Corporate fascists have ruined a once great brewing tradition from the glass lined tanks of Old Latrobe. Corn husk lemon buttered popcorn diacetyl witch hazel brew. But, not radically bad if really, really cold. Choke it down, my alcho-enhanced brethren, but know as you get drunk you sponsor the banker controlled corpo-overthrow of everything once good. Bow to your sensei and taste his rancid ball sweat."

"First let me say RR tastes different post AB acquisition, the old RR had a better, distinct flavor. AB RR has a light straw color and little head, but the beer is very carbonated. Smell is sour with adjunct dominance, smells like a house the day after a large keg party. The taste is similar, sour and corn dominant that gets worse as you drink it down. Mouthfeel is watery but you can pour it down if desired. Overall RR now seems to compete with the low end of the spectrum ala beast, natty, etc. Wouldnt want to test the hangover factor on this one. 20 years ago RR had a more hoppy, malty flavor."

"It is definitely hard to review this beer. I have just recently tried this beer and have enjoyed it quite a bit but after further drinking I have noticed different things about the beer that can put me off. The appearance is quite clear, and no color, high carbonation. The head is quick to dissipate and is very thin. The aroma of the beer is sweet somewhat but also dry. The taste is where it bothers me. The beer is called extra pale but does not taste like a pale. Correct me if I am wrong but aren't pales supposed to be a bit bitter? The taste is sweet and is very similar to the aromatic qualities of the beer. The taste does go very well with ""sweet"" meats like BBQ or grilled pork. The mouthfeel is somewhat different from this style of beer. I think it is smooth but also dry."
"O- not a great beer, but I still think this one has better flavor than the other BMC's out there. Maybe a decent beer to session with if you feel like pounding more than 2 or 3 down."

"Bad beer central. This one pours from the green bottle a light golden, nearly completely water colored, with a fluffy white head. Smells and tastes like stale skunk, maybe a bit of corn and hay. Mouthfeel is light and yet offensive with the skunky finish, with high carbonation. Bad stuff here. Bud Light is a huge upgrade from this."
"Overall – Very mild on most fronts. Not a beer to go to if looking for something more “flavorful and heavy”, but not a bad beer to have on a hot day after working outside and needing something lighter and more refreshing."

"The mouthfeel is nowhere near crisp enough, if i am going to drink something like this it needs a brighter and lighter body."
"Overall - A decent lawn mower or tailgating beer. Not something I'd buy at a bar, but some friends had a pitcher on the guy so I gave it a shot. You can do much better"
""
""
""
"Final Thought: Well, I had this after a night of skating and I downed it fairly quickly and easily, but the price wasn't quite what I wanted it to be for what it was. All in all, it's a slightly hoppier spin on the Macro Lager. I think Rolling Rock slightly pale might be a better name for it though. A surprising amount of flavour though for a 4.6% offering."

"If I'm in your typical store scenario where the selection is mostly all Bud Light, Miller Light, Coors Light, Busch, various ""Ice"" varieties, Mike's Hard Lemonade, Heineken, Corona, or Rolling Rock, I buy the Rolling Rock every time. I'd probably even choose it over a small selection of sub par craft beers."
"I have had this beer many times but this is the first time I've had the privilege to review it, I guess. Pours what you'd expect from an adjunct lager, translucent yellow. Has a head momentarily, but it quickly bails. Smells kinda metallic, with corn and rice present. The taste is similar to the smell, almost no hops detected. The mouthfeel and drinkability is where this beer shines, however. One of the easiest drinking beers I've ever had. Overall, it's nothing to get too excited over, but for a cheap beer, it gets the job done."

"Ahhhh, six pack of pounders for $5. Thanks for the bargain! This pours yellow and clear, white head disappears almost immediately. Smells a bit grainy, but aroma really is unremarkable. Spot on for style. Taste is grainy, with grassy and metallic notes also. Its like some other corn-adjuncted beers, but the flavors are muted. Sooo if you don't like the AAL style, there's less here to dislike. As with aroma, the taste is pretty clean. Finish is somewhat sweet, and good if you like sweet corn. Light mouthfeel fits the style. Overall this is an unoffensive offering that is cheap, readily available and there's a horse on the can. Solid 3 out of 5 thumbs up."

"The beer is very simple...very weak. Clear. Yet it still is skunky enough to turn me off from having too many...one is enough. I would imagine on a hot day, this sort of thing would really hit the spot, but such hot days don't happen in my neck of the woods often so unfortunately, I'd have to give this run-of-the-mill-beer-in-a-green-bottle a pass."

"Overall: It's nothing special, but if you're looking for a buzz it's not bad. And I'd certainly accept it at a party or BBQ, much like other adjunct lagers, it's good on a hot day."

"12oz bottle. Pours a pale yellow with a thin quickly fading white head. Aroma of grass, some corn, some faint malt in the taste. A light body with very little carbonation, and a watery mouth feel. Finish is some grass with some light malt in there, I do not taste any hops and flavor is quite bland and watery. I would not drink this again."
"One of these goes down so easy... out of the big adjunct lagers this one is probably near the top for me. I forget the price point for this but I'd let this replace PBR sometimes."
"Not noteworthy at all for the style, except to keep in mind not to bother buying any more of this."
"and PLEASE beware of dogfish head raison d'etre-it has the power to drive you MAD!"
"Can: Poured a super pale yellow color lager with a medium size foamy head with light retention. Aroma of sweet adjunct is gross when I was expecting plain bland aroma. Taste is also gross with weird adjunct notes that are not even refreshing. This is worse then I was expecting, i.e. plain boring Coors Light style lager."
". . . I've a distinct feeling a could have found something better to do with this five minutes."
"Beer is medium to light in body, strong throughout the palate, vegetal harsh aftertaste that is counter balanced by the skunked body of this beer. Yep, it is horrid, just as I remembered and expected. Next."
"Bottom line, if you're looking for something to drink lots of, go for it. I usually don't get it, but when the grocery store has it on sale for $12 a case, who can complain."
"I'm almost positive this bottle (GREEN!!!!) was skunked!Funky aroma,fizzy body yet with a head that disappeared instantly. Almost as pale as water! Disappointing."
"Overall: I like a macrobrew but this doesn't cut it. Beers like this seem to have a following, but I suspect its more due to the inexpensiveness of getting tanked as opposed to flavor. I can't imagine I'd ever settle for a Rolling Rock again. Filthy, flavorless beer and a waste of two bucks."
" i have just decided i prefer the 'rock from their classic painted green bottle. the aromas detract from what i would consider an above average american macro when consumed from the bottle. i admit that i have a bias towards painted labels and lighter colored glass when i'm drinking this type of beer. don't know why, but so it goes. will i buy the $6 Rolling Rock 12'er of cans again? i'll take it over keystone, pbr, or the like."
"Sorry, but this one is just not worth the effort."
"O - Easy drinking but down get your hopes up. I'd chalk it up as another average macro produced light lager."
"I think every beer drinker should have a favorite cheap beer. For me, this is it. It pours a very fizzy head and has a very clear appearance. Smells slightly sweet and corny. Tastes much the same. No bitter aftertaste. Goes down smooth. Very easy to chug these all day long."
"It's an easily drinkable, though obviously unsophisticated beer. You buy this because it's cheap, but you buy it over Coors because it isn't gross."
"Very light yellow in color with a nice foamy head. Lot's of lacing for a pale lager, foam still coating the empty glass long afterwards. Just a slight bit too much corn taste for my liking, but overall this is a very tasty beer for the price (light years better than the macro adjuncts). This beer always goes down extremely smooth for me so whenever I drink one I end up drinking 8 or 9. I'll probably be revisiting this one a good bit in the near future."
"O: Not a horrible ""big guy"" lager; this is easy to drink and doesn't offend--a decent hot weather beer"
"Plain is as plain does - this doesn't overtly offend nor does it inspire in the least. Another boring AB-Inbev shell company lager is not what we need around here, especially at joints that profess to damned well know better."
"Not the best around but a decent choice for the price."
"O: Tastes like a light macro that someone added a splash of syrup-sweetener to. Despite this, it is definitely one of the best beers I’ve encountered for the style, and I would choose this over the ‘big three’ any day. It definitely poured like a real beer and looks great in the glass."
"Very drinkable but there's little in the way of flavor. I used to love this beer in college, but something changed in my opinion when AB took over."
"This is a decent summer beer in that it's easy to drink and when it's cold, it tasted pretty good. Nothing spectacular or above average about it and I won't go out of my way to find it, but I wouldn't say I won't give it another shot."
"nothing that special that's for sure. I liked how it was local for me but since they moved out of the state the beer got alittle worse. The water source used to make the beer. It is relatively cheap, could be while a lot of people are attracted to it, but the taste isn't too pure to me."
"O - not my style and not worth trying again"
"O- meh...nothing to report, cheap beer goes down easy but nothing special at all"
"Final Grade: 2.63, a C-."
"I had a choice between this and Coors, and this looked classier so I gave it a shot. I should have gone for the Coors. Not good at all, very watery and as I recall even slightly bitter. Very clear, light and fizzy. Smells terrible and the aftertaste isn’t much better."
"I have to say I was actually quite surprised. This may be the best beer in a green bottle I've had. Probably because all the other beers I've had in a green bottle taste like rotten lettuce. But even so, I'd take this over plenty of other macros. Simple, unoffensive, clean notes if finished while cold."
"Once was one of the best beers brewed in Pennsylvania a fantastic extra pale ale until it got bought out by Anheuser-Busch. Now it tastes different certainly not good. But it pours a very light golden yellow with a bright white head. Not the best anymore."
"Overall, this is not a horrible beer, but it is not good. I might have enjoyed this one when I was 16. If I am going to drink cheap piss beer, I am going to drink PBR, Oly, Hamm's, or Rainier. In my mind, all are much better."
"O: It's not the worst macro you can buy, but I wish I had saved the $15 and gotten a keg of keystone for my party over this. It's been a chore to finish off this keg before getting a decent one back in the ole kegerator."
"It pours a light gold color, with little head. Definitely has a sweet corn taste. One of the best light beers I've ever had."
"O: This is a straight up AAL. This is an alright beer that would probably taste its best after mowing or when out disc golfing when no craft in cans are at my disposal. Rating this to style its my 2nd choice of AALs next to PBR."
"I tried this beer on May 10, 2011 after purchasing from one of my local LCBO outlels. The beer poured a translucent light gold colour with a this bubbly head that dissipated into nothing within a minute. The aroma is grain, metal, and corn. The mouthfeel is weak bodied, almost watery with mild carbonation. The flavour is weak grainy malt, with an acidic aftertaste. A good working from home beer."
"This review really shouldn't be this long. I just want to say that I can't believe this beer even gets a C-, it should be one of the last cheap beers you buy."
"Has a fairly unique taste for the style and makes a good ""ice cold/hot day"" thirst quencher. I'd grab this over most other macro alternatives, but frankly it's still kind of gross."
"This was my other Grandfathers favorite beer, he would probably be rolling in his grave knowing that it was sold to AB. This beer pours out as a yellow color with a head that quickly vanishes. The smell of the beer has a light skunkiness to it and some fresh grains and corn on the nose. The taste is on the sweeter side and has a decent bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and very drinkable. Overall is a decent social drinking brew."
"Very pale colored beer, lively with bubbles and with a fine, white, soapy head. Highly adjunct smell, mildly grassy hops aromas are faint and removed. Taster is very mild, grainy and with a quick finish of more adjuncts and hay-like cheap hops. Meh, pretty boring beer."
"Definitely my favorite of the less expensive beers, this is the perfect thing to drink after a long day at your blue-collar job. Thee working class beer for sure. Everything, from the cheap taste to the not-so frothy head to the awesome green-glass bottle gets me excited. We always keep some Rolling Rock around the house, along with other, more expensive beers; but I always keep coming back to the Rock. Classy? Maybe not. Sophisticated? No. Delicious for what it is? Without a doubt."
"Wow, I actually used to drink this. Pours a clear, residual brownish-yellow color that is one shade away from being water. Thin, bubbly, white head. Naught in the aroma other than skunk and a touch of grain. Cereal grains in the taste--barely--metallic and skunky. Light and watery, easy to drink if you just wanna down a case and get fit-shaced."
"really pale, almost transparent blonde, big head that disapates almost instantly. Smell is corn and grain, big hints of cheese, lightly malty but lots of cooked corn. Taste is all corn, at points its faintly malty and lightly bitter but cooked corn is everywhere in this. Mouthfeel is light and very watery, carb is really high. This was awfull I didn't get past a quarter pint before this found the drain. This is really bad even keeping style in mind."
"Even within this anemic style, this is not a winner."
"ALSO - Don't drink Rolling Rock out of a can. I know it's tempting, but don't do it. It's a completely different experience."
"Narrative: Just another day at the Latrobe Waterpark, day in day out. Same water rushing through the same pipes, same heat, same dingy finish, yet, each summer the staff felt fulfilled. Sure, it was a cheap gig, no one felt exceptionally proud as a Wild Aqua waterpark attendant, but it paid for just enough Steel Reserve in the evenings to make the oppressive days worthwhile. Sure you get the occasional obese pre-teen exhibiting his rebellious nature coming down backwards. It was a mild hell, with mild rewards, but long term sustainability. Sure you get 100 patrons in a day urinating in the fetid pools, adolescents having tawdry affairs in the bushes, and a thousand forgettable days, however, some days the employees would look left to right and realize how good they had it. “STOP NO RUNNING, ALSO STOP URINIATING WHILE RUNNING, THANK YOU FOR NOT RUNNING NOW STOP URINATING!” Just another solid Sunday in July."
"Watery beer that's good for chugging down, hard to Pick up quality tastes to it for that reason. Tastes like bud light or other American macro beers."
"O: Other than being slightly better than coors light and bud light this beer has nothing really going for it. Its great if you want something thats easy to drink 15 of."
"Overall this is a very drinkable and light bodied beer. Nothing special but I would choose it over Bud and Miller and the likes. Since I am from Pa this beer, along with Yuengling, has a substantial following. It is just a shame its not made in Latrobe anymore and it has become consumed by the InBev Anheuser-Busch giant."
"A serviceable and unoffensive adjunct lager. Good for the style but the style doesn't demand a lot. I'll take this over a Bud or a Blue."
"D - It is what it is I suppose. Typical light beer without noticeable flaws for the style. Easy drinking."
"O: Pretty similar to most macro lagers, drinking it cold is better than warm when it starts to go downhill fast."
"Pours a small one finger white head that will probably be gone soon. The body is completely see through and here is loads of carbonation coming up through the yellow body. Looks like I might get decent lacing, but overall nothing special on the look here, looks like a normal adjunct lager with possibly some ok lacing. Smell is sour adjunct malt, but there is also sweet malt smell in there somewhere, which is good considering this is made by bud. No real hops to speak of on the smell, that sweet malt smell is the only real good thing, and that's a real stretch because almost all adjunct lagers have the sweet smell, it's only the real bad ones that only have the sour smell. The taste is pretty disappointing though, no real sweet malt on the taste, only sour adjunct flavor on the taste, and the rest of the taste is just water. There is no skunky flavor or smell, and that is good, because it's in a green bottle. The taste overall though just isn't good, it's honestly tastes like soap a little bit. It finishes really dry and like I said it tastes a lot like soap. This beer is disappointing because I recall like Rolling Rock at least a little more than this. I'll give it a 1.5 instead of a 1 because I'm a long time fan, and because it did end up giving me pretty solid lacing (even though that has nothing to do with flavor). I mean the tastes isn't awful, it isn't much worse than most adjunct lagers, but that soapy taste really bothers me, it's really subtle, but still. The mouthfeel is bad, but that's to be expected with an adjunct lager. The drinkability is ok, but that soapy taste for sure brings it down. Overall on this beer, I dunno, in terms of adjunct lagers it's ok. Not a bad appearance and not the worse smell, but the soapy flavor really dings this beer for me, I hate to say it too because I've always been a fan of rolling rock."
"Drinkability- Certainly and incredibly drinkable beer, it lacks in complexity as pretty much all of this style tend to but its better then alot of the others in this field, its made for sessioning on a real hot summer night or day when your not trying to think much or spend much, Its a relative value considering about 3 dollars less for 30 then say miller/coors/bud and if not better certainly the equal, not sure how it compares to the days of old but certainly and inoffensive beer that fits well for what it is"
"This is listed as an Adjunct Lager and tastes like one but I always thought it was a pale ale. Anyways, it's pretty light and easy to drink but its a beer that I would have to be in the mood for just to kill my thirst."
"More corn grits and biscuity pale malt in the flavor. Not much bitterness or hop character here, but does seem to have a bit more flavor than most of the mass-produced adjunct lagers out there. I'd say this is an above average AAL, but not worth the premium prices they charge for it."
"Rolling Rock Extra Pale seems to get a lot of negative reviews, but I have to wonder what people were expecting when they bought it. For $7 a six pack, it's on the lower end of the price spectrum. I would put it a peg higher than the traditional domestic macros, but not much else. I think you get what you pay for. All in all, not a bad beer. If I've got a little extra cash and feel like getting thoroughly sloshed, I would probably choose this over Budweiser or PBR."
"Bottle left in fridge from neighbor. Pours pale golden color with thin head. Nose is a bit off-putting with some cooked veggies and a weird metallic-like aroma. Palate has a light character overall making me wonder if a lot of rice was used because I don't get a decent malt component like some other adjunct lagers. The veggies from the nose are on the palate too. Watery."
"Used to be a decent beer when it was not owned by Anheiser Bush. Then corporate America came in and closed the plant but continue to falsely advertise and market the beer as a Latrobe beer. The only thing still tying this beer back to Latrobe is the fact that it taste like Arnold Palmer's piss. Now there is no difference between this beer and a Bud now a days."
"This is a standard american macro lager. Similar taste to bud light. Light corn taste. Lots of carbonation, light in the mouth. All in all this beer blows. But hey i'm no advocate of macro brew beer so i'm a bit prejudice. Drunkabiliity isnt bad tho.. rolling rock = binge drink beer"
"O: I used to like this stuff when I was in high school, but the more I drink it, the less I care for it."
"D: A highlight of this beer. Several can be had in a single sitting."
"There is something nice and refreshing about a Rolling Rock, especially in a can. That green color gets you every time... and make sure it's ICE COLD!"
"This pale clear yellow straw colored beer with a thin white head is overly carbonated. Its fizzy, watery and has no body. The smell is faint sweet corn, some malt, a touch of citrus, and a pound of skunk. The taste follows the nose with some metallic notes thrown in. Its gross, musty, skunky, and watery. Super light and bitter."
"Note - it is sub-freezing when I write this. If I were reviewing in mid-August, RR might get a review one full grade higher."
"If you're in the mood for a super light session beer that's not too boring then this might be a better compromise than some of the other similar AALs out there."
"Drinkability- Yes."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, dry and chewy on the tongue. Drinks fairly quick, but more due to lack of flavor than anything else. Definitely another crappy adjunct, but better than some other similar beers."
"One of my old college roommates used to take this wherever we went so I'm kind of partial to it. I don't exactly put it in the macro category. It pours a very pale and thin straw yellow with a one finger bright white head with decent lacing. It smells of grass, yeast, hay, and soda water. For the style, I like the flavor. It features possible hops (?) and grass and goes down very light. It's a little watery but I find this to be the most drinkable AAL around."
"As for feel and drinkability, the feel is crisp, but smooth.. light, but not watery. It is especially refreshing and goes down with the best of them. Recommend it with pizza or burgers, a good Bar&Grill or party beer."
"Congratulations Rolling Rock; you have survived this round of economy class beer competition."
"This beer is very drinkable, I would drink this over most pale lagers."
"Drinkability: It's about average. I wouldn't turn it down if I was at a gathering and there was nothing left, but I definitely wouldn't go after this on a regular. Watery enough to drink a lot of, and just enough lack of flavor to not phase you in a negative way."
"Nearly clear, pale golden with minimal white head that fades fast and very apparent carbonation Nearly no aroma, hint of malt. Very watery flavor and palate. VEry light smooth and pretty refreshing (not VERY pale though, or even slightly -- no hops). Nice cheap lager."
"D- One of the easiest beers to drink in my opinion."
"not great, but not bathwater!"
"Drink ability is okay. I guess if I wanted to get messed up and this was all they had I'd take it."
"D- I could certainly have more than one of these at a gathering, but this is not a beer that I would recommend to those looking for a fuller experience."
"M & D - dry, must be cold. The sweet floral thing is a bit interesting and it lingers for a while. There is actually a bit of hops there - moreso than other macros."
"Points off due to this beer being postioned as a ""premium beer", when really it can be lumped into adjunct catagory."
"Had this in a pizza place in New York City. I had no idea what to expect, but I've seen this a couple places in the US and figured it was finally time to give it a try. Pours a pale yellow colour with small white head that dissipates quickly, though some mild lacing on the glass. Smells of grainy malt with almost a hint of hops, but not really. Slight bitterness in the aftertaste, very mild flavour though. Big carbonation level made it harder to drink. I'd take this over Bud any day, but that isn't saying much I guess."
"Verdict: Premium Beer? This lager has several flaws, beginning with a weak aroma and appearance, dragging through the bland taste to create a beer experience that is not at all memorable, let alone enjoyable. My hopes go out to the fact that this beer can, and certainly should make vast improvements and alterations to this age-old formula for the sake of quality. Then again, there has to be somebody who enjoys this out there, considering the beer's 70+ year success. Cheers to adjunct lagers! D- (2)"
"Mouthfeel was very light which made it very easy to drink."
"D. It is drinkable for the style, but If I'm going to drink a macro I'd rather have a LaBatt Blue."
"They go down smooth, quick and are not that filling."
"This was recommended to me by a friend, who said it was a pale ale, it was not. It smelled like citric to me. It looked thin and pale, and tasted very unimpressive. Can not tell you about the head i drank it from the bottle. I have only had one, and didn't finish that. I would not ever drink it again."
"Drinkability- Extremely refreshing. Wish there were more hops and it would probably be a perfect beer for me. This 6-pack will be gone within the night. Would recommend but not my go to beer."
"Notes: Pretty much what to be expected. Faint pale malt and hops with cooked vegetable (corn) being prominent. Slightly off tart/sour grain flavor. Probably won't drink this again, unless someone offers it to me."
"it's been so many years since I last had this, so I can't remember if it was much different went it was brewed in good 'ole PA."
"Drink it on the hottest day of the hottest month of whatever the hottest season is on the sun is my recommendation."
"Since this beer moved out of Latrobe, it left the slightly bad taste back the old Rolling Rock's used to have back in Western PA. The new beer is the most refreshing and lightest beer out there. As others mentioned, its great to quench thirst with food or to pound several in the summer heat. About 40-50% cheaper than Corona/Land Shark and more refreshing to boot."
"Easy drinking, crisp, smooth beer. Ok, it's not made in Latrobe anymore, so that kinda stinks. But for what it is, Rock is a decent brew. Pizza, wings, burgers or dogs---grab a Rock and enjoy. And I still find the green glass painted bottle tre cool."
"The body was typical for this style. Drinkability was very good if you like this style, typical if you're not a fan (like me). Overall, a fairly typical example of the style. I seem to remember this beer being much more flavorful back when I first tried it in the Mid-70s, but perhaps my memory is playing tricks on me."
"refreshing taste, goes down very smooth. i could easily drink a 6 pack in one sitting. great when looking for an alternative to the mainstream macros. however next time, i'll opt for the bottle. great ""patio"" beer for the summer."
"This beer doesn't stick out to me very an anyway. It is a bit more expensive than Budweiser, Coors, and MGD. And honestly i dont think the beer has the taste to back up the price. Its not anything I would go back and buy."
"It pains me to tell you that Rolling Rock was a tremendous letdown to me. I've heard only good things about it being better than Bud/Miller/Coors, but honestly, I'm not seeing a justifiable side to the hype. I get an overwhelming sense of corn with this beer like no other. And as far as malts and hops go, there aren't any of either so it's bland and tastes like they added in the water from canned corn, seriously. I didn't think it would be *that* pale and lifeless as far as the flavor profile goes. I probably won't be having another one of these unless it's at someone's house or something and it's all they have."
"Poured into a short English pint looking glass With S.Y. Rabinovitch's portrait on it. Very clear pale straw color with thin white foamy head that recedes quickly, but sticks here and there. The smell is weak, sweet and grainy, which comes through in the taste with the slightest touch of hops. Very crisp carbonation, easy to drink, not bad by any means, good canned American adjunct."
"It is what it is, a very cheap standard low end beer which doesn't thrill but also is inoffensive enough that most anyone will drink it. Poured a huge head which dissipated completely. Straw yellow color. Very mild slightly sweet taste with maybe just barely a hint of hops."
"The pour from the green bottle to my glass resulted in a three finger head of thick foamy bubbles. The color is a pale amber rating a 4 on the SRM Beer color chart. The smell about snapped my head back. A pungent smell of wet corn husks and wet hay. A sweet flavor of corn and some stale wheat overrides the hint of citrus. Seems to lack any bitterness, just a bland finish. Fuzzy in my mouth and the back of my throat. Not a great beer by any means, but I could throw a few of these back at a party. They are about middle of the road. Alright price of a alright beer."
"I am going to move away from the rest of the Rolling Rocks in my fridge faster than I move away from a Rolling Stones live performance."
"I poured into a pint glass to an enormous white head. It is straw colored and clear. I half expected it to be skunked since it came in a green bottle. The smell is sweet and grainy. The taste isn't as sweet as most adjuncts. I haven't had this beer in quite some time and it isn't as bad as I remembered. I guess it's good for pounding when taste doesn't matter."
"Drinkability is fairy average but the mass consumer should definitely go for this over Bud Light any day."
"D- Goes down smooth and is a very mellow beer. It is very refreshing and good after you have been doing hard work especially on a hot day."
"It used to be better when it was brewed in Latrobe, but now it sucks even more."
"A smooth, easy drinking beer with not much more to offer than a good cheap price and high drinkability. For an adjunct lager it is really not bad, though. This is the kind of beer that gets better and better the more of 'em you've had, that is probably the strongest point to this beer. One thing that distinguishes Rolling Rock from the multiplicity of adjunct light style beers is the slight apple flavor that it has which is a nice change."
"Poured the beer into a pint glass; although I believe that this beer is better just drunk out of the bottle. The appearance is yellowish and clearish, with a light pacing white head. The nose is slightly training and is exactly what you would expect from an adjunct lager. The taste and mouthfeel are crisp and dry. This brew is a quafer and super drinkable perfect for a hot day or after a workout."
"An entire beverage of nuances, slight color, slight malty aroma with a mild hop aroma. Avoids finishing too sweet, as the hops balance the malt sweetness very well. Some flavor to this beer, perhaps corn I pick up as well? Overall, a decent beer for the style that I so decry, but is, every once in a while, a delightful change."
"but not the worst option for a cashed strapped college student looking for quantity over quality."
"The numbers here tell the story of a not to satisifying beer which is true but with every Rolling Rock after the first one, it seems to get progressively better. It is like your pallet adjust to the beer. The taste is bland at first but then as you taste it and follow it down, my opinion went from what the heck to hmmm, not bad. No color, no impressive smell or taste, but no bitterness either."
"D: Not bad for 50 cents a can. It's light, simple, non-wince inducing and on par with the more expensive big three macros. Perhaps a new go-to cheep beer?"
"The smell is nothing, or perhaps faint urine, but who smells a Rolling Rock anyway? This beer was designed to drain quickly, and it gets points for doing that well. Tasting like delicious water and crisp when cold. Fine."
"Still haven't gotten over how light this is. Enjoying this more than most other Amercian adjunct lagers. I guess it could be a good beer for drinking tons while camping on a reaaaally hot day or something but I'd always rather have something more...uh, beer like."
"This brew pours a see through chardonay colour with sparkling carbonation that really would make you think you were drinking a wine if someone offered and you didnt know that it wasnt,the smell is really sweet with hints of grapes,grain,dettol and a touch of gooseberries its so weird it looks and smells like a wine,the mouthfeel is unrewarding but yet very sessionable and the taste is definately not what i was hoping for with hints of grain,white grapes and liquid hops,overall this beer comes across as an American Macro and is very comparable to Tooheys Extra Dry i mean its not a beer that i would actively seek out and buy again but could knock back a few at the work BBQ as long as i wasnt paying for them."
"Rolling Rock comes off the spout looking burnt gold with semi hazy yellow trimmings, hardly a head or even a cap, looks dead after a bit. Smells like damp hay, sweet malt and no hops, grainy, weak. Taste is like city tap water because well there is no taste, just some small grain and malt, i guess there is hops in here but not alot. Less skunky than a bottle though, those things are horrid. Feel is light and crisp but the taste drawls me away. Drinakability is down the drain, id take any of the big three over this. Everybody looked at me in this dingy bar I was at when I had the thing dumped and I was just like ""What do you want from me?"""
"D-I would drink this before most other ""American Adjunct Lagers"". The funky taste gets to you after a while however. Much less drinkable from the can than the bottle."
"Overall I did not like this one."
"I'm not going to go through all of the A,S,T,M and D ratings, as this isn't the type of beer to deserve detailed comments like that. What I will say is this is a good, inexpensive football/ baseball session beer. A little more flavor than Miller Lite (not much, but better) if you are looking for a lower alcohol session beer to grab a 1/2 keg of and drink while watching sports at the basement bar."
"Rolling rock provides a very similar experience to drinking water."
"RJT"
"Appearance bumped up. Poured into a Pilsner glass. Nice three finger head that stayed a good five minute and left some spots of lace. In spite of the extra pale notation this is a well balanced beer. I don't taste the corn there is a little in the smell. The rice shows up in the taste but just barely and the light hop bitterness at the back leaves a nice lightly dry finish. Overall a light and tasty beer when you need a thirst quencher."
"A very light straw yellow with a thin yellowish slab of foam. No retention or lacing. The aroma is of toasted cereal grain, metal, and a light skunky smell. The flavor profile is lightly sweet with a very small amount of hops present. A touch of green apple. This is really devoid of all flavor outside of the residual toasted cereal sweetness. Light body and high carbonation. Not overly terrible."
"Maybe the price boosted my opinion. This beer is great for the low price, even in bottles. It is priced equal as coors but I enjoy it more. The carbonation is mild, and it is a good pale ale. I have heard people compare it to sprite, just without the overly sweet aftertaste. Something that i can feel comfortable drinking when I am on a budget"
"I have not had a Rolling Rock in years and I am remembering why. Only thing is it is worth what I paid for it. I found it on sale for $0.46 per can. In comparison to other beers at that cost it is what you would expect. It is much lighter than I remembered and more flavorless than I remembered too. Next time I'm shopping for the cheapest available I'll get something different."
"One thing I can say about this beer is although it may lack in alcohol content, it's one good quality is that even though it's a cheap and highly manufactured beer, it doesn't have a bad taste whatsoever. Great to drink a lot when you know you won't be driving home."
"Many, many good memories associated with this beer. The summer of '95 when they had the Pony Cap promotion where if you collected all six Triple Crown winners, you got a trip to the Kentucky Derby. Gooch and I sat in his Burbank apartment one Saturday and polished off EVERY bottle from EVERY liquor store in a five-block radius. Har! We quickly realized that Whirlaway was the elusive cap. Sam's Saloon put it on tap for me and the rep let me pick a buncha stuff out of the catalog for free. It netted the bar a neon sign! Good times."
"I enjoy this beer. Its very easy to drink, very smooth. Not the best ABV but still nice to sit down and drink. Not a beer to sip in my opinion. It tastes like a light beer. Smells alright not very hoppy. Its head isnt very strong. but an enjoyable beer."
"D: Not very impressed; the sweet malty hints are all that's there to give it a bit of character."
"The beer pours a pale yellow color, with minimal head and little to no lacing. The head that pours dissipates quickly. The carbonation is mild to above average. The smell is of grains, mostly corn. As far as taste, this beer is better than you would expect from the appearance and smell. It does seem a little watery though. It has a mild flavor, with notes of corn in the middle. The mouthfeel is a bit carbonated, but smooth. This is one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. I could drink this all day/night and not have an issue. It's one of my favorite cheap macro beers."
"Drinks poorly. There are plenty more cheeper beers out there that are at least this drinkable. Could be worse tho, could be a bud product."
"12 oz green bottle. Crystal clear and pale gold with a frothy white cap. The head fell to a collar and skim of fine bubbles after a few minutes and left some streaky lacing on the glass. Grainy cereal aroma with a bit of lemony hops, quite clean with no skunk. Bitterness was light, but certainly present. Modest sweetness up front, slight hop flavour mid-palate (lemony and a bit sulfury), with a flash of metal in the finish. Light bodied with ample carbonation, crisp and a little more dry than necessary. Refreshing and clean. I really don't mind this at all."
"d-Pretty drinkable...much more so than the standard macros. I really love this beer when I'm working outside on a hot day and I can take one out of the cooler."
"D: Its okay. I buy it now and then but not something I'd recommend."
"Taste, very prickly, lots of carbonation and a little bit of Saaz hops I would guess, maybe Kent Golding. Very light, refreshing. Price has went up over the years, but remains a decent deal given everything else in its category."
"Love this beer. Started buying it before it was taken over. I can currently get this beer on tap at the Eagles 75 cents. Only downside is on tap it gives quite a headache. Bottle is great too. I would hope one day the green bottle will be gone. I would avoid the can at all costs."
"If I'm judging to style here, and I'm trying my best to, the Rock ain't half bad. Certainly more tolerable than the ubiquitous BMC flagship offerings. Really, I'd only drink this in the future if offered or if thirsty. For the style: 3.5+. We'll see how my opinion may change on it once I have the ""pleasure"" of comparing it to other representatives of its kind."
"D - Clean and crisp. This is a good beer for a hot day."
"D- This lies somewhere above most AB- products and below PBR on list of cheap adjuncts for me. Could be worse, I suppose."
"Everything is pretty much average about this beer, so I won't bother with the usual A, S, and so on. To be honest, it's not a terrible beer but nothing I would ever crave or buy nowadays. If I were stuck at a party with it to drink, I'd be okay though. It has a taste that is better than the likes of PBR or any of the light beers, but nothing at all spectacular."
"D: These are one of those beers you could have a session with if it's hot outside, like today was for sure. Highly recommended while working on the lawn, grilling with friends, or just want a beer while it's hot out. So crisp."
"Growing up in PA we drank this over ML or Bud or even Yuengling. Definitely an upgrade over Miller lite or Bud. I always thought it tasted of metal. Maybe it was from the glass lined tanks at Latrobe."
"D: Good session beer for a hot day!"
"I drank a lot of RR in college (in NY) before the sale to AB, and while it has changed a bit since the old days with the shift from Latrobe, PA -- Mr. Rogers's hometown! -- to St. Louis, it hasn't been a sea change. This is still a middle-of-the-road American lager that is little watery for my taste but (as others have noted) is good for a volume session on a hot day. I think AB tried to buy themselves some ""street cred""/legacy by engulfing and devouring RR after the sellout to InBev but that never works since true believers never go along. But I can't hate on this beer since it's not that bad. Try one!"
"D- This beer has high drinkability. I personally wouldn't want to kill a 6'er of it. But well I had my fair share of it that night. It does have a spot in my drinking hobby. Low ABV makes this one easy as can be to have a couple and then a couple more."
"Overall, I don't see how this beer has a C- average I find it to be worse in the most important ways compared to other lagers taste is bland and skunky I would choose a lot of lagers over this one. As I sat finishing this beer I honesltly had trouble finishing it and though back to a few nights ago when I had some keystone light and how even that is easy to drink and tastes better. I really don't like this beer."
"Overall, I remember this beer having a little more flavor, though it was not a good flavor. This tastes like beer flavored carbonated water. I'm sure there are people out there that swear this was a better product before it was bought out by A.B., but I had it then and I think its just as bad of a product as before. The only difference was it wasn't owned by a huge corporation and hard working people of a small town produced it. I love the bottle and miss the commercials staring Jim Gaffigan but I probably won't be purchasing this again any time soon."
"D: one of the best $15 30-packs around, rolling rock is definitely a step above its American macro brethren."
"D: I could kill these all day long on a hot day."
"d-smooth drinkablity and light make his a good beer for hotter days or drinking alot of to be refreshed"
"best if enjoyed after mowing the lawn and this are nearly frozen. or used to wash down any overly spicey food. beer-flavored water at best."
"Overall: Perfect beer to kick back and enjoy a ballgame. Surprisingly good in some areas (smell and even taste), unsurprisingly bad in others (mouthfeel). As I said though, Rolling Rock gets skunked really fast. So drink it up quickly!"
"Nothing wrong with this light lager. Recommended if you're not too picky."
"What an underrated beer. Everyone knows it, everyone's had it, it's not expensive, why don't more people drink this? It's probably the marketing, because come to think about it, they have no marketing. But onto the beer, it's good and I like it, and I will drink a lot of it in the future."
"Try this beer, you will find yourself on your fourth before you know it."
"D: This is a beer, when it was made by Latrobe in Latrobe, PA, was a excellent tasting beer. since being made by AB InBev, it's lacks the stuff that Latrobe had."
"Well well well, Rolling Rock has tried to LOWER its brand name to compete with good ol' PBR!!! WHY, I remember the days that Rock was another green bottle beer along side with michlob or heiny!! This beer is like pee in a bottle because of its yellow tint and has more bubbles than a soda! If I wanted a soda, I would buy a soda not a cheep pee looking beer. AB....well inbev try again. Everyone remember PBR-RRRRba Day is coming up soon."
"Drinkability: Not really a craft beer, but more of a drink to be had at parties, etc. It also has this uncanny ability to somehow negate the effects of spicy food, but this may just be my observation."
"Cheers!"
"""Extra Pale"" yellow with a thin, fizzy head. This beer looks like Canada Dry ginger ale. A whiff of untoasted grain and DMS is about it in the nose. Slightly better than BMC beers flavor wise. Very little hop flavoring with just a touch of raw graininess. Thin bodied with seltzery carbonation. A good beer to drink ice cold on a hot day and not much else. You could do a lot worse for the style."
"this beer is simply not what it used to be, which was a simple, crisp, refreshing drinkable beer. Not overpowering in taste, but a good American simple taste...it was one of those classic beers we all first fell for"
"D: I can say it has decent drinkability as it's very light and refreshing. These would probably help you quench your thirst on a hot summer day. It's not terrible, just bland and uninteresting. Not one that I will be revisiting anytime soon."
"Overall, it's highly drinkable, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's -great-. It's like the sitcom of beers. You can sit down and enjoy it without having to really think to hard on it. As reflected in my scores, I'd say it hovers around the range of average."
"Drinkability: Went down easy enough and had an ABV under 5% so one could drink it all night. But why? I personally would pour it out."
"A decent ""cheap"" beer alternative"
"D - On of the more drinkable adjunct lagers... Many are off putting in one way or another... While there is nothing notable, there is nothing wrong with it either... When my option are limited, I wouldn't hesitate to drink a Rolling Rock in the future..."
"Rolling Rock is obviously not one of the world's greatest beers. That being said, you have to try Rolling Rock at least once. It's the first beer I drank on a regular basis (I've moved on to other beers since). You have to love the classic-looking green bottle of Rolling Rock. Since drinking other beers, my only complaint is that Rolling Rock is a bit skunky in taste."
"I like that it is a Smooth drinkable beer, very light tasting. My wife's comment was ""I could drink this stuff to fast"". If you don't like the nasty taste of most beers, you will enjoy this one. I think it's a great beer for the summer time."
"D- A very light tasting beer. Easy to drink. IIRC it's only 4.6% so that might be why as well."
"D - Not drinkable at all. Drain pour."
"I would not buy this unless it was for family :P."
"Drinkability: Its ok better than all of the aspects of this beer, and it tastes better out of a can."
"D: Very very good american beer."
"d- a little tough to force down since the buyout. not as smooth as it used to be"
"Drinkability: I must be honest that this beer is a well-known presence at my band practice nights. When you want to just stay hydrated while jamming and maybe catch a light buzz, this is the stuff."
"Pretty plain-jane. Very light color a real pale yellow. Highly carbonated but not a real rich head. Smell is unremarkable, almost a little stale. Taste is not that great, but it drinks crisp and has a light mouthfeel. Nothing really ""jumps out"" at you to seperate Rolling Rock from anything else out there. It was a big drink back in college in the Northeast because of price and the fact that it's pretty light. I wouldn't rush out to buy a six-pack given the other choices available."
"With so many better options out there, even of the ""macro"" type, this is a very poor option indeed."
"D: This beer is pretty drinkable, I could have about 10."
"Drinkablilty is not bad. Its nothing to write home about but something that would make a decent session beer. I consider this my stand-by beer for when I'm in a pinch."
"From bottle to shaker glass Aug 14, 2009. Pours light clear yellow with light white head, mostly diminishing. Little lacing throughout. Okay taste, but not much more than a light corn taste with a bit of sweetness, slightly bitter at the finish. Easy for a session beer, but the beer is not quite as good as the bottle! Love the bottle - kind of like Mountain Dew!"
"Even us true advocates sometimes despite our best intentions develop a weakness for a beer of the lower order... and Rolling Rock certainly is just that, it lacks body, flavor and complexity, however i must say on a hot day i thoroughly enjoy putting several of these back, its refreshing, light and goes down like its mouthfeel would suggest, like water if you poured this beer into a glass you would find it boring and pale looking with pathetic lacing, however my friends; i suggest you just twist off the cap and enjoy yourself the bottle is much better looking than the beer itself"
"A long, long time ago, I enjoyed an abundance of these with some friends on an out of town excursion. Don't ask me why, but I put it up to juvenile naivete. This is an awful beer. With a faint, weak/pale appearance, Rolling Rock pours like any other macro lager -- light and basically devoid of taste. The hint of fizziness/carbonation is appalling, and this tastes like a beer-flavored water beverage. Not even on a sweltering summer day while mowing the lawn would I ingest another one of these. Yuck."
"D- It is what it is. A decent 'Adjunct Lager' that won't wow anyone with RIS/DIPA tastes. It is however fairly smooth and easy drinking."
"With these things said, the drinkability of this beer is overall decent. If you pull one out of the cooler, open it, let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then drink it; you will be quite surprised. This definitely isn't a great beer, but it will do."
"Not a good beer. At the risk of sounding snobbish, if my choice is Old Latrobe or apple juice, I'll be happy to grab a cardboard container of Juicy Juice."
"had this a a barb-b que last night..it was this or bud so i picked this one this was just yellow water with a white head the taste was faint biscuit a little grass and a skunky aftertaste i guess if you are eating alot of hot foods or just finished digging a ditch or mowing the lawn you could drink it..but really how does this stay on the shelves at the store who buys this?"
"From a green 12 oz. bottle. Pours a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is very faint, slight hint of malts. Crisp taste but otherwise flavorless. Not much to this beer. Feels o.k. in the mouth. Very drinkable, godd for drinking games. Overall a mediocore"
"Pours a very light yellow color with a fluffy one finger head. The smell is of a very faint grain, not much in the smell department. The overall taste is kinda the same, a little bit of hop but mostly grains, very light. The mouthfeel is very carbonated yet crisp. Overall there is nothing offensive about this beer, the mouthfeel could be harsh, and the taste is very faint, but nothing to scare you off."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat thin with some slickness."
"Drinkability: just ok, not much else to say."
"Pours clear pale yellow with minimal white foam. Smell is grainy and corn-y - not distinguishable from other beers of this ""style."" The taste is not much different than beer-flavored water. Its very clean, almost too clean, but it makes the beer extremely drinkable. Nary a bitter hop to be found in a mouthful. Overall, not a great brew - a step above garbage like Bud Light, etc., but much better product out there and available."
"great drinkability, definately a lawn mower beer. the little bottle are definately convienient for this too. one of my favorite adjunt lagers, but still nothing too special."
"D: this beer is really watery and light but i like it way more than bud and coors ect. it brings a little something more to the party"
"Overall, I guess if you were eating very spice-dominant food, this could work, but this is nothing you want to sip and savor. Plenty of adjuncts out there better than this, as there are plenty that at far worse. Put this one smack in the middle of the adjunct lot."
"*- Overall, the Rolling Rock Extra Pale is much better than Budweiser, but is extremely similar to Coors. I would have to pick Pabst Blue Ribbon as my top American adjunct lager, then the Rolling Rock as my second choice. Overall not a bad experience for the style of beer."
"All I can really comment on with this beer is the taste. I know that this is supposed to be a mediocre beer, but I just really like the taste, so I can't complain about it. It is the perfect camping beer. It deserves a high score for the ""drink in hot weather"" dept. I dont want to go into the details because, this beer isnt like that. Its good like powdered lemonade is good. Its just good."
"Very light beer. While it is definitely not one of my favorites, great if you're going to drink a lot on a hot day."
"Appearance is a pale yellow gold with a thin head and very light lace. Smell of corny adjunct and grain. Taste doesn't have a whole lot going on, a lightly sweet, corny with a light bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Nothing great, but goes down fairly well."
"Rolling Rock Extra Pale is a clear pale straw color with a a dense white head that dissipates and leaves decent lacing. There's lots of DMS in the aroma with a touch of grassy hops. It's watery and prickly with a watery finish. It tastes funky and a little poisonous. There's a little grassy bitterness at the finish. It's pretty nasty."
"This is a good not great pale ale. The problem is the tradition of Latrobe brewing using corn and rice over malt to brew more cost effectively. You can actually taste the corn in the brew which spoils the maltiness usually present. Overall not a bad beer but not terriblly inexpensive as it was 20 years ago, there are far better choices for the money, Molson Canadian Lager for one and Pabst Blue Ribbon is better as well."
"In a word: swill. Actually, swill probably has more character. Undeniably easy to drink, but undeniably depressing to drink as well. This is everything bad about American beer. Had it not been free I would be hitting myself over the head as penance for purchasing it about now."
"Unfortunately, I bought a six-pack to try this beer, so I have to drink it. Wish me luck."
"d- goes down easy, very drinkable, more so than other adjuncts."
"I had this beer and wondered if it would be like I remembered it. Actually I don't really remember it, so I have no idea. I just remember it being not all that great or bad. Pours a golden/yellow color with no head. Leaves no lacing. Smells faintly of grains and maybe grass. Tastes very clean. No sweetness or bitterness, just a lot of carbonation and some faint grain character. It drinks easy, but theres not much else to say about it."
"drinkability: very easy. only good for long hot days."
"D: Highly drinkable, if it is on sale I would buy again but with it being priced higher that Bud typically would pick it over Bud if I wanted something light and basic."
"From the 1 pint can 09098-HD82. Sampled on May 9, 2009. The pour is your basic American pale yellow with a ridiculous amount of puffy white head that bubbles and pops until it is all diminished. Constant carbonation. The aroma has that grassy but slightly hopped scent that comes with these kinds of brews. The mouthfeel is rather watered down. The taste is actually the best part of the beer with that faintly malted and hopped mix that allows you to pound these down one after another. When I drink this one I tend to drink from the can rather than the skunked green bottle."
"D: More refreshing than a lot of macros, so long as you drink it when it's quite cold. No not attempt to drink after it has warmed up."
"This beer was very light, was a bit too light for my taste but a nice crisp beer is always has a place. Would be really good to have in between heavier beers for is refreshing flavor."
"D: I can drink a billion of these things in a night.... doesnt make a good beer though."
"Grainy, husky smell. Corn flavor, crispy drink, sort of dry. Drinkability is fine. Macro type lager. Formerly (for now) a PA corn/macro type beer. I always found this to be a beer brought out strong feelings for or against this beer. Use to be a Western PA local beer but in other parts a premium beer which is an unlikely combo. Dont notice any real change from Latrobe to Bud."
"Blipped ""I Wanna Rock"" by Twisted Sister"
"All this RR talk on the forum this weekend made me crave some 'ol 33. We used to get kegs of this shiznit for $28 back in the day. It made for great party beer. Guess I outgrew the stuff and nowadays I don't even think about grabbin' a sixer. It pours pale yellow and clear. Spot on. Smell is light, with notes of DMS and cereal grains. It tastes worse than memory serves, but palates change over time. Sweet and grainy, no hops to speak of. Tastes like a near beer in all honesty. Mouthfeel is light, but a little dull. Its not zesty, or crisp, or anything really. I had one, saluted yesteryear and turned the page."
"Well...I've had worse. Nothing exciting but I didn't hate it."
"D: I never know how to post some of these types of beer. I don't mind them, usually don't pass them up when offered, and yet I don't drink them on a consistent basis. Rolling Rock is, I guess, one of the few that I don't mind...maybe?"
"Pours very pale yellow with lots of carbonation and white foam. Aroma basically of nothing.. a little sweetness and no hop character. Taste is very thin. Really meant to be just a purely drinkable and refreshing beer. Nothing complicated or flawed about it. Probably one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. We bought a keg for only $60 for a BBQ and it was perfect for it. Very seltzer like carbonation and taste. If American adjunct lager = drinkable, clean tasting and refreshing then this is what I'm looking for. Otherwise it doesn't really remind me of being beer."
"OK, this beer's not so bad. Not much smell. Fizzy and yellow in appearance. Very grapefruity taste. Not much flavor otherwise. Goes down pretty easy. Light and fairly smooth. For what it is, it's not horrible. Better than a Bud Light, in my mind."
"This beer isn't all that bad. Granted it pours a boring yellow, has not head, and smells like grains. BUT the taste isn't too terrible...for a macro. It's smoother than BMC products and has a little maltier taste, not just corns and grains. Cheap enough to buy a ton at a time and good for just hanging around after you've had some quality micros."
"Not recommended..."
"This isn't the worst beer out there. But there are definitely a lot better."
"This beer is pretty drinkable, but that is all it has going for it. There is simply nothing there that I can pinpoint and say, ""You know, that is nice."" It is completely underwhelming, with no nice finish and a boring appearance. I was excited when I bought this because of all I have heard about it, but I was just disappointed upon drinking it."
"Drinkability - I'm sure if I wanted to 'get fucked up man!' I could down a bunch of these really fast and then puke and pass out. Considering I don't drink beer for that purpose, the drinkability is low because for me to want to drink more it must be sensually pleasing."
"Not really much in terms of atmosphere. A kind of generic flavor, and light palette. Serviceable quaff."
"Better to look at than to actually put in your mouth."
"1st review."
"D- Full marks here! I wouldn't be upset at all if this was the choice of beer to enjoy for an evening with friends or as a thirst quencher. Good all purpose brew and a notch above the other American Macros that I've had."
"Skipping down to the taste, this beer is really easy to drink and its served super cold which is a plus with this beer...others not."
"If offered a Rock at a party or festive gathering, I'd certainly not turn it down and would drink one of these over a Bud Light if that was all there was. But later, when the host wasn't looking, I'd surreptitiously steal a glimpse of the fridge contents to see what, if any other choices there might be. You may want to try one. Go ahead; it's certainly not bad. Just don't expect a whole helluva lot. It's cold, yellow, foamy and bubbly so it's beer. However you want to spin that"
"Now that I've tasted Rolling Rock, I hope never to do so again. It's not so bad that it's undrinkable, but I would rather drink Bud for its cheaper price."
"A very light straw color pour,with a thin white head that quickly fades to nothing. The aroma is a light grain smell with a hint of citrus and noticeable sweetness. Nothing special, but not offensive. The taste is light, crisp, and refreshing. A touch of sweetness and a hint bitterness is all you get, but it finshes very clean. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing as well.Easy to drink several at one sitting."
"One of my go to beer. This is one of the back up plans when the liquor store doesn't have a particular brew or the bar isn't serving my preference."
"This one pours a light golden color and smells of faint sweet malt. The taste is bit watered down but not nearly as offensive as other American macro lagers. I used to drink this a lot when I was younger but now it seems only good for washing down food as an alternative to soda or water."
"This beer pours a clear straw color. The head is an inch and a half in height, and recedes rather slowly into good lacing for this style. The aroma is of malty sweetness, with hints of caramel and graininess. The taste is very bold for an adjunct lager. There is a nice mix of graininess and caramel. The mouthfeel is a little fuller than light bodied, with appropriately high carbonation. Overall, this is a very good American Adjunct Lager that I could happily drink again."
"Clear yellow with a frothy white head. This beer always smells skunked. Corn, sweat, and skunky river water. They must be importing the disgusting water from Latrobe, PA. Corny, sugar water, and rice in the taste. Later. And no, I don't care what ""33"" means."
" i'm not really sure how it was soo easy to drink these back in ""the day""."
"... not sure why this is considered a step up."
"Not a good beer. I agree with other comments. The beer is overpriced. It is not flavorful, and one would might be hard pressed to distinguish it between a keystone or beast. It is light, and out of a bottle. If those are a beer drinker's only qualifications, this is a good beer. Otherwise, its a definite pass."
"Rolling Rock is the epitome of what I dislike about a lot of macros. To be fair, there are plenty I do enjoy in the proper context. Even though there is a supposed mystique to RR, it's bland, corny flavorless reality I find especially offensive, since it typically sells for a dollar of more per bottle than similar products. It has an aroma that smells faintly of industry & a taste that should only come out of frat keg."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day, really, especially because I like corn. I would recommend this beer if fresh corn is out of season."
"Fairly drinkable as a macro, would drink this over the big name stuff like Budweiser and Miller."
"I don't want to put this brew down too much, because I do enjoy it, especially when it's on sale. Here in SoCal, we're lucky to find it for $8.99 a twelver, as I did yesterday. Along with PBR and High Life, I like to have a nice stock of this in the garage fridge as a base for when I can't afford the better beers-- it's light, refreshing, and has a bitchin' bottle. At least that hasn't changed."
"You certainly could down a lot of this stuff. That's drinkable right?"
"D= I could drink a whole bunch of it since it tastes like water but it wouldn't be enjoyable. It's very strange how much like water it tastes like... perfect for getting really really really drunk but that's not really what beer is about I guess."
"The taste is light and crisp with a lot of pungent grain/corn with hints of grass and apple. It's rather sweet with only a brief, faint hint of bitterness. It's pleasant and easy to drink. I've heard it's nasty when warm, but I didn't let it warm."
"Pretty standard appearance. Bright golden, crystal clear. Some lively carbonation and a thin fizzy head without much retention and minimal lacing. Smells pretty subtle, with little to nothing sticking out. Pretty clean, pale malts with a bit of grain. Tastes pretty nice for the style. Again, pale malts with some grain. A hint of caramel sweetness and light biscuit essence. Touch of earthy hops. Mouthfeel is light and pretty crisp. This beer goes down quite well with little fuss from me. Seems to get low scores as most Macros do around here...that doesn't keep me from being honest."
"Pours a pale golden color with relatively no head, not the most attractive of beers. Smells of slight sweetness reminiscent of artificially flavored water. Light and bold taste of alcoholic water with stinging carbonation and somewhat dry finish with some veggie flavors. A weak beer with no personality to speak for it."
"Oldie but a goodie--here goes... unabashedly transparent--resembles table water... champagne-like pale yellow--as light as a beer could look? Head swiftly settles.... metallic, pungent pilsner malts... nothing of a ""bouquet""... champagne-like scents here too? Fizzy, almost seltzer body and a gassy, heavy end at the throat; watery at the tongue... ""extra pale"" = a woody, old almost annoying skunk--not quite what I remember from college life! Once magical, quaint and familiar, Rolling Rock just pales in comparison to almost anything else I now drink... oddly reminiscent of Keystone Light, ending with a grapey sweetness and a woody corrugation down the throat... lamentably, not much good to say...."
"I've had so many bottles of Rolling Rock in my life I can't even begin to imagine. Besides having a bad ass painted bottle, it is one of the most drinkable beers in my opinion. Sure it may be lacking on taste or appearance, but damn is it smooth and drinkable. Much better than a Coors/Bud for the same price.. so go for this one."
"The original green bottle from the Latrobe team in Missouri. Out of the bottle this one was a clear, pale yellow with a white head of froth about a finger thick. Fizzed out quickly and left little lacing. Aromas of dry grains, some light hops and a bit of green apple sweetness. Better than I remembered. Sadly, the flavors were what I recalled, corn and dry grains, weak pale malts and a funkiness I don't care for. Light bodied and fizzy mouthfeel. Better than some of the other American macro beers but that really isn't saying much."
"It is what it is. Transparent, zero lacing and head retention. So not too much to look at and nothing to right home about. It smells kinda like beer. There are several macro american lagers that offer a unique flavor, this one's unique flavor is a lingering after taste that tastes not so much like beer but more like unfiltered pond water. With all that said, I'm sure it is beer and it does get the job done in certain situations. I buy it now and again because I like the look of the bottles. It seems to say to me ""I'm just an old fashioned beer looking for some clean wholsome fun"" When I'm in the same mood, it gets the job done. Cheers!"
"Considering it's price and that it's made by AB it could be a lot worse. Golden color, light hops, grainy, grassy flavor, pretty watered down but not foul tasting. A good one for mowing the lawn or sluggin' on the golf course. Nothing more than that."
"I was on a bit of a rolling rock kick back in college. Cheap and tasted better than most common lagers. Grabbed a cold single on my way out of the store, got home and here we are. I like the funkiness associated with this beer. Faint stale aroma, pale golden yellow with so-so head and a touch of lacing. Smooth and quenching with that odd taste. So long old friend."
"A pleasant surprise! I was fully expecting Rolling Rock to be unpalatable like a Michelob Ultra or something."
"This was passed out at the hotel i stayed at in Disneyland,free beer and snacks for 2 hr's,thank god it was free,cause there's nothing here to my liking,pale clear yellow with lots of bubbles,thin white head that was gone in a blink of an eye and lacing,what lacing.Nose was of corn and grains,mild skunk,taste was exactly the same as nose with some sour mash and little bitterness,went down like some flavored water,very week,nothing here,i guess you can't complain when it's free."
"It's a strange pallette to knock down, it's flavours are bizarre, medicinal, and yet refreshing. I don't quite get it. Usually I would not enjoy something like this, but now I actually like this beer.whatever I guess..."
"."
"D: Not horrible, but just not a beer I had fun drinking, pass."
"Goes down smooth enough but it's pretty meh."
"D- It's odd, but this may be one of the better american macro lagers out there. As odd as the aftertaste is I sortof like it. The green bottle worried me, but with how low of hop flavor is in this I doubt there is much worry of skunking."
"Refreshing, light and inexpensive."
"Don't have much to say about this one (although I will ask why it is that I seem to be reviewing so much macro crap lately...have I lowered my standards or are the gas prices just getting to me?). This beer truly has the least flavor of any I've ever consumed. There is literally a mere hint of grain and malt, and you have to sit there for like ten minutes swishing around with a stupid look on your face trying to find it. It looks like crap, straw yellow, and the body is nothing. I could drink like 400 of these if I was desperate to get drunk on water (but I'm no longer in college, so that's less likely). It's not good, but it's got so little flavor, that it's really not that objectionable either."
"Drinkability: My lager thumb points down! Drink it cold and quick if you insist on drinking it at all."
"This is the beer that started it all for me. It definitely is extra pale as the name implies. Smells a little skunky. Never really retains any head. Usually keeps a nice rim around the top with a little lacing. Tastes sour with not alot of flavor. VERY easy to drink. Very light. Now that I've moved on to bigger and better beers, I won't visit this one often, but when I do, it's always enjoyable. Especially on a hot day."
"This is my basic fallback when i am at my local townie bar and don't feel like a Sam Adams. Pours super clear the head disappears as quicky as poured mountain dew. The smell is a bit off with some corn essence but not enough to offend. Taste is the pretty basic macro lager flavor but something different about it that i enjoy.Goes down fairly quickly and smooth. Good lawn mower or fallback beer but, in order for it to be a regular for me there really must be nothing else around."
"D - Better than most macros, if only because the flavor is a little bit different. Easy to drink with virtually no bitterness, I'll always have a soft spot for Rolling Rock when I have to reach for some swill."
"Apperance very pale and good luck keeping a head on this one. Smell some sweet malt no hops. Taste very light sweetness no hops. Mouthfeel high carbonation thin body. Drinkability no offensive flavors great club soda substitute. You wont find this one in my fridge anytime soon."
"This is a simple beer with a clean non-offensive flavor. It has a very pale light golden yellow color with a white foamy head. The flavor is a mix of light malty grains and mild hops. It has a super clean finish with a light body and a thin but lively texture and carbonation. Overall it's an extremely refreshing and drinkable beer that's great for sloppy bbq and spicy food. Non-beer drinkers may also enjoy this brew especially if offered in cut little split bottles."
"Oh the rock. I remember once upon a time I purchased a twelve pack of you... Never again. I now find your color pale and unattractive. Your smell reminds me of my dirty dishes. The taste is bitter and unmemorable. The feel is light and stings my tounge with carbonation. Oh well, I gues I'll just have a water."
"Overall, worse than I remember it from before I was a BA."
"Think of any American style lager brewed by a big company (Bud, Coors, etc.). Now drink Rolling Rock. In this comparison Rolling Rock wins hand down. BUT it does have many of the failings of its counterparts. Near no aroma, harsh mouthfeel, and par with regards to its golden appearance. A slightly sweeter and slightly more robust flavor when compared to Bud and others, but still nothing I'd champion as my favorite beer. Drinkability gets a 4 because you can put down an entire 12 pack and not even think about it."
"Overall: After mowing a lawn great, but as a real drink it for the taste and nothing else beer no. It has a place. I assume but not on my shelf."
"M + D: Like carbonated water, for the most half. Nothing spectacular going on, and kind of bland in the sense of feeling. Easy to suck back as long as it's cold, but I don't think I'd give this much consideration on a warm day, as the offtastes don't take long to become a bit much. Not something worth doing again, but not really horrible swill, either."
"The one thing I can give RR is that it's a decent summer brew if you're outdoors in the hot, sweltering heat. If you serve it cold enough it can be quite refreshing, though I'd never drink it for taste..."
"I will def have this beer again, not because its awesome, but because its a cheaper beer that i enjoy"
"Poured to a very very light yellow. With a nice head that was white. Head didnt last long. There was a trace of lacing, but that was all it was, was a trace. Had a corn smell also a hint of sweet. Not really a lot of smell to it. Had a sweet taste and a slightly bitter metallic aftertaste. Felt okay in the mouth. Carbonation was a little to much. Also felt watery. If you got this brew ice cold perhaps you could drink a few of these. The warmer the beer got, the more of a bitter aftertaste was evident."
"Crisp and thin with a somewhat watered down feel and moderate/high bubby/effervescent carbonation. Slightly dry and husky in the finish. This brew's only saving grace, as far as I'm concerned, is that it remains the official beer of Heinz Field. For that reason, I will give leeway. Also, there's a lot of history in those glass lined tanks of old Latrobe."
"Felt like picking up a cheap pounder 12-pack but didn't want to stoop too low. Rolling Rock is a decent lawnmower beer with a slightly different flavor profile than the other macros."
"What you'd expect...a good beer for a hot sunny day."
"Not recommended..."
"I'm not very wild about it, nor am I cursing its existence. It reminds me of a hybrid of Budweiser and Tsingtao (which are part of the AB family of beers. Coincidence?) It's merely okay, nothing's telling me to hijack the rest of my friend's 12-pack."
"pours a very pale yellow color, not much color to it at all, small white head, not a real impressive looking beer. Smell is like a sweet corn smell, not skunky has some decent attributes. taste is weak, what little taste there is isn't bad, but there just isn't enough to make the beer have some soul to it. mouthfeel is very watery. its an ok beer"
"Drinkability- Here is the deal: I drank one of these from the can and it wasn't to bad. It was great with the pizza, and refreshing. Poured into a glass, however, like in my opinion, beer should be reviewed, it turned into a terribly watery slew. From the can, these is a great session brew, but in a glass.. ouch."
"Color is a clear straw-yellow, typical of a lager, not very promising. Aroma is weak and has the typical lager bite to it. Flavor is about average, not impressive but still drinkable. This is not a spectacular beer, but acceptable if nothing else is available, or if you want to focus on something other than your brewski."
"Freshman year of college, this was my beer of choice. Nothing too special, just your typical macro lager, only lighter and crisper. I think the crispness is what I originally found refreshing about it. In the summer when you want a change from the typical macro, this is a good choice."
"It is very pale, as the name would imply; has a faint hint of a straw-yellow to it. Smells a bit sour and bready. taste is not exactly pleasant, a bit of an unpleasant bite to it."
"D: Not exactly easy to drink, mostly because of the slight sour taste. Although, I wouldn't say it's undrinkable, it's good if your looking for something a little different."
"Smell slightly sweet, but much like most pilsner styles you will find. Sugar, corn and rice adjunct flavors dominate the palate upon sipping, along with an almost overly sweet character. Not tart like Budweiser or Miller, but sweet and tinny. Carbonation is medium and not overpowering. Tastes, for lack of better descriptive terminology, like it has been aged in an aluminum casket filled with pennies for about 30 years. Leaves a tinny malt residue on the tongue and mouth. Just too sweet. Will not buy again. D-."
"D: A drinkable beer, but only because it is so watery. The taste of this beer is debatable, but it is not so bad. This beer definitely makes Coors Light look like a bock. Not recommended at all."
"Kinda weak, watery colour with a minimal hoppy smell. Tastes bitter in a bad way. Not easy to get down, had me trying to get it down quickly."
"Well, there are worse macros out there, but even in style, this is lacking. Not undrinkable, just fizzy and bland."
"D - This was a disappointing beer bad smell and taste this beer really reminds me of a malt liquor so if you like them give this a try"
"Light yellow body, nice hoppy aroma, poors clear with a small head that goes away quickly. body was thin with soft carbonation, flavor was not memorable except for how watery it was, initial taste missing, lightly sour short finish. A slightly better than average Macro."
"I like this beer, easy to drink, fairly cheap, considering its basically carbonated dirty water. Buy it, drink it."
"D: It doesn't taste or look fantastic, but it's pretty easy to drink and can be refreshing. It's a little better, or at least different, than most of the super mainstream macros."
"It poured with a very pale yellow color with a small white head. Surprisingly, the head retention was quite good. It smelled of mild grains and slight skunkiness. The taste was mild and agreeable, a clean lager taste with corn and cooked vegetables on the finish. It drinks easily and is a decent inexpensive beer. It's one of the better macro lagers out there."
"Norman Chad, you can keep your pet beer. Hideous."
"Rolling Rock is more along the lines of a BMC brew. It isn't a bad brew, it is very drinkable and finishes quite nicely. A little malty on the palate, but still a more decent choice than big market brews."
"drinkability  from what I read by AB moving and using NJ water, it doesn't taste the same. I wouldn't know. Thought I would try it."
"D: The low ABV and clean finish make this an acceptable macro that could be used for hydration on a hot sticky summer day."
"Overall, not a beer I can give a thumbs-up to. The Rolling Rock that I fondly remember from back in the day is now nothing but a watery, tasteless shell of its former self. Sad."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Intriguing-though the beer looks as if the carbonation itself is trying to escape this God awful beverage....it wishes no more to be in that beer than I wish that beer to be within my sight, it knows it damned to the CO2 beer hell....poor little carbonation bubbles...anyway, the beer seems to the point where it is on its way to going flat, low carbonation for the style. Exta Pale, Extra light, Extra water. Easy as hell to drink, but I won't be drinking this again less I want to be like a high class Herb, Frat Boy, Fratty and drink this prized possession only on special occasions to get drunk, cause we all know that this is one hell of a beer."
"Extremely pale. Lots of visible carbonation. Medium white head which recedes quickly. Aroma is grassy hops with some sweetness. Little taste to speak of. Sweet again with a touch of herbal hops. Not offensive or bad- just not much at all. Light watery mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable. Pretty standard macro overall."
"I drank tons of this beer over pizza with friends when I was getting my bachelor's degree, and nostalgia definitely plays a part in why I still drink this beer. It's not all nostalgia, however, as it really is pretty good. Not every beer has to be a huge hop monster, or a deeply complex Tripel. Sometimes you just want a pleasant tasting, light, refreshing, easy to drink beer, and Rolling Rock always pleases, in this regard. It's not Chimay or La Fin Du Monde, but that just isn't what this kind of beer is trying to be. A keeper beer, in my opinion."
"I was not that impressed with this beer. Overall it is fairly light but at the same time it has a skunky aftertaste to it. Not the worst beer I have had but surely one that might be on a list of last choices to drink. Overall it was not very expensive, more expensive than Bud, but cheaper than Corona."
"poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, pours very pale yellow with a small white head. smell is hardly detectable just a slight aroma of sweet malts and grain. taste is pretty bland just a typical macro lager. this is a very light and easy to drink beer."
"Enjoy"
"Overall, there's not alot to this beer, but not alot wrong with it either. I've certainly had worse macro lagers, so I don' think this one is too bad. If kept cold, it's crisp and refreshing, and easilly drinkable. If you enjoy macros, give it a try."
"Drinkability : bière avec peu de personnalité, mais très rafraîchissante"
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer for a change of pace. A lighter macro."
"Pours a very clear yellow with a short white head. The smell is very pale, like it says. Not much going on except hints of very light malts. The aftertaste is a bit bitter. The malt does not really hide the bitter hops aftertaste, and not a good hoppy aftertaste. Almost skunk like in nature. The carbonation is nice, but thats the only saving factor. If drinking with hot and spicy food, not bad, but other than that, not too good."
"Overall I'd say a very simple easy drinking lager, I didn't mind it. I don't think I would go out of my way to get this but if offered I don't think I'd turn it down."
"a run of the mill light beer. when you are in the mood for about a hundred beers, this will do. prefer this over bud/miller. i drink only in summer. great cheap warm weather beer."
"Pours a pale straw color with a minimum of head, even after pouring into the middle of the glass. What was there faded to a microthin layer. Smells a little yeasty, and a lot estery/fruity. The taste is smooth and a little sweet and fruity, some pear and a little passionfruit. There's also just enough bitterness there to finish clean, but I'm not detecting any hop flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly thick, with some tingling on the tongue, not bad. Overall, a very drinkable beer, especially for a hot day, I think."
"This is one of several lagers I had to endure this weekend. This was one of the better ones and it had a crisp taste to it and was pretty easy to throw a couple of these back. I wouldn't seek this beer out by any means but if it's a place where this is one of a few choices you could do worse"
"I think I am somewhat partial on this beer. It probably is just an old favorite to me because I always found it a little different than all the other popularly available beers out there when I came of drinking age in the 70's. With my now wiser tastes in beer, Rolling Rock does seem well off from the truly quality brews available in today's marketplace, but I still hold a fondness for the taste of this unique offering. It is a clear light gold color with lively carbonation notable and a fair sudsy white head. There is some modest lacing. It smells like liquid cereal/grain. Not terribly complex. The flavor is uniquely suggestive of corn, crisp and tastefully sweet and somewhat dry. It leaves a mild bitterness in the back of the mouth. It is well carbonated and is generally quite refreshing. A light lager but still carrying a solid flavor that accents this odd corn flavor as I like to describe it. I think this is what typically turns the average drinker away. I know few admirers of Rolling Rock yet Busch bought it for some good reason (maybe the light beer?). I remain a minor fan although not sure I can entirely defend that position. A shame to have RR leave Latrobe."
"Very light in appearance, ""extra pale"" as the name suggests, with large-sized bubbles from carbonation. Little head with little retention. Hard to detect aroma. Taste is strange... somewhat floral, though not as interesting as that sounds. Very light mouthfeel, leaving a slight bitter aftertaste, though again not at all intriguing. If I'm having a macro lager, I don't know that I'd choose this one."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a nice head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is sweet and there's little if any skunk.Taste is the typical macro lager. Not too sweet with some residual bitterness at the back of the tongue. Just nothing impressive but nothing bad either."
"American Pale Lagers or Macro-lager is pretty much a beer group that is for people that like to get drunk, but do not enjoy the flavor of beer. This is better than Bud or Miller, but nothing that you are going to really enjoy or savor. This beer is made for pounding one after another. No remarkable characteristics with this beer. Kind of skunky overly carbonated. Watery."
"If there are any strikes against it its that they use green bottles (yes, I know that Rolling Rock's history is tied to the green bottle) and the 6-er gets packed the standard way (instead of covered to keep light out.) I did notice, however, that the 12-er comes in a box. The other said thing is to see ""St. Louis , Mo.""on the bottle where ""Latrobe, PA"" used to be."
"Drinkability: Not too bad, all things considered."
"A step above the big BMCs, although I understand this is now affiliated with A-B, so that may change. The most intriguing thing about this beer is the 33 on the back of the green bottle. Besides that, it is a typical American Pale Lager, with little aroma or flavor, and a finish that is thrist quenching if drunk cold on a hot day, but not much beyond this. Fortunately, it also did not have the grainy aroma of many BMCs, which is why I rated it slightly higher."
"D- Maybe a good choice to cleanse your palate or cool off with after mowing lawns, but not very drinkable overall. It just has the light sugar and rice or corn taste you don't want to taste repeatedly."
""
"Eric"
"Had this at my local Moe's tonight along with a steak Homewrecker Burrito. It complemented the spicy flavors of the burrito quite well, but I think the appeal was due to the fact that it made me want to eat more. After I was done with the burrito, the beer became much harder to drink, taking on a very sour taste and skunky smell. I think if this beer were consistently cold it would be great, but it gets difficult to finish after even 15 minutes with the stuff..."
"Rolling Rock Extra Pale was a very pale yellow color with good clarity. It had a bubbly white head with decent retention and left a little lacing behind. The smell was very light with a little grain. The taste was light as well with a little grain and a dry finish. It was light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was average. It might be better outside on a really hot day."
"man, a painted label? GLASS-lined tanks? this was primo shit back in the day...another pale, fizzy yellow macro lager...some metallic/vegetal notes to go along with the adjunct aromas. light, fizzy, and almost tasteless except for the adjuncts. but man, that's a cool bottle, and they use glass-lined tanks! this beer nust have been much better a looong time ago."
"D: Nothing spectacular by ANY means, but if you're outside in the summer, grilling BBQ or listening to baseball on the radio, it'll do."
"D - Non offensive brew. Goes down smoothly. I enjoy it a lot."
"D: A little tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, it’s a decent lawnmower/BBQ beer, but that’s about it."
"Overall, a personal favorite under certain conditions. A perfect lawnmower swill."
"I had one so I could do this review, I won't be having any more soon."
"glad i finally tried it, though i cant help but think it would be better in the states and a bit fresher. or at least with fewer miles under its belt. anyway, one is probably enough."
"D- this is one of the most drinkable beers that doesnt have much of a taste to it. These are extremely easy to throwback."
"overall this is not a beer that i would buy again, it was served very cold and just kinda strange overall"
"edit: lol @ my old review. i was a noob. this beer tastes like sweetmilk water. it's actually one of my least favorite beers i've ever encountered."
"Drinkability: I guess this would be good if this was your style. Personally I think that this is a pretty good example of this style but I dont really care for it."
"Rolling Rock was my brand of choice among macrobrewers for many, many years. I must say that I am highly disappointed at what AB has done to this once stellar beer of formerly western Pennsylvania origin. It maintains its beautiful clear golden appearance, and its smell is still quite clean and refreshing, but its taste suffers. The New Jersey water that AB uses has a most noticeable effect on the taste. There was truly something to the water that Latrobe Brewing Co. used from the Allegheny mountains. All water is different; rock strata, soils, etc. have a lot to do with its ph and chemical composition. ABs NJ water, coupled with something in the formula that appears to make the new RR have more of a rice aftertaste has altered the taste of a once proud beer. It still cleanses the mouth with each swallow, and is very drinkable on a hot day. But still, AB . . . move the operations back to good old Latrobe, PA. Rolling Rock should be stellar, not just serviceable!"
"Drinkability is good. Served ice-cold on an Equatorial Pacific day, it disappears very, very quickly."
"wow i used to really like this beer before AB took over but this is horrible. i sampled it once after the takeover and didn't detect much of a difference, but after deciding to try it again i am severely disappointed. it tastes super skunked and this smell is absolutly horrible. i will not purchase this beer again, i'll say good bye to an old friend that AB killed and thank all things holy that PBR is still available. ;)"
"Honestly, this is one of the least flavorful beers out there. but sometimes that's exactly what you need."
"Most distinguishing quality? It smells lemony, hoppy, and distinct. Warm? Bad. Ice cold? Sometimes it tastes like you just told some broad that ""Baba O'Riley"" is the name of what she insists is ""Teenage Wasteland."" Sometimes it tastes like you just cut the grass,are watching sports,or ate 6 hot wings and asked for water or 7up, and you got something better. I have been told by Northern Spring Breakers that this is nothing special-at all- up North. In 1990s southern college towns, though, this was the go-to-beer for the pizza parlor's philosopher. Find a '90s movie with an Anti-Hero, you will see RR. (I'm talkin' to you, Ethan Hawke.) Now that I am older, I find it at Florida gas stations. At $11+/12pack($6+/6pack) and rising, however, this ultra pale is becoming too expensive for what it is. The mystique has disappeared for all but the biggest fans, and now it is JUST hard enough to find at bars to be annoying. I feel like A-B may keep it around, but it may go the way of RC Cola--- highly-priced on the special shelf for sentimental reasons, not for quality. (As others have said, there is a perceived class to RR that keeps it premium.) All of that said, I LOVE this beer. Still my go-to beer, though, when I just cannot decide."
"I tried this at a beer event. The taste was decent not to bitter kinda of smooth after the first one. The smell was not to bad not very overpowering just a regular beer smell. This is the kind of beer you can take to a party and people will drink it. It will not disappoint but not recommended for a serious beer drinker."
"D - Pretty damn poor excuse for a beer. Dinkable, and slightly better than BMC. It's amazing what marketing can do...most of my friends think that this is a ""classy"" beer."
"Well switched to this last night for a breathier after several heavier beers. The palest yellow imaginable with really no smell at all. Just how I remebered it. ICE COLD this beer is crisp and refreshing, as I told my wife, this was my bottle of water for the evening. Put down a few to cleanse the palate and kill some time. These are always very drinkable when cold, but are never anything truly special, but again it makes good water."
"Pours a clear yellow with a big white foamy head. The head leaves good lacing,but the color is pretty light and weak. The smell is abit of sweet malt and floral aromas,but nothing else. Very weak aroma. The taste has some sweet malt,but really nothing else. It's not horrible,but even other macros are better than this. The m/f is light,weak,watery and really nothing to talk about. This is what I expected,but I really hoped that this was better. A typical college keg party beer."
"Drinkability: got this a holiday mixed beer basket. I never liked it in the past, and trying to review this was difficult because nothing was discernable about it. Pass on this."
"Poured a pale straw color with a puffy white head that dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. Looks a lot like Bud Light. Well carbonated as I can see the bubbles floating to the top. Light sulfer smell, corn like. The taste is of corn, dextrin sweet, finishes dry. Very water feel. Never really liked this beer. If I wanted a cooler beer I would choose a different macro lager."
"I had this beer from someone in Utah. I wasnt that unimpressed for a score of 70. I think more people are using preconceved opinions. The apparence was pretty bad. The smell and taste was pretty well blended. The mouthfeel was decent not bad. All it all it wasn't awful. Don't drink and review."
"This is a drinkable beer, but a typical macro. I'm glad I didn't have to buy a whole 6 pack to try it. I'm wary of the green bottles."
"NOT the same as it ever was. '86 to old 33, will never buy it again."
"In ANY other circumstance, expecially if you are looking for a brew to have with food, this stuff is just too thin, even by American macro standards. Ah, my lost, innocent youth. . ."
"d -- nope."
"Vigorous pour at 37 degrees resulting in quite a bit of foam. Leaving a lot of foam on the sides of glass as it is consumed. Not sure whether to call it lace or not as I'm quenching thirst after yard work and consuming quite quickly. Slight off odor similar to Corona but not as strong. Acceptable to drink but does not require a lot of discussion."
"D = Not very drinkable. Very watery."
"Rolling Rock is usually served very cold,on ice mostly,something to think about."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-n"
"It is so hard to get US beers here in Oz (Bud is a premium here- aahhh{;< ), I imagine it is expensive to ship them all that way. So why the hell did you guys send us this rubbish. give me a VB anyday of the week, now that is an insult. looks like any lawn mower beer, smells like most bad lawn mower beers, but lacks that drinkable quality found in most of these beers."
"Drinkability- Very highly carbonated, I only suggest this beer if you can hurry up and pound it ice cold. If it gets warm it gets undrinkable."
"Good but not that good. It's refreshing when ice cold. And you need to drink it ice cold. When mind warmed up it got nasty as in I couldn't finish it."
"Surprisingly enough, Rolling Rock isn't that bad of a beer. Most of these reviews say that it is awful, but there are many beers that are worse than this. Rolling Rock is very easy to drink, even though it is not my favorite, I still have no problem drinking this whenever available. I guess it all depends on what your preference is."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Prickly, aggressive, extremely harsh on the tongue and it the throat. Big aggressive burps that leave the esophagus reeling. This could be refreshing right out of the bottle on a hot day, otherwise this is borderline undrinkable."
"L ""33"" t it's not..."
"Poured a typical macro pee-yellow. Lots of carbonation, which when combined with very little flavour, I hate. Aroma was... basically nothing. This beer isn't offensive or anything, for the most part (although it does have a little bit of 'corniness' to the flavour), and I wasn't gagging it down -- but it certainly isn't something I'd choose to drink if any micros were available."
"no colour, though some lace.Beer aroma with some bitter smell. Aggressive carbonation, some ingredients, some hop.Thin mouthfeel. Superior to some macros, which isn't saying much. Thanks for contributing Beigaman.I could finish a glass of this, and soda after that."
"drinkability isn't high either. not a fan of this one."
"D: I hate to say it, but now, I'll think about other beers before reaching for a Rock. My brother was way more familiar with RR, and he was really disappointed. AB needs to tinker with the water more and hopefully that will back off some of the foam and balance the flavors, but as is, very disappointed."
"D: This is an old standard for this Penn Stater, giving it a certain nostalgic quality. I hope that the glass-lined tanks of Old Latrobe lager beers really soon."
"A suprisingly not repulsive thirst quencher. Drink it cold."
"Better than some but inferior to most."
"Not that great of a beer and IMO a poor representation of the style. Less flavor than Heineken, believe it or not, and no malt backbone whatsoever. This beer is just straight up water with a bit of alcohol and splash of malt, maybe. Also, i did not like that there was no head in the glass or lacing, but in my mouth it had a champagne feel."
"I have some good memories associated with this beer. My friend in college had this stuff around all the time before and just after my 21st birthday. That was pretty much my macro drinking period (Once I could buy my own beer, the worst stuff I ever liked was Redhook ESB). It beats the big boys for now. We'll see what happens when they get their hands on it."
"We used to bury this beer in the creek bottom where the water was only a foot deep or so. Only the necks stuck up out of the sand. Drinking this beer tonight stirs memories of sneaking beer out of the house and playing in the creek as a young teen. If we could only go back again. So long, Rolling Rock. Thanks for the memories."
"An alright Macro, and one that will live on in our memories."
"Drinkability is the key with this beer. I don't drink this much at all, but it pairs well with hot wings and football in this case."
"D - It is a fine beer for the price, but I no longer rush to buy it. It just doesn't have much flavor to it."
"overall not a a bad beer"
"From the glass lined tanks of old Latrobe. Rolling Rock Extra Pale pours a pale yellow with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle with a screened on label. Smells like adjunct/corn. Tastes like adjunct and maybe the slightest amount of hops. Has a canned vegetable taste as well. Not recommended."
"There are better lagers than this one."
"From the glass lined tanks of Old Latrobe we tender this premium beer for your enjoyment, as a tribute to your good taste. It comes from the mountain springs to you. ""33"""
"It's nothing exciting, and if it's cheap and I'm having a cheap party, I'd buy a few 6-packs. Not a case, because then I'd get laughed at."
"Tried Rolling Rock again and remembered not thinking too highly about it. Yet, the other night, when at a holiday party, the choices were Bud Light, Coors Light, Miller Genuine Draft, and... RR. Went for the RR--served in the ridiculous 7oz baby bottle size. Its apperance and smell leave a lot to be desired -- thin yellow color, fizzy, very little head, no lacing, and a slight trace of the usual skunkiness associated with this beer and Heineken. However, the crisp taste was better than I remembered. Sweet malt comes through, and it's very smooth. Excellent session beer--if you are not looking for taste. :)"
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, thought beer lacks flavor for the most part. Is stomachable however, since aside from the watered-down taste, this beer has no negatives. I'll be sure to buy a six-pack of this when I'm in the mood for a macro brew."
"This beer is an average American Macro Lager. I decided to give it a review from a 12 pakc that was brewed in Latrobe, before AB takes over the production in New Jersey. It is sad to see this strong brand leave Western PA, as it holds a lot of nostalgia and value in the area. With that being said, it is a crisp, clean yellow beer that seems to make most American beer drinkers satisfied. Me, I drink it occasionally in the summer because it is refreshing and local. I don't see myelf drinking it in the future, as a result of the takeover."
"Even though it holds a warm spot in my heart, I cannot recommend this beer. Sorry."
"It is hard to review this beer objectively as I grew up within 100 miles of Latrobe and drank approximately a billion of these before my 25th birthday. This was before it was nationally known, so it was a bit of a rite of passage. It is interesting and different and not a bad lawnmower beer, but that's about it. Well, the painted labels are pretty, too."
"The interesting thing that some people forget about beer is that there are multiple communities of those drinking it. Those who go for complex flavor, aroma, appearance, etc, who typically frown on American Macro brews. Then there are those who drink to get drunk, who look for lighter beers so that more can be drank in a single sitting, and though this isn't a cheap beer, at $9.99/12 it isn't overly expensive, and while the flavor isn't really complex at all, the extreme drinkability of the beer truly makes it a standout in the crowd who drink to get drunk. Interestingly enough, I'm the type of person who enjoys both facets of beer, so I can see the positive attributes on either side."
"A friend left a few in my fridge after a party the other day, so I figured I'd try one. Pours a pale, almost translucent straw color, topped by a flourish of fizzy white head that subsides almost immediately, leaving just a touch of lacing. Aroma of adjunct malt and diacetyl, with a touch of skunkiness thrown in for good measure. Palate is bereft of any significant flavors - very light adjunct malt, some corn, the slightest hint of fruity hops. Body is thin and fizzy. It is refreshing, I'll give it that. Maybe I'll save the others for a heat wave, although I'm not sure aging this beer even a few weeks is a good idea."
"Overall: A pretty bad Euro lager. Avoid."
"Pale straw, with a wispy white head. Pure, unadulterated skunkiness in the aroma. The taste....well, the folks at Old Latrobe are obviously not afraid to put corn in the forefront of their brew. Indeed they flaunt it...corn sweetness on parade. There is a bit of redeeming bitter hops in the taste but not enough to rescue this trainwreck of a beer. I wouldn't turn down a free one, but that's the nicest thing I can say."
"Appearance is just as is should be: pale. Head begins nicely and leaves a nice coat above the beer with a satisfactory amount of bubbling. Smell is different. I'm not sure how to describe the smell, somewhat sweet and malty. This beer tastes much like it smells, somewhat sweet. I have heard people complain that this beer is too sweet. This beer does begin sweet but ends bitter with a short aftertaste that is far from unpleasant. This was my first ""beer love"" from years ago, but drinking it now I wonder what I liked so much about it: it's drinkable. Have 6. Hell, have 18. These things go down easy and taste decent at the same time."
"Not enough primary taste to leave much of an aftertaste."
"This beer is not great, but is not too offensive either so that combined with it's refreshing lightness makes it somewhat drinkable."
"Poured a pale, straw yellow color from a green twelve ounce painted label bottle into a pint glass. Thin foamy white head fell quickly to light thin lacing. Aroma is dominated by a sweet corny maltiness, light on the nose. Taste is very much so like the smell, sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate to heavy carbonation. Every characteristic of this beer is light, nothing over the top in any way. For a macro, this is a solid, refreshing beer that is cheap and easy to find most anywhere. I was afraid that drinking as much Rolling Rock as I have over the years might leave me with a negative bias towards this brew, but I can still appreciate this beer from time to time. Drinkability is exceptional for it's type, great summer day beer, thirst quenching quality appreciable."
"Nice smell is the first thing I noticed about this beer. It has a nice taste kind of sweet and a littl bitter., however i think a lot of the taste might be from the smell as the sesnes work together. The beer cost 3.75 at the bar. Not worth it for the rpice."
"About the only thing this would be good for would be playing some drinking game where you have to drink beer like water - hey, that's pretty much what you'd be doing."
"This is one of the worst. I used to drink these WAY too much back in college. Looks, smells, tastes, feels bland. It may be the very reason I developed a distaste for lagers. I certainly haven't recovered since. As I said, I did drink quite a few of these, thus the 2.0 for drinkability. But if I recall, it was one of the cheapest beers available everywhere I ended up, so that's probably the main reason I had so many."
"Final Statement: Lived up to my expectations, just a bad American macro lager. God bless microbrews. I still have one in the fridge. I'm saving it for a chug."
"My friends despise this beer. I really don't feel the same way. This beer needs to be cold to drink, but it goes down pretty smoothly. This beer is really easy to drink, not to expensive, and i've had worse beers for more money. Not much flavor, a little bit in the way of hops, but mainly grainy."
"This would not even appeal on a blistering hot afternoon, and for me that makes it pretty well not worth drinking,"
"Got the chance to enjoy a bottle on a recent trip south of the border. One of the macro options available at Legend's in Nashville, so wanted something different than Bud/Bud Lite. Pours a clear, pale, light yellow color from the bottle pictured. Small and instantly disappearing white head. Lots of carbonation, visible bubble streams rising up fromm the bottom of the glass. No lacing. Smells like corn and a bit of malt. The taste is crisp and clean. Highly carbonated and feels light on the tongue. Overall, this is drinkable, beats a Bud every time. Comparable to Blue/Kokanee."
"Really maybe I should not rate this bottle seeing that is almost 1 year old on March 31. I really don't think it will make that much difference . I think all this beer lost in that time span is a little of it carbonation. It pours light gold despite the age it still had a white fluffy head. Taste is mostly corn and grainy like. Very light body . Final impression is that this beer is not too exciting. Could be really good on a hot summer day at the beach, but don't appeal to me now on a cold Michigan March day."
"Rolling Rock Extra Pale is not particularly appetizing, but at least its miles ahead of Corona/Bud/Coors - appearance and smell is downright awful, but the taste is innocuous, if nothing else. In fact, I could arguably (guilt-ily enough) see myself drinking this if the stars were aligned just right one day and it a) was cheap, b) available in Canada, and c) I was tired after a long hot day or just hanging out with friends. Beyond that, this beer serves no real purpose, besides perhaps making sure its consumers get their 8 reccomended glasses of water a day."
"Verdict: Not to be a snob, but I think I'd rather drink water than have another Rolling Rock. The market is full of better-tasting domestic macros."
"Had this beer straight from the bottle. Can say much about the appearance since it was from bottle, would imagine a very light colored yellow. The smell was difficult to detect, partly my own fault from drinking it from the bottle, but mostly detectable was tangy hops, with a corny little hint. Taste was the same, really nothing impressive. It states ""extra pale"" which I suppose was correct, but it still wasn't refreshing, even when very cold. Lots of carbonation, takes away from the taste. Light mouthfeel, watery. Not one of my favorites, especially when there are pleanty of other cheap beers that could take it's place that accompliosh the same task."
"Pours a clear, pale, light yellow color with a small and instantly dissolving white head. Much bubble activity is visible in the glass. No lacing whatsoever. Smells like corn and a bit of malt. Little else. The taste is crisp and somewhat clean. It is relatively weak and a bit watery. There is a definite corn presence, with a bit of bitterness at the back of the swallow. R.R. is highly carbonated and light on the tongue. Overall, this isn't the worst you could expect for a macro. Not terrible. Is it drinkable? That depends on other options. It beats BMC, but if this were all that were offered at a gathering, I'd probably volunteer to be the designated driver."
"Cheers!"
"When I came back to taste, I don't think I took long enough. The taste was all to familiar with the vegi un-delight. I couldn't finish it. Flushed right down the sink with the garbage disposal on. Give me Bud or Coors over this."
"This beer is obviously super pale. It looks like there's not much there. I mean White Ales probably pull it off but they have the yeast still in there to give it some body and are pretty good usually. The smell was actually kinda unappetizing but you don't drink this one out of a glass ever and that doesn't matter so much to me usually. The taste was slightly bitter and water and just not good. The mouthfeel was completely watery. The drinkability is slightly higher than other scores because it's super thin. I wouldn't give it that much though cause after having one of these I've got beer - blue-balls. It's like ska music: you think it's going to be good then a horn comes in there and screws it all up."
"D: Easy to drink. No offensive tastes or odors, so it is easy to drink several."
"rest of y'all, rock it if you must..."
"Not bad, but just not much here."
"Some 'bite' to it, but couldn't drink another"
"The brewery website recommends a serving temperature of 33f. The cold temperature allows the beer's attributes to shine. Spicy hops mingle delightfully with the crisp carbonation and mildly sweet maltiness. Finish is crisp and clean, if you finish the bottle while it's still very cold. Lots of adjuncts await you here if you let it warm a bit. A strong essence of canned corn juice may deter your desire to drink this, unless it's almost frozen. A decent American macro light lager, notable for its attractivly painted green bottle."
"I'm not a fan of this style in general. Now I'm just dying for a Corsendonk..."
"The price is also certainly worth noting. Typically, a preferred option or good alternative over Bud, Miller and Coors."
"Drinkability : I would drink this all day, as long as it was Ice cold and I had the money too. Cheap on the pocketbook and readily available in my neck of the woods means this is gonna be in my stable for a long time to come."
"Pours a yellow color, some carbonation, not much of a head, not much lacing afterwards. Scents of malts, and something sweet. The taste is pretty watery and sweet. Light body. Drinkable I guess. I had to just try this again, I use to like it, but my taste has change so drastically that I cannot drink it like I use to."
"I found a sixer of this on sale and said ""what the hell"". This poured golden with a slight dry head. Very grainy smell. This had a somewhat bold mouthfeel, only not in a good way. This tasted like crap beer all the way. I ended up mixing my five remaining bottles with some Tuborg just to make it acceptable. I'm not crazy enough to throw even the crappy stuff away."
"no drinkability. this is terrible."
"Drinkability: This is an ok drinking beer. No thinking, no geeking just drinking action."
"Apperance was pretty average. Its got to be the yellowest most ""macro"" looking beer I actually like to drink. It's real close to Bud in color, even MGD leans a little more towards tan. Head is pretty foamy. It can get pretty tall, but never lasts long. Smell has some sweet, some sour, and a little bit of adjunct. I think the taste is pretty decent. I'm noticing a lot of people complain of skunkieness in this beer. I suspect this is probably due to the green bottle and maybe a tendency of this beer to not travel well. I can't remember ever having a skunky Rolling Rock myself and I can't live much more than a day away from the brewery. Plus I've been misled about the quality of a beer before because it tends to skunk (Heinekin). Anyway the taste is kind of sweet with a little sour background, and a slightly bitter finish. Malt is hard to detect, the adjunt (they say they use corn AND rice on the website) is there it is the least offensive beer I know to contain both of those adjuncts. Ironically, the two most similar beers I've had taste-wise are Heinekin and Becks. Stranger still, I think Rolling Rock tastes better than either of them even though its obviously made with ingredients inferior to theirs (Especially to Beck's). Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. This has to be one of the most heavily carbonated beers I've had. Drinkability is good but not great. It definately slides down easy, it is light and thirst quenching. I can't give it a great drinkability rating though because it is brewed with adjuncts and you can taste them. Though I said they aren't offensive, and they aren't at first, adjunct aftertaste always gets worse the more beer you have. So drinkability isn't ideal. Anyway this is my first choice for a cheap American macro, and I'd offer it as an alternative to Heineken or Becks besides except most people would probably look at me like I'm nuts for suggesting the latter."
"Here's the Rolling Rock secret - do not drink it cold. A warm Rock is a wonderful thing. A cold one is just another average American lager. Warm the aroma is addicting. Rock is an excellent beer when you want to drink a lot. It won't knock your socks off and it has a respectable taste and aroma when warm."
"Overall Impression: A decent session beer, but not much character here."
"Drinkability- It was either this or another random BMC brew. Guess they are all about the same when it comes down to it. It was free though, so I guess I really can't complain. I used to drink this all the time, but no more...unless I really don't have a choice and am craving a beer."
"Average, average, average. Thats all I can say to describe this one."
"I wouldn't buy it again, just not my style of beer at all, and lacks overall good flavor."
"I've heard some people love the ""unique"" taste of Rolling Rock and if that's they're bad, I'm not going to say anything. Just keep this away from me."
"Malty sour apple taste with a dry malty aftertaste. Iced tea sweet, but not tart. Tasted a little flat to me. Best description I can give in terms of taste- Rainier's little cousin. I probably won't drink one of these again unless I have to. You shouldn't either."
"This is a good beer, especially for a domestic macro. It has flexibility to be a year round drink but excels at summer barbecues and is also cheaper than Bud or Coors (I got this 12 pack for $6.99 plus deposit and tax). This is key when those Belgians are costing you the same amount for a bottle and your pals are coming over for the game. Great to fall back on."
"A local favorite in the State College, PA area. This brew pours a color a little bit darker than lemonade. The head dissipates quickly but the carbonation stays strong throughout. The smell is typical of a widely distributed American beer; they claim this is a pale ale, but the hop character is not high enough for a pale. The taste and mouthfeel are average. I enjoy a rolling rock when I am at a standard bar or working around the yard. It is so light; it is a very drinkable session beer."
"Not bad, actually it is good. Very refreshing, but just as that. I mean, it is clear, good lager, very yellow pale asi it says in the bottle. No additives smelling annoying, nor the flavor, but the look is good. No great foam, but there is it. I think is a good lager and maybe too good for a party, but does not quallify for a craft."
"I think this stuff is nasty. I literally rather drink natural ice or natural light than this. First off the apearence of this is the typical piss yellow, ""extra pale"" is how they prefer to characterize though. The smell is nothing particularly inviting and neither is the taste. It consist of a sweet kind of nasty fruity flavor which doesn't appeal to my palate. The mouthfeel is light and very carbonated. Why not buy Yuengling, in bottles, for only a few bucks more?"
"I had this on tap at a local bar. At first I thought it was quite tasty but after awhile I realized it wasn't anything special. I would rather pick MGD over this brew. It is however a good choice if you want an alternate to the big three but there are better beers out there then this."
"Another lager much similar to anheuser busch family, with adjoints of grains (rice again), its taste make feel like a beer with sugar, its appearance is poor, its smell too, taste not recommended, mothfeel and drinkability down by standard. this beer is good for the new drinkers or youths in his age of take a beer."
"In fairness, it is clean, crisp and thirst quenching on a hot day and is very drinkable as long as it's as cold as possible."
"Poured a pale yellow color with a head of foam that dissipated very fast. The only thing I could smell, was something like corn malt and nothing else. It tasted like an average macro lager (light malt taste), but it is better than some other macros. The mouthfeel was light and watery. It has good drinkability if you can get it cheap. It's a better substitute for a cheap drink if their is nothing better around."
"Drinkability - It's not extreme on any of bad points, which should mean it goes down easy. But I think the smell of stomach acid just turns my stomach off to it. Not terrible, but not good."
"Drinkability: Not very."
"I used to drink this beer regularly, now i remember why I don't anymore. Looks brilliantly clear straw--like bad water. Overly carbonated and great head retention- because I keep shaking it. Smells grainy, cereally, vegital, and has a bad yeast bite. Tastes corn-like, with hints of rice, oats, and other adjucts. Thinly sweet and astringent in the throat. Has a boarderline skunk aroma throughout-light striken hops. Lacks grain, hop, and alcoholic complexity. Finishes skunk flavored and carbonated. Not a good beer, especially for the inflated price."
"Pours pale gold with one finger head. Clear, with moderate lacing. Hint of sweet malt aroma. Balace of taste leans towards an adjunt malt, possibly corn. Refreshing, with good level of carbonation and mildy sweet aftertaste. Very smooth, a session beer. Old Latrobe ""33"" gives you a buzz and quenches your thirst at a low price. The quintessential lawnmower beer."
"More drinkable than other macro lagers but not one I'd care to have more than one of. Had outside on a hot day, this beer quickly warmed up and fizzeled out to a bland, watery, stale bread type lager."
"Yes, I admit it: I am guilty. I like to have a Rolling Rock from time to time. It is very pale, light tasting and smelling, but I like its very smooth mouthfeel. It changes me from the habit of drinking harder stuff. Rolling Rock may be a good choice to have when eating red meat (steak) or pizza. Since it doesn't have a strong taste, it doesn't hide the meal taste."
"Holy crap, this used to be my deck brew, until I started quaffing the good stuff. Now I find this stuff just doesnt cut it anymore. An ol fizzy yellow brew, no head. Corn and just a touch of malts in the aroma and taste. Big carbonated brew to hide the shortcomings. Barely OK, but loads of better ones out there."
"Appearance is transparent pale gold with a rich white foam that leaves sticky lace. Aroma is redolent with gentle hops, soft malt and dextrin. Initial taste is comprise of sweet malt, barley and citrus hops  then the parade of yeast by products kick in with brussel sprouts, corn, grains and sulphur. Finish is pleasant and refreshing as long as it is kept nicely cold. Nothing special."
"The appearance is rather uninspiring, a pale watery yellow with a whispy short-lived head. It is ""extra pale"" so you can't expect too many visual fireworks here. The nose is hoppy, with a little mustiness that seems more pronounced from this can than from the bottles. Taste is hoppy with a hint of citrus. Body is light, and high carbonation makes it refreshing and easy to drink. As it warms it gets a little skunky so it's recommended to drink while as cold as possible. Still my favorite macro lager, I don't have a problem putting a few back, usually when I pick some up for the girlfriend as it's her favorite beer. At around $5.50 for a 6er, not a bad deal either."
"Cheers"
"Light yellow that bubbles so much you'd think it was champagne. Frothy white head that faded quickly and smeared. A really faint bread on the nose but nothing significant. A bit of hops on the tongue but really light and not very tasty. A second bottle was a bit warmer and not palatable at all. The carbonation was a bit too much and I don't consider it drinkable. Not revolting but something I'd only do on the hottest of days, served in the colded of manners."
"This beer needs to be drunk cold. As it warmed, it did get corny. However, if you're at a party, and all they have is this in an ice chest, do not be afraid!"
"Pours a pale stray yellow with a thin fizzy head. The aroma keeps saying corn. If I had a blindfold on, I would swear they I was smelling a can of creamed corn. The taste is not nearly as bad as the smell, clean and refreshing. A good ""lawnmower beer""."
"poured a light amber color with large white puffy headthat rapidly fell. Smell is slightly sweet with a mild malt scent. Taste is very light with nothing offensive to note. Mouthfeel is nothing to speak of. Easy to drink on a hot day to really quench your thirst"
"This isn't a bad beer when taken into consideration that it's 1- a macro, and 2- It's not trying to be something it's not. A simple lager, nothing more, nothing less. Poured out to a decent yellow color with a thin head. No lace around the glass noted. Slight odors of corn and hops were present. Flavor was consistant with smell, mainly overtones of hops and corn, with a touch of barley. Could be a decent session beer for the warmer months of the year. Worth a try."
"Overall, Rolling Rock isn't a bad beer; it's a cut above the typical macro lager, and a just-below average beer overall. In the end, though, one can easily sum up the Rolling Rock experience with, ""At least it's better than Bud."""
"EDIT: Changed the scores since having more at a later date, and altered the review."
"This beer is nothing. In this case that is good. I dunno does it taste anything? Barely. Looks sorta bad. Smells sorta bland but it is kinda sweet. This is a simple beer, not much to say about it. No real flavor to comment about. If you want to get smashed with no pain at all this is your beer. Drink it down. Similar to water. And holy crap i admire someone (todd) that can review this beer and say ""dry with a dextrin sweetness and husk tannins."". That is amazing. Someone inform me of these husk tannins. All i taste is watery ass. And what is a husk tannin."
"One thing I don't like about Rolling Rock is how its bottle condescends to me. ""We tender this premium beer for your enjoyment, as a tribute to your good taste."" Don't patronize me. By the way, what does ""33"" mean?"
"There's no real taste, no real body, no real smell, no real color. It's basically flavored water, and you won't catch me buying this again any time soon. To think I actually enjoyed this junk back in HS and college. Ok, maybe I didn't enjoy so much as imbide. Unless you no access to any other beer (in which case you don't know what beer tastes like), there's no reason to buy Rolling Rock."
"This is not what I want out of a session beer."
"Caution: If you are a fan of heavier English and European beer you may mistake this for an Aquafina. You will only be able to distinguish the Rolling Rock from the Aquafina by the package. After pouring them into glasses there is no way to tell!"
"Pale straw yellow with a small fizzy head. Smells like sweet corn and grains. Very light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Corn Corn and more Corn!! Way to much corn adjunct flavor for me. Some grains and soft hops are present though. This beer is nothing but your average american adjunct lager. Next!"
"To me it's basically bubbly water that tastes like there's something wrong with it."
"If you can drink this for a dollar a bottle, it is worth it as long as you can't get a Bud for that price."
"There was a term we used to use in the Navy, it called K.I.S.S. I am sure you know that it means Keep It Simple Stupid. That is what i feel Rolling Rock to be. A simple to drink cheap beer. Not very complex, it has a decent color to it and smells ok. It will pour with a 1 , close to a 2 finger head depending on how you pour it. It leave some lace which is more than i can say for comparable beers of this type. It does taste better to put it in a glass, frosty ones are nice. So if you want a nice session beer that won't get you to hamered and you are low on cash go with Rolling Rock. Als the 33 is on the bottle because when the brewers decieded as to what would be on the bottle they put a 33 at the end because they were to be charged per word. The 33 was not originally supposed to be there. However the bottle maker put the 33 on the bottle. After paying for the bottles, they could not return them So thery kept it."
"Taste was actually fair, not my style but not as offensive as I feared it might be. Didn't really taste like much, honestly I would have guessed it was a pilsner. The type of beer I used to scrape change together to buy in 12-packs, but better than a 12-pack of Keystone-ilk for sure. Had an extremely fizzy mouthfeel with no aftertaste, I ended up putting down about 4 of these though while having a grand ol' time kicking a** on the 100' slot car track. I felt exactly the same when I left as when I walked in, so I'd rate this as somewhat drinkable, I guess. Either way, it fit the trailer-parkNASCAR atmosphere for the event."
"Pours especially pale with no head and minimal lacing. Nice swirling bubbles portend a highly carbonated beer. Smell is sort of a sickly cut grass odor. For some reason I have always had a hard time drinking this beer -- too acidic at the back of the throat. For some reason the cool green bottle always made this an attractive beer to get when I was younger, but now that I have experienced more, the appeal is negligable. For the same price, I would recommend picking up Molson Canadian if this style of beer is what you like"
"Drinkability and Overall: I live about 45 minutes from Latrobe, so it's pretty common around here. As for me is another adjunct lager. Skip this one."
"Ahh rolling rock one of my old staple beers. Pours out light straw colored with a minimal one finger head. Head doesnt hang around very long. Smell is a sweet stank that most macro lagers have {until i found good beers i thought that smell was just normal}.Taste was typical adjunct lager with a hint of alcohol in there , no hops. I cant believe I used to drink these all of the time.At least its better than bud."
"Drinkability - I actually gave it a 4.5 in this category because it's definitely a good session beer (i.e. beer you drink to get drunk, not to enjoy the bouquet and delicious flavor) Can drink 12 of these easily with little to no hangover."
"A cool bottle, and the fact this is a smaller brewery in PA (in comparison to BMC) do little to save this one. A good beer to have if one is out to just pound away mass quantities and get sloppy drunk, but little other redeeming qualities."
"Deffiantly a great session beer. I could drink these all day ;o) especially on a warm summer day."
"Two, Rolling Rock was sold and is now brewed in Newark, NJ far from the glass-lined tanks at Old Latrobe and the beer suffers even more. They gutted the factory and almost killed the town, may those who made that decision rot."
"Poor college student that I am, I bought this on sale for $8.99 a 12 pack. Not a bad deal when you consider the other beers you can find in the same price range. Appearance is a pale yellow color with an average-sized, dishwatery head. Smell is pretty good for an adjunct lager. Aroma is grainy and strong, and doesn't suffer from adjunct off-smells. Taste is decent, primarily light-bodied grain flavors. Finishes sweet, which is a plus. This is fairly drinkable as lawnmower beers go, something I'll buy when it's on sale."
"Definitely worse brews out there."
"had the misfortune of trying this beer. was reccomended by a man who is not banned from making beer suggestions. what looks like a norma, seamingly innocent beer from the outside, quickly turns into a dispair of bitterness. bitterness overall isnt always bad, but this overt biterness is excessive. and no real flavor to help mask the bitter, making it almost undrinkable."
"This is a marginally drinkable beer. None of its characteristics are very enjoyable, but none are terrible. I would choose this beer over Bud, Miller, or Coors anyday, but I would not really enjoy it. It tastes kind of like grain and kind of like corn. There is a slight malt taste as well. This beer does go down easy, but that is all I can really say about it."
"Not a great beer, but an all right one that I suppose I could take if no micro was available."
"If there are no good micros on hand, this isn't bad enough to order a Bud/Miller/Coors. Otherwise, there isn't much point to it. For a cheap fizzy lager, it's really not too bad. If in need of a cheap macro to make up the numbers in my fridge on gameday, this wouldn't be the worst choice. Not much use for it otherwise, though."
"In a beer deprived state such as West Virginia, I'm usually confronted with a slew of bland mass produced lagers. Rolling Rock is one of my favorites from that limited selection, it pours a pale golden straw color forms a nice sized head that is fizzy un-natural carbonation leaves some lacing not the worst looking brew. Aromatic qualities along with the typical cooked veggie tone comes a subtle nice spice with some mild hop tone, doesn't smell completely clean but nice and subtly bready. Taste is very even not much of anything overpowers, somewhat of a barrage of cereal grains blended with an unoffensive dosage of hops and a touch of bready spiciness that is hard to describe. A maybe just a bit better than your typical Bud, Miller, Coors product but either way it's refreshing. Mouthfeel: Is thin light bodied mass produced American light lager like, carbonation is pretty high nothing to impressive. Drinkability of this beer is effortless very nice pounding beer refreshing after work unoffensive but nice subtle flavors all adds to an enjoyable experience for me most of the time."
"The flavor is not to my liking either. Sour, adjuncty, grainy with a nasty undercurrent of something that I can't quite put into words. Rolling Rock Extra Pale isn't 'spit it out' beer, but it isn't something that I'll willingly drink again. Another beer with a reputation that is hard to figure. Of course, given what the lion's share of American beer drinkers are pouring down their throats, it's not entirely a mystery."
"The appearence was pale yellow with a head that faded quickly. My least favorite part about the beer was the smell. Very sweet smelling with adjuncts shining through. It reminded me of the way a card table smells after a night of bud light and poker. The taste followed the smell closely. No hops at all. The drinkability was the only selling point. Similar to bud/miller/coors..."
"Used to drink this back in high school, used to think it was fancy. Anyway decided to go back down memory lane, Pours a straw yellow with a nice head that was quite suprising. Not much lacing on the glass however. Smell is of potent grain and steel, almost metallic (weird since out of the bottle). Taste is also quite grainy, hints of grilled potato. Not many hops to speak of, feels quite light and dull in the mouth. I guess you could have a few of these on those summer days, but I probably won't make this trip again."
"The taste reaffirms the smell. I imagine prohibition homebrew to taste much like this, something to get cross-eyed with without gagging. Can you say beer-flavored Kool-Aid? Carbonation burns through like a Coke from McDonald's, and thankfully so. This is something to drink after a hard day on a job involving heavy manual labor. It's swill, but it's decent swill. Drink this to get numb, not to savor."
"Rolling Rock had a nice drinkability that lends itself well to a scorching hot day. It even stood up well to getting a tad warm, something I can't say about for Bud, Miller or Coors. Drink it to wet your whistle on a hot day, not to ponder the great complexities of beer."
"Had this at band practice last night. It poured a pale straw yellow with a fizzy white head. Smell is very mild but not real interesting. Taste is how you would expect, very smooth and faint but weith a slightly sweet finish. It's not bad to have a few ""rocks"" once in awhile. It's just not my first choice."
"Acceptable, a fairly decent dry and crisp lager, goes down easy and is much better than the bigger pale american lagers, very cheap at about £5 for 10 bottles"
"Yet, it does have devotees. I don't get it."
"Before becoming a beer snob, I drank nothing but Rolling Rock. I liked the tradition, the 33 mystery, the smaller brewery style. After sampling many really good beers and going back to the Rock, I have a hard time. What I thought was once good, is now only mediocre and very watery. Still a good brew for a hot day as long as the beer is ice cold. I need to tell my mother because every time I visit, she stocks the fridge with it for me."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is awful. It has a very pale malt scent that finishes dry and extremely musty. The taste is average. It has no malt character, but neither does any other extra pale lager. There is a musty dry finish and a small amount of bitter hops. It is weak and watery, but it's the poor man's champagne. The mouthfeel is average. It is low bodied and highly carbonated. This beer tastes plain and musty, but I have drank a lot of these in my day. I guess that means it drinks well."
"Drinkability exceptionally high,due to mild taste and refreshing qualities. In closing I would say,that this definitely not a beer connoisseur's type beer,but... for just some old belly scratching,work'in around the yard beer,can't get much better than this,Hey! I like it better than Bud!"
"I do have to wonder whether this beer was somewhat heftier say 40 years ago. Why did this brewery survive? Was it just consistent?"
"Taste is unique to this brand-light and slightly sweet with a dry finish. No particular hop character. Adjuncts are noticeable but well balanced to make a highly drinkable, sometimes refreshing brew with little offensive off flavors. This beer was a favorite of mine in the college years, some days this is really refreshing and tasty, and other days tastes like piss, it just all depends on my taste buds' mood."
"This is one of my quiet, guilty pleasures, always a treat on the deck in the sun, or on the boat, or at any outdoor festivity where some more craft-oriented brews might not be available to me. It's crisp, refreshing, and hits you where you live, which is right in the old thirst button, and I don't know how much more you can ask out of a beer that costs what this one does. A great value, with enough decent flavor to make it worth drinking, and with the right elements to make it drinkable."
"If you're out with people who don't understand good beer, or in a place that doesn't serve good beer, Rolling Rock is a great selection. I don't bother to pour it into a glass, as I wouldn't want my monogrammed mug to get the wrong idea about my taste and it wouldn't really gain anything from the extra surface area anyhow. As another poster said, tastes much better than it smells, and quite refreshing on those hot (March???) days."
"Mostly drinkable, beats Budweiser!"
"The pour was a medium golden yellow with a small white head that left a slight froth on top througout the drink. Constant bubbles, but I wouldn't say there was too much carbonation. The smell was that of a stronger American lager, slightly spicy as well as skunky. There was a total lack of hop bite at the start this was followed by, get this, a smooth finish. You tell me but that's the best way I can describe it, even with out any hop bite there was a smooth finish. All and all it was a refreshing drink, really a great lawnmower beer."
"Mouthfeel is thin, the best part is the snappy carbonation. Drinkability is poor, this is a why bother beer. Quite possibly the worst $5 I have spent on a beer. It suffered in comparison to the MGD I had and that was no great shakes either."
"In any case, I come back to Rolling Rock from time to time because it's a nostalgic lawner-mower beer that won't knock me off the John Deer if I have more than two."
"Pale straw gold, with a fluffy white head. Smells mostly of cereal, malt, and freshly cut grass. This beer has grown on me the more I try it. As far as euro-styled American lagers go, this is alright. Maybe a little too much graininess, but it balances out the euro ""skunk"" flavor. A fairly priced ($8 for 12) beer that is easy to drink. I don't dislike this one anymore."
"The bottle for some reason just wants to be rolled back and forth in your hands after you've poured the beer... or better yet, just drunk it. Rolling Rock is a beer that wants to be drunk straight out of the bottle."
"long skate sesh, tired, beaten, broken....need refreshment. cheap buy at the corner store, pours pale yellow...weaksauce head. the smell? cooked corn up in here! smells a tad sweet, not impressive. taste wise? sweet, corny, slightly metallic...and even though that sound like bad news, it really isnt...this beer isnt bad. refreshing in the mouth, very drinkable. its simple, not skunky and cheap. i dig it."
"Obviously not a world classic, but for a lawnmower beer it's not bad at all. Since it's everywhere here in Southwestern PA, I imagine I'll have it again."
"Once upon a time (30 some odd years ago) this was really considered by many to be a ""Premium"" U.S. Lager. This Extra Pale pours a light yellow color with a bubbly snow-white head on top. The aroma is reminiscent of opening a can of corn, with just a tad hop smell and faint fresh mowed lawn. The thin malt body tastes of corn and white bread. The mild hops are of the metallic variety, with a little lemony flavor. It's clean crisp and light and not at all offensive, except maybe a little Euro-skunkiness in some bottles."
"I remember buying this a case at a time in order to get bar bottles. It tasted fine with just about everything and it felt cool to drink out of the long neck bottles in restaurants. But, now the matter at hand. We have a light, clear gold liquid capped with an ephemeral creamy head. The aroma is a bit grainy. The taste is a little grainy with some bite, but not much hop presence. There is also a slight sweetness to the taste. The finish is just a little dry, nothing to really speak of. Overall it is a thin and watery beer. I rarely drink Rolling Rock these days, but while writing this I've been inspired to have one after the first lawn mow this year, for old times sake."
"Cheers"
"Two Words: Creamed Corn. Thats what you taste and smell when you drink this stuff. What an awful brew. It looks different in its silk screen green bottles, but it tastes like absolute garbage. The taste of corn dominates this beer. The smell is awful... Don't even attempt to drink this beer unless it is extremely cold and you are extremely thirsty. Its cheap, but so is Spam. Doesn't mean its good. If you're gonna plunk down 14-15 bucks on a case, get some Yeungling."
"This is a beer meant to be drunk straight off the bottle. As for its color, it becomes hard to comment here because it's always ""drunk straight off the bottle"". Anyway, it's nice sea green, like a sea cucumber. The smell is also hard to get at through its small yet succulent mouth. Really, it's not so hot though: it's a little sweet, like the mild malts of a light beer. From here on, the beer goes up in the reviewer's standards. It tastes clear...dude--it's so smooth. Something of lemons in there I think, if it's compared to a fruit. The mouthfeel is probably the highpoint of this beer, which adds to its great drinkability. It's a little bit refreshing--crisp, tight carbonation. It's a perfect spring drink, something to watch baseball to, perhaps a Reading Phillies game. And there you have it: Rolling Rock is something of a minor league drink."
"I think its good to mix it up with beers like this that you normally do not drink or prefer. Even if you can't enjoy them, they'll still put your belgians and stouts in perspective."
"After drinking Rolling Rock, it is definitely one of my favorite pale ales. It has a great mouthfeel, and really tastes great. The moutfeel is also pretty good as well. I call it and Killian's my ""Horsey Beers."" Obviously because of the horses on the front. Overall, Rolling Rock is a great pale ale, and I recommend it to anyone."
"Presented in a Bomber Bottle. Not exactly terrible as a beer, just an okay summer refresher. The servicably sudsy head kicks up a definite smell of corn. Pale, pale color signals weak malt character. Slight yeast bite. A touch of hop bitterness comes in toward the end, and lingers after you're done."
"Rolling Rock Pale tastes very clean. A little bit heavy on the corn adjuncts perhaps, but it slides down easy enough. No real taste here to get in the way of your drinking enjoyment. It gets good marks on drinkability. It's easy to put away a lot of these with no ill effects. This is not a beer that you want to drink warm, though. It gets REAL bitter and bland if you let it sit for any length of time. Get a cold one out of the ice chest and don't waste a whole lot of time drinking it."
"I don't know what happened, I liked the rock in the bottle. The tap had somethig else entirely to offer. Maybe it was the fact that I just finished an arrogant Bastard. It poured a weak urine yellow color with very little head. The smell was ok, but the taste, oh man, what the hell. What a horrible taste. It was very watery and super acidic. There's not much else to say about that taste. I may never drink Rolling Rock again."
"Very light yellow appearance. It had a decent head, with ok lacing. Smell was light and very indistinguishable. Taste was not noteworthy, but had some very slight bitter notes. Mouthfeel was very light. Fairly smooth on the drinkability scale. I drank this one ice cold...seemed like a good brew after scrorching in the summer sun. Frankly, I was expecting worse, but this brew was ok."
" This beer is absolutely perfect for a summer grilling session or hanging out by the pool. Rolling Rock comes in a green bottle that is sans label (which is a nice touch). A step above Bud and Coors, but not by much. Recomended beer for someone who just wants to drink some decent suds with his homeboys."
"what is extra pale supposed to mean anyway?"
"ng"
"Another party leftover. Yellow straw body with tons of carbonation and a fluffy white head. Smells of rusty cereal malts with surprisingly big plywood/cardboard hops. Taste starts with light grainy malts with a touch of sweetness, foolowed by muzzled, tinny hops. Finish is kinda bitter, with lingering cereal notes. Very bubbly and typically watery."
"Just an awful beer. Avoid like the plague."
"Light gold color, medium head. Light flavor, slightly hoppy, no maltyness. Pilsner style beer, very little flavor. Neutral Mouthfeel. Flavorless beer, would have NO flavor at all if not for green bottle skunkiness.Tastes even less like beer than Budweiser. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is neutral, no bitterness"
"Its okay i guess, these are the thoughts that pop into my head when ever i drink it, light mouthfeel, light head, light color, light flavor. Makes me wonder hwy they need rolling rock light. Would be an ok beer with some ribs or bbq chicken, no overpowering presence here."
"A great beer, born for hot summer nights. Still a classic."
"But they're giving money to clean up Bellingham Bay, so I'll drink it. On rare occasion"
"Drinkability  The lack of any sheer nastiness gets this one past my macro test, but just barely."
"There was a time when i thought this beer was classy. I have since progressed."
"This is my one of my ultimate lawnmower beers. It actually quenches my thirst, guess that's cause of the high watery content. I like it when I go fishing or cooking out, then I give a little to the burgers on the grill. What can I say about the rankings I gave it? App: Very pale color with a little bit of carbonated head that dies down rather quickly. Smell: Kind of skunky, but nothing too overbearing to ruin the essence of it. You can definately smell the hops. Taste: Similar to the smell, but waterier(if that's a word). Mouthfeel: Bubbly and light on the mouth. Drinkability: Give me a case and I'm set!"
"Average carbonation. Light straw color. Very light - definitely in the category of ""lawnmower beer."" Moderate aftertaste. Slightly unpleasant odor. Watery mouth feel noticeable on the tip of the tongue (I get the same reaction from Coors Light) and at the finish. Moderate amount of lacing left on the glass. Generally, average. Slightly more enjoyable than a mainstream premium beer."
"there was a time I really enjoyed this beer, but tasting what I taste now, there's not enough quality here to recommend it. Drinkable, but not preferable."
"This was one very light colored beer. Looks like a light beer to me. It also tastes like a light beer. Lots of adjunct flavors of corn and grain. This is not a pale ale. Where are the hops? I notice a slight maltiness at the onset but hops are nowhere to be found. Finishes dry and grainy. I'd only have this beer again if I were playing drinking games with it."
"Pungent, almost ""skunky"" aroma, which I'm not sure of what's it made. Poured with a really small head that left very quickly. Clear and light yellow (I'll say that's extra pale). Mix of malt and hops flavors. Somewhat bitter and again with the pungent and skunk-like qualities. Shorter finish of mild bitterness. Fully carbonated, with some softness, and rather thin. For mass produced products I haven't minded this as much as many others, maybe because it reminds me of Point Special (for which I have a fondness). But I don't think this is a great beer. Fairly thirst quenching. Watery enough to be a session beer, if a guy can get past the carbonation. Needs to be consummed quickly, as flavor changes for the worse as it warms."
"Taste is better than a Coor's Light, but what is that saying? No malt, no hops, just the adjuncts (both corn and rice). Mouthfeel is bubbly and crisp, best part of this beer, but not enough to redeem it. This was given to me by my neighbor so I don't know what they cost, but if it's any more than 3 bucks a sixer, stick with Red Dog . It's a beer that fits for a hot sweltering day, but I'd just as soon seek out something else."
"When poured into my glass, this beer had a large white head with small bubbles that quickly diminished. There is a lot of carbonation with this beer and absolutely no lacing on the sides of my glass. The aroma is awful as is the taste. Yuck!! The body hue is yellow. It tastes thin and water-downed. Definitely no character in this beers."
"This beer tastes of pure adjunct. I remember thinking to myself in my Homer Simpson voice "" mmmmmmmmm ..... Ad-juncts....."" Oh God is this beer terrible. Its pure corn with ""beer"" flavor added. No hops, only the faintest hint of some kind of barley malt. There is nothing redeeming about this swill. Definitely not recommended."
"The bottled Rolling Rock really brings out the adjuct flavour and aroma ... very corny with a steely after taste. The run of the mill carboantion gives some crips refreshing character ... other than that this beer is quite bland. Very little in the hops department as well ... hint of alcohol in the finish shows again that it is a beer."
"12 oz bottle. This is another one of those beers that I grew up drinking... well actually stealing from my dads stash. I still enjoy this on a hot day. Typical golden yellow. Smells like most macros heavy on the corn mild on the hops, good carbonation. Better when ice cold. I'd take this over most other macros any day."
"Kinda rocky heterogeneous head with some sticking power on top of an extra pale body. Well, its no surprise since its billed that way. Carbonation seems light after pouring. Sports that famous funky Rolling Rock aroma consisting of corn, cooked broccoli, husk, and a hint of lime rind. Spicy, grassy hops and some corny sweetness that builds over time. I prefer to open the a bottle and leave it in the fridge for a few minutes before drinking to subvert the ferocious carbonation. Not a good beer, but one thats easy to get along with, and like some people have said, good with BBQ. A cheap beer to have on a hot, outdoor day. We enjoyed a few bottles of this on the first really humid, uncomfortable day of the year to wash down a spicy order of wings."
"This brew pours a medium head of fine to medium sized white bubbles and a straw yellow body. It has a very mild malt-hop aroma with poor lacing and flat hoppy flavor that is weak and watery. Not a brew that I would ever recommend even to my worst enemy!"
"i actually don't mind this brew, and prefer it to most, if not all other macros. pours an ever so slightly darker yellow than your standard macro with a minimal head. tastes of grain and a bit of corn, but there is actual flavour here. goes down very smooth and is quite a thirst quencher and palate cleanser. especially good if served ice cold. certainly not the greatest beer in the world, but not bad in a pinch or when there's a distinct lack of selection."
"Green bottle, pours a bright clear golden-yellow color, has a small foamy white head that doesn't last long, light grainy aromas. Starts with a light dry grainy flavor, finishes clean with a little sweetness, not much aftertaste or any flavor for that matter, I wont won't be drinking this again anytime soon."
"."
"By the way what does the ""33"" mean? The amount of these you would need to drink to get drunk?"
"Light, clear yellow with a thin white head that dissipates immediately. There was no lacing whatever. Highly carbonated and fizzy mouthfeel is also quite watery. The taste when cold is tolerable if not good; as the beer warms it has an unpleasant and sweet taste that repels. Though it comes in a light green bottle, I did not notice any skunkiness."
"Poured out of the can (!), I'm looking at a light golden color, with a thin white head that disappears almost immediately. The nose suggests sweet corn, alongside an earthy aroma, with traces of something like the 'muddy' smell that follows a fresh rain. The flavor is somewhat grainy, with hints of malt and some metallic notes, and not much else going on. Others have called this brew 'watery,' and it is that. But my biggest problem with this one is that, especially as it warms, it becomes intolerably sweet, and lacks the crisp, sharp bite that I look for in the lager style."
"Only a good choice when nothing better, at any price, is available. At the Spigot in Hartford it's the cheap pitcher, but skip this one and grab a pitcher of SN Celebration while it lasts."
"Very watery with little to no flavor. No significant aroma other than something akin to the insides of a chemical plant. After being forced to do karaoke and returning to the now lukewarm beer, I discovered that it became almost impossible to drink as an almost rotten, warm bitterness had overtaken the light maltiness. This is definately an OK beer when you're already a little tipsy, and I'd imagine it works you're looking for something to work with something hot or a mild fish. But it's definately not worth drinking if you're just having conversation. By the time you get halfway through the bottle, it'll be undrinkable."
"Rolling Rock is a watery American lager that is easy to drink and a good palette cleanser. Be sure to drink it cold. For some reason, this seems to be the best beer sold in places like Applebee's, which isn't very reassuring. What does ""33"" stand for anyway?"
"This is a very light straw-colored beer. It pours with a white head that quickly fades to nothing. The aroma is a light grain smell with a hint of citrus and noticeable sweetness. Nothing special, but not offensive. The taste is light, crisp, and refreshing. A touch of sweetness and a hint bitterness is all you get, but it finshes very clean. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing as well, but still a bit harsh due to the lighter body and the artificial carbonation. Drinkability is excellent, and I find myself drinking more of these in the summer due to the light body and refreshing qualities. A solid, cheap, mass produced beer."
"Pours a golden, typical-macro golden color. Initial smell is of light corn, not a good aroma. A very vegetable/heavy corn taste. The corn taste stays with throught and seems to be a moody beer. Somehwat drinkable, but depends on the occassion. Would go good with spicy food, or some spicy snacks. This is a beer revisit and overall just an average macro--can do better."
"What can I say? I like the Rock. Light, crisp, easy to drink. Highly carbonated with a lighter taste. This isn't the beer to worry about lacing, or color, its yellow and keeps its head. You can put them away all night (I do), and not get filled up or burned out. As far as American standards and macros go its easily the best. I love this beer...cheap too."
"This beer after poured into the glass and received at the table was a straw/golden color. Carbonation was very visible. The head was white in color that seemed to have some creamy body to it. Surprising to me the lace was not only visible, but also seemed to stick fairly well. The aroma was soft, themes of floral hops, malt, and corn grains. The taste was also soft and light. Again well carbonated as the bubbles seemed to dance in ones mouth. There were hints of sweet malt, some bitter hops waved in and out fairly fast, some lemony citrus fruit also appeared, but it took me awhile to ID it. The flavors seem to change as it sat on the table. I noticed the corn grain seemed to become more pronounced in flavor as well as smell. Made in Pa, and I figured might as well try it. It is not that bad, but not that great either."
"I was really dissapointed with this beer. A friend invited me over and then asked me if I wanted a beer. When he told me what brand he had, I was anxious to try it - never turn down a new beer. I will certainly never drink this beer again. It didn't even take like beer."
"This beer has a repungant smell that reminds me of homemade white wine gone wrong, very wrong. I know it wasnt skunk since I like about 15 miles from Latrobe, this was a high school staple. Very drinkable in the summer, but probably one of my least liked brews in the winter. Tastes like water so its very quenching and clean. Best served Ice cold. These characteristics make it a nice backyard picnic beer in the high heat and humidity. But for those other 9 months of the year I will never buy Rolling Rock. This review is based on a few my g/f left in my fridge. This beer has a cult following in my hometown but i cant understand why people praise this false good when Penn Brewery, which is also about 20 miles aways over one of the best summer beers there is--their pilsner. Rolling Rock is light golden colored, the little head poured disapates quickly, though their is a lace at the top of the beer. This beer is extremely carbonated; I once made the characterization of it being simply 'fart and burp water in a green bottle'."
"Pours a very clear pale golden straw color with a thin white head that quickly dissipates. Light aroma of sweet malts and grains. Lots of carbonation in the mouth with light flavors of malt and corn. Very light and crisp. Serve ice cold and it goes well with Texas barbeque."
"2010-03-10."
"Not greate but better than most!"
"Had to try this again. I aways think of that idiot who did the commercials with the mystery of the ""33"". The green bottle is an instant turnoff to me, it says ""I can stay on the shelf for a hell of a long time."" The beer is supposed to be extra pale but it actually has no taste, and color of a typical macro. Oh well."
"Nice tart taste, dry clean finish. Very drinkable if it is ice cold. I have never had the opportunity to taste this warm as it went down fast. I like this beer. I will brin some back next time I'm in the US."
"The server initially brought my bottle of Rolling Rock to our table without a pint glass, so I politely asked for one.  Pours a clear, pale gold with a white foamy head that diminishes quickly although the surface remained covered with a thin white foam.  Beer had good carbonation with a lot of bubbles.  Aroma consisted of a fruity, floral scent.  Mouthfeel is crisp and dry with a thin body.  Finish is real subtle with almost no aftertaste."
"I have not sampled this beer for several years, and as my notes say, it is a clean and fresh tasting beer. Pours a nice clear gold color, large white head and generous lace. Malt nose, start is also malt and a bit sweet, the middle light, the finish dry, crisp and a bit of hop bite. Great beer? No, nice smooth drinking beer yes."
"Never could figure out the popularity of this beer.  To me it always tasted like an unholy marriage of macro-swill and Henekin, very little body, a taste of adjuncts, and a tangy whiff of skunk.  I am not sure this is better than MGD, and it cannot hold a candle to PBR."
"Lightest color of the bunch. Pale yellow and fizzy. Smells like good quality pond water: seaweed, frogs...for a minute I wonder if this is Bud (that is before I tasted the actual Bud). Crude, bare malt flavors and the slightest hop bitterness on the finish. The flavors are actually well integrated but nearly neutral. No thrust to this beer. Inocuous. Flat. No character."
"As a Canadian eh, this is my beer of choice when travelling within the US of A. The taste is crisp with a light sweetness. and minimal after taste. The fact that it is a light offering enables the consumer (me) to quaff more than 1.....often!"
"A good utility beer. All around purpose. Light look and aroma; corn, pale appearance. A crisp taste. Popular college beer, and rightly so since it is affordable. Refreshing and crisp, pours with a nice head. I still like this beer. I don't go out of my way for it, but I don't snub it either."
"After all of that you would think... this Beer is undrinkable, but Rolling Rock Extra Pale has a following, some people out there like things like this, and I just dont know why."
"Surprisingly better than i thought, less pissy than i exoected (thats not to say it isn't pissy), very light and thin flavour, but quite drinkable, even though its as boring as watching lawn bowls."
"Very nice appearance at first. Bright, clear, light golden color with a 1/4"" foamy white head. Unfortunately, the head fades very quickly - even before I took a taste. Very fine bubbles enhance the appearance. The aroma is perfumy, sweet malt with no hops to be found. A light body and soft carbonation give a thin mouthfeel. Still, there's a little zesty touch on the tongue which helps to make up a little bit for the lack of hops. The flavor is very lightly malty with just a touch of creamed corn. Based on memory, this beer has been cleaned up quite a bit - no doubt under the influence of Labatt (which in turn is owned by Interbrew, Belgium). The finish is slightly sweet but not cloying. Although this beer is incredibly one-sided, there are no rough edges to fault it and it's actually nicely refreshing."
"I have to say I have never liked Rolling rock in the bottle because it was always skunky, green bottles and beer don't mix. In the can it is alittle better. The skunky spinach odor is not there and the over powering tannins are at a minimum. This is a good cheap beer especially in the summer."
"I had not had this one for a few years. I was surprised that it actually tasted OK despite being an American Std and in a green bottle. Not much in the way of appearance or flavor but it went down easy and was refreshing."
"Not a great beer, but butter than I thought it would be.  A clear pale golden lager, pours with a medium sized white head.  Very well carbonated.  Smells faintly grassy, surprisingly minimal skunkiness.  Maybe I should have left it in the windowsill for a few days? ;) Malty sweet but not much other taste.  Finishes slightly sour.  Light body."
"Translucent pale yellow hue, sporadic animation, modest white head, decent retention, unorganized flecks of lace. The nose is uninspiring; very slight pollution of adjuncts (corn/grits?) adds a note of sweetness, grain, and husk. Light maltiness hops are not noticeable. Fairly clean palate, very distant sweetness, more grainy than anything, slight maltiness, faint hoppiness perfect carbonation to maximize quenchability. Easy to drink, based on a simplistic flavor profile clean finish, minimal aftertaste (light sweet-graininess). Medium-light body. Admirable mouthfeel. On par with the best cheap macro lagers (PBR, High Life) if the price is right, Id drink it again on a hot summer day. Green bottle prices suck green bottles suck as well."
"I am not going to re-invent the wheel on this one.  It is light, crisp, and clean.  Nothing out of the ordinary with aroma or flavor.  It is an extremely refreshing brew for those hot summer days.  Prost!"
"As advertised pours a very pale, nearly clean light yellow color. Big fizzy white head. Smell was somewhat grainy. Taste was at first crisp, and beerlike, some grain smells as well. As it warmed, the corn, grain, and metallic smells and tastes exploded. IMO, drink these extremely cold, and quickly. Not too much else here, ok in the summer heat, and easy to drink."
"Okay, at Comfest, the cheap beer available is Rolling Rock.  I pours out a very pale yellow color with very little aroma of hops with some skunkiness.  How this comes about on tap is beyond me.  There was a white head that did not stick around and left no lace.  The flavor was bland and not much to it.  Some carbonation made it fizzy and it had some hops and malt and some grain flavor to it.  Really is a cheap summer beer, but much better stuff out there."
"Pours a light golden...smell was of minnows or fish or something at first...but I found out it was the glass...poured in another glass the remaining amount from the bottle and the smell wasn't much better than the fish smell...a real sweet adjuncty smell....the taste is OK..I wouldn't pay more for this but if on special I'd take it....as for mouthfeel it leaves my mouth kind of puckered up on the finish...I just finished pretty much dissing Labatt Blue, and this is definitely a step down from that...I've had this on tap before and thought it was decent so maybe this is a bad bottle but it doesn't taste spoiled...then again it's a green bottle so it could be....this experience is not a good one."
"Hate to give a bad review to a beer from Arnold Palmers hometown but hey he didn't brew it so here goes.  First of all I hate the green bottle not a big fan of anything in green.  But the aroma is terrible and the taste is well I just cannot handle it.  Obviously many people love this beer but don't count me as one of them..............CHEERS"
"First look, and this beer might be mistaken for Pittsburgh city water, somewhat off color for a beer.  Slightly malty, but more bitter than sweet. Very fizzy seltzery.  Goes down well when cold, but the over simple taste gets old quick; you taste buds scream for something more exciting.  When this beer gets warm the taste of corn or rice adjuncts comes through and becomes distracting.  A mediocre beer that is now popular because of some of its unique qualities and a blitzy media campaign."
"For what it is, it is not bad when Foster's is not available. I had three very ice-cold ones at the comedy club one night. (My other choices were Bud/Miller/Coors products, Corona, Heineken--in skunky bottles, no thanks--and Shiner Bock.) It has one outstanding quality: it feels good going down. If there was a ""throatfeel"" catergory, it would rate a 4.0 in that regard."
"A good beer, that remind me of younger days. Easy drinking with not much bite, but it's in a green bottle and I haven't tasted a beer in a green bottle that I don't like yet. I know they can smell sometimes, but once you get past it you got her licked!"
"clear and golden in the glass, with a firm creamy head.  smells of adjuncts and a slight lemony hop twang.  mouthfeel is slightly smooth and creamy without too much fizz, but the taste is boring. not much going on, some grainy adjunct flavor which drowns any malt tastes there may be.  a slight hop finish and dry after that. very ordinary."
"Not a bad beer. It's definitely got a very light flavor. There aren't any real citrus hints but has the same kind of feel and is pretty refreshing when cold like a light citrus soda with it's lively carbonation and slightest bite. This isn't a heavy, malty, dark ale. It's not supposed to be. For what it's supposed to be, it's not bad."
"I have avoided this beer for years but got a deal so I tried it and was surprised that it is actually drinkable.  Low carbonation and not much of a head, fairly smooth.  Green bottle."
"Clean taste, crisp, good for when you are thirsty and its hot outside.  Goes well with spicy foods or a bushel of crabs with a lot of old bay."
"Not a bad brew. Comes off very light, crisp, easy to drink. This brew is best when it is consumed while ice cold. An ok summer refresher."
"As a geology grad student in my Pittsburgh days, ""rocks"" were the required pitchers at the bar...I can't bust 'em on ingredients but I swear there is a corn sweetness in the beer (I reminded myself with a bottle 2 nights ago)...other than that, this lager has nothing at the beginning or end...poor color and no finish...and yeah, I laugh at the people who pay extra for this green bottled ""premium"" out here in Minnesota...even growing up in upstate New York, 7 oz ""ponies"" (we called 'em ""splits"" in High School) of Rolling Rocks were cheap...but its a drinkable beer, from a regional brewery, and an example of what Americans came to like in the 20th century.."
"I've never understood the attraction of this beer.  The green bottles don't do alot to enhance its travel/shelf life.  Little in the flavor department.  This beer reminds me of travelling to Pittsburgh to visit my grandparents as a kid.  My dad would drink this when we visited, as it was the local favorite.  Pennsylvania has better beers to choose from, such as Yuengling."
"Not a bad brew.  Has a more interesting flavor than Budmillercoorswieser.  Skunky sweet malt, lemony, refreshing.  Has a distinct bite on the palate.  Seems like beer in green bottles always taste skunky/herbal."
"Grew up wanting a sack of rocks - Thanks taste buds for growing up.  This is a really bland beer, but at least it's from PA."
"At a recent brewfest I sampled Rock along with many all malt beers and was knocked over by the obvious corn taste. Very cold and fresh is the only way this beer is palatable."
"Drank about 18 of these once on a foolish road trip to D.C. (a long time ago). Must be ice cold, and 90° outside."
"For what it is ... it is simply okay. Nothing overly special going on. Very light, easy to drink and extremely refreshing (when cold). Serve ice cold as this beer tends to get rather nasty and unpalatable when warm."
"A pretty decent beer.. when cold. Don't let it get warm though..."
"Middle of the road lager, light with some mild apple notes.  Not much depth, but a good burger and pizza beer."
