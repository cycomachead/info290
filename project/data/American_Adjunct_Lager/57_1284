I still prefer it to corona, as I do with mostly all beers, but this is more of a lateral move than a vertical one, fairly pedestrian, but short of awful.","StonedTrippin","Jul 08, 2013"

It's hard to say why I prefer Carta Blanca so much, except that it's just so unoffensive, so unintense, yet distinct and smooth.

Some dimethyl sulfide appears, and perhaps some dialkyl sulfides as well, giving it a cooked corn/cooked vegetable character that's distracting but not off-putting. It's rather dull in the finish, with a smear of husky and mealy grain followed by a minor showing of hoppy spiciness.

2.06,-21.7,3,2,1.5,3,2.5,"Light gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A light bodied lager-style Marzen beer. Light malts, a touch sweet and not very hoppy. Somewhat of a lemony flavor. Mouthfeel is crisp. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Aug 04, 2003"
3.1,17.9,3,3,3,3,3.5,"All around average beer. A decent beer to pair with spicier food as its light body and malty sweetness will quench the fire on the palate. The beer pours faded gold, with a slight white head. The aroma in muted malt, corn adjunct sweetness...no hops really apparent. The taste is clean, slight malty sweetness, with slight finishing hop bite, but not much.","brakspear","Jul 13, 2003"
3,14.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Bright gold with a thin surface scum unworthy of the title head. Streaming carbonation. Aroma of sweetened cereal and asparagus stems. Thin and mild across the buds. Nothing stands out or offends, a thoroughly average beer suitable for chasing cheap tequila or pouring over your sizzling skull if you find yourself in Monterrey on an average summer day. Muy aburrido.","inebrius","Jul 02, 2003"
2.85,8.4,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"12 oz bottle.Poured a typical macro beer yellow, with very little head, or lacing to speak of. Very little aroma is present, what is there is kind of citrusy. Taste was semi fizzy, bland, and bodyless. It didn't taste bad, but it just didn't taste like anything at all. If you just want to sit around pound down some brews with the boys, this would be a great session beer. Just not what i'm looking for.","Indybeer","Jun 24, 2003"
2.62,-0.4,2,2.5,2.5,2,3.5,"Yes, Carta Blanca is in one word: ""crisp."" It will make a good hot day beverage or something to wash down some spicy Mexican food with. Don't except too much out of this beer though in terms of flavor.","Beastdog75","Jun 13, 2003"
3.42,30,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I would say this is another very drinkable lighter beer for the summer months","Reidrover","May 15, 2003"
3.07,16.7,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Color is, well, yellow. No head presence when poured, just some white fizz. Lacked of carbination. smell is mostly faint malt no hop presence. Taste is the same, more malt then anything, very light and clean but no real body or boldness. Feel is light bodied and wet, easy drinker, but passable.","tavernjef","Apr 08, 2003"
2.42,-8,2,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"pours out a chill haze, murky light copper colour. a very thin head appears, and dies down to a thin lace. light and pleasant aromas of sweet caramel malts....with hints of musty wet cardboard. a realtively nice tasting beer....a sweet but watered down caramel maltiness is present....not any hopping to really taste, but hints of a hop crispness in the finish. for a regular lager, this is an average offering, but for the style it's listed under..pretty poor. i'm scoring it as a regular lager, otherwise my scores would be even lower. not a horrible beer...probably would go well with some mexican food of course. just weak all around. there are better mexican beers to try.","budgood1","Mar 14, 2003"
2.9,10.3,2,2,3,3,4,"Pours a pale straw color, with a very small head. Little head retention. Smells like a standard Lager. Taste is very clean, with little bitterness. Goes down very smooth, and high alcohol content. Pairs well with Mexican food. Not bad at all, but nothing extraordinary. It's worth a shot.","jerseyemt","Feb 21, 2003"
2.92,11,2.5,3,3,2.5,3,"I'm ashamed to say I even had this beer, and before my advocacy I actually thought this decent. When out to dinner and out of town to boot you go for what is best or have water. That I picked this one gives you an idea of the selection. This poured a pale straw with little head retention. Lacing or lack of it, was laughable. Aroma was of some malt and grain. Taste was malty sweet and corn most likely. Thin mouthfeel as expected. Drinkable on a hot day with no good beer in sight, other than that I'll pass.","Mark","Feb 17, 2003"
3.1,17.9,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Pours a clear pale golden straw color with a thin foamy white head that dissipates into a thin lace. Nose is quite clean with mild notes of fresh grains and a hint of floral hops. Very light and crisp in body. Taste is fresh grains with a touch of cooked corn and mild citrus flavors. Finish is dry with some citrus hop notes. This is by no means a great beer, but it is just like almost every other Mexican beer on the marketcrisp and refreshing and nice on a hot afternoon.","Morris729","Feb 16, 2003"
2.58,-1.9,3,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Pale, pathetic golden hue, slim, soapy white head, similar retention, no lace. Herbal, zesty, slightly foul nose thankfully it's not too potent. Rather bland tasting, sweetness dominates, hops are detectable (if you put some effort into it), the malt is a saving grace dry finish, lingering sweetness masks the maltiness. While it is not offensive, Id still say skip it yet another worthless Lager.","bditty187","Jan 30, 2003"
3.05,16,2.5,2.5,3,3,4,"Had this little bandito in an authentic Mexican resturaunt. It was a nice little beer though. Easy on the buds and went down smooth. It was like other Mexican beers, in that it was a light one, but it had a little bite to it in the end. I liked this one with food, and I usually can't eat and drink beer at the same time. Anyways, i thought it was pretty good.","JISurfer","Jan 07, 2003"
2.06,-21.7,3,2,2,2,2,"The color on the pour is a translucent light gold the head average and white with something that resembles lace skulking down the glass. Aroma of malt dominant in the nose that is also lightly sweet, crisp and clean. Begins malt and a cloyingly sweet with the top skeletal, finish is astringent, sparsely hopped, dry, and just not something I would want to drink on a regular basis.","Gusler","Dec 10, 2002"

2.33,-11.4,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Clear dark yellow yet not golden color. Thin, faint, fast fading white head. Heavy roasted corn smells. Taste is mix of sour beer flavors and sweet corn water. Hints of corn syrup in the middle. No noticable hops used.  Thin, and light bodied. Watery finish. Must be drank cold and quickly.","StevieW","Sep 16, 2002"

2.27,-13.7,2,2.5,2,3.5,2,"Notes: Usually most Mexican beers are at least ""okay"" in my book (except for Corona Light, and anything you need to put a lime into), but this beer was just not acceptable. My recommendation: Pass on this one.","Todd","Jul 01, 2002"
3.02,14.8,3,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Light golden hue and typically clear.  The head settles quickly into a thin layer that manages to leave sparse lace.  Light herbal Hallertauer hop nose at first, w/ subtle bready malt notes following in aroma. A bit lacking in malt flavor, since subtle husky base grain flavors dominate while caramel malt sweetness and complexity is absent.  Malt sweetness and hop bitterness are both low in this brew, so an unimpressive balance is acheived.  The light, inobtrusive body lends this brew a decent drinkability that would pair well with a meal.  The finish is very clean and just slightly sweet and bready.  Carta Blanca is a beer not meant to be enjoyed for any nuances, since it is devoid of any.","marc77","Jun 04, 2002"
3.48,32.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Medium gold color with a quite decent white head, faint lace, quite carbonated.  Somewhat floral aroma of hops, some grain and malt also.  Initial taste is sweet from the malt, followed by some hop bitterness.  Finish is clean and dry, quite refreshing.  Among the best of the commonly available beers imported from Mexico.","Pegasus","May 20, 2002"
2.9,10.3,3,3,3,2,3,"A little on the thin side, somewhat astringent.  Not one of the best Mexican beers, but far better than, say, Corona.  A good hot-weather back yard BBQ beer.","Brent","Aug 18, 2001"
