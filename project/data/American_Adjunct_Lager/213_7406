A little bit of a caramel note to balance the taste. One of the best lawnmower beers or summer thirst quenchers. Easy to drink and beats the BMC alternatives hands down. Purchased in Etowah, TN at Muddy Waters Liquor and paid $10.99 for that 12 pack. Good value for the dollar.","KentT","Dec 01, 2014"

Grainy corn, grass and light malt aromas with floral hop notes. Carbonation was slightly subdued up front creating a creamy feel. Light, tangy hop crispness through the middle up front with a clean semi-dry finish. Flavors are in line with the aromas. Light, crisp and refreshing. By far the best lager of its kind that I've had to date. Love the tall boy too.","IronLover","Jul 02, 2014"

This is probably my favorite AAL to date and one that will be hard to beat. At $5.49/sixer of 16oz cans, this beer is impossible to beat in terms of flavor and value. This will be a staple in my fridge during the hot summer months where a simple, easy drinking beer is all one really wants until the sun sets and the heat subsides a bit. Would highly recommend as a go-to, everyday cheap beer.","Beric","Jun 03, 2014"

This is comparable to most of the big guys (bud, coors, pbr) but I found it to be better in that is not as filling, nor do I feel as bad for buying a six pack. The appearance is a very light yellow with a strong smell of wheat. The taste is okay and it has a light feel to it without sacrificing too much flavor. So if you want to get something to appease friends who are used to drinking bud but don't want to give Anheuser-Busch your money, this is a great way to go.","WhiteHillsStore","Apr 17, 2014"

It's a beer to pair with pizza and football on TV (like I'm doing right now), or to have outside on a hot day. It's also a good lager to cook with - we've used it to make vegetable stews and beer cheese grits and it always holds up its end of the bargain. If you like U.S.A. lager, you'd be crazy not to try this, because it's also cheap (usually around $6 for six tallboys).","illpass78","Jan 11, 2014"

Tall white head that recedes fairly quickly with few bubbles coming up from the pint glass. Aroma is very grainy with a hint of breadiness, and little corn that I've come to expect from this style. Hobs are in there somewhere which a touch of herbal qualities and earthiness to the aroma. Much like the smell, very grainy, very dry, with some decent biscuit-like maltiness bringing up the finish. Bitterness is low but the hops do add a bit of grassy flavors to the brew. Taste is not light by any means, but it's very smooth and easy to drink, with lower carbonation. Fuck yeah, lawnmower beer.

No hops to speak of and all flavors clear out pretty quickly. Highly carbonated and very light in body, too light for a lager I would say but considering the competition, not bad. I like having this around as a cheap option that has decent flavor. Worlds better than other cheap beers I've had and equally priced but in a larger format can.

This has a big white head that sits on top of a clear light bodied yellow beer. Visible carbonation and sticky lacing. Smells typical to the style, cereal, a slight amount of hops and that undeniable smell of beer my dad used to drink. Nostalgic if nothing else. The taste isn't anything to shake a stick at either. Pale malts and a slightly bitter finish make this exactly what I would want from this guy. The mouthfeel has a nice lively carbonated and light body.

The expected very pale yellow/slight orange, sizable foamy white head fizzles down and turns into a ring, strands of the cap manage to stay alive. The smell isn't bad either. A faint light fruit smell (lemon/orange) and even a little bit of hop aroma cover up most of the macro corn scent. The taste is pretty good for the style. Alot more actual flavors are detectable. Definitely a slight fruit taste, kinda reminds me of Blue Moon, but it is more subtle. More expected adjuncts like cereal/grain are about even with the fruit. Hop presence is small, but there. Mouthfeel is thin and over-carbonated, usual for the style but not overly offensive. Finish is also pretty blech, also usual.

The mouthfeel is thin and fizzy from the carbonation.

It was served ice-cold in a can. With no glass. Ok so I can't really tell the color or lacing either. Sorry all. I cracked open the can with much trepidation expecting something somehow worse than the typical American lager mainstays. I was pleasantly surprised. It was quite carbonated but rather light and crisp. Rather grainy and a slight bitter finish- not unpleasant yet rather refreshing. As for drinkability, I would say that I could drink several of these in a session (several meaning like 3 or 4- I am a chick after all), and found it very drinkable after a hot day in the sun.

The pour is a pale yellow with a lively, carbonated white head with excellent clarity. The aroma is of corn, grass, malts, and light hops in the background.

I would drink this big time in the summer as a lawnmower beer and even just keep some around for those times you want a beer like this. It is screaming for simple food - burgers, pizza, etc. There is definitely room in the world for beers like this. I like this, I will drink more of it, I'll have it around for my ""I only drink Bud"" friends & family. Definitely recommended!","BuckSpin","Oct 04, 2007"
3,-10.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a medium yellow color with a head that fades fast. Aroma is bready/fruity with some malt showing through. Taste is strong and leaves a bready aftertaste with even a touch of bitterness. Goes down well. Not too bad of a beer but certainly not something I'd drink often.","Brad007","Sep 29, 2007"
4.2,25.4,4,4,4,4,5,"12oz brown bottle from Tiger Town in Gardiner. Dirty yellow (not quite gold) translucent body with a half inch of off-white head that quickly dissipates. Smells malty with hints of hops and adjuncts. Tastes sweet with just a hint of hop bite toward the finish, with adjuncts playing a bit of a role too. Very clean finish. Definitely the most flavorful American Macro/Pale Lager I've had. Lighter in mouthfeel but not watery or thin by any means. Extremely drinkable. I'm actually impressed with this one. And the combination of drinkability, good flavor, and price make this one a beer I'll be buying regularly.","MrHurmateeowish","Sep 21, 2007"

3.68,9.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I drank Gansett back in the 70's in 7 oz returnable bottles.(35/case) I don't know if the new stuff is the same, but it's very good. It's not brewed in RI, but in Rochester under licence. It was $4.59/6pk 16oz cans or $5.49/6k 12oz bottles. No brainer. It has a beautiful yellow color and a 2in head that left a little lacing. In order the smell was malt, hops, and cerial. The taste was the same, but the hops were more pronounced. I gave it a 'low' score on drinkability because I found the beer substantial in character(filling), and probably couldn't nail more than 2 of them without a little break. I'm glad to see it back!","frankbro","Jul 16, 2007"
3.21,-4.2,4,3,3,3.5,3.5,"I honestly wasn't expecting much, but I'm pleasantly surprised. It won't wow anyone, I wouldn't think, but it has the crisp, satisfying character that results in a very drinkable if a bit macro-esque lager. Pretty decent for a mainstream flagship beer, I believe.","Foxman","Jul 10, 2007"
3.38,0.9,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slight hops, some spices, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly hoppy, and spicey/caramel. Light-Medium body. The finish is clean and crisp. Drinkable, the last time I had one of these was about 35 years ago, when I lived in Pawtucket, RI. It's not bad, way better than a Bud, Coors, or Miller.","Wasatch","Jul 08, 2007"
3.7,10.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"I recall Narragansett as a the mass-produced lager from the 1970s, although I was too young to partake in its frothy tastiness. Fast forward 30 years, and it seems the reborn Narragansett has developed a very slick, nostalgia-based marketing campaign selling itself as a simple, straightfoward brew. I enjoyed this one for being what it is - a clean tasting, enjoyable lager that is a nice complement to a summer cookout. Although it lacks the complexity of other so called premium lagers, sometimes you just want to sit down with your basic quality lager at the end of the day and relax. It's sort of the ""girl next door"" of beers, and doesn't aim to be on the cover of the next FHM magazine; and there's nothing wrong with that. I predict this will become a staple in my beer fridge.","scriabin","Jun 24, 2007"
3.45,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,4," The 5.10% ABV makes this a really good session beer, and the drinkability of this makes it a worthy candidate as in introduction for the craft beer novice. No, it's not going to blow anyone away, but for someone looking for a cheap 6-pack, this would be a far superior choice to the BMC's in this world. Even for me, it's nice to have a drink like this now and then, and just let go from thinking my way through what I enjoy. Narragansett fills this role perfectly!","JerzDevl2000","Jun 19, 2007"
2.83,-15.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Overall it's nice a bad beer, a pretty decent macro, but it's priced between a budget and premium. Not sure why it's placed in a sixer with many crafts, I would rather pick up a 30 pack of Genny Creams for 11 bucks afterall they are the ones who are contracted to make it. It's a decent beer and it's nice to see a New England label back.","KevinB","Jun 16, 2007"

3.8,13.4,3,3,4,4,4.5,"D: This stuff is actually really good and highly drinkable. At $5.49 per six pack it's a great value, too. Perfect on a hot day after mowing the lawn. It's certainly a hell of a lot better than Scudweiser.","BassAssassin","Sep 10, 2006"
3.51,4.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"I was surprised by how unbad this was. Pours a yellowish amber with a fairly tenacious head. Constant upward carbonation. Smells of ricey beer, but not as ricey as many macros. There's some underlying grains as well, but no hops and little else in the way of esters. Sweet first off on the tongue, with corn-n-malt sweetness continuing through the mid palate. The finish dries out into grainy, crackery notes. Thin mouthfeel but smooth on the tongue. Surprisingly drinkable. If I had to drink a macro I'd probably go for this.","geexploitation","Aug 25, 2006"

2.82,-15.8,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,"This offering from Narragansett pours a maize yellow leaving a thin spotchy white lace. The nose is sweet, white sugar, also somewhat chemical in nature. The taste starts with a sweet rice feel on the palate with a faint hop presence and a decent highly carbonated body. Definatly a crisp lager with a slight aftertaste in the finish. Decent for a macro lager, but nothing that I will be visting again.","Franchise","Aug 20, 2006"
3.55,6,3,3,3.5,3.5,4.5,"This beer pours a light golden with a decent head that fades quickly. For its particular style, the macro lager, I'd say its the best I've ever had. It beats Bud, Coors, etc. The taste is of beer with a bit of a corn tinge, but nothing to complain about. If I want a cold lager beer, this is what I reach for every time. And you can't beat the price either.","Alexmc2","Aug 19, 2006"

3.1,-7.5,3,3,3,3,3.5,"This beer pours a pale yellowish gold into ""The Famous Narragansett Beer"" official lager glass which I obtained by buying a sixer of this stuff. Not much of a head to speak of. The aroma is of grains, grains, and more grains. This is a very crisp fresh tasting lager. Definitely something I could see drinking on a hot summer day. Not something I would reach for often however. This beats out many of the other macro lagers though. Nice to see their return to the brewing world.","mcowgill","Apr 23, 2006"

3.45,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Since this beer is smooth and light, it’s a beer that you can put away quite easily. I’ve seen this beer and others described as “BBQ beers” and I’d say that it’s an accurate assessment. I also think this beer is a perfect “buzz maintainer.” Usually I drink a cheaper beer after I drink a bunch of some good stuff and I’m buzzing enough to not taste the good stuff anymore. While I won’t dare compare this beer to the higher quality beers that I start the night off with, transitioning over to this beer is easier than many other cheap beers that I’ve had.","TheManiacalOne","Apr 05, 2006"
3.26,-2.7,4,3,3,3,4,"Narragansett pours a light orange with a nice inch head that doesn't stick around too long. I smell a sweet metalic graininess. Taste is sweet and grainy, maybe some hops in the background, but just barely. Its not as thin as some macro lagers, but not great either. I could drink this on a regular basis if I was hurtin' for money (more so then I already am). I guess a Providence based company bought the company back, but its still brewed in Rochester. Oddly enough, a six pack of tall boys is $4.49 where as the 12 ounce cans are $4.99. Apparently they're coming out with a porter and IPA, so that could be interesting...","ericj551","Apr 03, 2006"

Head lasts ok, but still seems to dwindle as I watch, and lacing is minimal, although there is some. Aroma is minimal, kind of generic ""beer"" nose, nothing much standing out. Taste is pale malt sweetness upfront, which was balanced out with soft hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is not bad, which in my book is good for a style as light as this, coupled with nice and easy drinkability.
