3.5,27.3,,,,,,"Review: Bottle of Imperial Pale Lager, 4.60%ABV An interesting lager from Costa Rica, Imperial, a very pleasant refreshing light lager. Appearance was a crystal clear, pale golden straw colour, what a normal looking lager should look like. When pouring a small frothy white appeared that dissipated relatively fast with some lacing remaining. Sweet aroma of lightly toasted malt with corn. Smell was great, very enticing. Similar to the smell, there is a slightly bitter grassy flavour of a creamy aftertaste of dry corn sweetness, that leaves a dry feeling in the mouth Overall, Imperial Beer is a standard, good lager.","Thisdrinkinglife","Dec 06, 2014"

Aroma is mostly sweet and grainy malt, along with a bit of skunk. Unfortunately it's a little worse tasting than it smells. It tastes mostly like skunky, grainy malt. I've tasted worse, but I can't say this is exactly appealing, and it gets worse the longer I drink it. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation.

Nothing cloying finishes semi balanced with a generic chemical/hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with enough flavor and refreshing qualities to create an enjoyable experience.

Nose smelled like silage and cardboard, a combination that makes me wonder why anyone would bother to import such dreck when so much of it is domestically available. Oh well. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and it tasted like dumbed-down lager that hearkens back to the great mistake known as Prohibition. It had a simple lager flavor embedded in whatever corn and rice adjuncts they saw fit to add to the mix. It was not unpleasant, per se, just boring as all get-out.

3.4,23.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Appears a golden-yellow color with loads of carbonation and a weak off-white head that leaves no lacing behind. Aromas of hops and grass seem to come out; above average for the style. The taste was a blend of malt and hops with minimal flavor, but what was present was earthy with pine and orange flavors. The mouthfeel was watery and thin, but the finish was smooth and mild making it easy to drink. One of the better beers in CR.","jaluria","Feb 09, 2006"
3.42,24.4,3.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"I'm actually pleasantly surprised with this beer. While it is an American Macro and would never be mistaken for a bigger, bolder style, it's quite a bit better than your average macro. Definitely worth a try and I'd drink it if I'm ever in Costa Rica.","Noxious26","Feb 01, 2006"
3.18,15.6,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Overall, this is not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, and in fact, it could stand side by side with many European lagers.","NeroFiddled","Nov 27, 2005"
3,9.1,3,3,3,3,3," A Grain taste with lemon and honeydew hints. Not as vinegarish as other CR beers i've tried. Balance between carbonation and bitterness. Not a bad brew","Mebuzzard","Oct 13, 2005"
3.13,13.8,3,2.5,3,3.5,4,"Imperial is a pale golden color with a high level of carbonation. The tall, foamy head has good retention for the type of beer. The aroma has a typical macro lager sweetness with, fortunately, no nasty off-smells and just a hint of herbal hop. A sweet lager taste dominates this beer and is aided by some nice grain flavor. Adjuncts are apparent, but don't provide off-flavors. A nice dash of herbal hop gives this more character than I expcted. For a macro style lager this is a good choice with an overall "fresh" flavor that I don't find in most American beers in this category.","Gagnonsux","Oct 01, 2005"
4,45.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Perhaps, this can be a little confusing, but it was a good beer, although it can be a little tiring even before you finish it. And the smell that is left in your empty can is a little strong. If oyu want to collect them like me. The corn flavors are almost not in there, but it still have a sour little back flavor in it.","nekronos","Sep 18, 2005"
2.95,7.3,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Reviewed as an American Macro. Thanks to Granny & Pops for bringing this back for me. Pours a medium yellow with a 1 finger head, large bubbles and OK lace. Smells of sweet malt, corn and rice. Mild hop aroma. Watery, sharp flavors, high carbonation. Lots of rice and corn flavors here. Some OK bitterness though. As macros go this one ain't too bad - but overall, a poor beer","sabrills70","Jul 24, 2005"

3.05,10.9,3,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Grabbed this when in Costa Rica a few months back. Its been in the fridge and this seemed like the right time. It pours a slightly golden yellow color with a finger of head that falls to not much over the beer. The nose is as expected...corn sweetness dominates. The flavor is clean and crisp. No hop, mostly corn sweet, slight graineyness. Not bad. The feel is thin to moderate with a nice active carbonation. This is easy drinking and always works well while at the bar after chasing down some bugs in the rainforest.","kmpitz2","Mar 23, 2004"
2.47,-10.2,3,3.5,2,2.5,2,"Pretty much your standard macro lager. If I didn't know better, and just had a glass of beer set before me, I would assume this was Corona, Sol, or something like that. It's refreshing enough, but I don't see much difference between this and the masses of other beers virtually identical to it. It goes fairly well with this slow cooked, spicy curried pork I'm eating. Mmmm.","UnionMade","Beers"

2.21,-19.6,3,2,2.5,2.5,1.5,"350 ml brown bottle with a black peacock on the label. Pours a golden, clear color with a thin, creamy head. Highly carbonated. The aroma is uninspiring: seriuos corn and adjuncts with a jagged, rough graininess. Dry and crisp, light to medium body. Decent hop finish, but it doesn't make up for the beer's other shortcomings.","Suds","Apr 01, 2003"
3.47,26.2,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Color is pale yellow with a small white head that fizzed down to a thin mist of bubbles in about 10 seconds. Smell is faint of malt and hop, somewhat sweet and seems clean. Taste is fine for a pale lager, sweet malt up front and smooths out to a hoppy edge. Feels mostly light to medium bodied, dull, but smooth and sweet in general character. Easy drinker, but could use some help.","tavernjef","May 31, 2002"

2.43,-11.6,2.5,2,2.5,2,3,"The "standard" in Costa Rica...straw color, touch of a sweet smell (not corn -- to me). The head has that detergent adjunct look, lasts for seconds. Seems "spot-on" as an American-style Lager, initial sweetness followed by a predictable sweep of minute hop crispness. Doesn't have quite the unsettling aftertaste of a Miller High Life. Not much here to review, a summertime beer from an interesting place. Just not up to being called "good" by me. Thanks to my buddy Dave Szy. for bringin' back a can.","ADR","0"
