Hop fans will want to look elsewhere, as the hop flavor is almost non-existent although it does provide a little bitterness to counteract the malty sweetness. This should not be classified as an adjunct lager as it is an all-malt beer and its maltiness is its most pleasant characteristic. The bottle I drank was near the sell-by date, so while it was pretty drinkable, I am sure it would have been better 10 months ago!","SanWrencho","May 09, 2014"

It pours from the bottle with a pale, straw-yellow color topped by a fizzy white head, and there is almost no discernible aroma other than a mild mustiness and a faint graininess. The flavor does have a bit more character than most, though, with a bit of grassy hops and a nicely sweet cereal malt character. Overall, this beer isn't going to be something I search out, but it went just fine with a nice green curry.","devilben02","Mar 31, 2014"

I am fairly familiar with this beer from years of eating in Thai restaurants but usually choose Singha. Here Chang gets the formal review treatment. A pale straw yellow beer, maybe just veering towards lemon, with minimal white foam even when poured aggressively. Aroma is primarily cooked vegetable DMS, old malt, and a nondescript spice note ... I might be getting a hint of lemon or some other dried out citrus fruit. Palate is also dominated by DMS, doughy pale malt that evokes cheap white bread, and low key grassy hops coupled with the odd apple juice or artificial banana fruity note that pokes out here and there. Diacetyl? Thin, super fizzy, and finishes crisp and clean despite the sweet start, although I did notice a propensity to get sweeter and a bit rank as the beer warmed up. Its a standard American adjunct lager from Asia. Cooked, sweet, bland. I choose Singha for a reason.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 13, 2014"

Too much sweetness up front, not just malty but nearly sugary, grainy character, with bitterness that was quite low yet still sort of harsh and sharp. A bit fruity with lingering astringency and a hint of spiciness. The texture wasn't terrible, but wasn't appealing either -- low to medium bodied with rough carbonation.

3.66,41.3,4,3,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability: Light enough to drink a caseful, but not flavorful enough to want to. In the wide world of beer, it's mediocre, but it's good for the style.","soulgrowl","Jan 05, 2008"
3.2,23.6,3,3,3,3,4,"Aroma is more akin to a euro lager than an american macro. Faint malt and floral in nature. Tasted mostly sweet with a faint hop bite and just a smidge of spiciness. Medium light in body, this beer would certainly pair well with Thai cusine and i wish the local restaurant would stock it.","Shadman","Jan 04, 2008"
3.17,22.4,2.5,3,3,4,3.5,"A solid macro lager. Easy-drinking for the warm Thai climate as well as (I presume) spicy Thai cuisine. You don't need to go out of your way for this, but if you can get a single, ""Thai"" it (try it).","DoubleJ","Nov 30, 2007"
1.67,-35.5,1.5,2,1.5,2,1.5,"A pretty poor Thai beer. Clear yellow with no head, and nose is metallic grain. Taste is grains with slight hops on the end, but an odd alcoholic taste like turpentine (maybe it's the rumored formaldehyde?). Mouthfeel is thin, and drinkability is lacking. The best part of this beer is the logo.","shivtim","Aug 23, 2007"
1.68,-35.1,2,1.5,1.5,2,2,"Maybe it would be better served with some spicy Thai chicken, but on it's own, not good.","Padron4KM","Aug 19, 2007"
1.5,-42.1,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"I had this beer in a local Thai restaurant down the street. I am a man who loves flavorful food and flavorful beer. I poured this beer in a pilsner glass that was given to me and the head immediately disappeared. The pale yellow hue reminded me of the same color as bud light. The beer was refreshing only because it was cold but lacked flavor in every way possible. I suggest to everyone to pass on this one because it was definitely a big waste of time. Try Singha if you're in a Thai restaurant and don't waste your money or time on Chang like I did.","johnnymoto","Aug 09, 2007"
1.8,-30.5,2,2,1.5,2,2,"The OE of Thai beers, Beer Chang has that artificial sourness of a beer that has been made for one purpose--to get you drunk. Appearence is what you'd expect from a cheap lager, and the smell is similar to that of an American malt liquor. I usually give some leniency to third world beers but in this case there is no reason to choose Beer Chang over its drinkable counterparts.","chrisms86","May 19, 2007"
3.23,24.7,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Best Thai beer I've had, but the competition ain't intense. Still leans toward the ordinary, but it's enjoyable...reminds me more of Carolina Blonde than anything else. Go figure.","Metalmonk","Feb 25, 2007"
2,-22.8,2,2,2,2,2,"Overall: Keep very far away from this beer. Use only to wash out your mouth after drinking flaming shots of Mekong...","Umbra","Sep 19, 2006"
3.25,25.5,2.5,2.5,4,3,3,"As previously stated, the main benefits of this beer are price and alcohol content. Deffinitely give it a try when in Thailand, but don't be bothered to pay the export import price unless you're looking for an exotic change from your regular Mickey's.","blurredphoto","Jan 21, 2006"
2.03,-21.6,2.5,2,2,2,2,"Very pale straw hued, with a short-lived white beer head and a moderately carbonated body. The nose is pretty modest, if anything, with some malts and corn-like grainy smell, very faint trace of lemony hops. The palate is the same, sharply gassy upfront, then thin-bodied flavour of some sweet grains and sugars, but turning more and more watery as it goes... almost like a lemonade without the lemony edge!!! Finished with less sugary touch than its previous version (6.4%) but still a bit sticky on the palate. Overall, it has all the cheap and overly light texture I haven't confronted for a long long time, and even its predecessor tastes better than this one. One of the worst beers I've had, and not as a result of mis-handling or any ""excusable"" factors I believe. Not recommended at all.","wl0307","Nov 01, 2005"
2.26,-12.7,3,2,2,2,3,"The pour clear light golden amber color, the head adequate as is the lace, both bright white in color, malt nose, somewhat crisp and fresh. Start malt, the top cadaverous, finish bitingly acidic, the hops pertinent to the style, dry lingering aftertaste, beats ""Water", but just barely.","Gusler","Dec 20, 2002"
