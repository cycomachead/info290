"This beer is hard to get where I live, and it´s not that good. I know its very popular in the northern states, but here in central Mexico it has a bad rep."
""
""
""
"Ok with some tacos.  Needs salt and lime"
"Fantastic mouthfeel, and the flavor seems to downplay the adjuncts in favor of very soft malts.  The aroma suffers as with many of these beers, but this is a solid choice with Mexican fare."
"I'll stick to staying thirsty my friends"
""
"Better than Pacifico. A very light beer"
""
""
""
"Overall – Ah… Nothing all that spectacular here.  It is pretty much a sub-standard lager, that while light and crisp, really does not have the most palatable flavor profile."
""
"Carta Blahnca more like it"
""
""
""
"The taste is pretty basic with its barley and grainy malt flavor and a refreshing hop finish.  Just typical of the style like dozens of other beers in its class.  Drink it with tacos."

"Pours out to a thin white head that lasts and laces a bit; straw yellow color. Aroma is clean and inoffensive with no skunkiness--just light grain and hops. Flavor is dry and crisp but just blah, not much to it. Mouthfeel is thin. Overall nothing really special."

"Just what a beer needs to do. Definitely will buy this again."

"Overall: a pleasant, drinkable light lager that pairs well with spicy Mexican food."
""
""
""
"Typical Mexican adjunct, served best with a lime, for hot sunny days."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden-yellow in color with a very thin white head. Some very light spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is really nothing special at all, some yeast. The taste is about the same with some grains with a hint of corn. A little on the 'watered-down' side and slightly stale even, though no date is found on the bottle and bought it just in the past 2 weeks. Average to above average carbonation. Really nothing special about this brew."

"Beyond that, CB really has two practical uses. We have used it for cooking, namely in borracho beans and slow-cooked beef. Beyond that, I suppose you can use CB to put out a small fire."

"this is a pretty lousy beer, another one of the Mexican beers that's okay from the bottle but flattens right out when you pour it. this one has a caramel color to it, virtually no carbonation, and a lot less refreshment and relief from spicy food that I anticipated. the lime wedge it is generally served with actually helps a bit, giving some acidity and making it pop, but I hate to rely on fruit to bail out a poor brew. the malts taste watered down and overly sweet, and there are no hops at all to speak of. I still prefer it to corona, as I do with mostly all beers, but this is more of a lateral move than a vertical one, fairly pedestrian, but short of awful."

"not a bad Mexican lager choice"
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Pale washed-out coloration, pretty nice foamy head, and fair lacing. Not much in the nose. Light grain and a little yeasty. Very light body, white bread, and a little yeast. Not much else. Overall, this is a not so good quaff."

"O: While this beer didn't have much in the aromas or flavors of adjuncts, it is really lacking when it comes to hops."

"Not the worst beer in the world, but close to it. Probably wouldn't kill you if you were dying of thirst, but that's the only other time I'd want one."
""
"Pours a clear light orange with a foamy beige head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink. Smell is very mild and watery with some malt, grain, and corn-like aromas. Taste is much the same with a very watery and pretty flavorless quality. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer and another one of the gross mass produced Mexican beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours pale golden with a tall, white head and plenty of streaming bubbles. The head dissipates quickly. The beer has the aroma of lightly toasted malts and crackers. There are some mild hops in the smell as well. The beer has a mild, bready flavor with some bitter hops in the background. It tastes like a standard pale lager. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. This is a good beer that stands above most Mexican lagers."

"Easy drink, not much substance, but exactly what it is supposed to be."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, pale, yellow color with a thin, filmy, white coating along the surface. Aromas of butter, toasted cereal, and floral highlights. Flavors are watered down, with a subtle buttered toast backbone and a sharp, slightly sour overtone. Musty, slightly roasted aftertaste, with a watery, limp finish. Not good."

"This beer is pretty average and boring but there's a little salt taste that doesn't belong in any drink. It would be more than easy to do better with another beer."
""
""
""
"This is a crystal clear yellow gold color. Musty ‘light beer’ aroma, smells stale even when its fresh. Virtually no flavor. Keep it cold so it stays crisp and drinkable. Anything above 32 degrees and the flavor, such as it is, drops off completely."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing special here – it was good enough while eating Mexican food but nothing I would have again."
""
"Overall, for the price point, this is not any worse than any other Mexican beer. It may be better. I'd say this is better than Tecate at the very least."

"Given that beer is mostly water I tend to want to drink beers made as far north as possible. But I have some sentimental memories of drinking Carta Blanca on draft in Tijuana (at the Bol Corona to be exact) so I picked up a 32 oz. at my local because, well, I don't know why exactly. Tastes like a generic, if somewhat watery, American beer but with that Mexican dryness that I guess comes from the water down there. Salud!"

"this beer isn't bad, but it's not outstanding.the taste does have a little something different to it (i cantplace the taste) but whatever it is it quickly fades. I wish they would have taken whatever it was they were doing a little farther. Over all though this isn't bad. You can drink it without a problem. For a change of pace from a regular light beer- this will do."
"Overall Drinkability - Very drinkable. No off flavors. Great for the style. Has a decent amount of flavor."
"Nothing to brag about hear, but also not necessarily offensive in any way. As with most Mexican beers it goes well with the food of a somewhat similar origin."
"O - A drinkable beer. Simple and easy to drink."
"Poured a very light transparent gold with a head that contained enormous bubbles. The kind that fade to nothing very quickly. The smell: cheapo malt. The taste: carbonation. With some super cheapo malt and a little bit of bitterness. I poured it into a beer stein and I'm putting the rest of the 32 in the freezer as it tastes like it will be better if it's colder. There is very little taste in this beer. It's gotta be like the Busch of Mexico. It has a different flavour than Busch, though. It's a bit more bitter. It'd probably be easy to drink enormous quantities of this, so it's got that going for it. There's nothing else good to say about it. It's incredibly watery, but not really refreshing, in the way that club soda's not very refreshing since that's basically what this tastes like."
"O: Add lime and it gets better. 3.5"
"D: There are certainly worse beers out there, but this one is pretty bad and I could not recommend this one."
"Had this at a Mexican restaurant this evening, played nicely with the enchiladas and was a pleasant, smooth beer. While not something I'd go to for everything, it's a great example of a Mexican beer that is refreshing and goes well with lots of things on a hot summer day."
"Right when you open the bottle of this beer you catch the aroma that is distinctive o Carta Blanca. It smells sweet like a lemon has been dropped in it. Carta Blanca is one of my favorites. Mexican cerveza's have always been partial to me. It goes down smooth and tastes light and dark at the same time. It leaves no bitter after taste. It's is easy to drink a couple of them but I use the word couple delicately. i highly recommend this beer."
"RJT"
"For super hot weather only."
"D: There are better Mexican beers out there. Best with mexican food."
"This beer drinks almost like a carbonated water."
"overrall i have had worse and on a hot day it was not that bad at al, dont think i will be rushing out to buy it though."
"D: There are better Mexican beers out there. Best with mexican food."
"Picked this pup up at my local ethnic supermarket with a decent manufacture date. Pours light gold with a short-lived carbonic head. The nose is soft light grains, even slightly malty and way understated. I was ready to reach in the fridge for a lime, but resisted the temptation. It's very light in taste and texture; it makes Corona appear muscular by comparison. C.B. quenches well in this lousy, torridly hot and humid weather here in SE NY these days. So fire up the lawn mower, BBQ, or sit outside with a copy of Car & Driver, but don't forget the lime."
"Carta Blanca is a clean lightly flavored beer from Mexico. It goes down easy. There is bit of adjunct sweetness through the center, but not much and overall not much flavor at all, which is what makes it drinkable. The color was as yellow a beer as I have seen, but the cap of foam was white and pillowy."
"Mmmm"
"Mexican beer should only be compared to mexican beer. When a country's water has the reputation that Mexico's has, one shouldn't expect the beer that's produced there to be on the same level as other beers from around the world. That being said, Carta Blanca is one of the best Mexican beers. It is very smooth with a pleasant after taste. It goes great with mexican food but I acually prefer other Mexican beers for that purpose. This is a good beer for drinking in the shade of a tree or out on the porch on a hot day. You can drink a six pack while grilling and your tongue will still be able to tell the difference between the cabrito and the menudo. I like it."
"I really love this Mexican beer im my opinion it has a nice rich taste. If your in the mood for some smooth Mexican beer give this one a try. This goes great with almost any kind off food or just to sit back and pound some down with friends. Next time your in the store and see a 6 pack pick one up."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"This beer pours a clear light golden color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes quickly. The aroma is of corn, but is very faint. The taste is much the same. There is something there, but not much. The mouthfeel is light bodied, with annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, this is a disappointing adjunct lager. I have come to expect more from this style."
"Taste is typical for the style - heavy and noticeable amount of corn. Malty sweetness seems to be a bit more noticeable in this beer and gives it a slight malt liquor fell to it, but the body is not thick or creamy at all. Not a bad brew and is really easy to throw back. I am sure I will find myself face to face with another quart of 'White Label' at some point in the future."
"For an adjunct lager, this is actually pretty good. It pours a yellow that is a few shades darker than most adjuncts. A bit more bready and grapelike than most adjunct lagers, and also the mouthfeel, though light, is not as fizzy. It's a good beer to wash down Mexican food with and good for a summer day, but I prefer Bohemia."
"A beer that's worth trying if you're at a Mexican restaurant. Not too bitter; fairly smooth. This beer reminded me of what I would expect from the most popular domestics, except that it was served with a lime. I will definitely give it another try, but I'm not dying for another bottle of it."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - This beer was extremely drinkable but extremely flavorless as well. A Bud light will have more flavor than this beer, I just won't be buying this again, and I don't recommend it at all. I do recommend you go for something with a little more flavor, like Modelo Especial, Tecate, or my favorite of the style so far, Budweiser."
"As far as bland Mexican macros are concerned this isn't too bad - could do worse. Easy enough to drink a few while washing down some tacos (without adding or detracting much)...though for a Mexican macro to do the same, I would go with Bohemia."
"Very ""bready"" for a pilsner. I usually like a bit more hop presence. I didn't notice the skunk that others have reported, but I think this is a pretty new bottle that hasn't had much light exposure. Reviewing pilsners are tough, because I usually find them so boring. This is no exception."
"The aroma is light hops and a lot of skunk. The taste is basically the same. The mouthfeel is less than water, is that possible? Drinkable is ok but what's the point with the abv."
"I have a problem reviewing beers of this nature. There aren't really palatable examples in this category. I rated this beer based on a mixture of bias and trueness to style. Will I ever drink this beer again? Probably not. Is this a good example of its style? Its above average."
"I picked up a 6 pack of this at my local liquor store because I needed something for a family member's Mexican-themed birthday dinner, and it was cheap. As I'm sure you can infer from my review, this beer doesn't really seem very ""Mexican."" The excessive graininess far outweighs any citrus character, so this beer tastes much like the listed style - American Adjunct Lager. I don't suggest going out of your way to try this beer, but if you're looking for something cheap I suppose you could do worse."
"Another local AAL with a better price will serve just as well. Absolutely nothing special here..."
"Appearance is a pale golden yellow with a fair head that dissapates quickly having very light lace. Smell of very light sweet grains and hops. Taste is lightly sweet, grainy corn cereal with light hops. Mouthfeel does have good body and carbonation. Definitely Better than what I originally expected."
"D: Overall much better than I thought it would be, a solid effort out of the Mexican industrial lager category."
"T,M&D - a mod-light body. kinda syrupy for a lager. i wanted a bit more crispness from it. not a horrible mouthfeel, but a little below par for it's style for me. the taste is mostly predictable. a litle sweetness from grain, tortilla, rice, nothing too off, but just below par. it's a little watery, and not very flavorful. drink ice ice cold for maximum injoyment. better yet, pick something else..."
"MF&D - Light bodied and easy to drink. A great thirst quencher or paired up with Mexican cusine. A lot better than I had expected."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a gold color with a 1/2 inch head. Mild, corn aroma. Taste is rather bland, not much going on here. Feels watery in the mouth. Drinkability is good, especially in heat. Overall this is a fairly average beer."
"Finish: Dry and with a little bitter aftertaste."
"D = Not bad if you are in a pinch and want to try something different."
"Probably against my better judgment, I've been trying all of the beers that are readily available at the Mexican restaurants in Denver. After Carta, I have two more to go before I return to a steady diet of Bohemia and Negra Modelo with my enchiladas."
"D: Probably the worst beer from CCM, the more you drink it tastes worst."
"i had one of these last night at a good no-frills mexican joint with the purpose of reviewing - i've had a few carta blancas over the years - i gotta say it's not bad - a good working man's lager - without expecting much it actually tastes alright - nothing particularly bad here, just nothing great - it was fine with the authentic type tacos i ordered - i'd have another."
"This one poured a pale golden with little head, seemingly low carbonation. It smelled of corny malt and actually kind of sour-ish. The taste was much better than the smell--very corny malt and not a whole lot else. The body was on the upper end of low, which isn't saying much, but not far off what I imagine a brew from south of the border to be. Overall, this is an average Mexican brew. It was pretty far off my favorite, Pacifico, but at least it was drinkable."
"D - Had this while eating Mexican food so it wasn't horrible but other wise I'd say stay away from this beer"
"Smells very corny. Pours to a bright yellow with a lacy head that quickly recedes but leaves lacing. Taste is very watery with some sweet corn and hardly any hopping but what there is more floral than bitter. Finish is watery and thin. Mouthfeel is thin and carbonation seems low. I guess its better than drinking the water if in Mexico to avoid Moctezuma's Revenge. I think its also part of his revenge to have a beer like this."
"Taste is slightly sweet malts quickly subdued by (real?) hops. Carbonation is just right, slightly dry mildly bitter finish. Very pleasant easy drinker. Good session beer due to mild flavors and low 4.5% abv. I would probably keep some of this around but the price runs $8 or $9 per sixer. I've never seen a short case for sale in my area, only sixers."
"This is a pretty drinkable lager here. Compared to most others in the genre I like it."
"I'm not sure why I continue to drink this beer. There are better alternatives available for the price and quality. I think it has to do with the fact that it's readily available here in town and occasionally I crave cheap Mexican beer. Go figure. On the whole, though, it's just not a great brew."
"This beer was not an incredibly great beer but overall nothing I would kick out of bed, it is not as fullfilling compared to most of the other mexican beers I have had. This beer would go okay with a bland food, maybe just a flour tortila. Oh well I would recomend this for anything but mexican food. one of the weekest mexican beers I have had."
"A not to complex macro that hits the spot when having some Mexican food. Other than that, I would avoid this."
"D: Fairly easy enough to put down, sweet, non-offensive. Wont blow you away but wont turn you off and a good macro-alternative or entry level beer. one of the better beers ive sampled out of mexico."
"Well, it was 11:30 when I got home so it's all about ""gettin the job done"" with my beer selection tonight. And I have to say this did the trick. Good night!"
"Drinkability: If you don't expect more than it offers, it does the job with grace."
"Avoid this one.."
"Pours a fairly pale gold with a couple fingers worth of soft white foam that retains nicely before leaving some abundant lacing as it falls.Smells a lot like Ritz crackers,with some grassy notes as well.This Lager is crisp with a grainy backbone that turns earthy and dry.Nearly perfect on the carbonation,the body could use some more gonads.This is pretty good for a Mexi-Lager,no complaints."
"D: About the same as all Mexican macro styles. Just a good average beer that is going to get the job done."
"D - This isn't bad for a Mexican beer. It does just fine while throwing down so tacos."
"Thin and crisp with a dry finish. Excellent for washing down spicy Tex-Mex chow."
"Forgive me but I enjoy this beer. This is easily my favorite mexican macro lager. This stuff doesn't have the metallic notes of sol and doesn't have the skunk-funk of corona. Crisp, grainy, and well carbonated. It's easy to drink these quickly in the sun or help to chase down a spicy salsa. I also rarely find this stuff unless I'm in south Florida where they have it at one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. I say skip the lime. And as with most macro lagers... never get it in a can!"
"The taste is much better, thankfully. and It's light with a persistent grain and a light, watery apple-cider element. The finish is soft with an aftertaste of grain. Compared to Pacifico, it has more flavour but it is more rough. Compared to Corona, it's better all round except maybe the smell."
"A light yellow color lager with a flimsy white head and a bit of big bubbled lace. The aroma is sweet crispy wheat and some citrus. It tastes somewhat more mellow than the aroma suggests, perhaps a bit of malt noted. Pretty fizzy stuff, very thin with a watery wheat base, a little sweetness. Not complex but reasonably crisp and very drinkable."
"It's really not that bad for what it is. It has a mild yet pleasant flavor, decent mouthfeel, inoffensive aroma, and pretty good finish (for a cheap beer!)."
"Please, pass me the hops."
"I've got to day, I just really really like this beer. I could drink it over and over again. And seems to go perfectly with crackers and appetizers. It's really nothing exceptional, and it's really not goint to blow your mind away. But it's kind of like a really delicious cracker turned into a liquid, carbonated, drinkable form. I like it because it definitely doesn't have the sweetness present in most beers, but more of a dry taste, for the savory palate. It's definitely smooth, but without exceptional flavor though. It's hard to say why I prefer Carta Blanca so much, except that it's just so unoffensive, so unintense, yet distinct and smooth. It's great if you don't want to be overwhelmed by the beer, but want it to complement everything and anything (savory, that is)!"
"Drinkablity: Easy to pound, no real flavor though."
"This is the kind of beer most people think about when they hear the word beer. A pale yellow body, fizzy soda head, slightly sweet note of corn, and watery. It was a chore to put down a 12 ounce bottle, and when it warmed up, it became unpalatable. Even a slice of lemon couldn't save it. Very non-descript and unenjoyable."
"Better than average for the type."
"This is not a very drinkable beer. It has little to no originality and has zero aftertaste to it. Very weak in the flavor department."
"another from a mix received for Xmas"
"drinkability is good. there is not much taste here, so most any drinker can tolerate it, if for only a couple sips."
"I really think that this type of beer has enough characteristics to separate it from an American Macro Lager. I'm thinking cerveza is a style that should be adopted for this type of lager."
"Drinkability- It is a light easy to drink beer and it goes alright with the local food."
"Carta Blanca pours a yellow color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a sweet, corny aroma. There is a mild hop flavor that hits me instantly, the malt is noticeable as is a sweet corn flavor. Not bad really for what it is. One of the better Mexican macro lagers."
"Fairly drinkable brew, but kind of heavy for its beer type"
""
"Spritzy yet buttery mouthfeel with the sweet flavor staying with you from start to finish. I didn't notice a trace of alcoholic presence whatsoever, making this an easy drinker. I only bought it because I never saw it before with the ""caguama"" label on it and I wasn't expecting much, but it was surprisingly good for what it is."
"Carta Blanca pours a clear golden body beneath an average-sized head of white foam that holds fairly well and leaves some pretty nice walls of very thin lace at the outset of the glass. The nose is brightly grassy and slightly spicy - even a touch citrusy - over notes of husky, cereal-like grain. The flavor is even more grainy and straw-like, with the hops falling towards the back. It's a good balance though, except that the bitterness level seems a touch low. Some dimethyl sulfide appears, and perhaps some dialkyl sulfides as well, giving it a cooked corn/cooked vegetable character that's distracting but not off-putting. It's rather dull in the finish, with a smear of husky and mealy grain followed by a minor showing of hoppy spiciness. An average beer at best, Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma should be able to do much better - unless, of course, they're keeping it this way because the consumer likes it and expects it."
"D - Drinkable enough for a Mexican summer lager, but it's not a memorable brew by any means. Went well with Mexican food, but their are better beers at most Mexican restaurants."
"D: A little tastier than most beers Ive had in the style, goes down easy, not filling at all, I have to say that it was much better than I was expecting, although I wasnt expecting much."
"I highly recommend this version (32 oz.) if you can get it."
"A not very impressive beer - on the other hand, at least it isn't horrible. Aroma is beery but weak, and the color is typical, with a little bit of head that doesn't persist. Flavor is fair to middlin', malty without any bitterness. It is not much by itself, so drink it with dinner or at a party."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, light-golden color with a thin soapy head. Not much going on with the smell, a very slight citrus note, mostly grainy malt. The taste is also of grainy malt, slight hoppiness that balances the beer well; smooth finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and is well carbonated. This is an average beer on all accounts."
"A light,creamy mouthfeel with a slight tang. A good refreshing beers not bad for a Marco beats BMC a decent beer in a Mexician restraunt. Went down very smooth and easy. Was really good with the spicy food."
"Drinks slow due to the thiness & lack of flavors. Still better than many of its cousins north of the rio grande"
"Basically a lower than average Mexican lager. There's better things out there that I'd much rather have."
"Drinkability- Needs to be ice cold to be enjoyable."
"This may be the worst beer to drink in the dead of winter in New York. Besides that, this beer is not terrible, for what it is. It's fizzy and yellow, has no smell, taste grainy, but is easy to drink and washes town tostada's nicely. Much better than Corona, almost as good as Tecate. Not great for 30 degree night, but pretty good for warm beachside day. Add a lime for flavor."
"Pours sparkiling golden. Head is fizzy, thin, leaving minute lace. Heavy cardboard aroma, with nuances of oxidized pinot grigio. Ohh lord. Tastes corny with heavy fusels and again, bad, bad white wine flavours. Oily, burning finish. Did I get a bad bottle? Ive wanted to try this for a while, so again, thanks Chris!"
"Not horrible but in the same zip code, this is more mediocre Mexican macrononsense from the folks at Cualhtemoc Moctezuma in Monterrey. Ok at the beach or a summer day of mowing or with a fiery taco platter..that's about it"
"In all, this is a decently drinkable beer."
"Poured a pale golden yellow, topped by a modest white head. Aroma is a little grainy, not much going on, maybe a hint of sweet corn. Flavor is clean, lightly sweet, with just a touch of noble-type hops. Actually much better than expected. Mouthfeel is not really thin, but far from solid or thick. Good for the style. Drinkability is OK. Typically I'd have a second beer, but didn't want a second of this. Good beer for Mexican or Latin cuisine, but thats about it."
"Beer poured a pale caramel color with a decent head in the glass. The smell had a strong grain component(rice?). Taste was a little better than the typical mega beer and it had a clean finish. It had decent mouthfeel, good carbonation and went very well with the awesome chicken mole we had at El Norteno in Albuquerque."
"Pours with a pale yellow head with a small white foamy head which leave no lacing. Smells like most Macros, slightly sweet. Has a clean crisp taste and light mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable, although I think two and half would be my max for the day. I might buy it again, but thats doubtful."
"Bottom line, I can heartily recommend the restaurant, but not the beer!"
"Overall: A substandard cerveza. Stick with Modelo or Dos Equis. Note: Its much better with a lime, which is not a good thing."
"Pours a brilliantly clear straw, with a half finger head. Quickly fizzles out leaving just a touch of spotty lacing. Clean aroma, mabye some weak adjuncts. Pilsener malt and mild rice flavor, with a spicy saaz-like hop bite in the aftertaste. The off-flavor is subdued and the overall taste has excellent balance. The mouthfeel is niether dry nor slick, and very smooth. Finishes clean and very drinkable. Outstanding compliment for Mexican cuisine or a humid summer day."
"Continuing in the Cinco-de-Mayo festivities, I owe it to our neighbors to the south to drink a few beers from the homeland. To those neighbors, ""Your beer sucks!"" No, all kidding aside, its similar to our U.S. lagers. Just as sweet with adjucnts, just as vegetol, just as grainy, just as void of flavor as our Macro Lagers are. Straw? yes. Smells like cream corn? yes. Tastes grainy? yes. Watery mouthfeel? yes. Finishes bite-ey? yes. So what does it have that's good....there is a light sweetness that is balanced with a grain husk / hop bittering. Good for washing down those burritos. Light bodied with a light creaminess. It's not bad. I actually enjoyed it."
"Not a bad beer at all and rather inexpensive ($2.49 a quart) considering it's shipped from Mexico, to New York and then lands here in So.Cal., definitely worth a try...cheers!"
"This is a drinkable beer, with a mild flavor. I would have this beer again, but probably only while dining on Mexican cuisine."
"Behold! The Mesiterbrau of Mexico! If nothing else, I could drink this all day. If I was stuck in some Mexican hotel during Malaria season, I might consider doing so. Otherwise, I would avoid."
"Light clear gold body, nice looking head, fades steadily, lots of visible carbonation. Cooked grain smell, slightly sour, pretty weak. Taste is miserably plain, to the point of it being bad tasting. Lightly grainy, this beer has ben done many times before. Another boring, bland, yet offensive, Mexican beer. Pass."
"Says on the six-pack..""The first Mexican beer since 1890."" I'm not quite sure what the hell that means..maybe something was lost in the translation. Very light yellow color with no head. Light grassy herbal aroma and a clean taste with no aftertaste whatsoever. I can imagine this being a cult summer classic sort of like Corona, because it is so watery and drinkable. However, it lacks any unique characteristics and doesn't even come close to being able to merit the $7.99 price tag I saw the sixers listed at. Thank God I swiped a free sample."
"I drink this one when I go to stadium to support my favorite football team."
"Poured a golden yellow color with massive white puffy head. Very attractive lacing. Smell is virtually non-existant, but at least not offensive. Taste is also minimal, with also a slight sweetness noted. Finish is cold and refreshing. Easy to drink, Good spacer."
"Pale yellow pour with a slight head that disappears quickly. Smell is uninteresting at best--indiscernible grains with a bit of spice. The taste is even less noteworthy. Beyond some grains, there was nothing there--not even the bit of quenching flavor that makes many Mexican beers nice pairings with Mexican food. In this case, the beer added nothing at all to the meal. The relative highpoint was the mouthfeel, which was fuller than the nose and taste would lead one to expect. I kept thinking ""at least this is pretty drinkable," but the fact is...it wasn't."
"This beer is the most drinkabily in my city from my buddies, and its no gave for me much taste, but had a little flavor of hops, its appearance and characteristics make a carta blanca the first pilsener beer in my country over la corona extra, his mouthfeel is good, smell so good like real pilsen, i only tried bottle and caguama, but dont try his can and tap serving type."
"NOt as good a sthe commercials used to say. But it is ok, maybe with the Mexican mixtures of lemon, salsa and some sauces, and salt, of course. BUt the beer by itself is nice, bubbling, little foam, like a lager like we know. A little bitter but just a little. Pale yellow with dark displays sometimes."
"A Mexican Beer that could pass for an American Beer. Poured out to a golden yellow color with a nice head that was unlike most macros in the way that it actually had staying power. Odors of malt and corn were most present, as was a chemical like smell. Almost reminded me of dishwasher soap. Flavor was nothing out of the ordinary, strong notes of adjunct and corn, with hints of hops and barley. Finished rather clean with notes of mild bitterness and malt on the palate. Worth a try, but there are better Mexican imports out there."
"Carta Blanca does nothing to make me change my mind about Mexican macro lagers. Maybe I should change that to North American macro lagers. On third thought, how about just macro lagers the world over. It was a chore to get this one down. I can't imagine things would have been much different if it was ice cold and I was parched. Pass."
"Poured as expected; a straw yellow with a fizzy white head which stayed around for longer than I expected. Smell was a bit sweet but not over the top DMS sweetness. Very clean flavor with just a touch of graininess and an ever so slight bitter finish. Other than that, there's not much else to this beer. Not undrinkably awful but nothing to really remember it by. I suppose if there's nothing else around I'd take it over a bud, but that situation isn't likely to come around too often."
"Lame beer."
"Overall, this is a beer that I will order from Mexican restaurants from time to time (I think it's probably the best Mexican beer I've tried) but I can't really call it a great (or even good) beer overall. Nice for what it is, decent for the style, but nothing that would get any craft brew drinker into a tizzy."
"Poured a straw color with bright white, rocky head, left lacework as the foam retreated -- not a bad looking macro lager. The aroma was full of cereal grains, not at all offensive, but a fresh aroma. Tasted like a refreshing macro lager with no off-flavors, in fact, fairly enjoyable for the style. Enough malt and other grains to prevent it from being too watery and just enough hops to make it refreshing. I would much sooner drink this than any American macro (unfortunately.) I split a quart with my wife over Mexican food and this stuff hit the spot. Of course, after the quart was finished it was on to something with more taste."
"Ahh, but the plate sizedT-Bone steak . . . I would kill for one of my Edmund Fitzgeralds, Stone's Smoked, or Anchor's Porters back in the refrigerators of Rolla. Hoping to score local craft beer for the hog roast back at the ranch."
"¡Salud!"
"Drinkability: OK macro lager from Mexico that is way over priced here. Reminded me of Tecate. Not a Marzen/Oktoberfest IMO. Total lack of appropriate maltyness, wrong coloration, just not good. Ratings would be slightly higher if rating as an adjunct lager. Low as I'm rating it as a it is listed."
"When they come this bland, it is hard to write a description. Some one told me that this was the elite beer in Mexico. Ouch."
"Pours a pale gold color with lots of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Thick, white fluffy head. The head retention was pretty good to my surprise. Some lace on the sides of the glass. Weak aroma, not much of anything except for a tiny bit of earth and oxidation. Plae malt with no depth at all. Floral hop flavor with a hint of bitterness. Not much in the way of flavors here. Pretty close to medium body, not very watery and thin. High carbonation. overall, not enough malt flavor to make this one worth it."
"Why are we calling this an Oktoberfest? I reviewed it as an adjuct lager."
"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from a bottle. UGH! It's been so long since I have had a good beer. Guess I won't get one until I get back to the states. Smells like corn. Wait...stale corn. Pours with zero head and zero lace with a light yellow straw color. Tastes pretty bad. Very watery with light carbonation. Kind of a funky metalic aftertaste also. Hard to finish. Just drink water if this is all there is to offer. Just make sure it's distilled water!"
"Overall, not a terrific beer, but its drinkable, smooth and easy going down. Something that would be nice at the beach, or on a hot day, but nothing impressive."
"ouch, this one's rough to drink. not as bad as a corona, but close. it pours a fizzy light golden colour with a virtual lack of any sort of head. basic and watery looking at best. the smell here is slightly of sulfur, a touch sweet and a touch grainy. the taste echoes the smell but is much more bland (if that is even possible). even ice cold, this one wan't that refreshing, or as crisp as i expected it to be. this is easily the lightest bodied marzen style brew i have tasted. so light that i was surprised t osee that it was of said style. there really isn't much to say about this one other than it's not very good. it's waaaay down on my list of mexi-brews."
"Carta Blanca reminds me in appearance and taste of an American light beer, all it lacks, fortunately, is the bad aftertaste. Still, this is a pretty lame beer. Aroma is almost non-existant, smells clean, but barely smells like beer. The color looks like, excuse me, moderately dark pee. Carta Blanca tastes a lot like light beer, no bad aftertaste, but alcohol taste is noticible. I could drink quite a few of these, mainly because there isn't enough bad flavor to dislike it, but it is definitely a below average beer."
"Very good for a mexican beer, would drink again, goes great with Enchiladas or churros."
"This brew put me to sleep with boredom"
"A decent drinkable brew, beats Bud."
"Carta Blanca had a light gold color with a decent, but short lived head. The aroma was mild and grainy. The taste was grainy and slightly sweet. The carbonation was alright and there was some hop bite. It had a slightly dry finish. It wasn't a skunky beer. However, there was not much going on with this beer. It was not even exciting on the 90 degree day that I sampled it. It did do its job by quenching my thirst."
"Given a ""3" overall, that is, it's average. It's a beer. Will order other beers at mexican restaurants, but won't necessarily avoid it. Zzzz"
"ave"
"Enjoyable but weak."
"When eating Mexican cuisine out and about I like to order this one,pours a light straw color with high carbonation,aroma is slightly metallic and hoppy.Taste has a definent malt profile to it with a light grassy taste lingering in the background,easy to drink alot of these.I think this beer is second only to Bohemia in the Mexican beer market."
"drinkability with a capital ""D"."
"Not much going on with this beer that's for sure. It lacks character and it was boring to drink and rate.Its appearance was that of a medium white creamy head that contained fine-small sized bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was clear and uncarbonated with a golden hue.The nose was malty as was the flavor.The mouthfeel was medium bodied and this beer's lacing was fair."
"Wow, and I thought A-B products were bad enough - this is awful swill. If you go to Mexico, drink the tequila and steer clear of this and all Mexican beers. There are no redeeming qualities in this beer....pale straw color, insipid odor, watery thin overly carbonated mouthfeel, and devoid of taste (except corn, of course). Next!"
"Drinkability  This one had just enough smoothness in it to keep the rating out of the cellar."
"No Mexican brew has yet really impressed me. An alright aroma, and decent color start this one. Flavor is crisp and smooth, with the funny aftertaste common in some Mexicans. A decent brew if your selections are limited and you like corn tasting. Thin, simple, carbonated, no head."
"Light gold color, small white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. A light bodied lager-style Marzen beer. Light malts, a touch sweet and not very hoppy. Somewhat of a lemony flavor. Mouthfeel is crisp. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"All around average beer. A decent beer to pair with spicier food as its light body and malty sweetness will quench the fire on the palate. The beer pours faded gold, with a slight white head. The aroma in muted malt, corn adjunct sweetness...no hops really apparent. The taste is clean, slight malty sweetness, with slight finishing hop bite, but not much."
"Bright gold with a thin surface scum unworthy of the title head. Streaming carbonation. Aroma of sweetened cereal and asparagus stems. Thin and mild across the buds. Nothing stands out or offends, a thoroughly average beer suitable for chasing cheap tequila or pouring over your sizzling skull if you find yourself in Monterrey on an average summer day. Muy aburrido."
"12 oz bottle.Poured a typical macro beer yellow, with very little head, or lacing to speak of. Very little aroma is present, what is there is kind of citrusy. Taste was semi fizzy, bland, and bodyless. It didn't taste bad, but it just didn't taste like anything at all. If you just want to sit around pound down some brews with the boys, this would be a great session beer. Just not what i'm looking for."
"Yes, Carta Blanca is in one word: ""crisp."" It will make a good hot day beverage or something to wash down some spicy Mexican food with. Don't except too much out of this beer though in terms of flavor."
"I would say this is another very drinkable lighter beer for the summer months"
"Color is, well, yellow. No head presence when poured, just some white fizz. Lacked of carbination. smell is mostly faint malt no hop presence. Taste is the same, more malt then anything, very light and clean but no real body or boldness. Feel is light bodied and wet, easy drinker, but passable."
"pours out a chill haze, murky light copper colour. a very thin head appears, and dies down to a thin lace. light and pleasant aromas of sweet caramel malts....with hints of musty wet cardboard. a realtively nice tasting beer....a sweet but watered down caramel maltiness is present....not any hopping to really taste, but hints of a hop crispness in the finish. for a regular lager, this is an average offering, but for the style it's listed under..pretty poor. i'm scoring it as a regular lager, otherwise my scores would be even lower. not a horrible beer...probably would go well with some mexican food of course. just weak all around. there are better mexican beers to try."
"Pours a pale straw color, with a very small head. Little head retention. Smells like a standard Lager. Taste is very clean, with little bitterness. Goes down very smooth, and high alcohol content. Pairs well with Mexican food. Not bad at all, but nothing extraordinary. It's worth a shot."
"I'm ashamed to say I even had this beer, and before my advocacy I actually thought this decent. When out to dinner and out of town to boot you go for what is best or have water. That I picked this one gives you an idea of the selection. This poured a pale straw with little head retention. Lacing or lack of it, was laughable. Aroma was of some malt and grain. Taste was malty sweet and corn most likely. Thin mouthfeel as expected. Drinkable on a hot day with no good beer in sight, other than that I'll pass."
"Pours a clear pale golden straw color with a thin foamy white head that dissipates into a thin lace. Nose is quite clean with mild notes of fresh grains and a hint of floral hops. Very light and crisp in body. Taste is fresh grains with a touch of cooked corn and mild citrus flavors. Finish is dry with some citrus hop notes. This is by no means a great beer, but it is just like almost every other Mexican beer on the marketcrisp and refreshing and nice on a hot afternoon."
"Pale, pathetic golden hue, slim, soapy white head, similar retention, no lace. Herbal, zesty, slightly foul nose thankfully it's not too potent. Rather bland tasting, sweetness dominates, hops are detectable (if you put some effort into it), the malt is a saving grace dry finish, lingering sweetness masks the maltiness. While it is not offensive, Id still say skip it yet another worthless Lager."
"Had this little bandito in an authentic Mexican resturaunt. It was a nice little beer though. Easy on the buds and went down smooth. It was like other Mexican beers, in that it was a light one, but it had a little bite to it in the end. I liked this one with food, and I usually can't eat and drink beer at the same time. Anyways, i thought it was pretty good."
"The color on the pour is a translucent light gold the head average and white with something that resembles lace skulking down the glass. Aroma of malt dominant in the nose that is also lightly sweet, crisp and clean. Begins malt and a cloyingly sweet with the top skeletal, finish is astringent, sparsely hopped, dry, and just not something I would want to drink on a regular basis."
"every other country."
"In summation, what you see is what you get, and that is very little."
"Clear dark yellow yet not golden color. Thin, faint, fast fading white head. Heavy roasted corn smells. Taste is mix of sour beer flavors and sweet corn water. Hints of corn syrup in the middle. No noticable hops used.  Thin, and light bodied. Watery finish. Must be drank cold and quickly."
"Must be served ice cold. A good pick out of the main stream Mexi-lagers."
"Notes: Usually most Mexican beers are at least ""okay"" in my book (except for Corona Light, and anything you need to put a lime into), but this beer was just not acceptable. My recommendation: Pass on this one."
"Light golden hue and typically clear.  The head settles quickly into a thin layer that manages to leave sparse lace.  Light herbal Hallertauer hop nose at first, w/ subtle bready malt notes following in aroma. A bit lacking in malt flavor, since subtle husky base grain flavors dominate while caramel malt sweetness and complexity is absent.  Malt sweetness and hop bitterness are both low in this brew, so an unimpressive balance is acheived.  The light, inobtrusive body lends this brew a decent drinkability that would pair well with a meal.  The finish is very clean and just slightly sweet and bready.  Carta Blanca is a beer not meant to be enjoyed for any nuances, since it is devoid of any."
"Medium gold color with a quite decent white head, faint lace, quite carbonated.  Somewhat floral aroma of hops, some grain and malt also.  Initial taste is sweet from the malt, followed by some hop bitterness.  Finish is clean and dry, quite refreshing.  Among the best of the commonly available beers imported from Mexico."
"A little on the thin side, somewhat astringent.  Not one of the best Mexican beers, but far better than, say, Corona.  A good hot-weather back yard BBQ beer."
