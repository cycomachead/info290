Pours a clear golden straw color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly in the July sun.

Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet grainy mouthfeel. Feels like a light lager, taste like a light lager but really went down easy on a sunny 85 degree day.

3.08,16.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"This is a light golden colored, clear lager with a decent white crown and good lacing. The aroma is a crisp metallic wheat, with rice and oats all evident. The flavor brings on a grapey overtone on the grainy theme noted in the aroma, along with an interesting peppery cinnamon flair. It’s medium light bodied with tiny but aggressive carbonation. Fortunately there’s no “metal” in the flavor and it mellows into a decent grain refreshment. This is another beer du jour for a particular cuisine. I guess every country must have one or two Budweiser beers to bring to the respective restaurants of the world. This was my first Argentinean experience and it was fine for having a grainy brew to wash down your meal. If you’re looking for something special, look elsewhere.","Durge","Nov 13, 2011"

Soft, and slightly sweet, but also thin, watery, and weak. Finish is clean, but devoid of much taste. On par with most American macros.","Suds","Beers"
1.55,-41.5,2,2,1.5,1.5,1,"It featured a standard, factory-grade, anemic, gray-colored fizz on top. It went away quickly. The aromas told of accelerated fermentation : grain; sugar; and alcohol. Bland and dry, it served up impressions of rice pancake and mineral water. Very Bud Light-like in it's candied, thin flavor profile. Stale, freeze-dried pea flavors lurked on the finish. This was the most tasteless imported beer I've ever consumed -- utterly meaningless.","putnam","0"
1.95,-26.4,2,2,2,1.5,2,"You always walk a fine line when buying a beer just because it is from a new country. I knew this wouldnt be good, but darn it I wanted to try an Argentinian beer! I am sure I am not the only one. Pours a clear pale gold color with a thin white head that lasted pretty long. Thin lacing. The aroma is lightly hopped. Thin-bodied and adjunct-ridden with a weak hops and malt flavor struggling to be noticed. The finish is clean but nearly flavorless. I have definitely had worse but this beer really serves no purpose other than being from Argentina.","Dogbrick","May 04, 2004"
2.95,11.3,2.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a bright clear yellow with large bubbles in a 1" head (I don't like large bubbles). Aroma is of burnt grain, oily with a slight hop touch. Flavor is moderate grainy, with slight hops at the end. Processed flavor with alightly sweet nutty notes. Very easy to drink, but mainly because there isn't much going on. Fuller and richer that standard US macrobrews, but that's about it.","Dukeofearl","Mar 23, 2004"
3.75,41.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I really like this beer for sitting around telling lies and eating BBQ. I will most certainly pick some more up to have on hand.","LarryKemp","Mar 23, 2004"
2.41,-9.1,3,2,2,2.5,3.5,"The beer has the words The Favorite Beer of Argentina on it. WTF?? Who is gong to believe that crap, oh shit I did, and thats why I picked up a bottle! On reflection, the advertising slogan sounds like The Favorite Child of Michael Jackson or The Favorite Battle Cry of France; no-one is going to believe it is either good, or even for real. Sure enough, its neither. Could this be South American AB (Argentine Bud)? Maybe!","TheLongBeachBum","Mar 18, 2004"
3.07,15.8,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Super drinkable brew, it goes down fast. Nothing offensive about this but it IS low flavor compare the craft brews that most here are used to. Not a beer I would seek out again but it is a good food-chasing brew.","Zorro","Mar 03, 2004"
3.16,19.2,4,3,2.5,3,4.5,"The high appearance marks are related to the consistent liveliness of the carbonation, fine bubbles and holding of the head in the glass.","TrinityHall","Feb 27, 2004"

2.78,4.9,3,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"This beer has no taste at all it just goes down fast and easy, pretty clear and crisp. Hopy smell and a lttle malty. It reminds me of alot of the other Latina American beers that have mad it big in the US (Corona, Dos X) in the sense that it should be consumend if you are going to fry under the sun. Good substitute for water.","JoEBoBpr","Jan 15, 2004"
1.86,-29.8,3,2,2,2,1,"I thought Ultra was the most flavorless beer I'd run across. Here, it has met its match. Aroma - well, if water has an aroma, this smelled about the same. As for flavor - no malt, no hops - about all I got was some vague olive-juice sourness. I had no idea that a beer could have some an utter absence of flavor. If this is Argentina's favorite beer, heaven help me if I ever have to go there.","Brent","Jan 15, 2004"
2.82,6.4,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Big pour -- tiny, fizzy head. Gone in 30 seconds. Clear, pale gold beer. Smell is somewhat nutty. Front is sourish; middle is thin, tangy, sourish; finish is slightly bitter, chemically. There are some nice grains in the aftertaste. This isn't great, but it's not completely unpleasant.","kbub6f","Dec 19, 2003"

2.44,-7.9,3.5,2,2,3.5,3,"Carbonation good but not over the top, about right there. Flavour not so much, quite insipid in fact. A bit of hoppiness for a nanosecond fades into very little; as much aftertaste as a bottle of spring water. No nasty chemical or processed tastes that I could detect, though. A fine beer to choose for a summer thirst quencher (apart from the smell, maybe) but little else. Adios...","Imbiber","Nov 03, 2003"
2.45,-7.5,3,3,2,2.5,2.5,"The flavor is a different story and not one I'm pleased to tell, as this brew has an off taste that is just not that pleasant. An off-putting pungent flavor invades the palate and lingers far too long. Just not sweet nor sour but rather strong and pushy. The feel is acidic and peppery. Not one I'll go back to again.","AtLagerHeads","Oct 31, 2003"
1.9,-28.3,2,2,1.5,2,2.5,"My girlfriend allowed me the honor of sampling her bottle of this at the Brickskellar. Poured a pale golden color with a thin, foamy head that was gone in a few seconds. Big bubbles, I think this one had been sitting in their cooler for a few months. About the only thing it had going for it was its lack of skunk, though. Very light, thin body, with almost absolutely no flavor. There's just not much to this one. Maybe if I were in Argentina and needed a thirst quencher I'd drink it, but there's absolutely no reason to have one here.","ElGordo","Jun 07, 2003"
2.11,-20.4,1,2.5,1.5,1.5,3.5,"Lager??Reminds me of my favorite beer style.NOT!!A small sized creamy white head with fine-small sized bubbles that quickly dissipated.The body was carbonated and clear with a yellow hue.The nose was malty, hoppy and fruity with a hoppy flavor.The mouthfeel was tingly, thin, watery and medium bodied.The lacing was very sparse.","hotstuff","Jun 06, 2003"
3.2,20.8,3,3,3.5,3,3,"An average lager. pours a pale golden tone with a slight foam head. The smell is not very present but shows a few hops. The taste, sweet and somewhat bitter reflects some maltyness which leaves behind no bad aftertaste. A good south american beer, above the average and always a good purchase in the region.","Andreji","May 08, 2003"
2.53,-4.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"A little sourness and hints of hops that are very reminiscent of about 90 percent of all Latin American beers made in the pilsener style that I've tried.","TPoling","May 02, 2003"
2.53,-4.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Drinkability/notes: Severely lacking in character, though not offensive, it could just as well be Miller Lite or Amstel. Greatly overpriced at $6.99 for a six-pack.","Pegasus","Jan 12, 2003"
3.03,14.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Pours a pale golden straw color with a pillowy fluffy white head that fades into a semi-sticky creamy lace. Nose is sweet malts and a bit of stale grains. Very light in body with a good amount of active carbonation. Taste is sweet malts and grains at first followed by some sulfur notes. A pretty boring beer overall. This is my first time sampling an Argentinean beer. I hope their other brews have more depth.","Morris729","Aug 11, 2002"
2.56,-3.4,3,2,2.5,3,3,"I was expecting something interesting from this beer, since I have never had an argentine beer before. But I came to find out that it is average at best. The beer had a decent frothy white head that lasted for a little bit and then settled into a small white lace for the rest of the glass. The smell did nothing for me, and was a little sour. The taste was average at best, and reminded me a little of the usual macro beers available in the U.S. It would be easy to pound back a few of these but it is nothing that would be very enjoyable to the palate.","Dmann","Beers"
2.68,1.1,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Quilmes, from Argentina:  pale golden colored beer, with a thick white rocky head, with great staying power and lace.  Sweet, light bodied beer.  The first few sips are unusual, but the taste seemed to improve as the beer warmed up slightly.  Clean dry aftertase, all in all not too bad, but the price (almost $8.00 for a six) ensured I’ll not be buying this again.","jackndan","0"
