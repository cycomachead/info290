"I like it a lot"
"its a pretty good brew, good with bbq food"
"Tastes of barley and hay. No complexity. I can see myself drinking this in the Australian outback on a hot day. Refreshing on a hot day, but otherwise very ok. I expected more from you Aussies!"
"This beer reminds me of Natural Light in both taste and feel."
""
"Foster's Lager tastes like any other American style macro-lager. Not too crazy and not the best, just plain ol' beer."
"I don't like the way it smells.  I like the fact that it is 5% ABV, after having gone through the craft beer phase and home brewing phase, I go more for buzz now than anything else the higher the ABV% the better I like the beer despite it's other short comings. Now then am I a beer geek no, but I know what I like and don't like, I like Fosters and would love to taste some not made in the U.S., Fosters in the UK is 4% abv everywhere else it's 5%. Will I buy more yes I will."
"here are my five words"
""
"O- hey, I kinda like it. Sure, it's an adjunct lager that ultimately can be beaten by any craft beer out there. But for what it is, it's alright."
"Nothing special. Generic lager taste."
""
""
"Horrible. Very disappointing.  I wanted to like based on it's history in the culture."
""
""
"Not a very good beer."
""
"Fosters. Because... why not?! It's Australian for bored. Saw the oil can at the local Publix and couldn't help but remember how I used to think this was a premium beer. LOL. Pours from the obnoxiously large can in to a Modelo pint glass with gusto. The massive, loose head of fizzy, white crackling suds is as big as the can. It rests atop a pale, yellow lager with copious amounts of bubbles hugging the glass, before disappearing in record time. What's left is an uninspired pint of pale, lifeless liquid. About as transparent as a beer can be.  A slightly sulfurous smell melds with metallic accents and a subtle, sour, floral hop note. In a nutshell, cheap lager. The taste is dominated by malty corn sweetness, with scant balancing bitterness. But not a sugary sweetness. Like chewing on unpopped popcorn kernels with a hint of aspartame. The finish is relatively crisp and clean, with little residual flavor. Surprisingly mild carbonation, with a smooth, slick, and easy mouthfeel. I could easily shotgun this entire oil can with little effort. Almost like beer-flavored water. Overall, aside from the unappealing aroma this is your typical pale, fizzy, swill. From time to time, it's just the right change of pace. Surprised I said that? It's an adjunct lager. For the style it's not half bad. If I was self-medicating I'd probably choose a beer like this."
""
""
"As an Anglo-Australian, I like this beer, I like to drink the local brew in most places I travel to, but this one is above average. The oversize cans appeal to the English and Scottish lager louts, perhaps giving the beer a worse name than it deserves."
""
""
"Better than water or rainier!"
""
""
"Overall: Skip this beer. An adjunct lager does not mean the beer has to be flavorless, which this is. I recommend passing on it."
"I would sometimes buy these in the oil cans just because they looked cool. But, not great."
""
""
""
""
"ok beer nothing special very crappy beer"
""
"Really only bought this beer for the can for my collection. I had heard nothing but negative things about it. I was not disappointed; it was bad."
"A standard lager with nothing special to offer but definitely a refreshing beer and fun to drink out of a massive can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't understand why I drank this."
"Overall, one of the better examples of the style. Seems most mass beers like this are very watery and have almost no flavor, this one at least has flavor. I can see how something like this would appeal on a hot day, it goes down easy, and at least to me, is a bit more than just water with a touch of beer flavoring."
""
"O- This used to be a splurge-type beer in college.  I could see drinking one after mowing the lawn or around the grill, but it doesn't set itself apart from its truly cheap, domestic counterparts.  More of a thirst quencher than something to savor."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think my rankings are off because the system detected an outlier, but to me this is a reasonable AAL. I haven't drank one in many years, but I preferred it to Coors Lite way back when."
"Pours a straw yellow slightly on the dark side compared to other adjunct beers. A frothy head of modest size ensues, the lace retention not so much.The smell was the only thing that really bothered me. It had a graininess to it that didn't feel fresh. In addition, there was an odor of cooked vegetables that was not so pleasant. The taste surprised me however. A smooth and clean taste that was malty and grainy. Not complex at all but not so watery that it rendered it flavorless. The feel was light bodied with moderate carbonation. Fairly drinkable beer. Not my favorite but not as bad, for me at least, as it's portrayed here."
""
""
""
"Had in the oil can tailgating for a football game in November (sorry for late upload). Very unimpressive for the AAL category. There are so many cheaper (domestic) AAL beers that are so much better."
"Had this from a 12 oz bottle just after Christmas 2014. Selected this beer as it was the best option of the beers available at the party we attended. Tolerable at first because it was cold. Worsened as it warmed as the corn flavor started to emerge. Wouldn't pay money for his stuff."
""
""
"I had this ice cold on tap at Outback Steakhouse on New Year's Eve.  In the light of the restaurant the brew looked pretty good, a nice golden hue with delicate carbonation and a puffy white head.  There was minimal lacing.  Smell is of whet and some slight malt.  taste was... Well, actually, upon first tasting it, I thought it was pretty awful stuff.  Not much subtlety and too much malt, but upon taking a few more tastes, I consider Fosters to be an acceptable tasting lager.   It beats the Budweisers and Millers or the world, but not by too much.  It has a light body and good carbonation on the tongue.  It certainly gets the job done, and I wouldn't turn one down if offered.  But again, I had it on tap.  It's probably better that way.  What beer isn't?"
""
"Pretty terrible... its kind of amazing how bad Foster's actually tastes."
""
""
"3.28 | 85 | B-"
""
""
""
""
""
"Funny when younger I thought this was a premium beer... still OK, but only ice cold, I'll get one with a steak at good ole Outback steakhouse now and then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I actually quite like Fosters. It is one of those beers that absolutely hit the spot when it is hot outside, and has just enough to be a bit different to the standard Aussie macro lager. Decent too for around AU$46 a case."

"This beer is not that bad. It was refreshing, I do like the taste of it. But it was not my favorite beer out their. I liked the golden look that it has. The aroma of this beer is not that bad at all. I had it in a can wich does change the taste some. I never have had it in a bottle. But over all this beer was not all that bad."
""
""
""

"This a good drinking beer and I would get this again."

"O - This beer gets slammed too much around here. It's not fantastic but it is worth more than the $2 it costs. Good session beer."

"Overall: nothing exciting, but not terrible either."

"Why is this classified as american lager? Is it perhaps made here or in Canada? Anyhow, this is a classic that goes way back with me. When I was in eighth grade, such a large can (steel in those days) was quite a novelty, and when I found an empty, I just had to take it to school for show-and-tell. Well, I was so proud of it that I showed it to my social studies teacher straight away. His horrified countenance took me by surprise, and bitter was my anguish when he promptly confiscated my novelty can. Utterly deflated, I had nothing for show-and -tell that day (not even dried dog food to eat in front of the class, another specialty of mine)....Awe, memories..."

"overall i wasn't expecting a whole lot here but i was still let down. first off its brewed in GA and TX so its not an import at all. i was expecting a non adjunct premium lager. which i did not get. over priced and in the wrong cooler. (import cooler) should be placed next to other adjuncts not next to real premium imports.just stay away from this one. adjunct and not a real import."

"Fosters was always one of my favorites but under the lens of beer snobbery I have to admit that it's just not that good."
""
"Now I understand why I've never seen an Australian drink Fosters and I've spent a fair amount of time OZ"
""
""
"Pours with exceptional clarity. Light gold with lots of lager bubbles wafting toward the top to meet a fat soapy head of white foam that had better retention that I thought It might. Nose is crisp with only a slight bit of apple, sweet grain and a bright hops character. A bit of lemon from those pride of ringwood hops as it warms. Taste follows the nose all the way. The malt stays in the background until it warms and brings a light dry cracker. The apple is thin and delicious adding something cheerful and crisp. The carbonation has a small bite and the yeast imparts a bit of sourness to really round out this beer. Even though the middle is quite dry and palate cleansing, this beer finishes off dry and with a bit of sweet lemon and is very delicious. I would have this again."

"The taste is refreshingly good, just slightly sweet at first, with a more than pleasant bitterness following. That's also how it finishes. Not watery, light, but still lots of taste."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: This beer almost starts smooth. The body taste of weakly roasted malts. The harsh carbonation takes away from what would be a smooth finish. This could almost have been a good beer."

""
""

"It is a refreshing beer, I would defenitely advise people to try a few on tap if given the chance."
"Pours a straw-yellow in color with about a finger of a white fizzy head that doesn't last too long. Some sticky lacing was seen which each sip. Lots of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom and sides of the glass from lots of carbonation. The aroma is of some sweet grains, that's about it. Taste is the same with a very slight dry finish. Also has a very slight bitter aftertaste which isn't bad at all and does not linger at all. Overall, I like Foster's."

"as the adjuncts go, I like fosters. interesting fact is that nobody in Australia drinks this, but it has been marketed in the united states as their national drink, remarkable commentary on global capitalism, but I digress. oil can is a great serving after a long shift as a line cook, let me tell you. crisp and clean, no off aromas or flavors, and while it lacks the feel and complexity and richness of a great ipa, which I would always prefer, it refreshes with the best of them. light malt and hops in balance, but the point is to be drinkable, and that it is. perhaps a bit more carbonation than necessary, but it works for me, I just burp a lot. this is not Australian for beer at all, as they have a diverse and burgeoning craft industry there that is way underrepresented in American markets, but fosters has a niche here and it fills it well. a little more to this one than the American crap beers, so I choose it for those reasons."

"this is a beer a lager what lager should be if miller and bud where this good i would buy it . im not sure the recipe is the same as always but the folks in texas got it right ive been drinking this beer for more than 20 years i can tell you it has changed over the years the first ones had pull tabs and where from australia then came the canadian ones which wasnt so good now is the texas brew which i love its my go to beer i always buy the 750 ml big cans its the best in those cans taste like lager should a bit bitter yet goes down smooth and taste like beer use too when i remember beer being good most of todays lager is too sweet and has no taste or just too watery . this one is a goodie . as for pour well i drink straight from the can dont care how she pours .i enjoy it and thats a rare find these days in mass market beer. thanks folks in texas for making this fine lager may there be many days in your venture ."

"Not much to say here. Crappy beer. Pours a light gold color with fluffy white head. Good start I guess. Aroma of stale corn and weak grass hops, some hay. Flavor follows the aroma with a slightly cleaner finish than some of the U.S. garbage. Light body and goes down rather easy. Do Aussies drink this for real? I doubt it."

"Poured a clear yellow with no head to speak of. Standard for the style. Scents of crystal malt and the usual maize adjuncts. Again, standard, nothing offensive, nothing stand-out. Flavor is sweet, with a bit of sweet malt, a good bit of maize adjunct flavors and a very, very slight hop bitterness. It's a light on complexity, sweet AAL. It's not offensive like some, but it's nothing special. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Standard. Everything about this beer is standard for an AAL. Nothing offensive, but nothing amazing either. It's a decent warm weather AAL, way better than it's American competition, even if it is brewed in Texas."

"A good thirst quencher in that it is more watery than any kind of good beer flavor. One might hope for a big flavor from a big beer can, but this lager is pretty non-descript. In fact, there is very little taste or aroma worth getting excited about. But it is wet and does have a decent ABV, so if you're looking for something to slake a parched throat and you don't have any decent cold water about, Foster's will get the job done. Otherwise, there are too many other, better lagers out there to satisfy a beer thirst."

"After a long day at work I stop by the nearest corner store for a cold one. Fosters in a big ass can, will do. Had it before in the military but not in the last 10 years. Within 5 miles I remembered why. Standard crap big batch lager. By the time I finished it and tossed that huge can out on the interstate, I promise the next time I drink this will be when I'm stranded on a deserted island and a case washes ashore."

"Date tasted: July 11, 2013... Glassware: 22oz. pilsner... Occasion: SHARKNADO....Appearance: clear golden orange body with sporadic effervescence; white head is uneven, rocky and thin--as my wife notes, though, the oil can it emanates from is attractive in the holder's hand ... Aroma: metallic corn ping; otherwise, adjunct vapors... Palate: oily smooth body--easy drinking with gassy deposits--ugh... Taste: toasted oats and lager malts make a rather empty dry tasting flavor; could be made in an American macro factory for all we the consumer know... Overall: the can instructs one to play Aussie bocce--this alone says much about the beer's intended patronage and its intentions; befitting Sharknado, this beer goes down smoothly yet predictably, like the Aussie who is gnawed upon only to be sucked away at the film's end by the impending tornado....I can live with this beer and its ""imported"" novelty...."

" Overall I think Fosters Lager is a rather solid beer. Its not quite a beer that will most likely have you saying ""wow this is the best beer ever!!"". But if you're a beer drinker that doesn't like lighter beers too much I guarantee you won't be pushing it aside."
""
""
""
""
" The taste carries some of the aroma qualities which are mild malt flavor and slight sweetness with light adjunct-type corny element with thin body and mild yeast with gentle spice of hops but pretty bland yet a slick and mildly fruity almost buttery quality hints at diacetyl with a drying finish. Overall Not the worst I have ever drank, but not great in a category with so many options this is substantially less than average in overall enjoyment."

"Above average Adjunct lager, you can feel a decent amount of bitterness relatively speaking. When I lived in NY a long time ago, and there wasn’t this craft beer scene, this was one of my favorities."
"O: There's nothing overly special about the taste of this beer, but it seems to be a little more palatable compared to other beers in the style because the bitterness helps to mask some of the flavors of adjunct malts."

"Final Thoughts: While better than its American counterparts (although I think this 'import' is actually brewed in TX) Foster's Lager is just plain bland. There's nothing bad about it's flavor, but there's really nothing good either. Would I drink it again? I want to say no, but I'll probably have it again at some point."

"The oil can gets this a few style points, which is as generous as I can be. Foster's tastes bitter and unpleasant. Whatever flavor it might have is overcome entirely by this enduring bitterness. Surprisingly, Foster's has some body, and isn't simply like water in a can, but it isn't enough to make this worth trying. Skip it. I am fairly sure the commercials mean to say: ""Foster's. Australian for gross."""

"Australias classic lager.soft structure and with rounded malted taste.Brewed firtst time in Melbourne 1887 by two brothers from N.Y city. Now it is awailible in 150 contries. Yellow golden colour 4.9% alcohol.Fosters brewing group. Good thirst qenchener.Its well past average!"

"Overall, it is what it is. A fairly bland, fizzy lager but honestly is isn't half bad. I wouldn't buy it all the time but the oil can is cheap and convenient on occasion."
""
""
"O - I haven't tried this beer in years thinking that I did not like the taste. Hell, I would be happy with some sort of taste."
""
"Comes to the table a clear pale golden color with a smallish but disappearing white head and a steady stream of carb bubbles. The aroma is lackluster at best, sweet grainy malt with a hint of corn and some light floral hops. The flavor is mild lightly sweet with hints of honey and a grassy grainy flavor thrown in there. Medium to light body with a moderate to heavy level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. Not the greatest beer in the world, but it was a step above the other macros offered on tap. Note to self Sam Adams was the better choice today."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is odd in that it's a real easy drinking beer, but strangely the aftertaste is not sitting well with me. However, if I continue drinking it, it masks this, until I swallow. Strangely passable but a real weird aftertaste on this brew. I could live with it, but there's more to beer than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 25.6 Oz. can into a lager glass. Beer pours a standard yellow with a massive, bubbly white head. The smell is strongly of skunk and some corn flakes, And perhapsa faint amount of grains? Nothing impressive. The taste is pretty good. Some grains, Perhaps some creamed corn in the mixture? Pretty standard of an AAL. The mouthfeel though, Pretty much feels like any other AAL. Over all, Would I buy it again? Sure, If I needed an easy drunk for cheap"
""
""
"Fosters in the UK is viewed as just another characterless corporate pale lager, brewed cheaply with no regard to quality. It definitely lives up to the hype. There are many beers I would rate as average that are far superior to this."
""
"Overall - Oh Foster's, if that's Australian for Beer, then you guys have got a long way to go. In so far as AAL's go, this one's one of the better ones, but that's not saying much."

"This beer is always served ice cold - maybe to mask the lack of flavour! While the appearance of the beer is light golden colour this tastes like any lager beer available in India. The beer is simple, no nonsense and a thirst quencher. Works well in Indian humid and hot weather. Ok to have one once in a while."

"Overall this beer is decent, not unique, not original, but not bad either. It is refreshing and easy to drink with a very simple, single flavor. I wouldn't drink these all night or suggest it as a favorite but one from time to time is fine."

"Pours a clear light yellow with a 2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Random patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, corn flakes, and sugar. Taste is of grain and sweetened corn flake flavors. There is a very mild bitterness that quickly fades after each sip and turns into a slightly medicinal flavor. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer in the main area: flavor. The sweet corn mixed with the medicinal flavors on the aftertaste aren't too tasty in this one."
""
"Overall: There's unfortunately not much to elaborate on this beer, in my opinion. There could definitely be taste improvements. Instead, the lager comes across as very bland and unoriginal."

"For down under, not too bad for a mass produced product. Except that I must consider the bis involving this lovely summer weather, which tells me to sweat then subconsciously find any form of beer. I have been a bit crazy lately so I figured this would suffice. The wide body can provides that manly american pride that we too often take for granted. We often figure that the smell dictates the taste to be similar, but the aroma was much more refreshing than the taste. The taste resembles that of good enough, as I guess most people will not go out of their way to discover what can be coined, better. Be free."
"O - Yeah, drinkable on a January afternoon on the boat, as long as it's cold."

"every pub in england has this on tap and is much better that way."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a big white head and minimal lacing. Aroma is lacking and only able to get some malty grain. Taste is again grainy and a slight hop presence in the finish. Feels a bit watered down. Fosters is how you say ""not good"" in Australian."

"Overall, the thing we enjoyed most about this beer was its clean finish. Really, this is good and bad, because it speaks both to a refreshing quality about the beer, and an utter lack of flavor. At least the flavors that were there were relatively well blended, and less offensive or starkly metallic than many others within the style."
""
""
"Pours pale yellow with a big white head and a lot of carbonation. No lacing on the glass. Smell is of adjunct, corn, cereal and minimal hops. Taste for the most part follows the smell and consistent with macrobrew, although I found it less repulsive than the bud family. Very thin mouthfeel. Ok drinkability."
"This is mediocre stuff. Which is strange, I don't recall Fosters being that bad..."

"It would be nice to have one of these beers for the sake of having something different, even if it's not really good. It's not bad though."
""
""
"Overall, I'm not opposed to a good beach beer now and then. I'll take a Foster's in an oil can any day over any other American Adjunct Lager. However, judging this beer objectively, it's as average as all of the others in it's class. But since I'm a beer geek and not a snob, I can drink this."

"Oil can no. JUN1112-E04150646. Sampled on February 20, 2012. Served in a frosted mug. The pour is pale yellow with a tremendous, foamy head. The aroma is of adjunct cereal/rice malts and cool, clean hops. The body is light. The taste is typically grainy for the style but there is also a slightly bitter ending. The can is the way to go on this one."
""
"Drinkability: I think the can is what provides most of the flavor. It is not offensive and is a decent lawnmower beer. Now I know why Australians don’t drink it. Enough said."

""
""
"During the summer this would be refreshing, but beyond that it's not worth your time."

""

"Sulfur and some sweet cereal grain, quite faint in aroma. Light grain in taste and very light bitterness from hop, slight sour in the finish. The body is light with watery mouth feel but very crisp yet fizzy. Overall, not a worthy brew, a bit dull."

"Wow id never thought i review this but after travelling overseas and seeing alot of this especially in the UK i thought i set the record straight this isnt our only macro beer but it seems to be doing well especially in Europe and unfortunately is well known and it pours a crystal clear yellow colour and leaves a frothy two finger head and no lacing really,the smell is grains,barley sugar and a touch of herbalness,the mouthfeel is a little fuller than expected and definately a little fuller than our other macros and the taste is basically the same as smell pretty insipid really with hints of malted barley,grains and liquid hops and overall i wouldnt drink this again unless of course its the only Aussie Macro option."

"The beer is completely transparent and light yellow colored with a thin, wispy head. The aroma is really mild. Hard to get much in the nose even after letting the beer warm up a bit. Perhaps some grain and general macro lager scents. The flavor is pretty bland, with some hints of corn and grain. Not awful or offensive in any way, but wholly unexciting. The body is extremely thin, as expected from an adjunct lager. Watery and easy to drink rapidly. Perhaps a decent beer to guzzle whilst eating spicy chicken wings or play beer games with, but not something I would choose to savor or relish."

"You can't really hate any beer type, unless it smells like you know. However, this particular brew is a commercially successful, and is quite quaffable for the money. Pours golden, nice but light acidity to the taste. Goes down smooth. This beer despite the ratings on the board is not going anywhere.."

"An okay beer but nothing to write home about. Would pass on it."

"Fosters: I was in a small town in Minnesota on business and was trying to go the week without beer, but after a hard day I broke down and did purchase a can of Fosters from the limited singles selection at the only liquor store. Poured into my hotels plastic cup, the Fosters looked like a drug test sample with a fine white foam on top. The aroma was unpleasant, like wet rags. The flavor was a disappointment: there was an overtone of an unnatural chemical like taste followed by an unpleasant bitter aftertaste. There is hardly a beer I do not like, but Fosters did fall into avoid at all cost category."
""

"Overall, this beer is solid. As far as adjuncts go this one is superb. The balance is there, the sweetness is minimal, and there's no hint of metal as is usually noticeable in this style. I would definitely put this in my tailgate cooler."
"Although there are beers like this with more flavor and lower price, that's not to demean it in any way. It's not worth the price in my opinion, but it's a good beer."
"Overall - Not a bad beer but nothing really special that stands out. I'd rather stick to something cheaper."
"Maybe it's just a 'grass is greener' effect, but the Aussies seem to really know how to make a proper adjunct lager. I like this stuff probably more than I should, and I had a similar opinion of VB. Don't get me wrong - it's an adjunct lager, so ultimately it's nothing to go out of your way for - but it's an adjunct lager done properly, with some character. I'd take this over most other Molson products any day."
"It is not something I would buy on my own. Like I said, just an average beer."
"I just dont get where this beer went. I know that as soon as MillerCoors took it over, it hasnt been as good. Anyways, I had this beer at Buffalo Wild Wings the other day and I was so disappointed. The appearance and smell were just terrible. It smelled and looked like your basic crap beer and I just wasnt impressed. The taste was the worst part of the beer. It was just of faint malt and that was really it. Overall this is one of the worst beers I have ever had. I can't stand anything about it and definitely the perfect drain pour."
"It looks nice standard medium yellow, frothy short lasting head. It taste's just ok, a ricey grain flavor to it with a mildly bitter aftertaste. the oil can is cute though."
"One of the least offensive adjunct lagers out there. Pours golden, good clarity, nice white head. Nose has slight cooked vegetables, cereal grains, and a Trace of smoky-metallic-herbal hops. Cereal grain sweet on the palate and the metallic hop element comes through. Not harsh. Not cooked veggies in palate either. Novelty oil can packaging is a change for me. Should I go sit on a street corner to imbibe ?"
"It was ok. I don’t think I’ll have it again. I just had to try it though. Call it a right of passage if you want."
"O: Not the greatest, not the worst. Probably wouldn't buy this again but if it were free I might drink it."
"Overall – I know this beer is rated poorly on this site, but there's something about the taste that I enjoy. It's still just an adjunct beer, but it has a few nuances that set it apart from the rest. You could do worse."
"330ml can/bottle served into a Lager glass.Enjoyed several times since 1987.Light golden yellow.Thin head,some foam slowly dissipated.Not noticeable hints of adjuncts.Slightly light maltiness,hues of hops & kind of bitterness...that´s all can be said about flavors.Boring beer.Thin body,medium carbonation.Watery."
"Overall not exciting, obviously just a macro beer"
"O: Not too impressed. A good beer to quench your thirst, but there are dozens of other beers I'd select before this light lager."
"T: Sweet and a little malty with a whole lot of grain. Very faint grassy hop presence. Verrry faint."
"Overall: Just another below average lager"
"I had about a half-a-finger of bone-white head that was on the wane by the time I was done with my pour and my lamentation. Color was a sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. My, but the nose was heavy in terms of cereal adjuncts! Man, if they were looking to nail the style, this was how to do it. Mouthfeel was medium with a curious admixture of cereal adjuncts and a metallic tang on the tongue. Still think that taste is relegated to the area of CANs? Guess again! Finish was bland, cereal-like and that metallic taste was what lingered. If I am ever to drink this again, it will be either on-tap or out of a CAN. This was brutal!"
"Not exemplary; particularly given that this tends to represent 'Australian beer' to most people. Although I have it on authority (from an Ozzie) that it isn't really sold in Australia - so it's just for export. Bland and pretty flavourless, with an unpleasant note to the aroma. If you must drink it, keep it cold...."
"O: an ok AAL.."
"O- Overall its fairly predictable. Not much aroma or flavor but not as bad as some."
"Still sitting in the Bahrain Airport Exec lounge and just happy to have beer again after being in Saudi Arabia. Foster'sis a golden clear colored beer. It has nice carbonation and white foamy head that appears to be lacing well. There is no smell....maybe grain...if any. Taste is ok...not the greatest...there is a bit of heaviness with this beer, unusual for an American adjuct Lager...I dont mind heaviness...but c'mon give me some better flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. Maybe there is a reason they dont serve Foster's in Australia!!!"
"overall this is a beer to avoid, even if you like lagers."
"The mouthfeel is nice, it's got a little less carbonation than standard for the style, although it's obvious this was designed to be drank straight from the can, as the carb is huge from there. The drinkability is quite good. As far as a cheap drink goes, this is not bad at all. The huge can cost me a buck and some change, and it's perfectly drinkable if not anything that'll wow me. You could do a lot worse on a budget."
"Overall - I must say that even though Fosters is Australian for beer, it should've been named the word that is Australian for mediocre. It's cheap at my local bar and now I see why..."
"I'd be happy to invite all you D-/F BA beer snobs to my desert dwelling for an ice-cold Foster's, but you'd probably rather die of thirst."
"Poured clear straw color, with a fizzy head that fizzles out pretty quickly. Light aroma of malts and stale hops. More of the same to the tongue with an acidic bitterness that leaves a rotten aftertaste. Thin, soda-like body. Crikey...not very drinkable at all, mate. (Sorry for that.) Please avoid this beer."
"Overall I would order it again as I enjoyed it along with my pizza."
"D: Very good drinkability. The ideal party beer, easy to throw a few of these back with no problem at all."
"Nothing special but considering the style this is a damn good beer. Put it up against BMC beers and it would win hands down. Malt profile is more complex than would be expected for the style. Adjucts are tasted but they're actually balance with the malts and taste quite good. Some earthy and stale ragidy hops in there but eh, that's the style. Less watery with more of a body, very crisp and refreshing. Definitely worth a try."
"Poured a pale gold with an enormous head. Let's say four inches or so. Mostly because I just couldn't get it to pour out of the can right. The mouth opening was poorly designed or something. Smelled very clearly metallic and sweet. C'est tout. It tastes like grainy metallic water. Refreshing, but the aftertaste is, once again, metallic. However, if it weren't for that this beer could almost rival Singha for refreshment as it doesn't taste TOO sweet and doesn't taste like corn. Still, Singha is clearly better. Foster's totally beats Busch, though. If this is on the same price scale in Australia as Busch is here, I'd say they have it a bit better over there. Cheers."
"This is what I ordered the first time I ate at the Outback Steakhouse. I ordered it simply because I hadn't tried this beer yet. I knew going into it that it was a standard lager and wouldn't be overly amazed by this. The beer is basically what I expected. It's yellow and clear with a pretty good head on it, the head actually leaves some nice lacing. The flavors are of the standard hops and malts. This beer is a little bit heavier on the belly than something like a Coors original or Budweiser. Apart from it's fuller body this beer isn't much different than the rest of the lagers in America."
"OVERALL - There have been only two beers that I have ever tried and vomited directly after drinking them. One is Miller Low Life. The other is Foster's Lager. I had the displeasure of trying this ""beer"" during my college years and I can honestly say that if I had to choose between Foster's, or a hand can of Steel Reserve with a wedge of Swiss Cheese blended into it, I would not hesitate to drink the Steel Reserve. Avoid like the plague."
"D. Only one other beer I have ever had is worse than this hogwash - San Miguel. One to avoid like the plague."
"O - It is a decnet beer for the macro crowd, but would not recommend it as a craft offering."
"Pours a clean, clear light yellow with active carbonation, big initial rush of head, diminishing into nothing quickly. Pale, light and watery scent with only faint touches of grain and grass. Taste follows scent with the pale and almost undetectable notes of pale malt and very faint presence of grassy hops. About the only positive is that there are now major off notes, not even vegitable notes found in many AALs. Light bodied, bubbly carbonation. Notable only for its lack of off notes in the style."
"I definitely will not have this beer again, but it's good to know what you like and what you don't like, so I'm glad I tried it."
"This is almost completely clear with a hint of yellow, like I just washed my tea bottle. The aroma is almost nonexistent, just a hint of grain. The taste is very light, a hint of grain and corn. Going down it's almost like flavored water but you can down a lot of it. If you're looking for a chug session beer, this is a good choice. If you're looking for quality, look elsewhere."
"A typical tonic water type mouthfeel, very similar to the majority of BMC products. Not something I'll drink again."
"Beer is medium to light in body and decent. Minimal aftertaste...is ""cold"" a flavor. It is very underwhelming, but maybe that's the point. I'm interested in trying the lager...but I won't have it again."
"Don't know how I liked this more before. Don't think it has changed, I have."
"I won't go out of my way to grab another one of these, but in a pinch I wouldn't turn one down either. If this is Australian for ""Beer", then poor, poor Australia. Somehow, I'm sure that's just US marketing though."
"Foster's is thin-bodied, highly-carbonated, and very average -- definitely not the beer I remember it being. I prefer it to some adjuncts, but it's worse than others -- I only drank it because my cellar is dwindling and it was on my porch. Maybe if I hadn't consumed it during a frigid winter it would've been slightly more satisfying. Chug it, or sip it if you have to, but don't savor it; seriously, just buy something better."
"Taste is fairly sharp and harshly bitter in an unpleasant way. Big sharp over carbonated mouthfeel with a dry slight off finish."
"I know it's not good as, say, Sam Smith's lager, but it's about the best lager for the masses that I've had. Lagers aren't my fav. And that's a shame considering that's what 90% of the beers in a small town grocery store are. But this one certainly has personality."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Appearance: Pours a clear, golden body with a foamy, frothy, white head. Smell: Sweet-smelling aroma with mere, vague hints of barley and little else. Taste: Sweet light pale malts with faint, fleeting grain hints. Incredibly small amount of floral hops and bitterness, leaving this one to finish sweet and somewhat crisp. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium-plus carbonation. Drinkability: Pass this one by, folks. Foster's has very little to offer beyond a simple, basic sweetness and some carbonation."
"Pours an ultra-clear, almost green, yellow. A creamy white head patches to the glass sides, and is mostly gone after a few sips. There is not much to the smell but some buttery biscuits, and a bit of phenol action. Taste is even more plastic, a bit of grainy adjunct flavor, forced bitterness all the while. Finishes like a chemistry experiment gone bad. blah."
"Not awful but certainly nothing to write home about. Very clear straw yellow with a very nice head and lacing to boot. Grainy smell lies underneath a flora hop character. Taste is much the same. Malt is kinda sweet turning to cereal and and bread. Mild smooth bitterness flows into a clean dry finish. Feel is rather thin and watery with light effervescent carbonation. Goes down easy enough when cold. A blast from my past this one. I drained quite a few oil cans of this in my youth. Certainly better than ""The King"" for my tastes but what isn't better than Bud?"
"Smells grainy with some astringent sharp like hop in the back. Taste is actually not bad at all. Its like a better Budweiser. The mouthfeel a bit more full and almost creamy like maybe because its a lager. You taste the grainy malt but tastes nicer than it smells which adds a pretty nice sweetness against some actual hop bitterness. I'm surprised. The hop bitterness almost reminds me of a Ballantine XXX ale. It leaves you with that sharp hop taste and grainy sweet malt taste. Probably my favorite Adjunct Lager... it has more of a hop presence than a Yuengling so I like this just a bit better actually...I'm surprised. It's brewed in the USA though by Oil Can breweries....which is good because I'm a vegetarian and I heard the American made version is vegetarian where the Australian made one isn't. If I want a cheap beer this is a good go to."
"For the style, which is a very maligned one, it is a good option. The hops are actually present, and the grains at the end are pleasing to me. And who doesn't love the oil can?"
"Overall - Not the worst beer I've ever had. Would I buy it again?... Very likely. Is it worth trying?... I'd say at least once. It isn't at all great, but it's not bad either."
"It's nothing spectacular in any way but in the oil can size, it's an easy and cheap way to get something better than BMC regular offerings."
"Served in a frost covered mug, not to my liking, but that was how it came. Color was a dark yellow, with a two finger head. Smell was strong, bitter wheat, corn, malt. Taste, well balanced, refreshing tastes of mild roasted wheat, rye, malt, with just a tickle of hops. Quite pricey for what you get, should have been there for happy hour. Not quite as I remember while I was on Guam, or visiting Australia."
"D- Too bitter for my liking. Has a very distinct after taste thats not pleasant or enjoyable at all."
"DO NOT BUY!"
"Pours a clear golden color. A bit darker than many of the style. Visible carbonation and a white head. The nose is grain with a bit of light adjunct. The taste is slight grain but most of the taste is washed away by carbonation fairly quickly. Crisp and light. Drinks decent enough and will quench your thirst, but not a particularly good beer."
"It surprised me I liked this as much as I did. Despite being just another cheap mass produced beer I did think the Lager was crisp, it had enough bitter hops to be noticed, and the sweetness of the malt was just about right. Average but upper average. At least I'd rather have this than a Bud or Coors or Miller..."
"RJT"
"Drinkability - no complexity at all, but tastes ok enough otherwise, at least just for ""drinking's sake""."
"D- It goes down easy enough. Once I get rid of whats in my fridge I'll never buy it again. I just bought it for the Bottle cap. Doing a bottle cap table."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a thick white tan head and some wimpy lacing. Smells of corn and some sweetness, possibly from some malts. Tastes a little grainy, corny, some bread, mostly water with some piss flavor added. Mouthfeel is really thin. Drinkability is poor."
"Drinkability: Please. The Aussies export it almost exclusively, and for good reason. Don't delude yourself into thinking this is an Australian beer. Fermented Kangaroo urine might do better for your taste buds."
"d- built for cheap binges, for that kinda beer i guess its decent"
"Mouthfeel is light in body and fizzy carbonation. Not a very pleasant aftertaste which has me taking sip after sip before I realize it should probably just be used to boil brats."
"* will still drink this at the salty dawg in Homer, AK but you get olives with it there (salty dawg martini)"
"Drinkability- Pretty good drinkabilty all things considered. I drank the entire ""oil can"" which is 750 ml."
"Very drinkable finished this big ole can in no time."
"D - Drinkable but only as a last resort option. I do like the large oil can size in this beer which is quite convenient."
"For such a common lager beer, Foster's has a unique taste. This is a good beer. This is the best beer to enjoy while barbequing and smoking a cigar. The color, smell and taste are all as good as a traditional lager can be. Imagine if Budweiser was actually drinkable, and that's what Foster's is!"
"crisping, refreshing, very light body with a light but bitter end, good in general terms if you want a lager for the beach or a hot day"
"Poured into a pint glass. I've had this beer many times but this is the first time I've actually poured it into a glass to observe it. Well here goes. A clear golden yellow with a two finger light foam head. Little retention. Some lacing down the sides. Tastes malty with little hop infusion. Reminds me of when I was in high school drinking Busch under the bleachers. Weak and watery. Not very well crafted, but it is what it is. Though it's not absolutely horrible, you're better off getting a good domestic brew like yuengling for 2 dollars cheaper per six pack. Just my opinion though."
"I didn't feel this beer was near as horrid as many make it out to be. Although not a personal favorite, I found it to be astoundingly drinkable. Ultimately, this beer is average. I wouldn't recommend it as a sipping beer but it's solid as a social beverage."
"D- Not any better than American macros. I'll pass."
"D-Easy drinking, but so is water. Not as good as Coors or Miller, but better than Bud. Surely Australia has better to offer."
"Served from a 25.4 oz can and poured into a pint glass. Nice gold color with a short-lived head and moderate lacing. Has a bitter but not overpowering smell. Taste is similar to the smell and unimpressive. Tastes almost watered down. Mouthfeel is unremarkable. I can't see myself drinking more than 1 or 2 of these in a siting."
"Chugging a can ice cold would be the best option."
"I'm completely satisfied that I've received my yearly requirement of Aluminum."
"D: Ice-cold Foster's is actually one of my guilty pleasures, but I like it better on tap. I can drink loads of the stuff on a hot day."
"the beer is really refreashing on a hot day though not a beer you drink for a lot of flavors"
"D. I wind up picking up one of these about once or twice a year and am never dissatisfied."
"How ironic is it that Foster's - the famous beer from Down Under - is actually contract-brewed in the Great White North? The brewery might want to send someone up here to check up on things because it seems to me the North American brewers must be screwing something up - no beer this plain and insipid could ever have become so popular as to be considered a national emblem for a nation of proud beer drinkers."
"Drinkability: Nothing about this beer stands out- not worth it."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is nice."
"Bud was a clear winner in terms of balanced drinkability."
"This isn't your typical macro. It has a unique taste and a unique aroma. If you are tired of the same old same old, then you may want to buy this beer, because its taste makes it stand out."
"Overall: The body of the beer is light and the finish is medium light. I have to say it, ""Fosters Canadian For Beer"". This is actually one of the better adjunct lager that I have tasted so far. The tinny note in the beer is offsetting and doesn't really go away. It is an okay beer."
"Tried one at Greg Norman's Australian Grille in Myrtle Beach, SC. It shows a watery pale straw yellow with just a vague white ring of head and barely a trace of lacing. The aroma is mellow cardboard sweet bread and a kiss of citrus. The flavor is dominant dry grass hops and a mild malt biscuit. A pretty stiff but tasteful carbonation though generally of weak constitution even for a lager. Plenty drinkable if you like what I would call a very ordinary flavor. Nothing memorable but a refreshing option for a few when in need."
"Overall: Absolutely not worth the extra few dollars. Pretty distinct from American versions though."
"Foster's Lager seems to be more popular in China and other parts of Asia than it is in Australia. In fact, I don't know ANYONE in Australia who actually drinks this stuff! It's obvious, now that they have put an ""Export Quality"" sticker around the neck of the bottle. Anyone who has watched ""The Adventures of Barry MacKenzie"" where he tries to smuggle a case of Fosters Lager onto a plane to England must know that he is literally taking the piss, because NOBODY drinks this here! In Hong Kong, however, it's a premium beer at every restaurant. Tastes like sugar-flavoured soda water with heavy malt and no hops. Drinkable, but hard to call it a beer."
"Even if the first taste is not very famous, mouth slightly, gives, by its hopping, an overview sunny bitterness that leads to an interesting aftertaste with a frankly not bad at all. The beer is drunk very easily, just like warm milk. Nice american premium lager"
"Pours straw yellow with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. There isn't much going on with the nose as it smells very similar to all macro lagers-malty, ever so slight touch of hops, and some mustiness. The taste is pretty much the same except this beer seems a little more crisp than some others of the style. It also doesn't have that musty malty flavor that sometimes seems prevalent in PBR. It is very carbonated and watery, but exceptionally easy to drink even for the style. I purchased a whole twelve pack just to have something easy to drink while grilling on a Friday night. My Foster's Friday ended up being a Foster's weekend. I will never purchase this again because I can get PBR or Miller High Life for a few dollars cheaper."
"My neighbor offered me a Fosters last night knowing I have made a number of trips to Melbourne, Australia. I explained that Fosters is primarily exported or brewed under license overseas. Since 2008 it has been brewed by SABMiller in North America. It is vertually impossible to find in Australia, although The Fosters Group is the largest brewer there and makes Calton Draught & Victoia Bitter which are the primary beers in Melbourne & Victoria area."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Overall impression: Like Creed, this beer is unoriginal, bland and mainstream. And you pay a premium for it because its an import. Why even bother? Get the MGD or the Miller High Life. They're cheaper and taste about the same."
"D - Well I have at least a 12 pack left over from a party and as the weeks go by I might hit a bottle now and again but really wouldn't buy this for myself. Regardless if the only lagers left in the world was MGD or Fosters I would drink fosters!"
"I've always liked Foster's. It's by no stretch of the imagintion great, but a very drinkable macro lager. Looks like a typical yellow fizzy mass produced beer. Smell has some sweetness with some metalic caned corn notes coming out. Some grassy malt is in there. Nice and crisp with lots of carbonation. Goes down pretty smooth. A little bitter bite in the aftertaste. It is what it is. Good mass consumption beer for a cookout. I've heard that they hate it in Australia and can't stand the commercials. I can't really blame them for that. Very decent beer in my opinion."
"Notes: Fairly standard Adjunct Lager, but that hint of fruitiness makes it a bit more desirable for me. However, it is still light, watery, and pretty much devoid of hops and most other tastes."
"One taste lets me know I will not buy this again. I will finish this 6 pack and think back to the days when Fosters was a pretty decent beer from down under, mate."
"D) Pretty good for this style! Refreshing and mild, good to wash down a meal or on a hot day. 25 ounces is A LOT though for something that is not so good. But for what it is, it's okay!"
"Sadly Im guessing this is the Budweiser of Australia?"
"Yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste are typical macro like.It is refreshing and smooth.It's at it's best when it's ice cold.Perfect for summer outings or when watching football games.I've always been a fan of macros and this is no exception."
"This review is for the beer in the oil can. The colour of the beer is piss yellow with fizzy carbonation. The smell is not much better, nothing more than corn and rice, with some grassy hops. The taste was metal mixed with adjuncts and the mouthfeel was light. Overall, this beer does not pass muster, though it is better than other adjunct beers."
"Drinkability - Ok consumption, easy to drink would have a few more."
"Have stayed away from this one for a few years and with good reason. Could be me, but seems like this beer has gotten worse since then. About the best thing I can say for it is that I love big cans like this and that I have had much worse beer. Next time I get the burning desire to grab an oil can off the supermarket shelves, it will probably be a Molsen XXX."
"Overall: Foster's, Australian for piss."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Mouthfeel, no hop quality to it, any potential confusion of some hop zest is probably due to the vast amount of bubbles in it. Drinkability? Eh, tastes like a very watered down, carbonated beer."
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. I have not had this brew in a very long time and bought the can so I can attempt to cook a beercan turkey. I drank and enjoy this beer a lot in college but today was wondering what the attraction was. Tastes like imported yellow fizzy stuff."
"D: easy to drink, but must be cold. good choice if you goto outback i guess"
"Drinkability is ok. It does go down easy and would be a good session beer. But overall the taste doesn't leave me wanting anymore. I will drink it, but I wouldn't go looking for more."
"Drinkability: Pass this one by, folks. Foster's has very little to offer beyond a simple, basic sweetness and some carbonation -- like a soda!"
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a 4 inch head that leaves lots of lacing. The appearance is pale and crystal clear. The smell is mainly of malts with a hint of hops. The taste is slighly hoppy with moderate sweetness and malt taste. I don't get any hint of adjunct aroma or taste here. The feel is light to medium bodied with a clean finish. This is a very drinkable beer."
"D: Decently drinkable; nice counterbalance to heavier flavors, especially those of grilled meat."
"D- Glad I split the 25oz can because i suspect the carb would of did some damage to me with some bubble guts. Perhaps if that was toned down i would be able to finish the oil can by myself, for now smaller cans would be ideal. I suspect this tastes like shit out of a bottle so the can is the only way i would go. The taste is not memorable, but it's also not horrifying."
"D: Goes down pretty smooth but has a weird after taste."
"I can never even finish a single can/bottle/glass of this because it gets so boring to drink"
"If you're not drinking this from an ""oil can"" you're not experiencing what Fosters should be! Darker than it's US counterparts with a more pungent and malty smell. Taste has a real bite too it, but flavorful at the same time. Mouthfeel is nothing special. Drinkability is good, but get that can done before it starts to get warm! Goes best with BBQ'd walaby or platypus."
"Drinkability: this beer is on the bad side of mediocre, even for an adjunct lager. I'm not gonna dump it out, but I doubt I'll be buying another one again."
"Drinkability: Pretty much your typical macro. Don't waste your time or money on this worthless import when there are plenty of cheaper, better macros out there."
"The taste was malty and and very light. It went down smooth but i was not impressed overall by the slight difference than that it had with an American Lager."
"Pours the typical pale yellow/golden color with an average white head. Smell and taste are typical of the kind. Thin mouthfeel. For whatever reason, I find Foster's to be slightly more enjoyable and drinkable than other adjuncts. That said, it's still an adjunct. Nothing interesting going on here at all."
"Pours a clear light gold with a big persistent white head. Aroma is very faint. Maybe a little malt and some grassy hops but there's not much there. Tastes sweet. Malt maybe some adjucts- rice. Maybe just a touch of herbal hops. A bit watery. Overall this is not offensive at all- there's just very little to it. Easily drinkable. Passable for the style."
"Of the macro imports I have purchased, this is one of the better ones... But, like heineken, for maximum enjoyment it must be had via can."
"D: This is your run of the mill macro lager. Nothing offensive, but certainly nothing memorable either."
"D- very plain but goes down easy."
"Taste: Medium bodied with a sweet corn taste initially that finishes off with more of hoppiness then expected (although there is not too much to speak of). For the most part it is refreshing and crisp but a little lacking in flavor"
"Overall impression: I'm certainly not above enjoying an adjunct lager now and then, but I won't be reaching for the giant blue can again."
"Well, the only thing that classifies this a beer is that its beer. Pours golden with a slim head into a pilsner from a 650 ml bottle. The smell is hoppy, but has got no other character that I can recall. Ok, now for taste, mouthfeel and drinkability - its a little above carbonated water. My last choice for ordering outside and I would never buy it. The advertising is good though."
"Drinkability - methinks this is precisely what it was brewed for, and they did a fairly decent job of it."
"Not the worst of lager's, but I can get something better, cheaper locally."
"This is a highly drinkable brew. There is no question about it. It's for getting your swill on, and nothing else. Too bad this is what most Americans think of, when they think of Australian beer."
"Taste is sweet malts and adjuncts. Highly carbonated and light bodied. Does not taste too incredibly different than most macro lagers. It is not bad tasting on a hot day, but why spend 7 bucks on a sixer of this when you can get PBR or Keystone for at least 2 bucks cheaper?"
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of a sweet corny nature. It is extremely simple, but it is more pronounced than most adjunct lagers, and that is nice. The taste even cornier than the aroma. Again it is straight forward, and very pronounced. However, it isn't the most pleasant taste I've experienced from an adjunct lager, but I wouldn't call it unpleasant. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that is moderate for the style. Overall, I have some fond memories of drinking Foster's. I haven't drank it for well over four years, but it is a lot like what I remembered. It isn't the greatest beer out there, but it is one of the better beers of its style."
"Poured from 24 oz can into tall ale glass. Light lager yellow color, clear of particulates. Huge head. Smells like hops and corn-just shy of sweet. Tastes like you expect a lager to taste, no big deal. Weak mouth feel, yet when it is 100+ F that is not a bad thing. Drinkability, well that depends upon the temperature. If it was 68 F, I would go for something more substantial. Since it is 98 F here at the beach, this beer is very drinkable."
"Drinkability: While this isn't a fantastic beer, for what it is, it's not bad. It's something I could drink."
"D- Pretty high. This is plain ol' beer, but if that's what you're looking for, it works pretty well. Good for a day on the beach or a cookout with burgers and dogs."
"Drinkability - Was not drinkable at all; not because of what it has in it, but rather what it lacks in it."
"Poured from a can into a weizen glass. Has a gold color with a 1/2 inch head. Hardly any smell to speak of. Taste is rather bland with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Feels light and watery in the mouth. It is fairly drinkable. Overall a truely average beer."
"A drinkable lager. And who doesn't miss the ""its australian for beer"" commercials?? (Salad. Beer. Guppy. Beer.)"
"Average adjunct lager if you prefer the unusual harshness and taste."
"d- wouldn't buy, not a good adjunct in my opinion, ok to drink if you wanna have eight beers, not to enjoy or savor them."
"Notes - This beer particular beer is extremely old, so reviewing it may not be entirely fair. Oh well. It actually wasn't as bad as I expected, somewhat better than the Heineken I had recently. It had more flavor, anyway. Not that that's saying much."
"Absolutely disgusting beer. I only bought it because it was the only beer in the bodega that wasn't bud, corona or coors light. the taste makes me want to vomit. Don't be fooled by it being an import or the fact that you can buy it in an ""oil can"". Go elsewhere. Or buy the Bud, it tastes just as bad."
"This beer is awful. It has a light yellow color with minimal head or lace. It smelled like it was brewed with extra tin flavoring. Yum!! Initially the taste was ok when it was ice cold. But as it warmed the funk was so unbearable I literally could not finish it. It was acrid. Mouthfeel was not bad when cold. It lost it's carbonation quickly. It was like chewing on an aluminum can. This is nasty shit! Will not buy again. Ever."
"For a sunny patio, not a bad choice, given the happy-hour pricing and the other myriad distractions, but overall, nothing special, just another macro lager, transposing international boundaries and breweries. I don't think I'd order it again in many other circumstances."
"I expected worse, this was somewhat refreshing."
"D - Not a bad example of a light lager, a bit bland and the sulphur aroma is slightly off-putting, but highly drinkable nonetheless. I really surprised myself with this review as I thought I really disliked Fosters, but it had been years since I had it and for what it is, it really isn't that bad."
"If I had to buy cheap lager, this would be in my top five. But then again, when do you HAVE to buy cheap lager? If I'm offered this vs. Carling at a mate's house (as I was today), I'm going for the Foster's."
"Seriously, this beer's 15 minutes is long up."
"Out of a big blue oil can this beer was a perfectly clear gold color. The head was white, three-fingers, displayed average retention and streaky lacing. The aroma was dry and stale, typical macro-grains. The flavors started clean enough but ended stale. Boring macro-grains dominated the palate at first but more pale malt became apparent as it warmed up. Simple, but not really bad. The mouthfeel was average and a little oily, the body light/medium and the carbonation medium/high."
"A clear golden lager color,slightly darker than most of the macros,huge soapy white head,with some soft lazy carbonation. Aroma of light grain,hay, and a touch of hops,nothing new or special. Flavor is slightly sweet at first,then a hint of bitterness,and finishes with a bit of malt,and this touch of citrus,very light . Typical lager mouthfeel,crisp,and refreshing,quite sessionable, I like the big can though.An ok adjunct lager."
"This beer is worth a try but Foster may be Australian but not for beer."
"Poor man's euro lager. Yellow and clear out of the tap. I don't care about foam/collar/whatnot. Smell is clean with some generic sweet notes. Taste is sweet, earthy hop flavor as well with a good balance. Mouthfeel is very smooth, creamy with a somewhat dry finish. I could, and did, drink a few without effort."
"Conclusion: Just ok; this is an odd beer, a bit inferior for the style."
"75cL oil can while watching Oz GP practice. Pours urine yellow with a fizzy white head that disappears to nothing quite quickly. Smells faintly of malt/adjuncts, as well as very light hopping. Similar light malt taste; next to no bitterness. Clean and refreshing, at least."
"D: higher score here simply because it's not appalling to drink, and is easy if you're just looking to have a lot"
"D: not the worst beer i've had, but not something i'll come back to for a while"
"Final Thoughts - This beer is pretty much your standard Adjunct Lager, that's maybe slightly better then most because it doesn't leave a bad taste. It's boring to the taste, but can be put back faster then water and is clearly designed to get you hammered as fast as possible. Nothing much more can be said for this beer."
"Smooth and drinkable for the style. No off flavors. Worth a try in a pinch."
"Drinkability equals ok."
"Drinkability- very drinkable beer, an obvious session choice for man, not a terrible macro lager and its one i would choose far ahead of many macros but obviously far behind many others, good ice cold with my tacos I am eating tonite, good cheap guzzling beer,"
"My father swears by this and Beck's. I'm rather disappointed by this beer, maybe I'll give it another go someday, maybe a fresher bottle/can. Who knows."
"Pours a very light golden, straw colow, with almost no head and no lacing. Nuetral scent, very light with sweetness and no detectable hops. Good crisp taste, not much there, but also no bad attributes; light, sweet, malt with no skunkiness. Goes down very smoothly. A good version of the style."
"D- very good. A nice easy drinking lager."
"D: I can not believe I bought a can of the premium ale as well. Maybe a chance to redeem? Otherwise I can think of a notable bunch of macro lagers to reach for before this guy. A beer travesty..."
"d: The usual for this style: lack of body and flavor allows it to go down like water, but why bother?"
"Fair atmosphere, flavor is not bad although nothing to get excited about either. Light bodied, but aftertaste is a little off. Does have a certain refreshing quality, in a thirst quenching kind of way. Decent quaff."
"D 2.5 - okay for free, good on ABV, okay on taste, smell is a turn off. tastes better than I remember since my palate has been more educated..."
"Bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a clear light gold with very little head that is gone is seconds with no lacing. It is a little darker than similar macro lagers. The smell is absent. Taste is a little better. You can pinpoint malts and that is about it besides water. It feels crisp and has high drinkability. I would prefer this beer over other macro lagers, but honestly I would debate ordering a water if this was the best choice."
"Nothing too special here, as expected, but I thought it was much better than most of the other mass imported beers and a lot better than BMC stuff. It was super drinkable and really quenches your thirst with no off flavors at all. Pours very light, but the taste is nice and barley loaded and goes down smooth. You can even say I was impressed with this one."
"Very average."
"Just didn't really care for this beer. I would rather have a Pabst or Bud if I'm gong to drink this style. Way to heavy on the adjunct flavors to me."
"This review might sound a bit brief, but everything on it is true, i guess you are just going to have to taste it to see ;)"
"Okay, I've been told by an Aussie that this is their equivalent of a Miller/Natural Light. Still, its not terrible off the tap. Yellow with big white head. Sugary metallic aroma. Taste is grain and malt (way more metallic in the oil can). Can be inconsistent."
"Pours a very light yellow color body, very clear. Has a big head which is diminishing. The aroma is sweet, with some malts. Has a bitter taste, dusty, and very little flavor. Has a bitter aftertaste."
"Woeful lager, about the only one i've had that tastes of pretty much nothing. Also I think they must put some unpleasant chemicals in this, can lead to nasty side effects. So best to be careful drinking this. Then again it is lager so you could go on a bender and have 10 pints!"
"Oil Can poured into my pils glass, I admit once in a while I love to grab an oil can simply because of that damn big can. The beer is solid swill but cheap lager nonetheless. Grainy aroma lots of corn. Always a great pour that produces a towering foamy white head leaving large amounts of lacing. Mouthfeel is slightly fuller than the typical swill but still finishes weak. Flavor, eh nothing important to note. Australian for swill."
" Sure I'd rather be sitting down and relaxing with a Flemish Sour, or maybe a Gouden Carolus and a nice cheese, but hell I'm certainly not above a good session of pounding this pseudo-Aussie lager ;)"
"Had in a large, fist consuming can. This beer is certainly one of the better American Macro Lagers out there, its taste is relatively in-offensive and goes down smoothly. I have only good things to say about this beer, especially considering its price and general availability. Solid session beer."
"D: Not worth the premium this beer commands simply for being from Australia. Better macros are out there for much less money."
"Drinkability : a not impressed beer in the style American lager is only refreshing."
"Taste: Malts and Hops. Flavor is fairly light but it's pretty good for a macro. I was pretty surprised by the fact I could actually taste hops in a macro."
"Got two cans of Foster's the other day cause the store wouldn't sell me a 40. Honestly, I'm betting the 40 would have been better. This beer - at least the canned version - is truly disgusting. Strong, in your face malt and skunk, coming off a definite piss yellow color. Thin and insipid. Really, if I'm looking for something refreshing, I'll go for a wheat or even a freakin' Miller Light."
"drank a glass, but not feeling much need to finish the oil can. and it's overpriced too."
"It pours a typical Macro brew yellow. Nothing special but not horrible. I have had far worse. I would drink this again."
"A little fizzy in the mouthfeel. This is a rather clean finisher, which leads to a decent drinkability rating. Good beer for a hot day of yardwork, but not much else. Not the worst I've had, but no where near the best."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Grainy sweetness, a bit husky and rough around the edges, but reasonably clean overall. Not much of a hop presence, even in the finish. This is somewhat excessively carbonated; the mouthfeel is annoyingly fizzy. The finish is moderately drying and extremely brief. This is drinkable but mediocre."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with a thick creamy head. Smell is of barley. Slight skunkiness to the taste, bitter and an off-taste. Terrible aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very watery. Not a great beer, I expected more. The taste was not there, I would prefer to stay with ""american"" beers on a hot afternoon."
"The beer equivalent of supermarket white bread. Lets face it - we all know that Foster's is crap and Australians don't drink it. Sadly, it is actually better than some of the crap that Australians DO drink. Hopefully one day our proud country will be represented by a more worthy beer."
"D: Quite drinkable, good choice as a pair with a burger or steak dinner. Decent session brew, decent price."
"Poured a clear golden color with a flimsy white head that didnt last long. Didnt smell of much, watery. It tasted better than I had expected. I expected it to taste water down but it had some body to it. Very carbonated, it was spritzing in my mouth but added a weird spice flavor. Overall I enjoyed it, could of had another."
"I usually only drink these when I can get an oil can on special, so I'm drinking em for the price, but if you looking for a great beer look elsewhere."
"I can't understand how this company stays in buisness selling this beer and I use beer in the loosest sense of the word. The appearance being urine yellow with a white head. The smell was skunky and maybe a bit of herb. Taste was bitter and seltzery, not alot going on. Mouthfeel felt a little bubbly not much else. It was barely memorable which is the only good thing I can say about it."
"D: Simple, cheap and thirst-quenching. Not a disappointment, but not something that lives up to the commercials. If you buy it, it won't be terrible, but don't expect a whole lot."
"Fosters is a pretty poor beer, however it still beats most other American Macros comparably...The beer itself lacks any sort of decent appearance that would ""awe"" someone...the nose and flavor is thin, almost non existent, and lacks any sort of ""positives"" that I generally look for in an American Macro"
"Definitely over-rated. Golden color topped with a fairly thick head that fizzles down pretty quickly. Pretty good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly skunked and the taste has a hoppy bite with a note of skunk as well. Because of that it doesn't really go down all that well. I'll watch the commercials but I'd rather stay away from the beer itself."
"Drinkable. The mild carbonation and muted flavors make it easy to get down. I didn't dump it down the drain but I wouldn't buy it again unless I wanted to get drunk quick on foreign macro lager. Good for beer bongs, games of asshole and quarters."
"Ok, this isn't the best example of the style out there but it sure is pleasing and easy drinking enough. Though I never reviewed the brew when it was contract brewed in Canada, this US version doesn't stray much from the path if at all. This is an ok, middle of the road brew that shouldn't offend anyone's palate because, frankly, the flavours *aren't* offensive. It is decent and a good alternative if you are taking a break from big, strongly flavoured microbrews. It helps to put things in proper perspective. ;^)"
"D: Not my first choice but would definitely choose this over the 3 american macro-lagers. Was average at best."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, albeit a bit boring stuff, though for the import price tag I could get a Sam Smith or a Sam Adams so probably not going on the menu, unless I move down under."
"Not a bad for a macro. I used it to cool off from some outdoor activity on a hot steamy July day, and it did the job. If you have to go macro, consider the oil can from Foster's."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"Not sure I can say I'm a fan."
"Average mouthfeel with a pretty good level of drinkability for a macro..."
"All that said, the beer is definitely drinkable, and even a good 20F above what most would drink it at, its still quite satisfying to quaff on this very warm evening."
"Drinkability is pretty decent. There's no question that you can pound down a few of these in one sitting, however it mostly comes off as just an above average lager. Not a bad brew from down under!"
"Mouth: Begins with a seltzery flavor and feel up front, blending further back in the mouth with sweeter, malty character. Warming touches of alcohol in the back. Body feels thinner in the mouth than it looks in the glass, though flavor is much better than aroma (thank God)..."
"Skip it unless you want to take a glamour shot of it with your camera. Ultimately dumpable. Bye-bye."
"Tastes like rather plain. Not bad, just unremarkable. The kind of beer you drink and quickly forget about it."
"Notes: Foster's, Australian for cheap American macro lager beer."
"Purchases in some sort of minature oil can. Pale straw hue with a foamy head. Smells like old trash can ooze and cut grass. The nose is really unbearable. The body is fairly medium for a macro lager. However, still way too carbonated. Not exceptionally drinkable unless you drink it at freezing temperatures."
"D: Very easy to drink, just a basic macro lager."
"The taste is grain, flowers, with light sweetness but a dominant, unpleasantly rough & sharp bitterness. The flavour is very thin and it is very watery."
"I know, as beers go this is somewhat on the light side; but there is nothing more refreshing than a Foster's on tap in a cold mug with a nice steak at Outback. Gorgeous golden color, nice carbonation, thick head (albeit short lived) and a nice, rich malty scent in the nose. Taste is malt with a touch of hops, obviously a bit more watery than many micros; but a step above (IMHO) the typical BMC fare. Any beer tastes better on tap and this is no exception. Avoid the bottles, but try it the next time you order wings. It's a great, drinkable option. Think ""gold."" Tastes like it looks."
"A decent draft. Good colour in the glass, yellow gold. White head which dissipates slowly. Alittle bit of lace. Good nose hints of corn and yeast. Nice gentle bitters common in this beer style. I would judge this a thirst quencher on a hot day. Good with wings too. Mouthfeel was balanced."
"This could be any number of sub-par pilsener style lagers in a different can. No complexities; unremarkable in every way. Just another grainy, weak, adjunct-filled lager. Didn't bother to finish the whole can and won't buy again. The best thing about this beer is the commercials."
"Golden yellow with a thin white head. Aromas of sweet grains and maybe a little corn and sulfur. The flavor is your typical macro - cereal grains/ corn, and some sweet malt that can easily go sour, but Foster's has a little more smoothness and roundness and cleanliness than many of its companions when judged within its category. Light body, finishes grainy and bubbly, very good drinkability - I got my apartment clean while watching college hoops and listening to some music. It's not about rating this higher than some craft beers, but properly assessing it within its given category, so when you ask yourself, ""sheesh, what is this guy on?"" Well duh, I'm on beer man. Geez..."
"While Foster's lacks the depth of a solid lager, and its mouthfeel is very close to water, it is very easy to quaff in large quantities. The price is the big stumbling block; add $1 to the price of an oilcan and one can buy any of a long list of quality beers. Given that opportunity cost, it's hard to recommend Foster's over either a fine lager or a cheaper macrobrew."
"D - Probably would not have more of these. Definitely better lagers out there. On a good not would probably go well with a nice spicy meal."
"D- This beer goes down easy. I enjoyed this more than other macro beers. If your gonna session on a low budget this would not be a bad choice. The colder the better."
"Drinkability - Not bad, not great either."
"Not the worst macro I've had, and is fine in a pinch. Yet there is so much better out there, why settle?"
"appearance is of a yellowish color. It has a nice semll. Taste is decent cooked vegetables. not a whole lot going on though. On tap it is drinkable i wouldnt recommend a the can."
"If it weren't for the oil can presentation, I'd probably never get Foster's. It's the ""more bang for your buck"" lager, so get it specifically on the grounds of cheap-o economics."
"The fosters beer didn't really stand out on my list of favorites. The beer does not live up to the hype that it does. the taste was average and the smell was much like most lagers but just didn't stand out like the others i have tried. It does drink well with cheese and crackers but average is the only thing I can say about this beer."
"drinkability - Reminds me of a Corona and a Heini mixed. Was ok, but i don't like the skunked aftertaste."
"D- Above average macro lager, the classic aussie lager."
"""Enjoyed"" this in the big boy can. Airy smell of grain (maybe one can pick up corn or something) and alcohol. They market themselves from being different (read: better) than an American macro, but it maintains the same smell and appearance. It looks like every other macro, w/ a pale gold color with heavy carbonation. This carbonation outweights the hoppy, watery taste and just dries out the tongue. I will stick to having a can once in a blue moon."
"Macros are supposed to be easy drinking, but I can not get past how bad this one tastes so even though it is pretty mild, I could not drink very many of these."
"I rarely drink this style; I bought it to practice for my BJCP test. I'd certainly pick it over many others in the style, however."
"Pours a slightly golden straw color with a pure white head that left some spot lacing as it dissipated. The smell is almost non-existant. There is some light grain aromas. The taste is of grain and cooked veggies. Adjunct sweetness is noticable. No malt or hop presence what so ever. Typical macro. The feel is light, fizzy and a bit astringent. Typical macro, great on a hot day or tailgating. I'm a sucker for the oil can but that only goes so far. Serves as a BMC replacement if needed."
"Cheers!"
"My score is more reflective of the beer within the style than my personal tastes."
"This is your typical American Macro style Lager. It pours a fizzy Golden/yellow, has a one finger head with some decent retention and some soapy looking lacing left over. The aroma is faint of corn syrup and I get a little bit of hops but not enough to talk about. The flavor is slightly spicy compared to most beers of this style but that hardly makes it standout. This beer is drinkable if served icy cold but I wouldn't try it warm."
"I kind of like this lager and I get it because of the huge can which is kind of a novelty. I also kind of liked the crocodile dundee-type commercials."
"I can get this canned, bottled, or on tap. This review is for the tap variety. I drank a big mug at the Outback steakhouse in El Cajon. Pairs very nicely with their prime rib. The aroma was barely detectable due to the beer being served to cold and in a frozen mug. What nose there was showed some earthy biscuits and sweet malts. Color was a clear golden-brass color with large foamy white head. The head showed some lacing and lasted a log while. Flavors of yeast, biscuit, light malts and cedar. mouthfeel was a bit thin and watery. Anti-climatic finish with mild hops that leaves you wanting a big steak (so its a good thing they serve this at a steakhouse!). Overall: Recommended with conditions and reservations."
"D - Its not a terrible beer I'd rather drink this than a BMC but its more of a lawn mower beer"
"D: I would not really say this was that good of a macro! Granted most macros have no taste or body or anything when compared to most craft brews, but this beer made other macros seem like Lion's Stout!"
"Fosters Lager pours a crystal clear light golden color with a beautiful thick foamy head that rides way above the lip of the glass and stays. The smell is sweet and clean with a light graininess. The graininess if stronger in the flavor with more clean sweet light malts. The finish is bitter in an astringent way, not in a hoppy way. Overall not a bad beer for $2."
"Very average lager. Nothing remarkable about this beer. Might be described as the ""Budweiser of Australia", which is definitely not a compliment. Pours yellow/golden color with white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma was nothing special, and the taste seemed a bit on the metallic side. This was served to me way to cold in a mug that was practically iced over. If this is ""Australian for Beer", then this is my last from down under."
"D: Fine, though that big oil can has a lot of beer in it, as much as a wine bottle, 750 mL, so about halfway in, I found myself not drinking any for about 30 minutes, I found it just disinterested me, for an American Macro Lager it's not bad, but compared to some of the better European-style lagers, it just doesn't stand up."
"Wish beer was as good as the ""Australian for Beer"" commercials"
"Certainly not a bad beer, just not a good one, either."
"It's not good. Lawn-mowing, sit by the pool kind of beer - and only if bottles aren't allowed. It comes 2 keg cans for 3.50 for a reason."
"Outside of the head retention, this is pretty much a run-of-the-mill macro at best (with a bit more astringency than normal). Why pay the import price on it? In fact, not one to bother with anyway. Not horrible for the style, but nothing special either. Canadian...I mean Australian for ... beer.(?) Whatever..."
"All in all, I could drink it again, and probably could've had another can."
"Had this on tap recently and its appearance is probably its most impressive attribute. Pours a dark amber with a foamy white head. Some lacing is retained while you finish, but not much. Not much of a smell--slight malt. The taste is solid -- better than a Bud, but, like Australians seem to think of Foster's--it's pretty basic. High carbonation so the mouthfeel and drinkability is just OK. Not the worst beer I've had by any stretch of the imagination, but nothing to write home about. Have it when you go to the Outback, get it if a six-pack is on sale for $9.99 at the local grocery store, but that's about it."
"While Ive tried plenty of macros in the past, Ive only reviewed a small handful. Not a bad alternative. I might actually prefer it to some of the other true Canadian imports. Having a beach party and dont want to share your micro/craft faves? Stock up with this and you wont go wrong."
"I'd review in detail but there's no point. This was a typical macro lager, clear pilsner appearance, very neutral but not objectionable taste, easy to drink and quenches thirst while not challenging the palate."
"Pours a mild yellow color with a nice frothy head. Aroma is sweet and still somewhat bitter like a typical lager. Taste is much of the same except that there's a bit more flavor at the back of the tongue. Nothing impressive but it does go down pretty easily. Still somewhat better than a lot of macro lagers I've had."
"My favorite thing about Foster's is the very large can. That means you have to go to the cooler half as frequently... which is nice."
"Taste like hops and grains, this beer is very easy to drink,to be honest i expect a little bit more of this beer."
"Definite stinky boiled corn and other vegetable flavours in both the aroma and taste. Standard overcarbonation for this type of lager. Pale yellow in colour. Only had one then switched back to the others. Not recommended."
"i used to drink this when i wanted a big beer (volume wise) when out at crap bars and before i really got into better beers. it's just not significantly different than any other american macro lager, certainly not any worse, but for this style you're just not gonna get a good beer. i think corn is the adjunct in this one. as for any other descriptors, anyone reading on this site can figure out what this beer is like without me droning on...but for $3 for a double can of beer at the local dive bar, at least i had an excuse for drinking this. kind of."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a tiny head with no retention or lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). This beer is not very impressive, kind of disappointing. Has almost no aroma, and what you can pick up is mostly malted corn. Malted corn also very evident in the flavor. A boring, not so flavorful beer....tastes like the standard macro, but not quite as good. Has a light, crisp feel in the mouth, with a good amount of carbonation. Not really worth trying, unless you want to try THE Australian beer. Except..when my friend went to Australia last year, she said no one drinks this beer, and locals will laugh at you if you order. Since I have never been there, I cannot verify this, but it's not that great of a beer anyway."
"This is probably one of the best macro lager's around. It pours a light gold with a nice frothy head, that sticks around. You can smell and taste a bit of maltiness, but it is not overpowering. You can feel that slight carbonated fizzle, that quickly goes away. It is, in my opinion very drinkable. I would recommend everyone trying it out of their oil can! It's a great deal, as you get 25oz. of goodness, for a modest price in most places."
"as well. Thin and not good."
"Cheers!"

"When I originally tried this it was brewed in Canada by Carling O'Keefe Brewing Company under license from Elder's Brewery in Australia. Elders eventually gave a huge sum of money to Molson Brewing Company to buy Carling O'Keefe (with some money from the Miller Brewing Company). When I did my Ph.D in Tennessee, I saw Foster's in the supermarket...it was brewed by Molson in Canada (and distributed in Reston, Virginia)."
"A rough,grainy mouthfeel not overbearing but not weak either had some bite to it,also was very dry.The dryness did slightly increase the drinkability a bit. Had no trouble finishing the 25.4 oz can it actually when down quite nice about all you could ask for in a Micro. Would drink this beer in a pinch no problem. One of the better Macro's around. Don't know why it rated so low i thought it was a decent offering for what it is."
"I was at a bar with an Australian when I had my Foster's in Toronto. We ended up polishing two pitchers of it, and I didn't mind it at all. He said the North American version was better than the Australian version. Geez, I can't imagine what the Australian version tastes like after my canned sample."
"Overall: a brisk and refreshing adjunct lager. Nothing great about it but it can be nice on a hot day."
"What have I done? I hadn't had this for ages. Thought I'd give it a shot, see how it measures up now that I think I know what good beer is. From where I'm sitting, this ain't even close to good beer. >>Drainpour<<"
"D - Great. This is an excellent stab at the style. One of the better American macro lagers IMHO."
"Eh good day mate! Foster's the Aussie's #1 macro? Typical lager smell, roasted corn and semi sweet hops. Nice head when poured into a glass. Colour is golden as one would expect. Mouthfeel is good carbonation is not too much, not too little. Taste is classic lager with sweet hop start and a tart bitter hopped finish. This beer is good cold. Goes good with a barbecue or after mowing the lawn. Good flavor and a clean finish, refreshing beverage, but not unique by any means."
"Wow, is really all I can say, and not in a good way,LOL. Poured rom an oil can in a pilsner glass, no real head, no lace, just pale golden nothing. Smell was must and moldy grain. The feel was too light, essentially non existent with just a light bread like taste. Overall this was just not very good, it tastes old and has no life or character. Dont know whay I drank this wehn I was younger."
"Overall, for the style, i think it is pretty good. It's flavor is richer than many others in its style, but is not offensive. I think it is a decent beer if in a pinch."
"Better than I had remembered it, Foster's is still a pretty boring beer. Quite average, because there is nothing objectionable."
"OK. Aroma is malty, as is the taste. Neither is complex, just your typical lager smell and taste. Maybe drinking this out of an ""oil can"" instead of a bottle or on-tap aversely affected the flavor and odor. It is smooth and easy to drink, making it a good party beer. Though not terrific, it is worth a try, good for those accustomed to macrobrews."
"Taste is pretty typical too. It doesn't have the skunky taste, which is a plus, but the corn and cereal grains overpower any potential flavor. It's actually a bit smoother than most American macros, which makes the flavor somewhat decent. This means that given the choice of this, Bud, Coors, or Mich Ultra, I'd take this every time. Mouthfeel is thin and fizzy. Pretty drinkable, since it has a clean taste. Not a bad lager if there's nothing else around."
"Pours a light straw color with a healthy clean white head. Smells clean with light malts and hops. Taste is pretty much consistant with the smell with a slight buttery note. Has a light - medium mouthfeel and body, making for a good candidate to chose on those warm days."
"Well I got what I expected from this one. Drinkable, but that goes for carbonated water, too."
"I have a friend who loves Fosters, so I figured I would see what he was raving about. Poured from a 24oz. ""oil can", into a pint glass. The beer poured a pale yellow, with lots of carbonation, forming large head, that quickly faded. Thick lacing on the glass. The aroma is almost all grain, Nothing special there. The taste is very light malt sweetness, but mostly the grainy flavor associated with this type of beer. Light mouthfeel. Overall, this is barely a step up from Bud or Miller. This is just your basic mass produced lager. Nothing special, and not something I care to spend any money on in the future."
"I'm not a fan. The head is large and lasts, and even leaves some lacing (suprising I know!). Taste is weak, slightly peppery malts, and the faintest touch of citrus hops. Leaves a bad aftertaste. Drinkable, but only because it's so weak, not somthing I would choose if there were options."
"Light, nondescript, refreshing, but watery."
"drink up mates !"
"You can really drink this one though. Went great with my steaks."
"D - Not bad for the style. It has a little more hops than most of this style."
"12 oz. bottle- color of pale yellow, with a short white head - nose of sweet corn , some malt , and mildly hoppy  taste of sweet white corn , mild hops , light skunk , and fruit ???- body watery , and well carbonated  aftertaste of mild hops , and burnt malt"
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all, doesn't seem to have much of a kick, I wouldn't stick with this beer if I had another choice."
"Overall, not bad, but down the list of ""imports"" I'd pick up at the store. On the other hand, I'd push aside several domestic macros to get to this in the back of the fridge at a party."
"Notes: As a reformed macro fiend, I must admit that this is the beer that I turned to first. It has the drinkability of water with more flavor than most Am macros. All-in-all not a bad beer, but it is by no stretch of the imagination a good beer, either. This beer is fit for cookouts or raceday when it is a ""quantity rather than quality"" kind of occasion."
"Made in Canada by an Australian company, but it is still an American Macro, and not a very good one. As the Philosophy Department Dons of the Australian University would say; ""Like making love in a canoe -- f**king close to water!"""
"This beer pours a heavy golden head that laces the glass adequately. The scent is crisp, clear and a bit malty. One of my favorite drinkable beers, but the scent could use improvement. The taste is light, crisp and sweet with a slight hop after taste. Among domestics, it is defiantly worth the extra cost. Besides, among foreign beers, you get more of a flavor for less of the price then other beers."
"pours clear yellow with a five finger white head that surprised me by holding fairly well and some lacing to the finish. musty, earthy smell. taste has a little more malt and a little more hop which gives it a little more body. mouthfeel is clean and fresh. i think it would great in the summer with your cheeseburgers and hot dogs."
"Leave this one alone!"
"This brew was pretty damn bad. Of course that is in my opinion. The functional features were awful. There was no head, no retention, no lace and no smell. Since it wasn't totally water, there was a very light yellow peaking through the glass. The taste was rather rancid. I'm not sure what it was that I was tasting, but I did not like it. The mouthfeel was well, felt. Don't drink and review."
"Funny note: The can states that Foster's is the ""Official"" beer of Formula 1 Racing."
"Overall, this is a decent example of yellow fizzy beer. I couldn't stomach much of it, but I think they nailed the style well enough."
"This is a decent lager, a bit better than average. Pours pale yellowish gold with a big white head with reasonable retention. Pretty much standard smell and mouthfeel for any large produced lager, but the taste is crisp and refreshing, with a bit of malt to it. It drinks well, but isn't anything special. Good with seafood."
"Haven't got around to reviewing this average beer. Drank this one years ago and recently tried a bottle and the mini-keg can they mass-produce. The oil can, which I havent in a long while, now remember why. The taste was very average with a touch of tin. The best part was the appearence which was very average as well. The bottled version wasn't much better (sans the tin flavor)."
"That said, the remaining beer in the turkey's butt did a damn fine job. Bird was moist & tasty, and it didn't fall over. So, for that reason alone I see myself saying that a 1/2 can of Foster's every last Thursday in November could become a tradition. I highly recommend it for its Beer Can Turkey qualities, and it could be a lot worse as far as the beer you drink to make room in the can to do so. Gobble...gobble....gobble..."
"Clear, golden yellow pour with average head and unremarkable lacing. Nose is dominated by nondesscript grains--some sweetness and little else. Likewise for the taste, which is sweet and malty up front and a bit drier toward the finish. Mouthfeel is similarly OK. As for the drinkability, well, I got through 3/4 of the glass before I dumped it."
"Drink-Ability: Not bad lager but its just not one of my favorites.."
"The concensus among the Australians that I've met over the years is that none of them drink Foster's at home. It's either Victoria Bitter or Castlemaine XXXX for most that I've spoken with. Cooper's is my personal Aussie favorite, and Foster's definitely ain't Coopers. All the above categories could be summed up very easily: see also my review for Budweiser. Foster's is simply a pretty good lager beer that is appropriately categorized in with American Macros. It may be a little hoppier than Bud, but that 's pretty much the only difference that I can discern. Solid middle of the road macro lager that is best suited for repetitive consumption during yardwork, barbeques and other warmer weather activities."
"I seem to recall from my younger days (many years ago) that I thought this was a decent beer. Not any more. We were flying back from Texas, and I wanted a couple beers. This seemed like the best of some bad choices. It was a clear yellow with a small head and a fair amount of carbonation. It had an aroma of grain/corn. Taste was very vague. I'd describe it as somewhat sweet, and leave it at that. Not much either way for mouthfeel, and drinkable like water is drinkable."
"Australian for Bud."
"You would drink this in Australia if you're rebelling from the throngs of Carlton Draught/VB aficionadoes. If you're trying to experience beer, even Australian beer, please look further afield!"
"The beer cleared up a little and drank easily, but then the smokey flavor came back later. That was strange for me and I hoped this would be better on tap."
"Not sure what the Commercial Description was talking about, but apparently was not this brew. Aroma was next to nothng. Flavor was very heavy grain with some hops, which led to a dry, bitter (not in a good way) aftertaste. Coopers is Australian for beer, Fosters is Australian for #$@^%!"
"Stay in Australia Foster's, I don't want you here."
"Pours a pale golden yellow color with a nice frothy white head that leaves a ring of lace. Clean aroma with not much going on except for a bit of faint malty grain. Taste is extremely bland that features a bit of grain and a slight hop presence in the finish. Not too impressed at all with this one. Save your time, money and effort."
"Not a lot more to say really. Australia can do better."
"Well, a nice pour  lemon yellow and a frisky white head  some nice lacing in the glass too. But wow, what a horrid aroma of stinkin cooked veggies. And the quaff of raw fish doesnt do much for my afternoon. This crap is bad. BUT, Im not the one to toss it down the sink  thats alcohol abuse. Im gonna tough this out and move on  if this is what they brew down under, I feel for the BAs down there."
"Pours a thin yellow gold with a white foamy head. Nice head,but lousy color. The smell is very light with sweet malt and vegatables, pretty much typical macro. The taste is a thin watery, corn, malt flavor that's not too pleasant and it's tough to finish. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing well , what flavors there are. This is not good, and I had a tough time finishing this beer. In my youth I liked this and it's amazing how after drinking good craft beer how bad the large macros are."
"It's pretty much as I remember it prior to '83 when Carlton and United was bought by Elders, but it's smoother now. And maybe that's just my changing palate; I'm not sure where it was brewed then."
"Foster's lager was light golden in color and very clear. It started out with a decent white head but soon only a thin layer remained. It had a faint hop aroma. It tasted a little better than the average macro, but thats not saying much. Mouthfeel was light bodied and fizzy. It does go down fairly easily on hot day, but is far from my first choice."
"Overall not a bad brew. It is nothing spectacular but I would pick this up again when selection is low."
"Had an oil-can paired with some honey dijon Kettle Chips, and the chips completely overwhelmed the taste of this beer. Not a good start. Appearance is slightly better than most of the American macros, has a slight red/copper hue to it. The smell is mostly of rice and Budweiser, bleh. The taste, again, wiped out by CHIPS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, but mostly malt, little hop presence. Mouthfeel is below average, like most mass produced lagers would be. Watery, but the drinkabilty is good. Plus! It's an oil can yo! Be hip! I'll give it to them on that, cool idea with the oil can. Don't know why my buddy enjoys this so much."
"This beer looks great when you pour it. It has a clean golden color like a lot of lagers but it has a nice head on it that settles into a medium light lacing. It has a mellow fruity smell and it seems like it will taste the same. When you take a drink however it has almost no taste and a grainy after taste that makes it a little hard to swallow. It has a crisp feel that is reminiscent of its watery taste. It has no real exciting qualities to its drinking. I wouldnt mind comparing it to its real Australian counterpart. Sorry Fosters."
"Drinkable while mowing the yard or eating at Outback. Otherwise, avoid."
"Drinkability: I got through it. That's an accomplishment. Avoid this beer at all costs."
"Drinkability is very easy, goes down smooth with a bit of bitterness that hangs with you."
"My only complaint is with the carbonation, which hurts a lot more than it helps. The flavour would come through just fine if it were allowed to sit and lose it's fizzyness, provided the temperature was maintained."
"Bottom line: Refreshing beer for hot summer days when your non-BA pals don't want any ""weird"" beers, like wheats or kolsches."
"Mouthfeel is very light and watery. Slightly dry finish."
"D - barely drinkable, frankly. High carbonation and sweetness fills you up promptly. Just way too sweet."
"Drinkability: Drinks like a somewhat deeper version of Budweiser. Plenty drinkable and one of the better entries in this style I've had."
"The first thing I noticed about this beer is that it is a very even nice typical yellow. I always pictured beer to be ""this"" color, but as we know usually it is off from expectations. The initial head is nice and leaves a respectable amount throughout the drinking process. The smell is exceptionally better than most beers I have been tasting lately, slightly sweet and grainy. Then you tilt your cup back and let it hit your mouth. Hmmm... this isn't what I expected. Quite bitter, but still decent. I think this beer would be great with some BBQ or if you want something with a bit more taste than the typical macro-brews that closely resemble water. Definately worth a try. I'll probably have this in my fridge again someday, but not in the foreseeable future."
"Medium yellow with a pillowy, white, medium-sized, slowly diminishing head. Smell is of weak grainy malt and just the slightest whiff of hops. The taste is weak as well and a bit uninteresting, but fairly good for what it is. Lightly sweet, grainy bread with only really showing up on the dry finish. It has a medium-thin body, dry texture and moderate-low carbonation. Not a great beer by any means, but it would be fine with BBQ or Buffalo wings. A small step from the usual macros."
"But hey if you like, fine. There is worse."
"A medium-light body and not much flavor, I remember this stuff tasting much better in Australia on-tap. There are some Aussie beers I'd recommend, this is not one of them."
"too much hype...not enough taste...."
"Poured a thick head that quickly was cut in half. A very golden clear color. very active carbonation, looked like it was snowing upside down. Smelled slightly better than most commercial brands, the taste was so-so. Its not a very complex beer like the micro brews I usually drink, it just tasted like beer to me, nothing special."
"Overall a refreshing beer, the sweetness could be a matter of taste. I would recommend and would get it again."
"Very little head and no lace for this sickly pale everage. That being said it has a non-offensive neutral taste with an exceptable smoothness that goes down without a struggle. It doesn't have the stink of a lot macro brews either and it's not overly sweet. This is an acceptable macro brew but nothing I would go out of my way to purchase."
"This is a pretty decent brew. Not something I'd go out of my way to get, but I'll take it over Bud any day."
"D - Drinkability for a macro lager is decent. Easily washes down a steak or any other food in front of you."
"Mouthfeel was thin and fizzy. Drinkability is not good- too much corn for my tastes. But, I was on the plane, and I felt like a beer. So in this case it did the trick. Next time I'll have to try the Budweiser Select, which I heard will soon be replacing Foster's on Southwest. To be continued..."
"This is the final offering from the ""beer down under"" 6 pack. This offering poured a banana yellow with no head to speak of, just bubbles on top. The nose is clean, hoppy, with a small fruit essence. The taste is clean, crisp, clear highly malty with a soda consistancy. The finish is nice, a hop bite in the end that finishes clean and refreshing. Your typical ""macro"" lager nothing special but very drinkable."
"Da: Moderation! This is one of those brews that you could get carried away with. So I wouldnt go further than 2-3 of these without expecting a headache the next morning. Hahaha.."
"D - all of that said, there's nothing wrong with this beer, it's just boring. in other words, they go down easy!"
"It's Canadian for beer, mate! Union made in Canada by FBG Breweries. 25.4 ounce oil can (I remember when the cans really looked a lot like oil cans, not that I've seen an oil can in 10 years or more). Pours a typical macro yellow with a decent head. Smells like adjunct, tastes like adjunct. Decent lawnmower beer, not really good for much else though."
" I think that's rice in the taste, along with the watery texture and mighty carbonation. There isn't much here for the discerning beer drinker but mild enough for non beer nerds to quaff at the barbecue. I could see it being better on a hot day at the beach with a steak or a burger, but the same could be said for a lot of beers. Pass"
"NOTE: The can says it's brewed by FGB Breweries in Toronto, under the supervision of Carlton & United Breweries, Melbourne, Austrailia. Molson brews a Foster's Lager out of Ontario, but this does not appear to be it. It doesn't appear to be the real Australian beer either, so I'm not sure what is up with this brew. I guess it's a true macro. You can't tell who made it, or where (or why)."
"D - Due to the skunky factor, I can't see drinking more than two of these. However, if you are looking for something a bit lighter with more flavor, it's a definite thumbs up."
"Maybe a little better than budweiser...no just diferent. Really not a beer for people who get bored easily. Notice that's not a value judgement. Just a simple brew that doesn't pic my interest."
"Drinkability - Comparable to Bud, one of the prototypical neutral macro-beers. However, considering the price of this export, you're better off with a Sam Adams instead."
"Sweet honey and raw corn taste. A tad grassy and grainy. It's one of those major adjuct lagers and you know what to expect going in. Served better at a colder temp and has a regular drinkability level."
"drinkability - I am sure I could drink a lot of them but would get pretty bored after one 6 pack and would want to get somthing else. all in all decent session brew."
"A six pack of this was given to me by my future mother-in-law who said "" I know you like fancy beer"" (help me). In glass has a nice yellow gold color with a pure white head. Smells like rotting vegatables and tastes about the same. Couldn't get half of this stuff down my throat. Hmmm...maybe use the rest to boil shrimp in?"
"Fosters, Australian for Budweiser. This was definately a disappointing beer. I thought it would be a pleasant experience. I was expcting something like Labatt Blue turned out to be. Not spectacular or too exciting, but a decent brew that would be readily drinkable. No such luck. Fosters turns out to be sort of like Bud on steroids. Color is decent. Though pale, Fosters has some noticable tan in with the yellow. Head is high and relatively well formed, and though it will die long before you finish the beer, it will also leave a little bit of lacing. Smell is where you can tell something is wrong. There's some wierd chemical scent in there with the grains. Turns out its some combination of crappy hops and our old friend ""adjunct"" grains. The grain part of the beer really isn't that bad. It's slightly sweet, and (like the color suggests) stronger than the lightest of American Macros. But the hops suck, and there are some inferior grains in there and they combine to produce lingering chemical nastiness and astringent bitterness that ruin the beer. And there's no excuse for this. Fosters that's sold in America is actually brewed in Canada, so the taste isn't from skunking due to a trip around the world. And Molson, who can make a decent beer when they sell it under their own name, is the subcontractor, so the problem isn't that Fosters picked a bad partner. The crappiness of this beer is their own fault, and seems to be due to inferior ingredients. Fortunately ""Australian for Bud"" does not translate to ""as bad as Bud", even a megabrewer who doesn't obviously doesn't give a damn about quality won't necessarily screw up as bad as Busch usually does. So no this isn't as godawful as Budweiser, but it is still pretty damn bad. I would have to be pretty hard up for a beer to drink another one of these. And given the price I strongly reccomend you try something else, almost anything else really. Even MGD would definately be an improvement."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: One feels that this beer is ashamed to be a beer. If you're looking for a drink to washing down a hot dog go for the PABST, cold this drink feels light but warm it feels fake and one dimensional."
"I'd recommend this as a thirst quencher (Only if ICE cold) if it weren't so corny sweet. I've never tasted a beer that was quite like this and I'll pass on having this one again."
"Well, this one is more fun to drink than other macro swill just because it comes in a 25 ounce big ass can. However, this still was my 48th of 50 beers I drank for a beer club so it wasn't like I'd been rushing to drink this. It's okay, nothing to brag about, but I've had a lot worse. Corn smell and taste, not too hard to finish but I had no desire to drink another one. It does remind me of some old high school days where we used to drink this camping so it's slightly memorable."
"Overall, I don't really like this beer, and therefore am giving it a low score for drinkability. I won't be having any more of these."
"Mouthfeel is ugly. Syrupy and over-carbonated. You could easily session this brew but I can't reccomend it unless you drink it fast before it warms."
"Translucent golden orange with a fluffy ass head that is blinding in it's white glory. Head is above average, body sucks. Smells malty and sharp. Taste is crisp and light followed by a sharp metallic finish/aftertaste that comes really late."
"Bad and globalized beer; corn malts and rice is hard to hide in its smell but is good, herbal aroma; taste little bitter, grassy, round and very soft; try with bbq only; direct from the bottle or on a glass mug, pint is good too; nouthfeel and drinkability no comments; 45% recommended."
"Fosters may be Austraylian for beehr, but to this American drinker, it translates to mediocre. Pours golden clear with a moderate thick white-to-tan head that exits the scene quickly. Nose is unimpressive, mainly yeast with a hint of hops. Flavor is somewhat bitter; wheat and yeast predominate. Mouth is somewhat flat, and the beer finishes with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is average. Overall, this macro lager is not recommendedtheres plenty of others out there that are far superior."
"Not a lot of taste, but refreshing enough for a hot summer day."
"D- It is a very mild flavorless beer but the hops taste a bit off and would really benefit from a more typical hop character. It would be nice to have more of a malt note to balance the hops. I will have to put a lime in this one to enjoy the rest of this oilcan."
"D: Goes down smooth and is really it's only strong point. Not a bad beer at all...just not super good. Still I would prefer this to Bud, High Life or Coors. I enjoyed it."
"The acidic and corn or whatever malt is not my type of taste and the kind of watery texture and slight chalky finish is just not what I want in a beer. If nothing else is available, I'll drink it."
"D = Much better beers you can drink. Much better aussie beers you can drink."
"Drinkability  Its drinkable all right. Its just not that pleasant of an experience. (2.5)"
"This has to be the most pleasant macro I've reviewed to date. The hops carry the beer, but there is a supporting sweet that keeps it in balance. Plus, there's some lacing on the inside of the glass."
"Has at least a little character to make it a better choice than other macros"
"""Fosters, Canadian for beer..."""
"Like all Molson's products, The Foster's lager has a metallic aftertaste and smell, as if it had been aged in a steel drum. As well, like ALL Molson's products, fully flavoured with preservatives and accelerator's."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served chilled in a pilsner glass. It pours a gold hue with lots of streams of carbonation and a 1/2 inch white head made of tiny bubbles that linger nicely and leave decent lacing. The aroma consists of a sugary sweetness with metal and a hint of hops. It is fairly clean and flavorless, but caramel and toasty/nutty malts come through along with adjuncts, some spicy hops, and a very mild bitterness. It has a light tingly body that becomes smoother the more you drink. Not anything I'd go out of my way to find but better than A-B products anyway."
"No matter what the beer tastes like, you have to give it some points for the Big Oil Can. Poured a light yellow color with white head. Smell is sweet with little hops present. Taste is refeshing but nothing out of the ordinary. Refresing taste. Good hot summer day beer."
"A pretty good beer after that Labatt Blue that I just had. Looks vibrantly yellow. Nice carbonation and head retention. Left traces of lacing. Smells mildly malty and vegetable like and earthy. A bit yeasty. Tastes also lightly malty, corn like, grain like, powder sugar like. Light butteryness. bittered a bit by mild hopping. A bit astringent, but mostly clean. Slightly slick mouthfeel. Lightly creamy. Finishes modestly sweet, cornlike and and bitter. Not bad, unless you paid retail for it."
"Pours a rich gold with a generous frothy white head. Smells a little malty, with background hops. little to no lacing. My understanding is Australians like their beer strong, so other than a little malty kick, it tastes like a high end macro lager. The malt is all that keeps drinkability and mothfeel from being exceptionally smooth. While more expensive than a domestic light lager, worth a try if you want taste in a macro."
"Pours a white, three finger-head that vanishes quickly but leaves some lace. Clear, very pale amber color. Light carbonation and very light bodied. Nose is faintly hoppy. Starts with more malts than hops, finish is smooth but there is not a lot a flavor. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Golden yellow in color with a thick white head. The aroma is of light malt, faintly breadlike, no hops, and yeast. The flavor is clean, light and crisp. The finish is slightly sweet and yeasty, not very much body. Drinkability is what this beer is about. Overall this beer is well made for what it is, a light and refreshing pale lager."
"Pours a light shade of golden with a thick crop of egg white colored head. Retention is very good. And lace is quite full. The aroma consists of grainy notes and corny adjunct-like sweetness. Not bad, but nothing that stands out either. The flavor is a little better than the nose. Nice refreshing quality to it. It's sweet, but not overly corny or adunct-like. I'll have to admit it. A nice little maltiness to this one. Body is about medium. Maybe a little better. Carbonation isn't overly fizzy as ""macros"" can get at times. This is one of the better ""macos"" I've had in a while."
"Pours a nice golden color with creamy tight head that sticks around for a while. Smells very slightly of pride of ringwood hops, not a great start. And it only gets worse from here, it's a pretty watery beer that tastes of cheap hops and not much else. There's a lot of carbonation on the tongue, but it doesn't mask the flavor enough. I'm not sure I'd turn one down, but I definitely won't be spending any more money on it."
"Sometimes it's nice to relive the past. But sometimes it's also fortunate that it doesn't have to last too long."
"I do actually prefer this to Foster's bitter, which seems an increase all the _bad_ aspects of the lager."
"This is obviously not a ""craft"" beer, but it is hard to be objective about a micro lager. It wasn't created to win any taste contests, but rather be enjoyed in mass quantities and to be offered for cheap. At that, it definitely wins. The smell is faint and of wheat and hops. The taste is consistent and also has light hops in it. The watery finish allows the taster to have many more than a few sips."
"Overall impression: Yet another fairly generic lager - it isn't bad, but I certainly won't be seeking it out."
"On tap: tapped a pale gold with a decent cap some lace, moderate carbonation. Light malty sweet aroma. Moth feel still a tad spritzy...taste was a pleasnat surprise; biscuity with some citrus near the clean finisg...a staple lager and a way better than I remember this whan I bought the cans of it from Oz. This must be contract brewed in Canada ...one of the few things contract brewing has improived on"
"This beer is definitely better than some and worse than others. Closer to the better end of the macros. At the same price, I believe I would drink this before Miller and I would definitely drink it before Bud or Coors. Despite the ads, though, I wouldn't feel any tougher or more Australian."
"Pale yellow color. Nice head and the head retention is not bad either. Smells clean with some grassy grains. Taste slighty malty and grainy. Tight carbonation and a small hop presence. Very clean finish. Pretty much everything I would expect from a macro lager. Very drinkable with a heavy meal."
"Nice food bad selection of beer - Bud Miller Killians Bass and this swill."
"Please don't judge us Aussies on this beer. We don't drink it, we just export it. (Well, granted, most Aussies actually drink WORSE than this). Unfortunately, when this is the beer your country is known for you've got problems."
"Typical yellow colour, skimpy white foamy head. Poured out with medium carbonation and the scent of corn, rice and hops. Rather watered down flavor, with notes of bitterness and chemicals. A touch on the skunky side, but it may have just been the 6 pack I had. Nothing special here. Worth a try for those who are fans of lagers."
"Poured from a keg can into a sturdy beer mug. Huge, feathery, bright white head fires up toward the rim of the glass, nearly overflows. The body is translucent, dull gold, much like -- oh, nevermind. Smell: a ragged, dirty sweetness, and a slight twist of old lemon rind. Taste: opens with a stale cracker taste toward the back of my palate, proceeded by a very slight and shortly lived scratch of grassy bitterness over the center of my palate; a sickening push of canned corn sweetness comes next and sticks around through the finish. Sure, sure, I know you can't really taste the corn in an adjunct lager. But canned sweet corn is what this sweetness reminds me of. Mouthfeel: what do you think? Lots of carbonation, thin body. This isn't any better than the top American macro swill lagers, in my opinion."
"For the life of me, I cannot place this beer in the same category as Miller, Coors oir Budweiser. But that is all it really is. I just happen to like it better. I think the big difference is that it does not have the salty finish that gives me cotton mouth while I am still drinking it that I find the previously mentioned beers do. The color is a sickly yellow, and it came with a nice foamy head on thetap pour. It went away but would remain just enough to form an unsteady lace on the glass.The hops are not as bitter as some other Australian beers (which I found especially good when I was there a few years back), but come across as more of a citrus and sweet."
"I know that this is Australia's version of Bud.But I believe it to be a slight step up.Not a giant step, just a tiny one.Like if Dubbya was Bud and Kerry was Foster's then once again it would be anyone but Dubbya.Hey, it's a good party beer, so if you're just kickin' 'em back..this'll do."
"Don't kid yourself and think they drink this swill in Australia though. It's as Australian as Schaefer is American."
"Overall- Initially this beer showed a lot of promise, I really thought I was in for something much better than I actually got though. Overall, pretty dissapointing, it's a passable beer I guess but there are many better ones to choose from."
"With all the hype ('Foster's' is Australian for beer) I was let down. A bit different from the beer that comes in the trademark huge can, but just a bit! Almost no head or lacing by the time it got to my table  clean, almost non-existent bouquet. Golden clear in color with an initial mouth-feel that is prickly carbonation, dry, dry, piney hops underscored by a bread-yeast flavor that is not unpleasant. Light body, (okay, thin, watery beer). There is some bitterness from the hops that leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Wouldnt recommend as a session beer, but an okay lager that might be nice on a hot day."
"This beer appeared thin and clear with a slight yellow tint straight out of the can. There was almost no head at all. Granted, I have a bad sense of smell, but Foster's can only be said to have a weak aroma; or perhaps ""limp"" is a better word, especially for a beer that's supposed to be manly. It starts smooth and crisp, is medium-bodied, and has a slight woody or nutty flavor. This beer's finish is watery, flat, and calming. Its gravity seems to sit on your tongue and adds to the overall drinkability of the brew. My advice to you: avoid Foster's (rather wish I'd remebered that from the last pint of Foster's I drank)."
"Drinkability..not again for me."
"Maybe it was the fact I had low expectations for this beer, but it was okay. Came in a 24 oz. mug straight from the tap. Colour was a little darker than the average macro lager. Yellow, not gold, but a decent yellow. Not the watery piss yellow associated with most adjunct lagers. Head was about a finger thick, but that lasted only a minute. Afterwards, it was just a thin film of foam. Smelled alright. Not alot of hops, but their is a bready, malt quality in the smell that was quite surprising. Taste is the same. Very bready. Like drinking whole wheat Wonderbread. Not bad. Mouthfeel was a little thin. Drinkable as a session quaffer."
"This was the first Foster's I've had in quite a while. I used to drink quite a bit of it back in the early 80's, but have since found more robust beers. It still proved to be a reasonable macro. A light clear gold with a white head. A light malt and hop aroma. The taste is not complex, but is a good mix of malt and hops. It is light and a little oily. A good beer to drink with food or by itself. It has a bit more oomph than it's American cousins."
"Taste: Light tasting, no noticeable grains or malts jump out at you, or even appear to be hiding somewhere. Low carbonation. Has an acidic, but not bitter hop flavor which is carried through the entire drink, from first touch to aftertaste. The missing body, and presence of corn or rice, which I believe are leading to the acidicness, detract from this beer."
"Pretty good brew i think. havent had a lot of this but what i have had was good. Pretty deep taste, not gormet, but not bud light. smells ans looks normal, goes down pretty nice and does not leave a bad aftertaste.maybe somethign good does come from australia, i would try another of their beers, way before i would pick up a french beer."
"Last time at ""Top of the Park", I had a Linny's Red. I should have stuck with that."
"Taste has more character than a Budweiser, but just barely. Thin mouthfeel, but drinkable, especially on a hot day when there's nothing else lying about but domestic macrobrews. but there's little to distinguish it from US macros."
"Sorry to say, this is a drain pour. The label on the back of the bottle says that Foster's Lager is 'the definitive Australian beer'. I've had very few beers from the land down under, but that has to be the biggest load of bollocks that I've heard in a very long time."
"I guess Foster's is Austrialian for ""mediocre"". I didn't like this brew much and would probably rather save the money and buy a similair tasting American macro for less."
"well yesterday was the big memorial day bbq. after a few hours, my personal stash was depleted and since im never one to turn down a free beer, i hit up the fosters. this stuff is your basic golden yellow, leaning a little more towards golden than yellow. big super foamy white head. smells like a cheap lager, some grain. tatse? hella corn, esp. if it warms a bit. cooked corn, veggies, very light hop bite. eh. pretty crisp in the mouth, served ice cold, it was refreshing. its not a good beer, but its a beer. and i like beer."
"From the oil can pours a light golden clear liquid with a white foamy, almost fluffy head. This was more colorful than other pale lagers. The head actually stayed for a little while, but there was no lace on the glass. Smells slightly skunky and metallic, but there could be trace amounts of hops here. Taste is very sweet and grainy at first, followed by a subtly amount of hops. Thin, but true to style and highly carbonated. Overall, there are worse beers than this. It was sort of refreshing. I wouldn't buy this from a store, but that is all that is available, I would probably choke one down again."
"A fine white collar on a pale golden color. The smell is very sweet, with lots of citrus, and maybe even some ginger. The taste is malty and round, very citric and sweet. The thin hoppiness is a bit skunky. Not a complex beer, but a drinkable one. A truly average beer."
" Pours clear and light, gassy/cabadgy nose. watery, no body, typical macro lager, no malt, no hops, tasts like alot of corn. Lawn mower beer from Down under, nothing more, nothing less. skip this stuff if you can. A shameful waste of good water."
"Served cold, in a pilsner glass, from a cold bottle: mid-sized, rocky head tops a golden, clear liquid. Moderate carbonation. Aroma is a mix of corn, sulfur, faint hops, with a bit of malt underneath. The foretaste is sweeter than an everyday macro, but nothing to get excited about. Very little malt character in the mid-taste. Finish is an underdone, crisp bitterness. The bottles I had may have been a little lightstruck. This beer offers nothing extraordinary. It was an utter disappointment."
"Poured into my plastic cup with minmal head that doesn't cover the beer's surface. Yellow. Clear. Big bubbles. Zero aroma. Taste is all obscured by the freezing serving temperature and the intense carbonation. Barely a hint of grain. Thin. Gaseous. I guess you could say this is balanced, if you're balancing zero hop presence with zero malt."
"Pretty crap"
"It pours from the oil can a light transparent yellow with absolutly no head. The aroma, well, didn't exist. It was completly scent free. The taste was very watered down. There was a strong sweetness to it, but not any sign of hops to balance it out at all. I feel like I wasted my time on this."
"I had this beer on tap at, where else? An Australian-themed steakhouse. I havent had this beer in a long while and I always remember enjoying it. This was served in a nearly frosted mug, and was very cold. Light yellow color and fizzy with a small fizzy head. No real aroma to speak of since the temperature was holding it back, and theres the fact that the pungent smell from a cheeseburger at the table next to me is wafting right into my face. I did pick up a hint of slightly metallic grains. The taste is pleasantly sweet and slightly malty. Sweet tang with some fruitiness. Crisp finish and overall surprisingly smooth. An enjoyable lager that complimented my steak nicely. I always dismiss this beer for something else, but it seems to be one I routinely enjoy."
" I haven't had a Foster's in years. Tonight's experience ensures that I won't have another one in the next decade. I'm reluctant to trash a beer, but most of this was poured down my sink. Hopefully, a SNPA will clean my palate, and get rid of the aftertaste of this swill."
"It is OK drinkable if you are in need and US Macros are the only choice. There are better brews for the price like a Sam Adams."
"Pours a light yellow with a short lived white foamy head. You can smell the malts with slight hints of hops and the yeast is very funky smelling in this beer. The taste is sub-par. Tastes like a to sweet of a malt that doesn't have enough hops to round out the sweetness. Feels light and flat in the mouth and is not a drinkable beer. Go with other lagers."
"Easy to drink, not a great a beer but an ok brew to drink when the bar only offers macro beers."
"Ay, mate, it is drinkable, but then, so is water. And I don't want water when I want beer. Look, it's not truly vile, but it's so unsubstantial that everything about it just seems to fall short. And it's the lack of any real gravity that makes it drinkable. But just because I can drink more than one doesn't mean I will. If I ever make it Down Under it won't be in pursuit of beer, but I do hope there's better than this waiting for me if I want one."
"Drank the big can.Really liked it.Its a beer when your really thirsty.I thought it was a little bit heavier than a light beer, and at the end when you swaloe it taste like a dark beer for a second.Way better then mgd Coors light.More flavor.But you must drink this beer ice cold. Keep the can.As soon as this beer gets hotter, it is awfl to drink."
"Like a typical American macro, I probably could not tell it apart in a blind taste test, and I had to pay more for this? I used to like this, and probably will still buy a big oil can now and then (for the coolness factor, impresses people at BBQ's). At least the store didn't have light."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is average or slightly less than. It is of pale malts and lager yeast. It is dry and musty. It must have something to do with the can from which it came. The taste is weak and bitter. The musty flavor is bold. It is a bit grainy and simplistic. I sense the presence of brewing adjuncts. The mouthfeel is decent. Like most commercial lagers the body is low and the carbonation is high. It drinks awful. I must admit this one was had only for the beer karma."
"This beer comes a no supprise but I was still hoping for better. It poured a pale straw color with a small head that faded very quickly into a thin layer of foam. The smell was grain all the way with not much else detectable. The taste was not quite as sweet as a Coors or a Miller but was still overly sweet with just a slight hint of bite at the end. I have not had this beer in quite a while untill tonight and I think I can go the rest of my life without having another one. Thumbs down."
"Canadian for beer... Pale straw colored, white lacing. Subtle carbonation. Malt, rice and hops noticable. An off metallic twang to it. Pretty lackluster. But I've put my lips up to worse. It's mostly sweet and finishes with crisp with evidence that the brewers use less than quality hops (kind of musty, not so fresh)."
"Regular hoppy taste, with a little bit of a keggy taste too. Nothing spectacular, but if I went to a barbecue I'd much like seeing this beer in the cooler than Coar's Light!"
"Poured from a bottle. Light yellow in color with a small head that doesn't last at all. There isn't much of a smell at all. Maybe some corn with a hint of malt. The taste is equally as disappointing. Seems to be very sweet all the way through. Creamy, but not in a good way.I can't pick up any hops what so ever. I can think of many other pale lagers that I would prefer. This beer reminds me a lot of PBR on tap. I wouldn't refuse it on a hot summers day but that is about it."
"This brew pours a light golden colour with a small white head of foam. The aromas are all light zesty hops, and slight bready malts. The taste is very uncomplex, yet thirst quenching at the same time. The mouthfeel is light in the mouth, and the same as the canned version of this brew. However, For some reason I find the drinkability to be less from the bottled version. Go figure!?"
"At one time this was my wifes favorite brew. Im glad to say that she now likes IPAs, Hefes, etc. So at least it didnt turn her off beer for good!"
"I usually like just about any kind of beer out there. But this beer actually proves that the only good alleged thing to come out of Australia really does suck. Even a guy like Dan Grimaldi would not drink crap like this, and he is the kind of guy who would lick beer off of a floor. Very little head, mouthfeel is not so desirable, it kinda pissed me off that I even bought it."
"Brewed in Canada. I remember this as a beer that gave me a nasty headache the next morning. Not any more. An at least unoffensive odor. Taste is just a bit more malty than in a normal American beer. And I catch a bit of hop in the aftertaste. Had I not found much more interesting brewpub lagers, I might have rated this higher, but now I know better: there's so much more out there, and this is so much less."
"Drinkability: I was fully expecting to slam this by saying the only really good thing about this is the manly sized container, but it's not all that bad. Does what a lager ought to do, hit's the right notes and all that rot. Too bad the notes make for Britney Spears when I'm looking for Velvet Underground."
"im ashamed that we get lumped with this beer. alas, its deserved on some levels. if aussies in general knew anything about beer we wouldnt allow it. dammit that this is not the case."
"On tap Canadian version - Clear yellow brew with a nice head. usual macro brewery taste of malt/sugar/water. Maybe a tad too much water. This is drinkable but overall a middle of the road lager for hot summer days. I get the feeling this might not even be imported ber bu brewed under license in Canada."
"The beer pours the archetypal lager golden yellow, the head impressive in size, frothy in texture and a bright white color; the lace forms a nice sealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is prototypical lager crisp, fresh and clean, start is malt laden and somewhat sweet, top is middling in feel. Finish is briskly carbonated, hops apropos to the style, dry aftertaste, but it is a beer when the temperature here in Phoenix hits 110 degrees Fahrenheit or higher taste pretty good, yes better than the Unnamed Big Three!"
"Drinkability: It is obvious why most people would like this watery concoction - it has a lot in common with its macrobrewery cousins from North America and might be enjoyable enough with a barbecued hamburger or hot dog. On its own, it offers very little satisfaction, except, perhaps, as a thirst quencher on a sultry summer's day."
"Well, meet Australias answer to Americas unholy macro trinity. Fosters is a lifeless brew drank by the exceedingly desperate (me, in this case) or those who think drinking an Aussie macro makes them cool. If Fosters is Australian for beer (as the advert goes), then there are some serious problems in the land Down Under."
"Not for snobs, but excellent for what it is, this beer tops its category (light lager)."
"Drinkability  The kangaroos are probably spitting this one out. Fosters adds a smooth style to the standard piss formula, but this ale has little else to offer."
"Appearance: Fizzy golden with a nice sized frothy white head with decent scattered patches of lacing. Aroma: Grassy hop character with a mild sweet tone, not bad just clean and decently hopped for most lagers. Taste: A trickle of bitter sweetness here some corn and rice is probably present doesn't seem all grain not a bad hop profile decently bitter for a lager, too bad this is the biggest knockoff of an Australian beer considering it's brewed in Canada. Other than that it finishes clean and unoffensively, take it for what it is a mass produced lager. Mouthfeel: Is thin and artificially carbonated not cloying pretty smooth just uninteresting. Drinkability: As much as you can put down before you can't handle the flavor anymore not filling and doesn't make me yearn for another yet I can't tear it apart."
"Glad to get it out of the way, not a beer for 2 times."
"I'd still skip it next time."
"This is not the first time I have ever had this, but it was all there was today at Suzanne's house. Well banish me to beer hell, it wasn't all that bad. Pale straw color with big white head that settled in to a thin layer of foam that left pretty good lace. Aroma is pretty standard for a lager. Smooth malty taste with a decent hint of bitterness. You know for an import lager you could do a lot worse. I'm not going to seek this one out of course but I won't blow it off if it's available and I don't have many options. Drinkable in a relative sense if you know what I mean."
"Funny that the commercials promote this as Australian for beer, but it's really not one of the more popular beers in Australia. Anyway. Pours a very average yellow color with a small head that dies off quickly. The aroma is grainy, but not too interesting. The taste is a little watered down and a little grainy as well, so it's not all that enjoyable, but not bad for a macrobrew."
"Had one On-tap, where-else, an Outback Steakhouse. It arrived very cold in a frosted mug.I think that put stress on the head for it was thick, but more like thick in spots. Lace was good but not a good read from the mug. carbonation was medium. The straw color and white head matched the somewhat grassy aroma. The taste was crisp, well balance of malt and some hop bitter to round-out the mouthfeel. Not a bad brew, but rather drinkable with a burger or a heavy breaded onion. Good-enough that i'll pick some up for a home bottle taste, nor will I shy away from it out when its available."
"I didn't find this beer objectionable at all. It was a perfectly fine representative of an international macro-brewed pale lager. In other words, utterly average."
"Light gold color, large white head. Aroma is grainy and sweet. Light hops and malts. Light tasting lager. Full round Mouthfeel. Good flavor, nice balance. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is smooth and slightly bitter. That said it still a lager."
"Other than the corn taste, not much really stands out on this one. Reminds me of Budweiser in a few ways. Label both under the ""boring macro"" category."
"Not my favorite Lager, but certainly completely drinkable in its own right. This is one of those beers where, if faced with a lousy beer selection, you could probably fall back on it and be alright. Better than most macros, though it seems to have something of a funky aftertaste which prevents me from rating it more highly."
"I just got this at the Whitecaps (single A pro baseball team) game. The only reason I got this was because my other choices were standard macro swill. It actually poured really nice with a solid, clean head, better than most lagers. The smell sort of threw me off because it was sweeter than most lagers, and I didn't like it. But the taste was good enough. Nothing special just a solid amount of malts and hops were present. Not a bad beer for watching a ballgame on a hot day."
"This brew poured a creamy while head of fine bubbles. It had a standard hoppy lager beer aroma and a transparent straw orange color with carbonation. It left some lacing as the head receded. It had a slightly fizzy foretaste of hops with a very mild somewhat bitter after bite. It went down real easy. This is a very drinkable brew. Not great not bad just middle of the road."
"This brew poured a white foamy head. It left excellent lacing on the sides of my glass. It was gold color in body. It had a bitter taste to it. It also had an aftertaste that seemed to linger. This beer does not have much character to it. It reminded me of when i rated Bud. In other words, I was not very impressed with this brew."
"NOTES: My opinion of Fosters lager keeps getting worse and worse. I first tasted this beer many moons ago when i was a teenager ( 19) expierienceing my first trip to London..it was better then ( made in Aussie) ..then much later i tasted it again in America ( the canadian version) it was reasonable in the oilcan..but this in the 12 oz bottle was pretty bad stuff..whats going on?"
"Cloudy golden yellow color. Thin white head left in a hurry. Noticable smells were mostly corn and metal. Taste was along the same lines, sweet corn water, sulfer smells, and metallic tinged water. Some buttery flavors finish. Sweetness lingers. Bubbly, fizzy feel. Watery and light. Not much to impress here, and I wouldn't have more than one of these. Hey it was free....."
"This can was brewed in Canada. Straw colored and very thin malt. Malt? Hops? I can't positively identify any common beer ingredients. Bread soaked in dishwater aroma. Fizzy white head disappears rapidly, but I don't miss it. Evenly weak and sad. Follows the American mega-brewing formula for making good commercials, awful beer. Aussies must cringe at the ""Australian for Beer"" claims."
"On draught via the Outback. No head but the glass was filled to the rim. Dark gold in color. Mostly a malt presence, maybe a slight hint of hops. A semi sweet malt taste with a slight dry finish. Pretty decent mouth feel and drinkable. I didnt like the frosted mug. Made the beer too cold. A average brew."
"Foster's is the beer to go to at the gas station when all they have is macros and luckily this sitting by the Tequiza. It gets a little warm here in Phoenix every now and then, and a nice cold Fosters really hits the spot when you are out working in the yard. The beer is a standard looking beer with the typical foamy head of a lager such as this. The smell takes me a little off guard each time, almost metallic in nature, which coincides with the way it feels in my mouth. I find the flavor of the beer is nice but lacks in complexity. All in all, still a good drinkable beer."
"Of course if youre going to get a fosters, you had better get the big can. Comes out looking real yellow, pretty big head but my pour was splashing all over. Not a bad beer if youre going for a standard lager, but nothing special by any means. Couldnt taste it much, but granted i had a nice goose island right before. Give it a shot i guess, dont get your hopes up to high though."
"25.4 ounce, the oil can as it is commonly referred to, this sucker is heavy. Pours a transparent, clean yellow with some instant carbonation, and a huge white bubbly head that makes efforts to cling throughout. Initial smell was tough, maybe of corn and a bit floral, not too much to get excited about. A taste of malt and light corn, both very thin and light, finishing with somewhat of a watery, wheat taste. Clearly a step up, just one, from the macros, nothing spectacular though. Memo to Foster's - put some type of freshness date on these, it scares me when a grocery store puts these oil cans on sale for $1.25, not a good sign."
"I wish I had been able to try a Foster's from Australia. This one is from Canada. Pretty much like an American style lager. Straw in color with a medium white head. Taste is malty with decent hops, not bad going down. This is better than Bud by far."
"I liked this Australian offering brewed under license in Canada. It poured a clear yellow with a fair head that fades quickly and a nice aroma. Crisp, clean taste of grainy goodness; enough hops to balance the fairly sweet start. Reasonably full-bodied for a macro brew. There was much to like and nothing offputting about this nice, clean lager. Clearly this would be very tempting on a hot summer's day."
"This lager was the $2.50 Fire Sale at the Flying Saucer tonight. It was a clear golden with a fair head. The malt was present in the nose with a slight presence of hops. The bitterness was more noticable on the tongue than on the nose. The taste was good, good enough to have a second pint. The mouthfeel was light. It was good for $2.50 to have several rounds but was not a memorable beer."
"any time i drink a foster's, it's only because i feel like drinking a beer that comes in a big-ass can. that's about it's only appeal to me. it's basically australia's (and by australia's, i mean canada's) version of a budweiser. minimal flavour (save for that sweet, sweet taste of tin) and minimal colour. pours just like it tastes, light and boring. blah."
"Pours a clear golden color with a foamy white head that quickly dissipates into a thin lace. Nose is sweet malts and grains with a hint of honey. Taste is light and crisp. Flavors of sweet malts come through up front followed by a bready taste and then a mildly bitter hop finish. An average beer thats nice on a hot day."
"This was one average, well, actually below average beer. I thought it would be good, since most things from Australia is good, ie surfing, rugby, and women. It was really light and had no head at all, except for the carbonation. The taste was that of a skunky one. I had it once, and that was enough for me."
"I would be willing to try this drink on tap sometime to contrast the difference with the canned product. I'm not a huge fan of the style but do give it approval if you like this sort of thing."
"Aroma was crisp and clean and was a very well balanced brew. A joy to drink."
"This beer has the appearance of a brew of far less quality. That is not to say that this is a good beer. It's merely average; many people say this is a good beer simply because of its allure of being imported and slightly above average price. Pours a light head on top of its molson golden look a like body. Just looks flavorless. Has no noticable fragerances worth mentioning. Taste is clean and crisp...not many beers are meant to be drank very cold, but this is one that is. As it has no real prominent flavors to hide it serves best as a 'cooler offer' than something to relax and indulge in."
"Fairly average beer. Not very impressive but not too bad either. One of it's characteristics its that it's easy to drink and i mean really easy to drink. Not that its watery but refreshing"
"Grabbed a Foster's at the Outback Steakhouse on draft.  Served up in a 12 oz frosted mug.  Color is clear golden with a slight amber hue.  Body had small bubbles and a thin white foamy head.  Mouthfeel is very watery and the only taste comes in the mild bitterness of the finish.  Taste gets more bitter and unpleasant as it warms to room temperature.  This is an overrated import beer.  Pairs well with BBQ and spicy foods and is very refreshing when icy cold."
"Light colored, not too much hops. This is a bad beer. One oil can is all it takes to realize how bad it really is. You have to force down every sip. There must be something better from Australia."
"Pours a pale golden color that you could read something through if it wasn't reversed. Very nice frothy of  white head that slowly dissipate and leaves some lace. Head and lace are pretty good for a lager. Smell is pretty clean with some grain. Thin and watery mouthfeel. Taste is a little sweet with a touch of hops. Beer is typical of most American competing lagers. Better than the big boys, but nothing great."
"Scarce, very fine bubbles in a amber liquid. Stiff white head. Aromas of wilted veggies and grain with sugar. Nice dry toastiness to the palate which leads off with roasted grain bitterness, caramel and lemon candy. Some cleansing bitterness on the finish. Not bad at all. Won't offend anyone. Might even keep a Beer Advocate interested."
"Transparent yellow color, or lack of.  When poured displayed a nice white head that lasted almost through the whole 22oz. draft.  Has a clean malt taste followed by a bitter hop nip.  Lacks flavor of hops, but does have a desirable bitterness.  Overall a very dry, thirst quenching lager."
"It is Union made!  (In Canada... what?)"
"Very pale yellow but with a better than expected head that wasn't foamy.  Aroma is slightly grainy, a little sweet.  The malt flavor is surprisingly satisfying in sweetness, just a little bit of caramel.  The hoppy portion was fairly standard, just a balancer to the backbone flavor.  Swallow is mild (a touch of hop-crisp) but not a dissappearing act. I was a little surprised that this brew seemed better than all the ""oil cans"" from my memory.  Hardly a world beater though."
"foster's is not austrailian for beer. a few of my best friends are austrailian, and they swear by cooper's which i have yet to sample, but they all say foster's is not what you should think of when you think of Oz. it is light and it is a decent lager. it is nothing special, a little bitter, but definitely drinkable. out of the oil can, it was not so bad.  i probably won't have it again soon, but you can drink it"
"Nothing striking but drinkable.  The brew has an odd crystal yellow with a foamy head that actually stuck around for a while.  The taste is mildly sweet with a fraction of a hop present and absent malts.  A pretty light body with a slight scratch of the tongue.  Its light, sweet body and taste make it best for quenching a warm thirst.  Try it so you can say you have."
"Clear light golden hue topped by a fluffy relatively persistant head that leaves a loose lace.  Cooked corn, light graininess, generic sweetness and a metallic note in the aroma.  Hop nose is virtually absent. Husky, almost astringent grain hit the palette upfront, and are followed by flavors of corn and subtle sulfur. Typically watery mouthfeel.  Finishes a touch grainy w/ residual lingering sweetness that isn't particularly enjoyable. There's nothing to be savored here at all.  Rough yet weak all around."
"Just like my rating of this lager, average across the board.  The aroma is not bad and the taste is OK at best, but there is nothing to get excited about here.  I would rather drink a Yuengling if I had a choice.  And for me, that is really saying somethign about this beer."
"Slightly above average standard beer. I would only advise if your only other options were along the Budweiser line. That isn't really meant as a compliment either."
"Back in my college days I thought Fosters,Moosehead, and Michelob were THE smoothest, best tasting beers to be found on tap...I always kind of equated Fosters with Michelob for smoothness(I've learned about Michelob since then too)....I'm drinking this one out of the ol master cylinder and the memories outshine the actual product in my hand.  This is decent for a basic lager..clean...crisp...thirst quenching..and it does have a smoothness to it...what I also notice is a bit of a hop bite on the long finish..it is not loaded with flavor and in some regards tastes like the Canadien Beers where it is now made for U.S consumption...On a par or better than most American Lagers but I wouldn't call this a special beer by any means (like I used to)..."
"Pours a light pale yellow with a 2 finger head that dissipates rather quickly.  The taste is quite sweet with a very strange bitter aftertaste.  This is not a very well balanced beer.  The mouthfeel is quite watery and drinkability is not quite what I expected from a highly marketed beer that are usually smooth due to lack of character.  Not recommended at all."
"Medium gold color with a decent snow white head, quite carbonated, good lace.  Aroma of cooked grains with faint malt.  Tasting yields an initial slight sting of carbonation, followed by slight malt.  Finish is very dry with an odd bitterness.  Another reviewer noted that the bitterness is not like that typically associated with hops - I found this to be true as well, more of a medicinal character than hoppy.   Unless its free, I will not be trying this one again - the medicinal bitterness put me off."
"Foster’s Lager:  in the 25.4 ounce oil can, brewed in Canada. Very light looking lager, with a dense head.  Adjunct-y aroma. Awful.  The overwhelming taste is bitter, but not hops bitter, aspirin melting on your mouth bitter.  Soapy aftertaste, but not a pleasant aftertaste. . . .  I used to like this beer, not anymore"
"An Australian beer brewed in Canada and drank by me in the U.S.  Very uninspiring.  A hint of hops on the finish, but nothing exciting.  Where are the big ""oil"" cans of this stuff that I remember from years ago?  Below average at best."
"Taste is very average.  Solid, refreshing, but not challenging or complex by any means.  Fosters seems to have a bit more body in terms of mouthfeel then others of the same style."
"After being raised in a Budweiser family, Foster's was my first effort to try something different.  In my younger days, I really liked it in the old metal can before they switched to aluminum.  The fact that I liked the beer better with a bit of tin flavor should have been a clue.  It's pretty average down the line for a big-brewery lager.  It has nothing to distinguish it as exceptionally good or bad."
"I have friends that are drawn to the novelty of the big can.  The flavor of the beer however isn't any better than a domestic macrobrew that you can pick up.  Has a slight smell to it, but i don't know if I would call it skunky.  Haven't really tried it in a bottle to see if that would help it out."
"as an Aussie and a self proclaimed experienced beer drinker. The other day i had my first ever fosters. Strange that. no-one drinks the stuff over here. With that out of the way, i bought one, sat down at my seat, my usual drinking companion was having his first also. and, at the same time, we said. Water. then struggled to finish the rest of it. No taste really. Probably not going to have another for quite some time."
"I hear that this beer is considered to be swill in Austrailia. The American ""import"" version is brewed under license in Canada. With that said, I say who cares. I like this beer because it is usually easy to find in restaurants and has a smooth malty, bready flavor and aroma. Thirst quenching and reasonably priced. If I can't get a high quality micro or a Sam Adams, I'll gladly default to this brew."
"Light golden, looks like any run-of-the-mill lager. No smell to speak of. Tastes rather run-of-the-mill but doesn't have any aftertaste to speak of. Smooth and refreshing at any temperature. Perhaps it's more acceptable because it isn't American. Placebo effect."
"Gloden lager with a thick airy head.  Very smooth feel and taste for a lager.  Malty smooth finish. Tasty..."
"Very thin, but quite refreshing on a hot day like this.  Ground maize aromas.  If you've ever had Asahi, its almost identical.  Faint straw color, completely transparent.  Mild bitterness in the mix.  I'd prefer a Bud or Coors to be quite honest..."
"Notes: A pretty drinkable lager, nothing to go “beer crazy” over. A good beer to wash down a working man’s meat and potatoes meal."
"gold in color, not much adjunct smell smell to speak of. poured a big rocky head which stuck around for the entire oil can.  has a sort of smooth creamy mouthfeel but the taste was rather boring, with a rather ""crap beer "" aftertaste.   i am rather dissapointed.  not something i'd turn down if offered, but nothing to go out of your way to consume.  in fact i'd say that most american macros are more worthy of consumption than this stuff."
"despite what the world thinks, we Aussies don't drink this crap, once again i think it must be brewed by someone else in North America, coz the Aussie version tastes like chemicals."
"This one falls under the classification of ""lawnmower beer"". Had just a bit more character when it was made in Australia (now it's contract brewed in Canada)"
"uncomplicated but uninspired, but better than A-B brands"
"Mass produced, run of the mill swill."
"Growing up this one of my favorites, (probably because of the oil can) I tried it again recently and was a bit dissapointed...Taste is similar to an American  Lager...very light...nothing special"
"Bottled seems a little better than the canned version.  Contract brewed for the North American market in Canada, this beer has always struck me as being more like a less-than-average Canadian lager."
"It looks and smells like an aright lager, but one taste from its oil can container and it becomes this beergod awful beverage from down under (hell?). Sure the adverts in the US are funny, but it hardly helps to mask its hard to swallow taste. Thanks, but I'll pass on this one."
