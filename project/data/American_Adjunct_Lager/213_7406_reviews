"One of the better macro brews. Wish it was available in the south."

"Taste is very full for a cheap American lager. Can't compare to a higher quality craft, but if cash is tight Narragansett is a good choice."
"Was hoping for a whole lot more."
""
"Better than all the majors ""swill"""
""
""
"It wasn't enjoyable, lacked any real aroma or flavor."

"HOW is this so bad, when the other offerings are mostly decent?"

"when you are talking cheap american lagers, look no further than this one for one of the best in the game. no off flavors here, not the least bit sweet, and just good, easy drinking, refreshingly carbonated, yellow beer. not to be over analyzed i dont think, but when the sun is shining and seafood is on the table, this one is hard to beat if you dont want to drink down the fancy beers in the cellar or fridge. really nice head, and it holds on for a long time, especially for the style. the lager yeast is different too, less bready, more compatible with the light hops in here, and working sugars down to a very very dry finishing beverage. tasty, really no complaints for this, especially when compared to its peer group. best when ice cold, right from the can."

"To me, its the perfect beer. Crisp, delicious, flavorful, yet easy to drink. Good anytime of year and is a damn good value."

"I just like the can ""Made on honor, sold on merit."" I like Pabst a bit better for ""hammer"" beers."

"Just got my first 12 pack. Very good tasting AAL. Has smooth mouthfeel, with apple notes and good malty balance to make it a bit richer with a corn finish. A little bit of a caramel note to balance the taste. One of the best lawnmower beers or summer thirst quenchers. Easy to drink and beats the BMC alternatives hands down. Purchased in Etowah, TN at Muddy Waters Liquor and paid $10.99 for that 12 pack. Good value for the dollar."

"But, all in all I will suck a few of these down here and there with a couple Cheeseburgers with Bacon oR some kinda' Chicken or even just have a couple of 'em solo. A decent Brew for the price. Although there are others I am ALL OVA'!!!!!!!!!!!"

"Drank out of can but have had it many a time before. Light yellow not really a head. Good carbonation. Tastes like a PBR or old Milwaukee. Also one of my 3 go to choices"

"From a can at home. Nice looking beer. Thick creamy head that recedes to a sparse lacing in the a tall pilsner style glass. Active streams of bubbles accompany a staunch aroma. Very refreshing taste with a solid mouth-feel & a mild aftertaste. All in all a great beer at a great price."
"I used to drink this beer in Jr. High. I hadn't had it since then (early 70s), so when I had it recently, I was a little nervous. I was not just relieved, but overjoyed that it tasted exactly as I thought I had remembered it (even though it was the first time I think I had had it actually cold). A flood of memories came to me of hanging out with my friends, skipping school, on a beautiful spring day, drinking beers by the lake."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing special at all. I really do not like PBR so saying it is a better version is not high praise at all (despite what Nicolas Cage says). Pretty neutral beer that would be pretty good for a long drinking session. Has drinkability, but tastes pretty typical"

"Bright, golden yellow in color with perfect clarity. Poured with a thick, soapy foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Grainy corn, grass and light malt aromas with floral hop notes. Carbonation was slightly subdued up front creating a creamy feel. Light, tangy hop crispness through the middle up front with a clean semi-dry finish. Flavors are in line with the aromas. Light, crisp and refreshing. By far the best lager of its kind that I've had to date. Love the tall boy too."

"Overall: This is a severely underrated style due to it's simplicity, but Narragansett Lager is an exemplary addition to the style. This is probably my favorite AAL to date and one that will be hard to beat. At $5.49/sixer of 16oz cans, this beer is impossible to beat in terms of flavor and value. This will be a staple in my fridge during the hot summer months where a simple, easy drinking beer is all one really wants until the sun sets and the heat subsides a bit. Would highly recommend as a go-to, everyday cheap beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The best of the style so far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- As far as AALs go, this is up for the best. More flavorful, malt forward. Makes it stand out of a group of bland, watery beers."
""
""
""
""
"A standard beer by definition (although a lot of their seasonal and limited beers are great) it is still a staple in my house. This is comparable to most of the big guys (bud, coors, pbr) but I found it to be better in that is not as filling, nor do I feel as bad for buying a six pack. The appearance is a very light yellow with a strong smell of wheat. The taste is okay and it has a light feel to it without sacrificing too much flavor. So if you want to get something to appease friends who are used to drinking bud but don't want to give Anheuser-Busch your money, this is a great way to go."

"Not my normal style of beer, but is a good session beer on a hot summer day. Also a safe bet to buy for events like parties and whatnot"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours with bright clarity , golden amber with a soapy head that fell fast. Nose is corn, grits, corn sweetness and some fresh cut hay. Lightly sweet and no apple on the nose at all. Taste is light, lightly sweet and has a bit of thin apple. Thin malt with a bit of light watery body . Touch of sulfur on the nose at first but that dissipates. Smooth but has a nice bite on the tongue from carbonation. Refreshing with no real hop bitter - maybe a hint of it and some lemon in the dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This pours a clear, golden yellow color with a thick, fizzy head. The aroma is slightly malty and grainy. The taste is fairly simple and light. This is fairly decent tasting for being a lighter beer. I would definitely take this over a Miller/Bud/Coors any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very well done adjunct lager, hops and mouthfeel make it stand on its own."
"Overall for the price, it can't be beat. And its cartoon ads ""from back in the day"" are still the best."
"This is my favorite beer. I know it's not fancy, but it goes with any food occasion and drinks well. I love the history of the brand, and really hope that they can bring the brewery back to Rhode Island. The beer isn't heavy or loaded with hops, it's well balanced. When I think of beer, this is the beer I think of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: 'Gansett is what I think of when I think of classic, basic American beer. It's not a beer that makes you agonize over the ""hop profile"" and things like that. It's a beer to pair with pizza and football on TV (like I'm doing right now), or to have outside on a hot day. It's also a good lager to cook with - we've used it to make vegetable stews and beer cheese grits and it always holds up its end of the bargain. If you like U.S.A. lager, you'd be crazy not to try this, because it's also cheap (usually around $6 for six tallboys)."
""
""
""
""
"o: A good lager, a little above the mainstream. Had more malt flavor the first time I had one, this one was strangely fruity at first, although that faded. Certainly a refreshing warm weather beer or any time a thirst quencher is sought."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can score a 6-pack of 16 ounce cans for $6 I think thats a pretty good deal, for a refreshing beer. That isn't BMC"
""
"One of the best adjunct lagers on the market. Not offensive in the slightest, actually has a taste that brings you back for more."
""
""
""
""
"Anyway, its a decent beer. Something to enjoy after vigorous exercise."
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't finish this case. Tried it 4 or 5 different times and its a drain pour. Perhaps too many temperature changes before I bought it. very bad."
""
""
"Overall, this is not a great beer but it is a better than average AAL. Has more flavor than most and is easy-drinking. I would pick this up on occassion if it were available to me."
""
"This is a nostalgia beer for me. Lot of it down the pipe while stationed at Westover AFB back in the day. Whenever I travel to Mass on business I grab a Gansett since it came back in 2005. Interesting that it was out of business during my drinking hiatus. Still my favorite upeast Lager brewed in Upstate NY. Good head dissipates quickly leaving a nice lace, mouthfeel is excellent and the beer is good with any food. My preference is some good New England chowder, a burger and a Gansett."
""
""
"Poured this from a can to a pint glass at Scratch Kitchen in Salem, MA."
""
""
""
" The label says ""Hi neighbor have a Gansett"" I'd have to say have something else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A simple, refreshing, relatively clean AAL. Could easily knock a few of these back on a warm evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Definitely outstanding for the style as it is an enjoyable AAL, which only makes it an about average beer. Nevertheless, I wish I could get it more easily in my area, because it deserves periodic rotation in my fridge."

"O: Solid lager. A beer geek would expect the worse, but this isn't horribly bad. Honestly... I'd drink this again on a hot afternoon on Cape Cod."
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall there isn't a ton going on here and it is pretty average, but it is not a bad beer for an AAL. Lots of grains and bready malts, and easy to drink, I'd prefer this over most BMC products."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yep!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is actually quite a competent beer for the style. Not much on the hops, but still not offensive with the hop or malt profile."

"Overall (3.75): Pretty much fits the AAL profile, to a T, but it does so in a much more satisfying way than the standard watered-down, fizzy yellow macro. It doesn’t blow anyone away, but it does what it’s supposed to do well, and in a much more satisfying way than any macro AAL."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"As far as the traditional review categories, I'd just say that 'Gansett is really just on par with the course. It's tough for me to differentiate it from other AALs. And yet, I still opt for it from time to time because I'm a sucker for good marketing and, if they've got one thing going for them down in Providence, it's marketing."
"O-Great for hot sunny days, beaches, boat rides, or games of Mario Kart in a college dorm."
"Now THIS is an AAL that I can back my support for! Totally refreshing and flavorful, and a really nice thing to have after a long day, or, er... A long week of drinking huge beers. I would recommend pairing this with food (think BBQ, steak, tomato soup) rather than on its own, but it works well with the warming weather over here. Glad I could try it, and wish we got it out here in the West."
""
"Bready malts up front with honey sweetness. Hints of corn cereal and toasted grains. Light cidery-fruitiness mixes with spicy, peppery hop bitterness in the finish. Lingering honey cereal sweetness. Moderate body with a lively, refreshing feel. A pretty decent AAL that leans on the sweet side."
""
"Smells sweet and malty with a slightly metallic grassy hop note and a bit of apple cider. Flavor is pretty much right there also. Sweet and malty up front, sweeter than I would normally like, but does taste malty rather than just sugary like most others in the category. The metallic hoppiness comes out about midway and reigns in the sweetness a bit before the finish. Carbonation is moderate and doesn't bite too hard."
""
""
"A crystal clear gold on the pour with a large two-finger white head. Scents of sweet lemon bars, dry grains, slight hints of fresh hops. Not bad. Crisp refreshing mouth. Perfect for the style. Mild light citrus notes, mild hops, dry husk, sweet kiss on the finish. This is always an easy-drinking ale for the warm months. It's got a bit more girth and flavor than most other adjuncts, so I'll reach for this again. Nice beer."
""
"O: not actually bad, but trivially different from other macro-brewery American Adjunct Lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
"notes: I like everything about this beer. Brewed in my hometown of Rochester, a retro brand that was a long term advertising sponsor of my Boston Red Sox, the attractive old school can and is easy to drink and, good looking. All this for ninety cents a pint. Drinking this evokes memories of what I think retro lagers of old tasted like while listening to a baseball game on the radio. I think I just found a new lawnmower beer."
"One of the better American adjunct lagers on the market. Nice and clean and even when warm it doesn't bottom out and suck. Drinkable at all temperatures and that's worth a little something, especially for the style."

"I've heard about this since I started reading about beer. Especially since trying to find which economy beer is most worth buying. This beer was decent and worth the low price tag, but it didn't live up to the hype at all. I've had cheaper beer that was better. This one tastes A LOT like the cheapest beer in America, Big Flats. It bears some similarities to Asian adjunct lagers I've had as well. I would have to say this is not as good as Old Milwaukee, which is cheaper and a tiny bit less bland."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is the best American Adjust Lager I have had. Isn't offensive and actually quite easy drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Drinks pretty well, especially for its style. not bad at all for the style, tastes less cheap and sweeter than many others."
""

""
""
"Thanks to merc7186 for this one!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First and foremost I grew up in Narragansett, RI the town for which the beer is named and originally from. With that said, I am not the biggest fan of this beer. Thin and gold appearance, and easy to drink. It is good choice among Pabst Blue Ribbon and other inexpensive beers."

""
""
"If your at a bar and have 2 bucks in your pocket, you wont be dissipated by this great brew."
""
""

"Notes: This one is not to shaby a good dry finish and quite drinkable. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
""
"I rate this a 5 overall because i am rating it by its style. its not trying to be an IPA or euro lager."
""
"White head but not much too it. slightly malty smell. clean finish. very refreshinging lager but cleaner than most adjuncts. happy to drink it again. can is better than bottle for carbonation and appearance of head. this may have been a bad bottle cap as it was slightly flat. tast was fine but carbonation was very low. not much head at all"
""
""
"Honestly, you can't beat the price, $5.99 for a sixer of tall boys. This is a pretty straightforward example, slightly above average for the style."
"O - My friends in Florida think I'm goofy for taking a northeastern lager as my go to beer. It truly is one of the best AALs around, and at $6 for 6 pints, it's a good deal.There's always a sixer of this stuff in my fridge!"
""
""
"Overall though still quite solid for a mass lager style, I could have this again easily and it's a great alternative to others similar in the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall –For $1.05 for a tall boy this was a fantastic brew. It would be a great session brew so if going for a long steady night it may be a good choice."
""
"O - Pretty standard lager, I would drink it again and the price is more than right at $6/6-pack"

"(originally reviewed: 10-18-2011)"
"O: I'd say this is pretty good, probably come back to it eventually in the summer months perhaps"
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very nice mid-grade beer. It doesn’t quite have enough complexity or nuance to compete with, say, a Dogfish Head, but then it’s not intended to. Instead, it provides a clean, well-balanced, refreshing, flavorful profile that leaves the tongue wanting more, and with a 5% ABV, is nicely suited for lunch. Perfect camping or beach fare."
""
"not really an impressive beer, but easy to quaff during the summer. i wouldnt be surprised if this is just regular genny with a different label... tastes very similar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured an impressive 4"" white head which really had a pretty decent lifespan for a BMC-styled lager. The body is clear straw yellow and it exhausted all the carbonation into the head. It smells of grass and malt but more on the malt side than most BMCs. Taste matched the smell. It's a little watery but that's true to the BMC style. There's a nice little acidic zing at the end kind of like a Bud. I'll tell you what, for an American Adjunct Lager of the BMC persuasion this holds it's own against the big boys."
""
"O: Finally (well, not technically)! An AAL with flavor! Enjoyable and easy to drink, cheap, and of course readily available. Go get some"
"Now this I could drink all summer. Very smooth, with only a hint of sweetness. Very balanced. No hop bitterness, no frills at all. It doesnt try to blow you away, yet still packs some flavor. Very well done."
""
"This American (adjunct) Standard Lager sets the standard for the style. A great beer for a notoriously lousy genre, Narragansett Lager is the kind of beer you want to drown in after a good ole fashioned lawnmowing session while you kick back and wait for the coals to heat up. Very nicely priced at around a buck a tallboy, this is a beer you should always have on hand, especially if you're a New Englander!"
"O: Good for what it is. Drink it ice cold and fast and it's a decent refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: refreshing, easy to drink and certain one of the better bargain beers out there."
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and tastes a lot maltier compared to other adjunct lagers (with less noticeable presence of adjuncts). It definitely tastes a lot better compared to other beers in the style."
""
"Overall: Solid offering for a 16 oz can and affordable. Budget good and better than more mass produced breweries. Happy to enjoy these in 16 oz cans."
"Ganset is a good budget beer. The appearance is golden with little head that quickly fizzes away, Smell is yeasty with some corn/grain scent. Taste is similar, sweet malt with mild hop on the back--it does have a distinct bite. Mouthfeel is crisp, the beer is refreshing and easy to drink. Only see in in tallboy cans in my area. I wish the other ganset beers made it this far north, would like to try them."
""
"D- I think I would enjoy this more off of the tap, the appeal of this went away after 6 oz or so, but i finished the liquid with ease."
""
""
"O: This is a pretty decent American Adjunct Lager, actually one of the better ones I have had recently. I think the beer is very easy to drink and could easily be a session beer. Not overpowering, this beer is definitely better than expected. Better balance than I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Too light and just doesnt work together. Un balanced and lacks a certain punch. I know its a AAL but just needs more from a craft brewer."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Generally not my style, but I can appreciate nonetheless. This is a well executed example and a solid and refreshing beer."
""
""
""
"This is an alright beer. For the style it's balanced, unoffensive, and refreshing. If I were looking for a tailgate beer this would be a good choice."
"O- for lager in a can, one of the better choices. Extra points for local in a can. Not my favorite style, but better than the macros"
""

"Overall: Pleasantly surprised by this one and could easily pass as a regular lager. Probably my favorite ""adjunct""."
"Golden beer with a big, foamy head. Strong aroma of bread with some hints of berries and grass. Crisp, fruity flavor with bread and grain; the breadiness fades as the beer gets a little warmer. I've already reviewed this beer from a can and this is radically different. It's still a decent adjunct lager, but buy it in a can if possible."
"I would recommend this lager as a quality brew at a very affordable price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark yellow with a thin head. The aroma is of corn and bread with a hint of sweet malt. The flavor is mainly doughy with some hay thrown in. The flavor is decent for an American adjunct lager in the beginning but it gives way to a BMC flavor and watery thin mouthfeel as it warms. Narragansett Lager is acceptable. Barely recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That being said: I drink these. It's not bad and it's cheap and sessionable. I would buy 'Gansett more often for session drinking if Boston Lager, Brooklyn Lager, and Prima Pils weren't so readily available and reasonably priced in 12 packs."
""
"taste it for yourself. you can buy a lot more expensive beer but still not compare to what narragansett is brewing. i have not been let down by anything that has their name on it. the lager is good to go to anytime but their seasonal releases are their finest works. even their prices seem fairly low for a product this good. great job narragansett!!."

"Definitly better than BMC. One of the best adjunct lagers I have had- not sure if that is saying much. Really drinkable- goes down easy. Not really my style but it is very good for what it is."
"O: Not a bad lager. This would be an awesome tailgating beer, as I could drink it all day long, and so could most everybody I know. Pretty tasty stuff."
"A solid entry in the lawnmower beer category. Lively carbonation. Clean, moderately crisp malt with subdued grain notes. A touch of grassyness and a hint of Nehi grape (I may be the only one who gets this from some lagers - I find it prounounced in Moelson Canadian). A nice, classic macro feel to this beer. Not particularly flavorful, but clean and easy to drink."
"Well, this lager must have just arrived in the south. I had never heard about it until a few weeks go. This is a classic, clean, easy drinking American lager that has flavor to it! PBR, Schlitz, High Life, and now Narragansett!! These are the American Macros I never mind picking up if I am on a budget."
"overall, a very good AAL, but an AAL just the same."
"Taste is pleasant and slightly sweeter than the nose might suggest yet still subdued as one would expect for the style. Malty enough to give a certain slickness to the feel, particularly given the lack of coarseness on the palate. Medium bodied as a result, lending a bit more style and depth than you might get from the big boys. Easy drinking beer with a moderate lemony cracker finish. Not sure it can dethrone PBR as a preferred Macro, but then it offers a very different, and welcome, approach."
"A solid American Lager, with some good malt flavor, nice and easy to drink. This is a great example of the beer America is known for and that's not always a bad thing."
"Value: Don't even go there. I can get a sixer of tall boys of this stuff in FLORIDA for six bucks. It's a steal!"
"Notes: If I'm going to do an AAL, this is usually my pick. Great value at $7 for a six pack of tall boy cans. A great choice for tailgaiting and other such activities."
"Bad beer, not sure where the hype came from?, almost guaranteed from the name."
"Pretty typical stuff. Pale malts and a breeze of grassy bitter hops. Not a bad cheap BBQ beer, but not something that'll really wow you."
"Color is honey gold with plenty of big white head that doesn't last worth a lick. Nose is not completely unpleasant but does show adjunct tendencies and some basic graininess. The flavor is light and creamy compared to most from the style. Very smooth and easy to drink once you get used to the surprising creaminess. This is a great example of a unique local lager that has become an endangered species with the rise of BMC."
"For what category this beer falls into for most people, it really isn't bad. I would much prefer this to the Bud, Coors or Miller product lines. No offensive flavors, just a light lager profile."
"RJT"
"O: Nice beer, better than the BMC offerings. Can't beat the price either."
"Now to figure out my hurricane plan. I don't know if staying at the bar late is a good one."
"Not impressed, even for an adjunct"
"Good served very cold on a hot summer day but generally pretty ordinary. But I'll buy it every now and then for the nostalgia."
"Official beer of the clam. Pours a clear pale clear color. Hints of yellow. Fluffy head does not last. Scent is of sweet corn, but understated, is not offensive. Taste is grainy, slightly sweet. Does not get in it's own way of being a drinkable adjunct lager. Dors have a bit more taste than others ive had in this style Mouthfeel is neutral and leaves this a highly drinkable lager. Only problem for me, no clams."
"The beer has a substantial corny flavor so I fear if this warms too much it will get nasty. Nothing really stands out, middle of the pack for a lackluster style."
"my go-to beer if I'm not in the mood for a craft brew flavor bomb. great value too."
"D - Goes down smooth and easy sip after sip... Surprisingly quaffable... A solid adjunct lager... Not a bad beer by any stretch... A respectable alternative when better craft alternatives are not available..."
"Overall, this is a typical adjunct lager. It is better than some, but not as good as PBR, High Life, or Schlitz Gusto, or even Bud in my opinion."
"O: Not terrible, but not great - hard for an American Adjunct to really wow me. Would rather drink this than most others in the style though."
"Overall, keeping style in mind, this is one of the best if not the best. A macro that actually has some taste and character in comparison to its generic BMC counterparts."
"the CPJ"
"Clear gold with a soapy white head, not much retention or lacing. Dry malty aroma, sweet, with mild, grassy/spicy hops. Tastes pretty good -- low bitterness with balanced sweetness, grassy and spicy hops, a bit floral. Light bodied, but not overly dry, medium/low carbonation, decent texture overall. The beer is quite drinkable and refreshing. It didn't knock my socks off, but I was happy I grabbed a six-pack rather than a single."
"Overall- Crisp and clean lager with full flavor. Great beer. Now I just wish they distributed here in NOLA."
"Since the dawn of my interest in beer, I have always retained an odd fascination with finding the best of the cheap. Narragansett was actually one of the beers I bought on my 21st birthday. I didn't really like it then. But as the years have passed, I have tried other cheap beers, and I eventually decided to try this again. Now I believe that this just might be the best $5 six pack out there."
"O: I suppose it's a little better than Coors Light, but it's not like I would make a big deal about this beer."
"This is a gassy beer *burp* that can easily be thrown back to quench a summer thirst."
"And that is exactly I had I think of this beer!"
"bright golden hey colored with a huge white fizzy head on top that quickly faded leaving behind nearly nothing in its wake. Aroma of grain, light notes of corn and bready malts then proceeded to take over. Not terrible really, did not have that musky and cardboard like aroma I have come to see from a few. Crisp and clean flavor for sure, I actually found myself enjoying a touch of this one. Clean taste of grain and bready malts. Light corn aftertaste and only the slightest bit of hops coming through enough to dry off the palate and ready it for the next go round."
"OK, I will admit it - a small bit of me is very hip now. :0)"
"O- A good lager. It keeps itself pretty clean and would be a great backyard/baseball game brew."
"O - It's flavorful for a lager. I would probably try again if it was available in my home state."
"Notes: This is a standout brew for the style. Light to moderate in body, with a lot of flavor. Easily drinkable! I wish this one was more widely available. It is the ideal lawnmower beer."
"O - I like; it is a nice plain ol' beer."
"O - It doesn't get much better than this for the style. Its incredibly cheap, fairly local to me, and oh so non-offensive. The ultimate party beer, no need to do keg stands or funnels to force it down. Take your time neighbor, its damn tasty!"
"overall: it was the old school label that first drew me in. i looked closer, having moved recently to florida, and was appalled that i didn't grow up with this, being as i am a masshole for 27 years previous. call me a trendster if you will, but i cracked it open simply excited for a product of my homeland, and was pleasantly surprised with a perfect sessioner!"
"d. Very light, but not like a light beer, just easy to drink."
"It is slightly sweet as most adjunct lagers go and has a rounded finish. This is a highly drinkable beer. It has a little less zip in the carbonation like a High Life or Pabst Blue Ribbon. There is some malt notes shining through the mediocrity of adjunct flavors. Maybe I’m biased. Maybe it’s the Tom Brady special that’s on TV. Maybe it’s just a great beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a watery feel, high carbonation and a hight drinkability if you are looking to pound tasteless beer. Might be spot on for the style, but that didn't make it taste good."
"For $5.99 a six pack and a half way decent BA rating I had to grab this up for a day of outside work today.Poured into a pilsner glass a clear straw color with a pretty nice clingy white head,good clarity and head to this adj lager I gotta say.Clean aromas with a bit of iron and husk,not much in the sweet department wich is a good thin in my mind.What makes this adj lager better than most is the restrained sweetness on the palate,a little grainy and husky with light residual sweetness in the back end.This is a frisby golf,lawn day,or sitting back watchin a ballgame beer,its not all that bad at all."
"Light and slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this one of my go-to cheap beers and my favorite for the style because it actually taste good and is quite refreshing."
"Clear and golden yellow. Very bubbly. A faint head with a light ring of lace. Smells very typical for this style. Light malt and rice straw and grassy. A pungent tang. Taste is extremely light and carbonated. Crisp grassy malt, slightly biscuit a faint hint of caramel malts with almost no hop characteristics. Light and dry finish.Crisp and refreshing a bunch go down well while checking out some music. A reliable cheap night beer."
"Nothing overly excited me about this beer. It's a pretty standard lager to say the least. It's got the Pale yellow color that we're all very familiar with. A white head thats not very thick and dissapears after a sip or two. The best part of this beer is the old fasion look that the can has."
"I don't give a Schlitz for Narragansett Lager. Long live Schlitz!"
"I really like this beer. Got it at Trader Joe's in Hartsdale, NY -- the only place I've seen it around my area. Great American beer taste, dry not sweet...the 16oz can is the perfect size, and at $1 per can, easy on the wallet. Makes you really pine for the days when there must have been many local breweries that made great beer before the multinationals engulfed and devoured everything worthwhile."
"The Original Beer Of The Boston Red Sox"
"It pours a pale yellow with a thick head taste is not bad for the style overall not a bad brew and probably a great a choice over the others of this style like BMC could defintaly see serving this to my non craft loving friends."
"Pale straw color, whispy white head, minimal lacing. Corny, biscuity aroma, light malt sweetness, and nothing else. Taste is similar; crisp, some sort of malts, biscuit, and corn. Crisp, light, sharp feel. Drinkability is ok, easy, but not inviting. In a sea of minnows...this is still pretty much a minnow."
"D - pretty solid beer here from Narragansett. One of the better examples I have had this style. Thanks to ApolloKim for the chance to try this one!"
"Straw colored with a nice white head that slowly fades leaving behind sticky lacing. Hmmm an adjunct lager with an aroma. Nice. Smells kind of grainy with a bit of grassy hops. Taste like cheerios with a bit of grassy hops. Nice mouthfill. It's fuller than most BMC and more creamy. Carbonation is spot on. If this were readily available I'd pick it up from time to time. Good beer for summer and certainly better than Bud, Coors, Miller."
"This version of Narragansett is worth drinking, 10 years ago not so much. Pours well from can, light amber with a decent head. Very consistent from purchase to purchase. All flavors good. This is one of the best America Adjunct's available. Better than Bud as a value and a beer."
"Overall: Very good adjunct lager overall. I actually prefer it out of the can. I'll be buying many more of these when I decide to go cheap."
"Palatable, smooth adjunct with a nice price."
"16oz Tall Boy. Pours a translucent straw color with a thin, frothy head. Some lacing. Aromas of cut grass, grains, and slight hops. Taste is crisp and light. Mostly flavor of grain but a bit of hops. Creamy mouthfeel. Good amount of flavor paired with a nice, smooth drinkability. At $5 for a 6 pack of Tall Boys this is one of the best bang for your buck beers out there. Probably the best Adjunct Lager I've had."
"Taste is fairly well balanced for an adjunct lager, it's crisp, light a bit bitter and fairly fresh. I mean it's not an amazing beer, but it's well balanced and way more drinkable than most."
"D - Session beer for sure. This would make a great summer beer. Toss out the Bud/Coors and get this instead."
"Poured gently, with an unexpectedly high head of 2-fingers, reduces to thin film with better-average-lacing, color is clear straw yellow. Aroma is crisp, with a touch of corn, and none of that adjunct skunkiness. Taste is smooth, no skunk or bad bitterness, has corn on the tongue as well. This is considerably good for an adjunct lager. I really enjoy this....would be a great addition to finger food."
"D: A decent brew at a decent price: $4.99 for a 6-pack of tall boys. It's not going to wow you, but it has some character. For what it's worth, I would take PBR over this any day."
"Yeah! Thanks go out to Knifestyles for this can as repayment for the Grain Belt Premo I sent him. Little did he know that this is valuable tick for me since I've never had a beer from Rhode Island. Color is, well, yellow! Tall white head that recedes fairly quickly with few bubbles coming up from the pint glass. Aroma is very grainy with a hint of breadiness, and little corn that I've come to expect from this style. Hobs are in there somewhere which a touch of herbal qualities and earthiness to the aroma. Much like the smell, very grainy, very dry, with some decent biscuit-like maltiness bringing up the finish. Bitterness is low but the hops do add a bit of grassy flavors to the brew. Taste is not light by any means, but it's very smooth and easy to drink, with lower carbonation. Fuck yeah, lawnmower beer. I'd drink thehell out of this stuff if I could get it regularly. It's still no Grain Belt (haha, nothing is!), but it's excellent for the style. Thanks for the tick, Chris!"
"The body is light but has more depth than a Budweiser. The carbonation is active and light on the tongue. Overall a great value at $6/ sixpack of tallboys and it is better than any macro that I can think of."
"Perfect golden pour with a fizzy white head, classic American lager here. Aroma is corn and honey but not the overripe cabbage that some lesser brews have. This is beery beer. Taste is smooth, carbonated and crisp. Perfectly drinkable brew, nice grains and honey with some hop flavor flashes. Taste finishes dry but fresh. But this is a no frills brew, perfect for any time. Reminds me of a much better Labatt Blue. Glad I got to try this brew. A true American original. This should be the widely available brew here, not Bud."
"D- refreshing beer I would definitely pick this beer over any other american adjunct beer i have tried"
"At the end of the day this is just the PBR of the North East. But stick with PBR."
"Lighter medium body, medium carbonation. Drinks as well as any other adjunct. Move along."
"The drinkability of this beer rests mainly in its accessibility. There's just not enough character to keep you wanting to come back for more, but given limited options there's not really anything to keep you away."
"This is a very easy to drink American lager. Fairly well balanced, not too bitter and it doesn't have those weird flavors some of the big companies have in their products. This beer seems more natural than the better known brands. I wish it had a better aroma and some more bitterness. This just might be my new 'go to' beer when I'm at a bar with a poor craft beer selection or it's a hot summer day."
"As a Rhode Islander I felt obligated to try this one, I was not disappointed. Has a slight sweet malty taste and mild aroma. It has more of an amber color than most pale lagers I've tried. The head quickly disappears. Though it doesn't look very carbonated you feel it on you tongue. Highly drinkable. Has more taste than Miller High Life(my favorite pale lager, well used to be). I could get used to this one. For an inexpensive six pack on a Sunday afternoon this would do the trick."
"Poured into a standard pint with a crystal clear golden color and a huge pillowy head with lots of retention and good lacing. Smells like loads of sweet bread and a decent musty scent. Taste is really grainy, cereal-like, with a lot of sugar flavor and a nutty aftertaste. No hops to speak of and all flavors clear out pretty quickly. Highly carbonated and very light in body, too light for a lager I would say but considering the competition, not bad. I like having this around as a cheap option that has decent flavor. Worlds better than other cheap beers I've had and equally priced but in a larger format can. Great to have around for hot days or when I want a beer but don't want anything I have to really think about or worry about savoring."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow straw color with cap of soapy white head, minimal retention and lacing. Scent is of light grass, hay and grain with a faint touch of sweetness. Taste follows scent, uber clean taste of fresh hay and grain with a minimal lightly sweet impact from the malt - must note there are no ""vegetable"" tastes associated with adjunct lagers. Extremely light body with moderately high carbonation. Extremely clean and clear scent and taste with no off notes makes for a surprisingly drinkable adjunct lager."
"This thing is just one of the worst beers I've had. Honestly. It's light with absolutely no head. There is almost no smell on this one and what is there is pretty light. The taste? Where is it anyways? And I can literally only drink one of these before I need something more complex. I've tried drinking a second, and I had to stop."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, sweet malt and a good clean lager smell. In the taste, clean saaz hops, and a sweet to dry malt. A small bite and a light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry, hop in the aftertaste. Nice clean lager, nothing uber fantastic, but nice nonetheless."
"So...a tall can of lager? At least it is made with honor. I am always wary of that aluminum slag taste but if it not in a bottle to begin with then I may never know the difference. There are other perfectly good canned only beers out there like Oskar Blues but enough of my tangent, on with the review! Pours a bright gold like a heavenly halo. Smells of sweet grains and some mild musty hops. Tastes surprisingly complex with a creamy texture well balanced cereal grains with a crisp finish. Good job Rhode Island now where is my Pawtucket Patriot?"
"It's also pretty cheap, which is always good."
"Poured into a pint glass. Bought a sixer the other day thinking it would be great around the campfire to share with friends. And at $5.50 for a the lot, I say this is going to be a go to decent purchase for company that I don't want to share my nice beer with. Anyhow, as I said before, poured into a pint glass. This has a big white head that sits on top of a clear light bodied yellow beer. Visible carbonation and sticky lacing. Smells typical to the style, cereal, a slight amount of hops and that undeniable smell of beer my dad used to drink. Nostalgic if nothing else. The taste isn't anything to shake a stick at either. Pale malts and a slightly bitter finish make this exactly what I would want from this guy. The mouthfeel has a nice lively carbonated and light body. As for my opinion with most adjunct lagers, they are the epitome of drinkable. This will certainly be around for company and myself."
"On a side note, I was in Block Island, RI last weekend (off the coast of Narragansett), and in the grocery store there was a sign for Narragansett Lager and advertised on the sign was a note saying that this beer was rated an ""A" by the Alstrom brothers. Granted their actual rating is not far off from that, I found that kind of funny."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a basic pilsner malt scent along with a low hop aroma a dry lager yeast character. The taste is average. It has a light, pilsner malt flavor that goes dow easy and finishes smooth and clean. It's not overly flavorful and it's low in malt character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is an average adjunct lager. I like it better than Bud, Coors, Miller, but it's not much better."
"It is what it is: an American Macro Lager--but for what it is, it's not too shabby and sits on top compared to the rest of the retro Lagers out there. Without a doubt, a staple on a hot summer day. Pair with a plate of fried calamari & hot peppers--Rhode Island style."
"This has got to be my favorite beer to go for when its a hot day at the beach, out for a sail, or if I'm looking for a light but great tasting brew to down after a long day at work. Pours a perfect yellow with a crisp white head. Super clean aromas of grain, mild hops, and a touch of alcohol. Very smooth and creamy flavor hitting all the right notes. Nothing out of place here. It's exactly what it set out to be and I could drink a ton of these. Great in the tall boy cans too! It's a shame this isnt available on the Island but I usually stock up on a case or two whenever I'm in Rhody."
"Gansett is a great canned beer. Served around Boston at concerts it is near and dear to my heart. It has all the classic lager attributes and does them well. It's nicely carbonated and laces in a foamy splendor when poured. With a clear, golden color, this brew goes down smooth, crisp and with refreshing ease."
"Good for what it is, cheap and chuggable. I like that it doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is, and in that sense, in my book, it rates up there with Genny Cream Ale and Yuengling Lager (""up there"" should be interpreted in the proper context)."
"Pours a deep gold, clean straw color with a white head with good retention. Clean smells of pale malts and grains. Tastes of sweet corn and pale malts, with limited hop presence. Mouthfeel is good and crisp, that is well balanced. A great unoffensive adjunct style that is easy to drink without being watery and skunky."
"D- Macro? Wow! Taste like this out of a macro! Coupled with the price of a macro, not a bad deal!"
"A great step up from BMC. Good taste at a good price. Flavor doesn't blow your mind because it isn't supposed to. Its just supposed to be drinkable without absolutely negating the flavor aspect."
"Overall, a nice macro beer with that is both flavorful and crisp. Nothing too special, just a really solid example of the style that avoids the watery and offputting notes so many macros have."
"Has a nice bitterness to it. Good crisp lager flavors. Noting zero metalic flavor from can. It reminds me a lot of Pabst or Yuengling. Nothing crazy awesome, but also nothing incredibly offputting. A decent, very inexpencive, and drinkable lager."
"taste like nothing really in particular...or a collection of things--hops, malt are all muddy. hop water, really (i should give the bitterness some credit...er, the presence of hops). some shapeless sweetness. sour, grainy finish"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some grains. Taste is also of malts with a touch of hops and a hint of grains. feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew."
"ok so i was at a birthday party for my friend. it was at a cool bar that has a tom of micro brews and some of one of the guys that works theres homebrew. it's a cool bar. ANYWAY i noticed this beer and i asked what it was like and the dude goes ""that's the beer from the movie JAWS"" i immediately i was like ""lemme try one."" pours a nice straw yellow with a thin but foamy laced head. i was surprised because i was expecting it to look like a run of the mill macro beer. not overly bubbly like most macro beers. smell is crisp and clean. i get some faint toasted bread like malt smell. grassy. some hops on the nose not much. kind of smells like a german pils. taste reminds me of a pils. its very clean tasting. you get some of the toast like malt and a tiny hop bitter on the finish. i gotta tell ya this is a great session beer. i remembered it and got a 6 pack tonight! i'm on beer number 2 and these are very nice. i got a 6 pack of bottles for 5.99 CHEAP. i'll be getting this beer again"
"12oz. can served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a pale, golden-yellow with a translucent clarity and a one inch, frothy bright white head that eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch skim. Some spots and strands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals cereal grains and a light, citrus character. Taste consistent with nose, but a little more lemony towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light, with a lively carbonation that gently tickles the tongue and finishes with a slight astringency and some stimulation of the salivary glands along the cheeks. For what it is, this is a fantastic lager. An easy drinking, flavorful lawnmower beer that is great while barbequing."
"Poured a highly carbonated straw yellow, with two fingers of bright white, average retention, and good lacing. Smelled grassy and modest biscuit, but also sweet and soapy. The taste was better, with a more prounounced herbal note complemented by malt, but still accompanied by an annoying sweetness, even in the semi-dry finish. Nicely textured, with high carbonation fitting well with the thin- to medium-body. Definitely a decent session beer, if you can take the sweetness."
"Taste has some dryness, body is oily and goes down easy. Very drinkable, but the aftertaste leaves a stale popcorn flavor."
"I love the new Gansett and totally support what they are trying to do by building a brewery in Rhode Island again. I have been drinking ""craft beers"" for years, but this brew has become my ""standard"". This beer is made to be drunk straight from the bottle. If you pour it into a glass, you will be missing a lot. Although, if you find it on tap on a hot summer day, go for it! The naysayers will have their say, but this beer has its place in my fridge!"
"Taste is alright. There is a slight sweetness that seems to stand out to me. A bit of malt flavor, mostly fillers though. Some mild corn flavor and maybe rice, not sure. There are some grassy flavors and an interesting aftertaste, but not a bad one. A little bit of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is fine, drinkability is good. This is an OK beer, not something I would have all the time, but its refreshing on a hot 90 degree day like today."
"d- good drinkability here, i would drink this again, it's very refreshing and goes down very easily - one of the better adjuncts that i've tried."
"Having a huge amount of history, I plan on helping to save this beer."
"D: It's an ok beer. I would probably choose this over most BMC."
"D - Pretty good drinkability, mostly due to the light taste. The syrupy mouthfeel really bothers me though."
"As another reviewer mentioned, I wish I found this when I was in college - cheap and quite good!"
"Another American/world adjunct lager, although this one has a little more of the good stuff. Poured with a large foamy frothy thick white head and some lace. Color is a clear gold. Aroma is grain malt cereal bit of hop. Flavor is like aroma and has a pronounced bittersweetness. Body is ok and so is carbonation. Finish is like body and of medium length. Not bad if you're into this kind of thing, which I'm not; although, I guess I could do worse."
" I paid $7.99 for 12 cans!"
"Overall, if you are looking for an easy drinking crisp lager you could do worse than a Narragansett."
"This beer is great for the price. Its normally about six bucks a six pack. Its very drinkable and its been around forever. This beer is the perfect college beer but its definitely not well known. This beer is very smooth and goes well with most food. Most liquor stores in New England carry it."
"Drinkability - This is an interesting adjunct lager. I have difficulty drinking most of them but I am finding this one quite easy to drink as I enjoy this sunny day. Nothing great about it, but nothing that makes me not want another. A bland American lager that definitely has a little something extra when compared to the rest. I wish I had found this earlier in my college years."
"D - very easy to drink"
"New England adjunct lager that seems to have a bit of a following around here. From the back of the can - ""If you're not drinking Narragansett, you're not from New England."" I can't remember the last time I poured this style into a glass, sometimes you forget what these things look like. That being said this thing doesn't look too bad. The expected very pale yellow/slight orange, sizable foamy white head fizzles down and turns into a ring, strands of the cap manage to stay alive. The smell isn't bad either. A faint light fruit smell (lemon/orange) and even a little bit of hop aroma cover up most of the macro corn scent. The taste is pretty good for the style. Alot more actual flavors are detectable. Definitely a slight fruit taste, kinda reminds me of Blue Moon, but it is more subtle. More expected adjuncts like cereal/grain are about even with the fruit. Hop presence is small, but there. Mouthfeel is thin and over-carbonated, usual for the style but not overly offensive. Finish is also pretty blech, also usual. Drinkability is pretty great, the price is excellent, cheaper than most macros even (6-pack of 16 oz cans for $5!). More flavor and more enjoyable than usual for the style. And if you're gonna drink this style, might as well go with something local."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pale golden yellow color with a loud fizzy white head that quickly disappears. The aroma is sweet grainy malt and just a hint of faint hops. The taste is pretty much your typical American Macro Lager taste, maybe a tad more flavor than BMC, but not much. The mouthfeel is thin and fizzy from the carbonation. The drinkability is this beers best feature, I could easily throw back a couple of these in a night, but most of the time I would want to drink something with a little more flavor. Overall, this is not a terrible beer, just not my favorite style."
"From the CAN: ""Hi, Neighbor! Since 1890, we've been brewing our award-winning classic lager to the original recipe that our founders perfected. It's no surprise that 'Gansett has been the beer of choice around here for more than a century. If you're not drinking Narragansett, you're not from New England."""
"D: Nope."
"For the price it cant be beat. Great beer to just have in the fridge."
"This is a VERY drinkable beer and the old name of ""nastygansett"" does NOT apply to this. This is a very solid beer, with a nice taste and tone. A great session beer."
"Great value and decent for what you need in the adjunct lager department. Gotta love the throwback beers trying to keep alive in the corporate marketplace too."
"D - The best American Adjunct Lager (period). Drinkability is through the roof (take that Budweiser). I think the key is that it is not sickeningly sweet like and still has some flavor, unlike most other adjuncts."
"That said, I hope these guys do well and wish them luck as they raise funds to build a new brewery in Rhode Island."
"In all honesty, it's not my favorite brew, but when I can get kingers at 5 bucks for a 6, it a deal because it tastes better than most of the cheaper macros. Yea, so I indulge quite a bit, especially at the local pubs. ~ PROST!"
"Overall I was really surprised by Narragansett Lager, by far better then any BMC Lager, and is priced really reasonable for the product. In the future I hope to try other beers from this brewery."
"The beer itself is thin and a little watery. It goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste. The actual flavor is a little muted, some malt, no bitterness at all. This is about what I expected except there is not a cereal acrid taste at the back or in the after. Overall its a pretty good but boring beer."
"D- This is what Miller Lite or Bud should taste like in my opinion. Not offensive at all. I would let my non-craft friends try this one out. Nice enjoyable adjunct lager."
"Drinkability. This is one you can drink on a regular basis and it won't break the bank."
"Typical macro-lager flavor. Thin bodied with a high carbonation. Grainy flavor that dies quickly after the swallow. A session beer to be sure, perhaps better than most macros."
"Drinkability: Very. Narragansett combines the uber-drinkability of a macro-lager with, dare I say, taste! how novel!"
"Overall, an easy drinking beer that I was hoping would be a new house beer. It fell a bit short but maybe my hopes were too high?"
"The real pleasure is the very low cost which makes the brew a real value."
"This beer pours a clear copped color with a one finger of white head. Head recedes rapidly and not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of grains, corn, a touch of grass. Taste is of adjuncts, corn and grains up front, malts balance out the middle, with a slightly sweet aftertaste to it. Lighter side of medium body, medium carbonation, relatively crisp, goes down easily and is a nice alternative to the major Adjunct lagers."
"D - Pretty drinkable for what it is. There is more malt in the nose and more hops in the flavor that one might expect for this style. With its slight echos of hop and malt, his comes across more like a Euro light lager than an American adjunct beer. If you want a cheap, mediocre beer, this one is better than average."
"drinkability: only good for long hot days, boring favor"
"Cheers!!!"
"Cheers!"
" The beer is quite drinkable and cheep in the wallet. I say it's the perfect party beer where one is looking to drink mass quantities"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The mouthfeel of the beer is"
"I would reccomend this over any other cheap beer if you can find it."
"Drinkability? Great. Just like the bottle. Narragansett is in my top 2 list for American Adjunct Lagers, the other being the Schlitz 60s Gusto. Both are damn good tasting and emminently drinkable but both are beers I have to trade for. Well worth the effort, though."
"Pours a clear light gold with dense fluffy white head, but little retention and spotty lacing. Smell: fairly clean, cereal grains, a touch of semisweet breadiness and grassy hop. Taste: sweetish pale malt, corn, touch of spicy hops. Fairly crisp but with a sticky, slimy finish. For the style and at a very ""sub premium"" price point ($4/6x16oz!), this is worth a try, but I wouldn't keep it around."
"Drinkability: highly recommended low-end session beer. Right up there with Miller High Life and PBR only much more flavorful."
"I had my first Narragansett over the weekend after a long day in the sun on the beach in Narragansett with my most favorite person (and fellow BeerAdvocate contributor- HI!). We ended up at a seedy little bar on the water that smelled like the fish that the nearby fishing boats brought in. Kind of hard to get a good smell on the beer because of that. It was served ice-cold in a can. With no glass. Ok so I can't really tell the color or lacing either. Sorry all. I cracked open the can with much trepidation expecting something somehow worse than the typical American lager mainstays. I was pleasantly surprised. It was quite carbonated but rather light and crisp. Rather grainy and a slight bitter finish- not unpleasant yet rather refreshing. As for drinkability, I would say that I could drink several of these in a session (several meaning like 3 or 4- I am a chick after all), and found it very drinkable after a hot day in the sun. Is this my new favorite beer? No, but if faced with a choice I would gladly choose this over your typical macro-brew American lagers."
"From the 16 fl. oz. can #1489-1635. Sampled on July 18, 2009. So much of this makes you think of a typical American Adjunct Lager but it ends up being a bit better than the national brands. The pour is a pale yellow with a lively, carbonated white head with excellent clarity. The aroma is of corn, grass, malts, and light hops in the background. Pretty average mouthfeel with a little stablilty in the mouth. The taste is of malts, grains, and a little background of hops. But in some ways it is also very creamy like a cream ale. I would much rather have this American classic over the national brands."
"O/D: For an adjunct lager, you cannot beat this beer. It's not heavy, not light, just right for the type. Can be enjoyed year-round, will always hit the spot."
"A great beer pong beer."
"Very drinkable. This is a perfect beer for summer, and a good starter beer for BMC lovers."
"Drinkability: Even for the style, this one was far from my favorite. The flavorjust did not seem as clean as other adjunct lagers and left a bad aftertaste. I will be passing on this one in the future."
"D - I'm glad I tried this classic american lager. It was better than I expected."
"I really hope that I got a bad bottle of this stuff, but I don't think I'll buy another one to check. This is just kind of a lousy beer."
"Very crisp and refreshing, I've had a few of these over the last couple days as its been quite warm. I really don't mind this beer and that surprises me quite a bit. Very, very drinkable on a hot day. Sign the petition to get them their own brewery since they are claiming to be New England's beer and all their beers are being contract brewed in New York state...."
"From the can. A dark gold appearance with little lacing. Head was prominent at first, but evaporated quickly. Aromas are subtle in grains and sugars. Slight biscuity smell, but nicely sweetened with spice. The taste was the most enjoyable aspect: nothing too strong or weak. Pretty sweet with a dull bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was something, at least to me, I seldom sense: it was too crisp. Way to carbonated, made it slightly watered down and too easy to just drink it down fast. Overall, a New England favorite indeed."
"D: This is a better-than-average macro lager. One of the the better ones I've tried. It's light and refreshing, and has nice flavor. Hanging out at the beach in Rhode Island, trying to ease the pain of a raging sun burn, a few 'Gansetts hit the spot."
"The beer poured a light golden brown with a thin white head. The aroma is of sweet malt, with the lightest hint of hops. A nice biscuity malt with a little hop in the finish for taste. The feel is light and dry. I grabbed a sixer on a recent trip to Connecticut. I always like to try regional breweries offerings. I was very pleasantly surprised with a very drinkable session beer. No big surprises just a solid beer that would be a pleasure to drink anytime."
"A very good pale lager, it's 'beer-y', but in a good way."
"A very disappointing beer."
"For the style, this one is top of the range, along with Yuengling. I wish this was available in the D.C. area. Perfect for the BBQ on a warm spring day at my sister's in Boston."
"D- This does not weigh you down, even though the mouthfeel is much fuller than most macros it doesn't give you that heavy feeling like after drinking a bunch of guiness, this is the beer, if any, that you can drink a six pack of and not feel to bad the next day, so yes very drinkable, the best American lager I have ever laid my lips on"
"Was given a free can while watching the hockey game last night at the Sports Depot, Allston. Right out of the can is the way I went. Smelled like a typical macro, a bit sweet, slight corn scent to it. Taste was pretty run of the mill, but I've had worse. Could actually taste some malt. That was a surprise. Hops were hidden way down deep. Fizzy on the palate, but easy to drink. Not something I'd order in a bar, but it would be a good BBQ beer or campfire beer."
"Drinkability~ This is my session beer. I've had hundreds of these things, and I love em all. It's the best american lager that I've had, and being local, I'm loyal to it. Trust me beer lovers, it's worth at least a try for anyone anywhere."
"This beer is pretty drinkable, and really damn cheap. It's the cheapest beer at a non beer-bar that I frequent and I will be drinking a lot of it in the future I would guess."
"D: It's a macro, so basically you can drink this thing all day and all night."
"Light and refreshing mouth feel. Certainly a nice session beer and one that would work after mowing the lawn."
"I couldn't be more surprised at the excellence of Narragansett Lager. Those of you who have access should consider yourselves fortunate. This just might be the quintessential American pale lager. I've certainly never had one that could hold a candle to it."
"light golden in color with a one or two finger white head depending on the pour that quickly faded to beer. smells of cooked corn and vegetables. taste same. mouthfeel is light to medium and carbonaton is good. i'll take a pass on this one. not something i would buy again."
"If boring."
"Drinkability- Wonderful, as macros go this one is boss if its around."
"Howdy, neighbor."
"Pours a clear golden with a tight white bubbly, long lasting head. Plenty of carbonation is visible in the body of this lager. Aroma has a grainy malt sweetness to it with just a hint of fresh banana. Mouthfeel is light in body with an effervescent carbonation. Grainy sweetness dominates the flavor profile, with an emphasis on the malts and hops. Overall, though the hops are light. As the beer warms the grainy sweetness becomes even more pronounced. Very drinkable, refreshing, and clean lager."
"D - Perfect BBQ beer and hands down better than Bud, Miller, and the other titans of beer."
"A great beer in the style. Definite winner with picnic fare. A great treat in a sea of poor offerings for the style. A local gem if there ever was one."
"I love this stuff! It is hard to come by in NH, however. Only two stores in the state carry it, both in Manchester."
"Even and creamy mouthfeel, moderately carbonated. Very drinkable, great summer beer."
"Pours with nice clarity a straw yellow with a slightly off-white head that collapses to a paper thin cap,zero lace.The nose is sweet with pear and some robust grains.Sweetness right off the bat with some grassy notes and golden delicious apple,the core is lightly grainy(club crackers),just a slight touch of nuttiness,and a bit of a yeasty aftertaste.Light body and moderate carbonation helps this along to a very tolerable beer for extended drinking sessions.Twistoffs suck,but this stuff is enjoyable."
"Gansett is golden, similar to your average macro. Smell is equally adequate. Taste is where Gansett separates itself from other macros. It's simple, but has enough taste to keep you coming back. A great session beer and one of the very best macros around."
"This is my go to macro after a round of golf. Refreshing and a very good representation of the style."
"I'll have these in my fridge and my friends who drink Bud will have to drink these now when the come over."
"we cant say much more than we love it, and we generally spend the money from our shows equally on Pabst, High Life, or Gansett. This is solid, cheap 'Drankin beer, for slappin your knee and jumpin round the campfire with a fiddle and a couple bongos for an impromtu jam session. its also got that ""local brewed"" pride thing going for it."
"This is actually a great tasting American Macro Lager. Extremely drinkable with just the right amount of flavor to make it palatable, but also light enough to make a nice session of. Amazing value as well..."
"This is a nostalgic brand. Being that I am not a native of New England I can say it's no better or no worse than a lot of industrial lagers but doesn't particularly appeal to me."
"Drinkability is very nice. Could drink these all day long, even though it has good taste to it."
"Hands down one of the best value beers in New England (don't think you can get this one anywhere else, but I could be wrong). 6 bucks for a sixer of pounders is a good deal. Definitely better than the big three, and also beats PBR and Schlitz, IMO. Has a nice flavor, less sweet than other macros, but without that offensive, musty, strawy or corny taste. I really like this beer, and I wish it were available outside of NE. Coming from the mid atlantic, I like to think of this as the Yuengling of the north, though slightly lighter (different styles). Again, a great value, and worth trying."
"Heard about this Beer having come back so had a friend going to New England bring me some back in Bottles. Used to drink it back when I was young and traveled up there. I must say I was very pleased with the Exceptional Flavor it has. Head is a nice one about 1/2 inch smell a little corn and sweetness, nice straw color. I really think the new Narragansett is much more flavorful then the old one which I liked also but this one really goes good with snacks, food or just to sit and drink Beer. A working mans delight. I enjoyed it so much I got another friend to bring me 5 cases down to Pa this past weekend. I can highly recomend this one for taste and price it can't be beat."
"Seems to be a trend in bringing back retro beers. Most of these brands werent missed when they left the first time, but I always support having choices."
"Narragansett Beer pours a light golden yellow with a thick head that laces nicely as it fades from a sixteen ounce can. There is a typical macro lager aroma, albeit on the mild side. The mouthfeel is average for a macro lager. The flavor is grainy with a touch of spicy hops. Pretty good flavor for a macro."
"<sigh>"
"Poured into a delirium glass for shits and giggles. Gansett pours a clear straw yellow, with a decent white head that lowers at a normal rate. Light lacing. Light aroma of cereal grains, with no solid hop character. It has that mass produced beer aroma, with a sharp finish. Sweet flavors with a little twang at the end. Good mouthfeel, carbonation is medium. Very drinkable, but it is what it is, a better than average vintage/retro American beer. It could easily be my Pabst replacement. Good beer for the value."
"I read the review of this beer and figured it may be a good ""cheap beer"" to try. It poured a yellowish gold with a decent body and the head of foam was amazing. The taste was nothing special, but it wasn't horrible either. A good beer to have served ice cold for washing down pizza. You can definately taste the adjucts, but I still would rather drink this over the other macros out there. @ 6.00 for a six pack of talls, it is a good budget beer."
"D: I can swill quite a few of these and enjoy looking under the caps at the puzzles and sayings they've got. It's great cooking beer as well for beer bread and making chili."
"Wish it lived up to its mythic stature. Oh well, next?"
"Local beer bar has $2 tallboy Narragansett night so I had a few of these. Pours a golden yellow with a nice white head that sticks to the sides of the glass as it fades. The aroma is of medium malts with some medium hops blended together for that classic American macro aroma. The taste isn't too bad for this kind of beer. Nice mixture of the malts and hops that blend pretty well and quench my thirst. The mouthfeel is OK as it has a bit of a bite to it, but it is very drinkable and I don't mind have a few of these for $2 at the local bar. Worth a shot."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a creamy white head that leaves quickly. The color reminds me of the apple juice my daughter drinks. The beer is sparklingly clear. The smell is malty, apricots, and a little skunky. Taste is light. Mouthfeel is thin crisp and refreshing. Not to bad for a macro. I could drink a few of these and still operate heavy machinery (that's a joke). Honestly it was better than I had expected."
"Tastes pretty damn good, like a lighter version of something Sam Adams would make. They don't overdo malt heaviness, and you don't taste any adjuncts like rice or corn (I have no idea if they use such ingredients, but you try this beer _expecting_ it will taste like a Coors or Bud). It finishes slightly dry, with some hop bite left in the mouth. Might make for a good session beer."
"July 2009: I'm adding some points here. I've had this several times in the can and this is now my go-to lawnmower beer when it is hot outside. There is a nice sweetness to the lagery malts, and boy is this a light beer. Nothing to complain about for sure."
"Certainly drinkable I wish I had much more of this. Minor lack of a really tall head and simplistic scent but where this beer really shines is in the taste. A really good American made lager."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer, now lets bring this back to RI will ya."
"This beer works all year round, hot or cold."
"Damn, this was pretty good! Without question the best of its genre I've ever had. This beats the hell out of any BMC hand down. I would drink this big time in the summer as a lawnmower beer and even just keep some around for those times you want a beer like this. It is screaming for simple food - burgers, pizza, etc. There is definitely room in the world for beers like this. I like this, I will drink more of it, I'll have it around for my ""I only drink Bud"" friends & family. Definitely recommended!"
"Pours a medium yellow color with a head that fades fast. Aroma is bready/fruity with some malt showing through. Taste is strong and leaves a bready aftertaste with even a touch of bitterness. Goes down well. Not too bad of a beer but certainly not something I'd drink often."
"12oz brown bottle from Tiger Town in Gardiner. Dirty yellow (not quite gold) translucent body with a half inch of off-white head that quickly dissipates. Smells malty with hints of hops and adjuncts. Tastes sweet with just a hint of hop bite toward the finish, with adjuncts playing a bit of a role too. Very clean finish. Definitely the most flavorful American Macro/Pale Lager I've had. Lighter in mouthfeel but not watery or thin by any means. Extremely drinkable. I'm actually impressed with this one. And the combination of drinkability, good flavor, and price make this one a beer I'll be buying regularly."
"Hi neighbor! It's nice to see 'gansett back. They were pretty much closing shop when I started drinking beer so I don't know how closely it resembles the original, but it's damn tasty."
"I'm heading to RI for biz this week, and I am looking forward to having this on draft as well as sampling the bock and porter, which are not available in NW Connecticut."
"I drank Gansett back in the 70's in 7 oz returnable bottles.(35/case) I don't know if the new stuff is the same, but it's very good. It's not brewed in RI, but in Rochester under licence. It was $4.59/6pk 16oz cans or $5.49/6k 12oz bottles. No brainer. It has a beautiful yellow color and a 2in head that left a little lacing. In order the smell was malt, hops, and cerial. The taste was the same, but the hops were more pronounced. I gave it a 'low' score on drinkability because I found the beer substantial in character(filling), and probably couldn't nail more than 2 of them without a little break. I'm glad to see it back!"
"I honestly wasn't expecting much, but I'm pleasantly surprised. It won't wow anyone, I wouldn't think, but it has the crisp, satisfying character that results in a very drinkable if a bit macro-esque lager. Pretty decent for a mainstream flagship beer, I believe."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, slight hops, some spices, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly hoppy, and spicey/caramel. Light-Medium body. The finish is clean and crisp. Drinkable, the last time I had one of these was about 35 years ago, when I lived in Pawtucket, RI. It's not bad, way better than a Bud, Coors, or Miller."
"I recall Narragansett as a the mass-produced lager from the 1970s, although I was too young to partake in its frothy tastiness. Fast forward 30 years, and it seems the reborn Narragansett has developed a very slick, nostalgia-based marketing campaign selling itself as a simple, straightfoward brew. I enjoyed this one for being what it is - a clean tasting, enjoyable lager that is a nice complement to a summer cookout. Although it lacks the complexity of other so called premium lagers, sometimes you just want to sit down with your basic quality lager at the end of the day and relax. It's sort of the ""girl next door"" of beers, and doesn't aim to be on the cover of the next FHM magazine; and there's nothing wrong with that. I predict this will become a staple in my beer fridge."
" The 5.10% ABV makes this a really good session beer, and the drinkability of this makes it a worthy candidate as in introduction for the craft beer novice. No, it's not going to blow anyone away, but for someone looking for a cheap 6-pack, this would be a far superior choice to the BMC's in this world. Even for me, it's nice to have a drink like this now and then, and just let go from thinking my way through what I enjoy. Narragansett fills this role perfectly!"
"Overall it's nice a bad beer, a pretty decent macro, but it's priced between a budget and premium. Not sure why it's placed in a sixer with many crafts, I would rather pick up a 30 pack of Genny Creams for 11 bucks afterall they are the ones who are contracted to make it. It's a decent beer and it's nice to see a New England label back."
"Overall- A typical macro full of adjunct but much better then the big boys. I would choose this over all other macros with the exception of PBR."
"Notes: Special thanks to themaniacalone for the sample."
"Overall a very enjoyable and suprising macro. I would drink these regularly if available. Thanks to TheManiacalOne for the chance."
"D- like most in the style an easy drinker that finishes clean and smooth. Also this beer has more flavor than most in the style. This is a good everday standard beer."
"That being said poors slightly darker then most macros, with a fairly thick head. Smells pretty malty, with a bit of hops in the backround. A complex taste for an inexpensive beer, and finishes with a crisp mouthfeel. Extreamly drinkable"
"This macro truly distinguishes itself from a majority of its counterparts."
"Light bodied, aggressively but not overly carbonated, this is very pleasing on the palate. This is a beer that I could drink all night long."
"I'm moved by the attempt to bring back a New England tradition like Narragansett, but I think they're pricing themselves out of the competition."
"D: This stuff is actually really good and highly drinkable. At $5.49 per six pack it's a great value, too. Perfect on a hot day after mowing the lawn. It's certainly a hell of a lot better than Scudweiser."
"I was surprised by how unbad this was. Pours a yellowish amber with a fairly tenacious head. Constant upward carbonation. Smells of ricey beer, but not as ricey as many macros. There's some underlying grains as well, but no hops and little else in the way of esters. Sweet first off on the tongue, with corn-n-malt sweetness continuing through the mid palate. The finish dries out into grainy, crackery notes. Thin mouthfeel but smooth on the tongue. Surprisingly drinkable. If I had to drink a macro I'd probably go for this."
"Thought I'd give this a shot, not bad, nothing spectacular, nice easy drinking lager. Worth a try."
"This offering from Narragansett pours a maize yellow leaving a thin spotchy white lace. The nose is sweet, white sugar, also somewhat chemical in nature. The taste starts with a sweet rice feel on the palate with a faint hop presence and a decent highly carbonated body. Definatly a crisp lager with a slight aftertaste in the finish. Decent for a macro lager, but nothing that I will be visting again."
"This beer pours a light golden with a decent head that fades quickly. For its particular style, the macro lager, I'd say its the best I've ever had. It beats Bud, Coors, etc. The taste is of beer with a bit of a corn tinge, but nothing to complain about. If I want a cold lager beer, this is what I reach for every time. And you can't beat the price either."
"My macro of choice by far."
"Good thing this is available again cause aside from Genesee offerings, macros generally hurt me."
"By far the best macro I've ever tasted. Its just a good straight-up drinkin' lager for a hot day or if you're in the mood to drink many, many beers. Cheap as hell too..."
"This beer pours a pale yellowish gold into ""The Famous Narragansett Beer"" official lager glass which I obtained by buying a sixer of this stuff. Not much of a head to speak of. The aroma is of grains, grains, and more grains. This is a very crisp fresh tasting lager. Definitely something I could see drinking on a hot summer day. Not something I would reach for often however. This beats out many of the other macro lagers though. Nice to see their return to the brewing world."
"good drinkability, no off flavors here. i'd get this again with the warm weather months ahead. not bad at all for what it is."
"D: Since this beer is smooth and light, it’s a beer that you can put away quite easily. I’ve seen this beer and others described as “BBQ beers” and I’d say that it’s an accurate assessment. I also think this beer is a perfect “buzz maintainer.” Usually I drink a cheaper beer after I drink a bunch of some good stuff and I’m buzzing enough to not taste the good stuff anymore. While I won’t dare compare this beer to the higher quality beers that I start the night off with, transitioning over to this beer is easier than many other cheap beers that I’ve had."
"Narragansett pours a light orange with a nice inch head that doesn't stick around too long. I smell a sweet metalic graininess. Taste is sweet and grainy, maybe some hops in the background, but just barely. Its not as thin as some macro lagers, but not great either. I could drink this on a regular basis if I was hurtin' for money (more so then I already am). I guess a Providence based company bought the company back, but its still brewed in Rochester. Oddly enough, a six pack of tall boys is $4.49 where as the 12 ounce cans are $4.99. Apparently they're coming out with a porter and IPA, so that could be interesting..."
"I like the fact that Narragansett is a New England beer (even through it's contract brewed in Rochester, NY). Very cool. Worth checking out for sure. This is the first time that I can say I am truly enjoying and appreciating this style."
"Recap: Has flavor, the flavor is largely good and it was only $4.39 for a 6'er of 16 oz. cans. Not a bad deal at all."
"A fine lawnmower beer. Bring on summer!"
"Drinkable for what it is. Personally I dont seek out beers of this sort. But if I could buy this locally I could see myself drinking it once or twice a year which is about as often as I drink High Life or something similar. So, yes this beer tastes fine. If you like the style, go hog-wild! It is cool to see a once dead beer be revived. I got this sample from michiganmiked because NU won the Alamo Bowl you figure it out. Thanks!"
"D- Wow! what a treat, finally a macro with a bit of flavor. I would not have a problem having this in my fridge year round ... hell, it just bumped Schlitz off of my list."
"I saw this in MA, always heard about the ""nasty gannies", figured I would try a bottle. Pours crystal clear with a nice white head, very carbonated. Standard cheap beer aroma but not bad tasting. What do I taste, hops, probably dropped out of the brewmasters pocket. A little better than Bud but what does that really say."
"I would take this over BMC any day. All in all, not a bad brew, it would probably be pretty refreshing on a hot summer day."
"Pours a white, two finger-head that vanishes quickly leaving traces of lace. Crystal clear, golden amber. High carbonation and light bodied. Nose is faintly hoppy. Starts sweet, some hops mix in, mostly clean finish but traces of skunkiness creep in. $1.00 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" bright white head over the crystal clear pale straw brew. Head lasts ok, but still seems to dwindle as I watch, and lacing is minimal, although there is some. Aroma is minimal, kind of generic ""beer"" nose, nothing much standing out. Taste is pale malt sweetness upfront, which was balanced out with soft hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is not bad, which in my book is good for a style as light as this, coupled with nice and easy drinkability. Looks like this is a ""one to have when you're having more than one."""
"mouthfeel isn't carbonated enough. really lifeless. drinkable but not recommended at all. there are better lagers among the super cheapos, too."
