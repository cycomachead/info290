"Not very good, in my humble opinion"

"Out here on Roayan it makes for a crisp, refreshing brew, but nothing I'd buy again for how pricey it is out here on the island."

"Adjunct grain? ... grainy (and not just regular light malts) flavor. Hearty for style."

"optional is NOT mandatory, beeradvocate!"
"Not great, but not bad either, I like to sample the local brew wherever I go, this is good enough when I'm in SE Asia."

"pale clear straw color, not much head.   not much smell, a little corn.  same with the taste - very little flavor.  not too bad, but  bland.   thin body, medium carbonation."
""
""
"Just a mass produced beer."
""
"Not so great, but had to try anyway"
"Enjoy"

"Overall- a complete disappointment!  I have had this overseas many times in the 90's and when I picked up a sixer of this I was hoping to relive some good times from years back.  That is not the case, I am not sure if my palate has changed or the beer doesn't travel overseas very well when imported."
"Not the best but drinkable"
"A better AAL than Bud, Miller, and Coors. Went nicely with some Thai food, but I doubt I will make the effort to have it again."

"I am neutral on this beer."

"Bought this because I have not had it, not because I thought it was going to be an awesome beer......Well, not too shabby considering 1) it comes from Singapore, and 2) it is probably mass produced, and 3) it is probably cheaply made with cheap ingredients...This lager beats out the other foreign cheap ass lagers by quite a bit. Still have to deal with the malty, cereal, cheap flavor, but this one goes a bit above with a smooth mouth feel and drinkability that I did not expect. Don't get me wrong, this beer is on the bottom of most scales, but overall, a nice effort and much better than the  Palma Loucas and Famousas of the beer world !!"

"Brew pours a lighter to medium amber in color with a thin white cap with some light lacing seen. The aroma is of some sweet malt. Pretty much the same of the taste with what appears to be a light hint of apple also. Not real easy to drink as there is some bitterness for the finish. Strange taste also like it was made of stale grains. Lighter bodied with good carbonation. Not a fan of this brew and of this style much either."

"Drank way too many gallons of Tiger in the then British Crown Colony of Singapore.  Would love to try the export version; just for old times sake."
""
""
"Very solid and delicious tasting lager. Tastes great alongside Vietnamese food, specifically vermicelli noodles and chicken. Nothing too spectacular, but it isn't nearly as bad as the rating state. Cheap and satisfying."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium golden amber with a thin, patchy white head that persists; light lacng. Classic adjunct aroma of light sweet malt, hints of apple and grassy hops. Flavor follows, light sweet malt with mild biscuit, light apple, a hint of butter; finishes with light biscuit and grassy hops. Light to medium bodied. One nice thing about adjunct lagers is that they are designed not to offend and this is a bland, but pleasant light lager with perhaps a bit more biscuit and light apple than is typical, to its benefit. Not sure why this rates at poor here, it seems to be right on the spot for style, perhaps a bit more character. If I was stuck in Singapore (not a hot bed of craft beer, I suspect), I would have no problem ordering this."

"Tiger pours a light yellow with a massive head. This is a refreshing beer, enjoyable during the summer, and it's a beer that has a light taste, but still retains a flavor that ranks, for me, as a fine Asian brew, one that is much better than Sapporo or others on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Watery Stuff..."
"What can I say about tiger....it's the Asian corona light. I've had this on balmy NYC Sumer nights with friends and it's an easy drinker best when cold and with fried dumplings. Beats Coors lift anyway when with the guys ."
""
""
""
"Cold Tiger on a hot Saigon night is as good as it gets"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Certainly not the greatest lager you will ever come across but for a European light lager style beer this is more than drinkable. The flavour is really rather mild so if you want something with more punch then it is not for you but if you want something that is light crisp and easy to drink then get a bottle and at the risk of sounding silly try with Asian food."

"its another average asian yellow beer, but i have a special place in my heart for tiger beer, and not just because of my travels around the south pacific, but because i think it plays an important role in the beer world. its bright carbonation and lack of metallic flavors makes it a nice compliment to the spicy cuisine of its homeland. it cuts it well through heat and seafood flavors, and finishes super clean. i love it with good malaysian food because it cleans up each bite so i can taste it anew. better than many of its peers, its mouthfeel makes it work. pale malt flavors, a little watered down, but this is hard to beat after some time in the jungle for refreshment, and its also hard to beat with authentic thai or indonesian food too. its clean and drinkable, without the strange extract sweetness of others. it also, for whatever reason, doesn't give me the same hangover that most other asian beer does, i don't know why, but it just seems milder on the comedown for me. nothing special obviously, below average of course in terms of all craft beer, but in its context its a little better than most."

"Flavor: white bread dough, sweet barley malt, biscuit, cracker, with some mild herbal hop flavor Overall: very nice lager. More complex than many pale lagers."

"I found this Singaporean Beer at Binny's Beverage Depot in Chicago and at Feldman's Market in McAllen, Texas. I must say this is a good beer from Asia, it has a simple but complex taste, goes down great, and does not leave you to bloated. It pours clear, with a light golden color, with white laces running up to the average head, which dissapates quicky. The body is solid, with decent carbonation, and has decent malt aroma. There is a slight metalic edge, but is overshadowed by a malty aftertaste."
""
""
"Overall - Ok, not a great beer by any stretch of the imagination, and not even a very good beer, but for what it is, it isn't terrible. Of course there are other options at cheaper price points that are better too."
""

"Tiger ---2.5/5"
""
""
"Overall, a beer I only got because it was a $2 16oz at the food spot I was at and I really wanted a beer."
""

"Drinkable, light with enough bittereness to freshen you up. Thumbs up."

"On the top range of adjunct lagers, very refreshing and not immediate or screaming off-flavors. Good beer to drink at a tropical beach or with spicy food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"More or less the same as the other macro-brewed lagers, maybe a touch more complexity than its american counterparts"
""
""
"Carbonation is pretty high, and it's really crisp. It's light and thin, obviously, though not overly watery considering. It's not too sticky on the tongue considering the sweetness in the flavor. It's also got some smoothness to it."
""
""
"O - I was not impressed with this. All around it was boring and poor in all categories."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tiger, on the other hand, tastes like something has gone terribly wrong in the adjunct department, kind of like too much corn really spoils a lot of American adjuncts. Mostly saw this in Malaysia, but also in Indonesia and elsewhere. Avoid it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this was inoffensive, though uneventful as well."
""
""
"Just when I thought I had tried the worst adjunct lager on the face of the earth, something else comes along to up the ante. Like a number of other imported beers of this style, this one contained some horrible hop extracts that made the finish offensively bitter and dry. This was a definite drain pour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Slightly better than average but still rather mediocre. Not one to get if you have plans to enjoy a beer at home but a better drink to get on a night out instead of the common lagers."
"A little more flavor than some adjunct lagers, but nothing too exciting."

"I love the Detroit Tigers, still like Tiger Woods, swear by Tiger Brand underwear, used to love Tiger Beat Magazine and Tigger from Winnie the Pooh, but can't say i'm too fond of Tiger Beer. Lets call this one ""A. J. 5%"""

"To the Point: I do like this lager; it is like I said ‘crisp, clean, and refreshing’; a very good beer for playing yard games or other summer activities; Detroit Tiger Fans should give this a try"
""
"This beer is not terrible. It's deep gold with a small head but a nice lace on the glass. The smell is malty and sweet, clean and crisp, with noticeable alcohol... just not that outstanding. Taste is not that strong. What's there is ok, some malt bitterness toward the end with a sweeter herbal taste at first. Way too carbonated, so much that it takes away from the taste. That's the biggest flaw I see. This beer is ok, worth drinking if it's in front of you."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a good beer for the tropical climate and goes very well with the many asian cusines available in Singapore."
"This is my first drain pour after 30-some reviews. It's just... it's just not good."
""
""
""
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Crystal clear pale straw color. Light carbonation and very light bodied. sweet grainy nose, flavor is sweet corn and light hops. Good lawnmower beer, not much else. 12oz bottle from Gift Specialists Oceanside, California."

"Tiger is the big beer from Singapore. It tastes mostly like Beck's -- if you imagine a heavier, somewhat breadier/yeastier, somewhat sweeter Beck's you'll get Tiger. It's not my favorite beer of it's type and I doubt it's worth actively searching out, but it's okay and probably suits the local cuisine fine. Mildly recommended for those purposes."
""
""
"O/D - Decent lager that was clean but lacking goodness. Avoids common faults of the style. Went well with pizza, but nothing I would look into too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not much going on here. Beer was gone in a few sips."
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, glad I went to a unique place for dinner with the girl and followed it up with a unique beer choice. No socks will be blown off but this went very well with my dinner. Worth a shot."
"I am not blown away by Tiger Beer, but I am not as upset as I expected to be when we started reviewing this lager. It's clean, simple, and boring… but it's not terrible. I wouldn't seek this out again unless food was involved."
""
""
""
"O: Nothing to write home about, but definitely in the top decile for the style in my opinion. The rice character makes it interesting and I would sooner drink this than any of its American-made peers given the choice."
""
""
""
"Overal, meh. Not my thing. Can see why this is a popular beer- sessionable, that's about it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"330ml bottle, poured into Leffe chalice. Golden colour, head was tiny and faded fast, clear. Aroma was corn, rice, yeast, syrup and berries. Tasted corn, rice, yeast, syrup. Had a fairly bitter finish that didn't balance out the sweetness. Not much carbonation, texture was syrupy and thick, smooth. Overall what you would expect an ajunct lager to be, won't be rushing out to buy more but it wasn't offensive."
""
"It pours a straw yellow color with a thick white frothy head. The smell is slightly metallic with some grass, lemon and bread. The flavor is lacking, all I could pick up was the typical 'continental lager' flavor with lots of bread and metal, really not too bad though. It is pretty light with moderate carbonation and a slightly dry finish. I'd drink this beer plenty.... If it was cheaper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a way below average lager. I tend to enjoy most foreign pale lagers but not this one. Dial back the DMS and sweetness and it would be tolerable."
""
""
""
""
"Golden yellow, with very little head, light soapy lacing on the glass. Smells like grass and citrus. Old citrus. Very strange, metallic taste with a harsh aftertaste. This is truly a horrible beer. Supposedly the most popular beer in Singapore. I'd assume this is the Asian equivalent to Keystone."
"Pretty horrible here. It's drinkable if it's the only beer around and you're coming off of a long period of not drinking... like a year or so."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear darker yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is very mild and is of malt, grain, and some grassy and hay aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity and slightly metallic flavor on the finish. There is a mild herbal bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer but it's drinkable and even has a slightly hoppy edge in the flavor unlike other Asian beers of the same style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very uninteresting beer."
"Thin head on a Clear deep golden body. Aroma is light with breads, light floral, grains and sweet corn. Flavor is also fairly bready, sweet corn, Pale malts and almost no hop character. Medium body and moderate carbonation. As far as American adjunct lagers go this one has decent flavor without off putting flavors. Not bad for what it is."
""
"As the bomber-sized bottle was more commonplace during a recent trip to Singapore I decided to revisit the Tiger. It poured a pale golden-tan with nice foam. Still not much of an aroma, and the honeyed-sweet corn cereal flavor dominated the flavor profile. However, the combination of an ice cold lager and the hot, humid temperatures made this more enjoyable than it had any right being."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The most popular beer in Singapore.Its brewed on malt from europe and australia.Its developed by Heineken.Acia Pacific breweries started to brew it in 1931.It got really popular in ww2 by the allied groups in the far east,the soldiers took some beers home to introduce it... Lighth yellow lager 5%."
""
""
""
""
""
"The texture is crystal clear with golden color along with small white foamy head that dissipates rather swift into some sheet of bubble atop. Visible carbonation is high and yields smooth yet refreshing mouth feel through the palate within its medium body. The aroma and taste are rather clean and predominated by grain while malty sweet, a bit husk and light hop bitterness come in supporting. Actually, there is nothing to remember about this macro brew but anyway it still can invigorate my day when I need to get something not too serious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light, soft lemon yellow color, with a big but quickly vanishing, fluffy white head. The aroma is unfortunately typical of the style, with little but a musty, light bready aroma. The flavor is likewise thin and common, with a light grainy sweetness predominating. Overall, this is a decent alternative to other fizzy yellow lagers, but it doesn’t provide much pleasure beyond that."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: just a bad lager, not drinking this one again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very large pillowey white head over a effervescent yellow body. Really lively! Head lasts longer than most beers. Aroma is light spicy hops. Mild. Tastes are balanced but unremarkable. Fairly creamy palate - much softer carbonation than I expected from the appearance. Good, but nothing great. Easy drinking on a hot day."
"I went with an aggro pour just to see what would happen. I got a finger-and-a-half of rocky, bone-white head with limited retention. Color was a straw yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled of silage. Hmm. What once was new is old again. Mouthfeel was thin and filled with corn. Finish was semi-sweet, very corn-like and as boring as the Old Lady in the Missionary position. Man, it made me long for Twister yum yum, you know - lift your left leg to blue ..."
""
""
"Meh - a run-the-gamut macro lager, nothing special. Dull and devoid of character, with some faint but unwelcome corn notes. Probably OK on a hot day in Singapore, but not worth spending your money on over here. Give it a miss."
"Overall - A standard American adjunct lager with a slight edge over the competition."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is light and briskly carbonated, and the drinkability is good. For an adjunct lager, you can do a whole lot worse. At least this has a bit of flavor to it, and finishes clean. That said, it's also far too expensive for what it is. Give me a Yuengling Premium or Gannset Lager over this any day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - 3.5/5 - not a bad lager, but nothing that really grabs my attention either."
""
"O: The light flavors in this beer would probably make it a nice accompaniment to spicy Asian food."
"O: I actually enjoyed this beer more than I was expecting and I could see how it would pair well with the local cuisine in Singapore. Very easy to drink and refreshing which is what makes it sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't understand why this beer is expensive, there's nothing to it really."
"Pours clear straw with a good sized head. Smell is very faint mild grainy sweetness. Taste is mellow sweet malt. Just a little grassy hops in the finish. Low bitterness. Medium to light bodied. Crisp and well carbonated. Very drinkable. Overall this is a good beer for the style. I can't really find anything to complain about. It is very ordinary but there are no off-notes."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Probably just a good spicy food beer and that's about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-so glad I got to try beer from Singapore! Too bad it wasn’t remotely memorable. Not awful but I can’t recommend seeking this out."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Way better than the Corona I enjoyed on Christmas Eve although it was well past its recommended ""drink by"" date. Just a hint above average."
""
"Overall - Another beer that won't knock your sock off, but it highly drinkable and pretty refreshing. I had this while out eating some spicy food and it worked quite well to cool the heat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Pedestrian lager but there a many worse out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent light, moderately refreshing adjunct lager with a few less-than-crippling flaws. Drinkable, but other than that there is nothing noteworthy about this beer. Not really worth trying, unless you're a pale lager fan or you want to be able to say you've had beer from Singapore. I wouldn't turn this down, but I doubt I'd directly purchase it again... maybe on-tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: pretty bland and boring. the flavors aren't great and with the addition of the metallic component is a bit detracting."
"Now I know why: these SE Asian beers are so light they usually won't survive the hot and lengthy travel. don't bother reviewing them if you're pulling them off a US shelf cause it's not the crisp clean quaffer you get in SE Asia. that's not to say this is something special fresh out of the brewery, it's just a very simple beer meant to be refreshing after a long hot day or paired w/ spicy hot food."
"Airport sushi bar, limited beer selection - might as well give it a try. Overall, not bad, for what it is, which is a generic adjunct lager. There are certainly worse examples of the style. Up front the beer is clean but not flavorless, with cereal notes and a passable amount of hops. Nothing memorable or even particularly worthwhile, but not offensive either. Next time I'd opt for a Japanese rice lager, but this was fine for washing down some rolls."
"Overall, I'm not impressed and would not buy a six pack or recommend it to my buddies."
"O - By no means terrible, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to grab a can. Taste like any other Canadian macro lager."
"O - Overall, I like this better than say, Budweiser, but that doesnt mean I want to drink this every day. Another country checked off and slightly surprised in the quality."
"This beer tasted like any typical lager. Imagine Budweiser with a little more flavor. The appearance was very light and looked like a typical adjunct lager.There was hardly any smell to it at all. The mouthfeel was very fizzy and light. As the beer got warmer the taste got worse. Not a beer I would recommend to any one."
"Well worth the try - a solid macro lager. Very refreshing on a hot day in Singapore."
"O: Nothing offensive for sure, but nothing memorable either. Relatively bland."
"Overall, I dig this. This might be my macro lager of choice now! It is an excellent example of a basic lager that doesn't suck."
"The beer pours a pale yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very faint. I get a little bit of unattractive grain notes in the aroma but that is about it. The flavor is very sweet with some malt and grain notes. Not real hops character, but at least there are not any real ""off"" flavors. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not a beer I will try again."
"Had this in a 12 ounce can at the Macau Tower in Macau. Least expensive item I purchased in Macau. 15 MOP or about $2.00 USD. It was a typical macro lager. Light and a little on the sweet side. Poured a fizzy yellow into my glass. Light white head that quickly receded. Aroma of grain and some faint grassy hops. Taste was light and corn-like with hints of bread dough and some faint bittering. Was refreshing enough in the steamy morass that is Macau."
"It does however avoid the pitfall of being harsh in flavor, only to fall into the pitfall of having too little flavor. Watery and thin in feel, at least it is carbonated correctly and refreshing to drink. But than again, so is plain water."
"Maybe it's better with food?"
"I have to say I'm surprised, maybe even astonished - not to put too fine a point on it - at how little I hate this. It's fairly bland, but it's inoffensive, unpretentious and very drinkable."
"Waiting in the Singapore Airlines lounge waiting for flight to Jakarta....and they had Tiger on tap. Poured into a refrigerated mug. The appearance was ok...clear golden color with some carbonation that frothed to a nice head, which has dissapated to very thin. the smell is balanced...meaning not much going on, but not overpowered by grain, which is common for american adjuct lagers. The taste is quite different then other beers of this style. This beer has a interesting malt character that changes the taste somewhat. Its a decent beer and could drink a few of these....but would be afraid of the hang-over from this one."
"maybe it was that I just really needed a cold beer at the time.."
"Stay away, you have been warned. If you're coming to Singapore, try it once. You'll be disappointed. Head to restaurants with craft brews. I think the water we have here is too clean and soft for good brews."
"Had this with spicy chinese food, a bomber. In short, I could close my eyes and think ti's a BMC. Overall, it's nothing special at all, I am sure if I was surfing in Bali, I would be all over this. THis beer needs to be as cold as can be, once it warms up at all the flavors go south in a hurry. Not worht a try, unless in Bali."
"O – Off-aroma, but ok taste. Body could use a little work."
"Pours a light golden semi straw color with a thick white head and just a tad of simple lacing. Smells of straw paper, hay, and a little bit of corn adjunct and some sweetness. Tastes of a little mellow barely bitter hops, corn oils, and some malty sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium and crisp and refreshing. Overall, it isn't bad for its style, but not something I would ever consider decent."
"Picked this one up pretty much to just finish filling a 6 pack up. Mostly this beer is like many other lagers. I'm sure it's got hops, barley and malts in it but to what extreme are they putting in? Anyway the beer is pee yellow with very little head. The aroma is mostly malt no hop aroma unfortunately. This beer is rather bland, with something as wild as a tiger on the label should this brew be a little more aggressive?"
"O: not the best Asian lager I've had by a long stretch. Avoid."
"The flavor is sweet -- definitely all maltiness, a little corn, a little citrus maybe. The hop content is subdued. Tiger is smooth and easy-to-drink, and though it's pretty unremarkable, this one fares better than most American adjuncts."
"Too sweet for me to drink a bunch of these, but no noticeable alcohol either, so if you don't mind the sugar, drink up."
"RJT"
"D: Very downable and good enough for the (1). 'Worth it,' perhaps, but not anything I'd really drink. Not recommended unless you're eating Asian food and don't want to think about drinking."
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a quickly disappearing white soda like head. Surprisingly there is a little bit of lacing. There are lots of grains and a bit of grass in the nose. There is a small amount of hops in the middle of the nose then it finishes with a metallic flavor. The taste is grainy and a little sweet. It ends clean with a bitter tinge. Its light bodied with medium to high carbonation. Very crisp and sudsy. Drinkability is great. Nothing offensive. One of the best american adjunct lagers Ive had actually. I was surprised at this one."
"This is certainly not the best American Adjunct Lager but it's a cut above many of them."
"D: Very good, mild with a light-medium body. Easy to drink. Ironic how the best AAL's I've had have been produced outside the US."
"D: Better than Budweiser, but not by much."
"Overall, for a lager, very good. It's plain compared to my favourite overall beers, but still good!"
"D - Now I know most people bash these mass produced beers, but picture yourself in Singapore, with a hot Laksa drinking Tiger beer. It would go down a treat. This is a good clean inoffensive lager that is of a good quality."
"See more at abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style for whatever that's worth, there are a lot of other beers in the style I would rather drink if my choices were that limited."
"The taste and drinkability are the standouts of Tiger. I really enjoy the flavor. It's a lot like any other light tasting Asian beer, but I'm a fan of Asian beers. Tastes of straw and hops, a pretty average and normal flavor."
"D: Decent for this price level compared to Budweiser and other American macrolagers, but I wouldn't get it again."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, but nothing special. Would probably go well with a spicy food. However, it's very cheap quality and lacking of flavor. Could get the same thing with a domestic American beer. Pick one. Bud, miller, coors, etc. They all are chaep, flavorless, but effective."
"Drinkability : Give me this with lot's of Singaporean spicy food during the hot weather of Chinese New Year in Singapore, I would gladly say that I'm in heaven :) Would pick this up for some heart to heart talk session with friends back in Singapore. Overseas ? Yes only if the price is lower or same as in Singapore, this beer ain't cheap in US or Aussie"
"All the typical pieces are there, from the light look to the light taste to the easy consumption. This is a standard drink-while-you-watch-football taste, which you can easily avoid for much smaller prices. This is only good for the label/variety/tiger and otherwise Bud itself does the job and it's American."
"D - Drinkable because it is bland. It's not doing it for me."
"What it does is fit the mold of a proper pilsner unfailingly. There's enough pleasant taste and palate-pleasing character to recommend it. I think I will drink this one more than once."
"M&D: Medium carbonation. Light bodied with a watery thinness. Goes down easy enough, though."
"overall for the style it was not terrible, but compared to my normal fair, i will pass."
"I wouldn't mind having this again, BBQ, picnic, beer promo at a bar."
"It's no surprise that one of the world's leading financial centers should brew a beer that is so clearly rooted in values of economy and efficiency, brewed according to concerns of scale and cost, one that discounts taste and quality all but entirely. Well Tiger brewery, let me say this to you in a language you can understand: no repeat purchase."
"M/D: Typical macro."
"D - Fairly basic lager, could be drank steadily if desired but nothing special."
"D - smoothe= drinkable, no offensive flavours."
"Very average but it would work well on a blazingly hot day. I think I'd prefer something with a cleaner profile but this will do if you're stuck in a virtual beer desert."
"Nothing to see here. As adjuncts go, I have certainly tried better for cheaper and more local."
"Not a fan, but some people like the 'exoticness' of it."
"I poured into a pint glass to a fluffy, white head. It is yellow in color. It smells sweet and grainy/grassy, better than I expected. The taste is sweet but it seems to have that bitter metal taste I get a lot in imported lagers. This isn't as bad as some other imported lagers, but it isn't going to be making it into my rotation."
"D: Not bad. Extremely watery beer, should come with a bit more hops"
"D- An average mass produced lager but the skunked sweet popcorn notes make this a poorer example."
"Drinkability: Nothing at all about this beer stands out. It isn't bad, but it's definitely not good, either. I probably wouldn't have this again."
"M/D - Easy drinker, reminds me of a macro brew, don't need to name names, we can figure out which ones. Slight citrus sweetness but almost not that noticeable. Wouldn't seek this out again, reminded me to much of a macro brew"
"d- not too bad, this would be great with asian food, it goes down very easily, and is definately sessionable, thought i'm not sure i ever will, this was probably a one timer. i've gotta give credit, it's better than many other adjuncts that i've had in the past."
"D- Avoid unless it's all that's available, or you really just don't give a damn."
"D: Average to below, it's the smell that puts me off this beer everytime."
"D-- As Asian lagers go this is workable. Good for a hot day and want to quench your thirst quickly. One is good enough to suffice. A little too much sweetness to do more than 2 though, as would get an upset stomach from the sugar and corn. Best way to go with this beer is pair it with stuff like salt and pepper squid, crab or some spicy Asian dish. Much better beer when paired with food and far more sessionable with the right foods. Also a half to a full letter grade better when paired with the right foods."
"Nothin' better than drinking an Asian AAL while watching some low-grade chop socky. ""Shaolin Ex-Monk"" to be exact. The clear, very pale straw is just as bland and unexciting as the dubbed dialogue I'm being forced to listen to. If only this brew had such an awesome fake moustache as this guy here... Ah, without visuals that didn't work as well as I'd hoped, but trust me, it's a cool fake moustache. And those sound effects: every movement of an arm or leg produces a beast of a whoosh, just as unsatisfying as the weak, ricy, corny, almost metallically sour nose on this thing. Along side the usual corn syrup, toasted rice, and baked wheat tastes is a hint of vague, blunt bitterness with a tiny bit of tinny edge. Wow, do these attempts at physical comedy suck, and in the best way! Now, as lame as the taste is (as is this movie), at least it's nice and light, both in body and in carbonation, and goes down easily, allowing it to be done with quickly. If only this movie would move along so easily..."
"It doesn't have enough flavor to taste bad, really, but it's also not good. It's probably not the worst of the style I've had, but it hardly stands out."
"Poured into a pint glass where the foamy head disappeared in mere moments, leaving no head atop a straw yellow lager. The nose was what you have come to expect from a lager - sweet without bitterness. The beer itself initially comes across as a smooth finishing lager, but gives up a metallic aftertaste over time that kills any flavours within the beer. No evidence this beer ever came into contact with a hop either. The carbonation is low, which contributes a terribly thin mouthfeel, water-like in its consistency."
"D-Pretty drinkable due to its water consistency and no offensive flavors. If you are at an Asian restaurant it wouldn't be a bad decision to try it."
"what makes this rise above what is expected is that this simply tastes solid. the cheapy sweetness one would expect is nowhere to be found....instead, there is a nice crispness and lack of thinness...a slight hoppy bitterness permeates, giving this some sense of body. true, nothing spectacular, but this is better than 90% of the crap american, mexican, euro and asian brews. not to say this is the best 'crap' brew! at this price, i found a damn good asian lager that sizzles out most japanese and chinese beers i've had. maybe this was just a lucky bottle. worth a try. beats the u.s. Macro market with ease..."
"overall i would choose this over most other crappy beers, but i would never buy this if given a choice."
"This shouldn't even be a beer in Germany, as the ingredient list reveals sugar. The smell is sharp and discordant, it tastes like a sweeter version of the style, and the mouthfeel is a touch syrupy but not necessarily unpleasant. Pretty decent with spicy food."
"D- pretty much run of the mill for me. seems better than BMC due to slightly more fruitiness in the flavor and a touch more hop bitterness. easy going, easy drinking. i could have thought it was a light beer if it wasn't 5% abv."
"M/D: Nothing special, but given the alternatives, this is a good session beer in a place far from home, especially when the pool tables are free."
"Appearance is light golden yellow with a nice crisp head. Smell has nothing that really stands out, light grains and hop. Taste has the adjuct and then leaves your mouth with a light bitter dryness. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Nothing special, but not bad."
" ~ This isn't a bad beer by any means. It is an easily consumed brew despite the spicy note."
"If you ever travel on Air Singapore you will get to drink plenty of this I promise."
"Drinkability: perhaps this goes well with chicken rice? Who knows, but I doubt I'll be drinking this again anytime soon."
"Not terrible, but one of the lower rated beers I tried this weekend. Don't think I'll ever get it again."
"D: It's OK. That's about the best I can say. Keep it cold to stop what little flavor there is from going down hill."
"Carbonation is way too strong, and the body is very watery."
"I was skeptical about this brew and rightfully so. It was a pretty gold color with medium carbonation. It smelled of wheat. The taste was wheat and slightly acidic on the aftertaste. It had almost no lacing at all. I noticed a few hours later that same acidic feeling in my throat was still there. This will not be a repeat purchase."
"Overall, a macro lager. Plain and simple, but it did help to add a little more vividness to some memories, so well worth the $10 for the sixer (even though its 1/5 that price in nam) haha."
"Had in a Thai restaurant (very limited choices) with soup and salad. Poured from the bottle to a pale golden yellow, and typical of most Asian beers, had little nose or taste. However, as with a lot of those, it was not overly disgusting either...just a cold way to wash down spicy food."
"All in all, I think this Tiger Beer would probably be one of the most likely adjunct lagers I would be willing to pick up. If it's fresh, served cold in a Pilsener glass, and drank quickly, it can be a pretty decent lager..."
"For an adjunct lager- kind of impressed. Appearance is average, a bit more golden than most of the others. Smell is ok, nothing really prominent, but very clean and no skunkiness. Taste is nice, some mild maltiness and that's about it. Mouthfeel is right on par for the style. Drinkability was good."
"Notes: Overall its not bad at all for a pale lager."
"Seemed like the Japanese budweiser. Next."
"standard lager from Asia. Tart smell. Golden color. Med carbonation. Sour grainy taste, that's it... Its a decent choice when you're in SE Asia, otherwise just ok. The brew is very popular in Thailand and Singapore, but the time for Tiger may be just once"
"Gold color and pretty clear. Loads of tiny prickle that looks like you plunked an alka-seltzer in the glass. Some light lacing and rim of foam. The aroma explodes out of the bottle and the glass as its poured. Very grainy and little bit sour on that nose. Mostly grains, a little bit of hops and little sour in the nose category. Those hops must be what they ""triple hop"" a very popular macro-brew with as there is not much of it in the flavor. The attack is clean and much maltier than I had anticipated. All of the grain and hops of the nose are really absent from the flavor and I am somewhat let down. Even the sour tones would have been welcome. Average to slightly above on the mouthfeel as its a little thicker than most beers of this category and thicker than you would assume from its appearance and smell. Pretty clean and straightforward. Not bad, but not noteworthy. Maybe average to a shade below. It would hit the spot on a hot day on the golf course or the softball field I bet. It makes me think of something that you might drink after a hard day of construction or landscaping. It made me hearken back to my college summers of construction work. Just ""down the hatch"" and start looking for another."
"Crisp and clean in the mouth."
"This is an above average beer that begs you to do what a lager beer wants you to do... drink another, and another, and another. Seriously, a clean, crisp lager beer, for those times when you really don't want to be overwhelmed by taste, flavor, smell, etc. A fair beer, reasonably priced, nothing more."
"And what is it with animals on labels of mass-produced lager? Moosehead, Antarctica, Tiger....are the marketers aware of the animal-piss jokes if the beer is sub-standard to the consumer?"
"While this seems to fulfill the trope of working well with various spicy Southeast Asian cuisines, on its own, it's pretty below average, even for this generally less than impressive style."
"I'd love to say that this beer is really good, but it's just not. Still, it has a cool bottle cap, so collectors have something to look forward to. And, honestly, there are worse beers on the market. I'm glad I only grabbed one of these badboys, though, as I don't anticipate going back for more any time soon."
"Not bad, really. It's a lawnmower beer for sure. Nothing that will offend anybody, and is pretty drinkable. If I had to choose between this and many macros we have here, I think I'd choose this."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale gold color with virtually no head. There is a sweetness in the aroma. taste is slightly sweet and not overly flavorful. Feels a little watery in the mouth. Goes down very smooth and quickly. I drank this on tap in Singapore and remember it was quite tasty. Overall a good, mild tasting beer."
"Pours a shiney bright yellow with small column of sluggish bubbles and no head. The aroma is nothing. I smell nothing, thats not terrible. But I do expect a little aroma in a beer. The taste some super faint toasted pilsner malt, Indian corn, and grassy hops. Hasa grainy, grist feel upfront. Then leaves a watery adjunct finish. A beer that isn't bad, and you can drin and not think about."
"pours medium yellow, somewhat like urine when dehydrated. very skunky smell with not the faintest hint of typical beer aromas. tastes of alcohol, and not much else - lots of glycerine and clashing sour and sweet tones. Foul aftertaste, and unpleasant reminders for hours after drinking thanks to the ""flavours"" reappearing in burps. I wouldn't drink this at gunpoint - ok maybe I would, but only if on tap and very very cold."
"Mouthfeel is watery, light bodied, with carbonation that is not excessive enough to be prickly or biting. A really easy drinking beer. So easy, you may not realize that you had a beer at all. In a word, boring."
"Mouthfeel is nothing special and drinkability is average. I only plan on drinking if nothing else is available or if I can't afford anything else. I wouldn't turn it down if offered, but most likely won't buy it again as there are often much better beers available in the UK at low prices."
"overall a must if in singapore when eating at the hauka, but otherwise just your average asian brew."
"Mouthfeel is thin on body and higher in carbonation than I would prefer. Drinkability is good in the sense that it's a lawnmower beer but I wouldn't seek out 6 packs for regular consumption. That said, if it's fresh, I would choose it over American macro lagers like Bud any time."
"D - Clean finish, pretty tasteless, but honestly great for a muggy afternoon at Orchard Towers"
"Wanted something totally different and on the light side while having lunch with friends, so I ordered a bottle. Don't see this on menus too often. Poured into a standard pint glass. Yellow color, with a slight hint of orange. Decent head, but faded fast. Slight bit of lacing. Smelled a bit malty. And yes, it tasted like an average lager, but it had a bit of malt backbone that allowed it to stand on its own a bit. Not great, but not horrible. Slightly sticky aftertaste though. Easy to drink, not forgettable, probably would be good with Asian food. Decent mid-day drink, but not something to order at a place with better choices."
"Uninspired"
"Poured a 12oz beer into my Maredsous chalice. This beer pours a corn yellow with a pretty supple head for the style. It's pretty creamy and leaves a bit of lacing as the beer recedes down the glass. The aroma is, what I consider, mildly generically sweet. There really isn't that canned corn aroma that comes with most macro lagers. The flavor reminds me of a mix between Heineken and Bud Select. It has a bit of a sulfuric funk and bland canned corn sweetness. Also there is an odd aspartame chemically-ness to it also. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and just a touch of dryness. As with all macro lagers, I think its pretty drinkable, especially on a hot day."
"Drinkability: Oh, come on, it's not so bad. Really! Though it leaves me wishing I had some tasty Asian grub to wash it down with."
"Drinkability: Some of the beers I have had in India and Asia are so bad that I can not even finish one. So with a decent level of smoothness and a light, sweet character, I would put this ahead of those in terms of tolerability. That said, it certainly is not a beer I would go out of my way to purchase, and I would probably laugh at anyone drinking it in the U.S. as an ""import."""
"Pours like a typical macro-lager. Yellow with a thin, pure white head. The head sticks around as a thin cap. Smells of adjuncts, but relatively clean and not too sweet. The taste is a bit sweeter, and there is a slight graininess that comes through as well. Some very slight hops on the finish that are mostly overwhelmed by the adjunct sweetness. Not terrible, but a bit too sweet and uninspired. The carbonation is right, but it would be crisper without the adjuncts. Just okay. One of those beers you end up drinking at an Asian restaurant because the other options are worse. Meh."
"A decent beer for what it is (a macro lager). Got turned on to this one in Asia and like to have a few with spicy Asian foods. I would have a hard time pairing that with a Russian Imperial Stout or many of my other favorite beers."
"D- It's a very average beer. I wouldn't pay the premium price for this import when many of the more common domestic or Canadian lagers are of the same quality at a better price."
"http://foodbeertravel.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/delhi-best-pub-food/"
"Overall: Not great. Nonetheless a clean adjunct lager comparable to Miller, etc."
"D - Not really my cup of tea. Lacked anything worth remembering, but not terrible. Drinkable if you're looking for something light without too much flavor."
"D - Very drinkable, especially with Thai food."
"Pretty drinkable misc. lager. I don't have many light lager favorites."
"Overall, it is drinkable but nothing special. Much better lagers out there."
"D- meh, for the style it isnt that bad. sure, there are macros id rather have, but if this was all that was available i wouldnt really suffer. im glad i tried something from asia."
"this is the typical asian attempt at american style macro beer. it's got that nasty smell that's associated with the style too. however, it's the best beer in asia and it tastes more like a malt liquor than beer."
"Looks like I'm in the minority here... but I thought this beer was well above average. Got mine in a 6 pack of bottles from our local Hyvee supermarket and poured in to a glass. The most noticeable attribute of this one for me was that it was extremely smooth and crisp. I found it to be one of the smoothest lagers I've had in a long time. It was sort of heavy though, so not the best choice for a long session beer. It had a very non obtrusive aroma... almost nothing there. I think that contributes to the overall appeal to me. If your looking for a smooth, crisp, somewhat filling beer without the hoppyness or odor of other beer styles that might be this thick... this is a good bet."
"Would go well with spicy Thai food, but I certainly wouldn't go looking for it outside a restaurant type venue."
"Had this with some Cambodian food -- certainly addressed the fire, curry, and multi-spiced dish by cleaning the palate without taking away from the food. Not something I'd knock a 6-er down on, but if you find yourself in a particular restaurant, give it a try. It works with the cuisine."
"This beer poured a deep yellow with a two-finger head that didn't last long and some aggressive carbonation. The smell is sweet with a a lot of the corn adjunct that's prominent in American Macro-style beers. The taste is sweet bread with a little bit of corn that doesn't linger and leaves next to no aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp, if a bit watery. I'd say where this beer shines is its drinkability. Nothing to write home about, but would probably make a good companion beer to some spicy food or on a hot summer day."
"This was the last beer I had on my way home from Bali when we stopped overnight in Kuala Lumpur. What a way to end a trip! The tiger poured very clear with a pale gold colour. The white cap disappeared fast, leaving a few fizzy, soapy bubbles behind. The aroma was mild and inoffensive, just a little sweet with a clean yeast profile and a hint of spicy hops. Very mild bitterness, sweet with some grain and faint hop character. It also seemed to be a bit sour with some acidity that seemed to come from the carbonation. Light bodied and dry, CO2 was crisp. Not a bad beer in the heat, but there's not much here as far as character. A decent industrial lager, just not something I'd go looking for."
"Not at all impressed with this, but I honestly didn't think I would be, except as a bland shit beer. Still, I can find shit beers that were at least brewed in this country for less money that are still better tasting than this. Tiger? More like that pissy prima donna housecat one might have encountered as a child at their dotty aunt's house."
"D- I can't do it. It'll make me vomit, especially after a night of GOOD drinking at Mahar's."
"D- Glad I got to try it but I'll pass on this one."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color lager with a large pure white foamy head with some good retention but no lacing. Aroma consists of sweet malt with some minimal adjunct showing. Taste is also dominated by a bland medium sweet malt taste with no easily discernable adjunct. Not the most complex beer out there but definitely not the worst pale lager out there."
"Drinkability- Average and a little bit refreshing."
"Pretty easy drinker. Although, it's not really anything creative, it still tastes pretty good, I could drink quite a few of these."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Medium, quickly disappearing head on a ""lager yellow"". Faint sweet smell at the end, but other than that, it smelled and tasted very unremarkable. Had a nice smoothness, however, went down pretty easily. Not bad, but nothing exciting."
"A decent stab at the style, yet nothing above and beyond..."
"This is a fairly straightforward beer. The flavor is very clean with light, sweet bready malts. There's nothing offensive on the palate, unlike so many macros, and there's a pleasant bitter aftertaste. No hop flavor, but well balanced. I guess that's really what this beer excels at, being balanced. There isn't a lot to taste, but what there is is quite nice and easy to drink."
"Haha. This is beer? Got this one cause nothing else was available (shockingly, this water-brew costs $6 at a cheapo bar in DC). Pours straw. Nose is not there, really, and, for that matter, neither is the taste. One of the blandest beers I've ever tasted, which would really make it highly drinkable. Certainly not objectionable as a drink, although if you're looking for something with flavor, I might go elsewhere."
"Pours a pale fizzy yellow. Smells lightly of grain. Smooth and relatively flavorful Asian macrolager. This would get comparatively high points if imbibing a single Tiger did not already start to give me a mild headache. There's rumors of this and other asian beers using formaline as a fining agent. I don't know if that's true, but the headaches are real. As a result I give it a 1 for drinkability. The flavor is reasonable but I could not drink more than one at a time without risking myself pain."
"D: One of my favorite macros. A definite session beer for hot days."
"D: This is one of those below average beers. It's designed for the mass audience and little more. Not the worst macrobrew I've ever had, but this doesn't make it good."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is okay. It's crisp and might be remotely tolerable on a hot day. But, drinkability is severely limited by its lack of flavor. Overall, it's not a good beer. Can't recommend it."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style pale lager"
"D - Not a bad Asian lager. Like most Asian beers, this is pretty unimpressive, but it's head and shoulders above similar American beers. Would do well with spicy Asian cuisine."
"honestly, you might as well get bud light. there is no wonderful aroma permeating from the open pop top. but as you sip, the tanins unlock and a mild flavor erupts, barley detectable. the coloration is like weak piss. but after a lengthy session with my band members in The Ill Mayhem, we decided to try this sigaporean classic. this was a shock to our ""eastern"" mores. nonetheless we will sample this again int he future"
"D - Not a very good beer. One of very few that will be poured out. Can't even finish 11.2 ounces."
"drinkability is good. this brew has flavor, and accomplishes the task of remaining light in body while staying flavorful and not watered down."
"Not much to say about this beer. Very boring even for a macro lager. But being boring it is not offensive either. A straw colored brew with modest white head that has good retention and lacing. Has a bit of diacetyl in the nose but not in the taste. Lively carbonation and a clean, crisp finish. Easy to drink and it would probably appeal to people who only drink this kind of stuff."
"It looks pretty good, but it is basically a standard american macro lager. It is crisp, pretty refreshing, etc, but in the end is pretty boring and unimpressive. Not worth the purchase."
"Another boring Asian beer. Tried this at my local Chinese restaurant. Pours a yellow color. A head can be forced by no matter goes away to a smooth surface. Not much taste more carbonation than anything. A little bit of hops. Even less taste than our macros. Not worth repeating."
"D - Not bad I suppose, for how inoffensive and bland it is. Overall it is reminiscent of Bud Light with lawn clippings in it. I guess if you want a macro, this probably isn't too bad of a choice."
"pours a very pale gold color, with a small head and little carbonation. opening it i noticed a skunky aroma, very pilsner like, smell is of corn and skunkiness and water, a tiny hop note is barely distinguishable. taste is almost non-existent, mostly just water, it isn't any better than Budweiser really, might actually be worse."
"D - Not bad. Decent macro."
"Pours as is expected. Clear gold with a white head that sticks around and a lot of carbonation. Smells as expected. Slightly bitter and sweet. Flavor is as expected. Slightly bitter tone to a beer that has a mild sweetness to it. Tastes watered down on the end as no significant traits hang around. Feel is standard. Drinkable. Sure. Why bother though. A standard macro. But hey. At least I add another country to my growing list."
"The appearance was average, nothing out of the oridnary, which was true for much of the beer. But, while swirling it around my mouth, it was at its highest point. Overall, a slightly better than average beer with a cool logo."
"D = I suppose if needs be this could be used as a standard bland lager to relax with, but it is really unremarkable so I would not recommend it."
"Drinkability: Better than most lagers available on the Chinese mainland."
"D - Sure, not the most interesting beer by any stretch of the imagination but not horrible either and quite refreshing on a warm summers eve."
"M: A light to medium body brew with a sour aftertaste."
"all that said, i suppose this is drinkable with a spicy thai or malay dish."
"For a macro lager this is pretty damn good, and I think it is very underrated on this site. It is a refreshing lager that is mostly absent of off-flavours, and is more interesting and better quality than almost every other macro I've tried. It's a bit pricey though, as the same money would buy some pretty decent ales from Australian micro breweries that are clearly superior to this beer. Still, I like it for what it is, and would (pretty much) never say no to one."
"Beer poured a mid amber colour with a rather thick creamy head that disappeared quite quickly. It smelled clean and fresh with citrusy notes. I expected this beer to be a lot like the bottom of a canoe (close to water) but it does have some flavour that builds and a slight bitterness to its aftertaste. It is quite light on mouthfeel but very easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Tasty brew. Nice light balance, very refreshing."
"D: Highly drinkable beer, the balance of the body and flavors make it that way"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours a VERY clear slightly amber tint, fizzy white head settles very quickly. Heavy carbonation. Aroma is fairly plain, some light malty notes that give an apple-like smell, but nothing memorable. Tastes is almost nonexistent, some faint, watered down malty sweetness. No hops to speak of. Mouthfeel is very watery with some faint fizzyness on the finish. Drinkability is the one area where this beer shines to me. It's very eazy to drink, and would pair well with some spicy asian food, or in my case, a bowl full of wasabi peas. A very forgettable beer in a sea of amazing ones."
"Drank all six like a lush in one night, could have drank even more, super light and goes down very smooth and easy"
"This beer is a clear straw color with columns of bubbles and a short-lived thin white head. Very little lacing is present. Sweetish malt and light hops aroma. Light-bodied and somewhat crisp with a fairly bland hops and malt flavor. The finish is short and lightly bitter. Indistinguishable from similar beers the world over."
"[Served in a shaker pint.]"
"D - This is a below average beer. It is fairly bland and doesn't bring much in terms of flavor."
"If you like macros, give this a try, it's not bad for what it is. A light macro lager slightly better than BMC."
"I'm scoring this as average, since it is just an average macro lager. Not worse than anything available here, but not any better."
"This beer poured from the bottle a clear straw yellow color. With a bubbly head that wasnt very impressive. It had a sweet aroma but hot a lot of smell to it. The taste was unimpressive. It has an American lager quality with nothing too exciting to say. It is a crisp beer and goes down smooth and refreshing. In all this is a clean refreshing beer. I would rather drink it after a hard day then water but I wouldnt grab it out of my refrigerator over most other beers."
"Thanks to Pegasus for the karma point."
"Cheers!"
"I tried this beer on July 6, 2007 after purchasing it from my local LCBO store. It poured a golden orange colour into the glass with a fluffy white head that dissipated very quickly leaving almost no foam on the top. Lots of effervescence. The aroma was a combination of malts and yeast. The mouthfeel is crisp with a lot of carbonation - dances on the tongue. The taste is slightly bitter with some malty tones. Not a great beer by any stretch."
"A touch above the average generic lager."
"fairly ok on tap; it needs to develop some form of immunity I guess. :)"
"This is basically just a beer to have with food. Works fine with Vietnamese and other south Asian foods (though there are other beers I would prefer). Not recommended for having on it's own."
"D: This might be a good beer to was down some food, but it is not a good stand alone beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"Well it appears Asia has mastered a tasteless macro American lager style beer. It has gotten more rave than it is worth, but I would prefer it over an American, because it has a little bit of flavor. It smells yeasty with no hops at all, yet I detect a slight bit of flavoring hops, and some bittering hops to balance it out well. Not a bad lawnmower beer, but not worth the price (I paid about 8 bucks a six pack). Very clean beer. I would like to try the local version, since the bottle says ""brewed for export"" I'm not sure if they add more hops to make it last longer (like they did with the IPA :), or not, but I expect not based on how it tastes."
"Tiger Lager Beer was a pale golden color with good clarity. It had a bubbly off-white head that was quickly became a very thin layer with no lace. The aroma was sweet and grainy. The taste was a little sweet upfront, light grain, some hop bitterness, and a clean dry finish. It was fairly light bodied bodied with decent carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's pretty much just an average macro lager."
"At the end, a bit heavy."
"I poured this nice beer into a tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a very pale beer with a big wite foamy head that did not hang around long. The beer had a bready yeasty nose to it. The taste was very refreshing, clean and crisp. Not much really exciting but just a good summer thirst quenching beer. I will buy again."
"Drinkability - Hurts. Would not recommend unless you could absolutely find nothing else."
"Don't go out of your way to try it."
"American macrobrews except their TV spots, which are amazing."
"It seems that the distributor(s) in the Central Kentucky area are pushing this beer quite hard. I finally ordered one under the pressure. Gladly, it didn't seem to be a mistake. I thought the beer was as clean tasting as it looked. The brightly colored straw brew with a bleached head retention prevailed with a solid pilsner malt sweetness and low levels of vegial / grain flavors. Spiced with hip bittering a light grassy flavors. Mostly clean in the feel with a mild grain lingering. Overall, decent but my money will be better served on other good Germal Lagers."
"D: Not a terrible rendition of a macro lager, but nothing outstanding either"
"Something just isn't right about this beer. There's using some sort of weird adjunct I'd rather not have anything to do with. I don't think I'm coming back to this one."
"I guess this works great as a premium lawnmower beer. But it doesn't go well with my cheese plate."
"Notes: For the price this is a solid deal. Was perfect for an after work chill out brew on a hot winter day (78)."
"Notes: Loads of this stuff wound up in the MotorCity when the Tigers were hot last season. If they knew how bad this beer sucked, they'd probably change their name."
"I wasn't really expecting much from this to begin with, but I am glad that I tried it. Perhaps when it gets hot out again, I'll get some more of this, or maybe order it with food at the Thai place down the road. Either way, it's about an average Asian copy of the ""yellow-fizzy"" macro-lager."
"This is not my usual type of beer, however it did prove to be very drinkable with a curry."
"There is a bit of sweet aftertaste but it is clean thus bringing me to the conclusion that this beer can be a session beer if the taste were better."
"Drinks pretty easy, nothing too complex here, but rate this upper-echelon a far as this style goes. What's weird is this tastes better than it did in Thailand (just next door) , where it displayed more earthy hops profile-wise"
"This is probably the best imported beer I've had from mainland Asia, though that is not really saying much. This is basically a typical macro lager with one slight exception: sweetness. The lager hits instantly with a slight sugary taste that kind of distract away from the bland taste of the beer itself. It's likely some adjuunct that gives it this taste. Tiger works well in relief from spicy Asian cuisine, so it has that going for it - but not much more."
"This beer has clearly been made as bland as possible for mass distribution. i bought it under the auspice that it was actually a good beer from Singapore. Upon pouring, it looked almost identical and smelled identical to Miller Lite. The taste was not there at all, it just ran through my mouth like smooth flavored water. I expected way more, but ended up being overcharged on a macrobrew import"
"Nice average lager overall, but nothing that stands out in my mind..."
"Not great, but considering it is almost a year past its prime, it wasnt horrible. Id like to see if I can get a fresher sample and try again."
"This beer poured a clear straw color with a big head  well carbonate. The smell is very generic beer like. The taste is crisp and mellow but not exciting. The mouthfeel is thin with a pronounced carbonation bite. Id consider this an average drinking beer suited to be served extremely cold on hot days."
"Another beer that to me did not spark my taste buds. Tasted a lot like a lot of other beers i have tried. i gave it a chance. I have tried beers from Japan that i thought were very good, but singapore didn't get it right with this one. I hope this is not their only beer."
"A drink for hot sunny days, not much call for it in Great Britain, so I shall not be looking out for it, unless we have a heatwave or global warming starts to mess with my town!"
"Served in a pint glass the beer pours a straw yellow color, with about an inch white head. Smells like grain and corn. It tastes like sweet grains and malt, with a small bitter aftertaste. The taste is non-offensive, but it's not great. The mouthfeel is light and watery. With that being said, it does go down pretty smooth and is easy to drink. For a macro lager, it's not too bad at all. Like the BA score for this beer says, it's worth a try."
"This brew pours a clear golden-straw color...a little darker than most other macro lagers. The head is a solid one finger in height, and recedes rather quickly into thin lacing. The aroma is almost nonexistent...there might be some mild sweetness but it is hard to detect. The taste is like the aroma, very weak. The mouthfeel, however, is actually quite nice for the style. It is light bodied, but there is still a bit more to it than your average BMC. Overall, this isn't the worst macro lager I have ever had, but I still would not buy it again."
"May be best with a mouthfull of pepper seafood. Don't drink it on it's own."
"Overall, a disappointing beer with a cool beer cap, fun origami beer holder, and perfect to down while watching the D's Tigues."
"I do enjoy many Asian beers but Tiger did not impress me. It had a flat, overly grassy taste that hardly quenched my thirst. It was not complex what so ever and didn't really pair well with the food that was recommended with it. If picking an Asian beer, go with Kirin Ichiban before this one."
"An Asian American macro lager? Hmm... Interesting. Pours a champagne bubbly gold, with a three finger head that quickly disipates to a thin layer of foam. Cheap grain smell. Nothing that really catches the nose. Reminds me a bit of Cheerios. Tastes light in malts, finishing with a bit of a hoppy bitterness. Grassy aftertaste? Mouthfeel is a bit dry and crisp. Drinkable in the same way soft drinks are drinkable."
"Probably what Singapore deserves"
"Pours a light golden. Lots of bubbles. Not much head, and just a bit of lace. Smell is of weak malts.Body is light and carbonated. Taste is is malty up front,with some hops in the finish. Refreshing, not great tasting, but not offensive. Could be a headach waiting to happen if you have too many!"
"However back in Europe I find this brew rather bland and quite forgetable ... the taste is the same (quite malty for a lager and medium//light in body), but the climate is different ... how to review it then?"
"The first time I ever had a Tiger beer was on an overnight train from Beijing to Inner Mongolia. As a buddy of mine once said ""drinking Tiger is all in the state of mind. It means you're on the prowl"". For me, imported microswill gets no better than cold Tiger beer."
"bought one bottle as part of a make your own sixer (mainly bought it for the cap). clear, yellow, no head. ethanol malt odor. corn, banana-y flavor...improves slightly as it warms. almost tastes belgian, which is weird and unexpected....but its still not a good taste. easy drinkin'."
"Overall, a very forgetful beer. Nothing sticks out that makes it good, but nothing is horrible."
"Pours thin and yellow amber, with a wispy white head. Aroma is malt liquorish, just some metallic sweet malts and a touch of funky hops. Sweet malts start off the palate; lots of corn and rice flavors characteristics. Not terrible, just very, very boring."
"It was quite smooth. Refreshing. A decent alternative to most American macros. While nothing particularly great, it's a decent choice for a hot day. It had a bit of body and a taste that is absent in most American macros. For the style, it's not bad at all."
"Tiger Beer pours a light golden color with a white head from a brown eleven point two ounce bottle. I smell a little malt and that's about it. Malt and grain, adjunct flavors. Really nothing special, nothing too offensive either. I won't likely buy it again, but I wouldn't turn it down. Fairly average."
"This one isn't terrible, would go well with some good Asian food."
"I'm still looking for a good beer to drink with south asian food."
"I guess if you drink it cold enough, on a hot enough day, it's drinkable."
"Overall, this beer is average and unimpressive."
"First sip isn't as bad as I expected, a little too sweet for my taste, but not as cheap tasting as a lot of Asian lagers tend to be. There is a slight lemony tartness that tends to hit the tongue as it warms, and a faint roasted character. Alcohol is present as well. Mouthfeel is very dry and bites the tongue well. This would pair very well with Asian food and is one of the better Asian lagers I've tried, it's still a bit too sweet for me though..."
"Not bad, really. It would never beat something like Sam Smith's Organic Lager, or Rogue's Uber Pils. But it's a good lawnmower beer that's better than the macros."
"The mouth was a bit on the thin side, but the very active carbonation helped. While not offensive, this beer does not have much to recommend it. It did go fairly well with the sushi, but was bit overwhelmed by the spicier rolls."
"Pale golden color with a larger but thin bright white head. Head dissipates rather quickly but leaves a nice ring of lacing. Aroma is mostly malty with a cereal adjunct note being dominant. There's also an herbal edge in there which seems to cut the aroma short. It's all a bit weak really. Taste isn't quite as weak but still fairly flavorless. Once again the sweeter malts come out and they are definitely adjunct derived. Tastes cereal like to me. A bit of grassyness is there and dries out in the finish which is quite crisp and thirst quenching really. For that, the beer accomplishes what I wanted it to and the mouthfeel gets some good points. The rest of the beer is average at best."
"I actually, much to my surprise, found this quite nice and easilly drinkable."
"On the can it says to serve this cold (4-6C/40-43F) and I might not have this as cold as that. I would guess that if you drank it that cold that alot of the flavours and aromas would die down (perhaps and hopefully the chemical dry finish) and actually make this beer taste a bit better, but it probably wouldn't smell as good. Not a terrific beer, but average to better than average for a macro lager."
"It's a reasonably drinkable beer, and better than many Asian lagers I've tried."
"Overall, this beer is okay. Kind of watered down but not bad in it's own way. Good for washing down spicy foods."
"Refreshing enough with the meal...I'm glad the unagi was good."
"Drinkability isn't too bad. I was happy to get to try this out at Wolfgang Puck's in Lake Buena Vista, FL."
"I love the bottlecap that I managed to remove without so much as a scratch or dent. It's the same tiger under a palm tree that is seen on the main label and the neck label. That's pretty much it for the high points. Having said that, one could do much worse. The fact that I could down 3-4 cold bottles of Tiger Beer with a minimal amount of complaining should count for something."
"Don't reccommend it if you are not on holiday in asia."
"Not a pleasant experience  cant believe this brew is still in production. Clear lemon yellow pour, quick vanishing white head. Aroma of veggies and some euro skunk. Musty quaff, maybe some hints of bread  an earthy finish that left me wanting a water to help wash out the taste. Was a free gift, drank the whole 500ml, of course."
"Overall = If you're a fan of the big macro companies, give this one a try. It's a definitely improvement although not much of one. I'd never go back to it unless it was the only brand of beer available in the county."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing; nice retention. The aroma is average. It has a light and dry pale malt scent that is a bit husky and devoid of any real malt aroma. The taste is below average. It has absolutely no malt character at all along with no hop flavor or finish. It tastes like the second runnings of a light lager. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a not a very good beer. I guess it would be good on a hot day or with spicey food, but otherwise it's one and done for me."
"A half decent lager, an easy pick when you want a weak flavored beer to wash down extra spicy Pan-Asian cuisine."
"This beer pours a nice straw color with a white fluffy head. Looks very good. There's very little aroma, but what is there is a little yeasty, a little hoppy, not too bad. Taste/mouthfeel is very nice, it's very creamy, a little yeasty, pretty sweet with a clean finish. All around, it's a very drinkable beer, I'll be getting more of this."
"I wouldn't go back to this one... heck, I even like some macro swill more than this one."
"Tiger pours a crystal-clear straw-gold body beneath a bright white head that holds very well but leaves no lace. The nose is basic, but there are some floral, grassy, and spicy hops present. It's crisp in the mouth with a standard carbonation and light-medium body. The flavor delivers a well-balanced combination of sweetish adjunct-laden malt, a solid bitterness, and spicy hops that linger shortly in the dry aftertaste. A basic, but nicely hopped golden lager."
"The smell is faint, but at least it's not turning me away. The taste is of bland malts with a moderate pepper flavor. The mouthfeel is pretty thin. It isn't very appealing, but there are worse."
"Aroma was non-existant. The flavor was of mild malt, grass, and only a hint of bitterness. Very bland and boring for the tastebuds. Smooth and lightly crisp at the start, with a clean finish. Drinkability is very average due to bland flavor but for the upcoming spicey food I'll be eating, I won't be able to taste it anyway."
"From tap. Poured very light gold with about a finger of artificial looking head which disappeared pretty quick. Aroma - what aroma? My senses could have been a little attenuated as I was following the ABC Extra Stout, but all I could detect was a faint hint of vomit. Taste - what taste? Best that can be said is that it was not offensive. Someone has obviously beaten this tiger with a VERY large stick and turned it into a pussy cat. Palate was watery and weak. The ONE redeeming factor is that it goes down very easily in the tropical heat. This is nothing like the beer I remember 15 years ago."
"Since the can is old, I can say for sure, how much it changed its caracteristics. According to me, it seems to be another average macro. Also, the others reviews leads me to believe this is another instable brand. It seems to lack some standards. Sometime I would be ok, sometime not. That's about it."
"Bottled: Pour reveals a standard pale gold clear mega lager with a bubbly white cap ...minimal retention and lacing. Fizzy. Reasonable aroma...some garins and grassy hops over a light fruit tone. Light bosy easily drinkable, fair balance between sweet malts and hops dry clean finish...this is a premium mega lager taste."
"Pours a dark gold color. The smell is pleasant like many fruits with a refreshing undertone. The initial taste is like a white wine, with a hint of alcohol and fruits, although its not till the beer is swallowed that you get the true flavor. It seems to coat your throat with the same wine-y acidic taste that lingers on the back of your tongue until you take another sip. The otherwise blandness in the flavor is probably due to the fact that it is made for spicy Asian food, when you would want to have something that quells the heat."
"Overall this is a pretty good lager (the main flaw being its bland appearance). It was great with my Chinese food from the Mandarin."
"11.2 oz. bottle. Pours a clear straw pils color with a fluffy, retaining white head. Cereal grainy malt nose with some grassy, flowery hops near the end, kind of skunky. Neutral grain taste with a little bit of bitterness in the finish. Rice is a little cleaner tasting adjunct compared to corn. Seems like it'd pair up nicely with spicy food."
"Crisp, with faint hops and bitterness. Mild lagery taste with some DMS. Faint bitterness left on the tongue."
"A mediocre lager brought in by LCBO. Watery, no taste and some floral smell. Sweet malt and corn sweetness. Dry very bitter and metallic aftertaste. Pale yellow. Carbonation. A lot of soapy foam that gives some creamyness to water. Herbal and clean and plain."
"Taste is grassy, watery and oddly sweet. Probably the corn I am tasting. Not much here at all and not very pleasant. Thin mouth. Not that drinkable. Will take the sting out of spicy Thai food. There I said something nice."
"A clean light yellow beer with a small white heat. The aroma is slightly sweet and grainy witha hint of citrus. The taste has a light hint of sweetness over the tongue with an even lighter dry hop finish. I guess this might be refreshing in the sweltering heat, but so would a glass of water. Definitely no improvment over the usual macro swill."
"Had a big display with free samples at liquor store, special price $10.95 for 6 pack of 330ml bottles and you got a free Tiger Beer mug - can't go wrong I thought. Light gold in color, more towards yellow out of the bottle. Poured with white foamy head that quickly fades to nothing. Slight smell of grain, but very little aroma. Thin, watery taste, ever so slight hopiness. After a while, carbonation pretty much gone and taste fades to nothingness. No aftertaste at all (good or bad). On its own a bland brew, but would probably be a very nice compliment to a spicy asian meal. Will try with food next time."
"Reflection: Why import this, when there are plenty of terrible american lagers around?"
"Pours a clear light gold under a two finger white head with a bit of contour but minimal staying power and zero lace. Almost no nose at all - just a touch of sweet malt. The mouth is light and very prickly. Standard, basic, normal macro swill. There's nothing offensive here (except for the fact that I know beer can taste so much better). There's some malt in the opening, bland and watery. There is no hops follow-up, leaving a musty, wet socks kind of aftertaste. Lord knows I drank enough of this kind of stuff before Sam Adams changed my world. No need to go back to this now. The label claims a ""distinctive taste that is winning the world over."" Distinctive? I beg to differ."
"11.2 ouncer with no freshness dating. Pours pissy yellow, light and clear. White head. Cabadgy/bready/grassy nose. Light bodied. Medium carbonation. Macro tasting (Corn/rice in the mix) Slight grainy hop note late. Typical macro lager, you can do better then this swill."
"Pale gold color, nothing out of the ordinary. Head dies unpleasantly quick. I was sad. Smell seemed lightly sweet as I dug my nose into the glass. Some faint hops also--but really almost nothing detectable. Taste is similarly light and sweet and not so interesting. A smooth, creamy rush of soft bubbles through the mouth makes this beer drinkable and mildly unique. I don't think I'd buy it again though."
"No reason to drink this one."
"Pours a pale yellow with a quick to fade white burst of a head. The aroma is too faint for me to really care to bother describing it. The flavor has a little bit of malt to it, but more of this vegetal/corn thing that was really giving me a bit of trouble toward the end of the glass. You've got to keep this one ice cold or it's nearly undrinkable."
"Incredibly light Lager. Not a head to be seen, but there is quite a bit of carbonation. Skunky as all hell in the aroma department. I also wasn't overly impressed with the taste. I don't recomend this to anyone. I would give this to someone I don't like that much."
"Not bad if your looking for a simple workhorse lager, but still, nothin special"
"Overall, A watery cheap beer that you should not waste your money on. Although the bottle cap is kinda cool!"
"Appearance: Golden and fizzy that's about it, thin short lived head just poor looking brew. Aroma: Wretchedness as my lovely girlfriend, Carrie put it so eloquently. Smells worse than Old E' grainy malt liquor like approach no hopes bland, blah. Taste: Tolerable only because of it's lack of flavor, there is also a distinct offness ridden with rice as it's evil adjunct of choice. Mouthfeel: Thin bodied watery who cares about carbonation. Drinkability: Wow, I can't believe they export this shit who else in the world would send this shitty beer, I'll tell you the same one that beats their citizens with rods."
"nothing spectacular, but tigers' still a nice, if a little expensive, quaffer. great when its hot, and alongside stir fry noodles or curries. worth a go every so often"
"The color of this beer is light, clear gold with an undistinguished head. There is some grainy aroma. The light grainy taste has a little hop bite to it. It does have good carbonation, although the mouthfeel was watery. The finish is slightly sweet and dry. There is not too much going on here. This beer doesn't taste or smell awful and probably is a thirst-quenching hot climate beer but, I didn't care too much for it. The best things about it were the label and the bottle cap."
"Nothing remarkable happening here. If I were blindfolded I would be hard pressed to differentiate Singapore's Tiger beer from Japanese and Korean beers."
"Overall, this rates as probably my favorite Asian beer, easily beating out others like Singha and San Miguel. This brew has a fuller, more rounded and balanced profile than most Asian lagers. It also brings back some pretty fine memories of good times in Singapore."
"slighty malty aroma with maybe a hint of corn or some other adjunct(not exactly sure though). somewhat thin watery mouthfeel followed by a little hoppy bitterness and some co2 to balance off the malt make this a very refreshing lager."
"As an import it costs a lot more than the average local stuff. Pass!"
"Drinkability: Ranks right up there with most domestic macro lagers. Bland, pretty boring and straightforward. Thank goodness this was a gift."
"Give me an Asahi over it though..."
"Light gold color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is grainy and swet. A light bodied lager style beer. Light and crisp taste, malty and fairly hoppy. Mild flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Fairly standard lager"
"My advice (for what its worth): keep a few in the beer frig for your friends who are still exploring the world of beer and for yourself for a good breakfast beer."
"Flavor is light, yet fairly rich and mildly hoppy. A little plain and bland. The hops are actually very nice, providing a spicy finish. The malting isn't perfect, kind of muddy, with a light corny taste. Not super crisp, but the finish is very good. Reminds me of Heineken or Becks. Well carbonated, light body. A decent pilsener or american style lager, but plain. It beats Bud, but nothing to write home about."
"The flavor is crisp and malty. There's a dry aftertaste that leaves a clean feeling in the mouth."
"Pours a clear golden straw color with a fluffy white head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is sweet malt and bitter grain husks. Light to medium in body and quite crisp. Taste is sweet malt with some grassy notes followed by some spicy alcohol. This is a good quencher and would make a great lawn mowing beer. One of the best Asian brews Ive tried. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"sparkling gold body no head. Light malt aroma. Light pleasant hops (light, light, light). Ingredients malts, hops, grains, abv 5. I can taste no adjuncts, so i imagine the malt content to be high. Marvelous extra-light beer (if that is not a contradiction in terms). This was a great beer for the tpo."
"My favorite beer from Asia, it's lost its charm over the years, but I still come back to it from time to time, especially when eating out Thai or Vietnamese food. This one came in a big 640ml brown bottle with gold foil around the neck and cap. A clear golden colour, it pours out with a sizable white head, which sinks to about a dime's width after a short while. Can't pick up any discernable nose at all, but the taste is sweet and light, and not as dry as one would initially expect. It goes down easy, and is great partnered up with spicy Asian food, or just really hot weather."
"The taste was excellent, full bodied with a hint of spice. Tiger has a nice malt sweet nice that balances the spice and a very smooth even finish. I would rank this by far the best Pacific-Rim beer and put it against any lager around the world."
"I think it would go well with the right dish, maybe a pasta or a salad."
"Compared to say Heineken this is better..It's not a spectaculr beer but for its style it is very good and worth trying if you see it.."
"The beer pours a translucent gold color with a head that barely there, the color white and the texture frothy with some scraps of lace. Nose is all malt, sweet as is the start, the malt profile sparing, and the top cadaverous in feel. Finish is spitefully acidic with the hops meek and mild to the palate, quite dry aftertaste, and it truly does live up to its name of Tiger Piss, but it was better than the American Macros we received in Viet Nam, laced with Formaldehyde!"
"Had this at a Thai restaurant in my neighbourhood. Posters on the wall proclaiming it's gold medal at the Brewing Industry Awards or some such in London '99. I'm not really all that impressed. Virtually no head, undistinguished aroma and flavour. It's not bad, but it's barely better than a Labatt or Molson, if at all. Good thing I didn't go for the Thai beer though - Singha - turns out to be a malt liquor."
"I found this Tiger lager a disappointment.....Very little head, and what there was quickly disapaited...there is no sparkle to this product and certainly no fizz....Nice colour, full bodied...but flat, as if it had been poured the night before..How sad!"
"An average beer. Medium straw in color with slight head and no lace.  Slightly sweet cooked veggie taste with slight hop aftertaste.  Goes down smoothly but lacks more character.  A little too fizzy."
"Quite a light lager, but mananges to maintain an Ok rounded flavour. Good when the weathre shot, gos down smooth."
"A super light pilsener beer. Bland and inocuous, yellow and fizzy. No real flavor to speak of other than some rice adjuncts. Popular in Asia as many similar beers are. This one is about the lightest one I've tried on this trip to China. Skip over this one and try something else."
