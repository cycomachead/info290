"rated from previous tasting notes"
"It's alright. A good choice if your choices are few. A good cheap beer. Nothing more."
""
"Best beer in America in Canada"
"Very easy drinking and quality for the style."
""
"I used to live this stuff a long time ago but aroma is of corn and virtually no flavor. Not bad on a hot day after working outside and perhaps slightly better than other adjunct lagers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Better than Budweiser. And every time I partake in drinking this fine Canadian offering,I have a yearning to watch ""Slapshot"".  What's not to like about this beer?"
""
"Good when fishing...an all day beer!"
""
""
"Tastes great anytime, fishing beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much to say. Just a beer. Canadas Budweiser. Drink 9 of them and play only slap shots on a pond."
""
""
""
""
"when i'm not in the mood to make my stomach feel bloated but want a beer, this is a solid go-to. just wish it was more available in the states since it's miles ahead of any macro we have."
""
""
""
"Super tasty easy to drink"
""
""
""
""

"Not a bad tasting can of beer, a bit too carbonated for me"
"Great Canadian beer. Good choice in a hockey household!"
"Standard fair bland lager...great when it's very hot when u are at the beach..light crisp goes flat quickly not as bad as most mass produced soulless beer"
"decent macro-swill for when you just want something simple and refreshing without a tidal wave of caustic hop bitterness."
""
""
""
"Very watery taste and feel. Only Bud Light is worse"
""
""
"Simple...not complicated...and not Budweiser"
"Compared to other AAL's, this isn't horrible.  Little sweet with a kick of carbonated water on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Softly drunk, strong enough, amazing taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Stadium beer. Personally I'll take it over Budweiser, Coors, or Miller any day."
""
"Clean tasty Canadian Lager as similar to American Lagers in its own way. Hard to tell  from Labatts  or Moosehead. Very malty with no detectable  hop flavor. I guess you would cal it well balanced but a beer like Samuel Adams Boston Lager is much bolder and has a good deal more flavor. Recommended for Bud or Miller drinkers in search of slightly more flavor. No bad attributes just a bit average."
""
""
""
""
"I am neutral on this beer."

"But this just drinks like bready vodka. Molson Canadian is our national shame. I've always been found of saying that 'no beer is perfect in every occasion, but every beer is perfect for some occasion' and Molson Canadian is suitable to only the most desperate, last-ditch circumstances. This regrettable lager is criminally overvalued. Those that drink this live sad lives indeed..."

"This is one of the better macro lagers. It is crisp, but is limited on taste but at least there is a hint of taste unlike other mass produced beer.  For those with allergies to some of the preservatives commonly found in macro beers....this beer has no preservatives.   This beer is best to drink while watching hockey. I have no idea why this is the case, it just is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is very crisp, very clean in its feel and flavor and actually tops Molson Canadian, despite it being an adjunct. The adjuncts are not obvious and flavor tends to a more Pilsner malt. The corn seems absent, the rice more for smoothness. The flavor is crackery malt with and easy dry crispness."
""
""
"Pours clear, light golden color. A thin, course head that dissipates completely in a matter of seconds. No lacing. A sweet aroma and citrusy flavor. Clean finish, almost no aftertaste. A very refreshing brew, even though it lacks character."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A poor beer. It is drinkable if you get it really cold, but if it heats up at all I toss it. Way too much corn and rice, but the real kicker is the astringent flavour that is always present."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.68) : If I lived in Canada and I had no alternative lager like Rolling Rock, Old Style, Hauenstein, or Coors, I'd grab this in a heartbeat. It competes well with all of those brands which are my favorite lagers. It's flavorful, sweet, toasty, and has a bit of hop character. Not ashamed to drink this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite macro brew"
""
"Very nice lager with a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. One of the better mass produced lagers of North America."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm surprised that Molson Canadian gets such bad scores on BA. Compared to Budweiser I'd have it every day, not that Bud is bad (they're both solid beers) but I prefer the Molson as it's got a little more bite to it. I find Molson Golden a little bit below average because it's kind of dull all around, but Molson Canadian has a nice malt to it, some decent herbal and grassy hops, albeit it limited, and a nice balance of crisp carbonation and firm bitterness. It's always clean, and it's refreshing."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So overall would I recommend it ? NO. If you wanna drink Molson go crab Coors Light or Molson Export but not this one. If you choosing between a Budweiser or a Molson Canadian go get a Budweiser. Overall I am disapointed about that beer still have 19 cans to finish. Damn it's gonna be hard"

"Overall - Honestly it is what it is. It doesn't taste great but it'll get you there. I call this and beers like it 45's after the old Colt 45 slogan ""Works every time"". It has a high enough ABV and is cheap enough that it will do its job without tasting like Keystone or god forbid Natural Light. So it's good for what it is, but if you actually want to drink beer for beers sake it really isn't worth it."

"Bottle sampled at an Edmonton Alberta restaurant. One of those ""get around to it eventually"" ticks/reviews and now is eventually. Obviously a top seller across this country although never as big as a few other brands in my neck of the woods, this probably does not deserve to be the standard-bearer for John Molson's rich brewing legacy but nevertheless does manage to deliver more flavor than many of its contemporaries in macro-lager land. Thin and super fizzy as expected but does have an almost buttery rounded grain sweetness that comes off better than in many other takes on this style, less DMS (albeit this is still present), and even a very faint fruitiness that recalls apple and grape hard candy. Dryish metallic grainy finish. You have to focus to taste much but what's there is less rancid than expected. Workmanlike lawn mower beer and has a place at pizza parties post-moving. Not recommended for tasting except as an example of a decent Canadian macro-brew for comparison purposes."

"3.5/5, would drink again"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I am shocked and astonished by how much I'm enjoying this beer. It's actually a decent quaff on its own, but for the style it's quite good indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I skipped the drinking because “wooo beer” phase and went straight to the drinking because “oh that looks interesting / damn that's tasty” phase, so I don't have much experience with beer of this sort. Clearly, I didn't miss out on much though, this is not something I would ever choose to drink. It's not horrible or anything, just very boring."

""
""
"Overall: I find nothing offensive with this brew, but nothing exciting either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion:, It's your typical North American Marco larger. Not the best, but not a drain pour either. I would drink it again."

"O - One of the best mid-priced beers. It's becoming one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
"If you do make the unfortunate mistake of drinking this because your friend from Alaska swears by it, do yourself a favor and let it warm up a little bit. This actually improves this bottled dog vomit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth, easy drinking, fermented corn juice. There is too much corn adjunct in this beer. Not that pleasant to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a better adjunct lager than many others out there, not overcarbonated which plays well with its flavor and drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer that would pair well with picnic type foods in summer. Going fishing? Canoeing? Potato salad, hamburgers hot dogs and salty sandwiches like pastrami and ham would all fare well alongside this lightly sweet beer."
""
""
"This beer on tap, served sub zero is actually rather refreshing and enjoyable but still nothing to rave about. Mild hoppy taste that is grainy with a sweet aftertaste but it is more watery than anything else. A good beer to get on draft and to session with. The more you drink this the more tolerable it is. A good beer to have while at the bar eating wings and spending the night splitting a pitcher with friends. A perfect example of how marketing can sell a beer, despite what the commercials say, enjoying this beer does not make you Canadian."
"O- This beer is nothing to phone home about but I do have to say that it is well worth the price that I paid for it. When comparing Molson to other beers of the style, it is definitely centrefield in my mind. If you are in the mood for a refreshing lager or a satisfying ""lawnmower"" beer, I recommend that you give Molson Canadian a try. If you happen to pay $20.99 plus tax for a 20 pack like I did, all the better! Cheers Bros."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it is a good beer for a cold Minnesota day."
""
""
"A so-so macro style lager, a notch better than our US counterparts like Bud and Miller. Probably closest to Coors, but less corn in the flavor which is a plus. Overall, not especially good, put pairs with food well enough and you can ignore it at least."
"Ok this is my go-to beer...even when I worked in the head-office of arch-enemy Labatt's...nothing to blow you away just one of the worlds very best Macrobrew lagers. I drink my beer lukewarm which is the real test of flavour. Canadian doesn't ever disappoint. It is THE exemplar of generic Canadian beer. Hoppier and punchier than any American offering but not bitter like a European brew. It's a crowd pleaser...not one to blow the socks off of an afficianado. But really if you are out in North America it is a safe call for a decent beer that is readily commercially available. Funny enough it is actually a premium brand in Canada with a premium pricetag. American beer is cheap as dirt here with a flavour to match. I still don't mind paying a little bit more for quality. Simple fact is there isn't much of a nose to any Canadian beer, I mean really if your wife has complained about how you smell so much like beer that she wants some then she is a special lady. Canadian beer has a certain standard amount of malty sweetness that is uncharacteristic of other beers worldwide, but it really adds to the drinkability factor. I am just more of a mass-appeal beer drinker than a niche-market microbrew kinda guy. But for the most part I notice that my everyday beers are still rated ""good for a macro brew"" by even the educated drinkers amongst us. I drink Canadian warm for christsake and would still reccommend it to anyone who will listen. I have had beers from all over the civilized world, it's comes down to personal taste. I personally like Canadian, Belgian, and Danish beer, in that order. That is just me though..."

"Overall - I'd have to say I'm impressed with the quality of this beer now. Of course, I will need to continue to purchase one every so often to make sure the quality remains consistent. Only then will I be convinced. If you haven't tried one in a while, I recommend giving it another chance. Molson seems to have stepped up their game with this one and you may be pleasantly surprised as well."

"DATE TASTED: November 30, 2013... GLASSWARE: standard pilsner...OCCASION: Cavs take on the Rose-less Bulls-suddenly, a fair fight... APPEARANCE: surprise--golden!--with a thin, off-white head that offers few bubbles; no lacing of significance... AROMA: tinny, bready and rather nondescript... PALATE: thin, drinkable and unfilling--a bit gassy but also a tad more substantial than the standard adjunct...TASTE: beefy in the aftertaste; the 40 oz. malts underpin a drinkable, thin lager--not much else to profile...OVERALL: rather drinking this than other Coors products is not high praise, but as a Turkey-day offering beyond the standard lights, Molson held interest and please a few guests with its presence; overall, a slightly more substantial mouth rinser..."

"One of my top beers in the style. Clean, not offensive, bready/cereal sweetness, easy drinking."
"It's a Molson!! One of the best commercial beers in my unwanted opinion!! In the top 5 commercial / mainstream beers out there..This is a everyday drinker..Great beer for a mass produced brew dontcha know eh! The best part about this beer is it makes you wish it was hockey season!!"

"Molson. I've had a million of these. Funny, in US this seems to be the most popular variant, while in Canada i feel Molson Export or even Molson Dry is the big money maker in recent years at least. At any rate this is a solid and pretty well selling beer anywhere in North America. Pours a solid golden color, smell is pretty unobtrusive if not entirely mindblowing. Tastes very crisp, with a kind of sweet finish rather than the dry stickiness I find with budweiser and its ilk. Not the best beer in the world, in regards to the style I prefer Sleeman's, but now that I no longer live in Canada I'll take what I can get. The definitive ""B+"" brew, Molson is a damn fine beer year round."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the few beers (I've had draft, bottled, and canned) that is best canned. It's a great summer beer if you're looking to throw back with old friends and get wasted (lol). Cheap price, but decent brew. It is almost sweet. Lots of flavor and a bit of an aftertaste. All in all a beer I recommend."

"O: I've had FAR worse macro lagers than this. And I've even had worse craft beers than this, too. This is perfectly okay, if not exactly good. I can now see where some of you Canadians are coming from - this blows our BMC out of the water. Hell, I'd even drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like just about all American adjunct lagers, Molson Canadian failed to blow me away. For the style, however, this beer was pretty solid."

"Overall - very surprised with the very low carbonation, it's not a good beer, but it does it's job well, quenching your thirst that is. Inoffensive and better than others in the style, but really just non- descript."

"Overall: Good fishing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"But the beer itself is okay - it`s got a lot of corny taste but some nice wheat notes as well. The flavour is pretty potent for a beer of its type, but not terribly offensive either. At the end of the day, this is the typical swill that Canadians who are not desparate enough to buy Lucky Lager will get - if it`s on sale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheap beer."
"Purchased at: Mejiers in Canton, MI"
"O-it doesn't taste bad. It's just completely boring. It is very drinkable of course. Yuengling would've been the better choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In addition to my overall rating of this beer being very poor, cheap and low quality I also want to make mention that after drinking this Molson product it is also appears that it is loaded with preservatives. Again, another reason why I choose to avoid low quality products such as this. A very disappointing experience all in all, and has reinforced why I generally avoid mass produced Canadian beer products."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If what your looking for in a beer is very simple with the main characteristics of cold, crisp and refreshing, then this beer is for you. This beer is served best on tap, in Canada, it really brings it all together. This beer does not have many specialties, it is just you common beer."
"If you are looking for a simple cold, crisp, refreshing beer than this is the beer for you. Please try this beer on tap and in the country where it is brewed. There is something about drinking the beer in Canada that makes it that much better. This is the beer to grab when you do not want to mess around with too many frills."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Although this beer isn't that flavorful, it's definitely very easy to drink and goes down easily."
""
""
"Overall: This beer is not bad but it is not great. I prefer this one over many others of the AAL variety. I am a sucker for this beer during hockey season... makes the hockey-watching experience feel complete. It's nothing to go out of your way to get but it's not the worst investment."
""
""
"O: Horrible drinkability. Standard mass production Adjunct Lager. Don't drink it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There was a time decades ago where I rather liked Molson, but then, there weren't many other choices for “exotic” beers then. I guess I haven't really missed anything in through the intervening years. Rather subpar, even for an adjunct lager. This would do in a pinch, but would rather scope out a Budweiser or Strohs beer if this were the style I had to drink."

"O - Very enjoyable tasting. This is a nice example of a drinking or session beer. This beer has more of a flavor profile than BMC and should be sought out if you need an enjoyable session beer. Keep in mind what style of beer this is when you try it and you will not be disappointed"
""
""
"Is a crystal clear light straw color. Thin snow white head that huddles around inside of the rim. Aroma is cooked vegetable like and buttery. A lightly sweet floral taste is what I experienced foremost. Everything is very light. Not much bitterness to speak of. Has a light tingly feel with a dry finish. Not special, but much better than alot of offerings from this category. Would be a good option poolside in the summer."
""
""
"O Canada...and so on and so forth... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mild wheat and a tiny bit of sweet biscuit. The taste brings in more of the same, with the sweetness really taking control of the proceedings. A light bit of macro funk spews forth every now and again to remind you of who made this stuff. (I wanna know what they do/use to create that character...) The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a fairly meek little beer, but one of the better, more tolerable adjunct lagers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- For an adjunct this is not one I would likely go for. It is drinkable, but not anything I would like to drink on any occasion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well, it's not a very good beer. I was surprised to find no hints of skunk though. Probably due to the can."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I can't really get into specifics about the smell and taste, because it really is your typical adjunct fare. Rather than being corn dominant though, I feel like there's some actual malt in Molson. There's nothing special about it all, per se, but it's a respectable, cheap adjunct that I'd take any day (especially at the same price as Budweiser and such) over some others of the style. As I've already said several times..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'll finish it, but that funkiness is definitely a problem."
""
""
"I was in Owen Sound Canada a few years back and I had several Molson Canadian's which I thought were outstanding. I thought I would buy a case down here in the states and the beer purchased in the states is nothing like the Molson Canadian in Canada. It's not even close. The case of beer that I bought just a week ago had a promo called ""Only one is Worthy of the Cup"" and when I tried to register it said the contest expired in June of 2012 which means the beer is almost six months old, maybe older It's very weak and watery and tastes like a light beer."
""
"That's why Canadian is getting a 5 star review from me. It's the best of what it is. If you don't even want to consider that, then go listen to Bon Iver and leave me alone."
"The beer tastes like grain, corn at first, rice later; I suspect are adjunct ingredients of the beer. It does have a touch of a metallic feel but overall, it is a better than average commercial lager with good taste, lively carbonation and a nice crisp mouth feel. This beer is obviously not, a delicacy, it’s a session beer that is best consumed at a cold temperature and while wearing a concert shirt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of slight hops, slight sweet malt, pale malt, adjuncts, and a hint of caramel malt. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of adjunct, pale malt, slight hops, and slight sweet malt. Overall, an average adjunct lager with a decent appearance."

"I've had many beers.... Both lagers and ales.... From porters, dunkels, stouts, tripels, l sorts of lagers, and much more.... Not a big fan of many lagers.... Mostly an ale guy.... Prefer ""nourishing"" beers over ""quenching"" beers.... I like top-fermenting brews more so than bottom-fermenting brews.... To me, this lager is not too much of my liking.... It doesn't have much of a taste to it.... Yes, it's crisp, clean, and refreshing.... It just doesn't have much to it."
"O - I don't know what it is about this beer exactly, but there's something about it that just seems higher-quality than others it's related to. Nothing spectacular, but if you just want something you can take in quantity to a get-together or a night of hockey-watching that's a little better than average but not too expensive, this is it. Better than the sum of its parts."

"It was fitting then that me & CANAD (\CAN-ad\) should get reacquainted at an open air Iron Maiden concert a few weeks back (Molson Ampitheatre, Torona, Ontario). RUN TO THE HILLS! There wasn’t much choice in the matter. Serving Type: draft in a very large plastic cup not unlike a Big Gulp. Smell: didn’t. Taste: soapy astringent suds, unclean lines and not as cold as it ought to have been. Mouthfeel: didn’t let it linger to get the feel. Understand I was not expecting so much, but it oozed under the bar somehow. I did finish it however."
"O: Not too bad. I would take over a BMC, but not over a Yuengling."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it is actually a decent beer. Actually ""not bad"" would be a better descriptor. It is certainly a drinkable session beer but for that price you can easily get a much better alternative. Its drawbacks are the syrupy taste and off-putting aftertaste. The amazing thing about this beer is that it tastes the same cold as it does warm."
""
""
"Today...this beer poured very well,had a very clean,blonde appearance and a good effervescence energy. Consequently the odor too was very fresh,and the taste did not disappoint. A sweet malty bready flavor and yet not heavy or skunky after taste. I enjoyed this beer very much, really cooled off a hot afternoon by the pool.I would recommned anytime and anywhere,however."

"Molson Canadian. The flagship beer of corporate Canada. Only sampled when choices are limited. A pale lager with very little distinction. Pours well and looks appealing, but leaves much to be desired. Often is accompanied with a borderline unpleasant lingering on the palate. Tastes much better when you have the distinct pleasure of buying them at $8 a piece in plastic cups at hockey games..."
""
""
"Poured from a can into a lager glass. Pours a medium golden color, With very little head and lots of bubbles continuing to rise to the top even well into drinking the beer. Leaves trace amounts of lacing. Pretty average for the style. Smells strongly of wet bread with some rice grains and nothing else. Once again, average of the style. The taste is filled with stale bread and skunkiness, Perhaps SLIGHTLY better than your average AAL, But not by much. The mouthfeel follows the taste, But with tons of carbonation and a very dry finish"

"Good for thirst, not that great for taste. Too much soda character."
""
""
""
"Pours a very pale yellow color with a white foamy head that goes away rather quickly. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aroma is macro grain, possibly corn and minimal malt. Taste is much of the same with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very thin. Overall it is not a horrible macro beer and better than the ones south of the border."

"When I think back to what kick-started my interest in craft beer, Molson Canadian is one of three beers that comes to my mind. I will save these for my 400th and 500th review. Anyway, when I first had Molson Canadian, it was remarkably better than the crap I had tasted up to that point. Honestly, it's not that great, and it isn't as good as Narragansett Lager, but it is worth a try."

"This is a decent, sessionable lager. It's not overly flavorful but it's not offensive in any way either. It's clean and refreshing. I would have this again."
""

""

"Overall, a good beer to drink while watching the grill. Very, very drinkable. This is not a Beer Advocate's dream, but on a comparative basis to other adjunct lagers, this one tastes good and goes down smooth."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Simply an average, nothing special AAL. BBQ beer, as I like to call it. Crisp and refreshing, easy to drink, yet pretty tasteless."
""
"Ah the pride of Canada (right?). Pours golden copper with small white head. Aroma is light sweet malt, a little biscuit and corn. Flavor follows with light sweetness, a bit of biscuit, and some light hops and hay to go along. Mouthfeel is light and a little dirty on the finish, with adequate to medium-high carbonation. Better than Bud Light I guess."

"stadium beer. pours a corn color with a small white head that turns to nothing. smells like a frat house, better than a budlight, but not by much. this beer is at every sports event there is, and it can be decent after a hockey game, but its just another mass produced lager. taste isnt bad, doesnt taste like the container it was served from, which is a plus. light feel, good carbonation. makes this an easy drinker, especialy when its cold. better than the other beers in its price range, i cant hate this too bad, but at the end of the day these are all the same. not sure why its my old man's go to, but it still is. nothing distinct, no hop presence dectable, and very approachable. whatever kind of drink for me."
""

""
""
""
""
"O: If you're looking for a beer to have an appreciation for, this isn't it. If you're looking for a cheap session beer that you can slam down a 12-pack of and get buzzed up, given it's above average ABV (for the style), this would be a decent pick for that purpose."

"first canadian lager for me. $5~7 for a six pack can hardly compete with similar tasting beers. definitely could drink higher quantities of this stuff"
""
""
"Molson Canadian is like most typical North American beers. It pours a golden clear with initial big head that dissapates quickly. The smell and taste are mostly grain. Mouthfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer that is drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very light and refreshing. Has a distinct sweetness about it. Dry and especially crisp. A bit watery but after a long hot day working outside in the heat in Florida it goes down smooth. Hey i need to put down this crap i'm drinking and go and get a box of this stuff."
""
""
"Overall, I am a little disappointed. Not because of how it tastes or smells, but because of it's Lack of taste and smell. It reminds me almost exactly of Michelob Ultra. And this isn't even a light beer. For imported adjunct lagers, I'd rather go with Foster's. This is too much like light beer. I sort of feel cheated."
"I drink this when I visit my boyfriend's family in Canada, and it's fit for purpose. It's light yellow in color, smells vaguely sweetish, and has no flavor to which one could object. Very light body [I suppose I detected one], but good carbonation. O Canada!"

"On tap at a bar over by North Station. Served in a regular pint glass. Bright yellow colored body. Fluffy foamy white head, and lots of carbonation. Admittedly a decent looking lager. Smell was absent. Taste was mostly just a jumble of adjunct product flavors. Mouthfeel was on the crisp side, and it was fairly smooth. It's not a bad beer, and it goes down fairly easily. The only reason I ordered it was that I hadn't had a Molson in years. So, now I have, and I probably won't again anytime soon. It's a hockey arena cheap-o plastic cup beer, and nothing more."
""

"Good for days when you know you will drink more than you should"

"Light clean crisp mild taste. Nary a hope to be found. Taste drops off at the end. Easy drinker, better than US macros. But not remarkable."
"O: This is a mediocre pale lager, one that I would only consume if I had no other options. It's better than many other mainstream lagers, though. Still, there are better options out there and there's no point in wasting time on beers like this."

"O: Goes down ok, mildly tasty, not filling, expected kick, for the style - a nice adaptation of the style, a decent alternative to BMC products, but on an every day basis, not a beer that I would seek out."

"Overall Drinkability - Truly a once in a lifetime beer. And by that I mean I'm not planning on buying it again. Light, only slightly flavorful, and mostly inoffensive. Basically an imported Budweiser."
"O: Overall non-offensive flavor, easy enough drinkability if your into the style or not. Rather clean even when warmed up when compared to south of the border examples."
"overall = This is my go to cheap beer. Doesn't have as much of that weird canadian beer taste as labatt, but is sitll very crisp."
"O- Overall, while far from my favorite, I think this is a very good, drinkable beer for what it is. I bought a 24 pack of this that was on sale for a little get together I hosted recently, and it went over big with my non-craft friends, for what that's worth. While you can definitely find worse for the price, I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to buy this again if something else were available."
"MCL sets itself apart from most U.S. macro adjuncts/pale lagers and Canada's Labatt Blue shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence (edit...edit...). Still, not as good as Narragansett's interpretation of the style."
"O - A good basic lager, should be considered a EPL instead of a AAL"
"Perhaps the best attribute of this brew is it's crisp finish that leaves hardly any aftertaste. It is light bodied and modestly carbonated. Clearly this is a beer to be consumed as cold as possible for maximum enjoyment with a numbed sense of smell and taste. As this brew got warm, it became a burden. Sitting here trying to enjoy something with flavor and aroma is a failure. It does however fit the bill of an adjunct brew and it is for the most part without fault. This isn't something that I would purchase if given options. However, I will admit that in my years between the age of 16 and 20 I consumed a metric shit ton of this as well as Yuengling. Sitting here tonight I am thankful I have seen the light of what quality beer really is."
"Pours a clear light straw yellow with a 2 finger head that doesnt stick around too long. Smells of boiled corn water and lager funk, typical for an AAL. Grainy, and sweet and clean. Light, crisp, refreshing, watered down. Overall, its an AAL thats smack dab in the middle, taste good enough to be with the best of em but bad enough to be with the worst of em."
"Overall: I have to give the Canadians credit, they make a solid adjunct lager. It's got enough nuanced flavor to be interesting, but still carries that distinct adjuncty flair to make it go down with ease and repetition."
"D - Probably my favorite macro-lager right now. It's not fantastic, but I never find it unenjoyable or offensive in any way. It's a simple beer, with a nice flavor & feel to it."
"Final Grade: 3.18, a C+."
"O: This is a light beer, for sure. It’s drinkable, but not intriguing or memorable. Not my style; not my style at all."
"I've been on a ""cheap beer"" kick lately, and while they're all relatively similar (PBR, Bud, Highlife etc...), I think Molson Canadian takes the cake thus far."
"O - There's certainly better Canadian beers to buy, but I would never turn one down. I wish this wasn't one of the top Canadian exports, but I'm inclined to think it might be. You'll need to come to Canada to see what we really have to offer!"
"Pours a pale golden-yellow, fizzy, with a quickly-dissipating finger or two of bubbly white head. Smell of old grains, sweet corn, and similar taste, with plenty of funk and skunk. Stale, rotten garbage aftertaste. Very light and very undrinkable. Probably worse than most US adjunct beers. The Ice is slightly better."
"O- Good session beer, especially if your going to mow down some heavy appetizers or tailgate food."
"The beer is a pale golden yellow with lots of bubbles rising and a foamy white head that hung around and left a lot of lacing. It smells of hay, lemon and skunk. The taste is a bit mettalic with some other grassy and bready flavors. Feels a bit watery with carbonation that stings the tongue and a slightly dry finish. This beer is better than American Macros and I would drink it again. It's very easy drinking."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small sweet malt. In the taste, small dryness with a corn like sweet malt. A small bite and thin bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to a clean aftertaste. Quite thin and lacking flavor and aroma."
"O: This still remains to be my favorite macro. I think I'm just biased to the taste since this was usually what I'd drink before I discovered craft beer."
"Well, it's not my favorite beer but could be bought for a ""party beer"" if you dont want to spend a lot and want to bring beer everyone will enjoy. It is definetely the best tasting beer from Molson that I have had so far."
"Another adjunct lager... Such a bummer. The color is the standard yellow brew with a little head on it. Quickly fades. This beer isn't skunky which is awesome. It's rather pleasant to drink. This beer is one of the better generic beers from Canada, it's much better than XXX from them."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth and crips drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas. It's an overall worthy beer."
"24 ounce can, best by date of June 12, 2011 printed on the bottom of the can. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. Aroma is sweet malt, grain and a bit of corn. No offensive aromas that I notice. Taste is just like the aroma, it's all sweet malt, grain and corn. Doesn't taste bad. Mouthfeel/body is light, with moderate carbonation. Overall, I think it's an average beer. For the style, it's not bad. It certainly wasn't hard to drink, I've had worse brews. Picked it up this morning for $1.49 on sale at my local Giant Eagle, for that price I can't complain."
"Typical-looking adjunct lager- straw yellow with a little head that dissolves right away. Typical-smelling adjunct lager- grainy, corny and sweet. Crisp, vegetable flavor but more than the average adjunct lager. Nice body and pleasant aftertaste as well."
"I wouldn't turn one down, but there are many better beers out there."
"D - I am thinking summer, over 70 degrees. Light and refreshing."
"Pours a stunningly clear yellow. A pillowy head stays around for a while. Smell is Granddad's classic ""beer smell."" Which is to say slightly sweet, biscuity malts, and slightly bitter hops. Taste is a little less impressive; most of the quality is muted, and a tin taste comes into play. Finishes minerally and almost too bitter. Feel is slick and a bit on the thin side. Drinks OK. This one appeared better than what it tasted, imo."
"Light bodied, average carbonation. Very generic. Not worth trying again."
"This stuff is great, its one of those market beers you get for the fridge or for a good time. Super refreshing, just like its Canadian friend Moosehead, and easy to drink. Not much to say. Just go buy it!!!"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A medium bodied and fine-tuned taste. I was impressed with this lager. It isn't just another A.A.L. The taste is very smooth and refreshing. It makes me want to go ""Ahhhh"" after every drink."
"A fair Canadian brew, basically Canada's Budweiser. Passing grade, but not the best."
"A fizzy yellow pour. Crystal clear, and so are the sides of my glass, unobstructed by any lacing. Not a good start. Smell is sweet. Light corn and a little grassiness. Taste is grainy and sweet, some corn again. Better than a lot of adjunct lagers. Fizzy and dry on the tongue. Drinkability in that you could drink a lot if you had to. Don't think I want to drink great quantities of any adjunct lager though."
"I am slightly embarrassed that this is one of the beers people from outside Canada tend to think is indicative of what Canada has to offer. Same goes for most of what Molson and Labatt have to offer. Doesn't have a place in my fridge."
"D: Very easy to drink. A step above a light beer with the weight of many a ""normal"" beer. Not a bad choice if you plan on having quite a few. This won't weigh you down, but doesn't completely cut out flavor."
"Still drinkability is surprisingly to me down the middle, and it's surprisingly not as bad as I remember it. But not the beer I want to drink at anytime since there is so much better to be had."
"D: This would have to be my favorite macro lager. I've spent plenty of saturdays at the bar drinking pitcher of canadian. Never lets you down."
"So this is Canadian beer ehh? This Canadian Lager pours a pale yellowish color with the scent of cheap grains and malts. There is grains in the taste as well as hints of citrus. Not a terrible in taste it's just really weak with little taste and no volume to it. Considering the costs and taste, Miller or Bud would be a better pick."
"as far as drinkability i think its One of the best regular lager beers that north america offers from our freinds up in canada. a great beer if you plan on drinking quite a few beers and don't want a whole lot of that annoying fizzy adjuct taste that's found in lot of mass produced beer brands."
"While this is better than other mass-produced pale lagers I've had, it leaves a lot to be desired as a beer. Pick it up if it's being put up against the likes of PBR, Bud, etc. or ""light"" beers; avoid otherwise."
"Don't get me wrong, this is not a great beer. However, for an AAL I think this may be the best one I've had yet (compared to the big breweries AALs, which are the only AALs I've had before). Unimpressive all around, but surprising in the taste. Goes down easy. Wouldn't buy it again, but if offered I'd drink it."
"Aroma and taste are mainly of grains and corn. Nothing much to write about regarding taste and aroma. Decent carbonation and lacing along the glass. Fairly flat taste wise. Does good at quenching thirst and that's about it. Perfect pairing with chips and pizza. Decent beer for a hot day."
"D: Couldn't drink this often"
"D - For the most part this is your average easy drinking macro lager with a taste that seems better than most from the style making it a decent no thought just a beer beer."
"Dr: Nice, but a bit pricey. Will satisfy lager fans."
"easy drinker, prolly one of the better macros out there, but still average swill."
"I had a PBR afterwords and it was heavenly compared to Molson, I could taste things."
"At the Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest and the beer choices were Canadian or Coors Light. I suppose this was the best choice, though not a good choice. Poured a straw yellow without any head or lacing. Smells slightly metallic, grassy and some malt. Flavour is almost non-existent. Way too carbonated to go down easy. I had to drink several of these as it was the only option. Couldn't handle sipping it much, so whenever possible I got into chugging competition and drinking games that allowed me to down the beer in a few seconds."
"btw great for shotgunning :)"
"Very high. It's whole lot better than Coors, Bud and Miller."
"Drinkability is good for the style so the other 5 bottles won't be a chore to drink."
"I`ve had this beer in a variety of formats, though on this night I drink from the bottle. Pours a yellowy orange ,with very littlehead, drinks okay, I pick up on the barley a bit, leaves no very little to no lacing, as far as macrobrewery lagers go this is okay."
"overall i think it was ok, compared to my last beer of the night, but do not think i will be doing this one again."
"Molson Canadian pours a clear yellow gold with a thin head that doesn't stick around. The aroma is slightly sweet and very grainy. The flavour is much the same, with some light fruitness. There is not much too it, but nothing objectionable. The finish is clean and dry, with a slight lingering astringency."
"D: best when served cold. at least it is a step up from the light beers."
"It's pretty tasty, actually. The label says that this beer is ""the best Canada has to offer", which probably isn't ultimately true but it isn't a bad choice."
"Drink - An okay beer if there's nothing else available."
"This used to be pretty good beer, but I think that's going back 10 or 15 years or so. You want to like it because of the cool, old-timey label. It looks like a beer should look, but the taste let's you down. The color is yellow. The carbonation is good, and the mouthfeel is crisp and smooth. But, the flavor is salty, brassy/metallic, a bit sour with cheap vodka alcohol flavors. The alcohol flavor should be easy to hide but it comes right to the front in this beer because there are virtually no offsetting flavors, like hops which seem nonexistent. Brash, harsh, biting, not refreshing at all. Kind of like a weaker version of cheap-ass malt liquor. Molson has gone down the tubes."
"drinkability: good, theres something better in this molson than the other molson member dosnt have. i cant put my finger on."
"Very good Canadian beer. Looks good. Smell of wonderful hops and the head isn't bad on this beer. Taste of golden hops that is crisp, clean and refreshing. Mouthful has the same rating see taste. Drinkability is wonderful could drink a good amount of beer with this brand. By far the best Canadian beer out there."
"I should admit that this type of beer is usually not my genre. True, there is a time and a place for all things, but I'm neither in a ball park, nor outside in the sun. The goal of this game is neither to cool off nor doze off. It's to appreciate what you're drinking. And as hard as I try, this doesn't really do it for me."
"Taste, massive carbonation hides the lack of flavor. Minimal hops or malt, neat fruit strain of yeast I guess. Crisp, always tastes fresh, but that could just be the pristine water. I can't understand why this is $6+ a 6er, there's not much to it."
"Not tasty, flavorful, or delicious, but certainly drinkable. I'd take this over miller/bud/coors."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked NOV0710-00823NA. Sampled on July 10, 2010. It pours a fizzy, pale yellow with a frosty, bubbly topping and busy carbonation. Very typical look for the style. The aroma has a light malty note along with that usual Canadian grainy scent. The mouthfeel is a bit watered down but not intolerable while the taste is a mish-mosh of grains, malts, and adjunts with little in the way of hops. However they are not entirely absent. Better than the Molson Golden I think."
"D: Its a winner but be careful this beer is a creeper and will knock you on your ass."
"last edit: 7/14/10."
"D- All night!"
"Drinkability - I had a good friend who used to swear by this beer, but I didn't really see it. Now that my taste buds have been about a bit, I can kinda see where he was going with this one. It's a good all around, every day kind of beer."
"D: Couldn't they at least triple hop this beer? A little more in the flavor department would be appreciated."
"The rest is average. A beer to drink and then go on with the better beers there are. Nice though from my aunt, thanks tante Toos!!!"
"Looks like processed apple juice with fizz and has a strong head. I have a difficult time placing the smell of this one, it almost smells metallic and chemically. Taste isn't all that bad, up front is that metallic/chemical taste, but it makes up for it with a nice wheat aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nothing to brag about, similar to a bud or labatt. I live in upstate NY, so this beer is fairly cheap, since I'm close to the border. I can see myself drinking a few of these if I'm on a tight budget."
"I'd say avoid this beer. You end up paying more for it because it is imported, but you can buy a lot of other better imported beers for the same money. I cannot see why Molson is sold in the US. It tastes like a low end beer, but it costs that of an imported beer."
"I've reviewed out of the bottle already, but the can was certainly different. A lot more grain action than I recall from the bottle. Still one of the best macro lagers available today."
"This beer actually surprised me and I thought that it was much better than I expected it to be. The beer was a decent light golden color, slightly better than most BMC-type beers, with a light, white, foamy head that dissipated quickly, but into a thin spotty cap. Not much of an aroma to it, grainy. Not much else. The taste was light and grainy, but again, better than most BMC-style beers. The beer was light, but I found it to be very drinkable and if I had more time I probably would have had another. Overall, way better than expected and I might actually give it a shot again."
"overall: split a 28 pack with my buddy. i thought it was a great deal 14 beers for 10$ WOW. overall i enjoyed this beer mostly as a study beer as a crammed for my finals the pasted week or two. great for just hanging out (right now watching the wings v coyotes game). liked the beer and would probably spilt another one of these 28 packs again."
"It would be interesting to put this in a blind tasting."
"Paid 1.09 for a 24 ounce, and for the price it can't be beat."
"Good beer overall."
"Overall: Molson reminds me of an expensive, maltier version of Miller Lite. If I had to choose, I'd take the American alternative, probably based on the money factor."
"Had this on draft with dinner. Golden yellow color with little head. Crisp clean flavors. Tastes a little of straw and grass. Pretty mellow flavor. More dry than sweet in flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth. Was pretty drinkable with a spicey ham sandwich, coleslaw and fries."
"Not too shabby. Sweet grains are the main contributor in the flavor department. Fair amount of bittering hops dry out the finish just enough. What is notable about Molson Canadian is that is has a decidedly medium body and does not taste watery or thin. This is actually a pretty decent adjunt lager. I wont exactly be running out to the grocery store to stock up on a few cases of this, but this one is above average for the style."
"Standard American lager pour, smell, and mouthfeel. I thought the flavor was nice and crisp with none of the corn or background alcohol flavors found in it's American counterparts. I think this will be my new go-to cheap beer."
"Drinkability: Dreadful. This really is a bad beer. I am not joking when I overheard the European hockey fans saying ""this is the worst beer I've ever tasted"" and ""in Europe, we wash our hands with this"". I only chose this to enjoy the evening, as it was either that or Coors Light or wine (which is not for me). Next time I'll go without. Disgusting."
"Is it boring? Absolutely. But when compared with others of the style, Canadian isn't that bad. In fact, it's quite drinkable given the proper circumstances. At a hockey arena or sports venue, it suits the atmosphere well. I doubt I'll willingly purchase it much again, but I won't refuse it out of principle anymore."
"Libation: Smooth and actually drinkable. It's an adjunct lager that delivers some flavor."
"My pour resulted in two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head exploding with CO2 bubbles. Color was a pale golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was slightly metallic with cereal undertones and a light lager sweetness. Oof. Nobody said the CANQuest would be all tea and crumpets, that's for sure. Mouthfeel was on the thin side, a little watery even for the style. Taste was really mild, almost like a light lager, vice an American Adjunct. Finish was equally unobtrusive. Added up, it was a whole buncha not much. Sheesh! I'll leave this one up north where it came from."
"Bought this one in a can, at LCBO. Smell is ok, there is almost no head. The taste is where I have a problem! I do not like it, due to lack of flavors. Nice carbonation tho, but I would opt for a different lager. Would not recommend this to a friend."
"This is my favorite Canadian Macro lager. Being a French-Canadian, I believe this lager represents Canadian beer fairly well at the Macro level. It's main attraction is it's balance. It's got carbonation, but just the right amount to make it exciting enough to drink all night. It's got flavor, and many dimensions of it...whether its a slightly bitter hop, a nice toasted corn, or a really malty fizzy gulp...it's all in there. The mouthfeel is very ""alive", the drinkability is ""all night long, every weekend"" for many Canadians, and the smell is very attractive, no skunkiness, nothing offensive in this beer whatsoever. And when poured nice and cold, you'd be very hard pressed to beat this beer with another Canadian Macro Lager. Cheers...pour me another one!"
"This was a bottle poured into a pint glass. Poured a bubbly golden color with a creamy white two finger head. The head fades quickly to a thin lace. Has a clean slightly sweet and grainy smell. Tastes similar to many other mass produced lagers. Tastes a little grainy with light sweet flavors. Kind of a watery finish. Not bad though."
"Notes: This beer is not the best beer ever, however for an adjunct lager I'd say its pretty good. I would much rather have this over any BMC product. It has a little uniqueness to it that American adjuncts don't have. Even if it is only the result of different adjuncts, I still like it better. This is my favorite beer to have while at a hockey game."
"Overall, I can see why someone might reach for this if they're in the mood for a simple brew that refreshes the palate. Canadian is not a good beer, but for a weak ass mega lager it surpasses expectations. Worth a try if your options are limited."
"Overall: This is a great beer, as good as or better than any of the similarly-priced BMC products (Bud, MGD, or Coors Original). Highly recommended."
"This is one of those lagers that you can really put down, but for pure enjoyment it is not a good choice. this is i think a session beer where if your at a bar you can definalty put a few of these down with out getting sick of it. my brother in law is a fan of this yet he is not a fan of bud, cause there really isn't much of a difference between the two other then the taste of Molson being a little bit better then Bud. if you decided to drink it it won't be to much of a disappointment but still i would go for something with a little bit more taste then this one"
"D - I have no desire to revisit this one in the future... Belongs in the class with the majority of macro offerings..."
"Pours a golden yellow, with a little bit of head that goes away. This is one of those cheap, gets the job done kind beers. It is a nice smooth medium bodied lager, light alcohol flavor, and very decently malty. Mouthfeel is a little fizzy, a bit too much carbonation, but this is a solid beer."
"Golden amber, one finger rocky white head, quick dissipation, some lacing. A bit of bready malts in the nose, no hops. Taste profile is the same. Lacking in character, IMO. One of the blandest beers I've ever had. Upon reflection, I should have had a glass of wine instead of taking Papi's last beer."
"As i read fellow Advocate reviews on this beer, I am actually finding myself enjoying this fine brew from our neighbors up north. I can't say i relate to the hockey connection (being a football guy) but I tell you what--this is reminding me a whole lot of Falstaff back in the 70's. And that was me and my Dad's favorite beer."
"Not the best Canada has to offer but certainly not bad. Pale yellow with a good head and good carbonation. Sweet grainy smell. Refreshing mouthfeel with a crisp and clean finish. Good taste for the style. A nice go-to beer if your out and want something different. This one can go all night and not get boring."
"Poured from a bottle into a frosted stein."
"12 packs of Molson were on sale so I figured I'd try the one not in the green bottle. It's not bad for a quick thirst quencher or something to drink while watching the game."
"not what I want people to think of when they hear Canadian beer. this beer looks better then it is don't go looking this one, I doubt you would have too look far anyways"
"Ok, this isn't horrible. Better than the ""King of Beers", but not my drink of choice."
"Drinkability- Actually highly drinkable and its does grow on you a bit, certainly has more flavor then alot of the other mass produced lagers, nothing world changing but for the cheap price 5.69 for a 6 pack something i would certainly visit again, nice session beer good for watching sports and having some nice pizza"
"Drinkability? I recommend this beer for getting drunk only, and may I recommend a pack of unfiltered Luckies to help mask the taste of this awful beer?"
"D: Honestly I thought this would be better than it turned out to be. I could actually drink it pretty fast, but really there's nothing to go back to."
"Overall it's not a bad beer, but it doesn't knock your socks off either. It's smooth, not to carbonated, and tastes a little watery to me. I'll be serving it at a party today and I'll be interested in what the people have to say about it. For me, I'd drink it if my favorites weren't available, it's better than a light beer."
"This is just your typical macro brewed beer."
"Overall, my favorite macro out there. If I don't go for a craft brew, which isn't very often, I definitely grab a Molson Canadian. I would take it over Budweiser many times over."
"Had this straight out of the bottle while at camp. Buddy brought it back from Canada. Appearance and smell was that of your typical macro lager.It actually went down pretty smoothly and the taste was a bit better than your average macro. Mouthfeel was medium and drinkability was pretty good. A semi-solid choice for quaffing at camp."
"Cheers!!"
"D: There's really nothing special about this beer. It really is just a clean-tasting run-of-the-mill macro lager."
"Appearance is a light straw yellow with no head and nill lace. Smell of adjuncts and light hops. taste is grainy, corn and hop. Mouthfeel has good body with higher carbonation. Considering it's really not that bad, it's better than a lot of other macro's out there."
"I'd drink this if I wanted to get hammered, I was having non-beer geek friends over, or I wanted to get hammered while choking down ballpark franks a family reunion."
"Drinkability: It's not bad, but it's not something I'm going to rush out and buy every weekend."
"Not the worst macro lager by any means. I could drink this if there was nothing better to be had."
"Drinkability - there's no question that this is highly quaffable if you suspend all interest in complex flavours. The sweetness for me definitely gets annoying and is probably the cause of much vomiting over the years, along with the bad pizza that accompanied the night of binging. This one has the advertising juggernaut behind it though so it will be a mainstay for many for years to come."
"D: very tasty beer i can drink a couple of these cans"
"D: For cheap beer I guess it's okay but it tastes like a light beer. Overall it is lacking. It would be good if I just started college and drinking there."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells slightly sweet with a touch of corn. Taste is not bad but rather bland. Not a lot of flavor here. Feels watery in the mouth. Goes down smooth, drinkability is good. Overall an average lager."
"D - Goes down smooth. A solid lawnmower beer, or something worthy of washing down food at your next summer BBQ."
"A solid inexpensive lager in the tradition of German Bavarian lagers. It far surpasses many of the big name Germans including Becks and St. Pauli Girl and beats the American big 3 hands down. That said it is a good but not great brew that diminishes in direct contrast to its temperature. As it warms it loses appeal. it is best served at 40-45 degrees during the summer months. The flavor mix is also a tad weak but I'll take weak over unpleasant any day!"
"Verdict: Best I do not give one since I show bias against Canadian tasting beer."
"Final Thoughts: When I was younger, and didn't know any better, the reasons for drinking Canadian were a mixture of national pride, funny commercials and getting used to beer in general. Over time, other beer became available and I expanded my horizons. To this day, Canadian remains the yard stick for me, as so far as what an average, generic beer tastes like and should be. I'll still have it on the occasion for nostalgia's sake, usually only because I have to choose between other macro brews."
"Nothing out of the ordinary here. This was pretty much everything I expected it to be. Pale golden color with this white head. Grassy malt profile in aroma and taste. There was actually a bit more body than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise. An adjunct lager to the core. Not a bad choice if you are looking to grab a adjunct lager."
"Pours a perfectly clear straw yellow with a surprisingly resilient white head. Smells slightly sweet and...adjuncty. Very light, somewhat grainy taste. Grain water might actually be the best descriptor. Feel is actually decent for the style, but still lacking. Easy to drink, and nice for what it is, but in the end just another characterless, flavorless macro."
"D- Drinks pretty well, although I would reach for something more exciting."
"Though it's nothing special, this beer goes down easily and cleanly, and I like it a lot more than many in the style. This used to be the beer that fuelled my weekends in university. Thankfully better taste has prevailed, but I still drink this when it's cheap out at the bars."
"This beer is a bit light and easy drinking. Some nice crispness to the feel and a bit refreshing."
"D- One of my favorites for an all day affair such as tailgating etc."
"Overall this is quite drinkable and perhaps a small step above others of its kind."
"I found this to be an exceptional lager beer. I especially enjoyed its taste and drinkability. It is a far suerior product to those watered down versions put out by Bush, Bud, or Bud Light and - at a significantly lower price per bottle I might add. I will make it a point to always keep some on hand (for myself if no one else)."
"D: Flavorful for the style, goes down easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style for whatever that may be worth, while it wouldn't be the first beer I'd pick, it's better than most other adjunct lagers."
"Pours a transparent straw yellow with a largely carbonated pillowy head. Smell is minimal, taste is very crisp and clean. Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Drinkability is high due to the ultra clean flavor. Highly recommended vs. domestics such as Bud/Bud Light, this is the same price and is much more friendly to the palate."
"D - Easily a session beer. Not interesting in the least bit though."
"Drinkability: Another perfect bottle beer from the Great White North. It would make a nice brew for a hot summer weekend. Too bad they don't have those in Canada."
"Drinkability: I was actually surprised by this one. It was pretty darn good for what it is a fairly good tasting, underappreciated mass beer."
"Decent brew"
"Out of a bottle this beer was a pale gold color with good clarity and rising carbonation. The one-finger of white head displayed decent retention and pretty good, consistent lacing. The aroma was lightly sweet, pale malt with some stale grains. The flavors started quite dry and grainy before giving way to lager malt, sweet malt and pale malt. I detected a touch of sourness as it warmed up along with a rather macro-lager note that it finished on. Rather acidic making it less sessionable. Though washed out, as one would expect for the style, this beer was rather well balanced between the dry graininess and malty sweetness. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/light and the carbonation medium/high. If you gotta go cheap, this is a pretty good choice."
"I paid 22- for a case of this. It is piss. I have enjoyed Molson products in the past, but in a blind taste test you couldn't differentiate this beer from mil best or golden anniversary. Insanely avg for its price. I did drink it down though thank you very much."
"Acceptable enough, I suppose, for lowest common denominator outings such as these, and other captive audiences, but hardly worthy of opting for, given a choice. It does make me wistful for the days of first year university dorms, and my future off-campus roommate's 'Molson Man' decorating prowess."
"When you break this beer down, it's a lot better than some of the other cheap stuff out there. At the same time, it also comes out as very ""neutral."" As bad of a beer as Bud Light is, there is something about being super cold and super light that is refreshing at times. This is a bit of a confusing mix between a good pilsner and a bad macro."
"Average macro lager, not much aroma at all, highly carbonated, hops barely there. The taste is mostly grainy but not strong overall. It better that the BMC, and probably take it over labatts as well."
"I suppose this beer would go hand in hand with Labbatt. I would say this one comes out on top but not by much. Color is a kinda pale shade and head dissipates quickly. Not too great with food either. Smell is a little displeasing. Cheap though so if thats what your going for, do it. Not the beer for me."
"Had this at a hockey game, and the saving grace was that the beer was isce cold....probably would have rated lower if its true colors came out. Molson.... a Canadian version of BMC."
"A pretty average lager overall. Smells grainy and malty. Flavor starts that way as well. Finishes crisp with a grassy hop bitterness that sets it apart slightly from the other Canadian macros. Moderate to heavy carbonation levels. Average body. Not bad, but nothing special either. I'll take it over Labatt I guess. Better out of the bottle or can than on tap."
"Worth the drink if you want something really light. Light and refreshing, flavor is fairly generic, but not bad. Overall, decent quaff."
"Extremely light in color and a ridiculous amount of visible carbonation. The smell is just terrible: very sour and skunky. Any flavor that this beer might have is gone before you realize it was there and you're left with a nasty aftertaste. Just terrible."
"Definitely one to have after mowing the lawn."
"Drinkability is about average, more filling than most of the style, but more flavorful and quality overall too. Brown bottles harder to skunk. The best of the mass produced lagers (BMC etc)"
"P.s. If you want a decent molson brew, try black ice."
"(rated Aug 17, 2008)"
"Another Canadian lager. These always seem better than their US counterparts. Pours clear gold, white head. Mineral and cereal aroma. Sharp, clean taste of crystal malt. Refreshing, but lacks a lot of flavor. Kind of a sharp aftertaste. I always thought this was just re-labeled Molson Export, but it does not taste as good."
"Pours a clear, yellow body with a small, white head.Sweetish cereal nose with a bit of stale grain and some very faint floral hints. Taste is light pale malts with a cereal sweetness. Very minor floral hop character and even less bitterness. Short, sweetish finish, but you're left with a lingering stale flavor. Mouthfeel: Light-bodied. Medium carbonation.Drinkable"
"I would have to say that this beer is average in every way. I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me and at the same time I'd never buy this from the beer store. I prefer bud or blue. There is a real wet cardboard smell to it I find and the malt overpowers the hop bitterness too much. Too carbonated IMHO."
"Drinkability - On the whole, not a bad beer, but nothing to write home about. A good warm weather beer, it is refreshing. It's not too expensive. I would drink it again, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to get some of it."
"Drinkability: Not recommended. Sure, alot of these pale lagers are harmless and are generally tasteless, but these lagers that deliver some foulness to the palate really get under my skin."
"D - This beer excels in a number of aspects when considering the style, but overall the sweetness comes off as malt-liquor-esque. Ultimately it isn't quite dry or tasteless enough to take the place of other American macros, but a tasty example nonetheless."
"Overall, one of the better ones."
"The taste is simple, light sweet grain, corn and cooked rice, with a light bitterness that has only a slight perfumy grassy quality. It's a bit on the thin side but quite drinkable and refreshing with a nice grain finish and aftertaste."
"Overall a drinkable, well made macro lager. Probably one of my favorite mainstreams."
"Pours a seethru, light yellow with a tad bit of murky cloudiness and minor lacings. Light, airy smell of corn, rice and other adjuncts. Has a smoothness on the front and a dry bite on the end. In between is fluffy carbonation that fills your mouth even though the body is light. Minor hop taste w/ no malts to speak of; sorta bland and watery. I wouldn't turn one down, but I'm not a big fan of this beer."
"This is one of the better North American megabrewery products. It pours a thick white head atop a light golden liquid. The head produces a very nice lacing on the glass. The nose is very soft, but gives hints of the maltiness that comes across as a light sweetness on the palate. The finish is slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is smooth and not too watery. This combination makes the beer very refreshing and drinkable."
"Not a bad beer for a macro, but not worth the hype. Better than some other common beers though. I could drink a bunch since I'm not picky, but you might get sick of this after a while and crave some body."
"This is one of the best mass produced Canadian lagers available to me. Beats Labbatts hands down. Easy to drink and pleasant to the taste buds. Six packs are generally on sale so I can't even complain about it being over priced, highly recommended as a beer to grab when in doubt."
"D: Pound it while it's cold!"
"Drinkability: One of the bettermainstream lager. Very refreshing with food flavor."
"Drinkability: I had this on 7/6 and it had a best by date of 9/28 so I'm assuming it was pretty fresh. I had two and would get this for a gathering if fresh."
"CIt pours a clear amber color with a fair but fleeting white head and minor signs of lacing. Solid wheat cereal aroma. Crisp clean wheat bread with a bit of citrus bitterness. Smooth, acqueous and plenty easy drinking. Refreshing and clean with a touch of alcohol cracker at the back of the mouth. Better than average among macro type lagers, but nothing to go out looking for."
"D: This beer has a special place in my heart. Super easy drinking macro. Cheap for a decent beer. While noting remarkable a decent beer."
"A pretty decent brew in a pinch and if its on sale. Good for hot days in the sun or mowing the lawn."
"Notes: This is a great beer to pair with hockey eh."
"Has a golden appearance thats lighter than one would htink for the strength better in bottle or tap, but still drinkable in can."
"I am a lover of local New England Micros like Long Trail and Magic Hat, and love the Sam Adams line. I also love Hoegaarden, Bass, and Duvel, but when it comes time to go back to basics, this is the beer I reach for. Like an old friend, it never lets you down. From the land of Hockey comes this beer that is Cold, Crisp, and Refreshing! Drink one while watching your favorite NHL team..it just feels right,eh?"
"A fair effort from Molsons. Nice clear yellow gold in the glass. No head at all. Slight yeast nose. Very simple taste. A little bit of hops. Certainly not thirst quenching. A good beer to wash firey wings down with. An ok beer from one of the big boys in canada."
""
"Straw yellow with a big foamy white head which fades quickly. Minimal lacing. Smell is nondescript, slight hops. Taste is like seltzer mixed with a malt liquor. Lots of adjunct flavor, some veggie funk, sticky sweetness. Pretty light, easy to drink but no reason to."
"Drinkability here is the best part for me. This beer doesn't have alot of flavor, but what it does have is mellow, making this excellent for just about anything. I take a 6-er of this with me when I fish, drink it when I'm cooking, amazing beer for the price. I'll be drinking this one a long time."
"I try to keep a sixer of this on hand for use as my all around beer. I love how basic it is to be honest. And you really can't beat the taste for the price."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a a medium bodied white head that left a decent amount of lacing down the glass. Has a light malty and hoppy aroma with no other real flavors detectable in the nose. The taste is pretty good for an American Macro Lager. It tastes of a nice amount of malts with a slightly hoppy bitterness at the end. Its not overwhelmingly anything which is pretty refreshing. The mouthfeel is pretty good with a refreshing mouthfeel. The drinkabilit is very good as I could throw back several of these for sure."
"Drinkability: very easy to drink. Flavors and scents are light, but not offensive. I could drink several of these during a hot summer afternoon."
"If it's at a party, and it's all there is, know you could be stuck with a lot worse. Molson gets a bad rap sometimes, and even though none of their lineup is worth seeking out, it's not all that bad of a macro lager."
"D - This is an easy drinking lager that just may be the best basic macro lager that I've ever had. It's not outstanding, but it's definitely drinkable and pleasant going down."
"d: pretty ok for a macro lager but not worth drinking unless you are playing flip cup or something; i still think the japanese are the kings of the macro lager"
"I guess this is a decent macro. Not too corny and fairly balanced."
"D: Very smooth, easy drinker. One of the better macro lager's."
"D--For the style, I rather like this beer. Very little thats off, and its a step up from its American competitors (Coors, Miller and Bud). Of all the crap you see at hockey games being served, buy this one."
"D: A really nice mainstream lager. Very refreshing with solid flavor."
"Color is a typical straw-yellow, like most lagers. Aroma is strong, crisp and malty, but not complex - very typical. Flavor is malty, smooth and rather bland - not terrible, but nothing special. This is no different from any of a number of American mega-brews I have tasted."
"It is what it is, but I could drink these all night."
"I knew it would be inevitable I would sample this on-tap during my last trip. I found some when I was at the Madhatter Saloon. Compared to the bottle, the aroma and taste are not as astringent, but a little more sweet. I shall also add the mouthfeel is better too."
"No its not bad. I like the regular Molson better, though, if I remember there is a bit more spice in 'em. Go get 'em!"
"This is a good one with salty snacks, but alone it is dreadful."
"Canada's macros are a solid half point superior to ours on avarage, and Canadian fits into that pretty well. Drinkable and affordable in a pinch."
"Overall, it's nothing outstanding, it's got all the characteristics of a pale, semi-sweet artificial macro lager, but give it some credit that it has a bit of character to it and it's well suited for when you want to toss back a few. Recommend it to your Bud-drinking friend."
"Could drink a lot of this, but the one dimensional taste would get very old although it is light and only five percent alcohol, not recommended unless you simply want to try something different and do not have access to any craft brews"
"Pours a nice pale gold, with very little head and no lacing. Has a slighlty sour smell. Crisp taste, nice and clean and malty, although bordering on sour. Goes down really nice. While it would not stand against a micro/craft lager, for a macro lager it's quite good."
"This standard beverage from North of the border, Molson Canadian pleases more with the taste than to the eye. It pours a modest head and maintains a decent aroma. Yet its taste is rather good, a reliable lager far preferable to so many mass-produced American alternatives. Canadian is smooth, a tad hoppy and goes down easily, but its moderate aftertaste somewhat diminishes its mouthfeel, for me. Yet it is all too easy to have a few Canadians during a ball game, out on the patio, or on a warm Summer day. It is also a good cleansing beer when sampling other styles, nice to intersperse with a porter, stout, or various Belgians."
"D- its a quencher but would like some more flavor in a canadian lager. a step above most macros."
"one of my staples now that i'm in NY, everyone loves canadian beer here, and it's cheap; pours a pale yellow w/ a fluffy white head which dissapates quickly and has minimal lacing; has some hop aroma w/ a ""macro"" type adjunct filled beer smell; a slight hop flavor as well, fairly watered down tasting though, a ricey malt prof. under it all; light in body but high in carbonation, would prob. be dry if it wasn't so watered down; i could (and have on occasion) drink a few 6's on a hot day easily"
"D - Had two of these, could barely polish off the third. Cheap beer admittedly, but not cheap beer I want to drink a lot of."
" It is better from a bottle that is pulled out of a cooler after sitting in there so long that the ice has melted down to floaters and the label is worn off, but you could do much worse buying canned beer."
"D - A basic Macro lager w/ lackluster qualities. Ok for quaffing w/ wings or if nothing else is available. Could be an ok lawnmower beer, but I will definitely not be trying this again."
"Not a bad beer at the time cause i needed it just to relax and was quite thirsty...i've had worst but not something to go out of your way for."
"D - This isn't a terrible choice when stacked against other macro lagers"
"Pours a bright yellow, almost neon color with a thick, bubbly white head that disappears like Houdini to leave nothing behind. Smell is of corn and grains and not much else. Taste is a little of the same malt and grains. Carbonation is heavy and not very watery making it a little more enjoyable than most macros."
"I didn't hate it! I didn't LIKE it, either, and even though I think I like it a bit more than a Budweiser I wouldn't over it over one because someone is wasting resources to import this mediocre brew... but if I'm ever in Canada, and you buy one for me, I won't be secretly cringing."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice lacy white head and a light golden/straw color. The aroma is a faint grainy malt. A smell of sweetness is there that is hard to describe. The taste is slightly watery up front, but a smoothiness is present as the beer goes down. The body is thin. Not the worst lager to be drinking, but not the best. The beer is typically cheap and I prefer it to most of the big three."
"Pours a pale yellow color, with a small, quickly dissipating head, and no lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Smells like boring macro lager, very corny (is that a pun), and ricey. The taste matches the aroma for the most part. Nice and smooth, feels nice on the palate. Good amount of carbonation. A decent beer for the style, better than most products by Anheuser-Busch, or Coors, but I still think Miller products (MGD especially) are better for the most part."
"Pours a light clear color with a head that surprisingly sticks around a bit. Aroma is one of corn and somewhat sweet. Taste is much of the same except that there's a nice corn aftertaste to the beer. Much better than a rice aftertaste but not by too much. Not too bad and honestly, I usually find Canadian lagers to be more flavorful (if not by much) than their American counterparts."
"Smell is real corny and sweet. Pours to a golden pale yellow. Not much head. Taste is corny malt with a very minimal bitter finish. Not much flavor overall. Mouthfeel has lots of carbonation. Quite a bland beer overall. I would drink this for free, but wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it."
"A true Canadian taste, whatever. Has a bit more colour than most macros but nothing special. Head dies quickly and has some lace left behind. I can actually smell something that doesnt remind me of funny water, there is a hint of malt but not much else. Not to much taste to it ( witch is to be expected) some sweetness. The only reason I don't totally bash this beer is because it was the first beer I ever had."
"Drinkability.... last resort."
"I think the best memories I have of this beer are all those commercials in the 80s that had bikini clad women...what man with a beer belly doesn't like bikini clad women?"
"Notes: This is along the lines of budweiser. There doesn't seem to be too much difference although this feels even lighter on the palate and maybe even a bit cleaner. Hot weather brew."
"pours a clear golden color with a large white head with a easy pour that settles to just cover the beer and medium lacing. clean earthy smell. bready grainy malt taste with some hops there. mouthfeel light to medium and lots of carbonation. not bad for a macro beer."
"Molson Canadian Lager (along with Labatt Blue) was a staple of mine back in the 80's. I'm pretty sure that I haven't had either a bottle or a can since. It ends up as the loser in Macro Smackdown XVI, but I hate to use that word in such a close, hotly contested grudge match. Could my American citizenship have been the deciding factor? Nah."
"Drinkability- Ver easy drinking light lager. Good for yeardwordk."
"For some reason I bought into the marketing and thought a Canadian macro, might be better than an American macro. I was wrong. It reminded me a lot of Miller Lite, but the grains were slightly darker, making for a bit more caramel flavor. I also found it less offensive than Miller Lite, but I would never bu this for myself."
"as far as nacro-type lagers go, this is pretty good. compared to real beer, of course, it blows. i really used to like this stuff, the noticeable adjuncts almost made it seemed malty or medium bodied before i knew anything. golden blond, force carbonated. not much bouquet other than the corn aromas. taste is very light sweetness balanced by the macro-type level of co2. no discernable hops of course. light in body, no finish to speak of."
"I could knock back quite a few of these without a second thought, but I'd rather have something more remarkable."
"I reviewed this beer comparing it to it's competitors in the macro lager category. I'll say right now it beats the pants off of most I've sampled so far, cheesy advertisements aside."
"While better than Budweiser or something of that ilk, I would much rather have a Labatt Blue if I was grabbing a Canadian beer."
"This beer is nothing special. It's something that is cheap and always there at large events held at places such as arenas and stadiums. Terrible head(if any) and a boring golden look and taste. If you are looking for something that is cheap and you have no appreciation for a good beer, go with this."
"Found a new 'party' beer."
"D- Inoffensive and refreshing nature make this an easy beer to drink. Loses points for blandness."
"Pours a piss yellow( I know the connotations of ""piss' are bad, but this is meant in the worst possible sense). I've never seen a beer where I could swear it would be fluorescent under lights. I'll give it props for the fantastic head retention. Smells like corny, ricey piss(the best kind!!). Now this is where the beer lets down, it tastes like what you see mother eagles regurgitating to their young on the Discovery Channel. Overly bitter, leaving a nasty corn-ish after taste. Mouthfeel is kinda blah. Quite fizzy. Leaves the sense that Satan is present in liquid form all throughout this frozen tundra we call Canada. I gave this a 3 for drinkability, because lets be honest, if you are trying to get drunk, which is what this beer was designed for, it does the trick. Leaves the digestive tract almost as pleasantly as it enters!!"
"Drinkability: flat flavor with big fizz, no real interest. reminds me of carbonated water with a beerish flavor. when i go to a resteraunt and they tell me they have Canadian or other molson products on tap i order an iced tea."
"By no means a favorite, Molson does the trick by providing cheap beer with DECENT taste in a market saturated with cheap beer with no taste."
"There's a perfect beer for each occasion, taste and attitude. Molson Canadian is the right beer for a vast range of times, that few other beers can span. Sometimes pure simplicity isn't a bad thing."
"D- This beer has a flat flavor but a big fizz but no real interest. It reminds me of a carbonated water with a beer flavor."
"The flavor is rescued by a very refreshing finish, and the fact that the overall flavor is, while not actually good, is not really distractingly bad either. For what that's worth, anyway. So it drinks well simply because it crisps up and enlivens the palate on its way out, leaving nothing behind. And I'm not sure that's a recommendation either. So now I remember what I was drinking in my college days, but I do not recall why I'd have thought it was good."
"D - It's an okay lager. Not bad considering how many other beers of this style have little flvaor at all."
"Molson is one of my favorite beers. Canadian beer, this one especially, has an exceptional smell and taste to it. When I am not drinking a heavy, dark beer, this is my favorite beer. Whether you drink it out of a bottle or can, Molson Canadian Lagar will always taste great."
"thanks jeffu!"
"Drannk okay, I could do about 2 pints before I got bored. A slight cut above BMC"
"Not bad for a macro. Better than many of the BMC choices. Still, nothing special."
"Molson Canadian Premium Lager was pale gold in color with a fizzy white head that quickly disappeared . The smell was a little grainy. The taste was crisp and grainy with a dry finish. It was light bodied with plenty of carbonation. It's easy drinking, but pretty boring."
"Drinkability - Though this beer doesn't have any real prominent flavors, something about it's taste simply does not appeal to me. I had considerable trouble choking the bottle down. Which, by the way, is a fairly attractive bottle with a mildly funny back label."
"This is a drinkable beer but a below average one. It lacks something in almost every respect. Id pick a lot of other lagers over this one."
"D- Well, if there is nothing good around I can see myself drinking this all night at a party--that is, as long as it's cold enough to not try to show me any flavor."
"Notes--nothing beats watching Hockey Night in Canada and drinking a bunch of Molson's!"
"D - well, if you have to drink a macro lager, you could do much worse than Molson Canadian. But not a beer I will have again if I can help it."
"Taste is thin pale malt. Sweetish with no discernable hop character. Bland and limp. From the bottle, I used to think this was decent. From the glass, it's not good. Drink ice cold or not at all."
"Pretty standard Lager. Enjoyed at the Detroit Airport. All beers taste pretty good when you are trying to cure boredom while waiting in an airport. This beer begins with a very solid pilsner malt base-grain that shows more light maltiness than grain flavors. Quite sweet and bready, but still with a cleansing carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. Perhaps a bit buttery in flavor and texture with a mild skunk-hoppiness that subsided. Earthy spices from the hops late helps to round out the sweetness and adds character. A good beer for chasing a Pizza."
"For what type of beer this is, I thought it was fantastic. A fantastic lawnmower / pizza / need lots of beer for event X kind of beer. Poured crystal clear golden straw colour with a 4mm white foam layer that dissolved in about 40 seconds. Smelled faintly biscuity and a bit sweet. Tasted biscuity, as well with a dryness about it. Little hops to speak of. Mouthfeel was light and easy to drink. I would certainly take this over BMC any time. It is what it is I suppose."
"Overall, a drinkable lager. This was left in my cooler by someone, as I wouldn't normally buy it myself. You could do a lot worse."
" I prefer the bottled Molson compared to the alluminum canned molson. I would like to thank my father for hooking me up with this case of molson. My last note, another unimpressive macro lager. Cheers"
"Eric"
"This really isn't as bad as I remembered it. Years ago when I first started drinking, I used to hate this beer. Since then I've usually seemed to favour Labatt products over Molson. This really wasn't a bad beer though. In general, I would say that it is pretty much the standard average for a Canadian Macro Lager. Take this as what should be average, and judge other beers against it for above or below average ratings. I'd drink it again in another macro only environment."
"As far as macros go, this one isn't offensive, which is nice. I could see myself drinking this over other macros in a pinch. Not too shabby for the style. The quintessential ""pizza beer""."
"As for taste, its pretty unimposing. Fairly bland with some malts. No bitterness or anything else for that matter. Crisp, clean, refreshing and highly carbonated, it is what it is: above average macro."
"This beer beats BMC, but not by a mile."
"a few years ago I woulda put down a 6 pack no prob. Let's just say my appetite has deminished"
"Drinkability - This is certainly a drinkable beer. I don't see its tastes being too strong that the drinker would get tired of so definetely a plus for this macro. Worth a try if you're trying to find the best macro for you and is certainly worth the price."
"Molson Canadian Lager pours a typical macro yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Smells like grain, maybe some corn. Tastes like pretty standard fare macro lager. Corn and a little bit of hops in the finish. Not particularly good."
"Overall this is a pretty non-descript, bland and unimpressive beer--even by macro standards, which are admittedly low. I will give it some credit for having a bit of sharp bite on the tongue. Beyond that there is nothing going for this Canadian lager."
"Overall: A very average malty lager. Not recommended."
"Had this a little while ago. It is an easy to drink beer. Smells like a normal macro. Nothing really special about this beer except the double labels can be fun from time to time. It's alright just overpriced. I'm not going to go running out to pick up another case of this to soon."
"It was pale yellow in color with a small head of foam and that left some sticky lace after it receded. I didn't get much an aroma, but what I could smell was the slightest bit of malt and that's it. I thought the taste was pretty much average, but a little bit better than most macros. The only way I can describe the taste is, it was nice and crisp with a slight corn aftertaste at the end. The mouthfeel was light and kind of watery. Overall I thought this made for a nice cheap macro that I could drink again it I saw it for a $1 again."
"This is the type of beer that I like to pair up with pizza. I have a cheese pizza waiting and I'm confident these two will work well together."
"Pours a light golden color, some carbonation, small head, and a little bit of lacing afterwards. Scents of sweet malt. The taste is a watered down malt flavor, not much of an aftertaste. Light body. Drinkable I guess, but I had to try this again to see if I would like it."
"Mouthfeel is average. Better than the appearance led me to believe. Drinkability is tolerable."
"Anotheryellow beer with not so much head, taste is there if you can find it. Aroma, like every other yellow beer. Better than Bud, no green appleness, I will drink the twelve pack because it's there."
"Cheers!"
"Molson Canadian, in a can, Much better than a bottle for some reason. Poured into a glass to a quickly forming thin head that quickly dissipated. leaving some lacing and spotting on the top of the brew. Smells typical of a macro, mostly corn. Taste is pretty much representative of any big name macro, not terrible but not particularly impressive either. Mouthfeel is carbonation and water, with slight traces of hops in there somewhere. Quite drinkable actually, and this time I didn't walk away with a headache, for a change. Not a bad choice on the Golf Course or sitting on the patio with friends at a barbecue, not like I'll be doing that any time soon."
"Overall, I would say this is an okay beer. Definatly overhyped by the media (especially in Canada), but is average. I would categorize it as the Canadian Budweiser."
"A notch above the otehr big boy macro-lagers, but nothing to write home about."
"Pours an extra pale gold with pristine clarity. A three finger head of tiny bubbles will show fair retention and decent lacing. Grain adjunct nose with some euro hop aromas and a whiff of light malt. Sweet corn and pale malt taste. Hint of ester. Touch of skunk on the aftertaste balances well, but the flavor is a little corny even for a macro. Light body and medium carbonation keep the mouthfeel crisp, at the risk of becoming too thin and revealing the alcohol; but it finishes clean with a strangley addicting drinkability."
"Drinkability - Drinks okay. Heavier in the stomach than one might expect. Not awful."
"Very drinkable, crisp and clean. Good hot weather beer."
"Not that bad. Better than most of the American Macro Lagers that America puts out."
"I have been sampling a lot of different macros lately and i have to say that even by macro standards this one was very bland - extremely clean tasting, nothing offensive whatsoever, i now understand why friends who are bud light drinkers think this is ""really good"" beer. It does nothing for me, certainly not something for the Canadians to be proud of."
"I don't know if the nostalgia tied to this beer or if it truly is pretty good, for a macro, mass media consumed product, but to me it's pretty decent, I'll drink it without complaint. I don't buy this stuff other than on tap...which leads me to my next review..."
"This beer is highly carbonated and best served very cold. The smell is typical of american macro lagers. The taste is very mild and smooth with no bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very watery with lots of carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer and a favorite of mine while watching hockey."
"There are certainly cleaner macro lagers out there but i shall review. This was one of those gargantuan 24 ounce cans. This pours a light golden color (apple juice or piss) with a huge air carbonated head. The aroma is corny and sorta bleh chemically. This is crisp and light with not much hppage. The only thing keepign this tolerable is the sweetness. Not as clean as a pabst but much cleaner than a beast. Sorta drinkable."
"Drinkability: If I can drink a gallon of water in one sitting, I could nail a six pack of these without breaking a sweat. It's a decent enough beer for what it is. And you know, the trip to Niagara Falls wouldn't have been as good without them."
"My second favorite beer. I can't believe these reviews, this is one of the greatest beers ever made. If you love beer (especially canadian beer) then you are going to love molson canadian. This is a great beer, I highly recommend it. If I had the money I would buy this beer everytime, its that good. Pours a nice golden colour, with a frothy head. Molson canadian+buffalo pizza=bliss"
"The only reason I drank this was to re-affirm my reasons for moving to craft brews."
"poured a medium yellow color with white puffy head tthat quickly fell to minimal ring. Smell is slightly sweet with a hint of malt. Taste is clean and refreshing. Mouthfeel is not bad (but not really good either). An overpriced example of this style."
"I made the mistake of purchasing a six pack of this, based on a recommendation. Appearance is a golden orange, little foam and soon-gone lace. The aroma is dextrose and grain. Initial taste has a lot of carbonation and a sharp bite of something bitter, faint hops, cooked broccoli, and a little malt. Aftertaste is a dry sensation that is so-so. Might be good with food if nothing else available."
"I bought a sixer of this after I bought a sixer of LaBatt Blue. I wanted to see how the the only two beers I ever see from Canada here in the U.S compared with each other. Clear gold in color. Taste is thin grassy malt, nothing offensive. Not a lot of lacing. Barely leaves any aftertaste in mouth . I give it an edge over Labatt Blue, but just slightly."
"($15.99 / 28-pack)"
"Pours a one-finger white head that fades fairly quickly leaving no lace. Clear golden amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Skunky nose. Starts smooth and sweetish, faint hops in the background. Good lawnmower beer. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Drinkability- Ranks up ther with the Bud's and Coors of the world. Nothing to waste your money on, but not the bottom of the barrell either."
"Overall, it's a cut above some of the other macro lagers, but it's not fantastic. It's kind of in the middle, but it's easy to drink and it's simple. It's all right for kicking back and enjoying a ballgame."
"Tap: Poured alight yellow color ale with a small head with no retention. Aroma is quite weak with some malt being discernable. Taste is very smooth with no aftertaste (almost no hops) and watery feeling at the end. While it is in no way good it is not as worst as some other macro beer out there and this one probably benefited from the CO2 from the tap."
"Decent body and it goes down okay, but it's not the kind of beer I'd like to drink more than one of. If you're going to pay big bucks for an import, get something better."
"OK beer on par with most above average American Macros.."
"FWIW, the rear label says ""Help me christen my hot tub."" The only bragging seen on this beer is about the manufacturing of their labels, and that's appropriate."
"Its a Game of Inches on the label. Pale golden brew with a medium, white, slowly diminishing, frothy head. Noticeably lively carbonation, and good lacing. Smell is a typical adjunct stink out of the bottle, but the stink diminishes significantly after a minute or two. Maybe this wont be so bad after all. Now I can smell grain, grass, corn, and this really light buttery aroma. Taste is crisp, more grain, a little yeast toward the finish. The finish is short, crisp, and refreshing. Watery texture, light body, this is your typical adjunct. but its done well for what it is. Ill take this over Golden."
"Clear slightly lighter-than-medium-gold colored gold head is just not there, none, just some bubbles surfacing. Smell is not there, either if i had to guess it would just be a little corny maltiness. Taste is also sweet and malty. Just corn and adjunct everywhere in this one. Every bit as bad as American macros, but more expensive. Hooray for this beer!"
"Had with a basket of wings and fries. Sometimes, this beer has its place. Pours crisp and clean, pale yellow lager. Minimal head, grainy aroma. Mouthfeel is crisp and sharp on the tongue. Light bodied, easy drinking. No offensive off flavours. Taste of grain, malt, faint hops. It did it for me this night."
"Drinkability: Picked this over Golden due to the brown bottle. Its easy enough to drink and I have had this in the past, usually when the NHL playoffs are on and a Canadian team is playing a warm weather team like LA , San Jose, or Dallas. I just can't root for teams playing hockey in places it rarely (if ever) gets below freezing. Alas, no hockey, and probably no Molson beers for a year."
"Drinkability: A good choice for heavy drinking, but not for quality drinking ( whatever the ""premium lager"" label says)."
"As far as the style goes, not bad. I could easily knock back 2-3 of these after a day in the sun. Doesn't approach the level of a German lager, but beats Budweiser for sure."
"Also, worst christmas present EVER!"
"Pours a clear golden with a fluffy white tightly-packed head that actually has some retention, no lacing though. Smell was rather strong and I definitely smelled adjuncts... lotsa corn. Taste was surprisely good, a little too sweet for a lager imho, but smooth and easy-drinking for sure. Very grainy and corny, with a but of malts at the end, almost not finish, just a slight hoppy bitterness. This is very easy drinking, but it is a little too carbonated and it is giving me gas. Not a terrible adjunct lager."
"Overall-for what it is, this is a fine lager than beats most other adjunct lagers soundly, I would have no problem ordering it again, light and refreshing."
"Overall impression: I can't complain much since it was left in my fridge after a party. Better than a lot of the mass-market swill I have tasted, a good football/pizza beer."
"My stock beer. When all else fails at a local pub I order this beer. Good carbonation, golden amber color, balanced hops, and a creamy mouthfeel make this a standard beer, but not a standout. I always prefer a macro Canadian lager to a macro American so I am glad I live so close to the border that this beer can be regularly available."
"""I can bang that out in no time."" Likely what Molson does with beer. While not particurly bad, there was nothing particularly good. Only way to describe this beer is as real smooth. The hops are there, but very sweet and otherwise not very noticeable. The beer is pale in color. A lighter shade that the color of the bottle. However, while this beer is nothing special, it is very easy drinking and would make a good session beer."
"I only drink it if there is nothing else available. Refreshing after sports or for sitting in the sun."
"Yellow/Gold with a decent lasting and size in the froth-cap area. Smell average amounts of corn, some yeast and a tad bit of malt. Taste is above average for the style but not for beer in general. This is one of my standby beers when nothing else is available. Good for sessions, hanging out with friends, after the lawn is cut....etcetera. I like this beer so much I was lucky enough to have my father-in-law sneak some into my wedding reception for me. I like this as one of the macros and will always stick by it!"
"Bender Factor: This is VERY drinkable, but you have about 20 min to polish it off. Perfect for hanging out and drinking with your ""friends"" whichever gender they may be. I usually pick up a 12er after a night of drinking craft beer. I will only buy this when faced with the all the other standard gas station/ grocery store beers. fo"
"Went to the Harp, nice Irish pub. This was mad on sale at $6.50 a pitcher so who could go wrong? Poured light amber with a nice 2-3 finger head on the pitcher, I think the dude could have spouted more into the pitcher with less head but hey whatever. Smells of macroskunk with some wheatness, basically your run-of-the-mill macrobrew. Tastes slightly better than Budweiser, a little more watered down but not much skunk at all in the taste. Not much anything. Mouthfeel is comparable to other macros. It was OK, nothing to really complain about, nothing to really exalt. I'd drink it again for the price. A good benchmark for the macros."
"Pours a weak yellow with a surprisingly powerful, thick head. Smells of (pasteurized?) lager and not much else. Not impressed by mouthfeel; too carbonated and not full enough. Watery, almost syrupy afterfeel. Sweet, somewhat drinkable but lacking due to mouthfeel. I feel like I'm subscribing to the macro advertising campaigns, but it just...tastes...cold. Sweetness makes it tough to tell what the hops/malt balance is. Light and smooth helps drinkability, but carbonation makes it rough for drinking games."
"Had to have it. It was hot and there wasn't water only sugary soda pop as substitute. This is nothing special at all but at least I could swallow one or two gulps. Corn sweet Veggie, large carbonation, light malt, mildy bitter and sweet aftertaste as in most national Canadian beers."
"A clean lager that will quench thirst on a hot summer day. No hop or malt aroma, just the bread yeast aroma common to the BIGS. The beer is crystal clear golden yellow with a descent head. Clean flavor, no cidery, corn, or cabbage, and little body. Easy dinking clean and as they say ""refreshing""-true to style. I'm rating this for what it is, a Macro lager. Its not my first choice when hanging out with friends or enjoying a good meal, but its perfect for the golf course or a bal game."
"When in Canada and stuck with nothing but macro lagers, this is the beer to choose. There's not much to say about it except it's better than Miller, Coors, and Bud. It's crisp and refreshing without any highly offensive flavors from adjuncts. In Canada, I paired it with numerous types of food including Thai, sushi, and lunch at a Chinese restaurant in Victoria, B.C.'s Chinatown."
"The beer pours a nice clear light straw color with a good finger of head that disappears quickly. The smell has corn coming through strong with a bit of sweet malt in the background. Not bad for a macro. There is a major grainy corn flavor with a somewhat honey sweet finish from the malt. Again, for the style, this is not all that bad. At least there is flavor. The beer is light in my mouth, but not as watery as others. The carbonation is not over-done, making it nice in my mouth. This beer is easy to sit down and have a session with. The generic pilsner is not my favorite style by a long stretch, but this is one of the better I have had, so If you want something cheap and available, this is not a bad choice."
"Poured out a golden color, a tad darker than a US macro. head was pretty much white, frothy and large. settled to a film as i got throuhg the top half of the glass. Smell was faint. Corn adjunct? taste was mildly sweet, with a ""dried leaf"" taste to it. Mouthfeel was moderately thin but went down nicely. good for hot weather i imagine. Not a bad beer, step up from other macros, but not my favorite. Thanks for this one, but ill pass next time"
" It's kinda like drinking National Bohemian in Baltimore, or Iron City in Pittsburgh; when in Rome..."
"Clear, very pale yellow. The head retention was surprisingly good, and bright white lace was left behind on the glass. Very mild aroma, with a hint of corn. Initially crisp with plenty of carbonation. This settles into a mild, smooth sweetness, again with corn/adjuncts present. Hop bitterness is very faint and disappears towards the finish. Relatively clean and dry finish. Quite thin. Not a lot of flavour or character, but definitely better than many other macro-lagers."
"The beer itself is a light gold color with typical clarity for the style. The beer is heavily carbonated with an attractive puffy white head. There's essentially no aroma, except for a little corn-smell. The taste is sweet up front, with a heavy, corn-like adjunct quality. Medium to light body, with very little hop presence. I'd say it's better than a typical macro, but is uninspiring."
"I heard they make a 55 pack during hockey season or something canadain like not cans either bottles eh'"
"Like others, I bought this for the NHL playoffs ... it's about time some other brewer made a better statement in the hockey-beer sweepstakes."
"Meh, what can I say? A slightly less than average lager. Pours a golden color with moderate head. Smell is light of hops, nothing substantial. This beer is drinkable, with slight sweetness to the hops, but nothing out of the ordinary. Better then most macros, for what it's worth. Meh."
"12 ounce bottle, pours lame yellow and clear, medium sized bubbles. Corn aroma. Faint malt noticed, very minimal hops detected. lawn mower brew at best, this stuff is a waste of good water. Amazing to think that back in the day, this swill was considered "" the good stuff"""
"This beer pours a watery golden color with a small white head. Bubbles race to the top. Like Tballz, I got this to commemorate the beginning of the hockey playoffs. Smell is slightly grainy and maybe a little fruity, i dont know. Taste is on the sweet side. Most noticeable flavor is a sweet corn element. Finish is almost nonexistent. Better than the American macros but nothing to write home about."
"This brew is a very pale gold color brew, very clear, lots of carb bubbles rising up. Big bubbly white head. Scent is sweet malt. Taste is sweet and malt based, hint of hops. This beer is really similar to a high life style beer. Better than most macros but what does that really say right?"
"drinkability: on a hockey-oriented evening, you can pick up a sixer and you'll do well. after the initial drink, it is easy to drink 2 or 3 more."
"Poured a medium golden yellow with very little head. There is not much in the way of aroma, perhaps a slight corn scent to it and traces of malt. The overall taste is rather bland with a slight malt taste to it and hints of corn. There also is an ever-so-slight aftertaste that can best be described as hoppy. Mouthfeel is average due to the carbonation, which appears to by typical of most macros. The overall drinkability is also average at best and would probably be a good beer for when you are soaking up the sun rays in the summertime."
"Unless I'm at a hockey game or in the red light district in Montreal, I'm not touching this stuff. I do like my keepsake mini keg, which will reside with my other beer momentos."
"Overall- not bad, but not much to go on. I guess I can drink this without being too upset, but I am glad that the ""beers of the world"" sampler that this came in only had one of these. I am ready to finish this one and move on to something more interesting."
"Very quaffable brew, nothing bad about it, a solid if not world-class lager."
"The fizzy yellow stuff of the Great White North, as far as I'm concerned. Poured yellow with a fizzy white head that pulled a Houdini on me right away. You know what else is yellow? That's right, corn. Prominent in the aroma and taste, along with some traces of malt and hops. I was quite thirsty after a bout with US Customs, and this failed to satisfy. Difficult to finish."
"I loike to have this beer with ribs, or rack of lamb...I dont know mybe its just me but the taste reall goes well with them. I like them and as stated in a revirew before i would add it to the big 3. Good beer to have around. Malty smell with a dry carbonated mouthfeel."
"Molson Canadian Lager is a beer that is always stocked in my fridge. While not a great, supreme beer it is a far better lager than the so called Big 3. Molson Canadian pours a straw, pale yellow with a foamy almost bubbly head. The smell is of hops with faint smells of malts. The taste is better than most lagers, sweet taste with a dry finish. The mouthfeel is average, little carbonation with a dry taste. Molson is a very drinkable lager that is very nice to keep around for parties to give to the friends who usually have the Buds, Coors or Millers. Molson will give them a pleasant suprise."
"What can you say, eh? Nothing stupendous here. Actually, not much of anything. Still, I'd take it over one of the Big Three any day."
"The beer as it departs the bottle a quintessential limpid lager gold with the head modest in size, frothy in texture and the color a bright white, lace is adequate to cover the glass. Archetypal lager malt sweet, crisp and clean nose, start is sweet and fair to middling on the malt, top is thin in feel to the palate. Finish is strict in its acidity, hops apropos to the style, aftertaste quite dry and lingering. Its been 1253 days since I last sampled this beer, certainly not the worst lager Ive had in the last three and a third years."
"Drinkability  Better than I had hoped. I could almost consider this pretty good, and definitely worth a second look if Im slumming it at a macro-only bar that doesnt have Guinness."
"The beer pours a golden color with a spotty white lace head. The aroma is average. It boasts of pale malts and lager yeast. It seems to have a bit more malt character than most macro lagers. The taste is also average. It is clean and refreshing, but it finishes a bit bitter and skunky. There is a bit of light malty flavor, but it's not much. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. It drinks decent and is my fav. Molson offering."
"Ah, the joys of marketing, patriotism, and joking anti-Americanism. To be perfectly honest, I'm an average blue collar slob with limited knowledge of micros and imports (I came to BA to learn), but no one can tell me this isn't good beer."
"Charming ad campaigns in Canada, but the beer itself is just more macro brew for the masses."
"Molson, as far as a macro is concerned, does it right. Pours a crystal clear golden yellow colour with almost no head at all. Its aroma is also semi poor, consisting of corn and light malt. Tasting it is another story all together. I enjoy the taste. It has a sweet malt taste with light hints of corn. If the corn taste wasn't present, I would have rated it much higher. There is also a faint hoppy after taste. It's smooth going down and I would go as far as saying this could be a very refreshing beer after a long summer day on the roof."
"Molson Canadian was actually the first legal beer I ever had (Casino Niagara, age 20) and the first 6 pack I ever purchased (at the LCBO). This was one of my favorites back in those days, and having it now, after all these years, it's still a decent lager. A good macro, and certainly one I'd have when I had to have a macro."
"Not a bad Canadian brew, but i felt it was a bit lacking compared to it's authentic domestic Canadian counterpart (i.e. the kind you get in Canada is much better). Poured out to a pale yellow color with a short lived foamy head that dissolved in mere seconds. The taste was that of a traditonal lager, with flavors of oats and hops standing out. A strong flavor of alcohol was also present. All in all, not a bad brew, but nothing special in my opinion."
"This is a highly drinkable budget beer. Nothing to great or memorable, but nothing off or skunky either. At $10.50 per 12 pack at the local mega-grocery, it's accessible and certainly better than most macros."
"A drinkable brew if you want something simple..like I did tonight."
"Overall, this beer is not too darn bad for what it is, much better than any of the bigger American macros, but not too darn good either. I'll probably save this for gameday drinking and/or drinking on a budget."
"Most of my previous experiences with this beer have be much more negative. I am not going to run out to buy this in the future but it did ok."
"""Molson Canadian"" is a good beer. I prefer ""Molson Export"" but this stuff will do, especially when sitting around a campfire or at a party. It is certainly one of the better of the macrobrewed beers."
"Molson Canadian is my 'regular' beer (macro) of choice. My mother buys it for herself when she is feeling generous because she knows I'll drink some. There really isn't anything special about the beer, no distinct flavors or anything, but I think it tastes infinitely better than bud. It is a refreshing brew when you just don't want to think about what you're drinking!"
"Of all mass produced pale lagers out there this one is one of the best (not saying much)out there.Pours a straw color with adecent little head that even leaves some lacing.Aroma has a sweetish tinge to it,taste has a decent malt accent to it pretty firm,there is a light sweet flavor.You know this isnt a incredibly bad beer when I dont have alot of money or want a case from my father-in-law I get Molson Canadian."
"Overall: Nothing outrageously spectacular, but I have to say that if I was stuck with the choice of the usual Bu-Co-Mill-ite offerings from the US and this, I would definitely choose this. Nevertheless, it still remains a just above average, widely available, mass-produced pale lager."
"Poured a straw gold with a fizzy medium white head. No lace what so ever. Aroma was very faint. Taste is a typical canadian macro, slight malt hops and somewhat corny. It is crisp and refreshing, and I can drink tons of this stuff. I admit this is not a great beer, its brewed for the masses. I have a soft spot in my heart for Canadian as I grew up in Buffalo and in Buffalo we drink this and Labatts - not that Bud stuff. This is my house brew as pretty much everyone enjoys it."
"Tapped off a clear light golden color with a white 1/2"" head that goes to a fine lace fairly fast. Started crisp with that unique Canadian hop bitterness then balences out with malty sweetness on the palate then finishes fairly clean with only a slight lingering malty taste coupled with that ""unique"" hop finish. I cannot describe that hop taste that Canadian has but it is the unique character of this beer that identifies it. I personally don't like it but I don't dislike it and as a draft beer Canadian is preatty well balenced enough to drink with most foods."
"The taste is exactly what you might think. Light and crisp. The flavor is dominated by grains with a very faint, almost imperceptable bitterness. A very good mouthfeel makes this a good sessiion beer."
"Aroma upon opening the bottle was of rubber and skunk. That went away mostly, thankfully. Pours to a sudsy white head that falls to a ring around the glass with bits of foam sticking around. Light yellow -amber color. Aroma in the glass was of sweet grain and faint notion of hops (at least more tham most american yellow lagers). Taste was sweeetish but balanced, kind of bland. Finishes clean, with residual corn sweetness and bitterness. It stunk when I opened it but after that it was average."
"Added Notes: This is much better and more fresh in Canada. Although in Quebec and Montreal I have only seen this in bottles and cans, not on draft!!! In Toronto however, this is on draft everywhere!"
"When this beer was poured, it formed a medium sized white creamy head with fine-medium sized bubbles.The body of this beer was clear and the hue was light orange.This beer left very little lacing on the sides of my glass.The nose was sweet and somewhat fruity and the flavor was sweet, slightly hoppy and somewhat sour.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth, flat, watery and it was a light-medium bodied beer.This beer definitely lacks character as nothing stood out about it."
"That corn smell seems enhanced when in the can. I thought this was a beer, not a vegetable stand. Canadian poured this fizzy yellow colour with no head. Very carbonated. Must be an attempt to keep this fresh. Smelled of corn, barley and no hops. Tasted of corn, little barley, no hops. Overcarbonated mouthfeel. Sort of a fizzy soda. Drinkable when the weather is hot, your sweating like a ferret at a sausage factory and you need something cold."
"This is my standard when it comes to macros, great hot weather/barbecuing low cost filler. Pours with a decent foamy white head that eventually fades, and is a little too pale for my liking, although lots of carbonation. Aroma of grainy malt and the smallest touch of hops. Flavour is of grainy sweet malt, bit of a sweet grainy aftertaste, not bad at all for a macro, it's drinkable enough. Better than any American macro I've ever tried. Thems not fightin' words, thems the facts."
"From the home kegorator. Pours a light tellow with a fairly decent white head and good lacing. Smell was pretty corny with lots of adjuncts and not too much complexity or finesse. The taste is clean and lager like. Nice and crisp without trying to do what it can't do. Sure I would rather have a cask of Dreadnaught in my living room, but at this point its a little infeasible and Molson ain't half bad(light years ahead of the American Big 3), especially for its price. It cuts through spicy sausage really well."
"I like this beer. A few months ago I was at a bar and saw this beer. I tried it and was really surprised. The taste is a wonderfull corn flavour. Compared to American Macro beers this stuff is awesome. Not as good as a ice cold german beer but this is a good every day beer. And for 4 10 dollars for 12 bottles you can't beat the price."
"As noted, this was, in my view an exceptionally tasty standard lager, and went very well with the snacks at the memorial day party. If you find one of these 5L cans fresh, pick one up for your next gathering."
"Opted for this at a restaurant where the steaks are great, but the beer selection isn't. Overall, this is your typical macro lager."
"Molson is one of those beers u see at the 711 but always say ""I'll buy that next time."" Its one of those beers that not a helluva lot of Americans buy, but it is still damn good beer. Never had a bad experience with it. I often use it on hamburger meat to tenderize the burgers. One of my favorite imported beers."
"Poured light golden in color with a white head. Aroma consists of grain, corn and has a mild sweetness to it. Mouthfeel is thin and rather crisp, including a noticeable sharpness felt on the tongue. Taste is very lackluster. Light on the hops. Odd sweetness to the finish, presumably from the corn and whatever other adjuncts are in it. Even worse, it wasn't chilled in the fridge long enough before it was given to me, which made it all that much more unpleasant."
"Nevertheless (grin), I *did* rate Molson's Canadian a solid two points. I guess it's as good as the next thirst-quencher, and it sure beats the heck out of water."
"What else can I say but that this beer is CLEAN. So clean you could probably take a bath in it. Quite refreshing and easy to drink. Perhaps it's a little too clean in the flavor department, but I'll take this over Bud any day. Probably makes a good ""hockey and pizza beer"" as well."
"An adequate beer that beats most American macros with its better grain sense and better coloration. A good gold color with hints of red and a bit of lacing from the small white head. A clear, clean, and crisp beer with some forced carbonation and splash of hops to add interest to the grain sweetness. A drinkable beer for a summer thirst; best at cooler temperatures."
"Pours yer typical macro color - an off yellow with a skunky, cooked veggie smell, not very impressive up front. Initial taste of adjuncts, not sure how else to explain, other than a slight and ever slight hoppy feel to it, this one gets better as I drink it. A finish of smooth, slightly dry lager, pushing on the smooth side, this one is maybe a baby step up from the macros, but not much."
"Medium golden color with lots of carbonation and small, broken lace. The head is quite decent when poured, alas, it retains but poorly. Aroma of cooked vegetables and faint hops. Taste begins with smooth carbonation and slightly sweet light malt; alcohol notes appear midway through the taste. Finishes dry with a mild flourish of hops. This is not a great beer, but it is tasty and very drinkable"
"Easy to drink and it went well with the brat & kraut I was eating. I don't think I would turn this beer down, but I won't search it out either."
"Canadian is tolerable from a well chilled mini-keg, but poor at best from a bottle. A cheap buzz and a crowd pleaser for the non-beer advocate; could be much worse than it is."
"this one pours out a clear, slightly darker than average gold color. big foamy head reduces to a fine lace. slight malt and adjuncts in the nose. tastes slightly sweet, grainy, and earthy. somewhat crisp mouthfeel, refreshing finish. an all around pretty average lager...a step ahead of the american macro's, but on par with the other canadian lagers. how can screaming canadian hockey fans be wrong?"
"Tasted was crisp and it was well carbonated. Mouthful was light and there was no aftertaste. On a hot day this beer would satisfy my thirst. Its a little ahead of Bud and other like Bud. Good beer to have around and pass out to the fellas."
"Having lived in Canada my whole life, this beer has been simply unavoidable. That said, there are worse beers to be unable to avoid - it's not a bad beer, just a bland beer. Certainly it is highly drinkable - there is nothing to object to about it. The taste is better than many of its counterparts, such as Bud, Coors, and Labatt's equally ubiquitous Blue. Basically, it lacks any outstanding characteristic - bland in colour, smell and taste. I only wish Molson would redirect a fraction of the creativity they express in their TV advertising into brewing their beer."
"Pours a pale golden hue with the same white fizzy head macros are known for, chalk full of adjuncts. In my opinion, one of the better Canadian macro lagers that gives off a faint hop yet malty aroma. A very mellow flavor, not much going on here. What this beer does have is a very sweet finish of mostly two row malt, and the fact that it goes down very easy. A beer that is capable of being drunk in mass quantities, but it doesn't have me wanting another one for pure enjoyment. Overall, far from a great beer yet much better than most American macros."
"Pale yellow and clear with an adjunct white head that sticks bubbles to the side of the pint glass. No head duration or lace. Aroma is nowhere, a corn field in an adjoining State at best. Slight sense of Brazil nut nuttiness but little persistence to this impression. Dryish and slightly soapy finish, hops balance the inadequate malts decently. Whew, slightly better than the Golden as a Lager has somewhat less of a flavor burden to live up to, but carbonation wins the day in giving this brew any uniqueness. To me, another not recommended beer."
"This is a good lager, not a great one, just good. Colour is light and has a nice crown when poured which leaves to a slight ring around the glass interior. A medium body which makes it easier to consume larger numbers of this brew in one sitting. It is a light tasting product and well balanced with no lingering reminders."
"This beer doesn't look too bad, nice clear golden color with a thin pure white head that fades very fast. Not big in the aroma department, a bit grainy, like wheat or corn, no real malt smell and just a dash of hops. Taste is ok, just a bit more hop flavor than your average American macro, and not as much bad adjunct aftertaste. Nothing great here but drinkable in a pinch."
"BTW The Flyers lost that night and the date turned out to be a one-night deal."
"Decent deep gold color. Spontanaeous bubbling is nil and, when forced, the liquid eeks out a fat gas unit or two.  Aromas of liquified canned corn peek through a respectable flank of ripe barley, toast and wilted greens. Flavors are on the sweet side before wheat germ and tin flavors quickly clean it up. The whole thing goes downhill rapidly as it warms. Not a good sign."
"Pretty much Canadian ""Bud"". A decent lager, tastes ok, not too hoppy. Goes good with the Bruins, only if they are playing in Canada and you are there. Also good on St. Catherine Street."
"Notes: Better than Bud, Miller or Coors. Nothing spectacular though it is an all around good lager that quenches the thirst. A definite brew to pair with pepperoni pizza."
"I really do not care for this beer or any molson beer, it gives me really bad gas.  Light color and body with no hops or malt just a bunch of corn and rice.  My mother in law comes and she brings the crap, so i have to drink it and my wife puts up with the gas."
"This Molson Canadian lager is so unique for its style I just am almost at a loss for words. I am picking up some tart (sour) and sweet with hints of a toasted something or another. Major unorchestrated eclectic stuff going on here."
"For me, this was just one of those beers I didn't want to try because it just looks like it's going to be bad. Maybe it's the pseudo-generic labeling, who knows. Either way this was not very good. Crispness was about all it had going for it."
"This beer poured a light yellow color and formed a small bubbly white head that left little lace as it quickly subsided. An aroma of hops and grain. A flavor of hops and bread/dough. A very light body and clean finish. Of the macrobrews available to us in the U.S. from Canada, I find this one to be the most drinkable. It may be a poor rendition of what the Canadians have available to them, until the laws change, our choices are limited."
"Lits of rice and corn in thiss one.. not much malt or hops.  Not undrinkable.. just not impressive in any way.  The beer is quite plain tasting and needs malt badly.  As a result there is no real body to the beer."
"Reminds me of watching many nights of ""Hockey Night in Canada"" on CBC. Pale in color, slightly sweet, light twang of hops on the finish, somewhat grainy. A highly drinkable and decent lager and one I pick up from time to time. Not a flavor powerhouse, but a sentimental favorite as its my beer of choice at Red Wing's hockey games."
"Before the craft beer movement, this brew was a regular purchase on beer runs to Canada. Much fresher and tastier than the US import version."
"Smooth and well balanced.  Consistent from start to finish.  This is the beer that comes to mind when I think of the typical Canadian lager."
