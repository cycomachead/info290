Not that it matters. you drink a few bottles of natural ice you forget all about the flavor. Trust me, this stuff will f**k you up. They go down incredibly easy cold anyway. Don't do what i did and accept a wager to drink it hot without puking.  Its pretty awful hot. Then again, what beer isnt? had a Sierra Nevada Pale ale ice cold, beats all of these things ive rated. once it gets warm, its just as bad.","Alestorm4069","Dec 08, 2014"

I found out that my now ex-girlfriend is a dirty lying bitch and I am really poor so I bought a case of this the other night. I was forced to drink garbage. It got me drunk, didn't take away any of my problems, and made me feel like hell the next day. But when you drink all but a handful of the whole case in one sitting, any beer is bound to do that to you. For the price, Natty isn't to shabby.","jifigz","Sep 12, 2012"

It's one of the cheapest beers I can think of, being $14 for a 30 can case and it continues to get better and better. Yes, the taste isn't extremely lovable but once you get through it, they continue to get better and better, by the third one, it tastes delicious. To me, the taste is somewhat similar to maybe a bud ice or budweiser, though the only discourse I have is about the 153 calories that are found in the 5.9& Natural Ice. This is while Natural Ice with a 4.2% is a less calorie intake beer though takes a bit longer to dirnk.","David_Summers","Jul 30, 2012"

Taste matchs the nose quite well, steamed veggies, corn, and a sweet residual malt character. I'm actually happy to say that a friend that works for AB gave me seven cases, which a few have a couple broken bottles inside.

Overall this smells weak and kind of lame. I can't taste much, but this just isn't good. It's kind of sweet with dry grains to the pallet. Honestly, I've had more flavorful water.

Well, I didn't notice much of a smell at all coming from the 12 oz. can but taste is harsh if you're not used to it. Fittingly, it has the taste of something you're drinking solely to get drunk.

In fact, A-B is the standard bearer for the clarity test. Their products are generally so bright that nothing else could possibly measure up. Sadly, I drink for taste and not for looks. Mouthfeel was medium with a mild sweetness on the tongue. The finish, however, was wickedly sweet with that perfume-y/gummy/ scented soapy taste just lingering well past the swallow. Ugh.

I wouldn't recommend sitting down to enjoy one, especially with a meal.

At fist pour it appears a very light yellow and has a quick fading head with just about no lacing to it. The aroma is quite skunky in my opinion, and as far as flavor goes it was like drinking budweiser on crack. It is clear to me that this beer was produced with college kids in mind.

It does maintain a thin surface covering, however, and leaves some very slight lace momentarily following each sip. The nose is clean with a light touch of apple. The body is medium/light and it's nicely crisp on the tongue due to its fine, effervescent carbonation. Sweet adjunct-laden malt dominates the flavor; balanced by an underlying bitterness that's accentuated by it's crisp carbonation. It finishes semi-dry with some residual sticky malt about the mouth. Well made, but not very interesting.","NeroFiddled","Jun 05, 2003"

Suprisingly the taste is very comparison to all other ice beers I have tried. Even better than bud ice. The beer is very drinkable compared to all other ICE beers on the market, however if you never try this beer you haven't missed anything.

Smelled of cream corn and chemicals. If you sniff hard enough, some malt is detected, but that may be your imagination trying to let you down easy that this is another bad beer. Tasted bland. Something artificially sweet about it. Aspartame? Very carbonated. Reminded me of drinking a soda that has just been shook up, beat up, kicked and dropped.
