5,152.5,,,,,,"This is incredibly Cheap beer. Bought a 6 pack just because i wanted beer. Wasn't really expecting much. I don't drink normally, and when i do its either coors extra gold or Coors Banquet. Honestly this is a flavorful Cheap beer. Sometimes i come home after a long days work. I don't spend a ridiculous amount on Booze of any sort, I just want the flavor of beer sometimes. I drank this. After a long 10 hour shift of physically demanding work in  a warehouse walking constantly all day for 4 to 5 days a week, this is so good. Also i enjoy these with fishing. I admit i'm biased as this was my first beer. Certainly Beats budweiser and its cheaper. I never have had anything too expensive. Sam adams was the most expensive. Coming home on Night shift, and buying this, and drinking one ice cold, it seems so good. Certainly would buy this over bud light.  Bought this drank it ice cold, it certainly makes A nice refreshing beer. for 15 bucks for a 30 pack or 6  for a 12 pack, you can't go wrong. Craft brew drinkers should probably stay away because they like better taste and more hops. But for a guy who just drinks a beer for refreshment, this will do the trick better than bud light, mainly because bud light is more expensive and doesnt have any flavor. Honestly this is better than budweiser. Can't go wrong with it. i buy one every night after work. put in the freezer for a bit. Then I drink it, and it is just a delicious refreshment that goes down smooth crisp and clean. I substitute this with Busch Light or Coors light sometimes. Don't spend a lot of money on booze because i'm saving up for a house. So this is good. When i usually buy coors light this beats that and doesnt have the metallic taste.","Alestorm4069","Dec 07, 2014"

For those evenings (or days, or nights) I feel like a beer that goes down easy and still provides some marginal flavor, Busch is a sure ticket.

2.88,45.5,3,2.5,3,3,3,"Kind of nostalgic about Busch because I drank a lot of it in college and somehow developed a taste for it. You've got to be thirsty to appreciate it. Light mouth feel and rather high carbonation make it a good "beverage" beer, especially refreshing after mowing the lawn in 90-degree heat, or with picnic food outside on a hot day. Almost borders on being a "lite" beer. Kind of a sour aftertaste, but not that bad. Best when drunk quickly, not a beer to be nursed by the connoisseur. Somehow I prefer it to Bud and Coors. This is not a great beer, but one of the most drinkable cheap beers - 12-packs are sometimes on sale for $6.95 at the local Rite Aid. Can't beat that.","Crymar","Jul 09, 2014"

Sure its far from great, its really mediocre and a decent choice if you're tight on money. Its also not bad to drink all day while fishing.

I was really surprised how easy and drinkable Bucsh Beer is and the lack of hangover it produced. It pours light golden, with average carbonation, and a light head. It has a ricey, malty taste, with hints of wheat and sweetness. There is a little edge, with an average aftertaste, and it is not very filling. It's not the worst beer, but not the best beer either, good for when your working out in the hot sun...","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","Apr 09, 2014"

This beer is one of my alternative cheap AALs, especially in summer. Something to grab when in you're in a small town without much selection and the price is right.","archyquaffer","Mar 22, 2014"

The dms did creep on to the palate in sufficient amounts to keep from wanting another one of these.

1.97,-0.5,1.5,2,2,2,2,"An American adjunct lager brewed here in Canada on license by Labatts. Accepted a generous offer of a can, figuring what the heck, I haven't tried this one and frankly wouldn't go out of my way to do so. Why not capitalize? Perhaps the most translucent beer I have yet to see, almost clear with just the barest hint of pale straw tint. Massively over-carbonated as would be expected, standard fizzy soda water approach to imbibing alcohol that caters to mainstream palates. Hey, it is what it is. Its an affront to good beer but we still live in a world where a preference for mediocrity and playing it safe drive people's decisions. For what its worth, this beer tastes like corn, some stale grainy malt, maybe a little shortbread sweetness, some green grass, but its all buried under bubbles and this brew is outstanding in its major lack of conspicuous flavors. The "longer brewing process" seems to have napalmed all the flavor along with the dreaded calories. I have had adjunct lagers where you can at least taste said adjuncts. I did taste more sweetness and cooked flavors as it warmed up, but alas here's where the cardboard and plastic cutlery notes also emerge. Crisp clean finish is an asset I suppose, although here some grainy alcohol still crashes the party. Really quite fucking awful but the sweet ain't so sweet without the sour, yes?","CalgaryFMC","Nov 21, 2013"

I'm very fortunate to have gotten this in a can that declares "Busch Classic" and "Limited Edition", so I'm not one of the suckers that bought the regular version of this gem, I got a special can.

Typical pale American lager. Plenty of carbonation but not too much. Little or no aroma. Flavor starts as completely neutral/neuter with a hint of nothingness. A slight malt flavor begins to kick in. It is a pleasant pale malt flavor without a hint of any toasted quality. I wish there was more of it. This flavor fades quickly to more neutral hints of nothingness in the finish.

I'm not sure if it is the fulfillment of a stereotype or simply mere happenstance that I was drinking Busch beer at many of the quintessential moments in my young life, including the moment my Buick's rear window was shot out at a party in the Ocala National Forest. However, in retrospect I can tell you that as far as adjunct lagers go, Busch holds a special place in my heart . . . and, objectively, a higher rating than trash like Natty and Miller Light. As others have stated, it definitely gives you less of a hangover, as long as you stay under the "twelve-pack-in-one-night" limit. There is a reason that there is a "Busch" beer and not an "Anheiser" beer; somewhere along the line, In-Bev must have realized that when it comes to cheap beer, people prefer short names and complex connotations. It's almost poetic, when you think about it. "Go to the Mountains with Busch."","schnauzeborne","Jul 08, 2013"

Just more forgettable. But at $4.99 for a 6pack of 12oz cans you can't go wrong in this case. Appearance wise it looks like a pale lager when poured into my Beerfest replica 36oz boot. Very similar to other beers like Rolling Rock, Budweiser, PBR, etc. Smellwise its rather weak. Slight bit of barley but not too much going on. Tastewise its rather smooth and watery. Almost like a light beer but more ballsy. And between you and I...it goes down easy while not provoking a hangover the next day like many other cheap beers. Overall its a good goto beer for budget minded folks looking for a smooth inoffensive beer. In most cases you will get more than your moneys worth.","bullseyestrat","May 25, 2013"

Busch is alright by light beer standards (a low bar, I grant you), but it's just too bland and watery to deserve credit as anything more than that. Sorry, it just doesn't taste like anything, and one of the things I look for in my beers is flavour - yes, even the adjunct lagers. If you don't like the taste of beer, then I guess you could consider switching from Bud/Coors Light to this and maybe save a few bucks. Easy to drink en masse, but there isn't a beer drinker alive who couldn't find something better, even for inebriative purposes.","thehyperduck","Apr 07, 2013"

4.67,135.9,1.5,4.5,5,5,5,"first off my group of friends drinks way too much shitty beer so this review is mostly in comparison to other shitty beers. purchased a 30 pack for a party, we usually buy keystone or miller high life. busch has a bit more taste than coors or keystone and doesnt give me a headache once i drink 14 of them like keystone will. they are easy to shot gun and i really dont mind the taste especially compared to the metallic flavor of miller. my uncle always drank busch in front of me and when i was a teenager he would give me one sometimes and reefered them "alaskan sodas". il admit its a little bit like drinking urine but they go down easy and it gives you something to do in the form of drinking and peeing all night long instead of getting too fucked off the bat. its also nice to take a couple tequila shots and then get to fine tuning your drunk and eventually passing out/ puking and you dont look like as much of a pussy drinking busch as you would rolling rock but im rambling and busch is goood","masteB","Aug 19, 2012"

The aroma of this brew is somewhat skunky, fermented grain? Light in body, this lager has a very watery and thin mouthfeel- Sweet cooked corn, some slight hop flavor and mild bitterness. Overall, not a very good beer, even for the standard of American Adjunct Lager.","GossageBrewery","Aug 06, 2012"

Foamy 1 inch head that falls to a 1/8" layer with small bits of foam clinging to the glass (could hardly call it "lace") Aroma is CO2 and cooked corn. Flavor is much like the aroma. There are other beers for the price that have more flavor in terms of both malt and hops. This is a faint corn adjunct and seltzer flavor with a dry, and veggie finish. Mouthfeel reminds me of cheap 3.2 beer. Watery and flat. Overall, this beer is not terrible tasting it just tastes like beer made for people who do not like beer.","EagleTalon","Aug 03, 2012"

2.49,25.8,1.5,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"This is probably one of my favorite commercial beers. It's very light and very drinkable. The main difference between this and Budweiser is Busch is made with corn and not rice. Makes it a bit heavier than Budweiser, yet still a very light, pale lager. Taste is light, a bit of citrus, but mostly corn. Pale, pale, pale yellow in color, I would recommend this beer for something with a heavy taste like pizza or hotdogs. Something that beer goes good with, but something you don't really want to waste a great beer on.","wodanick","Jul 30, 2012"

This one of those beers that I call “Beer Flavored Water.” On a hot summer day I’m sure you’ll be thankful to have a Busch if you are out of every other form of liquids but that’s about it.

I don't know why they even bother to make Busch Light when Busch has an ABV of only 4.6%. You aren't going to catch a buzz off of this one, which is another reason to go for the Ice version at the same price. This beer serves as a pretty good palate cleanser and goes good with non-fancy food (BBQ, wings.) At $14.99 for a 30 pack things could be worse.","troobie","Jun 30, 2012"

It might not keep up with PBR or Schlitz but it wont be embarrassed by them either. Heavily underrated owing to anti-A-B sentiment and, I suspect, its redneck image. But the brew itself, particularly given the price, has nothing to apologize for.","Rumpole","May 12, 2006"

One thing that is striking about this can is the NASCAR schedule (I'm not a fan although the races can be kind of exciting if you are channel surfing and you catch the end of the event) and a few notes on the can. One is "Natural Aging - Natural Carbonation" which struck me as kind of funny. How do you do artificial aging anyway? with a time machine? And the natural carbonation part is kind of weird too. This beer isn't bottle conditioned (or can conditioned). I supposed maybe AB recycles their yeast fermentation CO2 and uses it somehow. Anyway, on to the beer. this one's aroma is a bit more assertive than Coors Light or Bud Light, although remember we are talking about relative things here. There is a slightly floral note along with a stronger hint of cereal, particularly corn as far as I can tell. The beer has perfect clarity and a pale golden color - it may be a tad darker than the light beers I had in this session (Coors Light and Bud Light). The flavor is more robust than the light beers, featuring a sweetness that is less cloying than the Bud Light and stronger than the Coors - it may be corn-derived, as it definitely isn't a strong malty sweetness. There is also a bit more hop note to the beer.","KroMagnon","Aug 02, 2003"

2.33,17.7,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"A crystal clear and very light straw colored body is topped by a decent-sized head of creamy, bright-white foam. The retention is good and it maintains a creamy collar as well as leaving some transient lacing just above the level of the beer with each sip. The nose is limited but reveals a very mild note of malt amongst a light fruitiness. The body is light and it's quite crisp in the mouth due to a very fine median carbonation. The flavor reveals little more than the nose suggests, however, the limited amount of malt that's there does combine nicely with the mild fruitiness. It's not bitter, but it is highly attenuated leaving nothing behind to need balancing. There's obviously a good deal of adjunct being used here. Of course, this beer isn't about being a flavorful beer - it's about being a beer without flavor. It's obviously intended as a beer that can be consumed in mass quantities without leaving anything on the palate; and it succeeds with the exception of the alcohol that's necessarily present. Of course, the people that are drinking this are obviously looking for alcohol over flavor. It's very well crafted, but lacking in character. For my money, I'd rather have a light beer.","NeroFiddled","Jun 18, 2003"

But the attraction stops once the liquid is poured out. Very clear, straw coloring filled the glass, and the tiny head disappeared in about a minute. The generic light "beer" scent of faint malt and hops drowned in adjunct and funkiness comprised the smell. The taste was of a watered-down pilsner, with a bit of malt and a strange tartness to it. While I wasn't as repulsed as I am with other macros, there still was so much to be desired here. The thin, slightly carbonated water feel was equally unimpressive. Busch reminds me of summers at my uncle's farm. I can easily drink this beer to him and to these memories, but beyond this fondness, it remains a less than mediocre beer.","SchmichaelJ","Apr 18, 2003"

So, it holds a special place in my heart, not a high place just a special place. This is my first Busch in the bottle and it's also my first Busch I have poured from a bottle or can other than from a keg into a plastic cup. So, here we go with a barely yellow faintess and very fizzy white head, this beer is definitely better tasting than Budweiser. No real hop aroma here just some malt sweetness with some corn and rice adjuncts tossed in along with a lot of artificial carbonation. It tastes mostly of sweet corn and rice adjuncts with a mild bitterness on the end classic American light lager. Very watery mouthfeel but that's all this beer attempts this is the reason our country is known for beers like this. When Budweiser tastes worse than their beer that is supposed to be swill, then you have a problem.
