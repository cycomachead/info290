One of those beers that take son a different personality when doctored up with lime and salt, but unadjusted it is a fairly fizzy joint that lacks taste. What's there is corned up and barely bitter.

Might just be the most dull beer I've yet to sample. At least skunk tastes like something. There's a corn syrup sweetness and that's about all. Watery body that is oddly coupled with fairly mellow carbonation ... Usually thin beers are fizzy. If one really and truly focuses there's a grassy hop note. Shouldn't be this hard though. Far too sterile and stripped down, although some might rank it above its countrymen due to a lack of clear cut flaws. Its hard to criticize a performance when the performer takes no risks.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 07, 2015"

Tecate is a filtered brew; you can see right though it. This looks an American style lager. This brew smells like corn and grains. Nothing bad, but not good. I would say the smell is decent to this brew. The taste to this brew is real nice. It goes nice and smooth. This reminds minds me of an American style lager. There is nothing overpowering in this brew has a nice balance and taste. Mouthfeel is nice and clean and refreshing. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. This better than what I was expecting.

Having survived on nothing but high IBU IPA's for months, I bought a 12-pack of Tecate, wanting something cold and refreshing that serves it's duty then goes away without making a big relationship out of things the way IPA's are want to do. And for a fling, Tecate is the way to go. Crisp and slightly dry with soda crackers, toasted white bread and other innocuous starches being the main flavors detected. Finishes extremely clean, slight hop flavors but also no big adjuncts either. Corn/vegetable husk is not a discernible flavor. Possibly rice, which also may be why this brew finishes so dry. This beer gets low ratings because it is ubiquitous and macro, not because it tastes bad. One of the better warm weather beers you'll find, and surprisingly good.","Aaron_Ramson","Apr 03, 2014"

The flavor is watery, with a weak malt sweetness and no appreciable hop flavor or bite. PBR or Bud has this brew beat by a mile.

This lager poured a pale straw color, produced a thin white head, poor retention and below average amount of lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this lager has some suggestions of grain and hops- not much to talk about on that front. Light in body, the lager features some malted grain, some sweet notes, and just a touch of citric hops at the finish. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, slightly dry finish. Classic, low quality mexican lager, probably no better and no worse then the others. Something I tried once but won't buy again in the future. Prost!","GossageBrewery","Sep 12, 2012"

My mexican-american girlfriend (who became my wife) taught me to drink it from the can and squeezing a lime onto the rim. On many a visit to Mexico we would enjoy Tecate with limes. After moving back to the East coast I would always keep cans of Tecate around to enjoy with Mexican food. Recently it seems to have changed to a hoppier formulation that has less malt, probably due to the use of the more cost effective hop extract most commercial North American brewers have adopted as a substitute to using real hops. In any case, we have stopped drinking Tecate and switched to other smoother adjunct lagers.","wattoclone","Sep 12, 2012"

Mouthfeel was smooth but very watery. Though....it was pretty smooth going down, and it didn't have a skunky or boring Mexican beer flavor. Actually tasted like a fresh lager, so I'll rate the drinkability a bit higher. Went nicely with a meal of grilled chicken fajitas. Since this six pack was almost a $1 cheaper than other south of the border options, it was not a bad choice at all.","morebeergood","May 06, 2010"

The taste is like the aroma, but a little milder. There is still nice complexity, but it would be nice if it came out a little more as it did in the aroma. The mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very pleasant surprise.

There is a definite ""Mexican"" taste in the beer's finish - somewhat similar to Corona, but more pronounced. It is the finish that saves this beer from just being another Miller or Budweiser. On a hot day it is drinkable - especially after you've had too many to care what you are drinking. Pouring it out of a can into a Pilsner glass brings out more flavor - highly suggested that you do NOT drink it straight from a can.

Bubbles form randomly on the bottom of the glass and float to the surface. Smells potently hopped with something like Saaz that would impart a tin smell. To many people this comes across as smelling 'skunked'. Tastes mildly hoppy with noticable malt sweet. Hops have some hallertauer roundness and a touch of co-ho roughness. Malt is pretty clean, but has some honey. Upopn swallowing there is an acrid taste from carbonation release. This sting on the tongue settles fairly rapidly and leaving some floral hop and some flat malt sweet as an aftertaste. Body is thin, but with some quality I can't put my finger on that makes it come across, to casual taste, as Md-light. Carbonation is high. Amazingly, there is still a tiny layer of head still on top of the last little bit in my glass and the inside of my glass shows incredible lacing. Judged to style.","mentor","Jul 30, 2005"

3.18,26.7,3,2.5,3,4,4,"Drinkability: a good swiller, I prefer it over Corona if I'm in the mood for Mexican macro-swill, Negra Modelo wears the crown when it comes to beer from ""South of the border"" though","GreenCard","May 08, 2003"
2.93,16.7,2.5,2,3,3,4,"This guy has a fair fluffy white head. Real clear, paler gold color. its about what you would be expecting from a mexican lager. Not that great tasting, but on a nice hot day you could put down a ton of them. Better than corona anywho... Not recommended, not the worst either.","Tballz420","May 01, 2003"
3.38,34.7,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Color is golden pale yellow with no head from pouring, a few clearish bubbles sit around the edge. Smells very faintly of spiced sweet malt, no hop presence what so ever. Taste is more of the same, very slightly spiced sweet malt and no hop to be found. Its very clean, crisp, and lightly refreshing. Feel is a bit more medium body but lacks in roundness. Mostly watery malts. Easy drinker, but stick with Dos Equis.","tavernjef","Apr 08, 2003"
3.22,28.3,4,2,3.5,3,4,"Pours a clear golden in color with a lingering white head. Aroma is feint with some hints of grain and hops. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. Light malt sweetness on the tongue with a very mild hop, yet rather clean finish. Goes down easy on a warm day or to wash down some spicy Mexican food. Nothing fancy, just a clean tasting Mexican beer that provides a decent alternative to Corona.","Winter","Apr 06, 2003"
2.5,-0.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Grabbed a bunch of big bottles at the store and this was among them. Pours pretty plain, very little head, no lacing. Taste is grainy, hard to find any hops. The taste is only lightly malty. It is crisp tasting and refreshing. This is much better than other Mexican beers. Prefer this to Crapona anyday.","Rifrafboy","Mar 27, 2003"

2.42,-3.6,4,2,2.5,2,2.5,"We went to our local Mexican restaurant tonight and my wife ordered a Bicardi and Diet Coke and got a Tecate and a large Diet Coke. So I drank her beer after a good laugh. The beer poured a fairly dark golden. The head was not strong but it did linger on the edges of the liquid throughout the glass. It had no aroma - either good or bad. The taste fit the dinner but was very mild with no hops. The mouthfeel was light. It was a good beer to drink with Mexican food. I would rather have a Bud than a Tecate for just drinking.","LarryKemp","Mar 18, 2003"
2.25,-10.4,2,2,2,2.5,3,"Eh, just your average Mexican beer. What else can I say? Well, I'll have to say why. The color is a pale golden. The taste is a very light taste with little to no aftertaste. The consistencey is watery, well it might as well be water. Overall, nothing to get fired up about. Go with Bohemia, Negra Modelo, or even Sol.","JISurfer","Jan 07, 2003"
2.38,-5.2,2,1.5,2.5,2,3.5,"This is one of the better Mexican beers that I have tried, but it is not a good beer. It is very similar to a corona, but doesn't need a lime to cover the smell and tastes a little better. The only positive that I have about this beer is that it is drinkable. I will not be purchasing this beer again.","Amdahl","Dec 22, 2002"

3.4,35.5,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Pours a clear golden/orange with a small head that fades quickly.  The smell is that of adjuncty sweet corn and a hint of hops.  The taste is immediate crispness along with corn husk and grain with a slight bit of sweetness.  It is light bodied and finishes with a crisp clean taste yet there is almost no trace of flavor on the end.  Not bad for the style, but nothing to hunt for.  Salud!","BeerAngel","Oct 12, 2002"
2.78,10.8,3,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Clear golden color with moderate head after hard pour.  High carbonation and very faint aroma---hops, with malt in the background (if you really tried to smell it).  The taste was more of the same and this is one that you have to add lemon to.  I still like the Dos Equis Amber the best.","ryanocerus","Sep 13, 2002"

2.67,6.4,2.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Pale gold, very clear, thin white head that dissipates quickly. Nice malt & hop aroma. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but buoyed somewhat by a zesty carbonation. Very light, generic beer flavor of malt & hop. Not offensive - not particularily pleasant. Finishes quickly leaving a light dryness. Somewhat refreshing but quite lackluster. Seems a little bit below average.","NeroFiddled","Aug 02, 2002"
1.12,-55.4,3,1,1,1,1,"I may have had a bad bottle but this was just awful. Pale golden color, darker than I anticipated produced a flat looking faint head. Smell was strong acrid, metallic, non-beer smell. Taste was equally bad, serious acrid, bitter, harsh, and slimy sourness to finish. Sadly for the first time since the ""Hurricane Rasperry Wheat incident"" the first beer I could not finish.......Maybe with all that money we give Mexico, we can just ask to have this brewery destroyed........ughh.","StevieW","Jul 07, 2002"

3.2,27.5,3,3,3,4,3.5,"Served at Chevys Tex-Mex in a frozen mug with a wedge of lime and a Mexican flag, both were discarded to get to the beer. Bright and clear pale yellow colour, minimal white lace. Very clean aroma, virtually nothing in the aroma other than a faint grain and corn girt smell. Intense crispness in a light body, clean palate with a thin grain flavour throughout. Some corn grit and light hop bitterness rounded out this brew and its dry finish. This is the Miller of Mexican beers, a better pick a than Corona.","Jason","Jun 05, 2002"
2.33,-7.2,3,2.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Clear light golden hue w/ a poorly retained head.  The aroma, although light, is an odd combination of husky 6-row barley, cooked cabbage and grassy hops. Although the hop bitterness is atypically high for an American macrobrew lager, the thin body and watery mouthfeel leave this beer most unimpressive.  Flavor contributions from malt are absent-- the void in flavor is characteristic of adjunct laden brews.  Tecate finishes with no surprises-- bland, yet clean.  I need a beer with flavor, NOW.","marc77","Jun 04, 2002"
2.56,2,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Drinkability/notes: Nothing terrible about this beer, but not that exceptional either. There are a number of beers from Mexico that for the same money are much better. As an aside, I do not do that slice of lime thing that seems to be so popular with Mexican beers.","Pegasus","May 21, 2002"
2.5,-0.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"I suppose average is the best way to describe this beer.

Decent cold with enchiladas, but that's about it.","proc","May 14, 2002"
2.68,6.8,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"It's better than Corona, but that's not necessarily saying much.  This is another popular beer to drink with lime and for good reason.  The lime helps mask the taste a bit.","mickeymac","May 12, 2002"
3,19.5,3,3,3,3,3,"About the only thing it has going for it is cheer factor and it's better than Corona.  Oh yeah, it's not bad either.  I don't mind drinking these at Mex restaurants, but outside of that there's no reason to drink it.","pbrian","Nov 06, 2001"
