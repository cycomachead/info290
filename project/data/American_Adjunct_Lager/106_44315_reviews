review_text
"Not overly offensive this pours, smells and tastes like the common adjunct lager. It has a decent amount barley graininess with some rice like malts. The tinny after taste is tempered and the bubblegum-like sweetness, that I find common in the style, is present but soft."
"ahead of its peers, but this is a style thats hard to pay much attention too. its cool they brought back an original recipe, and i agree with others that its far less offensive than some other domestic macros, but again, not something i ever really care to drink again. a little more grainy in malt composition than others, less adjuncty ans metallic and sweet than many others, so i like it on those grounds, but it is a little oxidized in the bottle, stale almost, and the hops are almost entirely absent. refreshing enough though with a light body and fine carbonation. i would choose this one over a lot of others in its category, but if i never see one of these again, im not going to be broken up about it. a nod to history, always cool, but the beer remains woefully pedestrian."

"You couldn't ask much more out of a beer in this style, and that is why I rated it so highly. I believe it is the best in class. I drink a lot of craft beer, but sometimes I just want a classic lager. Something that my grandfather would have drank. This reminds me of the first sip of beer I ever had. It is head and shoulders above Bud, Miller, and the rest of the competition. This and Yeungling are right at the top for the style."
""
"T-Not offensive at all with a little hop character and slight achohol with little corn taste."
"My favorite AAL, it beats Bud/Miller/Coors hands down. Light but tasty malt flavor, and unlike its competitors it has a noticeable hop presence. It makes you wonder why they ever changed he recipe in the first place. At a current local price of around 9 bucks/12 pack, it's the best option for someone on a budget. (Note: $9 is probably more than people pay for Schlitz in other areas. Hi-Life and PBR cost the same. For some reason, cheap beer is more expensive in New Orleans while craft beer is priced pretty reasonably.)"

"Best american domestic I have ever had.  Good price.  A great choice when you want a regular beer.  This is not my favorite style, but this I think is a best in class.  Had it in bottles, looking for  cans by the case."
"This is the best AAL I have ever had."
"Best of The Big Boy Macros"

"overall: I gave this such a high rating based on a comparison of other beers of its type. At $7 and change for a 12 pack I was expecting this to be a garbage beer. I was shocked at the first taste of this beer. Best adjunct lager I've ever tasted."

"Pours out to a creamy head that laces well. Light gold color. Aroma is bready grains and a touch of hop spice. Flavor is surprisingly smooth and clean with vinous notes and a clean crisp finish. Mouthfeel is light and tingly. Very good. Wow."

"O: pretty fantastic, really, considering the low expectations and cheap price of the adjunct. it's really sweet, and while the malt doesn't hit the sweet biscuits/bread malt range, it's doing something to give it plenty of taste. and the grain here isn't turning the whole thing into a liquid tortilla chip. again, it's just giving it some nice sweet taste."

"I am not going to go on and on about it's merits...however if you can find this awesome Nectar of the Gods...TRY IT! WOW! What a GR8 Brew~best of the American Macro Brews hands down,cheers ;)"

"Old school American lager beer done right. This is one of the best corn adjunct beers out there. It has character. Very drinkable. Clean and not harsh. Balanced malt sweetness, mild corn dryness, and mild floral and bitter hop backbone. I see why this was the best selling beer in America for a long time."
""
""
"*Overall, Schlitz is a great example of an adjunct lager. Glad to see Pabst hasn't totally thrown this one down the crapper. I paid $12.49 for the 12 pack, and according to some folks from across the country, I got ripped off. But it's still a great little lager that I'd buy again no problem!"

"I don't get this often because I only see it in suitcases of 30, but if it sold in six packs I'[d get it occasionally. It is a decent, yet cheap beer. It is better than some of the craft beers out there. I am amazed that it tastes the same as I recall from 1965."
"-more of these ""Classic"" Recipes should come back...vintage repro-guitars & vintage repro-beers are fine by me as long as they do it right..just like this beer."

"Guru brought this over for me to give it a go. Not much to look at, weak head and not much to it, looks like tinted water with minimal head. Decent smell though has me more optimistic. Not bad flavor. Weak and not much to it but certainly not bad and easy to drink. Would not buy but would not turn down."
""
""

"O - I was looking forward to this and frankly was disappointed. A typical AAL that is priced way too high for what you get. Since I wasn't quite of beer drinking age in the 60s (other than the occasional sip) I have to take their word this was the 60s formula. If so, I have to wonder how Schlitz ever challenged for number one (other than the fact their competition was another non-descript AAL)."
""
""
"O: Very flavorful representation of the style. I'd like to see more of these ""Classic"" Recipes come back. It'd be interesting to see what my grandfather drank in his thirties."
""
"A great AAL style beer. Has a great, rich flavor with good hop/malt balance, smooth finish with slightly sweet, grain overtones, and rich bready notes. Smooth and easy to drink. No watered down character at all. Tastes like older style Milwaukee beers used to. The perfect lawnmower beer, session lager, or summer thirst quencher. Paid $5.99 for a six pack in bottles in Vonore, Tennessee. Beats Budweiser, Coors, and Miller for only a slight premium in price. Worth trying at least once. A pleasant surprise for macro lager. Does nothing wrong. Just good plain beer."
"The owners of Pabst have no idea what a gem they have on their hands with this beer."
"O- The least offensive of all macro lagers but it's still no fun to drink."
""
""
""
"This is the Schlitz of my youth and early manhood. Enjoy."
""
""
""
"Ok What is it now that its not gusto but taste like gusto but not in a gusto can? anyway....Glad to see they are producing this a little more after its summer disappearance. Beer has a light look, feel, pours with a two finger head into a Schlitz goblet.The sip is clean, good balance like a Macanudo cigar. Nothing at all unpleasant and most certainly a go to beer for all occasions. This isn't a craft but its easily still one of the most balanced drinkable adjuncts I've ever had. Feel the nostalgia to back when the gods at Schlitz ruled the earth."
"Much better head formation and retention that one would expect for an adjunct lager. Corn cereal notes very present in the aroma. Overpowering the barley. When tasting the corn is there but it isn't so prominent. Hop flavor is mild but present. Even a mild hop presence is much more than your average American macro lager. This beer would benefit from more bitterness. I think too much corn is used in the mash bill also but it isn't terrible."
"So I thought I'd give this a go based on some of the above average reviews for an American Lager. Well maybe slightly beeter, hard to say. I personally didn't taste any hops as some had noted. It's maybe an above average lawn mowing beer. Good 4:00 PM beer after the yard works done. Nuff said."

"Is what they're offering today the same Schlitz as back then? Hell, I can't tell for sure. My taste buds have changed so much over the years that it would be impossible to determine. All I can say is this beer tastes a little too sweet for every day drinking if you ask me. They used to advertise that it had just a kiss of the hops. Well that's for sure. There's hardly any noticeable in this beer. To me it's fizzy and not as satisfying as it once was. (It's hard to go back after you've tasted Heady Topper)"
""
"like it did years ago!"
"For an adjunct lager, I'll take this one WAY before the vast majority of the others in its class. It doesn't have the corn-brewed taste slapped over the flavor like you would with Miller, nor the overly crisp profile of Budweiser. It's what an adjunct lager should be."

"Surprise -- I liked this. The ultimate lawnmower beer. Clean, drinkable, and not filling. Snagged a single, could easily do a six on a warm day like today. I hope the brewers pay attention to reviews here. The 60's formula works -- don't revert back to the shit that made your brand a laughingstock. This is nice solid beer."

"Overall-This is is 5. I have drank the standard american lagers Bud , (High Life, PBR, Red Stripe) and this is the best of t hem all . I will take this over any craft beers s any day.This will s a true staple beer. ."

"O: Probably the most enjoyable AAL that I have had the opportunity to try - it is a darn shame that they stopped using this as the main recipe sometime in the 1970s. Easy to drink and enjoyable - nicely balanced between the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops without leaving out their flavors."
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, citrus zest, and floral hops. Taste is much the same with malt and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice hop aromas and flavors for the style."
""
""
""
""
"O - Full discretion, I actually LIKE AAL's. This one is right up there in the top of the tops. Probably better than 'gansett. The light toasted element gives it a nice splash of flavor while remaining light and drinkable."
""
"Drank gallons of this before the great Frank Sellinger ""Improvement"" of the late 1970's which rightfully put the company out of business. The new reformulated brew tastes just like the Schlitz of old. Was the best mass produced beer then and still is with this formula. Just make sure you get the new reformulated stuff and not the bargain basement stuff usually found in the 12 oz cans at the Quickie Marts. Better than Bud, better than Coors and better than Miller. Cannot top the microbrews but it never was intended to compete with this market. Hope they keep producing this."
"O: As far as AALs go, this is definitely one of the better ones out there. Look past the Miller Lites, Budweisers, and Coors out there and grab some of this. There's a lot more depth to this beer for the same price and same ABV. In my opinion, there is absolutely ZERO reason to buy any of the BMC beers over this (unless, of course, you cannot find it, which is definitely possible because only one beer store in my area carries it.)"

"Overall: for a adjunct pale lager, its really not bad, id reach for this at a bbq over any other in its class.. But definetly not a craft pilsner style beer."
""
""
""
""
"Served in a ""Tall Boy"" and not easy to get around RI. As compared to PBR, Gansett, Rolling Rock or Coors Banquet (adjuncts with old school cache) this my favorite of the retro lagers. Enjoyable and drinkable. The Tall Boy presentation was nice but I'd prefer a 12 oz. The color was unknown as I drink from the can, the nose was real beer, taste was full and crisp beer taste, clean after taste ..."
""
"i would like to try this again because i think i received a bad can. i will update my review if i find it better in the future."
"(O) Again, probably my favorite of the re-branded American Adjunct beers. I gave it an overall score of 4 because I believe it to be above average in that it delivered everything I was looking for in this particular beer. Flavorful, refreshing and an all around solid beer. Super underrated, and very well done. Most likely won't appeal to fans of 'big' beers, but this beer certainly has it's place. For whatever reason, here in central PA Schlitz has become almost impossible to get. I picked this up at a distro in Chester County, and will make it a point to stock up."

"Overall a very light German Pils with a hint of Saaz hops I would guess. Quite pleasant given its competition."

"Clear pale yellow color with a fluffy, big-bubbled head that slips down to a little ring. Clean, lager-y aroma - there's actually a nice, spicy hop note, which is surprising. A bit of lemon, sweet cereal grain, and a touch of sulfur. Chuggable, inoffensive flavor - crisp, spicy hop and grain. Not bad at all. I could drink a hell of a lot of these on a hot day (or anytime for that matter). This just might be my go-to cheap beer of choice from now on..."
"Schlitz: I usually drink wheat beers during the summer, but thought I would work through the classic mass produced US beers as a change of pace. The Schlitz has a darker golden color, light carbonation, and a decent head. The aroma is very mild. The malt flavor is up front, and finishes with some bitter. The only drawback to this beer is an abrasive aftertaste, which takes it off of my list. PBR still holds the lead. Stay tuned."
""
""
""

"A very well done and refreshing AAL. One of the better ones out there. The greatest thing about this beer is the price. I picked up a 6 pack of tall boys on sale for $4."
""
""
"All in all, I'd say this has become my new favorite American adjunct I've had so far. I usually pick up Budweiser, High Life, and Pabst; but I'd say this tops them all in my opinion. Not sure I could say the same if they hadn't re-introduced the classic formula before I hit 21, but oh well, lucky me! However, if you like more malt and less bitter hops, I'd go with something else. The only downside about this beer is that I can't get it where I currently live. I'll have to pick up a couple 12 packs each time I'm home from college. Anyway, a refreshing, satisfying adjunct to quench your thirst and catch a buzz on a hot summer day. Now all I need is a wife with a beehive and a '64 Chevy in the driveway."
"Had this at the PAMdemonium Mensa gathering. Aroma is weak but one does get a hint of malt. It pours a typical clear yellow with an unremarkable white head. Flavor, though, is better than I expected - strong, malty and just a little fruity. Body leaves something to be desired, but not the fizz. Overall, not bad for an industrial lager."
""
"Better at 45F rather than right from a 37F fridge."
"O: Not quite as dry as most AALs, which allows a bit of the sweet malt character to come out. Pretty nice (for the style)."
"In conclusion, after such a long story, it's nice to have an American adjunct lager on the market that's got some hops to it, and a bit of malt flavor as well."
""

""

"This is by far the best macro brew that you can get. Granted it is not in the same league as the micro brew stuff. However, I was surprised about how good this is."

"Schlitz 60s recipe is hands down the best AAL available. I buy it often as it is one of my favorite all time beers. The appearance is rich golden hue and the head actually laces/clumps. The smell is grainy, yeasty and hoppy. The taste is malt forward with the adjunct adding prickly crispness while the noticeable hops finishes very cleanly. Mouthfeel is very smooth and the beer is highly drinkable @ 4.7abv. I believe this to be one of the best beers available anywhere esp relative to pricing."
"On a recent adventure to Millwaukee, I was offered a ""Tall Boy"" of Schlitz, the classic '60s formula. It poured light golden with sticky white foam. A sweet bready aroma wafted above the glass. This trend continued onto the palate, was a tad hollow in the center before being whisked away with the lightest dash of hops. I highly drinkable and gentle brew. Not bad, really."
""
"Bought at a roadside dive bar last night in Noblestown, PA...damn this beer was drinking smooth for a beer that just drinks like a classic. This is the beer that made Milwaukee famous. Pours a sparkling pale light golden color with a bright white head forming thick, actually holds onto the head quite a bit. Fine speckled lacing layers arounds the sides of my glass. Aroma has abright cereal grain sweetness, seems a bit mineral in the middle but overall a nice sweetness meant to be drank by the masses especially during the industrial revolution. This neck label states that this is the classic 1960s formula. Drinks so nicely semie sweet cereal notes goes down smooth it's actually chuggable and likeable and sessionable. Amazing that an old retro beer can come back and actually be drinkable for someone like me who has tried almost 2500 different beers. Happy to see this brew in a dive bar, I actually took a six pack home and cleared them out of their Schlitz supply."
""
""
"This beer poured out as a clear looking yellow color. Not much to really say here. It had a small white head on top for a little while but faded quickly. The smell of the beer was of corn and other grains. The taste of the beer was light, clean and simple. No levels of complexity at all. The mouthfeel of the beer was drinkable, I drank it rather quickly just to finish it. Overall I bought a bottle with the only intention of saying I had it. I wasn't expecting anything from it or even expecting to like it. It's a beer, That wraps it up pretty well I think."
""
""
"Overall: In my opinion this is a decent beer for this style. It was refreshing and just sitting back and drinking one is a pleasant experience."
""
""
"O- I really like this beer, it has some flavor, goes down easy, and for the price, 5.69/6 pack, you really can't beat it."
""
""
""
"Poured into an old Schlitz flared pilsner glass. Pours straw colored with a fluffy white head and has abundant carbonation. The head dissipates rather quickly. The aroma is sweet and smells of light malt. The taste is crisp with good light malt and hop flavors. The mouthfeel is light for this is smooth and drinkable beer. There is some lacing left on the glass. If I need a go to American adjunct lager as a session beer, I would look no further than Schlitz."
""
"O- It certainly looks nice. It won't overwhelm you in any category, but this is the way to go if you are strapped for cash or need a light, fizzy drink."
"Very light flavor of noble hops. Some sweet malt. Crisp lager finish. Refreshing, watery, spritzy, and tall. This is a go-to for trivia night. $3 a can. I prefer it a little more to High Life or something like that. There's a little more flavor. But I can still pound these all night and rock it out with the woo! dudes like a boss."
"Overall: This is my ""go to"" adjunct brew. Not just a lawnmower beer, but a spacer--a beer to drink in between expensive beers. Just as good as Bud, Miller, PBR, and at the price I'm getting them for, I'd be crazy not to pick up a 12 or 2 on the weekend--every weekend."
""
""
"Overall a tasty macro."
""
""
"M. Lighter side of medium flavor...yet strangely undercarbonated, it just lies limp on my tongue without any effervescence at all."
""
"Just a terrible product. Pabst's new owners are doing a great job of ruining the company which began to catch as a fluke."
""
"I wish this beer would take off and take market share from BMC, but I fear BMC's grip on the minds of American consumers is too strong."
""
"O: the best aal I've ever had. BMC should be keeping an eye on this one. I could see this coming back and staking a claim in the aal landscape. Blows the other aal's I've tried out of the water. No pun intended..."
""
"overall, this is a pretty tasty, thirst quenching lager with some gritty character. the overall flavour and character makes up for the too thin body and mouthfeel. i like it. and happy 10 year BA birthday to me! now...on to the good stuff!!"
""
"O: Certainly one of the better macro lagers I've had. The price is good, though Full Sail Session is better at the same price. Hell of a lot better than Budweiser."
""
""
""
""
"Saw some hype about a return to to the classic formula. I was not impressed. Seems to be the same old macro lager taste that is acceptable when very cold, but nothing great. Good for a hot summer day.Acceptable as a spacer, but not much else. Very dissapointing."
""
"Overall, pretty good...an old friend returns."
"Overall, this is pretty inoffensive, lacks a little bit of flavor, isn't noticeably faulty, but it doesn't taste like most 'adjuncts' I've had. It's pretty easy I must say, but I think that's part of its charm which makes it nice. I could have several of these and enjoy myself no problem. Perhaps the 60s were better for beer after all in America? Uh... probably not all things considering."
"O: Wow, very good for the style. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by this one. Lacks many of the off flavors associated with others in the style. Only downside to this one is its a little pricey for what it is and hard to find in my area."
"This is definitely all the AAL can be..."
"I had this, and I swore it was something else. For the style it is very nice, drinkable for certain. I caught a whiff of hops, but mainly the typical adjunct effects. The taste though was grand. I knew I was drinking something a little more upscale than what's marketed nowadays. The only true downside to this beer is its appearance. This is a lawnmower beer, that I probably would only drink in the summer."
"O: Not very flavorful, goes down ok, likewise not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are other beers in the style that I would pick first."
"Taste is light and airy, cleaner than regular schlitz it seems like, although the differences are not too wide. Not bad, seems to be a little bit of a leafy hop bitterness on the end, which is nice. I got this as a single, but I saw sixers of this selling for as much as Coors or Bud. Schlitz has always been a decent bargain beer, but at 'premium' prices, I dont think I would buy much. For an AAL this falls right on the better side of middling."
"Pours light gold yellow with a decent white head that lingers fairly well. Scent is typical baseball stadium beer. Taste is ricy with a tin twang to it, but crisp and clean. One of the better adjuncts."
"O- Overall, though I'm sure my judging on the appearance and smell will probably bring my overall ""grade"" down, I honestly think this is a fantastic every day beer, especially if price is a factor. If this were more prevalent in liquor stores in my area, it would be my regular ""go to"" beer, too bad the only place I've seen that sells it around these parts is forty five minutes away from me."
"Standard american adjunct fare, without the big advertising campaign, so its relatively cheap. Hint of hops. Hint of barley, but mostly corn or rice or something else super light that doesn't impart much flavor. Always highly carbonated. A good palate cleanser."
"This beer works on any hot day inwhich you want a cheap decent beer. At $5.99/six pack it's pretty solid."
"This has replaced PBR as my cheap American Lager of choice. Goes great with football games."
"O: Not bad at all"
"Just looking for something light to have during the week, paid 12.99 plus tax for this case."
"*That date has come and gone. I just recently had Fort George 1811 Pre-Prohibition Lager, which blows Schlitz and every other AAL I’ve had out of the water."
"I wish it had more body and barley flavor, but this is pretty darn good for U.S. macro. I get more too."
"I drank a 6 pack of bottles without pouring into a glass. Beer did not seem over-carbonated and smelled very fresh when I popped the cap. The balance of malt, corn and light hops was pleasing and the floral notes from the ""kiss 'o hops"" (sorry, had to do it) made this classic both interesting and drinkable. The Pabst stable is really putting out some great beers these days and this is one of them. I would put this up against many of Canadian or Euro-Macros any day. Go for the Gusto!"
"When funds are tight you can't go wrong with $18 a case for this."
"I'd rather have any number of craft beers over this, but at least it proves that it's possible to brew a relatively flavorful and satisfying beer in the style. Exceptional for the style."
"O - Surprisingly enjoyable adjunct lager. Why the hell did they change the formula anyways. More adjuncts should have legitimate flavors like this."
"Congrats Schlitz! Quality vs Quantity FTW"
"What can I say this is American beer at it's best! That is if you are talking adjunct lagers. I just like to call it an American lager. Goes down to easy! Great year around beer if you are broke. You cannot go wrong!"
"O - Not too bad really, a basic beer for the summertime. A step up from the plain BMC, good for just watching the game"
"A fitting tribute to our manufacturing past and the beer that almost beat Budweiser."
"O) This is a good beer. In an era where mass produced lagers dominated the market, it's easy to see how this is the beer that made Milwaukee famous. It kind of transports me to some extent. I think if I would have had the opportunity to enjoy a beer with my grandfather and great grandfather in the garage or maybe the boathouse. Well, it might have been an ice cold Schlitz."
"Having now tried this classic recipe, I can see why this beer was once so popular. It does feel like a true throwback; that I'm tasting what all the guys in my grandfather's tavern were enjoying back in the day. Anyone who writes this off simply because of the style is missing out on a fun beverage. It won't knock your socks off, but it is worth your attention."
"Keep in mind when reviewing this beer that its not competing with a craft brew, but other AALs. When you consider that 90% of the beer sold at the corner shop is crap, those are the beers that you need to compare this one to. In that context, it excels."
"Thank you sir, may I have another?"
"WE BUILT SCHLITZ CITY!!!"
"Overall: A good lager at a good price. If only all cheap American beer tasted like this!"
"Pours a clear yellow-golden color with a pretty good white head and some slight lacing. The nose brings a bit of bread and some light corn character. Nothing cooked or DMS-like, but the use of adjuncts is noticeable. Flavor falls along the same lines. Nothing offensive. It's fairly bland, but does have a bit of malt flavor. Light body and slightly chewy. Average carbonation. I wouldn't complain about drinking this again."
"Overall, my go to American Adjunct Lager. I had been waiting for this to come to NC and it didn't disappoint."
"O: Schlitz Gusto is hands down the best AAL on the market. Nothing even comes close. This brew is a game changer, and absolutely deserves the high marks it receives. Seek this out, regardless of style. This is a wonderful beer."
"a quiet enjoyable beer it is a shame this isn't the top seller in the country."
"Overall a very good lager, the best adjunct lager I've ever had."
"Taste is a firm, lightly fruity grain, lightly sweet malty body with light apple, and a balancing light but very firm, zesty hop bitterness that in character is grassy with light herbal element that is almost minty. It is a simple, straightforward traditional American lager but with unusually good malty and hoppy body and character, with the hop flavour and bitterness really standing out complared to others in the style. This is better than the “regular” modern Schlitz and really stands out in the class. After drinking this, and comparing it to several other such American lagers at the time, the others are utterly bland and rough by comparison."
"o: first time having this one.. its actually quite nice.. far better than any AAL i've had.. having this while i bbq outside & it pairs perfect! this will make more appearances in my fridge."
"O/D-Perhaps Narragansett Lager has been supplanted in the category of best macro in my book by the Gusto. The light body combined with the clean grassy hops really make this one a winner. My new go-to non-craft? I think so!"
"Poured right down the middle of the glass. Gave a nice two fingered white head. Head didnt hang around to long. But head did settle down to about one eighth inch. Then dissapated. Nice bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Beer itself was a light golden color. Smelled slightly sweet. Also notes of corn and malt. Actually taste, I thought quite good. Not bitter. But did have a sweet taste. Not real heavy on sweetness. Just slightly sweet. Probably from the malt. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation I thought was good. Ill buy again. I thought better than PBR or Coors. Would make a good session beer or lawnmower beer."
"The taste has light grains but a whole lot of corn. This has a big corn taste and really is like corn water. But again there is nothing offensive in the taste just a boring beer. Instead of cussing the ""S" word I now have a saying- ""Ah Schlitz"""
"I can remember Schlitz tasting this way...way back. I just wish they would bring back the original Stroh's. Pour gives a one finger head of white foam that lasts only for a little while, leaving a clean sided glass, no lace to see. The color is a 2 on the SRM beer color chart, and very clean looking. Smell is that of cereal grain, heavier on roasted corn and malt. Taste brings back memories of a younger time in my life. Rough of the edges, flavors of cooked wheat, roasted corn, and a slight sweetness from the malt. Mouthfeel is light but creamy, with a wonderful tingling and a little dryness on the edges. I really like the taste that remains in the back recesses of my upper soft palate. Although this beer is not refined, I like the taste and the pleasure it brings. Great beer after coming in from the hot sun and yard/car work. A little pricey, but can you place a price on memories."
"Damn it all, this is a pretty tasty beer. Underdog beer style aside, this is quite a tasty brew. This just may replace my current macro standby, PBR. Drinkability is excellent, I'm so happy with the taste I can't put this beer down!"
"It pours a pale fizzy yellow like you would assume a beer of it's style would. The smell is actually rather nice and mild. There's no off flavors in the scent. I can't believe that I really don't mind the taste of this beer. I was so scared and nervous because I had consumed the non-Gusto varietal of this beer and it was god-awful. The only thing wrong with this was that there was an almost iron like taste that stayed on the tongue. For the style this is good. When we go fishing and drink the cheap stuff, this will be my beer of choice. I'm pretty happy about that now."
"RTJ"
"I just had to try this. It pours a clear straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises wheat, corn, flowers, and light grass. A vague sort of pleasant sweetness hangs over everything here. The taste brings in more of the same, though that sweetness has deserted me, and a light brush of metallic ore comes in at some point (thankfully not for very long and not very strongly). This taste is pretty bland, but in a positive way, if that makes any sense. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish. Overall, probably the best AAL I have ever had. I wouldn't necessarily pick this out to drink as a regular thing, but if I ever am looking for a cheap pack of beer for an outing or something, this will be opted-for over the likes of BMC, PBR, and Old Style. I do so like pleasant surprises..."
"Smells like banana, cereal grains, and a bit metallic. The first thing I notice in the taste is a bitter bite. Other than that, it's exceptionally smooth. I can taste some of that cereal malt, but it's very subdued. It's not sweet, certainly refreshing. More so, it's refreshingly different from other adjunct lagers out there today. It's much more bitter and noticeably lacking in sweetness. However, it's lacking in just about any other flavour too. As an escape from other budget beers, it's good, but overall, it's too watery."
"I initially bought it for the novelty and to see what the 1960s tasted like. They can keep it. While it does not taste bad, it just does not taste like anything, plus the high carbonation makes it difficult to be a session beer."
"I had about a finger of bone-white head, but it fell like Wile E. Coyote off of a cliff. Color was a pretty golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. It wasn't fizzy enough for me to make a Greg Koch comment. Nose had a light grassy-hop scent. If this was an adjunct beer, it certainly had me fooled! Maybe extended with rice, but corn was not an additive here. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a lightly grassy hop bitterness on the tongue. This is undoubtedly what they meant by ""Just a kiss of the hops"". I prefer a French kiss, lingeringly so, but so be it in this case. Finish was pleasant, unobtrusive and definitely nostalgic. Man, I remember these in the heavy returnable bottles in my buddy's dad's reefer. We were big on helping ourselves. This may not be around forever, so grab some and take a trip in the WABAC machine!"
"Finally made it to Colorado. Picked up a six pack of tall boys and had one last weekend. Poured a clear golden color with a small white head. Aromas of corn, straw and light citrus. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of straw, light corn and a hint of citrus with a crisp clean finish. An improvement over the other Schlitz."
"*12oz cans are now available to me locally, cool!"
"Overall-I am going to give it a 5. For years I have drank the standard AAL's (High Life, PBR, etc) and this is the best one so far. I will take this over craft beers and IPA's any day. Hopefully this will be a permanent staple in grocery stores and convenience stores from here on because this is real beer."
"This is a near perfect example of the traditional American beer at its best. It's not the Schmitz of Philadelphia of my youth but it is close enough."
"That being said Schlitz Gusto pours fizzy, pale, and yellow. Its tastes fine, by which I mean its good enough. Schlitz gusto is a perfectly reasonable utility beer, one that I will not make fun of anyone for drinking."
"The second that grass starts to grow I know the wife will have me out mowing the lawn. We like to keep it green and neat. Usually I'll have a brown ale or a nice ipa while in the hot sun, but if i feel like having a few it could be these. nice"
"Basically, you people got fooled. Beer in the 1960's was probably just as bad as it was before the micro-brew revolution. It is your standard Joe Average lawn mower beer and nothing else but something that hearkens back the days of old and onion skin nostalgia."
"I'm not crazy about the beer. While a more flavorful (mostly in a good way) AAL than most, it is not much of an improvement. It costs more than PBR and I'll stick with that for situations conducive to this kind of beer."
"My father rarely drank beer, but when he did it was good ole Schlitz, in the era before poptab cans. And, he poured salt in it. No salt goes in with my pour but Schlitz has a clear yellow body with a small white head. Retention is poor and lacing consists of only a few speckles. Aroma is unremarkable, somewhat of an attribute for the style. Toasted grain and a hint of herbal/spicy hops. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, light bodied and well carbonated. Taste is clean and even. Toasted grain with a mild sweetness that is nicely balanced by a subtle herbal hop bitterness. Some barley and a hint of corn underneath. No offnotes. Simple but well done, this one leaves the other macro lagers in the dust. Very clean and sessionable."
"Given the price piont and availability this is good stuff."
"Been wanting to try this, and it does not disappoint. Pours a nice gold color, slightly darker than most American lagers. Fizzy head dissipates quickly. Nose is some nice roasted malts and corn and honey glaze. Surprisingly good body in this brew, where its brethren are little more than glorified, over-carbonated water. This one is actually has some heft to it. Very smooth taste with just the right amount of carbonation. Taste is light and smooth, the perfect brew for cookouts and warm weather. Wish all American lagers tasted like this; definitely need more macros to got ""retro""."
"After doing some yardwork or hosting a party where your beer buddies aren't as cultured, this is a winner. Nice job, Pabst-Miller-whoever is brewing this."
"Overall, a nice clean refreshing beer for those days when you just want a dam beer."
"D: A very drinkable AAL if you're in that kind of mood (I have been lately)."
"Very easy to drink. Somewhat cleaner, lighter and less syrupy than regular Schlitz. Looks like this version will be phasing out the canned ""Kiss of the hops"" Schlitz. Still a solid, no frills beer. Will drink again."
"A very drinkable AAL. Slainte."
"D- This beer goes down very easy. No off flavors which limit most adjunct lagers to me. Low BAV makes this the perfect lawnmower beer to me."
"Drinkability: A true beer, unlike the other yellow fizzy things people call beer these days. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink a sessionable beer for sure."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall: Top of the line adjunct lager. This is what cheap American beer should taste like. While this isn't going to thrill craft beer lovers, it's definitely worth buying when you're looking to go cheap. I'll be buying more."
"D: Well, it's drinkable and refreshing but in the end it is still just a schlitz--a good go-to-drink-from-the-bottle kind of beer (if you have to have one); and I imagine this to be just the right kind of beer to have after a humid afternoon of mowing the lawn, but it's 7 degrees outside right now, so I think I'll pass on having another for now"
"D - This beer is very drinkable. It's small in alcohol, there's nothing offensive anywhere in it. It's not like drinking water, for obvious reasons, but it's almost as easy. However, because of that, I don't like drinking it all that much. And that's really what it comes down to, for me."
"o 3.5-4"
"D - Not terrible but I'm just not a big fan of this beer. For the rating it gets, I thought it would be better."
"Drinkability- very drinkable. A top notch reprsentation of the style"
"light-bodied, very easy going session beer. Schlitz has made a smart decision when they decided to release this brew. While there is nothing spectacular about Gusto, it's actually pretty decent and quite drinkable. A perfect lawnmower brew."
"overall, this is a good beer for it's style i liked it but"
"*Note: Whereas Tall Boys were always 24 ounce cans marketed by some old grandpa brewer looking for a clever name for that particular format, ""Silos"" were 16 ounce cans -- maybe it's just a Midwest colloquial thing, but for the can collector in me this approach to ""retro marketing"" is mildly irksome."
"Surprisingly good for a macro brew pale lager. Slightly hoppy taste which goes down smooth. A pale yellow with a touch of amber. The head quickly disappears. Very carbonated. Has a slight zing to the taste and then leaves quickly. Goes down nice and smooth. One of the better pale lager macro brews I've tasted."
"Crackery, crisp taste, very light bodied, dry and slightly bitter at first (kiss of hops?), with an apple hint in the aftertaste. Clean, simple, straightforward. Carbonation is moderate, and isn't gassy. This is the best macro lager i've tried to date. Easy to drink several, tastes better in warm weather somehow."
"Notes: I do feel that I've missed out a bit. I'm far to young to have ever been subjected to the awful Schlitz brewed in the '70's and '80's. I didn't even know it existed at all until the re-released Schlitz was half-ironically brought to a Packer game by one of my dad's friends. It immediately became - and has stayed - one of my favorites when I want to kick back after a long day."
"Notes: This revival of the classic Schlitz formula is a pleasant surprise. There's something comforting about a good old American Adjunct Lager done right. Schlitz is a great easy drinking and refreshing brew that could even please your beer-snob buddies. It's my go-to cheap beer."
"Everyone has probably heard the story. After World War II, Schlitz, Miller and Blatz were all huge Milwaukee Breweries. Schlitz being the largest. Some time around 1970, some clueless numb-nuts in the boardroom decided to cut corners with the recipie to save money. This basically ruined the company. There is something very beer advocate about that story. Anyway, this is one of the tastier fizzy yellow mass consumption beers I have had. Very clean, straight forward beer flavor. Not overly sweet or grainy, with a snappy bitter finish. No unpleasant aftertaste. It's been a while since I've had the other Schlitz formula. I don't remember much other than it sucked. This didn't."
"D: I would have this again. A fine example of the style."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some corn. Taste is crisp, malts with some hops, a touch of sweetness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall one of the better adjunct lagers I have had."
"Beer is thin and has a slight grainy aftertaste. It is almost vegetal. Eu, VSL was better. I'm done Schlitz. Peace."
"Very drinkable beer, cold anyways."
"The mouth has crisp carbonation and a good feel. Very easy drinker. This and the reformulated Old Style are a good one two nostalgia punch. So much better than most macros."
"Will I pass up a New Glarus, Tyrania or Two Brothers beer for Schlitz? Not unless I'm short on cash. But I think that Schlitz is the best American adjunct lager out there today. It even beats out Leinenkugel traditional by half a star."
"Drinkability: You can drink it, and it's nice to remember back when this all you drank because you didn't know better."
"D & Notes: For the modern day beer lover, this is an awesome session brew. Not sure if I like it better than PBR, but it's definitely in the same category of a what an American Adjunct is supposed to taste like, as opposed to the brewer trying to make it easy to drink for everybody. Only drawback is that because of limited availability, it's currently priced like a craft beer, and more importantly, still very tough to find. Cannot wait until this makes it to Austin, Texas."
"It's not dreck, but it's far from a good light lager."
"Great brew to have on hand at all times,everyone seems to like this one! Pretty strait-forward beer with nothing obvious to point out or any bells or whistles happening. Tastes like old school beer but in a very good way! Check this one out or pick some up if you got non-crafters stoppin by. Pretty good value at $5.99 a sixer also!"
"D: A winner from Schlitz - a highly drinkable, tasty American macro. It drinks like a more refined, more robust, and cleaner version of regular Schlitz (which isn't half bad itself). The mouthfeel in particular is excellent for the style, and this is surprisingly polished. Who knows if this is what it actually tasted like in the 60s - this is a very good American lager right now."
"""Hats off to all the ones that stood before me."""
"16oz ""Tall Boy"" can (as it's written on the side), ""Classic '60s Formula"" and ""The Beer that made Milwaukee Famous."" Hate to take this beaut out of the can, but pours a crystal clear yellow color (SURPRISE!!), large white head, no lacing. Aroma is grainy, grassy, herbal, and surprisingly hoppy, but nothing stands out. Flavor follows the nose to the T. Grainy, crackers, some light bread and a touch of bitterness on the finish. Not getting much in the off-flavor adjunct department, pretty well hidden. I don't like drinking this out of the glass. This should still be in the can with the 6 pack ring still attached. Decent AAL, but nothing can top Premos!! Crisp, easy drinking. Will probably put pack a few of these tall boys tonight!!"
"Smells nice though. Honey. Sweet. Not a great taste, but at least there is some body and some flavor. I think it's a good alternative to Budweiser, Coors Light, etc., if you want an easy drinking beer on a summer day."
"D - Certainly no match for a good craft lager, but this far exceeded my expectations. This isn't bad as far as cheap beers go, and definitely better than PBR. I could actually see myself drinking this from time to time."
"Had this beer for the first time the other day and was extremely pleased with the taste & drinkabilty. I had heard that the old formula was being used. I highly recommend this beer for it's value, taste & nostalgic appeal. Those that have their doubts must try this beer. It's nothing like the old Schlitz. Cheers"
"I'm pretty impressed, I gotta admit. This Schlitz, it's mindlessly downable, but with character and pizazz. This to me is more of a pilsner than some beers that call themselves pilsner."
"At $5.49 for six bottles, this is far cheaper than any craft offering on the market, so this will be something I consume fairly often over the summer. The difference between this and High Life will probably lead me to buy this a few more times. And it's certainly easy to quaff in large quantities. It actually reminds me a lot of Harp when that's fresh, as rare as that is."
"D= While most people hate this style I enjoy this beer. I've had it out of the bottle and now the can. Lovely beer for what it is. Worth trying at least once for every beer lover."
"Endlessly drinkable."
"D - Balanced, inoffensive, and easy to consume. Would sooner offer one of these to someone at a BBQ than almost any of its competitors."
"A 6-pack of tall boys for $4.99. Seemed like a good deal. Pours a straw color with two fingers of white head that had surprising retention. Some sticky lacing is left on the glass. Not much to say about the aroma. It is not offensive like so many adjunct lagers. But it does have a touch of Noble hops in the nose. This ""new"" Schlitz is an extremely clean tasting beer. Some dry as a saltine malt flavor that is finished with a slight hoppy taste. Crisp, dry, and clean. Some characteristics that make this light lager so easy to drink. Nothing really to note in the mouthfeel. It is light and has abundant carbonation without being harsh. For a cheap lager this is very good. I would rather offer this to someone than a Bud or Miller."
"D: This is light and goes down easy. It has more flavor than many beers of this style, which is a plus. One of the better beers of this type."
"I'm glad that I tried this."
"drinkability is great - this beer has end of the work day lawnmowing beer written all over it"
"Very Good Basic/Cheap beer."
"While I enjoyed the taste, it was still a bit lighter than I recall it to be, as well as having more carbonation than most other beers on the market. Nice amber color, fine smell of hops, and a taste reminiscent of Wisconsin beers in the 60's and 70's."
"This beer really surprised me. I was not expecting such a great taste and drinkability from an American Adjunct Lager. For what it is, being an adjunct lager, it is incredibly good. It has a smooth taste, a slight crispness from the carbonation, but not a lot. It doesn't have that ""watered down"" "weak taste"" that so many American Adjunct Lagers have. All in all, it's worth the money. It is a very good beer in my opinion."
"I don't know what the hell it is about this beer, but I like it. I like this beer a lot. Musty grainy aromas start off the top with a little weird spice from somewhere. It doesn't smell too off putting. It's just odd. The taste of woodsy grain starts off the palette. The sweet taste of sweet grains mix in to the middle of it and it turns to a high grain cracker. It finishes as a bready dry finish. I find this beer exceedingly drinkable. It's not an overly impressive beer. Very basic, but I like it."
"D-I've been meaning to try it for awhile and they always try and pick some beer for me, so I can't complain"
"D - This is probably the best brew of this style that I've had. It tastes like a ""real"" beer unlike others of this style."
"pours a pale yellow with a lively three finger white frothy head. smells of sweet hops!? shockingly awesome, especially for an american adjunct lager. yeast and grain like you'd expect, but no metallic. tastes of high carbonation and sweet/tart watery grain. not too bad. one of three american lagers i can drink and be happy. go get some. it's the beer that made milwaukee famous! (the good land)"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked JAN1110-BO1201900. Sampled on February 22, 2010. It pours golden yellow with a short burst of white fizzy head and busy carbonation. There is a little malty note in the aroma along with grass and weak hops. The mouthfeel is around medium with a taste that brings out a lightly sour flavor of grass and thin hops. It does have something over the current formula but it is not significant."
"Notes - Maybe a little dry and bitter for me in the long run over a session but a smooth easy drinking beer. I would have liked a little more carbonation for mouthfeel but that's a minor complaint."
"Pours fizzy yellow with about an inch of head that settles quickly. Very, very clear, I can pretty much watch tv through the glass. The aroma is much sweeter than some other macro-lagers. Noticably maltier in taste than the lagers I'm used to tasting. Not much hop presence, the taste is overall a little more grainy sweetness than any type of bitterness. A very easy drinker, like any adjunct lager should be. A noticable step up from a lot of cheap lagers, but not really heads and tails better than a yeungling. Worth buying a six pack to watch a football game with."
"Schlitz Original 60s. I had heard about this and I figured I would give it a try. This beer was not much to look at, very pale yellow/gold, no head at all. Smell was had nice hints of hops and malt. The taste was sweet, with some hints of hops, very clean tasting. Mouthfeel was good, and of course this beer was very drinkable. Overall this is better then almost any other macro that I can think of. Its a no nonsense easy drinking lager. Would be nice on a summer day, grilling out, or just watching a game."
"Probably the biggest improvement over the current Schlitz is the mouth feel. The gusto feels richer and fuller. Not too big. Just right. I can drink this all night and wish I bought more than just a six pack. I wish the ""Gusto"" was distributed in Kentucky. This brew would have a regular place in my fridge."
"Overall, well worth a shot for an adjunct lager. Very reasonably priced and not overly offensive. Good for BMC drinkers looking for something with a touch of flavor."
" Nice work"
"This beer is all about nostalgia. It is the taste I remember as a kid and love it today."
"I think most reviewers have stated it all. What I would like to contribute is this. This beer is what American Lagers use to taste like. This is a clean tasting refreshing lager. A good session beer, especially on hot lazy summer days. The thing I like the most is this is the beer I can keep on hand for guests that like beer, but maybe not an Ale, IPA or Stout. When they leave I still have something on hand that I can enjoy. The other Macro-Brews feed my garden."
"Overall, This was an enjoyable beer for the mostpart, though the review could lead you to think otherwise. It does have more of a ""bite"" to it compared to other beers of this style (miller high life, coors) but doesn't stray too far. Don't know if that is for better or worse."
"Drinkability: the definition of drinkable, a tasty refreshing session beer."
"Overall I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I prefer it to nay of the BMC brews out there. It's got a bit of merit all on it's own due to it's great mouthfeel and fresh/clean flavors. No 'off' flavors on the macro. Pretty good stuff."
"Conclusion: The bottom line is that if I'm at a BMC-only establishment, I'll order this over the other macros every time. That being said, now that it's around $5.99 a sixer around here (and I can get Summit on sale for a dollar more) it's hard to make a case for buying this on any kind of a regular basis (though I do miss the 75 cent Schlitz happy hours)."
"Pours a light golden with a slight white head. Smells like a macro--overpowering sour with a little maltiness. The mouthfeel is thin but average for a macro. The flavor is... ah yes, like college. Reminds me of PBR. It's sour, but at least it's cold. I wasn't going to say it was horrible, but.. it's horrible. I got it for the novelty, and that's about all it's good for. Maybe I'll buy a sixer for my dad or grandpa--they'd probably get a kick out of it."
"I have always wondered what the iconic American brands tasted and drank like back in the day. If Schlitz was as good then as Schlitz Gusto is now, then it's even more disappointing how far the asshats at A-B, Miller and Coors have taken us down the road of, not even mediocrity, but godforsaken swillery. *This* is what an American pale lager should taste like."
"I feel as though I've been gushing all over this beer. Maybe I have, it is a damn fine beer. When I take the style in mind I haven't come across a better example yet. With that said, styles be damned! I just want my backyard beers clean, crisp and refreshing. Schlitz Gusto fits the bill. This will be in the icebox often for just such an occasion all summer long, what's left."
"Poured a clear, light yellow with no head. Probably not even meant to be drank from a glass... Aroma of pilsner malts, light hops and a champagne note. Light bodied mouthfeel that is sweet with crisp carbonation and subtle hop aftertaste. Just the kiss of the hops as the commercials used to say. Very good drinkability with not much flavor. I wouldn't stock my fridge at home with this, but wouldn't turn it down if offered to me from someone else's."
"D: It's no Prima Pils, but it's definitely head and shoulders above all the other beers in its price range."
"Overall, it's far above the typical watery, over-carbonated, flavorless macros that we get today. A very good session beer for a hot summer day, and easy on the palate. I will be drinking it again, because it offers a reasonably good quality at a minimal price."
"D- A decent flavor with an easy feel. Really drinkable."
"Not a real lager fan but this Schlitz is a very drinkable refreshing beer."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard chalice. This beer pours a crystal clear straw with just a slight white head that left no lacing. The aroma is sweet corn, crackers and just a whiff of grassy hops. The flavor follows suit with sweet corn dominating the flavor profile. Biscuits and crackers come out from the pale malts. There is definitely a kiss of grass/floral hops that come out at the very tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is rather sweet for the style and doesn't finish with any of the dryness that's associated with the American Adjunct Lagers. Like most decently done Macro's, its easily drinkable, especially on a hot day. I have no problem with Macro Lagers, when they are decently well made and Gusto follows along those lines."
"Overall, one of the better American macro lagers. The grassiness borders on skunkiness and does wear on me a bit. Probably won't buy it again, but I can assume from the packaging their 60's formula is superior to their 2000's formula."
"Macros are always hard to review, compared to the more flavorful brews I generally drink. For the style, this is quite nice. It has just enough flavor to keep it interesting, and none of the off-flavors often found in the style. I probably won't sit and ponder the flavors of this again, but I'll be back to it when choices are limited."
"Tastewise, The hops play a good role in the flavour as well as the nose. Sure, the malt is up front with some corny tones and some sweetish tones but dag nab it, then some nice hop bitterness moves in and it dominates the finish. Good aftertaste from those hops as well. A much better product than the cans that they have been putting out all these years and something that I could easily revisit. Darn drinkable and darn tasty. I like."
"Thanks for the Legend for the sample bottle."
"12oz brown bottle served in a pilsner glass. Pours a brilliant pale straw color with a finger of white head. A bit of sulfur and corn in the aroma. Also some noble hops. Sulfur fades quickly. Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Crisp with a little bit of sweet malt. Fair amount of noble hop bite. Light and drinkable. I'm not sure what all the hype is about, give me a good Euro pilsner or helles over this any day."
"While it's of course not even close to a Munich Helles or something, it actually has some flavor that isn't bad like most adjunct lagers. For the cheap price, it's not bad at all."
"Clear, pale golden with a fizzy white head that quickly settles into a thin collar. Smells of untoasted grain and grits with a lemon citrus hop note. Tastes like a better version of every macro lager I've ever had, crisp and refreshing with soft lemon and hay flavors balanced nicely with mild hop bitterness. Medium bodied and well carbonated, finishes squeaky clean. Top of the heap in this category."
"This is not the greatest beer EVAR!!!!111eleventy! But it is good for what it is, which is an all malt American lager. Rock your world? Hardly. But it may rock your summer cookout, if you're gutsy enough to let it. Not world class, but perhaps top of its class."
"I'm old enough to remember when Schlitz was one of, if not the, best selling beers in the USA. ""Go for all the gusto you can grab"" was the slogan, I believe, ad their adds featured sailors in exotic ports. Anyway, more to the point; Schlitz pours a nice straw-golden color typical of American Lagers. There is little head and what there is rapidly thins to a trace. The taste is mild and not objectionable. The body is thin. There is little in the way of hop flavour or odor - but that is typical of the style. I would say it is a little better than average for this category. I keep some around to have when I'm in the mood for an AAL and for cooking ham."
"D: Very clean, and decent. Easy to nail a bunch of these guys. i normally can't stand to drink a beer from the bottle, but, would have no trouble with this. Will buy again, once it gets hot in here in St. Louis...sometimes, a guy just needs an easy drinking, lower ABV, plain old American macro style lager. This, and PBR do it for me."
"Blipped ""Mucho Gusto"" by the Aquabats"
""
"Perfect beer to ice down and throw back a 6pk or two during those hot muggy summers in the south. If you like hops like I do, then this is the new lawn mower beer for you."
"Drinkability - for all its pluses I can't see drinking all that many of these - maybe its all the old timers telling me schlitz old formula gave a lot of people head aches - but its one of those beers that I don't react well with."
"D- A very drinkable session (domestic) beer. Please don't let this one go into hibernation again."
"Overall: It's really hard to find any faults with this beer. While it's thinner and lighter than, say, a true Munich Helles, it shares many of the same qualities--just scaled down. Overall, however, I'd have to say this is exceptional for its style. Whereas I generally consider the best macro lagers to simply be the least offensive, this is affirmatively good. I would take this hands down over the typical macro swill available at your corner tavern. I really, REALLY hope they start carrying this at my local bowling alley."
"D--Very nice with food, one to savor of this style. I wouldn't go out of the way for it but I wouldn't kick it out of ""bed""."
"Taste: Petty flavorful and drinkable for an adjunct lager. It seems more substantial than many others of the same style. I'd probably give it a 4 out of 5 on the taste if it had a bigger bitter finish."
"I'm a craft beer and beer snob first and foremost. So understanding that I like a Hopdevil or a good Rodenbach is key to the fact that any good beer can be balanced with the quintessential lawnmower/party beer. As for this beer I give it high marks because it takes a lot to make a beer that will show imperfections as much as a pimple will always rear it's ugly head on prom night. This beer pours clean and clear with a fine head in the right pilsner glass (I happen to own a Schlitz glass). Taste of malt and corn with a light-bodied finish. Not for the hopheads, the Belgian freaks, or the barrel-aged fanatic. This is 1960 in a bottle ready for summer and a stroll through suburbia. So sit back and have a brewski with the bud's and enjoy..."
"D--Yes, but not necessarily a slammer. Stop to enjoy it. I get what they're doing here. Obvious parallels in taste, quality, image to High Life...and that is totally fine by me!"
"What can u say about Schlitz Gusto (the 60s formula in a bottle)? Well, if it was good enough for my late father and grandfather to drink, then I must say it's good enough for me. I was excited when i found out Schlitz was going to bottle its old formula and the beer lives up to the hype, at least for me. I gave a couple of warm bottles of this stuff to my neighbor to put in his fridge, but he couldn't wait and drank 'em warm and he loved them. I prefer to drink my beer cold, and it's pleasure in every sip. Maybe I'm just being nostalgic but I do like this beer enough to give it high marks across the board. It's definitely not the beer Schlitz brews in a can. I picked up a 12-pack at Delock's Liquors in Munster, Indiana over the Christmas holidays and I plan on getting more on my next trip north."
"It is a cheap macro that is widely available in the midwest. For being what it is and compared to the rest of the style, it is a step above the competition. There is a slightly bitter taste that I was not prepared for but welcomed. Great macro. May have to become my go to beer."
"12 ounce bottle, served in a Sam Adams BL glass. The beer pours a clear gold color with about an inch frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. The aroma is sweet malt and grain/adjuncts. Not an offensive aroma, but not exactly pleasing either. It tastes like grain/corn, sweet malt and a bit of lemon and hops. Mouthfeel is light, has a clean finish and isn't watery. Drinkability is pretty good, it wouldn't be hard to drink as a session beer at all. I wouldn't mind having this as a summer/lawnmower beer. For the style, it's pretty good. I think it's a good macro/adjunct lager, the next time I'm in the mood for this style of beer I'd definitely pick this up. It's better than I was expecting, and it's certainly a step up from most BMC beers of the same style."
"Drinkability- Well, gotta admit that I could drink at least a couple of these, especially when hot weather hits. This really isn't too bad at all- definitely one of the better ""macros"" I've had."
"In my opinion the best lawn mower beer I've found to date. No everyday lager from BMC this well made. However at $6.50 a six pack I will probably fall back to PBR. It's not as good but it's good enough and priced right."
"The carbonation adds some nice mouthfeel, and the taste is about what you'd expect for a good American macro. If this was the only thing around, I'd not object."
"D- This beer is very soft and mellow with very little flavor, however there are no off flavors that stand out so it is very easy to drink. I will have to try this one again as a thirst quencher when it gets to 110 degrees next summer."
"Pours much like any BMC product with a bit more of a substantial head and a bit more lacing. Slightly corny, mild hop kiss, but otherwise listless and grainy, though admittedly a step up from the sickening sweetness of most macros. Less corn, more cereal graininess and just the slightest kiss of fruity hops. Light bodied and fizzy with a crisp, refreshingly dry finish. Not really sure what the BFD is about this beer. Probably a pretty decent option for a macro lager if Sam Adams or Yuengling is not available, but really just an average, though refreshing, macro lager."
"Ordered a bottle at Palmer's Bar on Cedar Ave. Poured into a pint glass, it appears a clear straw gold. After reading about this beer, my expectations we a little high, but it's really just a better macro lager. The corn element is still present, though there is a quick hint of hops in the flavor and a mix of bready malts with the vegetable notes. Drinkable and certainly a decent macro, if you're into that sort of thing."
"Damn decent beer even if it isn't flashy or big in body or flavors. I like the freshness, it makes me feel like I got my dollars worth and I forget that I am drinking cheap beer. I also love the marketing, with the old school label and the 60's looking posters I really feel like I am drinking a brew that my grandfather might have swigged on. Well done Schlitz, I am a new fan."
"D- Gusto? More than any other macro. This is a pretty damn fine drinkable macro. It ranks right up there with Grain Belt, in my opinion. Will drink again."
"Once I get past the smell the taste is sweet, some malt or grain and some hops. Not bad. Mouth feel is kind of dry on the finish and this beer is drinkable."
"Asfar as American Macro Lagers go this is the best I have had. Very good and delisish. Could drink this all day long."
"Into a pint glass, pours a nice light golden color with a nice half inch white head, some nice lacing too, off to a good start. The aroma is small, but can pick up traces of crackers, hops, a bit buttery, and clean. Nothing great, but doesn't detract. The taste is solid, crisp and clean. Pale malt, some crackers, and a nice amount of hops here make the taste above average for the style, with a solid body, light carbonation, and pretty smooth. In all, pretty darn good for a style I loath, wouldn't mind tipping back a few of these."
"Surprisingly good, easily the best macro-style lager I've ever had. I'd take this over BMC any day, and it even eclipses High Life and Grain Belt."
"My son just bought me a 12 pack of the old 60's formula Schlitz. I drank Schlitz back then as a kid and in the army and its every bit as good now as then. At one time Schlitz was the best selling brand in the U.S. next to Bud. Great taste for a non dark beer."
"I'd take this over any of its macro peers in a heartbeat. It makes me want to stay up all night, play poker and smoke cheap cigars, and I think that's exactly the point."
"Overall a very easy drinking beer."
"The 1960's formula pours a brilliantly clear straw color with a quickly diminishing white head. The aroma is medium-low graininess, a bit of corn and a hint of spicy hop. The flavor is moderately sweet, a little musty malt, a bit of corn and low hop bitterness. The carbonation is medium-high but beer is still rather smooth. The beer finishes clean with just a bit of lingering malty sweetness. Overall a well done example of the style. Easy drinking but with more flavor than most examples. At $4.99 a six pack, worth picking up, maybe even go for the 12 pack."
"Drinkablity: Nice quality, very drinkable and easygoing beer."
"Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma of pale malt, floral hops and just a hint of yeast. Flavor is pilsner malt, light fruit and light hops. Light bodied, somewhat sticky texture. Long sweet finish. Really quite a few steps above any other mass produced pale lager available. This might become a staple in my fridge."
"They pretty much hit the mark with bringing back this recipe. It's been a while since I had a reformulated version, but this version seems far less bitter from what I recall. I would probably have to drink the two recipes side by side to really break the differences down. But I like this new/old recipe."
"I honestly don't think a macro lager can get any better than this. True, it's no Two Hearted or Arrogant Bastard, but for what its going for its fantastic."
