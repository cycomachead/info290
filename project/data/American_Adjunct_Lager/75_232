Everyone knows the color but for posterity's sake its bright yellow and has pretty minimal white fizz rimming the glass. Smells like creamed corn seasoned with a nondescript apple-like fruitiness due to under-aging with a dash of skunky marsh vegetation. True to form, I do find this to be the corniest of the mainstream Mexican fizz parade, with corn bread and DMS cooked veggie flavors running the show. Sweeter and breadier than Pacifico with subtle apple and citrus notes. Some people claim they can taste a hint of lime in this even without the iconic wedge added. Sure, although its probably a mirage.  I'd actually say the carbonation is moderate. Thin, watery, and finishes predictably sweet with a bare hint of grass. The corn and skunk elements do add some character than is missing from American examples of the style (but see my above remark about conditioning. Don't mistake this preference for "good beer"). Most people pay little attention when drinking this but I suggest you do so, for educational purposes if nothing else. Skip the lime too, at least once.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 31, 2014"

It's not going to be anything like your supah-fancy exquiste craft brews. Alone, without the customary lime, it is sorta nasty and smells skunky. And it looks like straight up piss. But add that magical slice of lime- make sure to squeeze out all the juices, I mean really lime it up, use a gigantic slice of lime, and BAM, you have a kick-ass refreshing beverage. Sure- it's not really the beer we are reviewing at this point, more of a beer-lime shandy type thing, but my god, it is refreshing and delicious. Tell me a better beer to put a lime in. This blows Bud Light Lime out of the water. It is cheap and refreshing. Also, by sheer chance, my review averaged out to a rating of 4.20. Blaze up fellow beer advocates.

The popularity of this beer proves that  strategic marketing can sell millions of beers, not the taste or quality of the product. The brew has a watery,sour grain and flat taste that can be rather repulsive. People that defend this beer always say "you have to drink it with lime!" I understand where they are coming from, the lime masks the bland taste and adds some flavour. Lime should never need to be added in order to make a beer tolerable.  It amazes me how popular corona extra is and how they try to position it as a premium brew.

A couple others said it looks like urine.  They are not wrong.  I drink it at my local Tex Mex joint on Corona Thursdays. Special low price, as it should be.  I wedge a lime in the neck of the bottle to pretend there's something flavorful about this beer.  But there really isn't.  Aroma is not rotten vegetables, though.  It's just faint corn grains, nothing special.  No head to speak of.  The taste is weak, but smooth.  Mouthfeel is acceptable.  It's an acceptable, mediocre beer.  You can drink a few at a time and it's not going to faze you.  Get it on special and wedge that lime in.  Enough said.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Nov 06, 2014"

1.61,-30.3,2,1.5,1.5,2.25,1.5,"DATE REVIEWED: July 5, 2014... GLASSWARE: Blanche de Chambly pokal (though tough to choose one, considering this is mostly a bottle-to-mouth beer... OCCASION: the comedown after two solid days of eating, drinking and celebrating...APPEARANCE: blur-inducing golden yellow body with minimal bubbles forming; quickly disintegrating white head forms a pencil-thin circle; zero lacing... AROMA: some metallic pings, but mostly a blank slate to sift other scents between; faint bubblegum and biscuit ... PALATE: where this one wins at least in its functionality--as enjoyed the past two days, a clean, clean palate-cleansing body that thinly holds to a beer-like guise--mostly water; when held on its own merit sans setting, a liquid pure and simple... TASTE: is it corn chip? just corn? bitter malt ping of a Vienna lager minus all that complexity--a syrupy ending leaves a little aftertaste, but a bit beefy if chewed...who knew the lack of a lime could be so detrimental to the overall experience?... OVERALLL: after oscillating between this and Starr Hill's wheat, I found my Fourth of July well enjoyed mostly due to the family, food and fireworks...the beer itself served to quench thirst and balance out the grill carbs, and little else...I do believe this review would have been more complimentary if the lime were present, as I even had difficulty selecting a proper drinking vessel...","dacrza1","Jul 05, 2014"

At the stinking hot beach in Mexico? Yes. A Corona is welcome. While its composition is not a masterpiece by any means, it is refreshing and dare I say, pleasant. Its skunkiness is debatably "by design" and has become a characteristic trait of this brew. Its ABV is low and its produced in the millions of barrels. Yet, again, it is refreshing and hydrating with the right setting. Would I pick this over a fresh DIPA at home? No. Would I pick a fresh DIPA over a Corona in 115 degree weather in a sunny beach? Maybe - never had the option.","HoppySeb","May 05, 2014"

I hate to sound so harsh, but if it weren't for the three limes that I shoved in the bottle, this would have been an absolute drain-pour from the beginning. As the beer sat and warmed out of pure neglect (I couldn't bring myself to continue sipping on a regular basis), it got even worse. I suppose it's drinkable if you add a lime or two while it's ice cold... Anything less and it's drain material. Go for Miller Lite if you're reduced to drinking a light lager.","ThePaintedGrey","Jun 19, 2013"

I always made sure it was as cold as possible ( if it warmed up i was always sorry). I often drank it in mini bottles, added a pinch of salt, then juiced about 1/2 a lime. By this time there was very little remnant of the actual flavor of the beer remaining. Its a very musty smelling beer. There's this faint bitterness, accompanied by a corn after taste. The carbonation is also a killer. That being said as long as it was fully doctored, I wouldn't completely avoid this beer, but I definitely cannot and have not ever been able to drink one straight. For now I will stick to beer that has the ability to be delicious on it's own !","devlishdamsel","Apr 12, 2013"

Whatever I was riding in was dark, dusty, and shaking from side to side. Sweat beaded down my face and I came to realize my situation: I somehow made it to Mexico again. Fuck. Suddenly my transport halted and I flew face first into the front of the hot metal cab. I heard several footsteps, definitely those of short Mexican men. The back doors flew open and I was blinded by the Sun. They grabbed me and threw me onto the dirt. "No mas, amigo! Andale!" I looked around to see what looked to be the Great Wall of Arizona and walked in what I thought was a straight line. The Mexican van took off spitting dust into the air. As I approached the border line, I reached into my pocket, finding a little crumpled paper with my handwriting. It read, "The secret ingredient to Corona: One Part Mexican Water, One Part Chicken Piss."","BoFoSho","Feb 26, 2013"

The classic clean glass bottle of 355 ml, who everyones love to hate, ABV 4.5 on my bottle. Very pale, piss yellow colour, with one finger of white froathy head, very low retention and of course no lacing on the glass. Great activity in the glass though. Lots of adjuncts on the nose, with the corn being quite obvious, but at least it doesn’t have the "wet cornflakes" smell. Probably is covered by the light citrus notes. The corn is much more obvious on the taste. Nothing else to mention here. Very thin, almost watery on the body, saved by its high carbonation. Overall, what can I say that is not already written?

The taste starts crisp due to the carbonation with a hint of mild hop bitterness. Not much in terms of complexity, fairly weak flavor. Overall, it's been a long time since I had a Corona and after this one it will be a long while again, not much of anything, not a fan.","hopfacebrew","Feb 04, 2012"

It is a bit like a Cream Ale, reminiscent of NG's Spotted Cow, which is very surprising to me. All in all, this has to be my favorite incarnation of Corona, thus far; the concept of anything other than clear glass longnecks, though pragmatically a better idea, has long seemed sacrilege - but no more - as this is likely my go-to cheap fizzy swill from here on out.

Take Blue Moon for example. It says specifically on the bottle that you should have it with a slice of orange (which is a good suggestion if you ask me), however, Corona never says that other than in their ads.

I also get the rice taste mixing in with the yeasty taste. Its not that bad. The corn syrup malty taste tries to hold up against the watery body and does an OKAY job at it.

The head is completely white, and the body is yellow and completely see through, it also has more carbonation than any beer I can seen in a long time. The body is also completely transparent, the head is pretty much gone, but not to the bare bone, it holds on a little bit which is good. Overall it looks like an adjunct lager, nothing impressive here. The first thing I pick up on the nose is skunk, this is a skunky beer for sure, too bad too, because I think I can actually detect some hops behind that skunk, which is rare for a adjunct lager, after that I smell some sweet malt. I have to give it some credit for having a hop characteristic to it, but for the most part, it's not going to be a good beer because of that skunk. Well it's hard to dissect any flavor out from underneath that skunk flavor, but if I had to it would be that little bit of hops and tiny bit of malt. The skunk just totally overpowers this beer. It's not a god awful taste, like some adjunct lagers have, but it's not a good taste. I mean it's drinkable, and somewhat refreshing, but for the most part it's all skunk. The mouthfeel is very interesting, it has a very fizzy, maybe even thick mouthfeel, so...it's not a typically "good" mouthfeel, but I'll give it some points for being creative. Overall, it doesn't have many good qualities, but it is a unique beer, even if it is because it's so skunky. People always say "Corona and lime" for a reason, it's because it has a unique taste (that tastes happens to go well with limes, but that's aside the point). This isn't a good beer, but I don't want to call it a bad beer, despite what my numbers say, it's drinkable and unique. Fine maybe it is a bad beer, but it's above some of the other bad beers.","MaltsOfGlory","Apr 28, 2011"

It is a little stale and watery without any sweet/corn flavor that most of the style have. The aftertaste lingers and you will burp it for quite some time. There is no question that this beer ice cold is a great warm weather beer (pounding a 6 pack without any ill effects). I think it gets a little more bashing here because of the hype and I can certainly understand that. From a value standpoint, Corona is aweful. It is WAY to expensive.

2.63,13.9,5,2,2,2.5,4,"Corona is to beer what the hot brainless blond cheerleeder you went to high school with is to people. Looks great, but no substance. For some reason, that beer in a bottle that's just been pulled out of the ice and is condenced over is pretty near to the most appealing looking I've ever seen. I'm not sure why, I find this so asethetically pleasing since you could also argue pretty well that Corona's color is a dead ringer for urine. Anyway, this forced me to rate the rest of the attributes a little lower than I otherwise would have. First, because the price is a big turnoff imo and for that reason I don't think I'd reccomend this very often. They charge real premium beer prices for Corona, and that's ridiculous. There's no excuse. The quality sure as hell isn't justification, and neither is the fact that its an "import". How much more could it possibly cost to ship this to NJ than say Sierra Nevada? Anyway, the smell, taste, and feel are nothing to write home about. They aren' t good or bad, just extremely bland. There's a tiny bit of sweetness, a very vague notion of hops, you can tell this was better done than say Budwieser, and its got enough body that you won't mistake it for light beer. But that's it. Nothing much hear folks. The reason why lime does so much for Corona is because that's almost all you can taste if you drop in a lime wedge. This is in sharp contrast to the couple of "Whites" I've tried of late, which go well with citrus because the citrus compliments their own noticable flavor. The only time I reccomend Corona is if you plan on drinking beer at a barbeque all day, and its real hot out and someone else has paid for it(If I wasn't concerned about inflating the overall rating past what I think it deserves, I'd give Corona's drinkability a 5). Then its bland inoffensiveness would come in handy. Otherwise you could probably get yourself two of something that tastes much better for what Corona costs. Its not awful though. I might pay the ripoff price if all I could have was Corona, or one of our American "Big 3".","casualbeerman","Dec 29, 2005"

This beer has tons of carbonation, and the taste is a tad of corn, finishing a bit watery, a very one-sided beer, for the price in most markets I've been in, this goes for 6-7 dollars a sixer - anyone can do much better.

Best thing I ever did with the brew was a small blind taste test with a couple of friends ( with notoriously long neck swilling taste ) and it was soundly beated by all of the usual mass produced lites. Only positive note is the lemon that adds some vitamins, otherwise it's a waste of calories.

No hop bitterness. The beer was skunky (clear bottles). I really wanted to give this one a fair shake. I do not recommend this.

However, while in Ensenada this summer this beer was no where to be seen. You had to specially ask for this beer, and it wasn't on billboards or the television commercials. No the marketing is for those Americans just show them the picture with the lime wedged in the bottle, then we'll see some response from them. Yep, that is basically what happened this beer became popularized with commercials not with a good taste. So, as I pour this beer in WV during early January, I almost know it is a mistake. However, I am giving it a shot. When i poured this golden (as in color of piss) it fizzled like a can of soda, and the head was gone by the time I looked at the screen and back down to my pint glass. At first scent it seems very unpleasant, but when I taste it, this beer contains relatively no flavors. It does have a mild citrusy sweetness, but there is really nothing here. For being so big with the average beer drinker, I wasn't expecting much here. This beer is not one that I plan to drink ever again.","WVbeergeek","Jan 08, 2003"

It had a little bit of sweetness, grain, and vegetables and a touch of hops. All of these flavors were bullied around by the intense carbonation, though. Not a particularly good beer.

Not a great beer to sit back and enjoy, but after a frustrating day at work and the unusal sunny skies and hot weather here, this is a decent beer to keep from getting too parched.

People love it. The image of a "relaxed, carefree, coastal attitude"? Yes. Trendiness. Yes. Marketing. Yes. The Lime... ... Can we forget about all of the history and just taste the beer? The color is a nice yellow gold with a white head that holds up OK. No lace. There's a distinct, somewhat unique and lightly sweet malty aroma, with maybe a touch of hop lurking in the background. Nothing really off. The body's medium/light with a fine and moderate carbonation level. The flavor is not nearly as sweet as the aroma suggests, but rather, it's accompanied by a dull, earthy bitterness. The finish leaves a lingering bitterness and some light maltiness but no hop flavor. But then again, there are no off-flavors either! Not a real well made beer, but not horrid by any stretch. Now I have something to add to the history... When this beer came on the scene Miller Lite was still big. Dry beers had just passed through town. This offered something more without being hoppy or bitter. Apart from all the marketing... people liked it. Let it go.","NeroFiddled","Aug 07, 2002"
