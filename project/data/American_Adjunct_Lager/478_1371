I've read the reviews and don't get it. I think, if it's not BAC over 5.9, it's considered piss water.

Nose is a weak spot though with some cereal grain and hint of canned veggies, but the flavor on the palate is a decent malty-grainy taste with balance of hops to make it have some overall flavor worth enjoying.  Too many adjunct lagers seem designed to have as little flavor as possible, but this one is more flavor forward and a decent flavor.  If I was a regular adjunct drinker, then this would be in my fridge fairly often.","yemenmocha","Jan 31, 2015"

2.8,6.5,,,,,,"Bottle poured into a glass in a Calgary pub devoid of other options. There is a decent chance that this was the first beer I ever tried (when I was probably around 8 years old?). It tasted awful back then and is marginally better now. This was once a best-seller out here in the West along with Molson Canadian and the still ubiquitous Molson Pilsener but has since receded into the background as tastes have evolved and as other macro-breweries have gained ascendency since the 80s and 90s. A pale straw color and almost devoid of aroma beyond a vague sweet graininess. You might read things about the ""blue jacket"" on certain western Canadian barley varieties that imparts a distinctive dryness. Sure, whatever ... Although it is indeed the case that this brew is more crisp and dry than many of its adjunct lager competitors. Features a very subtle fruitiness that evokes apples and grapes, a generic white bread maltiness, almost no hop aroma or flavor, a massive dose of carbonation, and a faintly metallic semi-dry finish. I think this compares favorably to something like the massively sweet Sleeman's Original Draught, but you might be better served saving such comparisons for tickers like myself who keep finding themselves in places that remain craft-phobic. I do not get the same nostalgia here that Molson Pilsener evokes.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 06, 2014"

The beer, as a whole, is surprisingly very flat and doesn't bear much taste, although I wouldn't say it isn't drinkable and likely easy to session. I will try to see if I can pick up other Labatt flavors throughout the rest of the year (Light, Royale Light, Lime, Max Ice, etc) , but these beers, after the disappointing flagship brand, will be one of the last I seek out, especially since finding single bottles of some of them proves to be a grating challenge and I doubt I'll be able to drink a six or twelve pack of these before they expire, if they're anything like regular Blue.","SteveJeremy","Jul 09, 2014"

2.92,11,4,3.25,2.5,3,3,"Labatt Blue brewed Labatt Brewing Company Ltd. This brew has an Avb of 5% pours out a nice amber color with a thick white head. This brew looks like American style lager. Nothing good but nothing bad. The smell is good&has a rich smell of beer. At this point I'm liking this brew. Now for the taste. At first you get some richness but goes away fast. After that, it is just flat and than nothing. To me it tastes like flat bud light. It is smooth but ,the taste, there is nothing there. Mouth feel is ok it reminds me of a light beer. I can not tell the 5.0 abv. I feel if there was more of a taste this brew I would like it better. Overall, I'm giving this brew a 3 out of 5. Not the worst brew I had, but not the best.","nicholas2121","Apr 07, 2014"

No disrespect to any of those corporations. Ya pay a little more in the states with it being imported. The color and mouthfeel is light and uneventful but not offensive. Slight tracing in the glass, goes away quickly. Don't get me wrong, a drinkable beer, a buyable beer, drank it in Toronto and thought it was better there on tap. Leaves a heavy sharpy, alcohol residue on the tongue, so I wouldn't recommend combining it with other brews.","ChiChi","Feb 22, 2014"

Smell is of malt, grain, and grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and slight vegetal flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a slightly below average beer that is drinkable but the vegetal quality I am getting in the flavor isn't too enjoyable.","UCLABrewN84","May 25, 2013"

The first beer I ever drank was Labatt Blue in a red Solo cup. It was the beer we brought to the park before we were old enough to drink in bars and probably what I drank the night I kissed my first college girlfriend. My tastes have changed since then, but I still consider it a great beer for parties, camping trips, tailgating, and other situations where you just want to drink a bunch of watery beer with your friends.","danreitz","Nov 14, 2012"

Smell is weak, mostly grain malt, strong on corn. A little grassy hop smell is barely noticeable. I'm having trouble picking out any specific thing in the taste to describe. It's incredibly watery, with thin flavors of corn and not much else. Finish is metallic and dry. Overall it's drinkable, but almost literally tasteless. It's not...offensive, I'll give it that, but only because there are no flavors strong enough to be offensive. But I guess that's the goal of the AAL style; to be inoffensive to the largest amount of people. In that, this beer (if you can call it that) succeeds.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jul 19, 2012"

The flavor follows to a T, and I'm struggling to temper my disappointment in the relative lack of flavor with my expectations of the style. The body is predictably watery, but the carbonation does show some signs of life/assertiveness.

The taste is what you'd expect from a sturdy adjunct lager. Blue rises above most of its American counterparts by being slightly more flavorful and thus, less bitter. Most domestic lagers seem so light to me that the carbonation creates a dominant bitterness in the flavor and mouth feel. Not so here. That's why Labatt Blue so middle of the road. It's flavorful enough that it's not offensive to the mouth, but light enough that it doesn't leave a lasting impression.

By no means is this beer worth that price tag, buy at bars it is the cheapest beer you can buy. I've had this beer, in cans, in bottle, on tap. The different delivery modes, really don't affect this beer at all, it all tastes the exact same. When poured into a glass, it has a nice deep golden yellow color, and nice one inch head that sticks the whole way down. Smells of adjuncts, adjuncts, adjuncts! Specifically corn, and of that stock beer smell. For a macro its average, as they all smell of adjuncts. Blue has a very smooth crisp taste, nice hop bitterness, its surprising to taste hops in a macro, but this has it. Just a real enjoyable taste. Nice full, smooth mouthfeel, very satisfying. This beer is an easy session beer, when cold it goes down like water, and pairs nicely with pizza and chicken wings.

Flavors also pick up on the corn flavors (from sulfur and pilsner malts). A residual corn-like sweetness proves quite distracting.

3,14.1,3,3,3,3,3,"This is probably the most dead average beer I've ever had. It's certainly tolerable, but also very obviously unspectacular. Color is dark enough that you probably won't mistake it for Bud or Miller, but not dark enough that you'd ever mistake it for say Pilsner Urquell. Head is a little less foamy than something like Bud, but still not very stable. Smell is of a little bit of grain with the adjunct fortunately towards the background. The hops are pretty light, but at least detectable. Taste is middle of the road too. The grain taste is there, if a little bit light with the adjunct once again just barely detectable. There is a little bit of sweetness balanced out with a little bit of bitterness. It's not a deep flavor, but its stronger than any of the ""Big 3", although rather less bitter. And its less funky than either any of them or Rolling Rock. Mouthfeel tends a bit to the light side I could do with a bit less carbonation as well. Drinkability is actually probably above average, (though certainly not a 5), but I have never happened to drink more than one of these at a time and besides which I just think 3's accross the board suit this beer very well. I might have said the same thing about Rolling Rock, but Labatt Blue is really the best macro style I've had. Though its more expensive and less widely available so its not as always around as a fallback while Rolling Rock almost always is. It doesn't do anything majorly wrong, its clean tasting and a safe bet. But it sure doesn't do anything special either. I could probably drink this all night if there was nothing special around, and still enjoy myself. And it'd definately be my choice if I happened to be hosting a bunch of people who really prefer American style Macro brews (not that I know enough people who prefer that style for me to bother). But I sure wouldn't go out of my way to get a Labatt Blue. Though when you consider this is the Canadian equivlent of either Bud or Coors, you've got to give them props for having better tase than the average American.

The flavor delivers a thin, sweetish, obviously adjunct-laden (there's no real grain flavor present) malt that's balanced by a firm bitterness. It finishes clean and dry with little residual aftertaste. It's not a bad mass-produced lager by any means. In fact, it's probably one of the better ones. But the slightly elevated hop bitterness leaves me wanting more, and it's just not there. No real hop aroma, no hop flavor, no real graininess. Crisp and well-balanced, but lacking in character.","NeroFiddled","Jul 27, 2003"

This really is not that good, but not bad either. Very light. Piss colored with no head. Which makes me never want to pour it into a glass again. It's not like I am getting more flavor eitherways.

This brew is soft all around with a bland, but innocuous grainy malt profile coupled with a very light hop bitterness.  Corn flavors are surpsingly subdued.
