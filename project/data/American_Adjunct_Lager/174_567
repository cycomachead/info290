2.64,2.3,3,2,3,2.75,2.5,"A very crisp, light beer. I'm guessing all the bad reviews are from people who want a bold, slap-in-the-face taste to their beer. Sometimes you drink beer just to get a buzz. If that's what you're after, you could do way worse than rolling rock. I would rank beers like bud light, Coors light, michelob light, nattie light, etc below rolling rock.","Garrion335","Friday at 08:56 PM"

It's nothing fancy, has no good taste nor bad, no good smell nor bad, and gives you a decent buzz which doesn't hang around with any nasty headaches.  So when I can get an 18 pack for 12 bucks it's hard to find a reason not to when funds are tight.  It's no Aventinus, but I can get 2.5 bottles of Aventinus for the price of an 18 pack of Rolling Rock.  One is an everyday drinker, the other is a weekend brew.  Both have merit.","bodog81","Mar 16, 2015"

2.94,14,3,2.75,3,3,3,"I bought a six-pack of Rolling Rock last night (Valentine's Day), partly for nostalgic reasons, and also because I just haven't had this in a long, long time.  in fact, as soon as I opened the bottle and began to pour it, I noticed that it differed from what I remembered from about twenty years ago.  It's a very light, pale straw color, watery, with heavy carbonation, almost like seltzer water.  The taste is actually blander than I remember too, but I do like the dry aftertaste.  It's not an awful beer, but definitely nothing stellar.  I miss what it used to be, but then again, maybe my memory has shifted toward the optimistic spectrum, given my youthful appreciation of the brew.  And also, my Grandpa loved this stuff when it was brewed in PA.  All in all, an average AAL in every sense.  Definitely better than Bud, MGD, etc.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Feb 15, 2015"

I get no nasty after taste like i do on other brands, it does have a dry finish to me. For the price and the way it sets on you the next day, I would recommend it to friends, that being said, there will be those who don't like it!

2.8,8.5,2.75,2.75,2.75,2.75,3,"one of the better schwag beers, at least it was until it went corporate. not its adjuncty and lazy like the rest of them. it is a lot better than a coors or a bud light though, with some actual flavor in here, aside from the weird fermentables they react this with. its definitely thin though, watery in feel even though its carbonated like a soda. hops seem false too, i have to look for them, and when i find them, they are fakey and forced. malt base is super light, corny but not sweet, which is its real redeeming value. its also real drinkable being so light, and has something above the others like it, in that its still beer. sweetness lingers, but it stays super chuggable. in a situation where there is no good beer, i would drink this. if this wasnt present and it was bud or miller, i would chose not to drink at all. i guess thats about all i can say for this. i also grew up on it, which helps for nostalgic reasons, but nothing more than college swill here. its gone downhill...","StonedTrippin","Oct 10, 2014"

But compared to your Buds, Millers and such, this is a real nice beer. Aroma is not the greatest, do I detect a hint of skunkiness?. Overall, the taste is slightly crisp but does have a little more lingering aftertatste than I prefer with this type of beer.

Otherwise there are others from the style I'd take over this. I think what's best about this beer is not what it is, but rather what it isn't.

Nothing fantastic, just a basic lagery, bubbly, malt beverage to quench your thirst or wash down some pizza or wings. If you can get it cheap in the summer, it is a great lawnmower beer. Still, if you pay over five bucks for a sixer of these, get your head examined. Again, this beer is not bad, it just is not that good. A classic and an OK beer.","BeerDocT","Jun 21, 2014"

The quality and taste did change when AB-InBev bought out Rolling Rock and moved production out of Pennsylvania. It pours real pale yellow, with a soapy head the dissolves quickly, and sparkles with carbonation. You get a mineral watery, malty taste, that is finished with a sweet taste. There is a malt aftertaste, no edge, light in body, and not filling. Good with food, working, and fishing.","ChristopherWIU-UTPA","Apr 10, 2014"

However, when times are tough, or even if they are not, why not get the most bang for your buck? I recently purchased a twelve pack of this beer for $8.94 . Any other beer in this genre that could be purchased at a competitive price would invariably cause headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and /or death. That being said, Rolling Rock is the supreme A.J.L. insofar as it has never caused me any of these symptoms, and has always given me a decent and refreshing buzz, without swelling my midsection into a gelatinous slime. At only 142 calories and $0.75 per 12 oz. bottle, Rolling Rock is my preferred session/go-to beer. A great value, and in the context of the genre, the best you are going to get as far as taste and mouth feel. DO NOT PURCHASE IN CANS! Bottles are far superior in flavor...and painting. Do not attempt to pour into a glass either! There is not much in the way of appearance or lacing to behold here. This is a beer for the masses, to be enjoyed straight out of the bottle, and for a reasonable price and caloric content. If you wear a monocle, and/or a top hat, steer clear, but if you are a practical and economical working person, this beer is a great return on investment.","Isrealite","Dec 17, 2013"

Aroma is sourdough biscuit malt and little else, maybe a slight whiff of green grass and sulphur. Taste is similar to the aroma, with the barest hint of hop bitterness. Mostly sour uncooked dough and another thin sour flavor that calls to mind ultradiluted lemon juice. Cornflake sweetness. Maybe a hint of vinous fruit. Notable DMS. Very watery and thin, leaves mild bitterness on the palate and ends dry, with playdough and plaster notes lingering. Was expecting more skunk given the green bottle but actually wasn't too bad in this regard.

The mystery of the ""33"" on the label may refer to the fact that the beer is brewed at 33 degrees and is by far best served at 33 degrees. Or it may mean something much more mysterious. Despite the fact that it is now brewed in St. Louis and is owned by a Belgian global giant, it is still an interesting niche beer. I just purchased an 18 pack of 16 oz. cans for $11.99 in Seattle. That makes Rolling Rock a great warm weather bargain beer. Served ice cold in my stainless steel insulated mug, it is truly refreshing on a warm day. There has to be some appreciation of beers that are affordable for the masses and are clean and refreshing without the macro-brew name. I like PBR and Rolling Rock for this reason. I am rating it based on it's competition and price and not how it compares with Fremont Brewing's Summer Ale (freaking awesome). There ought to be another category for value.

It's all light toasted grain and corn; there is a dextrinous sweetness that would be a flaw in flavor if its wasn't part of Rolling Rocks signature taste.The carbonation is lighter and the mouthfeel slightly thicker than you would expect, the problem is that none of this adds up to anything very interesting.

This bubbles away to just a thin sheet of white that sits atop the brew. Carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of the globe at a steady pace. A very adjunct smell of white rice and sweet creamed corn dominates the aroma. Some hay-like dry grassiness may represent hops, or maybe actual hay in the mash. As liquid first touches the tongue, it seems a bit sweeter than most macro-brewed lagers. A refreshing, almost Sprite-like citrus flavor puckers the cheeks while the high carbonation and subtle, dry fruitiness make this a much more deserving candidate than Coors (or is it Miller?) for the title ""The Champagne of Beers."" There's really more adjunct grains than malt in here. Maybe just a little breadiness is all I can detect. Light body and lots of fizz make for a difficult mouth experience when cold, yet I don't think this would be palatable if it weren't cold.","sam_bliss","Jan 25, 2013"

Decent enough, true to it's style. Flavor is sweet, mostly maize adjuncts with a bit of malt. Absolutely no hop presence. Again, much like it's peers, though less offensive than some. Mouthfeel is light bodied, with high carbonation. Very seltzer-water in feel.

The effervescence of this brew is interesting, pale golden in color with an excellent blend of light herbal qualities. This is a great session beer that goes well with barbeques; and it is light on the stomach. In addition, this beer reminds you of an alcohol based 'Perrier', minus the bite of the CO2 - goes down smooth but allows for belching after each bottle consumed. You actually don't realize the alcohol content, as it is brilliantly soft on the palate, although it is on the sweeter side for the ABV of this brand. A definite worthy try.","knowledge","May 26, 2012"

That being said however, it lacks the inspiration and taste necessary to separate it from the pack. Drinkability is relatively high, but the carbonation inhibits the enjoyment of this relatively simple, yet consistent flavor. For a discount beer, Rolling rock certainly surpasses the competition, but falls drastically short of higher quality beer. Simply put, if you need something to drink, don't have that much money, but still value your tastebuds, rolling rock extra pale is the way to go. It leaves something to be desired, but not nearly as much as other contemporary discount brews.","svenandbrews","Apr 28, 2012"

The taste is similar, sour and corn dominant that gets worse as you drink it down. Mouthfeel is watery but you can pour it down if desired. Overall RR now seems to compete with the low end of the spectrum ala beast, natty, etc. Wouldnt want to test the hangover factor on this one. 20 years ago RR had a more hoppy, malty flavor.","adjunctjonez","Apr 04, 2012"

The appearance is quite clear, and no color, high carbonation. The head is quick to dissipate and is very thin. The aroma of the beer is sweet somewhat but also dry. The taste is where it bothers me. The beer is called extra pale but does not taste like a pale. Correct me if I am wrong but aren't pales supposed to be a bit bitter? The taste is sweet and is very similar to the aromatic qualities of the beer. The taste does go very well with ""sweet"" meats like BBQ or grilled pork.

Sure you get the occasional obese pre-teen exhibiting his rebellious nature coming down backwards. It was a mild hell, with mild rewards, but long term sustainability. Sure you get 100 patrons in a day urinating in the fetid pools, adolescents having tawdry affairs in the bushes, and a thousand forgettable days, however, some days the employees would look left to right and realize how good they had it. “STOP NO RUNNING, ALSO STOP URINIATING WHILE RUNNING, THANK YOU FOR NOT RUNNING NOW STOP URINATING!” Just another solid Sunday in July.","SubpoenaDeuces","May 31, 2011"

Looks like I might get decent lacing, but overall nothing special on the look here, looks like a normal adjunct lager with possibly some ok lacing. Smell is sour adjunct malt, but there is also sweet malt smell in there somewhere, which is good considering this is made by bud. No real hops to speak of on the smell, that sweet malt smell is the only real good thing, and that's a real stretch because almost all adjunct lagers have the sweet smell, it's only the real bad ones that only have the sour smell. The taste is pretty disappointing though, no real sweet malt on the taste, only sour adjunct flavor on the taste, and the rest of the taste is just water. There is no skunky flavor or smell, and that is good, because it's in a green bottle. The taste overall though just isn't good, it's honestly tastes like soap a little bit. It finishes really dry and like I said it tastes a lot like soap. This beer is disappointing because I recall like Rolling Rock at least a little more than this. I'll give it a 1.5 instead of a 1 because I'm a long time fan, and because it did end up giving me pretty solid lacing (even though that has nothing to do with flavor). I mean the tastes isn't awful, it isn't much worse than most adjunct lagers, but that soapy taste really bothers me, it's really subtle, but still. The mouthfeel is bad, but that's to be expected with an adjunct lager. The drinkability is ok, but that soapy taste for sure brings it down. Overall on this beer, I dunno, in terms of adjunct lagers it's ok.

With my now wiser tastes in beer, Rolling Rock does seem well off from the truly quality brews available in today's marketplace, but I still hold a fondness for the taste of this unique offering. It is a clear light gold color with lively carbonation notable and a fair sudsy white head. There is some modest lacing. It smells like liquid cereal/grain. Not terribly complex. The flavor is uniquely suggestive of corn, crisp and tastefully sweet and somewhat dry. It leaves a mild bitterness in the back of the mouth. It is well carbonated and is generally quite refreshing. A light lager but still carrying a solid flavor that accents this odd corn flavor as I like to describe it. I think this is what typically turns the average drinker away. I know few admirers of Rolling Rock yet Busch bought it for some good reason (maybe the light beer?). I remain a minor fan although not sure I can entirely defend that position.

It maintains its beautiful clear golden appearance, and its smell is still quite clean and refreshing, but its taste suffers. The New Jersey water that AB uses has a most noticeable effect on the taste. There was truly something to the water that Latrobe Brewing Co. used from the Allegheny mountains. All water is different; rock strata, soils, etc. have a lot to do with its ph and chemical composition. ABs NJ water, coupled with something in the formula that appears to make the new RR have more of a rice aftertaste has altered the taste of a once proud beer. It still cleanses the mouth with each swallow, and is very drinkable on a hot day. But still, AB . . . move the operations back to good old Latrobe, PA.

I have been told by Northern Spring Breakers that this is nothing special-at all- up North. In 1990s southern college towns, though, this was the go-to-beer for the pizza parlor's philosopher. Find a '90s movie with an Anti-Hero, you will see RR. (I'm talkin' to you, Ethan Hawke.) Now that I am older, I find it at Florida gas stations. At $11+/12pack($6+/6pack) and rising, however, this ultra pale is becoming too expensive for what it is. The mystique has disappeared for all but the biggest fans, and now it is JUST hard enough to find at bars to be annoying. I feel like A-B may keep it around, but it may go the way of RC Cola--- highly-priced on the special shelf for sentimental reasons, not for quality.

It's real close to Bud in color, even MGD leans a little more towards tan. Head is pretty foamy. It can get pretty tall, but never lasts long. Smell has some sweet, some sour, and a little bit of adjunct. I think the taste is pretty decent. I'm noticing a lot of people complain of skunkieness in this beer. I suspect this is probably due to the green bottle and maybe a tendency of this beer to not travel well. I can't remember ever having a skunky Rolling Rock myself and I can't live much more than a day away from the brewery. Plus I've been misled about the quality of a beer before because it tends to skunk (Heinekin). Anyway the taste is kind of sweet with a little sour background, and a slightly bitter finish. Malt is hard to detect, the adjunt (they say they use corn AND rice on the website) is there it is the least offensive beer I know to contain both of those adjuncts. Ironically, the two most similar beers I've had taste-wise are Heinekin and Becks. Stranger still, I think Rolling Rock tastes better than either of them even though its obviously made with ingredients inferior to theirs (Especially to Beck's). Mouthfeel is light and bubbly. This has to be one of the most heavily carbonated beers I've had. Drinkability is good but not great. It definately slides down easy, it is light and thirst quenching. I can't give it a great drinkability rating though because it is brewed with adjuncts and you can taste them. Though I said they aren't offensive, and they aren't at first, adjunct aftertaste always gets worse the more beer you have. So drinkability isn't ideal. Anyway this is my first choice for a cheap American macro, and I'd offer it as an alternative to Heineken or Becks besides except most people would probably look at me like I'm nuts for suggesting the latter.","casualbeerman","Dec 31, 2005"

2.13,-17.4,2.5,2,2,2,2.5,"Lightest color of the bunch. Pale yellow and fizzy. Smells like good quality pond water: seaweed, frogs...for a minute I wonder if this is Bud (that is before I tasted the actual Bud). Crude, bare malt flavors and the slightest hop bitterness on the finish. The flavors are actually well integrated but nearly neutral. No thrust to this beer. Inocuous. Flat. No character.","putnam","Oct 08, 2002"
4.1,58.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"As a Canadian eh, this is my beer of choice when travelling within the US of A. The taste is crisp with a light sweetness. and minimal after taste. The fact that it is a light offering enables the consumer (me) to quaff more than 1.....often!","Shiloh","Oct 02, 2002"
3.22,24.8,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"A good utility beer. All around purpose. Light look and aroma; corn, pale appearance. A crisp taste. Popular college beer, and rightly so since it is affordable. Refreshing and crisp, pours with a nice head. I still like this beer. I don't go out of my way for it, but I don't snub it either.","Mick","Sep 27, 2002"
2.16,-16.3,3,2,2,2,2.5,"After all of that you would think... this Beer is undrinkable, but Rolling Rock Extra Pale has a following, some people out there like things like this, and I just dont know why.","BeerBob","Sep 04, 2002"
1.65,-36,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,2,"Surprisingly better than i thought, less pissy than i exoected (thats not to say it isn't pissy), very light and thin flavour, but quite drinkable, even though its as boring as watching lawn bowls.","rastaman","Aug 18, 2002"
2.75,6.6,3,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Very nice appearance at first. Bright, clear, light golden color with a 1/4"" foamy white head. Unfortunately, the head fades very quickly - even before I took a taste. Very fine bubbles enhance the appearance. The aroma is perfumy, sweet malt with no hops to be found. A light body and soft carbonation give a thin mouthfeel. Still, there's a little zesty touch on the tongue which helps to make up a little bit for the lack of hops. The flavor is very lightly malty with just a touch of creamed corn. Based on memory, this beer has been cleaned up quite a bit - no doubt under the influence of Labatt (which in turn is owned by Interbrew, Belgium). The finish is slightly sweet but not cloying. Although this beer is incredibly one-sided, there are no rough edges to fault it and it's actually nicely refreshing.","NeroFiddled","Aug 07, 2002"
2.76,7,3,2,3,3,3,"I have to say I have never liked Rolling rock in the bottle because it was always skunky, green bottles and beer don't mix. In the can it is alittle better. The skunky spinach odor is not there and the over powering tannins are at a minimum. This is a good cheap beer especially in the summer.","xXTequila","Jul 18, 2002"
1.98,-23.3,2,1.5,2,3,2,"I had not had this one for a few years. I was surprised that it actually tasted OK despite being an American Std and in a green bottle. Not much in the way of appearance or flavor but it went down easy and was refreshing.","Dogbrick","Jul 18, 2002"
2.11,-18.2,3,2,2,2.5,2,"Not a great beer, but butter than I thought it would be.  A clear pale golden lager, pours with a medium sized white head.  Very well carbonated.  Smells faintly grassy, surprisingly minimal skunkiness.  Maybe I should have left it in the windowsill for a few days? ;) Malty sweet but not much other taste.  Finishes slightly sour.  Light body.","htomsirveaux","Jul 15, 2002"
3.21,24.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Translucent pale yellow hue, sporadic animation, modest white head, decent retention, unorganized flecks of lace. The nose is uninspiring; very slight pollution of adjuncts (corn/grits?) adds a note of sweetness, grain, and husk. Light maltiness hops are not noticeable. Fairly clean palate, very distant sweetness, more grainy than anything, slight maltiness, faint hoppiness perfect carbonation to maximize quenchability. Easy to drink, based on a simplistic flavor profile clean finish, minimal aftertaste (light sweet-graininess). Medium-light body. Admirable mouthfeel. On par with the best cheap macro lagers (PBR, High Life) if the price is right, Id drink it again on a hot summer day. Green bottle prices suck green bottles suck as well.","bditty187","Jul 12, 2002"

2.48,-3.9,3,2.5,2,3,3,"As advertised pours a very pale, nearly clean light yellow color. Big fizzy white head. Smell was somewhat grainy. Taste was at first crisp, and beerlike, some grain smells as well. As it warmed, the corn, grain, and metallic smells and tastes exploded. IMO, drink these extremely cold, and quickly. Not too much else here, ok in the summer heat, and easy to drink.","StevieW","Jul 07, 2002"
1.63,-36.8,2,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,"Okay, at Comfest, the cheap beer available is Rolling Rock.  I pours out a very pale yellow color with very little aroma of hops with some skunkiness.  How this comes about on tap is beyond me.  There was a white head that did not stick around and left no lace.  The flavor was bland and not much to it.  Some carbonation made it fizzy and it had some hops and malt and some grain flavor to it.  Really is a cheap summer beer, but much better stuff out there.","Wildman","Jul 01, 2002"
1.95,-24.4,2,2,2,1.5,2,"Pours a light golden...smell was of minnows or fish or something at first...but I found out it was the glass...poured in another glass the remaining amount from the bottle and the smell wasn't much better than the fish smell...a real sweet adjuncty smell....the taste is OK..I wouldn't pay more for this but if on special I'd take it....as for mouthfeel it leaves my mouth kind of puckered up on the finish...I just finished pretty much dissing Labatt Blue, and this is definitely a step down from that...I've had this on tap before and thought it was decent so maybe this is a bad bottle but it doesn't taste spoiled...then again it's a green bottle so it could be....this experience is not a good one.","ZAP","Jun 26, 2002"

2.42,-6.2,2,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"First look, and this beer might be mistaken for Pittsburgh city water, somewhat off color for a beer.  Slightly malty, but more bitter than sweet. Very fizzy seltzery.  Goes down well when cold, but the over simple taste gets old quick; you taste buds scream for something more exciting.  When this beer gets warm the taste of corn or rice adjuncts comes through and becomes distracting.  A mediocre beer that is now popular because of some of its unique qualities and a blitzy media campaign.","psugrad98","May 22, 2002"

3.43,32.9,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Not a bad beer. It's definitely got a very light flavor. There aren't any real citrus hints but has the same kind of feel and is pretty refreshing when cold like a light citrus soda with it's lively carbonation and slightest bite. This isn't a heavy, malty, dark ale. It's not supposed to be. For what it's supposed to be, it's not bad.","aracauna","Apr 02, 2002"
