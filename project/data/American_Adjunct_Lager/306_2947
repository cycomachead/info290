Ice cold from the cooler and drank with an open mind. This beer ""to me"" reminded me of a whiskey taste mixed with a glass of ice that had been melting for awhile.

This will forever be immortalized as long as there are frat parties in existence. It appeals to the younger, inexperienced and to the bargain hunters. You could easily buy a similar beer and not feel a thing. At least with this you are guaranteed some kind of result. While staying at this price point I would rather recommend an Old Milwaukee or PBR if flavor becomes a higher priority.","LiquidSanity","Feb 28, 2012"

Not much more booze than your typical malt lager but this is an iced version of Keystone. Appears in the most non descript form of a yellow fizzy lager, plop plop fizzes rise from the bottom of the glass. White head dwindles pretty rapidly even while your pouring the beer the head races to meet the body, wtf I guess a true college beer drinker knows how to pour a beer without any or much head. More beer right? Aroma has a pure cooked corn/cereal grain aroma...faint muddled herbal quality not quite hops. Flavor wise a pretty srong cereal grain infusion of rice/malts/corn with a bitter unpleasant offbeat singing through the melody of unconditioned and off put flavors. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a rough heavy carbonation filling my senses this is tough sipping beer from a tallboy can. Overall I drank most of this not sure the portion that I didn't get down but I've seen much worse but this isn't aiming it's sights very high.

I thought it smelled strongly of green apples. The mouthfeel is that of high carbonation. It tastes like bread, essentially. I was surprised to find that it tasted more of bread than corn or of alcohol. The aftertaste is almost the same as the aftertaste after you've eaten a slice of an 89 cent loaf of ""wheat"" bread. So, for the price, it's ALMOST worth it. One problem: it gives me terrible heartburn before I've ever finished the can! Never experienced that with any other beer before. I've had problems with heartburn before, but never before finishing a single can of beer. Not sure what's in this stuff that causes such a problem, but for me that makes it not worth paying ANY money for. A good alternative: Big Flats 1901.

However on the pour there was almost no head except for some oily looking foam clinging in sparse areas of the surface of my beer and the color of the pour was very similar to say...well lets just say this beer must have been dehydrated and taking its B vitamins cause it looked and smelled like it. The mouthfeel is initially no different than any other macro brew, which is to say there isn't much of anything going on here. On the finish it seems to mutate into something altogether different, leaving a funky coating on the palate and a bit of a sharp bite in the back of the throat (that could be the vodka they're pouring in this stuff to up the alcohol content...not seriously by the way...but it feels like it). The taste is only what can be described as unbearable, although I did bear it that night and succeeded in getting pretty hammered off the stuff (is its one redeeming quality) which leads me to the point I am today. One of my college buddies bought a case of it and after opening the can I knew I wouldn't be able to pull another night off with this one.

Every so often college kids will also buy it to be ironic and then they'll pop their collars and high five and then drink a case of this swill and suck each other's dicks.

The good news is that if you chug enough of it it begins to taste like water and that daytime hooker begins to look less like a post-op tranny.

Taste, as with all ice beers is of lesser importance than low price and high alcohol content (12 pack = $5.99 with a 5.9% AV). You're getting a cheap buzz here and that's what ice beers are for. However, some do taste better than others. Keystone Ice is much better than say Natural Ice and Milwaukee's Best Ice (arguably the the worst ""beer"" I've had). Keystone Ice has no offensive smell, it actually is smooth, taste is corn, alcohol and the can, with an aftertaste that is popularly described as banana-like. I won't get into color, head or any appearance qualities because in my opinion ice beers should be left in the can or bottle they come in. Pouring them into a glass for further examination not only further reveals their cheapness, it actually can make them taste worse. It seems a little pointless to go into detail about ice beers. I doubt most of those that consume them regularly put much thought into it. Still, if you're going to buy one, you might as well get one you don't have to choke down.","keeponwithbeer","Sep 01, 2008"

The first time I ever tried it I can honestly say I thought it could possibly be contaminated or something like that and considered contacting the Brewery.
