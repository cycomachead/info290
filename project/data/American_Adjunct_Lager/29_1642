If you can look past the price and not consider this to be trashy or whatever, this stuff is good. I will compare this on scale with other ice beers. Busch is maybe about the same as this, but this is stronger slightly. Busch Ice is some good stuff when you are wanting to crack open a brewski for cheap and relax. Its a nice golden color. One thing. Don't let this get remotely warm.  Best way i can describe it is it tastes like beer. Bought an 18 pack of this on my quest to find the best ice beer. So far ive had Busch Natty and then this. Also Keystone. Keystone is gross. This is a Good solid American Lager. Its not offputting or meant for craft drinkers. Its just a cheap beer. Isn't bad. I find it refreshing after a long day of work. I have a beer periodically because its good for you.","Alestorm4069","Dec 08, 2014"

2.92,59.6,3.5,2.75,3,3,2.75,"While I was picking up a can of Bud Light Lime Appale-Ahhhh-Rita (was that the right number of H's there?), I spied a can of Bud Ice and remembered I'd never tried it.  Time to change that.  This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam.  The nose barely exists, though I think some processed cereal grains and hard water come through.  Maybe.  I don't know, though.  The taste resembles your usual Bud Light, with some processed corn, hard water, and mild biscuit-like sweetness, though a hint of extra booze is in there (it's not terribly perceptible, but it's there on occasion).  The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat watery feel.  Overall, this is your basic booze-boosted adjunct lager, not really bad, per se, but decidedly boring and tedious.","TMoney2591","Oct 05, 2014"

Well as I said I am just beginning my beer adventure and a local beer and wine store carries a free book that lists all of their available beer and wines. Not knowing a damn thing about either I simply decided to try the first one in the book which was a listing of their domestic beer. First on the list was this and luckily I actually like it. Its light and to my taste buds has a slightly sweet taste to it. After reading the reviews I see alot of people arent a fan. But I find this to be a good starter beer especially for the ladies. Its light in color, taste and the impact on your wallet. I got a 12 pk of the bottles for about 8 dollars. I think this would be great hanging out at the beach or pool or outside on a hot day. No bitter after taste that I hate from the stronger flavored craft beer. I'm a fan. I would definitely repurchase","workhardplayharder","Jan 19, 2014"

Very light and carbonated, with an almost malt-liquor scent. Taste is in line with most all AAL's, but slightly more heavy on the malts. Pours a really orangish-golden color, no head retains and no lacing. Not a good beer, but if you want something with Ice on it, this is a safe bet.","boilermakerbrew","Jul 03, 2012"

This was actually decent and hit the spot this afternoon. This is one of the better Bud offerings IMO. In a world of light, thin, no-flavor beers, this one stands above with a bit of flavor and body.

1.8,-1.6,2,2,1.5,2,2,"Its an ice beer.  Hasn't the ice beer fad gone away yet?  Pours out to a light golden color, with a fast disappating head.  Taste is very light, with heavy carbination.  Very little hop taste.  I can see these being chugged easily (due to lack of taste/body).  Maybe good out of a funner/beer bong, but not something to sit and enjoy.","proc","Jul 15, 2002"
1.68,-8.2,2,1.5,1.5,2,2,"Pale yellow, clear, almost light off color water.  Extremely carbonated with quickly vanishing head.  Smell is almost non existent at cold temperatures. Once warming the beer smells slightly of hopps and grain.  Taste is similar to regular Budweiser with a slightly more bitter hoppiness pared with a more pronounced alcohol flavor.  Not much better if at all than the rest of their lineup.","psugrad98","Jun 05, 2002"

1,-45.4,1,1,1,1,1,"Ice Beer, is it really special?  Many people seem to think so. What is Ice beer? It is malt liquor dropped to freezing then the ice is removed so what remains is a much stronger malt liquor. Ice beer is for people who don't really like beer but they want to get drunk faster I suppose. Here is another fine example of a crappy beer from the ""King of Crap Beer""  Anheuser-Busch, Inc.","ThreePistols","Oct 24, 2001"
