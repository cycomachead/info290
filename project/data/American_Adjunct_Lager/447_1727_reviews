review_text
"Brew pours a straw-yellow in color with a thin white head. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped that stuck to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of some yeast and grassy hops. Pretty much is said for the taste also. Goes down easy and a semi-dry finish. No harsh or bitter aftertaste. Lighter-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, I actually liked this one as I never had it before. Refreshing and would be even better for the warmer months."

"I was raised on the Southside of Chicago. In high school, in the 80s, this was THE brew. I didn't know any better and I loved it. Nothing tastier on a hot summer day than one of those ice cold little round bottles. Dare to dream. Now I'm old and can afford better beer and I buy better beer. Every now and then I have an Old Style and I'm young and stupid again."
"Good old Old Style.  Brings back memories.  Cubs Fan as well.8"
"2.50 pints at the bar and washes down the burger good. It serves a purpose."

"Cheap nasty mass produced tasteless American swill"
"Beer in a bottle when you can only afford cans."
"Just awful.  For me, it was easily the very worst of the ultra low-end beers."
"Smells like overly sweet corn and has a very sugary and unbalanced aftertaste.  The mouthfeel us the best thing it has."
"The look of the beer is pretty good for the style(no pun intended). The main reason I enjoy this beer is the location and circumstance under which I am drinking it. It is almost always in Chicago at Wrigley Field. How could you not enjoy almost any beer on a nice day at Wrigley? So, yeah, the beer isn't that great, but the beer and the experience together take it up a couple notches!"
"July at wrigley field. That's what this beer is! For real though, one of my favorite aal out there."

"nothing special , cheap beer , but better that bud light and coors light by far ...  tight budget  get old style!!"

"Overall : I didn't think pouring this one would help much, but it actually did. I can't speak for others but Old Style is one of my top favorite lagers bar none. It's miles above PBR, and rivals my current favorite Hauenstein. These beers are both cheap (Hauenstein and Old Style), and I can't imagine finding a better lager for the price. Do yourself a favor and try this beer - if you can find it."

"Given the price and the ubiquity of this brand, you can't expect the style and complexity of craft beers. Yet Old Style is a healthier, heavier-body brew, not too watery, not too grainy, and not too reliant on one particular bitter or unappetizing flavor. It has a light drinkability to it and favorable qualities that make it a solid beer all around."
""
"Overall: 3/5. I tried this because it was one of my grandpa's favorites and I grew up new Chicago so I figured I had to by mere association. Glad I tried it, but I probably won't feel the need to ever have one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : Old style is good lager with more taste then 85 percent of lagers on market. Old style beats out High life, modello , Bud ice, Busch , Natural Ice and all of light beers on the market."

"The color was the standard pale straw, the smell was pretty standard as well, it didn't smell bad, it just smelled like your granddad's beer he kept out in the garage. Grainy, malty, ah, brings me back on so many levels. The taste was great, I like this style of beer and I wish that other companies could get this down. It tastes like a beer should taste like. This is beer, not an ale. I know we can discuss semantics all you want, but this is what reminds me of what I was introduced to as ""beer""."

"Yep the best beer to me is Old Style beer. I keep it in the family, my grandfather on my moms side use to drink Old Style when I was growing up.My uncles to.Then as I got old enough to drink beer I've always new I would be drinking this great beer. It's funny when I started hanging out with new friends when I moved to my grandparents neighborhood, those friends were drinking Old Style to.Reach for The best beer old style beer, I was mainly brewed in La Cross, Wisconsin and then Semi loads to Chicago and the Suburbs outside Chicago. Old Style every where back then! And now I live in Southern Illinois right outside of St . Louis, Missouri and it's very hard to find it anywhere. And then when you do find it, your paying an arm an a leg,, crazyly high price! Is there any where in the St. Louis area I can by it cheapter then Dierbergs grocery store in Edwardsville, Illinois? So damn high there for a 12 pack of bottle's. They higherd the 12 pack price 3x this year??"

"im a big fan of craft beers, wheat beers are my favorite and like to grab an IPA on occasion. when im on a tight budget i turn to old style or rolling rock, only macro beers i remotely respect. lot of my friends like coors lite bud lite busch lite, idk how they enjoy them. anyway old style is smooth crisp far from unpleasant and the only beer i can drink out a can, it smell and appearence are nothing special but it got a smooth mouthfeel n nice taste, ur ever low on finances check it out, not bad and it gives u your money's worth."

"O - The one good thing about the rust belt breweries is that they actually have a little flavor. This one didn't taste as good as the last one, but my last one was at Wrigley watching the Reds shutout the Cubs. That one tasted sweet!"
""
""
""
""

"And Old Style is just that: one or two is ok, but beware of three and beyond."

"This actually doesn't suck. The problem I have with this is that it may be *too* sweet for my tastes... I could see me not wanting much more after a few of these."

"Pours to a thin white head that lasts and straw yellow color. Aroma is stale popcorn. Flavor is pale malt, corn, muddy water and a touch of grassy hops. Mouthfeel light, salty and fizzy. Overall, it is easy to quaff but not too special. Give me me a 312."

"Pabst Old Style ---2.5/5"
""
""
""
""
"O- One of the best macro brews on the market. Another good one by Pabst. There is a reason this is a classic ""ballpark"" beer. I guess they recently implemented a krausening process the last few years that helps the flavor. I can't speak for that since i did not try this beer prior to that process, but others seem to think it has made a big difference. Very enjoyable beer on a warm day. If you like adjunct american lagers (not my style but they serve their purpose), don't waste your time with bud, miller, or coors. Go with this bad boy."

"Very drinkable and it's my favorite. Tastes great and there's a lot of history behind this beer. I am definately bias when it comes to where the beer is made, because all the best beer is made in Wisconsin. ""Think local. Drink local."""

"I picked up a 6 pack of 12 oz. cans for $3.59 the first drink I knew this was something different. I am a Budweiser drinker and this instantly reminded me of Bud. it has great mouthfeel and no nasty aftertaste like the old cheap beer did. the cost has increased (18 pack was $7.99 in 08 and now it's $10) but still a good price for a good beer!"

"Drinkability: Instead of being cursed by a goat, I think the Cubs are cursed by Old Style. I am pretty disappointed. It does the job, but it lacks a lot of the bite and flavor I associate with classic beers like this."
""
""
"Overall - About what I was expecting for the $1.70 I got for this, and it's fairly non-offensive for this style of beer."

"There's a lot of malty sweetness on this one. And even though it reminds me of Harar (from Ethiopia), I still feel like it's a bit too much when it comes down to it, but it's a just barely kinda thing. But still it's smooth, overall. Very little grain tones hit you, and when they do, it's much later on. For an adjunct, this isn't all that bad really. I mean, I doubt I'm going to run out and make it my standard, but for the experience and price, it's not too shabby."
""
""
""
"Hey, it's not remarkable - but it's easy drinking and good enough. Better than bmc for sure."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good AAL. A lot more flavor than BMC and a nice, cheap option."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thought I would give this a try bscause I like PBR, big mistake this stuff is undrinkable I couldnt even make one bottle. Those saying this beer has no off flavors, I am not sure what they didnt taste bc this beer tastes like stale moldy corn and urine it is one of the most unpleasant beers I have ever tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pabst makes some of the most tolerable AALs, including Old Style. The grain taste is just enough to make it worth it when it's very cold. Not that bad."

"This is the Cubs' beer, so as a Reds fan, it's everything I despise. That being said, if you're looking for an adjunct lager to drink, it's not bad. Appearance is typical AAL....light golden, little head retention, and little lacing. Smell is all rice and other adjunct grains. Taste is pretty smooth, light, and all adjuncts. Nothing terrific here as far as cheap, shitty beers go, but better than Coors or Miller."
""
""
""
"One of the better macros out there."
""
""
""
"A very good summer beer. I would imagine most persons who are consulting beeradvocate might choose to go with a more expensive or refined beer, but for an American Style lager, it's pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is creamy and sweetly malty, with a definite lack of hops presence. Really, a typical adjunct, though with much more flavor and character than it's big brother, PBR, or the bigger boys. A step above the aforementioned, but not outstanding."
"What can I say, it beats the hell out of Budweiser, Coors and all the other ""frat"" beers. Definitely my session beer of choice. I love the richness the krausening process adds to this light, flavorful beer. Hardley bitter and far from malty, kinda like chicken soup when your sick."
"O- One of the better Adjunct Lagers as far as flavor is concerned. Worth a try."
"O - Overall this one has little taste and smell, probably meant for people who don't like beer to much. Very thin, watery, and has no taste. Water beer, very basic and easy drinking."
"Notes: This is not light your socks on fire beer, but it is an immensely drinkable American Adjunct Lager that has no off taste or impurities. It is sooo easy to drink. If you are in a mood where you don't need to be challenged or surprised this beer drop kicks Bud, Miller & Coors and is a cheap, quaffable Lager that anyone could drink. It is a step better than PBR and two steps ahead of Schlitz. It is too bad that it is not distributed in the Northeast as I would keep a case of it on hand at all times."
"O: If reviewing this against similar beers from the macros, it is good. In the grand spectrum of beer this would be on the low-low end. That being said, it is consistent and traditional beer."
"Thanks to woodychandler for yet another canned beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains and corn. Taste is rather mild, some grains and malts are present. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
"This is one of my favorite beers. Wish we could get bottles in Ohio. But next trip Chicago I am stocking up."
"12 oz bottle, straight out of the bottle, handed to me by a friend at The Continental at about 4:30 in the morning. Don't pour this in a glass, it's a waste of water to wash the glass after...this beer doesn't deserve it. Tons of corn flavor, some hop flavor. Better than Budweiser and Miller and Coors (the worst of tasting of all beers). Went down pretty easy anyway and quenched my thirst."
"OK, BUT NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"It is very crisp and refreshing. You could easily drink these all day long."
"this beer is anything but intricate, aromatic, and complex. Friends, this is simply beer. It pours from a cheap, 20 oz. can into my beer mug. It is highly carbonated and therefore boasts an enormous head, if you want it to. But this head fades within a minute or so, leaves almost no lacing at all (since there isn't much in this beer). It barely embodies the yellow hue of a light lager, and is crystal clear. It smells faintly (and by faintly I mean, ""I'm so used to smelling beers that actually have an aroma, that I can't be sure my brain didn't just fabricate the faint malt aroma all on its own) of malt."
"Smell is a bit skunky and grain-sweet. Taste is clean and dry with a non-offensive aftertaste. There is a head to this beer that is somewhat sticky. Far from awful, but not awfly good."
"A Chicago Cub favorite! I have this everytime I visit Chicago especially at a Cubbie game. This brew pours a large head of mostly diminishing white mediumly sized bubbles and a carbonated transparent yellow rice beer colored body. It had a very very mild malt aroma and a smooth almost unnoticable malty and hop flavor with no bite. Medium bodied and good carbonation."
"D: Too metallic on the nose and really, really sweet. But the flavor isn't as offensive as it could have been. Score one in the moral victory column."
"If I hear one more commercial about how kraeusening makes things better, I'm gonna freak out. Deep breath. This bit pours a clear jaundice topped by a quickly-dying half-finger of white foam. The nose comprises light flowers, grass, fake coriander, and what may or may not be wheat. (I honestly can't tell...) The taste holds notes of mild wheat and hops, lemon zest, and a lot of rather hard water. The body is very light, with a fizzy carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a fizzy weakling of a beer, but very easy to down quickly (if one so desires)."
"Beer is dated NOV 10, pulled from the back of the fridge at the gas station. Pours out a crystal-clear golden macro lager yellow - you know, the classic piss beer color. Actually has some head retention on the top, very effervescent with lots of active carbonation. Smells clean with some herbal hop notes in the background, with some sweet adjuncts thrown in there. Smell is so clean it reminds me of fabric softener, and I swear I am get a floral whiffs. That smell has to be coming from somewhere else. Anyway, smells interesting for such a beer. Taste is somewhat clear and crisp too, and dry. Picking up an unpleasant corn syrupyness in there, but that is no surprise. This is the first beer I ever tasted, my Dad would very occasionally drink one of these, IF he ever drank beer, and I just remember how awful beer tasted, and it kinda still does, all do respect, this one is better smelling believe it or not than tasting, and it is smooth and not as carbonated as it appears which begs the next question. I was tasting this beer a few years ago before the kreusening, and I honestly cannot taste much difference. I always have wondered, why in the world would anyone kreusen an adjunct lager? Why polish a turd?"
"Clean and crisp, finishing smooth with just a little bite.Aromas of roasted corn. This is a beer that would make me feel snobbish for putting it in a glass, but if you do the color is a nice bright light golden amber. Perfect for pounding down hot wings, pizza, a hot dog, or a burger. There's a reason they sell this at Chicago Cubs games. Great in the summer, but I wouldn't imagine craving one in December."
"Tasty and clean for a Retro Lager. Great for when you are not looking for something exotic or extreme and just want a plain beer. A perfect beer for that greasy slice of pepperoni pizza or that ballpark dog slathered with chili."
"M/D: There is some body here but the carbonation is nasty. Too big of bubbles or something. The beer kind of makes you feel full like your stomach is going to explode."
"D - The only excuse to ever consume Old Style is when you must, with no exceptions, have a beer at a Chicago Cubs game. Sure, But is available but who would chose that?"
"Drinkability: It's a nice beer to drink at the ballpark with hotdogs."
"On the other hand for the craft beer drinker, chances are if you are the type who has no problem purchasing one, $30 bottle of beer that came from an obscure craft brewer or Belgium, Old Style is not likely a regular part of your stock. Though the $30 Belgian and Old Style are both beer, it's clearly not apples to apples in terms of ingredients, brewing process, or taste. It's not even worth comparing the two."
"d-easy drinkin' adjunct. nothing special besides the 50th Anniversary of Oktoberfest in La Crosse can. For cheap beer, isn't the can novelty half the battle anyways?"
"Drinkability - I was impressed with this effort from Pabst. It has a nice flavor, nothing offensive, but the feel in the mouth is what makes this a stand out."
"RJT"
"Pours a pretty unimpressive straw goldenrod pale color. Fairly fizzy with a loose head that is quick to dissipate. Smell is a little bit tinny and artificially malty. There is a hint of cheap hops and residual yeasty bready toasty notes. Mouthfeel is thin and metallic, drinkability isn't great."
"16oz can into an awesome plastic cup at the Cubs game...The beer pours a super clear medium straw. Good light white head with decent retention...The aroma is light with a hint of skunk...The taste gets rid of the skunk mostly replaced by malt. A surprising malty start for a marco, sweet caramel, but a light skunk finish. Easy drink mbetter than most macros."
"Overall: I drank this at the Blackhawks Stanley Cup rally in Chicago. Made me feel at home. A very solid beer and easy to get in the area. Ditch BMC and try this."
"D: Definitely a beer that goes down easily. It's a good sports in the sun beer, but not one I'd seek out outside of the Friendly Confines."
"This beer was different, that much is certain. It had a much, I guess ""stronger"" is the word i want... ""stronger"" taste than what you usually find in an American Adjunct Lager. It has a bold taste, that is very drinkable. A moderate amount of active carbonation which gives it a slight ""crispness"" when you drink it. It has a bitter hoppy finish, much like a traditional German Lager would. A good beer for the money, and a very nice American Adjunct Lager. If you are expecting a watered down taste like with most A.A.L.'s, then you are in for a pleasant surprise."
"Merely average for the style, but it's a hell of a lot better than any of the Big 3."
"Beer has a pale golden color with a decent head and high carbonation. The aroma seems to be slightly grainy. It has a light refreshing taste and was surprisingly smooth. I consider this beer drinkable, especially at group outings that calls for mass quantities of ice cold beer. I would select this beer hands down over a light beer."
"Taste is quite acceptable, and it was cheap, so I can't argue with that."
"Notes: Good for a adjunct/light lager. Decent amount of hops for the style. Not a great beer, but good amount of hops for the style."
"A clear pale golden color pour with a two finger fizzy white head , high carbonation . Aroma is slightly grainy with some corn notes , hops barely detectable. Flavor is lightly sweet for the style , much like Miller , corn and faint hops, light body with a crisp clean mouthfeel , nothing offensive and a pretty smooth drinker , sessionable with a short corn lager finish . Drinkable and not too bad ."
"D - For the style it's really not that bad I could see pounding theses on a hot day during the summer"
"Pours a fair amount of foam that quickly fades away. Some grain and miscellaneous smells on the nose. Nothing much. Taste is even more lacking. Compared to other cheap beers of this style, Old Style does have some distinctive qualities to it, but not in a good way (cant quite put my finger on exactly what it is). Back in college I drank my fair share of ""cheap"" American ""macro"" beers, and many were much more drinkable than this. I would pick just about anything over this."
"D- These beers were made to be drank is mass consumption."
"I am a Cubs fan so i may be a little biased but does it get any better than this on a hot summer day at the ballpark or mowing the yard. Its cheap, it tastes pretty good especially ice-cold, it has great carbonation and you can drink it all day long. For what it is I don't think it can be beat in its market."
"The bottom line is this:It's a typical Big Corporate beer (brewed by the last of the American owned big brewers in the U.S.)."
"Nice 2009 commemorative Cubs bottle though."
"It began with a finger of bone-white head, but quickly fell to mere wisps. Color was a sunshine yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was somewhat sweetish with the standard cereal quality. Mouthfeel was effervescent and mildly sweet. Finish was moderately sweet, but tasty. I like this for its nostalgic quality. I would routinely drink it at Union Station in CHI when passing through and on a couple of trips, made a case a carry-on prior to 9/11. Yeah, it's Stone's ""fizzy yellow beer"" but of some of the American Adjunct Lagers that I have drank in a CAN, this was passable."
"Pale gold with a skimpy white head that fades quickly to a thin collar. Corn and steely grain in the nose and not much else. Tastes of grits and faint grain with just the slightest touch of hop extract to balance flavors. Light and effervescent. Finishes clean. A decent cheap beer that reminds me of PBR."
"Conclusion: Better than BMC for sure...but nothing special going on here"
"Toward the upper middle of the adjunct lager pack. Not something I would seek out unless on a tight budget and even then it would be a strech."
"This beer is my beer of choice when I don't have a lot of money. It has a medium golden color (not to light), poured a 1 cm. head. This beer is very clean in the mouth, with quite pronounced carbonation. This beer does not sit in your stomach like other beers can such as Budweiser, but it has a fuller taste that isn't as ""Tart"" as other beers. Overall this is a great beer to have especially on a hot day, it is by no means a great beer, but for the price and with the right occasion it can be a good beer."
"Taste: Not a lot of taste but compared to similar beers of this style it is better. There is no off taste to it and the flavor is slightly grainy, slightly yeasty"
"D= great. Super fine beer to have at the ball game. Not even trying to bash bud but this had more flavor and was still a great ballgame beer"
"Drinkability-Smooth easy drinking on this one. Lord willin I'll be drinking more of this."
"This was one of my loyal beers while in college 20+ years ago. It was not nearly as enjoyable once Stroh's bought and neglected it. Now Pabst has improved both PBR and Old Style. Life is good."
"Picked up a six pack of the ""new""/"old"" krausened Old Style. I had a sneak preview back at Cubs spring training in Arizona and thought it was better than the BMC served at the parks. A nice drinking lawnmower beer for the summer."
"Drinkability - Not a favorite of mine. Not much taste and no character."
"I could drink a case of Old Style in a sitting. I'm just sure of it. Few adjunct lagers are simply as clean and drinkable. I don't know what it used to taste like, but lets just assume that krausening is a good thing."
"slammable. easy to drink. would I want to again? yes, if I was in a cheap beer mood."
"D - This is an okay lager. I could see it being very good at a Cubs game."
"Taste: Fizzy water and adjuncts(corn). Tiny amount of hop bitterness in the finish. Nothing going on in that 24 ounce can that will make BA's salivate, it's just another cheap adjunct lager. Even among other adjunct lagers this is a subpar offering."
"I know it has been over 20 years since I have had an Old Style. It pours a light golden color with aggressive carbonation initially and a small quickly fading head. Aroma is light corn, citrus and malt. Flavor is sweetened corn, light acidic citrus and sourish malts. Overall it is a basic macro type but I still find it to be refreshing and decent tasting. A nice change from all of the big beers I have been drinking lately."
"Smells of even malts and hops with a small overtone of citrus. Tastes about the same, I thought it was very good for an adjunct, the best I've had. Very tolerable and well carbonated making it quite drinkable. A very good go-to beer."
"Poured to a two fingered head. Head was white in color. Beer was a light yellow. Head hung around for a little while. Had a little lacing but not much. Smelled like a American lager. Very light smelling, just of maybe some grain and a hint of alcohol. I thought the taste actually was good. Not a lot of flavor, I had the beer very cold. Maybe of some grain or corn. Felt ok in the mouth. Not to much carbonation. Would make a good lawnmower beer. Not heavy and not heavy on the wallet. Ill buy again on a hot summer day."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a perfectly clear straw-gold color. The head was white, thin and the retention and lacing were weak. The aroma was slightly better than the average macro-lager, dry grains and a low level mustiness. The flavors were the same with pale malt and dry graininess. Similar to Coors et. al but definitely better rounded. Crisp finish. The mouthfeel was a little watery, the carbonation medium/high and the body medium. Dry and drinkable for the style."
"It pours the typical golden body beneath a short head of short-lived bright white foam. Lacing is average at best. Generic beer nose with a hint of apple thrown in. Light-medium in body. Crisp with bristling bubbles. Bitterness that just bumps the malt. A smear of leafy hop flavor. Generic beer finish."
"I got this for Christmas as a gag gift. I'm drinking the 12 pack for New Years. Not too bad. Pretty much what I'd expect from Pabst, better than most macros."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing throughout. Smells of adjunct, yeast, and pale malt. Fits the style of an american adjunct lager. Smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes mostly of adjunct, then yeast, and slight pale malt. Not a real great beer but better than other american adjunct's I've had."
"NOTE: This beer is far better in bottles or on draft. Cans just don't bring the same flavor for some reason."
"What can you say about the Old Style? Poured from the can into a pint glass this has a thin straw like color with a minimal white head, no lacing. The smell is, well, like nothing. A little corn and light malt aroma. The taste is similar, although the moderately high carbonation leaves a nice fizzle in the mouth and the flavor, mostly bland, this beer is actually not to bad. Going camping for a weekend or doing some yard work, this is actually refreshing at a significantly lower price when mass consumption will be taking place. Not bad, but definitely not to impress!"
"I was very surprised with this beer. I did not excpet such a sweat beer. the appearance was good the smell was sweat and got me salavaiting. the taste was a very wheaty taste with sweetness all the way down. not to much of a mouth feel nice and crisp great drink ability. a great beer to have one or two of after work."
"Someone told me that they sell Old Style on draft at Cubs games and I had to try it. My local CVS had 30 pack cans for $12.99. I put them in the fridge for 2 days and was looking forward to having a few after work. Was actually pleasantly suprised. Good, clean and potent. There was a bit of aftertaste, probably because it sat on the shelf for a while. I don't know the date codes. A good one for the price."
"16 oz can. Easy to drink, tastes like little to nothing, and better than I expected. Interestingly carbonated, lightly hopped, clean and non offensive. One of the better pale lager mass marketed beers. While that doesn't make it good, it's not as ewww as others."
"mouthfeel is bitter, light, slightly astringent, very sessionable - reminds me heavily of PBR but tweaked, not really amazing but not surprising that its made by the same company"
"it puzzles me why this seems to be the least popular cheap beer in america (outside of chicago) with such a great taste. go to wrigley field its delicious on their taps. its 6.50 but what do you expect from the ball park. goes good with a brat for a little over ten bucks. not bad"
"A well done beer, the price is right and it's refreshing, there's no need to over analyze it's just a nice beer at the right price."
"I won't drink this unless it is free and I am desperate"
"I'm trying to review this beer for what it is, American fizzy yellow piss. That said for the uniniated(into the world of good beer) it is still held in contempt by some , I was out drinking with some buddies and I was flabbergasted how these MGD drinkers were shitting on this beer, I have a sentimental soft spot for this beer as it was and still is in spirit, a chicago beer. I was raised on this stuff and I can remember many a day when I came home from a hard day at work, thirsty and it did the job. I came to the bar with a nasty case of cotton mouth and the beer was like water to a man coming out of the desert. It reminded me of being at the ballpark, and I dipped my nose in that foamy head, fizzy yellow piss yes... but good for what it is."
"Mouthfeel is slick and oily. Harsh carbonation stings the mouth. This was good for only the novelty. Has not dethroned my favorite macro, Hamm's"
"Quick pour in a typical beer mug, straight from a can. Carbonation with a lot of foam which quickly disapears. Smell of carbonation little corn, barley malt, and a little alcohol, nice balance, nothing over powering in the smell department. Average taste nothing really special if you've had a pabst its pretty much like that, but drier. Great drinkability a lot smoother than other pabst products, easy drinkability. No backwash. Probably the best of the classic beers, good enjoyability."
"A very clean tasting macro. Easy drinking and refreshing. Not as hoppy as some of the retro beers that are making a comeback but it is very even. I use to drink a lot of this 20 years ago and I can see myself buying more and making this my macro standard. I just won't bother pouring it into a glass again."
"Mouthfeel, in nice and smooth for an adjuct lager, not overly dry (maybe it's supposed to be). this one (other than the adjucts), has more of a german lager feel to it, and isn't to bad when I walk into Jimmy's to get a beer or two. And they are two bucks a pint."
"All in all, this is a good american lager."
"Number 4 in the Retro Summer Session brews tour. Poured this 12oz can into my Miller Light/Harley Davidson Glass. For some reason it just seemed appropriate. It poured a very pale straw yellow with a mildly foamy, bleached head (the damn thing looked like a shirt that just met a liter of Clorox). This beer did leave mild lacing down the glass, which surprised me. The aroma was biscuity, there was a definite yeasty sent to it. The typical corn syrup aroma was there but is definitely toned down. The taste, all in all, is slightly bland even for a Macro lager. This so far is the best mouthfeel of a Macro Lager I've had. This beer finishes astoundingly dry with a big carbonation kick that tingles the back of my mouth (is that possible?) Due to the mouthfeel more than anything because of its dry finish, this beer leaves you wanting more. It's just dry enough to make you think you're still thirsty for another. So after this review, I'm headed to the fridge."
"What can you really say? Tastes like most every other macro lager. Goes down easy, very affordable, and invites some nostalgia for Wrigley field. In its time and place, it'll do."
"Taste is very limited, and hard to describe. Think Budweiser with less water. I poured mine down the drain after half the cup."
"this beer originated in La Crosse and it has been better. the style is standard along with miller and bud, but it stands out in after taste. the beer looks wonderful and clear add a little salt and it is wonderful. the aftertaste is light and hoppy. the beer should be in a keg cause i would never stop drinking it. i would say try it."
"D: Pabst or Old style taste test I think its the same damn thing."
"D - Not bad. This is better than Bud or Miller by far, and it is a lot like PBR (same brewer)., but more salty. This is nnot a bad budget beer for super-sessions on the weekend."
"D- Come on, I live in Lincoln Nebraska, I can and do drink this stuff like it's going out of style. It took a while to grow on me (Years), and I have never been into BMC other than High Life (Which I love). I will put it in the second string of my good old school american lager team."
"You know, I think I actually might have enjoyed this beer. And I don't know if I've ever said that about a macro before."
"I can't help it. I love this beer, more for sentimental reasons, although I do think its as good as any BMC."
"The color is a pale straw, very little carbonation. It tested worse after I swallowed. I drank half the bottle, trying to give it a fair shot. I eventually just ordered a new drink."
"Very light yellow in color, with a light white head. I can't really smell anything. It tastes rather sweet, very watery and goes down easy. Not much after taste, not much taste at all except the residual sweetness. Not bad really, I was suprised overall."
"No real distinguishing characteristic, in fact, no real taste. Typical American pale lager. Made for getting drunk definitely not for savoring. Had this in LaCrosse, WI, where it used to be made. Appearance, aroma, and taste is typical of the American macro-lager syle. Had a bit more of a sweet taste, however."
"Pours out the standard American big company pilsner color, with the added detriment that it smells skunked, even when it's fresh. Goes down a bit harsh, from too much carbonation. Tasted like an old pilsner that's been left outside for most of the day. Of course when you're at Wrigley, it's a wonderful thing and drinking it brings back some good baseball memories, but that's the only positive thing it really has going for it."
"I like to get this from time to time to try something that I think my grandpa would have had. It's not bad, pretty typical for the style, but definitely tastes better than Budweiser or Coors. A little on the watery side. A pretty plain beer thats good while having a barbecue or after mowing the lawn."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick fizzy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, pale malt and adjunct scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. It's crisp and clean. The taste is average. It has a dry pale malt taste. It's very light and easy drinking, but lacks the flavor that an all malt lager has. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average macro lager. I like the aroma and taste. There's nothing exceptional about it, but it drinks well anyway."
"I think many of the beers brewed at the Heileman's Brewery are quite alike. Old Style is no exception. Light gold appearance. White head that fizzes away quickly. Smells like corn, rice, hay, and metal. Tastes similar to the sub-average Black Label I just drank but just a little bit better. A little more malty, I guess. A little less watery. I just picked up a 12 pack of cans of both of these beers for $6.49 each so I won't bitch about how mediocre they are. I'll just save them in my basement friends for when my scumbag friends want to mooch a beer off of me. They'll have their choice of Black Label or Old Style."
"Yup finished about 3 pitchers of this stuff at the 8Ball. Normal lokking swill maybe a lighter shade of yellow than most with a long standing head. Smells of damn near nothing but cheap adjunct ladden lager. The taste is decent cold as hell, it really helps to hold down the flavor of spent grain. Nothing to the mouthfeel, could have been carbonated water for all I knew, but this made for a slammable beer as I won a few dollars in a 10oz. chugging competition."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Well its a fizzy yellow beer, high in carbonaiton and light in body. It is easy to drink, though I wouldn't drink this on a regular basis. This is one of the better macros I've had, and when I want to get wasted I think that I'll turn to this one."
""
"D: Easy as hell to kick em back. Not the tastiest beer, but it is hard to beat for the money. Works great with BBQ and is a perfect beer for going out on the lake."
"Old Style...the beer of my youth.Growing up in Chicago,I have downed dare I say hundreds of these.It was the party beer of choice...cheap and easy to get.I will not go so far as to say that it is a great beer,indeed,it is hardly what I consider beer today,but I loved it then.It beats most of the American macros out IMHO,but nowhere near as good as say,Sierra Nevada Pale Ale,or any Sam Adams for that matter.Still,there will always be a place in my heart for this one.Update...just recently found out this is not the ""Old Style"" I grew up with,it got bought out...not sure what the new stuff tastes like..."
"The appearance just the regular macro yellow color with tiny head that goes away,neither the smell grain and some hops.In the taste there's a light lager ,some maltiness very soft,water, does'nt feel bad in the mouth but there's no party neither. I would have another macro if i have to choice between then. I have seen cheaper beer taste better."
"The head retention was about the only thing going for this. Needless to say, I won't have this again."
"Uh... It is cheap, but that is about it for Old Style. It doesn't have any of the qualities necessary to make it a good beer. If you can't afford anything better then you probably shouldn't be sitting here on the computer, you should be out working to buy better beer. The only reason I didn't give it a zero was that Wrigley Field sells Old Style and I have good memories of Wrigley and Beer."
"overall, this is a cheap beer and should be treated as such, i can see having a few of these around for hot days fishing, and after ive had a couple"
"Would be great on a fishing trip in 90 degree heat. Not a world class beer, obviously, but a good call for a cheapo."
"Old Style has a nice mellow clean slightly hop scent to it. The tatste is much like the scent mellow and crisp. Clean and refreshing. Slight floral hop flavor with the sweet malt like flavors."
"Against all odds, I like both Old Style and Hamm's. I know, I know, they can't hold a candle to just about anything coming out of Belgium, but then it's unfair to judge them alongside beer that is so vastly different in construction and purpose. Old Style Beer is the winner of Macro Smackdown XIV by a nose (literally). Hamm's, however, has nothing to be ashamed of. Well done Pabst."
"Why ask why? If you're going to drink cheap and you're in Chicago, hard to go wrong with this even over a Pabst. However, if you live out of range of this beer, you're not missing anything. Average drinkability, but I quickly wanted other, better beers."
"The last two 24 packs I've gotten of old style have been very bad. The beer has gotten very flat and unenjoyable, low carbonation and low flavor. I don't know what the deal is here. I thought the first 24 pack was a fluke but I'm thinking no. Luckily Old Style light has not changed, it has more flavor and carbonation than Old Style, which is odd for a light beer compared to it's big brother. This is the only beer that I'd say go with the Light variety for full flavor."
"You have to pay your dues, and that's what it's all about before graduating to better beer. Old Style is best drank cold style. Even so it aint bad once you look around and realize where you are on the beer map. More yellow fizzy stuff. These aren't as corny as the others, so if thou must be a cheap beer swiller, this is not bad territory to invade."
"Overall, an ok pale lager, but the light taste and metallic feel holds it back."
"I'm going to try to be as objective as possible on this one, I grew up drinking this as the swill of choice, I can't get it where I live, therefore, its a bit nostalgic to get ahold of one. Old Style pours a straw color with a white fluffy head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Corn dominates the aroma, but I think I might smell a little bit of hops. Tastes like adjunct, but has more flavor than a lot of macros. Not bad by macro lager standards."
"Pours a light golden color, foamy head...oh, who are we kidding here. This is Old Style! a.k.a. Dog Pile. A Cubbie favorite and every midwest college man's rite of passage. For a macro it's average. Factor in the discount price (a 30-pack is like $10) and it's pretty damn tempting. Highly drinkable. To compare it with others, I'd put it above Natty Light or Old Mil, on par with High Life, and just below Stroh's - an underrated macro. I like this beer for the smooth taste as much as the nostalga. I always hope I'll be able to return to Chicago and order up an Old Style."
"Mouthfeel is where this one shines, mid-wieght with large SOFT carbonation bubbles. Drinkability is high."
"Appearance is fairly nice with a slightly darker gold than Bud and a pretty decent white head. The smell was weak and rather poor, as expected. Taste was thin, sweet with just a tiny bit of hops spicy-bitterness at the finish. Definitely better than some American Macro Lagers. Mouthfeel was average, thin and highly carbonated. A drinkable beer, but not something I'd recommend, unless the choices were really thin."
"drinkability: all day long"
"Overall : $10.00's for a 30 pack/$3.99 for a sixer of tallboys that tastes decent and wont kill you in the process is O.K. by me anyday!"
"Also a great fishing beer. Summer or winter, it doesn't matter."
"EDIT: Ok, so I had a bunch of these mixed with a bunch of PBR's and had the worst hangover ever...hah"
"Drinkability: Easy drinker, sessionable IMO. I can even consume this when it is just under room temp (garage temp tonight was about 50 degrees). Although, nothing beats cold Old Styles at a Cubs game. An old faithful stand by beer that doesn't do me wrong, and cheap too (case for $9.99)."
"Served on-tap in a large mug a local bar the other night. The appearance was watery and thin. Very sparse carbonation, and almost no head at all. Any scents were minimal, and very much alike any other macro lager. The taste was bland and crappy. Not much to really brag about. It did lack a bready aftertaste that I notice in most american macro lagers, which might have been its only upside in the taste department. The mouthfeel was thin, watery, and entirely too flat. Drinkability is okay, just not very desired. I suppose for the price, this beer does the trick, but its difficult to find many ways to compliment this one."
"I'd take this over many of its mass-produced rivals, of its style and of itself, it is (generally) inoffensive and average."
"Oh hell, had this one at the retro type bar, Tin Can. They have all the throwbacks along with some decent brews (I.e. Fat Tire). Said what the heck and popped a cold can of the Style. Made by Pabst, tasted like PBR  which really wasnt that bad. Semi-sweet brew with a Very light hit of malt, no hop. Macro stuff, but wasnt offensive to the taste buds. Good lawnmower brew."
"This beer also loses 1/2 point in drinkability (which will later be transferred to City Lager) for leaving the city of La Crosse and, therefore, causing substantial economic dislocation and bringing about the (temporary) loss of the world's largest 6-pack. Boo to you Old Style."
"It's the color of cider. Fizzy white head. Carbonation bubbles rise quickly. Aroma is faintly sweet and corny. A little grainy, but nothing that's hardly even noticeable. Pretty fizzy in the mouth. Body is about medium or so. Not bad for a macro. The taste is just plain ass bland. Not a lot about it. Sweetness is really subdued. Dry, grainy notes are barely perceptible. And the aftertaste, what there is of it, is none too pleasing. I've had better macoswill in my day."
"Verdict: Well, you get what you pay for. Old Style is a budget beer, and I probably wouldn't recommend that anyone go out of their way to give it a try. Still, Old Style is a nice gameday beer that's always welcome in my fridge during football season."
"I think this is better than alot of American macros, and for someone looking for cheap beer this is both cheaper and FAR better than other choices like Keystone or Natural."
"Leave the PBR to hipster losers. If you want to drink swill that just about tastes like real beer, there's no beating an Old Style fan can. I would compare this is beer to Miller or Coors, but it actually has a flavor. As a transplanted East Coaster living in Chicago, I was skeptical when the natives introduced me to Old Style. A few cubs games and tall can six packs later, it won me over with its high flavor to price ratio."
"I know this is sort of agaist the grain, but I have been saving this beer for a review for a little while, and tonight is the night I chose to go ahead with it. The beer pours a very light straw color. Not far from what I expect for an American pilsner. The head is about a finger high, but falls quickly. The nose is sweet and rich in corn. Definately better than others I've had. This is an above average beer for the style. It is sweet and definately not offensive as other macros have been in my opinion. The beer is thin in my mouth, as it would be expected. There is a very good drinkability on this brew. I could sit down to a 6-er of this one almost any summer night. The only better Old Style I ever had was out of a waxed paper cup at Wrigley Field. Nothing can beat your first Old Style at a Cubs game."
"Easy enough beer to drink, again this is not a world-beater but it will do if your only other choices are macros. Solid regional player."
"one of my favorite local brews, old style is most easily compared to pabst, old milwaukee, and maybe lacrosse. this is my number one beer if i need something on a very hot summer day, with time to kill, and a burger on the grill. the big appeal, besides it's new found yuppie following, it cost. like said beers above, it is easy to obtain a 30 pack for 10-11 dollers, or if you budget, you can get a 15 pack for 6-7 dollers, now that's savings...overall, this is one of chicago's, ""old man beers", yet one of the better ones out here."
"Clear brilliant gold color with a huge white head that can grow to a huge level if you're not careful. Smells barely of anything, but malt and adjunct are present. Taste is light and crisp, not much in the flavor department, but it does not offend in any way. Goes down really easy, drinking many of these would not be a struggle to say the least. A good lawnmower beer."
"I friend of mine came home friday with a case of old style returnables. The beer has a very sharp distinctive taste almost like the taste from a premium grain belt. I was told it was dirt cheap, but I probably wouldn't by it myself. This beer is worth a try if you've never had it."
"Post Script: My memories of this beer will forever be attached to the image of my fiancee getting violently sick for an entire day after a bottle of Hennepin and about 5 Old Styles..."
"I got a sixer to compare it to LaCrosse Lager, which is now being microbrewed in the original Old Style brewery. Even without a comparison, I could tell this was the loser. Corny taste among other adjuncts at work. Although there is... wait a minute... a hint of hops and yeasty lager taste poking through at the end. So not totally beyond redemption. But still, pale straw color, fizzy like soda pop. Why bother?"
"ng"
"Crystal-clear yellow, the white head fizzes quickly from its apex of a ¼ inch, soapy. No lace. Sweet and malty, adjuncts too. Mild potency, it is not inviting but not really offensive either. The first sip is somewhat jarring and so stereotypical in taste: beer. Sweet and malty, its not cloying or gross, the graininess balances the taste nicely, the hops are soft kisses peppered throughout. The finish is dry, slightly toasty and grainy solid. Seems free of chemicals. Medium body. Firm carbonation. This is a very respectable Pale Lager/American Lager. Id drink this over B/M/Cs standard products, any day. If you factor in the low price (a six-pack of tall boy cans run about $4.00) it is hard not to imbibe in Old Style on occasion."
"This is just not a good beer at all. It also gives me the runs the morning after I drink it. But it is good for drinking games because it goes down easy and doesn't have quite as strong of an adjunct taste as other macros. I read this beer was only 3.2% abv and I was wondering if that was true because I can't find anywhere that says how strong it is. I know it tastes watery but 3.2% is ridiculous!"
"This beer was given to me by my roommate, who is from chicago. He tells me that this is the beer of wrigley field, and thats why theres a special place for it in his heart. Not being a chicagoinian, i dont have that feeling, and without it, i cannot recommend this beer to you. Its a standard pale lager, not much flavor besides the water, only real purpose is a nice buzz. So if thats whats youre after, this is for you"
"Clear pale golden-yellow color, has a small foamy white head that doesn't last very long, light grainy and corn aromas. Starts with a light beady and grainy flavors, finishes clean with a mild hop bite, not much of a aftertaste, not bad for what it is."
"Pours with a 1/2 inch dry white head. First taste is of grain. Flavor is pretty typical of American macro's. Perhaps a little drier than most. Faint hoppiness. The grains are where the flavor is. Not a really good beer, but not awfull either. Served ice cold which was a plus."
"I love this beer. It is in my mind truely a great cheap beer. It has a definitive lager aroma, light golden color, and a crisp taste and feel. Pours great, and has a nice head, but doesn't last all that long. I haven't been drinking long (3 Years) but i have drank numerous beers, and this one remains a favorite. This beer, in my mind is the epitome of what a budget beer should be. Difficult to find in the Detroit area, its worth the 4 hour trip to Chicago to get a few 30-packs every once in a while to me."
"Straw colored with a little white lace sitting on top...Corn adjunct on the nose...easy drinking with a smooth, creamy texture...flavor is subdued grains with just a kiss of hops...really not a bad beer..a tich below my top Macro's of High Life, Point, Pabst, and Grain Belt Premium, but in the next rung with Coors, Schlitz, and Hamms(another underrated old label), and Stroh's..."
"this is an old regional brand that used to be big in minnesota/wisconsin/illinois area. not sure if it's true to it's style anymore, but it's a decent american lager that goes down easy and quenches accordingly. otherwise nothing special...but a nice change up from the usual suspects. if there was a rating for nostalgia, this gets a 5."
"A very average American Lager, but surprisingly, it has some malt taste to it with just a hint of hops.  A nice, quirst-quencher. I am sure the fine folks of Chicago still drink enough of this to keep the brand alive."
"Surprisingly not-bad for a cheap beer.  Slightly sweet front, fairly flat middle and a somewhat astringent, citric finish.  Some wine-like characteristics.  One of the better slammers."
