"Not realy much of anything as far as aroma or flavor except a slight grassy/grain flavor, very inoffensive but pretty much flavorless."
""
""
""
"Great easy drinking beer.  Good taste, better than most American big brands."
""
""
""
"If I could have gone lower I would have, taste like goat piss"
""
""
""
""
"Very easy drinker, not complex at all."
"Not horrible. But it's a refreshing easy going beer."
"Drunk from a 355 mL can (stamped ""210715"") while at Hyatt Ziva in Puerto Vallarta. Light flavored with basic grainy malt body, cooked corn and mild hop spice and bitterness. Light to medium body and decent carbonation. Another drinkable lager, great for sun and beach, but nothing special."
""
"Just Mexican Budweiser.  Bad beer and slam a lime in it to make it go down"
"O- Easy drinking Lager that's much better than Corona and it's just as available. No Lime Necessary."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes just like water to me."
""
"not as good as amber version"
""
""
"Overall : Poor flavors, too watery, and a little stale."
""
"When you go to a mexican restaurant and the waiter tells you that they have dos equis, be sure its ""ambar"" (amber) or better drink something else."
"pours what you kind of expect an adjunct lager to pour. with this being said it definitely leads the pack in this category. Personally not a fan of beers that requires something like a lime to be drinkable."
""
""
"This is a decent lager. I can't say anything bad about it. If you're biased towards to Mexican beer, such as Corona, make sure to leave that aside. This beer has a bad rep, but it sits well, and is good for having on the deck in the summer. That being said, there are many more better choices."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When compared to the most common Mexican beers and even the macro American stuff, this is consistent and a cold can is always welcomed."
"It's a nice light refreshing beer."
"OVERALL:  This would barely pass as a lawnmower beer but, there are better choices even for that.  I would never willingly consume this beer again.  We seriously need to rethink NAFTA."
"Fairly typical pale lager that's drinkable & more substantial than others in its class."
""
""
""
"They should just make the Amber and call it a day."
""
"Light and crisp, similar to Corona, but I think a bit more flavor.  Always best with a wedge of lime and a pinch of salt.  Easy to find."
""
""
"This or modelo especially are my go to Mexican beer"
""
""
""
""
"Not bad while sitting pool/ocean side in Mexico."

"I don't hear too many positive reviews about Mexican beers, but I like them. I can't imagine eating a nice Mexican dinner with a Heineken. Dos Equis is the perfect brew for that occasion. It's light and has just the right amount of that South O' the border maltiness. A twist of lime and you are set. Enjoy."

"Pale yellow in color with a significant but fleeting head that retreats to minimal lacing.  Smell and taste have some malt but adjuncts are clearly present.  The mouth feel is a bit thin and the finish almost non-existent.  I wouldn't turn one down, but Dos Equis Amber is a much better choice if both are available."

"Horrible. I'm no beer geek but this is probably the worst beer I've ever tasted. No hops, no flavor at all. Watery bread and piss. Yuck."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer sucks. Horrible lingering after taste. Tried it twice thinking maybe I had a bad batch the first time. But nope, it's just nasty all the time. You want a cheap beer to party with?? Tecate it's cheaper then this shit and way better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You know? As far as mainstream lagers go, I like it. It has a pleasant, almost sweet flavor and I can drink it all night if I want. Good for parties and large gatherings with a lot of non-craft beer people."

"I personally like Dos Equis a lot because I find it super refreshing. There's not a ton of depth to it, but it tastes light and cool on a warm summer day. I enjoy the lightness and the tang. On the other hand, I also love a good dark beer, and this is about as far as you're going to get from that! ;)"

"Bleah."
""
""
""
"Overall, decent Amber lager, but nothing I need to really seek out. I'd only have again if I was handed this."
""
""
""
""
""
"I first tried Dos Equis in Cozumel, Mexico. I found that it pairs quite well as a chaser to a sweeter liquor. My personal favorite pairing is DiSarrono on the rocks with a Dos Equis to clear the sweetness off the palate in between."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Golden hued with good clarity. Minimal head barely covers part of the top of this beer. Aroma of light grain and corn is prevalent. Mouth is thin and watery. I get pretty much entirely corn with the flavor and a bit of Saaz hops. Another hot weather brew that is highly quaffable."
""

"O-ok beer, nothing impressive about flavor or experience"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A relatively clean drinking beer, but very lacking in flavor."
""
"it was ok. tried it for the first time. it was a hoppy for my taste I like stout. they have a good taste texture and look. it wasn't bad that looking and it was not that hoppy but just a little to hoppy for me. everyone likes different things. if you would like to try it its ok not to hoppy which is a good thing for me"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12oz can into a 12oz glass. Pours translucent straw with a small white head that dissipates quickly leaving nothing. Smells of sweet grain but very weakly. Tastes of sweet grain not much else, but a fuller flavor than most adjuncts. Beer is light bodied nice carbonation, crisp finish. Overall an average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had high expectations from this beer, possibly because of the good marketing. This is by far the worst beer I ever smelled and tasted. I tried it warm and ice cold, both had a greasy scent. Almost like left over grease smell. I am not the pickiest beer enthusiast either, I just love beer but the awfulness brought me here to rate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: decent, but nothing to get excited about."
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured from the green bottle into a shaker pint glass, pub fare after I tried the only craft offering in the house (Rogue Dead Guy Ale, if you care). First off, yes, it is better than Corona or Sol. I'd propose that said feat is not difficult to achieve. Secondly, while there is indeed some German lager character present, one has to dig deep to appreciate this feature. A light honey hue with tons of white bubbles, smells vaguely sour and metallic, old wet grain and a skunky vegetal note that for some reason reminds me of cilantro. Perhaps I am smelling some noble hop or noble hop extract. Tastes like fizzy alcoholic water with some faint lemon rind and green apple character ... Actually, the apple isn't all that faint. The skunk spray effect coupled with the fruitiness (presumably acetaldehyde) and a decent dose of cooked corn yield this soapy pungent herbal note that again makes me think cilantro, and by and large this beer remains something I'd drink in Mexico over Tecate or Corona but has previous little else to recommend. The Dos Equis Amber is better without being spectacular, for what's its worth."
"There's a whole lot of Mexican American Adjunct Lagers out there and this one actually professes to be the work of a German brewmaster. It holds little German influence but ranks better than most Mexican beers as I was not compelled to throw a lime in it. For the most part the palate is met with a barley grain but hints of rice and a corn sugar sweetness take hold. The feel is very crisp, sugary sweet and a tad thicker than others from south of the border. This is better than some worst than others and right around OK."
"I personally did not care for this beer. It tasted very watery. I cannot give a fair analysis of the smell, appearance or mouthfeel because I don't remember it all that well as it has been a while since I've had it but the taste didn't do anything for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yes, it's pretty mediocre. It has that sweet corn smell and taste that is expected, but it's really not that bad at all. I would absolutely enjoy this during or after a hard working day on a farm in the hot sun. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to pick this up."
""
"Dos Equis Lager Especial ---2/5."
""
"What I like about this beer is that it does not have that characteristic and ever intensifying AAL sweetness that lasts much too long into the after taste. Remarkably fresh, light, thin, balanced and delicious. I liked this beer more than I ever thought I would."

"A pretty good American Adjust Lager. Despite the green bottle, there's low skunkiness, which is nice."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Mediocre but drinkable lawnmower beer, but this isn't anything i would purchase on my own again."
"I don't agree that this beer should be classified as AAL. I think the BA needs a new category, such as ""Caribbean Lager""."

"Overall: This is not a bad tasting beer, it just doesn't have much of a taste. It has a smooth start which is interrupted with an unpleasant acid carbonation. A decent beer on a scorning hot day. For those of you who ""don't always drink beer, but when you do …“; i.e., if you are a non beer drinker, this is a good choice for you."
""
"O: I recall Dos Equis Amber being an unexciting, but acceptable beer, though I've got to admit I haven't had one in years. However, this Special Lager just isn't very good. Very little character to speak of and what is there isn't anything to brag about. I'm going to go squeeze a lime in it and hopefully that will make it taste like something better than what it is."

"I used to love this stuff when I was a kid in my early 20's, before I started experimenting with craft beer. I haven't had one in over 10 years, and saw a 16oz can on sale at the gas station and picked it up. After spoiling myself with a decade of sampling some of the finest beers in the world today, I didn't expect to care for it nowadays, and I was right. This is just your typical, lousy, run-of-the-mill American adjunct. Piss yellow, almost no head, and an even flatter flavor. This is even worse than Corona. It's basically Rolling Rock with a Mexican themed label. I let my desire for a little nostalgia rob me of $1.49. It won't be happening again."

"Overall: Probably my favorite Mexican beer that I know of, I have not had many. I think the green bottle ruined the taste a bit. LIght enough to drink all night. Not my favorite light beer, but I won't turn one down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That said, this is a pretty good adjunct lager on the basis of taste, since I can finish the bottle no problem. Some of the local adjunct beers here are just junk."

"Do not know why this beer has sun low ratings. I don't think people realize it os not suppose to be a flavor monster. I love this beer when it is freeking got outside and I go in to one of my favorite restaurants and get a 24oz glass and it is freezing cold. It goes down super smooth, light hoppyness. Great beer if I'm looking for a light yet complex smooth flavor."

"Overall : The best you can say is it’s easy drinking and relatively inoffensive, but that’s only because it doesn’t take like much of anything. I will pass on this one ever again, and not recomend it to anyone. There are much better beers for the price out their in the store."

" Pours a little stiller than the standard BMC beers, taste is more pleasant with a little grain taste and less skunkiness than most ""Mexibeers"". Its a real easy drinker on a hot day thanks to the wateriness and the low ABV. There were PBRs, Miller Lites and this in the fridge, I kept going with the XX's. Thats all the praise I'll offer this one."
""
""
""

"I had been curious about this particular beer for awhile, so I purchased a six pack of bottles at a local convenience store. Definitely not a great beer, but certainly not a bad one. The beer was a pale yellow with no real distinct odor that I was able to detect, although it had a slightly sweet smell to it. The taste was quite clean and rather on the light side. This is not the kind of beer that I would picture the most interesting man in the world drinking, but it would not be a bad beer served ice cold with some wings or good Mexican food."
""

"Overall - So apparently the Most Interesting Man in the World drinks the most uninteresting beer in the world. Cool. I've had tap water with more character. Reading the date code, I believe this was bottled on January 30th, 2012. If these kinds of beers are supposed to quench one's thirst, then I guess everyone is taking Interesting Man's motto of ""Stay thirsty, my friends"" to heart. As indifferent as I am to this beer, it is a candidate for a re-review."

"Overall, this trumps the Natty Daddy that I just had ... no contest. Natty had a bizarre sweetness to it, but Dos Equis is actually a decent adjunct lager. In comparison to Budweiser or Coors, I like it quite a bit more, as it doesn't have that extremely skunky corn aroma or flavor. Quite carbonated and lacking flavor (that DAMN metallic taste...), but still a decent choice if you want to get a buzz."
"Summary - As a lager, this is overall pretty poor. The smell and taste is non-existent and it is much too fizzy to be enjoyable on its own. With a lime wedge and some nice Tex-Mex, however, Dos Equis is a great option."
""
""
""
""
"I tried the bottled version. I was very impressed. I really came to believe that all Mexican beers were as bad as the American. But it wasn't the case. This beer is above average, very smooth , very drinkable. Dos equis became one of my go to beers when watching a game."

"Draft: Poured a golden yellow color lager with a medium white foamy head with average retention and some light lacing. Aroma of overly sweet adjunct is quite gross. Taste is also dominated by loads of gross sweet adjunct notes with a bland aftertaste. Body is light with light oily notes. Overly sweet bland lager."

""
"Overall: Not a bad brew but not definitely a good one either. I am pretty sure during the right climate it is incredibly appreciated. Salud!"
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. The brew smells like sweet malt, corn, and some light citrus. It tastes like sweet malt and corn. Not much to this brew at all. Mouthfeel/body is light, and it's smooth and easy to drink. It's really not bad, but it's not exactly good either. I have no problem drinking this occasionally, but I wouldn't make a point to buy it. Got a bottle from one of my buddies for free so I figured I might as well tick it."

"Overall: thin, watery and without much flavour, a little sweet corn and grains. Nice on a hot day when you don't need flavour so much as you do refreshment. I still say that there are better beers even in this price range (AU$43 a case in 2012)."

"There is no way the most interesting man in the world drinks this beer. It is not the least interesting beer in the world, but worse. It clearly tastes like an adjunct lager, but it's not as carbonated as Bud and the like to at least improve the feel. I would prefer a Bud, because while the flavor isn't as strong, it goes down easier. Realistically, I wouldn't want either, but for those rare times I want cheap beer, I'm not getting XX."

"Love the commercials but the beer is a tad bit lacking. It pours well and the head looks good, but its taste is a bit watery. Feels fine in the mouth but it has that ""spilled-beer-in-a-bar"" smell. Not the kind of aroma that inspires one to spend lots of money on."
"The stale and off character here is pretty grim, not whether its the batch or this beer in general, but not eager to rush out to find out."
""
"O-Will pass it in the future."
""
""
"O: this actually wasn't as bad as I thought I would be. I've had this beer more than several times over the years and finally got a chance to review it here. Since its pretty drinkable and a decent sweetness in the taste, I would say this is one of the better AAL's out there."
"O: Easy enough to drink but not really anything special with this beer."
""
""
"Overall, I have to say I'd never buy this beer again. If someone handed me one I'd down it without a thought, but as far a plopping down money for one, no way. It's not the worst beer in the world it just doesn't have much going for it outside of the fact that it's wet, cold, and if you drink enough you could catch a buzz. Great advert campaign, but I guess this review renders me the least interesting man in the world."

"Very subtle, grainy flavor with a watery feel. Goes down easy with a crisp finish. Despite the lack of flavor, I find it to be fairly inoffensive - this is a good choice if you are eating something spicy (like Mexican) or anything with a strong flavor. I do not recommend drinking this on it's own, not enough taste to be had."
"O: Good beer for a hot summer day. That's about it."

"12fl.oz. bottle. Dos XX Pint glass. (From my notes: Bought at “Mexican Week” in a mall. Enjoyed at home). Pale golden color. Crystal appearance. Brief, white in color, froth. Corn & sweet aromas. Crispy upfront followed by smooth sweet adjuncts. Light body. High & lively carbonation. Watery texture. Dry finish similar to many European lagers. Clean bitterness is missed even though."

"Someone left a few of these at my house so I figured why not, I've been drinking IPAs so maybe being a little buzzed will help it go down. Poured from a green bottled 12 oz into a pint glass this pours a high foaming white head which leaves some type of lacing/left over foam with a light yellow color. The smells are pretty light and a little watery, maybe some adjuncts. The feel is light and watery. The taste is about the same, not really my thing but to each their own, thankfully I didn't pay for them."

"Picked up a six pack right before a nice few hours cleaning the pool. Wonderful mouthfeel, And a great taste make this stuff what it is. If Mexico has this stuff, Why do they still make Corona? It's sad that most people think of Corona when they think of Mexican beer. Can't say much for the smell because...Well why in the hell would you be smelling a beer and not drinking it?. But this stuff is almost like a smoother, Slightly better tasting Labatt Blue. The color was pretty much that of a standard lager, With some carbonation. Definitely not disappointed with this, but it must be ice cold to be thoroughly enjoyed."

"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of grain, sugar, and some metallic aromas. Taste is the same but there is also an off flavor that I can’t put my finger on that is almost medicinal. There is a very light bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that is somewhat undrinkable, especially with the off flavor I am getting."
"T: light, somewhat lemony; watery; little in the way of hops (of course), and the malt is not all that prominent either; very easy going down, and no wretched aftertaste; that's not bad for this genre, so it gets higher marks than most of this sort"

"24 ounce can states crafted in Mexico since 1897 to commemorate the arrival of the 20th Century. Pours a clear golden hue with fizzy carbonation forming a white head that dwindles quickly. Aroma has corn and rice adjuncts with a slightly metallic note, not bad overall...another mass produced lager for sure. Cereal grains noted for sure full of creamed corn and cooke veggie notes this beer is something else to be entertained by...tastes like a cooked vegetable note with cereal corn and rice grains in the flavor minimal hops becomes cloying after a short amount of imbibing. Not the best or worst beer I've ever tried but something I shall steer clear of in the future. God Bless America this is horrible adjunct lager we are forced to drink due to an large amount of Mexicans entering the culture always a beer I enjoyed the amber lager version of, the Lager especial just isn't up to my standards."

"Poured this American Adjunct Lager out of a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear, straw color, produced a average white head with poor retention and no lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma is a little off putting, smelled of sweet corn and some grain. Light in body, this macro mexican brewed version of a american lager is thin, with the flavor of cooked corn, malted grain and some small amount of hop finish. Better then some Mexican brewed American beers i.e. Corona....but still a sub par, low quality brew. Prost!"

"Neighbor had a case for the Superbowl so I took one, it's been a while. Poured to a pint glass. The beer pours a golden straw color with a nice 2 finger white head that has some retention and lacing but not much. The nose is strong in grassy tones but not a lot else to report. The taste is light and crisp that starts off with a sweetness I likened to corn with hints of barely and a mild bitterness. Finishes with a hint of grass and cereal grain. Light bodied and decently carbonated. Overall, I remember loving this beer...in high school. My tastes have changed. I wouldn't refuse another though my any means."

"Dos Equis slightly edges out most macros in terms of smell, mouthfeel, and flavor, but not enough to compensate for the premium price.

It tasted as bad as it smelled with its musk and watery smell, and nothing set this beer apart from other adjuncts. I apologize if this was a slammer, but I honestly have nothing positive to say about this beer and felt my review should show my honesty."

"Final Grade: 2.94, a C."
"O: Ok brew that I enjoy on occasion."
"Taste: Cereal grains and corn malts. Minimal hop bitterness. Crisp and dry; finishes clean with a grainy aftertaste. As far as macro lagers go, this is one of the better examples, though that's obviously not saying much."
"O: well this definitely is a cut above Modelo Especial, and tends to be refreshing while sitting in the sun on the beach. I would say the amber version edges this one out. All in all, for what it is, its not bad… or offensive, just bland and flavorless as I would expect."
"Overall, to the “Most Interesting Man in the World”, you picked a very uninteresting beer to drink."
"Overall: Seems closer to Heineken than Corona. Not bad, but not a whole ton of flavor, or a whole lot going on. I'll drink it, but it isn't my preferred style."
"O - This would hit the spot on a hot, summer day. As far as macro-lagers go, this is not a bad choice."
"Full carbonation. Fizzy and foamy. Smells skunked, although I think that’s how it’s supposed to smell. To say no flavor is a lie, there’s a flavor here but it’s not pleasant. Thin body. Leaves me with that nasty “beer mouth” feeling. How did I ever drink so much of this one in the past? Adding salt and squeezing a lime would improve the flavor, only because then it would taste like salt and lime. In fact, midway through I ended up squeezing the lime into it. My friend’s treat, and I appreciate the gesture."
"O: overall for a south of the border lager is is not too bad, light and refreshing, while still having a bit of flavor."
"Dr: Very drinkable and pairs well with Mexican food. The price is high and the quality is low."
"O-This beer is designed for drinking mass quantities of so for what it's worth it is pretty easy to get down. It is better than many other adjunct lagers but does not really add anything. I would say it is better than other domestics but is not very useful for anything besides a hot summer day."
"O: Not a bad beer. It is crisp and easy to drink. A good alternative to the common beers."
"O - Perhaps better than your typical macro, but still not very good."
"O) I don't always drink lagers produced in Mexico, but when I do...."
"Overall, its not a bad beer. I prefer it to it's amber counterpart, and it's definitely one of the better adjunct lagers out there."
"O: Smooth and inoffensive, this is my choice with light Mexican fair, especially considering most cheap Mexican restaurants don't have any better offerings. Helps when eating the really spicy stuff just fine, too, which I love."
"Pours a golden-yellow color and smells of grain, grasses and perhaps some citrus. Flavor is fairly mild and watery with a sweet, grain and citrus flavor. Finish is slightly bitter, yet pleasant tasting. Drank this at a birthday BBQ and it really hit the spot, though if you’re looking for complexity, look elsewhere."
"I love this cerveza!I have tried a few spanish brews that I have not been impressed. It smell like a little skunky, but the taste is great. Mouthfeel is like a bud and this beer is very balanced and easy to drink. Try this beer and you will not be mad with yourself!"
"Not horrific for the style, but I find that this could be better. Wanted some crisp edges. Got some bitter edges, but some sugars where I didn't want them. Skunk is skunk, and the nose wasn't so overpowering to make this entirely off-putting. But this is middle of the road American Adjunct."
"Cheers"
"Drink- it is what it is. Low abv low flavor for the masses"
"O: This is a decent option for a picnic on a warm summer day. A little more flavor than most Adjuncts."
"My pour netted me a finger of foaming, fizzy, bone-white head with lousy retention. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had the all too-familiar cereal quality associated with AALs. Mouthfeel was thin with the light lager taste that is a staple of the style. Finish was refreshing, sure, but it was cold and it is a hot day, so water might be equally refreshing. It was not bad, but it was simply a standard interpretation of a lesser style."
"D: Not the best not the worst."
"On a hot summer day when you're at the airport in San Antonio, no complaints here. It is what it is, and that's not bad."
"I like it alot, it is nothing special but very drinkable, and has a solid taste. The only problem is that I can get just as good a beer for way less. I would definetly drink this beer again and will enjoy several at the event Im going to."
"Appearance is an amber color with a paltry white head that disappears quickly. I couldn't pick up much scent, maybe some very weak bread, but at least there's nothing funky going on here. Taste was surprisingly decent for an AAL. Malt flavors with a slight hint of lemon or lime, a little sweetness, and a buttery taste in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin. Quite refreshing and drinkable, and goes great with some Mexican food. If your beer choices are slim, this isn't a bad choice to make compared to other AALs."
"Overall-The most interesting man in the world should stick to whatever other beverage he drinks, this beer sucks."
"Overall a utilitarian lager that does the job on a 90F+ early evening. The first one I had as soon as I got home from work actually delivered more simple satisfaction straight outta the green bottle. This one isn't to be disected/pondered."
"Mouthfeel - best thing about this beer, its like what and quenches my summer hotness"
"It's not terrible but it really has no life to it. The only thing going for it is the crisp finish. It's not a beer I would seek out."
"D - Typical mass produced and mass-marketed beer; makes a good beer to drink in the summer time under the sun"
"Poured a perfectly clear yellow gold with a bone white head that diminished, but did not disappear. It smells metallic, of corn and cereal grains. It has a good deal of carbonation. The taste is of dry, bland, bread. I often don't mind if my beer just tastes like bread, but this doesn't taste like very good bread. Though, I've had worse. It's a tad bit starchy. The dryness is notable. It's definitely not overly sweet like many adjunct lagers, but the taste is disagreeable. I'm not buying this again. I'll be sticking with Sol as my Mexican beer of choice."
"O: Love the ad-campaign, but pass on this beer, for me. Admittedly, I had a few these 10 years ago while on vacation in Rosarito, before I knew any better, but Adjunct Lagers no longer satisfy, and Dos Equis Special Lager is no exception. The amber variant is marginally better though."
"O-not an awful beer for a hot mexican day though it seems to get more watery. its best to keep your glass full. i definitely prefer this to the US macros. it has more flavor, and is more balanced."
"Finishes off with a thick, creamy, milky mouthfeel. Happy Cinco de Mayo."
"O: I buy this from time to time when having crab legs. I think this and corona go perfectly with crabs but I would not drink this alone."
"Overall this beer has nothing to bring to the table."
"Poured like a typical macro: straw color, thin head that fizzled out, fizzy carbonation. Rancid aroma, mulched grass and stale hops, which carried through in the taste. Light, watered down mouthfeel with no real flavor at all. Sickeningly sweet aftertaste with lots of funk and skunk. Too be avoided."
"The XX Amber is a lot better in my opinion."
"Overall - This beer just doesn't do it for me. It might be drinkable, but it's drinkability doesn't do it justice. It's just plain gross and I will pass it up every time I see it. No wonder my Wife likes it..."
"Another at my ""watering hole"". Typical yellow fizzy brew in a pint shaker glass. Little to no head and no lacing. No aroma that I could pick up; taste was probably slightly better than the other yellow fizzy brews on the tour. Sweet malt (corn), crisp, no bite/taste."
"Standard, average Mexican brew. Good on a hot day, I'm sure, but nothing to analyze too deeply."
"I hate to pour beer down the drain but I might just save myself the calories. Honestly, in terms of drinkability, I just might prefer a Coors Light over this one. Steer clear of them both."
"Pours a 2"" soap bubble head. Clear straw yellow in color. Smells of corn or some other nondescript grain. Taste is water with a hint of grain and hint of sweetener. There's the slightest of a zing. Overall thirst quenching and nothing at all disagreeable. The epitome of average (C). They say the most interesting man in the world drinks this. Well if that's true then he chose the boring to balance out all the rest of that excitement."
"Drinkability is amazing in this beer. The best Mexican lager by far. It is refreshing and smooth all the way down. You can drink them all day long in nice weather and it has a good taste to match, unlike other watered down Mexicans (Corona)..."
"D- High on drinkability, i think the Amber Dos Equis is a better quality beer and would get that over this any day."
"Would drink it if it was offered to me by a friend or something but it's lacking in flavor and body an I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. Its better than most other American adjunct lagers but not by much"
"O: Extremely easy drinking because it isn't offensive in any way. I'd prefer this to light lagers and the BMCs, but on the same hand I'd rather have a PBR or Schlitz."
"Had a bottle of this at the Texas Roadhouse 5-26-2008. The pour was a typical pale yellow. The head faded rather quickly. Had a little bit of a skunky smell to it. Taste was a little hoppy but not much at all. Some light grains and malts shine through. This type of beer is so common that it's hard to say much different about it."
"The stuff would be outstanding ice cold with a plate of Enchiladas."
"Poured on-tap at a resort in Mexico. It pours a slightly hazy yellow-gold with a thin, fluffy white head. Smells of malt and corn. The beer is slightly sour malt flavored, with a crisp, light body. Minimal toasty aftertaste, with a quick, light finish. Pretty easy to drink when you have no other choices."
"D-really drinkable. Most of this style is so I am not suprised here"
"D: Drinking several wouldn't be a problem."
"This beer is very average. Nothing offensive and nothing really interesting about it. Adding a lime to it adds some flavor but it's still pretty mediocre. Fairly easy drinking though."
"Poured into flared pilsner glass. Poured a clean, clear straw gold with no head, thus no retention or lacing. The aroma was grainy and sweet but fairly bland. The taste sweet and grainy as well. The body was fairly typical, but had a nice level carbonation on the tongue. Drinkability was OK, but with a beer this bland, why bother? I tried it, you don't have to."
"Nice frothy one finger head with decent retention and good lacing. Very pale, clear straw body. Very faint coffee and even fainter caramel/nut smell. Light tobacco taste, very thin on the alcohol. Not particularly flavorful. Very dry. For its style, it's actually a decent beer. The mouthfeel is good. Doesn't feel watery, there's plenty of spice on the tongue. I don't always drink a Dos Equis, but when I do, it's pretty enjoyable. Probably one of the better Mexican lagers I've had."
"Had this on tap at a Mexican restaurant because it was ""Happy Hour"" and 24 oz taps were $2.75. Should have just gone with the Budweiser, a brew that I don't particularly like, but would have been a better choice. Why do I think that Mexican beer is going to taste better in a Mexican ""joint"" than a home? Nothing to write home about. Maybe I would think different about this beer having it in Mexico, but in Willmar, Minnesota I could easily stick with Bud."
"The aroma is almost nonexistent with a tiny bit of hops but mostly malt and corn. The appearance is pale gold with a tiny head. The taste is like the aroma. It's very inoffensive and clean. The palate is typical for the style. Overall not much here in the way of bad but not much to taste. The only good thing is that it's refreshing."
"taste simple"
"I was very disappointed with this beer. I recall enjoying this one at restaurants, but this 6-pack is almost worthy of a drain pour. I may try another review if I get one while dinning out in the future."
"Spring Break choice of beverage in Mexico! Galore! Average to almost large egg-white head that mostly lasted. Fair display of lacework. Clear sparkling body with a hay like yellow color. Aroma was primarily sweet malty hay like with a hint of hoppy grass. Light bodied with an average carbonation and light dry texture. Moderated sweet flavor with a hint of bitterness. Light sweet hay with a hint of bitter grass."
"This is ok beer besides the skunk smell that comes from it! Green bottles dont help the smell. It has a horrible after taste but takes ok when you first sip it! I have to admit the commercials are cool!Put this in a can and it will be better! Havent tried the amber version yet! Hopes it better!"
"The only really good thing about this beer is that I ran out and dont have to drink it ever again..."
"D- This is a bit one dimensional. Good for a hot day which tonight is not."
"Light bodied, average carbonation. Feels about average. Not a good beer, and not the worst I have had."
"d- as far as the mexican/south american beers go its decent but its still a diluted session beer. ill take it over corona/tecate/modelo/etc"
"Light and golden, crystal clear with a minimal head, some lacing present. Smell is strongly of corn and grains, a bit sweet, nothing more, nothing less. At first taste, this beer introduces some very grainy and nutty flavors to the palate, followed by a slight sweetness and a very, very faint floral hop character that is short lived. Mouthfeel is light and watery, moderate carbonation, with a very dry aftertaste, its almost as if all the saliva and moisture from the mouth has vanished after a sip of this swill. Not too refreshing, though it does have a crisp grainy/carbonation bite to it at first sip. Nothing to seek out, but it is drinkable, just not much going on as far as flavor goes."
"D: Not really great. I've had it before and wouldn't seek it out again."
"Are you supposed to start thirsty and stay thirsty? What does the commercial imply? Tough to say, I guess. As I sip the watery lager, I can feel my beard growing more sexy by the swallow. At each faint brush of hop, I become more mysterious. What kind of man would drink such a flavorless beverage? It's tasty if you like that wet dog flavor in a beer. Not bad at all, eh? Very little to it, some faint hops and malt, distinctively watery."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the standard appearance and the ""chuggable"" drinkability. While many of these adjunct lagers use corn, it is rarely exhibited so forwardly in the taste, as it is here, leading to a bland, unremarkable brew. For the style, it passes, but is not necessarily delectable by any means."
"Not a beer to get drunk on, perhaps a gateway to liquor like I use it for, but not for the actual purpose. Definitely good for just relaxing one evening watching sports or a movie."
"Overall, this is a simple beer. Has little characteristics but I can see it being a refreshing summer beer. Would only recommend if your into Mexican Lagers"
"Overall I think the beer deserves a ""C" +/- good for certain occasions but by no means a regular in my rotation"
"When choosing a Mexican beer, this is the one to go to. The reason is probably only marketing purposed because of the ""Most interesting man in the world"" commercials. The beer itself tastes better than a Corona, so I enjoy a Dos Equis every now and then. Never have seen in on tap though..."
"Poured this bottle into a mug. Very light golden color, I have heard that this was originally created to market to those folks who consider Heineken to be top shelf. Basically another all grain lager that risks being light damaged by being in green glass. No such problem here. This fresh case sample has all the grainy flavors intact, with carbonation keeping the sweeter-floral ester notes lively. Simply easy to drink. Best enjoyed cold."
"Nothing like knocking back a nice brew with some tasty Chipotle, baby! This one pours a clear very pale straw topped by a finger of short-lived white froth. The nose comprises corn, wheat, hard water, and corn syrup. The taste doesn't deviate from this plan too far, save for a light hint of lemon spice. The body is quite light, with a lightly fizzy carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, nothing close to special, but good enough to douse the spice from the delicious steak."
"D: This is your run of the mill, bland macro lager. No flavor and no real character. That said, I've had too many of these while on the beach in Mexico to give it a low drinkability rating. The commercials are by far the most interesting part of the beer. ""If he punched you in the face, you would have to fight of a strong urge to thank him."""
"Poured into a pint glass. The color is golden with a slight white head that diminishes rapidly. The nose and taste can be described together as I don't think there's much of a difference and, frankly, there's really not much to them. There's a bit of light grain and that's about it. Some mild bitterness in the taste and feel, but even that is hard to pick out. Not a fan of this and prefer the amber version."
"Final Thoughts: So, apparently the most interesting man in the world likes one of the world's least interesting beers. Maybe that's why he doesn't always drink beer. This beer is pretty generic, but I will give it that I would certainly choose it over Corona. You'll want a squirt a lime with this one."
"I wanted to try something new. So, I asked the bartender for a bottle of Dos Equis. This beer had no body, not a whole lot of flavor, and the appearance was not memorable. My only lasting impression of this beer is that it tasted like dirty tap water. If it wasn't for the alcohol, I would not have known it was beer. However, their marketing campaign is amazing. Had it not been for those commercials, I would have never given it a try."
"The beer does have a decent body however. And the carbonation is also nice, the beer feels nice and a bit spicy on the tongue. Drinkability is good as long as you have a burrito or a couple of Chile Rellenos"
"Summary: This is an above average beer. I gave it a 7.4/10, or a C. This was my favorite beer when I was younger, but having expanded my palate, I've learned there are much better brews out there. Behind all the hype and advertising this really is not the most interesting beer in the world. Don't get me wrong there's nothing bad about this beer, but really there's nothing great either, except drinkability. I still drink it fairly often because it's served commonly at restaurants that only serve light beer. But even by itself I would still drink it again, if not for old time's sake."
"mouthfeel average for the style. not much to be said here. this is a reasonable mexican brew. i think it's much better than a Corona or Sol for sure... but maybe that's just because i finally had a mexican beer that isn't skunked..."
"I can't believe this cost me $.50 more than 6-pack of SA Boston Lager, and almost $2.00 more than the Deschutes Inversion! They must really be on to something with that marketing campaign."
"Sorry, this beer rates just below your run of the mill domestic mass produced brew that most of America beer drinkers find as normal beer. The head of one finger dissipated about as fast as it appeared, leaving nothing. The color is that of my morning ""dew"". Rating a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. The smell is very light and that of what I remember walking out in the barnyard in the morning as a child. The taste is about one step above water, some corn and malt, but nothing else. No mouth feel, no body, no zing, no pop. Maybe this is just a bad bottle. I am sorry to say, I will try to avoid this unless I must drink it to not hurt somebody's feelings."
"Quite a nice average beer. I can tell you if people are passing around Dos Equis, Coronas, Bud Lights and a slew of other mass-produced beers...more than likely I'll be grabbing the Dos Equis."
"Drinkability: While it doesn't blow my mind, I could see myself drinking several of these if nothing else was available, despite its lack of character. In its defense though, it is a slightly better option to some other Mexican beers (Tecate, Corona, etc.)."
"Something different but not in a good way. May drink if it is the only thing available, yet again I think water may beat this one in my book"
"Drinks best if ice cold."
"D- Easy to drink, very light and watery."
"Sweet and watery with tiny touch of noble hops on the finish. Slightly cloying but mostly inoffensive. Drinkable by the pool on a hot day. Yadda yadda yadda."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a pale golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, slightly sweet. Taste is crisp, light, a touch of sweetness and finishing a tad bitter. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a mediocre beer."
"Easy drinking but not great. Had worse."
"Pours a somewhat clear and bright golden straw color with full cap of frothy white head, disipating quickly into nothing with little lacing. Scent is pale, touched of straw and grass with hints of steamed veggies. Taste is suprisingly cereal sweet and also straw and grass with hints of mustyness and cooked veggies. Light bodied, overly carbonated. An adjunct lager that does not distinguish itself but atleast has some qualities of fresh ingredients."
"D - Considering what it is, its not horrible, but I would never go out and buy this from a store."
"The name and marketing definitely causes this beer to be overrated. Despite this, the beer is pretty enjoyable. It kind of tastes like a lower quality modelo's. The beer definitely has a crisp taste, but nothing that i distinguishably remember after having a six pack"
"D - There is nothing particularly offensive about this one, so it would be a better selection than light lagers for hot weather."
"Again a little bit different here, and there was a bit more of a flavor profile, but still, nothing terribly shocking here."
"Not much going on here though it's better than some of the similar ilk I've tried. Still, it isn't a go to beer ever for me."
"D: on the good side, this is ultra drinkable ! no ABV bite, have at em! if you care to."
"RJT"
"d- gulpable for sure, just cause it's so light. this is a refreshing summer drink, but not one i would seek out by any means. i would drink this again in the summer when not much else was available."
"To me this is a ""chips and salsa at a little Mexican dive restaurant"" session beer."
"D- Once you get past the skunkiness, you realize this a decent Mexican lager that goes well with Mexican food. You can do worse, but you can also do better. Personally, I prefer Dos Amber or Negra Modelo."
"Taste is actually pretty decent per style. Some grain and sweetness. A decent body, med/high carb. I'd drink it if it was there but I would not buy this beer."
"Pours a crystal clear golden color with a small faint head which gives way to no lacing. The aroma is corn up front with a little bit of a hop presence. The taste has a corn backbone with hints of hop presence. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall the drinkability is okay, for an american adjunct it is good, as it has some flavor, however, there is nothing to leave you dying for another."
"D: Definitely not the most interesting beer in the world. It does manage to be clean and refreshing though. To me, it drinks like a slightly cleaned-up version of Rolling Rock. Take that for what it's worth."
"This beer has a similar taste to most other Pilsner Style lagers like budweiser, corona, miller, coors light. Pours a transparent yellow, with a not to impressive head that dissipates rather quickly. Has a crisp, sharp taste with moderate carbonation. Not a terrible beer but not one that I would pay for again."
"M/D: The bubbles that form when poured don't really hit you on the mouthfeel. Its an easy drinking Mexican beer. It does the job, and with so few options in Mexico, it is better than most. Plus, the most interesting man drinks it."
"Overall - Too much of an apple juice and corn syrup sweetness. There are lots of better options in the adjunct category."
"Overall, too much hype and this beer did not nearly live up to it. I was kind of disappointed because Dos Equis is constantly advertised on television and I thought it would be the real deal. I probably won't have another."
"Serving type: bottle"
"This one was free... Served from bottle into a Blue Ridge standard pint. Pours golden yellow with one finger white head when poured AGGRESSIVELY that subsides to none almost instantly. There was no apparent lacing present throughout. The aroma was comprised of only citrus. The flavor was of wheat and water. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this brew was very bland in all aspects. In my opinion, 'The Most Interesting Man in the World' needs to find himself a new brew to drink. I'm just glad it was free..."
"Crystal clear pale yellow with a bright white cap that settled to a thick collar of soapy bubbles and a thin skim of fine bubbles. Sticky, streaky lacing. Cereal grain in the aroma, dry biscuit powder, corn, and faint sulfury hops. The taste up front is very much like the aroma, but this disappeared quickly and was replaced by hop bitterness that was low to moderate yet still felt sharp, as well as a metallic/steely finish. Cooked veggies too. Light bodied and dry, average carbonation. About what I expected, but I always hope to be pleasantly surprised."
"This beer reminds me greatly of Sol, corona, and modelo. I wouldn't be surprised if all mexican beer came from the same place... Dirty t-shirts squeezed out into a horse trough and then 'pasteurized' by the horse before making its way into the bottle, but hey what do I know about cervezas."
"Overall: The body of the beer is light and the finish is light also. There's really no distinction in the beer. It's just an okay AAL."
"Complete powdered extract dreck."
"Fine for a drink on a hot deck or with a meal. Wouldn't go out and get it on purpose (after this one, that is)."
"For no reason other than those ""most interesting man in the world"" commercials are freaking hilarious. The beer itself is a pretty boring straight forward lager. Pours a light fizzy yellow with a thin head. Smell is grainy and not very appealing. Crisp, bitter, very easy drinking. Fizzy, highly carbonated mouthfeel. It has a slight aftertaste that I could do without. Overall it's not bad beer. The line ""His mother has a tatoo that reads son"" makes me laugh for about ten minutes every time I see it. Stay thirsty my friends."
"Overall this is a nice simple lager. It's not going to win any awards for it's amazing flavors, but it's better than most Mexican beers. I like this beer for chilling by the pool or if I want to get really drunk haha."
"Light flavored, almost like the Natty Light of cerveza."
" ~ Overall this is not something I recommend. White it may be a sessionable lager, there are better ones available."
"D - Meh. OK to drink cold once in a while, but not what I prefer. Pitchers were only $7.75, so that's why we got it."
"The mouthfeel is very thin, only slightly thicker than water. A fairly high level of carbonation, but not too much. This is actually pretty easy to drink, but isn't flavorful enough to make one go back for more. Drank it for Cinco de Mayo, probably won't ever buy it again."
"Very little flavor, like yellow carbonated water. I found it to be a little over carbonated. It smelled OK mainly because it didn't have much of a smell. Not malty or hoppy, I guess if you're looking for something very light tasting this is the one. I will not buy this beer again."
"D- This just means it's an easy drinker and goes great with spicy food. A good one to go to on taco night."
"Drinkability: Maybe if I had this beer as a counter to a very spicy meal or something really flavorful I might enjoy it better, but otherwise I'm not liking it nor would I reach for another. Even yesterday having one alone after mowing the yard didn't exactly do anything for me. I won't say awful (I finished both beers) but I'm not impressed."
"Drinkability: If you thrill for swill, then Dos Equis Special Lager is a good bet. Otherwise, it comes across as being bland and adjunct-y. Their Amber was tolerable, not so much with this one."
"Drinkability- Easy to drink could sit and drink it by itself but goes better with food"
"Overall: Nice beer, but not distinctively Mexican. See drinkability."
"Fruit sweet taste, maybe some corn syrup Karo brand in the batch or something. No hops. Malt, if any, was roasted on a lukewarm sidewalk. Only thing big about this beer is the carbonation and price. Blech."
"A barely adequate lager chaser for the chips and none-too-spicy salsa...better than yer average BMC, sure, mostly through its plainness, in the same way that this 'Mexican' food is better than Taco Bell."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"D: Like the other beers of the style, easy to drink, just not necessarily all that flavorful. Good for enjoying with a Mexican meal, but not something I'd sit down and drink."
"had on tap @ peppitos on chicago ave in mpls it was a pale gold/straw color with little head and some lacing the smell was wet biscuit some rice and corn with slight malts and hops in the background..all i will say is when your at a cantina and eating burritos and tacos and chips and salsa..this is a lager that fits in..will i buy this beer for the fridge..absolutely not... will i have it at a cantina again absolutely yes ..there is a place and time for this lager..and it fit in well with my dinner..not really recommended however"
"-Cheers"
"If I ever happen to have this again, Ill try to make a better review for this not too great beer."
"Overall, there are worse things to drink. I'd take this over MGD, Bud, Miller High Life, or Keystone Orig."
"I always drink beer, and when I do, I prefer not to drink Dos Equis. I'm sure this brew will taste a hell of a lot better on a beach in Mexico (as I will see next month), but on a cold day in January, it did nothing for me."
"This is not a good brew; nothing more than a macro tasting brew. Was given to me as a gift; not a recommended purchase. Lackluster in every department a person would look for in a brew. One and done."
"Tried this one right out of the bottle. No freshness date. Very little action when swirled in bottle. Green bottle with 2 X's label pretty cool. Smells like wet grass, not very pleasant aroma. Taste is very watery, really can't taste anything that resembles a lager. I have had this before with a lime so I will go against the laws of beer physics and add a lime at this time....Ok, this helps alot. This and so many watery mexican beers cannot stand alone they need limes to make them drinkable and give them some flavor. My mouth feels nothing notable when drinking this, sorry. Drinkability: I do not like this beer at all, however, I could drink it all day long, play beach volleyball, cook steaks on the grill, lay by the pool and still catch a buzz. Bottom line, this beer sucks, but I can drink it if I have too, and I do on occasion. No real flavor without a lime."
"D: not a bad beer for what it is, just doesn't stand out at all. Doesn't have a ""bad"" taste as I've had with some other beers of this quality. Is do-able for a bbq or with some mexican food."
"D - With other beers available in this category, such as Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo, One would wonder why Dos Equis would be chosen over them."
"Drinkability: It's okay. It's not the worst thing ever, but there are better beers: in general, and in the particular style."
"D- easy to throw back and something i would have for dinner in a restaurant if nothing else special was on tap. Higher than the bmc beers in my book but lower than sam adams"
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable and refreshing, but little else to offer. Does fit in well when eating out at Mexican restaurants, though."
"Multiples are very easy if you like this style but there are much better (imo) Mexican beers out there."
"Overall, in terms of style, its much better than most of the beers it competes with."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a 1 inch head that leaves some lacing. The appearance is straw yellow and clear. The aroma is of light hops with a noticable adjunct smell. It has the standard American Adjunct Lager taste, pleasant and not taxing. Light feel and moderate carbonation. Very drinkable."
"Decent mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Note to self. Never order this crap again."
"The finish is moderately balanced, with a very dry, acrid acidity and a pungent alcohol taste. Surprisingly kolschy in the mouth, but doesn't really have the body for it."
"Drinkability- Pretty high, but uninteresting. I prefer it to other adjunct lagers."
"Not a bad beer at all. Peppery flavor with a nice bite. Smells sweet with hints of citrus and grain. Pale yellow that's darker than it's Mexican counterparts. If I'm out for Mexican food, I'd order this over Corona or Tecate. Although not spectacular, they really put some work into brewing it. Not bad at all."
"D - Oh, geez, con Tamales, es muy bien!"
"Light maltiness, a bit sweet, boring on the nose, boring in the mouth, a bit too carbonated, no head off the pour, piss yellow. At least drinkability is alright. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. I'd rather be drinking the other dos equis though, the amber that is."
"It's appearance is light golden and clear; it has a woody citrus scent to it. It tastes like a bowl of soggy grains. This beer is once again, something I will drink, but only if free. I have had far worse."
"D: Goes down really smooth, I could drink a ton of these too not too heavy at all."
"Poured from bottle into a Guinness Glass (had nothing else available at that time). Poured a pale yellow colour with a half inch head that went off in a jiffy. Smelt like grain liquid with a slight malt essence. The taste was like what Kellogs flavoured water would be. Mouthfeel was thin with good amount of carbonation. I would rate this high on drinkability, good refreshing beer, definitely more body than Corona."
"D- Could easily drink a 6-pack, but not very enjoyable"
"reminds me a bit of coors light"
"And effective advertising it is. Hey, if those (brilliant) little 15 second vignettes can convince people that this beer has any story or character at all, then by god maybe this company does deserve the sale. But let's be clear about one thing: Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma is far, far better at making commercials than they are at making beer."
"I hate this beer would have to be really thirsty to have it."
"An ok beer that I would choose over other adjunct lagers but not much else."
"This beer is extremely watery feeling, slides down the throat without even the slightest retention of flavor. There is just a bit of citric and malt presence in the back of the throat. Highly carbonated and thin. This is one of my least favorite Mexican lagers, I cant think of a single other one I would pick this over."
"Clear straw and a typical fizzy head. Nose is slightly grassy with hints of lemon/citrus. Flavour is bland, with some husky grain and the bare hint of hops. Vegetal, light body with an every so slightly bitter finish. Watery. Blandest of the bland but not actively gross."
"T- Good crisp beer on this hot day. Refreshing. Better than most Mexican beers I would say. Almost has a pilsnery taste. Right beer for certain occasions."
"This beer is real good. I honestly have nothing bad to say about it. It goes down easy and tastes good to boot. One of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. I could drink them all day long and I just might if we get another really hot summer day soon. Very refreshing beer. A must try for those on a budget."
"A great beer all around. I love the taste and I can usually get it at a decent price from a store down the road. Good for parties and just relaxing around the grill. Maybe not the best beer in the world but it is far from the worst. I would personally say that it is better than Corona."
"Dos Equis Special Lager is a beer that is best drank within it's environment just like Balashi from Aruba is. Reminds me of a less skunky Heineken. The pickin' is slim in Cancun so this is my top beer choice, even over Corona."
"This beer is notable for it's purity. It has no extra chemicals that some macro beers have, chemicals that exacerbate hangovers. This beer can be overused without hangovers. However I recommend it as an excellent beer with dinner -- to enjoy in moderation."
"Overall: Wasn't a fan before, and even with the nice price, not going to have me reaching for this again until another Cinqo de Mayo promo...only the commercials with the most interesting man in the world could redeem its thinness...."
"Smooth mouthfeel pretty light and has a very dry finish making it a pretty drinkable lager in my opinion. This brew gives mexican beers hope , I was about to give up on them completely but this does the hat dance around corona , I urge you to try it, just at a bar or something , it's nothing special , but enjoyable."
"Out of the bottle, the usual adjuncty Mexican lager smell, but a bit fainter - sort of like Corona mixed with Miller Lite. Pours a light straw with maybe 2 fingers of head that quickly fizzes away to nothing - barely even any residual bubbles on top. Smell from the glass is nonexistent. Compared to the smell I noted earlier, the Miller Lite is much more evident than the Corona. It even struggles to reach that level of intensity. This is one seriously weak beer. Little flavor, little smell, little evident carbonation, some noticeable alcohol. It's entirely nonoffensive, but there is nothing whatsoever to recommend this beer."
"i bought it after drinking it constantly in mexico, one really big + that isn't rated here is 'hangover factor'... this beer, like some others i can drink way in excess and not be trashed the next day."
"Appearance is a light yellow with nill head and lace. Smell of light grass and hop. Taste...there is just not a whole lot going on although it is quite refreshing with a lot of carbonation and a light mouthfeel. A good one to try on an extremely hot day."
"The foam was yellow/white wheat in color, 1 finger length in height, bubbly and lacey. The color was a golden yellow, very carbonated with hints of mustard yellow. The smell was sweet, hoppy with a hint of wheat - pretty basic. The taste was a watered-down pils and very little hops taste. Mouthfeel - dull with a skunky metallic aftertaste. Drinkability - crisp watery session , not worth a second chance."
"Finish: Dry and with a median bitter aftertaste."
"Drinkability - Goes down easy, and I could drink one or two, but that's about it. Mildly refreshing."
"Comes out of the tap a clear amber-yellow with a rather typical white head. Aroma is crisp, strong and malty; I picked up a whiff of lime but this probably came from the obligatory lime wedge on the glass. Flavor is crisp, malty and just a little yeasty. The lively and fizzy texture leaves a slightly yeasty finish."
"I thought this an OK lager, some depth to its mouthfeel and one of the better beers to come out of Mexico (that get to the UK anyway)."
"On tap. Fizzy yellow wuss beer. Slimy head of white froth. Aroma is just about nonexistent, maybe some corn, paper, and pale malt. Flavor is extremely watery with little substance but adjunct sweetness with a little mineral note. Good for washing down Mexican food, not good for anything else."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. The head dissipates very quickly and leaves no trace. The nose is what I expected, oat soda-esque. The taste is non obtrusive and it has a nice mellow drinkability. Probably nice with spicy mexican food. Not a beer I would seek out, but may order at a mexican resturaunt."
"D - Easy drinking - you could nail a dozen of these at a mexican restaurant. abv is beyond manageable. Flavors don't wear, easy drinking. Not filling."
"Very pale yellow colored beer with a quickly fading head.Aroma and taste are your normal Mexican macros except a bit lighter.Overall this is an easy drinking that goes down smooth.Perfect for a hot day or a Mexican dinner.I would recommend to try at least once would purchase again myself."
"Drinkability: I had this on a cruise and you could do worse there. Pretty average for the style. Nothing bad about the beer. Nothing great either."
"D: Easy to drink because of its body, not its taste. Not a fan of this beer. wouldn't even think of buy it again. Maybe it would be more refreshing if I was in a desert about to die of thirst, but not today. If the ""most interesting man in the world"" drinks this, he must not be interested in drinking good beer. Glad it was over when i finished."
"D: Very easy to drink, my third favorite beer to accompany seafood."
"I could drink a few of these, but only if nothing else was available...not impressed."
"As mediocre as the can version, no noticeable difference."
"Because I'm probably insane, I've been trying all of the Mexican beers that are readily available at the Mexican restaurants in Denver. Dos Equis XX is my next to last stop on the trip. One more to go before I return to a steady diet of Bohemia and Negra Modelo with my enchiladas."
"Had last night at dinner last night with dinner at a Mexican restaurant. Poured a pale yellow with no head or lacing. Smell was relatively non-descript and consisted primarily of corn. Taste was simply average. Nothing really jumped out. Like the smell, it is mainly corn. Watery mouthfeel. Good drinkability. Good for a bar-b-que."
"This is my choice when I want to drink a flavorful beer in a hot atmosphere without being overwhelmed by the weight of the beer (BBQ, poolside, after yard work). However this is not my first choice when I seek out a beer based on taste."
"One of the better adjunct lagers I've had, but that aint saying much. Pours a really pale, clear, yellow, with fizzy fluffy head. No retention or lacing. Smell has a slight grain and cereal smell. Taste is pretty bland but I swear a light kiss of lemon perhaps, though there isnt much there I swear there was a slight sweetness. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Easy drinker. About the only reason I'm reviewing this is to say this: This may be the best beer to pair with fish tacos! A 6 pack of this was on sale for $4 so I picked it up, had a couple, then the next day had a couple with fish tacos and it was a perfect compliment!"
"Pretty ho hum beer, but I wasn't expecting much beyond that. I had this years ago in the plaza in very hot, humid, sticky Veracruz, Mexico where anything cold is a welcomed relief from the thick, stale, stagnant overheated air, even at night. This was awesome in those conditions. In a more contemplative, relaxed setting this beer is just another adjunct beer from Mexico. It's refreshing, very light, clear as crystal, yellowy pale, no head, not much lacing. What did you expect. The nose is cooked veggies with the musty cardboard lagery smell that is common with the style. There is a slight maltiness in there too and maybe a slight earthy note as well. The taste is very bland, eminently drinkable, light, light, light. There is very little taste beyond some cooked veggie, some light malts, some adjunct sweetener. There is very little mouthfeel and almost no aftertaste, save for a touch of grassiness. If you're looking for taste, forget it. If you want a carbonated beverage in a sticky, oppressively humid environment, such as the Caribbean coast of Mexico in July, this is your beer everytime."
"Very drinkable beer because of it's thin character."
"Poured a fizzy straw yellow from the bottle with an eighth-inch of fizzy white head that quickly disappeared. I smell a hint of corn syrup and taste almost nothing. Reminds me of mineral-y tap water steeped with some canned corn. Mouthfeel is similarly devoid of any recognizable characteristics, which I guess isn't quite as bad in this style. In light of its utter blandness, I guess I can't really dock this in the drinkability category either."
"D- Not bad for the Macro style."
"Average. You won't be too impressed with this but if you like your beers to be easy to drink and hardly special, then this is for you. Otherwise, I'd avoid it."
"D= As fortune had it, I had this beer from a bottle just a couple hours after having it on tap. Its the ubiquitous beer in Cozumel. Pretty drinkable for the style, and certainly better than Corona or anything brewed by Miller for that matter."
"Its a fairly good beer, i am a big fan. I am big on drinkability and smoothness, and dont like very flavorful beers, which is why i am such a fan. Most people dont really like such easy drinking beers, so its understandable for the less then stellar review. But it looks good, as a nice light golden pour, and has a nice kind of nutty smell to it. It goes down smooth and tastes good. If you like easy drinkers, this is easily of the top."
"Atmosphere, not really. . . Light subdued flavor, although not offensive. The same with the feel. Serviceably refreshing quaff."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a diminutive white head that disappears immediately to leave an anemic-looking collar. Smells very faintly of grainy malt and nothing else (though thankfully, that includes skunk). Taste is quite similar in its malt/adjunct mediocrity. Slightly crisp at least. Decent carbonation gives it a weak Perrier feel. Drinkable, but there's a complete lack of flavor and character."
"Easy drinker, mild carbonation, slightly sweet finish. Would be fine with a Mexiacan meal. No bad qualities."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a wheat colored yellow with a thin white head that quickly sank back into the brew leaving no lacing, nor any cap to speak of. The aroma was of corn, some light hops, and a little alcohol. The taste was thin and full of carbonation. I am not reviewing this with a lime (as I would usually drink) which would cut into the carbonation and add some flavor to this seemingly dull brew. Macro all the way. Could drink with a spicy Mexican meal to cut the heat, but other than that just another Mexican import falling flat."
"Poures a very light, clear yellow with a fizzy white head that was very quickly.Aroma is slightly skunky,some corn,and a hint of floral hops. It's very thin and watery. There is very little flavor, just a sweetish starch and some slight skunkiness. Overall, it's a little better than some macros, but not by much."
"D- Quick and easy to turn the glass like most Mexican beers"
"Don't drink and review."
"As in my Pacifico review, this blurb is not meant to glorify this beer. I will enjoy an ice-cold Dos XX on a hot day, and I will not feel guilty about it. Pours clear and bubbly gold with a puffy white head. Sweet rice and corn aroma with a helping of grassy hops. Taste is the same, only very smooth and not as watery as one would expect."
"After about 3/4 of the 32oz mug, I was ready to leave it at the table. But I paid for it, so I drank it."
"Another thing that's interesting about this beer is the fact that it comes in a green bottle, and there's no skunky aroma or flavor. Impressive!"
"Well.. it ain't terrible. I would compare it to a Corona with more body and a better mouthfeel to it. This makes it not a great beer, but leaps and bounds ahead of the more popular Corona.. damn media advertising. Anywho, just a pale rice-y skunky beer, best on a hot day. If you're gonna go Mexican themed, this or Negra Modelo would be solid choices."
"Overall: ""I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Stone IPA bitch."" Most Interesting Man in the World."
"Overall its a great beer for what it is, defiantly better than Corona. Highly recommended!"
"Pours a light yellow, with a very thin white head. Not much smell to speak of, and the taste resembles the smell. It is pretty thin, so drinkability loses points as well. Not awful, but not worth the extra money (if in the US). It is pretty good for free, but I have had better Mexican beers."
"Overall: I'm not sure why the ratings are so low on this one but I personally love it. Would recommend."
"D: This is yet another wholly ordinary macrobrew. It's not as offensive as as other beers of its ilk, but still not very good."
"Drinkability is decent. It goes down really well, is easy to drink, doesn't have any lingering negative aftertastes, but the fact that its so plain makes me think theres much better out there I could be spending my time drinking."
"Not a bad beer, but overpriced for what it is."
"Had with dinner tonight. Not too impressed with the appearance: very watery-looking with a pale yellow tone, but to be fair, some decent lacing. Aromas were weak and pretty sour from what I could sense. Sour flavor in general; not too tasty or appetizing. Very, very watery, which ended up being a good thing: it was much easier to wash it down quickly. Overall, would not really recommend."
"Not too big of a fan of this one. Very pale and overpriced for something that tastes like every other lager out there. (maybe this one has a bit more flavor). Kinda bitter too. I can appreciate a good tasting bitterness, this just seemed a little bit out of place. Alright to have with a meal but on it's own doesn't do to well. -Dale"
"Honestly this is one of my favorite beers out there. I've always enjoyed Dos Equis Special and Amber, but I prefer this. It's a very smooth beer that compliments a lime wedge perfectly, unlike Corona, which just tastes like a funky mess. It goes down very well and i find it to be very drinkable. I'm sure a lot of people may find it a tad bit bland or boring, but as far as a Mexican brew, I have a tough time beating this. Nothing beats a Dos Equis and a burrito."
"Green glass longneck poured into a Harpoon Raspberry UFO glass. Cryptic notation stamped on the bottle does not give any indication of bottling or freshness dates. Crystal clear light golden in the glass with a dying white head that tries to hang on to no avail. Aroma contains powdered sugar, cornbread, husk, and corn syrup - not very pleasing. Flavor starts with a corn syrup sweetness - almost like sweet corn in liquid form - drying up and maintaining a clean profile through mid-palate and then finishes with slight bitterness and mild grainy finish. Feel starts off a bit heavy on the tongue and then crisps up as high carbonation exploded in the mouth into a light body - very prickly. The overall lightness of this beer makes it very approachable to drink, but the corn sweetness gets in the way of my enjoyment of it. A good accompanyment to spicy foods, but for sessioning on its own, I am definately looking for something with some flavor."
"D: Drinkability was less then average, rather bland with little incentive to continue. Overall a weak, watery flavored macro style lager that gets easily lost in the crowd."
"This is a complete waste of money for $7.50 a 6 pack. If I'm going to drink a lager, I'd MUCH rather have something cheaper like yuengling, high life, etc."
"A clearish, pale yellow with immense carbonation to start for a huge head; quickly dies down and nothing happens. A rather skunky aroma with big whiffs of stuff like corn, rice and other veggies. Sharp and cutting, there is some sweetness on the backend that is a change of pace from the biting hops and lackluster feel most of these beers give. Even though it is light-bodied and a weak taste, I'll take this over other major Mexican/Latin American imports and some American macros anyday."
"Pretty good for a Mexican beer. Light colored topped with a thin head. Slightly hoppy with some citrus notes. Light-bodied and easy to drink a lot of these although it could use a little more flavor. Nothing foul about it though so I'd drink it again."
"Bright white head that looks great until it quickly dissipates into the light golden lager. Slightly stale aroma of corn/grain and barely detectable hops. Taste is centered on beautiful notes of...water. Uneventful to say the least. Mouth feel is very thin, but enough carbonation to give a certain crispness. I have this beer on-tap in my garage, and although sub-par overall by most standards, it serves its purpose for endless games of flip-cup."
"D: A nice beer to go with Mexican food, though I'd probably get bored with it if I was drinking alone."
"Of note, this is probably the only Mexican beer that I know of that hints at the skunky green glass of Ballentines, et al. But not quite as strong in this smell."
"Not so much a beer as a carefully engineered marketing product meant to take share away from Corona. Oh, and their tagline ""I don't always drink beer, but when I do I drink Dos Equis.""? Bugger off."
"MF&D - Typical macro. Good with Mexican food, but not really anything else. Definatly not worth the import price tag. I'm not an advocate for putting anything in beer, but this is one thats better with lime."
"This was a pretty easy drinker. Even though there wasn't anything that stood out, this was a pretty tasty beer. Although, I'm not sure if i would pay the higher price for a case."
"D - Not very flavorful but drinkable. Goes great with some spicy Mexican salsa."
"Deep corn and balanced malt on the nose. More depth than Corona/Sol/Pacifico, but nothing special. Taste is a bit richer as well with a slight oily feel on the tongue. Finish is average with moderate carbonation. Not bad but comes at a decent price premium to Sol. I'd reach for the Sol Brava next time."
"The mouthfeel is light, crisp, and refreshing. Overall, there is definitely nothing special about this beer. Certainly overpriced. If this is what I'm thirsty for, I'd go with a cheaper macro lager."
"I only ever drink this beer when we dine at our favorite Mexican restaurant. They have a limited beer menu and not being a fan of Corona my choices are limited to this, Heineken and Negro Modelo. I tried the Negro and it was a little to dark (hence the name) for my liking. I could suffer through a Heineken but I figure since I'm eating Mexican why not drink Mexican too... I actually don't find Dos XX lager too bad to drink, they also offer the Dos XX in the brown bottle but I have always preferred the lager. I usually drink it from the bottle since I am never offered a glass. For the first time last night they gave me a glass with the beer so I poured it. It does pour extremely light, almost looks like cream soda. What minuscule head existed after my pour quickly dissipated. Again for one reason or another the hops in this beer taste amazingly sweet when paired with spicy Mexican food. Having never drank the beer outside of the restaurant I can't say how well it goes on its own. When I'm eating Mexican this beer always hits the spot."
"Nothing above and beyond for sure, but makes for a good, inexpensive social beer..."
"D- It's alright. Better than a lot of american macro lagers."
"I've had several Mexican beers, and this is probably the best one of them all. Still bland, but very drinkable. When I go out to my favorite eatery, I reach for this one"
"D - A halfway decent alternative to the much-despised Corona, but do yourself a favor and find some Indio or Negra Modelo."
"with so many better macro Mexican beers available there is no reason to have XX"
"Overall an easy drinking beer , nothing unpleasant, nothing noteworthy."
"Nice amber lager with a small white head. Smelled slightly malty with a sense of hops. Tasted same way, but the hops were more noticeable. Served with a lime that nicely complimented the malty aftertaste. Mouthfeel was kind of thick but not overbearing. Would definitely have again."
"d: Easy to put down, easier to get bored with. A step above some of the other Mexican mass-produced crap, but its a pretty small step. In the right setting and for the right price I will drink it again, but I will never seek it out."
"Body is light and surprising quaffable. Only on Cinco de Mayo."
"This brew probably goes over at trendier Mexican-themed bars and restaurants, just to offer something to people who scoff at Corona, but still want that ""authentic"" Mexican experience. Go for a Negra Modelo instead, if they've got it."
"Clear yellow and tan head. Aroma is corny and simple and very light. Appearance is a clear yellow with no head. Flavor is very light as well and has some bitter components. Mouthfeel is light bodied and has a harsh carbonation. Overall, I'm not too impressed, its drinkable but not very. Like most other Mexican beers it needs a lime. Even with a lime, not so good."
"M/D - Thin feel. If it is ice cold it is a decent drinking macro lager."
"Notes: I was very dissapointed in this beer. I had one in the past I am sure but I was looking forward to tasting/rating it for BA."
"Actually, I do drink beer always. Dos Equis Lager isn't the worst Mexican beer - in fact it's much better than your Tecates and Coronas. Still no reason to go far for this one."
"I did not enjoy this beer this time. I actually thought about not finishing it... which is rare for me."
"Very pale golden color with a fairly big white head. Aroma is diluted malt with definite corn present. On the palate it is light both in body and flavor, but crisp and went well with the Mexican food. Not a real flavorful beer, but goes down really easy."
"D- Good for a Mexican beer. Take that as you will. Good for macro lager. A good match at a Mexican restaurant. Not horrible, not great."
"This beer poured yellow with very little head. The smell was mostly of grain with maybe a little bit of of corn. The taste is thin malt with a very small amount of hops, very fitting of the style. The mouthfeel is fairly thin with a moderate amount of carbonation. The things this beer excels in are drinkability and putting out the fire of spicy foods. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who isn't looking for a good Mexican drunk or eating a burrito the size of their head with very hot sauce."
"This beer isn't bad, its just not fulfilling, and its expensive by that rationale."
"I've only had three Mexican beers, and this was the middle one. Not the best and not the worst, just average."
"Drink Dos Equis Amber instead!"
"Smells decent. light malty, corn tastes at first, but then a slight malty, skunky taste, and a relatively quick finish. Definitely better with lime, to give it actual pleasant flavor. Not great, but a good easy enough beer to drink by the pool. A decent choice when there aren't many..."
"D: Pretty drinkable, as long as there's nothing better around."
"D: This is my ""cheap"" party beer. It's very drinkable and goes down quickly."
"Poured into a pint glass and got a small one finger head that was pretty white and didnt last long, after a few moments its practically non-existent. The body is a very clear light yellow and has little carbonation and very thin lacing. This smells like your typical Mexican beer very light skunked aroma but its not skunked at all and there is a slight hint of malts in there. It does have a strong crisp bitterness to it and has a very thin feel but it not offensive at all just no real flavor."
"D = I'd say this is average. If you don't like the style then it would be lower, but it is a perfectly straightforwad American Macro Lager which is refreshing."
"Perhaps a slight step above Corona, Miller, and other of its ilk."
"I had a pint of Dos Equis at a very good local Mexican restaurant with shrimp stir fry. The stir fry was very good; the Dos Equis, just OK. There was little head atop the clear golden body, and what there was didn't last long. Little confronts the nose, some mild hops, same with the taste. The carbonation was decent and the texture smooth, and it was a mild beverage to accompany dinner. Yet it wasn't nearly as good as I remembered. Not one I'll request, certainly not the next time I'm at that establishment."
"To me this tastes like another typical mexican light beer. Not bad but nothing to really rave about."
"Pours a nice yellow with a short white head. It has a sweet aroma of sweet corn and some light hops. The taste is not that impressive. It tastes kind of sweet malts and light hops. It is pretty carbonated and since it doesn't have much taste it is fairly drinkable. Good mouthfeel, but not that great an overall beer. I wouldn't recommend it."
"This is one of my wife's standards. It's good enough to steal one out of the back of the fridge if the need arises, but that's about it. It's kinda pricey, too, which I've never understood."
"Poured a very light straw color with a thin head. The smell was pretty weak with a hint of corn to it. To me it had a good favor my favorite of Mexican brews but it could use a lime to sweeten it up a little. It had a medium carbonation and was fairly smooth in my mouth. As I said this is my favorite Mexican brew it could use a lime and with it its a very enjoyable beer if your out having fun and not thinking too much about the taste."
"Really weak. Better than Corona is about the best I can say."
"Pours a pale golden color with very little head, even pouring into the middle of the glass, though what is there sticks around for a while and laces the glass. Smells a little floral, but mostly very clean. The taste is also very clean. Not much sweetness, not much bitterness, no malt or hops detected. No flavor at all, really. Mouthfeel is pretty watery, with a little tingliness on the tongue, much like soda water. Overall, it's drinkable, but so is water. I was hoping for beer."
"Could drink a good amount of these if desired"
"Drinkability: One of the best mexican lagers i have drink, not to compare with the amber one."
"But am I looking forward to getting home to my beer fridge."
"D: Just okay, and I know its wrong but the limón and la sal go into this one. Served extremely cold with my flavorings and drank in the hot summer sun it makes a good day. Go with the Amber instead!"
"Overall, it was not as bad as I had thought it would be, but I'm still wondering what makes this Dos Equis ""special""?"
"I thought this would be cool refreshing beverage to go with my mid-day meal, but I'll stick with a good old hefe instead."
"I recently vacationed in Mexico, and while most of the Mexican beers I drank tasted much better than they do in the US, this one actually tasted worse. Aroma was virtually non-existent. Mouthfeel was highly (unpleasantly) carbonated and flavor was corny and metallic."
"D- not a great beer, but it is drinkable, i would choose it over corona anyday."
"From the bottle the head was not too bad. Kind of a pale yellow/off gold color. Smelled a little hint of ""skunkiness", but not bad. Couldn't place the rest...overdone? Taste really isn't all that bad. Crisp & fresher than the smell and had some body with a pleasant aftertaste that doesn't stay too long. If you want to drink beer all day this would do fine. Not a great beer at all, but not bad."
"giblet"
"Overall: brisk and refreshing, but without character and no personality at all. Better than Sol and Corona (no compliment there!) but still bland. My quest for a good Mexican beer continues."
"Not as good as its Amber brother, but not bad for a mass-produced Mexican beer. As with most of these, its best enjoyed ice-cold, with a squeeze of lime, while eating chorizo sausage or other Mexican spicy dishes. Actually prefer this over many of the BMC's, which isn't saying much."
"Dos Equis Lager Especial was golden in color and very clear. It had a white head that didn't last. The smell was light and mostly grain with a little skunk. The taste was sweet, grainy and a little harsh with a dry finish. It was light bodied with medium carbonantion. Drinkability was below average. The Dos Equis Amber was a much better beer than this one was."
"Pours like any Euro Lager- clean and pale. The Aroma was dominated by the adjuncts- very bready and grainy. Tasted well.... like a MGD; adjunct rich, hints of cooked corn, maybe a little hop bitterness. What a disappointment. If I wanted a MGD, I would have bought MGD and saved myself a few bucks."
"A good party beer if everyone is tired of the normal cheap beers as it has a slight better taste than the 'average' beer."
"Served in a mason jar, this beer had a faint gold, mostly yellow appearance, with only a few suds on top due to the streaming carbonation coming up from the bottom. Reviewing it in the style it is made, its not a bad beer overall, compared to its competitors. The smell is faint grain combined with alcohol, basically the same aroma you get from other macros that aren't skunked. The taste was very faint malt, alcohol, but not too much of a carbonated bite, which is why I rate the mouthfeel at a little bit better than average. Not a horrible beer, it had slightly more sustenance than its competitors."
"Picked up at Costco in a Mexican beer sample case of Sol, Dos Equis Lager, Dos Equis Amber, and Tecate. They were out of Sam's brewmaster collection so I gave this a whirl. Bottle smell is a strange braunschweiger. Poured into my chalice with little to no head. Color is golden with a bronze hint. There is now a slight corn smell. Taste is quite bland, not sweet not bitter, almost without flavor, only a slight hop finish. The carbonation is evident and actually more prevalent than anything else. This is definitely only a lawnmower beer. Nothing at all to brag about here. Maybe this is a bad bottle for some reason. If trying another improves I will return to edit this review."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and it goes down easy. But, like most macros, it doesn't taste good. One is about all I can handle. It's not enticing enough for another. Overall, it's not a good beer. I wouldn't recommend it."
"All in all an OK mexican beer. I pair this beer with stuffed jalopanos and the hottest mexican fare. It quenches the thirst and is much better than Carona."
"Typical pale gold with little head. Malt overdoes the grain in the nose and has a pinch of hop. Taste goes downhill from the aromas and is just selztery. Flavors start off decent but then plummet into nothingness pretty quickly. Mouthfeel is thin and spritzy. I can down this alright."
"d - easily drunk and not bad overall. much better than corona, sol, pacifico and others of its ilk."
"Pours a crystal clear pale yellow. Thin white head is gone in seconds. Aroma is light caramel, grain, and a hint of grassy hops. Taste is sweet and grainy up front, with a mild grassy bitterness in the finish. Medium body. Not much more to say. One you will not sit and ponder, but a solid beer on a hot summer day."
"Taste is barely a notch above the macrobrewed american junk: metallic, some rice and hop notes present. The mouthfeel is the highlight of this beer. Surprisingly hoppy aftertaste, with a nice juciness and smooth finish. Overall, it lacks any noticable complexity, but you can drink it all night. Goes down easily."
"D: Easy to drink, not very filling, it went well with my quesadilla but the beer itself was not very tasty."
"In my humble opinion, this is the best American Macro around. Appearance is kinda flat, but the smell picks it up. Much sharper than most macros and no corn smell. Taste is similar to a euro pale. Mouthfeel is light but decent. Drinkability is fantastic."
"A fair to average Mexican lager. A bit spicer than some others, but it's also a bit more tedious than some others. The Dos Equis amber is much better."
"I would recommend this beer to those who prefer a Heineken style finish. Not as good as on draft! Add a lime at the bottom of a glass then pour in and enjoy for a twist."
"Overall: Decent for Tex-Mex fare when nothing better is available; its agreeable though neutral. Definitely benefits from a frosty mug and a lime."
"Overall it's a pretty average beer, better than corona in my opinion but a little over priced"
"I don't know if its the water or what but all mexican beers have that skunkiness to them and this is no exception. No lime required on this one, it's not as skunky as corona, I actually prefer xx over it. Corn adjucts present, a little more flavorful than other mex beers. Not too bad, at the price though i'll pass."
"The head wasn't impressive in the bottle, and it would dissapear quick after each sip. There was nothing wrong with taste, it started with a corn-like sweetness and ended in cooked veggies with a mild spicy hoppiness, though not overpowering. Despite being a middle-of-the-road brew, it was easy to drink and cut the spiciness on my palate from the burrito."
"I've definately had worse macros, especially in green bottles or from Mexico. This one can be filed under, clean and unoffensive. Like Heineken, but with a little less flavor. It was just sweet with a faint taste of adjuncts. A lime doesnt really ruin this one or cover up flavor so much as improve upon a nearly blank slate of a beer."
"Although it lacks in the flavor department, is watered-down and overly husky, it's not the worst Mexican beer I've had. But, that's not saying much. In fact, it says virtually nothing. In fact, I would prefer some American macros if I had to over this. Beats Corona and some other Mexican beers I've had, but still is not worth-while, even for the style."
"this is probably the best of the mexican beers i have tried.no need to salt the mug and stick a lime in this one.a pale amber in appearance.light head and moderate lacing down the glass.this isnt a bad session beer.best enjoyed buy the bucket outside when south of the border."
"This is one of the few beers I would actually drink in the future but include the limes in. It does a nice job of going with chips and salsa as well as tex-mex food. Nothing complex, not the best flavor, but still a good thirst quencher and goes down easy with food."
"Poured into a big ol mug. Dark yellow, decent head. Smell is not very strong. Taste is good, mouthfeel is quite good. Overall it's really an average beer in my opinion. Nothing really bad about it, it's just so average to me. I wouldn't mind having it again."
"This beer poured a clear straw color with a nice head. It had a hoppy, sweet smell. The taste is clean and crisp and slightly salty. The mouthfeel is thin. This is one of those that is drinkable very cold on a hot day - this is very average beer but quenching."
"¡Orale!"
"This is really a situational beer only for me. I only drink it when I'm eating Mexican food, as it complements perfectly. It does not stand well on it's own though, so I will score it accordingly. Drinkability is top notch."
"A thin yellow beer with crazy soda carbonation, not much smell, and a very thin grain taste with bitter bite and prominant booziness. Mothfeel is prettymuch like watery soda. Definately at the bottom of my list for Mexican lager. Move along folks, nothing to see here."
"Dos Equis falls into the third camp. The taste starts off with hops, which were all but absent in the aroma, and finishes with a grainy sweetness. No es nada especial, but it's not so bad."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y"
"D- It is like german lager with corn adjuncts. On the high end of mexican beers which doesn't say much but this beer is actually not bad. I tend to lean torward this if given the choice between Macros. Smooths out spicy food, so it does have that going for it."
"Good beer to wash tacos down with. Saludas!"
"This is about your best bet for a decent beer when eating at most Mexican restaurants(or maybe Negor Modelo). Pours a pale yellow with low carbonation and lacing. Smell is not unlike the tortilla chips, moderately corny. The taste is very mild with corn dominating all flavors and a crisp finish. Mouthfeel is thin but what one would expect in this style beer. This a very smooth drinker that is not overly heavy on the stomach. A good bet for warm weather during outdoor activities."
"Dos Equis Special Lager pours yellow with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. Smell is corn, maybe corn husk. Tastes like adjunct, especially corn and cereal. This wouldn't be a bad one to throw a wedge of lime into and drink on a hot day (review is no lime). No reason to recommend this beer."
"Appearance is pretty boring. Light yellow, golden color with small white head that leaves very little to no lacing. Smell is grainy. Taste is grainy, watery and a bit of a sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is watery. This beer is light on taste as is typical with Macro's while this earns it little points in the taste department it does make it fairly drinkable. Overall a typical Mexican American Macro Lager. I think Mexican breweries should stick to the Vienna Larger style."
"D - Decent drinkability if you are looking to wash some nasty nachos down at the cheesy hotel happy hour on the beach, other than that, I can't recommend this."
"Drinks okay if you like oversweet lagers. Would go okay with some firery foods, but dissapoints on its own. I remember this being better, maybe memory is playing tricks..."
"I guess this is the type of beer to drink with some flame-throwing Mexican dish, because there isn't much taste. It's a yellow beer with a small white head. It had a mildly floral aroma, and that is about all you'll get from it. I couldn't taste much of anything, very insipid. Drink it if you must with some spicy dish, otherwise leave it alone."
"Drinkability is good for what this is, which is a Mexican Lager, and the best of the Mexican's I've had. Drink XX with a big plate of Tex-Mex enchiladas and it's the perfect compliment."
"Poured a clear amber body with a fairly insignificant head. The head disappeared quite quickly. Smelled okay if a bit bland. Some hops in the taste, no malts, hint of caramel. Mouthfeel was syrupy. Average."
"¡Salud!"
"Overall an average beer when drinking it alone, but with food, this beer is magnificent. It's obvious that you don't want a beer so flavorful and strong with a full meal that it overpowers the food you're eating, and while Dos Equis does have some flavors, it maintains itself subservient to the meal you eat, which is why I rated it better than some. One must look at the common intended use for the beer before one attacks it on characteristics reserved for beers meant to be drank alone."
"dos equis is a notch above most of the other big name mexican beers that i've had. but that's not a large notch. pale, thin, almost flavorless. this beer gives the advertisement of being a thirst quenching summer fav, but it gets old after a while. i didn't really detect much of a nose from it, other than the dry carbonation and a bit of hop masked corn. tastes kind of skunky, but i think in this case that is a bit of a good thing. there isn't much else going for it. again, this beer feels typical of most large pils/lager styles. the only way i would recommend this beer is to grab a twelve pack, grab your beach gear and go get drunk in the sun."
"Dos Equis Special is a poor man's Dos Equis Amber. That's probably an unfair comparison since the latter is a Vienna lager and almost certainly contains higher quality ingredients. Other than color, the bottles and labels are identical, so make sure to buy the average one (Amber) rather than the lousy one (Special). Better yet, grab a sixer of Bohemia instead. You're welcome."
"A refreshing lager, enjoyed best on the beach with a slice of lime. But then again all beer tastes better when your in the sun on the beach While a lime is not required it does enhance the flavor of the beer. It is because of its smooth, sweet taste, or maybe the lime just goes with the green bottle. I wouldnt recommend a lime with the Amber verison of Dos XX."
"Cheers to Mexico !"
"A standard beach-beer. Why are there no good beers sold at the beach? Anyhow, this one, albeit grainy and bite-ey has a cleanliness and crispness with it. Sweetness is low in the aromas and flavors. Again, the malt profile included adjunct grains and contribute a vegetable flavor. Flavors fade leaving a light medicinal flavor remaining. More bite-ey toward the finish. A little dry. Still a thirst quincher, but not for serious beer tasting."
"One good attribute of this beer would be it's drinkability on a warm summer day. If you want to drink six or more this could be a somewhat decent option."
"Poured this beer in Zihuatanejo and Puerto Vallarta and it tasted so good, being so hot out side. This has to be my best Mexican beer, second is Modelo Especial. The rest of the Mexican beer you can have. This had a nice clean flavor and had a fairly nice balance of hops and malts. Not over powering flavor, just medium mild and a good quincher on hot muggy days."
"If it was cheaper I'd say go for it and drink it. You won't be disappointed, but you won't be impressed."
"this beer has a milder taste than a lot of lagers, but its special. a great alternative to corona this beer has a real nice sweeter smell with a citric afterstaste, nice and hoppy. poured with a medium head not much to brag about. thought this beer tasted very nice. i will undoubtedly drink it again. recommended especially for lighter drinkers."
"Straight from the bottle, it's a rather bland beer. There's no noteworthy characteristics about the nose and I'm going to have to assume that the head and lacing is pretty much in line with just about every other American style Macro Lager. Nothing out of the ordinary. Taste is not bad, nothing at all to complain about except the fact that it doesn't have more flavor. You could easily forget what you're drinking with this one because there's absolutely nothing that stands out about it. Flavor and mouthfeel are like a better, more pleasant Budweiser, but even less memorable. You could drink this beer like water. It's got no inherent flaws other than being entirely generic."
"Final thought: About how I thought it would fare... I'll stick to buying this at cheap Mexican restaurants where the only other option is Corona."
"Drinkability: I will pass on this one ever again, and not recomend it to anyone. There are much better beers for the price."
"So, its dry and cripe, all in all not bad  its middle of the road stuff, and when better options are available on tap, it lags behind."
"This is a rather watery international lager that still is more flavorful than Bud or Canadian. Its pretty refreshing in the heat on the beach but doesnt have much flavor or complexity to offer."
"Hmm, I sit here not hating this beer cause I'm thirsty and tired but in reality this is a fairly watery lager that has little real character. The nose is ciderlike( a sign of age) but the taste is still ok. Hints of corn but not too sweet in the finish make this ok fresh in a Mexican bar but not worth paying import prices for."
"Consuming it in an ideal setting undoubtedly added to my experience, which was enjoyable, so I'm edging up the points on taste and drinkability. I'm very likely to drink a beer like this in a similar situation in the future, and I'm not going to penalize a brew for playing to its strengths."
"drinkability is good for what this is, which is a Mexican Lager, nothing really ""special"" about it, but it isn't off putting either, not a bad lawnmower brew."
"A middle of the road lager. Nothing special about this beer."
"I don't particularly like this beer. It is clear staw colored sparkly fizz. It does have some sweeter malty smell to it. And the taste is malty, unbalanced, tinny, and just too acidic for me. Light and crisp. Drinkable only because it is light and isn't so bad out of the bottle."
"A light bodied lager, well suited for hot weather in the Southern climes, not for the fall season in mid America"
"Pours a full gold color and is brilliantly clear; it is well carbonated but cant really manage to hold more than a wisp of a pale head. The aroma is lightly spicy with just a bit of hops; there is also a note of sweet grain. The beer is quite thin on the palate, and other than a little bitterness does not linger at all. The taste is crisp and flavorless up front, but manages to finish with a bit of hop bitterness and a sweet thin graininess. As expected there is not much to this beer, it is fairly clean, except for the sweet grainy character. Really not much to say about this."
"Like most of the lager beers, its blond color, and low fermentation, without abuse of hops, beach favorite beer, good with seafood and chinese cuisine; smell give an alcaline sensation, smell plane, soft; mouthfeel and drinkability under the average, is not common in my city. 78% recommended."
"A bit watery and thin on malt flavor. Not a lot of taste but drinkable. Nothing to get exited about. Probably good with tacos."
"I found this to be sub par in the drinkability realm; I think water or iced tea would be a much better alternative. As a beer I have no desire to drink this one again. Ive not had any Mexican food that this would be good with, not even Taco Bell. I purchased my bottle in Omaha. Skip it."
"Worst beer in Mexico ever!, plus the light ones. Maybe, the lager concept was mistaken by light, because this beer ahs been always very light, water flavor and easy to get spoiled with a little heat over it. Some amateur drinkers like it because of it smootness and not getting drunk so easy."
"Taste is much less grassy and much more sweet fruity malt. A hint of hops in the finish. A nice crispness to finish it off. Rinse your tongue and repeat. Thin and fizzy, clean finish, some fruity aftertaste not much else. Is not too drinkable for a pale lager. Not bad, not good. A suitable alternative to the Big 3 is you MUST have a beer somewhere."
"This is a pretty unimpressive, bland, macro lager, very similar to the big American ones. I can't name one redeeming quality of it except that it's watered down and easy to drink if you're in the mood for something bland that won't fill you up. Might as well just drink a Bud or Coors."
"Pours a crystal clear pale gold. One finger head with good retention and sticky lacing are two aspects you won't find in many other Macros. However, the European influence on Mexican beer is heavily percieved in the taste and smell. Skunky hops and spicy grain dominate, while lending a dry bittness and smooth mouthfeel. Light to medium body and good carbonation with a clean finish. Not very different, but certainly better than the average macro or euro lager."
"Drinkability: The best mexican lager available up here in Canada."
"Overall-simply unremarkable, I feel like I've tasted this beer a thousand times, and I HAVE because it is just like any BMC product. Dissapointing especially compared to the decent vienna amber. Overall it's acceptable if this is what your looking for but the Amber is a much better choice."
"On a whim, I recently tried a bottle of Dos Equis with a meal. I've got to say, I didn't realize what I'd been missing by always picking a craft brew or lesser-known beer instead of Dos Equis during all those trips to beer stores. The only real real disappointment in this beer was the smell. Perhaps it's allergy season kicking in, but I had real trouble drawing any distinct aroma from either the brew or the empty bottle (usually the bottle will provide aroma even when the beer hasn't). Appearance seemed like the ho-hum average for crystaline lagers. Mouthfeel and drinkability also weren't worthy of top marks, in my book, but they did make the beer more appealing than the lack of smell might suggest. Starts a gentle, almost sweet flavor and settles onto the tongue with a light-bodied yet complex palatte hop, wheat, and oat undertones. Finishes as it begins, and I was glad to find out that it left without the least hint of bitter or sour afterthoughts. No part of this beer stays on the tongue after the brew has been consumed. I'd say this would probably be a good beer to start out the night, as you could head right into your next bottle without fear that it'll taste like Dos Equis."
"Nice color; no head nor lace. Barely a smell. Lightly hoppy. watery. Bubbly. If you know your beers, you'll hardly want another one."
"Thin mouthfeel with the only saving grace that the beer has some excellent active carbonation. This is another why bother beer, but it is easy to drink. I should have a got a margarita instead!"
"Final thought: Like some other Mexican beers (Corona not included) this just seems better when consumed in the right setting, namely Mexico."
"Pours a light color with not much head and zip lacing. Smells like a typical lager. Malt, malt, malt. However, it tastes really good. Great carbonation level, nice malt taste and goes down easy. One of my favorite session beers when low on cash. My #1 beer in Mexico so far."
"Drinkability: If you're at a Mexican restaurant, haven't tried Dos Equis, and are really thirsty, order a few. But if any of the above terms don't apply, then I'd probably skip this one. Nothing to get excited about."
"Pours a clear, typical adjunct lager color with a tiny head that goes away quicky. Smells like your normal skunky ""green bottle"" beer with hints of grain and corn. Tastes, again, like an average lager. Malts and hops are very, very minimal. Also has the thinnest taste of corn. Much more carbonated than it looks. Feels like an MBC beer in the mouth. This would be a completely average session beer if nothing else is around. All in all, it's better than corona and your typical mexican beers, but not by much."
"A good beer to have when trying a couple of different Dos Equis varieties for comparison, but definately not one to go back to."
"This isn't the beer for that. I have tried this at mexican restaruants and it complements spicy food, salsa, and chips magnificently. By itself it kinda sucks though."
"An average lager, I tend to go with this in mexican restaurants because about as decent as mexican lagers get. Pours a lazy yellow with a little lace head. The smell is of grain and hints of sugared malt, slight skunk, the taste is of a nice breaded grain mixed with a smooth crisp malt that cleanses the palate, light bodied and a good lawnmower beer."
"It's an unimpressive straw color that is really not much different than typical American lagers. It has a bold, bitter taste that is killed completely by the lime wedges that rude waiters will put in it unless you specifically tell them not to."
"-Oelergud"
"This is definently a better brew than the majority of the Mexican lagers I've had. Appearance is golden, fairly bright, but head is quite weak with almost no retention. Smell is standard, luckily not skunked, slightly sweet, not powerful at all. Taste is fairly average, which is quite good for a Mexican beer. Hops bite is minimal, beer tastes mainly of average malty sweetness. Taste ends up equalling a nice middle-of-the-road lager. Dos Equis Special Lager is a nice, easy-drinkin' beer, I would have no problem drinking this with Mexican food or in a weekend session."
"The beer poured a yellow color, and I thought to myself, it looks like Bud. The smell, however, is a bit more appealing than Bud's. The taste is better. I enjoyed the mild sweet graniness of the flavor. The slight hops and malt seemed to balance each other nicely. This beer is more full-bodied than tecate, sol, or superior, but that is not saying much. I cannot picture myself ordering this beer in an American bar, but in Mexico it taste nice."
"Pale, crystal clear appearance. This beer has the tone of white grapefruit juice. Maybe just a little darker. No head. A slight dirty white collar. Appearance is lacking. Light grainy malts and hay on the nose. Maybe a titch of floral hop aroma. Mouthfeel is more carbonated than it looks. Malts are grainy and corny on the buds. Just a little bit of an astringent bitterness. A little metallic character comes into play in the aftertaste. Not my cup of tea, but I've had worse."
"I picked thisone on tap at a pool-side bar for ive had the amber but not the lager. It came with a lime in it that im sure put a citric spin on the taste and flattened the appearance. That said, it was a well carbonated gold that had a white head that sorta fizzed to nothing. Very little lace spots could be seen. The aroma of corn & grain greet you as the same taste follows. The taste also had a metallic hint to it as well. An ok lager on a hot day by the pool esp. when its the only off macro offered. Though, loose the lime, Quickly!"
"The Dos Equis poured a very light, clear yellow with a fizzy head that was very quickly completely gone. It has a skunky, yet slightly floral nose. It's very thin and watery. There is very little flavor, just a sweetish starch and some slight skunkiness. Overall, it's a little better than some macros, but not by much."
"Ve4ry refreshing beer and it does taste better than corona as a matter afact it dosn't need a lime. It does have a little corny taste to it but it has more subsatnce and body than corona thats why its better evn though im not saying i would buy this beer. I wouldn't ever."
"This was horrific. Corn and adjcunts aplenty, watery mouthfeel, Typical Mexican yellow as piss lager. Some plastic flavours pop up every now and then. Luckily i had the footy to watch to distract me from the weak as piss Mexican lager, this is easily just as bad as corona."
"Beats Corona for washing down Mexican food."
"As far as Mexican brews go, this is one that is on the edge of being something really good. It porued a medium golden color with minimal head that subsided quickly. The smell was grainy but with a bit of hops in there. The taste was almost pure euro-lager skunk but it was saved by a nice dry aftertaste the caught me by suprise. This is much better than Corona and Pacifico, but there must be better mexican brews out there."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a spotty white lace head. The aroma is good. It's typical lager scent all the way; pale malts and lager yeast. It does have a bit of a sweet smell to it. The taste is decent. It is light with a simple pale flavor. It goes down easy with a dry finish and that Mexican lager zing. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. It drinks average. This is a run of the mill lager, nothing special."
"This was sampled at Hotel Nelson in Tijuana with some excellent nachos and some wonderful mexican dinners. This was poured into a foam cup (as we were sitting outside) and suprisingly the cup did not impart any off flavors in this beer. The aromas are all light hops and malts, and the taste follows suit. The mouthfeel is light, but has more oomph than a corona or sol and the drinkability is great."
"Overall, this isn't terrible if you're pairing it up with something like chips and salsa or a spicey dish. By itself, Dos Equis Special Lager is pretty bland and uninspired."
"The head was small and irregular but the lacing wasn't too bad. Except for a slightly skunky pungency, the aroma of Dos Equis was similar to most other mass produced lagers ~ sweet corn mingled with a touch of bitterness; I thought I could detect a minute suggestion of citrus balanced (in a very small dose, mind you) with a very small hint of honey. Average. The taste was bland, watery and pretty much tasteless. On the palate Dos Equis was thin and didn't feature much of an aftertaste. Very dull and unexciting stuff."
"22 oz. bottle. I was prepared to dislike it: Green bottle of overhyped import purchased from drug store cooler with flourescent lights. etc. But this just didn't suck the way I thought. It is kind of plain, with a standard beery smell. Not a lot of flavor and perhaps filled with adjuncts. Still, nothing really offensive, mostly what youd expect in this style, and probably a better choice in most Mexican restaurants. Just why do so-called ""Mexican Beers"" try to taste just like American ones?"
"Don't see what the ""special"" part of this lager is. This lager will serve to quench your thirst, but will not make you wish for another based upon the taste. It pours to a decent head with a fair color. The nose leaves lots to be desired, no rush of malts or hops. The beer fills your mouth, but nothing stands out and the finish consists of some decent lager crispness, but it is very shortlived."
"went down alright with my quesadillas, but considering im paying top shelf price for it, i can surely do better, especially when its not a whole lot better than local swill. i spose at least the flavor wasnt offensive, but still dull as dishwater."
"Hundreds of tiny bubbles streaming through its crystal-clear yellow-gold body support a creamy white head that holds well and leaves some craggy and spotty lace about the glass. The nose is 'generic beer' with a distinct note of dimethyl sulfite and some mild skunkiness remaining from what little hops were there to begin with. It's lightly crisp and then somewhat creamy in the mouth as it warms across the palate. The flavor delivers all that might be expected, which is little. It's sweetish, adjunct-laden and DMS laced malt is held in check by a sublime bitterness; and it finishes short and dry with a light note of refreshing hop spice and some short lingering malt sugar."
"Basically I would consider this an upper class of Corona. I didn't like the taste at first, but after a few minutes I actually began to enjoy it. It seems as if it tasted a little strong at first, but then the more and more I drank it, it seemed to diminish in strength. A decent imported Mexican beer, I recommend it over Corona for those summer time parties."
"It is one of the better mexican beers, with the exception of Casta, which isn't even in the same class."
"Pours a boring yellow color with a small white head. Nothing much in the aroma - smells like a mass produced beer. Slightly bitter taste and drinkable with a lime. I've had this beer when it tasted really good and other times I've had it and not liked it at all, so I'm not sure what to say to conclude. It's not bad at all for a mass-production beer, but it's still nothing special."
"Drinkability  Its made to drink ice cold in the heat with a lime, so drink it ice cold in the heat with a lime."
"Medium gold color, no head. Light hops and malts. Very dry taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. There is almost a champagne like finish to this beer. Kind of strange. Aftertaste is dry and slightly malty. Not a lot of flavor. Typical Mexican Party beeer."
"When I poured this beer into my glass, the head quickly dissolved and there were small bubbles with this beer. This beer was watery and did not have much taste to it in my opinion. The hue of this beer was yellow. It had an aftertaste to it which I did not like and there is not much character to this beer."
"Crisp-clear light yellow brew with firm-looking carbonation in the glass yet no head to speak of. A straw-like, mild-skunk smell to this one, with maltiness. A bit sweet and not at all dry. Could this possibly be all-barley brewed? (doubt it!) Taste is just ""there"" and barely worth remembering. Not for me in or out of the sun and wouldn't give dos pesos to take one home."
"When I drank this, I found myself comparing this to Rolling Rock, only with Dos Equis having a fuller body and flavor. The off-flavors in Rock are a bit similar to this. Altogether, this is a somewhat decent beer that would pair up well with Mexican food, but the taste seems a bit too corny for my liking."
"Drinkability/notes: One of the better macro brews from Mexico, one could do far worse. Dos XX goes well with Mexican food, and it can be found any Mexican restaurant in Texas thats worth its salt. Very refreshing in hot summer weather."
"Pours a decent enough golden color that is clear with a thin short lived head. The Nose is very sweet malt and mid level hops that are crisp. The flavor is also quite sweet with a mild hop bitterness that adds more of a spicey falvor than a hoppy one. The mouthfeel is decent and soft - not heavy carbonation. The finish is fair as well with a sweet and bitter blend in the aftertaste."
"This was the only beer out my Mexican sampling that had any hop presence, even though here it is still weak. Color is golden pale yellow, trying hard to be dark. Head was white just hovering over 1/4 inch high, some bubble lace. Smells faintly of sweet spiced malt and just a hint of hop. Taste is more of the same, with just a bit more boldness and sharpness in the flavor department. Mostly sweet malt thats got a slight spice to it and has slight noticeable hop nearing the back. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, crisp and clean, a bit sharper then the others. Easy drinker and bit more to it then just water."
"Like its darker stablemate Amber Lager, this a good beer, if not a top beer. For lagers it is on target and is relatively true to the pale lager style. The mid yellow coloring is good if not strong, but the head is thin and quickly gone. Very little lacing. A grain sense in both the smell and taste. This is not a disappointing brew, but it offers only a limited set of reasons to choose it over others. A good beer where better choices cannot be found."
"A decent beer, taste better than corona. Pours a gold color with little or no head. This like corona is good on a hot mexican summer day. I've had this both here and in Mexico and it did taste better in Mexico but one thing either here or there its watery. There is very little carbonation goes down just like water. Amber is better more flavor."
"Drinkability & Notes: For what it is worth this is better than Corona, other than that I’ll pass on this one next time it comes around."
"The Mexican Restaurant I usually go to had this beer on tap and I had never tried it on tap before. The beer poured clear and had a good head which lasted for quite awhile. The aroma was not much. No malt nor hops. The flavor was quite subdued. Its coldness and refreshing quality made a good companion for a great tamale dinner. For a dinner drink it is great. It would make a great summer cooler."
"Not as good as the amber, but still worth a try. Had kind of a malty taste, but not too malty. I like the logo, pretty original. Not as cool as Sol logo, but still cool. Finished smooth, a little watery, but not too bad. I like it with Mexican food or on a hot summer day."
"Clearish straw color with a better head than some and lacks adjunct qualities. A bit of skunk smell, some sense of a weak hay. Malt is decent, some estery sense and elements of subdued nutiness. Mouthfeel is light and attenuates into a dryishness late. Some senses of raw grain and corn syrup. This brew is fairly mediocre overall, but has more malt goodness than many others from south of the border."
"A rarity in that its a lager with some character. Nothing amazing, but the clearly the best mexican pils. It has a decent amber color and medium and lively body. Basic but attractive malt aroma and lovely balanced acidity."
"The pour a limpid golden straw color, the head masterful and bright white, the lace in fine sheets to coat the glass. Malt makes up the nose with a nice lightly sweet front, and the top skinny, finish is perkily acidic, the hops adequate and the aftertaste dry."
"Pours a clear light golden color with a foamy white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma and flavor are a nice balance of sweet malts and bitter hops. Very crisp and refreshing in the mouth. This is one of those beers that a big plate of spicy Tex-Mex cries out for."
"Screw Corona, this is the Mexican Beer. Good amber color, light head, light yet a good body. The only beer to drink with Mexican food. Very thirst quenching, so you can eat as many peppers as you like!"
"Good head, doesn't linger but there is a head.  Nice rich copper color.  I can't exactly spot the aroma but there are hints of bannana and other tropical things. Semi-sweet flavor, but does not reflect exactly the aroma.  Makes the mind think that you are in Mexico.   Good finish, but must have a lime to balance it out."
"Nice fine head. Good rich color. Smells like green bananas, toasted corn flour and corn syrup. A little exotic in a way, but over sweet by far. The flavors are much more dilute than the aromas suggest with repetition of the toasted corn theme. Dry and lightning quick finish, leaving a parched, grainy bitterness. One to avoid."
"I remember a college buddy raving about this beer.  I don't think I'd had it in about 8 or 9 years when I bought this six pack.  In conclusion, it's nothing worth raving about, but it's not terrible either.  On the whole, Dos Equis is better than the typical macro.  Medium-dark straw color with negligible head.    Cereal grains, grassiness, and a little DMS are some minor distracting flaws.  Nice, clean hop finish.  Has a little more character than I expected."
"just your average lager with a different twist.  a cross breed between euro lager and american adjunct.  not really bad but not really exciting enough to wax poetic.  the graininess in the taste and aroma may turn people off, but with some spicy hot mexican food ...who's gonna know the difference?   actually it's pretty bold for a lager and should be drank with food that is just as bold."
"No where near as good as the Amber.  The flavor was there and then gone instantly...reminding me of a non-alcoholic beer.  Not worth mentioning any other characteristics except for the lack of flavor."
"2.5's across the board on this one.  A very average pils.  I guess its appearance at every Mexican restaurant makes it better than other bland offerings.  Face it, when you pair it with spicy food, its not that bad."
"Special lager?!?! no to me. all i kept hearing was better than corona as far as mexican beers go. i dont think so. this had a really funny taste to it. it was not too bad, but when i think special, i think of that excellent brew that just leaves a big smile on your face and some naked women on your lap. they are drinkable, but not enjoyable"
"Dark straw / light golden in hue and typically clear.  The head settles into a moderate layer that persists well enough to leave lace.  The overall malt aroma is very mild and consists of light grainy notes and just a hint of cooked corn dimethyl sulfide.  Hop nose is absent.  It's clean, but unenticing aroma - wise.  The overall flavor is balanced, but bland. The mild hop bitterness is balanced by both residual malt and adjunct corn sweetness.  Malt complexity is lacking due to the adjuncts in the grist-- only a light husky flavor from the basemalt contributes flavor.  Hop flavor is virtually absent.  The finish is clean, dry, and leaves much to be desired.  Special Lager is reminiscent of a domestic macrobrew w/ more flavor.  It's definitely not a beer to be appreciated by itself."
"This one is runner-up to Bohemia for Mexican beers in my opinion.  It's actually got a bit of hop flavor and lacks the sticky-sweetness of some other Mexican lagers.  It goes well with the likes of carnitas and chile relleno."
"This is another one of those beers that I used to enjoy before my pallate evolved.  The amber color of the brew had me feeling hopeful, but the flavor was exceedingly thin.  A little hop, a little sweet.  But mostly... not much.  It was a fine beer to match up with the barbecue I was having that night, but that's about all I can say positive for it."
"You really gotta be desperate to drink alot of this.  Dos Equis is a deep mahogany color, with a big malty molasses flavor and a hop finish. This beer stays reasonably dry throughout. Corny rice filler aftertaste makes this brew a one time experience only for me."
"Good Continental-Style Lager. Goes well with Mexican dishes or any other spicy food. Good beer if you can get it for a decent price.  Comes in green bottles, so beware the skunks."
"This beer was a surprise. I'm not really big on the light colored beers. I usually only drink them when the goal is getting drunk. Dos Equis is similar to Corona in flavor color and most of the other factors, but it's just better tasting and a darker, fuller color. Squeeze in a little lime or not, it's just a great beer to drink with a meal, especially if you're eating mexican."
"A Mexican take on Heineken?  Fairly clean, with some mild corn influence, but not much going on here."
"Notes: European/German brewing influences are apparent with this brew. It's not your typical Mexican lager/pils. And, even though it's essentially a mediocre beer, it's not an entirely bad beer. Pairs nicely with Mexican food or a nice alternative to American Lagers as it has a bit more body and flavour."
