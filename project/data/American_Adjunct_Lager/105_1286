The smell is grain and corn. Milwaukee's Best Premium has the look and smell of an American style lager. The taste is mild with corns and grans, lighter than what I was expecting. Nothing to write home about but it not bad. I have had a lot worse.  For what it is worth this brew goes down smooth with a nice clean finish. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it. Miller Brewing Co. did a nice job with this one. Overall I'm giving Milwaukee's Best Premium a 4.5 out of 5.  I would buy this brew again.","nicholas2121","Oct 20, 2014"

Taste like a typical american lager grains and malts. The hops are their to balance  the beer out . It has very tiny taste of cardboard if warm but other the that milkwaulees best can hold its own against high price Budwesier , MGD. Your typical american  lager with out the price tags. It is the lowest price beer in most market in the country You can take the  label off  Milwaukee Best Premium  beer an put a Coors or MGD label on this beer and 99 percent of the people would not know they would be drinking a cheap beer. This beer is excellent for what it is american adjunct lager. I rate Milwukee Best Preuim with other maerican adjunct lagers an apples  with apples rating . Meaning I rate  Milwaukee  best Preuim with other american lager . IThis beer beats out 95 percent of american lagers out their on the market specially  Mexical lagers with their high price .  Milkwaulee  Best Premium is  the best value on market for taste , price and quality.","bbluemzbeer","Aug 18, 2014"

It also drinks very light. You can chug a bunch without starting to feel bloated. The only thing I would change is that it's less than 5% alcohol.

Milwaukee’s Best is just that, beer as a beverage. The golden color, light carbonation and thin head let you know this is just beer. While not as pretty as a Salvation IPA from Avery, it looks more refreshing than a Coke or Mountain Dew. There is some aroma, which is a plus. Flavor combines light malt with a bit of hop bitterness at the finish. Overall, its beer as a beverage and no more. But as summer approaches, and it is time to shed the pounds that all of those stouts and IPA’s added over the winter, a spell of just drinking plain Jane beer is just what the doctor ordered.","iSip","Jun 21, 2012"
3.54,94.5,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"I didn't bother pouring this one out of the can in order to observe appearance. That was not how this beer was intended to be consumed. I DID decide to compare it side by side to my current favourite economy beer, Old Milwaukee. I've got to say, it's a pretty good super-economy beer. Nothing offensive about it whatsoever. Fairly dry and crisp with just a hint of corn (I like it when brewers don't try to hide corn flavour with something more offensive or when they just remove all flavour). It does not stack up to Old Milwaukee, though. Old Milwaukee has more taste and I think might even be cheaper. So, this may not be the best option and I may not buy it again, but it's definitely a better option than Busch, Lone Star, Keystone, etc. It's about on par with the average batch of the ultra-cheap Big Flats, but as my review of that beer indicates, the flavour of that beer is not consistent.","ElCommodoro","Jun 20, 2012"

And something else, not quite sure what. Not much of the bitter chemical kind of adjunct I found with Bud or Highlife, but there's something else a little off in this beer. Like the yeast was sick and stunted or something.(or maybe that was the missing hop character) Anyway mouthfeel was definately overcarbonated.

There isn't much here to talk about, this beer has all the bad tastes of adjunct lagers without some of the possible good flavors of grains or mild sweetness.
