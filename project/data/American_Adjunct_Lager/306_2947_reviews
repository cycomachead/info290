"I'm not reviewing this under duress, BA."
"It tastes like water and it is only good for parties with high volume."
""
"It isn't the greatest thing, but isn't the worst. Cheap. Its swill really. Still not bad. Tastes ok. when people give things like this a 1 or 2 what are they comparing it to?"
""
""
"Pours a nice golden color with lots of carbonation but no head. Smells like highly fermented corn. A little sweet and some bitterness in the back of the throat and highly carbonated going down."

"Words cannot describe the horrible taste of this beer (if I'd call it beer). I picked up a tallboy on my way home from work. I popped the top and had me a few swigs before throwing that nasty stuff out the window into the ditch. Tastes like watered down milky fruit loops. Don't waste your .99cents."

"Keystone ICE is an ICE brew made by Coors. Pours a nice amber color. With a small white head. The can says always smooth,not as smooth as the light. There is nothing bad about this brew for being 5.9 avb. Nothing much different from your other Ice Brews on the market."

"There are worse cheap swills/malt liquors to be had so, this is NOT the worst cheapy swill out there but it is as I say , very industrial and a bit harsh after 2 or 3 and i've noticed the hangover can be pretty gruesome if you pound a bunch of it ."

"Pours to a thin white head and pale yellow-gold color. Aroma is grainy, chemicals and faintly vomit-like and not much else. Flavor is corny, vegetal, grainy and not much else. Mouth-feel is light, overcarbonated and rough although the can says it is smooth. No mass produced beer that I have ever tasted that boldly claimed it was ""smooth"" on the label actually was. Overall, it is a cheap way to get drunk and not much else."

"Overall this was the old standby for the college beer fridge and is just a beer you buy when you want to get drunk."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good 'Ice' beer that's stronger than some 'Malt Liquors' and easier to drink than some brand-name 'Light beers.'"

"I did not try this one in a glass, i dont think their is a sutable glass for it? Anyway it smells like corn/rice, it taste like corn/rice , and it has one of the most present tastes of alcohol of any beer ive ever drank, making it not so easy to enjoy. Ice cold from the cooler and drank with an open mind. This beer ""to me"" reminded me of a whiskey taste mixed with a glass of ice that had been melting for awhile. Im not bashing , its just not that good to me, probably my least favorite of all."

"Light bodied, too much carbonation, and poorly made. Not sure who likes drinking this, or why it's still around. They probably sell a lot of this on April Fool's Day."

"Overall: As a party, ""lets get drink for cheap"" beverage, it works. People don't buy this expecting to be blown away (especially when the tall boys are 2 for $2.22). When I drink this beer, there's an intangible quality I can sense. I can't explain it, but it's the feeling that if you drink a lot of this, you will feel like death the next morning."

"O - Overall, this was a good adjunct. Very session-able and it would be great for a party. At $1.59 for a 24oz can, I'd have it again in a party scenario. Now remember, I'm not somebody who simply bashes an AAL because it's an AAL. I give every beer a FAIR review, And in my opinion, this is one of the better adjuncts that I've had."

"O: This beer doesn’t have much in the way of interesting flavors, unless you like adjunct malts and apple juice."
"O: Crisp and refreshing, actually better than I expected after smelling this beer. Certainly not a beer that I would seek out again but not as bad as expected (or remembered from college in the mid-1990s)."

"There's very little to report here. The flavor is sweet corn and grains. When it's ice cold you can drink a lot of it and quickly. Not something I would buy again."

"O: Keystone Ice is better than the sum of its parts.  This is THE macro ice lager I would use to introduce someone to the style.  Although Bud Ice is smoother it has less character, costs more, is harder to find, and has less impact (drunkenness.)  For ice beers available to me Keystone Ice is the winner."

"Overall – It really has nothing going for it except its crispness. This would be good for right after a run or hard bike on a hot summer day when you want something without too complex a body and that is very crisp and easy to sit, relax, and cool down with."

"Ov: While it's easy to criticize adjunct lagers, this beer is effective at achieving a moderate buzz thanks to the higher ABV. This will forever be immortalized as long as there are frat parties in existence. It appeals to the younger, inexperienced and to the bargain hunters. You could easily buy a similar beer and not feel a thing. At least with this you are guaranteed some kind of result. While staying at this price point I would rather recommend an Old Milwaukee or PBR if flavor becomes a higher priority."

"Well, pretty much what I expected here. Its drinkable, sure, but the only highlight I can tell you about drinking this is that it has 5.9 % ABV, of which I keep staring at as I drink this. Its sweet, metallic, has some corn in it, and looks like malt liquor. The can says it is specially lined, I wonder what is so special about the liner, and why it needs to be mentioned on the can? Overall, a ""great"" ice beer made by Coors, I'll be sure to grab another 24 ounce can for 1.25 for an affordable buzzz."

"For the fact it does not taste horrible I will mark it down like many others, as something to get a buzz on but at least drinkable to a degree. I cannot wait till I can afford better beer again."

"Overall: A terrible beer of this style, but if you're looking to get smashed, it's an ok option. I almost poured mine down the drain, but felt the alcohol coming on, and decided to finish it based solely on that."
"I drank this beer because I'm a sucker for cheap beer and it was offered to me by a friend. I'm too polite to be such a snob that I turn someone away because their tastes are not as ""refined"" as mine. I didn't enjoy it, but it's not the worst thing I've ever drank."
"O - No, I don't want another, but if it's there and you want to get drunk then it will do the job."
"Not a good beer."
"Purchased at a Circle K in the Ville aka Steubenville, OH price check if anybody cares a dollar 69. Not much more booze than your typical malt lager but this is an iced version of Keystone. Appears in the most non descript form of a yellow fizzy lager, plop plop fizzes rise from the bottom of the glass. White head dwindles pretty rapidly even while your pouring the beer the head races to meet the body, wtf I guess a true college beer drinker knows how to pour a beer without any or much head. More beer right? Aroma has a pure cooked corn/cereal grain aroma...faint muddled herbal quality not quite hops. Flavor wise a pretty srong cereal grain infusion of rice/malts/corn with a bitter unpleasant offbeat singing through the melody of unconditioned and off put flavors. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a rough heavy carbonation filling my senses this is tough sipping beer from a tallboy can. Overall I drank most of this not sure the portion that I didn't get down but I've seen much worse but this isn't aiming it's sights very high. A really mediocre brew that is put out there with extremly low expectations."
"Although this beer gets a lot of hate, it's better than other ice lagers on the market. The appearance is nothing special, but the flavor is far less offensive than other ice lagers. If you're strapped for cash and want something smooth, this brew is a decent buy."
"From a can marked Oct1011-BO8060639. The pour is yellow with no head and busy carbonation. The aroma is more subtle than many Ice beers with a crispy hoppiness sneaking up on the nose but little in the way of malts. Plenty of corn and adjuncts. The body is thin. The taste is a tad mellower than I expected but otherwise it is mainly corn, metal, and a weak hop factor. It's a macro ice beer...what do you expect? Better than some though."
"I only drink this when one of my friend's friend's friend ends up bringing it to a party. This beer is really only good for beer pong. Tastes pretty bad when it gets warm, but your drinking it to get drunk not to enjoy. If this was left over after a party, I'd make them disappear, but I would never use my hard earned cash for this brew."
"This beer is cheap but it lacks taste and what it has is a very inoffensive corn/rice taste. So to sum it up it goes down easy and gets you drunk as long as you have no expectations."
"Now if i was comparing this to a good quality craft beer id probably give it a D-."
"The finish leaves a mouthfeel that coats your mouth and makes you want to spit a lot. Over all I'm not impressed but somebody left it in my fridge and I wouldn't let one go to waste."
"O - I stopped at a gas station and looked for the highest ABV. Not a lot of options."
"OK, seriously. Its head disappeared within a couple seconds of pouring. Never seen that happen before. It poured a clear bright yellow. I thought it smelled strongly of green apples. The mouthfeel is that of high carbonation. It tastes like bread, essentially. I was surprised to find that it tasted more of bread than corn or of alcohol. The aftertaste is almost the same as the aftertaste after you've eaten a slice of an 89 cent loaf of ""wheat"" bread. So, for the price, it's ALMOST worth it. One problem: it gives me terrible heartburn before I've ever finished the can! Never experienced that with any other beer before. I've had problems with heartburn before, but never before finishing a single can of beer. Not sure what's in this stuff that causes such a problem, but for me that makes it not worth paying ANY money for. A good alternative: Big Flats 1901. It has more flavour, doesn't feel weird in your throat or stomach, and is CHEAPER! Yes, I said cheaper. Hard to beat that logic."
"Pours a very light straw yellow color with a thick white head and no lacing. Smells of sweet corn and maybe rice. Tastes very light with no bitterness and a lot of corn. Mouthfeel is thin and watery and has a very heavy carbonation. Overall, pretty nasty."
"I do fine this pretty easy to tolerate drinking, but the nasty astringent flavors in there lead me to believe drinking too many of these would be quite regrettable later on."
"p.s. they've updated the can since the profile pic here was taken. now it's upside down to conceal your shame that others will see the swill you're intaking. cheers."
"D: Ice tends to be synonymous with ""horrendous"" in terms of beer and this can did nothing to change that."
"Keystone Ice just really doesn't get along with my palette, I guess. It is a beer I will never buy again. If its free and the only option, then I'll definitely be the D.D. for the night."
"Either my palate now welcomes the style or I'm starting to find examples that seem to fit it best. As cheap as this is, I already prefer it to Natty Ice (it is an ice beer after all). There's a beer for all income brackets and though this is not as cheap as Mountain Brew Ice, it is just as tasty."
"overall i found this to be a total waste. i found more taste in an odouls."
"Hard to drink beer. Very cheap and somewhat strong. Im having a very hard time drinking this beer. Avoid definately!"
"D: I poured it out to spare my self the calories. I will not have another not even for beer pong and flip cup."
"As far as appearance, I had this stuff at poker night in college so it's hard to tell the appearance of a beer in a red plastic cup. However on the pour there was almost no head except for some oily looking foam clinging in sparse areas of the surface of my beer and the color of the pour was very similar to say...well lets just say this beer must have been dehydrated and taking its B vitamins cause it looked and smelled like it. The mouthfeel is initially no different than any other macro brew, which is to say there isn't much of anything going on here. On the finish it seems to mutate into something altogether different, leaving a funky coating on the palate and a bit of a sharp bite in the back of the throat (that could be the vodka they're pouring in this stuff to up the alcohol content...not seriously by the way...but it feels like it). The taste is only what can be described as unbearable, although I did bear it that night and succeeded in getting pretty hammered off the stuff (is its one redeeming quality) which leads me to the point I am today. One of my college buddies bought a case of it and after opening the can I knew I wouldn't be able to pull another night off with this one. I literally swallowed a chug of the beer and it immediately reversed directions and...well you can imagine. I'm just glad I was close to the trash can."
"D- How can people drink this? I gave this a 2.0 drink ability rating because its a ""damn it I wanna die so lets get drunk chug this sucker"" type of beer."
"D- A rare example of where the light version is distinguishably better than the non-light."
"You can drink this stuff, it's not bad for the price but, it's definately not anything special, what would you expect thoough?"
"Overall: The body of the beer is light and the finish is medium. There is really odd meat flavor in the the finish of the beer, making it unpleasant and a drain pour."
"RJT"
"This is one for if you just want to get really trashed and don't care about beer at all. If you want a bit of alcohol in water then here's your beer."
"Overall: If you could keep this cold for more than 30 seconds it could be a bit less bad. If you must, just shotgun."
"Overall: worth two bucks and a quarter when times are bad."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Taste, since it doesn't taste like much, it isn't as bad as the ""bad"" appearance and aroma. Mouthfeel doesn't leave anything. Bad aftertaste I guess of cornmeal. Drinkability rates high, hey, its cheap, and since its like alcohol water, its relatively easy to drink, but why you would want to . . ."
"D-I could drink a lot of this beer. I could also cut my hair with a weedwacker, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea."
"This is for people who want a cheap quick buzz if you chug it, I suppose. I didn't chug it and was able to get through the whole 24 oz. can. Some short-lived sweetness lingered. In the end - a cheap macro with a bit of booze..."
"Bought a 24 ounce can for $1.35. Poured from can appears like most other lagars pale yellow. Lots of carbonated bubbles. Strong smell of corn. Lots of corn, sugar and yeast in the flavor. Somewhat stale flavor. No real malts or hops to speak of. Mouthfeel is pretty watery. Drinkability, in one word no."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Mild smell, some malts. Taste is lacking, some malts, finishing a bit metallic. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall not a whole lot to like about this one."
"D: I suppose if it's ice cold it's at least ""drinkable"". This beer is what it is: A (really) cheap buzz bear that you can buy in large quantities at gas stations and grocery stores. A ""beer pong beer"" in my book really. I would also like to point out that I'm not one of those people that is unwilling to drink macro light beers. I don't mind an occasional Coors or Bud Light with some chicken wings. That being said, I would never want to drink this outside of a college party, and even then not really."
"Pale, crystal clear, straw with a medium-sized, fizzy, white head that quickly diminishes to a thin ring. Smell is of weak malts, light yeast and veggie. Taste follows. Very adjunct flavor. Finish is crisp with light fruity whisps of fruit on the finish, something actually enjoyable. But as you go the finish turns chalky and husky. It looks cheap, it tastes cheap... but as long as that's what you're going for, it's not terrible. Is it a good beer? Ha! But in the category of American Adjunct Lager, it's not bad. So keeping style in mind I won't blast this beer."
"Appearance from this 24 oz. can is straw in color with a crisp head that dissapates quickly. Smell has light adjunct, but clean. Taste of slightly sweet corn, watered down with a light bitter bite. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Drinkable cheap buzz."
"What's the deal with Ice brews? Keystone Premium is awful, Keystone Light is worse, so why not stop there? The ABV is higher, but that doesn't make this any better. This beer is watery and not much else good can be said about it. Others have said it better than I can. Mouthfeel is weak, taste is atrocious, and poured appearance is without obvious merit. Drinkability is not improved by a higher ABV."
"The beer is a very light gold. The color is about as deep as sunlight. Lots of bubbles rise to the top but the head dies within seconds. The smell holds the slight burn of carbonation and hints of cheap beer adjunctness. The alcohol really takes over the beer in the taste. It's really sweet with a hint of sour adjuncts. The carbonation gets the back of your throat. There are thinner beers out there and I could drink the hell out of it, but I don't really want to."
"Pours a clear yellow color that is very light. There is a very slight head to it. The smell is of alcohol and grain. The taste is of alcohol and grain. The taste is very stingy it is very harsh to drink taste wise. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated. The mouthfeel is very harsh. The drinkability on this is very low, it is harsh and stings of alcohol, good if you are in college i guess."
"Nevertheless, Keystone Ice, as a beer on its own, doesn't cut it. But what did you expect from Coors?"
"As I poured, the white head bubbled and fizzed like soda pop and had retention commensurate with pop - none. That left me with a glass of golden-yellow beer with NE-quality clarity. The nose had a sweet, candy-like quality to it. Not lager-sweet, but candy-sweet. Oof. Pressing on, the mouthfeel was thin and watery with a bubble gum sweetness coupled with an alcohol heat on the tongue. Finish had an unpleasant astringency. I was glad that I was eating along with drinking. This could have been a Drain Pour otherwise."
"D - I suppose for a higher gravity cheap beer (got it for 50 cents otherwise I'd never try it) its ok on the drinkability level (even if the alcohol is a tad low for an ICE) but I could see this leaving one huge headache in its wake."
"I was able to finish 6 of them despite the horrible taste. I would never want to have this again."
"Maybe I'm in a darn fine mood with the 80 degrees and golf coming up - but this was a easy drinking adjunct ""lager""."
"As far as cheap beer goes I have always had a big forgivability towards the Keystone brand (picture McDonald's fries poured into a can); however, even though this ""ale"" was dirt cheap, it was a real task to drink on it's own. Hindsite being 20/20, it turns out that I don't care how little I pay for a can of suds when I feel a little like vomiting after every drink that I take. Unless you are just getting this stuff to put a beer into your obnoxious cousin's hand to make him shut-up and pass-out, then don't bother paying for the shit."
"I'm doing this review strictly for curiousity's sake. This beer was a transparent light yellow with a big and quickly-fading head after a vigorous pour. Let's not split hairs here, this is a beer for homeless people that can't manage to stumble into a place that sells Thunderbird or Mad Dog. Every so often college kids will also buy it to be ironic and then they'll pop their collars and high five and then drink a case of this swill and suck each other's dicks. The taste is as neutral as they could get with almost six percent alcohol. There's some corn, there's some alcohol, there's some lingering regret. The good news is that if you chug enough of it it begins to taste like water and that daytime hooker begins to look less like a post-op tranny. If it's cold enough you could almost mistake the mouthfeel for beer, and the drinkability for something rivaling a refreshing beverage. This is a beer that would make the people who purchase it sad if they still had the capacity for that type of emotion."
"I would drink this as a thirst quencher on a very hot day, or if I wanted to get hammered for less than 4 bucks."
"I can't say anything nice about it except that it doesn't look terrible. For a cheap beer it pours nicely and looks ok in a beer pong cup. That's about it. Terrible taste."
"Overall a pretty decent buy at $14 a 30 pack."
"I can't stomach this type of beer. Ice beer only has the quality of being more alcoholic than regular beer. It sacrifices flavor for alcohol. Beer should not be about getting drunk but rather the flavor. Therefore this is the opposite of what beer should be."
"Taste: Water corn and sugar, which is probably the three main ingredients."
"Pours a little more gold than yellow, as if someone ate a lot of carrots before they peed in the can. Aroma is extra-sugary corn syrup. Weird. The taste is beyond bad; tons of grain and metal with a heaping of sugar. The beer does have more heft to it than its cousins, and that is not a good thing. You will get drunk quickly on this stuff, though. And sick just as fast of drinking it."
"This is, honestly, the worst beer I have had the pleasure of trying. Pours a pale yellow, high carbonation, quickly dissipating head. I find no redeeming factors about it's flavor, aroma or appearance, other than it's 5.9% alcohol level, which makes it good for beer pong. Just getting this rating out of the way."
"(can - 12 oz) Strong malty aroma. Pours a pale golden color with a thick head that dissipates quickly. Not a lot of bubbles form on the glass. Sweet flavor that hits quickly, goes down smooth and doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. After the sweetness is gone, there's really no flavor or body to this beer. Speaking as a college student, you can't really go wrong with $4.99 for a 12 pack of 5.9% beer."
"D - Honestly, it just doesn't taste good."
"Decent beer for someone that wants to pound beers and get drunk quick, I've been to college and I know this beer has a place. Nothing terrible about this beer but nothing great about it."
"I bought this at a bar/beer joint here in Ktown. 1.25 per 24 oz can, cheapest stuff in the store, and that was my first mistake! Yuck... Thats my one word review.. It is not even worth running down the list of appearance, smell, etc... The only reason this is still being made is so poor college students or bums can get drunk quick. Bottom line: don't buy unless you are really short on cash."
"Drinkability: Tastes bad and with an ABV of 5.90, this beer serves one purpose. It gets ya drunk."
"If you want an ICE beer, this is the best. That being said, this beer is crap. Tastes like liquid aluminum, smells like bunghole, just a bad brew all around. I do believe it is the best ""ICE"" beer I have ever had, but I am not 100% on what an ""ICE"" beer really is. All I knw is, this one tasted the least like death..."
"It's not great, but when compared to other ice beers, Keystone Ice is one of the better ones. Taste, as with all ice beers is of lesser importance than low price and high alcohol content (12 pack = $5.99 with a 5.9% AV). You're getting a cheap buzz here and that's what ice beers are for. However, some do taste better than others. Keystone Ice is much better than say Natural Ice and Milwaukee's Best Ice (arguably the the worst ""beer"" I've had). Keystone Ice has no offensive smell, it actually is smooth, taste is corn, alcohol and the can, with an aftertaste that is popularly described as banana-like. I won't get into color, head or any appearance qualities because in my opinion ice beers should be left in the can or bottle they come in. Pouring them into a glass for further examination not only further reveals their cheapness, it actually can make them taste worse. It seems a little pointless to go into detail about ice beers. I doubt most of those that consume them regularly put much thought into it. Still, if you're going to buy one, you might as well get one you don't have to choke down."
"I Made the mistake of drinking 24 of these in a sitting not long ago, and that is a mistake I will not be making again anytime soon. However, as far as ice beers, this one tasted better than most I have tried."
"This is definitely a one of for me as I don't think I'd buy this again even if all the craft brews suddenly disappeared."
"This can of ice beer pours a yellow color and has a poor white head. The nose is of grainy malt and stale bitter hops. The taste is super light with some corn in there. Body is watery and over carbonated. This stuff is quite similar to Keystone's other beers. They are all equally bad."
"what do you expect for the price? Not the worst beer I've ever had, though, and if you like the taste of alcohol itself, go for it."
"Verdict: A cheap college beer, one whose only purpose is to fuel 2:00AM Beer Pong games."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly tolerable for a cheap, canned macro lager. You can't spell ""nice"" with i-c-e, baby!"
"A while back had Keystone Light, so when I was offered a can of their Ice, decided to give it a go... this one is noticeably sweeter than the lighter version... a certain gasoline-sweetness pours through, and the decent 5.9% ABV for a macro wasn't bad either... Not the best American selection for the style, but not too horrible either... appearance and smell were not impressive at all, and the taste got a slight boost for the apparent sugar element... mouthfeel was oily, and drinkability was average at best for this style's representation... Not bad for the money, but there is much better to choose from..."
"Overall an unappetizing macro that I won't be drinking again."
"Not so much a beer as an alcohol delivery system. It's not undrinkable. In fact it's not unobectionable in terms of quality as it sets out to do what it's meant to do, but there's not much point to drinking it either, unless you feel you are in need of an alcohol delivery system and nothing else. I suppose it fills a niche for fratboys who want to tell themselves that they're a badass for drinking a beer that's nearly 6% alcohol."
"Tough to review."
"I feel that I have a cast iron palate when it comes to drinking beer. I almost exclusively drink High Gravity Lagers because it has the most bang for the buck. I would prefer to drink quality micro beers and imports but they are too expensive to drink regularly. I would consider myself somewhat of a beer connoisseur. I can drink rot gut vodka straight without any problems but yet I would have to say Keystone ice is one of the most repulsive beers I have ever tried. The first time I ever tried it I can honestly say I thought it could possibly be contaminated or something like that and considered contacting the Brewery. I tried it months later and the results were the same! The taste is very metallic and chemical. You know its beer only by the faint hint of fermented grain. Anyone who says this is an OK beer is a liar!"
"This beer is a beer for the ages. The extremely pale yellow color is not very appetizing and the smell is kind of pungeant. Not very much of anything good going on here except the price. Real cheap and it will get you drunk very fast. The mouthfeel is alot like Keystone Light - it is really flat and could use more carbonation to make it better. As for it's drinkability, it is not drinkable at all. It hurts going down and does not make me want any more. The black can is pretty cool though..."
"Could drink a good amount of these if you can handle the taste"
"This beer is a light yellow, clear with little head. I gave it a three for appearance because the active carbonation in my Larry The Cable Guy pilsner glass is entertaining if nothing else. The smell is corny and as I have noticed before in a few brews, the smell of machined cast aluminum is present. The taste is corn, rice and a slight hint of vanilla. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. This beer, as is most of the style, is easy to drink and non-filling. A lot of people bash this style but I for one think it has a place. 12 of these would be no challenge on a night of camping."
"D - Not bad. I probably won't buy this again now that I've reviewed it. If I want and ice beer to chug on a hot day I'll take Icehouse over this...unless I see a 24 ozer for 99 cents again!"
"The can tells me that Keystone Ice is 'always smooth'. I beg to differ. The mouthfeel isn't full enough to be smooth and the flavor is one of the rockiest, most gut-wrenching rides that I've taken in quite some time. My suggestion is that if you find yourself with no other choice, make sure the can is ice cold. On second thought, put the sucker in the freezer until it actually turns to ice... and then throw it away. Nothing is going to make it easier to get this one down."
"Not much flavor here, maybe recommend at summer outings where the goal is to get bit fast, but that's about it, look for flavor from Milwaukee's Best Ice that at least tastes macro beer a bit with some flavor and will get you just as tipsy."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"If what you want is to get a buzz it is goood for that. I have had alot of beers. This isin't best but the effect is good. I guess if you are in a financial strap hold go for it there is nothing much to say about it. I like that i can get 30 stones and pay like 15 bucks for them."
"Keystone Ice pours a typical macro yellow with a fluffy white head from a sixteen ounce can. Smell is a cross between musty and estery at first, then just corn. Tastes like corn, but considerably worse than a typical macro. It has some off flavors, that I can't really identify. Bad. Can you say drain pour?"
"If worse comes to worse, and you're stuck with a selection of mass produced beers, grab a 12-pack of Keystone Ice. You'll survive until your next trip to the specialty shop"
"Bottom line, if you are on a budget and need to get your buzz on, this will do the trick. Don't drink this one for the flavor, but for the effect."
"Overall i'd say one of the better of it's kind (ice crap). One thing that i find interesting is the can says ice brewed ale... what the hell does that mean???? This is one i dont really care to have much at all, but in all honesty, for the price and knowing how other beers of it's like taste, it aint so bad."
"Poured a pale yellow color with large white puffy head. Good retention, but almost no lacing to be found. Smell is slightly sweet but virtually nothing else. Taste in so minimal as to be non-existant. Finish is ciold and refreshing. Too strong to be a spacer, but not a bad all around beer."
"Sort of reminds me of beer."
"This is a beer to drink to get drunk, not to enjoy. It is by far the best ice beer I have had to date. It doesn't have that ""cheep vodka added"" flavor that most ice beers have. Buy this over Bud Ice. It's cheaper and better tasting. The high taste and mouthfeel numbers are because this is being ranked against similar style beers. If it was against all beers I would probably give it a 1.5 total."
"I read all of the comments from college students saying why they buy bad beers. I usually drink bad beers because my Dad offers them to me, and I don't want to offend him, so I accept them. Keystone Ice is pretty rough. It tastes like aluminum foil. It smells like corn, rice, and aluminum foil. It looks pale yellow and fizzy (I guess, I actually drank it from the can). There is some alcohol in there, so I guess it really is beer, just not good beer. Has a grainy, metalic, blood-like finish. Just a weak flavor and harsh texture."
"This is not a beer for beer drinkers, pseudo-aficionados, poseurs, whoever... This is a beer for people who want cheap inebriation, but for whaterver reason don't want malt liquor. I don't know what it looks like, because nobody who buys this stuff would pour it into a glass. Lightly hopped, it has the mouthfeel of water that has been lubricated with the syrup of unfermentable sugars. I will say that it doesn't taste at all alcoholic and at almost 6%ABV it doesn't taste like it. All you have to do is walk around a college town after a football game and see empty cans of Keystone Ice lining the streets to understand what kind of brew this is."
"Came in a cool skinny can, silver and black. A very streamlined beer drinking experience when enjoyed from the can. I came into the room with this poured in a glass though and my dad asked me if i had pissed in the glass. Doesn't taste as quite as bad as piss though. This pours a pee yellow with no head. The armoa is sorta chemically but besides that barely detectable. The taste is nothing special, it is what you would expect from an ice beer. This one is very inoffensive. I would only drink this when i wanted to get smashed though, nothing in the area of taste here that can be enjoyed. The mouthfeel was blah. Fairly drinkable."
"A heavier version of its light brother. Poured out to a medium yellow color with medium high carbonation. No head to speak of, dissipated quite fast. Odors of chemical and malt were noted, as was a scent of alcohol that hung around. Flavor was minimally tolerable, with overtones of corn, water and alcohol. For an Ice beer, i guess its ok, but i'd much rather have a Schlitz or Coors."
"When I got home and took my first sip I was pleasanty suprised. This was a damn smooth tasting brew. Quenched my thirst for damn sure, for both a buzz and literally. I recommend this brew for anyone after a cheap beer that tastes decent. A hell of a lot better than most other macro-lager's, and a better price."
"I rate these kind of beers compared to the others in the category, and with regards to its true purpose, catching a tasty buzz. You probably know about what to expect, pale yellow, adjuct laden, ice beer taste. That being said this is one of the ""better"" tasting brews of this style. Or shoud i say its not as bad as the others."
"This is not drinkable for me..a drain pour..if you must have a horribly cheap ""ice "" beer go for Icehouse."
"pours out of the can a golden straw colour with an artificial thin foamy head and sparse lace. aroma is more of the that fruit like banana....not unlike a box of fruit loops. some mild adjuncty graininess, too. medium spritzy mouthfeel...somewhat watery and minerally. taste is ghost like graininess, and a hint of alcohol. nothing else. this is better than keystone premium but still pretty bad compared to other ice brews. double blech."
"Not a lot going on here, but if you want to go slumming, go with Keystone Ice, you wont go wrong."
"An embarrasing beer with no promise. I will never buy a 30 pack again. I should have myself commited for buying one as it is."
"For $5.09 for a twelve pack of this stuff, hell you can't beat that. I'm a college student and that price is comparable to Natty Ice. And to be honest, I think I would take Keystone Ice over Natty Ice just about any day. Probably one of the decent tasting cheap beers out on the market for us college students right now."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with almost no head at all. The aroma is weak and bitter with a slight malt scent. The taste is awful. It is watered down and skunky with a mildly refreshing finish. There is little malt flavor here. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with too much carbonation. This beer is good I guess if you're low on funds. Otherwise I'd stay away from it. It's one and done for me."
"Sinkability  I was going to dump this in the sink except I was concerned about causing a major environmental catastrophe, so I took it to the local sanitary land fill where they charged me extra to dispose of it professionally. I think its buried about three or four feet deeper than the radioactive cones from a destroyed nuclear site."
"Pours a crystal clear, yellowish/light straw gold with a foamy bright-white head that drops almost immediately to just a collar. The aroma is quite limited but offers some dull, sweetish ""malt"" if you seek it out. The body is light with a fine carbonation that's quite crisp in the mouth. The flavor is limited as well, but offers a clean, subtle, adjunct/malt character. It finishes exceptionally clean and drying with a delicate note of sugary maltiness that lingers shortly in the aftertaste. There's not much real beer flavor here. In fact, it's almost like a beer flavored malternative. Not worth trying."
"This beer doesn't really qualify as having color. There are different shades of transparent, including the head, and that clear part beneath the head. There is no smell other than the container. There is very little taste, but several feelings. Its dry, crisp, and unobtrusive. You hardly realize you're getting full, and hardly realize you should be making your way to the bathroom."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce aluminum can, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"This stuff is still better than Natural Ice (ugh), and is probably better than most ice beers, but I still can't recommend this stuff. Get it if you're flat broke and need a buzz, not if you're on a budget and looking for a halfway decent beer."
"Some say this beer takes them back to fond memories of 'college and high school drinking days'. I only hope and pray that I never find myself doing the same thing with this or a similiar brew."
"This beer will get you through some rough times when you have a taste for a beer and you either don't have anything else in the basement or you only have a few $$ in the wallet.  I keep a few around for an emergency.  If you poured this beer in a glass next to most of the other beers in its class you could not see the difference as far as appearance."
"This is one nasty beer.  Pours out to the typical, average golden color we are all used to in regards to beer of this type.  It has a funky grainy taste, with a disgusting sweetness to it.  A drain pour.  It was that bad."
"Even at 99c (for a 24oz. can) I would avoid this crap.  A complete flop almost completely undrinkable dont let it warm up at all I hope this is a fad that goes away."
"I see I am writing the first review for this beer, and I can't say I am surprised. I have never seen this beer anywhere near where I live, I only happened upon a 12-pack in Northern New Hampshire. If you do actually drink this stuff, dont expect anything different from any other american ice beer. It is strictly for messing up your mind and tasting like crap. Enjoy!"
