"pretty good brew. Recommend it"

"A smooth beer with a nice clear appearance. This is an easy inoffensive brew that will do when required"
""
""
"A decent beer if you are just hanging with some buds."
""
""
"Good with a few sunflower seeds at a hot baseball game."
""
"Overall-  This is a macro, but a really good macro to me.  I prefer this beer in bottles and i hear quite often the cans have a metallic aftertaste.  Try a bottle and see what you think."
"Love the taste and easy to drink if you want to get drunk"
""
""
"This works for me."
"Poured two fingers frothy head, fair retention and some spotty lacing. Head maintains a film all the way down. Very light golden color, very clear. Light banana aroma, not picking up much else. Not very flavorful. Tastes like a decent balance of sugar and bitterness. Also tasting banana, but not much else. Very straightforward, much expected from a large brewery. Feels watery, and lacks any grit or tack. Almost oily quality. Overall, easy to drink, but lacking in complexity. I like to keep some in fridge for when I want to catch a buzz, but can no longer appreciate a more decent beer. Boo for use of GMO corn, but can't expect much else from cheap beer. At least it doesn't give me a headache like other macrobrews."
""
""
"This is one of my favorites. It's light, refreshing and tastes like a good beer. It's not overpriced. I just Coors would push it more around here, Philadelphia. It isn't commonly found in bars and restaurants. Coors Light is literally everywhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"coors is just awful, imho."
""
""
"One of the better macros.  Very smooth and quaffable."
""
"Very good beer out of this category. Great taste and rounded out body. Tastes like what you dreamed coors light should taste like."
"Good summer beer in a poor; drink a lot kinda way."
"Served in a Pilsner glass"
"2.62/5: Not wretched, and decent for BMC standards"
"Better than High Life. Not as good as Bud. Commercial and consistent"
"Cheap beer has its time and place. 85% of the time I'm going to drink craft. The other 15%, this beer is my go to."
"nasty nasty nasty nasty nasty"
"I don't know why I avoided the banquet beer for so long. This is the smoothest american macro of the bunch. Great taste, goes down easy, and has a pleasant aftertaste. Maybe Coors is on to something with this one.....this is a great goto beer."
""
""
""
"Much better than Coors Light I admit. Pours a golden yellow with a quickly dissipating head. A slight sweet aroma and taste which is refreshing with little bitterness. Not bad for a macro brew Pale Lager."
"A perfect example of a fine American beer."
""
""
""
"I think the main problem I have is it has a sweet flavor with a metallic finish. I guess that's all you need to know."
""
""
""
""
"You know Coors is for whores"
"Decent old school macro lager.  Grainy, full of adjuncts but classic."
""
""
""
"Better then bud, but that's like being the tallest midget."
""
""
"Better than Miller, Busch or Budweiser, but not much else.  Typical grainy mass brewed North American beer with no hops at all, nothing exciting or exceptional."
""
"Crystal clear golden well-carbonated body with a white head. Sweet corn, grain, bread and lightly fruity nose & taste. Light bodied & clean."
""
""
""
""
"Exactly what you expect from American Adjunct Lager style. Pours a clear light yellow body with a small white head.  Aromas are scrubbed of anything interesting except for a hint of grain and chem-lab memories. Flavors of light grain and a touch of chamomile are weak and sheepish. Feels light and crisp, its mouthfeel being its most redeeming quality."
""
"O- When looking at this beer from a background of Craft Beer, Coors is about as low as you can get. It is uninteresting in about every aspect. Despite that crutch, it's non offensive and that's the point. It's a beer for the masses. It's a crisp and clean taste that is extremely refreshing."
""
""
"Not bad on New Years eve"
""
"Splash thin and watery. No body. Never understood the mystique when it was unavailable east of the Mississippi."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall its a 2.00, terrible."
"I am not sure why, but Coors has a mystique for this Canadian kid. I clearly remember what a big deal it was when Coors came to Alberta in the 1980s. For whatever reason, it disappeared until the last couple of years. It amazes me that people pay nearly $30 for a dozen Banquets in Alberta. For a mass produced lager, this is as good as it gets. It looks like beer, smells like a vegetable garden, and has a surprisingly refreshing taste. This batch cost me $21 for a 30 pack, so I'm planning to make it last for the rest of the month. A Coors a day keeps the doctor away?"
""
"For a macro brew, this holds its own, with a crisp taste that doesn't feel as watered down as other 24 pack contemporaries in the grocery aisle. It would complement a cheeseburger on a hot day."
"Drinkable mildly strong lager slightly smooth and curry"
"Straight up water... an all time classic."
""
""
"Just a plain beer from a big brewer"
"This is what people should drink instead of coors light or bud."
""
"Overall, an average beer.  Nothing special but not anything I would turn down.  I will not seek this out but if it is all I can get, Ill take it."
""
""
"Not to shabby liked it heaps"
"I think this beer is very common."
"Like drinking bad tasting water"

"My main beer. Good ol rocky mountain koolaid. Best beer in my eyes. I drink my craft and many micros, but this is my main beer of choice and always will be. This and coors light. Or Coors Extra gold. Any of those 3."

"Crisp, lightly bittered and not too lean, Coors has just enough personality to keep things interesting. Though there are many derisive stories of its manufacturing process, while it surely  takes a slammin' from the craft community; the bottom line is that this brew delivers oceans of decent thirst quenching beer enjoyment at a fearless price point. Certainly one of the better mass macros out there!"
""

"Nothing. No body, precious little flavor. Highly worthless beer. Would never buy, (Don't get me started on Coors Light.)"

"Exactly what I expect from a AAL; light golden color and a fleeting head.  The smell and taste are grains with just a hint of hops.  Decent enough carbonation and mouthfeel and a very clean, neutral finish.  Great after cutting the yard and raking leaves on a warm fall day."
"Overall it's fine...I mean that's the goal of all the macro beers...to be the same all the time.  It's good and it's available and I buy it when I don't want to blow the beer budget on craft.  I buy it but I don't feel that good about it...LOL"
"A good taste and flavor for what it is."
"So overall would recommend it ?? Damn yes !! This would be my first beer to go. Much better than those over beer who have 5 ABV. The price tag is a bit high compare to Budweiser or others.I would give a 4/5 if the price was a bit lower. But anyways still a fantastic beer. Go grab a pack if you can, I bet you, you won t be disappointed"
""
""

"Pleasant memories aside, rating Coors against craft beers would not be a fair comparison but among other similar tasting American Adjunct Lagers, Coors is a 3 star, ""just okay"" beer - no better, no worse... it's just okay."
"You can always relax with an ice cold Coors. Easily accessible. My local store has deals on them weekly. Not my first choice in beer. But if I'm on a budget it's no doubt my pick of the litter."

"not bad , if you got no better beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When it comes to getting a sixer at the local grocer or gas station you cannot go wrong with Coors Banquet."
"Overall:  Not all that good, but at the same time there's nothing really offensive about it.  If I'm going cheap, I'll look elsewhere but wouldn't turn down the classic banquet."

"This beer is okay. It's not my favorite, but it's the most likely beer that you can have around at a party with all your friends that everyone will like. Other beers you could probably serve at your party: Miller Lite, Budweiser, Some Regional Macro Beer, PBR (in certain company). It's just an all around a-okay beer."

"An all-American, 5% abv, tried and true wonder, Coors Banquet is my flagship, east or west of the Rockies."
""
"This beer was ok. It was not one of my favorite beers. To me it made me feel full I do not know why it just did. It had a strong aroma to it as well. Their was a decent amount of head to this beer as well. It was a decent beer. I am glad that I tried it though."

"Nothing special going on. Foam is weak and dissipates very quickly , mouth feel is weak. Flavor is subtle but not objectionable. Appearance is a clear straw yellow, a little deeper than Bud. Not bad for when I want a light tasting beer on a hot summer day."
"For a fairly cheap drink, I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer the way it used to be made. Could drink it all night long. Doesn't even compare to most cheap beers in its class. If your starved for cash this stuff won't let you down. And If but the throwback 1939 bottles you won't even have to talk to the hot women, they will talk to you!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer. Not what I like to drink everyday. But my choice when I want to go fishing or when I want to switch it up with a cheap beer. One of the best of the AAL's. An American classic. Better than many beers that cost more."

"I like this beer a whole heck of a lot. It's always a toss up for me to get either a bunch of Coors or a bunch of Bud. I get excited when it is available at a bar on the east coast which is kinda tough even though Coors Light is usually available everywhere. The stubby bottles are great but I often get 30 packs of the cans. The only downfall when drinking this wonderful beer is that I fart more than beloved Budweiser. Go getcha' some Coors!"

"OK. I know everyone is so eager to sh*t on this beer, but what I'm rating is not the can (1 of 30) you bring to frat row at UMass Amherst. This sample is straight from the brewery. During tour of the brewery at Golden, CO they had us sample some of the beer coming straight from the source. It was crisper and much more fresh tasting (obviously) than that swill you buy to drown your consciousness on the cheap. Somewhere between the brewery and your local Kappy's, this decent ale degrades significantly into under-the-table beer."

"Coors aka Coors Banquet brewed by Coors Brewing Company. This brew has an abv of 5.0. The brew pours out a nice golden color with a thick white head. To me this is how brew should look. It is not to light in color and not to dark. The smell rich with flavor, also smells like beer. The taste is rich and smooth. There is nothing bad about this brew. Coors has a nice clean finish. This brew has a real nice balance to taste and smoothness. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. Coors is a good drinking brew, and a classy brew at that. This is how beer should be. Not overly light and not so alcohol taste that you can not enjoy the brew. Over all I'm giving Coors a 4.25 out of 5."

"Overall: I didn't judge this beer too harshly because it is intended to be exactly what it is. It's a beer meant for mass consumption. Not necessarily for taste. That being said it isn't a bad beer for a hot summery day after doing some moving or lawn work or just working hard in general. In general when you buy this type of beer you pretty much already know what you've gotten yourself into, a beer that isn't intimidating and complex, but not too bad either."

"Overall: This was my second highest rated AAL below PBR. This one is still a pretty bad beer, however, and has redeeming qualities of being dirt cheap and easy to drink in volume."
""
"O- As far as innocuously flavored macro lagers go, this isn't horrible. Accomplishes what it's intended to accomplish."

"Final Thoughts: The ""Banquet Beer"" as it's currently being advertised here offers a revelation to it's name. How many Banquets have you been to, where the food alright or good but certainly wasn't exceptional? Myself, not a lot as the cooks generally need to make enough food quickly for everyone. See the parallel on this one? So Coors is an alright beer, but if not for being a large producer whose name you cannot escape, it is a rather unremarkable beer. It's certainly not an unquaffable brew, but really this beer exemplifies a just plain average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed it, one of the first beers I ever had and its amazing that I use to think this beer was hard to drink because now for as much as I have learned, this beer is crisp and really light relatively speaking. Not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm pissed that I payed a buck a can for this. Buy subpremium brands. This difference between this and PBR is minimal. PBR sucks, but so does this beer. At least try to get what you pay for."
""
"Coors Banquet Beer which is also known as Coors Original is decent big brand beer that competes well with Miller and Budweiser products. It pours real pale yellow, very little head (soapy in appearance), and the carbonation dissipated real quick. Surprisingly, there was no metallic taste with this beer, it is watery, and has a malty, corn taste. It is not filling and goes good with food. Nothing sets it apart from other big brands, other than it is the last wholly own big brand company because Miller (SABMiller) and AB (InBev) are both foreign controlled."

"Note: Back in 1983 I went down south to work with my brother in Virginia at the age of 19. I worked as a carpenter. Each day I would get dropped off at a job site and I work in 90+ heat with only luke warm water to drink from a garden hose. Every night I was picked up by my boss and he have a ice cold 6-pack of Coors to drink. Beer never tasted so good! I guess any beer would of tasted good under those conditions. That was the first time I thought beer tasted good. I have come a long way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"In all seriousness though, it's not one of the worst AAL's I've had, and at least it's not a light. Smells of sweet corn, but doesn't have too much of an adjunct funk to it. It's pretty smooth, and doesn't have an aftertaste. If you've had Molson Canadian, this is extremely similar to it, although this one is a little nicer. I'm not going to comment on hop and malt content. There isn't much, especially to a newly destroyed palate like my own. Enough rambling. If you like AALs, you'll like this one. Try it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer to serve freeloaders that come to your house to drink. It is cheap, and when served ice-cold, it masks the straw corn sour taste of the malt. Pours a big bloated foamy sudzy white head, that once drank, develops your bowels into a a big bloated gas pocket causing you to fart the rest of the night in your bed, and then fart more in the morning. Coors is known for it big gas!!! Yippy!!!"

"In the summer, this is one of my go-to beers- it is relatively common, usually fairly cheap and comes in cans- good for camping, fishing and rafting. I honestly don't think Coors is as good in a bottle. A can of this is a real delight when the beer is ice cold and you are broiling hot- just what this type of beer is made for. It has way more flavor and a little more body than a Coors Light, which for some reason is extremely popular around here. It goes really well with grilled meat."

"For the style this is rather good and in my opinion does not get enough credit for an American Adjunct."
""
""
""
""
"Coors has so much more flavor than any other macro beer. The bros like miller high life and PBR better than coors! They gave Budweiser an 80! Coors is a great everyday beer and saddened that no one likes it. Mild cooked cabbage? All in all coors is a good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Can: Poured a golden color lager with a medium bubbly white head with minimal retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light adjunct notes with light sweet notes. Taste is quite bland with light sweet adjunct notes that are noticeable. Body is light with good carbonation. Nothing shocking here and probably better then Coors Light but still incredibly bland at the end of the day."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of the best American Adjunct Lagers I know of. Its certainly ok. Nothing is really off with this beer. A good beer for what it is and is very drinkable in quantity. With 5 percent ABV, its a good backyard BBQ beer and one good for camping other other outdoor activities. Coors Light sucks but this Banquet beer is ok for what it is and certainly beats Miller, Budwiser, etc. Its a good beer to drink with people who do not appreciate craft beer when you are doing the buying. ;)"

"Overall - boring but not offensive"
"Though on the thinner side, there's actually a little bit to this beer. The body is light but not terribly watery, considering. It doesn't have as much of the crispness as these beers seem pride themselves on, but a little more of the smoothness."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a straw-yellow in color with a 1+-finger foamy head that doesn't hang around too long. Some light spotty lacing was seen. The aroma is of just some grain and corn but nothing else really. The taste is a little 'watery' with just a slight sweet aftertaste. High carbonation. Overall, a decent brew for during the warmer months."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light golden color, lighter than most adjunct lagers, head is white and dissipates quickly. Smell is faint, banana bread and grass notes predominate. Slightly malty taste, with hints of banana. The powerful carbonation functions like a palate cleanser, clearing most tastes. Mouthfeel is weak with some malty after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Mediocre, but better than some AAL options. Not sure why I picked this up, I think a friend of mine was saying how good it was. For what it is it's drinkable but nothing that BA's will be even close to impressed with."
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is malts/adjunct sweetness and mild tartness.  The flavor is sweetish malts, light fruit and a tart finish.  One of the few macros that are decent."
""

"Smoother than most, nice bubbles. Thank God, can you imagine if it was thick with that shit."

""

""
""
""

""
""
"Pours an uber-pale straw color with a large amount of white foam, and although the carbonation starts in classic overpowering US macro-lager fashion, I find that it dissipates quickly with this beer and reaches a more manageable level. Aroma is sweet for an adjunct lager, with a lot of corn and some subtle hop extract that veers towards the fruity. Palate is rounded cornflake sweetness, a touch of green weedy hops, a hint of butter, and some harsh notes that recall a chemical sweetener like aspartame. Body is thin and soda-like as per the style but finish is less astringent than rice adjunct beers like Bud. My ratings might be a tad higher than deserved but Coors is probably the best in a bad bunch of industrial lagers and at least this one has more flavor than many mainstream Euro pale lagers or American adjunct counterparts. I try to keep my ratings relative. Coors Light is awful, devoid of flavor and meriting no consideration. Coors proper isn't a must-try but you might be surprised by how drinkable it is in quantity, and no one wants to empty their beer fridge of superior craft offerings during a binge episode."

""
"Mouthfeel - Very light, very smooth. Carbonation was lower than I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's better than Coors Light. I'll give it that. Pours a paler than piss yellow with a head that starts off two fingers and within two minutes turns to soap suds. Smells grainy, with a hint of bread. Tastes a little bit like sourdough, which is quite surprising. Not that it tastes like sourdough, but that it has any taste at all. Mouthfeel is thin, water and overcarbonated. If it were cheap at a bar, I'd drink it over the standard fair. But if I'm at a bar, chances are, I'm drinking double ryes."

"Final Grade: 3.29, a high C+. Coors Banquet Beer is easily one of the better macro adjunct lagers available on the market right now. While I have little doubt that the usual BA set will pooh-pooh this brew as a matter of habit, the fact remains that it is still a highly quaffable, moderately tasty pale lager that I would never turn down (as opposed to Coors Light, which you would need to pay me to consume). I'd take this over most of the comparable lagers available in this province - certainly long before I'd consider picking up a Budweiser, Labatt Blue, or most other 'premium' (snort) brands."

"Much better than Coors Light, Coors is actually a really good beer. Yes, I did just say that! But when you are looking to go out on the lake and have a great time, Coors should always beat out Bud and MGD. The beer is a light color, the aroma is crisp and clean, pours a decent amount of carbonation and does not have a battery acid taste that its peers do. A good beer when you are low on cash and options!"

" The flavor is decent with some gentle corn pop flavor but in general it is clean and refreshing the only real gripe is the minimal amount of malt flavor but it is not that offensive and is pretty crisp flavor-wise. Overall I don't find this to that bad of an example of the style, not my favorite type of beer, but perhaps if you are having a bowl of spicy chili or some extremely hot wings it would not be a bad choice since it is pretty mild and refreshes the palate with moderate but not overdone effervescent quality."

"The classic ""Banquet Beer"" may not be an earth shattering macro, but it is crisp, refreshing and would be perfect for summer cookouts. This is definitely a step or two better than your average American adjunct lager."

"Another mega brewing lager that taste just like the last... Actually.. you let this one sit in the can long enough it will start to taste like metal... Which might be an upgrade. The color is a nice clear light yellow. Smell flavor and mouth feel are all disgusting... However... if your at a tail gate... I would rather drink beer-water then a stout... I just hope these mega brewers create a good beer... Wishful thinking?"

"Atmosphere is okay. Solid head, no real lacing. Nose is very light grain, hop, combo. Light flavor components consisting of hay, malt, hops, and something sweet in the background. Overall, this is serviceable at best."

"Poured this 24 oz can into a pint glass.

The aroma consisted of faint notes of grain and just a touch of floral hops. Light in body, this brew has a foundation of adjunct ingredients, corn, minerals and lemon citrus. Mouthfeel was crisp and clean. Overall for the style its not worst adjunct lager out there."

Easy drinking light beer that you can BBQ with sit back have a couple dozen on a hot summer's day, the type of beer if you are doing a lot of shots with friends you can do chasers with all night long.

"For taste I had a love/hate relationship at first. To me it had an odd aftertaste to it which was unique. Nowadays though Coors has a very refreshing taste to me. Not much sounds better to me than popping a cold Coors after a long day of work. In the mouth it its very balanced and refreshing. Overall Coors Banquet beer is in my top 10 and will probably always be my go-to beer for years to come."
"This inexpensive American classic can't be stopped. Though it's available in a bottle and on tap(rarely found in my part on the woods), you just can't beat it in a can. When served in an ice-cold can, Coors is truly an enjoyable brew. Just pop the top, punch a hole in the top, and let it flow. For a day on the beach, forget the Silver Bullet, and reach for the 'Original'."
""
""
"Here I have a Coors (original), not too bad. Opened a bottle from a 6-pack. purchased cold and consumed very cold. The best out of the adjuncts in my opinion. This beer has been enjoyed a many night in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado. I've toured the famed Coors Brewery in Golden, witnessed the river flowing into their operation, indeed flowing out of the mountains. Driven by many of cold mornings, seeing the brewery in full swing with mass production. My point is, this beer is the flagship of Adolf Coors and his legacy. I'm sure it's been watered down and modified for mass production and distribution since its original inception years ago. So we have the modern day Banquet beer, as it were. It is what it is, Coors present tense. Still my favorite sessionable adjunct American Lager. Pound them down cold. Not for everyone."
""
""
"Arguably the best of the macros, I kept this on my porch during a blizzard. Its Coors, its meant to be enjoyed cold, and sucked down rather quickly. No hops presences, almost a syrupy flavor, but one thats actually pleasing. Whether or not you like it, you have to agree that it tastes like SOMETHING, which is sadly more than you can say about its competition. One of those classic cookout beers, you can drink a ton without feeling sick. Coors has tried to step up their game as of late with Third Shift and Batch 19, and in hindsight, Coors banquet ain't so bad. Just don't expect a new ""usual"""

The flavor severely worsens as this one warms up - needs to be drank very cold."

Coors Banquet is an exception."

"This is one of the most underrated beers I have had. It is one of the old standbys, especially if you are going to drink a few of them. The color is golden typical of an AAL, the smell is sweet, kind of grainy but not overly sweet, it has a crispness to the smell, clean. The taste is smooth and has a clean carbonated mouthfeel. This is not thing really surprising to the style, but as this is one of the first good mass produced beers I have ever had, it has a special place in my memories. Although I like to try a variety of beers nowadays, this one is one I will go back to on a hot summer night, you know during the beer drinking weather! Overall one of the better beers out there for the price and pretty remarkable for such a large conglomerate to be able to produce such a quality beer so consistently."

"What can be said? Honestly. To me, pretty much all adjunct lagers taste the same. They have that corny/malty taste, and a corny/sweet aftertaste. Coors isn't an awful beer, but c'mon. It's not a beer you drink to drink... this is a beer to drink for cheap and get drunk on, plain and simple. I can say that it's slightly better than Budweiser, as it doesn't have an EXTREMELY corny and skunk-like taste, but it's still nothing to be proud to drink."
""
"Overall - I can drink this all day, but not because it's good. It's so damn watery and flavorless that it's literally like drinking water with a hint of sweetner. In that sense, I like it better than Budweiser, but as a beer, it's virtually non-existent. For that reason, it's fairly tricky to score, because I probably like it slightly better than my score presents. I also love water. If this were waterybeeradvocate.com, this beer would get a near perfect score, but in the grand scheme of things, it's below average at best."

"this is no cowboy classic, this is crap. watered down yellow pee looking adjunct brew that only leaves you with a few extra bucks in your pocket and a hangover for the ages. this is for the birds. weak extracty malt nose, metallic taste, minneraly and off in the finish, a little sweet, and oddly grainy in feel. its got too much carbonation, not enough body, and is highly lacking in the tradition and western values it seems to have built its reputation on. is it better than a coors light? maybe in certain circumstances, but in isolation, this is a terrible beer and i would much prefer to not drink than to drink this 9 times out of 10."
""
""
""
""
"Slightly better looking and tasting than some adjunct lagers, yet there's nothing else really going for this beer. It would be easy to confuse this adjunct lager with any other beer of the same style in a blind-taste test. And that's exactly why, in my opinion, many beers of this style garner such relatively low ratings -- there's very little, if anything, to set this beer apart from its peers."

"I used to like this before I got into craft beer but now I don't know what I saw in this."

"Pours a clear, slightly pale amber color with almost no head. Scent is weak with cheap grassy grains, and corn. There taste is rather decent for a cheap domestic beer with thorough bold grainy flavors. Sorry but like most cheap beer I can never seem to find the hops and only a slight bit of malts. It has a decent flavor and an ok volume, one of the better tasting cheap beers along with Pabst. To say the least, I would drink this any day over Coors Light."
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and a distinct popcorn aroma. Taste is much the same with a sweet finish. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that is only drinkable when it’s super cold."
""
""
"Note: I review for the style. I refuse to let my prejudices slant any review. Nothing worse than the typical beer snob reviewing an AAL, same for your AAL drinker reviewing a craft brew."

"A good clean not over carbonated lager. They don't use sugar and carbonation to cover up low end brewing techniques like the biggest American brewery does. Coors banquet has a real lager beer taste , very clean and balanced. As far as macro brews go I prefer Coors Banquet and Schiltz 60's formula. They taste like American beer should."

"O: For the cheaper beers, I would say this would have the advantage over the Miller's and the Buds. I didn't taste any of that metallic feel in it. I would have this again preferably with food. Just a typical average non-offensive AAL that can't compete with non BMC stuff (good for what it is)."
"D - For an AAL this isn't half bad. The profile seemed to provide something interesting that most other don't, and I'd rather this over Bud. But even then, I don't see myself revisiting this ever again, especially due to its availability."

Being pretty new to the beer scene I was unaware of this beer because I've always been so inundated with commercials for the light, but this is certainly a superior brew. Give it a try!"

"Footnote: There have been some posters that have wondered how Coors came up with the name ""Banquet Beer"" Heres how it happened .. IN 1936, COORS ADDS “BANQUET BEER” TO ITS NAME. AS LEGENDS GO, AREA MINERS WOULD THROW PARTIES DURING THE 1800S CALLED “BANQUETS”—STOCKED WITH REQUISITE COORS. THE ""BANQUET BEER"" BECAME A PART OF THE COORS’ NAME AS HOMAGE TO LIVELY GATHERINGS AND A WESTERN LEGACY."

""
"Overall: 3.5/5 and glad I got to try it. It is good."
"The beer tastes bready and slightly sweet from the corn. There is some hop bitterness on the back end, but it's a mild flavor. It's a clean tasting lager. The body is light with adequate carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high and this is refreshing. Overall, this is a good beer that does what it is supposed to do. It's a refreshing lager that has its place on a hot summer day, tailgates, or as a cheaper beer option while watching a game."

"Pours a pale straw yellow with a big white head that goes down rather quickly. Not much lacing on the glass. Aroma is of adjunct, corn and possibly some pungent hops.

"A bready brew. I prefer this over Budweiser because it has more flavor in both the malt and hop categories. The positive is that's its fairly smooth. The negative is the aftertaste, which is a little foul. Coors Light fans will be in for a surprise as this is much, much more flavorful. I prefer Coors Banquet in a bottle."

"Coors banquet is one of my favorite adjunct lagers. The appearance is golden colored with soapy, fizzy head--after the initial pour the head disappears but find it much less carbonated than other macros. Smell is slight lemon/banana and sweet grains, taste is sweet grains and very mild hops. To me the adjunct taste is rice, not corn dominant. Mouthfeel is creamy and refreshing, you can drink these all day long."

"If I had to drink a beer in this style I would probably choose Coors. It's not because it's overly flavorful or unique but because it avoids all of the off flavors associated with the style. It's not metallic nor does it have an apple-like off flavor from the yeast."
""

""
""
"This beer is really not too bad. Average looks and smell for a big commercial brewery product. The flavor is s step above OK. Bready, sweet, with a slight bitterness in the finish. More malty than hoppy. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Goes down very clean with a bit of sparkle from some powerful carbonation. No reason to say this beer is not good for it's pedigree. This leans towards the top of macro brews for sure."

"The beer poured a clear light golden color and produced a fizzy, white head that was not retained at all. Noticeable carbonation rising to the top of the glass. The beer gave off a light, grainy aroma. Not bad, but not all that good either. The taste followed the aroma, but I honestly thought it was a little better than expected. The beer had a light feel and it borders on over-carbonation. But I do have to say that the beer was smooth. Overall, a less than average beer, but a lot better than most in the style."

"Crystal clear gold with a short lived finger of white head, no lace and a spot of retention. Nose has some light corn and general malty grain sweetness. Taste is about the same with a sweet and almost faintly fruity malt, a hint of some red delicious apple flesh. High carbonation that bites, very light in weight. Quite watery. Although simple, this is wholly unoffensive I thought - a straight up AAL and something I might chance to option for in light of lesser offerings in the style. Overall score bumped up as function of superiority within the style."

"O - Just not a beer I would ever desire to drink. I truly tried to keep style in mind, but to be frank I would prefer a Budweiser to this. Hell, I'd take a Corona Extra over this if I could stick a lime in it. I still believe that the Japanese rice lagers are the best mass produced adjunct lager... Strictly in the American Adjunct style, I'd take most Caribbean lagers over most of their American counterparts."
"This is the adjunct lager I don't mind drinking as much as the others. Still has the 'cooked vegetables' taste that Coors Light has, but with more body, and more excusable grains to tolerate it, it's not as bad. Still, this is in the 'only drink because it's the lesser evil' category."

"overall never ever buy this beer. just wrong!"

"Served up in the classic yellow can. Aromas of bread and grain, with some dry fruit notes. Tastes of sweet fruit with mild citrus and bread. Very different flavor from the other two major brewer's; it's a lot sweeter but a bit more pleasant to drink. Goes down really smooth. On those occasions that my choices are this, Miller, or Bud-I'll go with this."
"Not much aroma, just grassy, grainy hints. Looks to be the typical adjunct lager, but it isn't skunky so that is a big plus for me. Not as watery as a light lager, still bland and lacking in hops but fits the style. Coors is a decent lager, nothing special though. Definitely finish this one while it is still cold."

"O - The drinkability here isn't so good. Sure it goes down like water, but the flavor is really lacking. There isn't really anything going on but a grainy sweetness and a corn-like flavor. The aftertaste also has some off flavors. Overall, It isn't really an offensive beer, but it really isn't very good. I do find it better than any of ABs Busch series beers."

"the appearance good,nice clear golden bubbly look,the head was unfortunately flat. The smell was somewhat lacking,had to really snort to get an odor. Mostly grassy sweet wheat odor,not much hop. The taste was subtle , was hoping for more richness,more satifaction. Overall not bad, like to try one with more alcohol,only 3.2% here,so not very fair to compare. I will continue to patron this company."

"O: Just your average light malty brew. On that scale, I wish I were drinking a Labatte."
"O - One for the ages. This beer will always remind me of certain things in life. It's not the best for the style, but it's still pretty damn refreshing when ice cold..."
"Overall this is a good beer and for the style and one of my favorites when I want to have more than a few."
"Overall this beer's ok. I'd still rather drink a Bud."
"poured from a 24oz can into a beer glass. The head was a bright white and foamy, the beer with a pale golden color. The taste of this canned beer has a kind of faint 'solvent' like taste with high carbonation. I dont remember the bottled beer version tasting like this, but I will retry that to confirm. This can beer is not that great to wash down food or drink upon cutting the lawn on a hot day."
"The appearance is your avearage like yellow color with a thick head. The smell is of straw and maybe corn. The taste is pretty like how it tasted with corn and some malt. The mouthfeel to me was much better than the other crappy beers and wasnt too terrible. The beer overall isnt horrible, but I would never spend money on it."
"Overall: Not as bad as I was expecting. sweet and fairly drinkable."
"My palate has come a long way since the mid 80s, but Coors had held up surprisingly well."
"Overall – I find that the coors and coors light beers both a have a distinctive taste that sets it apart from its competitors. I guess that the macro-drinkers either love it or hate it. Not something I'd buy again, but after having countless coors lights while growing up, it's nice to see what the non-light version tastes like."
"A run of the mill brew, fit only for drinking after a few quality brews Unimpressive color smell and taste, it reminds me of drinking seltzer with a hint of yeast. It does have a very light tingly palate making it good fair for big picnics, BBQs or a day at the beech."
"That being said, for mass-produced cheap beer, this is about as good as it gets."
"Poured a 3"" velvety white head. Light clear straw yellow color and very few body bubbles so it appears all the carbonation went to that early head pour. Smells mildly of grain. Taste is like mildly sweetened water. In fact that's what this is, water dressed up to look and smell like any BMC beer. Plus that ""2 stage cold activation"" bottle label is a joke. Who needs help telling if their bottle is cold, why not just feel it? Oh wait, you're supposed to drink this so ice cold you can't really taste anything (?) Ohhh. Then make a better beer instead of a better label."
"O- another terrible beer from a Macro..."
"A fair lot better than its little brother, the only Coors brand currently available this side of the 49th parallel, but that's only saying so much. Still plain and stiff, but I give it props for the general lack of skunk. And even though I've finally sampled this, I suppose I'll never know if Joe the Cop was right in his assertion regarding the relative quality of Pawtucket Patriot Ale."
"Another standard american adjuct beer. The color is yellow and clear with good carbonation that results in a white foam head that dissapates quickly. Smell and taste are primarily grain with attempted balnace of hops, etc. The beer is easy drinking and light."
"Drinkability: A real disappointment. I have not had an “original” Coors in forever and expected much more. It is not offensive — almost, but not quite — but I suppose it would do well after working all day in the heat. Frankly, though, I think I would rather sip sarsaparilla with Sam Elliott."
"Overall Drinkability - Not really even decent for an AAL."
"Pours a typical fizzy, pale in color without much head. Tastes of grains, sweet malt and actually a fair amount of hops which give it a bit of bitterness to go with the sweet malts. Finishes crisp, dry and bitter. Fairly carbonated, but very smooth, I think the water is what really makes this beer stand out for me, it just tastes very pure."
"O: I've had worse."
"Pour yields a nice 1 finger head. At first I thought the color was a deep amber til I realized it was just so transparent I could see my desk top through but still it has a bright and bubbly golden yellow. Not to thin. Smell is kind of sharp and sour. Grassy and a bit of bitter hops shine through in the nose. The cereal and corniness is dumbed down and has quite a nice smell to it. Taste is initially somewhat bitter but disappears fast. Nice grassy and tart hops on the tongue. Compared to something like Summerfest it fails obviously although it they just amped up the flavor just a bit then it would come close. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and could use some work. Not as overcarbonated as most american adjuncts. Good summertime brew."
"Oh right, mouthfeel- starchy water"
"Overall for an American adjunct lager, it's decent but otherwise unimpressive. Needs some oomph that it's sorely lacking to make it anything I'd buy on its own merit."
"The Rest: Body is pretty thin; its not the worst of the macro lagers, but its definitely not the best."
"O-this is a beer you drink to get drunk because of its price and quantity you get for it...Would drink this at a party as a last resort but would never stock my fridge with this beer..."
"A lot better than Bud and Miller, also most Adjunct Lager I had."
"Average, average, average is all I can say. I think Coors (or whatever foreign company owns them these days) has put all their chips on Coors Light, a truly terrible beer (if you can even call it a beer) while regular (""Banquet"") Coors could do with a little marketing muscle. Better than Bud or MGD, nothing to write home about though, good when you've got a lot on your mind and want an easy quaff."
"but fwiw it does a good job at what i think the intention was"
"Well as far as one of the BIG 3 in the US. Coors is far and away the the best choice between Bud, Bud Light, Miller High Life or Miller Lite. This straw colored brew is quite good. I am not beer snob I will drink what I like when I like unlike some of the people I drink with. I know I take some shit from them from time to time for my picks in beer. Give Coors A shot butyou beer experts & beer snobs, know it all. Or you think you do. Just maybe it's A status thing with your craft brews. Thanks & See You, Steveo"
"Verdict: While Coors Banquet suffers from the same problems as the other beers in the style, it’s balanced better than much of its competition. Balance alone, however, is not enough to win the day."
"I will not be buying this again."
"Poured a 12oz can into pint glass, very light to medium light straw color, faint smell of sweet corn and slight alcohol. Sweeter than most mass produced, not bad, but not good either. Average beer, can go down VERY quickly, could do worse. Much much better than it's light counterpart . I will drink if available, but not going to make a special trip"
"overall, this beer is not too shabby."
"D - this was one of those 24oz'ers you can pick up at 7-11 for pocket change, and you could do worse for sure. if all you're looking for is a buzz and the general taste of beer, look no further"
"O- Very surprised just because Coors Light sucks so hard. Its a cheap beer I feel no embarassment purchasing."
"O - for an American Adjunct Lager it's an ""average beer"" and it's not any better than that."
"Once again with a Coors, the head looks very nice, but I can literally hear it fizzing away. The body is completely clear and yellow, it doesn't look any better than the Coors light, even though it gets a way better grade for some reason....the head is completely gone now. On the smell I pretty much get the same thing I do with the Coors light, adjuncts, small amounts of malt, no real hops to speak of. It smells sour as well, just like the Coors light did, the smell is pretty bad. One thing I do notice is that the flavor is a tiny bit bigger and the mouthfeel is also a tiny bit bigger than the Coors light, but for the most part it's the same exact taste and feel. Not comparing it to the Coors light - the mouthfeel is actually probably the most surprising part, it's not that bad, and the taste is bad, but like I said not bad as I thought. The mouthfeel though, is actually acceptable. Drinkability is a little better too, but it's not that great either, the mouthfeel makes it a little more bearable. Overall, obviously a bad beer, nothing too different from the Coors light, but it is better in some small ways, overall just a adjunct lager."
"Nose is of light grassy hops. Body is light and crisp. There are definitely some flavors in this brew: some light earthiness from hops and sweetness from grain. There is not much of a finish. In my opinion it is the best American macro. I finished a whole bottle."
"Coors Original in most ways is a pretty standard looking and tasting beer. The pour is golden yellow with a thin head that vanishes quickly. The aroma of this beer is a fresh sweet smell of grains. The taste backs up the smell with a little bit of a honey flavor in the aftertaste. This beer is much better than their light version. I wouldn't mind consuming this one at a party or something like that."
"Overall: A leader in comparison to certain peers, underappreciated"
"O: I was wondering why American Adjunct Lagers never receive an A, but after drinking this, they just are not that great. Very plain, but, if its hot out, empty stomach, and the beer is cold, drink it fast, it might be all-right."
"Overall impression- This is a beer I have had occasionally from time to time be it I occasionally reach for it as a cheap bargain or a friend or family member has it around. Its in offensive yet of course nothing stunning. Its certainly alot better then Coors Light and some of the competition in american adjunct lagers, this is a beer meant to be purchased for the reasons of value and session, an okay beer simply put"
"D- Despite the low number I gave on this it is actually one of my preferred beers when it comes to just sitting back and relaxing. Very drinkable."
"D- This has all the makings of drinkability. Its refreshing, crisp, nice flavor to it, and its pretty cheap. Good for those long days of drinking, or just for an easy beer."
"The Banquet Beer takes first place status in my book in the battle of BMC. Very good for its style."
"But, if I were to choose out of the BMC, this would be it. It has more flavor than budweiser or miller high life. It's crisp and refreshing. It's a satisfactory, cheap beer that's great to drink at summer cookouts."
"If I am going to drink a domestic big label, this is it. Coors original has enough flavor to please my palate. Even after a night of drinking six different Belgians, I can grab one of these to wash down the midnight munchies food and be decently satisfied."
"This is my favorite domestic beer to drink. Coors has a great flavor to it compared to budweiser or miller! I have never had it on top but would like to. Coors has a light crispness to it, a little better than budweiser! Trust me it isnt the best beer in the world but it does taste good."
"i would have one if that is what someone gives me ,or i`m short on money this month ,but i`ll stick to the richer smoother ale`s that i`ve been enjoying.."
"Verdict: Distinctive sweet taste for a macro. Nothing too outstanding about this beer but it does have a decent amount of flavor for a macro and I thought it was a decent lager. C- (2.65)"
"Pours a really clear yellow with a head that dissolves into literally nothing. Looks like a high alcohol beer because of the no head. I guess it doesn't matter with appearance of this beer since most people would just drink this out of the can or bottle anyways. I can smell some fruitiness which what smells like to me Belgian yeast strain with some very light wheat malt. The taste is crisp right up front with the wheat malt and belgian yeast combining together with a quick flash of hop which is so subtle its barely noticeable until it warms then it becomes slightly more noticeable. I can tell Coors makes Blue moon and uses the same yeast in that beer as it does this one same malt too. It's so drinkable its ridiculous though you could finish this beer so quickly. I almost think they dial back the flavor just so that you keep drinking it more and faster so you can let the flavor build up on your tongue more... which is the only way you can tell what flavors it has. You also get your typical corn smell and taste in this as well but not as much as other adjunct beers. I actually like this better than Budweiser regular and Miller because of that slight Belgian yeast fruitiness that it gives off combining with that pretty okay subtle wheat malt. I don't know why you'd drink Coors light when this is light and extremely drinkable enough. Definitely not horrible by any means. Get this if you want the best of the 3."
"p.p.s. rating really has nothing to do with my enjoyment of this wonderful beer. just marking the numbers the way they ought to be done per review. :)"
"If you like american lager such as budweiser you might enjoy this brew. The apperance is a light golden color. Smell of grain mostly not really much there for hops. The taste is very average for this type of brew, with a very light mouthfeel which leads to a superior drinkability especially when planning to some drinking. This beer will be a nice choice though kind of watery on taste it is not filling at all in my opinion. I would recommend this beer to anyone throwing a party and wants a decent beer at a decent price. I would still prefer to drink budweiser same ABV% and to me a much taster lager."
"Pours like a typical yellow fizzy beer - pale yellow, fizzy head without great retention or lacing. Smell actually is much cleaner than Bud, Canadian or Blue. Some grain malt in the smell, but no hops at all. A bit of bitterness in the finish, though overall mild. I'd drink this again in a similar situation, but I have no real plans to have it."
"A solid offering from the Coors Brewing Company. Coors Banquet is the best of the big three. It has a full, well rounded flavor. I would highly recommend this to anyone, as it is a cut above Bud or Miller. I enjoy craft beer and have a palate for extreme flavors, and this obviously is not a craft beer or anything extreme in terms of flavor, but I like it. This is an American adjunct lager, but it has a solid flavor and body. Much better than it's light sister beer. It definitely has much more character and dare I say, complexity, than similar style 'full flavor' American adjunct lager beers."
"RJT"
"One of the worst out of the three (BMC)."
"Better than a finger of white foam which lasted more than a minute. Some lacing on the side of my glass with good cling. Color is a 5 on the SRM Beer color chart. Smell is crisp, wheat, corn, malt, with just a hint of citrus. Flavor is well balanced, moist corn, wheat, barley malt, slight pine from the hops. Not much to feel in my mouth, just a little tingle from the carbonation. More yard work beer, refreshing, some buzz factor."
"D- Easy enough to drink like water, but flavorless."
"Notes - As far as this one goes its a bit better than your average american adjunct lager. flavors are the same but a little more refined. i stress a BIT better."
"Obviously this beer is designed for mass consumption, but it's not quite as smooth as some of its contemporaries, or even Coors Light for that matter. Basically, not a lot to recommend it, even within the category."
"A can of Coors Original, great on a hot day in Arizona. Pours a pale, straw yellow color with a fizzy white foam. No real head and/or lace to speak of. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Aroma has that adjunct-like cereal malts, no hop detectable by me. Taste has some grainy malt. Nothing stands out one way or the other. Smooth, crisp, more flavor than its Light brother."
"D can drink this for days on end"
"Overall, a mediocre american adjunct. Doesn't hold up well to scrutiny. Best consumed mindlessly on a hot day."
"If this is the ""Banquet Beer", I'm not really sure what the occasion is. Seems like more of a TV Dinner beer or something of the sort. Run of the mill adjunct lager."
"D: Easy on a hot day with limited choices... but in this day in age, choices are virtually limitless."
"drinkability; it's smooth and crisp, just not really like a good beer is smooth and crisp. A good beer for people who really don't like beer. This beer and others like it are favorites with my pothead friends."
"D- Perfect for a hot day, probably one of the best things you'll find at a regular party or ball game."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a thick white head and a fair amount of lacing. Smells of corn, grassy fields, and sweat. Tastes of creamed corn with a little bit of hop bitterness. Tastes very bland or stale. Mouthfeel is okay with decent carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"It tastes empty. It tastes watered down."
"D- Not horrible, but not great."
"D: This isn't a terrible beer. But it just doesn't taste like anything. All I really get is a mixture of sweet and very slight bitterness. Goes down easy but considering how light and flavorless it is, its no wonder. Skip it and opt for a drink with a bit more substance."
"Bud, MGD etc..etc.."
"It poured a pale straw yellow with absolutely no head, very strange. The smell is hard to pinpoint. It doesn't exhibit hops, malt, or sweetness or bitterness. It smells like a generic BMC beer but not the worst. The taste is actually not too bad either. It's definitely an upgrade from Coors Light. It's more drinkable than other mainstream brands."
"It is what it is.."
"The hardest to find macro brew. Maybe I've seen Smokey and the Bandit a few times too many, because I love Firebirds and Coors. By far my favorite macro brew."
"I could pound these all day. not to bad for a commercial massed produced beer."
"I can take these down all day."
"D- My number may look high, but as far as the style goes, I'll take a coors before most any other macro adjunct."
"Opinions will always vary with one persons pallet of flavor to another. Other than Smithwick's, this is also a perfect beer. The most smooth taste and perfectly served with nearly any food dish or just by it self. The taste is rich and grainy. The final drink is just as pleasant as the first drink. After a 12 pack or so, It still has me wanting more. Best american brew in the land"
"Of the big 3, this one would probably squeak into second place. Budweiser is fairly drinkable, this one is OK, Miller is just plain bad. But, that doesn't mean this one is good. It's not the worst beer I've ever had, but it isn't something I would go out of my way to drink."
"The mountains were as blue as Neytiri so it was Crack and Glug time! My aggressive pour resulted in two fingers of fizzy bone-white head with low retention. Color was a light golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. It was so clear that I felt like I had x-ray vision! Nose was pretty standard for the style - a light lager sweetness overlain by cereal extenders. Jesus, we were so naive in the late-1970's! Mouthfeel was medium with a very sweet lager taste on the tongue. Frankly, this was not too bad. I have had much worse AALs during my quest. Finish had an odd bitterness that was not hops, but instead whatever adjuncts they had seen fit to throw into the kettle. Oh well. CAN't tick, but chalk it up as a Glug and move on."
"This is my new choice for a summer beer. Sometimes it is worth trying an old, forgotten brand once again. Recommended!"
"Overall this might have been the best of the night. I could bring this to the beach if I had to."
"I drank this beer from a can the other day with my gf. I enjoyed the taste of it and the fact there was no bitter after taste or any after taste made it all the easier for me to put down and do what beers made to do get you drunk haha overall I would say its a pretty good average beer for the price 13$ for a 12 pack where I live."
"Average american beer. Good to buy as a 30 rack. The mountains are convenient, but never drink this beer warm or only slightly cold. When iced, the true, odd taste of the beer is hidden. It's watery, lightly carbonated, and almost sweet, not a hint of bitterness. Overall, good for a budget."
"Drinkability is high, because its fairly non-offensive, mild and light. It does well at what it is trying to be. As far as thirst quenching summer beers, I'll stick to wits and hefes, but this is still okay."
"D: Hey if I am tipsy and taste is out the window this is an option to save $$$$. Besides that drink this while cutting the lawn or doing house work."
"Drinkability: Of the big three macro brews, this may very well be the best. Not great as a beer, but pretty damn good as an adjunct lager. I'd have it again, though wouldn't necessarily choose it over most things."
"D- Extremely poor drinkability. Its hard to believe beer can be so tasteless."
"D: One of the best of the worst. Not as watery as others. A little but more body. If your night is a piss-beer night, this is a good place to start."
"Pours to a thin white had that dissipates to almost nothing; pale yellow-gold color. Aroma is faint cider, grain and seltzer. Flavor is rather complex for the style, faint pale malt, slight hop tinge and a bit of fruitiness in there for good measure. Mouthfeel is good. Overall, this is a non-offensive very refreshing water beverage. The flavor of real Coors is quite distinct and pleasing even though it is weak. This is a good ""lawnmower"" thirst-quenching summer beer."
"I cannot say anything bad about Coors as a beer. It is an outstanding Macro/Adjunct Lager. That of course does not mean this is my favorite style, and thus Coors (by no fault of its own) is nowhere near a choice beer for me. I have enjoyed reviewing Coors immensely, but it will be many years before I buy another. If I was stuck on a dessert island that had an ever-flowing natural spring of Coors I would survive fairly contently and be grateful to have it."
"pours a pale yellow with big head, no lacing. smell is, i dunno, like coors? grains. taste is ok... let's be honest, it's a macro produced beer meant to be consumed in large amounts. a classic ""quantity over quality"" situation. we all know that. mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. drinkability is high, as it should be."
"Taste is pretty meh, it's very sharp and overly carbonated it's far too sharp and crappy tasting. It's not a very good tasting beer."
"Pound for pound, one of America's best, especially when value is a consideration."
"Appearance: softly tinted tawny yellow body with a clear, foamy white head that settles to a bubbly circle--unappealing... Aroma: sweet, corn-tinged swagger that reaks of a thin, syrupy body... Palate: thin, light and smooth as expected--bubbly keg fair that soaks your hamburger... Taste: not much, aside from grass, corn and soft dough...zero drag on the throat, zero arrival on the tongue or teeth... Overall: even a good mood cannot alter the effect of this beer--zero punch or profile' I've softened my criticism of this beer (and its genre as a whole) as it serves a purpose that many friends and family members find quite necessary...but I can not seek this one out myself..."
"The body had a bit more depth than the other cheap beer of the night, Bud Ice. Some mild carbonation on the palate. Typical flavors for a macro. Some grains, buttery aftertaste, and white bread. Bitterness is low. All-in-all, not a bad offering for what it is. It's cheap and goes down easy. Better than most of the BMCs."
"Just a terrible beer all around. The smell taste, appearance are all horrible. I drank one of these when offered by a friend just to be polite, but inside I was not pleased. Gross for lack of a better word. Very cheaply crafted and a disgrace to good beer."
"D- If this is my only choice, yes, I will drink just this. But Spaten Lager is available, so I shall move on...this time."
"Pretty much just coors light in a different package and perhaps slightly more alcohol and better ingredients. I actually prefer the ""Banquet"" beer over quite a few of the BMC beers. Its not bad going down and its cheap."
"D - For it's purpose it's a decent adjunct lager to throw down a few very cold."
"Label says ""cold as the rockies""; since I got it out of the fridge and then somehow got distracted for a half hour, it wasn't all that cold. Is it somehow intrinsicly cold on another astral dimension? Here in this dimension and at this time and place, I'm less than impressed in any kind of good way. The cold as the rockies seems to me to have been one of this beers major attributes, its serving temperature. Doesn't work. I didn't pour it out since that would warm it even more. The aroma in the bottle was ""beer"" and nothing more. Give it the benefit of the doubt in appearance since it remained in the bottle. Taste was world common beer and while not bad, certainly nothing I'd ever seek out cept if the other options were somehow worse. Body is like ....beer. Finish is like flavor. And forgetfully short. Nuff said."
"Most of the time I will purchase a 30 pack of Coors, $20. The tall thin cans are growing on me."
"D - This one will be a regular in the beer fridge. This and Pabst are the best of the macros, and they do not disappoint."
"For the money, this beer is not bad. It tastes better than most American macros. I think it could be good for a bbq or a sports event, or any casual activity where one does not want to spend a lot on beer."
"I used to think this beer was fairly decent, drank cold straight from the long neck bottle. Now that I'm finally getting around to reviewing it, I'm not that impressed. Slightly darker than pale gold, with a rocky mountain cap of white foam. Smells exactly like any other BMC product, and doesn't taste all that much better. Not so great from the glass."
"Note: On the 1936 can it says, ""export lager"" it was so good we exported it...but not to the east coast? Where the hell did they export it? HA!"
"Overall: Coors Light definitely improves this beer. I was definitely hopeful that this beer would be a classier macrobrew. Unfortunately, it did not live up to this at all."
"Love the can...when poured very light golden color with no real head. Smell is almost non-existant...just typical grain smell. Sweet to my palate...no real hops flavor. Very carbonated...tickles the mouth not very enjoyable. To me better than Bud or MGD...A beer to get drunk on (not a good reason to drink beer)."
"Thin body, prickly hops, even though not substantial. Good zip brisk feel to it. Taste some metal. Nothing to speak of flavor wise beyond what you get the first sip. Drinkable, but this stuff isn't exactly a good value with what you get for it, but I guess MillerCoorsSAB has an advertising budget to pay."
"In conclusion, this Coors experience was kind of like kissing your sister. In the heat of the moment, it may have seemed like a good idea. In retrospect...what the hell was I thinking? On a side note, the answer is ""No"". I've never kissed my sister. :P"
"Plus, I love how every time I drink one of these the song ""East Bound and Down"" goes through my head! Make it to Texarkana and back in 28 hours?! You bet!!"
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"This beer poured a light yellow with a quickly fading fizzy head. The smell and taste are typical macro with the only difference being a little more rice, which could be mostly due to my imagination as much as it being a cheap ingredient. What are you going to do, this is an American macro, Meant to be inoffensive and able to be consumed in massive quantities, this beer delivers on those qualities if nothing else."
"I don't like this beer. It's too thick. There is slight tastes of malts and hops. But it's water seemingly thickened up. I don't like it won't drink it again even if it's on keg. If Coors is used as a banquet beer like it says it is then I'm not going to banquets anymore."
"Overall, this is a decent adjunct lager that is not particularly repulsive, which is a compliment to any adjunct. I wouldn't drink it often, but for what it is, it's not terrible."
"D - I'd peg this as fractionally better than Miller and Bud, though your friends who aren't beer nerds probably won't even notice the difference. There are other beers of this style that are marginally better, but Coors will do the job at backyard BBQs or in front of the TV."
"Drinkability: Clean and painfully over-filtered to a fault, really. A very empty experience, indeed! If you do come across a bottle or can of this, well, just be sure to drink it cold and drink it quick."
"Drinkability - there's a box of wings in the oven, it's the only pairing, along with a slice of pizza that does any justice."
"Appearance has a light golden color with a less than fair crisp head. Smell is very clean, maybe some very light corn. Taste is bigger than the smell with corn, some grainy sweetness and light hop. Mouthfeel is light with a good spike of carbonation. Overall a good drinking American macro."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly really easy, thats why you can have like 12 during a football game."
"D: To be honest, one of the better adjunct lagers (although, that's not saying much). A decent enough beer for drinking games or at a ballgame, etc."
"You have to love the original Banquet beer. Coors is a much better beer than Budweiser in my opinion. You get a fairly light beer with some decent flavor. It isn't a huge difference from the traditional Coors Light, but it does bring a slightly different flavor. I prefer Coors Light to Coors, but I'll pick up a Coors if I'm feeling a little fancy."
"I am drinking this from the 12 ounce can. I know this brew has a golden hue with a good amount of carbonation. Very tasty more grainy, cereal flavor than hops, hops not really noticed at all. No real complex flavors here. Just a basic refreshing brew. For me its a good go to beer."
"I prefer Coors light to the regular Coors, not as bitter and easier to drink."
"Why doesn't Coors sell more of this stuff? I had drank my fair share of Coors products before I had ever tried my first Banquet beer. Quite honestly I think this is one of the best American lagers, it hands down is much better tasting than Budweiser or MGD, and runs abot the same price (if you can find it). It has a solid amber color and is very well carbonated. It's just thick enough but not too thick for an American lager. It has a very grainy taste with a slight creamy vanilla flavor. This beer tastes great poured up in a frozen mug or off tap. I keep a 12 pack of 12oz cans in my fridge at all times. I love this beer after a hard day at work or with a meal. Overall this is a great ""everyday"" kind of beer."
"D: Better than coors light, i enjoyed a lot with lunchables."
"And things changed. The can does not look like it used to (or should) but this is still one damn fine American beer."
"Drinkability: It's not bad for what it is. It's not going to make my ""Must have again"" list, but it does make my ""Could have again"" list."
"EDIT: A LOT better than Coors Light though."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a 1 inch head that leaves little lacing. The appearance is crystal clear and pale. The aroma is faintly of earthy hops and malt. The taste is of light hops with very mild bitterness and a hint of malt. I'm not getting any corn or rice in it. The feel is light bodied or thin with a clean finish. It's one of the more drinkable American majors, I have long prefered it over it's American adjunct lager competitors."
"D - very very drinkably"
"Drinkability - if your going out to have a few, you can drink these without getting in too much trouble."
"OK, I know it's popular to knock the big boys and I've done my share. And, really, there is probably nothing all that special about old Original Coors. But when I was young this brew was only available in very limited areas. It's kind of hard to believe now, cuz Coors Light (which blows) is EVERWHERE. And I'm not sure if it's was just such a part of my youth that I am so fond of this beer but I am. I really love this brew. In the years since I've had so many different beers from all over the world. We were really into import way back before all the micro thing got off the ground...so I've had a great variety. I STILL like original Coors. It is a great beer to drink in quantity or just a beer with a burger. As long as they cook it and as long as I can..I'll be a Coors Original fan."
"D: i can drink alot of these of a really hot day no problem"
"Another mass-conumption driven marcrobrew lager. It's darker than Bud/Miller with a sweet-ish smell of grains and corn. Taste is fair. Mouthfeel is richer than other AALagers. At a ballgame or picinic this is a fine beer to drink as long as it's served cold. Nothing exceptional, but not terrible either."
"O- Tasted better then the other BMC I've had. It was just lacking taste."
"Not that bad."
"This is one beer that I'll buy one a hot summer day if available, usually its hard to find in my area and will choose it over any Bud or Miller lagers. Also works good in making beer bread too."
"MF/D: Over carbonated, watery, light/med body for the style."
"D: As shown by its popularity on the commercial scale, you can drink many of these in on sitting. Low alcohol content and extremely mild taste/flavors make this beer perfect for a long day in the sun."
"Overall, IMO, better than any miller product or bud product. Probably my favorite generic, cheap American Beer."
"D: Drinkable but not my favorite BMC lager."
"Pours a light gold color with a small head to it. The smell is of a slight malt to it. The taste is very faint not much to it, but it is of some malt note. The mouthfeel is pretty easy not overly carbonated. The drinkability is okay it isn't complex, but there are some notes to the beer. It is slightly malty in both aroma and taste."
"This one was quite a surprise. Crisp and refreshing, with a malty flavor and muted hops. Don't get me wrong, the flavor is weak and more than a little, watery but altogether pleasant. Not surprisingly, the aftertaste is limited but pleasant. Reasonably flavorful lager and particularly good for a mass market beer. As far as macros go, I usually prefer Miller, but I found this quite good and will order it when the truly good stuff is not available."
"D- I managed to get through the can but I had to dump some when it got to warm. If I was to drink this it would have to be extremely cold. The popularity of this shows me just how shallow Americans are, OK end of rant."
"D: Not very flavorful at all, goes down very easily since there isn't much to the beer, not filling for that same reason, it's comparable to most beers in the style even though there are several others which are more flavorful that I would pick first."
"This beer is - as you already know - really bad. It's pee yellow colored, weak head, etc. Nose is surprisingly dirty, grainy sweetness. Flavor is likewise, not good. Feel is mediocre. It's bad, is all. Specifically stopped drinking as this was all that was available."
"Pours a crystal clear straw color with a soapy white head that quickly settles into a very light ring. The aroma is grainy sweet, corn with a hint of sulfur. The taste is quite sweet, grainy, veggies cooked in a sugar water solution. Doesn't really have that nasty veggie taste. The feel is light but not watery, an almost slick feel, it doesn't have that typical dry bite that most macros have to help balance the sweet malt. The brew drinks fine cold, wouldn't want to have it warm. Seems sweet for the style but doesn't have that grainy taste. Doesn't seem as crisp as it should."
"D-Easy going down, no doubt about that, good for all mixed company. Much more crisp than other domestic beers, also more full body than Budweiser, thats for sure. It'll do for the party, and for those that want to be more adventuras than their light beer drinking buddies."
"overall - It's a limp, pitiful facsimile of what beer is. It still hurts that my father loves his coors and coors light, when I really can't stand the stuff. Then again, his favorite beer is Sam Adams, so there's a glimmer of hope there."
"Drinkability: Easy because it's weak. It's not very good beer, but I've had much worse."
"Cheers"
"Taste: As opposed to some beers similar to this, there is no off flavor to it. It does however lack any strong flavors either way. What is there is a sweet grain flavor with little else."
"D 4.0 - Surprisingly better than I remember for an A Adjunct Lager. Not my first pick in a brew, but would be top pic if I have to choose from a beer for the masses."
"D- Like a macro--can slug them down, but I would reach for something else."
"Poured from a can into a weizen glass. Pale yellow color with a small head. Hardly any traces of aroma. Feels light and watery in the mouth. Very mild flavor. It is a highly drinkable beer that does not fill you up. Good for drinking games I suppose but not a beer to savor."
"Thin mouthfeel and lively carbonation."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beers body is light. This beer seems to be a bit more well rounded than Bud or Miller. The carbonation is active but I think it adds to the beer. In all honesty given the terrible choice between BMC. I think I will have to go with Coors as my oh shit no other choice beer."
"When poured from the 'Banquet' bottle, the foam was smooth and creamy. The color was a light watered down yellow with alot of carbonation. The smell was semi-skunky, with hints of wheat and hops. The taste was of a watered down version of your typical pils, but with no real taste. Mouthfeel - light-bodied, crisp and very carbonated. Drinkability - has a 'no taste' value and the longer it takes to drink it, it tastes even worse."
"One of my all-time fondest beer drinking memories is two ice-cold tallboy Banquet Beers fresh out of the ice chest after finally making it back to my lodgings following an epic Eastern Sierra hike. Paired with a fresh deli sandwich, beer has never tasted better, 14,505' style..."
"D:"
"Considering I drink Coors Light all the time I figured I try regular old Coors for once. There's nothing special about it. Smells pretty generic, like its peers (Budweiser, MGD). The taste is smooth, and light but I am not sure it is supposed to. I bummed this off my roommate and I don't think I would buy it. Maybe, if I feel like changing it up at a local bar I'll drink it again... but it'd be a longshot."
"On-tap at Louie's near Emmaus for $2.50 a pint. Not bad. I guess I could say this is one of my preferred adjunct beers as there's not offensive to me in here. I guess it reminds me a bit of Yuengling Premium. There's basically just a sweetish bread that fades off into a mild ginger ale flavor. It is a bit thicker than most adjunct beers, but still fairly drinkable - especially because it doesn't suck."
"Not as watery as Budweiser, but still very watery. Only mildly offensive as an adjunct lager."
"I didn't drink Coors for several years but recently have been buying it more. It seems to have a cleaner crisper taste than I recall from years ago. I prefer the wide, vented drinking hole in the can, and the can fits my hand better than Budweiser..if you haven't tried it in a while, I recommend it. The mountains on the can are blue gray when cold and turn white as the beer disappears. How cool is that? Great beer."
"Drinkability - Where beers like this thrive (not to quote the commercials buy they are true) could easily have a few of these in one night"
"D: Typical in so many respects. This one does get credit for having a bit of character, even if that comes in the form of some slightly unusual flavors."
"It's easy and drinkable. Not going to rock your taste buds but it is more tolerable than a few other examples I've had."
"even with the ecoGnomic downturn, die broke drinking something like Nugget Nectar"
"This is my favorite beer. I understand that some others might not like it, but I feel Coors has a rich, creamy flavor and is a perfect compliment to food (hence, ""Banquet Beer""). I love the way Coors goes down, and is incredibly drinkable. I like craft beer as well, but this is the king of macrobrews in my opinion."
"It has a nicer color and is a bit better in taste but only by comparision. It's not bad in your mouth and doesn't leave a terrible aftertaste like Coors light does."
"D- Good beer! I like the refreshing nature of this one and would say that this is one of the better macros I've had. No problems here sticking with this one for an evening. Too bad I can't find it here in Alberta....will definitely pick up some more of this next time i'm in the States."
"The best of the Bud, Miller crowd (not saying much)."
"Any resemblance to a true lager is a miracle."
"Notes from: 12/12/06"
"The drinkability is good, but I don't think I would put alot of these down."
"This is not one of my favorite brews. Personally I'm more of a Coors light fan than a fan of this. Something is just off. It tastes like it's too strong for this style of beer. Head and color were decent though. Better from a can but it's still not worth buying. Just stick to a case a Coors light."
"Looks like corn juice, smells like corn juice, tastes like corn juice. Welcome to the world of cheap macros!!! But probably between PBR and Bud Light (PBR being the higher) in the chain of shitty beers. I don't know what a ""banquet"" beer is but apparently Coors is the creme de la creme of them according to their slogan....therefore I will never attend another banquet in my life."
"As an aside, I remember when you couldn't buy Coors on the East Coast. As a kid, I remember reading Hot Rod magazine and seeing ads for ""Coors, Breakfast Of Champions"" tee shirts and not having a clue as to what Coors was. Years later Paul Newman, in a Play Boy magazine interview, proclaimed Coors the best beer in the world. And at one point my local beer distributer was selling Coors for a brief time in New York at 3 times the price of Bud. When I visited my sister in law in CA, I guzzled cans of Coors and when my buddy went to visit his parents in Colorado, I always had him bring back a case of Coors. I remember Adolf Coors saying they wouldn't sell their beer unless the retailer kept it refridgerated. I seem to remember Coors to be an exceptional American beer at the time. Or was it just mystique. In any case this beer pretty much sucks today. And at 99 cents for a 24 oz can, Coors knows that."
"The taste is a bit better then Bud Light, but nothing really special. To me its like water..."
"D- OK. average for the style."
"Update - I recently tried this beer again, and it tasted like Colt 45 Malt liquor! I couldn't believe it, my palate just developed more for sure, and I certainly won't have this again."
"cheap, baby. not very tasty, baby. but the ability to guzzle this without thinking is pretty good. of course, if you like beer with actual flavor, stay away."
"This would probably be my favorite of the ""Big 3"" (Miller, Coors, Budweiser) simply because it's not awful. It's nothing stellar, but it's drinkability makes it go well with food - either cooking or eating. It goes great with deep dish pizza."
"While I respect what Coors has done for the beer industry, I really don't see the drinkability of this beer unless it's for beer-pong."
"cheers"
"Overall just a so so beer. What I don't understand is how can somebody pick up a six pack or a 12 pack and enjoy drinking this beer. Ahhhh, it is nerve racking."
" Light golden color with minimal head and lacing. Aroma is of corn and maybe a little malt, if you're lucky. Taste is very minimal, of corn, malt and possibly filtered out hops. Lots of carbonation.Thin-bodied and watered-down, this is better than Bud and on par with Miller High Life. Not horrible or repulsive though"
"The banquet beer pours a pale yellow color and has a hint of sweet malt in the smell. The taste is similar to the other macro beers of its kind but different enough to tell the difference. If you told me I had to have a big three macro beer this would be my second choice. It is also usually the beer of choice with my friends when we play beer pong or are outside when it's hot."
"D - Very drinkable. Could drink quite a few in one sitting."
"Tap @ The Buffet in Tucson. It is the one and only beer on tap here. As cheap macros go, this is as close as you can get to a decent pale lager. Pours more yellow than most, with an actual thick white head. Aroma is all grain and corn, with the typical metal. But maybe its the commercials, but it actually smells fresher than its rivals. Taste is corny and astringetn metal, but finishes crisp. Definitely not good, but not the worst out there."
" all I ask from this style is a clean finish and this one wasn't too bad."
"I will have to say that this is the best of the ""big three"". Ugly looking beer, fizzy, over carbonated, but a bit of lacing on the glass. Smells, well, not good. Golden color, perfectly filtered. Not as much ""corness"" going on here. Really smooth taste with a bit of flavor, a bit tart but a bit of toastiness. Really not bad and could be a staple in the fridge."
"D: Coors Banquet Beer isn't the least bit interesting to drink. An inoffensive and forgettable brew. In macro-land, I look for the best beer for the least money. There are better, or at least comparable macros out there that cost much less than this."
"Drinkability is decent. I've always thought that the Banquet Coors is one of the more drinkable macros. Not all that pretty to look at, or smell, but the flavors and drinkability are not bad."
"Overall a decent macro experience."
"This concludes my tour of the Big 3 (or is it 2 now? Or even 1?)'s flagship beers. I'm surprised to say that I rank Bud ahead of this, with the Highlife winning best in show - a dubious honor if there ever was one. This is a nasty beer that I will avoid like the plague from here on out."
"D - Drinkability is what this beer is designed for. Definite session beer."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with a large white head that had good retention. Some spotty lacing is left on the glass surface. Has some graininess in the aroma but otherwise it is an adjunct lager. Just a hint of hops in the smell and flavor. Not offensive but rather mediocre. Light body with fizzy carbonation. Goes down quickly especially drinking out of the vented wide mouth can."
"D: This is a great session beer if nothing else is around, definitely something that i'd reach for on a weekend out. Not a bad beer at all, a little bland, but for the style, definitely the beer I'd drink."
"The beer is brilliantly clear, straw yellow in color with a moderate white head that quickly diminished with no retention. The aroma is moderately grainy with hints of metal and corn. The flavor is moderately sweet with a carbonic bite. There are hints of grain in the flavor with very low bitterness. The finish is bubbly, dry and just a bit sweet. Carbonation is high and body medium-low; a tad more body than I expected. Overall nothing offensive but high carbonation and acidic bite detracts from any positives."
"pours like almost any other lager, a very pale light golden color with a big white head, smell is weak, corn and water dominate the nose with a tiny hint of hops, taste is whatever just kinda mixture of boring and emptiness, nothing stands out, its somewhat refreshing on kind of a warm day, but that is the nicest compliment i can give it. i dont feel its any different than bud or other macro lagers."
"D- not to bad, better than coors loght or any other beer like that. all i can say is, Beer pong."
"d - pretty easy to drink but even easier to forget"
"Not bad, a step above Coors Light. Possibly a touch more character then Budweiser, but they are pretty much the same."
"D - Very drinkable."
"Overall: I did not like this beer"
"Easy on the hiccups, easy on the stomach. And its a pleaser for the entire family, Banquet for sure. For the price its a contender I would say with the other beers of its style and price. It is what it is. Take it or leave it. Dont rate it low because you wanted it to be a Trappist. Its every thing it promises and nothing else."
"Nothing special here, pretty standard pale lager swill. Golden/yellow color and pours with very little head. Grain-malt-corn-water taste, it isn't good but not ultra-offensive. You could do quite a bit worse (Budweiser). Just nothing I'm going to be looking for again."
"D- Drinkable I suppose, though the adjunct taste gets to me after a while. Better than Budweiser, but even an average grocery store has much better choices for another couple bucks, so I don't see many situations where I'd buy this again."
"Thin-bodied and watery with adequate carbonation that lends itself to good drinkability, true to style."
"Pours a clear golden/yellow color, very slightly darker around the edges, small white head fades into a thin foamy layer atop the beer, negligible amount of lacing. Smell is grainy and sweet, no detectable hop presence, very generic ""beer"" smell. Taste is decent, a slight hint of lemon on the tongue, grainy/wheat taste, and yeah, these beers are meant for consuming fast and cold, because as I sit here typing my review, it's getting worse and worse. But those first few cold sips...OK. Mouthfeel on this is awful, very thin, but also quite drying on the tongue and roof of the the mouth...not really quenching at all. I could drink this at BBQ and be fine with it, and it's a whole hell of a lot better than its Light counterpart, so there's that. Otherwise, uninspiring."
"There are few pale lagers that I like from the macro-breweries. Original Coors sits right on the border. The aroma and appearance are typical for this grouping. The taste is slightly better than most and it does have a good finish as long as it's ice cold. What I can't figure out is why this beer tastes completely different (and much better) than Coors Light which is simply horrible. Anyway I won't turn it down when it's offered."
"Drinkability - I could drink these on a whim, but it doesn't mean they satisfy. At least its better than the light variation."
"This is one of my favorite macros. I personally hate macros, but if i want a regular beer, I feel that coors is the king of macros. It has a golden straw color. it has some flavor but not a skunky budweiser flavor. If I had the option I would choose coors over bud or miller"
"Dare I say the best of the macros? I think so. Drinkability is obviously high. Of all the BMC brands, this one works the best for me....for $13 a 18 pack, thats a good deal."
"c'est la vie."
"Not Impressed."
"Overall, a good session beer, not much else."
"The classic light yellow/gold color with a shortlived bubbly white head and only a hint of lacing. I pick up only a very mild citrus cereal aroma, clean. It offers a mild cereal flavor, clean and clear with a bit of flowery overtones. Well carbonated and very refreshing and drinkable. Not as special as what I recall from the 70's!"
"Drinkability: This beer goes down really easy and I could drink a lot if that's what I wanted to do."
"I enjoyed this masterful brew poured from the can into a plastic cup, just the way it was meant to be had. Smelled oh so deliciously of metal. In fact, if I had to put a number, I'd say it was a 3 on a scale of 1 to 10. As my lips quivered in anticipation, the beer literally screamed ""DRINK ME"". Not to deny the outspoken desires of the fresh rocky mountain water, I obliged and tapped in to it. Taste of refreshing tin canned sweet corn. Fantastic. My taste buds were high fiving eachother, and chest bumping my uvula. They realized they were being rewarded today. Reminds me of the creamed corn gatorade flavor that was short lived in the mid 90's. The body on this exceptionally well canned beer was thin, just like I'd expect. So good, I drank about 10 full ounces of this nectar before eating some green chili cheese fries while listening to the gourds battle the Shady Grove crowd. My first Coors is a day I'll not soon forgot."
"Pretty good macro. Better than I thought it would be. Nice price too at 1.50$ for the 24oz cans."
"All things considered, this is a damn good macro lager. Not my favorite (that would be Pabst), but Coors does have a good amount of mouthfeel for the style, a distinctive ""clean"" flavor that makes it easy to drink, but at the same time does have a bit of character to it as well. Another reason I respect this brew is the fact Coors has not watered down the recipe for Coors original over the years. Honestly, especially on a hot day, this is a good brew to drink. Remember, ever type of brew has its place, and therefore should be respected. On a 90 degree day, I think most people would agree that this brew would be a good one to have around. Consume cold for best taste."
"Drinkability? Sure, if you are at a cookout, but I wouldn't keep these around to impress anyone."
"Not nearly as bad as many of the options out there, and probably not as bad as I expected it to be when I first tried it. To be fair, it's also actually a pretty decent beer to cook with (although its price may have something to do with that - I'd never be able to bring myself to sautée anything in Duvel). So, although I can't recommend you bring a six-pack to a BBQ or a dinner party, I will suggest that you make fun of a friend who does less than you make fun of the friend who brings the sixer of Bud."
"D - Beer just ain't the same since I really branched out and started understanding the beverage...a can of Coors was one my last refuges when it came to American lager. I could drink this, but it certainly doesn't taste like it used to to me."
"Taste is okay. Many off flavors and well hidden by the water and malt. Bad hops. Feel is light with over load carbonation. I can't drink more that 1 of these."
"but man, can i pound these down. not looking to enjoy my beer, but just to get drunk, why not grab a coors. I can drink them forever and never waste a whole $20 bill."
"The first time I tried this, I thought that the can might be old. But, I have tried it bottled since and it's still the same: after one sip, it's unpleasant, dirty mineral water. That said, it is rather crisp and a little refreshing and, because of the blandness is kind of easy to drink. This ranks far below Miller High Life or Pabst Blue Ribbon to me, and is even below regular Budweiser (not Bud Light) and Red Dog."
"I don't drink this nearly as much as Tripels, Echter, Guinness, or German lagers, but it's in my regular rotation."
"Overall: For what it is, a mass produced lager meant for mass consumption, it's really not that bad. I definitely enjoy it more than it's ""light"" counterparts."
"Final thought: Coors is my least favorite American macrobrew. Gimme a Miller High Life, a Bud, or even a PBR, and I'll skip the Coors."
"Drinkability is low. Although the beer has low alcohol, The overall lack of taste makes me desire something more. Could drink one if it was the only thing available."
"Tasting these Macro lagers is a little strange to me because I first look for the malt/hop balance, but I realy taste neither. There is sweetness, but not the Malty goodness that I look for. I drank it pretty quick though, it's not too bad."
"All in all, as far as ""The Big 3"" go...this is probably my favorite, light easy drinking, doesn't have any harsh or offputting grainy sweetness like some American macros have, completely drinkable lawnmower beer."
"Golden in color with virtually no head. Very grainy scent. Tastes of grains and sweet cereal. Carbonation is a bit high for my tastes, aftertaste is a bit on the bad side. Average drinkability, if you drink one you may as well have a few more. This is a slightly below average quality beer, not something I would drink again on purpose."
"Haven't had a Coors ""Banquet"" beer in many years. I decided it was unfair to write a review from memory and purchaced the smallest single I could find which was a 24 ounce can. Poured into the clear glass tumbler a light amber color with about a 1"" white head. The aroma was alright a bit of hops. The taste is a well-balanced sweet malt and just enough hops to offset the malt. There was a slight copper metallic taste as well that was not unpleasant. Mouthfeel was average for an American macro. Drinkability is fine. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this beer. I must have bought a really fresh one for a change."
"D: Easy to drink, probably one of the better macro's I've had."
"D - Much better than light beers of its kind. This is about the only one of its style I wouldn't pass up. Probably my favorite in this category of popular-mainstream American beers."
"Back in the 70s this was the beer. As Coors and light beers went mainstream this beer has been forgotten I think. Prediction for 2040, Yuengling will be the Coors of the 21st Century. The beer that set the bar (in this case Amber vs light lager)will become the beer that was left behind."
"Drinkability. Decent, not bad at all."
"D - I'll probably never drink this again unless I'm somewhere that doesn't have anything else to drink"
"If I was at a friends house and asked if I wanted a Coors light, I'd ask if there is anything else. If asked: would like a Coors Oiginal, my answer is, ""sure that would be fine""."
"Overall, its drinkable... but I would NEVER pay for anything this bland. Of the three major macro brews, Coors by far ranks dead last for my taste buds."
"D: This was mush better out of the bottle and sort of depressing to look at when in the glass. It looks a lot darker in the commercials I've been seeing lately, it also looked like it had a lot for active carbonation, really if you are drinking this make sure it stays in the bottle."
"Okay, so it's a macro-lager, so it needs to be judged within that context. And in that context, it's a heck of a lot better than Bud or Miller, with a lack of adjuncts and other nastiness. Supposedly, it's 5% ABV, but it sure doesn't feel like it has much alcohol at all. I've nearly finished this 24 oz tallboy and feeling just the barest hint of any effect. Then again, if you usually drink craft beers and Belgians, you're well-trained to absorb this like water. It's crisp, easy to drink, looks okay, has no real head or lace, nor real aroma, but you can quaff it like water. I'd take it over Bud any day of the week. Mixes great with V8 juice to make your own chelada."
"Avoidable, but not terrible."
"D- I wont go out of my way to purchase this."
"Now, I tried mine in can form, so I really can't grade the appearance but the smell was of your average American macro - almost nonexistent. But the taste actually hits you and its not too bitter, unlike the watery composition of Coors Light. If you haven't tried this beer, it is worth a shot - don't think it's just Coors Light with an extra percent of alochol."
"Pours a golden yellow with a white head. The head isn't very thick and neither is the yellow color of the beer. It has an aroma of light malts and light hops. They are pretty faint, but that is the only aroma I can get out of it. The taste is OK. It is light and malty with a bit of hop flavoring. It doesn't taste like much, but it has some taste. The mouthfeel is excellent and I could probably drink a bunch of these before I felt bad in the morning about it. Not a bad beer for what it is supposed to be."
"Keeping in mind the style is American Macro Lager, I really enjoy Coors. It has a nice straw color to it and holds a decent head, even if it's not great. A weak malty scent, but a nice crisp and refreshing taste. It has quite a bit of carbonation and it's not a stong taste, but compared to the other macros it's really good. If I compared it to craft or micro lagers the ratings would go down, probably to the high 2s. But it's my favorite macro out of the lot of them."
"D- mild flavor, affordable price, thirst quenching, low ABV, rocky mountain freshness. nuff said."
"It goes down fairly easily, which is I assume the reason former light beer drinkers sometimes graduate to Original when they feel they need to look ""classy."" Little do they know."
"The reason the appearance was 3.5 is the amazing gold can from which this beer is poured. Otherwise the color of the beer is the same generic golden color as every other macro brew. I honestly will not drink any other coors product, but ""the O"" is my favorite of all macros. it is a bit watered down, but still has a pretty crisp taste and finishes clean. If i'm at a bar with no micros this is definately my first choice."
"The taste has some malt, grain, and a touch of hops that adds some bitterness near and through the finish. Very average flavours going on here and my interest in drinking leaves quickly. Nothing offensive going on here, mind you, it's just too ordinary. No wonder I only drink it about every 2 or 3 years...."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable, classic macro. Coors seems to still have a focus on the quality of this product."
"This is slightly less heinous than Coors light, so I scored it slightly higher. Another over-carbonated, macro-brew pale lager that doesnt offer much taste, only offers the ability to urinate frequently and get drunk if you have enough. Why is there so much of this bland flavorless style?"
"Tastes light and crisp - too light, and too crisp. Although it's certainly smooth, there's not much beer to the flavor."
"Haven't had this one in years. First off...It's MUCH better than it's little brother Coors Light. Now, that's not saying much..but it is what it is, as we here at BA always say. Has more flavor and ""fullness"" to it, and it's a very smooth and inoffensive flavor at that. I agree with some on here, in that Coors brews have that hint of ""banana"" flavor in there. Must be the hops?? Be kinda neat to know what makes that taste. Doesn't matter, though. Nice, easy-drinkin' American macro. This one is a keeper, and at 5% ABV....it's much more worth your ""buck"" to snag these rather than the Light, which is like 4.2% ABV. Not that alcohol content matters or anything...! ;o) Good, light, poundable football beer. ENJOY! Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!"
"Ah the great macro brew.Very fizzy as it pours into a pint and seems that the head will stick around until you hear the soda pop fuzz.A golden straw see-through color typical with these beers.Smells like a bean and corn field being harvested all at once.( I live in a farming town ) But do i detect a hint of malt and hop goodness? Well not too much but it is there in very light fashion.This Coors tastes great and is easily drinkable.Might I add that I live in Illinois I have visited the brewery in golden 2 times and loved it,I suggest the tour there to all beer lovers on history alone.Anyway back to the beer. This brew is one to drink and buy on a regular basis when the funds are tight."
"This is suprisingly heavy for an American lager, could not drink many at all"
"Drinkabililty: In my humble opinion, this beer is better than Bud/Light, Miller/Lite, Old Style/Light, and Stroh's/Light (some of the biggest Macro brews out there). I wouldn't usually buy a beer like this under most circumstances, but in a pinch (e.g. you're traveling, you want a cold beer pretty immediately, you find a liquor store with only the BIG NAME brewers available in the cooler...), this will work fine to slak the thirst."
"D: Not a bad macro, good for washing down dinner, but not something you'd come back to, not a great beer."
"Overall light and easy to drink, not to bad for a Macro, and the unusual sweetness gives it a little bit of charachter."
"Up until this point I have never had a Coors regular before. I have had all of the other beers that Coors makes. This beer surprised me in how much better it was than some of the other macros. It didn't have more flavor, just better flavor. Easy to drink as well. If this beer was more available I would choose it over Bud and the likes. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but if it was on tap and cheap I woudl go for it. Doesn't beat out Schlitz which is my favorite session beer."
"Drank this beer one night at a bar, when it was the special of the night. I have to say I wasn't very impressed, when handed that glass, there was no real sign of a head or any activity to show carbonation. when i asked the bartender if this was fresh, he assured me it was fresh. So i went ahead and drank it, but the smell and taste were almost non existant. To say this beer was good would be a joke."
"I could probably drink a gallon of this if I would want to do such a thing."
"Overall, not a bad brew if served freezing on a hot day, out of the big 3, this would be my third choice."
"Perhaps I may have become biased because I had two roommates in college from Colorado who swore by this stuff, but I don't think it's that bad. For what it is, I would say it is above average. In an age where most beer consumers want light, watery, low-carb beers, this one stands out for me. I drank this by the gallon when I was 18 because that's all my buddies bought, but I slowly became to appreciate it. It is not going to blow you away for being the best in the world, but when it is hot, or your at the beach, or come home from a long day at work, want to pound somthing out of the can to quench your thirst and get some flavor, this is where to turn. Although I rarely get hammered on this stuff anymore, there are few times when I will turn down a cold Coors O"
"Pale straw colored pour with a thin head without retention. Smells of hops and barley and basically like every other beer in its class. The taste is very bready especially at first with a very lingering stale-like taste. There is a small bite of carbonation on the swallow and again there is the lingering stale-bread taste. The mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated and watery with the carbonation picking up on the swallow. The watery texture makes this drinkable, but again very common and un-original for its style. Coors original wallows in American macro Un-originality."
"Drinkability-This is not a bad beer to have after mowing the lawn. Its not bad for its price for this class of beer."
"Pours a very nice golden yellow color. Surprisingly full of color unlike most macro lagers. Smell is very mild, it took me a few deep sniffs to detect much. Tastes very good, mild, and in my opinion quite refreshing as it is 102 outside, humid, and I have only swamp cooling. Very slight taste of hops, which I usually don't taste in this style. Mouthfeel is nice. Thin, but I think it suits this beer very well. This beer is very drinkable, I could see myself getting this again if I didn't feel like a light beer."
"Poured out a can of this into a glass mug. Poured a straw yellow with no real head or lacing worth anything. The smell was nothing, really - smelled a lot like the light version and slightly bitter. The taste was ok. Pretty bitter taste to it, similar to the light version. A little malty taste, but again, nothing noticeable. The mouthfeel is where the original distinguishes itself from the light version. It at least has a thicker, ""beerlike"" taste to it as opposed to the thinner, lighter version of it. Overall, it's pretty drinkable and still refreshing, just like the light stuff."
"This sample was found at the supermarket in a tall can with the ""frost brewed liner"". It poured nicely..I had my hopes up with a return to glory...and the first taste...the head disappeared quickly...nothing but a watery underlying taste of malts. Obviously my taste for history has interfered with present day common sense."
""
"Drinkability: On a hot summers day i can pound a bunch of these and still respect beer, cheers!"
"An unimpressive entry from one of the big three. The beer is a very light yellow colour in the glass, with a very thin white head that quickly dissipates. The aroma dissipates as the beer is poured from the bottle into the glass. The taste reminds me of burnt sugar and this taste lingers for quite a while after the beer is gone. The mouthfeel is too watery as well."
"Drinkability of this is OK if macros are your thing."
"Full keg served at work for a celebration. Poured into a little 12oz plastic cup. Clear gold color, not as pale as Coors Light. Grainy malt aroma with a strong corn presence. Quite sweet flavor, almost cloying. No detectable hop bitterness at all. Grainy and, well, bleagh-worthy. Thin, light body. Well... at least it's free. There, I drank my one social beer to fit in."
" Another american macro for the fake beer drinker. Meh."
"Smooth drinking & great for the Maui heat. As far as American Macros go, this is pretty standard, and you could do much worse."
"Drinkability: Coors. What stands out right now is the citrus bitterness, and the sourness. No sweetness except a light malt sweetness in the nose."
"pours out of the ""frost brew liner"" can a clear, very light golden colour, with a thick foamy head that seems to be reducing quite quickly. adjuncty aroma, hints of banana...whatever the aroma is it's quite pronounced (and not all that pleasant) for macro swill. light pale malt flavour, a bit grainy and watery in the taste. mouthfeel is weak and watery...and thus the body of this lager is below average. drinkability suffers, because IMHO, it's just not a very good beer. i'd much rather drink a budweiser or an mgd or high life than this."
"Pale straw with a moderate head that thins out and some scattered lacing. Smells of cooked rice and grain, although has a cleanness to it. Taste is sweet, rice-y, a touch grainy, a bit of malt in there, and has a kind of dry finish. Mouthfeel is watery, but not too prickly. Good as a thirst quencher. I've got no qualms with this, but if I want a rice lager, I'll grab for a Bud."
"Drinkability isnt too good, with every coor's product , your buying it in bulk and I usualy end up drinking bout 12 of these and wake up pretty nasty."
"overall this is not very good, i know its a BMC but still even with those lowered standards its not very good. This beer gave me the beer farts"
"D - Not bad for a BMC product. Has a somewhat unpleasant aftertaste and nothing special in terms of flavor."
"For a macro its really not that bad. It doesnt have a skunk smell or aftertaste that another macro has that really turns me off it."
"D - This may be the worst macro lager on the list of cheapo macro lagers. It's not very nice."
"Boy did I have a lot to learn about beer...and still do."
"I was sittin' in this beer joint down in Houston, Texas. Was drinkin' Colorado Cool-Aid and talkin' to some Mexicans. And we was...what's that ya say? What's Colorado Cool-Aid? Well it's a can of Coors brewed from a mountain stream. It'll set yer head on fire and make yer kidneys scream. Oh yeah, it sure is fine. - Johnny Paycheck"
"Pours and settles an even gold with a medium white head that fades fast. Smell is weak, sweet, & airy to my nose. Starts mild and oily; rather watery, actually. Settles with a light body and a sharp, bitter flavor. Finish is unremarkable and leaves a noticeable but short-lived aftertaste."
"I was surprised by this beer. Adjuncty, yes, but there was nothing really offensive about it. If you don't want to spend more than $5 on a 6-pack, Original Coors is a solid choice."
"Going through some macro brews to get a feel for reviewing. This is the first Coors I've had in a long time. There is nothing offensive at all about this beer. The carbonation reminds me of soda and there is very little taste but many beers in this range are bad. It is very drinkable as it's light and there is no off aftertaste. I just wish it had a bit more taste as I really don't even taste much adjunct either."
"I think the main reason Coors is my favorite of the Big 3 is that its aftertaste, or lack of aftertaste compared to Bud and Miller makes it much easier to drink."
"Nose is adjuncty and refreshishing and nasty all at once. Taste is almost nonexistant with a balanced but still weak aftertaste. Light and refreshing, but so is seltzer. Mouthfeel is medium but too carbonated. Drinkable by the gallon but I would rather have an actual beer."
"This beer is really not that bad at all for a macro, the taste beats the hell out of coors light. It has a taste that reminds me a bit of corn and the aftertaste is a bit on the sweet side, the initial taste is not all that fantastic but it goes down smooth and doesn't finish bitter. I could drink this beer again, but it wouldn't become a regular in my fridge."
"Cheers!"
"perhaps the sweetest of the macros while still being very light bodied. Not Bad. Not Great either. All lagers go good with spicy/salty food but this one slightly better than most of the genre with food. Extra foamy head is extra quick at dissapearing. The original is at least much better than its silver light version which you should avoid at all cost unless you have a severe case of dry mouth. Has a distinct sweet corn kick that hits you after 1 second then becomes more unpleasant as it sit around on your palate. Not a bad ave price macro-certainly better than bud or bud lt.-Very good beer for making beer chicken or for just throwing in any Saturday cooking tailgate food."
"Besides, isn't Coors associated with the Nazis or something?"
"Coors Original (Banquet Beer) pours a typical macro yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Smells like adjunct. You can taste a little bit of hops in there with the adjunct, which is more than I expected. Slight metallic taste too. There's nothing to particularly recommend this beer. Funny how when I was a kid Coors had such a big mystique because you couldn't buy it east of the Mississippi where I lived. It sure doesn't live up to the hype."
"Coors Original was once the company's flagship product but it has been surpassed in sales by its light version. The company likes to brag about its use of Rocky Mountain Spring Water but good water alone doesn't make a great brew. Coors Original is a typical mainstream brew that is boring and bland with few redeeming qualities."
"More drinkable than some others of style. For what it is it's not bad, and if only American macros are available, it's not a bad choice."
"This beer pours a medium golden with a light head that disappears almost instantly. It has a light smell with sweet undertones. The taste is malty and sweet at first but lacks complexity. There is little feel to this beer and it finishes week. To top it off the beer has a sudsy nature that makes you feel bloated after drinking it. Over all I would say the beer is drinkable but I would rather have its light counterpart."
"Aroma is virtually nonexistent other than a slight graininess - very light. This follows through on the palate as well, taste is extremely light with hints of grain and perhaps a very subtle tinge of hops in the background. Very crisp, slight sweetness, and very clean - to the extreme. It's as if they've stripped off all of the essence of beer taste. It's not offensive by any means, but if you're looking for actual taste, this doesn't have it."
"When and if I must drink a ""big three"" macro, this is my first choice. [I grew up north of Denver. What can I say?] I had never tried Coors Original on tap, however, until going to a conference back home in Colorado. The guy at the reception bar said the keg was ""brewery fresh"" (we were 10 minutes from Golden, CO, at the time) so I tried it. He may have been right. Much better on tap than in the bottle. Not much in the color or smell department; a somewhat richer mouthfeel than expected (though still thin of moderate). Still not much hops (to speak of), but a very nice, fresh biscuity flavor with a hint of fruity hops that surprised me. Cold and drinkable. And just a tad bit better than your typical macro."
"All written above is true if your pint is properly chilled and you empty it in no more than 8 minutes. This beer is much better than Bud, Miller or Coors' own Light, but still nothing compared to craft lagers."
"Probably since Im nostalgic about my ol days of being a 18 year old in a Kansas bar, sipping on pictures of Coors while scoping out gals to dance with, I give this one a thumbs up."
"As far as the genre goes, one of the best. Not my usual cup o tea, but works well on a hot day or a cookout in the summer."
"I don't like drinking coor's light, so I was apprehensive to taste this beer. However, I was not unimpressed. It was decent. Has more taste than Budweiser. It is watered down, but not to the point that I forget that I'm drinking a beer. It's not bad at all. It has a decent color, a nice smell, and it tastes alright. Not a great beer. But judging it as an American Macro Brew it is alright."
"The pour is fizzy pale gold with a foamy white head that fades away about a third of the way in. The aroma has corn, a drop of vegetable soup, extremely faint malt and even less hops. Thankfully the nose is as weak as it is. The taste is thin and resembles beer the way a lager flavored Crystal Light mix in club soda would. Just before the halfway point, the corn really starts to stick out in all its adjunct, swill-ruining glory. At least an ice cold Budweiser can wash down food without tasting offensive. Note to self: Bring He'brew or even Goldstar next time."
"Much better than their Lite version. Better than MGD but not quite as good as Bud. Hardly ever see it on tap or in bottles around here."
"Medium straw with a white, foamy, medium-sized, quickly diminishing head. Smells of mild fruity grain. Taste is fruity, not really all that fruity but a lot more than I expected from a plain-old macro. A little berry in there. Other than that I taste cereal, light caramel and light buttery yeast. It has a thin body, lightly slick texture and moderate carbonation. Been a long time since Ive had one of these. Its actually not terrible. A bit dull, but not bad."
"Bottom line: If you're looking for Macro Lager, you can do worse. You can certainly do better too; I recommend Pabst or Strohs over the former ""Banquet Beer."""
"Notes: Comparatively speaking *almost* all brews in this category are boring and this is no exception. Pabst at least has some sort of hop presence admittedly mild but its there none the less. I'll pass on Coors products unless its the only option and in that case it would make for a decent tailgate brew, inoffensive, light and fairly crisp when cold."
"As with most other macro beers, much better served cold and out of the bottle. A clear preference over Budweiser."
"If you are tired of the ""light"" beers, try this one. You may be surprised. I put it over MGD, Budweiser, and Michelob."
"An average beer that goes well when having house parties or barbeques. It goes down easy and has no strong or bitter aftertastes. I think that this is one of the smoother and tastier beers of the big three (Bud,Miller Coors) Overall a decent beer for the average Joe."
"This Banquet is sometimes recommended as at least a somewhat superior option over Budweiser and Miller, but Im not sure I could do that; I compared this directly with MGD among others, and even with its split personality the MGD gave this Coors a very good fight. I didnt have Budweiser on hand, but I did have Bud Dry, and that too held its own. Just to be sure of things I might get the Banquet in cans, but at the moment of going to press Id have to say Coors very own Extra Gold would be a better, to say nothing of cheaper, option."
"This is my favorite of the American macro's. Pours a clear yellow with a fizzy white head that quickly fades to nothing. No lacing. I noticed something interesting the other night, this beer tastes far better from the bottle than poured into a glass (pilsner in this case). Can only mean that the smell is throwing the flavor off. Has some unleavened bread taste to me (reminds me of Saltines) and a little metallic twang. No real hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and they go down pretty easy."
"Overall, i say it is above average of it's style, but not totally around the top. Around here, i'm sure other places, it's not as available at normal bars as miller and bud are, so i dont get it so much. but it's not all that bad."
"Got this beer at a party. Doesn't taste very good. Kinda skunky with that typical marcobrew taste. I can't taste any hops or anything that might define a real beer. Not a good beer to drink, not even that good for drinking games cause it kind of fills you up. Anyways, I'll probably drink more of these later, but I probably won't enjoy them."
"D - Even though I'd like to say that this beer is good for parties or summetime quenching, there are too many other beers out there that would do the job much better. Of the Coors lineup, this one is a poor entry."
"Tastes of slight malt, slight hops, lots of water. Better than some macro lagers, but only some."
"Drinkability was average. I had two and would have been able to drink more without wretching I guess, but I was not enjoying myself. I gave up and went to soda. Definately better than Bud, might be as good as MGD depending on your mood and taste, but not for me because I don't like the extra bitterness, and think MGD's malts have a little better body. Anyway, the fact that Coors Light outsells Coors Origional should tell you all you really need to know about the level of this beer's taste."
"mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth. helps fill the beer out, but still wouldnt want much of it."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a good sized fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Weak aroma, perhaps a bit of grassy or floral hops. Taste is light sweet malt whith just a bit of bitterness in the finish. Very well carbonated with a nice smooth mouthfeel. Pretty easily drinkable. This isn't really all that bad for an american macro."
"Coors Original is a bit more flavorful vs. some of its competitiors, with a fuller, more rounded body. For what it is, and keeping the style in mind (unlike most of the other reviewers) ... it ain't all that bad."
"Pale gold topped with white foam. Head dies out rather quickly, down to a thin collar, leaving spotty lace. Weak aroma. Mostly nothing, with a touch of green apple. Vague floral hops. Very light flavor, strong carbonation. Weak malt flavor up front, actually not very clean, with a strong green apple, grass and floral flavor dominating. Minimally hopped finish. Green apple and grain aftertaste. Nothing I'd ever buy, but I wouldn't turn down a free one."
"This beer is average for a macro. Poured out of a 24oz can into a pint glass. No head. None. The color is a very light amber color. The smell is of grain. Cheap grain. The taste is somewhat more bitter and rough than the typical macro. The mouthfeel is somewhat harsh. It has a little coarsness to it but not so much that I couldn't drink a few of these around a campfire. A fairly easy drinking brew."
"This is the better of the big name domestic beers out there. It has a decent look w/ the darker color and enough head (when poured). It doesn't have much smell to it. Taste is rather smooth, as i mentioned better than alot of the domestic labels out there. mouthfeel, kinda watery, but when its really cold it is great on a hot day. Like another poster suggested, really good for sports, wings, burgers, etc..."
"Wow. I'm so glad I tapped the rockies. This is pretty average."
"Was not that bad, actually, it was a little refreshing, and the colour is very nice, golden and not green like, like other beers that a re very undrinkable. Maybe is because the corny additives are not that notorious in this beer. BUt I would bet it was worse than it really was for me, cheers!."
"From the big 3 US beers (the other two being Budweiser and Miller Genuine Draft) this would be my favourite. Like the other two it is light bodied, but unlike those it does have a distinctive taste. Actually it doesn't taste like a Lager at all, rather somewhere between an ale and a Weizen, of course diluted with water .... anyway, I will have one when in the US again and no Microbrewery is to be found ...."
"Beer better than its sister, coors light, good in appearance, taste and mouthfeel, stay in the range of american good beers for me; hops and malt well ballanced aroma, perfect for a mexican food and guacamole made in molcajete and nachos; its label its very attractive; i found only in US."
"Note: Pictures of the old brewery workers during the tour showed them enjoying something porter like and enjoying themselves. This place now seemed more like an industrial food facility."
"I'd have to say one of the better macro's, but only when very cold. I'd say drink a small amount ice cold and very quickly, otherwise leave well enough alone."
"A banquet beer. Hah. K. Whatever that means. This pours a clear pale yellow color with a very thin white head. The smell is of corn and chemicals. The taste though is smooth and clean. No malt to be tasted and barely some crisp hoppiness is detectable. Lots of cabonation. Mouthfeel is sorta thin and dry.The drinkablity on the other hand is pretty good. I would put this above bud but below miller high life."
"Its middle of the road for an American Lager. Looks brightly straw with more than average carbonation. A stark white head that wanted to hang around. No lacing to mention. Smells sweetly of light malts and smooth vegetol flavors--corn? Tastes same smooth corn sugar flavors. Light grainy and barley like. Some sourness from fermentation, albeit light. Body is round for a lager, settles toward the finish. Finishes smooth and subtle. Everything about this beer is subtle, but clean."
"Pours a solid straw color with a nice head from an agressive pour. I'm surprised at the retention. The head falls to a light coating, but it takes longer than expected. The nose is light grain and corn sweetness. Rather light, but its expected. Flavor follows suit, with a blast of corn sweetness and very light graineyness. Very crisp and enjoyable. Not a lot of harshness hanging on the finish. Well built. The feel is light to moderate with a moderate carbonation. No complaints. I'm pretty happy with this one. I have always gone towards Coors products over other domestic big guns. This was my first experience with their original and it worked well for me."
"poured a light amber color with respectable white puffy head. Smell is slightly sweet but not much else. Taste is extremely light with little malt or hops noted. Finishes with very little taste and I have to rememer I'm drinking a beer and not water. Little to offer except thirst quenching"
"I first tried this beer with a friend whom i hadent seen in four years since he joined the Marines. I must say this was a great beer to drink and catch up on old times with an old friend. It poured a very clear pale color and smelt floraly. It tasted nice and smooth and was very drinkable it keep the conversation flowing and tasted good from start to finish. And afterall thats all that matters."
"Can obtained from a local liquor store here in Colorado and consumed that same evening. Pours a full fluffy snow-white (two fingers) over a crystal clear dull and very pale yellow liquid. Many tiny streamers rush to the surface and keep the head at about a half finger. Smells weakly of malt and honey with an even fainter spice zing. Tastes watery, of course. But it's actually got a wet sweet finish with noticable hop floral. The hop floral is mostly smooth (Hallertauer) but with a small amount of tin character (Saaz, or perhaps just the metal fromt he can). Hop bitter is absent unless it's hidden beneath the sting from carbonation release. The aftertaste is much more pleasing than the actual taste, as the flavors are stronger and the malt sweeter. Light body and moderately carbonated."
"A light straw colored beer that generates a dense, three finger head, gradually turns to lacing. Smell and taste are both watered down, background malt. This beer seems more watered down than its very weak counterpart, Coors light. While not a good tasting beer, it is very refreshing and smooth. When tapping the rockies, aim to quench your thirst, rather than taste a good beer."
"September 18th is printed on the bottle, which I am assuming is the best by date. Because there is nothing bad about this beer and it is to style, it gets a good rating."
"very pale, crystal clear yellow color. 1cm head that quickly fades to some lingering soapy looking film on the to of the brew. it smells like the softball games my dad took me to when i was little. also a hint of corn. tastes very crisp and clean, not much to it. thin body but decent for the style. tastes pretty basic, kinda grainy and carbonated. not too bad for the style, probably one of the better adjunct macros."
"I think this is one of the best american adjuncts there is. It is a ballpark beer and not such a bad one. Smooth gold corn and adjuct-ish but still pretty tasty. It seems to have fallen out of favor with almost everyone,but I remember the original Coors (the banquet beer) as something that was sought after at least in New England way back when (the 70's). There are 3 american macros that I am willing to drink --they are PBR, this, and Miller high life. I think this one is the best of the 3 by far."
"Drinkability is decent, but why bother. I recall the mystique about this beer 35 years ago when it was unavailable east of the Mississippi River. Now, I'm wondering what was the big deal. Clean and crisp, easy to quaff, but lacking any significant attributes."
"Lifeless, clear pale yellow. Good sized white head with some retention. Lace is adequate as well. Light grain notes on the nose and a little adjunct like sweetness. Fizzy mouthfeel. Light body. Taste is crisp, yet unbecoming. Sweet adjuncts and grain meet little resistance from hop counterparts. Overall though, really not bad compared to other macros."
"Alright, this is what a macro-lager should be. There are no amazing flavors, but that's to be expected. Most importantly, what little flavor it does have, is pleasant. It also smooth and refreshing. Nice work Coors"
"Came back to knock down the drinkability. Had three of these watching basketball today. The Coors became increasingly difficult to drink and left a distinctly putrid taste in my mouth."
"Pale yellow color. Head starts off big then disappears to a small head. Smells very clean, sweet with a little grain. A small amount of carbonation on the tongue, and a bit of malt and grain too. A faint hop flavor is there too. Not too bad. This beer was my beer of choice in high school. This is the first time I have had it in a few years to be honest. All around a clean tasting American macro lager."
"Ignorance is bliss I guess , but this standby of people everywhere, is only barely adequate. At least the price is right, but then again, so is a Mickey's (a Miller product...which I have to say I prefer)."
"it's sometimes hard to spot original coors so i thought i'd go snoopin around for some so's i could give a review. i like the head on it after it settles. some nice lacing that makes it look like a good brew. well, despite the paleness and clarity of it. on these american lagers my nose and taste buds just aren't sensitive enough to give proper judgement concerning the amount of hop and malt aroma/taste. so i'll just say that it's not too bad and has a smooth creaminess to it that can also be found in a few euro lagers. i kinda like it. nah...it's o.k."
"Maybe I will pick some up for my next banquet. Then again maybe not, because while good for a macro lager, it pales in comparison to a pale ale (no pun intended)."
"Drink near frozen and you may finish it all. Cant hold a head and looks like macro and smells like corn macro. When it warms, forget it, taste like crap in a can although this was from a 32 oz. bottle. Don't drink this unless you're dying of thirst... literally."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - Like water. This beer is completely lacking in character and easily poundable by the 12 pack to anyone looking to get lit up quickly."
"Overall-a fine starter beer, better than Budweiser and Miller Genuine Draft due to it's appearance, smooth taste, and going down quite easy. It at least contains some flavor, so I can let this go. As a company I'm not a real fan of Coors' buisness practices (the pollution and stuff) but I will admit it's a decent beer for what your paying."
"If you're looking for a way to get drunk cheap this is certainly an option. Otherwise there's better out there if drinking beer means more to you than just that."
"Personally, I was never that excited about Coors. It's OK -- about 2.5 on a 5-point scale. Its great virtue is that it's inoffensive, and you can drink it all afternoon. But it's kind of bland with not much character. Overall, I'd rank it above Bud, but below Miller."
"The beer on the pour from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass the archetypal lager golden yellow with a smallish bright white and semi-creamy head with the left over lace a thin concealing sheet. Nose is malt sweet and crisp the start lightly sweet and has a thin grain profile with the top is light. Finish is stern in its acidity with the hops apropos to the style."
"Ahhh, but this is beer and has little to no alcohol taste. Is this beer? A bit of a rice flavor or is that corn? Even Rolling Rock has more taste but I would call RR a BEER. My choice for Ginger Ale would be Vernors. Not this."
"Plain brown bottle, stating that it is a ""Banquet Beer"". Very light smell of rice and malt. Not a lot of hops presence anywhere. For an american adjunct lager, this is a pretty good one, refreshing, but lacks any interesting characteristics."
"I am forever amazed at how adjunct lagers from BMC can continue to be brewed and consumed in such large quantities. Coors Original doesn't trigger my gag reflex, but I won't be drinking it once it warms because all bets will then be off. I guess that I'll have to blame my latent masochistic streak for the impulse to buy this can on my trip to the grocery this morning."
"Drinkability - yeah I could drink it again, but not something I'd stock."
"Ahhh only Christmas day can beat the joy of hearing the following. (Wife speaking) My co-worker is having a cookout and I told her we would be there. Ahhh Good stuff. Walk in to a Huge cooler full of Coors and Coors light. I bite the Bullet (not silver) and pour it into a plastic cup. Light light yellow. Minimal head yet seemingly endless carbonation. Smell of underripe corn, underbaked bread, and well chemical. The taste was bland, with a bizzaro aftertaste. For the first time in a while I immediately offered to be the Designated Driver. Although since the wine was White Zin my wife wasnt really thrilled. The mouthfeel was very carbonated which was good because the bubbles managed to srub away the taste. I swear i was burping this up for a half hour afterwards. I have avoided Coors products like the plague and havent bought one since Ive been drinking. Now i know why!!!! I wouldnt recommend this, and cant understand how it got a reputation as being a good beer at one point."
"Drinkability: Well this stuff is almost like gatorade. Aren't you supposed to drink it after working out to get drunk?"
"Even Coors Light is easy to drink."
"It poured very light and unexceptional with a light and pleasant sour smell. It tasted alright, though, a little bit fruity. Like Coors Light, this is as smooth as butter and lightly carbonated, so it's a good beer for people who don't really much care for beer. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, since it's still pretty beery."
"This is my favorite macro. Doesn't have much of a head when you pour it, but what macro does? This stuff goes down again and again and always taste pretty smooth and very tasty. In my opinion this American classic has more flavor then anything Bud or Miller puts out."
"Given the circumstances (read: I felt like I was standing on the sun), I thought Coors Original was an acceptable beer. It served it's purpose of cooling me down and quenching my thirst. However, given nearly any other option - an SNPA, for example - Coors Original would not be my first choice."
"ng"
"The mouthfeel is thin, but the beer is very drinkable. If your just looking for something to wash down the food with or if your not in the mood to pay any real attention to your beer, Coors fits the bill. Coors original rates behind High Life but ahead of Bud, I guess thats some kind of a victory."
"I used to be quite found of this brew pre beer enlightenment, and well before they did away with the banquet beer approach to their limited ads. Appearance: Golden straw color fizzy white head leaves quickly leaving a collar of thin lacing around my pint glass. Aroma: A corn/rice with 2 row malt sweetness, a bit of huskiness there some very mild hop tones overall clean. Taste: Not overly sweet corn flavor is heavy hops are there in the finish some soft sweetness not bad rather drink this over Coors Light, but that doesn't say much. Mouthfeel: Light bodied fizzy carbonation makes me burp like too much soda. Drinkability: Easy to consume low flavor easy drinking pretty refreshing, but there are so many better well crafted summer micros out there. From the macro perspective I prefer this one over Bud and Miller products."
"This stuff is taking up valuble beer room in my dad's fridge. So I decided to choke down the last couple bottles to get it out of the way. Pours a pale yellow with not much of a head. Faint smell of malt. That crosses over into the taste along with rice and what else chemicals the big shots over at coors decided to pump into this crap. Drinkable? It wouldn't take much effort to slam down more than a few of these. But I'm not too sure my taste buds would be too happy about that."
"My father's favorite beer. I was hoping that I would find something here worth getting nostalgic about, but there is not."
"Overall, I can't imagine drinking this beer and really enjoying it. Perhaps 4 years ago. This one really doesn't do it for me though. I have to admit, however, I kind of cheated for this review. I purchased this beer to cook a batch of bratwursts in, and as long as I had the beer open, I thought, ""why not review this beer before I cook with it?"""
"Drinkability: Again, a macro that doesn't so much as taste awful, rather, it just has no real flavor. I'll take water, thank you. Hell, I'd take lead-laden, unfiltered DC water over this."
"O.K. y'all can beat me up for it if you like, but for an American macro this is the stuff. I would choose Coors over the other two, AB and Miller any day. Why? you may ask. Because this macro actually has a little flavor as opposed to the taste of rice or corn. Plus it's brewed with mountain spring water (kidding). Overall, if I was in a bar and had to choose any of the American macros I'd pick this one. Quite satisfying if nothing else. For the price, I know alot of buzz drinkers that swear by it and for good reason. Go to the ballpark and have a tap if they have it, just for the experience."
"This beer is an American classic. Knock it if you will, but of the big three this is the best full bodied offering of them all. Smooth but not too watery, tasty and non-bitter. This brew had been around since 1873 and for good reason, it's reasonably priced and while it won't win any medals, when your gettin a case or two for a poker game with your buddies, this beer is always high on the list."
"Well, it looks like beer. Kinda. Faint hop aroma backed up by watery corn ""maltiness"". Faint wisps of flavor carried by fizzy carbonation. This is one of the thinnest beers I've ever had, and I'll drink anything. There are cheaper beers, there are better beers, and there are cheaper better beers available. The only reason I can think of for drinking this is a dare or desperation. To be fair I have had worse beers, the flavor isn't actively bad."
"2.5 out of 5 swills."
"Now I know why it took so long to drink this."
"I remember how excited people were getting many years ago when Coors was coming east. I now understand just how silly these people were. It is exactly what you'd expect of a macro, with the sparse flavor and exceedingly low presence you need to make it just as exceedingly high in drinkability. But, and this is one big but, I think that in order to be truly drinkable, you need to WANT to drink another. And I don't. Because long gone are the days when I want to drink yellow alcoholic water just to get drunk. And so I won't...and you can't make me."
"I do respect that. Plus their brewery is beautiful, a shrine in a beautiful setting for all who visit Colorado."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is above average. It has a light pale malt scent accompanied by yeasty aroma. The taste is average. It has a little more malt flavor than the light version, but that's not saying much. It is plain and dull, but goes down smooth and refreshes. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This beer with all of it's faults still drinks well. I could drink a ton of these on a hot day; a decent macro."
"taste is same, cool medium nothingness followed by this sweet candy apple foulness that grows worse with each swallow. I don't remember this being so bad...is my experience with good beer ruining bad beer for me? I guess it could be worse..."
"CONCLUSION: Drink better beers! But if you are trapped without a choice Coors, Bud, Ice House, and MGD."
"Coors isn't trying to make an award winner here. They are trying to make something that will suit those with a wide range of tastes. Of the Macro's I believe Coors to be the only one truly concerned about the quality of the beer you actually recieve. They want you to get a good fresh beer. The others seem to be content that you don't get a spoiled beer."
"I bought some of this to boil some brats but I figured I'd take a break from heavier winter brews and try one. It pours a pale straw with a fleeting, effervescent head. What little smell there is is slightly floral and sweet. There's a kind of vegetal husk / graininess going on in the flavor, malt is almost non-existent. Still, it's crisp and clean, moreso than Bud or Miller. Amongst the larger brewers, I'd choose this before Budweiser or Miller, with the exception of Miller Hi Life which edges this brew in malt flavor. Good for cooking or lawnmower style thirst quenching."
"I'm still having a hard time believing the real thing is exported to Moscow, I bought this bottle to see just how good the counterfeiters are. Not bad, actually, as the taste is much as I remember it. Pours a standard straw gold under a short-lived fizzy one finger white head that manages to linger as film and collar for at least a while. The nose is very mild, with corn more than anything else. The mouth is quite prickly and heavy with grain. The taste opens very sweet, with some malt to balance the corn. No discernible hops anywhere around, the aftertaste is much like old rotten socks, but in a good way. Great by no means, I've had worse beers. Not many, but some."
"coors baby! raiders can! what can i say, im a die hard fan (shut up and dont mention their current losing record). this poors out pale yellow, if you even pour it out of the can. smell? is there one? taste wise, its crisp and clean, a tiny tiny bit of hops. a refreshing american lager. a bit watery in the mouth, but so what. people slam this beer left and right, but the hell with them. this is a decent brew that fits the bill when selection and price are skimpy. and who wants to wash down some spicey bbq with an imperial stout anyway?"
"Pale pale, some head. Smell is pleasant with some strawberry esters, a bit of banana, diacetyl, and faint earthy hops. Taste starts OK, but quickly dries out and disappears, leaving me wanting so much more. Thin body with harsh carbonation. This is a good beer to drink if you don't like beer, because it really is virtually flavorless. If are like me and do like the taste of beer, however, drink something else."
"In other words, WOOOO!!!"
"A few years ago. this was my beer of choice to have on the beach. I like it better than Bud, but it is a pretty weak and unimpressive beer. Has a decent aftertaste, and there is nothing off-putting about it. More taste than Bud, a little more body than High Life. Very pale color, slight head and retention. If you can get Yuengling, skip the big three."
"Wow. That is just about all I can say. An amazing brew. Very smooth, and flavorful with hints of corn barley and oats. Poured out to a smooth golden color with a well formed white foamy head. Out of all the macro brews on the market today, Coors has some of the best beers you can get. This brew is proof of it. Give a sixer a try. I think you'll be impressed!"
"its close to scraping the bottom of the barrell, but here in oz, this is the best crappy u.s beer you can get. i mean, would anyone rather a corona?"
"The original banquet beer it says. I don;t know about that, but it's not too hard to eat stuff with it. There are actually only a few beers that I can drink and eat with them, and this is one of them. I thought it had a very wheaty taste, a little light, but what do you expect for a macro. They have to produce something that's going to attract chicos and chicas. I thought it smelled quite hoppy and wheaty, with a hint of citrus. Straw colored with a fluffy white head that lasted a few minutes. Very carbonated and bubbly on the toungue. I like it better than the Coors light aka Colorado Kool-Aid."
"Here's a product of a typical ubiquitous American ""factory"" brewery. Beer sports a one dimensional flavor bouquet. The flavor is mildly hoppy where the hops instill a bitter tone on the palate but not much else. Theres no particular body foundation supporting the hops flavor hence the ""one dimensional"" moniker. I liken the flavor character to a simple multicolored line drawing where all the colors have faded save one. One positive note- Coor's Original didnt have the ""chewing on a dowel"" aftertaste of its nemesis--Bud. Nertheless, in my opinion, mediocre.."
"Fizzy gold color. Small head. Aroma is slightly of corn and grain. I will admit my beer snobbery here and admit I only drank this stuff because, it was free and it was the best beer available. I am also sure that there are picture, suitable for blackmail, which will circulate of me drinking this stuff. Enough said, on with the review. Typical fizzy yellow beer flavor. Malts and hops are all but non-existent. Corn and a vegetable flavor are evident. Its much better ICE cold, as the objectionable flavors are not as evident as when it warms up. Vegetable, medical and corn YUCH!! Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is neutral."
"I like just about anything made from the Coors Brewing company. Coors Original is a great beer, honestly I like Coors Light better though. I am impressed with the little amount of carbonation in the beer considering the fact that it is processed at a macrobrewery. It has a pretty decent mouthfeel, much better then most beers. However, out of all the beers brewed in Colorado, I would say I like this one the least, but hey, it gets the job done dammit, and thats all that really matters."
"Drinkability  Unless youre a big fan of Cornish Ale, I would skip this one."
"I could drink quite a few of these. A better brew that its lighter counterpart. It has a distinct fruity taste to it. Almost like Rolling Rock (which isn't pleasant) but it's own. If I went for a macro this would probably be the one. I guess for me it is the best of the worst."
"This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized white bubbles and a transparent weak rice yellow body. What aroma there is is slightly hoppy. It's very fizzy initial flavor is followed by a mild weak fizzy corn meal flavor. I'd rate it a little better than Bud or Miller, but not up to any real beer lovers standards."
"Ultra pale yellow hue, frothy white head, excellent size (a healthy finger & a half), fair retention, soapy it produced a few thick rings of lace. The nose is all too familiar; sweetness dominates (a combo of adjuncts and malt?), soft fruitiness, hints of grain metal. Not inviting regardless I took a sip yielding palate with pleasant mingling of soft grassiness, hops, and grain again there is a soft fruitiness (like young strawberries). The finish is ideally quick nicely crisp and refreshing minimal aftertaste, medium-light body, ideal carbonation. I could drink this one again in a pinch. Not a bad offering from the Big-3."
"24oz.can. This beer poured a small white head with small bubbles that quickly dissolved. There was very little lacing to speak of on the sides of my glass. There was a lot of carbonation present which is typical of American mass-produced beers. It was yellow-gold in body color. It was watery and had very little taste to it. It lacked character which is also typical of American mass-produced beers."
"Straw colored with a bit of a light head and some acitve effervescence. Smell is slight and a bit skunky. Subtle but bland grains characterize the taste--certainly nothing interesting here. Mouthfeel is a bit clingy, which is no fun given that there is little flavor present. The best feature of this beer is its lowest common denominator drinkability."
"Coors Original used to be smuggled east of the Mississippi years ago. Friends of mine in colorado have always raved about this beer and said it was the greatest of all mass produced beers. I was at the ballgame awhile ago and found a bar that was seving this in a bottle, so I picked one up. At first taste I was quite impressed for being an american mass produce beer. Coors Original is definetely better than any Anheiser Busch or Miller products. With that said I didn't especially think it was great or average for that matter and was suprised it came with such high praise.The head was very small even compared to bud and the only great taste I could detectcwast the sublte hint of hops but my final review will have to be, if you like mass produced beers try this for it is the best, otherwise just leave it alone."
"Freshness date is 4/20/03. Really clear with some carbonation bubbles on the side, not much of a head. Tastes really watery and much like any of the big macros we all have come to dread. This ones on the better end of that spectrum however. Not recommended."
"Pale yellow, crystal clear. A small head reduces to a coating all too quickly. The aroma is grainy and sweet and that's about it. And that's about it for flavor. Nothing much, just some sweetness and high carbonation. I found it less overly zingy than Coors Light though. It's better than Coors light for sure. It's not a standout by any means though."
"All in all I am not impressed..but its certainlly not horrible."
"This is the first beer I ever tried and it is the beer I grew up with, so it has a special place in my beer drinking history....but that does not make up for the fact that it is a average brew. It pours a light golden color with a decent head, and it smells processed right off the bat. There is no definable smell from the beer other than cheap and the taste is very bitter unless it is out of a bottle. Out of the bottle, I can detect a little bit of hops in there but not much, and it still has a little of that bitter quality. And it is not a bitter in a good sense, it is bitter as in skunky. I guess if you are in need of a cheap macro, this is better than Bud, but not something I would ever choose unless it was in complete desperation."
"Well have this one COLD and be very thirsty as well. No body or taste as this is a thin lager/pilsner or whatever they sell it as. It is slightly better than Coors Light but if you are drinking this beer hopefully it's the only one at a party and if so look for water it has more depth to it."
"Poured a wheat/straw color with a thin white head that quickly disapperead. Not a strong aroma comes from this beer but you could smell some wheat/malt not strong at all. Taste was wheaty, with lots of carbonation. This isn't the worst tasting beer in the world, I've had much worse. Very watery and easy to drink, you can just down these as quickly as they come."
"Pours straw with a small white head. Very bubbly. Taste is mildly malty, with significant graininess. Hops are there, but weak. This has a very chemical taste to it, somewhat ""tinny"". Beer feels smooth at the finish with grains biting to the end. Not bad. Better that Bud."
"I remember when we couldn't get Coors east of Big Muddy and it was a treasured prize to be brought back to buddies after a roadtrip to Colorado. It is still much better than the typical mass-produced strain of American lagers. The appearance is nothing to write home about as it is light gold or yellow with little head. Despite its somewhat watery feel, I find the taste to have a pleasant fullness that impresses of its grain heritage and creates a slightly creamy sense. Drinkable and consistent, it would be great if more spots offered the Original and not the ever-present Lite."
"The appearance was just like you see in between boob shots in Coors commercials. Its highly transparent, has a brief foam head, and keeps its carbonation. There was very little bitterness, which is a sign of weakness out here. Its really quite an exact beer, but there's little flavor, and once I'd finished, I wasn't sure I had had a beer, but sure enough, my glass was empty. I never bough Coors because I didn't like the company, its advertising, and now I know I don't like their beer."
"Taste = Crisp, clean taste. Medium sweet, a light body. There's light malt, light hops on a short finish. Mouthfeel 'thin' yet pleasant. As I said, it's 'crisp'. It's not the best beer you've ever had, but it's far from the worst. You can certainly drink more than one of these, and if you're at a party you certainly should. If you're at a bar, you should ask again if they have any microbrews or imports on hand (hey, how else you gonna learn?)."
"This beer poured into the glass a clear straw color. The head was small, white, and there was no density to it. I really noticed no lace present. The aroma was slightly floral, and corn, very simple. The taste was better then there “light”. Clean crisp and light, again better then there “light”. I noticed hints of sweet malt, corn and some slight floral hops, and well carbonated. These flavors tasted different then the craft/micro beers that I am used to. You could tell that it was a macro-beverage. I would drink this again if the choices did not include anything micro."
" IMHO this is KING OF BEERS!"
""
"Overall, this is a decent, non-offensive beer. I don't know if I could classify it as an American Pilsener as I would expect more hop presence from that style.  If this were labeled a light beer, it would be a decent light, but we have to take it for what it is, and in my opinion its an average American standard lager."
"Pours an ultra-clear pale golden color with a white soap-bubble-like head (even sounds soapy with the fizz of popping bubbles).  The strong smell of a twangy corn are present with nothing else, although I searched and sniffed and searched again.  Tastes of a weird twang with semi-sweet corn are present   I can barely stomach this stuff, but I'll take one for the team here ;-).  Those commercials with all those ""original"" sports stars made me do it.  The mouthfeel is very light bodied and finishes with a crisp clean carb bite, although lightly.  Better than the light version, but not much else good to say.  Cheers anways!"
"now, i have heard of this beer being decent to fairly good in montana and colorado, but i can't see how it is possible from the way it was here. i'd take it over a bud, but i'd take a kick in the balls by a mule before either one"
"Light yellow in color with the taste of a hint of banana's. There is just nothing to be excited about! Drank it years ago and tried it over a friends house and I still think of it as ""Colorado Kool-Aid. Sorry if I offended anyone! But this beer is close to wessil piss!"
"Crystal clear and straw gold in color with a 1/2"" dense creamy head that holds OK but soon drops to a thin surface covering. It leaves some minor lace about the glass. The aroma is mainly of a mild grainy malt with some minimal hops mixed in, and a bit of sulphur. It's also slightly fruity. The body is light/medium with a very fine and moderate carbonation that leaves it crisp but smooth in the mouth. The flavor is reflective of the aroma: a semi-dry maltiness with minimal hop flavors that are so buried in the malt that they appear just slightly grassy like fresh straw, some light fruitiness (gentle strawberry?), and a slightly crisp sulphur that actually helps give the beer some character. It finishes crisp with a gently lingering maltiness. Refreshing and enjoyable."
"Light yellow, in comes out the way it went in. This is the one mass produced pilsner beer that I will drink on occasion. It can be refreshing on a hot day. Must be drank cold, at least for me, to kill any sense that it might be beer."
"Absolutely clear, straw-colored brew with no real head. Doesn't smell too bad for a macro, a little malt and a little hops. Despite the smell, there is almost no malt flavor, and zero hops. Instead, there is corn sweetness and a bit of grain on the finish. Any taste is completely overpowered by the carbonation; there is way too much. The carbonation actually imparts flavor to this beer, that carbonic acid taste that you find in seltzer! I actually used to prefer this over the other macros, but now that I've actually taken a close look at this, I'm not so sure."
"Not that different from Budweiser. Makes a very large head initially, but that is because of over carbonation. Head recedes to a flat rim that is almost infinitesimal. A very low quality fragrance no real hop or, otherwise, pronouncing aromas.  Bland taste a very watery mix. Soda pop like burn on the tongue and gaseous trails all the way down."
"Clear pale golden color with lots of carbonation, pours a thick white head that lasts a minute or so, modest lace, heavily carbonated.  Rather sweet aroma with some faint floral notes. Taste begins with sweet malts, which the aggressive carbonation quickly overwhelms, followed by washed out hops.  Finish is clean and crisp.  There is not a lot here, I'm afraid.  This is a beer I really liked in college, but with the passage of time, if all goes well, our tastes do improve."
"Now here's some straw color, clear with a head that's down to a fine layer of small bubbles quickly. A slightly grassy aroma, a little hops, not very interesting. The malt flavors have little chance to establish themselves, the brew diminishes extremely early in flavor. Tight in profile, I can see how people get used to it, but very limited in anything that represents a memorable taste, other than a vague stale aftertaste. Sweeter than a Bud, less cooked carrot than a Miller. Hops are on the light side for a macro, but somewhat less soapy than some."
"Stripped of flavour and very clean though the aroma is off, tastes like a great beer to cook with … as for putting down a case of the stuff I’ll pass."
"How'd I miss this one...?   Pours to a very golden color, decent head that goes away very quickly.  Taste is that of light malt with some residual sweetness.  Is it good or bad?  Neither.  A very neutral offering."
"Coors Banquet Beer, will sneak up on you if your not careful, it goes down that well."
"Well, this is what it is.  There is no gray area on this one.  Either you love it, or you hate it.  I tend to favor the latter.  The only thing going for it really is the head, which quickly dissipates anyway.  A beginner beer at best as it brings little to the party in the way of flavor or aroma."
"Crystal clear yellow color....thin rocky white head. Laced down the glass nicely. Grainy sweet smell, not overly offensive. Very beerlike, like the stuff you would sneek out of your dad fridge back in '90. Taste is somewhat grainy, very sweet, and crisp. Crisp, bubbly refreshing pilsener finish...A pleasant surprise....Highly charged carbonation (Not Hops) burps that only Venom could appreciate. Paired with a cheese topped chunky chicken noodle soup it was very refreshing. Not a beer to savor on it's own, but pairs well with meals. I don't know if it's the high country barley or the Rocky Mountain water, but I stand before my ba brothers and proudly proclaim, I enjoy an Original Coors now and then......."
"This is just bad beer.  The only thing going for it is that it's not Coors Light.  It looks like every other macro but tastes worse than Miller and Bud--or really tastes less than Miller and Bud.  Despite being watery, it's not even a good thirst-quencher because it has an unpleasant sweet aftertaste.  I grew up in the west where Coors was always available, so the mystique associated with its unavailability is lost on me."
"Light yellow in color with medium head. Lasts for a decent time. Thin lace tries to cling to side of glass.  Smells slighty metallic and grainy. Very clean tasting and smooth drinking.  Slightly bitter with very light malt.  Corn adjunct taste is noticible.  Finishes slightly dry and smooth with a trace of bitterness.  I have new respect for this beer."
"I might be one of the older people on this site.  I remember when you couldn't get this beer in the Midwest.  Remember ""Smokey and The Bandit""?  Once we could get it, I couldn't see what all the fuss was about.  I would pick Budweiser or Miller over this macrobrew."
"12/01/04-New note...really a clean looking beer....pretty tasty and sweet while also being easy drinking....Still one of my favorite macros...probably better than MGD but a notch below High Life..ratings remain the same as they seem on the mark still.."
"I was thinking it'd be better than Budweiser. For some reason I always got that impression. In any case it's very bland. A little more water and it'd be Dassani."
"I expect a metallic taste if drinking from a can, but it tasted like metal right out of a glass bottle.  Not very good."
"Hopefully every bottle of this I have ever tried has been skunked, becasue I don't think it is legal for a beer to taste as bad as this does. It's original all right--brewed with pure rocky mountain goat tinkle."
"Man, some of you guys are really harsh.  I can at least give it points for the good memories that I have of driving from Austin to Dripping Springs, Texas, in 1974, when Dripping Springs was as far south as they sold the stuff.  And of smuggling a case of the stuff back from Dallas on a high school trip in 1973 (when 18-year-olds could drink!).  Original Coors still beats Budweiser, if you ask me.  The original cult beer."
"A very basic brew.  I wont say I hate it, if there is nothing else at the time, a cold one of these will quinch the dirst.  Not particularly malty, not particulary bitter.  Bland?  Perhaps.  Couple of raw barely notes here.  A barleyish smell, but something isn't right, corn?  Not a big fan of the yellow urine color.  But it does stay carbonated in my glass and has a decent head initially."
"Thought I would just throw this one in for discussion.  Pale straw color.  Don't think I can pour it from a sufficient height to generate a head.  Front is slightly fruity/apple with a bland, sort-of-there hops finish.  The label proclaims ""the original banquet beer.""  What the heck is a banquet beer?  And to think that people used to drive across the country for it before it was nationally distributed."
