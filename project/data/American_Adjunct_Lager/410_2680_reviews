"Regardless, if it were at a party, I'd take it instead of a budweiser any day."

"Pours a clear yellow color with a white head that totally dissipated within 60 seconds. Not much taste at all. I will not buy this again."

"I thought this is a perfectly serviceable AAL. On par with Old Milwaukee."

"It really only comes into it's own when you drop a shot of Jack Daniels into it and guzzle it down. Cuts through the dirt and dust of a hard day's work and makes you proud to be a Steeler's fan."

"Out of the can it pours the typical yellow tinge of an American Adjunct Lager - nothing overly special.  The scent of the brew is just not appealing to me.  However, I did note some hints of citrus and spice in the overall flavor mixing well with the hops - so that was a plus.  Overall it's not quite okay, but it's certainly not the worst I've had."

"This beer is a comfort beer for me.  I grew up around Pittsburgh and Iron City was alway supporting the local sports teams (Steelers, Pirates, and Penguins).  I like it because it reminds me of my favorite city, Pittsburgh!, or should I say Sixburgh."
""
"Pours a hazy honey yellow in color with a thin white head. Some spotty lacing was seen with each sip but settled back down the sides of the glass. The aroma is of sweet corn for the most part. The taste is about the same and actually surprised how sweet this beer is! Sweet corn and grains for the most part. Very slight dry finish. Overall, it was just OK."

"I made the mistake of trying this beer with a buddy of mine who claimed that it was a ""classic."" I'm not going to waste time with an in depth review but believe me when I say that it was the worst beer I've ever had. Maybe I shouldn't have tried it after having drank several good craft brews before allowing it to pass my lips. I'm not 100% sure. Either way, it won't be something I drink again unless it's In post apocalyptic world and it's the only beer I can find. The only thing good about Iron City was the laugh it provided my buddy as I spit it out."

"Tastes the same going in as it does going out. Avoid unless you're deeply (and delusionally) nostalgic. If you gotta go Pennsylvanian, then go Yuengling or Troegs or even Rolling Rock before you go here. Pitt has a lot of other things going for it: Warhol, Stellers, U Pitt, etc. The beer ain't one of those things."

"I have to qualify my feelings about IC beer. I do NOT like heavy hops IPA beers. A lot of mentions of ICB tasting like piss. I've never drunk piss, but I imagine the piss of an old drunk would taste like an IPA. I drink beer because I'm thirsty and I like a little buzz when I'm home on the weekends. ICB is refreshing, and doesn't make me want to go gargle to get rid of the obnoxious taste in my throat. Somebody mentioned PBR in their comparison with ICB. I really don't care for the the taste of PBR, or a heavy IPA when I'm thirsty, and that's the only time I drink beer. I don't give a crap about the head and how long it lasts - could we be a little more pretentious? Lacing? JC Almighty - it's BEER. I like a beer without a sour aftertaste, like most IPA's I've tried. I like Iron City Beer. I don't know what's wrong with your noses, I have never smelled any of the odors others have described. Maybe they should pick there noses and blow them before they drink. I wish ICB was distributed in VA, but it isn't. When my MIL was still alive, and we'd go visit her, I'd bring back 6 cases of IC Light, and a couple of regular IC. Beer drinkers that try to act like wine connoisseurs are a little over the top for me. It's beer, enjoy it when you're thirsty. If you want to get drunk drink Jack. I find is tastes and, smells very good, and it is refreshing."

"O: It is not as bad as some of the other offerings in the style (especially the BMC offerings). I could easily put back a couple of these when tailgating with grilled foods but not really interesting enough to have regularly."
""
"My first mistake was probably getting it in can form, It had a slightly skunky metallic odor to it. Much Like a can of Steel Reserve. Right then and there I decided not to bother pouring it into a glass, I didn't want to dirty another dish for nothing. The taste screams ""malt liquor"" only it doesn't have all the alcohol percentage to make up for the bad taste. The flavor I can only describe as if someone cooled a molten rod of steel into some watered down horse piss. It had a carbonation sting at the tip of my tongue and coats the back of my throat like phlegm from a mild cold. And then, after only one beer comes the headache. It was 9.50 for a 12 pack, I could have made a better choice but I wanted to try something new. I probably wont drink it again unless a tribal chief of headhunters gave it to me as a gift and I was afraid of insulting them by not drinking it therefore having my head wind up on a pike."

"But who cares? It's Iron City. Just shut up and drink it like a man."

"Overall, this is basically what I expect out of Pittsburgh, a subpar beer. Oh well, they give us the Steelers, ans this. Not really sure which one is less offensive frankly."
""
"O: *sigh* I'm feeling generous. 1.75 since it had a bit of utility as a quick fix to the age old ""Why don't we have any beer?"" conundrum. Everyone should try drinking a 12 oz.er at least once in his/her life, just to know where some of the lower-limits on industrial beer production exist."

"I've been circling this one like an uninterested ticking vulture (an endangered species) for a while now, only now getting around to actually trying it. Gotta love mixed sixers, amiright? This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet corn, lightly funky wheat, and hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a strange twinge of lemon-like fruit that just seems out of place and enhances a heretofore low-lying metallic quality. The body is fairly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a limp little beer, one that just makes me wonder why I'm not just drinking water."

"Pale, even for an adjunct lager-looks more like a light lager. Looks can be deceiving though, as the aroma is a complex mix of corn and caramel with some bready notes. Taste is heavy on the corn and grain at first, with some apple coming through as the beer gets warmer. Very dry flavor with no noticeable must or bitterness. From what I recall of the canned version, which I had last winter, this one is a lot more pleasant to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ Mostly an average American adjunct lager but possibly a slight bit above average as its flavors are a bit on the more potent and easy drinking side."
""
""
"O: Tastes pretty much like a macro, maybe slightly better. Very light and easy to drink. If you're looking for something cheap to drink while mowing the lawn and aren't in the mood for PBR, this is an apt replacement."
""
""
""
"If your going to drink other undistinguished beers like Budweiser, Pabst, or Miller, give Iron City a shot."
""
""
""
""
"Iron City won't win any brewing medals, but keep a six pack in the fridge and you won't find anyone turning it down at a party."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a good beer to drink at ball games and local sporting events or where ever"
""
""

"So there it is. Have some neighbors from PA who probably worship the stuff. So that's what they will be served at my Super Bowl party in two weeks."

"Enjoy drinking local beers when I am out of town so gave this a try because its been in Pittsburgh for awhile but pretty not owned locally anymore, regardless gave it a try. Didn't enjoy it that much. Sometimes can beer doesn't taste the best but still didn't like the taste nor the mouthful. Smell was sub par and had left a bad aftertaste with me. Wouldn't recommend it."
""
""
"Thin and astringent, harsh metallic tang, perceptible alcohol. Slightly fruity aftertaste, but not enough to redeem it. Papery, wet, mealy, soggy crackers. The astringency is awful, and a real dealbreaker here. Not real sure why this is Iron City's flagship beer, it's terrible."

"This is my first Iron City since leaving PA. I can see why I had so many of these in college. For the style, it's better than most."
"RJT"
"Overall: this is a plain-Jane lager. It is better than a lot of adjunct lagers I've had, but it is not a particularly good or exciting beer."
"O: Nothing wrong with an old school beer once in a while. Better than most of the BMC offerings."
"D-No thanks, don't have to try this again it is a big beer in Pittsburgh but I can do with out trying this one again."
"Overall: Not something I would buy again."
"seems like this brand is on the downfall. I got it because it was cheap and chose it because it was local but don't really think its Pittsburgh's true beer anymore. Wasn't that fascinated by it and didn't have much of a taste either. Had a bad aftertaste and would prefer many more beers in front of this one."
"taste - tastes like a cheap american beer, but I'd take this over a Bud or Miller any day, if only to drink something regional and local."
"Overall: Neither bad nor good, but leaning towards the good side."
"The cpj"
"Eh."
"M: The mouthfeel is creamy, quite sweet. In one fell swoop I can cross Primanti Bros. and IC off my bucket list; I wasn't impressed with either."
"Overall I will probably never buy this again. Just bought it because I've always seen it and heard of it. I would rather buy a cheaper BMC product."
"Mouthfeel: did I just drink something? Overall: this is what I left behind when I started drinking craft beer, and it's good to be reminded why I won't accept any crap on tap."
"D: Overall not a beer I would buy again, except perhaps for the novelty of it, like if I was in pittsburgh, or wanted to punish someone."
"Well, for a beer of this type it's pretty good. A lot beefier in terms of taste than other Adjunct Lagers. It pours a nice yellow color but the smell I'm not crazy about. Drink is alright, drinkable but not something I would seek out in the future."
"D: The beer isn't very interesting, but it wasn't a drain pour because it has enough flavors and body to keep it from being watery."
"D-this goes down easily. i do not regret getting an entire 6-pack for the game, but seeing how this game is progressing...i might need to upgrade to something stronger."
"On the plus side there are some hop notes and the malt is sweeter than many cheap beers, well balanced for a cheap beer."
"Usually drink this when I visit Pittsburgh. Apperance is actually good for this type of lager light golden with a half inch thick creamy,frothy white head..that actually sticks around. Aroma however is the usual sour corn mash cardboard mess!! Taste is better than the aroma..the corn is there in abundance but mt so sour and the malts actually seem nice and present.Nice semi sweet finish. Good on the palate, that is above average for style. Goes down well.Overall a nice American lager..reminds me a bit of Full Sail's Session..simple traditional American beer."
"I would much prefer this to most any macro product out there. I haven't had to many ""craft"" adjunct lagers but hopefully I can try more of those soon. I bought this because it reminded me of the Steelers and I needed to finish a mix 6 pack (was looking for stuff I haven't had). Will I buy this again? Doubt it but was worth a try"
"A clear, pale gold complexion, with a medium head. Looks and feels a lot like it's mainstream lager cousins, as the scent and flavor are grainy, with hints of corn and honey. Light-bodied, but crisp nonetheless, with a malty adjunct feel. Not spectacular or memorable, but a solid light lager that more than holds it's own against the corporate beers."
"D: Alright for a lawnmower beer, but not by much. Overly adjunct/cooked corn sweetness. Not enough balance (no noticeable hops, very little malt character). I would almost rather have a BL lime."
"Pours a light golden color with a fast receding head that fades just as quickly as it forms, leaving just bubbles on the surface of the beer. Aromas of faint, faded malts make their way into the nose, along with notes resembling creamed corn from the can, a bit of lime or citrus, sweetness and some spicyness. This beer is overly sweet, while at the same time lacking a decent malt presence to balance it out. Their is a faint hoppiness that is hardly noticeable, while definite adjunct notes are present. Alcohol is just barely noticeable in the taste. Very light body with a decent carbonation profile. Overall, this beer is way too sweet and very unbalanced. Avoid."
"D- These Adjunct lagers are what they are. Easy to drink but lacking in flavor."
"Picked this up as a testing beer while brewing my 3rd batch of beer. My friend is from Pittsburgh so we gave it a try. We were not impressed. It was lighter than expected, sort of had a funky smell similar to that of Steel Reserve. Not the worst beer I've ever had, however the remaining bottles from the 6 pack will probably sit in my beer fridge until I finally decide to pour them out. When poured into a glass it did not retain much head and very little streaking on the sides of the glass."
"Bought at 'Lifesource"" Salem. 12 oz single. Apperance is actually good for this type of lager light golden with a half inch thick creamy,frothy white head..that actually sticks around. Aroma however is the usual sour corn mash cardboard mess!! Taste is better than the aroma..the corn is there in abundance but mt so sour and the malts actually seem nice and present.Nice semi sweet finish. Good on the palate, that is above average for style. Goes down well.Overall a nice American lager..reminds me a bit of Full Sail's Session..simple traditional American beer."
"D-No thanks. I was surprised to see there is one ""want"" for this beer."
"Good tail gating beer at Steelers Games. Nothing Special about this beer though other than its name in my opinion. Fun to drink, but it will leave you wanting your comfort beer. The taste is crisp but a tad bitter in the after taste. The apperance is bland. But hey, Go Steelers. Definately worth a taste in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"Overall this was just the kiss of death for my night, no more for me."
"D- i always have at least one in Pittsburgh but other than that its not a great beer. easy to throw back though but no flavor."
"Poured with a straw color and a non existent head. Sporadic carbonation. Smells like metal and corn....not pleasing. Tastes like corn flakes, hay, and a nickle all at the same time. Very sweet and thin. Its adjunct lager and it passed the mouthfeel test for this style. You can drink this at a football game particularly the steelers."
"D - you could probably drink this in place of water as there is no actual ""bad"" flavor, but why bother?"
"Light bodied, medium carbonation, decent drinkability. I bought the sixer in Colorado and will finish the other cans but there's no reason to revisit."
"D- pretty much the high point- and only point in buying- as with any run of the mill BMC"
"Buy Again? Only in Pittsburgh."
"Taste is a little sweet. Bonus. No hops, barely cooked malt. Very watery. No mouthfeel, just the same barely there affect going on. Drinkable like water, but a little pricey for what it is. Pretty hard to drink, can't see what you would be doing drinking this unless you wanted a buzz and hated your life."
"I buy this for Steeler's parties and the like as it is from near the burg and is usually really cheap. If I am looking for a better local beer (usually), I buy Yuengling or something from the Curch."
"PBR is a much better cheep beer. But this is better than some beers like the beast. Not something I will buy or give to someone I consider a friend."
"Not horrible but not too impressive either. I can see it going ok with a pizza or on a warm day full of yard work. Otherwise, steer clear of this."
"Not much to say about this beer. I know it has a following but it is not for me."
"Ok, I love Iron City. It may be from the history or something, I don't know. Always loved drinking it at Steelers games, so I may be a little biased. I still like though. Have to admit, have not tried it since it is now brewed in Latrobe. It may not be the same, but I have always thought Iron City is what represents Pittsburgh. It has been there since the the 1800's."
"D: I have to say, I was fairly warned and this beer lived up to it's nickname. If given the option between this and bud light - I'd go to bud light...provided water wasn't even available."
"It seems to me that now they are making it in Latrobe they have compeltely changed it for the worse and I hate that as I compared a can of the Old with the new tonight and the Old was wonderful and like drinking good sweet corn and this is nothing like the Iron City I drank for many years Sadly. Someone Has competely Changed its makeup."
"Meh. If this was all that was available I could drink it as long as I'm not paying."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hints of corn. Taste is crisp, some corn and malts. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this beer is the definition of mediocre, in every catagory."
"Overall I'm glad my buddy got this for me. I know never to pick it up if I'm ever in the Burgh."
"This is way too sweet and uninteresting to make it a very drinkable beer."
"I don't care for the yellow fizzy lagers of Bud, Miller, and Coors. But there is something about a regional yellow fizzy lager that I feel better about drinking. There isn't much there, just a faint taste of malt and the basic rice and corn adjuncts. But its drinkability is pretty good, wouldn't be too hard to quaff quite a few of these, with hardly any aftertaste. Though it does need to be quite cold."
"I am redoing my review on this one. I actually don't mind the tatse of this beer. It goes down pretty smooth, not alot of carbonation, and at a ball game it's pretty good. However, this beer gives me a headache. I ran into someone who sells beer, and he mentioned off hand it does the same to him. He says the water used to make this beer is bad, with alot of impurities in it, thus causing the headaches. Too bad, because it's a very drinkable beer to me."
"A hard pour only produced a thin layer of head which vanished all too quickly. A little skunky smell, which is somewhat surprising given that it was in a brown bottle. Judging by the taste I would say this is an all malt lager and not an adjunct lager. Hops give only the slightest bit of bitterness in the aftertaste."
"If this were priced like a macro, I'd say this would be a run of the mill lawnmower beer like many others, and would pick this over the 3 usual co.'s choices just to support an independent brewery. However, seeing as this is priced at over $6 per 6-pk, I'll either buy a much better micro or I'll pick up a 30-pk of MHL when I want a lawnmower beer."
"Its gold in color, white head, skunky smell, bitter taste. Enough said."
"Pours a clear light yellow color with a small head. Nothing really good looking about it. There is no complexity to the aroma, it smells faintly of grains. The taste is much of the same it taste along the lines of grain, however, it taste more of water. The mouthfeel is very carbonated. Overall drinkability there is no real aroma and no real taste it is kinda just blah. Not much too it, needs at least some complexity."
"D - Goes down very easy. I was surprised that the taste was actually not bad for an adjunct lager. I could find myself going for another pretty easily."
"D- easy to drink nothing to it .. no body or outstanding flavors"
"D - Due to the lack of bitterness and no complex flavors to explore, this is a very light and easy to drink beer. But just not that flavorful to drink and enjoy."
"D-An old stand-by regional brew that fills in the nostalga niche. This is nothing to write home about or crave unless your from Da' Burgh. Another lifeless example of an American Macro Pils. Why do people drink this stuff on a regular basis? Give me a quality pils, hefe or helles if I need something ""crisp and refreshing""!"
"D: okay to drink"
"Easy to drink due to the light flavors, but isn't flavor the reason to drink in the first place?"
"16oz bottle poured into bubble pint glass. Poured a bright, clear yellow with about 3/4 on an inch of bright, white head leaving just the tiniest possible amount of lacing. A strong stale beer aroma was most prominent in the nose. Slight skunk taste on the back of the tongue, otherwise no noticeable flavors. Typical body for the style. Typical drinkability for the style, that's to say you can pour 'em back like water. Except for the aroma this would be an acceptable version of the style, as it is there are better Cheap American Lagers."
"Honestly this beer is not very appealing. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, and I would probably pass it over if there was just about anything else on the shelf. Instead of buying this, I would recommend getting anyone of your mass produced major beers that are on the market. If you are looking for just a beer to drink and you could get this on sale, okay, but it's nothing special. Overall I was less than impressed with this beer."
"I don't think it's much as far as a beer goes, but it does seem to capture the feel of the city"
"D: The off-flavours don't make for a clean easy drinking lager, pass on this one."
"Drinkability is OK because it is not too bitter, or not to tasty."
"This wasn't the worst adjunct beer as some people would call it. It had an even finger and a half of white head over a pale straw body with plenty of carbonation bubbles. There was not much for lace but what lace did exist was pretty spread out. It had an average mass produced lager aroma. Slightly malty and hoppy. The taste was metallic, spicy, with some grain and sour apple like flavors. The mouthfeel was thin and even. It wasn't a horrible beer but it wasn't a beer I would go searching for."
"The taste has similar qualities, definitely it has a standard macro-adjunct pale lager character to it, but it's slightly unique. It tastes mostly of fermented bread dough and apple cider with some musty grain and a hint of lemon in the finish and slight bitterness in the aftertatse. It soon becomes rather bland and the feel is soft. It's not bad, is quite drinkable, and better than many but also far from very good. It actually seems somewhat lacking in crispness and comes off a tad heavy for the taste. There are many macros that I greatly prefer to this."
"This stuff is not so good. Even Pittsburgh Macro drinkers tend to acknowledge this isn't great stuff."
"Light toasted grain backbone with a hint of vegetables. Flavorless and boring overall. A weird sugary-cream taste takes over the palate. Best served as cold as possible and even then, it's a stretch."
"This beer continues to be a staple of my hometown. I have found myself low on cash of late, and I figured this is a good time to go back to my roots. Pours a true golden tone with a highly carbonated thin white head. Everything about this beer says it's classic, you have to love the old school label. The aroma is very faint with some sweet corn notes hidden in there. The taste reminds me of the Wilkinsburg-Penn Joint water used to brew this beer. The sweetness of corn and rice adjuncts is the backbone with some mild hop bitterness here to form one great summertime lawnmower beer. Not an all grain beer but much better than the adjunct ridden garbage Anhueser Busch throws at us. I will definitely ""drink locally and think globally"" in this situation. A light to medium body that is true to it's American lager profile. I will always keep a place in my heart for this historic beer of the city I was born in."
"Pale lager from Steeler Country, had this many times in the past sampled a single for old times sake. Corny light scent, light gold pour minimal white head, crisp yet watery on the palate, typical swill taste. Blue collar beer for sure, used to be able to get this at one of my college hang outs for 50 cents a can."
"Actually turned out to be better than I expected.. a step above its mass produced peers. Nothing special or worth noting, but it has a clean taste with some actual hop presence. Very drinkable IMO with little skunky smell or aftertaste."
"The aroma was a faint malt smell. The taste was Big brewery lager not much in the flavor category. I would of probably indulged in many of these if I would have grown up around the PA area. Not much feel and overall that is what you expect for a 1.29 for a pint."
"It pours a transparent yellow with a decent looking foamy white head and some visible rising carbonation. It sports the classic macro-malt nose with a citrusy hop presence, bonus. Its everything you'd expect from a crisp, clean American lager, nothing out of the ordinary here. A great choice if you have to pick a beer to drink all day. Good balance, great drinkability."
"D: Quite honestly, I can drink these while tailgating all day. It is a beer that I don't have to think about."
"M/D: Good level or carbonation, overall a less than average beer, and certainly one that I will not reach for often and not one that I would probably buy if I saw it at the beer store."
"D. Like most beers in this style (and water), very drinkable. Good to wash down a big meal, but I'd rather not drink much of this."
"D: Hits the spot and is very refreshing, does do the job a macro sets out to do. Better than the macro styles we have down here."
"If created a ""premium"" version of the domestic macro non-craft beers is what they're after, then they've achieved it."
"Drinkability is pretty good with this stuff. What it lacks in appearance and smell does a pretty good job in the aftertaste and feel in the mouth. It's a good cheap Pennsylvania lager and goes well with fish."
"Pours a very weak straw/yellow color, although there was a little head. Very little scent, beyond a little sweet, sugary matliness. Low taste, too, although there was a little bit of malt to it. It does go down very smooth. Better than its IC Light coutnerpart, it would make for a quick refreshing beer to quench your thirst, but not to satisfy the inner beer geek."
"Drinkability: So-so. Much to my surprise, I found I.C Light to be, okay, maybe not better, but more tolerable."
"Overall a smooth American macro lager which isn't big on taste but not as watery or thin as most of its counterparts. Likely will not purchase again anytime soon."
"I have never heard so many requests for a beer until we got Iron City into my store. I just had to try it. I was somewhat impressed fo how dirt cheap this beer is. Pours a yellowish gold with a sickly head. The malt taste was speaking to me but it was just a whisper. I could drink it all day if that was the only think available otherwise I would find something dark and flavorful."
"D - This isn't the best lager but certainly ins't the worst."
"12 oz bottle poured into plastic cup at spring training home of Pittsburgh Pirates in Bradenton. Pours gold with minimal head. Grassy aroma. Taste average, pretty much just tasted sprizzly if that makes any sense. Refreshing enough for roasting in the Florida sun at the ballpark but will stick with Budweiser for this sort of scene going forward."
"We actually get this beer in Florida, go figure. Pours a pale hazy yellow with no head but a ring around the entire drink, very average looking. Smell is bready and yeasty with some malt in the nose as well. Taste is pretty bland a bit malty but over all very carbonated like club soda, you can really hammer these down since they dont really have anytype of taste to them, overall I enjoy somthing a bit my dynamic in my book."
"Drinkability: below average, but not awful. Like most macro lagers, you can down a lot of these in one sitting. But you don't really want to. And I know from prior encounters that this beer gives the worst hangover of any macro lager I've ever had, with the exception of sub-prime beers like Carling Black Label."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a nice white head. Aromas of a small sweet malt. In the taste, small malt presence, yet very watery. A smooth mouthfeel and a dry, pilsner like aftertaste. Not big at all, yet very non offensive. Good for summer, but nothing more than OK."
"Look - this is an alright beer but you have to understand Pittsburgh. It is the only city w/ an entrance (ride through the Liberty tubes before you enter the city and you'll know what I mean), but it is not pretty. Sure, it looks great w/ the rivers and bridges on a poster, but real Pittsburgh is cold, dirty and grimy. And it is a steel town. You work in a mill all day and you want a beer that just goes down smooth, fast and is cheap (I have stillmill workers in my family). Or when you want about 12 beers to tailgate for a Stillers game. In that regard, I'll always have a spot for this beer and will tell everyone to give it one try."
"Drinkability: Good regional brew. Fits where it comes from. I enjoy this type of beer to keep it all in perspective."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color with a small fizzy white head that quickly dissipates into a thin lace. The smell is metallic with some grainy malt. The taste is your typical macro lager with malt and very minimal hops. Overall, I am not a huge fan of this beer."
"Drinkability: Well I had to travel for about 35 minutes to pick this particular drink up w/ a variety of other drinks I also tried. This one I enjoy the least amount, I will not be picking up another bottle of this. There are other Micro Lagers that have better taste, and many more ""generic' beers that taste the same as this. I wanted to like it, I really did because I enjoy lagers so much...but this one just did nothing for me"
"I will not buy this beer, even though it is a ""Burg thing"""
"Arrived with the expected clear, pale, golden yellow color but disappointingly devoid of any head. Smells nebulously grainy and virtually devoid of malts and all but a slight note of hops. Not much of a nose at all, actually. Taste is merely OK in the way that I expect American macros to be. Grain (particularly corn) takes center stage with again just a hint of hops. Mouthfeel is crisp and semi-dry, helping this one go down more easily than it deserves. I will say this--it's a fitting pairing with a Primanti Brothers fried bologna and cheese sandwich."
""
"This is one of those beers that after all these years I'd never tried. I even went to college in Pittsburgh but somehow the Stroh's 30-pack was more appealing. Picked up a case of this a few months ago and was surprised at the price - about $18. Poured ok, decent golden color, not much foam though. It was the taste that really got me. At first it was like any other macro, but then an odd, sweet aftertaste (almost sour - is that corn?) kicks in, which completely turned me off to it. It's not undrinkable (I actually got through the case, eventually) but it's not something I would purchase again."
"D: Not horribly undrinkable, this beer's odd combo of flavor, finish and carbonation still leave much to be desired. For the price, one could easily find beers that are prettier, tastier, and more drinkable."
"Well this beer is what it is; a mass-produced chugging beer. Can't say I really can recommend it though."
"A decent macro lager. Typical adjunct filled lager. Decent appearance and adjunct smell. Taste is typical macro lager crap. Mouthfeel is fairly crisp but dry. THis beer is easy to drink, but so are all macro lagers if you can drink them cold and not taste the adjunct crap going on. Not a beer I'd turn down, but not a beer I'd order for myself. Try it if it comes by you cheap, otherwise don't waste your time."
"Didn't expect much from this one. Pretty much your standard American Macro Lager. There really is no difference between this one an others of the same style. It's all personal preference."
"I won't be buying this beer anytime soon, but I would try a < Iron City IPA >, if they made one."
"Beyond the surprisingly crisp hoppiness, Iron City is a fairly run-of-the-mill Macro Lager. Clean and light, refreshing and hydrating at best. Nothing objectionable, nothing tasty. I would definitely take one if offered, but don't think I'll be needing to buy another from the store."
"Not good at all. Best thing about this beer is the aluminum bottle."
"Opinion: This beer really isn't too bad when you put it beside so many others in this category. There is a malt flavor here...and yes I said flavor. Of course I like my beer with a bit more flavor, but this beer still isn't too bad, and I would drink it again if I had it to pick over any of the Budmilloors."
"Inoffensive when cold this beeer is definately no great shakes when it warms up!"
"This sample is from a 12 ounce aluminum bottle. The beer pours a clear golden yellow color with a small white head which goes away pretty fast. It smells like grain, adjuncts and a little bit of hops. It tastes like most macro lagers, but Iron City does have a little bit of an overall sweeter taste, and the taste is non-offensive. Mouthfeel is light and a bit watery. Drinkability is OK, it is easy to drink. For the most part it's a typical macro lager, but it's not bad. IMO, it does taste a little better when watching the Pirates at PNC Park on a hot day."
"This beer poured a light yellow and had a medium head. The smell had a faint hop aroma and a bit of malt too. The taste was light with a light/medium body. There is a little bit of hop flavor present here, but not a whole lot. The taste isn't too bad... there's just not a whole lot of it. The mouthfeel is light with a medium carbonation. This isn't a real heavy beer, but it doesn't have a bad taste. I consider to be pretty drinkable, and I enjoyed it (in true Pittsburgher fashion) with a Primanti Brothers sandwich! Definately worth a try... and a must when visiting the great city of Pittsburgh!"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a clear straw color, forming a 1/2 inch fluffy white head, leaving medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is very light hops, giving it a slight citrus smell. The taste is nothing great, but a little better than Bud or Miller. Not much here. A little grain and a little hop flavor. The mouthfeel is light and smooth. I could see how light drinkers would enjoy this, but this really just doesnt do anything for me."
"Mouthfeel was highly carbonated and medium/thin bodied. Fizzy action when held in the mouth."
"Notes: No thanks. PBR takes this behind the shed and kicks its ass."
"I like this beer a lot. It tastes good with food, and I find it to be very refreshing. I'm worried about the brewery and hope that the bankrupcy judge doesn't pull the plug on them."
"Good luck to all that work there."
"I kinda enjoy IC. As far as macrolagers go it's pretty good. Beats BMC, anyways. Pick one up, Y'ins might like it."
"Overall I don't get any off-flavors or 'cheap' flavors to it...maybe a little heavy on the adjunct sweetness but it's OK...I'd order a pitcher if I was in Pittsburgh..as it warms it does get a little harsher tasting.."
"A few signs of life in the taste but mouthfeel is weak and watery. I guess I could mow with it if I had to..."
"This is a better beer than I expected. The color is light yellow and there is ample carbonation. The smell is grainy. But the taste is more than is expected of the style. The beer does not have that grainy harshness that is typical of the style. The mouthfeel is smooth and inviting. This is a session beer is I have ever seen one. This beer is better than any macro I have had. Top of the heap in that style. Thnks to wcudwight for the bottle. This was my first aluminum bottle."
"Ahhh, you know you're in Pittsburgh when you have a bottle of Iron City in your hand. Although I can't say that I enjoy Iron City--basically just a super fizzy bland lager--I would encourage anyone that visits the 'Burgh to have one. This is truly a Steel Town staple."
"Iron city is a clear light golden color with a small white head. The head did not last long and left no lacing. The aroma is sweet and sort of grainy. Its taste is also on the sweet side, mainly grainy, and boring. It is light bodied and fairly thirst quenching if you can tollerate the off-taste."
"Best macro lager I've had yet."
"Overall an overly sweet macro. Not recommended."
"Poured a clear , pale goldenrod, with pretty much no head and a bunch of fat carbonation rising for a minute or so. Smell is a thin mix of light barley/straw , and a tinge of adjunt aroma. Taste is also kind of thin , some light straw maltiness , very light spicy hop. Mouthfeel is watery. It is a drinkable brew , just nothing to write home about."
"Iron City Beer pours a typical macro yellow with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. It doesn't smell particularly good, mild vegetable aromas are present. Hmm, not quite what I expected taste wise, some diacetyl and some vegetable flavor. Not particularly good, not particularly bad for the style."
"12 oz. glass bottle, not their fancy aluminum bottle. :-) The bottle just had a simple red Iron City logo on the front and the Govt. warning on the back. The bottle cap had a nice old picture of what the brewery looked like in 1861. The bottom of the six pack box had an old type of picture of a man talking to his friends on how Pittsburgh Brewing Co. recycles. I wanted to try this beer and I actually found a place that was selling it really cheap. It was only $4 for a six pack. I don't have much to lose if it only costs $4/six pack. When poured into a Pilsener glass, the beer was a pale straw yellow color with actually a nice 1 finger head of white foam. I didn't think this would have much foam, let alone a nice white 1 finger. It receded away very nicly leaving behind plenty of white lace. I felt that the aroma was non-offensive by having an aroma of swwet grains and maybe a pinch of sweet malt in the background. I thought the taste was complex, but not the complex taste you would look for in a beer. The taste was complex in grains like corn and rice and ended with a slight taste of sweet malt. The mouthfeel was very light and with an aftertaste of sweet grains. Really nothing special except for it was a nice decent cheap beer that would be good after working outside in hot weather or maybe watching some Pittsburgh sports."
"For years, Iron City was the stock beer at Pittsburgh Pirate baseball games-- and through that advertising and promotion, it probably gained its foothold in the city. Thank God that the new stadium now offers Penn Brewery stock, instead."
"This poured like almost every macro on the planet. Yellow with some uninspired head leaving some lacing on the glass. Smell is sickly sweet, and has some rotten cabbage notes to it. This brew doesn't have much of a flavor to it. Very watery and no aftertaste. I suppose that isn't really a bad thing if your sole aim is intoxication. It's unoffensive going down and pretty easy to drink, but lacks character and flavor, which makes this one very disappointing."
"Pours a straw gold with a white head. Not to much smell going on, similar to your run of the mill macro. Taste is similar, watered down with no huge flavors. Just an average offering, the mouthfeel is ok, decent carbonation. It is a balanced beer but lacks flavor. You could drink these all day if you are looking for the average beer and want a taste of Pittsburgh. Compared to the macros it isn't the best, but also not the worst."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is watery thin. The flavor is one dimensional. There is not enough distinction between maltyness or hops. The beer is drinkable enough while it is cold. I think this would be dam near undrinkable with any degree of warmth on it. This beer should be served blazing cold and drank fast."
"I think this is a decent lager and would make an excellent session beer. This oneÂ’s smooth and crisp and indicative of the style. Too bad most mass-produced American lagers aren't like this one, definitely worth the purchase."
"I had to try it at least once. Now I have."
"Pours pale gold with slight haze. Fizzy one-finger head shows very poor retention and absolutely no lacing. Clean nose, very mild adjunct scent and slightest hint of hops; ester aroma as it warms. Taste is simple and unpleasent: adjunct and apple ester sweet. Aftertaste is almost dry with a estery sweet slickness that seems innappropriate to the style. More like a ""light malt liquor""- this has very few redeeming qualities. Low carbonation in a light body deoes not help mouthfeel or drinkability and the only character present in the finish are off-flavors. If you want to get cheap drunk, buy malt liquor, if you want cheap session beer, get light lager, this falls somewhere inbetween and the overall presentation makes no sense."
"Being from the 'Burgh, I grabbed a case for old times sake just for the Super Bowl. I don't drink macros much anymore unless in a pinch, so this was my first in about 6 months. We used to drink this swill with a shot of grain alcohol thrown in the bottle in college. How'd we do that?? Anyway, light golden color, lotsa carbonation rising. Grainy, corny, ricey nose and a hint of lemony light hops. After a couple, I found myself kinda liking it as it brought back ""Steel Curtain"" memories from 1979. Then, it brought back another memory the following morning...now I remember why I don't drink this shit anymore....but it served its purpose...in its day."
"Clear light gold colour. The white head poured with lots of large, fizzy bubbles, but these disappeared almost as fast as they appeared. Crisp malt nose, faint spicy hops. Mild vegetal aroma as well. Same characters in the flavour, along with very mild bitterness and a hint of cider. Finishes sweet and off-dry, some acidity as well. High carbonation and light body. It didn't quite work for me."
"Some folks at the party were drinking it and enjoying the fact that it was a Pittsburgh brew -"
"Drinkability is low. I just wasnÂ’t Impressed with this brew. I've had it before but that was with a garbage plate and I remember being better at that time...anyhow I will not endorse this as a good brew."
"D - Not good. I will never have this again. More flavor here than a typical macro, but more isn't always a good thing. I could session it, but I'd take something cheaper and more readily available over it (Natty Boh, anyone?). It would go with food as a typical macro. This is one of the least drinkable macros I can recall having."
"To me, this is just like any other macro but with a better appearance, and a lot better taste. I can see myself buying again as a session brew."
"Pours golden. Not much head retention,or lace.Smell was light but sweet. Mouthfeel was light and carbonated. This beer has a bit of a sour edge to it. Sour,not bitter. It's not awful. I would put it in the same catagory as Pabst, Schmidts,and the like."
"Reviewed this during the Pittsburgh/Denver AFC Championship game. We had a party here and provided Rolling Rock, IC, IC Light, and Penn Pilsner. I drank all of the Iron City beer. Not reviewed properly, but this was definitely a tasty beer. It is much better than Miller Lite or anything similar to this. Not my typical beer to drink a daily basis, but during a sporting event, does very well."
"This is coming from a guy that live in Kentucky.. im not saying this because it is a local fav. im saying this b/c its the truth.. This beer is not a bad beer at all.. It was one of the first beers to come in a aluminium bottle.. I tried the beer at a restraunt that served pizza.. and it went well with a good meat me pizza... I cant really describe the color of it cuz it was still in the bottle.. but the smell and taste in my opinion was way better than any bud. coors.. or miller brands.. which i know to a lot of ppl doesnt mean shit.. but to some ppl that means a lot.. i would recommend trying one.."
"D. Slightly better than most macros----and Alluminum bottles FTW!!!"
"Iron City Beer pours nicely and generated an ENORMOUS amount of HEAD. A surprisingly pleasant pale amber color appeared as the head slowly gave way to liquid. The surface tension of the head was stout and held the pull tab for a period of time. There was an overabundance of carbonation present....my nose felt as if it was getting rained on as I brought the glass up for a drink. This is what really made Terry Bradshaw go bald."
"12 ounce aluminum can/bottle. Iron City beer pours out a clear, golden color with a small head that quickly fades to nothing. Lots of visible carbonation. The aroma is a sharp, sour, cooked vegetable aroma that is not at all pleasant. Starts off with a grain flavor that isn't bad, but a nasty cooked vegetable flavor comes in at the middle. This is one of those drink it fast before you taste it beers. I saw this beer on a shelf of singles at the store and bought it because the bottle looked unique, which is a pretty stupid reason. I guess I got what I deserved."
"Sinkability Â– This beer sucks."
"Overall, I wouldn't buy it, which I don't, chugging it merrily when my buddy brings it from Pittsburg."
"Aluminium bottle: Poured a pale yellow lager with a medium white bubbly head with good retention. Aroma of corn is clearly noticeable and very little else seems to pop out. Taste is refreshing with some malt presence and crisper hops then expected. Just above your average pale lager."
"Anyways, I don't feel the least bit guilty throwing this in the ""macro"" category. After all, it smells and tastes like a macro. Tons of carbonation..this stuff is the definition of a lawnmower beer. Light mouthfeel, crisp finish.. final verdict = a macro in disguise. You can save your time and skip this one."
"i buy this beer in mcallen tx area and i was fascinated about his design, very collectable; A real beer from the area of the american birthplace of beer the northeast of usa, i think so much about his bottle of aluminum, what keeps his flavor, not so rich but had drinkability, and his flavor is much better with a lemmon touch"
"The beer pours from the 355ml aluminum bottle (can), a clear gold with a smallish bright white head that is semi-creamy in texture, with the left over lace a fine film to conceal the glass. Nose is the prototypical malt lager with a fresh crisp sweetness, start is lightly sweet and nicely malted, top is light in feel. Finish is strongly acidic, the hops light but pleasant and the aftertaste dry and lingering, a drinkable lager as lagers go."
"D: Unoffensive. I'm sure Frat boys pound them!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" of white head above the clear straw brew. Head lasts reasonably well for the style, settling to about 1/8"" while I was off answering the phone and calming my daughter for 5 minutes. Lacing is spotty but still not horrible for the style. Aroma is sweet adjucty heaven, or hell, depending on your viewpoint, I guess. Taste is starts with slight adjunct sweet as indicated by the nose, a light citrus hops bite int he middle, and closes plainly. Mouthfeel is really watery, and the flavors don't seem to meld all that well, although drinkability on this one, assuming you are down with the flavor, is probably quite high."
"Very pale, very clear, very bland. For alot of bubbles fizzing up, their is no head. None. Just a light ring of bubbles around the outside. The best looking thing about this beer is, well, the aluminum bottle. Scent is clean, with a bit of cooked vegetables and grass. Not much else. Tase is very astringent, light. Bit of a lemon hop taste, and very faint malts. Mouthfeel is thin and astringent. Pretty much, substandard swill. But, it cost 75 cents a bottle."
"Gold on colour with medium carbonation and a fast head. Some malty aromas to this one, along with a touch of corn. Fairly malty in flavor as well, with some faint notes of caramel and earthy hops. ItÂ’s basically a half-step up from your typical North American macro, but nothing worth celebrating. Cool aluminum bottle though."
"Eh. Better than a macro offering, or just more of the same?"
"Medium bodied, but nicely carbonated and tingly on the tongue. This one is more of a one trick poney, that is decidedly sweet and grainy in the malt areas.o tries to make its way through towards the swallow. Bitterness comes along at the end, leaving the tongue slightly dry. The slick and creamy mouthfeel leaves it slightly better than average."
"This is not a terrible beer as I have been told by others... Actually, a rather drinkable cheap lager. Poured out to a medium golden color with a decent head. No lace in the glass. Odors of corn, malt and a sweet character was noted. Flavor was your typical lager, not amazing, but not terrible either. This beer was nothing special, flavors of corn and some malt and hops. Finished crisp and clean. Not an offensive beer, but not an amazing one either. Worth a try, and recommended for lager fans."
"Drinkability- Lines right up there with most of the macro brews. Not horrible, but may take this over BM or C."
"Slightly malty nose, slightly malty taste. Pretty much un-memorable without being offensive. Yawn."
"The mouthfeel is thin and highly carbonated. I drank one and did not want another, that is why I rated the drinkability on the low side. Not horrible, but not for me."
"Good stuff to wash your teeth with watching a live sports event but you'd have to be a real tar to actually buy it to enjoy at a pub or at home."
"I couldn't believe how clear this stuff poured...The most hollow gold I ever saw! Head just up and left quickly. Very mild scented also. The above average taste of malt/grain with a slight hop finish really surprised me after seeing how it looked. The ""AlumaBottle"" is cool too. Not great but certainly not bad at all."
"Way too sweet-dextrose? Makes plain lager drinkable though. Artificial candy aroma. Appropriately carbonated.Thin mouthfeel. Not worth finishing bottle or quality ingrediants to cook with - rare drain pourout.Like the aluminum bottle, will bounce! Inexpensive."
"Had to try this due to the novel silver bottle that looks like something out of a sci-fi film. Unfortunately, the bottle design is where the interesting characteristics of this beer end. It pours a clear yellow straw color with a fizzy white head that quickly fades into a thin lace. The nose has some sweetness but there is also a noticeable aroma of stale grains and a bit of cooked corn. The taste begins with a light sweetness but the flavors are quite thin. A touch of hops are detectable towards the end, but again the flavors are all very faint. A step up from the macros I suppose, but not by much."
"Drinkability: For a macro lager, it has no bad aftertaste. It is slightly off balance, but overall It is decent. It makes an alright beer for something like washing down pizza or quenching thirst. Something to drink when you don't have to think about the beer."
"My first and last Iron City Beer."
"Mouthfeel was quite thin and watery, somewhat bland. Drinkability is OK, overall, for a macro. Actually, since I had chili for dinner, I can see how it would go somewhat well with something spicy."
"Pours a translucent golden hue that has the slightest flourish of a bubbly white head that dissipates immediately. A touch of carbonation continues to rise from the bottom for a while. An almost candyish sweet aroma is immediately noticeable, dominateed by adjunct grain. Very low on flavor, more adjunct malt with a touch of honey sweetness, developing into an almost mediciney astringency towards the finish. Body is thin, even for a macro lager. I guess you could drink a lot of the stuff if you wanted to. Not terrible or anything, just not good."
"OK, back to Woody's Soapbox. So it wasn't any great shakes, so what? Does it invoke memories of sitting with my departed Pops as a kid, watching Bucs and Stillers games? Hell, yeah! Will it remain my lawnmower beer of choice until, Heaven forbid, PGH BC closes its doors or is bought out? Hell, yeah! Will I continue to bring cases, sixes, 40's, et al to tailgates? Hell, yeah!"
"A small, fast, fizzy, level, white head dies to a film quickly. The beer is ultra clear, pale gold with impatient carbonation. Smell is sweet/tart... like apple juice, with some nuts and sugar. The beer starts fruity and a little bitter, then turns sweet, with more apple juice and a fairly solid body. The finish gives major nuts and nicely fresh bitterness. It gets a little chemically at temperature, but overall it's not bad. Some pleasant flavors in there."
":1:"
"(""thanks"" to Chaz!)"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry pale malt scent along with a lager yeast aroma. I guess there are adjuncts present, but it seems maltier than most macros. The taste is good. It has a smooth, crisp pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and clean. It has good flavor for a macro lager. It's not at all watery. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good lager. Everyone always jokes about this beer, but I like it. It's a good drinker."
"Adjunct, adjunct, adjunct. I had this once and I won't buy it no more. I got caught by the name and I thought that it was a local micro. Yes, it was a local brewery, but the product is very typical of macros. Have a Bud or this one and you won't see much difference. It is just another yellow fizzy and corny beer. That's all about it."
"Presentation: Packaged in an aluminum bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"The mouthfeel provided a nice bubbly carbonation as it passed the tongue, but besides that, I found this beer average."
"Overall Impression: Easy drinking; uninspiring. I see this as a beer for the masses. IÂ’d choose one over any BMC product, and could see some enjoying a session of this, but overall, itÂ’s a fairly bland lager."
"thanks to fellow ba mtanji for this sample. poured a light amber color typical of this style of beer. not much smell to speak of. taste is not much of anything. mouth feel is as of water. Drinkablility is that if you want to get drunk without tasting what you drink, this is your beer."
"It's like a beer, only instead of hops they used garbage, instead of malt they used garbage, and instead of water, they used garbage water. The best thing I can say is that the IC Light is way better than the regular, probably because the nasty taste is more watered down."
"Overall: If I'm going to drink a crappy beer I'll stick to budweiser."
"12 oz. aluminum bottle, served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours a clear orange/yellow with a 1 finger head that dissolves to almost nothing and leaves very few spots of lace. Smell is very crisp with cooked veggies and a hint of grassy hops behind it. Taste is about the same - nothing special. It is very simple but probably easy to drink a whole bunch."
"Pale gold in hue, clear, no animation, the liquid looks limp. The head was white in color but surprisingly frothy even though it was only a half finger in height at its highest point. Head retention was fair; it faded quickly to a soapy Â“cap,Â” more naked spots then foam. There was no subsequent lacing. The appearance is average. My first sniff said, Â“corn.Â” It is cold enough that I smell little else. The aroma is, obviously simplistic but not offensive at its present state. Still it is hardly inviting. Once warmer it smells like husk and dog food. That isnÂ’t good! I guess that is why they make the bottle so snazzy; if you drink it straight from the aluminum chamber you canÂ’t smell it! And as such you canÂ’t taste it! That might be the goal of most beer drinkers, not me though. Well, the palate is not awful. It is sweet and corny like a Busch; I canÂ’t see much of a difference actually. Hop bitterness is minimal. Hop flavor is none. Maltiness? YouÂ’re joking right? I canÂ’t taste any. It is tolerable when cold. However, as it warms it turns sloppy, like wet grain, husk, and stale water with a sweet, empty finish. IÂ’ve heard horror stories about this beer from swill drinkers but I didnÂ’t find it to be *that* bad. Could I set down and drink a six-pack? I wouldnÂ’t want too, and since I only have one bottle I donÂ’t have too. Medium in body, modest carbonation, the mouthfeel is very solid and it saves this beer from being too watery or too sweet. There is an odd lemony aftertaste. On the whole, this beer (for an Adjunct Lager) is okay. Should Pittsburgh be proud of this beer? No. Ashamed? Well, itÂ’s not much cup of beer. I think you need some nostalgia to like it. I purchased my bottle in Kansas City, KS for around a $1.50. This was a onetime thing for me."
"Metal bottle version: Pours crystal clear gold with a thin white head. Tiny bubbles and almost no lacing. The aroma is pretty sweet but nondistinct. Light-bodied and actually has a tiny bit of malt and corn flavor. At least there is nothing offensive going on. The finish is short and almost flavorless, aside from a bit of grain and malt. Of the macro Lager type beers, this is one of the better."
"I didnt have high expectations for this beer so I wasnt to disapointed when I tryed it. The name says it all, hints of metal. Couldn't help but think it was chewing up my belly. There was a high alcohol content if thats what your going for then thats the beers high point. Cheap bad beer, this is par for the coarse."
"d - well, hmmm. it goes down ok, but again just a weird, off flavor, maybe it's the metal bottle"
"Appearance was a clear lemon yellow with a small head which left a slight foam ring. Malt smell and lemon sourness. Taste was sour with a hay or straw quality and a bit of doughiness. Mouthfeel was light, not much else to say. Not a bad beer to kick around on a summer afternoon if there was nothing else around."
"Had this at a kegger. It's just awful, awful, awful. Just a bubbly, urine-colored mess through a clear plastic cup. Smells like it tastes: It feels like a high-acid, grain punch. No thicker than water in the mouth. I know this is the stuff that goes around at these kinds of parties, but it's worse than Natty, Beast, American, even Olde English for crying out loud. I would personally be hard pressed to find a worse beer."
"Cool 12 oz aluminum bottle that pours a clear straw golden with a decent fizzy white head that doesn't last very long, does leaves some lacing, light grainy and flowery aromas (no skunk). Sweet bready, grassy and grainy flavors, light bodied with a thin and watery mouthfeel, finishes with some sweetness, alright for what it is."
"($19.99 / case - aluminum bottles)"
"I finished it. almost. This wasn't my first Iron City. I had one at Primanti Bros. on a road trip. Almost ruined the sandwich. This reminds me very much of the Hudhepohl we used to drink in college. Nasty stuff. What was I thinking? Oh yeah, the aluminum bottle."
"Had to try the aluminum bottle. Yellow-amber color and weak head. Aroma is very much like white grape juice. Flavor is sweet corn adjunct and little malt or hops to speak of. Finishes dry and astringent. A waste of time and money. I am going to save the aluminum bottle--it can be recapped. I will put one of my homebrewed IPA's in it to get a real read on what it does to GOOD beer."
"12 oz Â‘aluminumÂ’ bottle obtained from JohnÂ’s Grocery (Iowa City) in January 2005 and consumed that same evening. Pours a half-finger white head that very quickly settled to a ring around the glass. Crystal clear light honey color with a few streams of bubbles rising to the top. Smells mildly sweet (honey-like) with faint hop (Saaz? or perhaps that's just metal from the 'bottle) and maybe a bit of orange. Tastes weakly malt sweet with hop bitter--a bit to strong for the limited sweetness. A metalic flavor, I'm hoping is from the hops, is present from start to finish. Fruity flavors consist of cantelope (which I think is correctly called muskmelon) and a bit of peach. A sour carbonation fizz persists on my tongue after the swallow. Thin mouthfeel. This beer is much better than I expected (I was expecting macro-swill), but the fruit flavors are a bit stronger than I expect in a lager. Enjoyable, went down quick, on to the next beer for the evening."
"The can had a cool retro look... made me wonder if it was good marketing, or just a holdover from years ago. The beer poured a golden color, deeper than those mass-produced beers, with a decent creamy white head. The smell was that typical American lager smell that I just can't seem to elaborate on. As for the taste, it was surprisingly somewhat tasty... mildly sweet malt with a touch of hops, mild hop flavor but no bitterness. The mouthfeel was nice, and there was none of that metallic flavor that always seems present in canned beers (this one was apparently relatively fresh). It was a much more enjoyable and drinkable beer than I expected. Not a bad choice if you find yourself at a Steelers game!"
"This is not a bad regional and I would choose it over a BMC product anytime. It reminds me of Grain Belt or a Leines."
"I admit it, I bought this because I wanted to try the new alluminum bottle. Poured a medium straw color with a small head that didn't hang around and almost non existant lace. Smells of sweet malt with corn and rice very evedent - almost buttered popcorn like. Taste is that of sweet malt, again with corn and rice very evident. Very watery. Even for an adjuct macro this one needs help. The only thing this one has going for it is the bottle. The only way I would ever drink this again is if someone gave one to me."
"Well, being from Western PA, I had to try Iron City in its new aluminum bottle. Poured a golden color with a white head that fled the scene quickly. The smell was somewhat sweet, but not all that great. The taste was sweet, yet a touch bitter, maybe even sour. The mouthfeel was thin, but wasnt too horrible either. I could not picture myself drinking this ever again, I have been caught drinking worse, much worse."
"I got this beer because of the cool looking aluminum bottle when I was at a hole in the wall middle eastern eatery. It really wasn't worth trying at all. Not much flavor except for adjuncts and they seemed to really get in the way of everything. It wasn't even thirst quenching because it was so adjunct heavy. Not smooth in the least and I didn't drink it fast which meant that it warmed, and that was not a good thing. Maybe get it for the bottle because it was kinda a cool thing, but don't think about getting this for any other reason."
"Pours with a white head that fades quickly, leaving no lace. Light carbonation. Clear amber color, light bodied. Nose is a faint apple. Starts malty, hops are in the background, finishes with hints of apple/lemon. 95Â¢ for a 12 oz bottle from Vintage Cellar Blacksburg, VA."
"D: Latrobe. The water seems to change the beer. The aforementioned Rolling Rock changed when it went away from Latrobe. IC changed to be a low end, but acceptable lager. It's beaten BMC and I'd say it might be a little lower than PBR, but still, not bad at all."
"Pours a pale gold with a thick, fluffy bone white head. Grainy nose, with no hops noticable. Sweet grain flavor with a mild bitter finish. Sweet throughout. Very light mouthfeel. Sweet, long finish. A standard american lager. Not much character. Drinkable, but nothing special. Pretty boring."
"Could aluminum bottles be the wave of the future?"
"I bought this bottle of Iron City Beer because of nostalgia. Even though I don't believe I've ever had it before, I remember hearing about it and seeing it on the shelves during my youth in Ohio. Well, my curiosity was satisfied. What is it that they say about curiosity and the cat?"
"Paid: $3.99 for a 6pk"
"A clear, yellow-gold body reveals average-sized bubbles rising quickly beneath a short but frothy head of bright white foam. The retention is as might be expected and it drops readily to a wide collar and whispy surface covering. The nose offers some sweet, lightly grainy malt with a light hint of floral hops mixed in. The body is medium; and it's lightly crisp in the mouth. Sweet, lightly grainy malt dominates the flavor, although the same hint of hops found in the nose also tries to make its way through towards the swallow. Bitterness is kept at a minimum, but there's just enough there to balance it; and it finishes drying with a note of malt who's sweetness fades although its graininess lingers. Average."
"All in all, its nothing spectacular, but its welcome on this day."
"Pale golden hue, tiny strings of carbonation; your macro-typical nose offerings in the way of husky grain and the much desired cooked veggies. Up front, rather weak bodied, some light hop detection, corn and husky flavorings. Watery and metallic in the body, worsens as it warms; don't hurt yourself searching for this one."
"i figured since i was in pittsburgh (well, west virginia really), i'd drink what the locals drank. i've had thuse brew before and been underwhelmed and was once again, though less so than before. pours a light golden color with virtually no head. typical macro smells and tastes here: low on hop, malt and grain characteristics, high on corn and watery ones. not as bad as a macro but not much better. would i get it again? sure, because unless your in the city of pittsburgh, i've found that it's hard to come across anything else but the macros and maybe a heineken here and there in that area of the country."
"All in all, not a bad beer at all."
"This is simply cheap beer that is drinkable. That is all. The beer is pretty much water and filler-alot of that corn flavor thing going on. If I was a broke factory worker in need of some decent refreshment after a long hard day, I could find some semblance of comfort in an Iron City. A decent mass produced softie that will whet your whistle, and leave your wallet be. That is all."
"This beer poured a pale yellow in color with little aroma. It's typical for a light beer such as bud light, but had a little more color to it. It went down rather smooth much like water. I drank this beer because it was the only option at a church picnic in PA. Probably would not have had it otherwise and probably won't have it again."
"Iron City: this beer, apparently bought on a lark was not as big a disappointment as I had expected. It poured a pale yellow, although it had a lot more color than a Bud. The aroma was fairly weak, and predominately adjuncts. The beer, as is absolutely typical for the style, was perfectly clear. The taste was surprising smooth for an American style macro, on the other hand, the corn taste overwhelmed everything else in the brew. The beer did taste fresh, however, and the aftertaste was not unpleasant. Above average for the style, below average overall."
"Could this be a bad Bud clone? Please sir, no more."
"Forty of Iron City, this was and continues to be a staple of my hometown. I have found myself low on cash as of lately, and I figured what better times to go back to my roots. Pours a true golden tone with a highly carbonated thick white head that could be compared to the billowing smoke clouds that that left the steel mills of Pittsburgh's past. Everything about this beer says it's classic, you have to love the old school label. The aroma is a very faint bitterness with some sweet tones hidden in there. The taste however is the true reason to throw back this beer, it is a crisp American lager not too watered down, definitey packs some flavor. The sweetness of corn and rice adjuncts is the backbone with some mild hop bitterness here to form one great summertime lawnmower beer. Not an all grain beer but much better than the adjunct ridden garbage Anhueser Busch throws at us. I will definitely ""drink local and think globally"" in this situation. A light to medium body that is true to it's American lager profile. I will always keep a place in my heart for this historic beer of the city I was born in."
"Pours a medium gold color topped by a slightly off-white head. This beer maintains a thin layer of foam atop the beer, but not quite as well as IC Light. The fairly light aroma is very grassy with a slight sweet grain note. The taste has a noticeable sweetness followed by a bit of bitterness. There is a slight harshness in the mid-taste. The aftertaste is a lingering sweetness. The mouthfeel is solid, especially for a macro. Carbonation mixes well with the body of the beer, so you actually can tell there is something in your mouth. And it feels good. The drinkability is pretty much average. You can drink a few of these, and you might want to if you're in the right mood. Between this and IC light, the IC light would be in my glass. But what can be better than drinking a cold ""Arn"" on a rainy day while the Pirates are on TV? Obviously, I couldn't think of anything, because that's my afternoon. If you see Iron City, give it a try."
"Too bad, heard Pittsburgh Brewing Company is behind on its payments to the city of Pittsburgh. Was hoping for a better product. Hope it doesn't become another victim of the big 3 -- but it'll have to do a better job of defending itself."
"A very good session beer.....light to medium golden colour with a matching body....aroma is crisp. The taste and mouthfeel is what really got my attention.....Well balanced and clean....Not a great brew, but a very good brew, and for the money, an exellent value. I could drink gallons of this.....and probobly will...."
"In Pittsburgh its cheap, drinkable, and fresh."
"It was pale yellow with no sustainable head. It kind of smelled like corn and grain to me. On tasting, there was only a tiny bit of malt and hops, but mainly grain and a little vegetable. It was quite light in body. I wouldn't say this is a good beer, but I do love that it a regional brew deeply connected with the city."
"Crystal clear straw hue topped by a typically meager head indicative of ample adjunct use.  The relatively clean, but unenticing aroma is comprised of sweet corn, a touch of DMS, and a barely perceptible floral hop nose.  The bland flavor is dominated by corn, but corn sweetness and cooked cabbage thankfully aren't as overbearing as other American lagers.  Husky 6 - row notes are assertive, but aren't astringent & provide the only noteable malt character of this brew.  The hop bitterness is above the norm compared to the mundane American lager, & when coupled with the sharp carbonation, this beer is almost biting in mouthfeel.  Finishes bittersweet from corny sweetness and light hop bitterness.  Iron City is bland and expectedly adjunct - laden, but is perhaps a notch above other domestics."
"Notes: Not very clean at all, better off just sticking with a Bud, Miller or Coors than tangling with this brew. A sub-premium American Lager that is not worth my time."
"This beer poured a verly pale yellow color and formed no head and no lace. An aroma of hops and grain. A flavor of grain and some dough aspects. Finish was extremely light and some bite present. I am not a big fan of this beer, but have had a chance to try it on many occasions. I find it to be no better than the other smaller macrobrews like Rolling Rock. But the cult following of this is amazing. I went to a party in college and all the people who lived there were Iron City drinkers. We were all drinking the usual keg swill and they were walking around with bottles of Iron City. Went upstairs and they had filled the bathtub with ice and filled it with Iron City."
"This beer  focuses on marketing and promotions but should instead change their recipe. First glimpse is of a pale, sickly yellow brew. What little head there is is weak and artificial.  Smell is weak and not fresh, and is reminiscent of cooked corn.  Slight sweet malty overtones with too little hops. Corn and rice adjuncts are almost overpowering and get worse as the brew warms up. Tastes chemical like.  Must almost be drunk at near freezing temperatures to remain palatable."
"Hmmm, seems like fdoosey has a point, as our sample of Iron City wasn't particularly metallic.  Pours with a small white head.  Has a clear bright yellow color.  Smells faintly salty, sour, but not much.  Tastes watery malty, slightly salty.  Sour aftertaste.  Surprisingly medium-light body.  Might be a good lawnmower beer, but not much else."
"Light to medium yellow. Mildly grainy nose. Almost discernible hop bitterness. A slightly sweet underlying flavor makes what would be a typical american lager actually taste like something other than carbonated water."
"I will say this beer sux ass,but one of my good buddies it P-town took me to a Steelers game and I tailgated all day drinkin this stuff,not good but drank at least 16 and I cheeredon the Steelers (even though Iam Lions fan).Better than AB products,a classic in the Iron city."
"VERY metallic to the point of distracting the assessment of what little flavor the lager would have anyway...color clear straw, smells lightly of pine...bars that tend to have this on tap also tend to maintain their tap system very poorly, not adding to the beer's appeal...and Pittsburgh Brewing contract brews Samual Adams...historically, I think Iron City was one of the first canned beers (I think with pull-off tabs?)..."
"There haven't been many beers that I didn't care to finish, however this was one of them. Had this from a 12 oz. long leck bottle. The flavor was astringent and metallic to the point that I felt it was stripping the enamel off my teeth."
