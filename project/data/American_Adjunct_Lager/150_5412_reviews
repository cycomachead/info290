"Taste is slightly sweet and grainy with mild toasted grain and light spice with hint of floral hops and finish is crisp and dry. Overall not the best but mediocre exceeded my expectations to be honest"

"It's not awful, I guess. It's just not really good."

"Overall-You get what you pay for. 14 bucks a case, I was expecting worse. If you're in a pinch this is a lot better than Natural Ice, Old Milwaukee, or any of the other cheap and awful beers. If you can afford better, though, then get better."

"Ahhhh lions head. What can I say. This might be the best basement bargain beer in a bottle. Oh yes, buy the bottle or give it a "" drain poor"". In the bottle it is an outstanding cheap drinker, but they must buy the left over cans from steel city, the taste coming out of a can is of licking the aluminum shavings off the brewery floor. And stay away from the light version too, the regular pilsner is light enough. So if you need a cheap bottle that goes down easy and will please most on a hot day. Drink up my friend... Bonus the mind teasers under the caps can keep a group of local drunks amused for hours of cheap fun!"

"Overall – Nothing fantastic, but for the price and as a session beer it is a good go to on any occasion when drinking is more a background activity."

"I had this one in a bottle before and was unimpressed. Much better from a can. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, a touch of corn is present. Taste is crisp, refreshing, some malts and corn, very easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and overall, at this price point, makes a good session beer on a hot summer day."

"Overall: not terrible (but not the ""Deluxe Pilsner"" the the label trumpets) but I paid $5.89 for a sixer. I expect more beer for my hard earned money. Add $2 and get a really good craft is my suggestion. In it's defense, it wouldn't be bad to pour a couple back on a hot SC summer day. Forget, serve very cold."
""
""
"The taste is crisp and refreshing with bready, cracker like cereal tastes. Very malty, this pilsner is tasty and blends well with the Cajun food I was eating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: For under $15.00 bucks a case this stuff is a steal and an alcoholics dream!"

"O - Supposed to be a pilsner - doesn't really taste like one. It's a great beer for the price - 16 a case, tax included in PA. As a college student, this beer is my go-to for throwing back 10-15 in a night."
"Think light lager, not ""Deluxe Pilsner"" as per the can, and you'll be much less disappointed."

"This is my first beer review ever, so I thought I'd start with a simple beer like Lionshead. I was first introduced to Lionshead my sophomore year at Penn State. Being from PA, I often see this beer at parties. It's cheap and decent tasting (considering it's inexpensiveness and sessioning ability). Most importantly, it's a crowd-pleaser! Each cap has a riddle on it with pictures, and you try to decide what phrase the pictures mean. This beer does not smell good (nor do I think it was even meant to be smelled). What does it smell like? Well, the only good descriptor I can give is that it smells like beer. It smells like a frat house the day after they had a big party and spilled a lot of Natty on the floor. It pours an orangeish-gold, very clear, no head. Its taste is very watery with mild carbonation. It has more beer taste than other session beers like Miller lite, Coors lite and Bud lite, but less than a regular Yuengling. Also, its mouthfeel is very light too. This beer is a good choice IF it's used what it's meant for - buying, serving, and drinking in bulk. One of the better session beers out there. People at your party will think ""Thank god, not another party with only Bud Light... Oooh a puzzle!"""

"Overall, it's you average/typical adjunct lager, on the sweet side. Not bad for what it is, and rated as such. Inoffensive, there are worse ""lawn mower"" beers out there for sure."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with a short lived white head and soda-like carbonation. Aroma is sourdough and hint of hops. Body is light and smooth. Taste is sourdough, some sweet malt and cooked vegetables. Finish is short and sour. I don’t understand why college kids by cases of this crap."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice straw color with little head. Smells slightly of grain, but not much else. Tastes of a regular adjunct lager, but has a fuller taste than most. Carbonation is good and goes down smooth. Overall, an average beer."
""
""
""
""
"Lighter medium body, well carbonated, pretty watery and fast on the palate. This isn't bad for an adjunct, but it's not what I'd consider to be a good beer either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small pils like hop and a small skunkyness. In the taste, A small pils hop and a small sweetness, quite muted across the board. A small hop bite, but mainly smooth with a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a note of dry to clean to no aftertaste. Very muted, eh, nothing to really write home about."

"Overall: Average taste and overall beer, but it's great for the price, and is certainly better than Bud, Miller, or Coors."

"ale yellow with no head to speak of what so ever, really just a clear, over carbonated mess of a look for me. but a trudge on. weak grains, touches of light corn and bready notes abound here, again not that i was expecting a ton of wonderful flavor here, but it could have been more then the wet cardboard that i got. clean and crisp, light feel worked for the style and it went down smooth"
"Easy to drink, but nothing special."
"decide to try something different at the ball game , since the majority of the stand was Malternatives. i thought i give a lions head a try. not trying to make it this review like goldielocks but it wasn't to grainy or corny . the smell was just right. for the price it was just right."
"Was a cheap beer but not too bad of a beer either. Pretty smooth and not too light. By no means is it one of my favorites, just a descent beer to get when I have no money. The smell was alright and it gave off a little bit of an aftertaste. I would prefer it over most light beers but definitely no one I would get often. Also it is much better out of the bottle then can."
"D - Not offensive by any means, just not much here in terms of flavor."
"O: The beer goes down easily but nothing really stands out in the taste that would want me to try another."
"Not quite sure if this can be called a beer or not. Smells of any fine watered down American pilsner. The taste is odd in that it is sweet with a hint of what I would call grapes. It ends with somewhat of a bitter note but just a little. The appearance (along with price) is about all this has going for it. Cannot complain though it is always there on a hot day when I have no money."
"Overall not too exciting for an american beer but went well with dinner."
"Prost!"
"Well worth the money, and for the price, not likely to find much better. Good, affordable drinking beer."
"Pours a light golden color, barely any head to it. Aroma is of light hops and reminiscent of a ""BMC beer"". Taste is much better though than the usual cheap beer. Little but of fruitiness on the palate and nice mouthfeel and finish. Goes down easy. For what it is, not bad at all... a nice cheap beer to throw back at the end of the night. Priced right and plus, there's cool little puzzles on the back. If you're looking for a cheap beer, I recommend this if you can find it."
"This takes me back to college... Not that I enjoyed it there but everyone around me loved this stuff. I guess it's because it was affordable and local to us here in PA. This beer is a traditional lager that pours a golden yellow with a decent head the actually has a little lacing down the glass. This beer is light bodied and not overly flavorful."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a fizzy white head. It smells like all adjunct lagers; corn, musty, and kind of sweet. The flavor is much like the nose as it is sweet with a hint of corn/malts. No real hop presence. It is crisp and refreshing. The mouthfeel is on par for the style maybe just slightly less carbonated. It is very drinkable given it is not that flavorful or complex. As far as the style goes its one of the best I have ever had. For the price its a steal."
"my favorite part about this beer is the design, the 6 pack handle has finger holes like brass knuckles sort of. totally hardcorey looking branding, nice unique half label, looks very nice for a regular bmc-ish beer."
"Well, this seems like a fruity macro lager, it's not horrible, but not really good either. I guess it would be a bit refreshing on a warm day, plus it goes down pretty east, but other than that, this has few redeeming qualities."
"Like many reviewers, I picked up a case of this based on price, in my case (har) at a Bottle King in NJ...I had never heard of it nor seen it in NY or NJ before. Unfortunately, the no-frills packaging was an accurate signal of the contents -- not horrible, but nothing I'd ever repeat. I'd love to find a great unsung American beer but this one doesn't do it...if you are in the PA vicinity best to go with Yuengling or even the better Penn offerings. Lionshead has an unpleasant alcohol-fortified aftertaste and is very thin on the palate. I'd like to say it's a good go-to budget offering but I can't given the many better options out there."
"Beer is medium in body and mildly sweet on the onset. The finish is a little grainy but it's not too bad. Overall it's an easy drinking sessionable pilsner. I sort of enjoyed it. Free beer, right?"
"Lets be honest. For me, it's local (contract brewed, but why should that matter). It's cheap (around $13 a case). And it's just drinkable. It's light and refreshing. No frills here. Just cold and good when a dude is at his thirstiest."
"Lionshead will always be one of my favorite beers. I used to buy a case of bottles of this every Friday for a while from the local Beverage. The taste smooth for sure goes down like water. But it is somewhat filling, i could probly only put down about 12 of these in one night no more than that. But all in all its a good beer im proud to be from PA when I drink this beer. GO STEELERS!"
"This beer isn't terribly filled of flaws, so why is everything they contract brew seem so awful?"
"d - A below average pilsner. Not awful, but nothing too enjoyable about it either. Some basic grain and bread in the smell and taste. Wouldn't seek out again, but better than some macros."
"This is a beer that your gramps and his pals would sit around and drink while swapping tales about the ""big war"". And I mean that as a compliment. Very straight forward ""regular"" pilsner, no muss no fuss."
"pours a light gold and has a very small head. Very easy beer to drink smells and tastes better than most ""big named beers."" Drinks like a light beer and tastes better than Bud and Miller. The price makes it worth it. There are also puzzles under the cap."
"I'm gonna reuse the shit outta that image! No just kidding. This beer is VERY good for it's price. $13 and change for an 18 pack of 16oz cans and it's better than other cheap college kid beers that I'm accustomed to drinking. About $15 for a 24 of 12oz bottles for you glass snobs. It doesn't have that piss water taste like natty (Natural Light for the older folks) and it doesn't have that ""I think I'm gonna puke taste"" like PBR (Pabst Blue Ribbon). Overall a smart purchase if you're looking for an easy to drink beer for social occasions but don't want to spend that much money. Plus you'll also stand out from the Bud Light/ Miller Lite crowd."
"Had from the bottle in a case a friend gave me. Really Vague in taste. Much more flavourful than miller light, but less then a craft pilsner. Barley, and grain malts were pretty much the taste through out, with a hop finish, goes down nice and smooth though, a noce light bodied pilsner for sure."
"Lionshead on draft was a pretty decent experience. I haven't had this beer before but it was clean, refreshing, and it hit the spot after a full dinner and some heavier beers earlier in the night. The beer was definitely a step up above the BMC crowd, and a really nice affordable option to have late in the night when you've already had 5 beers previously."
"D - Very smooth and light overall, so it is very easy to drink, and multiple in a sitting would not be the unreasonable in the least."
"Following the Crack & Glug, I was looking at a finger-and-a-half of rocky, bone-white head with medium retention (it was fading, but not as quickly as its Rheingold brother). Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. Yow, but this was brighter than bright! Nose was pretty standard for the style - a lager sweetness overlain by all of the adjuncts that they could throw into the kettle. Move along folks, nothing new here. Mouthfeel was medium with a fairly pleasant sweetness on the tongue. Frankly, this was MUCH better than what I had in a bottle. I have noted this in a number of previous clinkers, reinforcing my preference for CANned beer. Finish was also pleasant, slightly refreshing, not too bad. Now, would I take up cooler space with this? It would really depend on pricing. If it was as competitively priced as it is in bottles, then ""Yes!", but if it is comparable to other CANned AALs, I would probably let it sit. Damning with faint praise once again, I suppose."
"Overall: A safe, easy alternative to macro lagers."
"Bought as part of a sampler case at beer outlet nearby. I found it to have a stable big head, clean appearance, negligible aroma, thin and not entirely pleasant flavor; sharply effervescent with a sweet metallic aftertaste. Not very refreshing. To be avoided. There are plenty of better pilsners."
"Not a bad lager. I hate when these beers call themselves pilsners. This tastes nothing like a pils. Insofar as macro and macro-style American lagers go, though, its a better one. I'd take this over the big three any day."
"I pikced up a case of bottles over the weekend as a recomendation from a friend. I did not mind the $13 price, but I was thinking that it would be really bad at that price. I was releived that it was not at all that bad of a beer for the price. It is a beer that is more for guzzeling then savoring like some of the other I am used to. I thought that the carbonation was good and it had a good smell (it was not skunky). I liked this beer and I would buy it again."
"This would make a great session beer and had I bought more than one, I could have easily downed them all in a sitting. It doesn't have citrus or wheat notes or is watery enough to be a lawnmower beer but nevertheless, I'd have another one of these again if I wanted to enjoy a beer and not have to think about it too much!"
"Apperance is suprisingly good. Clear and golden with a ton of bubbles. Head is foamy and large with mild retention and quite a bit of lace. Smell is mild and has the adjunct beer smell. Palate is mostly sweet with corn and maybe a little caramel malt flavor. Very little by way of hops, just to balance a bit. Mouthfeel is light and bubbly with a fair amount of carbonation. Easy to drink and very refreshing. Not bad for an economy minded american pale lager."
"D- Very high. Comparable to BMC but with a little higher quality. Could be a bad bottle, but even if not probably would not have changed much."
"Pours bright radioactive yellow with a huge, hyperactive head that drops away to nothing (and I mean nothing) in about a minute. Smells like wet cardboard and paint thinner. Tastes almost as good - solvent and honey with a strange sour finish and not a trace of hop character. The finish speaks of latex paint. This isn't even a good mass market beer. Avoid with great vigor."
"D: I can drink this all day. I still have some left in the fridge. Its not a go to beer but its a beer you'd drink if you had like 12 bucks and nothing better to do."
"Tonight was a battle between this and Pabst and Pabst won in a landslide."
"Poured this one ice cold. This beer is a very pale yellowish beer. There really isn't a ton of head here. It smells a bit sweeter than most adjunct lagers, but not really that astounding. It is very light. Don't really get too much hops, but they definitely come through. This is a beer that i really enjoy to relax and drink when I'm not looking for much from a beer. I love to hang out with friends with a case and see how far we can get. And i know it doesnt have anything to do with the beer its self, but i always enjoy the little pictogram puzzles on the caps of the bottles."
"Poured a light gold with large head from carbonation but it dies quick. Some pils grainy like malt smell with hints of sweetness and herbal hops. Has a slightly sour taste for some reason but other than that has a decent amount of pils malt that mixes with hops so it passes down easy with nothing exciting. Has a dry finish and is an OK lawn mower beer but not much else."
"So, how many brands can one brewery produce? Sort of like the Tootsie Pop commercial - lets pop the cap and see. Drinkable, but far from commendable. Very mass-market adjunct lager character, more like Budweiser than anything. Slight corn flavor in the malt. Nondescript hopping with a bare touch of tartness. Fine lawnmower beer fare."
"Overall: A light, inoffensive pilsner. Nothing fancy at all- industrial like the town its made in."
"Drinkability - a good simple beer for sitting around. Not a tasters choice but still holds a place in its economic accessibility as well as its small town, working class appeal."
"Not recommended."
"D: There's no reason that you couldn't drink five or six of these at one time, but I'd rather not have to."
"Reviewing this for the heck of it. Had this straight from the bottle, for a party beer it has the classiest appearance in a bottle with regal label. No perceptible smell, taste was incredibly light, high carbonation, very watery. A beer for someone who has no desire to taste beer. Completely inoffensive and for that reason, very offensive."
"I would put this above a BMC light, but most of this style, the weakest and lamest of all the styles, in my opinion, are slightly more flavorful than this."
"The appearance is a straw-colored yellow with a very weak head and lacing. The smell was, well, like any beer might smell - nothing extraordinary or unusual. The taste was just fine, smooth and mellow. Perhaps a bit too mellow. The mouthfeel was rather weak. Despite the below average status in the other categories, Lionshead was quite drinkable, in an agreeable kind of way. Nothing special, but refreshing nonetheless."
"Drink this out of the bottle for maximum enjoyment. You can't smell the corn as much."
"It is the cheapest beer available in bottles by the case in Philadelphia and while that may detract some, it is a definite plus in my book. Brewed only miles away from relatives it is one of the best cheap beers available in my area. I am disappointed by the dismissive reviews of other drinkers."
"D-Very easy drinking and, while not all that interesting, it's a good beer to have around to space out the better craft beers I have. Also, the price is nice for my current economic situation."
"Lionshead Pilsner is a small step above the better known adjunct lagers (looks like I didn't score strictly to style). If you prefer corn beer over rice beer, give it a go. A single bottle trial is recommended, although the beer itself is not."
"D- This is a very drinkable adjunct lager that I would buy if given the choice. Very friendly beer to give to non-craft drinkers. This would be my choice if given a adjunct lager."
"Lionshead- The best head in town."
"D: While certainly not a stellar beer, this adds up to a good bit more than the sum of its parts. Pleasant, refreshing, and as an affordable macro - worthwhile."
"For $14 a case, this is really a good beer for the price. I know a lot of anti-BMC people like it"
"D - A slight step up from the traditional BMC product, but not by much... It's local and the price point is right on... Not a bad beer in absence of true craft, but definitely a last resort..."
"D. if i had under $15 and had to buy one case, this would be it"
"Drinks fairly easy, not bad for the style, but after about 3, I'd be wanting more hops or malt or both..I certainly would take this over BMC or even some Michelobs out there"
"Purchased for $5.69 a sixer, my expectations were set accordingly. Pours a light yellow color with a wispy head that dissipates fairly quickly to a thin lace. Aroma is clean, grainy with a hint of corn. Taste is fairly light and crisp, only a tinge of hoppiness to balance the sweetness. This isn't a bad brew when you feel like something easy and refreshing to drink. After trimming my hedges in 82 degree temps, this hit the spot and was quite enjoyable. Not a demanding, earth shattering brew but a well crafted pilsner that's enjoyable at face value."
"D) A well crafted lager. I would definitely have another one of these."
"Three cases of Lionshead, Sir. Gimme the change in Slim Jims."
"of course, don't drink it warm..."
"Drinkability: Well, that wasn't anything to roar about. It's not crisp, it's not complex, and it's not even marginally enjoyable. Pass on this one."
"I see that this one has had some unfavorable reviews, but I think for the style this one is about spot-on. The brewery seems to make three beers, mostly in the less-than-craft category, but they did well with something that's great for a hot summer day. Refreshing right out of the fridge. Recommended."
"Lionshead had a light golden look to it with a spritzy white head that did not last. No lacing on this. Smells and tastes like straw/hay, corn and light caramel malt in that order. Highly carbonated and crisp. Kind of hard to get down. Drinkability, not really, I did not finish it."
"Drinkability was high because it was thirst-quenching, but not in a very tasty kind of way. I guess it served its purpose well enough, going along with BBQ ribs."
"I was very much un-impressed with this beer and would rather have a Miller Lite if price was a factor."
"A great beer for the price."
"Overall - I bought it for my cousin because he remembers it fondly as a cheap, decent-tasting beer to enjoy with friends, and I'm inclined to agree with his reasoning. It's by no means an artisan brew, but it's not made to be that. It's a social, party beer. If I were holding a party, I'd definitely stock up on this instead of BMC standard."
"Not sure there is a valad reason to consume this beverage short of dying from dehydration in the desert."
"Pours a very transparent pale yellow color with a small white head that dissipates to an even smaller white ring around the top of the brew. Corn syrupy sweet malts and malt adjuncts in the nose, corn and rice, cheep sake comes to mind. What youd expect in flavor, light, crisp, not flawless but clean enough. Poundable im sure, not my cup of tea but my girlfriend likes it more than Corona, so its got that going for it..."
"This beer's merits depend on what you expect. Thankfully, I did not elevate any expectations to anything other than retro-style American lager. Any that is what it was, much like the Simpler Times, simple backyard summer lager to be drank cold & plentiful. However, unlike most of the macro-offerings, Lionshead offers a bit more character (although not quite the promise they offer on the label:""the best head in town""). A yellowy gold-pale brown pour with minimal white head & zero lace, the aroma is mild & corn-malt. Sweet malts & corn with a slightly bitter edge dominate, and the light, bright body has a nice crispness. Basic, but preferable to a Bud, &c."
"Drinkability is great - a surefire 6 pack during a game, or outing. Good alternative to the mass produced shyte, esp given the price. (Feelin sorry for that dude below who had to drop $7 on one)."
"Dull, almost sweet taste but lacks that good bitter kick. Easy to drink, even if lacking."
"On the nose, there's a ton of corn and butter. Maybe some malt and some hops but this is just such a bad example of the style. On the palate, it's the same. There's no crispness, no hop bite, tons of corn and butter. Carbonation is OK but the finish is a horrendous mixture of (surprise!) corn and butter. This beer was quite undrinkable, the only reason I choked it down was because I paid 7 fucking dollars for it. Avoid at all costs"
"Golden yellow with a tiny frothy head that disappears quickly. Smell is malty and sweet with notes of corn and a subtle hop aroma (maybe saaz?). taste is light and crisp with the german hops present. there is an artificial taste present, like corn or a offish malty sweetness. overall, really not a bad beer overall though."
"Although listed as a german pilsner above - the brewery website - I believe says American Lager style pilsner -- they do use corn as an adjunct in the brewing process."
"Mouthfeel is crisp. Overall this beer ain't all that bad especially for thirteen bucks for a case. A friend brought a case over and there was a bottle left so I decided to review it. I think using glassware really helped with ""airing out"" some of the off flavors that I tasted days before. Usually I would not bother with something like this."
"No head effervescent pale straw color. The aroma is corn wheat hint of citrus and floral. The taste is thin and watery got a dry bittery finish with lots of carbonation. You can taste corn, flower lemons, hints of cereal. ragged unbalanced. The only fun about this beer is what is under the bottle cap."
"ok lionheads best cheap beer you can buy i dont get why people around my area drink bud light ...when you can get lionshead for 10.99 a case or $50 for a 1/2 barrel come on this best is awesome...i can drink massive quanities of this beer ..its the best cheap beer in the world and o yeah you get little riddles on the bottom of the caps.."
"Lionshead Pilsner is a fine Pilsner for it's style. It's a light bodied beer that's refreshing and easy to drink. Lionshead has a crisp light Pilsner taste with with subtle hops and earthy malts and corn. It has a thin mouthfeel but crisp and clean. The finish is dry and again is refreshing and light. Recommended."
"Lionshead is the quintessential college brew for the price and the surprising decency for that price. Also in my older years seems to be a good fall back option when the wallet is stretched. 14$ for a case of bottles? Can't beat it."
"Not an amazing beer but certainly worth the value. The color is pale and clear and the bubbles surface continuously from the bottom. The carbonation is heavy but the head disappeared quickly. Some slight alcohol can be smelled. The beer tasts like a pilsner, light with a carbonated edge and some hops notes but nothing too impressive. This is not a hoppy pilsner. It is a beer that is easy to drink and can be refreshing in the summer but would not be a first choice year round."
"D: Honestly not much here to go on, a weak lackluster experience with no visible appeal, aroma or flavor and was just plain watery. Not even at $13 a case on college night could I recommend this."
"When I used to work in the area of Widener University, i'd see empty sixers & cases of this stuff all over the place. It's obviously one of those college-crowd, frat party types of beers. Pours the standard macro golden with a one finger head that fades quickly to a light collar. I see evidence of the usual macro fizziness, lotsa tiny bubbles. Aroma is sweet malt with maybe a slight timge of corn. I actually find the aroma kind of refreshing. 1st sip is mildy malty, with some corn notes. There's just the slightest hint of hops on the swallow, but it's VERY subdued. The hopheads out there aren't gonna like this much. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Overall, this is pretty good for what it is, a low cost macro. I don't find it offensive at all, and in the right situation ( an order of Buffalo Wings, a football game & a gathering of good friends), it would be quite pleasing. At $12/case (only 50 cents per beer!), it's quite a value!"
"Drinkability as I noted above is pretty top notch. It's a great beer for the holidays and the stuff gets addicting after a while. Good Wilkes-Barre brew! I highly recommend!"
"Overall this is not too bad of a beer, this is a pretty good beer considering that it is pretty cheap, I do happen to like this for cheapness and overall being a 6 pt beer, not bad and not the worst. I would not mind buying this one for later down the road"
"Overall a better than average macro lager. Not a pils however."
"D- this is more for the miller lite drinker if they arelooking to try different local beers. An ok brew but i have had much better."
"The drinkability is unbelievable. Especially at $14 a case of 24 loose bottles. A great summertime beer or a nice lunch beer as well."
"D: Not bad for $11/case. Easy drinker but nothing too impressive. Good beer for a low budget."
"Above swill? Of course. Better than decent? Thats for you to decide. I'd take a Lionshead over Silver Bullet, Bud, or Miller any day of the week."
"A fairly unimpressive beer, yet still enjoyable. For the money, it's one of the best bargains out there. It's easily above the BMC offerings, while being a bit cheaper. Not something to drink if you're looking for an intriguing beer, though."
"On to the beer, well nothing too much to say, fizzy pale, with a wispy head, very grainy, mine was exceptionally fresh and so along with the grain it made for a nice light taste that really wasn't too bad. Still, nothing remotely great or even that good about this beer, grainy taste but no hops or malt or semblance of body. But a nice cheap alternative to the BMC stuff."
"D: Crisp, clean, easy drinking, but not very tasty. Cheap though - just don't be upset if you get what you pay for."
"Gave this beer a 5 for drinkability just because it is so CHEAP!!! 10-12 dollars for 24 12oz bottles. Better than crap macros, super easy to drink. Still not ""good"" but for its price it is great."
"And yes the rumours are true, the glass is not sturdy!!"
"Watery and dull with a slight butteriness and a yeasty grain character. Mostly dry in the finish and again lacking. if you're looking for a lighter, inexpensive Lager then there are a lot better choices than this one. Not terrible, but nothing special either."
"CAUTION: Entire necks of these bottles have been known to twist off when people try to twist off the cap. I have witnessed it happen three times, only one incident resulted in a minor cut, but still beware the glass is low grade."
"Smell is pilsner malts and corn sweetness, taste is too sweet but better than any macro out there. Mouthfeel is light and almost a bit crisp, carbonation is good, gets a bit much if you are drinking 7+ of these, though. Drinkability is good, very easy to drink 12 or so in a night if you are so inclined. A few years ago this was less than $9 a case for bottles including tax but is a couple bucks more now. Cheap beer of choice, i just wish I could get a hold of it in a can like the picture shows. That would be sweet."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, considering the price ($13 for a 24 pack) of this beer is cheaper than any of the other macrobrews out there. This beer is a must try for macro enthusiasts."
"How you will approach this beer is really dependent on what you compare it to. Compared to the Buds Coors and the like you will love this beer not only is it cheaper (about $15 a case of bottles including taxes) but it tastes much much better. This is not a high end beer either so don't expect anything amazing. Though if you are strapped for cash and are hosting a party you can go much much worse. Personally I wasn't a fan of how it smelt can't really describe it."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, decent representation of the style, this is one is your perfect BBQ beer and that’s exactly where I had it. The price makes it that much more appealing. After analyzing the beer for the review, I knocked back quite a few of them over the short afternoon."
"Jumping on other folk's Blue Ribbon comments, I'd call this beer the PBR of PA. Come on, $10 a case? Well it's not awful. Looking at it from a pilsner perspective (not a macro lager), its like they forgot to add hops. The sweet and bready malt profile is ok for the style, but there's no hops to be found. It's inoffensive and not bad drinking, but hops would go a long ways here."
"Save this one for a hot day."
"This stuff sells for $10 a case, and it's better than the usual suspects of junk beer, plus it's fairly local for me. Factoring the price the stuff is amazing. As an added little bonus the inside of each bottle cap contains a rebus puzzle (they get harder the more you drink)."
"So why do I like this beer as much as I do? The malt has a nice, albeit subtle, biscuity flavor. Also, it has a crisp, clean taste that isn't sullied by adjuncts, which I assume it uses. The aftertaste is nice too, which is rare among cheap beers."
"ok its lionshead what can i say in college the best value beer ive ever had does look like anything special tastes way better than miller lite and ne other macros i support pa beers all the way if u want a session beer and drink all night grab a case of this $12 u cant get anything better tastes of a low grade pilsner not an ellitest beer but if im going to play beer pong or just drink to the face this is it"
"Im born and bred Wilkes-Barre. This beer is brewed about 1.5 miles from my house and i am fortunate enough to get the freshest Lionshead at my local beer super. I bought this about a day after it was bottled for 10.99 for a case of bottles. It has the same straw gold appearance of the big three, BMC, and also a generic macro smell. The taste is fairly sweet but has a noticible hoppy touch. In my opionion the carbonation is perfect, not too much, but its not flat. Tastes great all over the pallet and finishes crisp and clean. I am currently attending Kings College in downtown Wilkes-Barre and this is mine, and everyone elses GO-TO beer. I havent tried the lionshead light yet and dont plan on it. This beer isnt a light but is much lighter and easier to drink than others such as Sam Adams, I can only guess the light version is wattery and lacks flavor ( like 99% of other light beers). Easily enjoyable though, especially at the party scene, for a decently good beer at 10.99 for a case of bottles, you cant go wrong!"
"As a born-and-bred Northeast Philly gal, I was raised to respect Yuengling as the beer to drink when there's no beer to drink. However, this beer has all the proper credentials of a decent beer standby. The color and smell won't impress you- you'll think of Pine-Sol with its lemon acidic smell. But it goes down surprisingly well. It maintains a repectable head, but the cynic in me says that even the most sadistic of soldiers can afford a snazzy uniform. Forget the lemon smell and the Coors dressage, this beer was made for chuggage when its cooler older brothers Yuengling and Sam Adams are MIA, hot-rodding with hot chicks in fancy convertibles. This beer may earn its stripes with the college crowd, but I think it's handy to have around for cooking seafood and bragging to your younger brother that you still ""got it."""
"No emotional ties to this beer, I've never drank it back in college for insanely cheap prices, but I always like the Stegmaier beers I come across so when jcdiflorio offered me a bottled I jumped on this PA regional staple. Appears a golden clear filtered tone with a bright white decent sized white head, quickly dwindles to leave uneven bands of scattered lacing down my pint. Aroma has a mild sweetness and corn huskiness sort of a grainy character with a touch of metallic mineral quality, shows off a very light hop presence. Taste has dominant sweetness, grainy character light herbal, grassy hops low bitterness finishes with more of that metallic edge, not bad overall. Mouthfeel is light not watery higher carbonation nothing remarkable here to note on the palate this is the type of beer that will make you gaseous. Drinkability...well this is not something I'll search for but if I come across it while looking for a cheap and decent beer outside of the big three this one would entice me, but definitely worth the try just for the rarity."
"This beer was lacking in flavor and taste,very dull,with not much character.Left a lot to be desired."
"The carbonation is a little much and the finish is a little dry, but this is my new go to party beer."
"D - Fantastic. This is truly not a macro lager in style, but with the price it is in spirit. It is cheap and a wonderful goto for far better flavor than the standard macrolager."
"I walked into the beer distibutor and they had a case of this in bottles on sale for $11.35. I couldn't pass it up. It's a PA beer so I bought a case. It's a general light pilsner beer. LIttle balance of hops and malt, not too much, though. Pours a nice light straw to slight golden color, good head retention and easy drinking. It's better than Miller or Coors, but not too much better. For a micro I would expect a little more but for under $12 a case it's a good deal. If you can find this stuff for cheap buy it. It sure beats the macro's."
"Pale golden-straw with a small, white, fizzy head that quickly diminishes to a thin, lasting film. Smell is of moderate corn and grainy malt with just a hint of grassy hops. The taste is corny and macro-like. but not bad! Wow! Im actually impressed by something that was 70 cents for a single at the Hooters bottle shop. Has a pleasant, light, inoffensive flavor even if it is quite corn-laden. A little sweet, but balanced out by a light dry finish. It has a light body, smooth texture, and moderate-lively carbonation. As far as German Pilseners go, this is pretty bland and tame, but as far a cheap easy-drinkers go, this might be a new favorite!"
"Drinkability - would've loved to have another one, but I only had 1 from my pack."
"What we have here is a thoughtfully constructed, easy to drink macro pilsner that I paid $1.95 for. Ill definitely have this again!"
"Wow. I was actually really surprised with this one. My friend told me it was 11 dollars a case so I was expecting another watery natty light. I was wrong. The beer has a golden color. A light aroma that is on the sweeter side. A small recognition of hops in the flavor, but mostly a corn. This is a cheap beer that actually turns out well."
"Clear light copper in color. Half inch white foamy head which dissapated in a couple minutes. Has a sweet smell to it. Crisp light taste with a good deal of carbanation. Goes down quick and smooth. Easy to drink several at a time. Great beer for the price. 10.99 a case."
"Pleasantly suprised by this affordable pilsner. I grew up driving by the brewery on family trips and it took me several years to finally give it a try. Better drinkability and taste than most nationally produced pilsners. Light aroma and crisp flavor. Easy to put back several in a night and nothing to feel bad about because of the low price."
"Seems like Im really gettin jiggy wit the Lion lately. I recently found a case of this in the cellar that got lost in the shuffle about a year ago. Im quite surprised at how well its held up. The Lionshead Pils is a very inexpensive beer and very popular with the lawnmower and baitcasting crowd. It looks ok in the glass, nice golden color although the head was gone in an eyeblink. It has a nice malt aroma. The flavor is well balanced generally light and the finish has some staying power. It's very drinkable although one would probably want something better for an extended session. For $10 a case, this is a good deal, for sure."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Nope, I couldn't bring myself to share with the dogs. So sue me..."
"Pretty easy to slug these down without much thought or effort. A much better taste than any of the BMC offerings, and at $10/case it's well worth a try."
"Beer is good. Memories of when we used to buy this for $6 a case."
"Drinkability really isn't too bad considering this is on the low end of products made in PA. I used to buy this for about $13 a case when I was in college. Cheap beer but it's cheap tasting. It won't hold it's own with the greater pilsners out there but the drinkability is much better than many macros out there."
"This beer poured with no incident and came out a straw yellow and very clear. Very much in line with a commercial pilsner. A slight head formed and stayed thin throughout, but did not vanish. Very little lacing with this beer. I was disappointed at the smell of this beer; not much hop aroma and I could detect the corn in this beer before it ever hit my lips. The taste unfortunately followed the smell. This beer tasted like it had more corn in it than malt; the taste was without character and left a slightly bitter aftertaste, the only sign of hops in this beer. An average mouthfeel for a pilsner, crisp and clean. While drinkable, I do not know why you would waste valuable drinking time on this; except for one thing, it is $11 a case in PA."
"Poured a very pale perfectly clear amber color with a nice white head that was long-lasting and dissipated to slight lacing. Smell is very light and not unpleasant. Taste is very light with only a moderate crispness and little mouthfeel except wetness. Easy to drink and cheap"
"11 dollars for a case of this stuff! eleven bucks! i almost wanna cheat on scoring it and give it all fives just for that. this is the beer my crew always gets when we're going to concerts and sporting events (we're poor). it has a light gold color to it, kinda weak on the head but relatively decent. smell isnt really there at all. crisp taste. great for hot summer days....but its kinda watery. if you want alot of flavor to your beer this one would bore you to tears. no hops to speak....very little in the taste department. but its refreshing nature saves it from a below average score. lionshead is a primetime session beer."
"Zum wohl!"
"For 8 dollars a case, well, I'll probably return to this when I'm poor again. Still, not a ""bad"" beer, and certainly better than pretty much anything I've had from BMC. In the end, it's good to drink local, and support local businesses, right? That means Lion too."
"Lionshead is also a very drinkable brew. It does leave a noticable after-taste, but the remainder left on your tongue just makes you want another mouthful of beer. Moreover, it slides down the throat very easily, and it does not sit heavy in the stomach (no suprise for a pilsner)."
"One day a few fine years ago a couple of friends and i threw a few bucks together the buy a case of beer (and by few bucks i mean ten total). When we got to the beer store we asked for some natural ice, when I cought a glimpse of the case for lions head with a sign that read 8.99. Could this be? a bottled beer for less than ten a case, even the rancid natty ice was 12 bucks for bottles, so we grabbed the lions head. Upon opening the case I noticed the labels on the bottles looked as though they had been made on my computer, and the caps had no printing at all. At first pour it comes out a golden yellow, slightly darker than budweiser, and the aroma leads one to believe that its going to taste the same. The first taste is light with bubbles dancing no real descernable flavors perhaps some corn and a little hops at the end but otherwise nothing. I did notice despite the lack of flavor, it was as good or better than say a miller lite, and very very drinkable. Bottom line with this beer is if your broke its positively the way to go."
"Pours to a soapy head that fades to a tiny ring around the glass. Strraw-gold in color. Generous carbonation. Weak nose of faint sweet malt reminicent of traditional German-made light lagers, with an anemic whiff of finishing hops. Taste is leaning to caramel (or corn syrup?) sweetness somewhat offset by the hops. Finishes with sweet residue on tongue. For the lower price it is not bad. It tasted like, uh...I dunno...a watered-down Lowenbrau?"
"This beer really suprised me. The case was priced a measily $9.99. These are the same folks that brew Stegmaier Porter, a nice selection, so I thought it worth a shot. The head is pretty thick and foamy but dies down quite a bit. There is a faint hops aroma and a bit of caramel in the nose. The beer has a very clean taste, almost like a blond ale but not a lot of flavor. There is a slight buttery taste that has only a small amount of hops to balance it out. For a pilsner, this is extremely unique. I am not sure what they are going for with this beer, but it a decent choice."
"Definately made with quality hops, malt, yeast and water, but not enough of anything to make it taste like anything. Though this beer is very thirst quenching and a good introduction beer to introduce people to new styles."
