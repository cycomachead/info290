It's smooth compared to a typical malt liquor, and as strong as the weaker varieties of that style.

I like the color of this brew; it is not to dark but not too light. The smell is grain , malts, and some hops. It has the smell of an American Adjunct Lager.  The taste is bold with flavor, but it is refreshing and smooth.  You pick up on grains and malts. There is nothing bad about this brew. This is one Miller Brew that I really like. Mouthfeel is bold but clean.  I will get this brew again. Overall I'm giving Icehouse a 4 out of 5.","nicholas2121","Mar 06, 2014"

Thought i might be nostalgic. To be honest....i have had worse. Its for sure got that grainy, corn taste but you could do worse.

The color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell yields a slight aroma of floral, with a overtone of roasted wheat, corn, and rice, followed with the sweetness of malt. The taste is a little harsh and unbalanced, yet sort of appealing, with wheat and corn flavor in the lead, and undertones of cooked rice and just a shave of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is a little over carbonated, but what it short on smoothness it makes up in zing. Not a bad, cheap beer, that will cool you down after a hard day in the yard or sports. Not something you want to drink warm...heaven forbid, but a solid after a hard day of work beer.","beerprovedwright","May 20, 2011"

The taste has some corn in it, but mostly it tastes like bread and a bit metallic. It has a bit of a bite to it too that I like. It's not a particularly harsh bite. It's probably partially due to the carbonation and that metallic off-note, but it's there. It's got a bit of a starchy flavour to it as well, despite being watery. That's what i like about this beer, it's a water-beer for sure, but despite that it still tastes like liquid bread and it's got a 5.5% alcohol content. This is my go-to beer for a budget beer. My only problem with it is that it doesn't taste fresh. Something about it tastes old and stale. It's probably due to that metallic taste. That's no bueno.

Mouthfeel/body is light, it's thin and a bit watery with decent carbonation. Overall I just don't like this brew.

Maybe some wheat, corn, whatever flavors elicit images of personality-less folks in bowler hats. Seriously, this is one lazy-ass beer, folks. The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish. Yeah, this is pretty meek. It ain't all that bad, just...it's the wallflower at the party who's all really shy and when that decent-looking gal over there asks him to dance (I assume out of pity or something) he stutters and wets his pants, fleeing in even greater ignominy than usual.

There is a bit of a spice aroma on the tip of the tongue, but followed swiftly by the corn syrup flavor, which to its credit isn't that potent. There is a slight souring from the cheap hops. There is a granola like husk taste throughout. It's not really that complex, the mouthfeel is just as weak as I would expect. You could probably drink this if you want a cheap beer.

Icehouse is harder to swill than most cheap beers. While not so bad as Milwaukee's Best Ice and some others it doesn't have many redeeming characteristics. The aroma is very metallic and almost overwhelmingly that of corn instead of barley malt. There is barely any hop character if at all.

The is definite flavors of corn, an odd aspartame sweetness, just a hint of of grass, and a bit of booze. The mouthfeel, in my opinion is the saving grace for most AAL's but this one blows it. It finishes overly sweet and not dry at all. I like my AAL's to finish really dry leaving the palate wanting some more. This one completely lacks the quality.

Throughout, it's thin, very bland, the flavours ghostly, and it;s a bit watery except the oily soap quality. At first, it's ok and kind of drinkable, being mostly just a bland, basic but ok lager quality.

The body is just barely more than light - maybe a quarter of the way from light to medium. It's really quite nice with down market urban economy food.

1.93,-4.5,2,1.5,2,1.5,2.5,"This is a bad beer, but there are worse. Very pale yellow with only a very thin ring of head. The smell is very bad. No aromas stick out. Taste is similar. This is a light bodied beer. Drinking more than one of these is hard to do. I would stay away from this beer, unless your digging in the couch cushion for bling to buy beer.","Amdahl","May 21, 2003"
1.97,-2.5,1.5,2,2,2,2,"Had a couple of these on the golf course today. Overall, not too awfully bad for a Macro. Good swilling beer, if the need arises. Pale yellow in color, with a white head and typical fiziness. Limited aroma and taste. I know they sell alot of this stuff. Advertising is a good thing???","Boto","May 04, 2003"
2.36,16.8,3,2,2,3,3,"It's pale straw in color. A rather large fluffy head forms and is nice to look at for the 15-20 seconds it lasts. There's not much of an aroma, just a little grain. And the same goes for flavor, just a little graininess, and slightly noticeable alcohol. It's crisp on the palate and that's about the only plus to this beer. That and the fact that it can be a cheap buzz for someone who is broke. It's definitely not a beer for beer advocates to enjoy. Not much flavor, just a cheap buzz.","AudioGilz","Apr 15, 2003"
1.7,-15.8,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,1.5,"For a lot of my friends at college, this is the perfect drink for them. A six pack of tall boys is about 5 bucks, and after that you will be feeling alright. A nice cheap drunk, if thats what youre looking for, if for some reason you were looking for a tasty beer and thought this might be it, keep on looking.","Tballz420","Apr 05, 2003"

2.6,28.7,2,2,2.5,3,3.5,"Not too bad of a beer. Beats the hell outta Red Dog in my opinion. Had a nice slightly pale yellow color, skimpy white head, but decent flavor of hops. It had a bit of a watery / alcohol flavor that i found kind of overpowering, but compared to other beers in this price range, it's nothing to totally turn your nose up. If you have never had it, i say it's worthy of a try.","Frozensoul327","Mar 09, 2003"

1.88,-6.9,2.5,2,1.5,2.5,2,"well instead of waxing poetic about this beer, i'll get straight to the point. it's gold with a detergent head. grainy and alcoholic smelling. tastes slightly grainy with a pronounced alcohol bite. kind of a spritzy mouthfeel, the slight fullness in mouthfeel comes from the alcohol. if you want to get comfortably numb quickly...this is the beer for you. i'd recommend mixing this with some tomato juice or bloody mary mix, olives, pickles, and some tabasco. one of my top five all time worst hangovers came after a night of drinking this beer in college. the pain of the following day still haunts me. this is not a good beer...even by "swill" standards.","budgood1","Dec 18, 2002"
1.98,-2,2,1.5,2,2,2.5,"This beer came out of the can a gold color. There was a white head present no lace. It seemed to be well carbonated. The aroma was of weak malt and hops, alcohol was present. The taste was watery, carbonated that is about it. Look if it is hot out, the beer is ice cold and you are thirsty, think about it. Hey after you get 1 down, your taste buds will be numb enough to drink more. Don't expect much from this beer.","Jarod","Dec 17, 2002"

2.15,6.4,1.5,1.5,2,2,3.5,"Pours a clear goldent with a small white head. Smells of sweet adjunct and not much else...very very faint. The taste is very bland revealing a bunch of faint adjuncts with a carb bite and perhaps a mild black peppery hop flavor. Very thin bodied and very smooth....very drinkable if you want to "power drink" ;-). Maybe even a decent summer-time drink after a hard day of yard work. Not much else to talk about here.

The problem was, this beer just has a general, vague "beer flavor."  No real characteristics of any particular kind.  Overall, fairly bland and weak.  It would take a more discerning palate than mine to give a more definite description.","Brent","Aug 19, 2001"
