"Beer is good value for the price. Nice flavor and for the style of American adjunct very on point and I rate it against style. For 6.49 for 6 pack would visit again as I have in the past."

"While drinking this Beer,I noticed it is now Brewed by Coors in America,and even says in Very small print ""Product of U.S.A."" ~anyway it Looks fine [pretty much like most American Adjunct Lagers] Sort of a clear Straw Color,..however the Smell is very odd,and not in a good way,almost like Moldy Corn that has soured~also some Chemical notes,and just plain nasty to be honest~the Taste is not as bad as the smell...however you get a TON of Corn,and pick up some of that Moldy corn flavor,and a light Chemical taste,..you REALLY have chill this beer down,just as you would a ""Malt Liquor"" and drink em fast,because when it warms all those Moldy,Chemical,and off flavors become even stronger~would I buy this Beer Again? NO! however I have had much worse,and it is drinkable to a degree,but a chugging Beer all the way,you really do not want to savor a Beer this bad,cheers!"
"Pours a straw-yellow in color with a good 1/2+ finger white fizzy/foamy head that finally settles down to a thin layer after about 10 minutes or so. Some spotyy lacing is seen that stuck to the glass when sipped. The aroma is of hops and sweet corn. Pretty much the same is said for the taste. Starts out a bit dry and finishes with a slight bitter taste. Lighter+ bodied with good carbonation. Overall, it was just OK but not a big deal. Just a one time deal for me."

"DATE TASTED: September 12, 2014... GLASSWARE: Baltika stange...OCCASION: O's double-header sweep... APPEARANCE: shockingly lucid soft yellow body that is thinly bubbly; thick, foamy three-finger head laces sporadically; surprisingly tangible patterns .. AROMA: definite biscuit mats present; hops are slightly corny, a bit funky and gassy? noxious? some light bubblegum too--odd... PALATE: firm, medium-bodied, oily and lingering, though the aftertaste is light and unobtrusive...TASTE: lightly toasted, with some beechwood in the aftertaste; sweet and malty when swished; nondescript otherwise...OVERALL: mellow-not at all the Ice that one expects; at 5.6 ABV, it provides a bit more heft than the usual rote pilsener; sweet, cleansing and soft by its end...like the oversized can, but not much making this experience memorable..."

"Overall I'd say go and try this if you're tired of drinking bitter pinetree-esque brew for a quick buzz. Not too shabby on price, and it's easy drinking. Definitely not deserving of it's ""poor"" rating. That's reserved for Big Flats or Beer 30 for crying out loud. GET SOME."
"Overall: this beer is not horrible. It doesn't have a lot of flavor, but that means it's not disgusting. Just kind of blah."

"Overall, a good adjunct lager with some softer mouthfeel, but still uninspiring flavor profile. Score are based on to style rating."

"Molson Ice is an Ice Brew with an abv of 5.6. Not a bad brew. The taste is ok reminds me a of Budweiser. The color is a dark amber. The brew is smooth but it has a kick. This brew is better than what I thought it would be. I will be buying this this brew to change it it for the the american style Lagers."

"Molson Ice is a decently flavorful adjunct lager but pretty rough around the edges. If I had to chose, I would much prefer Molson's Canadian Lager to this so called ""ice beer."""

"O - Like pretty much every ""ice"" beer, it just can't stand up to the regular version it sprang from. The colder the better, to match the ice in the game you're watching that inspired you to buy it."

"O - Overall, probably the best AAL that I have ever had. Perfectly balanced, easy drinking and very sessionable. Even my summer shandy loving girlfriend liked it so that's a bonus!"
"Overall- Well nothing really all that fantastic and definitely nothing to go out of your way for. For 50 cents a bottle thought, you can’t expect too much, and it could be good for a party style brew I suppose."

"Let's rock some ice, folks! This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a half-finger of short-lived off-white foam. The nose comprises sweet corn, mineral water, sweet flowers, and a kiss of wheat. The taste holds notes of hard water, light tin, funky wheat, light powdered sugar, and mild corn. There's an off taste in there somewhere (it moves around, all Heisenbergian and whatnot). The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a kinda sad little beer, but one that thankfully isn't entirely offensive."

"Do yourself a favor and just skip this beer. I will from now on. I'm *pretty* sure now that Labatt Ice is the better ice beer of the two, from what I remember after retrying this. Soon enough though, I will be giving Labatt Ice another shot, and maybe post a review of it... for completeness reasons."

"When I think of ice beers, I think of my trip to Montreal 4 years ago, bring clueless about beer and buying all the repulsive ~9% lagers. This one obviously wasn't great but for this style I found it quite drinkable and not really harsh in the least. You can certainly drink worse."

"Simple drinking, nothing to really think about...my guess is not many people are drinking an ""ice"" beer to be wowed by complexities in the first place."
"Cheers!"
"Cheers."
"o - not as bad as i was expecting. would never buy this of my own volition, but if somebody offered me one i wouldn't refuse."
"RJT"
"Better than other ""ice"" beers that I've had (notably Keystone) over the years. Pretty good at a bbq and if in a bottle won't have that metallic taste which is common with canned beers. Is it still available? I've never seen it here in Texas, last had it while in California."
"Somehow, this is better than other Molson products. Not that I drink it, but I used to back in the day. Pours a pale golden-yellow with a fizzy white head that doesn't linger long. Light aroma of sweet malts and corn, some grain. Sweetness mainly in the taste, fading to a bit of what could almost be hop bitterness. Very light bodied and not very drinkable, but a tiny step above other TV ad T&A beers."
"Molson Ice poured out like most lagers do. It has a standard yellow color, very clear. With a white head on top. The head fades and leave you with just a glass of yellow liquid. The smell has some of the traditional lager aromas, they're a little funky and had some grassy notes. The taste is of light malts and a little hop bitterness. Nothing to really write home about here, just an average brew."
"I'd drink it again because I like variety, its easy to drink, its pretty cheap and its readily available."
"drinkability it is a very drinkable beer"
"Edit: I am not changing any scores--what I give is what I give, but I'll note that it's a shame this score is brought down by the sub-par appearance of this beer."
"Basically, a typical adjunct lager -- mild and cheap. Not one I'd voluntarily drink."
"overall not a bad macro i have to admit, would not mind it again,"
"For the style, not too shabby. None of the negative aspects are very prominent, the extra bit of alcohol behaves itself, and if you like corn, that's what you do get here, in spades. Wow, strains of homerism, anyone...?"
"Overall this seems to be just another macro-style lager for tha masses. Nothing to savor, just pound and repeat if neccessary. I'm not happy I tried it, but this is what I do."
"Drinkability: Not nearly as smooth as I'd hoped for. Started off ""eh"" but ended up closer to ""bleh"" by the time I'd reached the end of these twelve ounces. If you must, drink it cold and drink it fast."
"I certainly got a nice big two fingers' worth of head off of the pour! It looked like a puffy pillow laying atop the golden yellow beer with NE-quality clarity. The nose was not good, evincing a metallic tang along with cereal adjuncts and a light lager sweetness. Oof. Mouthfeel was on the thin side with a light sweetness on the tongue. I just feel like I am trapped on a treadmill at times. I could cut and paste many of my previous reviews of AmeriCAN Adjunct Lagers and only feel the slightest pangs of guilt. Regardless, it was pretty weak in terms of flavor and that same buyer's remorse continued well into the finish. This was really boring! So far, Molson Golden has been the winner in the family."
"This beer pours a clear extra pale straw color. The head is a quarter inch of big bubbled foam that recedes within a few seconds into virtually no lacing. The aroma is of faint bready malt. Quite boring. The taste has the same breay malt character with the addition of a mild grassy hop presence. It is slightly more interesting than the aroma, but still lacks complexity. The mouthfeel is light bodied with annoyingly high carbonation, and a watery texture. Overall, this beer has some flavor which distinguishes it from most of its style, but it still has a long ways to go in terms of complexity. I can't see myself drinking this again."
"24 ounce can from local grocery store. Clean pale yellow pour. It tastes like it always has: mellow, hoppy (to some degree) and smooth. You can definitely put these back if you feel so inclined."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is also mild, some malts and corn. Not a whole lot of flavor here. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall not terrible, but nothing special here."
"Poured a pale yellow color with an average white head. Not much on the nose here. Taste is very light as well. Nothing interesting at all. Grainy/malty with maybe the slightest hint of hops. Mouthfeel is carbonated and extremely thin. So watery that I couldn't even finish it. It's drinkable in that it doesn't do any offensive or challenging, but it's not enjoyable enough that you'd want to have more than one. Catch 22, I guess."
"A Pale staw gold color body with a light creamy head and lacing. The aroma is slightly skunky,and malty very little else. The flavor is very grainy and has an artificially sweet finish but not too bad . This is a little better than I was expecting, very sessionable."
"D: This is a nice session beer, that I will buy again."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can marked SEP2408-03337L. Sampled on August 25, 2009. The pour is a pretty clear straw yellow with a good inch or more of foamy, bubbly white head. The aroma is a bit of corn, some hops, and some malts but for an ice beer the alcohol scent is diminished. The mouthfeel is heavier than water with reasonable texture and staying power on the tongue. The flavor comes across as malty and bready with a tinge of sweetness. Better than I expected."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a towering white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry, pilsner malt and adjunct scent along with little to no hop aroma. The taste is average as well. It has a clean pilsner malt and adjunct taste with a super dry finish. It's easy drinking, but lacking any real character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is your standard ""ice"" brewed lager. It's crisp and clean and devoid of any real beer taste."
"Drinkability: It's not horrible, but I probably won't be getting it again."
"Pours a fizzy yellow beer, bright golden clear body with large fizzy white head dwindles quickly leaving fine bubbled sparse lacing. Aroma has cooked veggies with light cereal notes no actual hop components going on here. Flavor is pretty weak watery, cooked veggies metallic waves of grain. Pretty rediculous flavored American corn and rice ridden product. Mouthfeel is fizzy and light watery bodied, even from an ice beer. Not the worst canned beer, that would be Carling Black Label. Completely unremarkable brew from America's oldest brewery."
"Drinkable? Yea. Taste is bland and unoffensive, and that's what its supposed to be. Can't attack this for being an adjunct lager."
"D - This is okay. If I were to ever go ice fishing in Canada, I could see myself taking some of this."
"This beer has a light body with light carbonation to it. It's pretty easy drinking like most Canadian beers. It is a bit crisp and clean tasting."
"Taste: served at 45.5 degrees F. Beginning notes of corn and salt; soapy. Then sugar and pennies, sweetness. Finishing notes of well water. Drinkability seems to decrease with time, but buzz-factor goes up quickly."
"Why? Because it was cheap and available. Why not, chump? Out of a green bottle this beer was a perfectly clear, pale gold color with a thin, off-white head. The retention was weak but the lacing actually pretty good. The aroma was quite skunky, with lots of corn and a light sweetness. The flavors were about what one would expect, starting on a dry, grainy note my palate had trouble pulling specifics out of it until the pale malt sweetness at the end finally showed up. The mouthfeel was a bit rough and oily, the carbonation medium/high and the body medium."
"D - Its been a long time since I've had my last Molson Ice and for some reason its easier to drink now than it was back then its not a bad beer to drink after shoveling the driveway or watching hockey."
"Notes: Overall I would say that this is one of the cleaner crisper Ice beers that I have had."
"(rated Sep 23, 2008)"
"If it has ""ice"" in the name, chances are its a cheap and quick buzz, and thats really all its good for. I will most likely have it again but I wasn't overly impressed."
"Pours a clear pale yellow golden color. Has a nice white head that stays around a laces a bit. Smells sweet, a bit sour, or metallic. Taste is very crisp with a carbonation bite. Watery and some pale hops for flavor. Mouthfeel is decent, it goes down easy and I wouldn't mind having another."
"This is a very poor excuse for a beer. Even when compared to other American macro lagers it's subpar."
"D - A little too sweet and a little low on the carbonation end for me to choose this over other macro lagers. Not a bad example, but not something I can see serving a specific purpose or occasion."
"Pours a light, fizzy, yellow color with some good head, but not much carbonation. Decent malty scent, slightly skunky. Nice taste for a macro lager, good and crisp, mostly malt, with just a bit of hop presence to smooth it out. Very smooth, a nice ice beer overall."
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a nice golden with a half finger head that settles into a medium collar. Lighter than expected carbonation, not nearly as fizzy or bubbly as other macros. Nose is malty. Taste is smooth & malty with very little hops & a clean finish. Mouthfeel is squarely in the middle, not watery or heavy. Overall, a decent, drinkable alternative when money's tight. or when there's only inferior choices available."
"I'm very surprised this beer got such low ratings. It may be mass produced, and it may not be all that unique, but Molson Ice is certainly delicious and gets you very drunk on the cheap. This is not a craft brew, but for what it is there aren't many better beers out there. Molson Ice manages to be refreshing, tasty, and full of alcoholic goodness, a trifecter of awesomeness. It drinks well in hot and cold weather. You can down one after mowing your lawn or let it warm you up on a cold winter night. Molson Ice and I go way back. My taste in beer has certainly become much more eclectic since the days of chugging Molson Ice in my parent's basement, but I don't think I'll ever get sick of this beer."
"d - this is a decent, but very ordinary macro lager"
"Light body, but not overly carbonated. Not very impressive, but maybe a small step above some of the others."
"Had this up in Canada, where it is 8.3% if my notes are correct. Pours a flat gold color which is seethru and the big, frothy head dies quickly. A semi-metallic smell coupled with grainy hops and no malts passes for the smell. While it is sharp and there is a slight alcohol burn, it goes down mostly smooth with some veggie and sweet malts taste combo, albeit ever so tastey (and by that I mean it rarely tastes good). I wouldn't mind having the Canadian version one more time since a couple can buzz you; other than that avoid."
"Pale swill yellow color and overall appearance. The flavor is a combination of grainy malty bitterness and some skunk. Not easy drinking. Actually, not a big fan of any Molson product. Best I've had is probably the Golden but even that's very limited."
"D: Drinkability, no thanks. Not very good or likely will re-visit. Avoid and don't bother."
"D- Its your general macro here. Not a whole lot of taste or character. I however can say there are a lot of worse macro ice beers out there."
"I don't think I've drank one of these since I was in college 12 years ago, so why not try it again? 12 ounce bottle, with I assume a best by date of September 28. 2008. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a light gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention is low, lacing is good. It smells like corn, malt and grain. Not offensive. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with a teeny bit of grassy hops in there. But for the most part it tastes like a macro lager, but a little better than similar beers. Same with the aroma, there's nothing offensive about the taste. Mouthfeel/body is light, but it's not watery. Average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's pretty easy to drink. For the style it's not bad at all."
"Drinkable if you want a super-bland beer. I suppose there are some out there that think this gives you an extra ""kick"". It's only .6% more than a typical macro, with the same (lack of?) flavor. Whatever..."
"D- goes down easy enough. This is the party staple. its a little more fun to down than the regulars without killing the pocketbook"
"D= as long as you don't have an allergy to the same yeasts that I do, go for it."
"D--Really just mild all over. A good beer for teenagers looking to impress girls by buying something other than Bud, Miller or Corona. It was my first beer so I still have some affection for it."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tall pilsner glass. Nice white foamy head, over a golden liquid with plenty of bubbles. Grainy smell of corn and yeast. Not bad tasting, bready, grainy taste, very light and refreshing, with a dry finish. Easy to drink, very light bodied."
"Molson Ice presents a finger of white head on a body of light gold body. The smell is horrible--the skunkiness from Molson's green bottles is so notorious that the company should actually patent it. What a pity, especially since Canadian is a pretty decent beer. But Ice and Golden unquestionably suffer from the green bottle blues. The flavor cannot salvage this beer--it's decent, mild with corn and modest malt, semi-sweet. The carbonation helps this--it's not flat and doesn't fade easily. But in the end, this is not a tremendous beer by a long shot, and suffers from first-scent impression. Not all bad, and decent when ice cold, but there are far better brews, and any Canadian beer in a brown bottle would get chosen before Molson Ice."
"From a 24 ounce can into a glass. Pale gold with a good white head. Minimal lacing. Smells like corn and cereal grain with a touch of rubbing alcohol. The tastes reflects the smell and is only slightly better. Good carbonation and medocre drinkabilty qualities. Ehh..."
"Molson Ice pours a crystal clear yellow gold with a sticky head. The aroma is sweet and grainy. The flavor is the sweet with more of the malty grainy taste. There is some sulfur but not too much, considering the green bottle. I haven't had this beer in years, but I'm not sure I missed it."
"Drinkability: An easy brew to pound. Very light and refreshing, but with enough flavor to let you know it is a beer."
"Not the best offering by Molson, but not that bad for a macro. If you want more ABV from these guys, pick up a Molson XXX, or if it's more tolerable flavor you're after, check out the Molson Canadian. Otherwise, keep moving in the beer aisle."
"Color is golden yellow with a nice head that fades quick though. Aroma is decent and malty for a macro lager. Taste is much of the same except that there's some bitterness and a bit of a bite in the back of the throat. Goes down smooth though with some adjunct taste, possibly corn. Inoffensive, strong and not too bad for a macro lager. I would give it a fair rating much like I gave Molson Canadian."
"not a bad beer for the price and i can reuse the bottles on brew day. i'd pick this beer over bud or miller."
""
"I remember when this first came out everyone was raving about the alcohol content. Drink and get fried faster. Honestly, I couldn't get fried fast enough to keep drinking this beer. Far from the worst I've had, sure, but with no real identity and a dead skunk in the nose, I can safely say I will steer well clear from here on out. Ice cold, it goes down, but anything less and it's just as likely to come back up."
"Cooked cabbage for an aroma, cooked corn for the taste. No malt anywhere  and I thought the ice brews were stronger. This lil puppy is only 5.6% Glad this was left by a bro-law, Id hate to think of buying one. Whata crap brew. I hope the other Molson brews are better than this. Not even lawnmower level"
"Overall, not too impressed, I'd rather drink Golden."
"D- I can drink it. I'll have a few. If I don't pay for them."
"I opened the bottle and the first thing that hit me was the bitter aroma. It was very pungent and hit my nose quickly. After I took the light sip and let the golden liquid roll across my mouth I swallowed. I noticed two very distinct problems, first off the beer seemed to coat my mouth with something, secondly it had a very bitter and dry aftertaste. After a few more I ended up just slamming it to get it over with. It was one of the worst beers I think I have ever had, although I am by no means a beer expert. (I am sure there are worse) But I ended up giving it another shot a few days later and still of course had the same reaction. I would not recommend Molson Ice no matter how much Canada reminds you of hockey."
"D: Not too tasty, but it at least it isn’t filling. If I’m forced to drink a beer in this style, it wouldn’t be this one if I had another choice."
"Poured out of a 24oz can that I picked up for the train ride home. The color was slightly toasted straw, clear, with a decent white head that dissipated into a slight cap that left some soapy lacing. The smell is just terrible, total adjuncts, cooked veggies, gross. The taste is more bland than the smell, which is a good thing in this case. It has an artifical sweetness to it, no malt or hops to be identified. The mouthfeel is watery, poor. The beer goes down easy but doesn't taste like anything. Not something I would look to buy."
"I don't know, but all ice beers to me suck. This is definetly one of the better ones though, it's a lot better than labatt's ice. Not like molson to put out something like this, but I blame it on ice beers sucking in general. It's not great, but nothing to complain about ya know. Might as well go with the beast.."
"My dad classified this as a ""ballpark beer."" I'm inclined to agree."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Overly carbonated... it's quick and fierce in the mouth, leaving no rewards during or after the swallow. The cheap, fake taste of this beer is horrific and kills drinkability big time."
"Molson Ice pours yellow with a thick white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. At first the aroma seems skunky, but then I think I smell some hops. Some grain aromas too. Doesn't taste like much, slight hop flavor is noticeable, kind of a dry finish, alcohol slightly noticeable."
"Bought on the reccommendation of a friend who likes Guinness about as much as I do. Yellow/light amber body with thin white head that dissipates rather quickly. Looks better than I expected. Smells yeasty and hoppy, somewhat sweet. Smells tasty. Tastes sweet and watered down, but agreeable. Very slight hop on the finish. Not great, but better than I thought itd be. Give me this over any Anheuser-Busch (at least that Ive tried) any day of the week, if I have to drink a macro."
"I decided to pour this in a mug instead of chugging it out of the can. When it settled, the beer was a straw yellow with a tall fizzing head of white foam. It fizzled away really fast and it decided to leave few rings and no lace around the glass. It had a light aroma of sweet malts and plenty of adjuncts. It almost basically tasted like it smelled, sweet malts, plenty of adjuncts like corn and rice, splash of hops and some alcohol at the very end. The mouthfeel was very thin, not too watery, and with an aftertaste of corn. It tasted like an average macro lager and something I'd probably not buy again unless it's $1 for a 24 oz. can."
"D: It doesn't start out very drinkable, but after a few the 5.6% abv fix that."
"Light body, mouthfeel improves as the ale warms a bit, I think it pretty drinkable for an AML and it does pack a small punch, one was enough for me."
"Good stuff! it doesn't have that heavy bitter taste that most imports have. You can drink a number of them and they all go down as equally smooth. It gets you to that buzz level a litttle more quicker than other beers. If you never had one before it's worth the $23.00 for the case."
"Poured from a bottle into a stein, it's a very average looking macro lager. Really indistinuishable from any other. It's a light yellow, with very little head. What head there is, is white and dissipates quickly. Lacing is minimal. Almost nonexistant, but to be expected from this type of beer. There's a very faint skunky aroma, but it's gone quickly. Almost no nose on this beer. The palate is utterly forgettable. It tastes similar to Budweiser, Coors, etc. There's really nothing distinuishing about it. It's just a very, very average beer."
"Straw yellow with a white fizzy head that settles down to a thin lace. The aroma is semi sweet malt with a mild alcoholic sweetness. Taste like your average macro lager. Soft malts, a little bit of grassy hop. Metallic dry aftertaste. Light bodied and drinkable. Next!"
"Not a bad commercially macro lager. You gotta like the 5.6% ABV. I think this beer is best enjoyed very cold and out of the bottle."
"Taste has a good thirst quenching-ness to it, lemon-pear, some hops, little malt, carbonation. Leaves a clean finish, but a bit of skunk on the tail"
"Pours a golden yellow color, some carbonation, small head, some lacing afterwards. The scent is kinda skunky, but not to bad. Some malts and citrus. The taste is sweet and malty, and a dry finish. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, I like this brew much better than the Golden."
"The taste is sweet and has that same mild astringency. There's a tiny hint of a biscuity taste. Bittering hops just barely noticable. Watery, but inoffensive."
"Overall drinkability is low. I won't be buying this again. This bottle (fortunately not a six-pack) is for science, not enjoyment. Never again."
"In comparison to Molson's Lager, this one is a little stronger in sweet malts and a little harsh with the hopping. Hops get dangerously close to light-struck. Flavors are rich, but a noticably grainy, vegitol, and bite-ey. Has almost a baking-soda finish as the beer qualities relax and the harshness and husky bitterness increases. Still, a worth-while attempt, but the higher alcohol is not worth it."
"Notes: not a good one"
"The only saving grace for this beer is that it looks nice. Fluffy white head, somewhat bronze golden color. Nice. As for the rest of this beer. Horrible. I like Molson, I prefer it over American macros, but this stuff is nasty. Strong alcohol flavor, yet abv is not really that much higher than the regular stuff. A bit of a rough grainy flavor in there, might be skunked a little. Body is thicker than most which takes away from smoothness and ease. This is tough to drink. Really tough imo. Ice beers are stupid and pointless and this one is in particular stupid and pointless. Buy regular Molson instead."
"Pours a very clear, extra pale straw, with a big three-finger head and unlikely retention for a macro. Hoppy aroma with spent grains and adjuncts. The bitter and bland taste predicted by the smell prove false when the light body and active carbonation glide down your throat extra smooth. Noble hop flavor is balanced, but set against an adjunct lager flavor. Moderate euro ""skunk"" taste lingers a bit, but finishes mostly clean. For once, an ""Ice"" version turns out better than the original."
"I've got to say, for an Ice Lager, this wasn't too bad. Poured out to a golden color with a good level of carbonation. Not too much, not too little. No lacing noted. Odors of corn, malt and dough were noted, as was a bit of alcohol. Taste was decent for being a macro brew; corn, malt and a touch of barley. Kind of dry. Finished a little on the watery side with a hint of dryness. Not bad. Worth a try."
"It is drinkable. I will remember this beer like I remember Miller High Life; it will have a positive mental note but it will have an asterisk next to it, Drink only when in need of something cheap for an occasion when taste is approaching secondary. In reality I didnt think this beer was bad at all. I need to try this beer again. Maybe it was a fluke. I purchased one 12-ounce bottle in Omaha."
"A vertical pour will give you a 5-finger white head that fades quickly to a ring but it does leave a good lace. Clear, very pale amber color. Light carbonation and very light bodied. Nose is skunky. Starts slightly sweet but both the malt and hops are very light, there's no beef to this beer. $1.50 for a 12oz from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Overall-passable beer in my opinion BUT I will say that as far as ice beers go it is one of the most tolerable I've had, so if this is your style, go for it you may have found your new favorite beer."
"Drinkability: Yeah, sure I could drink a lot of these, but why bother. Little satisfaction at the bottom of the glass. Not too terrible, but nothing special either."
"More drinkable than most ices, but PBR is better tasting, cheaper, and just as available when opting to ""go slummin'"". Another con is that too often I get a bottle that is skunked or damn near."
"Drinkability is average, I remember having no problems knocking these back when I was younger, now, I wouldn't get it just because ice beers just don't make me go out of my way. Still, this is an okay generic ""burp beer""."
"poured witha froathy meranguelike white head on a clear plae yellow body. soft mild malt/corn aroma and that's about it nothing else. surprisingly a mouthfeel with some heft to it, not as watery as I though it would be, has a creamy finish to it. not really that bad if you de-gas it a bit. upon further examinination, the aroma contained an asringent corny aroma and a bit of a metallic mouthfeel, this was experienced as it warmed up. don't let it do this."
"Drinkability: Its ok, but my experience with this beer is I have to drink them quickly or else they tend to skunk. I will have to have at least one other ""Ice"" beer to compair this to, but as far as macro produced adjunct lagers go, I'd just as soon not purchase this one again."
"Poured very light, very clear, very minimal head and no lacing. Just the faintist wiff of malt in the nose. Watery, lame, a waste of good water. What else can be said of this nasty brew. To bad Molson doesnt brew a classsier product. This stuff is ok to boil some Brats in. Good for a very hot humid day while pushing the mower. Besides that pass it by. Buy some craft brew."
"Overall this beer is probably among the best of the Ice lager beers which is probably one of the most disgusting beer styles on the market today. Not a great beer, but better than a few of them out there."
"The brewery says that Molson Ice is ""America's #1 imported Ice Beer"". Think about that for a minute. What other countries, besides the U.S. and Canada, even brew such a thing as an Ice Beer? It's all hype anyway; a macro lager is a macro lager is a macro lager. This is an especially bad version though, so I guess that there are degrees of badness."
"One of the better mass produced pale lagers."
"drinkability: not that great,yeah, you could slam down some of these, but it's not something I would seek out, o.k. is the best I can give it!"
"Although I am glad I tried it, just to get it under my belt, not one I would try again."
"drinkability- all the mediocre qualities of this beer aside, this beer is a worthy session beer. its rather strong and goes down easy."
"Not much in the way of aroma, although there is a slight fruity twinge to it. The taste was remarkably smooth very a little bit of malt taste insterpersed with some hops. Overall, this beer is ramarkably smooth and quite drinkable. Definitely one of the better ""Ice"" beers that I have had. It would probably be a good beer for tailgating parties!"
"Molson Ice is the kind of beer that isn't a bad beer to drink with buddies at a ball game or fishing. It's not offensive and can really be quite refreshing."
"Drinkability  This wasnt bad, but the ice treatment of this lager didnt help the beer at all and only gave it a 0.6 increase in ABV."
"I just find the whole thing a bit too rough edged over all. No polish to this beer and you can substitute anyone one of dozens of other beers for this one. Light, thin and corny. Better than a Bud I 'spose, but thats damning with faint praise."
"Like others I recommend only having this ice cold, and only in a pinch. I can tolerate it once in a great while, but it's still a very plain jane brew."
"Clear, pale yellow hue, thin carbonated head. Faint adjunct present aroma, some grainy and earthy smells are un-inviting. Husky and grainy, over-carbonated, champagne like feel. A delicate taste of corn, which is even advertised directly on the can. Very thin, horrible as it warms, not much going on here, other than a highly over-hyped, mass marketed, northern tier macro."
"Better than average Molson. The beer to have when there is no good beers because the host is an ignoramous on beer. The ice is a gimmick, but if you serve it exceptionally cold, it taste a tad like vodka left in the freezer. And that's the best I can say about it."
"Clear, pale yellow color with a whispy, thin, white shadow of a head. Very little aroma to speak of....a hint of graininess and faint hops. There's a grassy, grainy sweetness, but there's also a lack of depth and complexity. Finish is crisp and sharp. Alcohol can't be tasted, but it's faintly evident in the aroma. Much more carbonated than is necessary. Average and everyday, and unispiring. Still, not as undrinkable as most macros."
"cheers!,"
"Not a bad summertime beer. If you are in a jam and cannot find some quality stuff this will get you through. Typical american lager taste with a little bit of hops thrown in. I experienced no skunkiness due to the fact my sample was from a big 24oz can. I could enjoy this stuff if nothing I preferred more was around."
"Next time I'll panhandle."
"Yellow not gold when poured it had a nice head that lasted thru the drink. The green bottle used to be ""cool"" but I think it enhances light and kills what taste it has. Smelled a bit of skunk but not over-powering. I liked this Ice but could fair better if I wanted the higher alcohol. I would drink it again."
"12 oz green bottle. Poured a typical straw yellow, with a moderate head, that didn't stick around long. As soon as I opened the bottle out jumped the skunk. After letting it set for a few minutes, was able to smell some faint hints of malt. Taste was fizzy and watery and bland. Not that it's bad it is just nothing special. Good session beer"
"i feel as if i'm stuck in a rut of reviewing average to below average brews. that doesn't change with molson ice. actually poured a deeper gold/yellow than i expected, but with absoulutely no head and minimal carbonation. smelled a bit sweeter than i remembered and the taste proved my nose right. definitely too sweet of a taste here for me and i was put off by the hints of alchohol as well. not a major problem with the beer itself, more of a personal preference thing, but i was still not that impressed overall."
"Not a rewarding expierience..."
"One of the better ice beers out there. Straw color with a short head. Not much in the flavor department. Regular Molson taste, but in ice form. Cheap! I buy this sometimes when I'm very strapped for cash in the summert months. Packs a punch to make up for the lack of flavor. Still one of the best ice beers on the market."
"Molson Ice is a quaffable beverage that doesn't deliver a whole lot (except for a buzz), but makes for a good hot-weather beer. Some of the unpleasantness in this beer can definitely be cut down if served really cold. Altogether, an average macro ice beer."
"Very,very light beer. Goes down just like water. It is a pale yellow color with a thick white head on it. After taste is light but with a hint of alcohol left behind. Not bad all around though, if you are looking for a light beer, with a good amount of alcohol in it. Even better is the price, $1.25! I'll definately be back for this one."
"not a bad beer...but not very good either. just typical north american/canadian macro crap. drink labatt ice if you want a better ice beer."
"This beer came to the table in the pint glass a gold straw color. The head was non-existent, but I did happen to look over and notice that it was white when it came out of the tap. The aroma was not all that there, smells of corn, grain, water, some citrus and hops. The taste was watery and not that impressive. Some malt, hops and corn were present, but I did notice the taste of alcohol in my glass. Decent carbonation was present. The one thing wrong with this beer is that the few times I have had it before I noticed that they all tasted different from the next. Better then drinking the other stuff they had on tap."
"This is like the Canadian Bud. Molson Ice is my cheap beer, the old stand by. It has good flavor and goes down easy. Plus it's no that filling, so you can drink a lot of it. But it does have a kick, almost like heiny, but not as bad. If you want to get buzzed on a good, worth the money beer, this is the one."
"The bottle is very ugly, a precurser to what awaits. This ""beer"" needs to be very cold just to make it past your tongue. Gold color with a nice thin head. It tastes like metal if warm, no taste if chilled properly. Stick to Colt 45."
"Happy Drinking"
"Clear. Very nice yellowish gold color. Topped by a creamy white head that holds well. The aroma is limited but reveals a very lightly fruity, softly grainy malt. The body is medium with a fine, moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is lightly crisp. The flavor offers far more character than the aroma suggests with a fruity, sweetish & grainy malt that's backed by a gently crisp & lightly spicy hoppiness. Although the alcohol is only 5.6% by volume, it's slightly noticeable. Combined with the fruitiness, my guess would be that they're fermenting this lager fairly warm (over 60F). It finishes fairly short and dry. An unremarkable, fairly basic beer that has a bit of malt & hop character and an easy drinkability."
"My first Canadian ice beer.It poored like a classic pilsner style, pale gold with a nice head. It gives off a strong oder thats more noticed than the taste. The taste is alittle bitter but not bad. Alcohol is up at 5.9%, but not like the strength or as heavy as an IPA. A ok hot day summer brew.Like the name implies, serve very cold."
"Yellow color with a fair head.  Peculiar smell.  Weak hops/malt taste, but not unpleasant.  No headache, that's a plus.  Finishes okay."
"I normally don't drink '""ice""  beers as I usually take that as meaning ""no flavor, high alcohol.""  I used to drink Molson Ice in college, and when it first came out, I prefered it to Bud etc.  The one value it has is that it is beer, and when cold it drinkable.  Some bitterness gives this beer taste, but overall not very good."
"I used to like this beer in college, but it seems to be skunky more often than not. Not worth the risk, even though it is a smooth clean beer on it's ""good"" days."
"Thin lace with good clarity. A bit more harsh from what I remember. Mild solvent alcohol in the nose and flavour. Thin on the malt with little hop to balance though being on the dry side it is not too bad. There are cheaper $$$ ice beers that taste the same."
"This beer is not less than average, but not more ether."
"Golden yellow in color with medium big bubbled head.  Firm hop character is balanced by its smooth medium body with good drinkability.  Slight alcohol taste."
"Consumed directly from the bottle while playing some frisbee golf.  Smell is classic macro lager; adjuncts and adjunct sweetness.  Mostly adjunct sweetness with a slight bit of malt detected and a few hops thrown in.  This is a pretty drinkable brew.  As far as ice lagers go I would have to say that this is probably one of the better beers that fits the style.  Not a great beer by any means, but when the cash is tight and I'm not in it to savor the taste I will go with this one."
"I found this addition to Molson's line to be a disappointment.  As a macrobrew, I usually tend to get Molson when offered a Canadian beer.  But I think the other Molson holds up better than this one."
"Exactly what part of the population likes to drink this beer? It tastes like sink run-off. It's harsh with a bad aftertaste. And it has no odor."
"Another case of bottled urine. This I will never ever ever touch again. I nearly had to spit it out the first time I had one. I couldnt finish the bottle. Since then, I have a few times taken a swig of someone's, each time hoping that, this time, it will taste good. It never does. Absolutely disgusting beer."
"Generally, I don't really care for ice beers.  You are usually left with an aftertaste that resembles swallowing cologne.  However, this one isn't too bad.  Somewhat sweet (corn?) and actually easy to drink.  5.6% ABV, which is slightly lower in alcohol than many of the other ice beers out there and not too bad.  I really wanted to dislike this beer, but I found myself reaching for another one.  A decent BBQ quaffer from Molson."
"So what does it taste like? Go out on a rainy night & find a skunk that was knocked dead by a case of cheap beer falling off a truck. Take that bad boy home & wring him out in a glass. Molson makes some decent brews - this is NOT one of 'em..."
"this is what we used to buy to get drunk quick and cheap when i was younger. 7 bucks a twelve pack."
