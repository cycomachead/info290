"Cheap beer with good alcohol content. Nothing fancy expected from Miller"
""
"rated from previous tasting notes"
"Just a really bad beer"
"This is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It looks way better than you'd expect, and it pours a surprisingly thick and creamy head.  It actually has some flavor (tasted similar to PBR to me but not nearly as good, kind of a creamed corn taste. Tastes cheap to be sure, but it could be worse) but it could go down much smoother. It's also extremely cheap. This is the perfect beer for kids in college who just want to get drunk."
"It is the Milwaukee beast!"
""
"O- this is one of the most drinkable AAL that I've had.  It doesn't have that off-putting finish that most do.  Not much flavor, but compared to others in it's class, pretty good"

"Overall (1.83) : I gave the rest of the 12 pack to my friend and he left the three slices of pizza. I got the better end of the deal. We are not huge drinkers so he got six cans to take home. I still got the better deal. I never expected much to begin with, but this is truly horrible even then. Would not buy again, not even for $2 a 12 pack. Yeah it's a terrible beer - tastes like miller lite's reject batch from experiments gone wrong."

"As far as cheap beers go, this is my favorite. I don't expect much for $.50/can, and this one surpassed my expectations. It's got the strongest most defined flavor IMHO, a higher alcohol content than many of the other cheap beers, so it's great for a party, but also really easy drinking for just a day relaxing."

"I don't understand the piss poor ratings for this. Tastewise this beer is pretty decent. It tastes like a mixture of miller light and malt liquor, and as an ice brew thats practically what it is. There is a strong grain and corn taste to it, but its not offensive. Don't let it get warm though or you will get some bad tastes. Carbonation is a bit high for my taste, but not absurd. For what it is it's pretty good and I find myself actually enjoying them."

"Milwaukee's Best Ice Brewed by the Miller. This brew has an Abv of 5.9. This beer pours out of the can a nice amber color with a white head. The taste is that of an American style lager and malt liquor. It is right in the middle of the two. The beer goes down ok for being a higher abv, than other brews on the market. Nothing bad but nothing special . Overall I give this brew a 3 out of 5."
""
""
""
"Overall: Overall, this beer is certainly nothing to write home about. It's a party beer, for sure- a cheap option that you can buy massive quantities of for little money. I got a 32oz can for $1.70 and used it to wash down eight chili cheese dogs. It did it's job, and in a great way. I would certainly consider this for a college kegger."
""
""
""
"With that said, semi-sharp hop smell, bitey but smooth hoppy mouthfeel. No tracing in my glass when I poured it out of a can. Appearance is a boring typical gold color, (doesn't bother me though)"

"ive got to give this credit, its cheap and it cuts to the point. at 5.9%abv its kinda noticable but goes down good. you can smell the grains/malt and the hint of alcohol. head is soapy and leaves decent lacing?!?! i know lacing? really. i will give it a full swallow beer in my honest opinion. It will get you where you want to go."

"This beer was surprisingly good for a cheap get drunk kinda beer. It has a clear amber red appearance. there is a this malt smell. It has a malty taste with a dry aftertaste. It is slightly skunky at the end. It goes down pretty hard since it is pretty volatile."

"I've had worse, but not much worse. The corniness seems to come out of this more than other AAL's I've had. The trace of alcohol in the flavor/aroma confuses me. The flavor is too heavy on the corn. At $1.49 for a 24oz can it's what you'd expect... shitty quality, but it IS pretty drinkable. Probably wouldn't bother with this one again... though I will say that the price is hard to beat for the ABV. I'd rather have this over a Bud Light or mostly any other light beer, for sure."

"For the price, you can't really go wrong. Very clear appearance, nominal aroma, with the faintest hint of malt and alcohol. A very crisp taste, you can taste the alcohol, which for an ice beer, I suppose you are hoping for. A classic drink of the college elite."
""
""
"TAste : prett crisp with a light body some hops. Alcohol comes up on your tongue. It is not bad for an ice beer at $6.99 at 12-pack but does not up to par stick with Trader Joes cheap beer."

"Miller Milwaukee's Best Ice ---2/5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall (2.5): It’s a light-bodied, underpowered AAL. What did you expect, going into it? I certainly didn’t have high expectations but frankly was blown away by the appearance, if nothing else. Everything else was unimpressive, at best. RIDE THE BEAST."
"Overall this beer is great to get drunk and have a party with, campfire, or just by yourself watching UK dominate at bball!"

"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do understand brewing, but there are times when you want cheap beer and lots of it -- like at keg parties."
""
"Bottom line is, the people that give this beer BAD reviews won't know what their missing until it's gone. Sure, I enjoy a ""good"" tasting beer occasionally... but I don't want the BEST to dissappear because a bunch of reviewers felt like talking smack about a beer that they didn't even understand. It's good, potent, and CHEAP. And it doesn't taste too bad either. I just mentioned FOUR positive things, and there is no disputing any of them. Keep this on the market, and I'll keep buying it. I only drink the BEST."
""
""
""
"Its good to buy if youre having people you dont like over that forgot to byob or the alcohound bros are over and you dont want to spend a fortune as the provider of beer for the party....it has enough alcohol to kick their asses and leave them with a hangover bad enough to make them think twice before they mess with the Beast again....unless theyre hardcore bastards...then they probably drink this on the reg."
"It's a nice can of beer. Very distinctive. It has a good head and good carbonation. Is it Guinness? No. Is there a better beer you can buy for 50 cents a can? No. Does it fit the parameters? Yes. 5.9% alcohol and 144 calories. It's like drinking two beers for one. Two cans of light beer are about 150 calories and will probably run you about $1.50 and you'll still only get about 6.0% alcohol total. If you buy the 30 pack it'll last you a month. I'm disappointed that othe reviewers don't see the value of this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Could do worse but also could do better."
"For the record, I believe that Miller changed the recipe on this beer when they switched to the current label circa 2010. I emailed Miller and they said there was no change, but other beers of the same ilk have left the same impression on me in similar circumstances."
""
""
""
"Not sure what the appeal of this one is; it seems like it should have a higher ABV. Still, I finished the can.."
"Me and 2 of my friends were recently sitting around having a slow night so we decide to go on over to the good ole liquor store and pick up a 30 pack of this for only $14. So we all crack one open, With no smell to speak of, A decent taste, along with a decent mouthfeel. As we tear through the 30 pack we all start to get drunk...At a fast pace. If there is one thing this beer is good at it is getting people SMASHED. Seriously, a 30 pack of this could get 6 or 7 lightweights smashed off of their ass. No, It isn't particularly good tasting, But I'm not a beer snob. Pick up a few cases for a party of 15, And I can guarantee you that everybody will be wasted by the time it is gone."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's not my fav for the cheep lager category. Amongst Milwalkee's best brands, I prefer the light. It's funny to even have a preference on this sort of beer, but hey, back in the day we drank a lot of this stuff. It's good for what it's good for, cheep beer, very cheep. This one is fine in that respect."

"I'm not entirely sure how I drank so much of this in college. It's not awful, but it's not good. I wouldn't make a habit of picking this up."
""
""
"It tasted just like it smelled. It had a very nice old man beer flavour. That classic ""bad beer"" taste. It may have been a little over the top and it was surprisingly bad to pair with hot dogs, probably because it was a bit too boozy for that. But it really wasn't too bad. The taste might have been a little too ""bold," but often times I like that in an adjunct lager. I don't know why this is rated so badly. It's got a good, classic taste to it. It's not tasteless or overly carbonated or starch or chemically. It just tastes like a good strong, old fashioned beer. Like an adjunct lager should. Decent stuff. Very...decent."
""
""
""
""

"Beast ice. Is what it is. This one pours from the frat house's keg light golden copper (darker than the light) and lots of foam on top. Aroma is heavy skunk and stale corn. Flavor goes on the pattern with solid Skunky Beast with extra skunk flavor. Blah. Not worth drinking to tick, but had to be sure to tick all my college mistakes."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is far from a good beer, and even pretty far from a decent macro lager. That said, it's surprisingly a lot better than its brother, Milwaukee's Best Premium. And at 5.9%, I can see now why it was my unemployment beer of choice all those years ago."

"My friends always give me a hard time for getting this compared to their ""light"" versions of beers, but in my opinion, they all suck, so I just go for the cheapest and most alcoholic, when I'm doing that kind of thing. It might take some getting used to, but it's definitely a good choice in those situations. Otherwise, there should be no reason to even consider drinking this beer. Any other style of beer is better than these American macro-brews."
"O: 2.5"
"This beer has an absolutely fantastic head in a giant mug. Honey colored clear body. Head retention is decent. Adjuncts in the smell and taste derail what was shaping up to be a good experience. Smells very slightly skunked. Pale malts and an odd sweetness in the aftertaste, probably from adjuncts. Mouthfeel would be better with a little more carbonation, but that's not that big of a deal."
"O: It is what it is."
"Taste is bland as well, with a metallic carbonated feel and watery aftertaste. This is a favorite among college students because of its relatively high alcohol content that gets you drunk rather quickly. In the event that you are brave enough and decide to try this make sure you drink it cold and quickly because like other cheap beers it has an horrible taste and feel when it's warm."
"This was my staple beer as an underage drinker. It was cheap and got you smashed. I guess it serves a purpose, although there are other ice beers that have a smoother, more tolerable flavor."
"It is what it is and it gets the job done. The job being inebriation."
"Can't help but feel like the metallic aftertase is imparted by the can. Probably still leans above average for an ice adjunct though."
"Milwaukee's Beast is a great beer if you just want to play a ton of beer pong on the cheap and get hammered at the same time. When I first started drinking, this was my favorite beer. These can be drank fast fairly easily and they'll send you on your way when you wrap up a twelve pack."
"Pours a clean/clear yellow color, nice carbonation, a surprising two-finger white foamy head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is slightly malty, with some grain/rice notes. The taste is slightly sweet, slightly malty, ricy/grainy. Light Body. Overall not bad, for a hot day would not be too bad, but would not buy again."
"Ah, the Yeti. Perfect for the times when it's all about becoming intoxicated as cheaply as possible. The kind of beer that should only be consumed from large containers. Aromas of crisp grass and sweet vegetables. Sometimes it has a sweet, malty flavor; sometimes it tastes dry and grainy; sometimes it tastes like candy. There's usually a slight metallic aftertaste. It never tastes bad, though. I reach for the Beast Ice whenever the urge arises to sit on my porch and drink a 40 on a hot afternoon."
"I recommend trying it. What the hell? You don't have much to lose, and you might just find an overlooked gem - to your taste buds anyway. And who cares what any body else tastebuds say?"
"My father drinks this shit like water so I finally grabbed a sip and found out what she is all about. Pours that typical yellow straw color with a thick white head and no lacing. Smells of corn and some grain. Tastes grainy and musty, with a little sweetcorn in there. Mouthfeel is average with a heavy carbonation. Overall it isn't the worst thing ever."
"D - Not much of a beer overall, but good for a tight budget. I would drink it in a pinch during a Carolina Panthers game, but certainly not while watching the Packers in the playoffs."
"drinkability - I can drink a few of these. Its not too terrible of a taste and it gets you drunk fast for cheap. The next morning hangover sucks. I will probably steer clear of this one from now on."
"Drinkability is decent, excitement is missing"
"24 ounce can, best by June 13, 2011. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is sweet malt, cooked corn and some grain. It's a weak aroma, not much to it at all. Taste is similar to the aroma (however the taste isn't weak), but there's also a slight metallic taste that I notice. With that being said, it doesn't taste awful. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's a bit watery with a decent amount of carbonation. Drinkability is a little below average. I don't think it's a horrible beer, but it's certainly not good, either. For $1.19 a can, I can't really complain at all. If I wanted something cheap to drink just to get drunk with, Beast Ice isn't a bad choice."
"Don't get me wrong, this not a premium brew by any means; but it is both a good ""sharing beer"" and a good drinking for the heck of it beer while tooling around the house doing chores or unwinding at the end of a long day."
"it goes down very easy, but i definatly wouldnt want another...ever. tastes so similar to practically every adjunct lager."
"Pours a super-clear, pale golden yellow. Many fast carb trailers and a small-bubbled white head (soon a coating) that *gasp* sticks to the glass! Looks above average, imo. Not much as far as aromas go. Some huskness and a bit of green bitterness. Taste is pretty much the same, some sour, green apple-like qualities sit on top of a light grain base. Finishes sour and medicinal, but it's not too extraordinary. Feel is a bit carbonated, thin, and astringent. Drinkability a notch below average. ""Bleh"" beer, but my 24 oz can was $0.99!"
"Milwaukee's BEAST Ice from a 12oz can into 16oz pint. Pours light golden, pretty much just like any other BMC adjunct, small foamy head that recedes rather quickly, minimal lacing left behind. Smells lightly of steamed vegetables, grains, slightly corny, and a small hint of alcohol. Tastes fairly decent with notes of sweet malt, grains and once again steamed veggies. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, I find this to be a great lawnmowing beer on a hot day. Overall Ive always liked this beer, considering the price of $15.49, availability, and reputation. I have alot of pricey brews in my cellar, but I always keep a few 30 case's of this around for good measure!"
"I poured into a pint glass to two inches of white head. This beer is straw colored. The smell is sweet and grassy. The taste is sweet up front and finishes with a bitter alcohol taste. It is very watery. This is just a bad, bad beer. Under no circumstances will I purchase this beer again. I've been dreading it since I had the lapse in judgement and bought it."
"AWFUL. This 'beer' just smells from moldly boiled rice and distilled alcohol. Pale yellowish color, no head no lacing. Makes me wonder why I am drinking this, and who would buy this. The flavor is mostly of the bitter moldy rice. AVOID!!! unless your aying beer pong"
"Bought this on impulse because it was on sale...it has a get-drunk-quick taste to it and (relatedly) advertises its ABV on the outside of the 12-pack. Not really worth a try unless you are hell bent to try everything. I'm no elitist (see my reviews), but it's sad that major brewers need to stoop to conquer by going for the lowest rung on the ladder."
"D- If you are a poor bastard like me and you wanna get drunk for cheap and smoke too then this is your beer."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can AUG0910-CO8011731. I sampled it on August 29, 2010 so I don't know if this can is expired or freshly brewed.The pour is full of bubbly carbonation with a well-filtered pale yellow and a quick lasting fizzy white head the disappears with a poof after a few seconds. Unlike many Miller-brewed macros this one is clearly missing the metallic, grain alcohol scent. In fact I found the aroma to be a mildly enticing mashed maltiness full of fresh-cut hay and grapefruit. The taste also has a better than expected maltiness with a slight hoppiness around the edges. I rate it a bit better than the current average."
"Drink this one as cold as you can get it because as it starts to warm up the corn flavor gets even stronger and the alcohol begins to show. Glad they sell this in single cans, cause as a sixer, 5 of them would be drain pour."
"Pours nicely out of the can, seeing I can't find it in a bottle...don't even know if it comes that way. Not a lot of head and little lasting power. Light lacing around my mug that does cling to the side of the mug. The color is a medium light amber rating a 7 on the SRM chart. Smells like malt and corn, a little on the musty side. Quite bland on the tongue and palette...not a lot of zip. Has a bit of a bite and a harshness that gets your attention. Oooo but the real fruit of the matter the buzz of the alcohol hits you quickly. Something about the harshness and buzz that gives it a reserved corner in my fridge. Now for the availability and the price. Here is where this beer shines. I like the taste....it grows on you. If the flavor is not quite to your liking....have a couple of your choice brews and then have these. Talk about getting a bang for the buck, this is where it is at. 5.9 percent of the thing we drink beer for at less than $.50 a 12oz...can't see where you can go wrong. The Beast is like a staple of beer in my place. This is a real party beer, good for those who don't want to shell out a lot of green for a good time. And those who come for the free ride...beggar's can't be choosers."
"overall not the worst one at all, i actually could see someone drinking this, maybe, possibly."
"I try to give beers like this a chance, but this was nothing special, even in the macro ice department. Stuff like this had at parties is why people say they don't like beer."
"Poured into 10oz glass. Poured a clean, clear yellow with a fluffy white head that dissipated at about the same rate as a 7-Up. A slightly sweet scent is what is most noticeable. The taste was unremarkable and just short of nasty. The body was thin and watery. Drinkability was, lets just say, difficult. But still this beer was better than the Granville Island Pumpkin Beer."
"It smells like it tastes, a little alcohol and corn, just a hint of metal. No hops or malt jumps out. Also smells and tastes kind of sour. Mouthfeel is watery, overcarbonated. Not very enjoyable to drink."
"Feels typically light, even for a beer of this alcohol content. Carbonation is spot on, making this easy to drink, though the temperature should be appropriate or this swill will soon become undrinkable."
"RJT"
"Quite possibly the worst beer I've ever had in my entire life...only drank it at the worst of times in college because of the higher ABV and cheapness."
"Taste is sweet cardboardy grains with plenty of corn adjunct flavor to go around. Has a bit more body and flavor than the regular Milwaukee's Best, whether that is a good thing or not is debatable. Mouthfeel is somewhere between an adjunct lager and a malt liquor. There is some detectable bitterness on the finish, probably a combo of the husky grains and mild hops. Overall it is not too bad, pretty average macro swill here but there are certainly worse out there. The humongous can is still trippin' me out!"
"D- Again, made to be drank in large quantities. For that it receives a good score because it is out there for that soul reason."
"Overall, this beer is one that can be drank a case at a time, like most lagers. That hasn't been my style for quite some time, but for tonight, and for what it's worth, the Beast has been a pretty decent trip to memory lane."
"Well, I guess this ranks up there with Icehouse. I mean, there's a bit of a metallic taste underneath the corn. It's not bad though. Perhaps it would be better out of the bottle. This beer would probably be quite nice on tap. Pretty heavy carbonation. It's got the higher abv which is the whole point but I think one's money would be better spent on a Steel Reserve. That's better beer with more alcohol."
"A clear pale golden color pour with a two finger fizzy white head , high carbonation. Aroma is lightly sweet and slightly corny with little or no hops present. Flavor is much the same as the aroma a littly corny with a slight hint of alcohol in the finish but nothing too offensive. Light body woth a crisp clean mouthfeel . Very drinkable and not too bad for the price and what it is ."
"I split a can of Beast Ice, time to review. Pours a pale gold color with a thin white head. No lace. Not much smell, some cooked corn, and small amounts of hops and malt. Not impressive. Mostly cooked corn in the flavor, with very small amounts of malt and hops. Not a pleasant flavor at all. Thin and watery mouthfeel, not much else to say. Not drinkable either."
"Pours to a thin white head that almost completely disappears and pale gold color. Aroma is very much cooked corn and a faint hint of malt and hops, believe it or not. Flavor is a sweetish mixture of corn flakes, and a bit of alcohol aftertaste. the 5.9% abv really asserts itself. Generous CO2 as expected. I am noticing a buildup of harsh metallic and vegetable flavors and rough mouthfeel as I drink... not good."
"This beer gets the bottom of the barrel for me. Its the only beer that I actually got a headache while I was drinking it. I would avoid it at all costs and you can certainly get better beers at the same price range. I only had this beer once but that was enough for me. A nice substitute would be ...well anything would be a step up."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a gold color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some corn, not a lot there. Taste is crisp with some notes of corn, not a whole lot of flavor. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this makes for a mediocre beer."
"D: keep it ice cold and these brews move better. As mine warms the flavor and taste buds gather less and less flavors, is that even possible? Down any road, this beer is drinkable, but in all honesty I reach for other brews when the wallet is tight and when looking for the style...which is rare"
" Jizack FH"
"D: Not nearly as bad as Milwaukee's Best ""regular"". Not good, but you could do worse for such an extremely cheap price tag. It's adjuncty and a bit boozy, but it never ventures into the sickly-sweet malt liquor territory, which is a plus. I've had worse..."
"Per style, this is not a bad brew. Not too good either - just middle of the road. Good enough for a cheap lawnmower beer with a bit of a kick, if that's what you're looking for."
"The mouth is very thin and weak. Not bite at all. This is horrible. Flavor is of weak corn and mellow lemon. There is nothing to this at all. I wasn't expecting much, but this still found a way to leave me wanting. Ugh. Avoid."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Well I got to say, this beer is not that bad at all, which really surprised me because I got this once before and noticed lots of metallic twang, this time around, not at all! It is what it is, which is to say cheap, easy drinking, low on cash have a good time kind of beer. I actually prefer this over Natty Ice, extremely drinkable, one could drink as many as wanted no problem. It's no Stone Ale, or something like that, but it doesn't suck, low on cash, tired of drinking Malt Liquor, this is the beer to buy. Cheers!"
"My streak of terrible macro pop continues. This pours a pale straw color with a thin white head. Nose has grainy hops and corn. Taste is on the rough side. Needs more water to mellow out the stale ingredients. Thin body is way over carbonated and lacks any depth."
"D: I think this qualifies as the first ""drinkable college frat house beer"" that I can think of. If that isn't an oxymoron to begin with."
"I kept getting a finger's worth of rocky, bone-white head, but the retention was so poor that it kept collapsing like a souffle with someone banging the oven door shut. Nose had an odd scent, not really lager-like, but more sharp with alcohol than subdued. I do not mean to make it sound ""hot", however. Instead, it was simply more alcohol-forward. Mouthfeel was medium with a very light flavor. I wish that I could quantify that better, but it was simply a light, fluffy flavor that had all of the impact of a marshmallow on a trampoline on my taste buds. The finish was equally light and airy. Let's call this damning with faint praise."
"As a poor college student I bought this beer for drinking games and expected nothing. It was disappointing. This beer is so bad that I expected nothing from it but it still managed to disappoint. Drank from the can but I would assume it looked like fizzy swamp water because that is what it tasted like. The smell left nothing to be desired but it could have probably been worse. The taste was, as I said earlier, like fizzy swamp water. This is the epitome of piss beer. In fact I would bet that this beer is kidney filtered through the homeless of Milwaukee. Is it Miller time? Not if Beast Ice is involved."
"Overall, a typical macro. Something college kids are more likely to get because of the ice (5.9%). Nothing I'd every buy."
"Some ethanol note was detected for the first taste or two."
"(rated May 26, 2007)"
"Pours a clear, pale yellow with short head and no retention or lacing. Smells of an adjunct lager. Definitely fits the style, as sad as that is. Crisp feel with low carbonation. Weak body and tastes mostly of adjunct. Overall, not a beer for anything but getting smashed."
"It is a bland beer as a whole. It has sweet adjunct aroma. There is a lot of malt in the aroma almost like malt liquor. It has a very watery feel to it. The flavor is also watery and sweet with virtually no bitterness at all. The can states the use of ""quality hops"" I just want to know what quality. There was not much for bubbles in the body but there was a lot of head and lace. It is a good party beer and that is about it."
"Though I am only a ripe 22 years of age I have probably have at least 90% of the beer types known to man. Then there was ""Beast Ice"" aka Milwaukee's Best Ice. Living up to it's faithful name this beer is quite a beast....and I do mean that in the worst way possible. It's so bad it doesn't even deserve a review....try one and you'll know what I mean."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a thin body. The carbonation works well with the beer and may actually make the beer better. This is just another pound as fast as you can beer. Not a whole lot going on here."
"Another college town beer that is more of a tool for getting drunk than a real beer. Ice beer so it's high in alcohol and low in taste. Very pale and little to no head retention. The aroma is non existent. No good characteristics for this bland flavorless concoction. Stay clear of this one. -Dale"
"Why I like this...I cannot tell you. But I do. It is very drinkable for a cheap beer. Perhaps it's the 'ice brewing' (aka extra alcohol) that makes this one extra drinkable. Very sweet, very corn-tasting. Would rather drink this than other cheap brews."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with big billowy head that dissipates into nothing almost immediately. Smell is quite non-existant, taste is actually non-offensive, very light tasting to be truthful, no personality but not god-awful. Mouthfeel is not quite as thin as I had expected, easy on the palate. Drinkability is high due to the easy going nature of this beer. It's weak, flavorless and watery but at the same time has high ABV and is non-offensive. A good broke-mans party beer."
"Drinkability is very very low. I refuse to drink this beer anymore, even when it's free and in copious quantities. I'd much rather pay a bit extra and upgrade to Miller Lite or almost any of the other products that Miller brews."
"This beer poured a translucent yellow with a lot of visible carbonation and a single-finger head that didn't last long. The smell is fairly faint with some whiffs of malt and maybe some corn adjunct. The taste is a bit of malt up front with some barely perceptible hops and a little bit of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is watery with some pretty aggressive carbonation. This beer is basically made to be drank in large quantities by already inebriated college kids and hobos. I wouldn't get this beer if you can afford anything else, but if you're seriously considering buying this beer then I doubt you're really looking for something tasty. Bottoms up and hold out for your next college loan check."
"The label states Ice brewed from th finest quality malted barley, selected grains and choicest hops. pours a honey bright golden hue with a large overly carbonated white head dwindles as quick as it rises. Lacing is left behind thin and scant. Aromatics smells like beer, grainy offness slightly metallics. A blend of pale malts and assorted grains ie corn and rice. Not much alcohol on the nose even thought it's an ice brew it comes out at 5.9% just under the legal limit of some of the archaic states with beer laws like WV. Flavor unremarkable but yet a horrible chemical metallic offness comes across the palate with DME sweetness after a few sips I'm certain I'm not going to finish off a whole 24oz can. I will not waste anymore vibrant liver cells on this beer, drain pour. Mouthfeel is thin watery textured with carbonation so high it makes it hard to swallow, shitty industrial beer at it's worst. Drinkability terrible."
"D - This is a pretty boring beer, but it's still not that bad. Considering most macros, and further more, American ""ICE"" beers, this one is a notch above the rest."
"D - For the price ($5 for a 12 pack at the gas station), this is eminently drinkable for someone on a budget. This straddles the line between over-boozed malt liquor and watery low-abv macro brews."
"Pours a pale golden color and has a decent head retention with a nice lace. Smell is mostly corn, but I can detect a hint of malt. Goes down pretty and is very dry with basically no bitterness. Like the smell, the taste is mostly corn, but does have that ice flavor to it. I don't care for adjunct lagers very much, but rating this with the style in mind, it is a pretty good beer."
"Ahh...the Beast. For what it cost many a cans were devoured by myself and my roomies back in the day. Of the cheap ice beers this one isn't that bad. It has that pale yellow pee look and that bad grainy smell. But the taste improves after the first few sips (perhaps there is rubbing alcohol in there and it sterilizes the tongue) and the body is almost medium. There are some malts and sweet notes of rice and corn to taste, which is surprising for a cheap American macro ice. I wouldn't drink this again if it were offered to me (even if it made me appear rude) but it is not a horrible pickup."
"Swill."
"twelve ounce aluminum can- color of pale yellow , with a frothy white head - nose of grass, sweet, grass, lemon, white rice, and dry  taste of artificially sweet, sour, and rice- body is light, and oily, and with medium high carbonation  aftertaste of sweet, and bad vegetation"
"The beer LOOKS ok. Dark gold with a full soapy head. But I think appearance is its only strongpoint. It smells like metal and cheap ingredients. Old musty malt and wet hay. It tastes like any cheap malt liquor to me. St. Ides or Olde English or any type of cheap higher alcohol 40oz. I used to buy when I was young and broke. Kind of heavy and not very pleasant to drink. I bought a 40oz. for $1.89 just for the hell of it. I probably won't again."
"Clearly not the best beer option, but I can make this work. The 5.9% ABV & price tag deserve mention."
"If I want something that taste good, I buy Blue Moon. Normally I buy Busch or Budweiser for a nights worth of drinking. When I'm broke, I buy Beast Ice. Less than six bucks for a 12 pack here. To tell you the truth, the reason I don't buy it more is because at 5.9% ABV I tend to regret the night before."
"This, unfortunately, was the beer I ""grew up"" on. My stepdad drank this and I had more of these than I'd like to admit. Without a doubt, the worst beer I've ever had, even comparing to other cheap macros. The higher alcohol content isn't enough to make this worthwhile. The taste is just horrible...I cringe just thinking about it. The only way to even attempt to drink this is ICE cold and FAST. Even then it is quite putrid. Let it warm even a couple of degrees and you are in for a whole mouthful of funk. Avoid at all costs. There are better cheap macros to get you drunk."
"I bought this for two reasons. One, it was $11.99 for a 30 Pack. Two, it's 5.9% ABV. If you want to get drunk and you don't care about taste, appearance, smell, having a horrible hangover and feeling like crap for 24 hours, then this is the beer for you. Otherwise, cough up a few extra dollars and get something that doesn't taste like the water that builds up at the bottom of a trash can."
"Quaffed a few of these on the golf course recently. I guess I was drawn in by the 5.9% ABV and the price was certainly right. Pale straw in appearance. No noticeable smell. Slightly sweet in taste, not bad, but not great. Overall, not a bad macro choice on a hot day. Provided ample refreshment and booze on the golf course."
"Eric"
"Cheap."
"Next."
"Milwaukee's Best Ice has nothing to be ashamed of. Well... maybe it does, but not in the context of this hard-fought competition it doesn't. Although it falls just a wee bit short in the flavor department, it's a beer that I could see myself drinking in a pinch. Ice-cold of course. Not a bad showing Miller. Your beer is still clearly superior to most of what comes out of St. Louis."
"For $10.99 a thirty pack, this beer is worth every penny spent. It is very economical and some might say you get what you pay for, but for a cheap macro, its fairly good. Definitely suitable for college students. I recommend this beer to anyone with only a few dollars and needs to pick up something that isn't that bad."
"overall this isnt a bad beer for a macro ice strange flavor hints of alcohol in the flavor but i think this is a cheap beer and i drank a lot of it before i turned 21"
"24 ounce tall oil can. Light golden in color, fizzy and sizzling head that is wiped out rather quickly. Pasty malts and tender grainy hops on the nose, for the style...no complaints here. Fizzy carbonated malt based palate; light cooked veggies with a severe warming alcohol backbone. Palate turns grainy, yet cleansed with slender corn flavorings. Sweet metallic/acidic finsh, for the style not too bad, for the beer advocate, worth passing up."
"Steve says that the Beast ""sucks...no excuse for a beer."" I can buy that. But since I was low on funds today, about all I could afford was Milwaukee's Best Ice. At a whopping 5.9% alcohol by volume, I figured that after two or three I could forget what I was drinking anyway. I was also raised to believe there is some good in all people and all things. Well, this swill really put my upbringing to the test. Sure, I got drunk. But getting drunk with MB Ice is like making a million dollars as a proctologist for Rosie O'donnell...you might reach your goal, but the journey is far too unpleasant for most. I give this beer two mugs only because being ice-brewed gives it more of a punch, but by God I'm working overtime next week so I can afford something good."
"I rate the drinkability low because I couldn't even finish a glass (and there's still more in the can). It may be very drinkable if you're just looking to pound back a few and get fucked up, and if you also don't care what your beer actually tastes like. But I can't consider this drinkable in any way. This is Milwaukee's best??? I'm sure the city has something better to offer than this swill."
"This beer though not great is probaly the best ""bang for your buck"" that you can find. A highly corny taste with a powerful punch and low cost makes this the beer of choice for those looking for a quick buzz at a low cost.Very similar to ""natty ice""."
"Yes, I've been slumming a bit lately. Poured out of a 24 oz can into a styrofoam cup (I know, I know. . .). The head was impressive, though it quickly dissipated into a dull yellow. It smelled of corn with a hint of the 5.9% alcohol. The taste was standard macro ice fare; a good, beer-tasting beginning, denegrating to strong metallic and alcohol flavors on the finish. It's not a horrible beer, and not a bad accompaniment to tailgating or grilling burgers, but Milwaukee's Best Ice isn't a beer to savor."
"Hey ya know I'd say this si the benchmark for macro Ice beers. It's got the flavor of Mil's Best and not only adds the extra alcohol but I think does a better job of masking the alcohol than keystone Ice and Icehouse, for example. Serve Ice cold!! My recipe for success would be to let freeze in cooler then place in freezer 5 minutes before consuming; has a lower freezing point than normal beer because of the extra alcohol."
"Pours out a brassy gold with a thin ring of bubbles up top and a lot of carbonation in the body. Smells like alcohol, grains, and cooked vegetables. This does have a sickening alcohol, sweetness, corn, and grain quality to it, but there is a bit of malt that shines through at the end, so I give it kudos on that note. Mouthfeel is syrupy, slick, and prickly with bubbles. Just sticks to my tongue. I hate this, and I will never buy this again. High gravity malt liquor is easier going down. WTF, Miller?"
"Having this after the Lucky Number might have made me respect it more than I would normally. Clear gold color with a smallish fizzy head. Head dies but good amount of bubbles rise. Smell is not too much but more of a macro beer smell. Taste isn't too bad. Not really any off flavors. A touch of hops combine with the adjunct malts making it not so nasty sweet like most cheaper beers are. Not too much flavor, just a pale malt flavor with a slightly bitter counterpart. Body is lighter, alcohol is noticeable on the tongue but doesn't burn. Fairly drinkable really. Good for its price and style."
"Okay so my candian friends had some of this stuff, and I had heard stories of the beast before, so I was weary. I was thinking 5.9 ice beer, and remembering the horrid taste of labatts ice. So I cracked one open, I smelt hints of corn and malt, and I must say it wasn't bad at all. Not a great beer by any means, but hey for the money its defiinetly worth a try. Great bargain beer and at 5.9 it gets you hammered."
"On the bright side, if you are poor and want to get drunk, this doesn't taste any worse than regular Milwaukee's Best and it does the job faster."
"Milwaukee's Best Ice pours a pale yellow with a thick white head from a sixteen ounce can. Very mild, adjunct aromas. Tastes like corn, some metallic flavor as well. Pretty drinkable for a cheap ice beer. Decent and fairly cheap for lawnmower beer, otherwise forget it."
""
"Not bad for the style. It may be the best beer I have had in a 24 oz. can. If you want something that is nonoffensive and easy to get drunk off of, you may want to check this out."
"Why I even tried this? To get drunk, of course. Milwaukee's Best Ice was very appealing to the poor man's budget with 5.9% alcohol. Unfortunatley, the taste was absolutley horrid. I would drink Icehouse over this. When it's ice cold, it isn't completely wretched, but like many beers of this style, when it even thinks about warming up, it's like drinking a mixture of aluminum and carpet cleaner. AVOID."
"I thought I was done with the 'Beast' and it's line of beers from my days in college. Guess it was either nostalgia or the fact that I am flat broke, but I bought a case of this last night. I tried one and about 2/3 of the way through it I poured it out. Tonight I am on a mission. After almost finishing my second one, it is getting less and less painful to pour this down the ol' gullet. In fact, it doesn't taste that bad at all. It doesn't taste that great either. Settle on the stomach a little heavy though. This'll do b/c it seems like it gets on you quick with a buzz. If I had my druthers(and more money) I would have bought something much better, but at 10 dollars a case, you can't beat it for when you looking to get drunk on a budget."
"What is there basically to say besides that it is a party beer. This is the kind of beer that is for college kids on a low budget. Even thought he commercials beg to differ and say its a real mans beer. Not true. The only reason that the drinkability is at a 2.5 is because once you drink a few then there is really no need to worry aobut taste. The good hting about this beer is that it has a much more sharp taste than its sister beer milwaukee's best light."
"The flavor is not far from what the nose suggest, but there is a little more malt than you might expect. It's pretty well balanced by a firm bitterness, and it's certainly not sweet like a malt liquor. The generic hops return though, only lending a smear of muddled flavor where there could be so much more to give it interest. And the alcohol is noticeable, which is odd, as it's only 5.9% by volume."
"It's fairly crisp and smooth, but gets watered down the warmer it gets. Taste and smell make this much harder to drink than any other american macro- I'd normally rank much higher for drinkability - but this really did almost make me feel sick. Even regular olde Milwaukee's Beast is much better"
"Poured a pale yellow clor with initially monstrous white puffy head that was very quickly gone. Smell is so light as to be virtually nonexistent, with a mild sweet malt present and no hops found. Taste is very light, but some alcohol notes to be tasted. Finishe is refreshing as long as the beer is cold, but as it warms it becomes less enticing. OK beer, but a bit too strong as a spacer."
"D: I'll give this beer a good score in this category simply because this style is made to be drinkable. However, comparing it to other macros, I still consider it quite ""poundable"". Given the alcohol content, the drinkability of a light beer and the low price, it's the perfect buzz-maintainer once you’re too hammered to care about what you taste."
"Drinkability... well, for a quick buzz, it's OK, but I'd rather go for a Steel Reserve. I think it tastes better, and with a higher ABV it's preferable. I don't think I'd get this again unless I was really in a fix and needed the buzz."
"This is my first macro in quite a while, even though I bought this for giggles, this is an honest review of the beer itself, I strive for this in any beer that I try.Pale yellow color, smell is a weird sugary sweet. Taste is flat, a bit sweet, no hops, very dull. Thin mouthfeel. I know why I drink craft beer and not this stuff, it's useless for beer. I don't consider this real beer, I might throw the rest out since I bought it as a 40oz and I'm not trying to impress my hommies or anything. I only spent $1.50 on this but I feel bad for spending that much on it."
"Presentation: Packaged in a sixteen ounce aluminum can, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"This beer poured a clear, pale yellow.. standard macro lager/cheap beer color... A small head formed for a brief period, again, nothing exciting. Strong cheap beer smell, grain and corn with a little alcohol. The taste is kind of metallic, with grain and alcohol.. Nothing special, but not horrible either. Mouthfeel is OK, fairly watery. It's very drinkable, 24 ounces for .99 cents is a good value, and its stronger than Budweiser, but I'd avoid it if I had more money."
"Good clear pale apperance with bot much lace. The smell is surprisingly clean also. This tastes nothing like regular Milwaukee's Beast which is a good thing. it isn't pretty but it is crisp, cheap and gets you drunk. Watery mouthfeel. Fairly drinkable."
"Pours pale gold, crystal clear. A thin and bubbly one finger head remains for under 30 seconds with very weak lacing. The smell is weak for an Ice beer, corn and grain adjuncts with no hops present. the alcohol is finally percieved in the taste, but is not so strong that you can't still taste grain and aluminum. Still, not a bad flavor for its price. It's also very drinkable, the alcohol bite in the aftertaste drys up quickly, leaving a crisp mouthfeel despite low carbonation and a thicker body than you would expect in a macro. If you're a fan of good cheap beer, remember that the Milwaukee's best lineup is comparable to, and sometimes cheaper than your Miller High lifes and Pabst."
"Drinkability: Of the ice cheapies, this really isn't bad, and compared with Icehouse, or the tamer malts, for the price, I'd rather have a High Life. Still, okay if you want to get buzzed cheap."
"This is a cheap beer, at $12.02 after tax for a case it is the cheapest I can find in this area. I rate everything except drinkability at 3.0, because I don't take time to notice nit picky bullshit things like that. They don't matter. All that matters in a beer is if it gets you drunk. And drunk I am. 5.9% alc/vol. This is the only beer I drink. I go thru about 6 cans a day, many many more when I don't have to work in the monring (yes, I'm an alcoholic), and I find it exceptionally drinkable. If you are on a budget, or just don't give a shit about anything except getting wasted, this is the beer for you."
"I bought this for $5.99 a 30 pack due to a closeout at my store. Definatley a good beer to drink to quench your thirst. But it does seem to get you drunk pretty fast 5.9% abv. Everytime I drunk more than four of these I got a headache. I don't really mind the tast, grainy with just hints of malt.(seltzer water) I have never been so confused by what was so called beer. It just confuses me on how some business could make a beer that is this flavorless. I would recommend this to college student or a person on a extreme budget, other than that its good for nothing else."
" Well you get what you pay for here. A good appearance for .50 cents a pop. The six was three bucks. Not all that bad, if in a pinch."
"Take it easy boys and girls!"
"Save me... this is complete death in a can. Poured out to an average golden color, this brew hits the drinker with odors of alcohol and cooked hops. Carbonation was ok, but a touch on the ""lets add extra bubbles to cover up the flavor"" side. Flavor of alcohol and malt were most prevailant. Finished a bit dry and quickly informs the drinker that if they do not change brews, they will quickly have a headache from hell. Go with Shlitz Ice if you're looking for a sub premium priced Ice beer. Much better flavor, value, etc. etc. Not recommended."
"This is a terrible beer. The appearance is bizarre. It's the only beer I have seen with a yellow greenish color, like lemon gatorade. The smell is awful, like a used growler that hasn't been cleaned out. The taste doesn't really have any recognizable beer characteristics other than alcohol. It was difficult for me to finish this undrinkable beer. Stay away."
"Had (again with the shit beers) at my nieghboor's. You know, I enjoyed this even less than the light. Honesty, I can taste the alcohol so horribly. It's weird... 5.9% ABV and all I taste is alcohol. No grains, hops, nothing. This is sheer and utter crap."
"I hate beer that should have never been brewed in the first place. This is the perfect example. Pours almost crystal clear with no head and lots of fizzies. The aroma is almost non-existant. The taste is somewhat metalic and has a strong water overtone. A great beer for someone who is wandering the desert, other than that, bad times."
"I'd like to say this beer looks like crap seeings how it is the beast and all but it actually looks fairly decent with a golden color and a white head. Smell is almost nonexistant with a faint adjunct odor detected. Taste is very faint, with a grainy adjuct flavor that builds up in the finish. Very light bodied, not much different than water. Beer is lightly carbonated. Drinkability is good but so is water's. Not much going on in this beer but it has some alcohol to it and is actually not the worst ice beer I've ever had (not that it says much)."
"Medium straw colored, super size head that has decent staying power. collapses and then brings some nice lace, forget about everything you have been told about lace. Nose is grassy and soap like, some off scents. flavor is sugary and sweet grain is dominant but not much syrupiness. finish is long and sweet. Not real good, not real bad"
"Pours out a deep gold with a large white head. The head vanishes almost immediately despite the large number of carbonation bubbles. However, the residual laces with great gusto. The nose gives a scent of Saaz hops but intruded upon by the adjunct aroma. The taste is of the hops and adjuncts as well. The feel is medium with a good deal of crispness. Overall drinkability limited by the lack of real substance in the taste."
"A big white head settles to a 1/4 ince layer before nearly disappearing, but leaves decent lacing oddly enough. Light golden gently carbonated liquid. Sweet adjunct and grainy nose. Clean tasting, with a subtle weakly fruity taste in the background with some hop twang present. Finishes sweetish. A solid and decent cheap beer is what we have here."
"first things first, lets get this straight, this is a beer for someone wanting to get very drunk, for very cheap. 10 dollers for 30 beast ice's, and it's 5.9%, this beer really has nothing fantastic about it, skunky smelling, almost a transparent color, not a great taste, light in the mouth, about the only thing one can say about it is, it has a higher ABV than ice house, and it tastes just slightly better, well, maybe a lot better, but that really isn't saying much. if you are budgeting, and needing a drink, go for it, it's still more respectible than grabbing wild irish rose."
"had to get this to replace a keg that simply could not be procured (unfortunately the keg was going to be of saranac pale, which is far more acceptable). The appearances is light yellow with a huge head that is gone almost as quickly as i was able to pour it. The smell is light, but too sweet for what it is. Definately you can smell some corn, and al the rest is alcohol. taste is a bit of wheat, and some metalics, with an overriding salty alcoholicness. It goes down well i will admit and i find that this isnt actually a terrible choice when the choices are limited. plus, its extra alcohol, who can argue for a party?"
"Poured pale yellow-gold with a foamy white head that counterintuitively both prevented me from pouring the beer all at once in my glass, refusing to settle quick enough for me to continue pouring, and then all but disappearing once it was all in the glass. Maybe I should have left the last bit in the can if I'd known it was a head retention killer. Smell is corn with very little malt or hops. Sweetness is reminiscent of honey, almost, but mostly just creamed corn. The taste is non-descript, except for the corn flavor at the end. There is nothing exciting about this beer's taste. The mouthfeel is quick and relatively painless, that much can be said. Drinkable, but why torture yourself?"
"Drinkability  I performed this tasting over my sink, thinking that if I passed out the giant 24 ounce can would fall down in the drain where it belonged. But, all in all, this wasnt that bad. Hell, I might even finish this blue and silver bullet."
"Stay away from this brew. If your better off with drinking a light beer than this."
"Simply gross. An econimcal way to catch a buzz is all this is. Taste is skunky and alcoholic. Flavors are not natural for beer. Pale yellow in color, with head that is not impressive. Tastes just awful. Don't buy this swill, your tastebuds will thank you."
"As a younger man I regarded MBI to be the worst beer made, its not but its in the running."
"Good clear pale apperance with some lace, clean aroma with a hint of alcohol. Quite crisp with a light body, thin on the malt with extremely faint hops. Alcohol shows that it is there as there is not much to hind behind. Not too bad for an ice beer at $5.99 at 12-pack its a bargin."
" Dark gold, clear large fizzy white head with some stamina. Some metallic quality to taste. Very light flavor overall. Maybe a hint of alcohol and slightly bitter. HIghtly carbonated, some softness and rather watery. Unbelievably flavorless, even less than many light beers I've had."
"Ice cold and with a blocked nose this might be drinkable..but for 79 cents a 24 oz can i suppose you get what you pay for"
"The taste is evenly balanced but does not finish real well as the alcohol becomes evident and leaves you dry."
"Drink a few of these and don't even think about driving.  I only had two of these, and I could imagine the pain I'd be in if I had a 12-pack or even a 6-pack.  If you're at a party and this is all they have, by all means go for it, but don't drink this if you like good beer."
"already half in the bag, i started funneling these things. rank skunky odor and a rough flavor made it hard to drink any other way. this is just not right. i could make out the piss flavor while my taste buds were really sleeping if you know what i mean"
"Milwaukee's Best Ice, if that ice was cut from an outhouse. It is best real cold, left outside all night on November night. I perfer it with little chunks of ice swimming in it. Real bad beer, but a good way to get loaded."
"It stinks like corn and rubbing alcohol, and tastes very thin and highly alcoholic. Anyway, we got it for beer pong, and should do the job in getting people all druuunked up, despite the nastiness. I'll probably sneak away from it every now and then for Harpoon IPA."
"Surprisingly good for ""beast"". Light straw in color with fast rising bubbles and rich head. Almost no lace.  Slightly malt sweet flavor with metallic corn and cooked veggie flavor. Surprisingly, this works pretty well. Not a bad beer when drinking just to wet your whistle."
"Starts with plastic, then goes to a light corn with a hint of malt. Colour is a fair amber, looks are so misleading here. Some unpleasant sticky palatability, with a fair amount of carbonation. If you need this beer for effect, then go for it. HAZMAT (hazardous material) teams can be seen unloading this stuff from the beer trucks from time to time, Im sure. Once you get past the first few cans, every thing settles down except for the plastic taste, that never goes away completely."
"darker than your average lager, with a slight head.  smells like crap and the taste isn't much better.  it IS better than regular Beast, but what does that matter?   nice alcohol punch, some smoothness and a tiny bit of hop bite in the end.  a beer purely to get drunk fast.  not recommended."
"I cannot believe I drank Beast Ice. And, more than once. Was it good? No. Was it bad? No. This beer doesn't have that ""Miller"" taste like the rest of their products. Its a little darker (slightly) than I expected. There is some actual taste to this beer that for some reason I enjoyed it. Uneventful to say the least, but the gold standard of The Beast Lineup. Best consumed at hunting camps, with guys named Doug."
