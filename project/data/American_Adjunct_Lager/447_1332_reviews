"Overall- This brought me way back to my days in the Marines, ""Old Milwaukee"" beer tents out in the field.  It tasted better back then, but hey it isn't horrible now."

"I'm not a lager guy but if I don't have a choice and I have to pick one, I will pick this one"
"For the price ...actually not bad lol"
""
""
""
"Absolutely awful. The taste of Old Milwaukee is so repulsive, I would only drink it if the life of another human being depended on it. Worst. Macro. Ever."
"Very Similar to PBR. As with PBR, I'd say avoid bottles and go with cans. Cheers!"
""
"Could it get any worse!!!"
"Middle of the road AAL, have had worse."
""
"Good lawnmower type beer. Lite, crisp and refreshing."
""
""
"Overall (3.06) : Hey, it's not all that bad. It's a bottom shelf beer, sure, but I've had way way way way worse. For $8 a 12 pack, or $4 a 6 pack...it's a cheap beer and great with beef sticks (which I opted for as a combo, instead of buying a bar beer at $2 a pop while I went to waste $10 at the vid lot machine. Seemed much more economical to spend $4 on a six pack.)"

"Drank from the can. Can see light yellow some little lace. Smell is yeast and adjuncts. Dry smell. Taste is dry and yeasty and adjuncts. Almost like PBR but boozier to me. Makes my face hot fairly quickly. I like it as much as my go to PBR"

"Overall, I rated this in comparison with other adjunct lagers, and quite frankly this beer tastes as clean and refreshing as all the others at a cheaper price. This will be my cheap go-to beer when needed."

"Maybe this beer was not stored properly or was abused somehow? I was expecting more. This beer is pretty smooth. The appearance and aroma are inviting. But it just doesn't taste that good."

"Not bad brew very similar to PBR but not as good....still rather have an ice cold Old Mil than a Budweiser or Coors any day....Old Mil has decent hops for a cheap beer and it is excellent for mixing with stouts and porters to make cheap amber lagers. For $6.99 a 12 pack it is hard to beat and much better than it's main competitor on the shelf Milwaukee's Best. This beer actually won some awards back in the day so give it a break and evaluate it for what it is.... a cheap American Style beer...."

"Its not going to challenge or excite your tongue. But it dosn't bother mine at all. I think pbr is better but this one is better that high life in my opinion."

"Old Milwaukee beer is classic brew. It pours a golden Amber color. This brew has a little white head. Old Milwaukee has a sweet taste, it not bad. Mouth feel is that of an american style beer, nice and smooth. Over all I give this beer a 3 out of 5. it is nothing special but it is not a bad beer."

"Pale yellowish-amber color, clear with no cloudiness, lots of carbonation. Malty aromas, but not from barley- corn? rice? Tastes of sweet maltiness, can't really discern any hops. Feels robust, but the carbonation balances it out a bit. Look, this is just not a great beer...but, I had to go grab one and review it for a couple of reasons. (1) Takes me back to golfing with the boys in college, and (2) reminds me of my Grandfather, a man's man who took it to the Nazis back in '44 in a B-24, got shot down, and walked 200 miles to the Adriatic sea to be rescued."

"I typically wait to try mainstream American/Canadian adjunct lagers if they happen to show up at various social functions or restaurants where there are few other (better) beer options. Too fizzy and weak flavor-wise as a general rule, although these beers can be nostalgic and are great if you really are just in the mood to drink socially without constantly taking tasting notes or analyzing everything else going on with the brew. Old Milwaukee is very, very pale straw colored with the requisite level of mouth-numbing carbonation and white foam. Also classic is the muted, tenuous flavor profile and aroma. This example is corn-forward and fairly sweet, corn meal and boiled dough along with some subtle off-flavors (the sweetness tastes a bit artificial like aspartame) ... Chalky and dry body keeps the sweetness lower than in some other adjunct lagers but the corniness and cooked flavors do add a little nuance I suppose. Mellow and largely unoffensive."

"Typical american adjunct lager, straw color, no lacing, tastes like every other adjunct lager. Cheap but better than a light beer. Id recommend this if your going to a party and want to bring alot of it for cheap. this is a way to go! Its crisp/carbonated/ and you can drink alot of these before you feel it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : One is the best discounted American Adjunct Lagers out there. Old Milwaukee has that old school beer taste which you real can not find in many beers today."
""
""
""
"O: No surprises - this is pretty bad. If you dropped a shot glass of PBR into a cup of club soda, it'd be pretty close to Old Milwaukee."
""

"Not much difference between this macro and the others"

"O – This is a very cheap beer with a bad rep, and I would argue a bad rap as well. I think it is great for the price point, which is $3.99 for a sixer of pounders by me. That makes it just about the cheapest, not-on-sale beer I can buy. However, it is light years away from great or even good, and I would likely be telling a completely different tale if it wasn't just out of a cold fridge."

"It's a great beer to buy in bulk if you are supplying free beer for a BBQ or something."
""

""
""
"Well it says on the top of the can ""America's Best Tasting Beer."" If that was true, I'd move, now. This is one of those beers you should only drink if its free and even then, not always. It's your average watered down, nothing to it beer. Heavily carbonated. There's a hint of hoppiness which is nice but there's a weird sweet/metalic flavor that just shouldn't be there. It's a little malty and is drinkable. The bad tastes that are there aren't overbearing, but that's probably because simply everything about this beer is not overbearing. It smells like someone spilled beer on your couch three days ago, but to it's credit it also smells crisp and grassy, like a corn field. Aftertaste is nonexistent, which is nice, because as bad as this beer is, at least it doesn't stick around."

"Old Milwaukee from a can, poured into dimpled mug. Appearance is light yellow, fizzy with huge white head that dissapates quickly. Smell is harsh and grainy. Taste is smooth. Drinkability is very high. Mouthfeel is thin and a little watery. Old Milwaukee is a great lawnmower beer and one of my favorite cheap beers."
"It's a good beer, cheap price. If it's cold, it's very refreshing. I'll pick it up once in a while."

"and if i recall this beer won 5 gold medals from 2003 - 2007 at the great american beer festival?"
""
"Tastes like corn and water, just like all of the other unexciting American macrolagers. Surprisingly, the carbonation is somewhat subdued in comparison to other adjunct pale lagers, and I kind of wish it wasn't. Mouthfeel is incredibly slick. This is bad, but not horrible, especially for the price."
""
"Overall – Simple and highly drinkable with no highly offensive off flavors. With its cheap price, it makes for a decent party/session brew."
"Hoping to finish this Spelunky spree soon, as one can only take so much death before it starts to grate... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale sallow topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises corn, wheat, and light grass. The taste brings in more of the same, with some added sweet corn and some funkier wheat. The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty sad little adjunct lager, one that hardly seems suitable for drinking on its own without some effort (read: beer ping and the like). Oh well, back to dying pathetically and not learning from my mistakes...*drink*..."
""
"Why didnt I try this sooner. I guess I listened to the stereotypes about this beer. Picked up 2 6-packs of the 16 oz. variety at Wal-Mart in San Antonio. It was only $3.45 a 6-pack. well worth every penny. i should have bought more. We dont have it in my lil hole in the wall town. It goes down so smoothly. Has a hint of a sweet taste to it. I will definitely buy this the next time I head to S.A."
""
""
""
""
"pretty rotten gear here, but still better than some crappy 30 pack stuff. pours pale and yellow, but who pours an old milwaukee right? this is a right out of the can product for sure. it smells a tad metallic, but mostly just watery, not much of a nose at all, which i guess is better than a repulsive aroma. boring. the flavor is about as exciting as the nose, maybe a touch of pale pale malt, but thats about it. this is flavored water to me, but the feel isnt horrible, great carbonation, maybe even too much, and a real light body. very drinkable if you like, but dont plan on getting drunk on this stuff and feeling very good. not bad when its freezing cold, but i will never ever ever buy this."

"O - Overall, it's a cheap beer. Not impressive, but much better than that wrongly marketed flavored water know as Stroh's. But, it definitely doesn't hold up to it's lables claim as "" America's best tasting beer ""."
"Fine adjunct, drinking with the guys beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes bland and insipid, like soggy saltines and watery tea. Astringent feel (not bitter, so many confuse the two) with a carbonic bite from high CO2 levels. If you want to get bloated, here is the beer for you. Smoother than Stroh's but that's not saying much. Not something i'm inclined to finish, especially as it warms up in the summer heat. Best thing going for it is the nostalgia/throwback brand appeal and the Will Ferrell commercials."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: Though a little sweet for my taste (in regards to adjuncts) it is not bad. I would definitely buy this again for a camping trip."

"It's pretty easy to understand why this beer wins gold medals when you try it. It is a solid beer with good flavor and it is also very refreshing. This is a very good beer. If you are looking for an adjunct lager on a budget, but also want some flavor, you can never go wrong with Old Milwaukee. It may not be America's best tasting beer, but it is a very good beer."
"Old Mill was as staple of the 70s and 80s. Everyone knows it simply ""dont get no better than this", and if you can appreciate the grammar, you can appreciate old swill. In my area old milwaukee is only carried in one grocery and offered in 6 pack tallboy form only. The appearance is light straw colored, paler than either schlitz or pabst (old swill owned by pabst, sub-brewed by miller) with large white head that fizzes away. Surprisingly some lacing is left in the glass. The smell is rather neutral to weak, generic grains is about it, nothing offensive but nothing of note. Taste is similar, a bit weak with slight bitter, a cardboard papery taste as well. Mouthfeel is crispy and dry, is drinkable. Overall old swill is superior to other budget brands like natty, keystone, busch, etc but schlitz gusto is way better for slightly higher price."
""
""
"O. If anyone is feeling the pinch of how expensive things are getting these days, wich Im sure alot of folks are. I recommend giving Old Milwaukee a try. Its quite refreshing and quenching, a great working mans beer sure to satisfy!!"
""
""
"It's got all that delicious wet grain and corn syrup flavour that was on the nose, but it's not as sweet as the smell would suggest. It's really fairly dry. And as obviously cheap as the flavour is, it's really just indescribably pleasant. It's hard to put into words. The ingredients just taste good and natural. It doesn't have any weird flavours you don't want in there like Budweiser, Coors, MGD, or any light beer. It's just a regular old, easy-drinking beer-man's beer. Well, impoverished beer man, anyway. This is quite possibly the best ADJUNCT lager I've ever had, not including higher alcohol brews like euro strong lagers. It may be the only adjunct lager I need to buy from now on, but I will keep trying new ones when I find them. This one is so damn cheap, though."
""
""
"Aroma is sweet and fruity, I am thinking apples or maybe is the corn syrup.Taste is also fruity sweet, pleasantly drinkable after all the head has finally gone off.Very thin on the body, almost watery, not much carbonation."

"Even though I would buy Pabst over this, I still think it is a very fine beer, and should continue to be available to anyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is sweet and adjunct but balanced. Very thin and easy to drink. Still, pretty well your typical adjunct lager, but a perfectly acceptable one."
""
"Very decent. Like a slightly boozier High Life but with less corn flavor and more malts. Absolutely worth the $18 for a flat of pounders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Poundable but not very flavorful, goes down easily and not too filling since there isn’t much to the beer, mild kick, it’s very typical of the style but there are better inexpensive beers out there."

"No hangover."
"Overall – Nothing offensive and yet nothing memorable. I suppose it's decent for the price, but nothing I would revisit any time soon."
"Straw and gold color with a quickly fading head and lots of bubbles. Smell is of grain, corn and some grass. Taste is okay, with sweet grains and a bit of malt. Mouthfeel is light with lots of carbonation. Not my favorite, but would do at a party or a camping trip. Nothing bad at all about, just nothing that makes me wanna come back to it."
"overall, i think in longneck this would be a bit better. super cold on a summer day...late summer can poured into a tulip doesn't quite cut it, but then, i should've had the DFH punkin ale after not before i had this...."
"D - Overall not terrible for the style, but not a great beer overall. Maybe I'll remember it next time I need to find 24 of something cheap."
"Pale gold with a thin head. Very small amount of lace. Smell is sweet malty yeast. Not much. Taste is thin, yeasty. A little sweetness and very slight bitterness. Fairly sweet finish with the same on the aftertaste. Bubbly, carbonated, thin mouth. runs toward the sweet side as adjunct lagers go. Above average for the style in my opinion. Less offputting flavors than some other AALs. With Bud being at the bottom for the style and maybe Schlitz at the top, this is a little above the middle."
"This stuff is just nasty. It seems like anything that has Milwaukee on the label is just undrinkable. It has to be the worst of the value brands. I have to cringe in order to swallow it and I only do so when I have a strong desire to be drunk. Consider brushing your teeth after drinking one of these if you want anyone to talk to you."
"There are better options out there, even in the category of cheap beer. Lesson learned: if you see the world ""Milwaukee"" on the container, odds are you should run for the hills."
"O: Overall I am not impressed, lacks the characteristics better examples demonstrate."
"Ok it is cheap. It is not a boutique beer. It is for guys who don't make much money and work hard for what they do have. It, PBR, Bud, Miller, and so on really shouldn't be on this site...at least they should be separated from the Micros and boutique beers. they are everyday beers you order with pizza and burgers. They are working men and women beers and are not intended to be anymore than that."
"I think Old Milwaukee is definitely better than some others in the category and the price point, like PBR, is better than others as well. I suppose it doesn't really matter when you're drinking down on this level, and people who are not BAs and have a favorite macro to the exclusion of all others crack me up. Try Old Milwaukee if you need to drink down for some reason; I don't think you'll be especially disappointed."
"When you can pick up a 30 can case of beer for $8.98 you know that that it just ain't going to ""pack the punch"" of the craft beer down the aisle that is selling for $8.99x6pk. But sometimes, SOMETIMES, quantity makes up for quality. The old ""Old SWILLwaukee"" of my college days is back with all of the gusto of a cheap beer. There just is no going back to college days, the ambiance of the frat house just doesn't exist in my computer ""den"". But, out in the garage, right from the old frig it goes down just right."
"Pours with two fingers of soap suds looking head. Lace has mild cling. Color matches a 2 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is of wet corn. Flavor has hints of corn and other cooked veggies, maybe a little hint of malt, and very light on the hops. Mouthfeel is about the best part of this beer. It is full and sort of creamy, and lots of carbonation. I had this beer in my younger days and I seems like the flavor has changed for the not as good. I would drink this if someone offered as to not hurt their feelings, but I would not spend my money on it. Maybe it will taste better from a bottle."
"Aroma - Not much of one"
"D - This has gotta be the best Adjunct Lager I've had since Schlitz and Olympia. It's very very easy to drink like most of em, and it didn't have anything offensive to it really. I would say give it a try and you might be surprised, I would probably pick it up again because it's so cheap."
"This beer is extremely similar to most macro lagers. I'd prefer Pabst, or bud over this."
"All that subliminal programming when I was a kid really paid off. OM is my favorite American Lager. Just a hint of hops, clean mouthfeel, goes down easy. This is a true American staple. Sure, if I have $9 to spend on a 6-pack, I'll pick up a specialty brew. Otherwise, it's OM for me."
"D: Not one of the best adjuncts out there. It's flabby, overly-dependent upon corn, and has a cabbage off-flavor."
"I rate the drinkability high on this because it is pretty easy to drink a lot of these which is how I rate this particular style. It is a great cheap lawnmower beer. This is one of my favorite cheap summer beers."
"Overall, this is a generic lager, however there is nothing overly offensive and it is very drinkable. There are better beers out there, but good for a cheap beer on a hot day."
"This is best on a hot summer day when the beer has been iced down for a few hours. Very refreshing in this capacity. Its not as bad as its reputation, however its obviously nothing special. Light, easy to drink with a routine flavor of corn and grains typical of cheap american beers."
"D- Super low alcohol and barely any taste...I guess they would be easy to drink?"
"Bottom line it's not my choice to purchase (I'd rather have PBR, Hamms, Old Style)....but it is a better buy (cost v. taste) that the BMCs"
"I shit you not this stuff was $29.99 for a 1/2 barrel at Discount Liquors in Milwaukee when I was going to Marquette. How many kegs did we kill of this during the 2003 Final Four run?"
"I poured into a pint glass to a couple inches of white head. It is pale yellow in color. The aroma is sweet malt. The taste is sweet malt and a bit grassy. At least it has some flavor to it, not much, but as least something. The mouthfeel is watery. The drinkability is limited to a mood when I need something watered down and cheap."
"For being an economy brand it was good, and I'm rating it accordingly... I rate it for how it tastes with regards to what it is."
"overall, not my favorite at all."
"CHEERS ""Old Man"""
"Stay away. Whether you're looking for ""good beer"" or a ""cheap buzz", this isn't the beer you're looking for. There are better choices for both at the same price."
"Plus, it was Steve McQueen's favorite brew. So that adds some cool points."
"Poured into glass from can. Nice fluffy, foamy head on this one. Clear and yellow as expected. Smell is a bit stale and corny. Initial taste is suprisingly not terrible. Clean and bright american beer taste (corn) without much aftertaste. No hop taste or bitter finish. Just a straight-forward adjunct pale lager. Mouthfeel is nearly invisible for a ''heavy''. Not great but better than some of it's style mates."
"Tastes like regular beer too, nothing special but it does remind me of the beer I had when I was younger that I would taste from my dad."
"Pretty nasty stuff -- it has only a tangential relationship with the way beer should taste. I'm well acquainted with low-cost American beers (as my reviews attest), and OM is really at the bottom of the list as far as I'm concerned. I don't even consider it frat-party material (a la Milwaukee's Best) -- it just doesn't even try. Will not be missed if and when it fades away (except by some of my buds who went to college in the upper Midwest, and maybe not even by them)."
"Poured a light yellow with a decent head and carbonation. smell is a generic stale odor, but not bad. Taste is clean with a slight grainy flavor. Goes down smooth & easy. Enough flavor to put it way ahead of any light beer. Good summer beer when served cold or session drinkers on a tight budget."
"It's OK though."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Overall I'd say it's a fairly easy drinking beer. Good for a game of beer pong or something like that, but if I'm going to sit down and relax with a good beer, I won't choose this."
"RJT"
"D: Isn't true the slogan that says ""America's Best Tasting beer"""
"Taste is pretty clean with some husky grain coming through. A touch of stale cardboard flavor can be found along with a mild sparkling water taste. Not a whole lot here, but I can see this being refreshing when thirsty. Not bad for an AAL, pretty average actually. Has a pretty cheap price tag to boot, I got 6 tallboys for 4.99."
"It is what it is. And for what it is (an adjunct lager) it is pretty damn good."
"Poured from a 16oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a small head. Aroma is mild, some notes of corn. Taste is greatly lacking. Not much flavor at all here. Feels light in the mouth. Drinkability is fairly good. Overall there is not much to say, or like about this beer."
"Overall, for $5.39 a sixer of 16oz cans, this will be my go to when PBR or Schlitz isn't available or if I'm not in the Micro mood or um, BROKE :)"
"I have to admit, I've always had a soft spot for Ole Mil. Pour is typical of beers of this style in both color and head. It also has the slight corn aroma associated with adjunct lagers. As far as taste, I'd much rather have one of these than a host of other macros. Real easy drinking as long as you get it drank while its nice and cold. I would say this is under appreciated as far as American macros go."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a pale straw color with a fast white head (aggressive pours) that was gone as quick as it came. No lacing, no retention, thin corn and malt smell. Thin mouthfeel with some slight malt taste and a little grainy in the finish. Lets be honest, on a hot day at the lake fishing or boating, I could drink a lot of these, and for the cost, why not compare to some others (you know what I am talking about). Not something to give to guests, but for a refreshing brew on a hot day it is tolerable."
"The mouth is thin and wet. No carbonation bite at all. Flavor is muted grains, light bread, and finishes slightly buttery and sweet. This is a decent cookout brew, but that's about it. Honestly, if you must, there are better macros than this out there."
"Smeone once told me I had to try Old Milwaukee when I couldn't afford a case of Bud. So here I am drinking my 4th one on Monday afternoon. Tricky beer. Couldn't discern any hops or grains, mainly water. However, it does promote a nice mouthfeel. Some beers in this category ring a bitter taste on the sides of the tongue but this one does not. I think my 30 pack was on the shelf for a while because it has a definate hint of age. I will call this one Old Mildue, but will buy again for the second fridge when things are desperate."
"Picked up a cheap 12 pack for a campout. This was a family friend's #1 and only beer when I was growing up. It's not too bad for a ""sub-premium"" lager."
"$11.49 a case, 12 ounce cans. I actually poured one into a pint glass so I could see the color and stuff for the review. This is one of the quintessential old school American adjunct brews. It isn't great, but it is definitely drinkable. Pale gold, a decent bit of head that goes poof quick. Taste is ""beer"" as imagined by that machine that makes Arthur Dent some tea in the Hitchhiker's Guide, I recognize corn, a bit of malty sweet up front, and a teeny tiny bit of hops on the back end of the deal. At this price point, nothing I've tasted is better. And anyways, What's Chewbacca's favorite beer? Old Milwookie!"
"Pours a pale yellow color. There was a one finger head which disappeared quickly. The smell and taste are both somewhat musty with a lot of corn on the nose. It is thin and watery without much flavor or character. I don't know how anybody drinks this. It was free to me, so I didn't lose any money buying it."
"It goes down real easy. This is one of my favorites to drink after mowing the lawn, but not exactly an award winner."
"Overall: Old Milwaukee is a decent adjunct lager at an incredible price, probably the best beer value on the market. Go for it if you want an inexpensive brew that gets the job done."
"Had a Schlitz and decided to try and Old Milwaukee, same company, not the same beer. Schlitz is far superior. It was almost like drinking a flat Schlitz. Nothing exciting, rather dull, not bad, no aftertaste, just kind of boring. Fairly drinkable and probably as good as Miller, maybe better, but nothing to make me run out and buy it."
"It doesn't taste like much, but it doesn't taste bad. To me, cheap beer exposes itself when drank with food, and Old Milwaukee's flaws are evident, but its okay."
"Out of a 16 0z can this brew was a very pale yellow color with perfect clarity. The head was pure white, two fingers large and displayed average retention and moderate lacing. The aroma was slightly stale, pale malt, macro lager malt, dry grains, corn and minerals. The flavors were very dry and grainy, pale malt and some light hops. Clean and simple. The finish was a little off, however, bitter but not in a hoppy way. The mouthfeel was rough and foamy, the body medium/light and the carbonation high. If the finish and the body were worked on this one could be pretty good, but as is, even for the style, I found it sub-par."
"BOTTUM LINE: the slogan ""americas bet tasting beer"" may be a bit ambitious, but for 50 cents a can it may as well be"
"This is a brew that holds a nostalgic place in my heart. Had a case of these at about 45-50 degrees the day before my and my friends left for college. Stayed in the can so I can't say much about the color but the taste was decent considering the cost of the beers. Once again, considering cost, I would buy this beer. Great party stocker if you're expecting a lot of people."
"Poured from a 16 fl. oz. can marked 02029-D50621. This is one of those rare instances where the brand's light beer is tastier than its regular old stand-by. This pours pale yellow into the pint glass with about 1/2 inch of white, foamy head. Typical beer aroma of American pales with that sort of metallic, grassy, and lightly hopped scent. Lots of bubbling carbonation. Watery for the most part. There's something grassy with a slight hint of hops in the taste. Nothing exciting. Their slogan is ""America's Best Tasting Beer."""
"It doesn't get much cheaper than this. ( Old Mil in a can ). A light clear golden with a large white head and big carbonation. Aroma is corn, grains, light citrus and soapy hints. Flavor is mild bitter malts, hops, corn, wheat. It is just a typical cheap macro swill but I find it refreshing and I sort of like cheap swill from time to time."
"There was a can in the fridge, so I decided I might as well review it. The beer poured a a yellow-tinted clear with a two-finger head caused by a vigorous pour that didn't last long. The smell is all corny malt adjunct. Taste-wise there's not a whole lot going on, it starts off with some sweet corn taste and then that goes away and that's it. The only thing this beer has going for it is how drinkable it is. It's slightly-alcoholic carbonated corn-water, but goddamn if it isn't crisp and refreshing after something like mowing the lawn or putting a new different colored door on the IROC-Z sitting up on blocks in the yard."
"Felt good in the mouth. I thought the carbonation was actually pretty good. I saw these at the store and thought, what the hell. Its been a long time since Ive had one, and thought I would give it a try. Actually not bad. Would make a good lawnmower beer."
"It pours a light pee color. Small head. Tastes terrible and I'd rather spend the extra 2 dollars for a 12 of miller lite. I'm not a big cheap beer drinker I go for the more microbrewed beer so I might not be so good at judging these beers. But I didn't like it."
"For the price, this beer is one of my overall favorite discount macros, very well done, a simple beer that gets the job done. I like this one."
"working on a 12-pack. so far don't really mind drinking it except at first for the seltzer qualities (followed quickly by a slight sense of flatness) and after a while the corn seems more and more emphasized. but hey i like corn flakes so why not have this sometimes? mmm beer on a cob."
"Mouthfeel is very thin and the carbonation has a scrubbing effect. Goes down easy enough, but I don't think I'll go back to this one."
"Drinkability: As far as American macro lagers go this is very easy drinking and might be my favorite."
"Wow, I hadn't had this in years, and now I won't have to drink it again for several years - I hope. There's little about the flavor that resembles an all-malt beer. It relies heavily of yeast character, which is just a bit like the green apple found in Budweiser, but watered down and gone rancid. Avoid this one at all costs. Yes, it could have been more offensive, but it was still no treat to drink."
"Didn't pour it out of the can to be honest. Had a metallic smell. This is a decent, watery cheap beer to buy when you're reliving the ol' college days and playing drinking card games with some buddies. Has a quasi-sweet malt taste and the use of adjuncts is minimal. Very light hop presence but is not at all bitter or going to nuke your taste buds/stomach like other cheap American macros. Goes down light-bodied and smooth because of the wateriness, but this isn't horrible."
"Easy going down, after 2-3 you can't even tell you have started in. Overall I feel this is just a run of mill American Lager, nothing to write home about. But nothing to avoid, as it runs right along with the other ""budget"" lagers."
"Well, this is what it is. It can get worse, but not a whole lot worse. Very pale looking beer with very little head or lacing. Better than the Beast but still not much in flavor and has an old, musty, grainy, foul, malty, taste and aftertaste. At least it's cheap."
"D: While wont blow you away it wont totally turn you off. A tad sweet, but fairly clean. Would drink if the greater of lesser options at a party but wouldn't spend my money at it. Average for what it is."
"I highly doubt that I will ever drink this beer again."
"On draft at a nice little biker bar I was at yesterday, been a long time so I enjoyed a few. I used to drink this from time to time back in the day, it was inexpensive and always made for a good camp fire beer. No redeeming qualities just good old cheap pale lager."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Feels like cold tonic water in the mouth. Not much here. Light and fizzy, with no lasting flavor. Easy enough to drink, but I won't be buying it again. My fall back macro, get smashed, and goes good with greasy American foods, Burgers, Pizza(okay its Italian), etc would have to be Stroh's or Old Style."
"The can states this was brewed by""Jos. Schlitz Brewing Company, Milwaukee, WI," but we all now it's another of Pabst's beer corpses. I get a kick out of it's trademark slogan - ""America's Best Tasting Beer!"" - and wonder what critical methodology they used to come to that conclusion. Easily drinkable in the way water is drinkable. It works after work on a 98 degree day like today, but I don't see much use for it other than that."
"Pours an impossibly clear yellow color, with a short-lived white head and minimal lacing. Vague sweet smell, bready, somewhat sour...not much going on there. It tastes OK. Some sweet malt, and a faint (very faint) bitter hoppiness going down. Really fizzy, almost champagne-like bubbliness to this one. I'd take this over anything with the word ""Light"" in the name, but not something I'd go out of my way for. At a summer BBQ, you could do a lot worse than this."
"D-Good. I could drink a lot of these on a hot day, or anytime for that matter!"
"Drinkability is good for a cheap beer as it does carry a nice bitter taste. $6.99 a 12-pack, you can't beat it!"
"D: I'll buy you a case and dwink it with you if you fix my motherfucking bwakes!!!"
"The blandness and fizziness, however, do start to make it a real drag before the 16 ounces are finished. However, it does have a surprising smoothness to it and isn't undrinkable. Not ""America's best tasting beer", but it's drinkable enough if you want an iced-cold chugger on a hot day. Whatever..."
"I was recently in Whitewater and had to stop at one of my favorite liquor stores in search for tasting all of the beers that Pabst brewery makes. I looked but came to no avail, so I decided to pick up one of my staple beers, Old Milwaukee. The cans have a new design which are cooler looking then the old dumb OM symbol. The look I poured straight into a mug, foam quickly appears at the top and quickly disappears, light golden transparent color. Average taste nothing overpowering about it, more alcohol than anything. Corn and other grains mixed in with it. Mouthfeel dry easy going down, not much to offer. Drinkability average nothing to bad about this beer, good for drinking all day, doesn't get old fast."
"Overall, this isn't too bad a beer, but I wouldn't jump up and down about it."
"A light body and large carbonation does make it a fun beer to drink if you are doing manual labor. Ice one down and shotgun it after mowing the lawn. I will use this one to cook with but thats about it... unless I am in a real pinch."
"Well I tried this beer as a joke, but I ended up liking it.. 12oz can, and after drinking a few of these I went for a bud and I thought bud was way to bitter for my liking so I gave those away at my last softball game.. Where I am it is $11.67 per case of cans and I can't go wrong with that.. No hangovers for me with this brew,, It tastes great ice cold after work too..It doesn't break my wallet either. My new everyday beer or PBR... I'm forgetting about Bud products..."
"There is a reason my friends call this ""old mill water"" Tried this one when their was nothing else to drink. Poured a pale straw color with some fizzy shooting bubbles. Smells of some soaked cereal grains and a hint of malts. Tastes like watered down Corn Flakes with nothing jumping out at me at all."
"M/D- Quite thin.. a slight bite. I wouldn't recommend drinking this stuff. Pretty tough to choke down."
"Pours a clear straw with fast fading dense white head and spotty lacing. Smell: cereal grains, sweet malt, quite crisp (hops?). Taste: cereal grains, touch of alcohol, slight hop and dms. Mouthfeel: overly crisp and thin. Not bad for a cheap macro lager."
"D - I'll never drink this again not even on a dare this stuff it that bad there are better cheap as dirt beers out there"
"Serious yellow fizzy stuff going on here. It could be ginger ale until the corn kicks in - smooooth corn hoss, and the flavor is real mellow too. I bought a case of 16 oz. cans of this stuff in Pennsylvania, and I haven't looked back since (I can't see much anyway on this beer). But really, it's not a bad macro - totally harmless and almost flavorless, but it has a grip on the tongue and the adjunct cereal grain character is perfect for fishing, lunchtime, or warm joyrides. Finishes less corny sweet than most macros, so I can reach for one more."
"A pint can, actually! On the pour, my first thought was, ""Wow, the color is virtually non-existent. I just put a stream into the urinal that had more color than this!"" Not a good start. I will, however, say this for the cheapies: they create a big, foamy, bone-white head with tremendous retention throughout. It was very impressive, actually. The nose was grainy, sweet, silage-like. On this last, if you have done any farming, you will get my drift. The mouthfeel was full and approaching creamy. There was a light sweetness in the mouth and on the finish. Did I get my $2.00 worth? Sure, but it was not something that I would scrounge for again."
"Even worse than Budweiser, Miller, and Coors. Used to drink the 14 ounce cans twenty-five years ago in high school. A beer of mass consumption, with only one purpose. Only redeeming quality is cheap price. No taste, character, aroma, or complexity. Next."
"Taste is heavily adjunct-laden, yet somehow the whole is slightly more than the parts. Light malt sweetness mingles with cereal grains that remain smooth with no truly offputting flavors. Strong metallic finish could be blamed on a can, yet sadly this is in a glass bottle. Would be baseline drinkable if not for the metal twinge."
"I had a really tough time getting past the smell of this beer. It is just unpleasantly cereal-y and reminds me of everything I don't like about bad beer. Combine that with a rather unimpressive appearance and a light yet unpleasant cereal flavor, and you have yourself a real winner here...I'd rather have a Miller Lite any day."
"Pours a very light yellow with head that fades fast.Aroma is very light and somewhat bland. Somewhat sweet as well. Taste is very sweet, corny and light on aftertaste. Not offensive. Goes down easy. Just not impressive at all. It's not the worst beer I've had though so I'm going to give it an average rating."
"Down here (SC) everything is Bud.... so OM isn't that bad !!! Goes down cold nicely. I used to drink this beer back in the early 70's, quantity over quality, and after drinking Bud Light and Miller Lite it's pretty good. Does Bud make anything worth while??"
"Anyhow, for lawnmower beers this rivals PBR as the most drinkable to me. You can taste the malts, which automatically puts it above most macro-lagers. It's refreshing and does what it's supposed to. For that, I'd say not bad."
"Overall your average macro. May be sweeter than most however."
"D - Not bad. For cheapo shit-beer, Heileman's is about the best in the buisness....but they also make PBR and Stag, which are much better beers IMO, but I might buy this again....who knows."
""
"In short - Old Milwaukee is a solid American beer and can take care of you in a pinch."
"The taste is semi sweet; there's some malt and grain going on with some hop character that bitters it but the flavours are light on the palate. I haven't tasted this for years and I'm sure I'll not taste it again for many more years to come. Just too damn common and bland."
"Old Milwaukee Beer pours a very pale yellow with an enormous white head from a sixteen ounce can. The aroma starts out being sweet but then something chemical seems to pop up to the front. Bland, grainy, and unfortunately a chemical taste too. I have bad memories of this beer as a youth, instant hangover no matter how little imbibed. Avoid."
"A ""must have"" for any beer bong."
"overall its a cheap beer i believe a ""dirty thirty"" was only around $10 but i would much rather have passed on this"
"D - This wasn't as bad as I expected. However, it was not as good as PBR."
"i might try this again, but only if left with very few options."
"$1.50 12 oz bottle at Old Fashioned in Madison, WI. Ugly new label tries to court nostalgic but ends up offending them. Pours light yellow with some bubbles and a nice white lacing. Ultra transparent. Smells likenot much. Maybe a little corn and some veggies but really not a whole lot. Smooth and creamy with almost no taste. There could be malt and/or hops in this beer but its difficult to tell. There could also be corn or rice but again, I cant taste much of anything. Drinks well though. Goes right down. Tastes clean. No noticeable adjuncts at least. Not overly sweet or carbonated. Just perfectly balanced, balancedon nothingness. Ill take a PBR over this but it beets most of the other cheap swill out there."
"This is cheap, and not much of a brew. It pours a nice light gold and actually has a nice head. If you could make it on appearance alone we would on our way to a decent rating,. But the nose is a sour fermeted rice aroma, and the flavor is not much better. It has a very fizzy mouthfeel and has excessive cabonation. In a world with so many great beers to select from there is no reason to choose this one."
"Pale yellow beer with a smallish, fizzy, white head that disappeared quickly. Very little lacing of note. Smells of sweet grainy malts. Taste is surprising decent given the price of this beer. Unoffensive if a bit on the sweet side. A tad too fizzy in the mouthfeel department. An average macro brew at best"
"24oz can. Very VERY light yellow translucent body (almost water colored). Smells like many other macro lagers, with hints of hop, malt, and corn. Light watery taste with a little corn sweetness and hints of DMS. Very light watery body with only moderate carbonation. The good news is that it's drinkable enough considering the non-offensive flavor and watery mouthfeel. Otherwise, this beer isn't good for much other than when you don't have much money I guess."
"Cheers."
"Pale golden-yellow with a medium-large, white, foamy head that quickly diminishes to a thin film. Smell is grain, yeast and light corn with a little stink to it. The taste is actually rather good for a macro cheapo. Bready, lightly sweet and some very light berry in there. It has a thin body, lightly dry texture (about the only sign of hops in this beer) and moderate carbonation. This beer was refreshing and satisfying. Its not all that good, and the smell isnt too pleasant, but overall its not bad. You could do a lot worse in the realm of macros."
"Can: Poured a lightly carbonated golden yellow color lager with a small foamy head with minimal retention. Aroma of corn adjunct is way too powerful and gross. Taste is also dominated by the adjunct with too much sugar. Another bland offering from this awful brewery."
"Poured a pale yellow color with initial large white chunky head., that rather quickly dissapeared.Smell is slightly sweet, but little else. Taste is very light with some mild sweetness found. Finishes very thin in the mouth. Very freshing when ice cold, but less so as it warms."
"$5.99 for a 12-pack. That should tell you how crappy this beer is. This is the palest beer I have ever had. The pure white head is at first quite impressive, but soon fades to nothing. The only thing that distinguishes this glass from a glass of cold piss is the slight carbonation. The smell is of grain and not much else. Corn comes out the strongest. Taste is the same, that tangy grimace-inducing flavor common to macros. Corn. Aftertaste is no better. If you try, you can taste a little alcohol, which so far is the only reason to ingest this substance. As for mouthfeel, this beer somehow seems thinner than water. Very slight carbonation. Very drinkable if you have a cold. Don't try this at home."
"Overall a fine macro as far as macro's go. You may find yourself reaching for a second can of this stuff. A close 3rd to PBR and Schlitz for ne for cheap macro's."
"Definately a good beer for the buck. Also, it's great to have during the summer, outside, when you just want to relax and get drunk.I would buy again, but only in the summer time. Just a very casual drinking beer when I don't really care about quality."
"Very pale color with a fizzy head. Head is large and dies instantly. Smells cereal grainy with a touch of corn. More taste than many macros but the taste is downright bad. A very strong metallic flavor lies in there combined with an adjunct corn flake flavor. Once the corn flake flavor leaves, the metallic flavor dominates and lingers in the finish. Body is a touch fizzy but a bit more substantial than some in its category. Maybe this used to be good, but I got a headache after drinking this can. Terrible."
"The mouth is thin and unassuming. Drinkable only in the most dire circumstances."
"Drinkability-- for iced tea, very drinkable. For beer, how can they make this claim?!?!?!?"
"I remember somewhat hazily that this beer, years ago, was a staple for myself and my fraternity brethren. Also that it required a special draft system as the keg taps were different from all the other swill beers we we were copiously imbibing on a daily basis. It also came in smaller diameter cans like coors products at the time(late 80's/early 90's). We drank enough of this stuff to float a battleship esp. during our annual beer olympics(a la Beerfest the movie). Because of the speed of intake, I really don't remember much about the taste. Ergo, I picked up a $5.00 12 pack to stumble down amnesia lane. A: Standard macro color, straw yellow, but with more carbonation and head than most BMC products with a surprisingly enduring lace. S: Sweet corn and grains, no real hops to speak of. T: Not bad with a mild smoothness and slight corn sweetness. It also doesn't worsen as the beer warms like Budweiser. M: Standard macro, watery with lack of viscosity D: Very drinkable and a nice choice if cash is low and the plan is to obtain a buzz which was always the plan in college. OM and esp OM light are very nice choices for cheap macros when selection is limited and volume consumption is the main objective."
"Drinkability: Do I have to finish the glass? Tastes better when chugged - that says something."
"Overall I wouldn't drink this again unless it was given to me on a hot day as a cool down beverage."
"Ah, this beer brings back fond memories of my underage drinking days in high school and college. Hanging out by the river with my buddies and some half naked women while guzzling six packs of this stuff and then waking up in the morning next to a girl that I don't recognize. Now on to the review. As expected, this beer pours a pale yellow color with a large one inch head that dissipated quickly. Aroma was very strong of corn/adjuncts along with a cooked vegetable smell. Not very good. Taste was slightly better as long as the beer was very cold. I could taste the ever present corny flavor with some malt character way in the backround. There was also a lemony/citrusy taste that was thirstquenching and pleasant in the 94 degree heat of the afternoon. Hop flavor was not present. The finish was very thin and watery in the mouth. As the beer warmed, I was unable to finish the can and had to dump it. Oh well. My memories will always be there, but I will not be drinking OM again. My tastes in beer have matured too much since then."
"While the American Macro isn't one of my favorite style, this one is one of the worse I've tasted."
"Give it a try. dont let the price scare you, This cheap brew is pretty good."
"You know what, it isn't bad. No worse than any other macro out there. I mean, it's skunky, but doesn't taste bad and is extremely drinkable. It's a thirst quencher. If you are going for a macro, no reason to spend any more money than is necessary."
"710 ml can. Pours a clear straw yellow, really pissy looking, strange fluffy loose white head, no lace or retention. Smell is sweet, honey, metallic, maybe citrus. Taste is nasty, really pissy and sweet, strange metallic flavour. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. One of the nastiest beers I've ever had and not what I would expect the Pabst Brewery."
"Cheers!"
"Very typical Macro Lager, pours yellowy/golden color, white head that is here one minute, gone the next. Smells like beer, tastes like beer. Nothing out of the ordinary, but nothing bad either. Thin, but not watered down. Doesn't have that sour finish like some other macros. Easy to drink on a hot day, and it is priced right. Average."
"Do not get a very nice smell or any at all. Taste like water with some malt added in. Very little and I mean very little as about non at all. This is not really the best tasteing brew. But what else can you expect for five dollars a 12 pack. Ultimate budget beer."
"""It doesn't get any better than this"" is the motto on the can. REALLY?? Drinking carbonated water? Pours quite fizzy, the head disappears quickly. The clearest yellow coloring you've ever seen. Taste? Well I can detect the slightest grainy malt flavor and that is it.Nothing but water. Granted this makes it very easy to drink, but how can you really call this beer. I wonder what a light version of this beer would be like."
"So I broke down and bought a couple of 24oz. cans of this stuff a little earlier. As empty as my pockets are, good beer just isnt accessible. Thought I might as well rate it. At first it tastes just like any other american macro brew, only with a little touch of sour/bitterness during the aftertaste. But maybe thats just a tin-can flavor. The closer you get to the bottom of the can, the more watery it begins to taste. Almost like the little flavor that is there is all at the top. I do notice that this beer actually smells fairly nice. The nose is quite mild, but the smell I get almost reminds me of stella. I'm not sure how thats possible, and I'm going to assume there must be something wrong with my smelling senses tonight. Weird. Mouthfeel is alright I guess. A little thin, but what can you expect? Drinkability is decent if you're broke and in need of a cheap buzz."
"Can obtained in a bunch of stuff given to me for volunteering for 2005 GABF. Reviewed from detailed notes taken a week ago. Stamp on the can reads 12125 D80359. Pours a one finger sticky white head over a plae straw colored liquid. Crystal clear. Smells of corn, mild sweet, and some dark hops. Tastes thin and mild. A hint of sour and iron. Floral hops in the aftertaste are weak and easy on the tongue. Corn and cardboard are other main players. Light body and md carbonation. Hurray!, a macro where carbonation isn't a dominant flavor. Scored to style, not my preferences."
"Most of my family dont like this beer, is piss water, said; but for me is good, better i say than the anheuser busch family beers (macro´s of course), its palate is wide, smell like broiled hops, little herbal too; taste had a touch of yeast, rice and very soft for me; try direct from the can or serve in a pint glass; 85% recommended."
"For being a Macro Lager, it was ok, and I think it is the best among the Old Milwaukee variety. The colour is not green at all, and it is very goldy, very good and the foam is nice, very bubbling and it is what it counts for a lager, at least for me."
"I can't even follow my normal criteria for this one, Old Mil is your everyday normal adjunct-filled American lager with fans reminiscent of beast or Pabst looking back at it as if it were the greatest beer in the world. Well it's far from it!!! Flat taste, not so great appearance and minimal recollection soon after drinking of any difference from other mass-produced beers. Avoid if your at all a serious beer drinker, for beers with mass fan clubs though you could do worse."
"At my days working in a grocery store I see a lot of people, mainly the elderly, buy this beer. People would come in 3 even 4 times a week and purchase 18, 24, and/or 30 packs of Old Milwaukee. After witnessing this I had to at least give it a shot. I obtained a 24 oz. can, cracked it open and took a swig. The taste was plain and flat, reminiscent of an Anheuser-Busch product. As sick as it was I thought at the very least, due to the lack of flavor, I could drink it quickly and move on. However, a terrible, extremely bitter aftertaste followed, as if overcompensating for the original weak taste. Overall the taste was grainy with a hint of corn. The aroma was unappetizing. It had little frothy head to get in the way, and the color was a thicker yellow than most. The only reason I finished it was because I spent my own money on it and by time I was done I was barely buzzing. If there was a beer worse than the swill Anheuser-Busch siphoned from the sewers, this would be it."
"Not much say here. Looks lighter and dirtier than piss. Almost sweet smell. The taste is nasty metallic horses ass. It might make you cry. The mouthfeel is that of getting stabbed in the face. Incredibly not drinkable. I would rather drink my own urine."
"This is a good cheap beer. Not a great beer, but it is definetly drinkable, not bad by any means.. Good value, I had the big can. Much better than bud light and the like. It is best cold, but I threw the last few swigs out as it warmed and grabbed another cold one. If your going to buy budweiser, buy this instead it tastes much better and is way easier on your wallet. If your on a budget and you want something that doesn't taste like crap, this is the way to go, sometimes I use this as a spacer beer."
"The mouthfeel is alright. Average at best. Moderate carbonation with a very light body. I could drink a lot of these but I would say the drinkability is about average because the flavor doesn't make you want to drink a bunch. It's an O.K. beer for an all day type of session. Not terrible."
"The beer pours a very pale yellow color with a towering white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is below average. It has a very light pale malt scent along with adjuncts and a dry lager yeast aroma. It has a metallic aroma. The hops are light and it has a musty quality. The taste is average. It has a dry and musty pale malt flavor that goes down slow due to overcarbonation and finishes clean with some lingering hops. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with too much carbonation. This is a decent macro lager. It has little flavor or aroma, but on a hot day this would go down easy."
"This is not bad, but not recommended by any means."
"12 oz. can with no freshness date - served chilled in a pint glass. It's a pale gold with a 1 finger white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lace. Smells of adjuncts and cooked veggies. Flavors are corn and some malts with a light and tingy body. Serves its purpose, but there's more drinkable macros."
"Old Milwaukee isn't good beer by any stretch of the imagination. It is good enough though to have bested one of America's favorite beers, beechwood-aged Budweiser. Even though this is one of the more lopsided MacSmacks so far, I'm still not interested in ever having this stuff cross my palate again."
"Old Milwaukee has a reputation around these parts as being a rather poor beer. Clearly it's better than many macrobrews simply because it doesn't actively offend. Add to that a relatively low price and you've got an acceptable emergency hot weather beer."
"Looks like white apple juice. Decent sized white fizzy head. Carbonation rises aggressively. Aroma is sweet and malty (in a macro kind of way) and a little grainy. Mouthfeel is fizzy. Body is medium. Taste has some decent maltiness to it for a macro. Just a splash of hops evident in the dry finish. Not too bad. I'd place it just about in the middle of my spectrum of Macro brews."
"Not bad tasting, but way too fizzy. Avoid."
"Summary: I may have had this beer once in my days, but since OM NA has become my fave NA I thought I'd give this one a look see again. I paid 5.49 for a 12. It's okay, but nothing will make me buy it again. Regular Genessee is about the cheapest beer I'll buy when I want something cheap. PBR is still my ""autoworker special"" standard for cheap beers."
"I picked up a 32 ouncer at Circle K because I was feeling like something simple and cheap. Color is pale yellow with a fizzy head. Aroma is typical of cheap macro lagers, I've smelled a lot worse than this within this style of beer. Taste isn't very flavorful, which actually may make Old Milwaukee better than some of it's counterparts; there aren't any bad flavors to complain about. Seeing how cheap and unoffensive this is, I would consider this a good choice for a lawnmower beer. Still OM will never compete with my craft brew choices."
"When in a dive bar, do as the locals do, I figure. Seems to me that the locals drink a lot of Old Milwaukee. Pouring a fizzy yellow colour with little head, it seemed that this would be an uneventful tasting. The aroma was sweet. I couldn't quite place the smell. The taste was coppery. Hints of corn came through, but nothing original."
"here's my issue with this beer....it is supposed to be a ""price"" lager but up in my neck of the woods it's priced damn near the Buds, MGD, and Coors....It's of lesser quality than those...hasa hint of cheap beer taste to it...very corny and sweet...body is thin almost fizzy..finishes a little tart....OK...not worth buying though"
"Another on my crappy beers to purchase list. I bought this after a case of Schlitz. It really isn't too bad, not much to her at all. Some sweetness and fizzles here and there but nothing too crazy. A much better beer than I was expecting, but then again I was expecting the worst. For the price you really cannot beat it. This beer is easily drinkable like Budweiser but much cheaper."
"Overall this isn't bad for the style and especially for the price. Like so many American macros, it seems like a little more flavor and aroma hops would improve it a lot."
"Overall, a strong ""Average"""
"This is no different from all the other mass produced swill I have poured down my throat over the past few weeks. It certainly doesn't taste bad, it simply just does not taste. I would never turn this Phil his arm extends with an old mil in hand with my name on it. Kinda hits the spot during my work breaks."
"Drinkability - This stuff drinks to fast the alcohol content seems very low. I finished off the box in 2 afterwork sessions without much of a buzz."
"Drinkability - for the price and the taste, it's a decent value, I doubt if most macro swillers could tell the difference between this and the rmega-lager."
"Not a special beer, but for the money, a good beer. Straw yellow color and odors of grain and alcohol. Short lived white head. Strong flavors of corn dominate this brew, with a watery finish. If you are a fan of the typical pabst brews, this one won't dissapoint."
"OK I know I'm scrapin the bottom of the barrel here, but we all need to consume some mass produced crap to keep us honest and keep us abreast of what is out there. This stuff is, suprise, piss yellow with a large bubble, short lasting head. Not much nose to speak of. Ditto for malt and hops. It is cold and wet and did help me wash down my dinner."
"Clear yellow color, small white head. Slightly malty, not a lot in the hops department. Not skunky, metallic, or musty like many beers in this price range. This beer, when judged against other American Macros, is actually somewhat of a standout. It's drinkability, affordablity, lack of off flavors, and wide availabitlity add up to a cheap beer that won't make you gag, at least."
"This is a brew that claims to only be a cheap yet drinkable and non-offensive brew and in that capacity is succeeds fully. I have drunk a lot of this with dinner when I hit the supermarket deli for dinner and just wanted a beer to go with say fried chicken. Which is exactly why I am even reviewing this brew here."
"This beer is one of those beers that comes in a can. Compared to those other canned brews it is on the sweeter, maltier side of taste. No bitterness. There must be a lot of great ingredients cause my head is ringing now and i didnt even drink that many of these. Better than some shitty macros, worse than the rest of the beers we love."
"Transparent lightest gold color, wide-bubbled head of a very thin character but better duration than some. Partial ring laces. Aroma is all sweetness, corn and cane sugar. Mouthfeel is thinnish but the carbonation is adequately done. No real sense of hops, malt is sweet and neutral without nasty qualities. Aftertaste is lightly honeyish without the overdone fizziness and mineral water taste of some macros. Cheap and forgetable, but not the worst of drinkabilities in the beer world."
"I had this beast out of a 40oz bottle. I was drinking it during one of Radford's infamous ""card games"" that they play to get wasted. I actually did get to critique this beer, so all was not wasted. the appearance wasn't mind bending, like the WWStout that I divulged myself in earlier, but it was nice. Straw colored with a frothy white head. The smell was of citrusy and corn proportions. The taste was similar, but not too strong. All in all a good cheap one."
"Suffice it to say that there is not a whole lot to be said about this beer so I am going to get right to my rating.Can:It formed a large white creamy sized head with fine sized bubbles.The body was clear with lively carbonation and the hue was yellow.There was not much of a nose to this beer other than some malt notes.The flavor was blah and the mouthfeel was surprisingly smooth, thin, watery and light bodied.This beer left very little in the way of any lacing."
"Probably one of the most drinkable lagers available at the nearest small gas station. Drinkable, if only just. Not good enough for enthusiasm, not bad enough to slam. It's beer, drink it."
"Overall, this is almost drinkable. I mean, hey. Its an american pilsner, a product of pabst. nothing fancy, nothing tasty. my grandfather lives by it, but what does that mean? it seems to be a case of product identity. Someday i will make a long line up of all the ""usual suspects"" and see just what the difference is between them all. Until then, i will drink good beer."
"Not THAT bad. Can't get much of a head or much smell. Clear yellow. I can taste a little malt, grain and some hops. $2 for a tall boy(not many beer choices) at the bar while my wife drinks margueritas. I guess it could be worse. Usually pretty fresh and cold."
"It's hard to blow sunshine up the ass of the average cheap beer, but Old Milwaukee makes it a little eaiser. The mildly sweet malt taste is quite the delicacy in a $5/12 pack beer. My dad told me this was the cheapest crap his fraternity could get; we should all be so lucky!"
"A crystal clear, straw-gold body is capped by a creamy bright-white head that holds well. Its retention is surprisingly good, and it leaves some nice lace to boot! The nose is exceptionally clean; with just a light touch of sweet malt. The body is light, and it's crisp in the mouth due to a fine-bubbled, median carbonation. Sweet malt makes up the entirety of the flavor, coming on strong at the start and slowly fading through the swallow. It's quite clean and devoid of any yeast characteristics. Adjunct is obviously being used at a high level as there's no real ""grain"" character present. It finishes drying with a dollop of sweet malt that receeds shortly. Very well made, but lacking in character."
"Drinkability/notes: This beer has only availability and a cheap price to recommend it, most American malt liquors have more to offer for the money. Interestingly enough, the can copy reads ""The Great American Beer Festival - 1999 Gold Medal Winner, American-Style Lager"". This fact seems quite extraordinary, considering the relative mediocrity of this beer."
"A pretty standard beer that fills a niche carved out for the macros by the marketing guys. Yellow body and white head. Grain sense in the nose. Standard carbonation and a better than macro mouthfeel. Drinkable in a crunch, but not one to be sought after."
"Pale clear yellow with a weak head. Little flavor initially then a some sweetness comes in. I'd like to say it is malt, but feels too coarse, more likely corn or some kind of sugar. No real hop flavor to speak of. Not a bad cheap beer although there are a few I'd put ahead of it. Pretty much in the middle of the pack of cheap American lager."
"This pours with very little excitement. The nose gets the odor of corn and oats. Taste is sweet and dry, but with a very grainy, chemical like finish. The malted cereal grains are the big player in this brew. This is a very cheap beer. next time i'll spend the extra for Pabst Blue Ribbon."
"Pours a very light golden with almost no head, has the appearance of being flat which the taste is quick to confirm..after a slight fizzy mouthfeel. Aroma is non descript and the taste is weak. Not a very good beer, but for the price it is acceptable."
"Sleemans did this beer the best it has probably ever been done just as they did Blue Ribbon. This offering was a testament to Sleeman's QC and not neccesarily the original OM recipe"
"Mouthfeel is average and it is easy to guzzle when it is ice cold and you want a cheap thrill--or you are on a strict budget like I am right now. Judging from reviews from less oppressive regimes (states) the added water in the 3.2 version actually may help the flavor."
"This is a cheap beer that tastes cheap. Not very pleasing on the palette whatsoever. In the line of cheap beers, Pabst or Stroh's is probably the way to go. Stay away from this stuff."
"Poured this beer in a glass and drank it. Then the second time I drank it out of the glass and it did taste better, only because by the time I drank it I was feeling no pain. The first glass of this beer was bad, but a 100 degree's, it tasted so so. If it was under normal conditions, I'd have throwed it in the rose garden there!"
"Very clear pale yellow with a decent amount of froth. The head stuck around for some time and settled in at about 1/5"" of fine bubbles. This was a pretty good looking American Lager. Fairly clean tasting with only a touch of corn in the nose. It tasted good, almost. This was one of the few ""popular"" American Lagers where the malt was noticeable. Crisp and clean. That was the theme of the beer. The only place this beer was lacking was in the hops. Very little hops. There was nothing that said ""hey, this is what hops taste like."" Instead, the thought was more like ""hmm, this is slightly bitter, but where did it come from?"" In the mouth the beer was quite pleasant. Much carbonation at first so I let it sit for about a minute while a looked at it waiting for the waves of rising bubbles to subside. I'm glad I did. After a minute when I tasted it there was still much carbonation, but rather being huge forced bubbles they were small and prickly. This was not as watery as the light version."
"why they evenmake this crap!"
"Old Milwaukee must have been some fouls smelling place for this stuff to be named after it. Another in the line of ""old man beers"" this stuff has less of a corn taste than its counterparts. I rarely see this in most stores, just the high volume macro vendors."
"If not for that unknown and unpleasant chemical note, Old Milwaukee would not be too bad for a low priced macro."
"Sickly gold, white head, minimal retention, no lace. Lightly sweet nose, adjucts I assume. Harshly metallic taste. Almost impossible to drink... it brought pain to my throat. I really can't tolerate ""Old Mud"". Frankly this is one of the worst beers I have had. Please stay away from it."
"Notes: As close to not having much flavour at all, oddly it was not that bad going down compared to other cheap American lagers. This is the stuff to get when you only have a couple bucks in your pocket … good to have every once in a while to get the flavour of cheap lager and realize that there are so many great beers out there other than this."
"This beer was a pale yellow color and had very little white head and no lace. An aroma of grain and alcohol. The flavor was of grain and alcohol. The body is extremely light and the finish mostly just bite. Okay, this has to be the most popular cheap beer that me and my friends used to pickup and what some of my older friends still try to bring over on occasion. If your going to go cheap, you might as well pick this over things like Miller."
"This beer has a very strange aftertaste.  For some reason, that taste can best be described as ""tin"".  I believe it interracts with the can to form this taste.  A watery beverage, that to be honest, wasn't that good.  I think you must be over 60 to drink this beer as that is all I ever see buy it in the stores."
"old mil has a bit more body and character than typical mass produced lagers....it doesn't have that awful adjunt odor and has some malt body and a bit of restrained hop flavor...it goes down well and i'd rather drink it straight out of the bottle rather than pour it into a glass.  all that said.....reviewing american lagers is boring and more time should be spent pounding them rather than reviewing them so i'm off to do my duty."
"Mineral and salty, with a harsh finish that passes for hops.  Tastes like some sort of medicine to clean out your colon (which is does pretty effectively, too)."
