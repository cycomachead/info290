"Not a bad beer to just sit around and drink."
"its wet and beer, nothing more."
""
"Has craft brewing ruined the party?  Check out the legendary ""Bros"" rating. 80. Yup 80. Why? How could they? Is it because Miller High Life is, was, and always will be the best party beer on the market?  You can bet your only can of ""Heady Topper"" it is.  Try drinking 12 cans of Heady Topper. I guarantee you will puke. Not so with High Life. Light, crisp, slight hop taste with a wet finish. Easily put away 12 of these babies with no sickness or bloated feeling. No headache. High Life deserves more credit. It taught us all how to drink beers."

"pretty good beer to party with if u dont have that much cash"
"I have always liked Miller High Life.  It is pretty refreshing and crisp but not completely tasteless.  It is nothing special but pretty good for an adjunct lager."

"Best out of all the cheap shitty beers"
"Crisp, easy to drink.  Much better than Bud Light."
"This is OK in bottles. Almost undrinkable in cans"
""
"For a Pilsner I find this beer good, much better than most american beers.  I think if people did a blind taste test they would rate it higher."
"If this is the high life, end me now."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It would not be hard to drink a 6 pack of these. One of my preferred AALs and one of the best quality beers for the price."
""
""
"A good beer to drink just to relax, get drunk or just to party with."
""
""
""
""
"Has maybe the best head and lacing of an American Lager I've tasted. A quality beer especially considering the value price point. Not fancy but solid."
""
"Good in bottles bad in cans. You cant go wrong with this beer, its cheap and good."
""
"It smells like metal , dead skunk with a chemical taste to it... man color like piss....flat taste like water, no wonder its so cheap"
""
"Good for the price. It is highly carbonated so it makes you burp alot."
""
""
"One of the best cheap party beers out there. My go-to for quantity over quality is a tie between this and yuengling."
""
"This Shit is legit. Seriously."
"A golden oldie. Grew up in the 70's and every other beer is compared to it. Nothing special or pretentious about but takes you back like you are meeting an old friend. Would say probably the best value beer or the one I want on a hot summer day."
"I have enjoyed this for too long, as in it was frequently stolen from my dad. I think that it is very refreshing, has a cool look to the bottle and is carbonated well enough so it doesn't seem to go skunky and flat as many others in it's class do. I have outgrown it, but will take one without hesitating if you hand it to me, unless there are roofiies in it or LSD or urine. Anything else is cool.."
"Not the champagne of beers..."
""
""
""
""
"I guess it is what it is"
""
"The look and feel scores apply to the bottled. I always pour my beer into a glass but for Miller High Life I drink straight from the bottle and it's the only exception I make. Tastes the same now as it did when I was a kid. Retro look. Retro feel. So-so taste but on hot summer days this is a five straight across the board."
""
""
"Good beer to have a couple, but more than that usually leaves me much more bloated than with other beers. Must be all the carbonation, definitely the Champagne of Beers."
"Better taste than Miller Lite."
""
""
"This stuff sucks. That is about it."
"On par with the other BMC flagship brands, although this one does have a slight skunky aspect."
"Very early in my driniking (the 80's) I moved away from this choice to find other ""less-worse"" offerings. Thet weren't much better."
"A honest beer at a tasty price.  When low on doe, this is as good as it gets."
""
""
""
""
""
"it is what it is"
"An American Classic. So great."
"A great value American Adjunct!"
"Delicious beer but it gets heavy to drink towards the end, and old"
""
""
""
""
"This beer is really good."
"A good throwback beer.  Drinkable & flavorful."
""
""
"Nothing wrong with cracking one of these open after a hard day of work."
""
"Problem is, it is watery, and swill-y, and has a metallic taste to it.  Also some dirty corn/ grain flavors."
"Little surprised by this one."
""
""
""
"Tasted great in fishbowl at Mario's Fishbowl in Morgantown, West By God Virginia!"
""
"Shitty beer nothing more to say"
"Way to carbonated. No real taste. Mostly feels like water. Would not drink again."
"Cheap beer, I find myself buying it a lot in 30 racks"
"Hey its my fav cheap American beer. Definitely living the high life"
""
"I drank a lot of this back in 2007. Because I just turned 21. And college. And it cost about five cents for a 30-rack. It's not my favorite dirt-cheap lager any more, but it still holds a place in my heart. It tastes like sweet corn and nostalgia."
"Horrible mouth feel. Drinkable but not pleasant."
""
""
""
""
"The carbonation is the real gimmick of this beer, which just makes it extra easy to chug. When this beer is ice cold there are few better. Very pleasing to the palette, but its GOTTA BE BOTTLED! When you have it canned, you miss a little of the effervescence. This is right up there with Grain Belt Nordeast as the best AAL. Nothing that will blow you away but you could have 20 of these at a cookout and not feel full. I'm craving one right now."
"Look is typical of American adjacent lagers. Smell is if metallic copper and iron with hits of stale grain. Taste is even worse at first you get dank grains then taken by overpowered metallic funk. This stuff tastes like a result of a bar fight, just metallic blood and left over beer. Feel is very much like champagne like the name suggests. Overall is terrible. I would have to be very sloshed to drink this and not want to punch a stranger from the funky twang it leaves in your mouth."
""
"It's the ""Champagne of Beers"" !!! What else is there to say ??!!"
""
"Obviously you don't want to buy this if your looking for a beer drinking experience, but for an inexpensive brew that is a known quantity, you can do worse."
""
"For the price, this is a solid beer. A little over-carbonated and skunky, but what you are paying for is what you get in this instance. It is really not a bad deal."
"Miller high life is a very good starting light beer"
""
""
""
"The High Life is a drinking beer, not terribly bad"
""
""
""
""
""
"Middle of the road for AAL. Head dissipated to an ugly river foam like quality, while the Pabst I had poured next to it retained a creamy dense head. I also chose Pabst 3 for 3 blind taste testing the two. High Life was not bad, just not great."
""
""
""
""
"Ok, so it looks like piss. Well, that makes it correct for the style. It smells like rotting hay and chemicals. Again, correct for the style. I'm not sure I can detect much taste. It's good on a hot day. It is a watery swill that glides down my binge drinking throat. I love this beer. It is like your first girlfriend that you fingered under the bleachers at a school PEP fest. Yeah, she looks pretty bad by today's standards, but I prefer to fondly remember faint memories while I erase the current..."

"O.K., IT'S EASY TO BE SNOBBISH AND DUMP ON THIS BEER. IT'S NOTHING SPECIAL - GRANTED. IT IS MY CHOSEN 'EVERYDAY' BEER, THOUGH. IT'S VERY ECONOMICAL - A 30 PACK RUNS AROUND $12.50. IT'S EASY DRINKING, AND, ICE COLD ON A HOT SUMMER DAY, IT'S HARD TO BEAT. FORMERLY, I HAD BEEN DRINKING BUD FOR YEARS, BUT I DECIDED THAT HIGH LIFE HAS A SMOOTHER FINISH. I WOULDN'T CALL IT THE 'CHAMPAGNE' OF BOTTLED BEER, MAYBE THE 'WINE SPRITZER'. THIS BRAND HAS BEEN AROUND FOR WELL OVER 100 YEARS, THOUGH, SURVIVING A PROHIBITION WHICH KILLED OFF THOUSANDS OF BEERS AND BREWERIES. SO, EVEN IF YOU DON'T CARE FOR IT YOURSELF, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT - IT'S A SURVIVOR."

"I don't much like it. It's got decent body and flavor, but it has a sweetness aftertaste I really don't like. Fruity palate, that's for sure. Perhaps drinkable by you, I will give it a pass every time. Do not care for Miller's flavor choices."
""
"For what it is, this beer is enjoyable.  My friend jokingly used it as a palate cleanser during a big stout tasting last night, and it was actually a very refreshing change of pace.  I'm now thinking of throwing this, or something similar, into my drinking rotation from time to time."
""

"And that's fine by me."

"still.cheap beer does have its place...sometimes."
"Used to be one of my favorites and the go to beer. Light yellow. Very heavily carbonated. A little skunky but good. A little sweet and a little bitter. Ok beer but leaves a weird dry grainy film in my mouth"

"Not half bad as far as AALs go. Clear, pale golden served in its familiar clear glass bottle at Texas Chili Parlor in Austin, TX. Light bodied, fizzy, somewhat sweetly malty, but without some of the harsher off flavors of its brethren. Smooth, crisp and refreshing. Just right with a bowl of red."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It says it right on the label- the champagne of beer. You get all the effervescence and character of a fine champagne with the drinkability and flavor of a light Pilsner. High enough abv to drink all day, but classy enough to impress a date. High-life truly has it all."

"Great beer for the money. Picked up a 6 pack of 16oz cans for $4.88 at my local walmart. Perfect for hot days like many have said. I just wish miller lite was this cheap."
""
"Overall: Hard to beat a beer that is easy on the wallet and easy to drink. $14 gets you a 30-cans pack which is more than double for the same price as imports. Has a nasty aroma but after few sips it goes away. Very easy to drink, especially with snacks."

"High Life is an odd one for me. When you start drinking a nice fresh cold one, it is pretty solid and easy to drink. Nice crisp flavor. Nothing wrong with it. As it warms up though, it becomes pretty bad. Not ""warm"" warm, but basically as warm as the bottom of the bottle tends to be when you get down there. Luckily, they make grenades, those 7 ounce bottles, and this helps with that. I do prefer them in the smaller packaging, however, even in 12 ounce form they are cheap enough to dump out the last 2 or 3 ounces so its not a big deal."

"While I'm usually a craft drinker and primarily an import drinker before craft, sometimes I want a lighter tasting. lower abv beer, especially on a hot summer day after doing some yard work.  High Life is my go to for that.  The better version comes from the can, not the clear bottle.  It pours a nice golden yellow with a decent head that lingers for a couple of minutes, nice lacing.  It's somewhat sweet to the taste.  There is nothing offensive at all going on with the aroma, taste or mouthfeel, no off notes. Nothing exciting going on either  but it is a very drinkable brew for the type of beer it is."

"Keep in mind i'm rating this a 5 because i'm new to beer and this is the best out of what i have had. I don't really know what to describe the taste like, just kind of like... corn? sweet. I drink this because i didnt have a job and was not able to buy more expensive things. I have read however this has won the gold medal for best american style lager several times. I think i know why they call this the high life though. It makes you feel like you are living the high life due to the taste and quality for the price. Their advertising campaigns hit the nail on the head. This is a testament to working men and women. I got paid my first paycheck recently and i bought some of this, and i felt like i was  drinking in style. This is better quality in my opinion than budweiser and its cheaper. There is a reason it rated highly in  american adjunct lagers, as you categorize them on the site. Apparently the Alstrom brothers on this site agree with me. They gave it an 81. I think miller is the best out of the as you guys on the site call them the macro brews. Whether its fishing or a barbeque or fourth of july party this  goes good with anything. I love this with a nice Hamburger and steak fries."

"Overall (3.29) : Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. This beer isn't out to compete against crafts, it's meant to be a working man's beer after a long day in the sun. For that purpose it does just fine. High Life is a tasty treat, abundant with corn. If you hate corn or corn-based beers, stay away! Very adjunct-y, mildly sweet, absolute zero bitter. No hops. This is one of my favorite beers because it's so cheap and it's still tasty. Where else can you get an 18 pack of bottles for $10 or a 30 pack of cans for $15? Or a 24 oz. for $1.49 for that matter??? Long live High Life!"

"Yes, it is not ""good"" beer. But it is also extremely cheap, and very drinkable. Make sure it is cold; really cold. This is my beer of choice when I am doing yard work. Better than its competition."
""
""

""
""
"Frankly if I go to an event where only AAL's are being served, I hope I can find this swimming in the bottom of the ice chest.  The color is pale straw with a big but fleeting head that gives way to minimum lacing.  The smell and taste are both dominated by adjuncts, but if cold enough the flavor is tolerable.  The carbonation level is good and the beer does feel rich in your mouth.  Overall one of the best in a generally poor class."
""
""
"Overall: For an AAL this is actually pretty far up there for me- one of the best in the style. A very refreshing, unadulterated beer for weather when it's hotter than hell and you just want something quaffable. I would NEVER get this in a format other than a can considering the clear bottle."

"Not much can be said about this beer. Its a cheap beer. But in my opinion it is way better than Pabst, which for some reason has become cool to drink over the last decade or so. As far as cheap beers go, this is in my opinion among the best. Not that I am saying its a spectacular beer, but if you want a cold ""beer"" like your grandfather drank, this is the one I would go for. You can often find a 12 pack on sale for around $6-7. It is what it is, nothing spectacular, but drinkable."

"Overall: American adjunct pale lagers need to be reviewed in their own terms, similar to the way the great Roger Ebert (RIP) used to review B-movies. If you compare this beer to a Belgian lambic or a graduate-degree level IPA, you're basically comparing Evil Dead to a Polanski film or something. They don't serve the same purpose, nor should they be judged by the same measuring stick. Now that those cards are on the table, I drank this High Life with hot dogs and watermelon while watching baseball. Perfect afternoon. It's not my favorite American budget lager - I'd certainly take 'Gansett or Pabst over this - but it's certainly better than Budweiser, and it's better than a poorly executed complex beer."

"O - If I've been mowing on Sunday (good beer is only had in liquor stores here and they aren't open on Sunday) this is my go-to.  It's really not horrible, but there's just no comparison to a good helles.  If someone told me there were hops used in this beer, I may or may not believe them."

"This is a palate-cleanser beer, and near-perfect swig after a hot day of yard work. It's meant for eating with a greasy burger, a juicy steak and mashed potatoes, or BBQ pork. Its bubbly carbonation and light body cut through all this and leave you refreshed for the next bite. Or renewed for the next outdoor activity. And that's all some beer is supposed to be."

"Look, this stuff is the america beer for broke folks. Im not going to lie. Heck ive been to the point where my local walmart was selling this stuff near the price of budweiser, and yes it was because budweiser was on sale. Im not going to say hate this beer, but for some reason it is so hard to kill, its like putting ur mouth up to a drain full of piss and saying "" Damn this stuff acutally gets you drunk"" It should be less than 9.79 a 12 pack. I understand the nice bottles, and the hot little blondie we all wish we could of Fuked in highschool was on the bottle but still its not that great of a beer. Would i buy it more? Probably not, because this beer makes me want to work overtime so i can get good beer. I love this beer thou still, cause it can provide me with a cheap buzz, and its better than keystone light, and coor by far. So im so undecide on what to go to. I guess all i can say is quit drinking and save ur money for some good stuff. Then you will appreciate beer more. I waste all my money on beer, and i suffer to drink this like you know who as well. Good luck, and god bless America :)"

""
""
"This is buy far the best beer for your money. Tastes great though maybe not less filling that high life lite. you can't beat that its tastes good and I only pay 7.99 for a 12ver of bottles. Not enough people appreciate a good crisp clean american lager. i poo on the beer snobs."
""
"Overall: This is a highly underrated beer. If looking for 40oz that pairs well with fish, chicken, or vegetarian meal, look no further than Miller High Life. Looking for a gateway beverage between malt liquor and craft beer? Grab a High Life 40. The semi-sweetness of the malt is very well balanced with the burn of the alcohol, making this one of the most drinkable 40's available."

"You have to drink this beer many times to really appreciate it because it is so unique compared to other beers out there today. This is a unique take on old school American lager beer. This beer brand has been around since 1903. Before it was called High Life it was just called Miller Beer dating back to the mid nineteenth century. High Life is one of the best values in the beer world. It costs $7.99 a twelve pack all over town. This used to be Miller's flagship brand (think Budweiser or Coors Banquet) until they decided to abandon it for MGD. Now it is a budget beer like Busch or Rolling Rock. It is just as drinkable as those beers, but it has more character. That character can be off-putting if you fail to understand what you are really drinking. This is an adjunct lager. This in the granddaddy of adjunct lagers. It has corn in it. That is the style. For a corn beer this is very good. It is meant for ice cold drinking. You do not slowly sip one of these at a time at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. You drink several of these at a time... ice cold. That is the High Life. For that purpose this beer is outstanding. The value is there. The taste is there. The approachability is there. Comparable to PBR and similar brews."

"Pours a pale, transparent straw yellow color, with a fizzy/foamy white head. The aroma is the expected grassy, musty hops over a lightly sweet malt base. The flavor is largely driven by sweet, grainy malts and a bit of a sweet corn character, although the dull, musty hops can be identified as well. As with most in this style, the light body and fizzy carbonation help this one go down easy, but it has more substance/body than others. In this regard, this beer is not much different than the other mass-produced adjunct lagers, but it doesn't come across as so watery and bland as others. Overall, its a fine beer to wash down a hot dog or any other situation where you just need a dumb beer, but it's certainly not something to crave and savor."

"Poured into an English pint glass. Minimal head, appears a bright clear yellow color. Smell is not inviting. The taste is ok upfront but has an unpleasant after taste (Metallic). Can't detect any good flavors taste-wise, it's pretty watery. I would not choose to drink this beer for any reason other than price."
""

""

"If you can get passed the sweet corn flavor, then it is better than Budweiser. It definitely stands above Coors however, with both using corn as an adjunct."
""
""
""
""
"for a long time i didn't know ""the champagne of beers"" meant it was extra frothy and bubbly but i always liked the nice buzz and the taste in those 12 ounce bottles ice cold the taste is awesome like over carbonated unsweetened black tea and it leaves a nice flavor to marinate in your mouth i haven't had one of theses in a while i think i might pick one up tomorrow for 2 bucks a 32 you can make another trip to the store"

"Overall: This beer is ok, but very plain. It tastes the closest to a light beer (i.e. very close to plain water) of any macro lager I have tried yet."
"This has been my favorite American macro for many years. Smell is light (btw, I can't smell things that well). Nice head leaves a lot of lacing in it's wake. It's hard to nail down in words why it's so good. A robust flavor; characterized mostly by corn, light malt, and grain. Highly carbonated. Nice dry finish with no aftertaste. Tastes like beer!"
"O: A bit harsh in the mouth. this is an awesome stepping stone beer. Yo, teens, skip the Bud/Miller/Coors brigade and start with this one. Pretty awesome AAL."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall it is what it is. Run of the mill american adjunct lager with minimal redeeming qualities. Not sure I could pick this out in a lineup."
""
"I drank this from a tall boy purchased from a 7-11 in a rash decision. However, I do really like High Life. It's great to bring to parties and it's always cheap. It has that classic American Golden tan and just the right amount of flavor to suffice. It's light and airy so it quenches your thirst pretty well. Great for outings, hikes, parties, or just lounging around."
"Overall: Maybe it was because I was in a good mood, but this beer surprised me. It was clean tasting without any odd metallic elements like a lot of cheap beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty average beer, from a macrobrewer and for the price I will say its an OK beer and one I do drink in college because of it."

"This beer was actually quite pleasant. Had no off flavors, no fruitiness at all and drank easily and without effort. It did not develop any off flavors as it warmed. It leaves a touch of sweetness as it finishes dry."
""
""
"This one receives a lot of hate, but it really is a decent beer for the style that it is. Unoffensive flavors, easy drinking."
"The hipster in me really wants to like Miller High Life, but it is no means the champagne of beers. Each time I somehow end up drinking it, I just can't get over a weird musty flavor that this beer has. When I have it in a can, it does oddly taste slightly better than bottled, but still gross. If I'm going to go for a super cheap beer, I think I'm going to stick with PBR or Schlitz, since they have actual decent flavor compared to this swill."

"O: It's literally the middle of the pack as far as AAL goes. There is some redeming qualities to these brews, but the ones that have that chalky finish and skunky nose just kill it for the rest that might be decent."

"I brought a 24 oz can from a local bodega. I usually drink craft but I decided to give the champagne of beers a try. I poured it into a wine glass and was surprised. It's golden hue and bubbly carbonation makes it look like champagne. Other than that there is nothing special about its appearance. It smells rather sweet, probably due to corn or other adjunct. When it came to taste, I was pleasantly surprised. I can actually taste a mild hop character. This paired with its smoothness makes for a easy drinking beer. While it is not my first choice, I would choose over other American macro brew."

"I sometimes have one because of its placement in the Back to the Future films. And apparently I need to type 250 characters, so I will say this: Why does Biff complain about the McFlys only having lite beer when he's at their house? I guess the product placement was for the entire Miller line"

"This is the champagne of beers - and for good reason. This is the beer of choice for folks that just want to drink beer. Those that want a beer that tastes like a double latte with 1 shot of vanilla, 1/2 shot of hazelnut, and light foamy milk, should try one of the microbeers in your area. However, at its current price point, packaging, and taste, you cannot go wrong bringing a 6 pack of high lifes to your best friend's bbq."

"I don't really know anymore. Somehow this doesn't taste like complete shit to me. I was more bothered by this when I was about 20-21 but now I find lager yeast hints. Leaves you wishing for more and lacks anything all that enjoyable."
""
"This is the only AAL that I can say I enjoy. While there is nothing special about it, there is also nothing offensive. For me, the mouthfeel is smooth and almost creamy, which is what makes this one for me. It's also cheaper than its bud, coors, miller counterparts."

"Miller High is brewed by Miller. The Champagne of Beer. Been around since 1903. Pours out a Amber Color. This brew has a white head that says. The Smell is that of an american style beer. The taste is nothing special but it ok. Nothing bad, but nothing good. Overall, I give this a 3- not good ,but not bad. I may get this brew to switch it up from the Budweiser products every once in awhile."

"Don't think too much about it. Not very complex but definitely sweeter honey feel than other American lagers. My go to for cheap American lagers."

""
"But in all actuality, I like the taste of Miller High Life. I do, and I apologize not for finding my taste receptors enjoy a Miller every now and again and even twist a grinder of chunky sea salt on a hot summer day or on a frozen winter one, too, enhancing this old American standard beer, much like a mustard smeared pretzel and good talk among long friends does."
""
""
"Good tailgater, good summer time beer, worth a shot but as usual with anything other than craft beers, Beer snobs should avoid."
" I still cant find Schlitz, or Blatz wherever I might stop in, but almost everyplace carries High Life. This was $9.99 for a 18pk of bottles, not bad. I know clear bottles get a bad wrap, but I like the High Life bottle shape, and looking at this decent American beer."

"Typical American adjunct lager smell if that is what your type of beer, very soapy head on it. The mouthfeel is prickly with carbonation but very smooth. Its actually not the corn/veggie aftertaste that miller usually puts out. Im actually surprised. For what it is, A.A.L i could get youst to buying this and drinking it on a daily basis. Plus the price is about 17.99 USD for a 30 pack."

"One of my favorite cheap, poor mans beer. When im low on cash and need some beer i always come back to high life. A 12 pack of bottles for $8.50 is a bargain! When i first turned drinking age this was my choice beer and thought it was great. I mean its still decent.... once ive had about 3-4 beers... Decent economy beer."

"O- This is my go to 'cheap' beer. Overall it's not THAT bad of a product. It does exactly what I want it to at the right price. It gets easier to drink after one or two, but there's a good reason for that. If I'm having several different beers or going out, I have to remember to use a palate cleanser after this one, as it diminishes the taste of everything after it."

"There's definitely better beer out there, but there's most certainly worse. High Life is not a beer you should be ashamed to serve your buddies or drink on the couch at home. It's a great cheap alternative to other beers in its price range and knocks some of them straigh out of the park. Just don't expect a fantastic dissolution in your mouth, you will be disappointed and probably grossed out."

"Pours a golden color with some head, which disappears very quickly. Head leaves some lacing. Smell is almost entirely absent. Taste is pretty crisp but empty. Carbonation is not overpowering but provides more to the taste than the malt and hops. Thin mouthfeel is mildly bubbly. Somewhat bitter and rotten after taste."

"I can't believe I never rated this. Alright, this is the low brow class of beers, but I tend to make this my 'go-to' water beer. However I do enjoy the maltiness and carbonation of this beer. There is a consistency for this beer that makes me think it is very good value for the money. Now am I a sucker for the marketing and schtick of the 'champagne' ads? Oh hell yeah. I like it a lot, but also think this is a good beer, that shouldn't be the ugly sister of their Bud Lite and Coors Lite competition."

"O: I love the fact that I found this one in a 32 oz. can... Actually this is not as offensive as some of the other BMC offerings as it actually has some flavor and is drinkable.

"Poured a clear yellow with a thin, foamy head. It looks like a bad AAL. Scents of lager yeast and maize, mostly maize. Maybe a bit of malt in there, but I couldn't really make it out. This carried over into the taste. Some yeast, a lot of maize, a hint of bready malt, but not much, a hint of hops and a hit of alcohol on the finish. Why is that in a lager? Even in an AAL? It's standard, but that alcohol hit is an unwelcome change from the overall mediocrity of the rest of the taste. Mouthfeel was light bodied, with high carbonation. Standard for the style, the same as any other. Overall it's a standard AAL, held back from mediocrity and thrust into somewhat bad territory by a weird alcohol presence and a low hop character. It's not worth going back to for sure."

"I became very familiar with this 20 years ago as it was / is my wife's families goto beer for any group get together. It is just good enough (in bottles) for me to shlep around. The long neck 24 case boxes go on sale here so it is a lower cost beverage. The taste comes across as slightly burned corn. You must drink it quick, as it turns quickly if left alone. Best served very cold, by a campfire."

"Drank ALOT of this in my formative years...aahhh, the glorious results of a misspent youth! Pouring into a tall Pilsner brings up a frothy foamy white head with surprisingly nice lacing, the beer itself is pale yellow and crystal clear. I get corn sweetness with a whiff of Lager aroma. Mouthfeel is typical macro Lager: thin, kinda watery with pinprick bubbly carbonation due to the cold serving temp. Some corn/grass/hay flavor...verrry little in the way of hop bitterness to balance things out. Finshes sweet/watery...but you know what you're getting when you have this. Almost cuts it on a hot late Spring day here at the shore. An ok 'lawn mower'/refreshing type beer."

"Me and my brother bought a 12 pack a couple months back, and I have got to say this is By far one of the worst beers I've come across, I typically like cheap beer too but this tasted like piss mixed with rat poison, It does have a good pilsner look, the smell is of sulfer (atleast it was when I bought it) its taste was terrible, far too much carbonation, mouthfeel, like I previously stated way to carbonated, overall I'd drink this beer if you bought me one, but thats the only time I would, never going to buy this sludge again."

"Miller High Life is a beer I used to drink often. like many folks, I switched to a Lite beer. After a few years of swilling various brands of light beer, I found myself at a place that sold out of Lite. So I ordered a High Life. Boy-oh-boy was it good. I had forgotten just how good a real beer tasted. Since I never drink more than two brews when I am driving, I always order Miller High Life now. ""The Champagne of Bottled Beers", it is as true now as it ever was. it tastes like real beer."

"Haters gonna hate, but in my humble opinion, this is the only mass produced American beer worth drinking. I wouldn't pair it with food, and in fact, I wouldn't want to be stuck drinking this except on special occasions. Those occasions are this: when you are really hot and just finished mowing the grass. When you go to the beach with a couple of friends and light a bonfire. And on those occasions, trust me, it's a winner. Feel free to ban me from ever writing another review now..."

"Gotta give my thoughts on one of my father's favorite beers. It pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of white froth. The nose comprises wispy lemon peel, lightly-funky wheat, wild rice, and hard water. The taste goes straight for hard water diluted with musty grain and the lightest bit of brown grass possible. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation, a watery feel, and a crisp finish. Overall, a decidedly meek little beer, one that makes me wonder why straight tap water wouldn't be a better (and more thirst-quenching) option."
"O: Should be called low life or no life, a cheap beer such as this is a depressing and ironic interpretation of the "" high life", why get the hopes up of the people that have to drink cheap beer. Wouldn't have this again"

"I thought this beer was fairly decent, but nothing that I would drink all of the time. It had a good taste and ok smell to it.

This is the type of beer that my dad and grandpa would drink, but not really my favorite."

"Lets all be honest here, there is nothing special about this beer. This is as average as a beer gets. This beer isnt great/ideal but its not a bad beer either.

As far as flavor, it's crisp and refreshing with a lot of carbonation. The taste is decent. It certainly isn't anywhere near the best, but I wouldn't rule it out."

"Miller High Life claims to be the champagne of beers? Is it true? Let's find out. Pick up a 30 pack of this and a 30 pack of regular Miller Lite for a party. I first drank the Miller Lite, they tried one of these for the first time. It's your average lager yellow with no real smells to speak off with the typical carbonation. But the taste...The taste, For the type of beer it is was wonderful. Sooo easy to drink, sooo smooth. And it was a steal at $16 for the 30. It's a nice change here and there from my usual Pabst, Although Pabst will always have a special place in my heart. I had some of this, however in the Light version, Along with Colt 45 the first time I had ever gotten drunk and I strongly preferred it to the others in the cooler. And this even beats out the Light edition. Wish I would have known about this stuff as a teenager, Would have wasted less money on Bud Light"
""
"Overall – This is one of the best examples that this style has to offer. MHL is a good beer at a good price. Although it puts up with a lot of slanderous comments, I don’t think there is a thing wrong with this brew when you factor in its’ limitations. And at $1 a pint? Seriously? I would buy it and I will drink it again for sure."

"Pours a crystal clear yellow with a 1/2 inch foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grain, corn flakes, and some sugar-like aromas. Taste is of grain and sweetened corn flakes. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer but not as bad as I was expecting it to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel...isn't bad. Light for what I like but not terribly light, even almost verging toward medium in the light body. Crispness is there but not overly spritzy. There's even a little smoothness."
"Overall, recommended if you're on a budget or hosting a party that may consist of folks that are simply not on your level of sophistication."

"For whatever reason, Miller High Life out of the bottle seems, by my judgment, much less flavorful and more subdued than when I drink from, or out of, a can. It's still a good beer, but I think I'd prefer it from the can, which is opposite from my usual preference for other beers."

"O- well, it sucks, typical AAl, tastes like corn water, smells like gym socks."
""
"The body is a clear golden yellow with a fluffy white head. Loads of visible carbonation. I drank mine from the can, but others at this backyard shindig poured theirs into a glass. The aroma is of corn and grains, maybe a little green apple. The flavor profile mimics the nose. Green apple skins, corn starch, and grains. Extremely bland, lacking any real flavors. Light-bodied, high carbonation. This is probably a little more palatable than others in its style, but it is still not very desireable."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours straw color like any other adjunct lager, with a bubbly head that dissipates quickly, but with some lacing. Smells of adjunct grain, especially corn, really sweet. Sweet malty taste dominates, probably from the corn used, but actually has taste unlike many adjuncts. This light bodied beer has full taste, can go down really easily, and is not over carbonated. Overall, an average beer, but better than most adjuncts."
""

"Official beer of me. WORD!"
"Overall: This beer does the job time after time after time. Nothing to write home about but nothing to turn my nose up too, and the price is always right."
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'm not too fond of this beer.. lol"
""
""
"A boring beer with just enough taste to make it palatable, somewhere between a light and adjunct lager in taste and body. While not a beer I would refuse if offered, this is also not something I would imbibe of my own volition. Quite simply there are better beers in the same price range or cheaper."
""
"Overall- For a classic American adjunct lager I must say that it is difficult to complain about this one. It's been around since my grandfather was born and he probably drank it out of a bottle with a pacifier instead of milk as an infant. Hell, for $3.99 a six, and the significant amount of quality time I enjoyed drinking it, I'd have to say, ""It's Miller Time!"" ... even though I enjoy brewing my own beer as well. This is good 'in-between' beer. What can I say? :)"

"Poured a pint can into a glass mug. Pours pale yellow with a towering, white head. The head does dissipate, but it leaves a nice cap on top with some lacing around the edge. There are plenty of bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass. The smell is of malt and corn. There is some mild hop aroma as well, but it's hard to detect. The flavors of grainy barley malt and slightly sweet corn are the dominant flavors. The hops are very mild. The body is light and it is abundantly carbonated. It's crisp and refreshing. This beer is very easy to drink. Overall, this is a solid adjunct lager that is good for a tailgate, a fishing trip, a picnic, or just for a nice summer day when you have the barbecue pit going. For the price, you can't go wrong with this beer."

"Final Grade: 3.09, in the C+ range. This stuff is apparently available in Canada, though I have never actually seen it advertised anywhere, and if it's anything like MGD it's probably too expensive to be worth it anyway. That being said, I could see myself picking up some of this at the duty free the next time I return from a Stateside trip. I'd certainly take this over many Canadian macros."

"What do you do when 75 cent busch light bottles run out? replace them with miller high life. Looks better than regular BMC products and smells slightly more citrusy as well, but far from good. tastes old and stale which is somewhat of a let down but overall it's doable. Follow your normal ""free beer"" rules with this. I wouldn't even do beer pong or tailgate with this beer."

"Pretty decent for an American schwag beer. Definitely my go to when trying to keep it econo, especially with the price of Mexi beers, which have skyrocketed in San Diego over the past 5 years (???). Good for tailgating and all day drinking on a hot summer day. Get rid of the nasty cleanser flavor that is so consistent with this one, and you've got a pretty darn good American Lager. Until then though, pretty average."

"O: I can understand why people drink this stuff. Its super easy to drink, not much flavor so it doesnt offend and its easy on the wallet. I have had a lot of bad beers in my life, but I would say that this is actually one of the better adjunct beers."
""
""
"O - Another easy drinking macro. I don't understand why people find these so offensive. If anything they are the exact opposite. Bland, low in alcohol and easy to know back and entire six pack. This is one of the better ones in my opinion. And cheaper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I personally would not purchase this beer, not to knock on Miller but I do drink before I look anything up and this is nothing crazy, no need to disrespect but if you consider yourself a beer connoisseur you have to be a low life to like the ""High Life"". Salud!"

""
"Dad's beer. Classic clear bottle. Great label. Not much nose. ""Beery"" taste. Clean. Probably the best mouthfeel among all American adjuncts. Sudsy. Good old fashioned beer. I like it. It reminds me of how things were in the 60's. I would keep a few bottles in the fridge at all times."

"""champagne of beers"" poured into flute. Looks like cheap champagne, soapy head gone at 2nd glance. Not ugly, but watery, clear w/ slight gold tint. Smell is bare, with faint sweet malts. Taste isn't terrible, not much to speak of though just a sweetness and alcohol burn. Bubbly, kinda watery but drinkable"

"This might be a popular choise for say college students because it is cheap. By no means do I think it is that good just a less expensive knock off than miller lite. Hops are non existant faint taste of corn. Easy to drink beer. Poor choice unless you are looking for a cheap and easy drunken binge. nothing great"
""
"Overall, its great among the adjunct lagers. Its cheap for a 32 ounce container also. If you want to just get drunk but without drinking a nasty beer, this one is good. I like it but its not something that I drink all the time as I like a robust character lager. If you like any of the adjunct lager, try this one. Its a slight step above the rest."
"I'm sure almost everyone knows what the American adjunct lagers are all about. This one has more to offer than some I've had. For double the price, even (e.g. Heineken)."
""
""
""
""
""
"I rarely drink adjunct lagers, but when I do, I prefer High Life. It's affordable and still reasonably tasty! Got some left over from a party I threw the other night, so why not throw a review up here. You know what color this is. Golden. It pours with a two finger head and has an actual reasonable amount of lacing. Smell is some harsh corn, bready notes, and that ""wet dog"" thing I always get from these brews. The taste is actually quite reasonable for the style, it goes down very easily with just a bit of corn mineral taste, then finishes with a bready aftertaste. Just enough taste to remind you it's a beer. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and very brisk. C'mon, it's the champagne of beers! Overall, I really like High Life, for what it is. As a cheap ""staple"" beer, it's really easy to do worse. It'll handily beat out most common ""import"" lagers (Corona, Stella, you know what kinda beers I'm talking about) at a third the price."

"Session beer? Look no further. All the HIpsters may love their PBR until their dying day but that just means that there's more of this for me. Everyone has their guilty pleasure and this is mine. Champagne tends to go down easily and effortlessly and that's the case with this too. Some of us know the deal that comes with living the High Life and we're ok with that - there's a good reason why this has been around for over a century!"

"O - Not bad for an adjunct lager. Nothing really bad about it but nothing really good either. Serve cold."
"T: While it might not be as bad as some of the adjuncts out there, it's far from being good. Has a strange breadiness towards the finish that was pretty nasty. Better than Bud Light, but doesn't top too much else."
"O: Well, it's not Bud Light but it's pretty bad. The smell alone makes me not want to drink it. If you want ""great pilsner taste"" try Warsteiner Premium Verum or Pilsner Urquell. I drank about half of it before drainpouring the rest. Even if it's cheap, I'd rather have a lower quantity of something decent than this. Not recommended."
"The commercials for Miller High Life are awesome. The beer is not quite as good as the commercials, best way to describe it is servicable. The beer pours yellow/golden clear with big carbonation and bubblely head to start, then it fades. The smell and taste are common to all american adjunct lagers....wheat/barley/grain with balance of hops. The mouthfeel of this beer is fine....it beer....no out of the ordinary flavors to twangs. Overall its a good session beer."
"Cheers!"
"Of course, the real question is, would you want to? I know I don't."
"High Life, the so called ""champagne of beers"" is your typical adjunct lager. Pours a pale straw color. The head dissipates into nothing after a few seconds. The liquor store near me sells these in 40's and 32 Oz cans. The taste is of corn. There is an aftertaste, which consists of corn and rice. Overall, this is my go to cheap beer."
"O: For what it is, this beer is pretty decent. It's not my first choice, but when I'm running low on funds, it'll do."
"I'm usually not a Miller guy. I find Miller Light to have an odd after taste that I've always attributed to their ""pilsner"" style, but High Life doesn't have it. It may have a small trace of it, but it balances out with the adjuncts and slight malty profile to work well."
"Overall, I would consider this a tail-gate or pizza beer. It also works well on a tight budget. Is it the best macro beer? No, that title belongs to Narragansett. Is it great bang-for-your-buck beer? You bet."
"overall, it's decent for the ""style"". If I have to choose a BMC product to drink, it's High Life"
"Dr: Very drinkable and quite cheap. You could do far worse at this price, but if you're doing budget beer for getting bollocksed I recommend High Gravity Steel Reserve."
"I will put this lager up with my other favorite macro lagers in American (Pabst and Schlitz. Clean, easy drinking lager that is perfect for hotter weather. Yes, nothing in this beer is over done. But, that is why many like it. Just clean easy drinking with no nasty after taste just good balance for the style."
"A beer with a devoted following that sometimes verges on PBR-ish irony. Its redeeming qualities are few and far between with the bottle being the best part, as I said before. Easy drinking but surprisingly filling. More flavorful than some of its peers but still a pretty flimsy flavor profile. I don't mind a High Life when I'm offered, but I don't think I've ever been in the mood for one."
"O = My summer, mowing, pool cleaning, landscaping, window installing, fence painting, house staining, deck building beer."
"It is a decent, clean brew that must be drunk cold and quick! Abalanced mix of corn,malt,hops equal a neutral taste and aroma. Recommend having it when washing down a Big Mac."
"This beer had a clear yellow color with visible carbonation and a small head that went away rather quickly. Smell was of metallic grains and corns. The taste was a bit stale with the typical watery corn flavor with inconsistent feel. Overall, this beer has the well known characteristics of your typical adjunct lager."
"p.s. 40oz to freedom"
"(D)- Back in the day, I would drink this like water. Very crisp and refreshing, though that are its only strong points."
"Tastes of corn with a slight citrus ting in the carbonation ( maybe a hint of lemon) then gives way to sweet bread, with a metallic aftertaste. Mass produced adjunct - slightly better than the others."
"I will drink this until my income increases greatly. For now, here's to living the High lIfe."
"Average macro lager to the Nth degree. Fizzy bright gold, white frothy lacing. Corn and husky grain aroma, some light mineral notes. Lightly sweet with minimal bitterness. Minor flavors of wet grain, honey, and butter crackers. Dry and crisp finish, but largely bland and inoffensive. Gaseous and fizzy carbonation, not something i'd really drink more than one or two of, unlesss circumstances dictated, such as a family wedding in this case."
"When I need to go for a macro pils, I invariably pick this one over all others. Pours a light yellowish color with a small bubbly white head that does not stick around too long. Smell is of grain and then another dose of grain. Taste is not very complex with a nice, non overpowering malt sweetness, slight hop flavor in the background and a nice crisp finish on the flavor and the mouthfeel that is refreshing on a hot day. When I don't want something too complex and just a refreshing brew on a hot day, I'll take this over any other macro any day of the week."
"The appearance is the best score because it comes in a stylish bottle. The rest is self explanatory."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, high carbonation levels. Would be very drinkable if the flavor wasn't quite so off-putting. Definitely one of the better options when it comes to adjuncts but still not something I would touch if I really had a choice."
"Champagne of Beers? Sure, why the hell not, in a market where Bud is the King of Beer, this only makes soul-killing sense. Since I didn't grow up and throw up with this particular icon, I have no such justification for giving this nostalgia points. A bland, albeit generally inoffensive all-American lager. There, lynch mob averted."
"Please pardon my french but I feel strongly about these damn bubbles."
"It's refreshing all right. The downside is there are some off-flavors that I don't like in my beer. They don't pre-dominate like in some macros, but they are there just enough to make this a weak substitute for a Victory Pils or any number of fine craft lagers one can find easily enough."
"O - If this is the champagne of beers, then it is J. Roget."
"Well for years now the lady on the moon has been my Saturady afternoon cheap beer booty call. Cannot tell if it looks better than it tastes or the other way around. Smells sweet like most straw colored beers in this style. Taste is not so bad with just enough carb to make stand out from my other swillin beers. Can drink this one all afternoon or morning for that matter! Solid beer to share with the general public."
"Miller High Life is about the same as any other American lager. To me they are all about the same. I bought a case of it to just try to save some money, and though it's not terrible, there is nothing unique or special about it. I will probably buy Yuengling if I am looking for a cheaper Lager, or even Schlitz, both have more of an interesting flavor than this beer. About the same as Bud, Coors, or any other Miller offering if you ask me, but good on a hot day, and cheap if you are pinching pennies."
"O - My beer of choice for beer pong, use it for tailgating, parties or maybe by the pool."
"It’s cheap, smooth and refreshing, but absolutely nothing special. Probably better than all of the other pale lagers I’ve tried, but would only buy because of the price and not the flavor. It is slightly sweet and smells of grains, tastes pretty much like it smells, decent aftertaste. I prefer MGD."
"I always drink Beer. It is delicious. I drink macros and micros and they all have a time and place. It's summer that means having friends over and hittin' the pool. Its hot and my names Harry and I like to party. I know for a fact that people reviewing the High Life negatively do not party. Great summer Beer. DRINK IT!"
"Yellow and full of carbonation. Big amount of fluffy, white head that turned into a thin blanket across the top. Nose is light grainy lemon and grass. Not much going on and it also smells a little sour. Taste is the same. A lot of carbonation and a sour, grainy, off lemon. Light body with a ton of carbonation. Finishes crisp and a subtle dryness. Only suitable for pounding with at a frat party/pubcrawl/beirut tournament or when there are dollar drafts."
"It's just plain-ol' beer; I could really end the review there, but I won't. The brew is a fizzy straw gold, like most beer produced on earth. The nose is just beery, with sweet corn adjunct popping out a bit, and small mineral notes. The flavor is more of the same, except that the feel and the flavor are intrinsically linked; the bright prickly nature of the brew enhances the otherwise slight flavor. Overall, average. Not as good as the draft version, which is unpasteurized."
"This is just a bad tasting beer. The commercials and 'High Life' name got me excited which is why I tried it. This was not a good idea. Miller markets this product like it's some high end beer but it tastes like an extremely below average, get-drunk-quick beer. there is no way that I could sip and enjoy this product."
"Easy to drink if you have nothing else on hand."
"The cheap alternative is my nick name for this beer. It definitely drinks easy and taste is non existent but when you want beer and you only have $4 or so. Here is your product. Are you having a party and plan on being bored, here you go. They do support the troops though and make good commercials but a beer should be more than that. How did they make this stuff, but then also make a master piece with MGD."
"O: I just like drinking the champagne of beers so if I need a pitcher of something, I like to live the high-life on occasion."
"Not the worst of the macro brews, and actually kind of tolerable with some popcorn."
"This is something I have drank plenty of at parties, etc. but when sitting down to review it I realize this isn't one of the good adjunct lagers, the main appeal for me is the price. I will still drink this in mass amounts when the time comes, but I wouldn't just choose to buy this for myself."
"O: For the price and in comparison to just about all other BMC offerings, this isn't a bad beer at all. No marketing gimmicks that drive up prices, and it doesn't taste like crap."
"So I feel they should get rid of the slogan ""Champagne of Beer"" noe that some breweries are a tually making beers with champagne yeast in them. The High Life poured out no different than it appears in the bottle. The smell of the beer is of malts and corn, the taste gives off the same flavors. The mouthfeel is very light and isn't even that refreshing. Overall for me, its a picnic beer nothing special about it. If a bee or other bugs gets caught in the can you can just throw it away without worrying. If you knock it over it's not a big deal there's like 29 more cans in the cooler. It's a non stress beer, you don't haveto worry about anything when drinkin it."
"The best way to drink High Life is straight outta the bottle as cold as possible without freezing. This beer is light and fizzy without a lot of flavor at all. There is a frightening amount of metallic chemically taste if you allow it to warm, so slug it back quick while it's cold. Not bad. If compared to other AALs, this probably falls somewhere in the middle of the pack."
"Overall: When I think of the High Life, I think of (in this order): Brother Jer, bad gas, and a case that costs half of what I usually spend. Still, Yuengling's price iss comparable, and sentimentality cannot offset the fact that this beer pairs best with popcorn and Silo cups..."
"I love this beer. Tastes crisp and refreshing especially when served cold and drank out of a bottle. This beer is a great value for the price ($16 w/o tax for 24 bottles) and it a beer I can drink all day while doing yard work, watching sports, or grilling out. Goes pretty well with any meat. The only thing that will ruin this beer is the fact that the warmer it gets, the worse it starts to taste."
"Not a very full flavor, tastes watered down and weak. It doesn't seem to hold its own, even against the water. The corn additive is the most prevelant flavor in this one, but it's weak and only ends up leaving an iffy aftertaste. Considering the bubbliness and style, I expected more carbonation that added up to a crisp and dry mouthfeel when in reality its on the creamy side. Not a good beer, but a classic in American history and everybody should at least give it a chance."
"This is a BEER that's better in bottles, got a 12 pack of bottles for 7 bucks. Not a GREAT beer, but not a bad one either. But they brew it Local, so I am supporting the economy."
"O. Overall, this is possibly the worst beer I've had in my life. I've only drank a handful of these in the past, because even in my macro brew days, I steered clear of my father's beer. The only thing this beer has going for it is the can I picked up has a pretty lady on it. Honestly, the warmer it gets, the more I get metal and corn. I believe this will be my last in my lifetime."
"Cheers..."
"Like a decent champagne it is light and refreshing due to a slightly higher carbonation. Not a chemically altered ""lite"" beer, but its not going wow you with a complex flavor. This is a basic beer for celebrating the simple victories in life, like mowing the lawn or building a deck. The oldest Miller brand. A simple beer from a simpler time."
"Definitely not a replacement for PBR. I'll drink the rest of the sixer, and would probably accept it before most of the light beers at a party, but this is definitely a pass. If you really like corny sweetness in your beer, it might be up your alley. Drink it cold, drink it fast before it warms up."
"man what a stellar example of what the champagne of beers should taste like. that was sarcasm, but this stuff aint all that bad. as you can see from the picture it is a pale yellow, with a white fizzy head. it has very little smell. slightly metalic, but you have to try really hard to get any kind of smell. the taste isnt terrible, there is the metallic taste from the smell. then i get the feeling as if i am drinking corn. it's just a regular thin watery mouthfeel of a cheap beer. overall this is what i drink if im recovering from something really active, or i just want to drink with my friends and i have no money."
"I wouldn't recommend it as a beer. However, if you find yourself knee deep in a wooded area in the backwoods of Alabama and you hear Hank Williams Jr blaring from two 12 inch speakers hoisted in the bed of a 1984 Chevrolet Silverado, then go ahead, feel confident to drink one."
"O: Not terrible. Easy drinking, and cheap, it was $1.50 for a pint. Better than many BMC products."
"Long Live the High Life!!!"
"Pours a clear straw color with pleasant bubbles and a delicate, tiny white head. Nice, right? Weak aroma of grains and skunk. Thin tasting, with minerals and stale grains, metallic, and a skunky aftertaste. Light, fizzy, and a very weak drinkability. To be avoided."
"Crystal clear pale yellow with a fat, soapy head of shock white fizz. I debated the rating here..but the aroma is slightly above average for macro swill. Sugar cookie and corn with the faintest suggestion of floral hops in the aroma. Much like the nose, sugar cookie up front with faint bitterness and a squeaky clean finish. Light bodied and effervescent. Certainly drinkable but unremarkable."
"O-This brew has overtaken Bud as my go to beer when I want something simple and easy to drink that won't fill me up and won't disappoint."
"Drinkability/overall- A decent average beer nothing good or bad to really say about it"
"Certainly not the worst ajunct lager you could choose on a hot summer day. Priced right, and no ill aftertaste, just not much taste at all."
"D: This beer is a bit on the flavorless end of the spectrum. I like how it feels in the mouth, but there just isn't enough flavor to go along with it. I would choose MGD over this."
"O- For what it is it's not bad. Crisp and clean with no noticeable off flavors (other than the faint sourness). If you're trying to pair this with anything I'd stick to basics such as a burger, pizza, hot dog, etc."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: A decent lager for an adjunct and probably the best BMC product out there."
"Pours a weak one finger head that will be gone in seconds. The body is completely transparent, it has quite a bit of carbonation, and is yellow in color. It looks like it might be leaving decent lacing thought we'll see. Miller is funny because it actually kind of tastes like champagne, on the smell that's exactly what I get, a champagne smell, very sour, maybe even berry smell to it. I mean, is it the best smell ever? No, but it's not a bad smell, and it's very unique as far as adjunct lagers go. Also let it be noted that I do not get that much skunk on the smell, which is good considering it's a clear bottle. The taste is interesting, I get almost no skunk, which is mind boggling, I don't know how that is possible. I do get a very nice berry taste to this, it kinda tastes like champagne, I mean frankly, it almost has characteristics of a hefeweisen. There is a nice sour, maybe even bitter after taste to this beer as well. I mean...yeah it an adjunct lager and yeah it's not the greatest taste ever, but it's actually not bad at all. As far as adjunct lagers go, this is the best I've had so far (accept for maybe PBR). The mouthfeel isn't too great, but that's ok. Drinkability is pretty good, not only because it's light, but because it's tasty too. Overall, an ok beer, but in terms of adjunct lagers, pretty dang good :)"
"I have always subscribed to the ""respect beer"" theory but this one makes it hard. I can respect craft brewers who put work into their beers but this isn't that. This is mildly alcoholic water with the single purpose of being drank with a funnel and hose."
"Overall: This is a great go-to beer, especially considering the price. Under $20 for a 30 rack, $2 for a 40oz, and a solid, enjoyable drink every time? I don't only go to High Life because it's cheap, though. I really do enjoy drinking this beer. Anyone looking for a nice, solid everyday drinkable beer will enjoy High Life, and chances are, they probably already do."
"617"
"Before I got into different types of beer this is pretty much what I drank. Pours golden, as you can see through the clear bottle. White froth head. Fairly good amount of carbonation. Not much to taste. I guess sometimes you could taste an apple sorta taste, but not much taste wise, just tastes like generic beer to me. Something if I was to drink a lot, I'll get this. Very drinkable. It's not bad at all."
"Overall. Tried to be objective here but there just isn`t much to this beer. Just sweet and bubbly."
"I actually would probably buy this again. That score is on the upper side of average."
"Miller Highlife always seems to find its way into my fridge. I do love all types and styles of beer, craft and mass produced. Highlife is a beer I go for time and time again on common days. It is very easy drinking. I must say I agree with what I remember an Uncle saying long ago when I was just a young college student. He said ""Miller Highlife is probably the most beautiful looking beers of its type."" I still agree, I catch myself gazing at it's golden color and slow moving little bubbles dancing around while I sip it in the Florida sunlight. This beer has a nice crisp start and a soft light alcohol finish. I also taste hints of sweet bread flavors. It also has a better lace on the glass than most of it's competitors. This is a favorite of mine while out fishing or working in the yard."
"Beautiful light beer. American beer at its finest. As a Canadian when I go to the states I get this on tap . Cheap.Tasty Refreshing. I can drink 12 to 18 of these. No rim scald.No Beagle Breath No hang over, Beautiful.The best part is is a 6 Pack of 16 ounce cans is about $5.50."
"D- What do I feel this beer is? It's a better version of MGD, IMO. The flavor is a little more prominent and it is very easy drinking...I wish this was in Canada....I would love to enjoy this all evening or at the pub! Great for beginner beer drinker but also great for a discerning BA that wants something cheap, yet flavorful."
"D: Standard ABV and, though not complex, Miller High Life does offer some flavor. I am on a search for a decent (and cheap) light beer I can give to friends who are not into microbrews (and also one that I can drink myself)."
"I want to place two thoughts into consideration. Let's compare macro brews with other macro brews. Let's also consider that union brewed beer produces family wage jobs which are more important than ever today. I like to think that my enjoyment of this beer is good for our economy. Miller High Life should be considered a ""Classic Beer"" with these considerations. The head is unique for macro brews. The creamy mouth feel can seem luxurious when only a lighter beer will satisfy my dry. The taste is consistently good for this style no matter how many glasses you drain. Along with PBR it is truly the working persons (or students) best option if you like to have six or more at a time without blowing out the budget and you want something that is refreshing and tastes good. I am very thankful that Miller High Life is still available at a reasonably low cost. This is known as ""The High Life"" for those of us who like to drink beer frequently within our budget. I envy anyone who can afford to do this with micro brews. I am willing to label Miller High Life as the champagne of beer for the common person. It deserves a lot of respect for this reason in comparison with other beers in it's class."
"D: pretty easy to drink.. lacks taste but still very quaffable."
"This beer is un-drinkable in every way,but im sure there's some man/woman out there driving down the road, singing along to ac/dc, waving their welfare check out the window, that can't wait to get some."
"On the bright side this beer is inexpensive."
"D- Very drinkable. This is my party beer. Cheap enough to buy in bulk and drinkable enough to go all night."
"Drinkability: I could see this as a go-to for cheap beer. Certainly not something I would want to drink on a regular basis, but for what it is, it's not bad. This will become one of my ""fall back"" beers besides PBR. Refreshing, crisp, and dirt cheap. Sounds like a plan to me. Probably one of the best bets if you absolutely have to pick a beer from the ""Big Three."""
"Pouring gives you about one finger of head, which sticks around for a fair amount of time. Smells dry and a little musty, there's some sweetness in there also. High Life's flavor is dry and a slightly bitter, I taste corn and something leafy. This isn't the first beer I'd grab from the MBC section, but it'll do in a pinch."
"D- this is my favorite party beer, i can drink a lot of it and do."
"D- Very easy to drink as the taste is mild and unoffensive. This is the perfect cheap beer to drink a lot of. Good for a sports game, party, or after working outside. It can only be enjoyed if it ice cold. Truly the champagne of discount beers."
"Passing grade for the High Life."
"D: Actually quite refreshing in a shitty way."
"Serving type: bottle"
" I remember drinking it twenty years ago, it was a better beer, not the same recipe as they cheapened it, to put it in a lower price category."
"D - You can drink this all night. It has no heaviness to it, so you can keep pulling them back. Might cause some gastronomical distress."
"had this in many different cities across this great land and its too bad this was my beer of choice when i was a young lad. Not at all what I would consider to be a choice for drinking now. I would much rather have water and wont even offer to my friends. I rated this high in drinkability because I think you can drink your own weight of this stuff."
"D: These go down so easily, it's hard to describe!"
"very suprising I would go to this any day before a bud or coors I have to be honest I am pleasently suprised."
"D: Easily drinkable. A nice change of pace over other party beers"
"This is a good beer to wash down a nice sandwich or barbecue, even if it takes two...although I think for those with really refined tastes they would find the experience to be pretty mediocre at best...not bat, not great. For me, it's a good beer, plain and simple, and for the price, not a bad choice at all!"
"Verdict: A decent Adjunct Lager. An affordable lager. This would make a decent party beer for those who are looking for quantity over quality. It has it's flaws, but they are slightly less evident than the horde of other American Adjunct Lagers. This beer has given me more reasons to review macros; it wasn't terrible. C (2.8)"
"Overall: 	Great beer when served ice cold on a hot day. I wouldn't order it at a bar, but it's nice to have a few in the fridge when feel like having a decent macro."
"In short - beer that's fresh tastes better. Macro brews get trucked all over the place, and even with multiple breweries, most of the big guys don't want to admit having a hard time keeping their product fresh. Born-on dates don't reflect weeks in a 110 degree warehouse or stockroom."
"Super clear and fizzy, this looks a bit darker than normal urine. Not a totally gross looking beer. Nice foamy head. Smells of adjuncts, mostly corn. No hops noticeable. Taste is the same, a little sour. Feels thin and watery, of course. A little worse than I thought it would be, but mostly just...meh."
"One of the best of the adjunct lagers. One of the only beers that can be served in a glass bottle after sitting in sun for a week and then thrown in the freezer without any skunkiness at all. Goes down easy when very cold. Hard to drink enough of these to even get a buzz due to the sheer volume of liquid. At least it doesn't taste like puke like most of the adjuncts. It's merely a weak beer without many defining characteristics other than having alcohol and the approximate color and nature of beer."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. Not much body. Could put down a lot of these in a night and I think that's how most people drink it."
"Big thick head of two plus fingers. Very clingy lace. Color is a 2 on the SRM beer color chart, lighter than some light beers, but with more kick. Smell is corn and corn stalk. Taste is corn, and cereal grain, and malt. Sort of crisp as long as it is cold. Most beers start to taste better as the warm, not this one. Not heavy in mouthfeel, there but not much. This is a hot day beer, yard work, good beer to drink while washing your car."
"I picked up a four pack at a gas station half and hour before new years, this seemed to be the least nasty of what was offered. I have seen others comparing the appearance to urine; that is a lie, drinking urine would be an improvement. Pours an incredibly foamy white head; the stench emanating is reminiscent of unscented laundry detergent, rotting vegetable matter, and metal. Has a bitter sensation unlike a good IPA; imagine consuming arsenic or rat poison, same idea. Oily, sudzy, metallic, non edible are ways to describe the mouthfeel. Drinkability is up there with battery acid, your body will know this is not something to be consumed in any quantity and respond with near instant objections."
"Well all of that said it drinks better than all else but still a little weak."
"Nothing in the appearance. Pleasant smell. Good, slightly hoppy taste."
"But alas the drinkability of MHL is it's only ""redeming"" quality. It goes down ""easy"" and does what alcohol does best."
"It sits just about the same place that most macro brews sit in the grand scheme of beer. This is more acceptable than most other choices--it carries a decent head and a better than average smell for an adjunct. Taste can vary from acceptable to awful depending on how cold it is. Feel is thin and carbonated just like one would expect. If they are cold enough, I can knock a few of these back. It's my ideal choice for beer pong. Cheap enough and not as awful as the alternatives."
"D: This is a highly drinkable beer. Both clean and mildly flavored, not much is going to stop you from putting a few of these down if that's what you want to do. There could be some better flavors to lure you in, and there are cleaner, less floral Adjunct Lagers out there, but High Life does a pretty good job. 4/5"
"Value wise, at $2.85 a four pack of tall-boys, this stuff is excellent when you're looking for a cheep beer to satisfy the masses (so they don't drink all your expensive craft beers)."
"--I've never gotten a hangover from this stuff. I believe hangovers mostly occur from not having much liquid or food in your system because I know I can't drink much if I haven't eaten.--"
"D=An okay amount of flavor; a bit watery for a lager...can't believe this was Miller's flagship brand for all these years...I think they changed the recipe after repositioning it as a value brew."
"Simply awful."
"I've found this to be a very drinkable macro pale lager. Nothing really special going on here. What you see is what you get. Nothing really bad about it but nothing great though. Leaves little after taste. Has a slight corny taste. It is a pale yellow with a touch of orange. It is quite bubbly and pleasant on the tongue. I'd pick this one over most other pale lagers."
"Drinkability: I've had tons of High Life in my day, and I do not remember it ever being this bad. I guess that's why we go back and review these things, though, right? Now I know never to buy this again."
"D- This beer is highly drinkable in my opinion, I could drink these all night long, though only if it was the only thing available . It doesn't offer anything special to drinkers but if your looking for a good cheap beer this is one of the better choices right up there with PBR."
"Pours a golden color, has a nice four-finger white head, high level of carbonation. I actually find it a pretty beer, looks appealing to me. Aroma is mostly corn, has that ""adjunct"" smell to it. Taste is corny too, a bit sweet, basically no hops. Has a slight grainy/grassy aftertaste I find common in adjunct lagers. However it is still better than others, since I didn't notice any skunkiness or really unpleasant flavors to it. For what it is, High Life is a decent lager, nothing special but still highly drinkable. (I bought a six-pack for casual beer drinkers, ended up trying some for myself.) It's also quite cheap, and I would much rather buy this over a more expensive foreign beer that I like less (Corona, Heineken, Beck's, etc.)"
"I HIGHly recommend the High Life."
"Back in the high life again"""
"Prefer this to PBR simply because of mouthfeel, but thats not saying much."
"What a terrible Color miller made this beer, though in reality, its much better than it looks. Usually i'm not going to say much in the favor of a BMC beer, however this isnt so bad. this beer tastes like slighy grains a very bland hint of hop and water. however all these flavors are much more dominant in MHL then they are in any of the other Macro Lagers that I can by a sixer for under 5 dollars."
"It looks like a beer, smells like a beer, and tastes like a beer. No need to over analyze this one. Great stuff when its hot outside or when you want to drink a lot of cold beer without having to think very much. Not good with food other than dogs. Just my opinion though."
"D/M: Very crisp and tingly beer because of the carbonation. Very easy to drink, which makes this the perfect summer grilling beer. Refreshing and surprising flavor considering that this is something from a mass brewer."
"Sort of plain, but really better than I expected. Nothing particularly interesting about it, but nothing to truly hate -unless you don't like corn. Or you're looking for flavor."
"D - Goes down easy, especially when served ice cold"
"Hey, it's 100 degrees out and i've got a few bucks in my pocket. I know what I'm getting. It's refreshing in all ways and inoffensive. So there. And has one of the greatest logos around. Seeking distinct character? Look elsewhere. look here because it's the best example of what it is: AAL."
"D-one of the most drinakble adjunct lagers i've had. i got this at 2 for 1s at applebees and i swallowed both mugs like it were water. it stays smooth and crisp"
"D - Very easy to down, which I suppose is the best quality of this beer. It's a fairly typical adjunct, but better than all the Lite crap."
"Pours a pure white, three-finger head that fades slowly to a thin layer and leaving some lace. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Crystal clear pale straw color. Nose is ?? Flavor is sweet corn with faint hints of hops in background. Squeaky clean finish. Good lawn mower beer. Better than MGD. The champagne of beers, who are they kidding? $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Pours a pale straw color with a decent enough head and a little lacing. Smells of sweet corn and some florals. Tastes semi-sweet with a little hop bitterness playing with the palate. Mouthfeel is pretty thin and needs major work. Good carbonation. Poor drinkability."
"D: Can't really say anything here other than I would take it over any light beer from BMC. Probably one of the better macros."
"This is really as ""light"" of a beer as I can go. But it really is one of life's simple pleasures to crack open a High Life that was kept on ice while you mow the lawn. Miller time anyone?"
"Clear and yellow/gold in color. Large fizzy head that quickly shrunk to a few bubbles. Looks like a stereotypical american beer. Smell is pretty unappealing. Corn husk, musty grain and some sweet malt. Taste is very mild. Little to no hop flavor and the malts are a little sweet. Basically par for the course. Mouthfeel is fluid and crisp from the full carbonation. Pretty drinkable and refreshing pale lager."
"I don't feel like seeking this beer out in the future, but...who am I kidding?"
"Although this beer is made by Miller which represents the American Beer Powerhouses (Miller, Coors, Bud...); of which i do not like at al. This beer actually isnt too bad for a mainstream american light lager. It has a light body with a decent amount of flavor. It isnt my first choice but Miller High Life actually isnt that bad and its about the same price as Natural Light which i will never again drink....plus High Life has a great slogan- ""The Champagne of Beers""!"
"It's a cheap beer, so you can't expect a lot. It's probably better than other macros, but not by too far. Honestly, I'd hoped for more."
"Sure there is nothing impressive about it, but you can always find this beer and know exactly what to expect. I prefer the taste of this beer to the bud lights, miller, and Coors beers. It is a highly carbonated beer but the taste is a love and hate relationship. I think the taste is more complex than your typical lager/pilsner, but for the price and history with this beer, I wouldn't mind picking this up for an all day drink secession."
"D- Goes down smooth and is extremely affordable not bad for a macro"
"MHL is such a huge improvement over Tecate and likely much better than PBR and probably every macro AAJ. A simple complement to battered fish that has its place, keeps its price and knows its role. The gentlemans choice."
"overall it's better than some cheap American lagers but not near as good as pbr"
"D - I mean, for a light bodied beer that has more taste than you'd expect, this is pretty downable. had one with a chicken sandwich"
"I got tired of smelling aluminum when I drink cheap beer, so I began pouring it into my 20 oz IKEA glass. Tried Rainier first, but it seemed to leave a headache, so I paid about 70 cents more for a six pack of 16 oz. cans and poured away. I was impressed by the persistent head, and began to drink. I found it rather soft and vaugely sweet, although you can detect hops and barley there. It is appropriately yellow, so unless they used food coloring it must be real beer. The taste was smooth, and the aftertaste was somewhere between acceptable and undetectable. Active ingredient being 5%, the buzz from 16 oz. is just about right for a quiet sunny day out in the yard. You could probably drink this all day and then run out in your front yard naked waving a shotgun and still wake up the next day feeling fine and ready for another session. Next time I am feeling flush with cash, I will try Budweiser, which is about $2 more than Rainier for 16-oz. 6-packs."
"It's so cheap. $7 and change for a 12-pack of bottles. For like $0.64 (cents) a bottle, I'll take it. However, nothing about this beer is good, except for the price. I can't recall any smell at all, which could be a good thing. It tastes decent though and it goes down fairly well."
"Frothy head upon initial pouring. There is a faint smell that reminded me of dish water or cleaning bleach but it disappeared quickly and had no effect on the taste. The flavor is OK for a budget macro brew. I found the mouth feel to be somewhat on the lighter side. A decent summer time lager when the budget is tight or you need to pass a kidney stone."
"Best thing about MHL I found was the feel and drinkability. No bite and limited fizz. Drinks somewhat smooth but not as crisp or watery-clean as other mass-marketed brands. And that's a big plus. Content to have this again if it's laying around."
"Overall this is one of the better adjunct lagers. It's really affordable, so that's also a plus. Four 16-ounce cans cost me a bit over $2."
"Better than the average American adjunct lager."
"The next day I had a headache. Lots of rice and or corn in this bad boy."
"In fact, it is a step down in quality from the Coors Light I had yesterday. I'd reach for a Coors Light one hundred times out of one hundred if forced to choose between it and Miller High Life. This sucks."
"in a hot summer blaze, one could easily drink a case of mhl. it's not bad."
"Overall, I never pour these out of the bottle to drink mainly because one of the reasons I purchase it is because I like the bottle. Its a great beer for drinking on a budget or when hanging out with non craft drinking friends."
"Very drinkable. As I said, I had three and could easily have had more if I were not driving. It's funny that I can remember that this beer was derided about 10 or 15 years ago--it was one of the worst beers available. Now, I think it's probably about one of the best of the big brewery beers out there."
"There is only one macro that I enjoy drinking, and this one is it. There are others that I can tolerate, but this one I will buy just to have something around that is refreshing to drink. Something that is not heavy, or hoppy or malty... just lightweight and enjoyable. Even with the adjuncts, there is nothing offensive here, and it does the job that it is supposed to do. Crisp, thin mouth feel, excellent head and lacing down the glass - please don't drink from the container - pour this one. I like the 6 pack of 16oz cans best poured into glass because I have had some inconsistent quality in the bottles. Occasionally yo get a very bitter one for some reason. There's not much aroma to savor, but the balance in flavor and adequate alcohol content make this one the best macro out there that I have found yet - not to mention the price is great."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink several of these since you don't really taste anything. Very little complexity."
"D-Its cheap to drink so if you're broke and looking to get drunk go for this over some others."
"The name might be impressive.. but the beer is not. Light low quality hay taste. Seems odd because this beer should be promoting the high life. There is pretty heavy carbonation, and it just seems like a miller bottled with a high life special tag. Nothing to get excited over"
"Goes down very easy when u r in the mood to drink. But if im notg really thirsty its hard to get one down.Descent for the price."
"Overall no this is not a great beer, but it was 98 degrees on the pier, and it did its job. I have had far worse then this."
"Not a beer I would seek out but it has it's place. Mainly a 100 degree day or a ballgame. That's pretty much it."
"A bright golden hue. Plenty of carbonation. Sometimes, a little too much. Simple beer aroma. Plain taste, maybe a bit sweet. The carbonation makes this a smooth drink. A good alternative when I'm in a mood where I'm not much interested in the taste of my beer."
"D- Average."
"D: It's a lawnmower beer. As adjunct lagers go, it's average. And I find adjunct lagers highly drinkable at proper serving temperatures."
"i picked up this 40 only because it was 2 dollars and i was broke. i accompanied this 40 with another 40 of genesee, which i believe was a little better. i will prolly never intentially seek this out again, but im sure we will run into each other sooner or later."
"Pours a clear golden color with surprising, which unfortunately quickly dissipated. not a lot of smell to it, but I can sniff a little bit of hops. it has a clean taste of grain and corn. Feels mike a medium/light body with a good bit of carbonation. I only had this at a party, didn't do much for me. I have found that in general, when things come out of camouflaged can, they don't taste super great. Although I am sure i could, this isn't something I would like to spend my evening drinking."
"Verdict: Miller High Life is one of the best examples of this perpetually weak style out there (please excuse the backhanded compliment). If I had to pick one American Adjunct Lager out of a cooler at a party, I think this would be it."
"The beer is an average example of it's style. Clean, clear yellow with a fluffy white head that had OK retention and even a bit of lacing. A slightly sweet, but mostly neutral aroma and taste. Crisp, clean, smooth and balanced body. Good drinkability for the style. For a Cheap American Lager, this is better than some, not as good as others."
"Pours a light, see through yellow, with a 2 finger head that dissipates rapidly, and very carbonated. Almost burns a little bit after the first sip. basic macro style lager taste. taste like bud light and coors. it is refreshing on a hot day but not a beer you sit and enjoy."
"""Life..."" The wind whispers as the man finally immerses his entire being, both physically and spiritually into the sparkling pool. Once suspended, face merely grazing the surface, the man now enters the realm of Cheap-and-Refreshing."
"D: For being so fricking cheap it is pretty frickin decent. I have bought this stuff for a while and it passes for beer in my book!"
"D: Well I have lost the taste for this beer and would not want another one, to have the same bland taste. While it goes down easy and is non-filling, thats what they wanted. I would say lower end of drinkability for the lack of desire to return for more drinking, in regards to taste/flavor and aroma."
"The best thing we got going on here is the carbonation. The bubbles abound. This literally is champagne like in its carbonation."
"Pours very light and clear golden yellow. Big white head soon turns into a sudsy, yet sticky ring. Smells like a hay field that was cut three days ago. Taste is clean and light biscuity. A hint of leafy bitters on the end adds to this beer being a step above the average adjunct. Drinkability is not that high, imo. Too sticky of a finish for increased consumption."
"D- For an adjunct, this is a decent beer. also, their commercials are humorous."
"Pabst has more hops presence and MGD has more malt. Miller High Life is just about in the middle of these two making it easier to drink more than one and cooling off the day."
"d- i'd put it up there with pbr as best of the worst. for what it is, not too shabby."
"pours golden and pure. decent white head. retention is ok. nose is clean, grainy and corn husky. taste is much the same. fresh grain, almost non-existent hops, thus no bitterness, cooked corn is quite prominent. mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. quite smooth actually. malt vs crispness balances quite well for an AAL. Overall this beer lacks depth and complexity. but what it lacks in depth and complexity, it makes up for in refreshing crispness. nothing really off flavor or out of bounds. decent, well rounded, simple. for $4/6pack you simply can not beat it."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is chlorinated corn. Absolutely awful. The flavor is corn with some grassy notes. Luckily, the chlorine from the aroma is not that apparent in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Drinkability- High Life is light enough to be consumed in large quantities but heavy enough to be satisfying. It is definitely one of my favorite budget macro brews."
"D- Pretty good drinkability but could lead to a bad hangover becuse of the water quality."
"This is a solid beer to enjoy on those hot summer evenings as you are sitting on your porch/balcony watching the lightning from a distance, while eating a hearty tomato based BBQ sandwich."
"It smells like most cheap beers, a hint of alcohol, mostly corn/ grain and a little metallic. The taste is similar, corn and metal, not really any hops or malt, they're there but you can't taste them. Feels like bubbly carbonation and drinks well."
"D: One of those beers that nails the style guidelines but gets a regular beat-down by beer advocates that grace these pages."
"Overall, this is probably one of my favorite cheap beers."
"D: Very good, it's nothing to unsettling with taste or alcoholic content, but I'd have a few on tap for affordability, and the overall appeal of a beer of this caliber, cheap and effective."
"Its not as bad as you think it is."
"When I want a cheap, drinkable single serving can of beer, this is what I drink. Sure, I could purchase 40's but then I would have to completely change my lifestyle. In all seriousness this beer is macro style with a bit more flavor than the others. One of the positives of this brew is that it does leave a very nice lacing on my glass; which, I was surprised at. The color is light golden with a heavy CO2 characteristic to it. Flavor, well, is sour with a mish mash of corn, grains, hops. Unlike most beers where you can separate the hop flavor from the malt flavor and enjoy both, this beer presents all flavors at once."
"Overall a nice macro treat on draft."
"This is one of those beers that while cheap may actually offer more than some of it's more expensive relatives (e.g. Miller Lite). While the corn is very prevalent, this beer is very easy to consume and is quite refreshing. The bottle, if nothing else, is a piece of nostalgic history that echoes the glory day's of the American Lager. Even when consumed warm there are no off flavors and the carbonation stays under control. If you like Miller Lite but want something with a little more flavor give this beer a try!"
"Good drinkability, crisp and refreshing."
"Good, solid brew!"
"D - Went ahead and bought a 12-pack of these because they were so cheap. Great price for this beer. Expected it to be bad because the price was so good, but it's one I'll have again."
"Sometimes these are cool to drink for kitsche value. My tour of duty in Milwaukee/Marquette made drinking these kind of obligatory for awhile. There's definitely worse AAL's out there. Corn city!"
"Drinkability: Refreshing and very easy to drink"
"So wonderful to be living the high life again after a long absence. Pale golden color, with a billowing white head. Smells somewhat sweet, with a little bit of graininess and absolutely no hops. Tastes similar to how it smells, a little sweetness, and not much more. Cold, crisp and carbonated, perfectly fits the bill it was designed for. Refreshing and not at all unpleasant in the right situation."
"Feel/Drink: Really refreshing when you just want a beer. Highly carbonated and mild bodied."
"Drinkability: Actually pretty damn good for an Adjunct Lager. Very refreshing and easy to slam down a few."
"Crappy version of Miller Lite which is pretty crappy itself."
"Overall, not something I would buy. However, at the same time I can't say much that's bad about it for it's category, and that's why I hate it. It's just so boring and down-the-middle. There are no exciting flavors here. Nothing differentiates it from any other beer. No character."
"Because of that sour malt quality, and overall lack of nuance to the beer, I wouldn't put it in the list of one of my favorites. However, it is still somewhat decent."
"Drinkability: Nothing special at all- good for a quick refresher or to get drunk. Other than that, should be avoided- but I doubt anyone here needed me to tell them that."
"Drinkability: ""The Champagne of Beers?"" Please. The only connection this beer has to champagne is color and carbonation level. This is a good beer for quick, repeated consumption. Nothing else. It's slightly better out of a bottle."
"Overall: High Life is nothing more than a more carbonated version of MGD."
"Smell and flavor are corn, corn, and corn. The foam, for whatever reason, is highly bitter, but there's no bitter in the beer itself. A little bit of malty aftertaste does stick around for a while, and the mouthfeel is surprisingly nice. As for drinkability, I finished about half a bottle while writing this review. No bitterness and low alcohol content means this'll do just fine for your next beer pong party. And that's living... The High Life."
"Typical Adjunct Lager that leaves me feeling ""meh"". Hot day or at a party like I had, this beer is perfect. Otherwise, skip it and go for something better."
"Overall, I could drink a ton of these. but not that you want to..."
"D: like water...corny fizzy water."
"Drinkability is above average for the same reason. Pat on the back for Miller."
"D - This isn't a beer I would turn to if the price wasn't so cheap. In winter months this beer isn't the greatest either when you would want something heavier, but during the summertime or when cash is tight, this is a beer to go with. However, I still feel it's beer than most other macro lagers out there."
" D- This beer is very clean but could be a bit more crisp with a little hint of hops or malt to add character."
"D- Manufactured to finish with no aftertaste. That helps the drinkablility. This is not an absolutely gross beer like many of its sisters and competitors. As far as being ""The champagne of beers""... They have never heard of DeuS."
"Poured into a red 16oz Solo Plastic cup at the local Catholic church shindig. It was super-cold, so there was no vapor, so I cant comment on the smell. It had a head, it was a very basic yellow color. It didnt quite live up to its rep as the Champagne of bottled beers. But it brought back reassuring memories of early adulthood, so I'm not gonna give it a bad review. My only regret was that it was not in a quart bottle with a screw-on cap..."
"Notes: Not bad for what it is suppose to be. Not too different from other Macros. Probably as good or better than most macros."
"Cheers!"
"RJT"
"Thin-bodied with aggressive, but not harsh carbonation. Smooth and grainy mouthfeel."
"I've already reviewed the bottled version of this beer. While the canned version is more or less the same, it does take on a bit of a steely metallic taste. This is somewhat mitigated by pouring it into a glass. Still a decent brew, but if you have the choice between bottled or canned, I'd definitely go with the former."
"This beer is rather bitter and nothing special compared to the rest of the American Macro Lagers I have tried. I really think they could up the ante on such a hyped up beer. The carbonation is super low and it's not one bit crisp on the tongue, either. All I taste is stagnant fizzy water that seemed to have been passed through a bag of metallic minerals."
"Drinkability- Horrible. Its too flavorful to be a chugging beer and to shitty to drink for the purpose of appreciating beer."
"the sickly sweetness of the corn and barley intermingling with a brief hop bitterness. the metallic finish, the striking awareness of what it means to be an american. realizing that this beer is brewed in kettles bigger than anything you will ever own. that slight touch of something (it can't be hops, only miller lite is triple hopped) at the end that signifies something meaningful yet esoteric. such is the way of the american dream. long live this beautiful land...as for the people..."
"As long as they are cold these go down easy, something light and cheap with a bit of taste."
"High carbonation. On par with the other usual suspects. I give this bonus points for having such an attractive bottle design. Timeless."
"The champagne of beers, indeed."
"the tap version of this was by and far the best of all of the mediums of drinking. there was a slight hint of what might be called hops, and the head seemed to be a bit better off. other than that the whole thing was still generic and a poor choice for a beer."
"Poured out of a shiny gold 24oz. can. The beer was gold but rather pale in comparison. Fluffy white head left a surprising amount of lacing. ""The champagne of beers"" is really not too bad for the style. There's a wet grass that accompanies the adjunct sweetness. The grassy scent seems to show itself slightly in the taste. There's also a very slight hint of wheat. I have to admit that this would be my macro of choice at the current time."
"Looking for a micro brew or craft brew...don't bother with this one."
"I would recommend this beer for the fiscally challenged."
"Another staple in American beer, the Champagne of Beer!!! Cheap, but good, not great but still just good. A beer that does have it's place, but isn't the first pick of the ice chest. This beer is very drinkable, light, and has low flavor which helps along with its easy drinking. Good with almost any barbecue, outdoor picnic, at the bar, or around a fire. A good beer."
"Drank a lot of this back in the day as it was a big favorite of my brother. I never could get into it. Always had a real syrupy mouthfeel for a pale lager which defeated a lot of the refreshment purpose of these types of beers. Flavor was very standard for the style. Gimme a PBR over this any day!"
"Drinkability: Not the greatest for binge drinking but still very good. Easy to drink but not very good tasting either."
"this beer is based on the style it is classified in... nothing special but it's a good beer for a night out with the guys. not so sure it's the champagne of beers but for my money, i'd buy it again. has a musky taste to it that isn't overpowering. you can definately suck down quite a few of these. the one(s) i had were in tall-boy cans....can't get any better than that."
"I've had this beer maybe a million times by now. I know it isn't a great beer geek beer, but it's definitely one of those beers that will satisfy the wallet over a long drinking beer night. It actually doesn't taste that bad, but I do prefer the bottles over the can. The thing is...they make the High Life Gear stuff so damn attractable I found myself buying 30-pack after 30-pack just so I could get a decent gift for myself. And I did....in the mail should be coming a nice high life grill apron. But I digress, this beer is a solid session beer that can't compare to the great craft beers. However, it does hold its own and washes down food quite nice."
"Poured from a refrigerator-temperature bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours crystal clear, light gold, with a pure white thick head quickly dissipating into a skim of lace. Tiny rising bubbles live up to its reputation as the champagne of beers. Aroma is of light, sweet malts - unremarkable, yet inoffensive. Flavor is of corn malts, with no hops to balance. A slight bitterness up front yields to a malty sweetness that does not linger. I cannot believe the ABV - there is no real flavor of alcohol. This is a crisp beer, the bubbles are refreshing and the mouthfeel is thin and watery as befits the style. This beer is very drinkable - it's refreshing on a hot day, has such a mild flavor that it doesn't clash with edibles, and the price is right."
"Served in a fridge temperature bottle, because the best way to experience the high life is straight from the bottle. It's a clear golden beer with some carbonation bubbles visible within. In the bottle, you get no head at all, but if someone is foolish enough to pour it into a glass, you'll see a thick, pure white head that will dissipate quickly. I've never taken the time to smell a High Life; now I know why. Lots of sweet malt and corn that is rather off-putting. The flavor is also all malt, but cheap, sweet malts. There's a bit off the gross after-taste common to this style, but not as much as High Life's competitors. Considering the style, the taste is actually pretty good; hence the 3.5 rating. It's a thin beer that is has too much carbonation to really taste the beer (so maybe that's a good thing). This is a good beer to drink when you don't want to think about what you are putting into your body. I never drink it for flavor, but more for price point and availability."
"Cheers! Have a High Life"
"Note: I recommend the bottles over the cans."
"True classic."
"Overall, this makes a nice substitute for whenever my pocket's are running on E and Stag is nowhere to be found. Not too bad, all in all."
"Of all the yellow beers out there, this one is near the top of the pack. Sure, that isn't saying much, but sometimes you just feel like a cheap lager; and in such a situation, High Life isn't a very bad choice. It smells and tastes like almost every other macro out there, but there's a certain something, a bread-like taste that makes it a bit more substantial than Bud or Pabst."
"D- Very easy drinking and a cheap, former personal standby. That being said, I remember why I no longer drink it."
"Pours very light yellow with a thin, fizzy white head. Not much to say about this beer; just another cheap lager. Tastes more adjunct (corn) heavy than comparably priced canned beers. It also has a bit of a harsh chemical aftertaste that's not all that pleasant. It's not undrinkable, but I'd stick with something cleaner tasting such as PBR or Genny Cream Ale when I'm looking for a cheap 12pk of cans."
"Now, all that being sad, here in Texas where it is 110 degrees on my patio when I am grilling, I need an easy, watery beer to quench my thirst while grilling."
"Very drinkable, though not interesting, but what American lagers are."
"Overall, this is probably my second favorite macro-lager behind PBR. Even taking price out of consideration, this is still a hell of a lot better than Budwesier, as it has much more character and body. That said, since PRB is regaining a lot of popularity and therefore going up in price, Miller High Life is hard to beat at $6.79/12 pack."
"This was one of my favorites but than again that was 20 years ago and I was still underage."
"A good, inexpensive, easy to drink, refreshing beer."
" High Life drinkers are a band of brothers. Every time a pair of High Life drinkers cross paths at a party, there is a high five or a hand shake. Its unique, because its a getting drunk beer that is filled with class as well as alcohol(4.6ABV). I'm going to go out and have some more, tomorrow morning will be painful."
"My industrial pale lager of choice, along with PBR and Asahi Super Dry."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Not my beer of choice, but after working outside, this beer does quench a thirst."
"High Life is what it is. Unlike many American macros, the ole Chanpagne of Beers has a taste, albeit very sweet and corny. The smell is of corn and the appearance of highly sedimented urine. Mouthfeel is thin with a refreshing soda-like hit of carbonation. Drinkability is first rate, no complexity here. Miller is my American macro, and, in truth, I'd just as soon have it as many of the craft lagers I have tried. At two bucks a 40, and when you just want a beer, Miller is first rate. I may, however, be biased: it was the very first beer I ever tasted."
"Drinkability - if your going out to have a few, you can drink these without getting in too much trouble."
"MHL is my favorite ""Macro Brew"". It has a little bit of a ""skunky"" smell to it but I think it adds to the character. Beautiful, golden color with a reasonable 2 finger head. Taste is crisp, light and refreshing with a smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability is high. Great beer for having a couple of BBQ dogs or burgers on the weekend or watching a ballgame with your friends. Goes good with any Mexican food that is above the level of ""Taco Bell""."
"Overall: Obviously it's not a high end beer but I'll take it every time over other Bud/Coors/Miller options. You definitely can't beat the price. You can get a 12 pack of bottles here in NC for $6.79. This and PBR are my go to when I want something cheap."
"D- Miller drinkablity and gets the job done on the most basic level. Beer...GOOD"
"This is my old standby when I'm short on cash, out of all the beers on the lower price tier this is by far my favorite. Straight from the bottle, smells like corn and husk, a hint of wheat. Appearance is typical macro yellow. The taste is pretty sweet, some corn and grain. Drinkability is high, it glides down the throat with exceptional ease. If you are short on cash, go for it."
"Eric"
"Mouthfeel is thin-medium body with high carbonation."
"Drinkability: This beer is amazingly drinkable. It is actually more drinkable than carbonated water."
"Taste is very watery and bland, very little to it. Light and smooth and easy drinking is it's only redeemable characteristic. No bittereness or any trace of hops to it. Ok for the style, but skip it."
"D: It's drinkable in the sense that AB advertises Bud Light to be: it's basically water. The flavors are very watered down, but that's what I expected."
"Bright golden yellow in color, almost artificial looking hues. Huge plume of frothy head, leaves quickly with no trace. Smell is of light grass, stale water and bland corn. Taste is a relatively ineffensive light grass and corn flavor with just a hint of the before mentioned stale water. Somewhat bitter bite at the end. The body is light, ampley carbonated and very dry finnish. Drinkability is low because it always seems to do something to my stomach that i wont review here."
"The taste is clean sweet and grainy. Quite easy to drink and quite easy to enjoy. I told myself, this will go downhill as the beer sits and beer warms. It tasted the same at the end as at the beginning. I must say, this is one of the best, if not the best, macro made in America. The quest goes on, but I think I have had most of them.."
"Drinkability is good in that I could easily drink a few of these with no problems, but not as much as I'd enjoy drinking a few of something else. Overall, this isn't a terrible option if you're looking for a twelve pack below $9, but then again you can get Yuengling for that price point, too. Still, I can confidently say that this isn't as repulsive as some other beers in the style."
"Beautiful color, smell, well it smells like beer, kind of reminds me of the smell of the red white and blue my dad used to drink. The best thing about this beer is its drinkability. You can easily mow through 6-10 beers without even realizing it. I will definitly drink it again."
"Cheers!"

"Pretty nice for an adjunct lager, especially at the price they sell it at. I have to say I prefer it in a can because I don't get that creepy monster head."
"D- A drinkable beer for sure, but nothing special. Better than many other macros, but you can still do better if you're on a budget."
"D: When I'm in a pinch or just looking for something light I usually go PBR but I might start throwing this into the rotation. You can't compare it to the greats or even the mediocre craft beers but when put against others in this style it is worth a shot."
"T- As bubbly as it gets, it's not that carbonated in taste. Slight sourish aftertaste. It has only limited taste, really. Better than many American Macros, but still slightly below average."
"D: This beer is lot better than it's sister beer, Miller Genuine Draft. It is due to how they are packaged. I will drink this beer again."
"Dude, it's miller high life! I must say the bottle makes the difference. It's pretty terrible out of a can. I mean if you want to compare it to say Ruination or Hopslam, it sucks. But I'll take it over Diesel any day. It's my cheap beer of choice."
"Poured from the 40 oz. growler no. 06019-B51179. Sampled during Monday Night Football on September 14, 2009. Yep, I bought a bomber of the stuff already knowing what to expect. I was a bit surprised that I had not rated it yet. The pour is pale yellow with frothy, puffy white head. The aroma is your basic adjunct lager with a bit of grass, corn, and faint hops. The mouthfeel is about average to thin. The taste opens with grain and weak malts (more so than some of its competitors) and ends with a background of hops. For better or for worse this is the classic adjunct experience."
"Drinkability: Of the macro American Adjuct lagers, its actually pretty good. But that’s not saying all too much. Easy to drink and a bland, but unoffensive taste."
"still, damn drinkable! good ole union made champagne of beers....but the nostalgia of a former know-nothing isn't enough to make this one to return to, esp. in late 2009...!"
"""If you've got the time...we've got the beer."""
"D- A macro session beer that I drink a lot of when I have nothing else to drink, literally, like in certain parts of Iowa and Oklahoma."
"Really not a bad macro, very cheap and has a bad reputation, but not bad. Probably the best thing miller makes."
"Finish is slightly sweet with decent amount of bitterness. - CHEERS to life!"
"The taste is pretty good. It has a hint of corn in the taste and no hops. It is smooth and very drinkable when you are in the mood. It is a pretty good beer for a hot day."
"For $1, you could do a lot worse. I'm not complaining. As far as macros go, this is near the top."
"A well-made but not particularly noteworthy beer."
"My favorite style of beers are Pale Ales, Porters, and Belgian Triples, but I'm always gonna have a place in my belly for this beer."
"Quite grainy on the nose though primarily of raw barley vs. other adjuncts. Opens up to offer some sweet citric hop notes taking turns with a vegetal metallic nature. Sweeter than expected on the tongue and with a lemony orange finish. Texture anticipated from the smell doesn't materialize. Average feel but drink is limited due to the carbonation reducing too quickly and what might become a one dimensional sweetness on the finish."
"D - i love high life, who doesn't, it's $5.99 a 12-pack, and you know when you pick some up that you have a devlish grin on your face because in a few hours you will say something stupid and piss off your wife, the perfect dad's beer."
"drinkability is so so - still if i go macro i want a stag"
"From a 16 oz. can. Pours a pale, clear yellow with a 1/2 inch head. Not much aroma, some hints of corn. Taste is crisp, mild, some corn is present, a slight bitterness at the finish. Feels light in the mouth and overall is an easy drinking beer, great for beer games, otherwise very mediocre."
"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a pint glass. Plenty of head with sticky foam on the side of the glass. This beer has plenty of carbonation that even after a few minutes is giving off bubbles. Strong smell of corn. Yeasty smell. Everything you would come to expect of a inexpensive lagar. On a hot day this is very refreshing."
"This is the beer that started it all for me. My first beer in high school. maybe i have a sweet spot for it, but if i'm out playing horseshoes with the boys or in the need of something refreshing after a hot day at work. this is where i go for a cheap refreshing beer. not much for the other light flavored beers. don't get me wrong if you hand me one i won't turn it down, but this is my go to for a cool off after work!"
"if you dont agree i dont care. Beer advocate would be nothing if all we did was bash macro lagers."
"Overall, not the worst macro lager, but by no means my favorite. Don't intend to drink much more of this in the future, but certainly served its purpose in the past."
"D- Depends. Not a great beer, but not offensive. On a hot July Nashville day its seems pretty good though."
"Pours a light yellow color with little to no head. What is present of a head gives way quickly. The aroma is of a slight corn but not really anything to the aroma. The taste is watery but of slight grains. The mouthfeel is fizzy and slightly over carbonated. Overall it is a beer you would have one of and quit, it is very simplistic and doesn't have very much character to it."
"D- None. I finished the can because I do not pur beer, even awful beer."
"I'm generally not one to trash a beer this thoroughly, but this might be one of the worst beers I've ever tasted. I figured it'd be inoffensive enough on a hot summer day, but I was wrong. Should've stuck to Pabst."
"This beer has a very pale brass color with a lot of carbonation to the body. It is very clear. It actually has a real nice thick head that settles to a moderate head with some staying power. It has a very weird fizzy white lace. It has a very grainy adjunct aroma. It has a watery body with some carbonation bite. The flavor has some mild hops but it has a lot of corny tones."
"D- I always seem to enjoy macro's a bit more out of a can vs a bottle. I drank three cans of this easily without a hitch, and it was just what I needed on this hot summer day. I've had this out of a bottle and could not finish it, so there is that."
"D: this beer is my favorite to drink on a hot day just cause its a classic beer that you cant beat for its price"
"Drinkability: This might be good with food at a barbecue or something, but it's nothing special."
"D- Good drinking game/sporting event/BBQ beer."
"This beer gives great head and is about as fizzy as any I have drunk, drank, whatever. Not a complex brew and is easy to drink. Reminds me of my misspent youth. And the price has seemed to go up much since then. This is still my first choice among the cheap beers."
"It was clearly very pale yellow thrugh the clear bottle, but thats fine. What would you expect? It smelled of corn and grain like any other adjuct. The taste was ok, i prefer it over coors any day. It was very corny with no bitterness whatsoever. Mouthfeel was an overcarbonated water. All together a drinkable beer for a big party or something since its so cheap and readily available."
"The only thing this beer has going for it is its price, $12 for a 24 case."
"The mouth is watery as water. Very thin and weak. Flavor is weak lemony grass and cheap grains. Nothing to this at all. Refreshing? Yes. Good? No. I'll pass."
"""Holy $hit, I don't believe it."""
"Taste is not as bad as the aroma, but it's still very unremarkable. Strange sweetness. Lots of corn, moreso than other macros. I think I'd rather have a Bud or a PBR over this stuff. Wonder if it's any better out of the bottle. Drink it straight from the can to spare yourself the off aroma and corn."
"Pours a pale straw golden yellow with a large fizzy white head that quickly dissolves and leaves no trace of existence. The nose is filled with grain and some earthy hops although the nose overall is pretty faint, I would say that is mostly grain. Flavor is almost identical to the aroma with a gentle bitterness. Its light bodied and is very carbonated. This and PBR are my two beers of choice if I'm at a complete dive bar or if I'm going to camping or such."
"great drinkability. this is what i used to drink when low on funds. it is the 'champagne' of beers"
"D -- Well, uh -- yeah, it's refreshing and thirst quenching, as the BJCP guidelines says it is -- but so is water. This ""beer"" really has nothing to make you notice it, which is fine for non-serious beer drinkers, and it fits the style category, but I'd like a little something for my effort."
"I enjoy this beer. I'm not sure if it's the nostalgia that makes me like it or if it's just a decent macro. Probably a bit of both."
"This is not a beer that particularly agrees with me. More malt, less corn."
"Drinkability is good. Not much to excite the senses, but refreshing and non-offensive. I'll have to temper my disdain."
"Pours a clear light gold with medium head. Smells like sweet nectar. Pretty tasty for a super cheap beer. Tastes like sweet nectar with a zest of honey and corn, watered down. Nice and refreshing for the right day of the summer. Nothing quite like sitting out on the patio on a hot summer day sucking down a cold pitcher of Miller High Life."
"D - One of my go-to beers for an every day drinker. It's cheap (almost as cheap as The Beast but about 100x better) and good for what it's worth. No real difference between can and bottle to me."
"Great drinkability! For a non-light beer, this beats any other and the price won't break the bank either. A great beer to have on hand for any sporting event when you're looking to pass the time."
"Like I said not an everyday beer but it works well in a pinch."
"excellent drinkability. once again, something that can be lended to the marketing, but this a great beer for everybody to have at the cookout. cheap, average, does the job."
"You could do better. You could do worse. All in all, it is a beer that goes down easy and is not over filling but delivers enough flavor to make it substantially better than your average macro lager."
"D: It is what it is. I got a twack of this for $8. Great for those times when your friends who have no money come over and just want to get drunk."
"Overall, easy-drinking summertime, lawnmower beer. Not great, but not horrible. Living the high life!"
"High Life passes as a drinkable macrolager that runs a few nickles cheaper than the heavily advertised BMC stuff. High Life, PBR, and Old Style have a place in my fridge for cheap-ass beer that doesn't bore me to death or taste like vomit."
"D- so easy to drink ..nice on a hot day"
"d- it is what it is, pretty drinkable, your not gonna drink this when you want a nice tasty craft beer experience."
"The ""Champagne of Beers"" indeed, this cult macro lager is clearly mass produced and not of the most interesting or flavorful variety, but with its fluted casing and clean, bubbly, refreshing flavor, it will forever hold a place in my heart."
"I haven't had any beers made by the macros since 2000 with the exception of reviewing Bud's American Ale, and Miller High Life. This is the only beer made by any of them which I actually go to as a default beer if nothing else is available. Poured it into a pint glass. Pours a golden yellow color. Not much in the aroma except some bready malt and grain. Taste on the sweet side with good crispiness. Aftertaste had some veryt light lingering honey. Very easy to drink a lot of this. To this day still my only default macro beer. Not too bad."
"-Bye"
"This is a middle of the road lager for the style, certainly not terrible but not one I'd want to drink very often. It definitely tasted better after I had the shot of Old Overholt though. Nice combo!"
"D: Same as the mouthfeel. Absolutely stay away from this one. As far as I'm concerned, the worst of the macros."
"Not the first beer I'd reach for in the macro section of the beer aisle."
"Overall, refreshing and drinkable but simple and unexciting."
"Having never tried High Life before, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I'm actually rather enjoying it, and it may even supplant PBR as the cheapie of choice."
"Poured from the bottle into my mouth. My grandfather used to drink this beer while mowing the lawn in the summer. He did it based solely on how refreshing it looked. He's right and thats why I'm scoring it so high on appearance. It smells like corn, but not too strong in my opinion. You shouldn't be smelling this beer anyway. Beer is for drinking, you ass. It tastes crisp, and fairly clean. Not of a lot of corny sliminess that happens in these cheap American lagers. Mouthfeel is on target of the style (light) and the drinkability is awesome. This beer is designed to be drank in a session."
"Clear and yellow in bottle. Froths slight when opened. Smells slightly sour and urinelike. Flavor is a little grainy with a faint flicker of hop bitterness, but mostly a flat corny sweetness. A little sourish bitterness on the back end. The Mouthfeel is quite thin, leaving a little sourness behind."
"D-Good lawn mowing beer, outside working I could see drinking one that someone handed me, not so sure the situations I would buy it in tho."
"D: For a cheap macro its pretty easy to pound these puppies all night long... so if your at a college party and your already drunk might as well knock em' back anyways."
"D: Tolerable. I'd enjoy myself if a college party had this as its staple beer."
"Mouth is light and a bit over carbonated but really quite refreshing. Drinks fast especially on a hot day but I wouldn't pick it up regularly. I wouldn't turn one down though."
"How do you rate drinkability on something like this? It's not offensive enough to pour down the drain, but also something where I'd probably choose water, soda or some other beer if served at a party. That's not snobbery--that's just attempting to stay a contented human being. Times have changed--there's no reason for beer to be this bland. So, not my new favorite beer after all..."
"You could drink this beer all night long. Perfect for weddings, graduation parties, or a short budget $4.89 a sixer."
"This beer is designed to be drinkable by the masses. While I wouldn't refuse it, it wouldn't choose it either. There is just so much more potential to beer."
"D: Yeah its drinkable, nothin that I'll hold myself to drinking by the case but its the average joe's beer. And its an all around good beer if you're really not into micro-brews."
"Drinkability - Ok all the flaming aside this is where this beer does work. It goes down as smooth as honey. If you are looking for a good session beer for a bare bone price this is it. This is actually the only Miller product that I will actually drink under my own provision. I am a broke college student so I can't always afford my favorite beer so at 4 bucks for a 6 pack of tall boy cans I find myself drinking alot of these. Bottom line is it is not a great beer, it is a relatively decent beer that wins the cheap beer war between natti ice, busch , and busch light. I must say there are some great memories with this beer but it is nothing special."
"Overall: Its certainly better than Nati Light. But certainly not something I would drink given a larger budget. Great for college, not for much else..."
"what can i say about the beer of champagnes that hasnt already been said? to me high life is the lowest possible beer you can buy. tastes gross too fizzy, and doesnt even get you drunk unless you drink like twenty while running laps. corpo junk brew.if you havent had it then dont worry im sure youll be able to see it at every store in the entire world."
"Decent drinkability. There's not much to fend me away, but then there's also not much to draw me in."
"If you're at a gas station wondering what to buy in the 4-5 dollar range, this is it."
"Poured from can into chalice - 18 packet christmas gift from former brewery worker. Pale yellow clear appearance - head is fairly tight - some soapiness little to no lacing. Smells grainy tastes same with a little roasty - corn - hops not detected - finishes pale and a bit sweet - too sweet for me. Poured rest in for cooking brats. Mouthfeel great in terms of carb - light body not unexpected. Slightly surprised - especially in terms of appearance - but too sweet for me to consider good session wise."
"Drinkability - I'm on my 2nd in this tasteing and I'll be drinking the other 4 this evening. I grew up in the corn country of Ill. and had many of these growing up. Even been to the brewery when I was in boot camp at Great Lakes. So I'm a little partial to this beer. Loved it then and love it now. Will always be my stand by."
"Drinkability- the drink ability to this is great for sure, you could easily have one of these and want many more, its one of the better american macros to me for sure, full flavor is here for the style of what it is, it is better than many of the other macros in my view, very tasty crisp and refreshing, and you have to also admire the quality considering how incredibly low the cost is where you could get 30 beers for only 13 bucks, pretty incredible considering some macros are 7 or more bucks and not even better at all, good for what they are they are a one i would visit occasionally especially if i was trying to stay on a budget,"
"Appearance is light golden in color with a very thin head and lace. Smell has a very light sweet adjunct aroma. Taste is a light, but well balanced between the sweet and the hop with good carbonation. Mouthfeel is crisp and light making it overall one of the best American (adjunct) lagers that I do enjoy drinking."
"What a delicious beer. Personally I would rank it as the third best BMC product. Rich golden color and sweet smell and a bubbly pour. The beer feels great in your mouth, but more importantly tastes amazing. Just a great all-around beer with a price tag that is begging you to buy it."
"It has a nice smooth taste that you usually don't find in a cheap beer. It is also very drinkable, its not filling at all and is good from both bottles and cans."
"Drinkability is outstanding, as I could probably drink 10 of these in a night if I wanted to."
"Drinkability- This beer is extremely light and goes down easy. Well suited for casual drinking games with a group because it doesn't fill you up."
"An average macro lager - no standout qualities, for the mass market tastes as it has a decent lager cut to it."
"Feels like carbonated water but there's nothing really horrible about this beer. For whatever reason it seems to be the most tolerable macro I can remember but obviously I'd still avoid it if I can help it. But hell, for those guys who just drink beer for the effects, I suppose this is the best tasting thing you can get for about the cheapest price around. Is that worth anything?"
"D - Well, what do you expect from a value priced light lager? I personally have a soft spot for high life; it has more flavor than some other, more expensive macro lagers and it is very easy to drink way too many of these. Not a great beer, but again... what do you expect from the Champagne of Beers?"
"Overall: One of the better adjuncts in my book. Decent flavor and highly drinkable...Consume in large quantities."
"Overall this beer is what it is; a decent beer at a cheap price. It's not a beer that is going to wow anybody or make someone tell all of their friends about it. But, if you are short on cash and need some beer, this by far the best bet for your money."
"Poured a 7 ounce bottle of Miller High Life into my Sam Adams Sensory Glass. The 7 ounces was poured aggressively, since I knew I had plenty of glass space, and the head touches the ""Sam Adams Boston Lager"" line. The appearance is average (3.0), but I guess that's good for an American Adjunct Lager with lots of tiny bubbles rising up through the yellow swill. The smell is neither good or bad, there just isn't any. The taste is what you'd expect. Average (3.0). Nothing that says, this is a great beer. Mouthful and drinkability go from average (3.0) to good (4.0) because if you're looking for an easy drinking beer for a night of socializing, I guess this would be a good choice."
"High Life is the king of cheap beers. In my opinion it is the finest of the BMC beers, and no that is not a joke. This beer is amazingly drinkable, and tastes smooth and bubbly. In fact, for a macrobrew, the taste is about as good as I have had. The smell is a bit weird, and is the only true knock I have on the High Life. The bottle design is legendary, and when you have a High Life in your hand at a college party, you feel classy, even though you have spent very little money. I will always have a special place in my life for the High Life, and frequently drink even when I have more expensive, ""better"" options to choose from."
"this is the best beer i've had FOR THE STYLE."
"It does have a bit of gasiness to it and that pulls down the drinkability score."
"Drinkability: Eh, I'll drink it if you set it in front of me or give it to me free. It's basically alcoholic water. You don't drink it for flavor, you drink it for the effects. Still, not actively unpleasant and there are worse macros out there."
"Straw yellow color with a large white head that quickly settles to a thin cap. A surprising amount of lacing is left on the glass. Just a little better looking than most macro's. On the sweeter side of aroma and taste as well. No bitterness or hops detected. Nothing really spectacular but just average. Light body with a fizzy carbonation which is expected in the style. An average macro at an economical price."
"I am convinced that my Dad and Uncles were right about this beer. Unlike Pop's favorite, Hamm's, High Life ranks right up there with good, clean drinkable beer. It is a fine example of taste, price, look, mouthfeel and it has no lingering effects of YUCK afterwords. For the price, drink the crap out of this."
"Ah, the High Life, fellas... the High Life."
"Overall: marginal"
"I can consistently pick up a 4-pack 16oz cans for $2.50."
"Out of a 24 oz can this classic with a girl on the moon was a straw gold color with a nice, two-finger head. The retention was good and it left curtains of lacing. The aroma was of grain and corn mash with some stale notes. The flavors were metallic, stale and yeast with all the mash notes in the aroma along with some slightly citric/sour notes that arrived as it warmed up. The mouthfeel was a little rough and I just couldn't get past the flavors as it warmed up."
"D- decent.... This stuff is dirt cheap and you get what you pay for."
"Bought a 40 ouncer just because I could. I must say I now understand why college kids buy this at $1.50 a pop. It tastes like junk and not worth a penny more. Actually they should pay me to drink it. I guess it tastes better if you tape it to your hands..."
"overall drinkability is very high. if you are going to drink a beer from this category there is none better. super clean and refreshing. replace your daily water intake with Miller High Life."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a thick white head. Beer is very clear. Decent head retention that develops a nice collar and good laciness. Simple aroma of cereal grains, primarily barley. Taste is also simple but decent. Mainley barley and a little hops. Simple mouthfeel, light and thin on the tongue. Simple but enjoyable beer. Recommended for hanging in the garage or in the outdoors. Not much flavor and light on the alcohol for recommendation as a session beer."
" Drinkable: very easy to put alot of these down with out trying not filling at all"
"Tried living the High Life for the first time, for the cost I had to give it a shot. Standard American lager look, yellow color but one thing that stood out is the incredibly foamy head this beer creates. It was thick and quite nice looking for a macro lager. Taste was decent. Malt and corn, with the slightest hint of hops in there. Thin in the mouth and a standard lager smell. I knocked back a sixer of these and enjoyed them just fine. Not a bad choice at all for those looking for a cheap lager to go with the game. I'll be living the High Life more often now I think considering the price."
"The type of beer that your dad might drink on the weekends. Not heavy and is really a beer for those times that your short in cash."
"As far as macros go, it's not bad. Just don't smell it."
"Besides that, I don't mind the high life. I like the clear bottle, exposure to light can't hurt it anymore than it already is. It pours easy, and it drinks easy. I definitely like it better than any light beer and anything else in the same catgory. It is a simple, cheap macro brew that pretty much anyone can stand."
"D: This beer is easy drinking, has decent flavor, a really nice look for the style, and decent feel. Sure it smells like ass, but its a macro. Mind you, I am not comparing this beer against an Abyss or anything, just other macros. Scoff if you wish, but if High Life was currency, I'd be rich, BITCH!"
"The only macro-brew I'll willingly purchase and keep in the house because it tastes nothing like the other macros. Pours a clear light gold with tons of carbonation creating a big soapy head that dissipates quickly but leaves a bit of lacing in its wake. It smells very much like corn and dead grass. Taste is mostly bland on the palate, though some of the corniness (no pun intended) is detectable and is actually enjoyable. The weight is light and the mouthfeel is fine; this beer is pretty drinkable on a hot day."
"Try this beer if you have no money or dont want to get drunk while drinking a 12 pack."
"Nose is about like the keystone I just tried (cheap beer night) with some faint malty note that lean a bit to corn side. A faint DMS aroma is apparent. Taste is not so hot. That DMS came back and it has a bit of a over-the-hill character akin to wet cardboard....i.e. oxidation. Body is light and the carbonation is a bit astringent. I don't think I'll having another, unless is all that's left in the boat."
"Overall this one is pretty bland and boring. Nothing exciting."
"Pours golden with a large head. Pretty smooth for a light beer, not bitter at all. I'm going to make this one short and sweet, for a light America beer it isn't bad. I'm more of a lager/bock kinda guy, but this isn't a bad light beer. Also great for playing beer pong with."
"Pours a very clear golden color with massive amounts of head and some very decent lacing. Scent was fine, very sweet with a slight jerky undertone. Nice taste, crisp and refreshing, if not robust; little bits of malt with noticable adjuncts (very sweet corn). It does go down very easily. For a macro lager, it's actually quite good."
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwKl1Pq58a0"
"After picking up a couple of 30 racks of this (for $13 each), I've been drinking it so much that I should probably review it. Dark yellow pour, a bit transparent, thin but big patchy head. Smells lagery with a some nice grassy hops. Tastes a bit corny, with some DMS (cooked vegetable taste). Normally considered a flaw, but it's actually not too bad. At least it has SOMETHING, unike bud and shyt like that. Some grassy hops come in with the flavor and balance as well. light bodied, high carbonation. very drinkable. My choice poor-man's-beer along with PBR. Don't hate."
"(rated May 26, 2007)"
"This review is a bit on a curve, taking in account the taste vs. price aspect. As for all of the mass produced ""big"" beers out there, this is by far my favorite. Much better then Coors, Bud, or the other Miller products. Has an easy drinking feel which makes it quite easy to enjoy multiples in one sitting. A great beer for the ""struggling artists"" of the world. While wishing one was drinking a better beer, you can be satisfied know the money you spent to enjoy ""a" beer was well worth it. Not the greatest look or smell, but again pound for pound an excellent beer that you can usually find in most places."
"After four years of Miller-sponsored fraternity parties, I can confidently say I am a pro at rating this garbage. Pours clear yellow with a bubbly white head. Pungent skuny aroma, chemically-bitter. Bad, but not as bad as MGD or others. Tangy, grainy, and not that sweet, kind of a surprise. But, the real treat is yet to come as this clear glass bottle contains the world's worst hangover."
"A light golden Pale Lager Macro,lots of fizz,faint malt,and hop aromas and flavors, but I can get this on the cheep, I like it better that Bud and the same as Coors bit it's cheeper. I have this on had a lot in the summer for some binge drinking and an after work thirst quencher.Drinkable"
"Of what the big three American breweries have to offer this is the one I like the most. It pours a pale yellow color with a hint of sweet malt in the smell. The taste is clean but nothing special. I usually only have this one on a hot day when I am outside, like playing golf or out on a boat. I also use this beer for beer pong and I like it with a ham sandwich."
"I think this beer can be enjoyable if you have a thirst to get drunk.or not depends on ones taste. but im glad i picked up this 12 pk, nice bottle, clean taste..little after taste and easy drink ability."
"No one here is going to like this beer, but it is the best brats beer out there...Maybe Hamms is a slightly better beer to boil your brats, but it is open for discussion. Watery and balnd, this is the working man's beer. It tastes amazing when compared to it's light counterpart."
"Pours a clear golden yellow urine-like color with a very thn fizzy white head that quickly dissapears. Aroma is of corn and fraternity house hallways. Although it looks and smells awful it is actually very easy to drink and can be refreshing."
"Taste: Not much taste at all to it. The malts are overshadowed by the adjuncts, whatever those may be."
" Pretty standard fair for a Macro without too much ""off' aspects."
"Overall, not a bad option for your typical macro lager."
"D: It's definitely corny, but it doesn't make it bad by any stretch of the imagination. Very drinkable and easy to session. Better from the bottle, as it lacks some of the metallic and soda-like characteristics that pop up from the can."
"Miller High Life was not a pleasant drinking experience. The gold coloring falsely implies a clean refreshing taste, however, the taste was just bad. It really was like a massive rush of metallic slopiness hitting my taste buds at one time and I was unable to finish the beer. I would recommend Miller Genuine Draft and Miller Lite over High Life."
"I had the opportunity to drink a genuine Miller High Life when I visited Buffalo, since I'm from Canada, the High Life you get here is brewed by Molson, and tastes nothing like the real mccoy. I really dig the unique bottle. Anyway, golden yellow color, looks like every other macro. The smell is just bad, smells old, musty, cardboardy, just bad. Now the taste on the other hand, is actually pretty good. Nice and smooth, macroy taste. Your typical macro experience, minus the off flavors most cheap macros have, just your stock beer. Mouthfeel is actually decent, nice and smooth, and full bodied. I had this one with some big chicken wings at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, and man did this beer pair perfectly with those wings, i could easily drink alot of these with ease. Quite enjoyable. Stop the bashing, its good for what it is, and at 1.50$ a beer, a price ill never see at a restaurant in Canada, this was great! Highly Recommended!"
"D: Not as bad as the Miller beers that slot in below the High Life price point. That's the best praise I can give. I would never buy this. I made it about ¼ of the way through my glass before I poured it out."
"Overall a very good AAL. Good job Miller!"
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - If I had to, I could toss back a 6 pack of this beer. Any more than that and I would get tired of the stale corny, rice like flavors that this beer is made of. Not much to say, it's cheap, and that's about all I like about this beer. I don't recommend anyone try this beer, it's a little one profile and gets boring and tiring fast! If your into American Adjuncts, then look else where cause there are allot better ones out there in my opinion."
"It's beer -- nothing very distinctive about it. Pretty corny-tasting, but clean and crisp. It lacks the gnarly aftertaste I find in Bud products, but also lacks the tasty,slight hoppy bitterness to be found in PBR. I'd choose Blue Ribbon over this any day, but a 24-oz can of this stuff for a $1.50 on impulse at Von's can't be beat on a Saturday afternoon."
"Pours a ""bright"" color, almost yellow fizz. Decent head that actually sticks around a bit. Awful smelling brew, kinda skunky but NOT nearly as bad as macro imports. That is the bad, oh, and awfully thin mouthfeel, but that is to be expected. Tastes good, a bit corny, dry aftertaste, nothing overly offensive. A twelve of these can be gone in a matter of 3 hours, very easy to drink. There are worse beers out there, this one is very economical, and don't forget, used to be regarded in the same light as budweiser, now $3 less a twelve pack. It is good for what it is."
"D= pretty high, if it weren't for the taste I could drink a ton"
"well I had to go and buy a second twelver of these fine mediocre beers. I mean it aint that bad. really I mean it tastes like beer ya know so what could be worse It aint no ice beer or a lambic or a belgium. It is some single row malt with some sugar and a dusting of low alpha hops. but I don't mind drinking it so I give it an overall c to c- but for 11.99 a halfrack and with the sweet champagne bottles I felt it wern't too bad after all. so I got's me another twelve this fine halloween mornin'. I kinda like this for a work beer when I sit back and paint I likes to sip on a brew and you know this one is a brew so therefor it must be kinda okay... smells like beer, tastes like beer, it must be beer...."
"Pretty light bodies, lots of carbonation. This is a refreshing beer, I love to knock back a few while grilling in the summer etc. Granted there are far better beers I could pick up but sometimes I just feel like something simple and refreshing."
"Clear yellow color with a finger of so of white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is fairly typical of of AML, some corn and very little else. Some corn flavor, a bit of bitterness, standard AML flavor. Crisp, relatively dry. Mouthfeel is, well, ehh... light- body with very high carbonation. Some""bite"" from the carbonation, dry. Drinkability is, well, rather good, considering. This is unoffensive, in a way, as intentioned and easily (only if quite inebriated) drunk. I'll admit that the the High Life played a formative role in my college years (though not as much as Kesystone light or my personal ""favorite"" Busch Light"") but I'm really can't give this a good review when I look at it critically."
"Miller high life is a great choice for a cheap beer. It's just a good refreshing american macro. It's much better than any other Miller product and beats but light by a long shot. Not much to describe. It has a horrible canned corn smell, but doesn't taste anything like it smells, thank god. It's an old-timey drink for sure, and you can't drink it expecting a work of art, just a decent tasting cheap beer."
" Bud, Coors...you must be crazy!!! If you want a tastey beer at a tastey price, join the common sense movement ant vote HIGH LIFE!!!"
"3.5/3/3/2.5/4"
"With a label that says high life, it leads you to think it's something special. The only real difference I could tell with this beer is that it is very drinkable. Every other aspect in this brew is pretty bland average. Not a bad choice for this type of beer, but no award winner either."
"This is a beer for the masses, and perhaps one of the finest of it's style. Appearance is a crystal-clear straw yellow with a thin bright white fizzy head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is weak, sweet and malty. Tastes just as it smells, watery and slightest hint of hoppiness fades as quickly as it comes in, sweet malty aftertaste, lightly drying. Mouthfeel is very light and watery, light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Drinkability is nothing short of incredible, a true acheivement for this beer's price and availability. I don't know a single person who enjoys beer, from cheap macros to the best belgian brews who can say that this isn't their really cheap beer of choice."
"Light flavor, some slight bitterness but it is covered over by what malt is there. No off flavors however and fairly well balanced. Easy to drink and less sweet than MGD although just as smooth."
"If reviewed as this site intends (by style) this beer deserves at least a 3.0 in all categories. The only American Macro that matches it is Yuengling."
"So this is living the High Life? Hey, this stuff drinks pretty well for its weight class. Could be much worse. Good, easy-drinking macro."
"Champagne of beer, eh? I can see some similarities...highly carbonated, sweet and full of adjuncts...my guess is corn. Not a horrible tasting beverage, just not very beer-like. Cheap, smooth and somewhat crisp. What else would one expect? Drinkable...but barely."
"I'll always have a soft spot for High Life and it's crispness. We all know what it looks like. It pours the color of dried hay with a bit of fizz at the top forming a pseudo-head that fades into nothingness. Lacing is wishful thinking. Smells a bit grassy and malty with hints of crushed saltine (the unsalted kind)... nothing to write home about but nothing that turns me away. Taste starts out with a bit of corn and nuts, followed by a bit of malt. It's light and not very big on the flavor. Crisp and refreshing is more the name of the game. It's carbonation can be overpowering, but there's not really any flavor to overpower, so it's not a big issue. On the whole, it's fairly drinkable. I lived off of it one summer and survived. It kept me alive. And it's cheap. If i had to pick one cheap beer to drink regularly, I'd probably have to tap High Life. It's the best of the worst, so to speak."
"Drinkability is low. The flavor is kind of making me sick. Poorly constructed and not enjoyable."
"Right from the bottle, only way to enjoy the high life. smells of corn, but the taste is different. i swear this beer is belgian influenced( not comparing it to duvel don't worry). the huge bone white head, and the slightly phenolic flavor all seem belgian like to me. either way, its the best macro on the market."
"If I wanted a beer to drink outside on a hot day, it would be a hefeweizen or a witbier, but if I feel like being cheap, this works as well. I'm cheap in certain things, but beer is NOT one of those things."
"Ah, the high life.. the champagne of beers. I think this is the best cheap beer money can buy. An 18 pack for $7.99? Can't beat that. Has much more taste than any of the other macros out there, but it seems to a hate it or love it sort of taste. It takes some getting used to but this is my go to party beer."
"Drinkability: very drinkable for those hot summer days when you need a nice refreshing brew that's not too heavy."
"Really, it's not as awful as some macro lagers out there, though after this case is gone, I'm thinking my nostalgia for my earliest beer-drinking days will be over."
"D - This beer really does have some champaign characteristics to it which make it highly drinkable. Yeah, it's not a complex macro, but this a delicious and cheap beer to have at a BBQ, on a hot day after wrenching on cars, with mexican food or even to enjoy by itself when looking for something simple. This beer also has a tremendous amount of sedimental value to me - my great grandpa used to drink one a day until he died at 98. Every time I drink one, I think of him and feel pride. High life will always have a special place in my heart and in my fridge."
"Clear and golden, white head disappears, leaving no lacing. Aroma was nearly absent--not enough to describe. Flavor has no hop to speak of and not much malt. Thin and crispy thirst quencher, but I look for much more in a beer. Not the worst macro I've had; I probably won't have it again unless it's free, but it was worth the try."
"Very drinkable, primarily because it doesn't seem to place any demands on the palate the way a beer with flavor would. While it tastes better than the Budweiser I recently drank, that's like saying a Gremlin was a better car than a Pacer - it could be true, but does anyone really care?"
"I can't believe I never reviewed this beer. I guess when you review one you feel like you've reviewed em all. This is a bad beer but considering it's competition I suppose you could do worse. Low quality corn, grain, rice, malty mix that doesn't taste very good. It's watery enough to make it go down without too much of a grimace. Barely drinkable and a notch above the pour-down-the-drain Beast level. It is cheap as hell so at least it's got that going for it."
"D. I was able to get this down by just focusing on the fact it was cold. Though not any where near an award winner, its far better than Miller Light."
"An incredibly poor beer. When poured into a glass, the head transforms into a sort of soapy amalgam which adheres to the glass, sure, it's lacey, but not tasty. The overall mouthfeel resembles the likes of grain alcohol mixed with burnt corn kernels, along with a hint of sticky carbonation. I hate this beer. Then again, if I'm in the mood to live the high life, I'll bury a 12 pack of it and not bust my wallet."
"I genuinely do not care for this beer at all...Firstly, it is bottled in clear glass (big no-no) but I guess it doesnt matter because the beer tastes the same either way. Secondly, it is priced the same as Natural Light (Im assuming its main competition)...Thirdly, it is THE clearest looking beer that I have ever seen...it looks like water with a drop of yellow food coloring! The taste is terrible, but better than Natty I guess..Overall this beer was made for college people with college budgets"
"In agreement with the guy on the commercial, charging $13 a bottle for this is clearly overpriced and exorbitant. Charging $4 for the six pack I bought might be pushing it as well."
"Drinkability: The first taste taken after a Sierra Nevada harvest ale, was too sweet to bear, towards the end I can do this, but if I'm drinking beer of this 'caliber' I'll probably stick with Pabst or Old Style both being cheaper and slightly less sweet, and close to my heart for sentimental reasons."
"D - Miller High Life isn't too bad as far as macros go; I think it's much better from the can than bottle. Still, I'd reach for another American stuff first."
"This is not my first choice when it comes to the classic american pale lagers but I do get the itch every once in a while. Yesterday my friend brought over a 12 pack of bottles for the Fiesta Bowl and after drinking a few porters I made the switch. I had two of these beauties right out of the bottle, they were cold, refreshing, and delicious! The key to the high life for me is to stop after two or three."
"Very cheap beer, but a fair taste. Personally I prefer low-carbonation drinks and this is one of my top-picks as a cheap alternative (if your looking for super cheap think Busch or Natural Light- but I don't like the amount of carbonation) . However this is another beer that I think has almost no alcohol content. However b/c of the super low price tag, it is a top pick as, hey, beer is beer when you really really want one!"
"This is by far the best American macro lager that I have ever had!"
"Drinkability is good. I've had these lots of times, but usually not with a critical eye. I'm pleased with how palatable this is. For one of the cheapest beers you can find, this still beats most of the other macros. It's refreshing. Amongst the best ""bad"" beers for sure. It's going to score better for me than PBR, but mainly due to the surprisingly strong appearance. PBR smells a bit nicer, and the other differences are pretty marginal. We'll see if Schlitz can topple it later."
"Pours to a HUGE head that just sat there for a good few minutes before subsiding. The taste on this is...ummm...hmmm...taste....can you really adequately describe the taste of water? This tastes just like that. Yet, worse somehow. This ""beer"" is the true definition of ""yellow fizzy stuff""."
"D- Drinks great for a 5%ABV"
"Not that good. But I think most people already know that."
"D= heck you can afford it, if nothing else! Great for boiling brats and sausage with sauerkraut, though."
"Next, please."
"Not too bad for the style. Like my number suggests, I'd say it's slightly above average for the style. If you like the style. ;)"
"How this beer has achieved a better score than Budweiser is a mystery to me."
"Why do people buy such tasteless fizzy rubbish? I did, not knowing 'high life' really means 'low life' in American brewing advertising. I won't be making that mistake again."
"D- Read the last of what I wrote about taste."
"This beer tastes way better now than it ever has and I was pleasantly surprised by the full flavor and hop presence."
"Pours a light yellow in color with a white head. There was actually some pretty good lacing that stuck to the sides of the glass with each swallow. Smelled of corn and grains. Very faint smelling. Taste was actually not to bad. Had a slight sweet aftertaste. But at least it had some flavor. Felt a little watery in the mouth. Carbonation was just about right. This is a good lawnmower beer. Also would make a good session beer when your low on cash."
"It's a perfect beer to drink on a hot summer day if the cash flow is low. Definitely king of the cheaps and a good call."
"An aggro pour resulted in 1.5 finger's worth of rocky, bone-white head with low retention. Color was a pale yellow with a clarity that would be the standard-bearer for NE-quality. The nose was somewhat sweetish with an underlying graininess. Mouthfeel was thin to medium with a decent sweetness on the tongue. Finish was unobtrusive, at best. I remember as a young man, I really enjoyed this beer, but now, it was ho-hum at best. Too bad."
"The smell is a little malt, some misc cereal grain. Taste is light and refreshing, smooth, slightly dry finish, with just the tiniest bit of hop in there at the end somewhere. High Life is my ""chug one after coming in from working on the car in the sun"" beer, and for good reason, as its very inexpensive, thirst quenching, and remarkably palatable."
"This stuff is bubbly, straw yellow, with a white head that doesn't last (Who'da thought for an american macro?). I guess the only reason why I decided to review this was because I had a couple because they were cheap tonight and I was grossed out by how metallic it tasted. Had it on tap for a dollar per 10 oz. Very metallic certainly more hops than your average american macro (noble hops I think)... but overly metallic. Not suggested, unless you're on a mission to not be sober and have few means to reach such a goal. On one good note however I did see this in my grandfather's fridge when I was a kid and I have a lot of respect for him so the lady on the moon is at least a reminder of him."
"Can't believe we actually found High Life on tap. What's wrong with this city? Looks like piss with a nice head, although it dissolves down to nothing with the quickness. Nose is weak, but the flavor's an unobjectionable sweet malty grain and maybe corn. Feel isn't terrible, and I could drink about 50 of these (and do, every time). Really quite bad, but whatever, not as terrible as most of them, and kind of accepting of its terribleness."
"Now where's that bottle of Abyss..."
"Drinkability: Pretty smooth beer. Enough flavor that keeps you interested, but nothing intricate."
"If you can keep it ice cold its a decent lawnmower beer as they call them. Or for me when working on the car."
"D: could I pound these? Yes! Will I? No. not bad for the pool area, though."
"shrug."
"M/D: Decent mouthfeel, not heavy but lite and not grainy but smooth good amount of carbonation and a watery texture. Decent drinkability as well but of course I've had better."
"The feel is light and very carbonated. Miller is another macro that I will never buy. I might drink one if its the last beer on earth... or maybe not."
"I have a bunch of lagers I have never tried to mark off this summer. Mostly cheap ones readily available. This stuff was cheap and I had heard good things about it. Glad I tried it."
"High drinkability on this one because you can throw them back without being completely disgusted. Also cheap as hell. For the most part, it sucks less than other macros."
"It's light but very pleasant and the taste is persistent, not vanishing after the first sip like Coors, Busch, etc. It has a clear taste of grain and dry hay along with hops of grass, wet hay, and a hint of pine. It's thus both lightly sweet and lightly bitter. The finish is crisp, lightly bitter with both grain & hops."
"This beer poured a golden yellow with lots of visible carbonation and a thin head. The smell is pretty standard for a macro, a tiny bit of malt sweetness and a touch of corn adjunct. The taste is fairly unassuming, but I'm not sure what else you'd expect. A bit of sweet malt with a clean finish. It's not going to knock anyone's socks off, but you won't be thirsty anymore. The mouthfeel is standard macrobrew, watery without too much carbonation. The one thing this beer shines in is drinkability, and an average person could easily down ten or twelve without thinking about it."
"Not comparabile to a German or Vienna lager, but still the best American macro I've tried thus far."
"It was odd to have this beer in a glass without a bottlecap, quarter, or ping pong ball in it. For the style this really is a great beer. When you consider the price it no wonder even beer geeks often have this beer on hand if nothing else for when non-beer geek friends/family come over. Knock it if you want, but I've always liked the High Life."
"Prost!"
"Drinkablity: I have lived on this brew for decades. A sold brew for when you just want to have a cheap and unpretentious beer."
"Drinkable as all get out...just not with your beer snob friends...or your macro snob friends. No idea why this beer gets treated so second-classily by the sheeple drinking macro pisswater Bud Light, etc. It ain't awful, it tastes good and goes down easy. I like it. So there."
"Certainly, not my beer of choice, but something I will pick up from time to time."
"Notes- This is not a ""good"" beer by any stretch of the imagination; but my friend's dad always had a case of ponies in his fridge so it has a high nostalgia factor. This is definitely the first macro-brew I'm grabbing for whenever I feel the need to grab one."
"D- i used to love you, moon lady... what happened?"
"Drinkability: One could certainly do worse. The sweetness in this beer makes it quite nice on a stifling summer day, though it must be ice cold."
"I've often gone to Miller High Life when quantity of beer was more imperative than quality, although the price is slightly higher than Schlitz Ice, Black Label, or other non-BMC macrobrews. Although not the finest beer in the world, the ""Champagne of Beers"" comes through once again as a solid macrobrew."
"D- I have always enjoyed drinking this beer, and would consider it to be a good choice if looking for an economical beer."
"Pours a clear straw color with fluffy white head which lasts for a few minutes. Clumpy lacing. Smell: corn, light malt, touch of hops. Taste: light bready malts, good amount of corn adjunct, and a enough hops to balance the sweetness. Mouthfeel: light bodied with good carbonation, finish is slightly drying. Good example of macro lager."
"D--The High Life isn't a bad, but it isn't great either. In the macro world, it is a decent choice, probably the class of the big three, but nothing spectacular."
"This is my economy beer of choice for some time and I enjoy it regularly."
"D--Perhaps the ideal drinkable beer. FIVE all the way. I'm living the High Life. Are you? I unashamedly love this beer."
"D- Ummm, dare I put it on par with Labatt!?"
"Drinkability: Like I said before, this beer is tasteless and light bodied. It would be great if it only had some flavor. There is a reason why people can drink many of these."
"When drank right above freezing, this is a decent brew. It tastes mostly of grains, but has a crisp feel to it as well. As it warms, however, it gets pretty gross. It's really not that bad if you're drinking them fast and leaving the warm swill in the bottle."
"This beer makes my top 10 worst beers at least from what I've had so far. Appearance nice white head that stuck around a bit longer than I expected and even left a little lace. Smell cheep adjunents not much hop. Taste much the same as the smell with a bit of a funny aftertaste. Mouthfeel very high carbonation a bit to much if you ask me. Drinkability no thanks."
"Oh, and as far as power hours go, DO NOT USE THIS BEER!"
"Slight skunky smell, with some gross sweatiness thrown in for good measure. Tastes like a pale lager but with an off taste added. Not good, but I drank most of the bottle. How can you waste the champagne of beers? Boring stale, odd maltiness sums it up. Blech..."
"Overall I can say that it wasn't as bad as some people might have led me to believe (my roommate). Of the things I've heard about it, none were really positive, so this made me want to try it for myself so that I could review it. Can't knock something till you've tried it, right? With that said, it wasn't really 'terrible', but not good enough to really buy again."
"Therefore, I think I a little biased about this beer. It brings back too many memories to a fair rating. I just remember ""Living the High Life"" of yesteryear."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a clear light gold color with an inch and a half frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. It smells like sweet malt and corn. No offensive aromas at all. Taste is the same as the aroma, sweet malt and corn. Has a good clean finish. Also, there's no offensive tastes either. Mouthfeel/body is light with a little above average carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it does go down easy and it's not hard to drink. For the style, it's not bad. It wouldn't taste too bad on a hot day."
"Drinkability - Poor. this is another example of a poorly made mass produced beer."
"Drink ability: Very high drink ability. I could have this beer in the refrigerator all year. Overall, probably my favorite for this style of beer."
"Looks like force carbonated urine, but that is a trait of American Macros. Pretty good head formation though. Smell is very clean; only really catch some corn husk. Sweet creamy fresh corn. Smooth with a little bite from the carbonation and a slight touch of hop bitterness. Very easy to drink; nothing cloying or skunky; clean. A great lawnmower/tailgate beer."
"Taste - Mild pale malts and a distinct creamed corn-like sweetness. No hops or bitterness to be found. Fairly clean; judging by the aroma, I was expecting worse. Very light-bodied and crisp, high carbonation. Not the worst macro lager out there, but certainly not good."
"Drinkability: At $3.75/6-pk(in NH) this a worth picking up. A good refresher on a hot summer day or just lounging around the house. This is not a bad beer."
"Pours a clear, extremely light golden color. Little head that fades away pretty quickly. Smells of light malts, corn, and a tad skunk. Taste is not bad at all for what it is. Better than Bud and Coors. Its got more flavor than both anyhow. Tastes of mild grains, fresh wheat, and slightly metallic with not a whole lot of finish besides a moderately off taste, yet crisp. Smooth, very carbonated, and thin. As a lawn beer, or the nights when you want to slum it, so to speak, this wouldnt be a bad choice above the usual macros...besides 'Gansett."
"drinkability: exceedingly so. this beer has a nitch in my arsenal for a very good reason."
"Theeee champagne of beers."
"* (Yes, I call this a pils.. it's no Pilsner Urquell for sure, but the history of the big American brews IS pilsner, and old literature of these brands described themselves as such. Arbitrarily creating a 'American Macro' category [IMO] unfairly shields it from deserved objective criticism)."
"I have to say this is my favorite swilling beer. I'm always good for loading up my fridge in my basement with Miller in the summer time. Miller does have more carbonation than say Bud. I always get strange looks from my freinds when I break out the Millers...."
"Having said that, my opinion is that other American Macrobrews (Bud, MGD, Coors) offer more bang for their buck. Even against this undistinguished competition, Miller High Life is a straggler."
"Drinkability: It's a very drinkable beer. Especially on a hot day outside. The colder this beer the better!"
"Drinkability: Is this a great beer? No, but it does make a great session beer @ 5% ABV. I find it to beat out many other macros out there."
"Drinkability: Id say that High Life leans considerably towards a high drinkability. Its severely underrated and serves well as a session beer. Because of its light and rather above average taste, along with being good with multiple foods, I rated accordingly. Comes recommended."
"I would advise drinking this beer, especially in the pounder can, just like in the commercial. After you do some house/yard work, whatever makes you sweat more and physically tired, pop open a can. Can-wise, there's very little smell, but at least there's not a horrible alcohol smell like cheap Ice beers or aluminum. Since it is not malt liquor, there isn't a funky adjunct/sugary taste, and you can consider it a ""session"" beer (not to sully that term though). Very cheap too."
"The flavor isn't much different: a bit of wheat and pale malts, not much else besides water. Mouthfeel is metallic, bitter (not in the hoppy, good way), and depressing. Ahh college days. I'd drink this only to get a good buzz, and not much else reason-wise."
"Considering the style and the price, this isn't a bad beer at all. This is my go to American macro lager when I need something cheap. The taste has a pleasant sweetness that masks some of the corn adjunct taste. It's easy and refreshing to drink. Best enjoyed in a frozen mug with friends on a hot day with pizza or BBQ."
"It is essencially the upgrade version of Miller Lite. I happen to enyoy the Miller products for the big 3 beers in America. I am not that impressed but will pick this one over Coors or Bud. I cannot say that this was a beer I thourghouly enjoyed but will say it is not a hangover beer.Decent job miller"
"This I can handle. Although I am not the biggest fan of smelling things like corn and such, not too bad and tastes good I feel when chilled. moderate smoothness, and decent head retention which is lite and fluffy. A stronger taste that MGD I feel but almost as smooth. Not a bad beer IMO"
"When you are playing a long game of cards, watching football, and in other long social gatherings, Miller High Life is a great companion."
"It isnt hard for me to drink this stuff all night. I have only had it in the bottle and the taste hasnt changed in the last 10 years or so. It is available everywhere I have been. It is one of my default macros."
"D: I could drink this beer all the day through. This beer keeps getting better until its too late, but I guess this is true with all alcohol and the hedonists that consume it. This was my Dad's beer of choice and the beer he weened me on. I always think of him when I have one, so to me this beer is fucking one of the best."
"Drinkability: The simple fact that I survived for weeks at a stretch during college ""living the high life"" speaks to the ability of one to just keep drinking this beer. It doesn't really go with anything or clash with anything. It's just generic beer that you can keep pounding if you're a college student."
"I was feeling frisky one night and decided to pick something up that won't break the bank. It is a very pale straw urine color. No head. I prefer this one out of the bottle because the swigging motion refreshes what little head there is. Light grainy stale scent. I think there might be some hops hidden behind the carbonation while it rests on my tongue. Fades quicly. Not much to the aftertaste. Actually has some (very minimal) body to it, at least more so than most macros. Not fantastic but my go to in EXTREMELY tough times when choosing from the BMC line up. Neh."
"Had to come back and re-rate this as I was probably too harsh with my last assessment. Poured a clear yellow color into a Pilsener glass. Big white frothy head that suprised me how long it lasted. Not much in the aroma department, pretty lacking here. Taste is slightly malty with very, very little hop character at all. Very smooth and mouthfeel is good. Drinkability is pretty high, this is about as good as a BMC gets."
"D: My favorite crap beer by far. You could drink these all day, but your colon would punish you in the morning."
"Still, all in all, there is a market for this. I just don't happen to be a part of it."
"D: Pretty good refreshing stuff, but not a beer to savor. Heck, don't even bother making your glassware dirty."
"D - I probably won't drink this again but its drinkable if you don't like strong tastes"
"Drinkability: Low alcohol content and simple, yet non-bland flavor make this a session beer. Much better than many American Macro lagers, but doesn't break the mold by any means. Would probably be good with barbecue and Mexican."
"D: builds to a harsh finish--don't even want to finish it. I have a hard time believing that this was marketed as a high end beer back in the 60s."
"Best cheap beer out there. After realizing that my drinking habit was getting a little expensive, I turned to a 30-rack of miller high life in between the real stuff to spare my wallet. Highly carbonated, but pleasantly malty, with an actual taste of beer unlike the other grade B beers. Bonus points for attractive bright orange can, more bonus points for being under 50 cents per beer. It'll get ya drunk."
"D - Outstanding. You could drink this for hours and hours on end. Recommended if you want a cheap buzz."
"This is another one of my college beers. It does have some weird corn smell to it when you pour it into a mug. A nice head of foam on this piss colored beer. I am not really knocking it, because the price was right. I guess you get what you pay for. My advice would be to drink it from a frosty glass. This way the bad aftertaste is hidden and you can still get a buzz for cheap. This along with pbr were my favorite party beers back in college. Drink it fast, because its going to get nasty quick!"
"Ok this is bringing back memories. I used to get these 32oz bottles all the time in my younger years. Geez it's been awhile since I've had one. Pours a golden yellow, very carbonated with a white surprisingly dense head. Smells corn-y. Taste is much of the same, lots of corn. Corn-y aftertaste. Leaves a gritty sticky feel on your teeth afterwards, I feel like I need to brush them now. The only beer I've ever had that has done that. ""The champagne of beers""? I don't think so. A drinkable macro? Yes."
"Once again , as reviewed to style I really enjoy this beer. ""Champagne of beers"" may not be the most appropriate name, but maybe the ""Champagne of Macro Lagers"". For anyone looking for a good American Macro to try, this is a good bet."
"Very drinkable for an adjunct lager and always has a place in my heart (I like the logo). Another bonus...it's cheap!"
"Pours an extremely pale yellow with a small white head. Super filtered. Smells faintly malty. Tastes of subdued grain, slightly sweet, with a tiny bit of hops to round it off. Highly carbonated, with a thin mouthfeel. Quite drinkable, it would not be hard to drink several of these. For the price, it's hard to complain, but this style of beer wouldn't be something I would usually buy."
"I could drink this all day. It's like water. Nothing terrible, nothing interesting, instead it's simply quite drinkable. And if you're in a pinch in a shitty bar in the middle of nowhere, this beer might become your best friend."
"Not a bad beer for one of the cheapest ones on the market. Pours bright yellow with brown hue. Smells decent of hops. Taste is very good for a cheap beer. Mouthfeel is nothing special, just alot of carbonation like all the other macros. Drinkable brew and I would like it if I were outside working. My dad had me drinking this stuff when I was a baby, so it holds a special place in my heart still."
"Very drinkable. Pretty good, for what it is."
"I usually can drink the hell out of these but it wasn't happening for me tonight. Maybe because I was actually paying attention to it. Pale golden with almost no head but highly carbonated and the bubbles kept coming. Wasn't much of a smell at all. Tasted weak and watered down; a little floral to me. Smooth beer that you can definitely drink while mowing the lawn."
"gets their asses capped because of it."
"***WARNING: DO NOT LET THIS BEER WARM-UP!!! IF YOU DO, IT COULD LEAD TO A RATHER NASTY EXPERIENCE***"
"PS: I actually enjoyed this brew on tap in the past but it seems no one carries the draft anymore. At least, not in my area."
"Drinkability- Not a horrible beer. This would be a nice beer to drink after having done strenuos work of some type such as mowing the lawn. They do a good job marketing this beer to a young, hip crowd similar to Pabst."
"Miller High Life is normally my drink of choice when thirst quenching without pondering is at hand. I prefer this over light beers but it should not be confused with a beverage brewed with more gastronomic and esoteric qualities in mind."
"If this is the champagne of beers, it's that cheap champagne found at university student's new years party. Pours yellow, with a thin film for head. Smells of grain, corn, and a bit of grass. Tastes plain. Somewhat sweet and malty. Very astringent. Personally, I found it undrinkable. Not that it was that bad, but it gave me terrible gas afterwards."
"At $16 bucks for a 30 pack it is a good bet for a night of watching some games and havin a few domestic brews."
"Could drink that many of these, but a fair amount"
"Drinkability: You COULD drink plenty of these...but I prefer to have one in between my more expensive beers to keep a nice buzz going"
"Poured from the can into a pint glass. Standard macro golden yellow. Maybe slightly darker. Standard macro smell. Corn, rice, and so on. Slight metallic smell. But it has a simple and refreshing taste. No bitterness, skunkyness, or otherwise lousy tastes are present. Nicely carbonated. It's cheap and all but it goes down great. I could drink about a million of these while mowing the lawn or BBQing."
"Quaffable."
"I have to say, this may be my new go-to beer. I had a favorite but this one may be my new one. Clean tasting with a dry and crisp finish. I think a 12pack will be in my refrigerator in the very near future."
"That said, if you're in a pinch, High Life is a decent lawnmower/party beer, and at 5 per cent gives a little more bang for the buck."
"Vito says, ""Try a Miller High Life. You might dig it!"""
"Drinkability: While it's not one of the worst fluids that mankind has ever developed or encountered, it's still swill. Swell swill, sure, but still swill."
"Overall I would not recommend this beer. If it is the only choice, then it is definitely drinkable, but don't go actively seek out this one."
"Pours a light straw color, totally clear, with a short-lived one-finger head, leaving little lacing on the glass. Aroma is of corn, with a very slight grassyness. Tastes just like it should - dissapointing. Flavor is of corn, with very little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel: Astringent, and the high carbonation makes my tongue feel tingly. This beer is a little too thick and oily for my palate; although I think it is appropriate for this style. Overall, I prefer this beer out of the bottle more so than in a glass. I like to think that this is just flavored alcohol water, not a classy brew to sip and enjoy. As I always say, ""There's a time and place for every beer," and this one is perfect for beachside session drinking and not much else."
""
"It's no PBR, Schlitz, or Shaefer, but not bad for one of the big three..."
"GO REDSKINS!!!"
"I asked my friends to pick me up some Miller Lites for a get together, and instead they ended up getting me a 40 oz. of Miller High Life. No, they are not good friends. Drank straight from the large bottle, and tasted stronger and hoppier than its Miller Lite counterpart. Hints of corn, but mostly bitter hops and a non-existent attempt to mask the alcohol. Pretty heavily carbonated and filling. Crisp and dry mouthfeel, but hard to get by the carbonation, as it'll slow you down considerably. Overall, I see no reason for High Life when Lite is a ""healthier"" and lighter alternative that'll do the trick, unless you're strapped for cash, in which case: cheers to anything!"
"Pours a light yellow color with some head that wears off. Aroma is very corny and sweet. Taste is somewhat bland though. Very light taste of corn adjunct. Really nothing like the label says (not really a surprise there). I'll even venture as far as to say that I prefer Miller Lite to this."
"What can I say about this beer that has not already been said?This is the brew I buy when I need a lot of beer for a big party,cheap, easy to get,and nobody complains.It is the only American Macro I can stomach,for the most part,and it gives my neither a headache,nor the trots,like most of the rest do.All in all it is an average beer,good for parties,but not what you want to drink if you are having a small group of friends over for a nice dinner."
"Pours light gold with tiny bubbles. Smell is orange peel and corn notes and what is that?!?!....HOPS! You can really get the Orange peel though. Head is .5"" and it retains fairly well. After a while we've got a little lacing...looks decent. Taste can seriously vary depending on the temperature of this one. When cold, this beer takes on a hoppy/lt.hellas characteristic..a little tart/citrusy...it goes down easy and it satifies. Decent flavor for a macro. Great with salty foods. Over carbonated and has the tendency to get very adjunct prominant and bitter/sour as it warms. Under 45 it's sweet,citrusy, hoppy, pleasant and drinkable....over 50 it's unbearable. Considering its' company and the fact that it's 7bucks a 12pk ..make this a solid choice...especially since it comes with the Miller 'hangover free' guarantee:)....My 'cheap' stocked brew...FOr Macro,.. I'd rather have a red stripe or a grolsch...but for half the price....this is a good deal!"
"D: Not a horrible beer, pretty good for a macro, just too light for my tastes. It has a pretty good drinkability, though the quart bottle got boring after a while."
"Pours a clear straw yellow, thin white head forms, settles down quick to a thin ring around the glass, the disappears completely, no lacing. Smell is sweet and corny, honey, citrus, bit of floral, pretty average. Taste is similar, sweet corn, adjuncty, wheat like dry middle, floral and citrus sweet sugar finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Was holding on to this gem for my #900 review, but I forgot!"
"Not a bad beer overall. Great to wash down anything from a grill on a hot day. A decent standout against to many lesser choices in style. Not my first choice, but a good go to macro."
"Pours a clear light straw color with a dense white head that dissipated into a nice cap and left some real nice chunk lacing. The smell is faint, corn, grain, metallic, protypcial macro stank. The taste is of corn, grain, but has a slight apple tartness that cuts the artifical sweetness. The feel is light, watery and dry. Probably the most dry macro I have tried. Perhaps that is why this is the champagne of beers. One of the better macros out there and cheapest, can't beat $12 for a 30 pack."
""
"For the price this beer can't be beat, I've never bothered pouring it out of the can as its main purpose is to mostly get wasted or enjoy a really cold beer at the BBQ or while mowing the lawn. Smells like corn, tastes like a sweet beer champange, hence the name. mothfeel is pretty much full of carbonation but not like a soda. Drinkablility is amazing. the only other kind of beer i can drink like this might be newcastle, but that's expensive at 15 bucks a 12 pack where i can buy a dirty 30 of the high life for 11+tax/dep. This beer will always have a place in my heart, for being dirt cheap and amazingly drinkable. I can put down almost half a 30 at parties and its great with chinese food and bbq food. Can't go wrong with living the high life, just wish i could find this in 40s."
"There is not a lot to say about this beer that is good, not for me anyway. The beer is a nice light gold colour that is reminiscent of American lagers. There is no discernable smell to speak of nor is there any discernable taste. The mouthfeel is very watery with hints of carbonation. Overall this is not a beer that I would try again, nor is it a beer that I would recommend to others."
"I've been drinking High Life for many years, and even when I say I'm not gonna drink it for awhile....I always go back to it. I guess it's my ""go-to"" beer that's affordable, drinkable, and respectable. It IS, to me, an American classic that should stay around forever. Here's to American lagers...here's to our old men (and women, I guess!) and grandpaps. And here's to the High Life. Cheers my friends!"
"I'd take this brew over MGD but that is about it, pretty easy to drink and nice and cheap, a good college brew."
"this beer would be <B>immensely</B> improved by a late addition of saaz or some other spicy noble variety (tettnang, hallertauer)."
"All I can say is it's somewhat refreshing and it goes down easy. Just try not to smell or taste it while doing so."
"I guess it's good for the style. The flavor is a crisp mix of pale malts and corn adjunct. No hops really, just a clean beer without any nasty off-flavors. One of the better macros, if that counts for anything. Just stick to PBR if you're going cheap."
"Drinkability is outstanding, Budweiser is full of shit, this is the king of beers."
"This being my first review I wanted to go with a beer I know and respect. Overall High Life may be called the ""champagne"" of beers, but is more like a sparkling white wine, not excatly from the Champagne region of France if you know what I mean!"
"man, i used to love how this beer looked in the clear bottle and loved the retro coolness. now i know they do some frankenstein shit on the hops so they don't skunk out, but whatever. have had this more times than i care to admit...$10 30-packs were a fridge staple after college. i used to keep a glass frozen for this beer, since it is almost devoid of flavor you might as well drink it super cold. there is flavor, however. that slightly sweet corn adjunct flavor and aroma i used to love. no hops or malt body to speak of. light, pale, and fizzy."
"Poured a little out into a glass to judge the appearance and aroma. Was not impressed. Clear straw color with lots of bubbles and a fast-receding head. Aroma is thin and malty. Do I smell corn, or rice, or both? Because I definitely do not smell any hops. Considering how many hop fields the guys at Miller have stationed all over the world, you'd think they could do something to make their beers actually smell like the darn things. The taste is bland, but crisp and clean. I have to confess that I like the High Life because it's very drinkable. But I must confess that I don't really classify it as beer so much as flavored water. And as far as flavored water goes, it's really not too bad. From the can, however, this flavored water is tinny and sharp. Not bad if you need to clean the peanut butter off the roof of your mouth, but I wouldn't pair it with a fine porterhouse steak or anything. Average drinkability, just because it does go down easily. As easy as any flavored water I've ever had."
"Another one of your run of the mill American lagers.Decent flavor with no bitter aftertaste.Satisfactory carbonation although the last two mouthfuls are pretty darn watery.My advice if your a little short on dough grab a six pack of this stuff,you could do worse."
"I'm going to skip the A/S/T/M/D, etc. here, as this is a High Life; the champagne of beers. Obviously it's a macrolager, pale straw, sticky, corn-taste. For some reason, this just happens to be one of my favorite cheap American macros - 6 bucks a 12 pack, very sweet - refreshing. Throw a lime in it (hah) and it's the poor man's corona. Great in a pinch or on a hot day for tailgating."
"Drinkability: Compared to its peers, this beer stands up for itself. Fairly balanced, refreshing and drinkable, lightly sweet and biscuity."
"This is for a taste test between Miller High Life and MGD (as per forum posts this same day). Beer poured from 24oz big can into large Okocim glass (0.5L, this glass is awesome by the way). Head formation was brilliant for a macro lager and sticks to the glass in large chunks. Puffy cloudy head remains after a few sips, this thing won't go away, reminds me of a slightly lesser head from a tripel. Beer a very pale gold with TONS of bubbles, it's so nice. The smell is not great, but the taste makes up for it. Very smooth and crisp, almost like biting into an apple. It is fairly sweet, but very refreshing. This definitely goes with everybody's idea of a great summer beer."
"D- I would pick MGD over miller high life but this isn't bad."
"(My scores for this beer are judging it compared to it's style, which got it a .5 bump. If compared to most microbrews, I would not judge this beer so high.)"
"Definitely not the champagne of beers. Carbonation a little too high for this beer, it overpowers any taste it might try to have. Aftertaste is bad but then again the true taste is nothing impressive. Decently smooth. The taste is distinct but not in the best way.. Of all the cheap beers this is one of the few distinct, with its foul aroma and bubbly taste."
"DON'T serve warmer than ice cold."
"it's typical for a macro, with the exception of taste, it's a classic and it's a half notch above average."
"overall this isnt too bad for a macro, i prefer it to mgd, ice cold its drinkable, not sessionable....and its cheap"
"From a 7 oz. bottle. Pours to a persistent but thin white head with bits of lace. Pale golden/straw color. Aroma is corny and sweet, with a bit of banana ester. Flavor is very weak, a bit too sweet. Finishes clean and sweetish. A good looking beer that is just ""drinkable""."
"Mouthfeel is light, somewhat watery but not exactly thin. The light body and lack of flavor make the High Life very easy to drink. Not a bad pick for an undemanding quencher but not worth seeking out over most other macros. Not that it's hard to find or anything."
"Overall: Pretty much average macro lager, meaning pretty much a below-average beer. I wouldnt have bothered other than for the sake of completeness."
"How can anyone hate this beer? Yes it's cheap, but honestly it tastes great for its price. For being a mass produced beer it is incredibly good. The color is dull and the smell is nothing impressive, but the taste is perfectly fine and the head is is quite massive. very carbonated. It is very drinkable and finishes fairly smooth. I would say this is the real beer drinker's cheap beer. When I don't have the cash to buy a case of Sierra Nevada, I'll go with a dirty 30 of high life. Tastes even better in the bottles. I will forever respect the Champagne of Beers. Cheers."
"D - It is still a descent american macro lager. It will do the job during Championship Week on ESPN."
"The good ole High Life. Havent had one in years, was at a friends and we opened a few one night. I forgot how mellow this beer is. Nothing at all stands out. The color is pale straw with plenty of carbonation to create a nice white head. Smell was very plain with a hint of grass even a little yeast. Taste is very light not much to detect other than a hint of grain like flavor. No aftertaste at all. Very fizz like from the carbonation. For a mass produced beer this is in my opinion one of the better ones."
"about as middle-of-the-road as it gets. grainy yellow hue, grainy smell, grainy flavor with hints of sweetness from corn, grainy mouthfeel. not that any of that graininess is a bad thing. it's actually kind of interesting, and despite the uber-mass production involved, it tastes pretty natural. very drinkable, with my only complaint being that i would prefer a bit more hops to make the finish a bit more refreshing. probably the best of the gigantic-batch american macro lagers."
"To be fair, beer was purchased on clearance with age being questionable. Intend to review again at a later time."
"And I've got to say the picture with the empty forties is the icing on the cake."
"The most drinkable american macro imo. Used to down these like water at the bowling alley in my personal prohibition time. Cheap and available everywhere. A 4.5 for taste compared to beers of this style not compared to your favorite big beer."
"A pale yellow that a 2watt bulb could easily penetrate. A tall foam head displays its high carbonation level. Flavor? Like poorly-aged Corona. Pretty gross. Id suggest Bud Light or Pabst Blue Ribbon if youre looking for an inexpensive light beer."
"This pours a pale clear yellow with a medium white head. Very pale and watery looking,making this not very attractive. The smell is only a hint of vegatables,corn, and nothing else. It was so weak it's almost nonexistant. The taste is weak and watery with veggies,corn, and sweet malt. Really, their's not much to talk about. The m/f is light and the weak flavors mix OK. This is what it is. A beer that should be served ice cold to hide it's imperfections."
"Had this at a party, ice cold from the bottle, after several other beers. Nothing special here, just a typical BMC macro. Okay appearance, aroma and taste of grain, and an aftertaste that left soemething to be desired. However, in the absence of micros and good imports at the party, it fit the bill as well as any other BMC."
"D - I could guzzle this stuff on a hot day. Excellent cheapo summer beer if you want to slake your thirst and are on a tight budget."
"Just another macro lager, nothing much to expect here. This actually was my favorite of the American Macro Lagers back when I first started with beers. Still seems sweeter than the others AMLs."
"Overrall, this beer is much better the second time around."
"another beer from my younger days. we used to go to a bar in ny state for steamers 3.95 a doz. that was a saturday ritual along with miller beer. pours light yellow color with a one to two finger head with some lacing. smell, slight corn, veggie. taste same. mouthfeel light crisp lots of carbonation. very drinkable best served nice and cold."
"D: Great American macro, my favorite AM. Easy to drink and not totally bland."
"Light yellow translucent body with about a finger of head. Smells somewhat malty with some yeast. Tastes somewhat sweet, corny, with some yeast... Very light body, somewhat watery, and finishes pretty much completely clean. There's some off flavor to it, though I can't really put my finger on it. Not impressed, but not dissappointed either."
"This pours a very pale, fizzy straw color with a large head and great retention. Most noted for the light and frothy head. As far as the smell-- there's nothing there, a bit of malts here, some grains there, nothing exciting. A solid taste that repeats the smell with a bit more robustness. Clean and smooth. The mouthfeel is well balanced but lacks in complexity. Drinkable, easy to finish the old-school 40 oz. I've had better, I've had worse."
"not bad. but definitly not great. you really have to judge this in regards to it's style. for what it is, it ranks somewhere behind schlitz for me. poured out of a 24 oz.can. tons of bubbles, straw yellow color. smells really clean to the nose. not offensive. goes down smooth as long as it stays cold. once warmth hits, it's every man for himself. decent enough and for $.99 for a 24 oz. can, makes it a highly drinkable brew when you are faced with only the change in your car drink holder."
"Drink-Ability: For a wildly popular beer that you can get anywhere it is not that bad. Great cold on a Sunday afternoon watching football."
"I could drink this untill I get tired of drinking tastless beer.A great beer in a cooler full of ice on a 90 degree day,other than a very uninteresting beer to say the least."
"In the age of only reviewing good beers, it's still important to let the public know that beers like Miller High Life have no other redeeming qualities than to get people drunk. Offered to me by an ol' college buddy @ a Notre Dame tailgate. Water & corn adjuncts, mmm boy."
"One of my top 3 Lager macro's behind PBR and Schlitz."
"Not very good in my opinion you need to keep it cold to enjoy it. Good luck."
"Now, don't get me wrong, but this sucker has a pronounced corny taste that I can actually respect. It is sweet and corny, but in a way I can identify as actual corn - not the barnyard leavings of some beaked bird. It has a touch of the bad breath I find on my burly bearded buddy when I visit him in the cab of his pickup truck (he was living there for a few months). When I am angry at the world of ""better beer"" and my wallet is in turn, angry at me, I will reach for a forty of this wicked foulness is a way that keeps me giggling and cackling inside, The aroma, flavor, and finish is all sweet corn - maybe I should scarf on some tamales and wash it down with this one!"
"A very carbonated beer. Makes sense i guess, cause it is the champagne of beers. I love drinking this beer inbetween the times i get some of the better beers. i can't always afford the better beers. Overal this is a beer i like to drink, kind of like someone else would drink a soda or something."
"Typical macro taste and smell here. Lots of adjunct in the nose, but also some hop action. Lots of carbonation bubbles. Almost respectable head. Taste is mild and mouthfeel is pure seltzer. Aftertaste is fairly terrible, gritty and burning in the throat. You could do worse with macro, and it is cheap, but I'll move up at least to Yeungling next time and let the Mets' bats do the work.."
"Just to bad I can never find this on tap anywhere. To be honest, I'm not really sure if they even keg this stuff. They really should though."
"D- Good for washing down a burger or acting like an idiot showing up to a party with two 30-racks of it. It isn't really the champagne of beers IMO, but if you want to live your trashy side for a night, cheers to ya."
"Miller High Life was a very clear pale golden color with a white head. The head had fairly decent retention, leaving a little lace behind. The smell was grainy. The taste was lightly malty with a lightly bitter, dry finish. It is a crisp, light bodied lager with medium-high carbonation. This is a good beer if you are on a tight budget, the taste is acceptable, it's cheaper than dirt, and besides, it is the ""champagne of beers""."
"I do like this one, especially out of the can. Its really a no-brainer; the less you think about this one, the better it tastes."
"Miller High Life is crisp and bubbly; hence the nickname as the champagne of beers. But dont get carried away with this name- High Life is pretty ordinary and bland overall. It is very inexpensive and this alone will continue to result in steady sales year after year. But the taste is very plain and unexciting- the type of beer you reach for when you need some crisp refreshment but dont want anything full- bodied."
"Pours a clear golden straw color. Fair head retention. Aroma of cooked sweet corn. Somewhat sweet, with some corn flavor. A bit more flavor than other macros. Restrained hop bitterness, however it does not become cloying. Light body, with a lot of carbonation. This may be a small step above the usual suspects."
"for the price ,the classic bottle, and $15 a thirty pack at wal mart you cant go wrong.this is the champagne of beers. american macros anyway."
"Both this and PBR have enjoyed quite a resurgence on the local beer scene over the past few years. They've become more of a staple among the college kids which is o.k. as long as it's anything besides the putrid ooze that is Bud Light. The key points of MHL are that it maintains a sweetness of flavor that is not overpowered by any finishing bitterness. The main flavors are corn and mild grain with little to no hops. If all you have at your disposal is domestic macros MHL or PBR are the ways to go."
"Overall not the worst macro lagers out there but not the best...if there even is a best macro lager."
"A cool old dude comes in the beer store everyday; recently retired, chaw drippin from his lower lip. Before he retired, every weekday, Boss, would buy a deuce-deuce of the High Life for the road. Eventually, he retired, and I would see him only on two or three random days a week, when he would do menial manual chores. Then he started coming in almost every day, so I asked him why hes working so much if hes retired. He said ""Oh, you know, gotta stay busy"" I just realized today that his only thrill in life left is unapologetically drinking a brew while driving home after work. Also, hes an old man, he can get away with anything. He probably has a garage full of plates in case he gets caught. That is how I will live my last quarter century."
"¡Salud!"
"I can still see myself buying a 12-pack of these on a game day if I had some friends over, but I wouldn't drink one of these for the flavor."
"Hittin' the low life. Miller High life is a confusing beer to me. It isn't stale and doesn't taste like it was sitting in a wherehouse for a year like MGD, but has the very corny taste of a Miller Lite. Confusing brewery. Anyways, nothing is yellowier in appearance, nothing! Although the bottle is classic, which is what you want to drink this out of. The smell is of very faint corn making it hardly offensive, but not impressive nonetheless. The taste is actually damn good considering its price for a 12 pack and its availability. Better than most other swill in the same category sans PBR. The moutfeel is watery like a Mexican beer, but has a stickiness to it that makes it seem heavy. The drinkability is the absolute high point of this beer. Very refreshing and you can down these like water, which is exactly what they are good for...about as average as average can get."
"My dad mentioned to me that when mated with a lime slice, this is the poor man's corona. Ice cold, with a lime, this is now my favorite cheap beer! While high life has a bit more corn taste than corona, close enough for most at half the price. Color is pretty light. Doesn't have any outstanding smell, but you can tell it's beer. Taste is pretty simple, little malty, no hops to speak of, but refreshing none the less. Feels fairly carbonated compared to what I have otherwise been drinking lately, hence the champagne of beers, I suppose. Extremely drinkable, and at six for the price of one micro lately, you cant go wrong if you're strapped for cash."
"I will always grab a Miller HIGH LIFE when they are around - One condition - They must be very cold"
"I'll be buying somemore, Cheers!"
"This is a very smooth beer. Its smoothness comes more from the taste and the feel rather than the water, as is the case with most American macros. It has a decent taste that holds on for awhile, making this much better than most others of its style. In fact, this is a better summer thirst quencher than most craft summer brews I've had. And, it is very inexpensive. Considering the price and style, this is not bad at all - a good one to bring a six-pack of when going to the pool or the beach."
"D: It’s a macro, so it’s definitely “poundable” and as I’ve found with most Miller products, it has a bit more flavor than you get from Bud or Coors. This is definitely one of the better cheaper out there."
"This is probably the best of the major American Macro lagers. Fairly decent golden appearance. Mild head. Sweet smell. Smooth taste with slightly malty aftertaste. Crisp, clean, and cheap it does what it was intended to. With this beer you get what you pay for not much more."
"Many fun nights with this beer in college and beyond. =]"
"What does one look for when drinking an american macro lager? He wants a smooth beer with some flavor, not too much (he wants it smooth and easy to drink a lot of). He wants a nice sweet smell as well. As far as american macro lagers, this takes the cake. Has nice flavor, and doesn't have that akward dryness that mgd has. Much better than MGD, miller needs to make this their main beer."
"I really can't complain. This has been the mainstay beer of my adolescence life, and you know what it has done the job. It gets you drunk and for $11.99 a twenty-four pack it isn't all that bad. I definitely prefer the Pabst breweries much better. I've had much better times with Rainier, Schlitz, Hamm's, and Stroh's but Miller High Life has always been a standard brew that is easily abtainable anywhere in the country. As I've matured in my years I've tried to avoid high life more and more but whenever you are pinchin' pennies high life always tries to find it's way back into your fridge. In my opinion this is the best universally available cheap domestic lager in the great patriotic nation of America. It's the Champagne of Beers!"
"D: A good lawn mower lager. Probably one of the better of the macros. I would say its my bad beer go to. Easy drinking. How can you turn down the champagne of beers? Avoid, unless the woman on the moon is handing you one..."
"One of it's biggest flaws is a long lasting dry aftertaste. Not really a beer to savor, more of a beer to chug down."
"It is the king of Miller, which doesnt say much."
"I physically cannot drink cheap macro beers anymore. Whenever I do, I get an upset stomach."
"Theres not much to say that hasn't already been said. The pour is golden. The white head starts out frothy, then fades, but never disappears. There is some corn in the nose, along with grain. The taste is crisp with grain and light hops. No noticeable corn flavors. At $4.99 a case, this stuff is just about the only macro worth buying."
"Perhaps not the champagne of beers, but certainly one of the best of the style. I think this tops PBR."
"D- yeah, you'll forget you are drinking beer"
"D - high, easy to pound"
"In sum, theres definitely a reason this aged recipe has endured the test of time; some competitors have more action in the upper register, but this one is hard to beat for a good fat midrange. Its very useful as a yardstick for tasting comparisons too. Solid, reliable, enjoyable and a good value, the High Life deserves its return to the limelight."
"Light to light-medium body, highly overcarbonated for the level of heaviness. Finish is clean and dry, at least this is quite refreshing. Drinkability of this beer really depends on the context: it's drinkable if one is at a social event and this is the only thing available; there's also an apparent attraction to having something this clean and dry in the finish on a warm day. If one is enjoying beer where there is selection, however, there's absolutely no reason to purchase or drink this."
"this is the BEST beer for casual drinking. forget amstel, this is the beer drinkers light beer. it must be consumed in bottles for one to fully aprichiate the goodness of the high life. I strongly encorage real beer drinkers to give high life a chance. it might not look classy, but it drinks like champange"
"If I'm going to buy a cheap beer at a bar, this is probably what I'm going to get. It goes down nicely and doesn't get revolting if the temperature drops a little. Miller High Life is also great on a hot day. For what it is, it is very satisfying. Don't drink this with a lime, it doesn't need one."
"Found one in the fridge downstairs, drank about half of it for this rating."
"I had this brew at a neighbors house, during a get-together. I know that Ive had it before, but I really dont recall when or how long ago. Its an extremely light, clear, unassuming straw color. Fizzy white head. No real aroma at all. I couldnt pick out any hops, and maybe just a hint of grain. Very faint sweetness at the tip of the tongue, but other than that, the flavor is absolutely lifeless. Watery finish, if you could call it that. Theres really not much to say herethe beer has no flavor and no character. Call it yellow fizz water: that about sums it up."
"Only enjoyable ice cold, outside, on a hot day in my opinion."
"I've lived the High Life many times. It's not terrible but it's not that great. It must be ice cold. It's a little more flavorful than Miller Lite, which is why I choose it often."
"Musings: I'll have my corn on the cob thank you. Leave it on the shelf and go for the Schlitz or PBR."
"Poured from the golden can into an american pint glass. Lots of white foam appear upon pouring. Lacing throughout the entire beer. Piss yellow color. I can't pick out the smell of hops or malt, both are probably hidden by the plethora of adjuncts in this beer. Taste is minimal. Very light bodied, but this gives it a thirst quenching appeal. These are good on a hot day when you need an ice cold drink to cool off. Clean in the mouth but alittle sticky on the lips. Drinkability is this beers claim to fame. It's not hard to drink a 12pack of these things in a night. Not filling, not a high abv, just drinkable beer. Thats all this beer is, drinkable."
"... I'm not going to comment on the ""Champagne of Beers"" assertion."
"Ok this is a nice cheap beer. Once again this beer isn't meant to be savored. It's pretty sweet and i'd agree has a bit of a corn undertone. Pours a decent head that holds well. But this beer goes down easy and is easy on the pockets as well. I end up having this every once in awhile."
"UPDATE: I have, in recent weeks, made a conscious effort to keep my fridge stocked with bottled High Life at all times. I have always enjoyed HL, but now I seem to have decided that it will be my default beer for when I'd rather be refreshed than worry about having to pay attention to flavor or make any sort of investment to that effect. Indeed, there are many nights when I come home from work late and I'd be just as happy to have two or three HLs while mindlessly watching TV as I would with a high-quality specialty brew that I can sip and enjoy for a while. I will note, also, that as a rule I only drink HL out of the bottle. Unlike any other beer I drink, I see no point in pouring HL into a glass, as I will not find much beauty in its appearance, nor do I feel compelled to open up its nose, as I will not be put in awe by its bouquet. No, give me cold HL in the bottle (where it'll stay colder longer, by the way), and I'm all right."
"Drinkability... not good. Although the price is right, if you want a cheap buzz. I'd prefer Steel Reserve, personally."
"Have a snooty opinion on my rating, if you want, but, as far as style goes, this is a great beer."
"mouthfeel and drinkability: nice light mouthfeel, mixed with a fantastic drinkability. not a bad beer by any means, if it only had a touch more bitterness it would be even better. and yeah the price is right at 9.99 a 24 pack."
"this, in my opinion, is easily the best of the 'megabrewery' american offerings. you can tell its 'one of those' beers but its really not all that bad. like the others, it looks like urine, smells almost like urine, but it doesnt taste like urine...it definitely has a 'champagne' taste to it, i can't argue with their motto lol. to me its extremely similar to Duvel, but i dare say, to me it is better. perfect for buying cans in bulk and drinking a the beach or the lake."
"First, there is a daring hops presence that can't be found in any other mass-market beers. Not bad, actually. It also isn't soda-sweet like Bud or Miller. It's actually trying to taste like something interesting. Almost floral. While I don't care for the slummy ""champagne of beers"" marketing, this is my choice if I'm forced to make a gas station beer run or if I'm going camping with friends. Let's give it credit for what it is: a cheap, readily available beer that is a definite step up from Bud Light and friends. Sometimes, and I know this is strange, I just don't want to spend a lot of money."
"Mouthfeel is carbonated and mellow...not too thin because of all the carbonation in it. The Cola of beers....a definate economy beer..but very drinkable...works with hot weather and hot dogs. Best served ice cold. Beats a lot of cheap beers by a long shot."
"Notes: Truly the champagne of beers. I have a love affair with this beer and would gladly accept one any day of the week. Not the highest quality macro lager I have tasted, but definitely my favorite. The price and the epithet (cham-pag-ne- a la Christopher Walken) make it just right for me. My preferred poker/beer pong/drinking game/cookout beer."
"This beer poured a very pale yellow color with a large head of foam. It was so pale that it was basically just a shade darker than water. The aroma was very uninviting. I could smell a mixture of rotting tomatoes and a kind of fruity aroma mixed with it. Surprisingly, the taste was not too bad. I could taste the ever present corn and adjuncts, but there was also a nutty aftertaste that was kind of pleasing. Honestly, I don't understand how anyone could put out a product like this and still make money. I'd take a Bud or PBR anyday over the ""Champagne of Beers"". Not recommended."
"Drinkability - Definetely drinkable. I'm surprised I haven't tried it until now, but I'm quite impressed. Nothing like its Lite counterpart and definetely worth the price. Recommended for a macro."
"This stuff is simple but pretty good. A 12 pack is a pretty good use of $7 and better than anything else in the price range except Yuengling and maybe PBR. When I'm going cheap and don't feel like Yuengling Traditional Lager and can't find PBR, this does the trick."
"Notes: If its on sale I'll pick up a sixer for a fishing trip or the likes. This is one of the finer macro's up there with Pabst Blue Ribbon but not quite."
"Well im not sure why this beer is so much worse in the can. When i buy a macro i usually get cans because they are lighter to return, but the can version of this just blows in comparision. This poured a gold color with an allright head. The aroma was of corn and harsh ass. The taste is similar has a slight sweet hint. Compared to the bottle though the taste is dirty and harsh. The mouthfeel is moderate, not stickey-creamy like the bottle. Kinda drinkable"
"Not a bad beer for a summer evening."
"....even for a macro brew this beer represents the average. I guess thats pretty much what they're going for though. Every once in awhile I have to pick up a sixer of HL just to remind myself of why I spend $10+ per bottle for the good stuff. It pretty much embodies the qualities of what people like my grandfather expected from their beer. Essentially something devoid of any immediate bitterness or ""flavor", yet something that provided a brief escape from the life that was 50's and 60's America. For this reason it still marches on, coursing through the veins of tail-gaters and lower-middle class ping pong players across the country...."
"There are no surpises here, I know what to expect. This is a hard beer to beat as far as price goes. I paid $3.99 for a 6 pack. It's your typical macro-adjunct lager all day long. Not a quality beer by any stretch of the imagination, but thirst quenching nevertheless."
"Purchased a six pack of clear bottles. This beer pours a pale yellow with a thick head. Clean tasting macro lager, this was my beer of choice when I was in college back in the eighties, it was cheap, drinkable and better than other cheap beers, such as Old Swillwaukee. Only problem was it was (and I'm sure still is) common to find a light struck bottle. Not bad for a macro when not light struck."
"Smell had corn, hops, and some sort of citrus. Taste followed the smell. Corn, hops some light fruit. Not much of a rich flavor and after taste was light. A crisp mouthfeel that gets better as the beer becomes colder. A good, light summer thirst quencher, and cheap."
"D - Drinkable I guess. Many moons ago I use to like this stuff."
"Pours a terrible pale yellow with no foam at all. Smell is very mild - some malt and sweet corn in there along with some floral hops. Taste is pretty much the same as the smell. A pleasant fresh floral hoppiness and very mild bitterness are there in small quantities along with the grain. The corn makes it a bit sickly tasting as it comes out more when the beer warms. Mouthfeel is pretty watery. Overall, I'd pick it over most of the other macro lagers, I guess."
"Look at this beer this way: It is simple, has been around for a long time, and is an industry standard. Yellow hue, with a decent head, smells like a cheap beer. Taste is actually very nice. It's just a beer taste. Nothing special here, but from Miller, this is probably their best offering. Mouthfeel and drinkability are incredibly wonderful being that it is so easy to drink. By far, this is the best macro you can get."
"Cheers!"
"This is a pretty terrible beer, though even after what 150 years, it still has its fans. I can understand why actually. The first time or two I tried it I thought it was pretty good. And the bottle is really cool besides. But the more I have drank this one, the less I like it. The color is a little darker than most in the American Macro category (at least those that are brewed in America). It's still definately yellow though. If you like High Life you'll probably call it yellow with a bit of depth. If you don't you'll probably describe it as sickly looking piss. I've had unbiased observers (that is people who've never had the brand and didn't recognize it either) ask me how I could drink something so gross looking. Smell is what I'd call average. It's actually on the sweet side, with hops that are a little funky, but at least noticably present. Taste is what kills this beer, and is where I've changed my mind. My views on the other aspects changed when I stopped appreciating the taste. At first, I thought it tasted pretty decent. It tends toward the sweet side, the adjunct of choice is obviously corn at least instead of rice, and the hops are only a little funky. The problem is that the more you drink this beer, the worse it gets. With each sip, the decent characteristics fade and the chemical bitter/nastiness comes the the fore. If you have more than two, not only does it become unbearable, but the taste will linger for hours after you finish it, even after you eat, or drink something else. The mouthfeel is about dead average, a bit fizzy but not bad otherwise. The drinkability sucks because of the way the nasty aftertaste slowly creeps in and takes over your mouth. Trust me, even from the bottle (and the canned version is supposd to be infinately worse) you would have to be absolutely out of your mind to drink more than 4 of these. The one time I drank 4, even brushing my teeth could't dent the lingering aftertaste. I used to think this was my go-to budget beer. Now I say avoid at all costs. Maybe not as bad as Bud, but who knows, if you drink a fifth High Life it might taste even worse than that. I for one don't want to find out."
"Straw colour with fluffy, rather dry looking head. Smells of a combination of cream, honey and an unfortunate hint of beer soaked bar towels. Tastes rather bland, but not obnoxious. It is rather sweet with a one dimensional bitterness and a rather dry finish. Seems a little stale. If it were less sweet and a little crisper it would be much better."
"Drink ice cold for maximum enjoyment, but mostly so those corn flavors stay where they should."
"Pours extra pale gold with a pristine clarity. Two finger head of dense soap bubbles; not much retention but the sticky lacing is impressive. Corn and cereal nose, with some pale malt hiding in the background. Distinctly adjunct flavor, but appropriatly light and balanced. Crisp and clean mouthfeel that leaves only whispers of adjunct in the aftertaste. Not bad for a macro, and you can't beat the price!"
"D- Easy to drink with mild flavors and a good wash of crispness. A tasty American Lager. Went excellent with the lamb and steak tips I grilled."
"Poured a pale amber color with massive white puffy head. Smell is moderately sweet and fairly pleasant. Taste is nice and refreshing. Leaves an enjoyable, but very light taste in the mouth. Somewhat creamy. Finish is also very mild and refreshing. This is a good cheap beer for a hot summer afternoon."
"I'm not going to say something dumb like this is one of the best beers I've ever had. It's not. However, it is a fine example of an American macrobrew. It's inoffensive, cheap, and highly quaffable; makes an excellent choice for a summer afternoon or evening in front of the television with a ballgame on. Hands down it's my choice for a refreshing lawnmower beer."
"The beer to get with buddies who refuse anything that it's straw yellow and dirt cheap. The obvious choice for the poor college student as well."
"Respect Wisconsin."
"This beer is probably the best of the american commercial beers, I like it a lot better than budweiser. This beer is average all the way down, I got the 16 oz cans of it, doesnt change taste too much as it warms, but seve it cold as possible. If i had to choose between bud/coors/miller category, I'd choose the high life. It's actually pretty cheap and not that bad a beer."
"overall, this beer really isn't that bad, at least it tastes like beer unlike several other macros or lights, it is something i would never turn down if offered at a party, also the price is very low. I drink this right out of the bottle as i don't see much point in pouring this one so it is a good choice at cookout or something when no glass is available. anyway, I am not ashamed to drink High Life."
"Miller had an example of good beer, miller high life in a 40oz bottle, a lager made without rice, malt, hops, corn starch, and flavorful water, its blonde color is because to its clear and dry malt; good with mexican cheese and american food, try with mexican antojitos too, serve in a glass mug previously cooled, with lime too; 92% recommended."
"A simple cheap beer."
"this stuff taste decent. A little sweet, however there's a sort of unpleasant background taste. The color is typical of any american macro, and so are the head stats. Sitting here writing this reveiw the morning after I only got a little bit hammered of this (*came home drank 2 bottles of water), my head throbs and beats with pain. I don't want to drink this again"
"Bottom line is, although theres no great unique taste, there's also no bad taste. It's just a cheap, easy to drink beer. I would drink this over a Bud anyday"
"This beer smells and looks of corn. This is not necassarily a bad thing as it is typical of American macro lager. Relative to its brothers Miller highlife is quite good actually. It has a straw yellow color and an easy swallow at a low price. That's about all you can reasonably expect from it and in my opinion it does this better that budweiser. The bottles are clear, so they offer little protection from light. I also noticed that it doesn't really leave you with much of a hangover, but I sobered up almost completely before I went to bed."
"I'll hopefully pick up a bottle of High Life soon for comparison, as I remember it being superior to the canned version."
"This is a solid beer and better than bud by leaps and bounds."
"This is not a bad beer, but due to some who must bash macros, it gets a bad rap. Poured out to a solid golden yellow color with a decent head that came down to about 1/8th of an inch. Odors of corn and malt were present. Taste was consistant with aroma. Very strong flavors of corn and malt, along with a syrupy sweetness that gives this brew a nice appeal. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, almost like liquid silk. Very nice. When you take the price into the equation, this brew is a no brainer. The best of any AB, Miller or Coors product. Good session beer. Recommended."
"The Champagne of beers is just a cheap macro afterall."
"Pours pale as it should. Nice head retention for a macro and a bit a lacing as well. Definite adjunct(corn sugar) taste but not too strong. Low bitterness and no aroma so hops are a bit lacking. Still for the price, not a bad ""cheap"" beer that goes down easily. I wish they'd add some saaz aroma hops..would make a big difference. Beats Bud if you ask me. No rice here."
"An aggressive pour releases 3 fingers of head over top of a clear light straw color. As far as things go, the head has a moderate retention and leaves nice lacing as it recedes. The nose is light, corn-sweet with a lack of hop character. Flavor is very clean, with a moderate corn sweetness, light graineyness and a lack of hop. Not bad at all. The feel is light to light moderate wtih a moderate carbonation. Overall, I've always found this to be a nice and refreshing beer. Not something I get often, but when I need something in this genre, this is where I turn."
"A very pleasant surprise here. An American Macro Lager that tastes decent and lacks the offnotes or total lack of redeeming qualities I've found in the other macros. Definitely, the class of the American Macro Lagers that I've tried."
"Wow! This beer pours a nice clear golden hue with almost perfect clarity. To bad the rest of the beer wasent as nice as its looks. I found the smell to be almost unexistent. The taste was not impressive and it was not smooth at all I could barely finish it. I remember drinking and hating it when I was 16 and my mind had not changed since on this beer."
"Skunked? Gosh, its not supposed to be, with its isomerized hops and all. Tried it from the bottle, tried it in a glass, both gave me a big mouthfeel of some plastic dissolved in it. Gotta say it loudly: THIS IS NOT BEER! Its the Champale, not the Champagne, of beers."
"I would gladly take a Miller High Life any day of the many offerings of the ""big 3."" Not the greatest beer you'll ever drink, but considering that it is one of the cheaper beers out there, the taste is definately worth the price. This one is probably my favorite ""cheap beer."""
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light pale malt and adjunct scent that is a bit dry and musty. It has a light hop aroma. The taste is average as well. It has a dry and grainy pale malt and adjunct flavor that goes down easy and finishes slightly sweet and musty. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent adjunct lager. I never really gave it much of a chance before and I'm sure I won't be giving it much of a chance in the future."
"High Life is a weird brew.. at times it tastes excelent, other times it holds a funky, husky, musty edge that I don't really enjoy. Still, for a cornfed Indiana boy like myself, it doesn't hurt a bit to quaff a bottle or six of this on hot summer day. I admit that the packaging appeals to me and might even influence my purchase - not its old-timey appeal, but rather just the shape of the bottles. But I digress. High Life is far from groundbreaking, but I've relied on it many times in lieu of ordering an MGD, BUD, or PBR even. (don't like it in the bottle.)"
"What kind of a beer drinker would be alured by the concept of his brew tasting like champagne? In short this terrible drink made me feel as if I was a kid who had snuck into his Dad's tool shed and slammed down a bottle of chemicals. If you aren't ashamed to walk out of a store with this one, then perhaps you should walk out with a case of ""Natural Light"" instead? 1,000,000 college kids can't be wrong! Take it easy boys and girls!"
"Probably the better lager of any of the 'Big Three'. In comparison to most of them, High Life is a little bolder golden and has better head retention. Better viscocity to the palate. Creamier and more flavorful. Flavors though, are of high corn sugar and decent malt. Still no hop play at all. Finishes as crisp, but with that corn-like aftertaste. Although its better than most of it's counter parts, its a far cry from the good Chezc Pils. Also makes a great free beer."
"Drinkability: The Champagne of Beers? That slogan is about as corny as the beer, so I guess it fits. But hey, as far as corny brews go, this is one of your better... or at least they dont try to hide the corny adjuncts. Initially, I thought I found another favorite warm-weather-camping/lawn-mowing beer, but no. Equal or better quality to the more expensive well-known AB, Miller, Coors brews, so taking price into account, Id take this over them, but there are better cheapos out there. I wasnt disappointed by this beer, but not really impressed either."
"Tasted: 05/25/05"
"Mountain Dew yellow in color. Surprisingly long lasting white head. Not much to smell. For taste, nothing really offensive to speak of, just very light cheerios grain taste and a pinch of hops at finish.. A good amout of carbonation. Overall nothing bad, nothing really good."
"Notes-You know, some people may want to just rip this apart needlessly, but it is a solid macro that can hit the spot on a hot summer day, and it's always great for an impromptu party beer. Cheap, readily available anywhere you go, and will always satisfy nearly everyone. For the macro lager that it is, few beers from the Big Three can beat the Champagne of Beers."
"Will order again, in quantity, when in Wisconsin."
"Drinkability: This is a great session beer for the warm weather. I am slightly impressed, to tell you the truth."
"Join the High Life Revolution Now!"
"Verdict- Why the hell is Miller Genuine Draft more popular than High Life? MGD is a grainy, acidic, unpleasant mess. High Life isn't anything special outside of the style, but it's smooth and fairly tasty."
"None of the 6er will be going down the sink, but this won't be replacing Genny Cream or Stroh's on the rare occasion I need to ""slum it""."
"Hey- I worked here 13 years and I'm not gonna rip these guys too bad!"
"The only reason to drink this beer is because you're low on cash, and the alternative is an AB product. Pale yellow, no head (unless you shake the can first), and only drinkable ice cold. ""Flavor"" greatly favors any other boring beer that you drank back in junior high. No hops. Really needs more hops. Mouthfeel = watery. It's drinkable only because it's cheap."
"Also it's not as good from cans as from bottles, for some odd reason. It's still pretty good, though."
"Haven't had High Life since high school, and I was surprised by the mediocre but not unpleasant taste. Better in the can for some reason."
"Not a very good beer here. It pours a golden yellow color and actually has a nice foamy head, but other than that, there's not too much to excite about. It smells like grains and bread and it tastes like pure bread. I guess there's a little grain and ass flavor in there too, but I really dont understand why it tastes and smells so much like bread. A lethal amount of yeast or something? I guess this one might be okay if you want to tip back 30 of 'em and get hammered all day, but dont count on it tasting very good."
"Update 5/09.. Had some High Life with dinner last night. Very clean compared to other macro brands and my old scores still stand."
"Four weeks left of my collegiate career, it's High Life time. (OK, I'm just trying to justify it's purchase). Poured a light straw yellow with a nice 2 finger white head into my Cia do Boi pilsener glass. Aroma was faint but what was detectable was mainly grainy with twinges of grass and a little bit of saaz-like spice around the edges. Taste was intially grainy but the grain flavors seem to fade after a couple of sips revealing a slight subtle spiciness that finishes clean. Smooth mouthfeel. OK macro lager I guess, but as long as Stroh's or PBR are in my area, I doubt I will ever taste this beer again."
"Before I expanded my beer horizons, this was one of my several beers of choice. I was a little worried to try it really considering its quality. Alas its legacy is, for me, forever tainted. Even among macrobrews there are better choices."
"Mouthfeel is pretty thin, but there's a nice steady carbonation that makes it feel a bit fuller. This is not something I'd pick up very often...but for a change of pace, as a hot summer lawnmower brew or if I'm out and there's not much selection...I'd choose a High Life over other macros."
"Pours a pale yellow with a creamy head. Clean, crisp aroma with a hint of toasted corn. Tastes exactly like it smells. Clean, crisp with that ever present corn taste found in so many beers in this price range. No bad for what it is, a decent American macro lager."
"Definitely meant for mass consumption, which isn't always bad. One of the more pleasant macro-brews. This and PBR are wicked good in a pinch. It's hard not to wish you were drinking something craft brewed, but when you think of the cash you saved buying a twelve of this for 6 bucks and the fact that it has some redeeming qualities, you'll soon forget about that bomber of Arrogant Bastard you're saving for Monday Night RAW. Great beer for the price, definitely better than Lite of MGD, and lightyears beyond anything Coors or Bud makes. That may not be saying much, but dammit, if you want a cheap beer that doesn't offend, this is the way to go."
"Drinkable, one of the best macros I've had."
"Overall impression: If you're going to drink macro, this ain't a bad way to go ... considering the style I think it is a pretty good example."
"And did I mention that its cheap?"
"Overall-still not a great beer, inoffensive and boring, better out of the bottle than the can but that doesn't say too much. Still not a beer that you should at all seek out and if your not into crap beer there are still many better American lagers."
"Had a bottle of this at Falt Top Johnnys this past Saturday night, in the company of David, Todd, Bochtech, and UncleJimbo, but the company and surroundings didn't make the beer any better. I poured the beer myself into a glass, and received liquid clear crystal gold for my trouble. No head to speak of and I did the pouring...that's not good. Aroma was of that sweet adjunctly style that is not appealing. But I didn't stop there, dove in, and encountered a medium bodied brew with very prickly carbonation. Tastewise, I thought it was mostly sweet malt with some citrusy notes in the finish. No, I will not get this again, and if I need 'the champagne of beers' I will continue my search for pink, green or gold Champale."
"Pours a piss yellow with no head. Smells of hardly anything, hints of grain and bread. Tastes bad, but honestly the best Miller offering. Tastes like 2 year old cereal. But not as bad as most macros. Had this at a party, and I won't have it again. I like how every review of this beer has to have an explanation as to why they had it. Anways, avoid this."
"Wow. It poured a nice gold with a surprisingly thick head that left lotsa lacing.But... tis true looks can be deceiving.The aroma was non existent,the flavor followed suit, very ,very bland and totallly lacking any discernable character.My father-in-law drinks this ,that's where I got the bottle to review,Thanks Pop,but no thanks."
"Drinkability: Should be high, but I struggled to put 2 down. For some reason I have never really liked Miller products, even though I don't think they are that drastically different than the other macros in content."
"If you're looking for the bargain beer, go for Pabst Blue Ribbon instead."
"I'm sure I'll end up buying this halfassed swill again, not very often though - just when it's time for a laugh and a good 'ol macrobrew."
"Pours like piss, smells like macro beer. Tastes like alcohol and some malt, isn't too skunky which is good for chucking a few ounces here and there when you're losing beer pong. We almost won! Overall, this beer isn't that great :)."
"The champagne of beers. I guess it's all relative. You do get what you pay for. A $4 6-pack ain't too bad. It tastes like malt-liquor but who can resist those sexy bottles. You've got to admire their arrogance in marketing. Words like ""champagne"" and ""high life"" aren't words I'd use to describe it."
"This is my uncles beer. As long as I can remember, the guy has always had a cooler or fridge full of Miller High Life. Oddly enough, Its taken me years to actually get around and try it for myself. And really, it seems that if I werent a beer geek and didnt mind the taste of beer, I probably would have been a Miller man myself. Theres an extremely boring, cereal-like flavor, no aroma and no bitterness. What makes this better than the much-hated-by-me Budweiser is that it lacks that nasty flavor in the back that Budweiser has. This just doesnt have much of anything."
"I'm not to impressed with it very little flavor at all. One i'd say avoid."
"This is a nice beer. Macros are in a class by themselves, they're not great but some can be good. This beer is one of the good ones. Better than any other macro I have tasted."
"12oz. can poured into a pint glass. It pours a light gold color with three fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing on the glass. The smell isn't too strong, but there's a little bit of grassy and malty aromas. The taste is smooth and malty, not much of an adjuncty flavor. A touchy of grassy hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is a little light and watery, not too bad for a macro. The drinkability is darn good though. Really the king of macros."
"The beer after is release from the 12-ounce clear bottle sets in the glass a transparent gold with a modest bright white heat that is creamy in texture and after its desiccation leaves a thin sheet of lace to conceal the glass. Nose is malt, sweet and clean with the start lightly malted and somewhat sweet, top cadaverous. Finish is mild in acidity, the hops meek and mild, dry aftertaste."
"At $5.99 for a 12 pack of bottles, the drinkability speaks for itself. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go grab another Champagne..."
"This is Miller's highest rated beer and it deserves to be. While it doesn't hold a candle to most of the other beers I like to drink, it's not bad. Cool and refreshing with very little taste, the beer pours a light platinum with some head and lacing but the head is quick to retreat. Flavor of perhaps lemon, but little else. Not as much character as the best industrial lagers of Europe, and little hop or barley flavors, but a crisp clean taste with none of the off-flavors that creep into American macros - cooked veggies, stale or skunky hops, etc. To be drunk ice cold from the bottle, or out of a very small glass (not a pint glass) -- at very quick speeds. I like the bottle design - retro? The girl on the moon is a nice touch, and the shape of the bottle itself is satisfying to hold (I can't fathom why, it just is). I've bumped up the appearance score accordingly. One of the only US macros I plan to buy again, if only for the dubious reason that there's nothing offensively bad about it. I'll stay away from the big bottles though; any unneccesary exposure to air or room temperature won't do this fragile beer any favors."
"Head never went away on this beer. just an average beer overall, nothing wonderfull, but nothing dispicable. smooth with a distinct flavor, nothing special, more than bud light but not sam adams, or killians. i have no idia why but the taste isnt bad to me."
"Easily the best adjunct lager I've ever had. Thats right folks, this beer has a flavor! Sure, its not much of a flavor. But its certainly a flavor. Yeah, its your typical macro taste with a little something extra. The guys over at miller must have splurged on the rice when formulating this recipe. A welcome suprise for sure. When the can hit my lips I was expecting another tasteless beer, but I got flavor. Not much, but more than normal."
"the champage o' beers was in a clear bottle with a pull date of sept.13. pours a medium brilliant gold with a nice head that actually laid down some webs as i consumed it. smell is grainy with a hint of citrus and corn in the back. taste is better than i had remembered, pretty damn tasty and, sinfully easy to drink mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. session beer? hell yes. we went through cases of this swill over the weekend of my tenth class reunion. not a complaint to be heard in the house."
"Now that I'm in a place that has Genesee Red again and I've re-discovered how good a cold Pabst or how good a Ballantine could be...this cheap beer is off my list."
"Pale golden in color, with a decent head that doesn't hang around long. Smell of corn and grain, along with a hint of a metallic aroma. Metalic taste to it, as well. I was hoping this was from the fact that it was in a can, but I've seen the same taste noted on reviews from bottles. Corn appears in the taste, too, and a strong hop presence, without much flavor to really back it up. Crisp and fairly clean in the mouth, though. Not a horrible brew, but not on my list for frequent purchasing."
"Sure this ranks among the macros, but for my money, I cant say that it gets much better than the High Life. Its perfect for so many things, both because it actually has taste to it, and because it doesnt hijack your offshore bank account. Pours a light golden with a decent head which actually retains a layer of foam throughout the drink. THe smell is a mild sweet malt smell, with no hops really. The taste is light on the front, but the aftertaste is pleasantly wheaty and malty. The mouthfeel is a bit watery, but I cant say I mind that too much. This beer is the ultimate versitility. You can sip it and feel sophistocated one minute, and take it to the garage and have a nice round of cups the next minue, and not think twice about it."
"Appearence in the bottle is not bad to look at, although the clear glass probably isn't the best choice for a beer. However, it is nice to be able to see the color in my opinion. Pours a watery yellow. Fizzy soda pop like head that comes and goes in an instant. Has a slightly skunky smell to it, but not terrible. Taste was grainy and a little tangy, but i did enjoy it. A watery beer but a decent one that's easy to drink. Drinkability, availability, and price really do it for this one"
"A serviceable macro lager that had its place in my fridge a fair share in the past, not bad for a filler I guess. At least they use mutant radioactively treated hops or whatever so it doesnt skunk in the clear bottle."
"I was a little surpised by this beer. Wasn't all too bad I have to admit. Poured out a pale yellow with a somewhat decent head on it. Smell was a little too clean, just some grainy aromas in there, not much to talk about. Taste was somewhat respectable though. A little bit of hops show up along with some sweetness and bitterness, but there's just a little too much sweetness to my liking. Considering it's made by one of the big three, and that there's some actual beer elements (hopefully) in there, it's somewhat average compared to other beers. Having a BBQ soon and don't have that much cash? This is the way to go then."
"For what it is, it is the best of the macro lagers. Though its quite disrespectful to more artisanal beers, the ""Champagne"" is motto is right, if not funny, relatively speaking. Not just because of my Old Man, this is quite the Old Man beer - and it actually is good beer, too."
"Miller High Life is definently better than I remember most of the other Miller brands being (It beats Miller Lite any day). Still, High Life is only a slightly better than average micro. It is the type of beer than is sweet for its price range and good in a cold mug on a hot day, but its not a beer I'll be clamoring for again. I would recommend this beer for friends as a means of taking baby steps away from Coors and Miller Lite or as a cheap session beer."
"Pours a pale straw color with minimal head and a fair amount of carbonation. Aroma is sort of sour corn grist. It pretty much tastes the same. It has a roasted corn flavor that finishes sour. MGD is a bit better. Seems like there is a bit less corn and not as sour and gristy."
"Still pours the standard light yellow with minimul head, suprisingly the smell a little more funky out of the bottle, smell hints of earth tones with a strong smell of grain and grilled corn. Taste is a bit bitter, hops and a strong sour grain taste. Cool and refreshing but suprisingly didn't like as much as canned."
"Great foreign beer."
"This lager is not bad for what it is...an inexpensive beer. This beer tastes better out of a cold long-necked bottle after mowing the lawn, rather than when poured into a pint glass to be savoured. The beer is light-clear-golden. When poured there is a moderate head for a short period. The smell is odd-is that corn? Taste is not at all remarkable, other than some what corny. This lager is ok for a cheap refreshment straight out of the bottle when working in the yard. But is not something I would buy to sit back and enjoy. I recommend par-boiling ribs in this stuff."
"ng"
"The mouthfeel was super watery but all in all a quite drinkable ""shit"" beer. I would never go so far as to buy any of this, but if people are offering them ice cold and its hot outside i'll partake."
"I don't know what it is about Virginia, but High Life is the unofficial brew of our titty bars. Unless you want to drop $3.50 for a longneck of Bud/Bud Light, it's pitchers of High Life for you and the guys. It tastes like a pretty standard Macro out of a tap, although it does have a little more personality than the Buds and Coors of the world. It's cheap and it gets the job done, no more no less. And when your shoving dollars down Bambi's g-string, I can't think of a beer I'de rather have by my side than the High Life."
"Far from being a crafted beer, but served cold, it is a very refreshing beverage for me. A real thirst quencher."
"This beer is still drinkable, but not one I'd seek out for a cheap session anymore as I recently found PBR to be better. It is one of the cheaper, decent macros that I can easily find in a bottle (albeit a clear one) though."
"""The champagne of beers"" I guess by champagne, they mean Freixenet. This is my favorite dirt cheap American lager. $4.50 for 6, can't beat that."
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this beer yet. This is my cheap shit beer to drink when I either have NO money or don't feel like thinking when I'm drinking (if that makes sense). Pours a golden color with a medium sized white head, bubbles racing to the top. The flavor is slightly bready and really grainy. Definitely some adjuncts here but thats ok. Cheap ingredients but this is actually quite smooth and crisp. Not too sweet either, slight bitterness even. Plus it is so cheap. Live the high life."
"Miller High Life is not good beer, but it is considerably better than the Bud Light that I had a while back. At least it doesn't make me grimace and look for a suitable place to spit it out. As well, it would have benefitted from being consumed hyper-cold on a stiflingly hot day. Not 'The Champagne of Beers', not by a long shot, but one could do much, much worse."
"So it won't help you, and it won't hurt you. And for a macro, that's not a bad deal. I'm not going to justify the average taste or the non-existent specific smell, but I'll tell you that this beer is drinkable because it's not heavy, it's crisp and refreshing, and goes down smooth. With nothing to overtly offend, I'm not at all upset that this is all my neighbor had in his fridge. Of course, it's now my turn to open his eyes to what's in mine..."
"$3.99 for a six pack huzza!"
"I would deffiantly buy this again."
"Quite a decent lawnmower beer. Though not something I'd look for at a beer bar, in its price range it's certainly something I'd drink if I were drinking a macro."
"It is drinkable, but really this isn't a German Hefe-Weisse!"
"yellow beer with a good head. Smells of grass and hay. Tastes the same with a dry finish. Thin mouthfeel evident of the adjuncts. I suppose it is ok to chug a few back after some yardwork or building a deck, but nothing to sit back and enjoy for the taste."
"Drinkability: It's perfectly harmless, neither awful nor exceptional. When you want beer as a beverage rather than an experience, this will do fine. At $12/case, I can't complain."
"Cheers"
"It's not horrible, nothing would stand it the way if you wanted to drink a lot, on the other hand there is nothing there that would make you want to drink a lot."
"Presented in a clear bottle with nice ""Champagne of Beer"" labeling. Clear yellow with a fizzy, foamy head. Not much aroma, a hint of malt and adjunct. Taste is more of the same - crisp, clean, generic macro beer. Not bad - in fact, it went perfectly with the chili I made today. Still, though, this is not exactly a high-quality brew."
"I used to drink this stuff all the time, so I decided to revisit it. At $10.49 a case of bottles, it is extremely cheap. Crystal clear golden color, with a short lived white head. Smells of corn and malt. Tastes extremely sweet, and gainy, not very good at all. Not a beer to buy."
"High Life it pours a pale yellow, looks like straw with a tiny head and lots of carbonation. It looks kind of like sprite with yellow food coloring. The taste is very bland and carbonated, just not impressive at all. The champagne of beers as right as far as carbonation goes, but not as far as taste. A real dissapointment."
"The taste was sort of bland, mainly grainy malt, a bit of straw, and a light, oh-so-faint bitterness in the finish. Still, this beer has a certain light, refreshing quality to it that makes it pretty easy to drink, especially if you dont let it get anywhere close to room temperature. While I can think of a huge number of other beers Id rather drink, if Im going to drink a mass-produced American lager, Id take this over a Bud or Coors any day."
"Drinkability: If you need a decent tasting beer to get a good buzz, by this in the convenient 32 oz. can; otherwise, approach with caution."
"F"
"I drink more of it than anything else. I would go broke if I tried to drink nothing but Belgians year round."
"I'd like to add on alil side note: Wow. What a difference drinking from a can and a bottle makes. High Life gives the biggest quality drop in the transition from bottles to cans of any other beer. High Life from a can tastes like cheap swill. On the other hand, Miller High Life from a bottle tastes like a damn fine beer. My review only pertains to High Life from bottles. Cans are a different story... completely different."
"Finally, there's the taste, which supercedes that of the vast majority of mass-produced beers out there. Add to this a lager-swilling chick sitting atop the crescent moon and voila, you're living the high life."
"I am re-rating this one. This is vastly improved over what I remember. Bright yellow in color, with an aroma of cooked veggies. The taste, however, is surprsingly creamy with a very light, sweet taste. I have never really cared for this beer, but after re-sampling several after a year or so's time, I find it to be a decent, cheap beverage. Much better than MGD or Lite. I remember when this was Miller's premium beer up there competing with Budweiser."
"I can't finish a quart of this filth. Down the drain it goes!"
"Its not so bad  and it brings back some great memories. Heres to you!"
"Miller High Life.. Where to begin. The High Life has been my lawnmower, hot weather, lack of funds, fall back beer since i was able to drink. It pours a pale straw yellow with a rather nice head which does actually stick around for a bit. The smell isnt much, some grain and a little sence of hoppiness. The flavour is crisp, perhaps a little too carbonated. I sometimes pour the glass and let it set for a moment so I dont turn into a belch factory. There is a sweetness to the beer at first , but then what hops there are team up and help give the beer a nice crisp clean finish. Over all I will choose the High Life over any Macro brew. Not only do i find it a refreshing nice everyday session beer, but it also brings back many memories. Good times... Good times..."
"Light golden color. Medium head. Citrus aroma. Crisp and lightly roasted malt flavor. Rustic hop flavor, with limited to no aftertaste. Good balance of malt and hop flavor. Might be all in my mind, but canned version seems to be lacking the citrus flavor which is prevalent in the bottled version. All in all, an excellent beer for the money. At $ 9.99  $11.99 for a 30-can case, you would be hard pressed to find a better beer per can value. But for enjoyment, I would stick with the bottled version."
"Enough of that. Why did I buy this? Very simple. It was about 100 degrees in my house and all I wanted was something ice cold and refreshing. Guess what? This did the trick."
"Smell is worthless, taste is corn and assorted adjuncts, mouthfeel of water and the drinkablilty is hindered by the off putting corn flavors"
"This beer lacks the typical metallic taste that many of its kind have, especially as they warm. It also has some flavor, aside from dirty water, and no harsh astringent alcohol, most likely because the ABV is quite low. Sweet malt and a touch of wheat round out the flavor, and the mouthfeel is surprisingly not as carbonated as you would think, making it pretty damn smooth. This certainly is not what I would call a good beer, but it stands up very well against American lagers."
"I have the feeling that it is a familiar taste but not as heavy as the original American lagers."
"It pours an average golden tone, quite pale hinting a coloured water-like appearance, with an average foam head that fades in a few minutes. No defining or appealing smell is present throughout the experience. When drank, it appears rather watery and its most present flavour is a very, very mild alcohol feeling above its scarce sweetness or bitterness. That reduces the drinkability as well, because you can easily go get tap water and save yourself the trip."
"Not necessarily something I would purchase to store at the house, but if offered at a festival or similar outdoor event, it does the job adequately."
"Miller High Life is a great all around beer. However, I wouldn't necessarily call it the ""Champagne of Beers."" I mean its good and all, but that title is very prestigious. I like the bottle it is in, very unique look. Its got a great taste, and one of my favorite beers around right now."
"Yellow water. Not much of anything her to even speak of. It's a standard mass produced American ""beer"". The only reason I even opened it is because a friend of mine left one in my fridge, and I don't like to waste beer, not even this one. I'm sure that there is a time and place that this would taste really good, I just don't know when or where it would be."
"If you're drinking in bulk ar just relaxing watching a baseball game, pick up a case and start living...the High Life. Enjoy!"
"A big fluffy white, and very inconsistant head tops this pale gold beer. Lots of carbonation bubbles. For about 12 bones you can get 30 of these guys. May not be the best beer in the world, but it cetainly isnt the worst. I used to be a king of beers guy for getting hammered, but this could be my new go to guy for the weekends."
"This beer pours very clear with a short white head. The looks are very average, and the smell is almost non existant. The mouthfeel is very thin, with a slight carbonation feel. The taste is surprisingly not bad, there are small hints of hop and corn, a slight crispness is there as well. Overall this would be a good beer on a hot day, but nothing you want to drink for flavor. For the price its a winner, it averages under $15 for a 30pk. If you want a good cheap beer, this one isnt bad, but it wouldnt be my first choice, PBR would be at the top of my cheap beer list. But this beer isnt too far behind."
"This beer is horrible. It doesn't look too bad, but open it up and experience the crappiness that is High Life. It smeels horrible and tastes even worse. No matter how cheap it is and how tempting it may be, do not buy Miller High Life. Pick up Pabst Blue Ribbon instead. Champagne of beers my ass."
"Tried some from a pitcher at the Pirate's Adventure in Orlando. Keeping my streak alive of not paying for a beer I am positive I won't like. Fizzy yellow crap, and I would rather eat belly button lint than pay for something like this. High life indeed."
"A few weeks ago I was visiting a buddy who is a brewer and never lacking great beer, but he had 4 Millers in the fridge that his father-in-law left behind. So we each cracked one for a goof. I have to say, it was much better than I expected. I had the misfortune of drinking a Bud a little while back, and the Miller easily blew that away. Miller's color is a deeper yellow, there is actually a faint hoppy aroma, and the taste is fairly smooth. No bitter aftertaste. The head is thin and leaves quickly, and yes it's watery without much character, but it goes down easy and is not offensive. If I find myself in a situation where it's Miller or nothing, I'll have a Miller with my host."
"The ""Champagne of Bottled Beers"" was always such a treat in my youthful years. Like most clear-bottled beers you must get this one as fresh as possible or you're in for some strong skunk overtones. A clean, crisp beer, the Miller formula still works well enough and this is clearly BTB. Not a bad ""go-to"" beer if A-Bs are the only other choice. Clear yellow, quickly departing white head, and virtually no lace, but the malt body with adjuncts is tasty enough to satisfy. A bit of a forced carbonation bite in the mouthfeel."
"I'll take a Miller over a Bud or Coors if thats my only choice. I also like High Life better than MGD. Still, lots of better American lagers to choose from!"
"The champagne of beers, well okay mabye that's pushing it just a bit, but I will say this it's one of the best shittiest beers around. I know that's a contradiction but for the price and being a college student I will live the High Life. Cmon this is a classic beer, hell I even contemplated making it my 100th. It pours a true golden color, already better than budweiser. I will say this is a fizzy golden beer with a highly carbonated get ready to belch foaming head she even leaves somewhat of a decent lace. The aroma is slightly vegetable with a lot of grainy adjunct ridden flow going on here. Not repulsive not complex, it's just beer at it's most simple macro light American lager form. A great crisp sweetness that is balanced by some hop bitterness to form one simple yet classic taste. Miller High Life is a beer worth a try, and when there is other beers attempting to be good around that aren't, I always go back to the High Life because it knows it's not a good beer. Refreshing with a creamy smooth mouthfeel that forms a foamy mustache on me, I love this brew along with the girl on the moon. You can drink this stuff all night it is meant to be swill, and there is no off flavors here or bad hangovers. So, for the style I give it my thumbs up!!!"
"Pours a golden hue with a white head, not a bad macro lager. Fairly crisp clean taste. No real dominant flavor, just a basic drink it on a hot day beer. Kinda cool retro packaging. Cheap, available everywhere, and not too bad. In a pinch it will get the job done."
"Pours an ultra-clear pale straw color with a snow-white fluffy head. The head retention is actually amazing for a macro. The smell of sweet corn adjuncts and a black pepper aroma in the background smell decent for what it is. The taste is a very mild earthy grain with again, some corn adjuncts and almost a hint of hops. Most all of the bite is from the carbonation. It is a thin bodied beer and drinkability is fairly high, especially in the Texas heat. I still prefer PBR over this, but this beer is not bad, it's just rather bland and boring. Cheers!"
"Pours a light, clear straw color with some carbonation and minimal but clingy head. Smell wasn't particularly strong but likewise wasn't unappealing. Light grains and some sweetness reach the nose. Taste is likewise fine but unremarkable. Crisp at the start with a somewhat clingy mouthfeel. Various flavors (hops, sweet malt, spice) are present, but the edges seem to have been taken off them to make this decidedly mainstream. Decidedly drinkable."
"The ""champagne of beers"" pours a clear pale gold in color with a white foamy head. Aroma consists of an oddly sweet malt, alcohol and hops scent. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. Taste is somewhat refreshing when cold, but overall a bland collaboration of malt, grain and corn. Of the Miller big 3, High Life is a better choice than the watered down Miller Lite and lackluster MGD from a ""taste only"" stand point, but that's like saying it's the lesser of the evils. I guess if I had to choose a beer from the American macros, this would probably be it. Certainly there are worse macros out there."
"I hadn't tried High Life in many years prior to this taste test. I remembered it as being the sweetest of the mainstream beers (and sheer piss when warm!). For this test, I had it along side of Bud, Yuengling, and Pabst Blue Ribbon. The Miller had a decent appearance, light golden color, foamy head, small retention and lace. The smell was decent. Somewhat spritzy in the taste and mouthfeel, and after a while, I began to taste something similar to a white wine (like pinot grigio?), which certainly suprised me. I could not drink this along with any of my regular beers. Far to weak and mainstream. But, it was better than I expected, and I probably will get it again some time, for when I'm in the mood for such a beer."
"Clear straw gold with a full head of bright white foam. It's retention is surprisingly good. It maintains a creamy collar and light surface covering throughout the glass, and leaves some very nice lace. The nose expresses a sweet malt with a very light touch of sulphur (but no more than should be expected of any lager). The body is medium/light. It's bubbles appear to be standard-sized and the carbonation level is median. The mouthfeel starts crisp but becomes lightly creamy as it crosses the palate. The flavor is as the aroma indicates with a clean, sweet-malt (obvious use of adjunct due to it's lack of graininess) dominating over whatever bitterness is present. It finishes dry with some lingering maltiness (but it never builds on the palate). Well done and enjoyable, although a touch sweet."
"Taste = sweet, light. Crisp mouthfeel. Not half bad, and considering the price I paid and the selection that was available at that gas station I'd buy this one again. I do remember preferring the taste of this beer in bottles (tho' with that clear glass beware of skunk.)"
"Of all the cheap beers, this is my favorate. Why do they have to bottle this beer in a white bottle is beyond me. I think that this could be the top selling beer, if they gave it a chance and bottle it in an amber color bottle. I think this is a mellow/smooth brew with a mild bitter after taste."
"This is one of my most favorite cheap beers. It has a nice light taste, but at the same time it had some hoppy taste to it. It is just the average light yellow color with a white ""head"" to it. The head didn't really last long. It goes perfectly on a hot summer day, at the beach, or watchin' the game. Get some."
"Its still a pretty good American style lager beer..its good value for what it is..nothing fancy working mans beer.Still drink this in the summer now and again..but not as often here in Oregon."
"This was my father's staple summertime beer when I was growing up. So I picked up a six pack out of curiousity (I figured, what the heck? I can cook with them if I hate it). It's not as bad as I remember most macros being...but not that good either. It definitely has value as a summertime quencher. It pours a pale straw yellow in the glass with a bright white and extremely fizzy head. ""Champagne of Beers"" must refer to the fizzy head, not the quality. The smell is of corn-like sweetness. The taste is not bad actually, it's just that the initial burst of flavor is so extremely short lived. There's some toasted bready malt, that corn sweetness and just a hint of herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light and there's a high degree of carbonation. Save this one for a very hot day and drink it ice cold."
"M"
"overall drinkibility is not bad, im sure they would go down easy whilst mowing yonder lawn."
"as far as cheap stuff i'd take this over most. perfect summer session beer, though if youre looking for any more than a medium in which to carry alcohol to the bloodstream, you might want to look elsewhere!"
"Golden yelllow color, fizzy white head, grainy corny aroma. Light body and light mouthfeel, grainy balanced fllavor, no hop profile, clean tasting with a sweet finish, always smooth and never bitter is not bad for what it is."
"Big sudsy white adjunct head, decomposes from underneath in large bubbles. Clear-as-crystal yellow color. ""High School Party"" smell, mostly a pronounced neutral sweetness with a slight sense of cheap cheddar cheese. Malt flavor is very corn syrup dominated, a ""cooked veggie"" taste that to me denotes aspects of canned potatoes. Hard to pick out anything else. Hops are leathery in quality, as in many macros, and the flavor flattens in a typical way. Yeah, its pretty bad in a grand and traditional way. Budweiser has better crispness."
"As far as macrobrews go, this is the best. It's pretty much always got a skunky aroma and flavor, and it's kinda watery, but it's cheap, and anyone with an alcohol tolerance level above that of a 15 year old girls', can drink about a thousand of these and still be functional. IMO, it's the tastiest macro money can buy, and it's always great at parties. If someone offers you one of these, don't start getting all beer snob on their ass and turn it down. I surpised myself when I liked this beer, and if you haven't had it in a while, you better drink it or Hoss McGraw will come give you a much needed ass whoopin'."
"the champagne of beers... WOW. i dunno about that, but you can do much worse things than investing in some high life. has a little hoppy kick in there mixed with a grains. it will do the job i guess."
"The best after-work beer.  A fine session beverage.  Also a solid, tastey option for the fiscally observant.  Yes, the Champagne of Beers!  I love this lady. Cheers!"
"This beer has some nostalgic value for me, so maybe that inflated my ratings, but this is one of the better American macros out there, and the price is always right."
"I used to work on boiler rooms in ships. That is how hot it has to be to truelly enjoy this beverage. The commercials about ""living the high life"" usually spotlight some mook who appears: a) only to live on a diet of beef, b) no wife or girlfriend and c) has a weight problem. Who is the target audience?"
"While Miller High Life is not on top of the mountain of Beers, its not on the bottom either."
"For what this is, it ain't all that bad.  Very thin and void of any complexity, this single 12oz. sample has served well as a break from the other summer brews.  OK, the break is over. I recommend chilling the glassware thoroughly before the pour.. this goes south right quick!"
"This will always be ""The Champagne of Beers""."
"I've always had a fondness for this beer more than the other macro-brews.  History plays the part in that my father liked it, it was the first brewery I saw and it's a great session beer of my youth.  There is a smoothness about it that I like and makes it easy to drink when I'm hot and thirsty. Adjuncts can be detected, but aren't overpowering (as long as it is comsumed cold).  As with others, for the style it is, it is a fine example."
"Note: On-tap the taste is similar but the head retention and size is much better"
"Easy to drink, crisp and refreshing. Perfect on a hot summers day. Not complex in anyway but it accomplishes what it set out to do. An excellent cheap beer."
"Well, an American staple to say the least.  I know a man who can drink these from 7am on a Clemson football game day and not stop clear through 9 or 10pm.  Whatever that tells you...  Nevertheless, not terrible.  Prost!"
" Very smooth and highly drinkable.  An awesome beer when you are livin the high life."
"This is not one of the beers that I normally buy, however, after my experience at the party with the Miller beer, I wouldn't feel bad buying this cheap beer when entertaining a large group.  Of course there would still be the ""better"" beer available in limited quanity, of course."
"Slight sweet nose and very pale yellow look.  Very clean and carbonated.  Smooth and malty on the mouth.  Of course no hops to speak of, but I am surprised of how good the brew tasted.  It was reccomended on the forum and rightly so for a cheap macro swill brand.  This is still slightly below average for my definition of ""beer"".  But would be great for fishin'... and tail-gateing.  Choose it before those other more pricey macros..."
"I've got to come clean.  This is my favorite American macro.  It doesn't have any patently offensive odor or flavor.  In fact, it actually has a bit of real beer taste.  It goes down like water, like an American ""Premium"" Lager should.  And that lady in the red dress sitting on the crescent moon looks kind of cool."
"High Life:  I’ve said it here before; High Life in those tapered bottles can be about the easiest drinking beer around. Today, I’ve had it in a can, and when it’s cold, it gives PBR a solid run for its money.  A macro-beer without the adjunct after burn (unlike its brother MGD), well worth the two bucks at the train barn."
"High Life is an American icon."
"Drinkability/notes: Perhaps the best of the cheap nationals and far better than Natural Light. This was the first beer I ever tried and was my Dad's favorite."
"I spent too much time discussing this beer.  A pretty acceptable macro, and that's it."
"Miller Low Life as I call it, but then again it was very crisp, clean finish and consistently is. So for that, combined w/ the low life price it's actually not that bad. Very freshing, and that makes for the perfect beer to buy for your friends at the BBQ party in the summer...as long as your friends are not fellow beer advocates..."
"first of all it pours the best head of any american mass produced lager and it sticks the whole way down...it has body, character and aroma. an aquired taste...but those older and wiser than I have converted me to the High Life. i'm hooked. $13 a 30pack here in the northland makes it the absolute biggest bang for your beer buck too. an iced tea characteristic makes it oh-so poundable in the summer time too. some people hate it, others love it. decide for yourself."
"I tell you what..for a macro brewed lager this is a pretty tasty beer...it really is...in fact out of a can I like it better than MGD (which is another pretty good macro lager)..I've always favored malty sweet beers (I love Bocks, dopples, and Octoberfests)...and for a basic American lager this is pretty good..it's priced right too....if you put a gun to my head and said spend $12 on a case of beer this would be my call...(remember the price restrictions..I picked up a case of this...and a case of 4 different micro six packs...The Miller came to $11...the grand total to close to $50...you can do the math there..)"
"I feel that I was perhaps swayed by their amazingly wonderful High Life adds, but I find myself more often than not grabbing a 12 pack O'High Life for $5.99. Better than most of its competition, meaning that it actually tastes good. Goes surprisingly well with Chinese food. Go figure. Anyway, It is an easy to drink fun beer that can be your dirty little secret. After all, it is the Champagne of beers, right?"
"Horse piss in a bottle.  But it's cheap!  Reminds me of boxed cereal, on the nose.  Grain/wheat flavors on the palate, however below-average to poor in this department.  I'm astonished that some people feel this is a quality beer!  Would much rather sit back with a quality hefeweizen, even if it's three times as expensive."
"At 13.49 a 30 pack it's a great beer to fill the fridge with."
"Always strikes me as sweet and grainy.  At least they aren't afraid to make a beer that tastes like beer."
"should be outraged"
