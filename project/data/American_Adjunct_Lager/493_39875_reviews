"Very bland, empty bodied beer. Not for me!"
"Was our go to while in Thailand as there was not much else. Was a good value but did come with a vicious ""Changover"""
"Clear golden bubbly body with a soap bubbly head that thins quick. Thin sweet grass aroma. Faint malt and spice taste. Clean and crisp finish."
""
"Tried this at a local Thai place. Way to dry and flavorless."
""
""

"Not much to say about Chang specifically.  Cheap bad beer from Thailand.  Piss."
""
"Yes it is bland and boring,  but nothing unpleasant like some of these AALs.  A touch of sweet malts in the finish.  Easy drinker that pretty much goes down  like water.  I could easily polish off a few of these in a warm climate,  and isn't that kind of the point of these export AALs?"
"Goes perfectly well spice Thai food.  Besides that, it's pretty flavorless.  Refreshing."
"Boring and a bit unpleasant beer that lacks character. Quite expensive too."
"I am at my hotel in Bangkok. This is crappy Thai beer.  It's 6%, so it's doing the job a little better than the 5% piss available. Don't expect anything spectacular.  Tastes like singha, tiger, San miguel, asahi, or any other asian piss!"

"Had one while waiting for my takeout at my local Thai restaurant. I have to say, it's not terrible and I was expecting it to be pretty bad.  Reminds me a bit more of a Czech pilsner thanan adjunct lager.  Definitely has a sweet malt backbone that beers of this type don't usually have.  No particularly off flavors and I have to attribute that to its 5/15/15 sell be date.  In truth its actually pretty good. So based on the reviews I've seen, get one of these fresh if you can or don't bother."
"Pretty mucha carbon copy of the aroma profile. Mildly sweet with orange and mandarin and a slightly sour nip at the end so it is like eating a mandarin that is just on the turn."
"Overall a suprisingly tasty beer. I will try to find a fresher version to see if it improves any."
""
""
"Not a good beer, very sweet taste, almost no hops/bitterness detectable. Aroma is the same. Probably some DMS. Drink it cold!"
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
""
""
"Overall - Slightly better than  I had expected this beer is not dreadful and with some spicy food it is drinkable but it is not one I will ever buy again and I would never serve it to real people."
""
"Between Chang and Singha I prefer Singha."

"This is what I expected. An imported , probably mass produced beer from, from Thailand. Did I actually expect more?. The color is the best part of this beer. It is a crystal clear gold color with small bubbles rising from the bottom of thr glass and gently nudging the top of the beer. Head was fast and gone just as fast. Tiny lacing. Aroma is kind of like a damp skunk!. Taste also is like a damp skunk, lol. Seriously, it is an ok beer that I would drink very cold when I am looking for a quick buzz and I can pound a few of them"
""
"Not a exciting beer, was it worth the $8 dollar a pack? yea I suppose, and sure it was  more warmly received in my circle then a Budweiser or Corona, but I can go the rest of my life without it and would rather spend money on something else"
"Drinkability/Overall: Overall has the character of a typical mass-produced lager. Fairly refreshing at first and I could picture drinking it (in absence of other choices) on a hot summer day, but other than that I would not want to try it again and barely did not mind trying it in the first place."

"O: Not great, there are better lagers in Asia, drink if free but if choose something else if it’s available."

"Not too much flavor... almost watery.... however very drinkable. Reminds me of the Japanese beer ""Asahi dry"" . Goes down smooth and is the type of beer that I can drink a lot of at a barbeque on a sunny day. Nothing special. Very little aroma and after taste."
""
""
""
"I’m having a really tough time rating this beer. It has a certain adjunct- laden taste that is unappetizing, but on the other hand, it is fairly drinkable even if a little sweeter and less balanced than I prefer. I can think of better tasting Asian brews, but this one is tolerable if it’s all you can find. It is clean and reasonably crisp, even if quite bland and plain overall."
"A light, inoffensive lager that succeeds in being a good complement to spicy foods. It's not as bad as some of the reviews claim! Hop fans will want to look elsewhere, as the hop flavor is almost non-existent although it does provide a little bitterness to counteract the malty sweetness. This should not be classified as an adjunct lager as it is an all-malt beer and its maltiness is its most pleasant characteristic. The bottle I drank was near the sell-by date, so while it was pretty drinkable, I am sure it would have been better 10 months ago!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Really uninspiring even for a cheap import."
""
""
""
""
""

"I would say that this beer is just like any other asian pale lager, and in many ways it is. It pours from the bottle with a pale, straw-yellow color topped by a fizzy white head, and there is almost no discernible aroma other than a mild mustiness and a faint graininess. The flavor does have a bit more character than most, though, with a bit of grassy hops and a nicely sweet cereal malt character. Overall, this beer isn't going to be something I search out, but it went just fine with a nice green curry."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Had a bottle poured into a pint glass as an accompaniment to a really good green curry. I am fairly familiar with this beer from years of eating in Thai restaurants but usually choose Singha. Here Chang gets the formal review treatment. A pale straw yellow beer, maybe just veering towards lemon, with minimal white foam even when poured aggressively. Aroma is primarily cooked vegetable DMS, old malt, and a nondescript spice note ... I might be getting a hint of lemon or some other dried out citrus fruit. Palate is also dominated by DMS, doughy pale malt that evokes cheap white bread, and low key grassy hops coupled with the odd apple juice or artificial banana fruity note that pokes out here and there. Diacetyl? Thin, super fizzy, and finishes crisp and clean despite the sweet start, although I did notice a propensity to get sweeter and a bit rank as the beer warmed up. Its a standard American adjunct lager from Asia. Cooked, sweet, bland. I choose Singha for a reason."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is much worse than its local competitor Singha and also behind our local mass adjunct lagers. Awkward flavor with lots of off-flavors with a low drinkability. To toss it, a sin I at any cost."

"Overall Drinkability: Surprisingly enjoyable and very non-offensive."
""
"O: Not very flavorful, goes down easily and not too filling since there isn’t much to the beer, mild kick, typical representation of style, it’s not completely bad but there are many other beers even in the style that I would choose first."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, this beer surprised me with how great it tastes, but needs more carbonation. I really enjoyed its honey/bready/tobacco taste."
""
""
"Sad to think that the only redeeming quality of this beer is to ""put out the fire"" if you eat spicy food. A very plain Adjunct Lager that should be sold at PBR prices. I am disappointed by all aspects of this beer. Going out on a limb to try a new beer is not always rewarding."

"Food match: Thai, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Indonesian cuisines all work with beers like Chang, again it's all about washing down that curry, nothing more, nothing less."

"Pairs well with An Anthology of Chinese Experimental Music 1992-2008"
"Well, it's one of the worst adjunct lagers I've had."
""
""
"Overal a decent lager, and a vast improvement over the last time I had it."
"The beer is not very impressive. I didn't expect it to be. If it was hot outside, I could see myself chugging three or four of these. Maybe even on the golf course. This is not my first beer from Thailand, and I am sure it won't be my last. But this is nothing worth writing home about. If you are out, and it is the same price as whatever domestic you are offered, try it. Oh, and if you are in Thailand, try it. Of course you have to try it over there!"

"Meh. Just another bland, characterless, mass-produced lager. Hardly any flavour or aroma. Probably quenches your thirst in a hot climate, but no great shakes otherwise. No need to seek it out."

"O - A tasty brew, but nothing memorable. It paired well with my pad Thai, but I would prefer a lot of more flavorful beers to pair with my Thai dish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - No, this wasn't great. It was an add-in on a mixed sixer. Better than a lot of other green bottle imports of this style."

"you know, for the asian mass beers, i kind of like this one. especially decent with authentic thai food, as was the case last night at bangkok cafe on the corner of hampden and downing. poured into a frosted metal mug, a good head rose up. smell was off, extracty and chemical, but not offensively so, just not maybe as fresh as it could be. flavor really isnt bad, middle of the road malt profile with just a touch of pseudo-hop bitterness to crisp things up in the finish. feel isnt bad either, very light body and good carbonation. kind of stits in the belly weird, and could be filling despite its lightness. i remember running amok on these during songkran on the streets of bangkok, its a good party beer."

"O: Not a bad beer, a little light on the flavor and aroma but definitely easy to drink and sessionable. Obviously this would pair well with spicy food due to the sweetness. Something I would likely order again when out for Thai food as most of the Thai restaurants in the area stock Thai beers and this one is a little bit superior to some of the others."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about the brew was how it evened out through the flavoring, and how nicely it finished. For the style it was nicely balanced, and not overly sour or biting with the adjuncts and mineral bitters. There was a creamy pop and good look to it as well, making for a decent beer to go with some cheap Chinese food or sushi."
""
"This was the one unusual beer in a crappy liquor store in Palm Springs, Calif."
""
"I suppose it wouldn't harm too much to give it a try in a Thai restaurant but otherwise give a wide birth."
"I tried this beer one night eating out at a Thai restaurant. The waiter insisted that I try it. The color was a dark yellow color with a thin head. The smell was kind of skunky with a normal domestic smell mixed in. As for the taste, it's what I was expecting from an Asian beer, dry and bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Out of a bottle this Thai beer was a clear, golden color with one finger of white head. The retention of the cap was average and it left scattered lacing. The aroma was of adjunct grains especially corn along with some light sweet malt. The flavors were similar dominated by the corny grain with some hints of sweet malt, bread and grassy hops behind that. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium/light and the carbonation appropriate. Passable, but little more than that."

"There is very little of interest here. This lands somewhere between an american adjunct and a euro pale. It's weak, subdued, but in the end very drinkable."
"D: This is a decent beer for the price. Probably one of the better brews that's brewed in Thailand. Hard to choose between this and Chang Extra. This one is more expensive, a bit more refined in flavor, but has lower alcohol content than the Chang Extra(6.5%). Try it and see for yourself!"

"Overall Drinkability - -Possibly the best American Adjunct Lager I've ever had, and it's not even made in America! Keep in mind I'm rating in style here. Absolutely great in style. I'd almost dare to say I hate AAL's, but I actually really like this beer. The delicateness and balance of the flavors reminds me of the Westvleteren Blonde. I don't make these comments lightly."
"D: easy drinking, poundable brew. say what you want, but for an adjunct lager, this isnt that bad. any bits of flavor are a good thing."
"O-Best served on a hot sunny day in Thailand, otherwise better off with something else."
"D- would be much better with more carbonation. by the way this beer looked initially, i expected something better and closer to a pils. as far as asian pale lagers, i'll go with a rice lager like sapporo before chang."
"Overall this is an incredibly accurate representation of the AAL category--bland and uninspiring. Will not be drinking again."
"Not much to recommend this one, although it doesn't have any obvious flaws and works as a good beverage to accompany a meal."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"M/D: light and watery just like a macrolager. Of course it's drinkable but really good for parties."
"O: A rather nice Adjunct Lager, not too watery."
"Overall: I am surprised, one of the few lagers I have had in recent months that I didn't struggle to finish. I could drink this with a good curry and be quite happy."
"A light golden yellow color with a modest white ring on top and fair lacing on the chilled pilsner glass. The aroma is firm wheat and rice/corn sort of breadiness. The flavor follows suit with grainy goodness in a medium light bodied brew with plenty of light but lively carbonation for a refreshing feel. There is an interesting grape idea mixed in but basically this is just another international generic “beer” that is plenty drinkable and goes good with food. Feel free to have one but I doubt you’ll be motivated to stock up."
"Lighter bodied. Good carbonation. Not hated, but not great. The bitterness works, but there isn't much else to this one. Very light flavors."
"Straw yellow with faint haze and a white cap that quickly disappeared, other than a thin collar and a few spotty specks clinging to the glass. Mild aroma, dry malt extract and cooked corn, sweet with cereal graininess, a little grassy. The flavour is poorly balanced. Too much sweetness up front, not just malty but nearly sugary, grainy character, with bitterness that was quite low yet still sort of harsh and sharp. A bit fruity with lingering astringency and a hint of spiciness. The texture wasn't terrible, but wasn't appealing either -- low to medium bodied with rough carbonation. I'd pass on this in the future even if it was free."
"Not the most flavorfull beer around, would be good to swig on if your eating spicy food. Otherwise, only worth it to try a beer from Thailand."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that fades to a thin cap. Thin rings of lace drip back down into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grains and corn flakes with a slight honey aroma as the beer warms. Taste is of sweet grains and corn flakes too. This beer has an average level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average lager in every sense. Nothing too bad but nothing too great either."
"Not much to talk about, good if you want a modest experience."
"T: Pretty much the same as the smell. Lager yeast, some faint breadiness, maybe a touch of grass and some grain. Not the worst, but far from the best."
"The beer pours a basic light, clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is full of corn and grain with nothing else going on. The flavor is more of the same. Other than the grain, I get a little bit of grass but that is it. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Outside of the fact the beer was not skunked - as I expected it to be - I don't have anything else nice to say."
"More expensive than BMC, but the quality is in line with them."
"A very light dryish aftertaste, a very forgettable beer."
"Not really good but not really bad either, just a middle of the road straightforward lager, a half step above the average American macro probably for not other reason than novelty. But with some spicy thai food, it really hits the spot. Nothing to drink just for drinking it, but it complements food well enough to be passable."
"Not much of a head that was gone before I even sat down. Slighty cloudy straw color. Smells mostly of cereal/corn w/ some grass. Taste is typical island lager style. Refreshing in a lawn mowing beer kinda way. At least its not crossing that sickning sweet threshold and does taste pretty fresh. Watery and lacking in the carbination department. Thinking this would probably be great at taming a spicy plate of pad kee mao (Thai Drunken Noodle). I will probably seek it out next time I go to a Thai restaurant, but probably won't have it again at home."
"Like its fellow compatriot's offering around here, this comes off better than expected. Even though I wasn't having Thai food when I had it, and thus I can't do the usual ethnic ""x food with x beverage"" comparison, it still went down easily, I suppose, and was agreeable enough for this typically all-too underwhelming style."
"An innofensive, decent-tasting macro lager that did its job well. As far as being a 'country-ticker' brew, this one is certainly better than most. Sometimes, all you need is a pale lager."
"O= Not a bad beer. It sort of tastes like Grain Belt Premium a bit but more expensive and not as local to me..."
"D- Its a beer. Very much akin to a US macro brew. There is nothing special . It isn't bad, but its far from good."
"Pours a typical clear amber with not much head, but this may have been a result of the way it was poured. Scanty aroma is crisp and malty, not impressive. Flavor is malty and a little fruity, average but still palatable. Texture is smooth and fairly fizzy. Overall, an average beer, but still drinkable. This one is better for a party or as an accompaniment to dinner rather than by itself."
"I poured it into a pint glass.. with very little head. The head that is present disapates very quickly. It's very similar in color to a Miller Lite. Didn't get much of an aroma, I found it similar to Iron City or Lone Star. And the taste left something to be desired as well. It felt like I was drinking a domestic light beer, easy to drink, little flavor, little aroma, little mouth feel, little aftertaste."
"[END]"
"I had it at a Thai restaurant, straight from the bottle. Obviously it was difficult to smell but slightly sweet and a hint of nondescript hops. Some hop flavor and balanced. Light mouthfeel. The food was the focus and the beer complimented it. I wouldn't get it again."
"Overall-not too bad and actually goes well with full flavored Thai food, still, judging on its own merits it's an ok adjunct and nothing more."
"Had 12oz bottle at Thai restaurant. Yellowish, straw in color. Noting too intriguing about the color. Yet a small head with a nice small consistent lacing through out the whole beer. A slight sweet soft candy note but with a distinct grain backbone. a little corn. A little sweet . A sweet grainy build to it. Not completely off putting, compared to most ""american adjuncts"" Light bodied, but not watery. Medium carbonation"
"D: The taste isn't all that bad, but it is rather grainy like rice. Not good, but not horrible."
"I was invited to a Thai place and when I arrived I realized there wasn't anything for me to drink and then after being offered this. I was surprised to say the least. My perspective was that this is gonna be another crappy adjutant lager, well It wasn't. Next time I'm in a Thai place I'll get one of these. It not bad."
"This could work fairly well with a spicy thai meal but as a session brew it's too sweet."
"D: One is good for me. It beats out a lot of other macro adjunct lagers in my opinion, but it is not amazing enough to merit anything above average."
"Fine but not something you do an extra effort for"
"Not impressed, would not purchase."
"Not worth trying. I will never drink it again."
"overall, i always like to try new beer so i enjoyed the opportunity, but i will not be buying this one again"
"Cheers!"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink but nothing really stands out in the smell or taste that would make me want to have another one of these as a standalone beer. I guess it's not a bad accompaniment if you're having spicy Asian cuisine."
"Drinkability: really, the flavor is kind of getting to me on this one. It's very mild unpleasantness is just sort of building, and, though it's not worthy of a drain pour, I might have to suck it down quick to get it over with."
"Not a must have...."
"D: No impressive. The extreme taste of adjunct cereals does not help too much here..."
"Notes: Not even a decent beer. If you're one of those people who want to drink one while you eat at a Thai restaurant, don't. It's not even worth a try. Just a foreign take on this style."
"The Thai have some problems with making beer from my experiences."
"330 ml bottle, best before July 14, 2010. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is sweet malt and grain/adjuncts, not much else. Taste is the same as the aroma, it's all malt/grain/adjuncts. However, there aren't any offensive aromas/flavors at all. Mouthfeel/body is light, and also crisp. Drinkability isn't awful, it's not exactly enjoyable to drink but it's not bad to drink either. For the style, it's a decent enough brew. I've certainly had worse!"
"D: I could have several of these fairly quickly on a hot day, but not worth it for the money."
"D: Well, this beer is certainly light and easy to down; pretty much like any passable beer of its type. It has no offensive flavors, which is a plus. But I really wish it had something going on to peak my interest. Alas, it doesn't. It's basically Thailand's Budweiser."
"D: Not very tasty, although goes down easily - on it's own, I didn't care for this beer. Once the food started rolling, it did pair nicely with the Thai food that I was consuming."
"D: Good for cooling off all the spicy thai food I was eating, but not much else."
"This is basically the beer I expected from Thailand. Simple, light, and quite banal. It's not good beer, it's not bad beer, it's just beer. Kinda like Budweizer, Coors, or High Life."
"Not something I would offer to anyone else without a disclaimer."
"Mouthfeel is typical for this style, thin, smooth and whispery. Drinkability is, well, um drinkable? It certainly goes down smooth and you could drink them all day long, but why? Overall, this is no worse than the major American examples of the style, so if that's what you're in the mood for, why not give this brew a shot?"
"Bleh. This is just another crappy macro lager. It's sweet and vegetal. There's a sickly sourness in the aroma that is off-putting. The head fades almost immediately and a pale golden glass, perfectly calm, is not terribly appetizing. The flavor lacks for hops and the malt tastes cheap and adjuncty. This beer must sell solely on the strength of its country of origin. This was a disappointment even as a curiosity."
"Chang Beer pours a light yellow with a white head from a green 11.15 ounce bottle. The aroma is grainy, maybe a little grassy. I might taste a little bit of malt in the flavor, but otherwise it's just grainy. Light, easy to drink, but has a bit of an off flavor I can't put my finger on."
"Feel and Drinkability: Finish is semi-dry. Feel is light and spritzy. This is one that I'll drink but not necessarily enjoy but I'll not hate it either. Its not bad but its not great either. Is it worth the money, no. Glad to have tried it though. Beers like this shouldn't be as expensive as they are."
"D: east to drink, fair impression, not bad; but, would not drink another"
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. This is the first time I saw this beer here in the states and it reminded me of some crazy times in Thailand. Pours a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, some malts. Taste is very light, some malts and grains, not a lot going on. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall not as good as I remembered it, Very mediocre."
"Yellow lager with a decent head retention that sort of smells like fermented apples. It actually has the taste to match with a bit of bittersweet undertone. I was surprised at the taste because it was rather pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium, will coat the inside of your mouth, but no unpleasant aftertaste while drinking."
"D: This is probably the lightest, most water-like beer I've had. It would make for a good ball-game or lawn-mowing beer, but that's about it."
"Drinkability: Glad to have met it, though this is definitely a one-and-done deal for me. While it is by no means great, Thailand could certainly do much worse for their ""Number 1 Beer""."
"Sugary-sweet malts are the chief aroma with a little grassy chaser and almost nothing in the way of hops. But because it is so thin it is easy to chug down. That may not necessarily be a great quality but there you have it."
"A slightly skunked smell along with some faint, stale malt. Not pleasant, but I've smelled worse. Taste is suprisingly less skunked and matly. Very light. Some hops comes into play with some faint spice and crispness. As it warms, it becomes a bit stale. Still not bad enough for me to pour out. Not bad...drink cold!"
"Was out last night at a Thai & Vietnamese restaurant and ordered a Chang with my bowl of pho. Poured into a pint glass. No head at all. Orange color. Looked a lot like apple juice. Smell and taste were barely passable as beer. Just bland and no flavor. Had to add a few drops of siracha to my noodle soup to get some kind of flavor to this meal as this beer added nothing. This beer is too much like water; just something to drink along with dinner. Not worth trying."
"D-- If you are in Thailand and it is 95 degrees and 90 percent humidity I can see where this would be worth drinking. I am not and nor would I drink this. ICK. Really bland and fairly flavorless until the skunky bitter taste in the end. No Thanks."
"D - As far as adjunct lagers go its not a that bad but its not good enough for me to want to drink more than one"
"However, I could not recommend this."
"Not a clean lager by any means. You have to feel pity for the people of Thailand if this is their top-selling beer. We'd certainly prefer a solid pilsner or IPA over this beer when we want a plate of pad thai. All in all, pass on this one ... not even worth a try."
"Mouthfeel was watery, thin and it did not help the beers drinkability."
"As hinted at in the beginning of this review, I had enough in the bottle for a second serving. Head was non-existant at second pour. Sweetness came through a little more, but the corniness and lingering aftertaste remained, though by this point the aftertaste was less distracting. The beer goes down easy enough, but I'm just not impressed by the flavor. I've had adjunct lagers as session beers before, but I wouldn't count this among them."
"I have had quite a few of these Chang's before, most often with some sort of Chinese food. I will continue in that vein and otherwise avoid this as an afternoon thirst quencher."
"Overall an oddly sweet beer that is very one dimensional."
"A decent example of this ubiquitous, lifeless style."
"M + D: Sparkling carbonation, and finishes pretty smooth and clean. A great beer, it may not be, but it's not what I would consider a bad beer, either. I could stand sucking back a couple of these on a sunny afternoon without complaint."
"D- Good pairing for eating spicy thai food. This complimented my extra spicy cashew chicken. I would drink this beer again."
"Drinkability - refreshing but nothing special. The packaging is what drew me to this, just an average beer."
"Not as thin as a typical American macro, but the rest is pure mass-produced grainy wanna-be pilsner. Again, no real hop to be found in the taste. And the aftertaste dies immediately after the swallow. Still, I'd say this is better than most factory beers."
"Pale yellow pour with a thin, creamy, short lived head. Smells of pale malt and some floral hops. Not too bad. Flavor profile is fairly close to a Euro pale lager (Thai-neken?). As far as beers that you can get in Thai restaurant, this is one of the better ones. Did a fair job at cooling down the food I was eating. Reading some of these reviews other people seem to have had a different experience. I dunno, maybe I was in a good mood."
"D- All in all this isn't a bad beer. Not my first choice of course but to be honest not my worst. I have tasted micros that I would put below this in terms of taste. Doesn't mean I'll be buying it anytime soon though."
"D = 2.0 I'd stay away from this. I would only accept one if it was purchased for me AND if I were in company where refusing to drink it would be an insult. Beyond that, I wouldn't even get intentionally drunk off this beer."
"Solid, pils style. Served from a bottle. I had this right after a PU and this showed much better- lighter on the hops, but with a perfect malt balance. It actually reminds a bit of the Easter European beers, maybe just a touch less body. I would love love to serve this in a blind tasting, I have a feeling it would fool plenty a beer geek."
"Typical lager, no great depth or power and a dry aftertaste left in the mouth ruined the tasting for me."
"Tasty beer much to my surprise. I really expected a forgettable Budweiser clone but this isn't one. Sweet like Asian lagers tend to be this one has the hops to make it all balance out and your taste buds sing."
"You can still drink it but it won't knock your socks off. It's what it is."
"Notes: I had this with Thai food and while it was not a great or even a good beer,it was decent enough and complimented the food just fine. There are better beers for spicy food,but this did well."
"Notes: Reminds me of the few Chinese beers I've had in the States. Nothing going on here, except old lager."
"If I had to have a Far East beer i would take Tiger over this any day"
"O) Surprisingly drinkable. There's nothing wrong here, even given the fact that we were dumped with out of date product (the curse of Texas it seems). While I won't be buying this again just to drink, I would certainly order some with Thai food."
"Macro lager. What do you think it looks like? Nose is incredibly sweet, in that insipid (can a smell be insipid?) caramel malt (with a healthy dollop of rice/corn, I'm sure) candy that this kind of beer often has. Flavor is sickly sweet as well - reminds me of Rolling Rock. Fortunately, there's a ton of carbonation in here, so it masks the flavor fairly well. Overall, this beer is bad. A buddy told me that the brewery is a hot mess so every beer tastes different. But I tried two and they both sucked, so forget this."
"Pours a pale yellow colored body, with a whitish colored head, and is somewhat lasting. Has a malty, somewhat English-like aroma, similar to other English beers I've had, might be the hops. Has a pretty grainy taste, with some maltiness. Somewhat flattish."
"Overall: I never thought I would see this beer again, but it was part of the Beers of the World box that was givin to me by my cousins girlfriend for christmas. I was better than I thought it would be."
"D: The dryness in my mouth after this beer and lack of flavor gave me very little to enjoy here."
"Chang is definitely a session beer. There is nothing too strong to the taste that would stop one from putting down a case of these with ease. The 5% ABV doesn't show up in the taste, which may be dangerous."
"Too be honest, this wasn't as bad as I was expecting after the look and smell of it. It had the feel of a US Macro brew. It has a sour aftertaste, but it will do."
"If I were in Thailand, I can imagine enjoying a few Changs for lack of other beer. Water probably would be a better choice."
"Probably my favorite Asian beer to date"
"Poured into a pint glass. Light yellow gold with a snow white head that fizzes out with medium rapidity and leaves no lacing. Aroma is strong adjunct, mealy corn syrup. Flavor is literally almost nonexistent. The slightest ricey sweetness and the ample carbonation make this just distinguishable from water. I've had quite a few absurd pale lagers from random countries and this one is still astonishing with each sip in how thin and watery it is. At least it's inoffensive."
" It is what is, simple and effective."
"Nothing about this beer made me want to have another, or for that matter even finish the one I started. I poured one glass, which left about half the bottle full. It was a chore to finish the glass, and the rest of the bottle never made it that far. Avoid this one unless you enjoy drinking lousy beer."
"As noted above, Chang Beer is kinda, sorta acceptable as a food washer-downer. There's nothing here that you can't find at your local Quickie Mart, except perhaps a fraction more bitterness. That alone will turn off most aficionados of *real* American macro lagers."
"There are some good examples of quality asian lagers ... however this one is definitely not working ... smells and tastes like a grapefruit-flavored-juice mixed with formaldehyde, sweetish and sticky ... this one might work in a Patpong bar, but certainly not in comparison with well crafted brews ..."
"Jk"
"Not bad..."
"D- I would not recommend this one to anybody. This is just not good at all. Didn't even taste good with my Thai dinner."
"Well, it's as drinkable as any mega-lager in that it tastes vaguely like beer and goes down easy. But as a fan of craft brews, this doesn't hold any further interest for me."
"Hey, it has a cool bottlecap!"
"...got this at Tong's Thai on Austin HWY"
"A totally drinkable brew. Not great, as I've already mentioned, but not all that bad either. It's not fancy, but it serves a purpose. A fine lawnmower beer for those who want to seek it out. I bet it goes just fine with a spicy curry or a sweet pad thai."
"Overall I thought Chang would be something fun to try while I was at an ""authentic"" Thai restaurant. But to be honest, I was highly disappointed when I got the equivalent of a pocket friendly good old american beer."
"Cute bottle. Standard straw lager color, small white head recedes to nothing. Grainy aroma, not especially fresh smelling. On teh mouth this was not skunked but did not have a refreshing snap--tasted like several terribly mediocre Asian macrolagers. Bland bitterness with a stale malt flavor. Makes Singha taste great!"
"Tasted on 5/3/08."
"There must be lots of lawns to mow in Thailand because as a summer lawnmower beer, this one fits the bill."
"D- if its really hot, you're in Thailand and you have a quarter, buy a Chang. If you're in the US, use it to buy a gumball."
"D: Unless you find yourself in Thailand getting a special massage. Avoid."
"D: Nothing special here, but the higher ABV may bump it over Singha."
"The taste is slightly full-bodied for the style, overall rather dry although it has a light sweetness and a very light bite. The flavour is very light, being mostly apple with a hint og grain and a light alcoholic quality. As it warms, a very light, slightly unpleasant chemically soap quality develops, especially in the finish."
"D: It has a light body but a funky flavor that diminishes the enjoyment of the beer as the glass emptied. This is a one and done beer that will likely never cross my lips again."
"Pours with a white, three-finger head, fades quickly to a ring leaving a trace of lace. Light carbonation and light bodied. Crystal clear pale amber color. Nose is slightly grassy. Flavor is bland some sweetness easy enough to drink but so is water. Would make a good lawn mower beer. $1.85 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA"
"Another bland lager, nothing to see here."
"Drinkability: Light enough to drink a caseful, but not flavorful enough to want to. In the wide world of beer, it's mediocre, but it's good for the style."
"Aroma is more akin to a euro lager than an american macro. Faint malt and floral in nature. Tasted mostly sweet with a faint hop bite and just a smidge of spiciness. Medium light in body, this beer would certainly pair well with Thai cusine and i wish the local restaurant would stock it."
"A solid macro lager. Easy-drinking for the warm Thai climate as well as (I presume) spicy Thai cuisine. You don't need to go out of your way for this, but if you can get a single, ""Thai"" it (try it)."
"A pretty poor Thai beer. Clear yellow with no head, and nose is metallic grain. Taste is grains with slight hops on the end, but an odd alcoholic taste like turpentine (maybe it's the rumored formaldehyde?). Mouthfeel is thin, and drinkability is lacking. The best part of this beer is the logo."
"Maybe it would be better served with some spicy Thai chicken, but on it's own, not good."
"I had this beer in a local Thai restaurant down the street. I am a man who loves flavorful food and flavorful beer. I poured this beer in a pilsner glass that was given to me and the head immediately disappeared. The pale yellow hue reminded me of the same color as bud light. The beer was refreshing only because it was cold but lacked flavor in every way possible. I suggest to everyone to pass on this one because it was definitely a big waste of time. Try Singha if you're in a Thai restaurant and don't waste your money or time on Chang like I did."
"The OE of Thai beers, Beer Chang has that artificial sourness of a beer that has been made for one purpose--to get you drunk. Appearence is what you'd expect from a cheap lager, and the smell is similar to that of an American malt liquor. I usually give some leniency to third world beers but in this case there is no reason to choose Beer Chang over its drinkable counterparts."
"Best Thai beer I've had, but the competition ain't intense. Still leans toward the ordinary, but it's enjoyable...reminds me more of Carolina Blonde than anything else. Go figure."
"Overall: Keep very far away from this beer. Use only to wash out your mouth after drinking flaming shots of Mekong..."
"As previously stated, the main benefits of this beer are price and alcohol content. Deffinitely give it a try when in Thailand, but don't be bothered to pay the export import price unless you're looking for an exotic change from your regular Mickey's."
"Very pale straw hued, with a short-lived white beer head and a moderately carbonated body. The nose is pretty modest, if anything, with some malts and corn-like grainy smell, very faint trace of lemony hops. The palate is the same, sharply gassy upfront, then thin-bodied flavour of some sweet grains and sugars, but turning more and more watery as it goes... almost like a lemonade without the lemony edge!!! Finished with less sugary touch than its previous version (6.4%) but still a bit sticky on the palate. Overall, it has all the cheap and overly light texture I haven't confronted for a long long time, and even its predecessor tastes better than this one. One of the worst beers I've had, and not as a result of mis-handling or any ""excusable"" factors I believe. Not recommended at all."
"The pour clear light golden amber color, the head adequate as is the lace, both bright white in color, malt nose, somewhat crisp and fresh. Start malt, the top cadaverous, finish bitingly acidic, the hops pertinent to the style, dry lingering aftertaste, beats ""Water", but just barely."
