When I can find it, and that's not very often, I drink it because of the nostalgia effect. I put on some Jerry Jeff , close my eyes and imagine myself 40 years younger driving my 56 Chevy Sedan Delivery around Texas listening to AM radio and going into Austin on occasion to hear some good music at the Armadillo.

Take your average beer and then mix it 50/50 with water and there you have it: Lone Star beer. I could not even finish 1/4 of the bottle and not wanting the waitress to get offended, I poured most of it on my 12 dozen finished oyster shells and leftover bread to look like I at least drank most of it. Would I drink this if there was nothing else? Sure, but this stuff is not really good at all.","Richardbeerlover","Aug 02, 2014"

Even though I'm a beer snob, I still have a soft spot for an easy drinking american lager. This one fits the bill perfectly. Way underrated.

I had listened to Texas musicians and others praise this stuff for so long I had made it a point to try at some time in my life, I did not realize it would be yesterday. Sometimes when you are not looking for something it just appears. Anyway, this beer was alright nothing to sing about, even though people have. This is more a novelty to me, but overall had it been the middle of summer and I was going to listen to some Texas troubadour sing about it it would fit the bill rather well. Anyway to the review, it smelled sweet and grainy and when I poured it in the glass it was a very pale yellow, almost colorless really. The taste did have a bite to it that I wasn't expecting but overall not bad, I could see myself drinking a few of these on a hot summer day while grilling out and listening to some good tunes. Like I said before it is what it is but Lone Star had a certain appeal which precipitated the purchase.","humuloner22","Mar 03, 2013"

Brewed by the same folks that bring us pabst & stroh's, there isn't much more to expect. Its a straw colored lager that for me poured clear gold with a nice white head that laced all glass long. I thought the body was alittle fuller than the pabst. The aroma was grassy, the taste grainy and malt with very little hop to balance. It is drinkable because there isn't nothing big about this Texan. Picked it up vacation because it had that Texas only thing going for it.","chilidog","Aug 24, 2003"
2.1,-14.6,2,2,2,2,2.5,"This beer pours an ultra-clear pale straw color with nearly no head to speak of. There is a massive amount of carb action racing to the top, but still no head. It has a sweet corn and a fresh-cut grass smell to it. The top of the taste is a carb bite that nearly burns like a Coke product and has a twangy lemon and earthy grain taste with hops nearly being uninvited to this ill-fated party. It is thin and watery and aside from that carb bite, it has no character. Could have been an easier drinking swill, but the bite burns so it takes away from the only thing this beer could have had going for it. Im embarrassed that this is called what it is. Cheers anyways!","BeerAngel","Jul 25, 2003"
2.55,3.7,2,2,3,2.5,2.5,"Cheap beer meant to cool you down on a hot day. But, for it's price, I like it. In University, their was a roommate who watched ths weid show called Hot Springs Hotel. Mainly, Baywatch with nudity. Anyways, all the girls were drinking this. Funny how the mind works. I tasted this beer and thought of that stupid show. Now for the actual rating, instead of rambling. As a note, this is the Sleeman brew. Poured out a very faint, yellow colour. Kind of like sand. The head was about 1/2 and lasted, but was grey. A grey head is a turn off, especially considering I've never seen beer foam that shade of grey before. Light barley husk smell. That's it. Tasted a little sweet, malt and corn adjunct evident. But, it wasn't too artificial. Little mouthfeel and drinkable for what it is. Basically, swill. Tolerable swill, perhaps even good swill, but swill nonetheless. A lawnmower beer.","slitherySOB","Jul 16, 2003"

The seltzery texture is hardly distinguishable from the hop taste. Am I tasting hops or seltzer? Weak, dry and stale tasting with an odd stale aroma. The head disappears as quickly as the flavor. I don't think the defenders of the Alamo would approve. Prime example of Cheap Beer!","BeerResearcher","Mar 26, 2003"

On a recent visit to the northern suburbs of Houston I was forced to drink many a bad beer, this one included. The choices were the usual national macro swill and local macro swill. I went local but gained nothing for the experience. The same yellow fizzy crap that I associate with AB, Miller and Coors. Utterly lacking in taste and character.

Texas is damn hot, so I take it that this beer is supposed to be served ice-cold to cool you down. This beer is made to do one thing: cool you off.
