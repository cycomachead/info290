"My favorite beer to drink with some mariscos on a hot day bumping some corridos con Mi gente ahuevo!!!saludos.."
""
""
"O: well, it’s at least as good as Corona and better than some light beers."
""
""
""
"Blah - not overtly offensive (I can see certain climate and cuisine situations where this would, um, 'work'), but not really enjoyable in the least when held up on its own.  Cheap, plain, and boring, beyond the cutesy squat bottle, but we all knew that coming in."
"I like it if I have to drink a beer of this nature"
""
"This is my favorite beer to drink while floating the river in 95+ degree heat. Tastes great with lime/beer salt and isn't much more expensive than the traditional American macro lagers in Texas. Great session beer if you're sweating."
""
""
"had bottle with dinner, hit the spot with burritos."
"Very drinkable lager. Good with dinner or a hot day."
""
""
""

""
"Served in a Mug"

"2.24/5: This would actually be half-decent in (skunk-proof) cans!"
"Good beer for me, drink it often when i need to quench my thirst. Not one of my favorites but definitely my go to beer when i need one."
"Best Mexican beer out there."
"It's a decent mexican beer. DosXX is Prolly my favorite mexican beer as of 2/23/15"
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice mexican lager that avoids skunkiness being in a can, not bad."
""
""
""
"This beer is really good."
""
"I got this at my local Tex Mex joint as a change of pace, I guess.  What I got, of course, was a fairly mediocre, slightly below average adjunct lager.  It's not a horrible beer, but it's not good either.  It ranks with Corona."
""
""
""
""
"This is a true barley pop, true to adjunct lager."
"Nice pale lager thats better on draught."
""
""
""
"No thank you, water will do just fine."
"DATE TASTED: January 25, 2015... GLASSWARE: 22 oz. pilsner... OCCASION: celebrating a rather easy Cavs win over the Thunder... APPEARANCE: clear copper body; pours a rashly fizzing head that comes to nothing quickly; a solitary bubble ascends; no lacing... AROMA: sweet, syrupy malts are front and center; biscuit and bread suggest a standard premium pilsener... PALATE: soft, apologetic and thin--drinkable but fizzy...TASTE: candied caramel malts and oats combine with some flowery hints to create a below-average, pitchy flavor...OVERALL: the can suggests it is the Mexican Miller, and not much in the can suggests the contrary; a good beer to finish the night with, when other quality beers have already been quaffed; as a sessional, meh...as a study, a fast, unrewarding one..."
""
"Overall this is a good beer. It's bottle and packaging definitely out do the taste but it's better than holding a Corona with the hipsters."

""
"Pints at El Norteno in Winter Haven with chicken fajitas."
""
""
""
"O: Overall it is a pretty simple brew..  easy drinking, crisp, and fairly unoffensive.  Decent for beer you don't want to think about.  Add some fresh lime juice and sea salt, and boom!"
""
"felt like a mexican pbr"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not great, but a lot more accessible and drinkable than most AAL's."
"Can poured into a standard pint glass somewhere in Mexico (actually in Cabo San Lucas but whatever). A dark than expected orange-yellow with a light dappling of white bubbles rimming the glass. Aroma is slightly astringent and grainy, with an overarching corn sweetness. I was actually pleasantly surprised with the taste, perhaps because the expectancy bar was set appropriately low. There is a subtle buttery raisin note in there, along with a watermelon rind-like element (noble hops? ... Whoa...). Almost like a drastically watered-down Oktoberfest and distinct from other Mexican mainstream adjunct lagers in this regard. The expected corn sweetness is of course still present. Obviously its thin and watery, but there are at least some other low key flavors to note here. Perhaps I am guilty of overstating the case. At least this is almost as available as Corona and Pacifico in these parts."
"Gold in color with a fingernail of white head around the rim and a bit in the middle.  Some light lacing in the glass.  I smell corn and perhaps some German bittering hops.  The taste is corn and well water like lager yeast.  The bittering hops also do show in the fade.  The body is thin and nearly flat."
"would buy again.  for qty, not savory."

"Pours a nice golden color but that's about all it has going for it.  Smell and flavor are typical for an AAL with adjuncts dominating. The carbonation is weak and it flattens quickly.  Only got it at a Tex-Mex restaurant because it was a ""Happy Hour"" Special.  There are far better choices in Mexican beers."

"This really isn't bad. I've liked negra modelo since I started drinking beer, but never had modelo especial until recently. Very big on the malt flavor and very ""mexican"" in taste, in that it tastes like many other mexican brews. A friend handed me one of these, and while I probably wouldn't pay for a six pack myself, I'd definitely have this one again."

"This was my drink of choice while in Mexico. Had a nice flavor and not just water. Now and again I will pick up a 6 pack"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Modelo Especial has a smooth flavour of beer with medium hops.  No bitterness within Modelo Especial.  Medium foam is a characteristic of Modelo Especial.  Carbonation disappears quickly within Modelo Especial.  I am the person who posted the photo of Modelo Especial."
""
""
""
"Overall (3.12) : Again, this beer is leagues better than Corona Extra. I don't even want to look at a Corona again. Modelo Especial is still pretty terrible, but drinkable. If someone showed up to a party with Modelo, or if it was in a cooler full of macro light lagers, I'd take this in a second. If there were anything else that was in the running however, I would leave it chilling in the icebox. I hope that makes sense. I'll pass on this brew next time."
""

""

"Well, what can I say. Some drunk left behind a  can of this so I put it my fridge until the moment when it was all I had. I really hadn't tasted beer like this for a long, long time. Back in the day you could buy a six pack of Red White and Blue for maybe two bucks. Or some dive might have pitcher night or something. If you were to overhear a party discussing this beer and one said ""Taste like piss"" his mate would probably just retort ""How would you know?", but nobody would disagree.  Where you might expect the taste of hops you are met witht he taste of what? is it vinegar? Smells like something  in a photography darkroom - fixer, I guess. Also, has that 'left out all night' quality that I recall from days past. In the same way that old coffee is 'off', so is this, fresh from the can. I commend the brewers for their disdain of humanity and their apparent commercial success is converting Mexican wastewater (I guess that would explain it) into a viable commercial product. Packs a kick too - which would help with the prospect of downing a second one.  I'll give this 1.25 (not 1.0)  just so that I can reserve a place for a beer that might be even more repugnant."

"Decided to drink this for Cinco de mayo. Poured into a glass. You instantly smell skunk. Eww. Almost no head. Tastes a lot better than it smells. Just a sweet corn blah taste. Will be adding some lime wedges to help make it through my 3 bottles."

"Modelo Especial brewed by Grupo Modelo S.A. de C.V. with an ABV of 4.4% This brew pours out a dark amber color with a white head. Modelo is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell is rich with grans and some bitterness. This for the most part looks and smells like an American Lager. The taste is bold but light. I'm not picking up on the bitterness of this brew. You pick up on some grains but not much. Modelo Especial has a smooth clean finish to it. Almost like a light american style beer. There is not much else to say. this is a good drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. This beer is better in a can. I would get this brew again."

"O - Fairly standard for the style, but I seriously questioned whether or not I was looking at a beer and not some kind of colored soda water when it first arrived at my table. I don't plan to order this again."

"Overall there is not much to rave about, but there is even less to complain about. I think this beer is better quite cold. If you think you might like it, you probably will."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden color with a very small white head but leaves some light spotty lacing when sipped. The aroma is nothing special, just some grains but a little on the 'skunky side'. The taste is better than the smell with no bitterness actually like I would expect. Taste of some grains and malt but nothing that stands out. Overall it was OK and I like their dark beer much better."

""

""
"Overall: I found this beer pleasant on a hot summer day. It is nothing outstanding, but neither is it offensive. Very drinkable with no off flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Has the flavor of a semi-sweet adjunct lager with a minor-league hop note. Traces of mintiness mixed with musty grains and a basic crisp nature; it all offers relief. A little corny, but forgiving. Fizzy, but diffuse. Really, a more refined approach to Mexican swill lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel is better than what most of this style have to offer, light-bodied without being terribly watery, a bit thin but not as much as most. It's got plenty of crispness and it actually gets pretty smooth. That it's pretty clean is also a plus."

"Edit: 5-22-14- I tried another tallboy of this while doing some yard work and getting up a good sweat. I got a little more head from the beer this time and the skunk is hardly noticeable. Not a bad lager at all, and I've amended my score to the high side of ""OK""."

"I'm into darker beers now.. But I remember when I liked this beer a lot... But only in bottles (I don't drink cans). There isn't a lot of flavor or even anything really special about this beer, but some people don't like a strong tasting beer, this is good for them. I noticed it has lower ratings here which I can understand if you don't like this type of beer, but for a lot of people this is a perfectly good beer, with plenty of flavor and is better than corona or a lot of the other Mexican beers... But like I said... Drink the bottles, not the cans. If you drink from cans you probably shouldn't be reviewing beers lol..."

"O-This beer needs a complete overhaul. The color is see-thru and a tad pissy. The head is awful. The smell is hardly there. This is one of the better tasting adjuncts though, with enough sweet and bitter notes for even vet craft drinkers. But anemic and weak albeit. Golden water. If there are no tastes to speak of, they might be in the aftertastes, which are sadly stronger than the brew. The epitome of beer breath: grainy, malty and skunky. The carbonation is well attenuated and present, (above average). But when it's all said and done, this is a beer that you have to BURP to get a stronger taste. I have to keep the brew in my mouth and swish to even pick out any flavors. Not the wateriest beer but still watery. Drink Modelo Especial in the bottle to retain and compact the smells and flavors, (the little there are)."
"This beer has an odd chemical flavor. I don't like it. It has a lot of potential. But the odd flavor and artificial feeling dryness ruin it. It is a good looking darker pale lager. There is decent malt character to this beer. But overall its just an okay beer at best."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer if you're looking to get more quantity for what you normally would pay for. Overall, with a few friends around to pass the time, I'd down these to share some good times. Not the best of Mexican beers i have had, but it would do fine in a pinch. I will say this, however, I would be interested to try it out of a bottle. I think this idea of cans being a way to deliver beers to consumer is bogus (personal opinion, of course.)"

"The taste had some cereal malt flavors with a tinge of corn. Tepid flavoring along with a tepid body or feel leaves me relatively flat on this Mexican lager."

"Poured a clear golden color with no head. Standard, but not horrible. Scents of maize, lager yeast and malt. Standard for an American Adjunct Lager. Flavor is mild, beginning with malt, maize and lager yeast, these flavors stay throughout, with a mild hop bitterness showing up in the middle and lingering on the aftertaste, with a bit of a metallic twinge, but not a lot. It's pretty good, mild but refreshing, with a higher hop character than some AALs I've had, and a decent malt and adjunct flavor. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Yet again standard for the style. Overall, when rated to it's style, this is a good beer. It has more flavor than many domestic options and has little of the offensive flavors other Mexican lagers can sometimes have. If it's one's only option for a lager, for instance at a Mexican restaurant, or you want a decent, inexpensive lawnmower lager, this is a good choice."

"Overall a pretty decent macro lager."
""
"Logged from notes. This brew was consumed during my Mexico in October of 2011. Pours a pale fizzy yellow with a quickly dissipating head. The nose has musty corn notes along with bread and zero hops. Not very pleasant. The taste is nearly flavorless aside from some faint corn paired with metallic flavors. A mild sweetness is present at the finish, but mainly just watery. Mouthfeel is light, fizzy, and a bit sharp. Overall, this is below average even for an AAL."

"Pours a clear yellow, golden color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are very minimal.  Yeasty, sour fruit type aroma.  Nothing much to the taste.    Slight caramel up front with a slight bitter finish.  The sour fruit notes come out in the aftertaste.  Not a bad beer.  There is a decent bitter finish.  Would drink if no craft beers available."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 24 ounce can into a liter mug. The beer pours clear golden with a frothy white head. There are lots of visible tiny bubbles in the glass. The beer smells like grain husks with some sweetness. It has the classic American lager aroma. What you get in the flavor is a very straightforward pale lager. You get the flavor of the barley malt, but there aren't a lot of hop notes here. They weren't strong in the aroma, but there is some minor back end bitterness. The body is light with strong carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. This beer is highly drinkable. This is a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"No nasty flavors and easy drinkability don't make this a great beer, but it seems to be hitting the hallmarks of the style pretty well. For the record, my g/f ordered this for me while I was in the restroom. Otherwise, this never would have happened!"

"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a Sam Adams glass. This review is for with and without lime added. Pours a nice medium gold color but with almost no head. No lacing. Aroma is slightly sweet, with a hint of bread. After adding lime, it smells much more citrusy. Go figure. Taste is almost non-existent, with very little by way of malt, hops, or anything else. With no lime, there is almost no flavor and I now understand why it comes with lime. Even lime doesn't really bring much to the party. But it IS better. Has a decent mouthfeel, smooth with a hint of carbonation. It does do well with spicy Mexican food when served with a lime, so it's got that going for it."

"Worst than most macro lagers. AVOID!"

"Overall: Probably my favorite maco Mexican beer, which might not be saying much, but it's still decent."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and isn't really that bad when compared to other beers in the style."
"Its way better then corona, tecate just to name a few mexican brews"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. It is pretty bland beer. This beer is price at the high end price range Going for one looar a beeer. Icehouse, natural ice, pbr, coors are lots better options for a cheaper price. I would choose Corona or Lecate over this beer."
""
""
"Overall - It's drinkable, but 98% of the beers out there fit that mold. Not something I'd care to purchase, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered. Inoffensive; the kind of beer you drink to catch a buzz. It's certainly not for the enjoyment of great taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with bland flavors and aromas. I'd take a Dos Equis over this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-I had no expectations when I bought this. It surprised me more than I thought it would. It wasn't spectacular, and in fact, it was quite average. It's just a good way to wash down spicy food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is to be enjoyed at the pool or on the beach... or maybe just on a hot day. Other than that I dont advise this beer. It is something only to be enjoyed when its a perfect day out. Also i advise drinking it out of the bottle rather than the can, the can for this beer does not do it justice. Especially how the bottle's cap is wrapped in gold paper."
""

"The taste has this bready malt forward note with a clean hop finish. It does what it is supposed to do."

"O: it is one of the best Mexican bears, hands down. This is what I prefer when I'm in Cabo.Corona is made at the same brewery but I think it is sub par to this."
""
""
"Golden body with a fleeting white head. Pretty standard Mexican lager aroma: mildly sulfuric lager yeast, pale malt sweetness, slight DMS. Not much else to it. It's reasonably clean and doesn't offend. Tastes more or less the same. Pretty clean fermentation aside from a bit of DMS. Slightly metallic, with a pale malt sweetness and a touch of sweet corn. Not much bitterness to the finish. Not an offensive beer by any means, and it's good for washing down spicy Mexican food."

"If you like mexican beers, this is a fantastic, light mexican brew. Would strongly recommend to anyone. The second I open this beer it reminds me of the Cancun sun. If you dont like this beer, then you just dont appreciate the flavor a mexican beer. Viva Mexico, Viva Modelo"

""

"thought i would go out of my normal habits(checking beer advocate before buying.) when i created this mix six. clear straw yellow with a head that goes away in a instant. aroma is a blend of corn and malt . taste and mouth feel would seem like a great summer beer due to it crisp flavor and clean finish. next time i am out at a local Mexican restaurant i will have to see it this is on the menu , would love to pair it with a well crafted mexican meal"
""
""

"O: not bad for a typical light lager, but too exepensive in america, though it's much cheaper in mexico; it's a good canoe beer (when you flip the canoe over, it's not a huge loss!)"

"Not much here to speak of. A medium golden color with little to no carbonation. I poured into a pint glass to review the head. I looked away for 3-5 seconds and the head was gone! Aroma was a light malt. Taste was again a slight malt that left nothing on the palate. The finish was average. Overall, too watered down to give much consideration. Overpriced for the taste and quality. For a summer grilling, I'd get more from a PBR at half the cost."
"Overall: I'd take this over Corona any day, but nothing too impressive here."

"Meh - a fairly typical mass-produced adjunct lager. Bland and insubstantial. Drinkable enough if cold refreshment is desired - aims low and hits the target. No need to seek it out."

"355ml bottle (7500-1894 bar code) Lager glass. (From my notes). Golden color, clear appearance.White froth, brief crown. Grainy, slightly corny aromas with grassy touch & light apple notes to the nose. Flavors are as expected from aromas. Subtle sweet sensation & no bitterness. Light body. Medium to high & lively carbonation. Watery texture. Crisp & refreshing. Better served cold."

"Overall, even though I could give this beer all 1's for ratings, it's a good canned grilling beer. Not the best Mexican lager either, but sort of a sentimental class for me. Better than BMC, but not as good as Euro lagers. Meh."

"this is a terrible beer, stright up. pours watery pee color with a one inch white... wait, nope, the head is already gone. smells like the can, corn syrupy, metallic, watery malt. flavor isnt much better, has a strange almost chemically flavor that also sits weird in the gut. no flavors of normal beer ingredients at all. feel is semi-redeeming here, light and bubbly, but still too watered down to be of much use. if it was on the verge of frozen it might refresh to some extent, but this is a rotten can of beer. nothing like the other modelo products ive had, which arent bad mexican lagers."
"Overall - While this is not the beer I would chose if I was stuck on a deserted isle & only got one more beer to drink for the rest of my eternity (Schneiderweiss-Nelson), I will happily put a few back while munching on tongue tacos. Thank the land for German brewers migrating to Mexico!"
"Overall - This is a take it or leave it beer. Fine if offered. Not worth going out of way to find. Take anything from a gas station and you'll be in just as good as this. I don't feel very mexican or tropical vibe drinking it either."
""

"Smell was faint cooked corn, grains, biscuit. Taste quite similar with adjunct qualities apparent, corn, cereal grain. Medium light body with strong carbonation. Finishes clean. Nothing here to get excited about, nothing off-putting, a middle of the road adjunct lager."
""
""
"O - You could tell me this is a Budweiser, and I wouldn't know the difference."

"This is an alright adjunct lager, not very complex but still tasty and refreshing. I recommend if your in Mexico or its over 30C."

"This pours real easily with a crayon golden-yellow color and a lot of fizzy foam that disappears in an instant. The aroma even when fresh is musty, like your typical corn adjunct lager. Flavor? What flavor? Any flavor to speak of is a light, light sweet corn malt lager that rapidly fades. A bit smoother than I expected. Still, no reason to drink unless its free—and even at that…"

"o - Overall not a great beer but a much better alternative for Mexican beer than Corona and Corona light. I like the normal Negro Modelo better than this, though this is a lighter beer. Not bad but a bit bland. Not worth seeking out but worked with some Mexican food and would go to over the Corona's."

"Clean, dry and crisp body. A little heavier than most adjunct lager."

"Deep golden yellow colour with one finger headthat quickly dissolved. Minimal amount of bubbles rising to the surface.Nothing distinguishable on the aroma. Slighty bitter taste with some traces of lime (?).Thin body and slighty carbonated."

"Sexy can. Nice rich golden appearance. Vanishing head. It smells like an adjunct lager; maybe grain and tin bubbles is the way to say it. Modelo Especial tastes like all the rest. I've only had one adjunct that tastes different, Landshark, and that's just because of the added sugar (which doesn't improve that particular brew all too much). Modelo is just a good standard example of the style, with little discernible hop flavor, not very malty, plenty of rice, or corn, neither of which has anything remarkably distinctive to add. Still, I like this beer plenty enough for what it is. Goes pretty good with a burrito."
"Easy to drink beer that isn't bad or good. I was dissapointed because I expected much more taste. I was a marketing hype victim. Call the police."
"O - Yet another easy drinking, but flavourless ale that serves well to satisfy your thirst but will certainly not satisfy a craving for flavour."

"We ate dinner last night at the new Lone Star Taco Bar last night, and I noticed they had Modelo on draft. I don't think I've ever had a Mexican beer of this kind on tap, so I ordered one. Served in a Modelo branded glass. Darker color that I could recall, but no head whatsoever. Smell was like all other adjunct lagers - all rice. Taste actually wasn't that bad, maybe because it was on draft. Regardless, it was a pretty smooth tasting lager. Mouthfeel was on the watery side, but it went down easy. Not a bad pint for $4 with a plate of gourmet tacos. Way better than other south-of-the-border beers in a bottle."

"This beer is nothing horrible by any means. A step up from the everyday maybe, but nothing more than another Corona. I call this an alternative to Corona when someone wants a variety. The smell is almost identical and the taste is quite similar along with the color and consistency. One that is worth trying for the money but nothing special by any stretch of the imagination."

"O - In terms of American adjunct lagers this one is towards the top I think. It is superior to all light beers on the market in terms of flavor. Don't get super excited to drink this beer, but when you are going out fishing or watching football all day, this is a good go to beer."

"O: It works. Not much else to it."
"Just buy Keystone if you want something light and cheap"
"Overall pretty good but nothing crazy exciting."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 1 inch puffy white head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this beer on the drink down. Smell is of grain/corn and some fruity notes. Taste is of grains and corn with some pretty good fruity flavors. A mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp and clean mouthfeel with a pretty good level of carbonation. Overall, this is a pretty average beer but not that bad all around compared to other stuff on the market."
"Overall-It's alright, I would prefer this over a lot of other adjuncts."
"Taste is lacking but inoffensive. Nice crisp finish. I've taken a liking to Modelo as a go-to beer for cookouts and other outdoor activities. Clearly better then the Buds and Coors of the world."
"Thin straw colored pour, no head or lacing to speak of. The nose is underwhelming a little corn and cereal scents, better than you’d expect from a canned beer. Flavor is mixed cereal, grains corn etc. nothing great but certainly not offensive. Thin mouthfeel, seltzer texture, which is to be expected from a macro. Overall its good for an American macro but nothing special, good for a day at the beach."
"Ice cold from the can a little after 11 during my summer league softball game (so I have no idea what it looked like, although I could probably hazard a guess). Aromas of straw, graininess, light citrus and a hint of skunk. Palate was light bodied and crisp. Flavors of light straw, light graininess and hint of citrus with a crisp clean finish."
"Easy drinking beer that screams pool or beach."
"O: I will never buy this except during happy hour on Taco Tuesday. I have to admit, I don't hate it."
"A clear golden amber in appearance with a thin off white head. Smells vaguely of cereal grains. Taste is a hint of fresh lager yeast, followed by some sweet bread. A hint of bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, high carbonation. Overall decent, I've had a lot worse."
"O: This is a little bit better than most adjuncts I have had."
"Overall - this beer smells a lot better than it tastes."
"O - A good beer for when you just want a plain beer"
"Just got done mowing the lawn and I figured it was the best time to try the Modelo Especial...and I was probably right. The appearance is Golden clear color with dissipating carbonation and head. The smell is semi-sweet with grain and alcohol undertones. The taste is typical of most beers in this genre and is fairly smooth. I don't mind it but if there was something else more interesting I would take that."
"Let's be honest: this is a Mexican Pilsner Beer. If you judge it as such, it is a perfect example. Light, Crisp, Refreshing and Portable!"
"Mediocre, forgettable."
"T: Pretty smooth with some light pale malt flavor and a bit of a hop sourness. Went well with some chicken tacos."
"Cheers."
"Modelo especial pours a crystal clear lightish gold with almost no head. The aroma is mildly sweet and grainy. The flavor is pretty much the same, no off flavors to speak of, but nothing really interesting going on either. Overall there is nothing wrong with the beer, but thats the best I can really say about it."
"O - i'd rather have something else to wash down mexican food, i couldn't get over the strange chemical flavor."
"Was left in my fridge after a party, otherwise I would never consider purchasing. However, after drinking it, I plan on buying myself a pack on occassion. It poured a head of foam that vanished fairly quickly on top of the lightly colored liquid. I have never really enjoyed a Corona which made me skeptical of this taste, but I very much enjoyed it. It felt good from the start to the finish."
"The taste is better than I remember, but that may be because I had a Corona earlier and I am simply relieved that this is less terrible. The taste is starchy, but also has some minor grain flavour. Not much. It's bland, but palatable. That's about it."
"This is the best Mexican beer hands down. It's best from a bottle but then you risk it being spoiled and it has that foil around the top. Appearance and smell is very typical of a Mexican lager but the taste is much better. The mouthfeel is much more substantial. It's tastes like it has a bit of honey in it. This the perfect beer for drinking outside in the summer or on a beach in Mexico."
"O - middle of the road beer that's ok for washing down Taco Bell."
"Overall it's a stupidly low abv easy drinking but incredibly bubblegum beer with sweetness like candy. Easy lawnmower beer if that's your thing."
"overall, as far as adjunct lagers go you could do a lot worse. not doing a whole lot for me, but it's not bothering me either. it's even a bit refreshing. definitely beats corona, i'll give it that."
"O: Very easily drinkable. Solid example in an ordinary style - credit to eliminate any off-flavors in a beer this light."
"Was served this Adjunct Lager on tap at a Mexican Festival. Poured into a clear plastic cup. This lager pours a clear golden color and makes a foamy head with very below average retention. This beer left behind no lacing. The aroma was typical of a mexican style lager, dominated by grain and grass. The taste had slight hints of grain, it was very sweet and it had almost no hop bitterness. Light in body, this beer is better than Corona. I guess I would have to say slightly above average for an adjunct lager. Im sure it would go good with a Keso Dilla."
"Light watery body, high carbonation, prickly and abrasive on the tongue. I suppose this drinks quickly but the flavor isn't great for an adjunct. I'd take a Pabst or Bud over this any day."
"RJT"
"Essentially, has no redeeming values. Right up there with the worst beers ever."
"O: Not terrible, but nothing really going on either. Have no problem drinking it on a hot day or when relaxing at a BBQ or a random Mexican night. For an american adjunct, its just fine."
"I'll skip all the usual adjunct lager talk and go straight to the point; Modelo is a great beer for certain occasions. It is the smoothest of all the Mexican brews that go with lime and is very quenching after a long hot day. It's not a brewing masterpiece, but hits the spot when the occasional craving arrives."
"O - I was inclined to purchase this beer because my fiancee said she had tried it and liked it ... first time she'd said that about any beer. Perhaps I'll be able to swing her to enjoy something better than this."
"Served in a can that was stocked in our rooms while we visited the Mayan Riviera in Mexico. I was forced to drink out of the on the rocks glasses that they provide in hotel rooms. Pours a pale, hazy, piss-gold color with a thin film of bubbly head. Lots of carbonation. Lots. The smell is a little watery, but roast and toasty cereal, mostly. The flavors are limited, at best. Roasted malt with a musty, almost stale aftertaste. The finish is crisp and dry, but again, still stale, and the mustiness continues to overpower. Bleh...but they fill the fridge with 6 ""fresh"" ones every day, so I will continue to drink. Not the worst thing to have handy when it's still 94 degrees out at 10pm!"
"Poured from a 24oz can into a Duvel tulip. Looks to be a dark golden straw color. Its white head is fizzy and unremarkable. Its gone right quick and in a hurry. Very light corn smell even in the tulip. A little sweet, mild corn, light grains. Bland. Mouth feel seems to be what it should be for this sort of thing. a little under par. Pretty light in flavor and aromatics even for an AAL."
"Overall-bland and normal for the genre, nothing that should ever be sough out. Not the worst mass-adjunct lager but that is certainly not high praise."
"Tasty crisp Mexican beer."
" The taste is decent, not the kind of beer that will make you shout EUREKA! and dance on the bar, but a solid flavor of lighter malt with a nice accent of light hops w/ a smoothness you expect from a lager, mostly crisp, but has a gentle corny accent which is familiar if you have had this style before. I consider this a pretty decent example of the style and not a bad choice when noshing on ribs or other grease laden fare. I found this to be refreshing and it satisfied my craving for a second beer without weighing me done or making me feel bloated like some overly gassy adjunct lagers have a tendency to do and I like the fact you can actually taste the malt, not just a seltzer lager flavor."
"The flavour I find less pleasing. No malts or hops that I can discern, pure corn and an odd corn syrupy sweetness with a bitter finish. Not well balanced, and not the ""premium"" Modelo brand I'd expected."
"Another light Mexican offering during this Cinco de Mayo tasting. It pours a clear sallow topped by a finger of short-lived white foam. The nose comprises rice, light sweetness (a very vague example of the phenomenon), bad wheat, and burnt puffed rice. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a healthy dose of hard water. The body is rather light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a kinda pitiful brew, one I can't see ever drinking again voluntarily."
"Drink- Its for Cinco de mayo. Never again. Not as bad as some AAL but close. This is another watered down beer substitute."
"D: for what it is, not a bad example. in my grocery store it's the same price as corona and a better mexican lager in my opinion as well. hooray 24oz cans."
"Why? Seriously why? Do my friends think this is classy or something? Never again"
"Pours a small one finger white head that I can head fizzing away, which is not good, the body is a dark yellow color, with medium carbonation and almost 100% transparent, but not completely. Here are my first thoughts, the head is gone, and I can tell I'm not going to get much lacing, so that's bad. But on the other hand there isn't a crap load of carbonation and the color isn't as light yellow as most of the adjunct lagers I've had, so that kinda offsets things a little bit. The smell is a little hoppy and a little malty, frankly it smells a little skunky, but maybe that's just the hops, because it's in a can so theres no way it's skunky. I mean overall the smell is very faint, and not very strong, but what I can smell I like, it smells like it has some taste to it, so not bad on the smell for an adjunct lager. Extremely watery on the taste, like WOW, super watery, I was expecting much more flavor out of that smell. I'm for sure getting a metallic flavor and a almost a cough syrup taste mixed in with the low carbonation. The taste is not very good at all, I'm really not getting any hops or malts either here. It really just tastes like metallicy cough syrupy water. On second thought, there might be a small small hop bite in here somewhere. The only two things I can think so say that are good about the taste are the small hop bite and the fact that it's not skunky like I thought it might be on the smell. I was really expecting more flavor from this beer, but it's falling very short, even for an adjunct lager. The mouthfeel is ok, not terrible, medium carbonation, but frankly it could actually use a bit more carbonation because the flavor isn't all that great. Drinkability is considerably low considering it's an adjunct lager. Overall on this beer, way worse than I was expecting, and I wasn't expecting all that much from it, being an adjunct lager. I have absolutely no idea how the bros give this a B-. There are a few things I like about it, but very few, mostly this beer is not very good at all."
"Absolutely horrendously priced at $7.49 a 6 pack. I have no idea what that would pay for, maybe they have some big soccer advertising bills to pay or something."
"O: Aspires to be average, but doesn't quite make it. Okay if there's nothing else to be found. Not at all especial."
"One of the top beers for its style. Smooth and easy drinking, plus it smells good."
"Another one on the Old Chicago Mini Tour. Poured a see-through yellow with very little head that disapated quickly. NO aroma; taste was too sweet of malt, corn, and no hop bitterness at all. Another one that's not offensieve but little there in the way of taste."
"Has a typical lager color and smell when poured. Lot's of nice bubbles coming up from the bottom. Tastes like Corona! Not too malty or hoppy. The corn in it is evident, but doesn't make it bad. I thought this beer was very refreshing. Not something I would drink often, but not bad once in awhile. Might be good on a boat or mowing the lawn."
"Watery, light bodied, medium effervescence. Aftertaste is nicely balanced between malt and hops. Slightly better than a BudMillerCoors but getting past the nose is not easy. I'd pass on another."
"All around mediocre."
"Drinkability - I think this is a very drinkable beer and is better than most if not all American macro lagers."
"O: As with so many of these beers, this really isn't that bad, but it's just not all that flavorful or interesting. It just doesn't make me want to drink it again."
"Nothing overly impressive here. The beer was a yellowish golden color with a little bit of head that lasted until you take your first sip then it disappears. There isn't much of anything to say. It smells of malts not much hop aroma. You can probably avoid this beer is you're looking for something more exotic."
"Overall, not bad, it will be my pool beer this summer, in the can, not the bottle."
"Clear pale to deep gold body, 1/2 inch head which quickly dissipated to a ring around the top. Looked almost flat, with very few bubbles rising to the top. Lacing was average. Taste was very light with almost no finish. Watery, soft mouthfeel. Not impressed, almost like drinking a light beer."
"Nothing ""Especial"" about this one. Negra Modelo is far better."
"Pretty blah stuff. I used to believe this was among the best Mexican beers, but it's clear Negra Modelo is the superior beer between the Modelo's."
"Pours a white one finger head that vanishes almost instantly. Right away I can smell skunkiness, and my face is nowhere near the bottle. I hope this isn't a bad bottle. Tastes like lime and corn. Mouthfeel is sticky and unenjoyable, especially since the limey-ness of the flavor suggests it should be more refreshing in the mouth. Would not go out of my way to drink this again, aside from trying it on tap or a bottle I know for sure is fresh to see if I just got a bad bottle. It's really unfortunate when the best feature about a beer is the bottle it comes in. I guess the foil top got my hopes up."
"But I tried all of the mexican pils and this one was closer to the bottom of the list than the top."
"Pours a clear yellowish color with a thick yellowish white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of corn, grain, and a little sweetness. Tastes of sweet corn, bread, and a little grain. Mouthfeel is light with a heavy carbonation. Drinkability is okay."
"This pale lager pours a light yellow gold color from a clear 12oz bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is grainy, grassy, corny and sweet. A light bodied pale lager. Malts are mild, cereal and grainy. Hops are slightly bitter and a touch spicy. Lively carbonation. Somewhat metallic tasting and that flavor, sad to say, is the major flavor component to that beer. Sort of like beer flavored water; buy not in a good way. It has no off tastes because it has almost no flavor at all. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"D- Very drinkable lager, great to wash down a meal or to cool off on a hot summer day."
"Taste is similarly nondescript, dry and crackery, seltzery fizz. Vague bitterness in the aftertaste, yet no hop flavor to report. Pretty clean, though there was a faint metallic hint. Factory fresh and utilitarian. Use it to wash down some fiery hot Mexican cuisine, or to cool down after mowing the yard."
"Pale yellow straw golden body with a wispy thin white head. Fine speckled lacing lines the sides of my pint glass. Aroma has cooked veggies/pale malt/corn sweetness. Flavor is sweet with a harsh finish not very crisp alot of DME. Cooked corn/somewhat metallic finish. This is a bad beer but not as bad from the clear bottles with a lime. Straight up from a can this beer is pretty much one of the worst of I've come across. Mouthfeel is fizzy carbonated water texture with nothing redeeming about it. Drinkability sucks, cover it up with lime or just go with Negra Modelo."
"Picked up a single just to try it out, usually I take the Negro version when dining out. Pours a light golden with very little foam/head. No lacing, Smell is usual macro lager malts. Taste is a tad sweet but nothing that jumps out. Mouthfeel is somewhat carbonated and light to medium bodied. Drinkability is fine, nothing wrong with it and certainly great for a beach outing."
"D - it is a good choice if it's on a  bar menu and nothing else stands out. I won't go recommending it to anyone in the beer world, but they will find their way out of my fridge in due time."
"Taste: Sweetish taste that finishes bitter but I get a aftertaste that is not pleasing. Slightly better than many macros out there, especially Corona. It was palatable since it was ice cold but after it warmed up a bit I struggled to finish."
"Drinks: good. easy to drink, better than corona in my personal opinion."
"Drink ice cold and i doubt that you will notice how poor it really is. Yellow color with a white head, this is a macro beer through and through. The nose has a decent power to it though, and as skunky hoppiness that proves that traditional beer ingredients were used in the production of this otherwise charmless carbonated water. More power in the flavor than other of the sort, but avoid unless absolutely necessary."
"I bought a 25oz Foster Premium Ale at the same time and for the same price. World of difference and the Modelo wasn't the better by far."
"Yo no doy un Schlitz sobre esta cerveza."
"Drinkability: A refreshing drink for a hot day. I could drink a few of these."
"D- I could probably drink a whole six pack of this stuff"
"d- fit for a beer bong"
"Drinkability - This is really pretty drinkable. It got better as it went along. It would be fine on a real hot day after some outdoor work. I would choose this over any American ""macro"". I'm glad I tried this. Not too filling and easy going."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a very light yellow color with a lot of visible carbonation. Both the nose and the flavor are seemingly one in the same. Luckily this strays away from a lot of the skunky flavors that plague this style, especially when placed into a clear glass bottle. There is just a touch of light grain husks and not much else. Decent enough brew and definitely better than others from this brewery."
"Just so-so, but went down easy with my chimichanga."
"D- I would never buy this beer. If and only if I had to get something like this I would grab a PBR or a High Life. Better than standard BMC but not by much; I was able to finish it, which is more than I can say about the last Miller Lite I had. The only good things about this beer are, it reminds me why I drink quality craft beer, and it really clears your palate."
"I bought this because I'd gone for Bohemia but they didn't have it. Well, the one good thing about his beer is it had a nice golden color. Otherwise the smell and taste were virtually nil. There's a little corn, that's about it. And the clear glass allows it to get a very subtle skunking about it."
"D - Very light beer for summer thirst quenching but not too enjoyable and not to be consumed in big quantities."
"Notes: Typical for the style and what you would expect from a Mexican beer. Refreshing on a hot day, especially if you are eating at a Mexican restaurant or food. Nothing amazing or worth trying, but fairly refreshing."
"When I opened the bottle I smelled the odour of a barnyard (did I get a bad bottle?). It was very light in colour and there was no head. The taste was better than the smell. It was very weak but drinkable and it felt decent in the mouth. I would drink this stuff if there were no other choices."
"The taste up front is more German with a clear German herbal-pine hop dominance with honey and a faint hint of grain. Light bitterness just dominates the faint grain sweetness. However, the overall character degrades soon, with the hops thinning quickly, becoming more bland with a faint minerally-soapy quality that is just barely noticeable. This does not take over, though or truly ruin it, and it retains a basically good character, just not as good as the beginning. Slightly watery but not terribly. It's drinkable, and retains a stronger character and hop presence and flavour than most such macro lagers."
"lovely at first, starts to get less drinkable as it goes on. We call it the light skinned modelo as opposed to the dark skin brother modelo negro. Its a yellow beer in a clear glass but don't let it fool you, definitely a beer to enjoy food with, made me hungry drinking it."
"D - Best consumed cold. The end of this beer was not as good likely because it had warmed a bit."
"this is not an awful beer, it is an ok lager that is relavitvely unoffensive without the addition of a lime ;)"
"Don't really prefer the chub bottle style. It kind of taste like a watery corona, less carbonation and less style. For the same price, I was not happy to get a crappy corona. There is just nothing distinguishable about the taste of this beer, and it seems a little too light for my taste"
"Overall it could have been worse, but damn, unless it was a smokin hot day and this was all I had I would pass."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is grain and corn. Pretty bland but not skunky like I expected since it came in a clear bottle. The flavor is grain, wheat and grassy hops with a tad bit of lemon. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not great, but compared to a lot of Mexican lagers, this beer is pretty good."
"Has a medium carbonation. Some sweetness as well. Pretty good body for a adjunct lager. the aftertaste start to get to me after a few sips. I suppose this is a pretty decent rendition of the style. A cheap beach brew perhaps."
"Light golden color with heavy carbonation, very little flavor and not much aroma. I won't be buying this again soon."
"Crystal clear gold with a white cap that disappeared quickly, leaving behind a thin collar. Mild aroma, cereal grains, veggies, a bit sulfury and skunky. Light bitterness and malt sweetness, grains, sulfury hops. The finish had a sharp, acrid flavour, a metallic bitterness that did not taste good. Decent texture, moderate carbonation with a light body, crisp and somewhat dry. I'm not a fan of this at all."
"D: I would say this is a semi-drinkable beer, due to the fact that the first half of the taste, tastes like nothing. But the beer will not have me coming back for another taste."
"Mouthfeel is OK. Generous amount of carbonation. Drinkability also OK. Fine under the right circumstances. Otherwise, as I said, adjust your fire."
"I know a lot of people that love this stuff, but I really don't get it. It's a cheap american-style lager with a Mexican name."
"D: Great hot weather session beer when kept at the proper temperature."
"D: for what it is yes i can drink it, will i buy it myself again probably not."
"D: A touch above average across the board. Sort of a slightly robust, somewhat hoppy Mexican macro lager here. Nothing fantastic - there are better beers out there - but there's nothing way off about it either."
"D- Nice Mexican Import beer and a all round good brew."
"Drinkability is decent.. Easy to drink and easily can be a session brew..."
"had this earlier tonight at friends cookout..its an adjunct lager it is what it is..i wont slam it...s it well made for its style..its not one ill buy..but to drink it with ribs and burgers it was good,,i drank 2..so 4 the style modelo is good..BTW i bought some mirror pond,robert the bruce,lift bridge crosscut..it was fun watching my non craft friends drink these"
"carbonation is a bit low, body thin. I guess if I was dying of thirst I'd drink it by the quart...otherwise, no, I'll pass."
"The flavor of this beer was better than expected. Although there were typical grainy corn notes found in adjunct lagers, there was some subtle earthy hops, pale malt and very faint light fruit. Not anything special but betterthan average for the style. Crisp, refreshing and easy to drink. Probably my favorite of the Mexican adjunct lagers(if Negro Modelo doesn't count)."
"D - Well its a Mexican macro beer so its not very drinkable to begin with but this one is really bad had to force this one down to finish my pint not worth getting even just to try it"
"Considering how popular Mexican beers are in the US, I'm amazed more people don't drink this beer. It has more flavor than corona and dos equis and it's about the same price."
"Pilsner glass pour and I am met with a bright clear yellow colored ale with a bright white foamy head which quickly disappears to a ring around the glass. Aroma consists of lemon peel and light malt. Taste is very refreshing. Crisp and clean with a nice crisp spicy bite on the swallow. Lingering sour bitterness on the aftertaste. Dry and somewhat watery mouthfeel. Drinkability is high as this can definitely be a session brew if one so chooses. Great with spicy food and one Mexican beer I will never turn away."
"D: Always a good choice to make."
"This beer was served to me at an amazing Mexican restaurant in Southern Arizona in a pint glass. It appeared to be nothing more than pale yellow fizzy water. There was no head to speak of. Smell was a little bit rotten and a little bit of cat piss. Taste was congruent with the smell (not pleasant). Mouthfeel wasn't horrible, although thin. Drinkability was fine, but maybe I've just built up a tolerance fore bad Mexican beer."
"One of the better Mexican beers I've had, this is good for BBQ's and for when I don't feel like drinking the 10%ABV heavyweights."
"Decent, and like Corona, it gives you a good buzz after just a couple of beers."
"has a very pale color to it, looks pretty boring. my mexican buddy brought this over and i traded him a hades belgian pale ale, i got gypted.. it smells of corn and some slight SLIGHT hops. taste is pretty boring, it isn't a bad beer, its just a generic lager. mouthfeel is watery and light, but its drinkability is good, if its the summer and i'm outside, i could drink 11ty of these with no problem"
"More than a typical adjunct lager. Pours a clear straw color with a large white head that had very good retention. The head slowly settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. Stuck my nose in the glass and was treated with more than a grainy aroma. Hops, I smell hops. Hints of lemons and flowers. Also has a flavor that is impressive for the style. Enough hop flavor to mask the adjuncts. Slightly sweet malt flavor. Bitterness is low. Does not finish as clean and crisp as most BMC beers but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Nothing really stood out in the body except it did not seem as overly carbonated as other similar beers. The only reason I bought this beer was because it was available in cans and attractively priced. One of the better Mexican lagers."
"D: Soft and light, easy to drink. This is a session beer to quench the thirst rather than to enjoy."
"Notes: Flat out this is definitely way better than corona. I think this is the best clear bottled adjunct, but that isn't saying too much. Not a bad beer for a hot day outside. I could drink this again."
"I could go on and on about this beer but it looks like everbody is saying the same thing! Try it if you haven't had it though!"
"Overall: In my opinion, no beer goes better with Mexican food than Modelo Especial. Thumbs up."
"D-Not for my taste. A decent beer"
"Taste is alright. Not bad at all, maybe nothing great, but I can see myself drinking this again."
"Very decent beer for this genre. I'm always surprised to see this beer matched in price with its Corona kin, but I guess Groupo Modelo knows where it can score some easy cash. There's no choice between the two though, this beer has only a slight, but pleasant skunk, and is really easy to drink down with either a meal of barbeque, mexican, or just sitting on the deck having a few. No limes needed for this either. I really only consider this a summer novelty beer...but I do appreciate it for that quality."
"This is exceedingly thin in the mouth, with nothing at all to stick to your teeth. However thin, there is adequate CO2 present to make this one drink pretty nicely. I give it good marks on drinkability for the style. Great session/lawnmower beer, and I'll revisit it in just such an occasion."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Will definitely pick this up instead of corona as long as it's available on the way to the beach."
"Not sure why this beer gets a 'C' and Corona (Extra) gets an 'F'. To me, they taste EXACTY the same! I do like this style of beer though, for whatever reason, at least the ones that come from Mexico. They taste kind of like a Budwiser, but with some sort of Tequila flavoring or something. And for some reason, I never seem to get tired of it. I definitey enjoy one of these with a lime, extra cold on a hot summer day. !Bueno!"
"Poured fresh from a local Mexican restaurant, Modelo is a decent beer when compared to its other south of the border friends because it actually accomplishes what it was set out to do: it is a light bodied, fairly tasty lager that is highly drinkable and has minimal off flavors."
"Pours clear yellow with lots of bubbles and very little head. Pretty much par for the course. Doesn't smell great. Corn, and a faint sweet malt smell. Taste is all too familiar. Slightly sweet backbone without any help from the hops. Can taste the corn but its not as offensive as some other similiar lagers. Mouthfeel is predictably light and watery. More drinkable than some of it''s peers due to a better but not great taste. Basically, this is slightly better than the run of the mill american adjunct lager but fails to seperate itself enough."
"I drink this often and find it to be much better from a can than from a bottle (the bottle has a 'skunky' quality most of the time). Keeps a decent head, for an adjunct lager, and has a decent slightly deeper golden hue. Some unfocused bran and rice aromas. Some sharp notes, expired hops flavors. But it is soft in the mouth, slightly creamier than most adjunct lagers. But I could drink this all day."
"I would not exactly go out and get one!"
"Overall, this is a pretty average adjunct lager that you could easily drink a few of, if the occasion called for it. I'm not sure how fresh this can was, but I would try it again with a nice Mexican dish on a warm summer's day."
"D: Great on a summer day or with mexican food."
"A little expensive for a six pack, $6.50 or so without tax."
"D: A good start to the week in Mexico. The right beer for the right circumstances."
"Modelo is much better than Corona. If you're looking for a Mexican beer, then any Modelo would be a wise decision. Looks very similar to Corona, but has far greater flavors. I first was introduced to Modelo at Old Chicago around Cinco de Mayo, but it isn't a hard beer to find. Negro Modelo is also a good brew."
"Aroma was slight but the flavor was surprisingly malty and dry. It reminds me a tiny bit of a lighter version of Fat Tire. Lots of carbonation. Lingering malty after taste."
"D: What can I say, Modelo is on par with the American macro lagers, but offered at a premium-import price. If money's not an issue to you, give it a try. It does have a character of its own, as all macro-lagers do, but it is not anything that should elevate its price to what it currently is."
"Not much to say, neither disappointed nor impressed, it is what it is..."
"Grabbed a can of this from a local grocery. Poured into my pilsner glass. Pour a crystal clear light gold with a wispy white head on top. Retention is decent enough. Little lace sticks. Scents of corn, butter, and mild grass. The body is thin and slick. Drinkability is high because of this. This is one easy beer to drink, if you care to. Flavors of mild buttered corn, white bread, and a light aluminum twang on the finish. This is a basic adjunct lager. Didn't expect much so it didn't disappoint."
"drinkable, but very average."
"Smelled of cooked grains and cereal. The taste was similar but somewhat smoother than the Pacifico I also had that day. Definitely a light lager. As for drinkability not bad I could drink a few of these, but Corona might be a little better."
"The taste has a little more bite to it than a corona and I actually like this more because it more feeling to it and wasn't as light to drink as most mexi beers. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink this in US, but in Mexico I'll search a little more for it."
"Pours a (suprisingly) brownish yellow color with decent white head. Smell is actually a semi-robust dried malted grains - note: no off scents. Taste is a suprisingly flavorful toasted grains with a noticeable, yet moderate hop presence. Body is on the upper reaches of light, but the carbonation is at a very nice level for a adjunct lager. Wow, i may have never been more plesently suprised by a beer i had no hope for. Wish i hadnt avoided it as long as i had while drinking around it with some BMC products."
"D-Very drinkable, while sitting by the pool in Mexico. Refreshing, either by itself or with its typical lime garnish, which can help subdue this beer's bitterness."
"All too often my beer runs to the store are for high quality, high alcohol, maximum flavor type brews. It's nice to go back to the blue collar well once in awhile."
"12 oz bottle to glass. Looks like the photo above(it's a clear bottle after all), clear dark yellow, fizzy, weak head. Smell has a little bit of malt/cereal aroma, nothing too exciting. Taste is not too bad, reminds me of dos equis amber. This would be good on a hot, humid day down in the baja."
"Had it at the Bkini Beach Bar in Atlantic City, there wasn't anything more worthy to order anyway. Wasn't terribly disappointed though. Poured bright golden with a thin head that almost immediately disappeared. Smelt of grain and vinegar. Tasted quite bland (unmalty) and bitterish towards the end with a thin, almost waterlike mouthfeel, except carbonation was reminding me that its beer you were drinking. I would rate it big on drinkability for its smoothness."
"Flavor has some malt sweetness to it and some pretty well balanced hops too. A bit of plastic flavor on the midpalate and in the finish, but it is largely missable, making this a fairly well done adjunct lager. Honestly one of the better adjunct lagers out there, though on the more expensive side for a style that encompassing various types of swill. Feels pretty light, probably because of the high carbonation, though it stays prickly and not foamy. If you're going to drink swill, this is a pretty good choice."
"D: Goes down really smooth and isn't too heavy so I could definitely drink a lot."
"Drinkability: A decent adjunct lager. Looks half decent, and the smell and taste are not bad.="
"Looks a bit like pee in the bottle. Very slight skunk to the taste and smell but basically a fairly drinkable brew. Mine was free at a party, I believe this is a pretty pricey brew. It's about even with PBR I think. I would drink again, but never buy it."
"This is an average lager, but only ever get it in the can. I've had the bottle (clear glass) and it was N-A-S-T-Y. The can is fine. Light yellow and completely clear, moderate carbonation with a thin and diffuse head. No smell to speak of except for that faint, beer-ish smell of dilute grain water. No aftertaste to speak of, no lacing on the glass, drinks easy. Not offensive, no diacyl taste. Its not terrible, just mild and uninteresting."
"Drinkability: This beer is not bad, but it's not particularly good. It's something I could drink, but not something I would buy."
"Taking the style of this beer into consideration, it was mediocre but acceptable. I doubt I would buy it, but I would drink if offered."
"Not the worst Mexican lager I have tried. It goes well with some Tex-Mex. Though that is about the only time I will drink this."
"Notes: Not bad at all and when served ice cold it works well to clean the palate of hot spicy Tex/Mex food."
"I'll have another..."
"Overall, a descent Mexican lager. I still prefer Negra or even Dos Equis, but as long as you aren't expecting something spectacular, this beer will quench your thirst."
"D: i dont mind this beer doesn't have any offensive flavor gets you drunk"
"Pours a soapy head that goes down very fast. No lacing on glass, a bit over carbonated. Crystal clear color of yellow. Smells of a decent low grade microbrew and tastes good. Is great with enchiladas and refried beans. Nothing overly offensive, but nothing impressive either. I will leave it for mexican dinners."
"Taste as expected is light and crisp, with a malty aftertaste that sticks around for a while. Actually a little bit of hoppiness that comes out after a while as well. It's not a work of art, but it absolutely gets the job done as a refreshing summer beer. You could swig it down in quantity if you wanted to as well. This one gets solid marks across the board."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a rich golden color with about a 1 inch head. Has a unusual but interesting aroma, corn is present. Taste is of corn and malts, a bit of sweetness. Feels fairly light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"D: Excellent lager. Much better for the money that Corona or Pacifico. I'd recommend someone to try it without the lime, and if they feel compelled to add fruit -- just a little will do. This beer can stand upright on its own, and makes a wonderful addition to traditional Mexican cuisine. I prefer it with lightly salted avocado halves. Definitely a go-to-beer for Cinco de Mayo."
"update: later that night a got a killer headache and the only time beer does to me is when i drink the cheap stuff so drinkability goes from 4 to 1 - never again"
"Pours a crazy clear lightly toasted straw color with a tight fizzy white head that quickly dissapates into a sparse cap. The aroma is grainy sweet with grassy noble hops, smells like a Euro lager to me. The taste is very similar to the aroma; sweet from the grains, some corn flavor, a very grassy hop. Geez, get rid of the grainy malt and substitute with a dry cracker like malt, and have yourself a nice pilsner. The feel is light but not watery, quite fizzy, finishes grainy sweet and a bit astringent. A Mexican Euro lager which fits the brewers style I guess. I wish they went with more a pilsner style. Still better than most ""blonde"" Mexican lagers. Ranks right up there with Heineken but falls way short of their Modelo Negro...though a different style."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light and well carbonated. Both play well with the beers overall character. This could easily be a throw back beer. I certainly enjoyed this more than Bud."
"Aroma is basic macro, nothing surprising. Taste is smooth but plain and a bit watery. A light bit of malt, but nothing else to speak of. Smooth and easy drinking, but doesn't really leave you wanting more."
"Drinkability- Definitely serve extra cold. Pretty refreshing (but so is water)."
"D - This is an okay lager. I've seen it listed as a Vienna Lager in a book, but the color and lack of maltiness makes me think this site has the correct style."
"Drinkability: I'm impressed. The humble bottle and foil don't promise much, but Modelo Especial has a little something to offer. It's a good anytime lager -- the Pabst of Mexico."
"D - If I hadn't discovered craft beer I would probably like this becauseI wouldn't know any better."
"Drinkability: Excellent, very good spicy food beer!"
"drinkability: nope"
"D: really not that bad. I didn't get the ultra-violet ray imparted skunk I was expecting from the clear bottle. I like it better than corona. Im not gonna buy 12 but ill have one if its handed to me (this one was)"
" Did you know that there are pro beer drinkers that drink their beer only out of the bottle. A beer like this might be like heaven to them and beer like Anchor Porter might be like hell. Nutso..."
"It's yellow, it's fizzy, it's light on the body. It is what it is. Drinkable, yet totally forgettable."
"D- Definitely could have a bunch. Nothing too complex or heavy here."
"This is a no frill beer. No real flaws here. It's just an easy to drink basic lager."
"D-Very drinkable, I think I could have twenty of these and still be cool."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Poor retention and poor lacing. Smells of adjunct upfront and some yeast cleanliness. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast cleanliness up front, adjunct, and some slight pale malt in the finish. Overall, just another Adjunct Lager - nothing special."
"I didn't really understand the citrus flavors of this beer, something almost artificial to me. The appearance was another story though, beautiful and very inviting! Not bad overall, I did enjoy this beer so Id say give it a try. Cheers!"
"Your average adjunct lager here. Definitely nothing to brag about."
"MMMM... I wish I had one right now!"
"D: Worked well with the Mexican food I ordered it with. As a standalone beer, I'd pass."
"D - This is a totally drinkable beer, as it should be."
"D 3.5 - this one was a surprise, kinda grows on you through the beer, I would buy it as a single, but would not stock up on it or anything...."
"Drinkability- Ligght and chuggable and lacking big adjunct flavors in American macrobrews. Great for hot day, more refreshing than ice water. Mexicans sure know how to brew good hot weather beers."
"Drinkability is pretty top notch. A case of this will make anyone happy on any given night. This is also a great social beer or a good import to introduce to people who are not so familiar to foreign beers. Definitely a party favorite!"
"As you can tell, it's not much of a beer. It tastes cheap and it goes down like water. The only thing going for this beer is the price. It won't burn a hole in your pocket book. Would I ever buy this beer again? I fully doubt it unless I wanted to bring some cheap imported beer to a party."
"The aroma is surprising. There is a nice, malty aroma that does not come through in the taste. While I would not describe this beer as flavorful, you can definitely taste it, and it does not taste bad. Imagine cramming the flavor of 2-3 Buds into one and adding a little more bitterness."
"On its own, its really nothing more than any other Mexican cerveza, with all that implies. to be fair, though, it was only a little overmatched as a buddy to a Fat Alex burrito (roughly the size of the average NFL lineman's head), steak taco, and steak tostada. So it has that going for it, but honestly, the house margarita was more enjoyable. So it's drinkable, because it's so light across the board. But rest assured, any future Modelo indulgences will be of the Negro, not this one."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp, clean, and goes down easy."
"Purchased at a liquor store down the road from where I live. This is an underrated beer compared to the Coronas of the world. Although nothing special overall, this is one beer I would take either just to relax with or for enjoying some tacos and nachos."
"Comments: Tried without a lime (for purity reasons) and with a lime and found the lime added a good flavor that was lacking in the plain. It wasn't needed to cover up any bad taste but was a nice addition."
"A not too bad Mexican lager that probably ranks a bit higher than the Coronas and Tecates of the world."
"Overall, I feel it is a little better than American Macros, but falls way short of craft brews."
"Out of a can this beer was a perfectly clear golden color. The retention and the lacing of the pure white head were weak. The aroma was of macro grains, hints of peat smoke and a light sourness. The flavors I did not care for at all, toasted malt blended with corn mash. The effect was stale and stunted. The mouthfeel was a little rough, the body medium/light and the carbonation high. Some people really like this beer, but I'm just not one of them."
"This is one to which I won't return. Banal."
"There's worse things you can toss past your throat. But I don't recommend them."
"Got a can of this after doing a canopy line tour in Mexico. Was hot and this was refreshing. Cannot give an appearance review as it was in a can so I will rate average. The smell was light with some slight malt and some grain notes. The taste was refreshing, but thin. There was a little more carbonation than needed, but with the heat this was really good (except the $3 a can price). Not sure, even if I could get it in the states, I would purchase again, but was nice to try. I would rather stick to the Modelo Dark."
"The bottle was a little of a pain in the ass though. The cap is wrapped in foil which needs to be cleaned off every time or else you'll get a little of that crap in your mouth."
"Not a whole lot in terms of atmosphere. Basic, but serviceable flavor. Decent feel, again nothing special, but not bad either. Overall, worthwhile quaff."
"D - This beer is drinkable, but I would rather drink something else...."
"Drinkability: No outright hideous, but, if you find yourself in a Mexican restaurant and need a beer, I'd sooner reach for a Negra Modelo."
"It is what it is."
"Taste is veggie waste mixed with skunk corn. Just completely unpalatable, and with the consistency of club soda. So. Bad."
"Had this in a can on a plane to Cabo. The appearance of the stewardess that gave me the beer was incredible, the beer was not. Pours a fake clear gold with a sad bubbly head. Couldn't detect an aroma over my cigarette, yes it was AeroMexico! Brutal ass-in-mouth veggie and metal taste. Just a south-of-the-border version of Meister Brau. Of course, this did not stop me from having about 8, accompanied by the requisite tequila. Upon landing, I immediately regretted my decision as I deposited this fine pale lager all over the tarmac. Avoid."
"Despite an aggressive pour into a tall glass it only gave me about an inch of head. Has a slightly darker body than most beers of the style. This isn't that bad for being an adjunct lager. It probably reminds me most of Singha from Boon Rawd Brewery in Thailand."
"Drinkability: A very easy beer to slam, not to enjoy. No finish it is a so so beer. Red stripe is better"
"D: As far as Mexican lagers go this is a solid albeit somewhat pricy option."
"Cuts through the hot mexican food for sure, and subtlety of flavors makes this a very easy downer with food. Alone, I don't know how much I could drink."
"Pours a clear yellow-light brown color body. Smallish white head, somewhat lasting. Sweet wheaty aroma, maybe some malts, but no hops. Fizzy taste, fruity, maybe banana. Some malts, fruity aftertaste. Surprisingly tasty for this light style."
"This was a fridge remnant from a football night. Poured from stubby little Mexican bottle to a pint glass a clear yellow straw color with a white foamy head that quickly reduced to spotty sheen and sketchy lace. Smells mild and sweet. Tastes bland and quite average with a bit of soapiness. One good thing is you don't NEED lime to cover the essence of urine that is prominent in most Mexican beers. Has a watery thin feel and would probably go down a lot better after 4 or 5 Margaritas."
"I think this is a great beer to enjoy Mexican food with. Whenever I eat ethnic foods, I try and drink the beer from their country. This was a good example for it's style - simple, clean and refreshing."
"D= An all around drinkable beer. Not high on flavor, but better than the competition. Alongside Negra Modelo, and Dos Equis Amber, this is my go-to beer in a Mexican restaurant."
"Overall, not as good as I was hoping. Was offered more, but didn't bother. Taste was just not very good."
"Easy drinking macro. Better than a lot of the south of the border macros."
"The situation being as it was, I drank from the bottle. The beer was a dull golden color with little foam. The aroma was a musty graininess. A light husky malt flavor on the palate with a twist of off-kilter corn flavor. A slight bitterness at the end rounded it out. I think it could be better, until then I will likely do without Modelo Especial."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a golden yellow with a small white head, fair lacing. Aroma initially was skunk (thought I had a bad beer) but got better, smells like grain, with a bit a doughy yeast aroma. Light body with an initial sweet aroma, a bit salty, finished somewhat acidic/metallic."
"I could drink about a case of these. I might not even know that I drank a case of these. Typical of the style."
"Palate: Fizzy and burpy and thin. Par for the macro course."
"This has its place - with Mexican food or the beach. It's definitely drinkable if not a masterpiece..."
"From the bottle. Had a couple of these while visiting a friend. It's not bad for what it is. Grainy, somewhat sweet and only a touch of skunk. For a Mexian beer it really isn't that bad. Refreshing enough in the hot sun and not bad paired with spicy foods. Just don't expect anything ""especial"" :-)"
"Maybe bottles are different, but from the can this poured a light gold body with almost no head and no lacings, despite decent carbonation. The metal smell of can not withstanding, a cornish adjunct smell mixed with some grain. Light to medium-bodied, this brew does go down smooth and does not dry out the tongue at all. No real discernible taste, as there are no malts to speak of that bear pointing out and the hops don't really lend themselves to a fruit/dry description. Kind of watery but not bad - and it is cheap."
"Good beer. I like my cerveza's. Doesn't compare to Tecate but I enjoyed it. It is a smooth lighter stlye beer, but I figured out its not good to try and drink a lot of this fast... it doesn't go down as easily as other light beer. Which actually made me respect this beer more. Its crisp, clean, no stale or metalic taste from the can. Refreshing on a humid night. I'll definitely drink it again."
"D - Easy drinking, a little bland but not too boring. A good ""I've already had a few"" drink."
"I don't recall what the price is for a case of this, but I am sure you can get something better for the money you would spend on this. It goes down easy but with no flavor, so if that's what you are looking for this is your beer."
"MF & D- nothing unusual here, pretty much baseline for the style, with a slightly heavier body than it's american cousins. good summer party beer."
"Straw colored beer with a thick foamy head that slowly fades away.Not much really going on with the aroma.Taste is fresh and it is perfectly carbonated.Goes down smooth without any bitter aftertaste that some beers south of the border have.Another delicious macro that I would recommend and buy again!!"
"D: Pretty drinkable. More flavor would be nice but it wasn't bad."
"P.S. I find this is the best beer to make a ""Michelada"" with. I am usually a pure beer guy, but I like spice and a little out of the ordinary experimentation. To be honest the only purpose for buying this in the first place was to mix in Clamato juice, squeezed lime, and hot sauce into, and damn was it good. The beer itself, however, is just OK."
"D: Unimpressive drinkability. A struggle to drink, and even more so not to dump it down the drain. An avoid at all cost."
"D: Depends on what you are looking for. This is macro style and that is what it amounts to. If you want something to cool you off or get drunk on, this will do the trick. For the style, it is pretty run of the mill but does have a touch more flavor than some BMC products."
"Very drinkable as there is not a lot of body or taste to this drink. If it's hot and you want to get hammered, this beer is good choice."
"As of now, my favorite Mexican beer..."
"Drinkability is definitly not here. Although I finished the bottle without any major gripes, it is not exactly asking me to take another sip, really just kind of plain and boring."
"Drinkability is nice. On a hot day, I would have no reservations grabbing this beer. There are many better options, but the refreshing nature of the beer is nice."
"D: It was on special at the bar and we were sitting on the patio so it sounded alright. Very thirst quenching and insanely easy to drink. but as for getting a great BEER this is not really the fit. Easy and thirst quenching, but not really an ideal beer"
"Pours yellow darker than a common macro though,it has a couple fingers of white head with no retention or lacing.The nose is sweet and smells like tortilla chips.The taste has similarity to the nose,yellow corn,maybe lightly buttered popcorn even,some notable hop presence as well.This one has a nice body and is semi creamy with good carbonation and a lingering sweet malt aftertaste.This really is'nt very special,but,I could drink a lot of it."
"Drinkablility- An easy drinking beer but not much flavor here at all."
"Overall an easy drinking beer , that doesn't have a lot of taste."
"D- This beer is very much like a flavored water. All the flavors are light and non offensive, and I bet on a 100 degree day this would be very thirst quenching, but then again so would a glass if ice water."
"Beware the clear bottle though; you don;t want 'em hanging around and they're better out of a cooler with ice than a fridge."
"Clear golden/amber body topped by medium off-white head which was quick dying. Aroma is medium sweet, grain, some bread. Taste is medium sweet, grain, some bread, light caramel. As usual for Mexican beers, no bitterness. Light-medium body. All told, with the qualifier that Modelo is a mainstream Mexican beer, not bad."
"Drinkability: I would drink this over a Corona or a Tecate, but not a Sol."
"Snagged at an office party. Crystal clear, bright gold color, with a smallish head. Nose is clean, with a very light touch of graininess. Very bland flavor, with almost no bitterness to speak of, just a plain grainy taste. No corniness, but even all-malts can disappoint."
"D- Very drinkable. As easy to drink as water."
"You could pound this like no other, but the drinkability is dinged for the price of such a bland brew. If you are looking for a faint macro lager, it is cheaper to get it from within the US."
"Not a great lager but not an offensive one. The flavor in the can is clean and easy to drink and quite refreshing for a quick cold one. A great one to have at a authentic greasy spoon mexican joint, just make sure its cold. Its best frosty."
"A friend brought this over for poker night. I used a can for beer-can chicken and poured the rest into a pilsner glass. The head disappeared pretty quickly. The aroma hints at malt sweetness found in true pilsners and little hops. Though this is an extremely light pils, I can at least detect a light malt character in tasting with only slight bitterness. I don't get much or any adjunct flavors or notes at all; this beer may in fact be made of real beer ingredients. Though it is rather innocuous in flavor, mouth feel, aroma, it isn't bad for a sessionable lager/pilsner to wash down some good Mexican grub. In fact, I wouldn't be offended if he showed up with this stuff again."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these witout even knowing what happened. A very smooth beer but lacking in substance"
"Overall- This beer is probably great with some fish tacos or something and one could drink these all night . Enjoy"
"Poured a big ole 24oz can into a Smokestack Goblet but I shouldn't have burdened this glass with the load. Appearance is good, nice an golden with a big off white head. It all goes down after that. Aroma is nothing except corn. Oh wow, do I love corn as an adjunct...Tasty. Taste is well, corn. Once again...Tasty. Mouthfeel is exactly like a Bud Light, way to rip them off. Drinkability is a hot sunny day drinkability, when everything that is ice cold is great."
"My pour resulted in a big, bone-white head that immediately began falling away. The color was a deep golden yellow with NE-quality clarity and loads of CO2 bubbles. The nose had a dry, musty scent along with a mild sweetness. Mouthfeel was on the thin side with a light sweetness on the tongue. The finish was slightly sweet. This was an innocuous beer, very drinkable/ sessionable, and would go well with food."
"Drinkablity: Easy brew to drink. Gets better as I consume the glass. Would be great with a couple of burritos."
"Used a 24 oz. can. Pours a deep gold with a white head. A little more thin in mouthfeel than its deep color would suggest. Tight tiny bubbles clung to the side of the glass before rising throughout the consumption. Plentiful lacing in all 360 degrees of glass. Sharp with a noticeable malty sweetness. Faint hint of chocolate seems to be in there somewhere."
"Again, for the style, this is a good Mexican macro. Negro is excellent but I pour that beer; this is right out of the bottle beer. Another nice touch is when you crush a bunch working around the house you don't pay for it the next day."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light and fizzy in the mouth, what more can I say? Easy to quaff and it pairs well with greasy American food. If I want to go cheap on beer with some wings or pizza I might buy it again, though I'd prolly go with a domestic 12 as it is a bit cheaper and just about the same quality without the corn shit there."
"Useless."
"Hard pour from the can results in a nice fluffy white head, but still little retention or lacing. Nice clear gold color. Smell is grassy, grainy, light malts. Taste is medium-sweet malts with just enough grainy hops to balance. For the style, mouthfeel is pretty decent, light but not watery. Quite drinkable, better than most Mexican and domestic macro lagers."
"Poured from a 12 oz aluminum can, very classy, I know. Aroma is faint with light lemon, light dough, mild apple and pear (maybe to all of the above). Pours medium yellow with a small white head that goes away far to quickly. No lacing (big suprise I am sure). Initial flavor is sweet followed by bitter and then something bad at the end. Not too pleasent. I have a faint memory of the stuff tasting better out of the bottle, but that is not what I rated."
"Taking from a 24oz. can. Appearance is golder (is that a word?) in color than I expected it to be having a nice crisp head. Smell is lightly malty and clean. Taste is clean and refreshing light sweet malt and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a light+ with good carbonation. Better than what I was expecting."
"It finishes crisp, however, so even once it's warm, the bad flavors don't stick around."
"My favorite brew from south of the border. The neglected little brother of Negro Modelo, Modelo Especial, is an exceptional crisp clean summer beer. And forget man laws, a lime is a need addition. Often less expensive then the corporate mogul corona; this beer is a better substitute for august days and mowing lawns or should I say "" para cortando el cesped"""
"D: Not all that terrible compared to the domestic cheapos oh wait, this can was not that cheap. Not worth the price."
"There are definitely others in the style I would pick over this. The aroma is pretty bad."
"D: I could down this by the gallon if you kept the habanero salsa coming. Ole amiga with the big butt!"
"This is up there as far as mexican beers go, but for some odd reason I really enjoy the dark beer they offer as opposed to this one. I do happen to enjoy it when I am working outside or when I am kicking back and relaxing on a hot summer day. Good beer, but I would rather stick with the Negra Modelo instead."
"Pours golden with a little initial head that sticks around as a wispy cap and a constant gentle stream of bubbles. A tad darker than a lot of the US macro lagers. Smells fairly crisp and grainy with some floral and medium bitter hops. I don't smell any adjuncts, just fairly okay pilsner aromas. Taste is fairly light as expected, but again it tastes clean up front and with a little slickness at the end. Crisp and slightly hoppy, refreshing. Better by a mile than Corona or BMCs. For what it is it is drinkable."
"Drinkability- Skip this beer."
"The drinkability is pretty good on this one, although a bit thin for my tastes."
"Poured a pale gold with a forced 1-finger head that dissapeared leaving no head at all. Very carbonated. Not much of a smell present. Tastes better and richer than most, if not all macro lagers. Slight bitterness, some sweetness and a little bit metallic. Light and very easy drinking. I could drink a lot of these at a crawfish boil."
"Having said that,....color, smell, flavor, mouthfeel is richer than typical BMC, I detect a little clove in both smell and taste, Overall a typical macro in many ways but a smooth and easy drinking one. I can't help it, I like it...but what would one expect?...I'm a Texican."
"24 oz can. Pours a nice yellow gold, with a white head that quickly disappears. No mention-worthy aroma or flavor detected. This stuff is bland, bland, and bland. Mouthfeel is thin and watery with some slight fizz from artificial carbonation. Finishes with sour chemical off-flavors. This is one of the weakest beers I have ever sampled, makes Bud look like speedway stout. Overall: not recommended."
"Not a bad beer by any stretch, but it's WAY overpriced for what you get (normally $8.49/sixer where I shop; got some on sale for $6.99 but still paid too much). Neat bottle, though."
"The taste is pretty malty up front. I get some grain and some semi sweet malt and then a bit of citrus, lime, in the background that moves in and it gives it a bitter finish. Pretty easy to drink and though it's not overly abundant with flavour, what's there is pretty good."
"Drinkability- A petty refreshing summer beer. I usually keep some in my can holder in my beer fridge."
"Comments: There are few positives to recommend this beer. Like it's American lager cousins it is largely tasteless and without merit."
"A very light gold color beer with very little to call a head and no real lace either. There is a vague aroma of flowery biscuit but it is pretty weak. The flavor is similarly weak but it does come off clean and crisp if refreshment is your priority. Pretty watery stuff, lightly carbonated. Some dry biscuit throughout with a citrus highlight, but nothing at all complex going on here. Acceptable to wash down your enchiladas and not an offensive taste, but this offers nothing memorable. Could probably drink plenty of them if tastebud boredom doesn't concern you. At least I can say I didn't taste anything offensive here, no chemical or metal flavors thankfully."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability : Really nice beer, easy to drink,a real macro but with some good taste. I have this beer twice one of then was'nt ice cold and it was way better."
"D: Better than your average Mexican lager, not a great beer, but great to drink in the hot sun."
"Overall, a well done Mexican beer for what it's worth. In fact, one of the few that I truly enjoy drinking occasionally. Pour is a light golden with medium carbonation and a thin white head. Smell is of light malts and decent hop addition with a sweet subtle scent in the background. The taste isn't much, just grains and a little hop balance. Still a subtle sweet malt flavor, though this one works unlike many other macros in which that sweetness hurts flavor and takes away from the drinking experience. Mouthfeel is light and pretty watery with little substance to it, though that is kind of expected. I find the drinkability to be good. This is nothing to write home about and more simply a solid Mexican lager. Good job, I'll take it."
"Drinkability - to be fair, it's drinkable but just very plain. Presented with limited options, it's okay for a change of pace, yet too average to chase down, especially at two bucks a 24-ounce can."
"D- You could knock them back by the dozen... But why would you want such a boring taste? Go pick up a sam adams if you want a decent macro... But if you're at a mexican joint, this one is definitely better than Corona."
"Nice crisp, refreshing brew. The appearance is standard gold with very little head and very little lacing. The smell is slightly sweet with hints of malt and corn. The taste is very refreshing with just the right amount of carbonation. The malt taste cuts through nicely. This is smooth and has a dry finish. Drinkability is high and as others have said, it's a perfect beer for a hot day outside or if you're just making tacos or burritos at home."
"Yum."
"This beer was included in an all-inclusive trip to Mexico I went on recently, so I immediately went for it. The body poured out quite nicely. Rich, deep gold color with a decent, white frothy head. Pretty solid retention too. The smell was both kind of malty and bready, which had me thinking that I was not in for something that I was going to enjoy. But, to my surprise, the beer had a nice, malty taste to it and it was very smooth going down. The mouthfeel was decent and full-bodied, another chracteristic that caught me offguard. This beer is definitely drinkable. It is smooth and refreshing and tastes pretty good as well. It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be."
"This beer was better thaan anything else Brazil has given me so far, but it is still not this Englishmans 'Cup of Tea'."
"I thought this would just be another bland Mexi-brew, but it turned out to be quite a surprise. It's better than my overall score will indicate as long as you ignore the corn flavors. That said, this won't be enough to give it first prize in this invite. We got more brews coming later..."
"D: Although it’s better than Corona, it’s not very tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all. It’s a decent macro, but nothing exciting."
"Appearance is typical lager yellow. Aroma is malty and rather weak. Taste is weak, malty, and rather bitter; its flavor is more like that of a ""lite"" beer than a regular lager. Smooth but watery, it is barely drinkable and quite forgettable. Maybe the can affected it some - I have found that beers taste best on-tap, while bottles come second and cans are the worst."
"A medium-light body with a little fizz to it...this would be an ok hot weather thirst quencher while doing yardwork, type of beer."
"man, i used to love this shit before i knew what good beer was. compared to other macros, it actually is good. a little deeper in color than most macro lagers, and the buttery diacetyl and corn adjunct aromas used to appeal to me. fizzy head. some malt (not much) flavor up front with a tiny bit of malt sweetness. balanced more by the force carbonation than hops. can't notice any hops in this, actually. but somehow drinkable on a hot day, at least in the past."
"Eeh, it's beer... I guess. Not a lot here to brag about, other than it is what is expected from South-of-the-boarder beers. Thirst quenching, carbonated, lightly flavored, and low on the quality. This beer contributes a pungent hop aroma that showm mostly earthiness, but also skunkiness. Tastes are a mix of pilsner malts and corn. The beer fades quickly, just before becomming oily and sweet-heavy late. Sub-par on many fronts."
"Not good, not horrible. Another mass produced Mexican-themed beer. Impressive carbonation and head for a Macro. Taste is just so-so; however it is much better with lime. I suggest key limes. Is it below average for Macro Lagers? I dont know. It is a below average beer, for sure. Nothing especial about it, Negra is way better."
"Not half bad for a macro lager. This hangs with the best of the macros, PBR comes to mind, with mellow sweet flavor and light barley finish. That finish that actually tastes like grains in a good way is what surprised me and kept me from writing this off. Pair with food or a hot day."
"Oh, and why is this so expensive?"
"Well, this is better than Crapona, dont even need a lime. But defiantly needs some environmental enhancements."
"This being the beer Brosnan drank in The Matador, I really wanted to like it. I don't. It's really some dreadful swill."
"Pours out a brassy gold body and a thin head that I had to really force. Smells of some bready pale malts, graininess, little sulphur, and some mild hops. Flavor is very similar with the malt overtaking the grain, however. Finish has a bit of herbal hop flavor and a bit of bitterness. Only complaint is this kind of washes off the palate real quick. Mouthfeel is a bit watery to support the flavors but the carbonation is decent. I used to drink this quite often and I still like it."
"D - Excellent. For a day on the beach in Mexico, this is as good as it gets. Beats Corona or BMC any day. This has more ""real beer"" qualities than most macros, and for the money this one is a real straight shooter."
"Overall impression: Highly drinkable - not overly exciting. I would probably take this over a Corona given the choice, and wouldn't be above dropping a lime in it."
"Pours a transparent yellow color with a small head, no lacing to speak of. Faint aromas of corn, some skunk, light alcohol. Taste is much the same. This is usually what I order at Mexican restaurants, thirst quenching, simple, and better than most of the Mexi macros. It's good with or without a lime."
"A very light beer with little flavor or aroma. I had this with a slice of lime, while eating spicy Mexican food. It was thirst-quenching, and helped put out the fire, but not much beyond that. A typical Mexican beer...best enjoyed very cold with lime or lemon."
"Modelo Especial pours a typical lager yellow with very little head from a clear twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is sweet and corn like. On the plus side, I would have to say that even though this was in a clear bottle I don't think it's skunked. On the other hand its just kind of decent Mexican beer, better than most, but not aiming real high in the first place. Corn is the predominant taste. Drinkable, no lime required. Colder the better."
"Pours a golden, almost bronze color, not much surprise with the clear glass bottle it comes in. The nose is simple and plain, a bit of skunkiness, but not bad or overwhelming at all. The taste is great when compared to other macro lagers. This is much better than a budweiser. Creamy mouthfeel, not heavy but definitly not a light beer either. Not a bad choice when the selection is limited."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-n"
"Appearance is slightly darker than most mainstream American lagers. There is little to no head and no lacing of any kind. Nothing about this particular example of this beer indicates that anything special went into this beer (this is from a can). Smell is practically non-existent. Taste is very much of corn, and is rather sweet, like Coors Light. The next time I have Mexican food, I suspect I'll save myself a few $$'s and drink something domestic instead...it won't be missed."
"Thin head that is gone in about 2 seconds and had no lacing at all. The beer was pale yellow or golden. Reminded me a little of Corona, but i would say overall tasted better. Smell had hints of corn in it. Going on with the smell there was a taste of corn, but i also felt a little after taste of vanilla. Mouthfeel was thin, but i liked it because the carbonation was minimal and slid down my throat without my throat wanting to gag. I think like Corona this is good on a hot summer day, but was a little light for my taste."
"Brew poured yellow with a gold tint to it. Had a white head that breaks down quickly leaving a faint layer of foam at the top of the glass, with no lacing. The aroma of this brew was of grain along with a slight skunk smell. Probably due to the clear bottle that Modelo uses for this one? It is not a bad tasting brew, but not overly that great either. The skunky aroma gets muted a bit once you take a sip. Taste is of corn and a very faint hop taste at the end, but this might be a wish that actual. Brew did have quite a bit of carbonation, and was quite light feel. This brew was not great but not horrible (could that be the 90+ degrees out) either, I probably would not go looking for this brew here in the states but was a OK offering while in Mexico."
"Poured a brilliant gold color with a large head that faded rather quickly. Aroma was fruity with a slight hint of cereal grains and malt in the nose. Taste was kind of boring really. Some malty sweetness along with a good bit of corn and adjunts mixed in the taste. Hop bitterness was almost nil, which I guess is expected for this style of beer. Mouthfeel was very light in the palate and made this beer seem just a step above water in my opinion. I enjoyed the Negra Modelo that I had after this much more."
"Modelo Especial was golden in color and clear with a white head. The head did not last long, but did leave a litttle lacing. The aroma was light malt with a hint of skunk. The taste was crisp with a little malt and slightly grainy with a dry finish. The mouthfeel was thin with plenty of carbonation. The drinkabilty was average. It's not all that special, but is one of the better mexican macro lagers."
"Taste is grainy with corn flavors but goes down pretty smooth. Nothing complicated here, but decent in a pinch, especially in warm weather. Goes well wiith Andy Capp's Hot Fries and yelling at the tv (Hardball was on)."
"This is not complex, its not outstanding for its depth; but it ain't as watery as some; and ain't that worth anything?"
"I thought this being an imported beer would be good, well I was mistaken. The beer was a amberish color, had a skunky smell and aftertaste, and I felt full after only a few. For the price it's not worth it. I don't recommend this beer and i didn't much like it, it was free for me and well it was drinkable and I had no complaints."
"D - I gave it a higher than average rating in drinkability, cuz it's pretty light and easy to drink, but then again why would you want to."
"Pale, straw yellow with white head that disappears immediately. Clear with a good amount of bubbles rising to the surface. Smell is grainy and sweet. Taste is more of the same. Grainy at first with a sweet corn finish. Slightly skunky characteristics but not as much as its buddy Corona. Light and bubbly. A bit heavy on the carbonation. Nice and light so it is easy to drink, but too sweet and tasteless to have a lot. Would rather save money and buy something really cheap American brews or spend a bit more and get something craft. Mexican beer is the most overpriced that I've found."
"¡Salud !"
"The feel was fairly clean - left a touch of sweetness. It went down relatively easy. Not too bad as a complement to a spicy meal or to cool off on a hot day - Above average for lagers from Mexico (have had quite a few, and have been mostly unimpressed, but this isn't bad.) In the end, nothing great though, and I don't know if it's worth the extra money unless, possibly, for some sort of Mexican party or meal."
"Tasted this for the first time over the holiday weekend. Pours a light colored body w/not much head. Pretty much looks like a macro. That said, it has more flavor, and when it's hot outside and you want something that goes well w/chips and salsa, this is actually a good beer. However, anything warmer than ice cold or drinking the brew by itself would not be recommended. A good beer for when you are just in the mood for something refreshing w/little complexity."
"It finishes clean and dry with some short-lived hops and then some residual maltiness left on the palate."
"This is a dangerous beer...to me. I think I could drink like waaay to many of these in one night. Not because they taste good, but just because they are easy to drink, and aren't terribly bad in the taste department. I drank this out of the bottle, and I could still taste the aluminum from the cover that was on it. I would only get this again for drinking games or a party if it was really cheap. Otherwise there is no good reason to buy this."
"This is okay beer. The lack of any truly horrifying characteristics, the light sweetness and the easygoing drinkability have grown on me over the course of the bottle. I'll have no trouble ordering up a Modelo Especial the next time I get a hankerin' for a chili relleno."
"From the bottle. Pours out to a medium blonde color with a fair head of foam that towers about an inch and a half over the beer. Aroma is stinky; veggies and sour malts. Taste along the same lines. Some malt and grain with a touch of sweet hops. Mouthfeel was like water, very light and bland. Drinkability? If I had to, i'd drink it. Luckily, I live in America. Not recommended."
"Overall: A pretty decent cerveza. Worth a try."
"I never was much for Mexican beers but this one I like. It has a distinct sweet taste giving way to a slightly bitter finish. The smell is reminicent of Budweiser or michelob to me, not a bad thing but not great either. Definately a beer for the summer time while sitting on the porch with friends. Don't forget the lime."
"This is the best beer ""Grupo Modelo"" makes. I'm not a mexican beer fan, but this is the second best mexican beer I've had. Had this beer while in Zihuatanejo. The flavor is more of a flavor to my liking. Nice balance of bitter/tartness with mild hops."
"This comes in a neat different bottle that sort of reminded me of a small champagne bottle becuase of the foil at the top. The beer itself is a watery light beer, a bright golden yellow color, and not a strong taste rather malty. I felt this had more flavor and was a better drink than Corona, and just as easy to drink."
"D: Drain-pour. Not quite actively unpleasant, but close."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, but why when so much else is out there?"
"Why waste your time?"
"The unusually shaped bottle catches the eye as does the golden color. This beer is a bit darker than expected for a ""mexilager"". The aroma is sweet and corny as expected. The taste is significantly better than most other south-of-the-border beers. My non-beer-drinking fiance took the obligatory taste and actually liked this beer. That is a first. Carbonation was good but is close to the line of being excessive. Overall very drinkable. Would recommend for hot summer days or as a compliment for burrito takeout."
"Body is razor thin as expected, with a fizzy mouthfeel and coarse, grainy texture. Drinkability? Only if I was stranded on a Mexican island w/out any water."
"This is a tastey 'International Lager' as I call them. Its a bit better than the North American Macro offerings, but not like a real German Pilsner. Still good to try, and compare to Corona."
"Pours a soft golden hue, with a crystal clarity. A fizzy two and a half finger head reduces quickly and leaves small amount of sticky lace. The aroma walks the fine line between old saaz hops and light struck skunk; this odor kind of blocks out any other smell. The taste is slightly spicy and a bit sweet; pilsener and munich malts? But the hop character is too high for the style and the off-flavor clouds the perception of malt. Typical Mexican lager afteraste, dry-with a german hop bite. Thin body but only light carbonation somehow works here, and seems condusive to serving outside in warm temperatures. Slightly crisp, and easy to drink, but the unbalanced taste greatly detracts from it's overall score."
"Drinkability: An average macro, lime not needed. The price keeps me from buying this more. When having some good Mexican food, this one hits the spot nicely, but not worth seeking out on its own."
"My girlfriend said this beer tastes like pee, and she may be right. But I suspect pee would produce a better head. In any case, this beer is passable with pizza and better than Corona (I think it's better than negra modela too). I also noticed that spicy food brings out some sweetness in this beer. I'd probably steer clear of this beer unless you're at a restaurant with slim pickings."
"Clear glass skunk alert bottle pours a pale yellow with a short-lived white head that faded rapidly and left little if any lace. This was the hight point for this brew. The aroma was corn and faint floral hops. Some typical macro funkiness. Not enticing at all. Taste was light and somewhat metallic and bready. Hops were present in the finish, but only barely so. Mouthfeel was light as expected but did little to improve this beers drinkability. Better than Bud, but only barely so."
"Pours an incredibly clear straw colour. Darker than I expected, and I must say that I was pleasently surprised by the colour. Decent carbonation forms a thin lacey white head. Absolutely nothing as far as aroma is concerned -- extremely clean. Tastes rather grainy. Very clean and smooth. A little more flavour and body than your average macro. But, being a macro, is rather bland. However, it is my choice beer at any Mexican eatery, and I am always pleased when this brew is available at one."
"the original ""bull´s ball"" huevo de toro, is very popular in my city over any brands of its rival brewery, but in general is exceptional for a party time, buddies reunion, smell fabulous, taste exceptional, like a real german lager beer, grupo model brewer of this beer had a lot of beer most are german or european styles, for many drinkers this is good, every brands have its drinkers."
"Corn/Grain is the main smell and taste but it does provide a slight twinge of bitter hops and some acidity. Refreshing, crisp mouthfeel but its just to watery to earn a passing grade. Easily sessionable as I found nothing offensive about this brew just nothing to get excited about either. Below average for the style."
"CLear, with a considerably foam. BUt it is a lager after all, a little bitter sometimes, not for a party or a football match reunion, but it can give you a good time in a chat. PErhaps the best beer of this brewery even better than Corona, well, you know."
"drinkability: Decent for a light lager, nothing outstanding, but better than a lot in this vein, better than Corona, IMO..."
"Well I usually only drink the Negra when at my usual Mexican joint, but tonight I felt like trying the Especial and I wasn't dissapointment. A light airy yellow with a white head in my frizen glass, pained grin. There is no real smell here just a hint of cereal grain and alcohol. The taste was pretty good and it reminded me almost of a Vienna lager and it had a good body for a adjunct lager. Little if any perceptable hops and I actually think I liked the second one better with the lime. Easy drinking with or without food and not snubbed easily."
"Reasonably drinkable, but I'm not going out of my way to catch this one again. There are plenty of other Mexi-lagers on the market that are better."
"Had this beer on Cinco de Mayo with nachos. Poured from a bottle into pils. Was very light with very little head. Smell was mild, almost non-existent. The taste, again, very mild. Nice lil balance, and a lil on the hoppy side. Not something that I would drink everyday. Maybe not a great Mexican beer. Nevertheless, given the opportunity, I'd drink it with Mexican food ANYTIME. My score may be on a bit of the high side, but this is because it paired excellently with the food I was eating. It's probably not a good beer for beer's sake, but it must have been brewed with chimichangas in mind."
"I thought i'd give this a go, a hot day and all that. Served really cold it really quenches your thirst, just not much flavour. Def. better than corona though"
"Drinkable as long as it's very cold."
"This is a slightly more tasty mexican lager than corona. The appearance is a light, pale yellow color with no head. The smell is grains and pale malt, not much of significance. The taste is grain, malt and an extremely light hops bitterness present in the background to make the brew crisp enough to be refreshing. A little bit better than corona but nothing special. Overall a subpar mexican beer (at least compared to pacifico, dos equis, or bohemia)."
"Oh good, a lager brewed by Grupo Modelo I can hardly wait. A clear gold color, with a large head at first, which fades to almost nothing. Smell is oh so skunky, really bad grassy malt. Taste is sweet, watery, metallic and pretty gross. Yuck, no hops overall pretty bad. Mouthfeel is very watery, drinkability utterly aweful."
"This is a party beer, when you can indulge yourself with your buddies around a barnecue."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a light, grainy pale malt scent with a slight sweetness and a dry lager yeast aroma. The taste is decent as well. It has a clean and crisp pale malt flavor that is light and easy drinking. It goes down easy and finishes dry and thin with a slight metallic taste. This has more malt flavor than most lagers from south of the border, although it's still simplistic in nature. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good macro lager. It has a decent malt flavor that is light and easily drinkable."
"This is a great light-bodied summer beer. It has an above average taste for a light bodied beer, doesn't leave you feeling bloated. Doesn't have the sour aftertaste of a Carona, no lime needed. This is the type of beer to drink while on the beach, out in the sun at a BBQ, etc.. If I am looking for a nice full bodied beer, I won't touch it - but on a hot day, looking for something to party with without getting all bloated, Modelo Especial is for you!"
"The aroma. Bad. Like sweaty socks mixed with some skunkweed. Taste isn't much better. Mouthfeel is thin, even for an adjunct lager. I've had my share of adjunct lagers in my day, and usually there isn't much taste there, and what there taste is there is usually bland, or at least inoffensive. But this is a real stinker. I don't think you could pay me enough to drink this again."
"It's amazing, even in Mexico the corner hamburguesa stand dishes out quality chow but you can only get one beer. Sure they change the label or add coloring or it might even be brewed by the competition but it is essentially the same beer. Gold under a paltry head. Nose of whatever you happened to eat previous clinging to your upper lip hairs. How can you describe the taste? Why describe the taste? Grease from a conveyor carrying mass produced aluminum apples. I'm left wondering why my mini bar is void of tequila."
"one of the best mexican beers i've had."
"This beer was purchased on discount and I wanted to give it a try. As a result this batch was most likely past its prime. I can't imagine it being a great beer even right off the bottling line but its worth a try if you are looking for a light summer beer that isn't as bad as corona but a very slight step up from American adjunct pilsners."
"Decent. Better than I expected. Pours a golden color, with a small head which quickly dissipates. The smell is of hops and baked corn. I wasn't expecting much, but I was somewhat impressed by the amount of hops in this beer - decently strong, for it's style. A good beer to have with peanuts or pizza. Not nearly as bad as it's brother, Corona. Goes down pretty smooth, and obviously is very drinkable because of it's low ABV."
"A decent beer. Maybe if I could drink one that's a little more fresh I would like it more."
"If given to me, I will drink again, but this is one beer that I would not buy for myself again."
"Balance of light malt and bitterenss blends pretty well. But could use more malt character. This is alright. Worth is more when it was cheaper."
"Good drinkability on a hot day. This beer would work well with a spicy Mexican dish. Not a beer worth pursuing, unless you're at a Mexican restaurant and looking for an alternative to Corona."
"Modelo pours fairly carbonated with a decent head. My first sip from the can made me immediately think of PBR. After having a couple I decided it fared a little better then the average cerveza, but barely. If forced to pick Mexican, I'd take Negro Modelo, Bohemia, and Dos Equis Amber before this. But given what you pay for these, you might as well get really good beer."
"This is a fairly decent Mexican beer, but not better than average in the greater scheme of beer. Appearance is a nice golden color, head is short and weak. Smell has strong adjunct qualities, with notable sweetness. Taste is average, not bad for a hot afternoon, underlying malt sweetness is hard-to-find, but nice. Modelo Especial is okay, but not really worth your time when you can get better beers for the same price."
"i'll not waste everyones time describing anything but the taste in this beer, well the taste i could find. the first thought in my brain after my first drink was that is creamy and smooth. my second thought was geee... this beer has no taste all. this beer is flavourless and disappointing. i will not give them any more of my money."
"Good Drinkability. A good choice for a Mexican beer."
"This was actually a pretty decent tasting beer. I had always seen these in restaurants but never had one before. It is a pale lager, and tastes much better when you pour it into a cup rather then straight out of the can. I was told it was rather strong for a Mexican beer but I thought that it tasted great."
"Very very drinkable today. I could have sat con Conejo, David, y Nazario todos del noche."
"Mexican beers often get a bad rap, but this is actually acceptable. Pours like a bud...pale and frothy white. Smell is sweet and maybe a little corny...some metallic twang that might be hops shows up too. Taste is similar to Bud but more complex...hoppier and with a better grain profile. Mouthfeel is fizzy and refreshing like a lager should be. Drinkability is good when the weather is warm. Nothing fancy but there aren't any extremely weird flavors present. Average beer."
"I have to rate this better than mainstream beers and most Mexican beers. This has pretty decent quality. It is a medium golden with a thick head and big bubbles. Aroma is a mellow maltiness and maybe, just maybe some mild hops. THis has a clean maltiness that's not too sweet and slightly curbed with some bittering hops. Refreshing but not too light. The mouthfeel and taste compliment each other. THis is easy drinking, pleasant and pretty good quality."
"Overall: Not bad, not great, but given the choice, I think I would opt for this one above the usual 3 US macro main-stays. Begs to accompany spicy Mexican food, or better still, very hot Indian Curry. I think 2.85 is a fair enough mark here."
"The pour was your standard golden yellow with little or no head that quickly dissapated to nothing. The was very skunky with a light fruit overtone. The taste, it hits the front of the tongue very watery with a light hop bite in the middle and a very clean finish. This is a very refreshing beer, I will probably keep some on hand for lawnmowing season."
"How close to water can""beer"" be created? Try this beer to find out. Very light malt flavor, no hops present. This one is just very expensive water. I tried to pick up some flavors,but quit, downed the bottle, I was thirsty, and vowed not to waste my $ again. Unless it was 100 degress and I was in Mexico."
"There isn't alot goin' on with this stuff, in the bottle or can. It's just clean in the way of smell and taste. Has little carbonation. Hell, I bet you could kill 15 of these things in a sitting. Most definately a beer you turn to when you've been outside workin' in 90 degree heat all day. This is just plain satisfying (for what it is anyway) in my opinion. Like I said, perhaps my favorite Mexican brew."
"Very easy to drink while in the hot sun. Not a ton of taste, but it can hit the spot!"
"This is the cheap beer I keep stocked in my fridge. Everybody always bashes cheap macros, myself included but we always need to have some stocked. This is the beer I keep stocked. The apperance is golden yellow with minimul bubbly head but fine lacing on the glass. The smell is a blast of hops with grains, citrus also pours through. The taste is crisp and hoppy, not to hoppy. You can taste a hint of malt. Feels crisp but a little to light in the mouth. A very drinkable beer, with summer coming up this is the beer that will be in the fridge for the bbq's."
"easy going, ranks fair to middlin"
"Not my favorite Mexican brew, but still better than Corona. It had more body to it that most Mexi beers, which is a good thing. It wasn't just some washed up light beer in a bottle. It had tastes of citrus, hops, and some malts. The thing that turned me off was the hoppiness that I got. I was expecting something much less and then got some hops slipped in. If you are looking for a good Mexi brew, I suggest Negra Modelo, the better of the two."
"Geez----bad beer with reservations."
"This really is not a good beer but it actually went quite well with my meal."
"Comments  I hate to offer nothing constructive, and I know some of the other BAs found things to like about it, but I just cant write anything in all honesty even remotely favorable about this especial brew. I thought it estunk."
"Ambitious beer. Best of the night."
"This is a good beer to have with Spicy food. Pours to a nice 1/2 inch head that sticks around. Smells of euro-lager sulfuriness and slight skunk (not like corona) Taste is of sweet malt and corn adjuncts with low hopping. Finishes clean. Very quaffable. Not bad but not particularly a high quality flavor either. Nice to have an ice-cold one to cool off your tongue."
"Clear pale yellow color, fizzy head that stays around about as long as it takes to sit down. About two partial ring laces. Distant non-descript malt aroma at best. Strikingly thin body and mouthfeel, very close to its cousin Corona and something that masks the beers one defining characteristic, a slightly corny malt. Wateriness continues to the aftertaste with very little hops, slight sulfur and metallic tones emerge. Can't give much in the drinkability category either."
"An above average lager. Pours a very pale golden tone with a thick but easily fading head that leaves verym very scarce lacing. The smell, very strong, shows some citrusy and low hops mixes with no much maltyness. The taste is a nice, full body sweetness with some bitterness. A good lager anyways."
"Nothing too special (or especial) about this beer except the nice packaging. Average all the way around. Might possibly have been a little better if not skunked. This is like a premium version of Corona, if you could imagine such a thing."
"This brew poured somewhat of a small head. It was yellow in body. It was a thin brew. It was a rather smooth brew to drink. In my own opinion, I was not very impressed by this particular brew. This is another brew that lacks character in my humble opinion."
"Pours a clear gold with a voluminous white head that vanishes quickly leaving behind a thin layer of lacing bubbles. The nose of this beer out of the clear bottle was of light skunk and malt. The taste is purely macro and the feel is of a light body with a thin sense. The finish is highly astringent. Some sense of adjuncts. To my peril, this beer was served closer to room temperature than it should have been. Clearly, it needs to be kept very cold."
"Packaging looks good. Pours like a macro lager, pale yellow with a 1"" white head. Smell and first sip are of malted grains. Only slight hop taste. This actually was surprisingly smooth. I don't think this is great, but it's not as bad as some."
"The appearance of this little mex caught my attention. The foil wrapped short bottle helps this brew stand alone from its Corona big brother. Its pure clear gold color and small white head compliment any mexican or spiced dish. Its smooth clean finish helps make this a very drinkable brew."
"The pour the prototypical lager clear gold or straw if you prefer. Modest in size white head and something resembling lace that is oozing its way down the glass. The aroma of malt and little else to speak of, sweet as is the start and the top skimpy. Finish is lightly hopped and the acidity mild with a very dry lingering aftertaste. Another average beer, it is drinkable, I must give it that and I dont like being totally negative."
"Not so good. This is a beer that brings the word ""thin"" to mind. It has no color beyond the usual macro-tones. The smell is actually bad, almost smells spoiled (I had this beer at least 6-7 times in Mexico and it smelled the same each time). Flavor is lager - minus. Drinkable in Mexico only."
"This certainly wasn't very ""especial"". This may be even worse than Corona. Vile, repugnant smell. No redeeming qualities in the flavor. Truly heinous. Another contender in the ""crap Mexican beer"" contest."
"A bit better than average Mexican beer; goes well enough with Tex-Mex, or barbeque.  Definitely a summer beer, I might have liked it a bit better on a really hot summer day, rather than a cool autumn evening, such as this one."
"Bit more flavour than your usual Mexi-Lager, this is a prefered lager I have when enjoying south-of-the-border cuisine. No lime is needed being that there is less offensive off flavours to try and mask. Best consumed ice cold."
"Typically clear golden hue topped by a head that settles quickly into a tight layer.  Sparse lace is left.  Soft grain, a touch of herbal / grassy hop and sweetness in aroma.  No trace of skunkiness. Very mild, almost bland all around flavorwise-- light grain husk flavors and paltry hop bitterness are discerned at first, and are followed by a mellow corn flavor and residual sweetness.  Finishes very clean w/ a hint of sulfur.  There's nothing outstanding about Modelo Especial, but it far surpasses most domestic macrobrew overall."
"I'm not sure how this is supposed to compare with Lowenbrau as a reviewer below mentioned. Perhaps I should try again some other time. It was hoppy, light on smell and feel. I'd suspect it would be a good meal beer but nothing special."
"Not a bad light beer, but I don't think it tastes like a Mexican beer. It has more of an American light beer taste to it, but is better than most of the stuff here. I would probably only drink this at a Mexican restaurant, which is where I originally had it. The bottle is the most interesting part of the beer."
"Thinner than most ""lite"" beers, if you dilute one Corona in a gallon of seltzer, you've pretty much got this beer."
