"I can't be too hard on PBR. For the price, its the best cheap beer out there, and definitely the beer of choice if I just want to get drunk with friends. Definitely outcompetes Nattie Light, Busch Light, and all that other stuff"
""
"I like it as a session beer.  It's not something to sit there and appreciate, just drink it.  As a good friend of mine said, ""It goes great with punk rock shows and smoking cigarettes."""
"I wanted something cheap and drinkable (Steel Reserve need not apply), and this was the best the gas station had to offer.  I should have spent the exorbitant mark up and got something else.  6 tall boys were 5 too many."
"Light and crisp American macrobrewery lager, smells faintly of apples.There's a time and a place for this beer."
"It'll get ya drunk, won't taste good until about 9."
""
""
""
"Will only drink it if its free"
"I would never pay to drink this beer, it better be free.."
""
"It's like Budweiser but a little better."
""
""
""
""
"Never understood its popularity other than being dirt cheap. Bad beer should be cheap."
""
""
"Served in a Pint glass"
"O:  Not bad for what it is. Picked it up from a gas station in the middle of nowhere on the way back from fishing in the gulf, so something has to be said for availability.  I would take this over some of the other macros for sure."
""
"Overall : Fresh but bland and overly accessible. Too bitter for a lager in my taste."
""
"This is the best cheap adjunct lager. Pours a surprisingly thick and creamy head, and while it is watery it still has a nice, creamed corn taste. The only real complaint I have is the inconsistent feel. I've had this beer many, many times, and sometimes it's incredibly smooth, but it often has a stinging carbonation. Still, an excellent beer for what it costs."
""
"Overall:  People who seek cheap beer should try Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR)."
"Just not a very good beer imo"
"A pretty decent beer considering how cheap it is."
""
""
""
"I can down one after the other of Pbr"
"Just a run-of-the-mill lager brew that is a good filler/cleanser between craft brews. Give it a 4 on feel... purely because of the cost/quality affect of having fun with beer. Nothing overpowering in this beer... but clean. Love that it comes in pint cans to wet the whistle after a long day in the yard, at the lake, or coming off the slopes."
"Serving: on tap at a St. Patrick Day. Probably need to try it again."
""
"The greatest beer at this price point."
""
"Best macro-beer  in my opinion. Great for long nights of drinking."
"borderline undrinkable. temperature must be ICE cold to avoid vomiting."
""
""
"Best beer for your money!"
""
"Smooth drinking, great for a hot summer day. More taste than most American Style Lagers."
""
"aside from it being popular now and i see no way how this beer justifies a 2.93 rating. it tastes as though it is made with spent grain. icky"
""
"You know it's just the same shit. Not good just cheap"
"Mild malt aroma and taste. A bit better than a typical macro lager. Not a beer worth over analyzing. Enjoy it for what it is, cheap and drinkable almost anytime."
""
"Enjoy"
""
"Pretty much the only time you're going to ""enjoy"" one of these is at the end of the night when you've already had too much to drink. I read somewhere that every time a PBR is drank, a hipster gets his vintage bicycle."
"Why have I waited so long to review this gem? I know it's one of the biggest love-hate beers around, and I happen to be a lover. The only macro I purchased regularly in college...a 30-pack a week while buying groceries in Arizona. Easy to drink and consistent. Personally, I think it's best from a can rather than draft and bottle."
""
""
""
"Once upon a time, I was totally okay quaffing these down like water at parties. Now I am older and oh so slightly wiser (i.e. employed), so I recognize this as, well, shit. That said, I can't help but find this beer comforting in the right scenario, even if those scenarios are limited to getting this for free or being the cheapest not-Budweiser beer available at the concert venue. It may be decidedly low-tier, but there's no doubt there's a function for it somewhere in your life."
""
""
""
""
""
"Smooth and perfect for  BBQ"
"The gold standard of its class...it is just a good all around adjunct. There is a reason the neo-hipster types have clung to this...well they've moved on by now I'm sure, but that's just this generation's peripatetic and fickle nature...PBR will stand the test of time...an ice- cold bottle of this stuff is sublime at the right moments..."
""
""
"One of my fav cheap beers"
"Wish it was more available in the UK as the price over here is not representative of the quality and i would like to try it on draught. Have tried both can and bottle versions and they are like regular lagers but with an extra sweetness. Can also distinctively taste corn or maize syrup. My girlfriend doesnt like beer but likes this one."
"I'm white trash and I'm in trouble"
""
"Like many others I used to drink this a lot when I was younger. I decided to try this again to see if I still liked it. I didn't. Watery with a bad aftertaste. Not the worst cheap beer out there, I will finish the six pack eventually."
"Not a good beer at all"
"Not worth drinking if I had to"
"I love this beer when I'm partying. My Granpa drank it, my father drank it and I got hold that tradition:) Americana at its finest."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer, accept it for what it is."
""
""
""
"A great beer to enjoy"
"A little harsh taste. It has a lingering after taste that is not too pleasant.  But for a macro brew its ok.  More complex than Bud or Coors,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The ultimate hipster beer. This beer is also underrated compared to all other macros."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only adjunct I'll buy. Just glad the Russians didn't get their hands on this brew. I feel it's our duty as BA'ers to promote this to the younger/cheaper set so that they avoid lining the pockets of BMC. You see a college kid with a bud lite, dope slap him and give him a PBR. It's American dammit!"
"Decent beer to drink on a summer day."
""
"Good beer. For $17 for a 30 pack you cant get anything better. I love that this beer comes in 30 packs. Not many good beers come in 30 packs."
""
"Good old american ""white trash redneck"" beer. can never go wrong with it"
"Sweeter and perhaps more flavourful than other AAL's; that can be good or bad. Sometimes I want something more watery, just to chug back, like Busch or something. Either way, I'll play the hipster game when I want to."
"PBR is the ""white trash chic"" trend beer today.  I have always liked it.  It has a great hop flavor and is very smooth."
""
""
""
"I will never understand why anyone likes this beer, tastes like dirty water and the after taste is even worse"
""
"If it's 110 degrees and your at the lake and you wanna be able to drink beer all day, then grab this. I really can't see any other time where it would be a good idea."

"fresh from Jackson Pub in downtown Milwaukee, not what is was 2o years ago."
""
""
""
""
"The label isn't so bad."
"Pabst is by far the most overhyped macro beer in the north america.  It looks the same as almost all other macros but the smell of grain is really strong and the taste is very bitter unless served ice cold.  I still take regular  bud any day"
""
""
"Best cheap beer out there."
""
"Its a lot better on tap."
"Not a fan of PBR, never have been."
"It's PBR. What can you say?!?"
"It won a blue ribbon."
""
""
""
""
""
"what do you really expect?"
"PBR is the best domestic lager you can buy and it is $7.99 per 12er. Enough said."
"Food pairings: Broken pretzel pieces from the bottom of the bowl, cold pizza, Marlboro Reds, Jaegermeister."
""
""
""
""
""
"I do not like this beer."
""
"Simple crappy beer but easy to drink"
"I know this is a cheap beer and for many years, it was not even available around my parts of the woods.  Well guess what folks, it's back.  I love this beer.  I don't know why, I just do.  And, since posting on FB pages, I've noticed that some of my friends that I grew up with in High School love it too.  Doesn't matter if it comes from a can or a bottle.  Still taste good.  I want to try this on tap some day."
"2.58/5: Heineken? Fuck that shit. PABST! BLUE! RIBBON!"
""
"What can I say about this one? It was pretty much as expected and not at all good, the smell in particular being a poor one but it did manage to remain at least partially drinkable, just not all that enjoyable. The taste was fairly basic and I could imagine it appealing to your macro lager drinkers due to it's crisp, clean taste but it wasn't a good beer at all."
""
"I still give this more points for being cheap and largely available. Also, the taste is clean and crisp. I don't mind drinking this."
""
"PBR is by far my favorite beer with similar ""lightness"". I would buy PBR almost exclusively in college, because I believed (and still believe) that it was the best beer I could buy for the price. I could get a 12er for $7.99. Unfortunately PBR has seen an increase in demand, resulting in a higher price in my area. Now I think a 12er of Sam Adams or New Belgium is a better deal. PBR pours a nice golden yellow and is very refreshing. Always puts off those who like to rid beer of all of its taste. It is a little skunky but something about it tastes great. I recommend getting in cans, as the bottles seem to add some off-putting skunkiness."
""
""
""
"Great adjunct lager. Lite body, crisp, refreshing. For an AAL it does have a little more character than similar brands, not complex, just a little more character. Very drinkable or a great session beer, also a good burger, pizza, tacos beer etc. Compare with other more expensive beers and you will be pleasantly surprised."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a very mild taste with no distinguishable  hops, and it goes down smoothly. It is best to drink PBR while laying in the darkest corner of a subway stop."
""
"dont knock it till you try it... then go ahead and knock it.  its cheap, so it tastes cheap.  good for a day on the lake around the 4th of July."

"Personally, I found it weird when my friends said that they wanted to funnel beer into their butts, but as a huge Howard Stern fan, I thought ""if Richard Christie can identify beer through his ass, how hard can It be?"" So I de-pants, my boy Dave held my legs behind my head as I lay on my back, and my other buddy, handsome mike, did the pouring. Just a little sip at first, as I didn't want to get too giggly. All I can say is ""Yum!", very good mouth-feel, light but full-bodied, and refreshing - also not sticky! I think that this is the only way to drink this American Classic. Happy drinking, friends!"

"It's not bad, but I can't really ever buy this these days - not with Yeungling sitting right next to it, (Are you crazy?) PBR has to take a down-market seat next to the Busch Ice and Milwaukee's Best. In it's day, it had a solid seat next to Hamms, Falstaff, and Schlitz. (At least it hasn't suffered the fate of those labels.)"
""
"It excels at being both light and tasty, while remaining true to the very foundation of simplicity. Especially given the price, this beer works exceptionally well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Quality outdoes the price. I grew up on pbr and learned to like it. Only thing is that it seems to consist of more water and fizz than anything else."
"The infinitely drinkable go to clear beer. Sweet nose. Smooth on the tongue. Decent body. Easy finish. Good for building beer wands at cons and fests."
""
"If you need to get a cheap buzz, you could do worse."
""
""
"I've had many horrible beers in the past. PBR wouldn't rank in that category. It's not a great tasting beer, but it's lite and refreshing. This beer has it's purpose. Plus you can't beat the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"And I do."

"One of two Pepsi's of beer for me. It's just there to drink like anything else. Not expecting anything in the way of quality."

"Pabst is often knocked for being a cheap beer only suitable for college Keg parties or cheap rounds at the bar. That said, it is, in my opinion, the best of any major domestic lagers. Definite hint of hoppiness, a little sweet with out any overpowering flavors. Smooth with a strong finish. By far my favorite domestic beer"

""

"Not bad at all for what it is. Seems like low scores are because they think this is a kobe fillet and its really top ramen. When rated as it is a 5-7 dollar 12 pack type of beer it has decent flovor aroma if kinda off putting but whos sniffing there pbr anyway."
"Pabst, the first (and only time) I prematurely ejaculated BEFORE intercourse."

"definitely not good, i wasnt disgusting by it. easy to drink, but little taste"
""
""
"Overall I was generally impressed with the beer and it will probably see my garage refrigerator again, especially if I can pick it up at a good price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Musty barley odor.  Clear yellow with 1 inch head, dissipates moderately.  Corn, barely and hint of sweetness. Would not buy again. Stereotypical comment: you get what you pay for."
""
"The flavor is sweet corn, grainy cereal malt. The beer has a decent bready malt backbone that makes it arguably more significant of a brew than Bud, Miller, Coors."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even for a cheap dive-bar beer, you can do better."
""

"If you are a poor alcoholic then this is the beer for you. Between the affordable price, the decent alcohol content and the lack of flavor you can drink a lot of these with relative ease."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a perfect American Adjunct Lager.  It surprised me to remember how little flavor these have.  But it serves its purpose very well; affordable, refreshing, pairs outstandingly with food.  The category is dull, but this beer shines."

""
""
""
""
""

"You can never go wrong with a Pabst Blue Ribbon. Cheap, tasty, and drinkable. Only problem with it are those damn hipsters ruining it for us."

"Not a bad beer, but not great either. For the price though it gets the job done"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow with a fizzy head. The smell is faint but I do get some grain and mild hops aromas. The taste is clean, yet not a whole lot there. For a beer priced very cheaply it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Classic American full calorie lager"

""
""
"Best beer in its price range. Watery but easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
"Overall (3.26) : A good tasteful lager representative of its style. Some folks don't like it because it actually tastes like something, but I don't mind, even if some of the flavors are off-putting. On the right night this beer does good. On the wrong night it can possibly be a drain pour, unless you exclusively drink Pabst. It is a staple in my beer fridge and probably will be for a long time to come."
""
"You get what you pay for, a luckily with PBR you don't pay very much! Strong adjunct corn flavors. Very watery. Somewhere in the watery mess theres a hop that probably fell in the tank by accident while brewing...its an AAL. Tastes a little better than most. Price is great"
""
""
""
""
""
"On of the best of low end beers. At a restaurant with shitty selection this is a go-to beer."

"Reviewed for what it is, this is perfect. It's the best American adjunct by far in my opinion; far beyond Bud and its ilk. It's nothing when compared to craft beers, of course, but at $3.19 per 4-pack of 16 oz. tall boys, this is my go-to when I want to get messed up for cheap (cough cough I mean it's a great session beer). Perceptible hops, an okay malt body, and no gross aftertaste make this an excellent offering for the price, considering otherwise you'd be looking at Steel Reserve or something like that."
""
""
""
""
"This is now my ""go to"" beer when I want something quick, cheap, and refreshing!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers"
""
"With all the sentimental reviews, plus it's popularity amongst the trendy, I decided to buy a can. Poured it into a glass. It pours a nice clear straw color with a foamy head and has good lacing. It tastes better than most AALs. But. It's a tad on the light side for me. If it had a richer flavor, I would have bolstered my rating."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ole PBR don't get much love. Overall one of the best of the old time Americans. Most people don't give it its due simply because of the stigma that has been placed upon this legend.  Get it cold and its hard to beat Ain't no namby pamby beer for sure"

"Refreshing light beer. Corn flavor is very pronounced but doesn't deter enjoyment of these beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As this style goes, this is one of the best. While anything but complex, there is a decent hop-malt balance and a very drinkable, enjoyable texture. Not a bad beer at all."

"Surprisingly full of character, and not like other American lagers. Much better - and plenty of history to boot ! I love the retro renewal - goes great with a sandwich, hot dog, at the ball park, picnic, Sunday afternoon on the driveway, whatever. Great stuff!"

"Ok. This is not a top shelf beer. This stuff is cheap, corn-heavy adjunct lager. That being said, it's dang tasty when it's hot out, has a little more ABV than your run of the mill 3.2, and I love that when I bust one out, very few people swarm around to get their hands on one, making it an even better value! Pale yellow in color, It's got enough malty body to separate it from the miller/coors/bud barley pop, while still being easy to drink in quantity. No real discernible hoppiness, especially compared to my standard IPA/DIPA fare. Refreshing, but not a light beer. Taken for what it is, I believe it to be a great beer, when limited to class-comparison. I'm drinking one right now, as it's 85, sunny, and I'm grilling. Boom."

"The beer is light golden and transparent with a half inch of pure white head. Aromas of grain, bread, corn, adjuncts. Not as sweet and off putting as the BMC highly marketed crap that is seemingly everywhere. Grainy with some cereal-like character. Clean and refreshing. Basically, exactly what you would expect from a decent adjunct lager. Ok."

"Every time I see a bottle or can of Pabst Blue Ribbon, I feel like I'm time-traveling to the days of the Grover Cleveland administration (the first one), since the recipe probably hasn’t changed since then."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Oh my what a beverage. You look at the can and you see words, many words. I like to pour it into a glass or a sink drain. When poured a rush of wild tobacco, dust, and titanium come directly to the nose. I like to wait as the head dissipates, which takes seconds, if not milliseconds. Then it's the time for a nice little sip. Oh my word, undernotes of pure sunbathed turtle shells in a stream, or a creek perhaps. Wonderful. I think the proper setting for this drink would be on a porch or prison. Highly recommended and would drink this everyday if I made much less money."

"All kidding aside, Pabst Blue ribbon is a great american lager. Enjoy with a rib-eye steak with garlic whipped potatoes, or with waffle house hash browns (smothered and covered) and an American Spirit cigarette. Beware, the sound of a PBR cracking summons hipsters from miles around, but will also earn you the respect of any man over 60 who has ever worked in a steel factory. And Clint Eastwoood. So grab yourself a PBR, and don’t look back. You may be listening to vinyl records on your portable turntable at a Starbucks in a few months, but then again, you might just be taking in a part of American history. Enjoy."

"around. For the price the beer is quite  good with flavors of corn with a refreshing taste that makes it an ideal beer to enjoy on a hot day. There are better beers of course, but if you're low on cash and want a cold beer, then this the perfect beer to buy. Pabst Blue Ribbon pours a light yellow with plenty of head. For what it is, it's one of the better American beers on the market, and it is far better than the BMC garbage."

"Awww good ol pbr, the old faithful of cheap beers for me. Drank plenty of pbrs back in the day and im not afraid to admit that ill still crack open one of these from time to time still. In my opinion this is the best cheap beer i've ever tried, if you're on a budget this is the one to choose as it actually resembles a beer and not grain flavored seltzer water as i think some of the other cheap beers do. The taste in pretty decent, it's malty and has a pretty good traditional lager taste and feel. It's got a lot of carbonation, which i like. Anyway for like 5 bucks for a six pack of tall boys you cant really go wrong."

"Pabst Blue Ribbon, Pabst, Blue Ribbon, PBR, Pibber, whatever you wanna call it. This beer used to be cool. Weird right? Now this shit is everywhere and it drives me nuts. I can't stand the mega branding of it with it's hipster ""street cred"". It's alright to drink but now I just get headaches and feel like donkey dump the next day. It sucks when a bar sells tallboys for so cheap and Buds are a dollar or more for a regular bottle because then I drink these durn thangs and feeeel it, man. I used to drink it a lot on tap but I don't think that will really happen anymore. It's good but gives me pain."

"I liked this beer but it was just not my favorite beer so far. It had a smooth taste. The smell of this beer was ok. But it just was not my favorite beer. It had kind of a strong taste to me wich was good but not my favorite beer. I think the draft tastes good as well. I would not mind having it again but it just was not for me."
"I drank quite a few P.B.Rs back in the 70s. After thirty years, I've, Just recently, revisited this beer. Except for a little bit of of the adjunct cereal debacle, its a pretty refreshing lager. The malts stand up to the corn invasion quite well. It's cheap and It's drinkable, some times that means a lot!"

"I think PBR is a nice beer for its style. I am comparing it to light-bodied, large-brewery products. It is my goto, hot-day-in-July light beer. (No, it does not say ""light"" on the can, but think of it that way and appreciate it for that role.) I do not taste any of the metallic off-flavors I often find in other mega-brew light and standard products."
""
"I would not recommend PBR for anyone looking to drink something special, but I can't really denounce it either. If you need to buy bulk PBR is better than Budweiser or Coors."
""
""
""

"Pabst Blue Ribbon aka (PBR). This brew is brewed by Pabst Brewing Company, with an ABV of 4.74%. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. PBR looks like every other American style lager on the market. Not saying that is a bad thing. Pabst blue ribbon has a nice smell. You pick up on grains and malts. There is also some sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The taste is smooth and rich. There is nothing bad about this brew. Pabst Blue Ribbon has flavor and smoothness. All around Pabst Blue Ribbon is an american classic beer. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3.5 out of 5. I would get this brew again."

"What can I say about PBR...it is still the best American Adjunct Lager (macrobrew) in my opinion. I have had them all and PBR is the best by far...I like to cut a Guiness with a PBR or Old Milwaukee to get poor man's amber lager... some folks like to bash cheap american style brews and I was once one of them until my WWII decorated grandfather reminded me that drinking cheap american beer and eating spam sandwiches is why we won the war! Made men out of boys faster than the Germans!"
"Had not had a PBR in maybe 20 years but someone left one at my house during a fire pit so I figured I would give it a review. Poured it out of the can into a tulip. Not a bad looking beer, great head with a light golden color. Smell reminded me of college, immediately had me remembering all the good times. Taste was not bad at all, smooth and even with at least a little flavor. Overall I was surprised, I enjoyed it. I think I will put the rest of them in the fridge and drink on another day sitting outside."

"Wanted to try Pabst Blue Ribbon for the first time and I must say that I am rather disappointed, considering how many people I spoke to think that it is a great beer? I purchased it as a 6 pack of 16oz Cans and I know for some, this is a mistake over purchasing the bottles. Granted, with this in consideration, I find that the taste of this beer is too watered down and very bitter tasting, but I do like the kick from the higher alcohol content it has. If this is all that it has going for it, I would rather just go with a cheaper better tasting beer (ie Pearl Beer or Lone Star), add a little vodka to it and Whaaa laa! A beer that tastes better and has plenty of kick to it!"

"Overall: PBR is an American classic and I believe rightfully so. There is nothing ’exciting’ or unusual about it, but I enjoy it for simple pleasure when neither my palate nor my pocketbook want to be challenged."
""
""

""
""
""

"This beer is a quality beer if you aren't looking for anything special. A two finger head when poured, but that quickly disappears. When you drink it is tastes alright, but you will quickly discover that the after taste is the biggest downfall of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good for an Adjunct Lager, especially at the price. It is too bad that the corn aftertaste messes up what is otherwise a surprisingly good beer."
""
"Overall this is Your typical adjunct lager. I normally don't review brews like this but after reading in some forums that PBR was a preferred cheap beer i thought i would try it. Waste of time. Its your typical corny american adjunct lager."

"When poured into a tulip (the way absolutely nobody drinks this), it comes out clear yellow with a fluffy two finger head that dissipates quickly. Carbonation streaming up the side of the glass lends a champagne look to the beer. When first poured, there's a nice banana smell from a few inches away, but as you get closer, notes of creamed corn and wet cardboard come out, along with clean pale malt. At the front of the tongue it's pretty sweet with malt flavor, then it goes down watery without much flavor at all. There's a bit of corn on the back end but it's inoffensive compared to some other adjunct lagers. This isn't the worst choice you can make when on a tight budget. I still prefer to grab a Yuengling, which is in the same price range but isn't available everywhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: PBR takes a beating because it's the official beer of annoying people, and a lot of folks treat it like it's the beginning and end of beer. But it's perfect for what it is: cheap, all-purpose American lager. You're not drinking this because you want to agonize over its hop profile; you're drinking this because you're in a bowling alley and it's $2.25 a pint on draft and that's a square deal."

"O - in trying to keep style in mind, I still had a hard time enjoying this one. I wouldn't buy this again; the only reason I bought it was to make a cheesy potato soup that required a light bodied beer..."
"I want to like this beer so much, but can't. Poured into a pilsener glass, PBR looks light yellow. The head is quite large, but dissipates quickly. Carbonation is lively which aids the overall positive mouthfeel. The taste is sweet malt and oats and cooked corn. It's the cooked corn aftertaste that just make this beer unpleasant to my palate. The body is light. I'm not going to rave about how much better PBR is compared to other adjunct lagers because it's not. IMO it's the cheapest beer for a reason (besides not spending any money on advertisement)."

"Overall: I'm not entirely sure why this beer scored 'poor' - it's a decent, refreshing lager as good as any other standard macro, for a much lower price than many others. It isn't going to blow your socks off if you're after something special, but as an every day lager, it's pretty much unbeatable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Sure this may lack the complexity of the smaller production brews we're more familiar with but I don't understand its 'poor' overall rating. It's refreshing and not a flaw to be found, and I haven't had any BMC in forever but it tastes better than I recall those being"

"It tastes like American beer. Grainy, malty, not too many hops in there. I love a good IPA, but this is simply another thing altogether, and cannot be compared as such. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a bit of fizz. Overall it's my old standby. What can I really say?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is what you reach for when you're strapped for cash, this is what you recommend a friend brings over in huge quantities because you don't wanna be the guy who forces your friends to shill out $50 for 4 6 packs of microbrewed beers. probably the best of all the ""down and out"" beers, honestly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit 3/14/15: FWIW my PBR sample beer may have been a old packaged poorly stored batch. No ""born on date"" shown.  My reference beer is fresh home brewed."
""
""
"Above average Adjunct Lager, hops are mild but they are there and it has a nice mild spicy touch. I should’ve given a higher rate if were to measure it just against its style."
""
""
""
"O: Pretty gross, to be honest. I like to stand up for some of the less appreciated lagers when I can, but this isn't that great. Won't try it again."
""
"Pours a pale golden yellow in color with a 1-finger white head that settles down to just a small layer on top. A good amount f lacing is seen actually. Lots of tiny bubbles but good carbonation. The aroma is of sweet corn and grains. the taste is about the same with no bitter aftertaste. Actually this isn't bad and so much better than regular of Bud. A old beer that has been around a while also. Overall, I like it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty decent example of an American adjunct lager. If I'm feeling like slumming, this is as low as I go, which really isn't that low. This beer clocks in with a better rating than many crafts. Despite the hipster obsession with how ironic it is to drink PBR, this stuff really is just working man's beer...no pretentiousness, nothing fancy, just water, malted grain, and hops. It has a light bready flavor, slightly sweet, with a medium mouthfeel."
""

"Overall: No off flavors that I find in most adjuncts. Crisp and very drinkable. My favorite American Adjunct Lager, but that's not saying much."

"This beer actually tastes like BEER. Not some lousy, fruity elixir. I thoroughly enjoyed every sip of this beer and I have no doubt that, based on taste and price, that this beer will be one of my regular beer brands for decades to come. It had a very nice flavor, but it was in no way overpowering like some beers. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who likes the taste of beer and likes to save money."
""
""
""
"In my opinion this is one of the better american adjunct lagers out on the market. it is crisp, clean tasting and refreshing. I didnt bother to pour in a glass and inspect color and to release its smells because it smells like a american adjunct lager without the burnt vegetable smell like you would get with a miller high life. I believe that pabst has a one of a kind unique flavor and for what it is. Its worth trying, even though it is $5.99 a 4 pack of 16 ounces."
""
""

"Meh - characterless and watery. Looks about right, while the aroma and flavour are virtually absent. Average body for a macro. I'll damn it with faint praise and state that there weren't any obvious off-notes or flaws; it's just weak as hell. Thirst-quenching but no need to hunt it down."
""

"near beer at its finest. I mean who doesnt like to slug a few pbrs at the family picnic. this beer reminds me of the old days watching my uncles and pops throw horseshoes and tip em back at the family parties. American beer at its finest. Union Made!"

"It's not the worst... but it has it's place.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - As far as AAL's go, it's pretty respectable, overall slightly below average. Not my favorite, but definitely wouldn't turn one down if in the right frame of mind."
"Pretty good. It tastes like there is a lot of corn in here. But its done in a way that is not harsh or really that bad. The mild floral hop flavor really sets this beer apart from its peers in this category. This is a decent beer at a great price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As far as cheap beers (Miller, Budweiser, Coors, etc) are concerned, it's probably one of the better ones. There is some flavor and slight bit of hops in PBR and it doesn't just taste like watered down beer."
"A very nice, drinkable and refreshing beer, that also offers enough taste. One of the better one from its homeland."
""
""
"Pale straw in color with a foamy, frothy white cap. Nose is vegetal, corn husk, barely discernible noble hop aroma detected. Goes down extremely smooth with sweet corn being the dominant flavor, graininess is smooth and soft, no hops in flavor but then again I didn't expect any. Highly carbonated with a medium thin mouthfeel. Let's be real; this is damn tasty beer that snobs refuse to credit. If you're part of the crowd that only responds to Heady Topper, Founder's Breakfast, or Bourbon County, then enjoy your craft beer supremacy. As for me, I'll take a PBR any day of the week and twice on Sundays. The best cheap all-American lager on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"That being said PBR pours a watery yellow. Like a pee after a night of drinking. (Not the morning after, that would be much to dark. The smell is that of a beer smelling beer. The flavor is like that of a light beer, but you add the taste of the aforementioned urine to the lager, to flavor. The mouthfeel is that of a a PBR. I don't see why you need me to tell you this. Who hasn't had a PBR at one point or another?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An easy beer to drink. Drinkable and fabulously dry. That is my only complaint. It is drier and drier and leaves the mouth dry without any citrus to refresh it. Light overall and a light bitter to keep the palate engaged. A touch sour in the middle as it warms. The worst you can say about this beer is that it becomes a bit bland after a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably the best (in my opinion) Adjunct Lager there is. I'd rather one of these than a Bud Light or whatever any day. It's very refreshing, and tastes good for what it is. Overall, it's pretty decent as a beer, especially when you realize it's competition being the other adjuncts. Definately my go to beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent beer if all you have is a gas station to buy from."
""
""
""
"PBR is nothing groundbreaking for sure. It's pretty simple. Light, drinkable, hoppy and fresh with just a little maltiness, this is a great go to when you want something cheap but drink worthy. Much better than the big three for sure and when it's often in the same price range and even the only other option given some places, it's the obvious choice."

"Sampled on tap at a Calgary pub. Another ""big name"" adjunct lager in the US, brewed by Sleeman's here in Canada. Slightly darker in color than many of its contemporaries, the color of well-cured hay with a lot of white foam. Smells of boiled grains with a corn sweetness, and tastes much the same ... Bland breakfast cereal, perhaps a hint of apple or other sour fruit. Less corny than many other adjunct lagers though, tilted towards a grain husk astringency and highly carbonated. The bubbles provide a crisp and dry finish that actually gathers steam as one proceeds through a pint. Standard macro-lager watery body; overall effect is that of a bitter and slightly sour grainy soda. Flavors are mellow but the carbonation is not. Fewer off-flavors than many of its peers (e.g., little DMS that I could taste) but some metal does emerge as the beer warms. Drink it quickly, if at all. In all honesty its not terrible and should probably be deemed a decent example of the style. I actually like more corn sweetness when I drink this style. This one gets astringent after a while, as is the case when more rice is used."
""

"Found a can of this golden nectar under my couch while looking for my ferret. Poured the majority of the beer on my girlfriend in the heat of passion (she asked me to). Left a sticky residue all over my ninja turtles pillows. I cleaned them though and they are good as new."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"honesty for the price, you cant beat it. Better than miller, bud light, Coors, and the others. Taste is some bitterness, smell is a bit grain like, and some hops. Nothing that would blow you're socks off. Pretty mild body. Nothing bad to say in the brew I had. You must give it try."

"This is my go to beer. I try a bunch of beers and always come back to PBR. Its already one of the better AAL's out there. The mouthfeel is decent, it's not strong and does the job. no chemical taste or weird flavors. It's on par with Budweiser and you get a free 6 pack for the same price. Can't say anything bad about Pabst."

"Pours a very light straw color with a thin white head, which disappears quite quickly. Smell is somewhat unpleasant, with none of the grassy smell I would expect, more of a damp, slightly rotten hay aroma. The taste is an empty, ricey taste with some citrus notes. The flavors are very simple with not much going on. Mouthfeel is very thin, though the carbonation is pleasantly refreshing."

"How does one of the absolute cheapest beers on the market fair in a craft world, not so well. However, taken in context it's a underdog that might surprise. It's not the best looking brew, pale yellow with a thick white head. It smells like a typical macro lager with corn and bread in abundance. The taste is also similar to the other macros, however I feel PBR is the bitterest up front. Really, the thing that seperates this the most is being a couple bucks cheaper than the already dirt cheap macro world."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Feeling rather nostalgic, I ordered a longneck at the local watering hole. Having not had a PBR in about 30 years, I was surprised at the familiarity of the first sip...nothing special here, just a very average brew you can pound-down on the cheap. It definitely helps to have it ice cold, and be really thirsty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is just another cheap lager that fills the ""I can slam a bunch quickly"" bill that justifiably lets the rest of the world make fun of American beer. I'm prepared to get flamed for this truth."
"I took a chance when I bought this for the first time but I have made it my favorite ""regular"" beer. Give the beer its fair chance and you will be surprised."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Well after trying other BMC's this is pretty high up."
""
""
"This beer serves the purpose of getting you drunk"
""
""

"This is a very simple beer with more flavor than you get with Bud, Bud light, Miller lite, etc. It goes down easy, but has at least a modicum of flavor, and is well worth the money if gotten on sale. I think I prefer it in the can though."

""

"Golden clean color in the glass and smells like a good cold crisp PBR should. It tastes like a good day on the river or getting face shots with ur bros and the mouthfeel is thirst quenching and refreshing. Overall its the best cheap canned beer you can buy and the can says nothin but freedom!"

"Pours a medium straw to yellow color with a smallish bubbly white head that slowly dissipates. Light sweet grainy malt aroma with just a hint of corn and light fruitiness. Small bit of floral hops aroma. Sweet almost honey like malt flavor with a bit of fruity bready graininess. Very little hop flavor but a firm hop bitterness. Light to medium body with a spirited level of carbonation that pricks the tongue with every sip, and a sweet slick watery mouthfeel. Worlds above the last beer, decent enough and probably close to style, but a bit boring."

"This beer comes straight from the gods. with the best flavor i have ever experienced . with a golden piss color pour, it keeps screaming back for more. with a amazing head that you cant beat.when it hits your lips its like getting a kiss from baby Jesus, i cant stop drinking it and i probably wont till my liver fails. ALL HAIL PBR!"

"All in all, I would have to say that this is my favorite cheap beer. If I'm ever low on cash flow and can't afford to shop around on beer and try new things/experiment, then I can just go to PBR for the time being and be fine with it!"
""
""

"I don't know why this beer gets such a bad rap. It is by far the best tasting, mass produced beer in the USA. It has a fresh, clean, refreshing taste. On tap, this beer should out sell all the other mass produced lagers. I always have a twelve pack in my fridge - next to a few local IPAs and something new in a growler - and I find nothing strange about that."

"A clear yellow, very foamy head that quickly dissipated, min to no lace S very grassy, citrusy sweetness. T lots of sweetness, corn and cheapness. M easily drinkable mouthfeel, well carbonated, made to be chugged, or at least drunk without thinking, sweet cheap beer aftertaste O Not the worst beer ever, but definitely not challenging to the pallet in the slightest.

"anyway,as far as looking to mass produced American Macro Lagers for Originality,Tons of Flavor,Choice Hops & very well crafted brewing in general,you would pretty much be wasting your time,because you are just not going to find it,thats what Micro Breweries and Cratf Beer is for,but I think American Mass produced Macro Beers have their place too,they may not make any beers you can sit down with and enjoy while pondering just how the brewer created such a masterpiece of brewing Art,but they taste pretty damn good when all you are looking for is an Ice cold one to quench your thirst, Cheers and Peace2all:)"

"Overall, NOT worth the hype. I guess maybe maybe better than like Miller and Coors but not by much. I think the overwhelming malt is a bad thing, but in this case at least it does have some flavor compared to other adjunct American lagers. Actually, I would only recommend it to get drunk off of, it is cheap and “high” in alcohol content compared to other beers of its sort. CHEERS!"

"Overall one of the finer choices for inexpensive lagers. Refreshing on a warm summer day but not necessarily the most flavorful option out there."
""
"For the price you could definitely do much worse. It's easy to drink, with a sweet malt flavor and a slightly bitter after taste. Not the most flavorful beer, but not as bad a many beers in the same price range. Not bad for a hot summer day or if u are planning on consuming at least several beers in one siting,"
"This beer, one of only lagers I will touch after being showed the ""craft beer light"". Any thing including water( 10.59 for 18) is a price that cannot be competed with. I spent most of my teen years and alot of my young adulthood strictly only drinking the light but mighty pbr, probably more than most would like to admit. If I was to go to a place that only had lagers or light beers this one be the only one I'd drink. If the government was to go ahead a prohibit the art of brewing craft-style beer and milwaukee was to discontinue pabst I'd probably quit drinking or become some sort of wineo or scotch monster. As for now craft beer is still in production so me and pabst won't be ""hooking up"" but if I ever find myself in arkansas again I will have a go to outlet. Much confused respect for you pbr keep on keepin on."
"O: This one crushes the ""Big Three"" and is a solid American Lager in its own right. While I don't praise Pabst Blue Ribbon too much, I look to it when I want to change things up a bit and have a Plain Jane lager. An excellent choice outside of craft brews and always satisfies on a hot day."

"Really light color. Couple shades darker than dark lemonade. very light, not so pleasant smell like water and flour. Taste is watery with that kind of wheat flour taste. Kind of a sour after taste. Not really a good beer but it gets the job done. Not the worst beer out there. there isnt really much of a mouth feel."
""
"not a bad beer. there's a reason its been around since the 1800s. refreshing and light but has some flavor. unfortunately, i've read that it now contains GMO corn and GMO corn syrup so i may have to shelve it until they change their ingredients, otherwise, it was good drinking you."

"Smells kinda like cheap stale beer and water. A bit of a sweet and sour thing also. Pretty neutral flavor. A bit sweeter up front, but then a hit of sour/gross and a big bite of carbonation come in and scrub the palate to the finish. Stale beer, water and infected cider are the only flavor descriptors I can think of. Short, but not very pleasant finish keeps me cringing till the end. This one might actually be better in the glass than it is out of the can. So many beers in this category get away with just being inoffensive and flavorless, but PBR doesn't quite pull that off for me."

"Today's PBR is NOT the PBR I choked down on in my college years. It is by far one of the best domestic beers on the market. I can not say if they changed the brewing method but the taste or my taste buds have changed. The appearance is medium gold. Smell is slightly sweet. Taste is now lightly bitter ending with a mild sweetness. Overall, I would say a clean mild lager but lacking robustness of a full bodied lager say like a Foster's Lager. However, in my opinion surprisingly the best mass produced American beer. Bottoms up!"

"Poured a clear yellow with a finger and a half white head that stuck around quite well for an AAL. Really, the appearance was quite nice, I can't really fault the beer there, especially rating to style. Scents of lager yeast, some slight malt and a lot of maize adjuncts. Standard to the style, nothing special, but nothing terrible like Corona or Coors. The taste followed the scent. Lager yeast, a slight hint of malt and a lot of maize. But it also had a decent amount of hop character for an AAL which kept it from being the sweet mess that many examples of the style gravitate towards. The mouthfeel was light bodied with high carbonation. A classic AAL, like the rest. Overall, despite the fact that it is indeed a swill AAL, and a cheap one at that, it tastes better than the more expensive Budweiser, Coors and Miller and beats it's price competition Rolling Rock by a wide margin. It's not a good beer, but it's also not terrible. I can see why the hipsters drink it like water."

"An enjoyable adjunct lager. About as American as they come. The biggest problem I have with Pabst Blue Ribbon is it's small window of life. Personally I feel like the beer if not cared for well will get skunky and gross quickly. Keep it cold. Very cold and you can enjoy it. I actually prefer it out of a bottle or on tap than a can. But if you don't have either then a can works fine."

"While I don't seek out or purchase pbr on a regular basis, it is easily my favorite of the mass produced offerings. It often finds its way into the hockey locker room for post game consumption and is always a welcome sight. Rather than trying to convert the group into craft beer lovers, and i have tried, I now prefer to succumb to the common ground that is PBR, and occasionally it is glorious."

"Whenever I go to a concert, this is the beer I drink. I'm always excited to give PBR one more chance as my favorite cheap beer, but it never impresses me. PBR is an extremely heavy beer and would not even consider it a session beer. I'd still rather drink Coors or RR for hours on end."

""
""
""

"Overall: This beer is a classic, but probably because of its enviable price point. I paid about 36 cents a can in a 30-pack, and there's really no beating that. For that sort of price, the beer tastes as good as one can expect. I would certainly buy this over BMC stuff in terms of actual flavor, since, though minimal, the flavor profile in this beer is notably more developed than something like Busch Light or Natty (as far as cheap beers go)."
""

"I had this in both a bottle and a can, and I must say, I was very impressed, its appearance is very fine looking, like you would expect a beer to be, smells like beer, good amount of hops present, taste is very good, especially for the price you would imagine this to taste like water, but it really doesn't, Pabst uses alot of hops, and very exotic ones at that, not like its an exotic beer, its taste like beer, but it is rather quirky tasting, damn good though. and mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, overall I think this is a good beer, and a beer's beer at that, they use alot of good ingredients in making it and I think it runs circles around its more expensive rivals like Budweiser, or Corona. I also believe if you dont like this you probably dont like beer, Everyone needs to try this beer, at least once in there life's"

"overall, this adjunct american lager is not bad. it has an interesting corn syrupy characteristic which i personally find enjoyable. obviously this beer isnt a craft beer and its not going to be loaded with hops-its a flavorful and enjoyable macro adjunct lager that i will drink again when the IPAs and pale ales get old. PBR is a refreshing and cheap way to enjoy a macro beer that has a little bit more going than the bmc's when you need a break from kickass craft beers. above average ratings in nearly all categories for this style of beer."

"Overall- Disappointing considering all the hype about this beer. I really can't justify this beer when they're so many better options out there. Yes, a better beer is typically more expensive but infinitely more enjoyable. To be honest though, I have been ""corrupted"" by the finer brews from the likes of Belgium (Abbey beers rock!) and Europe in general, although there's plenty of garbage brews that come from there too, but if anyone is simply drinking this beer only to be ""hip"" then the joke is on them because there are beers out there that are so much better."

"Final Thoughts: I finally found out why South Park lampooned this beer, but remain oblivious at how this has suddenly become a ""hipster"" beer. It's pretty much a slapped together cheap lager, which I wouldn't really wish upon anyone."

"One thing I have noticed is that the beer market has trends, just like everything else. A lot of the microbrews that were big a decade ago went the way of Zima, and I imagine that the majority of the ones popular at the store now will as well. One thing is certain though: if I want a real tasting beer without gimmicks and pretense, I can always count on PBR."
"Its like Liquid crack ! Great in 16 oz cans .Cant go wrong with PBR .Look @ inbev""The class action lawsuits filed thus far are based not on any scientific tests of the products, but rather on information from former Anheuser- Busch InBev employees who claim that the beer giant is watering down its products. These reports are coming not only from brewers and others who help make the beer, but also from employees outside of the brewing part of the business who report that weakening the brew is actually a part of Anheuser- Busch InBev’s corporate policy. This prompted California beer drinkers to seek legal action against the brewery and convinced lead attorney Josh Boxer to file the suit on behalf of consumers."""

"My friend returned from the kitchen with a cup full of what I thought was piss. He swore to me it wasn't, but I couldn't be sure. I smelled the ""brew", and thought it was for sure urine. But I was thirsty, so I took a big gulp. My brain was telling me to spit it out and look for some real beer, but I was too polite and not drunk enough for such rash actions. Smells and tastes like water that has sat in a plastic bottle for two months. If there is anything that PBR is good for, it would be Keg Stands. One can drink this like water all day, and receive a blue ribbon for being the most low-class drinker around."
" Overall I really don't mind a pbr at all , especially and ice cold one on a hot Arizona summer afternoon ."
""
"I find the best way to enjoy this beer is can poured into a glass. The appearance is a little nicer than most American style Lagers. Smell is a little grassy but it's not bad at all it's really kind of pleasant and refreshing scent not as skunky as most in it's class. The taste is very surprising with it being very crisp. You can pick up some grain but not overpowering. Very drinkable and no horrible after taste...the mouth feel is better than typical without the carbonation ruining your taste buds for the duration of the session. I think it's the best in it's class, definitely very drinkable, I liked it!"

"The PBR pours like a kellerweizen, piss yellow with a nice fluffy eggshell white head, though that skims down to a quarter of a fingers width quite quickly. The beer’s body is water clear with a torrent of bubbles working to the top of the glass. In truth, the beer looks a little like ginger ale in the glass. The beer’s head leaves a lacing of medium sized and tightly packed bubbles on the sides of the glass in sparse scraggly lines. On the nose, the beer smells weakly of sweet grassy malts with a touch of caramel. That stale grain smell that is found in most cheap lagers is also present here. It actually smells better than some of the other cheap lagers I’ve reviewed. It’s not amazing, but it doesn’t turn my stomach either, and it doesn’t have a completely bland character. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweetly bready with a touch of acid and the faintest touch of salt. The beer’s flavors begin with water, slowly opening into stale bread and grassy hops that turn hay-like. The finish is clean and quick, giving that slightly vegetal chemical sweet taste that all cheap lagers have. On the mouth, the beer feels thin, with a medium light carbonation that does fluff the tongue. The mouth is left wet after the beer passes. This beer is supremely drinkable, which is why it still exists today. It also leaves the mouth in flavor soon after it travels down your throat. Overall, this is PBR. It is cheap beer, but it is not offensive. It’s just pretty flavorless. To PBR’s credit, I find more flavor in it than in other comparable cheap lagers that I’ve reviewed (i.e. Red Stripe…). Buy a thirty if you want to cheaply drink yourself stupid. It is not the worst thing you could drink."

"Overall-tastes good with spicy and salty food, and it needs to be very cold to taste okay. Very average, I only buy it when I feel like being cheap. A true American crud beer, drinkable, yes."

"Overall I thought Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR) was an OK beer. The taste wasn't as good as I expected, but it was still not a terrible beer. The appearance of the beer was nice, but the smell was not that good. If I was offered this beer sometime in the future again I would have one, but I would not buy it."

"Shotgunned from a 16 ounce Tallboy. Appearance is lacking due to method of consumption. A light, egg shell, off white head builds in my mouth, runs down my shirt and all over my face, lingering on my beard. Very pleasing. Aroma contains hints of aluminum, tap water, and sugar. Also vomit and pizza, but that may be due to the setting. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and frigid all around. Very hard to swallow due to sheer volume and flowing pressure. The taste is surprisingly non existent. Hints of light caramel malt are muted by the loud chanting of ""Chug"" in a vicious circle around me. The palate is frozen. The belly is full. Overall a solid lager, I will enjoy another in a few seconds."

"Unlike the tasters before me; I wake up and I want a PBR. Full-bodied, gross and cheap; however, PBR delivers. It is a true lager, just as much as a Samuel Adams, darker, fizzy and just All-American. I'm glad its a hipster beer, I'm glad its its on the same level as bud-light but quite not. I drank a Hamm's, as cheap as a Hamm's is, it's great. It 's just like PBR, survived most of contemporary American history. Its supremely average and weirdly watery. It's not a stout, it's not a pilsner, it's not a porter...It's an American-styled lager, whatever that may be. PBR Reminds me of the 4th of July, it reminds me of Senior year, it reminds me of an alternative crowd, its reminds me of every beer game I ever played. I'll stay loyal PBR as a case and nothing else."

"This is a beer that I gladly drink and enjoy on occasion, but I don't think I'll ever crave it. Poured from the can, it has a light, sunny yellow color and a thick but light, whipped-cream-like white head. The aroma has a light, dry sweetness underneath, but it is predominated by a dull mustiness that is expected but doesn't veer towards unpleasant like many in the style. The mild cereal sweetness is more pronounced in the flavor and melds with a wheat-like, almost lemony tanginess. Unfortunately, the fine, prickly carbonation in this beer is often my least favorite part of American lagers of this style. Overall, though, it has more and better flavor than the mass-produced light lagers, making it a fine option to have for nights when you just want a light-tasting beer."

"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Pours a pale yellow with a gold tint. A finger and a half of white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of malt, cereal, light malt; light mineral and a hint of skunk (odd from a brown bottled beer). Pleasant flavor of biscuit malt, sweet wheat and light finishing hops. No evidence of mineral or skunk from the aroma. Flavor is light to moderate and well balanced for its style. Light bodied, as expected. A pleasant surprise for an adjunct lager. If I'm ever trapped in no-craft-beer purgatory, I will pick this up."

For some reason her in my lil corner of Texas they do not sell it in bottles. Hell, sometimes I'm lucky if I can find it at all. For a while I had to go to San Antonio to find it.

"24oz can at the Wintersun concert at House of Blues LA on 11/29/2012. I paid $10 for this. Drinking it out of the can so who knows what color it is. Smells like rice, corn, and pils malt. A little metal. Taste is inoffensive. Sweet and corny adjunct lager with grainy notes. Tame bitterness. Not terrible but I wouldn't recommend paying $10 for 24oz. This is difficult for me to rate. To style it's spot on, but it's a wretched style."
"Most known in America today as the ""hipster's brand", this is not, by any means, a great beer but it is surprisingly reasonably potable, at least at colder temperatures."

"PBR is a pretty average beer, but it's certainly the American adjunct lager of choice, especially for the price. This stuff is dirt cheap, and plenty of bars around will carry it.

When I found it in college, it was all ""Wow... there's a cheap alternative to BMC mainstream that actually tastes alright? Sign me up!"" Cans are good, but in a bottle, it shines a bit more. If you haven't had it, you live under a rock."

"I just bought a sixer for $6.48 because I was craving another PBR. The date on the bottles is 11-12-12, which is apparently the expiration date. I have to say, it tastes fine. Better than fine. Better than average. I like this beer. Plain and simple. It isn't bitter, and the malts are actually DECENT! Imagine THAT for an adjunct. I can see why this is a hipster beer, I think. I really like this beer ... especially because of its price point. Awesome stuff. Underrated, underappreciated."

"o - Overall not a good beer by any means; was actually surprised the overall rating was so high. I find it better than all other Miller products and better than Coors, and about on par with Bud Light, though slightly less watered down. Given the choice between this and a Bud Light I'd probably take a Bud Light, but I wouldn't really care either way. Not really sure why this is super popular with hipsters with so many better, also affordable options out there, but whatever."
""
""
""
"Beer starts and ends with an ice cold PBR. Yeah we all like a nice micro brew from time to time. Or having a nice stout or IPA when the mood strikes. But lets be honest there is nothing better than turning on the game, sitting back and cracking a Pabst Blue Ribbon. My only gripe is that Miller has chosen to skyrocket the price of this once working class beer. PBR is the best, hands down."
""
""
"Yeah, another American macro-brew, but this one really isn't too bad. Looks are decent and actually has some fair flavor. Nothing to really get excited about, but the choices for a cool, wet beer are limited, a PBR ain't a bad option to pursue."
"Follow up: 02/02/2013 Much to my surprise, Pabst Blue Ribbon has become my go-to beer of choice. All things considered I have come to love this brew! I continue to wonder why it took me over 20 years to finally give PBR a try. Give it an honest chance and perhaps you will, too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: It's PBR, can't say I give it a great endorsement, but when compared to every other AAL, it's fantastic. Definitely my go to hipster beer and a great bargain beer."
""
""
""
""

"O - Perfect beer for a BBQ or watching the game. The price is right and this beer is an old favorite that can pretty much please anyone."

"What'll ya have? Pabst Blue Ribbon! Pabst has a long and rich history in America, and it is one of the oldest beers commercially brewed in the U.S. Look at the can for God's sake. Red, white and blue through and through. Truly an American icon, and a classic taste among blue collar men everywhere. This is your grandpa's beer. Before the hipster craze set in, drinking this beer meant you were a working man, and you liked a simple beer. Simple beer for simple folks. But I don't find it so simple. I taste a very light, yet flavorful brew. A slight hops note from the get go, super bubbly mouthfeel that masks most of the flavor initially, but it follows through with that cold, crisp and refreshing yeastiness that we all know from American Adjunct Lagers toward the finish. Love it though I do, I will make one thing very clear. Don't ever drink this beer any warmer than ice cold, or it tastes like canned hay juice. I can tell you those of you who have not tried it how to best enjoy it. Bust your ass on a hot summer day doing some yard work, car work, or helping a friend move. Nothing beats an ice-cold Pabst at the end of a hard day's work. Pabst is an American classic, good for a budget beer, and perfect for any fourth of July barbecue. Great summer beer, and it never changes. It's not the best, not the worst. But hey, it's cheap, pretty tasty, and it's something everyone can enjoy. Great for parties, poker night, Cookouts...any occasion with friends and family fits the bill."

"for a cheapo, i dont hate a pbr. its become the beer of choice for the indie/hipster crowd, which i guess is a turnoff, but the beer isnt awful. it pours clear and yellow and soda-like, watery for sure, but not ugly like a coors light. it smells like a can of crap beer honestly, some aluminum, some stale malt, and that patented adjunct malt stink. the flavor isnt bad, because it doesnt taste like anything. really, scarecely a trace of anything that would make this a beer, hops? no. yeast? nope. i could be drinking a carbonated water beverage here. however, its lightness lends to its drinkablility, and probably its incredibly low price. i know bars where these cost just a buck, and most of a time its no more than two bucks. its certainly a decent budget beer, but it takes about a 12er to catch a buzz. oh well, thought id chuck in my two cents on this one while im having one."

"Overall: PBR is your basic, no frills adjunct lager. I personally find it preferable to Bud, Miller, or Coors, but I'm definitely not looking for a life-changing experience when I drink it. It's light, refreshing, and exceedingly drinkable. In other words, a successful adjunct lager."
"Very smooth and light, doesn't fill you up. Very inoffensive and not too fizzy, yet at the same time not too bland. Perfect for parties."
""
""

"For what it's worth, this is the best adjunct lager (perhaps sharing the title with Olympia). Everyone's had it, everyone knows what it's for. It's a great beer to bring to a big party and to order when money is tight. It's not a beer to drink for the enjoyment of beer, but for the enjoyment of the company that comes with it."
""
""
""
"One of the better Adjunct Lager; beats Bud, Miller and Coors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is exactly what it is supposed to be. I don't think I care to do enough comparisons to determine if this is the best of the style. As a homebrewer I know how difficult it is to consistently produce a clean light lager. Taste is good and it goes down easy."

"If you need a nicely priced beer for just everyday drinking, this is the one to choose. It's got a nice clear color, a decent lace after the head dissipates, a slight smell of hops, smooth feel, and a pretty good flavor to boot. It isn't going to win any contests—well not since 1893—but that's not what it's about. It's a simple beer for when simple is good. In cans or in bottles it'll always be refreshing. Makes an excellent session beer and pairs well with burgers, dogs, and BBQ. At less than $10 for a 12-pack it won't make you cringe at the register either. PBR puts the big names to shame."

"Overall: When I want a summertime beer, easy to drink, maybe for a picnic or a game, this is my first choice, even over Corona."
""
"Final Thoughts: Meh. Basically a slightly above average macro-lager that has some sort of cult following."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is light and airy, carbonation is good. Very bubbly. Seems to be another standard macro, though this might be slightly above average compared to other BMC swill."
""
""
"Overall: This beer stands above any AAL in terms of value to quality. Many other beers may tout finer quality ingredients and may follow intricate recipes, but thier results do not add up to the taste of this beer. Each beer type has a style that has a standard bearer. For American Adjunct Lager, Pabst Blue Ribbon is that standard bearer."
""
""
""
""
""
"PBR lacks the corny taste of three hops brewed miller lite, the drop in the ocean taste of the buds, and rarely tastes poorly or stale in the way that coors often does. PBR compares more to Blatz (which is more sweet), and less so to Shlitz (less consistent/often stale tasting), in the coupling of hyperconscious simplicity and standard beerishness. It's position as a sort of cult classic in certain cities/subcultures seems to maintain it's consistent, albeit low, standards. It is not produced and sourced to the degree that many similar beers are, but it is certainly widely known and accessible. In sum, it's the go to beer when I feel dehydrated."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It is an enjoyable beer on a summer day while doing some yard work or something. I would certainly drink this over others like Bud, Miller or Coors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste was mediocre, at best. It's just not worth it. It has a weak head, boring taste, and a sad little color. It's drinkable, if you're looking for a quick fix, but if you're looking for something to enjoy after a hard day's work, to relax, or to have a nice chat with your buds, this is not the beer for you."
""
""

"Overall - what an awesome brew. I love this beer, I don't give a damn if it is a macro, not a craft beer, whatever. I think it's a good beer."

"I see that the reviewers gave PBR a 72 rating & the Bros an 80 rating. And the reviewers gave Beck's a 67 rating & the Bros a 62 rating. Are you all nuts?!! Beck's now may be owned by InBev & brewed in St. Louis, MO. But I recently called Beck's brewmaster & he assured me that they were still brewing to the German Purity Law, which means they're only using water, barley malt, hops & yeast. I'm sure Pabst isn't doing the same. I know why all of you are rating Pabst higher than Beck's. It has nothing to do with PBR's quality. Rather, it's the ""pseudo-hipster's"" rating, i.e. ""PBR is 'cooler' than Beck's because it doesn't advertise & has the patriotic U.S. colors of red, white & blue."" C'mon everyone - get real. No way is PBR better tasting than Beck's. And no, I don't work for Beck's & I'm not German. However, I've brewed my own beers & know a bit of what I'm talking about."

"Overall, this is among my favorite cheap beers. As a recent college graduate, I have had my share of these low end brews and I have found that this has much more flavor than many of the other macro brand names. With higher income comes better beers, but I will will always look to this beer with a certain fondness."
""
"I drink this when i want flavor and a slight hop bite, and since i moved to a better pricing area...its also fairly affordable here...10 bucks an 18 pack....highly recommended from the bottle or on tap."

"Very light and easy to drink, but the flavor is nothing to write home about. Better than some other macro lagers, but not by much."

"O: Easy to drink, refreshing, and very sessionable - I could put down many of these when outside on hot summer day. This beer is much better than I expected, my memory had me thinking this was going to be pretty awful but it is much better than most BMC beers."

"O -- Um... does anyone know if Pabst cost less than bottled water in bars and restaurants? I know it's an old cliché, but the overall character of this beer is just the sort of thing that got me looking into beers brewed in the old-world ways. I honestly can't understand the draw to this beer other than its cost and that it just doesn't make you care about what you're drinking. Even the lightest bodied and mellowest micro-brews are more appealing to me."

"Very good cheap beer for consuming in Yellowstone where I work currently. Enjoy the can because it's 1.29 for a pint, the appearance was great when we were served it in beer school at UCF so it's got a good head that pours slightly better than budweiser. The smell isn't the greatest but is just above average. Mouth feel is above average and not over-bearing. Overall this is a great beer as a warm up for a great night out or for just chilling at home and watching TV."

"PBR: Summer is here, and it is time to cut back on the Double IPA’s and Imperial Stouts in favor of lighter fare. I will admit, I have not sampled many adjunct American Lagers, whatever an adjunct lager may be. Beer Advocate rates the PBR highly, so here goes. Light golden color, clear as a bell with a thin snow white head, this beer is light on aroma and flavor. Slightly malty with no hops to speak of, this drink goes down easily and hits the spot on a hot day when you need a cold one. I usually drink wheat beers during the summer, but now will add PBR to the mix. Refreshing and a nice change of pace. Who would think it would take a journey from my standard Odell 90 Shilling through a long list of ultra hoppy IPA’s, big Stouts, varied Belgian beers to finally come around to trying a PBR, probably one of the most popular beers out there. So it goes."

"Overall - A watery, easy drinking, tolerable beer. Appropriate for hot days outside while session drinking; such as while tailgating or the like. Nothing to drink when looking for something with a lot of flavor and feel though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is obviously not my favorite beer, but given the choice between PBR and the Bud & Friends cast plus boring ""imports"" (Corona, Heineken, Guiness), I'll take PBR if I'm planning to have more than one or two in a night. Forget the price and the stigma, try it, and you might just like it."

"If I want a cheap beer that has a little bit of flavor (rare this is ever my desire) and there is nothing else except the big three, I would choose PBR. If this was the only beer available to me, I would be very sad, but I would drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good summer beer to mow the lawn or take to the lake. No off flavors. Light, crisp and refreshing. Much better than that crap bud, miller (though highlife is not terrible) and coor's is churning out. Plus that retro PBR can just looks so good...just trying to fill 250 characters now..."
""
""
" This is a very standard yet pleasant American pale lager with slight adjunct sweetness but not so overboard that it infiltrates the taste completely it has a tinge of hop to balance the grain and slight yeast tinge in the taste. The finish is very clean and a crisp experience if every I had one. This is very good for the style and the overall value is high since this is the 2nd cheapest beer available at this location yet still is worth drinking."

"I guess if you had never had good beer before, this might appeal to you. Beers like this make me appreciate how much better craft and microbrews are."

"Pabst Blue Ribbon...The ultimate party beer. Bought a 6 pack for $4.97 at my local Meijer. It basically looks like your average American beer, Smells the same, But has a better flavor. Pabst is probably the easiest "" Cheap "" beer to drink. And at less than $18 for a 30 pack, You really cannot go wrong with it unless you're an uptight Aristocratic beer reviewer, In which case you should probably avoid it. The taste simply reminds me of Labatt Blue, However with a slight grape aftertaste, And somewhat less smooth"
""
"On tap in a pint at a dive bar, oh yeah. Pours a clear blonde with a small white head that quickly disappears. Aroma is corn and bread. Taste is exactly the same. Thin mouthfeel and sour aftertaste It sucks but still better than bud and miller crap.."

"Overall - I don't understand the revival this beer has had, especially amongst the hipster crowd. It's no better or different than any other dirt cheap american lager. In fact I taste no difference between this and Natural Light.... just another reason to hate the hipster movement."
""

""
""
""
""
"This is just the most basic and chintzy light lager you can find. If you're going to be repainting your garage or need to buy 144 beers to cover a Super Bowl party at your local AA office then it's passable but otherwise it's watery, and tastes only of grain. There are better starter beers (Coors, Boston lager, michelob, Stella Artois, Saporo, Dos Equis) and I'd choose one of them. No real reason to ever fall back on this one."
""
"Bright yellow with soda pop fizz. right in line with other AALs. It smells better. Floral hops are there, with that usual AAL base. What separates this from other bad lager is what seems to be hops. Its like a floral thing going on, and I like it. not the worst, but no great by any means."

"I'm checking out Radiohead in Mansfield, MA on 5/29 and I was looking for something cheap that goes down easy to go along with some good tailgate food. PBR it is. If you ask me, a tailgate party is not the place for double IPAs and Imperial Stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden pour with minimal head, bit of fizz hangs around for a few. Bit of malt, some grainy aromas and light sweetness in the nose. Fairly dry with a minimal sweetness at first, followed by a faint floral flavor. Very light bitterness towards the finish. Light bodied, very refreshing and crisp with average carbonation. Overall, an average brew, can't go wrong with this one!"

"All Hail D.B.S. (Death Before Sobriety)"
"This is my cheap beer and i am not even a hipster. I would prefer old style if it were more readily available but this is hard to beat for 15 bucks a 30. Its not dogfish head but if you are looking to knock back a couple after work for not to much cash you can do a lot worse than this."

"O: For the price, you just can't beat a PBR. Perfect with food or without. Nothing overwhelming, just smooth and delicious."
""
""
""
"it tastes faintly of stale corn, it smells like the water after washing out a glass that previously held King Cobra, but it's very drinkable, especially when barely above freezing cold."
""
""
""
""
"This is an exceptional American beer. Holds up extremely well against Budweiser, Coors, Miller and the like. If I had to pick between Pabst and them, I would choose PBR every time - based on just the taste; add in that it's usually a few bucks cheaper - even better. If you have never had PBR, you need to try it. MADE IN AMERICA - UNION MADE."

"As said before in other reviews... I judge this solely for what it is, an American Adjunct... that being said, this is a great beer when all you really want is a beer.. followed by another and so on.... light,crisp, refreshing,and it dosen't taste like that BMC swill.... Honestly, this is my go to beer when I need a break from all the great craft beers out there... It really puts me in sync with all the varieties available today..."

"Drinkability - Goes down relatively smooth and surely beats other lagers in the price range."

"Not going to get into the appearance, taste, mouthfeel, etc. etc. I mean its Pabst Blue Ribbon for god sake. Light, crisp and clean; a great beer to quaff down after mowing the lawn or at a picnic. Also a nice break from the uber-hoppy beer I typically drink Beats the big three by a long shot."

"O: An Adjunct lager is a light experience, this one is a little more interesting than most."

""

"PBR has always been a decent, but not great, adjunct lager. Appearance is light yellow with soapy head that lingers a bit, active carbonation. Smell has grain dominance but also slightly sour. Taste is grain/corn flavor with mild hops on the back. Mouthfeel is good and crisp, when cold very drinkable. I like to drink pabst from time to time usually in tall boy form straight from the can. Flavor seem weaker than I remember 20 years ago. The hipsters drove prices of pabst steadily up as the brand has rebounded over the last decade so stopped buying it for awhile. Post 2010 acquisition the prices seem to have dropped so the brand may be heading back to budget pricing."
""
""
""
"Overall this is a decent American Adjunct Lager. Nothing fancy and nothing to poo-poo either."
"The promising thing is that it is pretty darn smooth (and cold). I got to about 4/5ths through before I had to stop for the love of all that is holy. The carbonation would do well towards the end. It's just flat feeling now."

"Clean with a sweet hint of adjuncts with a nice crisp malt-hop balance. A nice session beer for everyone."

"Some cheap beers I don't get that sense, - with how my body responds."
"Overall - 3/5 - beats the hell out of Perrie"
"Poured this from a 24 ounce can to a shaker glass, stamped date of canning, February 2012. This beer is quite clear and of a light straw color. There is a lot of visible carbonation with about two finger of quickly dissipating, white foam. The smell is quite sweet with the faintest note of hops, the faintest. The taste is actually not bad, it tastes clean, refreshing. There are no discernible flavors other than the sweetness of the malt. Not much mouthfeel, besides high carbonation. If I had to choose an American Adjunct Lager, this seems like a good choice. This is not offending anyone."

"No after taste at all. Well balanced. Only problem is that one is never enough."

"I've had beer on the World Beer Tour & many great brews, but Pabst Blue Ribbon will always be my favorite beer. It's full of a yummy crisp taste with only the finest of hops & grains with a patriotic appearance, a genuine decent price in liquor establishments & when you drink it you can feel the pride of Milwaukee in your mouth."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 16 ounce can into a mug. Pours the color of straw with a thick white head. Plenty of bubbles stream up from the bottom of the glass. Aromas of lightly toasted barley malt, sweet corn, and hops greet the nose. It tastes much like it smells. It's a well-balanced flavor of lightly toasted barley malt, corn, and hops. It's crisp and clean. The carbonation is abundant, but not supercharged. The mouthfeel is light. It's very easy to gulp this down. It's a solid adjunct lager and one of my old go to session beers. PBR me, ASAP."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: For the style, PBR is pretty hard to beat. It may not be exciting or interesting, and it certainly is nowhere near complex, but this is a solid, simple beer than one can return to time and time again. It's definitely better and more satisfying than the likes of Bud, Miller, and Coors."

"Ov: It lacks true character, true distinguishable flavor and is nothing more than a party beer, beginner beer or beer of choice to ensure everyone in the party gets wasted.

"For an American adjunct lager, PBR is a pretty solid beer. With no glaring flaws and a fairly robust flavor profile for the style, this beer sure beats the crap out of Bud, Miller and Coors."

It's has a crisp look and mouthfeel that actually comes across as somewhat sweeter than normal american pilsners. I prefer on draft and very cold as when it warms, it becomes pretty harsh. take it for what it is and that's a tailgating/beer pong beer but ""free beer"" rules still apply."

"I honestly like this beer, as it seems to me as a classic American style lager, with a fairly crisp taste that takes me back to my days in college. Furthermore it is very refreshing as and is a good casual beer for a good price. It also had a light clean feel whilst drinking."
""

"O: This is not a beer I would choose to drink. However, it is better that Bud, MGD, ""Beast"" and Miller."

"The PBR has long been my go-to cheapo beer. It's great for hanging out at the party after your tastebuds are spent on a few good ipas, or as a refreshing ""nothing special"" beer on occasion.. I hate pretty much every other cheap domestic or Canadian beer. I respect PBR for being what it is - a decent tasting, cheap grain lager. It tastes crisp and clean, with a slightly bitter (not skanky) aftertaste. I wish I knew all the fancy words to properly explain myself on Beer Advocate, but I haven't studied up. That's why I haven't reviewed my favorite double ipas yet. A couple years ago when I was in Brooklyn, it really upset me to discover this beer had become ""cool"" with the hipster crowd. Then I thought about it, and realized I appreciate so many poor bastards having good taste."

"nothing bad about this lager. nothing outstanding either. one of, if not the best, adjunct lager on the market."

"Of the big ones, this isn't bad."

"This is a bad beer. When I was out of work and things were looking pretty bad, I had to stop buying good beer. I even tried to stop buying beer period. But after a while I wanted a beer so bad. So at the grocery store there was a deal on two fourpack tallboy cans for $6. Pretty nice. The beers to choose from were Miller High Life, Icehouse, and PBR. The first time, they were out of PBR and I got High Life and Icehouse. I didn't even like High Life in high school when I was a devotee of such fine brews as Miller Genuine Draft and Bud Light. It was worse than I remember. That's a crappy beer. The Icehouse was fine for that sort of thing. Not great, but ballpark quality. So the next time I was happy to see they had PBR. All of my friends had been drinking it during the hipster revival and they liked it so I thought I was in luck. Ohhh no. Oh no. Bad. Bad beer. It was worse than High Life. I don't know what people are thinking saying they love this beer. This is a gross tasting beer. It's on a level with Natural Light or Keystone or something else awful. Big disappointment. Won't drink it again."
""
""
""
"It is a slightly better than average American lager. I am surprised why so many people get excited by PBR."
""
""
"Haven't had this in a while, over a year. Expecting an average lager. Poured from 24oz can into pils glass. Very clear gold with soapy looking head, average appearance. Little bit of sweet malt on the nose but other than that, metallic and acidic. Taste is typical for the style but the feel is surprisingly slick and smooth without an overload of carbonation. Not too bad, not surprising that It's been so long since i've had it though."

"Served from tap into a 32 oz cold mug. Poured golden yellow with a one finger pure white head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, grain, and nutty. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, nutty, and very slight fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. This has been my guilty pleasure for quite some time if I am honest. There just seems to be something about it that keeps me coming back. This was my first return to all-you-can-eat wings and 32 oz specials so I figured what better fitting brew to go with... I know this isn't a popular style, but there is something about this brew that puts it just a rung or two above all the rest from this style. However, this one still falls very short of just about any other style out there, but what can you do when you are in a style that is destined to fail among the craft beer community. Worth trying even if you aren't playing beer pong. It might just surprise you..."

"Overall the best cheap beer I have had in USA, quite worth it."

"D- Well this one goes down almost as easy as water. Actually isn't much different than water in general though."
""
""
""
""

""
"If I'm feeling like just an american lager that's easy to drink, I'm going with PBR over Bud, Miller Lite, or (most certainly) Coors. This pours a straw yellow with a slight foamy head. No lacing on the glass. Smell is grainy, hints of corn and barley. Carbonation is just right to make this a really drinkable beer to have when washing down wings or a burger. Never really gave much thought to this beer prior to just a few weeks ago, but now glad I have a new ""basic"" beer to get when I'm getting a little burned out on deciding among different craft beers."

"No head or lacing with this one. Clear golden body. Neither interesting or exciting. Aroma is mild and mosty smells of fresh picked sweet corn. Some light malt. Flavor is more on the malt side and less on the sweet corn side. Light body and medium to high carbonation. Refreshing and very drinkable but not a good beer."

"its got a full mouthfeel that is smooth and malty. not bad for the money."

"O- Nothing super exciting here by any means, but I'd take this one over any of the other macros."
"O: For what it is, it's pretty damn good. Noticable hops and a good body give PBR the edge over BMC."
"Poured this American Adjunct Lager from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Poured a clear straw color, produced a average white head, retention was poor and lacing was minimal. The aroma has a slight hint of sweet malted grain and some grassy hops. Light in body, this lager is smooth and easy to drink. There is some slight flavor of malted grain and a suggestion that hops were used in the brewing process. At the end of the day, this is an adjunct lager- no better, no worse. It's very average and it easily rivals Budweiser/Miller/Coors, in fact, i think it tastes better. It will do in a pinch. Prost!"
"Look, it's a hell of a lot better than most AAL's, it's dirt cheap (about $13 dollars a 30 pack), and it's the beer of my people. It's what my dad drinks. It's the first beer I ever tasted in my life. Its great ice cold on a hot summer day, or with ice crystals in the bottom of a 40 while ice fishing. What's not to love?!?"

"O- This is my choice when I just feel like having a beer and relaxing without going the the big huge flavors of real craft beers. I consider it to be the best choice for a ""drink just to drink"" beer. I feel that I must rate it according to how it compares to all beers. But if I was comparing it to other AALs it would get all 5's across the board."

"Overall: Just an average Adjunct Lager, which is okay for me, as I do enjoy them to an extent."
"o. favorite of the yellow standard. a go to when i am simply in the mood to enjoy a good beer without having my taste buds challenged too much. even better because of the lack of awful gimmicks and hyper mass marketing. if only it were not so popular amongst hipsters i would be bolder about consuming in public. never shy in private though. quality."

"Overall, this is pretty typical of an AAL but it is slightly bitter than the usual BMC fare."
"There is a restaurant in Purdys NY called the Blazer Pub...some of the best burgers in the NY Tri-state area, and a regular stop for me. Well, recently they decided to go retro and are now offering, in cans, Schaefer, Ballantine, Rheingold and Schlitz....with PBR on tap. Whether you like these beers or not, the concept tickled my fancy and I decided to make my way through the list; revisiting some of the beers of my youth. None of them are great; in fact most of them are poor in comparison to the Captain Lawrence offerings that the Blazer also has on tap. But you know what? They were like an old friend, a blankie that I could hold at the bar and not feel self conscious about. Yes, I drank them all proudly and chances are, I will again."
"O - #2 on my ""Shit beer"" list. If I need beer and I only have a few bucks, or I need to throw a party, this is one of my go-to beers. Surprisingly satisfactory and rightfully deserves a spot on the top adjuncts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- PBR is a good beer for a great price. I get it for $1.25 a pint at the local bars, cheapest thing on the menu and probably the best ""go-to"" beer available in my area. When drinking on a budget, you can't really beat a good old peeber."
""
""
""
""
"If you're on a mission to get smashed on a budget, there's nothing better. If you're looking to sit down and enjoy a nice, hand crafted, complex alcoholic beverage, you may want to look elsewhere."

"O - i am kinda biased, but I really really like this beer, my favorite college beer"

"O: Not a fan of the style, but for the style it is good and is one of my preferred American Adjuncts. A great fishing and summer-time beer. Cannot beat the price; much better then many other beers of the style that cost much more. Of course I will return to this one. Again, for the style it's a good showing."

"From a can, poured into a dipple mug. Looks pretty damn good in the mug. Smell is nothing more than average. Taste, well from a can, nothing is too good. Mouthfeel, average. But as cheap beer goes, this is one of the cheapest and certainly ranks up their with the best of the cheapy cheaps. Holds it's own against most all Adjuncts."
"Extremely easy to slug down, and despite the simple and somewhat lacklustre palate, it stays far from being pedestrian or offensive. Sure, it's not a great, interesting, or exciting brew, but it's actually a pretty smooth ride, and all things considered, a relatively enjoyable one."
""
"O - To me, this epitomizes shitty American beer, the kind drank from coozies and sporting events and the like. Cheap. Not good. Honestly, if you're going for a cheap drunk, malt liquor is worlds better."

"I used to drink this beer with my best friend, Chuck, all the time. Rest in peace, brocephus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not even really sure why I'm reviewing this beer, but mostly because it is the best cheap beer for getting a buzz. Obviously nothing special here but this beer has a solid taste that you can actually transition to from more high quality beers. This beer is fairly drinkable for a good price and a decent flavor. My go-to-beer for heavier drinking if I still want some type of hop taste; leaps and bounds about mainstream light beers in my book."

"I’m not gonna grab a PBR if any sort of decent craft is offered instead but I’d definitely drink this one before a bud, coors, or miller to be sure. Hey, you could do worse!"
""
""
""
""
""
"What can I say? If I am drinking PBR, I am not expecting much. If I want something cheap and weak though, I would rather go with PBR than Miller Lite. I had some PBR in my beer fridge forever and I tasted more to see if it was skunky and worth keeping. It wasn't bad."

"24oz can. Drank from can just as a beer like this should be consumed. Decided to try it out to see what the hipsters find so appealing about it. Labeling is traditional american lager styling. Smell was very faint; what I did pick up was just like what any other adjunct lager smells like. Typical beer flavored water taste. Not as much corn in the flavor as some of the other cheap lagers out there. Lots of carbonation. overall refreshing if you drink it as cold as possible. Hardly any flavor. A good choice if you are looking for something cheap, fizzy, low abv, and don't want strong flavor."

"O - the problem I have here is rating according to style, but the adjunct style is generally no favourable .... so is a good adjunct lager an A within the style OR is it a C or less given that the style is generally crap? Average either way"
"overall; I must start by saying that I don't care much for this beer but considering the style, I am more than impressed..."
"Love this stuff! Cheap, but a hella lot better than any other American Lager! (i.e Buttwieper) I just picked up a 30 pack (times are tough) and was pleasantly surprised by the familiarity from my college days. It's been a while, but I have to say for a cheap beer, this stuff delivers...."
"dumped from the can into a pint glass. pours a clear golden straw color. a white head quickly disappears to leave a faint ring around the glass. smell and taste are both made up of faint grain and corn syrup. has a light to medium body. better than average carbonation and a smooth non bitter aftertaste. overall this is slightly better than most adjunct lagers, does not feel as watered down and thin as the others."
"O: good for the style, decent to me, however, I admit I tend to have this one in the summer backyard BBQ, nothing like pourin' it over the pig roastin' over the firepit"
"PBR is a very simple and enjoyable beer, a good friday treat beer. There is better beers, of course, but at a much higher price."
"O - A better than average american lager, but still only good for getting drunk."
"Looks like any other lager from america but has more flavor and body than anything that bud or coors puts out. smell is very much grain and corn but still pleaseing on a hot day. taste and mouth are one in the same smooth and easy. overall this is the budget beer of choice for my fridge every time needed to save a little green for the rent. ( or whatever bill needed)"
"This is one of those beers that is good for the younger crowd, one because its cheap and two when your young you really dont care that much about taste you just want to get drunk. but in my opinion this beer really isnt awful, but not the nectar of the Gods either. the smell of it isnt a good beer smell what so ever but the taste is right above average in my book"
"Why don't people understand that just because your dad and your dad's dad drank it doesn't mean its good. This beer shouldn't be shouldn't served, sold, or given away for free. This is pure butt pee in a can. Some one should petition congress and have there brewery shut down and burned. This a black eye on America's beer portfolio. I hate this beer."
"For what this is, its not bad. I barely ever drink AALs, but it seems that PBR is one of the only I can stomach. Would say its better than other AALs. Can only drink these every once in awhile."
"Plus I think a cooler full of Pabst, Shlitz, and maybe Blatz, would be a hit at a retro pool party or something"
"O: A very good macro, most likely the best one out there. There is always a few of these floating around in the back of the fridge."
"This is not in the running to claim the title of ""best in the world", but can compete for ""best mass produced"" and it has earned reserved shelf space in my fridge."
"Crisp, pale, grainy, malty lager. Easy to drink and kinda refreshing too. A very good lager, especially for the price that it is sold."
"M: Standard adju"
"O - I drink this once in a while because it's cheap and not BMC."
"Reviewed from notes. Enjoyed many, many times over the years and formally reviewed here for the first time as it is my king of the cheapy's IMO and I've been going back and reviewing some of my favorite old man brews of yore that I've put off while reviewing craft and import beers. Poured from 12oz can into pilsner glass for the purposes of this formal review for an informal brew. Pale straw yellow color pours a fluffy head of about and inch or so if you let it and you enjoy that sort of thing. Usual suspects smell wise for an american adjunct lager, corn mostly and mild sourness of yeast and bread. Taste is sweeter then most and goes down easy and finishes clean though their is that bit of aal funk to it as well. An obvious choice for a session beer, good and cheap no matter if it's can, bottle or draft and IMO creates a better buzz then High Life over the course of a session/night out. This was the standard american adjunct lager I came to enjoy over the usual BMC stuff thanks to dive bars, rock clubs and using it as the main ingredient in flaming Dr. Pepper shots at parties and not wanting to throw away the rest of the can when no one else would volunteer to finish the remains not used in the shot. Also great for making up beer bread and beer can chicken. I prefer the can to the bottle or the draft, both of which seem a bit more watery and rather tasteless where the can seems to have a bit more and the metallic taste IMO adds something as crazy as that sounds. Snobs and hipster's be damned, I enjoy this blue ribbon devil of cheapness."
"Of all the adjunct lagers this one probably comes closest to actually duplicating a pilsner."
"The beer as most everyone knows is a golden yellow like most macros and has a thin white head that quickly disappears leaving some lacing and little retention. I could hardly get any smell from this beer, so not much to be impressed with. The taste starts out with some corn and sweet malts and later get some hops that nicely balance the malts out. A very smooth, crisp and clean finish that makes this one of the very few AAL beers that is tasty and is also satisfying at the same time. A good beer to drink when low on money and in need of one."
"O: Not bad, but far from great. On a hot summer day, this would do a good job of cooling you off. However, as a beer, it is largely simple and uninteresting."
"most of your adjunct lagers are pretty much the same there is little difference in smell, taste, mouthfeel. that said as far as appearance, smell, and mouthfeel it falls in at average. where i think its a little better is taste which to me is most important and drink ability. a nice clear light golden color average adjunct smell sweet corn malt taste with a light mouthfeel and crisp carbonation. add to that a abv of 4.74 i think adds to the overall drink ability."
"O: I'm rather disappointed, don't get me wrong I wasn't hoping for craft brew quality, but I was hoping for a decent beer. PBR is barely above Budweiser as far a brews go. Oh well pretty average for an adjunct lager."
"This beer is just not good. I bought this because it has decent ratings on this site, but I hated every second of this beer. The appearance and smell are very boring a bland, nothing special at all. The taste is the worst part of this beer IMO. It is like water with a slight rice and corn taste on the finish. The mouthfell is very carbonated and boring. Overall this is a boring beer. It is still better than any BMC, but still not good at all."
"Overall, I guess it's a decent lager that's clean and refreshing."
"This came in a twenty four ounce can. Large oversized three-finger head that dwindled to virtually nothing in a minute or so. Pale yellow virtually see through the mug clear though not with perfect clarity. Leaves small number of small streaks of lacing. Smells like yeast. Thin watery mouth feel , can see taste and feel the carbonation though relatively moderate. The sweetness comes through most. I thought I could never enjoy cheap beer again but this is not bad for the price (about $1.40 for 24 ounces)."
"overall this is a decent beer at best in the value category but definitely not my cup of tea"
"I would say this is my favorite beer in the ""cheap beer"" category. I don't really expect anyone to be buying this beer to enjoy the flavor. It's cheap, and its drinkable. Good enough."
"heineken? fuck heineken. PABST BLUE RIBBON!"
"Haven't had one of these brews in a while, but a buddy handed one to me, and I'm not one to refuse a free beer. This was actually a lot better than I had remembered. Tastes like grains, malts, and rice. Mouthfeel is smooth, and the carbonation is good. This was ice cold so that helped out, for sure. Pretty refreshing. I'd probably go back to this one. Can't beat a 24 pack for 12 bucks."
"Hands down kills the other beers in it's price range and above. Just a great American lager. Grain, a bit of malt. Clean and refreshing. So much better than what the herd drinks. Do yourself a favor and grab a Blue Ribbon. The bottle is just freakin cool too. Cheers!"
"Enough carbonation to not taste watered down and usually surprisingly drinkable, though I'd never pass up something from even the lowest rungs of microbreweries for this."
"I was away on a beach vacation and I guess felt the need to take a vacation from all the craft beer I'd been having. Something about PBR in a can strikes both nostalgia as well as hipness, as many gastropubs serve it with a shot chaser. I'm not going to bother going through all the characteristics, as that's kind of a waste of time. I just think that every once in a while it's an interesting change of pace."
"It is what it is, and it isn't much."
"Hey it looks and smells like beer. Pale straw gold with a decent head and lacing. smell is clean and mildly hoppy with cereal graininess and light bitter notes. Taste has is much the same with light malt and crisp dry hops in the finish. Clean crisp feel that while light and thin does not feel watery. Not a bad AAL and much better than the BMC alternatives."
"For a can which comes out to less than a $1 per can, and the reputation that follows a cheap beer, the taste of this beer REALLY suprised me, quite a bit. The beer has a nice clean taste to it, with a clear corn-crisp to it, and a little wheat too. And what was that I faintly detected at the end? Yes, even had a very subtle hop charecter to it! The beer is very carbonated , as can be expected. All in all, this is a VERY drinkable beer, and one even someone as choosy as me, would go out and buy. A nice , drinkable, summer beer. A really pleasant suprise for how much it costs. If you are on a budget and looking for a beer on a dime (or even not), check out PBR!"
"Thought I'd give the old standard a formal review; Pabst and I go way back. Poured from a pint can into my trusty nonic. Nice white, frothy, two finger head held on for a bit but didn't leave much lacing. Nice pretty straw color. The smell was mostly grain and a bit of sweet malt; nothing special. More taste than Miller or Bud in my opinion. A nice cereal type grain taste and slightly sweet malt followed by a subtle but present hop finish. Nicely carbonated and refreshing. If I need a case of cans for camping, fishing, or a bbq I'll definitely go Pabst."
"O - You get what you pay for. At 8.99/12 pack in NYC that's a steal, and something I'd still take over a lot of things"
"Overall. Not too shabby for a macro. but still pretty macro tasting."
"O/D: What's there to say? Stick to the cans. It's a different beer in a bottle: worse."
"Poured a can of Hipsters Delight into my Pilsner glass. Rather aggressive pour yields a finger and a half of champagney head, straw pale gold body. Head dies quickly leaving a thin layer at the top. Lots of bubbles. Much more Pilsner-like on the nose than Budweiser or Coors. Nice grassiness, some biscuit, corn, some light generic hoppiness. Tastes light, grainy, a little bit of honey and corn. Refreshing. Mouthfeel is super bubbly, but on the creamier side of an adjunct. Reviewing for style, it's hard to beat."
"The best adjunct in USA today. Beats anything from BMC. I am from the north, so I might be biased. Pours a nice pale yellow with a little sticking to the glass. I enjoy the carbonation, keeps it easy to drink. I like it in cans, its easier to transport. With a beer like this its great when you want to take some brews along and you dont have a lot of cash. I with more brewers would put more of the basic four ingredients, and hold back more of the adjuncts, like Pabst brewing does."
"PBR is cheap… it’s intended for hipsters… but I will order this all day long. I would prefer this over any other domestic beer you throw at me. Well done for such a cheap crappy beer. (I say crappy in the nicest way possible, and from the reputation that this beer has been given over the years.) Bottoms up people."
"Minor guilt pangs as I'm a Rochester resident and somewhat loyal Genny drinker, but ""How do you keep them down on the farm after they've seen Paree?"""
"So, compared to other bad adjunct lagers, its decent. Smooth taste with no nasty sticky feeling, and not overcarbonated. Smell is a little nasty though, of cheap dry grains."
"Avoid at all costs!"
"Light and clean with just enough hop flavor to give it more character than the competition. Light on malt sweetness and when cold adjunct dms flavors are almost non-existent. Cult following is justified..Especially on a hot day. This is one of my favorite beers, and one of those that is as good out of the can as on tap. Enjoy."
"Poured from the can into my new Williamsburg Alewerks pint. Clear golden and fizzy with one half inch quickly disappearing foamy head. Smell was of light grains. Taste was upscale adjunct lager. Drinkability was easy. Good for what it is - a union made macro lager."
"Finally had one of these - sure, it is better than a Bud! It has average head retention for its style, nothing distinctive in the color or smell (go figure), but it's crisp, and you can actually taste some hops. Nice malt character - almost robust even. I had one on a hot day, so that must account for my impression of the mouthfeel. This is a good clean thirst quencher and a good American brew."
"Drink this cold! not because of hiding the taste but when it warms it loses some of that bite which makes the entire beer in my opinion. At 7.99 a 12 pack its a definite solid cheap beer though."
"This is a good, less-expensive alternative to full-priced American lagers. If a bottle, pint, or can is $2 -- or less -- at a dive bar, I will usually drink one or two."
"Overall very drinkable beer. I'll drink this when low on cash, or just outside, or anytime I just feel like drinking."
"I've had more cans of this than I am often willing to admit. It's certainly not a great beer, but it's not a bad beer. Considering how ridiculously cheap it is, it's worth having once in a while. It's certainly better than the ""heavy"" BMC beers."
"D - Not quite as bad as I remember it being (out of a can), but still rather unpleasant. I guess if I had to pick up a 12-pack of something to drink in one night this might not be last on my list..."
"I like to order/purchase PBR somewhat as a joke but I truly do enjoy it a little. I often get it when I see it on tap because it is the cheapest in the house. It goes down fairly easily and isn't as wattery tasting as most value brands. There's something about the can that just makes me feel good when I'm holding it on a hot summer day. Still, this beer is drinkable at any time of the year."
"Well lets be honest here, it seems that PBR always gets a leg up over all the BMC products. I would definately take this over a bud any day, appearance is pale yellow clear with a small frothy head that dies quickly after an aggressive pour. Smell is light buscuit malt some hint of sweet malt and a tiny wiff of hops. Taste is similar not much to talk about a buiscut malt with a tight carbonation that brings the small amount of hops out. Mouthfeel is thin and slick but not watery due to the high carbonation that affronts it with some fullness. Overall this is my go to super light lager, I can drink it and enjoy it and dammit that is what you are supposed to do with beer!"
"This pours a clear pale piss colored straw of yellow. Forms a big bubbly 2 finger head that turns to a small lace around the glass. Smells of sweet boiled corn, wet hay, maybe some olives (i could be reaching) the way an AAL should. Tastes like corn water, sweet sugary, a tad lemon bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel, hmm, well its not bad its like all beers of its style light easy to gulp up, however PBR doesnt not become offensive to me as it warms up as is with most Macro AAL's. Overall its ok, its cheap, and it taste like the way you remembered beer to taste... which is why you dont buy it anymore."
"Overall this beer is not anything too special, but at the same time it does stand out from most other lagers of the style. I would certainly recommend giving it a try."
"Overall: If it weren't for the fart smell, this wouldn't be half bad. If you're in the mood for something cheap without a whole lot of flavor, its not a bad way to go. Hard to beat the price too."
"An amazing beer to be certain. Nice levels of carbonation, no head, clean refreshing taste. Best served ice cold. It won a blue ribbon you know. Don't drink it warm, it will be extra nasty. Also, they put a best buy date underneath the can, so check for that if you are able to."
"Drinkability: I like PBR, but it is what it is: an adjunct. There is nothing really special about it; it is just another mass produced, cost efficient American lager. But it is one of the better ones."
"Well it's not super impressive, but for the style it's acceptable. And cheep, don't forget cheep."
"When it comes to domestics, mass-market, and cheap beers, this is by far the best of the bunch. Higher in alcohol content and beer flavor than the comparable beers, PBR is a great go to session beer that won't even remotely break the bank. The only downside is that hipsters have recently discovered the beer and claimed it as their own."
"O- For the style of adjunct lager, PBR is a bar setter! Not a perfect beer, but for something that isn't all malt, you don't notice it and there is some decent flavor and mouthfeel. I recommend this for sure and will definitely seek it out again....great price for a sixer and great beer for the style!"
"A college staple, and a long running favorite of mine when drinking meant needing plenty of beers to slam in a night. It sets itself apart from most in that style. A good case of pbr is great and rough when bad. That means hit or miss for this cheap adjunct."
"I like to drink my beer from a glass whether it comes in a can or a bottle but there is something about a bottle of PBR with the red white and blue and the no BS nature of what is inside that is akin to a P51 Mustang or a Stratocaster or the Chrysler Building that I can roll with it. Anyone who gives this beer less than at least a B should have his or her citizenship revoked before being told to go F himself."
"I think I see why this stuff is so highly recommended, it's actually pretty good for what it is. I don't think I'm hip enough to go out and buy a Mac or wear aviators without looking like a turd, but if someone hands me a PBR in the future I'll happily drink it. Within the style, I think it would be difficult to find something of comparable quality and price."
"Mouthfeel is a plus with sharp carbonation that really digs it's spurs into your tounge. Light body and so far the only real redeeming quality of this beer. All that being said I like the flavor of PBR and find it useful on hot dry summer days to quench a thirst for a brew. Not my first pick but not a bad one to have a full cooler of by the lake."
"Overall: this is a good session beer, drink 12 of them and you won't have a headache the next day, you will actually feel good."
"O - A very nice american style brew."
" The color is a light golden yellow, light head, a constant stream of bubbles flow upward. This has a light mouth feel. The taste is good, some grain, very slight bitterness, malty sweetness, a little dry, better than something like a bud or coors. Overall, a good drinking beer and a nice change up, although I can't help thinking of Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet every time I order this."
"O: A pretty solid american adjunct lager. Better than most that are readily available."
"Ok so you have to review this beer for what it is and I discovered that on the beach this weekend. Definitely got some bonus points for value. The beer pours a clear golden color with a finger of bubbly white head that dissipates rapidly. The aroma has bready malt notes. The taste is the typical clean bready/malty lager... but actually has some substance and balance, unlike the other cheap alternatives. the mouthfeel is like your typical lager... bubbly and somewhat dry. Overall, if you're going to drink a cheap beer, this should be it. I usually hate them, but in particular circumstances such as on a hot day on the beach going swimming and playing football, this definitely hit the spot and was the perfect beer for the job... I really was surprised I liked it so much."
"Best enjoyed in quantity at a dive bar. I wish the Hipsters hadn't taken over this brand with their self-loathing and wool-cap-wearing-in-summer tendencies."
"I can't help it; I really, really like PBR. It blows every other similarly priced macro lager pretty far out of the water for taste, and its spectacularly average beeriness is really tough to beat when you want one of something reliable on a weeknight. I can't in good conscience call it ""underrated," but if I only had one beer to drink in all seasons for the rest of my life, it just might be this one."
"We as beer snobs sometimes forget that simplicity is not necessarily a bad thing."
"PBR is a pretty solid beer. It's becoming one of my favorites. Moving through a six pack is pretty easy with its clean taste and easy finish. $15 bucks for a case of 30 is just a phenomenal deal which makes this a great beer pong beer. No one should be offended by the taste (or lack there of) this beer. If I had a friend that was just starting to drink beer, this would be one I'd introduce them to (because its better than most of the BMC crap thats out here)."
"M: light bodied and moderaty carbonated. Zero alcohol presense. Tastes like carbonated corn water, and goes down as easy as the best of them. This is, by far, the best AAL out there."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow color with a 1 inch white head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. Small random spots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of corn flakes, sugar, and slight cooked veggies. Taste is of sweetened corn flakes and other grains. This beer has a high level of carbonation and is very crisp and clean in the mouth. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and my favorite macro beer I have tried thus far in my life. A nice go to beer when you are looking for something cheap."
"overall, it's better than the ""big three", and probably one of the better adjuct lagers. but that's still a back-handed compliment, and not saying much."
"This is hands down the most underrated and unappreciated beer in American history. In most places you can purchase a 30 pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon for about the same price as a 30 pack of keystone light. And not only does it taste better than cheap college party beers, it tastes much better than many of its fellow American Lagers. I personally think that this beer blows Budweiser out of the water, and at about half the price, I'm not sure how you could argue that."
"T: Again, it's not undrinkable. It doesn't have a dirty or metallic taste, it just has a taste that I don't particularly think is appealing. Grain, corn and a hint of pale malts. Develops a bit of a yeast flavor as it warms, but remains drinkable."
"Verdict: While the hipsters may be more interested in the can design than the beer inside, PBR is actually not too terrible of a beer. I suppose the highest compliment I could pay this beer is that I could easily believe this was a poor attempt at an easy-drinking lager from a mediocre craft brewery."
"The mouthfeel is carbonated, thin and watery; it finishes dry, crisp, refreshing, and not filling."
"O - better than a lot of other beers in the style."
"Overall: A good step up from BMC. One of the better adjunct lagers out there."
"Pours a pale yellow with a foamy white head that dissipates to a fizzy layer of bubbles. Weak aroma of corn and grains, memories of pitchers and cheap dates. Tastes the same: corn, grains, watered down grass juice with the possibility of a hop sneaking in. Light mouthfeel, and goes down eeeeaaasssyyyy and ends with regret, but a still-full wallet. Should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and/or you're broke."
"Overall, this is exactly what I picture an adjunct lager to be. The biggest bonus for me is that the carbonation is manageable, making this actually drinkable as opposed to extremely gas-inducing. Beyond that, it's pretty bland but not bad."
"O) It may be my Milwaukee roots, but when it comes to drinking macro brews, which I generally avoid, I do prefer PBR."
"served in my garage into a plastic cup. Smells Like the good ol' US of A! corn, malt, with something sweet. Looks like nothing special and tastes the same too but these puppies all but drink themselves. Make sure you mow the lawn with a push mower or a zero turn or you will be a sixer deep quick. Great American beer should be kept in the back yard next to the horseshoe pits. It is the moped of beers fun to drink just don't let your friends catch you with one. Overall not a bad offering for the style."
"Overall, great frat beer, or maybe one to be used for a beer bong or a chugging contest. Not for me."
"EDIT: no longer true since I've found Narragansett Lager."
"Pabst has made a come back in main stream taverns here in Chicago. So I went throwback and tried it again for the first time. The color is golden clear with decent carbonation. The smell and taste are grainy. The mouthfeel is simple which makes it perfect for after lawn mowing type activities."
"Served cold, this stuff is actually pretty refreshing. Flavors are not very complex but it has a clean simplicity which makes it tasty. Slightly above average for the style."
"I don't usually drink a lot of PBR but my landlord offered me a beer so I'm reveiwing it."
"This certainly isn't the first macro I reach for, but it's one of the better session AAL's out there. If you're in the mood for an adjunct, you could certainly do a hell of a lot worse."
"the one draw back is the corn note present in the finish. more prevalent than if i were to make the beer for myself."
"O- I am biased to this one so please don't hate the review."
"Prost."
"Pale color, faint aroma. But it does have a good mouthfeel and a passable taste."
"O: Decent swill to pound back when you maxed out your credit card, find some change inside your couch and find the pack in the clearance aisle of your favorite supermarket."
"Given the cost ($20 for 12*473 mL in Ontario), I can see why PBR is popular these days. It's a very typical example of the style, but with a bit more punch than comparable beers."
"Came out looking flat; I'd been drinking out of the can (24oz man-can) before I decided to review, so that could be why. It smells like most macro-brews. A little corny. That nauseating hint of sweetness is absent in the nose. Light straw color, crystal clear. Very drinkable and I'm not being sarcastic. Much better than my beast that I drink. There's a grainy bitterness but very light. No hint of sweetness, which I really despise in American lite lagers."
"Sparkling clear pale yellow with a fluffy, pure-white head on top. Lightly sweet, anemic grainy aroma...faint grass and corn. Very bland, nearly flavorless beery flavor. It's not awful, especially on a hot day and/or to wash down certain food. Light grainy sweetness, decently crisp, not too corny or anything. I don't know. Cheap, harmless, flavorless beery beer."
"Judged as an American lager, this is a classic great beer. It's better than its bigger competitors and a joy to drink when you're looking for a crisp clean beer that goes down well. Elegantly simple, refreshingly uncomplicated. I feel cool drinking it."
"Just popped a can of this classic. While this beer is certainly nothing to write home about is is probably my favorite american adjunct lager. I'd take a pbr any day over a bud, miller or coors. Its cheep and doesn't taste awful, while still getting the job done on a weekend night. I would definitely recommend this as an alternative beer for casual beer drinkers."
"I'd rather have a Bud or a Coors. Sorry to say it, but it be the truth."
"overall: this beer isnt half bad if your looking at it in the cheap beer realm. As a college student, this beer is one of my favorites to buy a 30. Its cheap, its tastes good enough, and most importantly it gets the job done. Of course id rather be drinking something with a bit more class, but as far as bang for your buck... this beer is one of the best (way better then busch light or natty)."
"-Everywhere in Philly"
"Overall. It's an AAL which is just meh.. but It's not the worst that is out there and it's not a terrible brew to have around."
"Overall- Overall this beer is a pretty solid generic American lager. In my opinion I would pick it time and again over most of the other American beer tyrants such as Budweiser, Coors, and Miller."
"Overall Drinkability - Crap. No real redeeming qualities besides the price. Even that doesn't balance out the worthiness of this brew."
"Overall - This is an average beer, but compared to most of the affordable stuff out there, I think this is king. It's pretty drinkable and I will still drink this beer in the future. Probably for a while. If you only have a buck or two and want to enjoy a beer, I recommend this."
"Very refreshing macro lager."
"Better than I was anticipating. Poured a 2"" head which took a while to dissipate. Clear and almost neon yellow color. Smell and taste are standard BMC (weak general American lager) however it has a little zing and the finish is longer than the typical BMC. If I regularly chose BMC styles as my standard style I could easily satisfy with PBR."
"Hands down, this is my favorite beer in the AAL leagues. On top of that, it is an icon of our times. ""But Mister Larkin," you ask, ""Aren't you supposed to be a craft beer enthusiast? Shouldn't you scoff at this style?"" First, don't call me Mr. Larkin. That was my dad, and he prefers Miller Lite. Second, I am an all-beer enthusiast, and I see no reason to scoff. It's a reasonably well made beer for it's style. And the style doesn't deserve so much criticism. Any beer from any style can be a good beer, just as any shirt can be a wife-beater. Except I mean that as being more positive than my analogy. Um."
"overall: probably worth the $20 i dropped on the case."
"O: wow. I'm gonna get some shit for this. This is one of the more well crafted adjunct's I've had. I think I prefer this to others. Guess I will have to review them..."
"O: My favorite readily available macro lager that can be had just about anywhere. It is cheaper than Bud, Miller, and Coors and has a better flavor. It is very quaffable and refreshing on a hot summer day. For what it is (American macro lager) its an A, but in the world of beer a C at best."
"Overall: If you like to pound them down, this beer is for you. Not for me, however. Too carbonated, not enough complexity or hops. I can see appreciating this beer more at a cookout."
"An American Classic of a beer. Although this beer doesn't have very much to offer it's still standing the tests of time. This beer is you typical American style Lager with a Fizzy white head that fades into a flat yellow liquid. The mouthfeel isn't as light as a ""light"" beer but but it's not even close to being heavy either. This beer keep it simple."
"I consider PBR to be the quintessential ""Barbeque Beer"". This is my quantity beer of choice during camping trips or cookouts. I can pick up twelve packs of bottles for around $6, so the price is definitely right. Oddly enough, Saint Louis hipsters pound this stuff like it's going out of style. Maybe they know something I don't? Overall, if you are looking for a cheap beer and want to steer clear of the typical swamp water that Anheuser Busch produces for a similar price, I recommend PBR."
"Drinkability- While Team Seagal (cycling) hands out free PBR's at St. Louis MTB races, I can never take this beer seriously. They even use it to hose down oncoming cyclists and try to make people eat shit out there! I don't mind drinking this lager, can see how it has won some awards, but will never know how this old style beer was at one time so popular... Will have to get someone to persuade me otherwise."
"a dirt cheap single what more can I say"
"Corn is in the flavour with grain, mild sweetness, milder bitterness. Nothing offensive and surely quaffable. This is the first time I've had PBR in bottles in years. I think I prefer it in cans.."
"Pours perhaps the litest gold of all. Smell is a silo of modest grains. Taste is light and bready, morphing into a somewhat bitter, shockingly decent, hoppy finish. Feel is lite and toasty, clean and grainy. Cuts itself above many of the other adjuncts.."
"O: If you're looking to get drunk, or are already drunk, you won't care. Otherwise, you have to have been drinking this for years (or be a hipster) to seriously enjoy this."
"D- Pretty drinkable even though it's a light beer. I can see why this beer is so cheap in large quantities. I wouldn't have more than 1 and that was because when I tried this I just wanted to see what it tasted like, not because I was going to order it all night."
"Reasonably drinkable, yeah I could have a few of these, not great flavor, but oh well."
"Can poured in my Bruery tulip, just 'cuz. Pours a startling pale yellow with sizable white head. Smells like college parties, drinking games, dorms, mistakes, awesomeness...I cannot disentangle specific odors from memories. I'll say it smells pretty good, given that. Smooth, classic flavor. My second favorite AAL in flavor behind Premium (not that I'm an expert). Hard to describe. I'm not going to go overboard because it is not a revelation, but it tastes correct, whatever that means. Mouthfeel is super thin with crazy heavy carbonation. A bit much... In spite of this, it is very drinkable. I had this after a few craft beers and I wasn't sad."
"Red blooded American beer available at most establishments for a great price. Does not disappoint if I am not in the mood for a draft Chimay at the Stumbling Monk in Seattle. I have a warm place in my heart for union brewed Milwaukee beer that is refreshing, tasty, and reasonably priced. It shouldn't be reviewed in comparison with the many incredible micro-brews that our country produces. It deserves to be compared with the macro-brews that most Americans still purchase. It is vastly better than most with Miller High Life being the only near equal. Considering the present state of our economy, it is one of the best beers for the money if you enjoy drinking frequently. For that reason alone, it deserves respect."
"Essentially it's an ever so slightly better version of Bud/coors."
"D- Very, but mostly for drinking pitchers and playing drinking games in my opinion.."
"Overall, I prefer this is bottle form and straight from the bottle at that."
"Cheers!"
"Slainte anyway."
"24 ounce can, best by date of April 25, 2011 printed on the bottom of the can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear light gold color with an inch and a half frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. Aroma is mostly sweet and grainy malt, and a bit of corn and grassy hops. Taste is pretty much like the aroma, except that I don't pick up any hop flavors. No offensive aromas or flavors that I notice. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's thin and a bit watery. It's also well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it goes down pretty easy. For the style, it's a decent brew. I've certainly tried much worse! Not bad for $1.49 a can."
"We just need the damn hipsters to give this one back so it will be more sociably acceptable to drink."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Medium bodied. A very crisp and refreshing taste. Not bad for an American Adjunct Lager. I would prefer Molson Canadian over this, but it is still decent."
"D: Much better poured into a glass than straight from the can IMO, this is a big step forward from the BMCs. I picked up a case of PBR cans on sale as a budget beer fridge stocker, and for a refreshing 'light' beer and change of pace. PBR fits that bill perfectly."
"Making a revival on being hip in colleges but partly cuz its jusst cheap and its not Bud light. It is better than Bud all around. Best served cold. Slightly creamy body in a pale yellow beer with a foamy white head that fades fast but leaves rings of lace. Sweet malts shine through with a touch of citrus and some mineral and metallic notes. Some earthy grassy notes. Not bad. Pretty watery. Easy to drink."
"Average alcohol content, but usually gets people hammered from simply being super easy to drink. Think I finished this can in about 15 minutes, just because i'm writing this review as i drink it!"
"Its not a great teasting, smelling, looking, or feeling beer, but once you get a to your 3rd one you can drink about 50. This is the perfect cheap get hammered, tailgaiting beer."
"Every day I get more hipster."
"Very good beer. alot of bars I have been to seem to have this on the cheap list of beers. which is fine with me. I could actually sit at the bar and enjoy this one the whole time. Also have had it on tap and as long as the bar cleans the tubes out right its just as good if not better in a frosty mug."
"Quick story... I have been to many a beer tasting, all kinds, big ones, brewery specific and some in the middle. Many of the big events have a PBR booth. I have never seen it without a decent line, where as Bud's table is empty enough to hear crickets..."
"Basically what I expected. This typical American Adjunct lager gets a passing grade."
"light-bodied mouthfeel with above average carbonation - more or less in line with my expectations. crisp and refreshing. fairly high drinkability."
"Overall, the best AAL I have had, but certainly lacking when compared to many other non-BMC brews. That said, PBR is my go to ""party beer"" and one cannot beat the value. I will always have a soft spot for the peebs."
"D-This is pretty damn drinkable and went fantastic with my pizza, I'd say this is the best AAL I've ever had, and you can't beat the price, my pop would be proud."
"A very non-offensive adjunct lager with slight hints of good flavor. A good beer to have after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day, but so is a hefeweizen, and that has a lot more flavor."
"Drinkability. I've drank more of this beer than any other kind in my life mainly because it used to be cheaper and even though they raised the price it's still pretty affordable. It's a party beer and it always taste okay on tap. At the same time it's the perfect representative of drinkable generic american light lager which has been the mainstay of the American beer industry for decades. My verdict is that PBR is drinkable but boring."
"Poured a pale yellow with a decent head. The appearance was the highlight here. Aroma was slightly sweet and mainly of corn and malt. Taste was similar with corn/adjuncts dominating with slightly sour bite just prior of a mild to mid hop bitterness finish. Palate was decent although a bit on the thin side. Overall, a typical American style lager that is mass produced and loaded up with corn/adjuncts. Perfect to sip on while you do yard work on a hot day or when hanging with buddies at a dive bar that doesn't serve craft beer!"
"For what it is, it's a good, easy drinking beer for those lazy summer days. Definitely better than BMC."
"D - being that it's probably impossible to find this for more than a buck or two on tap or more than 3 or 4 bucks for a 6 pack, you can't go wrong if you want to do some cheap, working class drinking. bottoms up"
"D- Tasty and drinkable this is Lager how it should be."
"im just sayin- if i gotta go regular american beer i go pabst. i mean it won a blue ribbon forcryin out loud. this stuff is about the same price as pepsi. as far as i am concerned its about the best beer for the money out there. it has more flavor than bud and is 1/2 the price. even at my locaql bar bud light=$2.75 pbr=$1.50. thats a no brainer."
" All I'm saying is give Pabst fighting chance, who knows you might like it."
"D: like most people, i have been drinking this stuff for a while without really considering what's going on inside the can. overall, it is a solid beer for the style it represents. with the pricetag that goes with it, it's hard not to have any in the fridge."
"Nose is wheat, grain, phenol and a pilsner like auroma. Tase is quite similar; light tasting malts and weak pils like flavour, grassy grain. Light, watery mouthfeel. Very easy to consume several, and honestly having not had one since joining BA and trying so many stlyes, it tastes pretty decent right now. One to drink at a gathering of non appreciate craft friends or as a summer grass cutting refresher."
"Drink- Well its better than Bud Light."
"This beer had a bit of a thin body. There was a good easy drinking feel to it and did go down easy. A beer with a purpose, this beer makes for a cheap beer when there is nothing but macro on the bar tap list."
"PBR has a light malty aroma with no off-notes and detectable hops. Looks and tastes like a generic macro-brew. Better than the average American macro-brew for the price."
"To say this beer is uninspired is to put it mildly. It has so many off flavors and peculiar aftertastes, it's a wonder how they manage that in such a watery brew. There is nothing to recommend Pabst Blue Ribbon for any reason. I wouldn't buy it for myself, and I wouldn't offer it to anyone else."
"D: this is a great session after work american lager. The best American Light Lager IMO."
"It's not awful. Just uninspired and mostly flavorless."
"D: If you can get past the odd after-taste, you can definitely put these back (and I've seen it done). There's not much that entices me about it, though, and the aftertaste is enough to keep me from wanting more of these unless I'm already... well, drunk. I will never buy it and bring it home for myself, but if it's a special at a bar somewhere, I might entertain the idea of drinking a can."
"Pabst is one of those beers, you can get completely smashed off of it, but you can also enjoy it watching some football, eating pizza, etc. Since I've only poured a PBR into a glass maybe two times I am going to reference the most recent time, which was a few days ago, WHICH was the best pabst I have ever had. I poured it into a standard pint glass, got a little head that didn't last too long, never disappeared 100% though which was nice. The appearance was that of a normal lager accept for the head and lacing, I got the best lacing out of this pbr that I have gotten in at least two months of drinking craft beer. I was BLOWN AWAY. unbelievable to get that from a pabst. The smell wasn't anything special, neither was the taste, the taste was light light hops, light malt sweetness, but nothing bad about it. There really aren't any bad flavors to speak of in this beer, it's not offensive in any way. Personally my favorite cheap beer hands down."
"This is one of those beers i notice people either love it or hate it. i personally love it. It goes great on a hot summer day and while im spending some alone time in my garage. It goes down very smooth and the price cant be beat. PBR always has a home in my fridge."
"My go to summer cheap beer in the heart of Texas. Nothing special about PBR at all. Just very easy drinking. I guess the best thing about it is the fact it doesn't have any ill aftertastes like bud light, coors light, or the numerous other lighter lagers available. It's actually quite refreshing during a hot summer day....and at under 7 bucks a 12-pack, it's a no-brainer."
"Drinks really smooth and quick. Good cheap bar beer."
"D - This isn't a great beer, but it's certainly not bad either. And it's definitely not as bad as most people think. I could drink this stuff all night long."
"D: This is my stand-by when it comes to cheap beer. As much as I like RIS's and Barleywines, this beer is perfect when I want something light, but don't want to pay for the good (German) stuff."
"Very thin, but still drinkable. I'd take this over a BMC but not much else."
"The price is right and it ain't that bad."
"One finger head of frothy white foam which stuck around for about 1.5 minutes, leaving a broken but cling lace. Color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell is muted, corn, wheat, barley. Taste is a little harsh, flavors of corn, and wheat in the forefront, with a sweetness and citrus lingering. Better than water in my mouth, quite a bit of carbonation. Good for a party where you don't have lots of funds to buy better beer."
"A crisp refreshing beer. Hops are absent, lacking bitterness. Corn and rice flavors replace the bitterness of hops and make this beer highly drinkable and refreshing. Looks are nothing to speak of: pale yellow, dissipating head. Pleasant cereal-like, smooth aftertaste. Much better than the average beer of a comparable price. My go-to cheap beer."
"Drinkability is not so good. It's cheap, and it will get you drunk. Speaking of that, this beer was my staple in college. lol"
"Crystal clear and light yellow in colour, sort of a dull hue considering the clarity. Fizzy white foam dissipated quickly, but left a thin collar and skim of fine bubbles lingering atop the beer. Grainy, sweet aroma, a bit of creamed corn, no discernible hops. Low bitterness with a combination of sweetness and spicy hops throughout. Light bodied, ample carbonation, fairly dry. I have no complaints here - it's easy to drink, not complex, but with more flavour than most of its competitors. Overall, it's a good example of the style."
"One of the best looking bottle labels in the history of beer. Ok now onto the review of what's inside. I don't care for PBR at all. I love several American Adjunct Lagers but this one just has a bad taste and overall flavor to me. I can't even describe it...its just off the mark in taste and drinkability. One of only a handful of American Adjuncts that I had to force to finish. I'll stick to my tried and true easy drinkers and leave the PBR's for the trailer trash and phony hipster crowd."
"A light gold appearance with a bit of foam that fizzles away quite quickly. The smell is that of a generic lagar -- there's a bit of a corn smell to it, but it's not overpowering. The taste is a bit like -- with a hint of the corn/straw taste that can come with some cheaper beers -- but it's far from annoying, especially when served ice cold. It has a high drinkability due in part to its light flavour and body, but it's certainly not unpleasant. I used to mock Pabst's a great deal, but for the price it's solid beer, especially in comparison to some of its ""peers"" (e.g., Miller and Miller Light, Bud, etc.)."
"This beer pours a pale yellow color with a white head. The aroma smells of corn and a faint hint of hops. The taste of this beer is light. There is a faint sweetness that comes through at the finish. The mouthfeel is light and overall this beer is very drinkable."
" Serving type: can"
"D - I would NEVER buy this again, there are way too many good lighter craft beers to bother with this college beer."
"D - I could drink this as a session beer if only BMC was on tap. I didn't walk into this beer thinking I could finish a pint of it... I was wrong."
"Pours a slightly bright golden straw color, thin cap of bubbly white head, a little bit of lacing. Scent is light, pale malts, hints of grain and only a minor touch of vegtable. Taste is slightly more aggressive than other adjuncts, but still light and paluges with a hint of vegtable at the end. Hops are noted in taste which is rare again for adjuncts. Lighter side of medium bodied, carbonation in check for the style but still above where it should be. A beer thats completly average all around, and my rating should reflect that accoardingly. Some positive qualities for the style, but still some off notes."
"I'm glad I revisited PBR, its really not that bad for the money. I want to say I still prefer Schlitz, but perhaps that's just some sort of anti-PBR bias on my part. Maybe its time for a head to head showdown..."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkable, like lightly flavored soda water...to be pounded, not savored. Still, I like the lack of overt flavoring and this is a thirst quencher."
"Well, honestly, this beer is better than I expected. Poured from a 16oz can with a virtually non-existant head and transparent golden color. Smells of faint corn and barley with a very slight spiciness of hops. Nothing overwhelming. Taste: slight dryness and later, a bit of a hop pinch. Overall, not a bad or great beer. Definately beats the big 3...no question. A surprisingly adequate beer, nothing fancy, but is fun to have once in a while."
"Not a bad beer to keep around and it can work pretty well as a palate cleanser or just something to wash down a cheeseburger."
"I often buy a 6 pack of pints thinking I've found a cheap way to drink. I always forget that I have trouble drinking more than one with serious attention. PBR bores me."
"You could do a hell lot worse when it comes to a BMC or adjunct at all. Even though this is review was for the can (that's right, the BIG can. Yes sir!) I have had this on tap as well, and it is far more refreshing than anything with Bud, Miller or Coors on it (yes, I know, Miller Coors make it. It's still better). It fails in comparison to most any craft beer of quality, but probably better than any other macro out there IMO."
"PBR is my go to beer. Cheap, delicious...most of the time and very easy to find."
"The appeal to PBR is that it isn't the University Beer bong beer, so cheers to you PBR for being the beer of an Overpaying Counter Culture."
"Pours very light yellow with little head retention and no aroma. Very light mouthfeel. Drinkability is good. I don't like light American Lager, but I can enjoy a PBR. It has little flavor, but the flavor it has is good. I've had people try to tell me before that it's an image thing. Bull crap. PBR tastes better than the other big American lagers."
"Drinkability: Okay, so I'm not going to give this beer a very high rating on taste because there isn't much flavor there. I didn't give this beer a low score because the flavor that is there isn't too bad. I will say this though: this beer is very drinkable. It's crisp and refreshing which makes it the perfect adjunct lager. Besides it's dirt cheap which makes it a great beer for the price and among the major brewers it is easily the best pilsner."
"Looks clear and light golden in the shaker pint glass with no head retention or lacing whatsoever. There is some sweetness in the smell but that's about it; very characterless smell. Taste is of lightly sweetened, carbonated water with some malty feel in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is watery, with a medium finish. Drinkability score follows from the other categories."
"This can of PBR was pretty inoffensive and if you could get over the lack of flavor, you could session this pretty easily. With a less watered down flavor, this has the potential to be a great session lager. Overall though, I'm pretty thankful that American beer has gotten better than this since 1893."
"There is not much to say about this beer except that it is pretty awful. I understand that has a history to it and to some people it is cool to drink. Gran Torino with Clint Eastwood will make any beer drinkable. Honestly this beer is only bearable if you are low on cash. The taste is very similar to a metallic can taste. It is pretty bitter. I would not recommend this beer to any serious beer drinker. Unfortunately I have had my share of PBRs. There really is no smell or taste which could be referable to something attractive. I do not enjoy this beer at all and if I had my way I will never have one again. I suppose this is the beer that got so many people smoking in bars. Cigarettes taste better than this brew."
"EDIT: Still not sure why this is the official drink of hipsters..."
"Overall, not bad but not fantastic by any means. I would get this if I was in a bind for beer and had no other choice, and it's probably one of the better mass-produced lagers out there; it will always serve as a better option than any BMC brews."
"Drinkability- Pretty good. Nothing offensive in this brew. Better from a bottle, but good from the can. I'd pick this over the big three anyday. Gets to be quite filling after a few, but it's a good american macro-brew."
"Can't go wrong with PBR for a cheap beer. Pours a light gold color with a fizzy head that quickly fades and leaves little lacing. Smell has some hop notes to it. Taste wise it's quite good for an adjunct lager, some hops, malts and a slight sweetness is in the mix. Doesn't leave a bad after taste and is highly drinkable. A great beer when you're on a budget or when with friends."
"D: Well, the flavor is ok, it is light and not too expensive. Wouldn't seek it out, but definitely can roll with the PBR."
"Great for a hot summer day or taking the edge off after work. This has always been and may always be my favorite cheap beer."
"Pours a straw pale yellow with a foamy white head. Aroma was feint, but I could get some watered-down malts. Not much taste, just thin malts and an odd taste I can't really describe. Thin, watery, not too carbonated. I guess it's drinkable since it's mostly like water. The bad taste isn't really apparent seeing how thin it is. I can see why party-goers like it, but if the purpose is to get drunk, just get cheap liquor, it'll do the job faster and in less volume so you don't feel bloated."
"Drinkability is excellent. An ice chest full of these is heaven to me with good company."
"I've had this lager in a can, bottle, and off of a tap. It pours a pale yellow with a big head that disaptes quickly and leaves some light lacing. The smell is a sweet malt and grain with a slight hint of hops. This lager tastes light and clean. Has a smooth mouthfeel and quick refreshing. This lager beats out any of the big three in taste and it works well for those on a budget."
"No offense to anyone who likes it, but this beer is just nauseating, worse than Budweiser. Overrated for sure, I just can't understand how so many people on this rate it as high as they do. Oh well, its not the end of the world."
"PBR is my favorite adjunct lager. End."
"The classic, quintessential American adjunct lager pours an unimpressive, pale golden, with a sweet and malty grain (corn) scent. The taste is sweet and simple, with little evidence of hops or complexity. It's a no-frills lager that isn't arty or crafty, but provides easy (and cheap) refreshment on a hot day. PBR scores points for remaining independent (of the big beer monopolies) and fully American-owned. Hipsters and cheapsters alike can enjoy this one. When I'm on a tight budget, and a good craft brew isn't in the cards, this is my go-to cheap beer."
"Bottom line: A pretty cheap average beer."
"D- Wonderful example of it's style, my ""I'm Broke"" fall back/after work at crossroads(anc,ak)/ partying with the fairview/valley/spenard crew brew of choice for YEARS. when it's all about being social on a tight budget this is it."
"This is my go-to cheap beer. I much prefer it over Budweiser, Miller, Coors, or pretty much any other AAL, with the exception of Hamm's and Schlitz."
"D: Yes it is drinkable, but enjoyable, ehh well not if you are looking for flavor in your drinkablity. For those going to the brew to put a mass quantity away, this is the beer, taste like nothing after two, it comes in a 30 pack for a reason."
"Sure, better than most other AAL in my mind, so golf, beer pong is usually when I'll suck this one down."
"Taste: Honestly better then expected. A little bitterness upfront with the a more flavorful taste then most adjuncts. There is a little bit of a metallic taste at the end."
"I'm giving this beer higher marks based on the price. Compared to others in this price range it really isn't bad at all. And who hasn't had an experience with PBR that wasn't a good time?"
"Not similar to what I would usually hail as a good beer, it is decidedly different enough from it's bland competition to be respected."
"Beer pours a pale straw yellow, you know, you've seen it a thousand times. Then again, most macro beer drinkers drink from a bottle or a can, so, maybe you haven't. Ok, pours the color of a mid-afternoon pee, if you actually had to pee, and weren't necessarily dehydrated. Minor foam at the top, wouldn't call it a head. Actually smells a bit alcoholic in the nose, for second it almost smelled faintly of Jim Beam, but couldn't be, or was it from all the corn adjuncts? Let's put it this way, doesn't smell like much of anything, but what it does smell like, isn't necessarily great, more like stale grains if anything. The taste is mildly bitter from the sodium of the carbonation of the beer, in a club soda sort of way, not really like beer. I wouldn't ever call it awful cause it is far from offensive, just, not there. I would dare to say Budweiser is actually a notch above this, cause at least I can taste some green snap from a fresh Bud, from the hop profile, that cleans the tongue whereas this just does nothing! However, in all of its marginality, it is a good compromise between the overly stale breadiness of a MGD, and the annoying green apple snap of a Bud, it does neither. It's kinda like a dull friend who is willing to join ya! My beer does have some sort of date code, I've been seeing around town, NOV 10. So, I *guess* it is fresh, but I would never know. Mouthfeel is thin and watery of course, yet the drinkability is there. Hey, at $1.40 a 24 ounce can, you could make worse choices. But at least I didn't pay $3.50 for a skunked import that has been pasteurized. As the late great Dennis Hopper once said, ""Heineken!? F*ck that sh*t! Pabst Blue Ribbon!!!"" :-)"
"D - Great for cooking, but not for me...though I think it's just a bit better than bud miller coors."
"Cheers~!!!"
"Pours a pale yellow with some head, but no lacing. Smells mildly of hops (though I was straining to smell them) with some grainy malt. Nothing really stands out from the flavour, but cleaner than many other macro lagers. Carbonation is a bit prickly."
"And of course it's drinkable, still light beer."
"I know it's not advocacy to consider ""cold"" a good flavor in a beer, but it seems to go well with the one and only PBR."
"I would rate this as a better alternative to BMC, but it's not a beer I'd choose first."
"my favorite cheap american mainstream beer without a doubt."
"Appearance is a 12 oz. bottle that is dated Dec0610 and has an awesome blue ribbon on the label, poured straight into my mouth. Smells like a little grain, but mostly a touch of alcohol, I've never really concentrated on smelling this beer before, it doesn't have much of one. Taste is grainy at first, hints of green apple with a slight bittering hop finish. Mouthfeel is very crisp, a lot of carbonation and drinkability is out of this world, at least for me, I've drank 12 in a sitting before (when I was younger) and still wanted more. A true American classic."
"32 oz bottle poured into my 32 oz PBR mug, ya can't beat that. It's fizzy, it's pale yellow it's what you would expect. It holds a decent head which is an unexpected surprise. The red white and blue of PBR, it holds it's own against the rest of the class. Better than most, not as good as some. Enjoy."
"D: For what it is, this beer is good. The best of the worst I guess you could say. The thing that sets PBR apart from other BMC's, is that PBR doesn't have a terrible aftertaste, even as the beer warms a bit. Like I said, for the style, this beer is one of the best; the style just needs some work."
"This beer is compairable to bud. I think I like bud better. It's just a standard lager. The lacing was ok I guess. I'm sure you have all had a beer like this in your time. I'm not going to give it a real high rateing. But try it for yourself if you like standard lager beer I'm sure you'll like it if thats what your into."
"Extremely drinkable if you like this kind of thing. But I see myself reaching for a coke, or water, over this if I'm paying to be honest. Sorry to offend the hipster crowd, but this kind of beer is the whole reason I got into craft - so I'd never have to taste beer like this again..."
"Overall this beer tends to be a forgotten favorite, an ol friend that should be revisited after a long hot day of work."
"It was a hot summer days and was going to the park for a family lunch, stop at the grocery store and bought a 6 pack of this. The color is very pale yellow. Nice looking head with a soapy looks. Clear color beer. The aroma shows some citrus notes with cereal (mainly corn). Pretty simple/ordinary aroma. The taste is watery... I would guess this is water except for the slight bitterness at the end. Not impressive at all, I would have guess that this one had more punch than the ordinary BMC beers. This is a simple beer, however it is refreshing (but not interesting). Drinkability is high, however after 2-3 of this beer, it is starting to get a little dull..."
"d- good taste and drinkablity and great price help this beer have good drinkablity"
"I'd say drinkability is pretty high. This is probably the best adjunct I've had in my life and I wouldn't hesitate to have another. Cheap, easy drinking, and low ABV. Session."
"Serving type: can"
"D- Inexpensive and easy to down enough. Worth the money and a good choice for cheap beer."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can marked JUN1410-F08011537. Sampled on Aug. 30, 2010. Presentation: the omnipresent blue ribbon splashed across the can with a carbonated yellow pour and a good half-inch head that sticks around for a few minutes. The aroma is corny and grassy with a faint maltiness and fresh but thin hoppiness. The taste is a great traditional adjunct lager with corn, rice, and a faint bite of hops to perk your senses. When you want to have a BEER beer, PBR is the way to go."
"D - Extremely easy to drink, but really not a worthy beer to drink all night long. If I was scrapping for money, this might be a beer I'd go to as a regular, but I hope that doesn't happen. Overall, this is about as good of an American Adjunct Lager as I have tasted."
"While it's not my favorite beer, I don't mind picking up a case of these for a party. It's much better than the other American Adjunct Lager's i've tried by far. I dont care for the whole hipster crap that seems to be associated with the beer, its cheap and tastes decent for the price. You get what you pay for and in this case it's worth the money. I've also used this for cooking some meats at bbq's too."
"I've been drinking PBR quite a bit at our local Bierstube, can't pass up the cheap special. PBR is your typical light beer, but I find it to be a better option at times than Bud Light or Coors Light if you're out at the bars (always a better option than Miller Lite). PBR is a light golden color. There isn't a great deal of taste or smell with this beer. You get exactly what you pay for. It is easy to drink several in one sitting. Everyone should try PBR at least once."
"Drinkability - No I'm not a hipster. No I wouldn't pick this beer over others to drink. However, when you are in the mood for just something that is refreshing, easily quaffable, and downright easy to drink...this is my beer. I would rather have this over pretty much any other macro, and for what it is, it isn't bad. Despite my liking good beer, I honestly do not like pairing some of my favorite styles (i.e. IPA, DIPA) with food at say a BBQ. There is normally just too much flavor for me while eating food, so PBR is a damn good beer to drink with good BBQ, and after I'm done eating I'll open up the good stuff."
"Notes: Pretty similar to others in the style. Nothing all that special compared to others, but for a cheaper price, this an Miller High Life are probably top choices for macro beers for me. Not a bad beer for what it is."
"I remember an old advertisement for PBR- ""Rednecks, white socks, blue ribbon beer."" For me that says it all. A very simple beer. It is what it is. Good when out on a boat or for a backyard bbq. A classic all American beer without all the expensive advertising. Looks and tastes much like Coors, pale gold, fizzy head, extremely watery, refreshing on a hot summer's day, and very sessionable."
"I've drank this warm and cold from a bottle, a can, and a tap. In all cases it looks like piss mixed with seltzer water and tastes like water. There really is no smell or taste other than a generic ""beer"". If you only want to get drunk it does the trick. If you want to get hung over it will also do the trick. It isn't as cheap as it used to be. I can get a 12 pack of High Life or Natty Light cheaper than I can get a 6 pack of PBR. It is easy to put away a 12 pack of this beer and not feel disgusted. Most drinkable of all the ""cheap"" beers."
"Final note: I wish all of the ""hipsters"" didn't try and make this beer their own. This was definitely one of my fallback beers....the one I turned to when I was poor and didn't know anything about craft brews. I actually would drink this one a tad more, but the damn hippies, posers, and alternative/emo crowd had to come along and ruin it."
"drinkability is good on this one.. again considering the style of beer it is. would i take this over craft beer? NO, but if i had a long days work and wanted to unwind while saving some cash i'd settle with PBR.. much rather have this than Bud or coors or miller.."
"It's cheap; a local bar sells this beer for $1 per 32-ounce pitcher. That is the only reason I could ever see myself drinking this beer again."
"For the price can't be beat."
"Clear yellow brew with a stable layer of fizzy white foam. Smell is metallic, some raw grain, and a bit of sweetness like white grape juice. Taste is the same plus a little lemony hop. Feel is thin and a bit fizzy, finishes dry and crisp with some lingering hop. Chuggable."
"Drink - For the price, this beer isn't half bad. Not something I'd drink all the time, but decent in a pinch."
"It is what it is. I have always enjoyed this much more than Budweiser and the like. I don't buy this as often as I used to, but this is my go-to when going to a party or if the wallet is getting thin...it has a time and place, a $5 6-pack pricepoint, and gosh darnit, a piece of my heart."
"The slightly bitter taste and mild graininess makes this several steps above carbonated water."
"O- It is made for the long nights of indulgence. This beer is head and shoulders my favorite macro AAL. It is actually a beer I regularly purchase when I am too tired to deal with complex beers."
"i enjoy this a lot more poured into a glass. for me, out of the can its just like any other macro. but id still pick this over most macros. dont know if its because of the hype and the name, or the taste, but thats only when im really broke and can not afford micro and i really want to drink. i still think there is too much hype on BA over this beer."
"Served to me in a mason jar as their current throwback beer. Pale yellow with very little head by the time it hit the table. Smells clean and a little sweet. Taste follows the nose with a malt and adjunct sweetness. Again, very clean with no off flavors. Crisp and refreshing with a good amount of carbonation. A solid representation of the classic fizzy yellow American lager."
"D-Very high. I could pound these back all day and plan on it. Goes down like water and has a little more taste than the rest of the field field PBR is in. If I need something cheap, this would most likely be it."
"served at about 45 degrees or so...poured into a standard pint glass. looks thin, has a white topped head that vanishes without a trace after a minute or 2. brew is golden in color. smells like malts and a good touch of corn. if hops are there they are mild at best. tastes quite sweet (in a corny, malty way), a bit of hops are present but they come to the party late and leave early. very clean finish, just a bit of lingering sweetness. feels thin but not as thin as many other adjunct lagers out there. carbonation is ok. i thought it could have used a bit more this one's just a bit flattish. not much carbonation bite. overall this beer delivers exactly what you'd hope from an adjunct. drinkability is just fine, the taste is not objectionable (or pretentious) and it doesn't get noticeably skunky as it warms up a bit like so many others in this variety. a good example of a very average, drinkable, and likeable cheap american lager."
"D- Pretty easy beer to finish and would prefer this over other American Adjunct lagers."
"D: Goes down very easy, not much of a give, not filling, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this beer. This one is that you can put a few back easily."
"D-easily able to blow these back. better than any Bud, Miller, or Coors."
"D - Real easy drinking... Goes down easy sip after sip... Nothing fancy here, but a super sessionable alternative to the average adjunct lagers on the market..."
"But it is incredibly drinkable -- smooth, clean, and refreshing on a hot summer's day. A can goes down like water -- which isn't the most ringing endorsement a beer has ever had, but it is what it is. As cheap beer goes, this really isn't bad."
"Overall this is a great beer to drink with your friends. It's had a surge in popularity lately, but the prices are still reasonable. I'd take this over most mass produced American lagers any day."
"I agree with most of these reviews. Perhaps I've been too affected by the recent comeback. In Milwaukee (I don't know if it's the same in other cities) it's the new trendy thing and has a good deal of advertising around, but I find it surprisingly satisfying, for a cheap macro-brew of course. It is pretty light, so it is very easy to drink and the mouth-feel is just ok. The flavor is what makes this beer worth my while. It is crisp, balanced and not too bland."
"The appearance is not all to exciting. Poured into frosted mug it gives about a finger of clean white head that actually hangs around for a minute. The smell is clean for this type of beer, leaving little in the way of imaginary vegetation for the nose to discover. The taste is clean as well, completely refreshing and just about the best for a hot day working outdoors, or just standing around the grill at the family barbecue (a place where you may need to keep few extra in a private stash to deal with the family). The mouthfeel is highly carbonated but is still refreshing and the drinkability is through the roof. One American classic that I'm proud to say is one of my favorite beers, and definitely my favorite in this style."
"I think I'll have more of these in the hot summer time, but I can't imagine it will be that enjoyable in the colder months."
"Of all the nasty Milwaukee brews, this is hte only drinkable one in my opinion. There is a stigma of course to drinking PBR, but in all honesty, its not a horrible beer. Its better than one may expect, and definitely beats out MGD or Bud. When Im drinking cheap, I only want a PBR!"
"I think it has a fuller flavor and avoids the ""bitter-beer face"" grossness of a lot of macros. I could drink several without getting tired of it."
"PBR seems to occupy an unusual space. It's not exactly BMC territory, but it's not really a regional specialty, and the hipster anti-cool thing seems to have worn off (thank God). So what's left? It's a little like Stroh's -- it definitely has a distictive taste, OK but not great, good summer beer. It has a great-looking label that I really like (superficial as it sounds) that brings it up a rung in my book. Give it a try -- it's good (if not great) and may not be around that much longer (remember Rheingold?)."
"D - Statistics show that 7.5 out of every 13 trailer-park domestic disputes begin over quarrels concerning the ownership of ""that there last can of PBR."""
"If you are buying mass quantities of beer in order to get hammered then I would consider this over other choices. Other than that stay clear of PBR."
"Drinkability is scoring pretty high for me."
"Very pale straw gold in colour. Thin head doesn't stick around for very long, and doesn't lace. Smells mildy grainy with a hint of hops. Tastes lemony with a bit of sweet grain. Extremely light bitterness. While it has a bit more body than other adjunct lagers, this still feels very light. It's soft & restrained (for the style) carbonation contributes to it's slightly fuller mouthfeel. Other beers of this type tend to have a more prickly carbonation that, when combined with their light body, make the beer feel a bit thinner. A smooth and quenching lawn mower beer."
"Serving type: can"
"Well, I guess PBR really is better than a lot of macros out there. I'd drink it again with friends."
"I never really planned on reviewing this beer. I've had it many times before and most definitely will again. I agree with almost all of the previous reviews for this brew. But, I felt that sense of pride sitting there celebrating the independence of still the greatest nation on earth and enjoying a classic american beer with some friends even if it wouldn't have been the first beer I would have picked in the first place."
"R.P. and I were going to change the world, but at the finish of it neither of us ended up making much difference. We have this ice cold brew on this July evening on the porch and we have each other. So we toasted to spending another evening like just like we used to. Slowly dying together as we watch the stars just beginning to shine. Steady."
"Pours a pale golden color, with an frothy evaporating head. Has a decent look to it. Doesn't have much aroma or really any hints or subtleties but it isn't supposed. I'm a big fan of things succeeding at exactly what they aim for. Not a great mouthfeel, but drinkable. It isn't a micro brew, it isn't something with a lot of extra accents, but it is a quality, old style American brew that is cheap and does its job."
"All things considered, PBR's saving grace is its drinkability. For a night with friends or at the bar when cultured consumption isn't a concern, PBR is a perfect potable. An added perk to PBR is that, for drinkers on a budget, it can often be obtained for a significantly lower price than domestic light beers."
"I acquired this after it was left behind at a camp fire me and my buddies had recently. I couldn't leave it behind, lonely, forgotten and unreviewed. So here it comes, a 16 ounce can of Pabst Blue Ribbon goes into my pint glass a see through golden yellow with a bit of fizzy white head that dissipates into spotty lacing. Lots of fun tiny bubbles showing a delightful carbonation. Not much to smell here except grains and alcohol. Neat. Smells like a dirty bottle redemption center. The taste is the arguably the best thing about this beer. Grains and hop bitterness. It's pretty one dimensional but it isn't bad by any means. This really is the best of the big guys and something I never mind having at a campfire or any outdoor outing where beer isn't the main focus. Good mouth feel. I love how crisp an refreshing this is and I love all those crazy bubbles! I know it may seem silly to give this beer a five for drinkability but I know it does down easy due to the light body, good flavor and spot on carbonation."
"Rarely pour PBR in a glass, but it was a light golden color like any other light beer, decent head that faded quickly. There's not a very strong scent that I've noticed to this beer, maybe a little...very little hoppy smell. Taste is ok. My favorite of the cheaper beers; and best tasting in my opinion. Nothing spectacular. Mouthfeel is crisp, refreshing, light and a bit of carbonation. Overall If given a case I could drink it all day, especially on a hot day. Good and cheap, can't complain!"
"Simply the beer to drink in the ""hipster' crowd as of late. It's simple american light clean appearance and taste amkes it a go to beer for many ""hip"" drinkers. With a very affordable price( between $1.50-$2.50 @ my local watering holes) it's sales continue tohold steady. Myself being a lover of craft beers one wouldn't think i would shell out even a couple dollars for a beer that essentially has little in similarity to the beers I usually rave about. However, it has done well to serve as a light mild beer on a summer day, or when the wallet is thin. I proudly raise my hand up high with a PBR tallboy."
"What you have with Pabst is a lager that has what lager drinkers like who may or may not be on a beer budget."
"Your light body compliments most food one would eat in a bar perfectly, from the burger, to the chicken strips. A joy of my own is using you to cook noodles, an idea that came to me when I had too little water to finish a dish. You have not given in to the hops-ridden madness that is in vogue today, and instead you focus on having a pure grain taste, with a light body and a crisp mouthfeel. The yeast leaves just a slight feeling of bread. You do not overwhelm, but complement. You are the coda of a symphony. You are the perfect session drink, capable of being consumed for hours, both to your lighter alcohol content, as well as your other qualities. Raphael's masterpiece you are not, but you are worth for what you aspire to be."
"D: On a nice warm day, you can get caught up drinking one after another. High drinkability mixed with low alcohol leaves you wanting more."
"If you're very weak to smells, then you might want to pass this one up."
"I don't know about any blue-ribbon status. but I don't mind drinking this beer."
"Not too bad. Light flavors, including malt and light hop bitterness, but no sour notes and a pretty clean finish. Lighter bodied, but appropriate, and this makes this the perfect summer low-end brew. What a friggin' shock, it is actually the best of the adjuncts. I'd drink this any day over Bud. Not too damn bad for what it is."
"OK overall, good sessionable beer. Godd for hot weather."
"It was fun renewing my relationship with PBR and it will not be a stranger to my refigerator."
"D: Great for a hot summer day. Inoffensive American adjunct lager. For the price I can't complain, I'll never turn down a PBR."
"Summary: I can't find any real flaws with PBR. It was the standard in my Grandpa's house and my brother drank it for years too. They both know something about beer! I like this when I can't drink the truly good (expensive) stuff!"
"Overall, PBR isn't my first choice in beer, but as a college student who doesn't have a lot of money, it's definetly in my price range, and relative to other cheaper lager beers, it's not bad. Unlike budweiser, bud light, coors, etc Pabst actually has a flavor; you can definetly taste some wheat and a little bit of malt. For a beer that's so cheap to buy, it's definetly a quality deal. I would take a Pabst over a more expensive Coors, Budweiser or Miller (ESPECIALLY Miller) any day of the week. Definetly the best of the cheap macro brews."
"M: Medium consistent carbonation throughout."
"Notes: Drinkability is there because it's not overcarbonated like light beers and many other adjunct lagers. Rare that I drink this style but when I do it's usually PBR as I find it smoother tasting and easier drinking than most. For the price, it's a good beer to grab some cans and toss in a cooler."
"I enjoyed it, brought back a couple of memories of drunken sports fields and tins laying around, happy days."
"Simply foul and not worthy of the term ""beer"". I would rather never drink again than go anywhere near this muck again."
"D - When you can slam a beer without having to get off of your bike, then you have a '5'!"
"This is a beer for nights of mass consumption or any other time that easy drinkability is desired. Typical American lager with crisp aftertaste allowing you to drink large quantities. Slightly better than others in this category because of clean flavor with grains blended well with hops."
"As I barely finished 2/3 of this one, I can't call it drinkable."
"The beer pours a very light yellow color with a white head. The aroma is not good with lots of corn and wheat. The flavor is full of adjuncts with tons of corn, rice and wheat. Overall the aroma and flavor are incredibly bland. Light mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is a beer with nothing positive going on."
"Overall this is one of the better macro lagers I have had. It's actually borderline enjoyable and in no way is it offensive. I would drink PBR all day in the summer. Glad I tried this ""ledgend"" of an American lager."
"This stuff has definitely stood the test of time."
"A very refreshing and good American lager. And the fact you can find a tall 6pack for $4 is awesome. A good everday or session beer. A little cleaner in the bottle than in a can, and even cleaner on tap."
"Pretty strong taste of corn. Not head really, and its smell is pretty average as well. However, it's extremely drinkable and a hell of a lot better than the other choices like bud or miller. Easily one of the better cheap beers out there."
"Now the big question is if I were blind folded could I identify it as PBR and not one of the other big commercial brews?"
"Honestly, for the price, the beer isn't bad. If I'm broke on a particular week I'd have no reservations picking up a 30 pack for cheap."
"D - Good beer for the price, and of the macros I've had it's the best. No wonder Clint was kicking so many of these back in Gran Torino."
"I stand by this beer. Its a great model for good, old fashioned working class american beer that hasnt sold out, hasnt changed, hasnt deviated from the plan."
"overall: this and miller highlife are my fav macro lagers well I do like stella too good beer to drink in the summer goes down easy and doesn't offend. I still wanna try the new Gusto that came out recently too."
"I actually grew up drinking PBR. Then moved on. But anyway, I havent had this brew in over 20 years. I thought I would give it a try. Pours a two fingered white head. Head hung around for a little while. Not much lacing going on. Brew itself is a light yellow and very clear. Had a lot of bubbles spewing from the bottom of the glass. Not a lot of smell going on. Just of maybe some grain and grass. Again very light. The taste was very light also, and I mean very light. I dont know how to describe it. Maybe a hair of sweetness. It didnt really taste bad, it actually tasted good. Felt good in the mouth, not to much carbonation. The old PBR would make a good session beer. Easy on the wallet and doesnt fill you up. Sunday afternoon doing lawnmowing and garden work, perfect."
"I tried to rate this according to style."
"Drinkability- certainly highly drinkable and would have no problem throwing quite a good amount of these back on a summer day, look its not something I would drink all the time but sometimes your just lookin for that simple beer when you are having a bunch of friends over and your not looking to break the bank for people who are gonna be drunk anyway and not really appreciating beer and for the price being a good chunk less then the other big names no reason no to go here and not the competion considering if not at least equal slightly better, will be up there with probably yuengling as my cheap macro lager for those occasions"
"I've come to adore choice crap pilsner in a can and Pabst Blue Ribbon does NOT disappoint. HEINEKEN?!!! F@#$ THAT S&*T!!! PABST - BLUE - RIBBON!!!"
"All told, it's PBR. It won't be winning any blue ribbons outside of its marketing department. But it's somewhat better than its macrobrew competitors at a substantially lower price. When you're looking to fill up a cooler, look to PBR. It's not just for longshoremen and hipsters anymore."
"pabst is definitely one of those drinkable beers you can sit on the couch with and finish off the 12 pack with another friend and then move onto something better. beats the shit out of bud and coors"
"I can't even believe I'm reviewing this beer, but had it this past weekend and wanted to try something new and different. This is a beer my dad drank for years and I wonder if anyone would even consult these reviews when buying PBR. Therefore, I question why I'm writing a review for this. I think this would be a great lawn mower beer in the summer time and quaff it down on hot day in place of water. In fact, I'd definitely take this over water..."
"Cheers!"
"Good all around american lager that doesn't ask for much in money or thinking-just a nice drinker.."
"It appearance is interesting, its a very flat color, and looks like a very honey-yellow, normally single color brews look uninteresting, but its color is very pleasant. It pours with solid white head, that quickly disperses. Its smell leaves a lot to be desired, it isn't unpleasant, its very nearly nothing at all, very unassuming. It tastes mild and unassuming, nothing unpleasant about it. Its mouthfeel, is fantastic, very sharp, very crisp, tingly and pleasant. Overall very drinkable, not the most interesting beer out there, but pretty refreshing when you want something light & refreshing."
"Overall: PBR would be a great beer if it was marketed and distributed better. A very popular beer with hipsters and hunters alike, giving it some nice nostalgic points."
"D: Definitely could drink a number of these, especially on a hot day. This is really where this beer shines. Really, a nice, inexpensive combination of just enough flavor and high drinkability to make this a quaffable beverage."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, when you consider the cost. Easily on par with other American styles like Budweiser and Miller products."
"No joke, cheaper than a 6 pack of Budweiser. All though, I do enjoy PBR even though it's not my favorite."
"D - Very drinkable. Smooth and easy. Great session beer."
"the first beer i ever drank... i stole it from my grandpas garage fridge ran out behind the garage cracked it open and never looked back! I brew my own beer and i love craftbrew. but on a thursday after a long work day... give me a pbr! and besides, whens the last time you saw a 30 pack of dogfish head 60 min ipa? and if you did find it do you think it would be $15.00 out the door?"
"Highly drinkable... this is one of those beers you can drink all day if you wanted to. perfect for camping, and summer activities."
"Later"
"I hope they fix this. If this is what PBR has become, our love affair is over."""
"Poured from the can into a Victory Golden Monkey tulip. Poured a beautiful medium gold into the glass, with a huge, billowy white head. Aromas of corn and freshly cut hay lead to a rather uninteresting taste. Not a whole lot going on, but not really meant for deep thought. Very crisp, refreshing and drinkable, but not much else."
"maybe the taste being rather bending toward the sweet side merits it some credit but not too much either. and a macro-bent not too hoppy finish. pfffft what a boring way to end my night."
"Best choice for a domestic macro. Not great compared to micros but for what it is, it's pretty respectable."
"Tonight, I was at dinner with friends at PF Changs, so not a great beer selection to begin with. I see PBR drafts for $2.75 on the menu, and think it's too cheap to pass up. Served in tall pilsner glasses. Clear yellow body. Thin bubbly head. Plenty of carbonation. Smell and taste were average macro flavors: corn, adjuncts, and a bit of malt. Not a horrible flavor, but nothing to write home about. Mediocre but not appalling. Mouthfeel was fizzy but oddly refreshing. Decent pairing with spicy Mongolian beef entree. Slightly more drinkable and enjoyable than BMC."
"Not too much to say about this beer. For me its a staple because of the cost and drinkability. The Appearance is light yellow, nothing special. Smell is light a little malty and again nothing special. Taste is good compared to other american lagers and if you review this beer with a ""reality"" focus its hard to beat (because of the price). Mouthfeel is light and kinda fizzy. The drinkability or Poundability rather of this beer is what makes it a staple for me. I can drink it all night and all day."
"Taste is a bit hoppy but mainly super light malt. It's a lame beer and very flat and lame. It's boring it's bland and bleck skip this at least go labatt"
"I first drank this brew while riding PBR's in Viet Nam."
"This beer is fine. My major knock is that it's a little too sweet. It actually reminds me more of soda than beer."
"Medium to thin body with appropriate carbonation, and pretty easily drinkable. It's not a great beer, but certainly a decent fall-back brew."
"473ml can from the LCBO. Pours a clear golden yellow with a thick cap of bubbly white head that subsides after a few minutes. No lace this go' round. Smell and taste are lightly floral and grassy hops, crisp cereal grains, some creamed corn, and a mild, wheat husk aftertaste. The mouthfeel is delicate, smooth, and refreshing. Finishes dry and parched on the palate. A clean and easy drinker, PBR is perfect if you want a beer that you don't have to think about. Also, the lack of metal/off flavours makes this more drinkable than its macro counterparts. Best in class for an American adjunct lager."
"Drinkability: I don't really love the really high level of carbonation, but this beer is really the best of the worst. A great beer when a cheap beer option is desired."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Overall, for being what it is, I would choose this hands down over any anheiser-busch or Coors. A very light, tasty beer!"
"D: This is a very good session beer, perhaps the best for the price (I can get it on sale for about 50 cents a beer, not bad at all), body and flavor this beer offers. My lager of choice and usually whats in my fridge with the economy so shitty :)"
"Drinkability: if you ask me, this beer is alright and really cheap"
"Well lets start off things on the right foot here. This beer is not the greatest or king of anything. It doesn't pose to be any of those things either. If you are going to a party and you are broke, this is the best american adjunct lager. Light hops presence but hops none the less. You can drink a ton of it and it is obviously a session beer. If you are at a place that doesn't have any micro beers worth drinking and you do not feel like scotch, go with a pbr and cheers to your grandfather while you drink it. You were probably conceived on the stuff."
"Overall, this is one of the better adjunct lagers that are widely available and is the beer I always reach for if no craft brews are in sight. This was the first beer I ever had at age 13 and thus holds a special place in my heart. For me, PBR is an above-average adjunct lager and certainly deserving of being tried."
"Overall a decent brew. Much better and more desirable than most of the other macro brews I've had while starting out my days of drinking."
"I think I'm gonna pick up a sixer of this, if for nothing else than to provide a surprise for my friends when they peek into the mancave fridge."
"dictionary definition of adjunct: something added to another thing, but not essential to it. gross"
"D & Notes - For a mass produced product, I have always been impressed with PBR. Could drink this all night, and at $7.99 for a 12-pack, I don't feel the slightest sense of cognitive-dissociation."
"I have to say that if there is nothing else available, this will fit the bill. Or possibly out of a can next to the pool. But this is barely better than the usual adjunct lagers from Coors, Miller, and Bud. The appearance is average with a quickly vanishing head and artificial looking carbonation. Not much aroma, pretty dull. Taste is simple and straightforward. Not much going on here either. Simple yet quaffable and refreshing. Pretty average."
"There is nothing wrong with this beer on a hot day mowing the lawn. It gets the job done for refreshment, you could make a session out of it, and it really is a classic beer that has stood the test of time. This beer is all about balance, and for an American Macro...it's totally in proportion. Everyone's tried it for a reason, it's good!"
"It is certainly a unique and humbling (I am a little buzzed as I write this) experience reviewing an American icon. Don't know about the blue ribbon but a designated hitter award (this should exist) is in order--i.e., it does exactly what it is there to do, and does it pretty well. (Side point: in my numbered rating I took the big 3 to be the 'average' adjuncts, and I went from there)."
"Why did I drink this...because I was thirsty. There really was no other reason except that I just didn't want to have tap water. In it's credit, it really is better than the huge macro light beers. Not a bad quencher for a hot summer day while doing yard work though. Taste and smell were almost non-existent. Mouthfeel was like soda water with a little beer flavoring. I really hate to beer bash because someone probably put their heart and soul into brewing this so I'm not going to say I hate it but it is difficult. I have noticed a recent trend for this beer lately so I put it on tap for Oktoberfest. I never heard the end of that one. Needless to say, it won't make another appearance. If you like the F.Y.B. style then hey, knock yourself out."
"But then again I just had 3 cans with some salty nuts as I browsed the web !! I don't think I'd do that with Bud/Miller/Coors products"
"The PBR appears as a golden straw color with a frothy head that is always available after a good swirl. Smell is musky and stale with not much flavor popping out other than a hoppy finish. For a macro brew I think the taste is good. No complexity but a good notes of bitter hoppiness. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Drinkability is mediocre, but compared to other macros I think it is is high. This is definitely my binge drinking beer for those drunk nights."
"All in all, if I had to choose between this and one of the other macro beers out there, I would take the PBR."
"Yes it's a throwback. Yes it's unrivaled in low-cost. Yes it's fun to order a ""Peeber"" in your local dive, college bar, or truck stop watering hole. But no, it's not good. I'd hate to taste whatever won 2nd place at the competition where Pabst won his blue ribbon. I had an epiphany last month when I said ""why not?"" to a Peeber in a Milwaukee dive... PBR is either magic or a scientific breakthrough overlooked by the heads at CERN. You see, it allows for traveling through time. It tastes and smells just like the hangover you'll probably have the following morning (or afternoon). Simply astounding. Bending the laws of physics without the aid of a flux capacitor."
"On the whole, 3.5 for drink because it's above average compared to it's competition. I definitely don't mind drinking this one."
"Final Verdict? This in my opinion is the best ""crap"" beer on the market."
"D- OK beer to try out, but the smell is too much for me. There are better hipster beers out there if you want to make a statement about not following ""the man."""
"Overall, I can't really distinguish why this loved particularly more than any other macro other than the marketing campaign behind it. For me, the current standard for a decent macro lager that is refreshing with some flavor is Schlitz Gusto. I find this one to be far short of that and much in line with all the other macros I've had."
"(Although I was surprised, I still feel pretty confident that said can #2 will remain in my fridge for a long while. It's not to tempting with a full stocked cellar of homebrews)"
"Well the ole PBR. I am shocked poured out of can into highball glass the appearance is a light yellow color with minimal carbonation. The smell is good which is sweet with a nice hint of hops. I really like the taste it has both a hops and grain taste. The mouthfeel is really nice. The drinkability is great goes down smooth and finishes clean! Trully is an all american lager!"
"Drinkablity is good, and would take it over BMC any day."
"Overall drinkability: I have to file this one under ""almost bearable," aka ""once I have a pitcher in my system, I'll be used to the taste"" (★★)"
"Is it awful? No, not really, and certainly not when it's compared with the other big brews. It's probably good at a ball game or as a lawnmower beer. Is it good? Can't say that it is that either."
"drinkability is good on this one.. again considering the style of beer it is. would i take this over craft beer? NO, but if i had a long days work and wanted to unwind while saving some cash i'd settle with PBR.. much rather have this than Bud or coors or miller.."
"This is by no means a sipping beer for anyone that isn't currently living in a trailer but it's not bad either."
"PBR straight from the can with salt on the rim, what other way is there? Ok maybe thats a little southern but a can of PBR with some Jackyl blasting is good times. It's an American classic and better then any of the ""common"" macro's out there. Very effervescent, very very yellow."
"And I will not bash an American icon."
"Dr. If necessary. Aah, memories...."
"It is a great beer to buy for parties and a great alternative at an event. it's nice when you can be at a music venue and have a great tasting PBR and not get your wallet assaulted."
"I noticed that a local beer distributor had 24 packs on sale for $10.99 so i said why not. Me and a friend did a power-hour with a case of this a few months ago and hated this beer. But this case i just previously purchased was great. It's drinkability is very high and didn't mind the taste at all. For this low price, I may have to stock up."
"D: very easy, i dont see why some just plan hate this beer."
"Light pale yellow color with a large head with decent retention. Smells of cooked corn and sweet malt with some hops. The malt aroma is not very strong. Taste mostly like corn and grain, with hops and malt also present. Thin and watery with a lot of carbonation. Not too bad."
"Appearance is of light golden color and crisp head. Smell has a corny adjunct graininess to it. Taste of crisp lightly metallic adjunct with a clean dry finish. Mouthfeel is light having good body and carbonation. Not one of the smoothest lagers I've had, but not bad."
"Poured my PBR into a frosty mug. It poured a medium gold with a foamy white head. It didn't reveal much nose but, I wasn't expecting much. For a Sunday afternoon watching football with your friends beer, it's perfect. I have not tasted PBR in quite some time, but I am glad I tried it again. I will definitely buy this again."
"well, considering the metal tap and mouth opening makes the brunt of the taste I would say this is worse than the bud cans. the feel and colour and the drinkability is the same in comparison to the standard nonlight versions of the macros."
"Availability and price are great and your supporting an american union labor supporting (I still think there closed shop) brewery!"
"Average drinkability, not bad, not great.,"
"It's funny, because at my store we get old dudes coming in all the time saying I can't believe they still make PBR! Same with Schaffer, and a few others. Anyways, I tried out PBR, and I must say for a very cheap beer, I was kind of impressed. This beer remains to be a staple in American Beer, and continues to deliver the essence of American culture, namely the 60s'-80s' This beer has a light gold color, with a silky mouthful, that lingers on your palate well after consuming a sip. An easy beer to chug, and an easy beer to buy, very assessable and generic. PBR is very drinkable, while maybe not the best, but certainly not the worst. Kudos."
"Very nice beer to have. Great session beer. If I am short on money this is one of the beers I think about."
"All around average beer. I won't badmouth this one because it delivers what it promises to be - an unassuming beer for the masses. I've purchased in the past, and will purchase again."
"It's an average beer all around, but maybe that's why I like it so much. Cheap, easy drinking, and a step up from the mass-market lights. I <3 my PBR."
"M: Watery..."
"Did not like much of anything about the king of college beers PBR. Other than the fact it was very cheap and a fairly smooth drink, it was not a pleasant experience drinking my first and only PBR. The appearance was your standard yellow American lager but once poured had very little foam and basically looked like urine that had been sitting around for a while. Taste left a lot to be desired, one of the worst beers I've ever had to be honest. If you plan on getting drunk and don't want to pay much for it, then go for some PBR. If you actually want to enjoy your beer, I would recommend something else."
"This is a surprisingly good macro. It's still a macro, to be sure, but it's not a complete watery, fizzy mess like I've come to expect. I actually enjoyed this, and you absolutely can't beat that price. Think this'll be my new go-to macro."
"RJT"
"complex - no. However, a clear win in domestic adjuncts!"
"4/3.5/3/3/4"
"At least now I can say that I've tried it and it confirms my suspicions that people drink it because it's trendy. Not because it's especially good."
"This is a very pale copper yellow color, clear with minor carbonation. The head quickly resolves to a thin white ring. Lacing is short lived. The aroma is mild cereal with a kiss of lemon. The taste is simple bread and slightly spicey citrus. A little bit of bite from the carbonation so it's reasonably refreshing, though not over bubbly. Certainly very drinkable. Nothing horribly wrong here, better than a lot of easy drinking macro types."
"which is the point afterall. kudos for the cheap and alright."
"Medium to low body, there is a strong aftertaste, mild sweetness up front. Aftertaste negatively affects drinkability. Overall not as good as I remember."
"Taste is enhanced by a decent yeast strain that is marginally sweet. Minimal hop presence, probably something like East Kent Goldings or Glacier. Those seem to be always used when you can't taste much hops. Mouthfeel, meh. But, hey this stuff is very drinkable, they get better the more you have."
"If you like freedom, buy some PBR, probably tastes better than other US macros (ie bud and coors), but unlike those, PBR is actually made in the USA,also it usually is significantly cheaper than its US macro competition. If you want to get some cheap beer, PBR is a solid choice, Get Some!"
"It's the beer that party kids who actually enjoy beer tend to buy, and there's no shame in that at all. A little more taste, a little more depth, and a little more character than almost any of the other macros out there. Of course, make no mistake, it's $11.99 a case (!) for a very legitimate reason. Just rest easy knowing that you're not drinking Bud Light. =)"
"Overall/notes: I bowled a 202 game (first over 200, pretty awesome) and this was the best the bowling alley had to offer. I'm not disappointed at all. I mean, it works for what it is, and that's fine with me! There are better out there, but not too bad."
"Pabst Blue Ribbon, also known as ""PBR", not bad for a gold beer. IT is smooth and worth the $. ZI now know why it has become a cult classic, and song made referencing it."
"Drinkability: Better than some absolutely horrible offerings, but not quite as easy to drink for binge drinking purposes as some cheaper shittier stuff. Pretty easy to drink i guess, and cheap. But tastes pretty bad. Wouldn't get it again."
" I judge this beer as an American lager. I prefer Bocks myself, but you can't really compare Bocks to lagers or to wheat beers, and so on. And as an American lager, Pabst Blue Ribbon is as good as any."
"This award-winning beer has been poured form a chilled bottle into a 12oz ""pint"" glass. The beer is a very clear straw color, with a good sized white foam head that dissipated quickly. There are plenty of carbonation bubbles rising up in the glass. This aroma is a yeast and some grain, probably corn. The taste is typical of the style, with plenty of sweet corn grain and other malts; the hops a non-existent to the point that the brewer may have forgot to include them. Although the carbonation is above average, it doesn't affect the mouthfeel negatively. There is a bit of coating and stickiness from the high sugar content, but it isn't too bad. I find PBR to be exceptionally drinkable, if I am in the mood for it. I don't get tired of it and usually only need to cut myself off when I know it's time to prevent a hangover. This is my go-to beverage when I'm out on the town and don't feel like spending much money. There is something reassuring knowing I can get a 16oz tall boy at nearly any bar in town; thanks hipsters!"
"It has a good mouth feel with just enough carbonation. Very drinkable and minimally filling. I could drink these all day (and have)."
"D- If you can get past the canned corn and lack of character, good drinkability."
"Drinkability: An exceptionally drinkable beer and a great brew for the price. Much better than your typical light or adjunct lager and just as inexpensive. This'll be my ""cheap beer"" for a while to come."
"Drinkability: Definitely a better choice than the ""big three"" macros. A simple beer with good character."
"D- Drinkability is high, due to a better flavor profile than the others and a overall more laid back drinking sensation to me. Easily my favorite of all the ""big"" adjunct lagers."
"The drinkability woudl be decent if it wasn't for the fact that I feel sick whenever I drink PBR. I don't think this hit me until I bought a case of it. I think people tend to regard PBR as a good alternative to bud, but IMO bud is made a lot better and doesn't leave me with a hangover or make me feel a little sick."
"As a 36 year old mom jean wearing non-hipster I cannot explain my fondness for this brew. Is it the centuries old award for which this beer is named? Is it the ""its not Bud"" factor? Is it the dirt cheap price? All possible. On tap is my preferred method of consuming mass quantities of this classic. Its slightly sweeter tasting this way and has no unpleasant vegetal flavor that is common to the canned version. After 1-2 $2 pints of this bad boy the drinkability is off the charts!"
"D- Amazing, I can drink this beer anytime, any where. I've had one PBR and have been happy, and I've had 30 and have been ever more happy. Perfect for any occasion."
"Notes - A good mouthfeel with carbonation making an appearance only to carry the beer to the back of the throat. Simply a good beer."
"Now when I go to parties where I'm a new comer I always take PBR. Because no one really wants to drink it and easy to spot if someone is raiding your cooler."
"Overall: The mouth feel is light and carbonated. The body of the beer is light and light finish. It is a descent beer, and taste a bit better than a bud."
"So sometimes, the family needs something basic. And Pabst does the job. So, a night of cards, board games, a backyard fire, and Pabst works out. Even for the beer snob in the family."
"I like the drinkability of it in light of the dry finish. It's definitely something I could have a nice night out, pacing it and drinking without getting all out of shape and spending a ton."
"D - Cult classic, like evil dead. Very smooth, barely heavier than water."
"You can pay more for a macro brewed lager, but you won't get a better example than this."
"My beer of choice for this category. Really an easy drinking and tastes much better than some of the other adjunct lagers out there. Of course, if you can get it on tap, it's always nice and it usually tastes a little fresher, but I like it even out of the can."
"Pabst has a weak flavor, but just enough that when combined with its good amount of carbonation, gives you something that is easy to palette, easy to drink, and easy to finish. its like the student who always gets ""C"s. never failing, but never really never going above and beyond. In that sense its dependable."
"I had this beer at a little get together, it was the first time in probably 15 years since I've had a PBR. This is bland, tasteless, totally innocuous, easy to drink, refreshing, with a touch of malt but nothing too much else. The thing that perplexes me most about adjunct lagers is that they are largely tasteless. It is like parsing the finer qualities of water, there is just a flat palate of flavors from which to choose. There is nothing bad about a PBR, there just isn't much there."
"taste , mouthfeel and drinkability :grainy with a metallic after taste ."
"Good old PBR. If I have to choose a cheap grocery-store adjunct, this is the beer I reach for. It doesn't really repulse me like many other macro adjunct lagers, rather this beer is quite refreshing. A typical grainy adjunct taste with a slightly sweet/metallic aftertaste. High amounts of carbonation and a light body. All in all, a smooth drinker that's easy to finish."
"I always associated PBR as an ""old man"" beer. My brother-in-law (he's not an old man) had some at the house and since I'm no beer snob, I gave it a shot. It was surprisingly ""OK"". Not a bad beer, not great. Average in all regards. For my money, this is a good beer for drinking with like-minded beer fans while watching a game, etc."
"No, PBR is not good beer. It is not bad beer. It has no color, really, no smell, and the only distinctive feature of the taste is a metallic piquant. Moderate carbonation and thin. Drinkability is fairly good: after all, it was made to be consumed easily. PBR has good street cred. Generations have relied upon it, and even in this era it has its uses: on a given night when one is tired and has the blues, and faces the convenience store dilemma of what kind of alcohol to imbibe, a 24 oz. PBR and a bag of peanuts is more than enough to help one cope."
"This American lager has quite a cult following, but not much better or worse than its peers. Still, a good choice for the price, and a 12-pack in my refridgerator helps me space out my indulgence into better beer."
"Look, we can't always drink hand crafted deluxe microbrews, some times we need to mix it up, or maybe just get drunk. PBR is my ""Getting-Trashed-and-Watching-Football"" beer. As far as cheap beer goes, it tastes alright and is pretty smooth. The best thing about PBR is how much of it an average person can drink. I'm not saying that it is a weak beer, only that it flows smoothly, goes down easy, and stays down. Great for tailgating and drinking games, if you aren't feeling snobby and just want to pound some brews for the sake of doing so, go grab the Blue Ribbon!"
"Not so bad, as far as adjunct lagers go. Doesn't really distinguish itself from the crowd, but goes down just fine."
"Ok, on taste alone this was pretty drinkable, at least if you're not expecting beer brilliance, but a decent easily accessable brew. I might even pay for the next one."
"D-Very easy drinking, although somewhat lacking in taste. Beats BMC hands down."
"As the ads used to say, PBR me ASAP. Occasionally I want an easy drinking beer and PBR fits the bill. Not bad for a sub-premium, I actually prefer it at times since it seems to be a little more flavorful than the BMC products."
"Long live PBR!"
"I really enjoy this beer, I drink it a lot and if the choices (or wallet) are slim this is not a bad choice at all."
"Not really, but still better than other beers at a similar price. When you don't have the money to drink ""good"" beer, at least PBR will always be there for you. Not much finish or aroma, but a crisp and refreshing taste."
"Ahh what can you say about good ole' PBR. For the cheap price it is the best beer you can get. Easy to drink. You can pound multiple of them if that is what you're feeling or you can relax and enjoy a couple. Like I said before it definately is the best cheapest beer out there. Try it out."
"I feel a sense of pride when I drink this beer.This is a classic american lager that I hold close to my heart so it is going to be hard to say anything negative about this beer,My cousin and I used to sneak this brew from my grandmother's fridge when we were just 11 or 12 and take it to the woods and drink them for my first ever buzz.Great beer Great price it pours an appealing light gold color It smells like sweet corn and malt.It taste like liquid gold.The mouthfeel is a little sub par but not enough to complain.The drinkability is unsurpassable but hey I'm biased."
"Had this as a kid growing up years ago. Still tastes and smells the same....grainy with little other aroma or flavor. Finish is short lived and non-descript. However, this one takes me back to my factory-working, ball-playing, running around days, so I have to like it some."
"D- I think I would enjoy this more out of a can, the appeal of this went away after 6 oz or so. Did not finish my pint."
"I mean I've shotgunned hundreds of these I'm sure as this was my go to beer in highschool, so maybe a hold a bit of a soft spot in my heart for this beer. I feel my rating is fair considering im reviewing with the style in mind however."
"In conclusion, it is what it is. For a totally utilitarian beer, you could do worse, & I'll have it as a last resort. But is that really the point?"
"m&d: medium bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation. Easy to drink and a great session beer. A good choice over the other BMC crap."
"Taste is especially quenching at first because there is not too much malt sweetness in the beginning. Some mild bitterness, slightly floral, slightly skunky. Not sure how it could resemble skunk when it was in a can, slightly berrylike. Probably one of the better adjunct lagers just because it isn't too sweet. Light body and medium carbonation, feels quite nice. Drinks lighter than most adjunct lagers and not as sweet."
"D- again this is made for mass consumption and that is about all, it is a better than most mass produced beers but is still lacking. Enjoy though if you are a hipster"
"I had it poured from the tap."
"D: It is very easy beer to drink. To me (and my bro) it is just like drinking water."
"(On a side note, no other beer retains its flavor like PBR whether it is warm or cold...the taste is the same. Excellent camping beer.)"
"D-Drinkable, as one of the brews that I've had the pleasure with which to session."
"Drinkability: One of the best of the cheapo American beers, along with Miller High Life (though PBR is way better than MHL), but Schlitz still takes the crown."
"DRK: As good from the first sip to the last."
"D - Well, it's m-fing PBR. Drinkability is fairly high because it's light as hell."
"Notes, I did like this one better than like a Miller or Coors, I found it more bearable and actually enjoyed this beer at the party."
"Probably one of the best value beers on the market its a nice change up from a world filled with dopplebocks and imperial stouts"
"Poured into my pilsner glass a pale yellow with a big white head on top. Little lacing on the glass. Smells like cheap grains, sweet corn, and bread. The mouth is really thin and wet. Very slick. Flavor is cheap and buttery. Not a whole lot going on here, but that's expected. I liked this in the past, but this is not that good now."
"The best value around here as I can get a pitcher of it anytime for $3. Tastes better than the other American macros and more drinkable as well. I've drank so much of this stuff I'm sure it's part of my DNA. I only hope they don't use any genetically modified ingredients!"
"This is the best beer for your money. Being a poor college student I can't find a better deal. Most bars do 5$ pitchers and a 12 pack is 7$. It's not fancy and its not going to blow your mind in any way but it sure beats Bud, Coors, Miller, any day of the week. It won a blue ribbon didn't it?"
"D: Easily one of the toughest beers for me to choke down. I can't find much good to say about this beer but I'll refrain from bashing it."
"Overall this is one of the better options out there as far as macro's go. Obviously I'd prefer craft beer but this isn't a terrible back-up."
"This is very drinkable, and for the price is hard to beat."
"Pretty good for my ""go to"" beer. Nice and light, good cold on a nice hot summer day. I used to drink Busch, but this shit is way better. Great color on tap or even out of the can. Had a sweet keg of it on July 4th, doesn't get much more American than that. Enjoy with a nice veggie burger."
"Light bodied with lots of fizzy carbonation. Overall, pretty inoffensive and makes for a good cheap guzzler on a hot day."
"Nothing special, just an easy drinking American-Style Lager. I think PBR has become more trendy lately, as the price of a 30-rack has went up from $13 to $17. Still, its cheaper than the big 3, and definetely better as well. Seems to be hoppier and creamier on tap than from the can or bottle. Solid choice when you're low on funds."
"D: You can definitely put down a lot of them, and PBR is a lot better tasting than most beers in this style."
"D: This is one of the better macro lagers around, but still isn't anything special. But after mowing the lawn on a hot summer day, a few PBR's definitely hit the spot."
"Other than that it's on par if not slightly above in taste and drinkability when compared to other commercial American Adjunct Lagers."
"D: Well, it's drinkable for sure--one of those beers you could pound back a few, but I'm not sure if that makes it a beer you would want to spend the time enjoying and drinking throughout the night."
"Poured from a 24 ounce can into a Pilsner glass. Very tasty on a hot day. Sweet, corny taste. Nice and cold this is a favorite. For the price it is a classic. Don't look for anything special just expect a solid great American made classic. This beer flows down on a hot day."
"typical american macro imo except that it excels in taste and drinkability . and for the price, i think i found a new beer to keep my fridge stocked with other than yuengling lager which is slightly heavier. pbr seems to be a love it or hate it beer overall but id have to say i love it. decent american adjunct but ALOT cheaper and tastier. i was pleasently surprised."
"Notes: This beer is far from perfect, but if your having a drunken party and need alot of beer for cheap that you can stomach with a smile there's no better place to turn. Value wise this beer gets a 5."
"d- very drinkable, super cheap, refreshing, i think this is my new go to 30-pack for 13 dollars, crazy, nice hop smack though, perfect for a session on a nice hot day."
"I don't normally buy macros but I have not had a PBR in quite some time. Super light yellow in color, generous billowing head, it looks like the stereotypical fizzy yellow lager. Smells like an earthy lager, not bad at all. More earthiness in the flavor, minerals, a fleeting hint of sweet fruitiness. For the price this is not a bad beer at all and makes a very good summer bbq/picinic/lawnmower beer."
"I met my wife drinking this stuff one December evening. She glanced over, looked at my can and said ""I guess we're all out of money this time of night."" A classic."
"Cheers!!!"
"I will still pick up a six pack every now and then for a picnic or day at the beach."
"Was a thin bodied beer with alot of carbonation. I could put alot of them down though with out feeling them."
"Mouthfeel was thin and slightly flat. But very drinkable ice cold on a hot day after some physical labor. Fine for a macro - actually pretty good for a macro. This, Simpler Times and 'Gansett would be my go-tos to keep around for that kind of thing."
"Pours a yellow color which is very light with a small one finger head. The smell is of cheap grains. The grain smell is of rice and corn, not as faint as other macros. The taste is of grain, rice and corn. The mouthfeel is of very high carbonation. The drinkability is average for a macro, not too bad not too good, more flavor than most macors."
"""its a beer for modern livin"""
"Pabst Blue Ribbon is great to use in a large container when cooking bratwurst prior to hitting the grill."
"drinkability is ok but i will stick with stag as my goto macro"
"Overall my favorite macro. Don't let my poor review distract you. If you are strapped for cash reach for PBR!"
"D: great beer to drink on a hot day or just to get a buzz when your broke i like this beer alot its way better than the coors, bud and miller"
"From a 12 oz. can . Pours a pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smells of corn and malts. Taste is crisp,some malts finishes somewhat bitter, not bad but not full of flavor. Feels watery in the mouth. It is fairly drinkable, good for drinking games. The best thing about this beer is the price tag."
"Drinkablity - One of the most drinkable Macros out there. It's a staple go-to thirst quencher for me. If you're looking for complexity and full bodiedness, then an American Adjunct Lager (AAL) is not going to make the cut. If you want to quench your thirst or throw back a few beers, then this is a great option. I can't stand guys that give this and other decent AAL's bad ratings just because it's not a ""kick you in the ass full bodied sipper."" You need to respect the style, respect beer."
"Drinkability- Has always been my go to macro when I have one...the only one I stock on a semi-regular basis in my own home. Drinkable any day."
"Normally, I'm not a big fan of adjunct lagers, but PBR gets props in my book for being a hell of a lot better than the vast majority of other beers of this style, and that it can be found for very cheap, more so than Bud, Miller, or Coors. A good option for something cheap, or party beer. It's no craft brew, but that's not what it's meant to be. The best of it's kind in my opinion."
"D: If I'm having this style of beer, winding down on a hot day or after working/playing outdoors, this is a fine one to reach for. Not in my regular rotation, but certainly easy to drink when I do have reason to have one. PBR carries a stigma locally as a 'hipster' beer, for whatever reason gaining favor with the cool kids several years ago. Though there's plenty of great local craft options here, I suppose they could do worse than quaffing down ass-loads of PBR. I can appreciate as being among the best of it's kind."
"This is yet another kegger beer. Perfect for getting hammered and little else. A beer pong staple. Goes good with pizza too. It is good for a really cheap beer. I have to give it that. For what it is I guess I can't complain. It tops the light beers but still is far from good in my book."
"I'll pass on this one every time. There are much better adjunct lagers out there including Coors Original/Blatz among others."
"Better than expected for a cheap beer. It has more flavor of hops than any other similarly priced beer I've had. From the can the beer tends to be over carbonated, but is normally better on-tap. My personal favorite from the cheap easy to drink category."
"Meh, its PBR. its not very good but thats not why you buy it. since i'm pretty sure everyone has had this or knows someone who has, all i'll add is i prefer high life for the price point. Something in the flavor just didn't apeal to me, perhaps i'll try this on tap one day and see if its any better. but for the can.... don't bother trying."
"Lawn mowing and golfing i could drink this anytime, OH! and floating on the river in need of some good cheap beer to bring along"
"Drinkability: This isn't bad. It's not the best thing I've ever had, but it has its charm."
"D) It's PBR!"
"Normally I wouldnt go near this type of beer but I was at a wedding over the weekend and the reception was a macro-fest and this was the best offering. No glass-ware to be had so I had it straight from the can. Very muted smell, not as grainy as I expected given the type. Slight metallic aroma and taste which is to be expected. Pretty watery but very easy to drink on a hot day. Over all I was surprised by this one, not sorry I had it but wont look for it again."
"This is a very cheap beer. You get what you pay for. But out of all the cheap beers this isn't a horrible choice, especially when you compare it to the bud's or miller's, it is actually better. While anyone would prefer a better quality beer...this is not a horrible cost effective way to go for those on a very tight budget."
"I went for a hot dog at Crif Dogs in NYC. And for a dollar extra I got myself a PBR. To be honest, it wasn't as sour as I had expected. It really lacked any real taste. It was almost like a beer version of vitamin water, sans the health kick. What ever. For a buck, you get what you get."
"As expected the body was nearly non-existent. The beer was very drinkable, in the same way water is. Avoid this beer."
" Its poured a very yellow golden color with little white head and too much carbonation. The smell was what you expect from and adjuct...corny and grainy. It tasted very differetn from the usual BMC beers though. A bit sweeter? Maybe? Im not sure how to nail it, not bad though. It felt like water in the mouth with a bit of carbonation. Drinkability was great. Awesome session beer for the price. Not bad at all."
"Out of a can this infamous hipster beer was a bleached gold color with one finger of white head. The retention of a thin layer of foam and a collar was good and the lacing was in bands at first then streaks later on. The semi-sweet aroma was of macro grains, sweet corn, pale malt and a touch of alcohol. The flavors were dry and semi-sweet. Pale malt, a little bright citrus, grains, lots of acidity and a crisp finish. Clean and refreshing; definitely a step above its comparable cohorts. The mouthfeel was good but a bit slick and oily, the body was medium and the carbonation medium/high."
"D - Very drinkable. This beer is like a potato chip. Once you pop the top you cant stop"
"D: I have to admit, this has some nostalgic appeal for me because my grandmother drank this religiously. But it's actually fairly decent on its own merits. Definitely the best of the super-cheap beers. I hate to admit it, but the hipsters might be on to something."
"Drinkability: On a hot summer day, and this is cold, it's a really nice choice to have around if other brews aren't available. For the price, it's tough to beat for a barbecue. Certainly there are better beers (read: much, much more flavor and complexity), but I won't knock on PBR with everything else that's out there."
"Maybe a touch better (all things being relative) than many of the other adjunct lagers that I've had from south of the border, or here, for that matter, but it may very well be time to cut, or just plain give up that God-damned ribbon already."
"Better than Bud and Miller.... A refreshing take on Mass Quantity Beer...."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer to be honest. It doesn't make you have to think about it. Not impressive at all but also a good beer for the summertime and a steady stand by when the going gets tough."
"D= awesome. Summer session, lawnmower whatever you call it quality. Extremely cheap and tasty."
"Despite the less than steller reviews, PBR is the best cheap beer money can buy. It is essentially like drinking alcoholic water. If your short on cash but want to throw a few down, don't deviate with other crappy mass produced American lagers, grab a PBR."
"PBR always impresses. Here is a very inexpensive beer that while very good in a bottle is even better on tap. When served at 40-45 degrees F. and drunk relatively quickly, PBR is one of the most satisfying warm weather brews bar none. It is head and shoulders better than the big 3 and is a cut above Molson Canadian Lager and many microw brews which cost significantly more money. The character is malty with nice smooth body and vanilla notes predominate. The hops are faint but pleasant, something unusal at this price point."
"Tastes very grainy, husky and a bit dirty. But overall, not a bad American macro. This is one of the few macros I've had that actually reminds me (somewhat) of a real German pilsner. Kiss of hops. You could do a lot worse than PBR. Let's hope that you don't have to."
"I had not had a pbr in years....i shall purchase another 6! good slammer beer...good for bbq....spicy food, etc.. cheap too!! For sitting and chillin...heavy beer....serious eatin of greasy, spicy working mans food....bingo!"
"D - One of my favorite cheap beers, it's not half bad and it certainly is an easy drinker. Probably the first time I've ever had it outside a can."
"Drinkability: In the battle of cheap American Adjuncts this is king. We all know its nothing special but thats the point, its a non-pretentious, simple beer for when things get tedious. You can relax and have a few because you know its cheap. Don't even bother taking it out the can its better that way. So bring it anywhere. I love craft beer, tasting and drinking it are a big part of my life, but sometimes drinking expensive beers at parties or just for the hell of it well can get expensive, so to make this already long story short this is a cheap as dirt beer thats drinkable. Plus it'll get you drunk."
"Drinkability - I don't know. I'm looking forward to finishing this so I can enjoy something real. What a waste."
"A beer like this has good drinkability. As for how many of these one can take, I do not know, but it was easy to put this one away. Cheers!"
"12 oz bottle. Poured a golden straw color with a large, short lived fizzy white head. Aroma of hops, corn, and subtle berry fruits. Slightly metallic.Taste accents of malt and corn. Slightly bland but better than many others for the price. Not very interesting but not bad at all. Overall, I must say that I am impressed by this beer, not simply because of the bargain price for which I bought it, but because I think it tastes good. I have heard a lot of harsh comments about PBR, but I have to say that it is, in my book, a highly underrated beer."
"There is not much to a PBR. Classic American Pilsner, as light as water with about as much taste, but unlike water, PBR is 5%. A great beer for a buck in a can at almost any bar around town. Personally I find myself spending money at beer stores rather than bars due to the mark up. So PBR is nothing to rave about but it is cheep, drinkable and gets the job done. As I say to my beer snob friends, ""it is the best of the worst"". And now Pabst is the oldest American owned brewery in the country. ""America! Fuck Yeah!"""
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a golden-yellow color with a very small, fizzy white head. Aroma is straw and grains. Flavor is corn, straw, and maybe a light touch of hops. Mouthfeel is very light, watery, and a hint of bitterness. Mainly just an altogether bland beer, not offensive, drinkable but not all that good."
"Overall: Great, cheap evreryday beer especially in this economy. Look forward to putting a few back tonight."
"Maybe it's not even beer--maybe it's a sort of alcoholic corn soda. But whatever you call it, I will certainly have another."
"I'll try it in a can and i hope its as good in a can as it is in a bottle."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The texture begins nice and prickly, with the bubbles very small and alive. It does thin out in a few seconds, but it never ends up too boring. Besides my last experience with Ballantine a few years back, this is the only macro I can recall actually enjoying from a glass. An easy choice for the big BBQs this year until things turn around economically."
"Drinkability - Goes down smooth"
"this beer pours a crystal clear golden color with a tall white head that recedes to lacing. the aroma doesn't present much but a lightly malty lager smell. the taste is once again predominantly of light malt and whatever it is those little bottom feeders do. the mouthfeel is of course light with a crisp aggressive level of carbonation. of course this is a very easy beer to drink, but I'm not sure that makes the drinkability all that great."
"Pabst Blue Ribbon pours a mild yellow in my glass. The head is just one shade darker than a Miller High Life. Smells and tastes better than your average American Adjunct Lager. There is a little something better here than most other American Adjunct Lager's. It has a somewhat pleasant flavor that I could drink from time to time. Beats out Miller High Life by a few point and is now my favorite AAL."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a crisp, pilsner malt and adjunct scent that's light and dry. The taste is decent. It has a smooth pilsner malt flavor that low on hops and clean in the finish. It's a warm weather brew, no doubt. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer. It's one of the only macro lagers I drink."
"M-D- Smooth as water feel with a mild dry ending. Easy to drink and doesn't make you feel like crap in the morning after mass drinking sessions."
"D: Definitely a beer that goes down easily. I was through my mug in a flash. PBR does its job without much fanfare. It's at least on par with the more expensive BMC mainstays. Perhaps this is my new yard work beer?"
"Not a bad beer for a cookout with friends and a grill. Great summer beer. Does it's job as a refreshing beverage. I would take a Narragansett over it any time though while in the New England area."
"D- Buy a 30 its so cheap and see how many ou can throw back haha not recomended .. gave my a killer hangover"
"Very average..."
"Drinkability: easy because it's so weak"
"Overall, this is one macro I could keep stocked in my fridge. I never thought I could enjoy a beer this cheep, but it exceeded my expectations by far."
"Cheers to PBR! The best of the worst."
"It had a nice golden appearance with a decent head. I got a wheaty/cereal aroma. It was dry and crisp and pretty drinkable. This isn't the most flavorful beer and fairly typical for an adjunct lager, but it should not be totally discounted. A good beer for when you are done cutting the lawn."
"goes down good"
"But seriously, for $4 a six pack, you could be doing a lot worse."
"Respect beer! Respect PBR!"
"Hey...it won a blue ribbon at some point, didn't it?"
"What else can I add?"
"D: drinkable. Much better than standard adjunct lagers."
"Drinkability: I can drink this refreshing beer any time. It's great with BBQ and grilled food. It's carbonation it great for celebrating events because it's a champagne of beer ... oh wait i think thats taken."
"Drinkability: In reality, while I may have had a rough bottle, and it there's truly nothing that strikes me as remotely remarkable about it, it would be easy to drink quite a few of these in a session because it is so light and easy (take that for what it is) to drink."
"D-Flows like honey."
"This has officially replaced Old Style as my cheap lager of choice. How's that for high praise?"
"Drinkability is the strong suit for this brew. I drank mine right after mowing the lawn in the warm Florida sun. It went down easy and tasted pretty good. For the price, this is a good brew to keep around for hot summer days and friends or neighbors who prefer macro lagers."
"I like this beer."
"Atmosphere is kinda' what you'd expect from a macro brew. . . not much to speak of. Flavor is more than serviceable. Feel is non-offensive. Overall, decent quaff. . . I would go so far as to say, comfortably above average as far as macros go."
"A friend of mine drinks this beer often and offers me one now and then. At first I tried to get used to the taste(if you call it that). But now I can't stand it. It's probably one of the worst beers I've had."
"D: A very simple premium Lager; clean and light. I find this to be much more bearable than say Budweiser or Miller. A go-to beer for pizza or other such cheap foods, and great to enjoy with friends. It's not something I would stick with all the time, or even most of the time. Yet, it's uncomplicated and can be a great change of pace from heavy or pretentious beers."
"D: Easily the most drinkable and clean of the adjunct lagers. The faint hop character makes this seem like a decent beer when faced with pour choices, can be consumed very easily in mass quantities, and is actually a bit refreshing."
"It's fun to take a break from really intense beers, and ever once in a while, just crack open a can of simple, decent brew. PBR is certainly not the greatest beer ever, but for what it is, and how much it costs, It's difficult to beat. It's bright yellow, Impossibly clear, energetically carbonated, and it hangs onto a layer of head for long enough to respect. The smell is pure, simple, clean. Corn and other adjuncts. The flavor is acceptable. There's a tiny tang of metallic discordance in there, but it's not loud enough to be offensive. Other than that, this is a light, refreshing, clean and simple beer. Easy to drink and feels good in my mouth."
"The taste is similar, and like the bottle or can, grain with a light grassy hop bite with the faintest hint of lemon, clean flavours and a light, crisp bitterness. Compared to the can or bottle, on tap, it has an even stronger, fuller, more lasting taste of strong, fresh grain that lingers long after the finish."
"Drinkability - Its PBR. You can drink a few without even noticing. Overall, its never going to be fantastic, but its nothing to scoff at, especially for the price. Always my choice over B/M/C."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I remember having a more flavorful (PBR) in the past. What happened? This time around, no flavor, watery, to lite, and no aroma. It definitely left something to be desired, and I'm frankly a little disappointed. On the other hand, this beer is highly sessionable, easy to toss back a few on a warm day, or drink all night. I think I might go with Bud over this though, just wasn't impressed with this one. I'd pass."
"Overall this beer is not something i'd buy, but I still like it over other macros such as the dreaded bud. If nothing else i'll drink it in honor of blue velvet. PBR!"
"Overall, my favorite of the cheap brews. During such pressing economic times, you shouldn't feel the need to cut back on flavor, even if you need to cut back on price. As an already broke college student, I have no qualms about suggesting this fine beer for any occasion. This is one heck of a value for the $, and I wish other brands at this price point could compare to the almighty PBR. Whether watching the big game or out grilling with neighbors, no beer is more drinkable than Pabst Blue Ribbon."
"D - I have to say that I could see myself drinking this beer during the summer in a session but I'm going to put the rest of this 12 pack on hold for now..."
"Pours a straw yellow color with a fizzy, sudsy white lacing which quickly dissipates. Aroma is pretty one-dimensional with light grain, corn, hay, with the faintest whiff of some light fruit and hops. Mouthfeel is accurate for the style, light and loose with lots of spiky carbonation. Taste is like the nose, although there is a little bit more evidence of the hops (although still negligible). Not overly sweet, finishes a little dry. Drinkability is high, since I basically use this beer as a substitute for soda. Overall, this beer exemplifies its style very well. It is not totally devoid of flavor. And it also doesn't smash you over the head with sweetness like Yuengling Traditional does. $6.50 a 12-pack doesn't hurt either."
"Best in America in 1893... times have changed."
"I know this wasn't the best formatted review, but I can't contribute anything that hasn't already been said, and by more eloquent reviewers. Just wanted to give my endorsement FWIW."
"Drinkability: This is where I feel PBR shines. The smooth, balanced, and not overly-strong PBR can be drank in the dozens. Great for tail-gating, block parties, and basically situations where you will be drinking all day."
"Drinkability: great if you don't mind the smell. There's not much to overwhelm you here."
"I'll leave this one to 13 year old kids who are trying to get sponsored in snowboarding."
"Overall: Standard mouthfeel for the style, maybe a little on the carbonated side. Very drinkable as well. one of my favorite adjuncts."
"D - I could drink this all day (and I have). When all is said and done, I think this might be the most highly drinkable beer I've ever encountered. Even for an American lager, the drinkability is exceptional. The carbonation can be a bit overwhelming, but if you just take your time, it shouldn't be a barrier."
"This is a great beer when you arent needing/wanting a Great beer. Its great with some bbq or just kicking back watching a game or after some yard work."
"This beer poured alight yellow with a single-finger head that didn't last long with a lot of visible carbonation. The smell is grainy malt that's very typical of the style. The taste is slightly sweetness that doesn't last long with a pretty clean finish. The mouthfeel is watery, but crisp due to the fairly aggressive carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer by design. Not the worst six-pack you can get if you only have $4, but there's definitely a reason it hasn't won an award since 1893."
"Poured from the ""Blue-Ribbon"" can into a glass this brew has a thin looking golden wheat color with a little white head that fizzles down to nothing. The aroma is of yeast, rice, corn and light malts. The taste is clean (a little watery), nice crisp carbonation, and some light alcohol after taste. Honestly on a day when all I did was house work and had a mighty thirst, this hit the spot. For the price almost can't beat."
"I do not see what the hype is about this beer aside from the fact that its cheap. But so are Natural light and Milwaukee's best. It tastes salty and does not feel good on the palate. It sets really heavy too. I will spend the extra money to get a better quality beer any day."
"PBR has the look and feel of a BMC product (yellow color, thin head, and robust carbonation). I think where this beer differers is in the taste. It has a little bit better taste than a BMC but not by much. The malt presence is slightly more noticeable, but other than that it's still very grainy and hints of corn. For the price difference for a 6/12/24 pack it's really anybody's call...."
"D- its hard to review this. its my go to""macro"" beer, but at the same time it doesnt really have anything that im looking for in a beer. for the style its one of the best ones as far as im concerned. but in the grand scope of all that is beer, its weak as best. take this with a grain of salt. im sure noone on here is looking for insight when it comes time to choose the ""best"" 30 can beer. however, i find this the easiest to consume of all of its peers."
"D: What can I say? I like this beer. It's very clean and has a grainy, somewhat rugged character for such a mainstream beer. Every time I try to hate on PBR, I just can't make myself do it."
"I know, its a cheap american macro, but it IS probably one of the best representatives of that genre. For some reason, PBR carries more of an image than the others (bud, miller, coors) and demands at least some respect from other bar patrons."
"Appears light,but golden,with a fragile and fast departing head.Decent lace.Classic aroma.Easy drinking,with knock out taste. Pairs well with most anything off the grill. grab some friends,some PBR,and relax."
"This beer pair perfectly with a pizza or a burger. Drinkability is hard to match in the style and it is very sessionable. It is going to be my 09 summer beer. I have heard good things about this beer, but I was holding out for the bottle, which is a little harder to find. I am very pleased and excited to have a new standard in my beer arsenal. Thanks."
"Smells and tastes like a Macro should. Mouthfeel ok. Drinkability is excellent at about 35F but go above 40 and watch out. PBR is a decent Macro swill but Budweiser is the best, Coors Banquet, Schmidt, Schlitz and Schell's O are better. I guess when it comes down to American Macro it is really about personal preference. One guy might like PBR the next guy Bud or Highlife or whatever you like to drink. The point is its American Macro or as I like to call it real BEER and that's why you drink it. Amen"
"D - Easy as f@#k to drink, if a little boring..."
"Overall: I can't understand why PBR has become the ""King of Cheap Beers"". Nothing special at all."
"The taste is...well...quite good actually. The hops are noticeable and the beer goes down extremely smooth. It is light tasting and the adjuncts are most certainly there, but shit, I'd take this over any BMC any day. For what it is, macro adjunct lager, it's one of my favorites. I could pound a good number of these."
"In simple words this is just a straight up standard easy drinking beer. Its cheap wherever you go typically like 2 dollar drafts or 3 dollar 16oz cans at bars or clubs, and you are getting what you pay for.More tasty than the big three offerings and always hits the spot even more so with BBQ or a nice juicy burger. Good townie bar beer...."
"Consumed out of frosted pint at my local bar, at a dollar a pint you really can't go wrong if you lookin to get wasted on macro swills.Its a great crisp/clean American macro lager, not much else to say about it. I like to have one to cleanse the palate every now and then. The Original. You might be a Redneck if ?"
" Hail to Pabst!"
"I've had plenty of these over the last few years when wanting something not particularly heavy nor needing to be thought over. It's a cheap beer that tasted not bad before but seems to be slightly better now. In fact, unlike other macros where it would be near impossible to taste any malt (usually they are tasteless or full of corn flavors), this beer does seem to present some malt sweetness that normally I'd associate with traditional lagers whether foreign or domestic. Still not much in the department of hops bitterness or floral citrus-like flavors. Maybe I've bought a bad batch (that means it was mistakenly made better), or my taste buds are improving or dying (you choose). Regardless, I'm enjoying these now."
"For the price, this is an honest beer with no complaints. I'd say it is above the average mark and for the price, it cannot be beat. Definitely towers over coors, miller, you name it. Do yourself a favor: when you're going out to buy a case of a beer that is on the cheaper side, stick with pbr or oldstyle. Oldstyle tastes the same as pbr in my experience (not the original oldstyle), it just has more of a bite."
"Very refreshing on a summer day, I know from experience."
"Taste is similar to most cheap beers. Very light, easy to drink more than you should. Nothing too great, but would take a blue ribbon over a bud light any day."
"PBR is a drinking to drink beer, and nothing else. But hey, we're supposed to reveiw these things for what they are, not what we want them to be. Do you complain when an IPA tastes like hops?"
"I drank this sitting in a hot tub at my hotel after a long day of skiing. I didn't pour it from the can, but looking in the mouth showed me what I already knew. This beer is about as clear yellow as it gets. The smell is grainy and not appealing. The taste isn't much better, metallic (like licking tin) but not so much so that it was offensive. Like many beers of the type, it was loaded with carbonation that stings the tongue and covers some of the lack of flavor. Its made to be drinkable, and it probably wouldn't be tough to spend a whole night knocking these back."
"D= any beer-fanatic could survive happily with PBR if they were stranded on a remote island and this was the only beer available. I say that kindly-- it's not a bad standard-stock inexpensive beer for basic swilling or dining. I can't argue when I just bought a 24-bottle case for $12 in January 2009."
"Drinkability- Well, one thing you can say for PBR is that it's drinkable, it's downright sessionable. This is a very light beer with no unpleasant adjunct flavors. Among the better American pils lagers, approximately on par with Miller High Life."
"taste is pretty boring it isnt bad just a generic lager without alot to it.overall not a real exciting or different beer but not a bad one"
"A mediocre brew, but a standard of mine, especially in this economy. You can get 12 oz cans at two for a dollar at some bars. That's what I call the ""perfect date"" beer."
"Overall, this is as good as American standards get. Freshness definitely matters here; as hop character will quickly fade and give way to corn the typical BMC profile. When fresh and served at a reasonable temp (not half frozen), this beer exemplifies the style and offers a thirst quenching, delicate beer that can entertain the most experienced palate."
"Nothing much to say about this brew. A very standard beer. Light flavor and light color. Not much of a head to speak of either. Being cheap is probably the best quality of this beer. If you're looking for quality, look elsewhere. Not bad for parties though."
"Mouthfeel: Watery and thin. It's hard to count that against PBR, though, as a thin mouthfeel is a trademark of the style."
"PBR isn't one of the best beers in the world, but it is one of the best for its style. It is inoffensive and easy to drink."
"D- excellent, this is one of the better representations of the style."
"It fills a void."
"Drinkability would be ok if I was still in college but I've moved on and this one doesn't cut it."
"I feel I owe a lot to this beer if only for the fact that it has brought me so many good times in my sometimes turbulent youth when my ungovernable instincts (sometimes Pabst-induced)led me to some riotous good times. Nothing is exceptional about this beer except its drinkability. You could drink ten of these and still talk to you friends about how cool ELO is (coherently). So again, all you 21-24 year olds, enjoy this one in your poverty-ridden youth. It will only last until you discover a better tasting cheap beer. Like Schlitz."
"It's clean and fizzy and thin and you can slam it down without thinking about it-- so long as you don't actually think about it."
"M/D: Very drinkable especially when you only have the selection of macro lagers."
"I'll pick it up every once in a while to have in the fridge. I think of it as a Lawnmowing Beer", something you drink after you do stuff in the yard in the summertime."
"A pale golden yellow pour with a fizzy white head.Aroma is slight skunk,and yes a kiss of hops. Flavor is pretty plain and watery.Some dry grain,corn,maybe come hops. Thin crisp mouthfeel.Tward the end of the glass I get some kind of a cardboard flavor. Drinkable but not my favorite."
"D - Very easy to drink. This one of the best 'cheap' beers to get."
"A very decent beer for that of an American Lager, which is saying something. Far better then Bud, Miller, or Coors. Of the three I think it tastes most like Bud, without the rice flavor coming through. Slight copper taste comes through but not unpleasant. Lots of Co2, but a little lacking on the lace. Good beer to pair with a white fish, also goes nice with a bbq pulled pork sandwich. All in all a very decent beer."
"Pours a light golden with a faint white head. Moderate carbonation. Aroma is your basic light corn, malt and wheat. Hints of citrus. Flavor is tart and crisp with more corn and light malt and a touch of caramel. Actually after many big stouts and IPA's this is a nice change."
"Drinkability: Acceptable! A counter-culture classic that's super cheap and provides just a bit of flavor (without hittin' you up with foul flavors)."
"A very sessionable beer. PBR always has a spot in my fridge when I want to keep it simple."
"I have no problem buying this beer and recommending it to anyone for just a simple good tasting Macro beer."
"FYI: in Telluride, this stuff is $1 a pint on tape, EVERYWHERE."
"D - For what its worth, its drinkable. Not a difficult task to throw back 6 or more over the course of a ball game."
"PBR pours a pale golden color and has a hint of sweet malt in the smell. The taste is better than most of the big macro American lagers. This is another one that I won't usually drink but can stand sometimes. Also another option for beer pong and the golf course."
"PBR is your best choice if your looking at a 24 pack."
"Had to try this one when I went to see Southern Culture on the Skids in Dayton, OH. It just seemed like the thing to do. It's not the worth beer I've ever had, but it's not the best either. It's not really even good. Just a watered-down American lager."
"Pours with a big foamy head that quickly dissipates into minimal lacing. Golden yellow and slightly hazy. Nose is sweet and malty. Touch of straw or grain. Taste is sweet, then a small punch of hops and then to a dryness. Beer coats the mouth and the carbonation helps balance the dryness. Overall, much better than BMC."
"I just wish PBR had Budweiser's reputation, because it's much better. The color is about a shade darker, and it actually has some flavor to it."
"This is a terrrible beer, and the fact there is worse out there doesn't make it any more deserving of praise. Absolute swill. As one complimentary reviewer mentioned, the empties are great for target practice the next morning. Frankly, I can't see any reason to make them empties. Full of beer or empty, target practice is all cans of this swill is good for. Don't kid yourself with the hype. This is not even remotely close to decent beer."
"ps mad props on the consistantcy , every PBR I have had has tasted the same.. dont know why hipsers love it so much.. well actually I do... its cheap"
"This is a great beer if you want something that taste like beer but your on a budget. Good anywhere, at the bar, a game, or just relaxing at the house."
"Pours with a little bit of head and lots of bubbles. This beer doesnt smell like a whole lot but it does have a little bit of taste. Fairly sweet tasting, loads of corn perhaps? It has no bit at all and the boozy taste is also fairly well hidden. Definitely one of the premier macros out there. Not really that offensive."
" This is not exactly complex but it's really not pretending to be."
"The appearance is a clear bright yellow, small wispy head that fades quick. Very bubbly and fizzy. It smells of clean milled grains, and a light whiff of hops. It Tastes of a mild astringent sweetness. The beer is followed off by a nice crisp hop presence. this actually tastes like beer compared to other American adjunct lagers"
"As a man who's proud to come form a long line of workin' stiffs, this is the stuff of legend in the working stiff community! Better than Bud, Miller, Or Coors, and at about half the price, why the hell Not:)"
"D - Basically astringent bitter water. Overall, substandard macro. Bitterer than the average, but without any flavour."
"This beer might not be my favorite as a beer and compared to crafts, but its the perfect beer for the most occasions. Chases most food really well, good party beer, and something to drink while watching sports/TV/movies. I'm also broke right now so this is always in my fridge."
"I respect PBR for trying to do something different, but that in no way excuses the bad taste. Pours a golden body and is extremely carbonated. The taste is overly metallic, but thankfully it is not as watery is many other cheap beers. There is a noticeable increase in taste however when drinking this from a bottle."
"I am not even going to lie. I am a big fan of PBR. It is really a beer that you cannot go wrong with. Yes, I know that it is a cheap American macro but to be honest it is one of the purest and less adjunct. Most of all it is a classic. I have had this in the can, on tap, and in the bottle and it still remains to be a versatile beer. It has a golden hay color to the body with usually some moderate carbonation bubble. It has usually a moderate head and just a little lace. For a cheap beer you can taste the hops and the malt. OK and some minor adjunct but no worse than a lot of the micro's people rave about. It is very crisp and refreshing. The body is light but not too light. You still know you are drinking a beer. It goes with almost any food and any occasion."
"D- This is a beer that will go down all night. GREAT stuff. I'll take a shot of Jim Beam with this one...yes!"
"This beats all the other lagers in the mainstream market. My choice for a simple, refreshing American Macro Lager. I'd choose this over a Bud of Coors any day. Crisp, clean, and refreshing. Perfect for a large outdoor gathering or BBQ. Easy on the wallet as well. A winner."
"Hands down, for a buck a beer in Ontario, this is the ultimate buck a beer, and my favorite discount macro. Whether it be out of a can or a bottle it simply is, the best cheap beer you can get! Give this one a try, don't listen to the fools."
"Overall, a pretty uninspiring beer. Certainly unoffensive (which can't be said of a lot of other macros) and the price is hard to beat."
"Best from a tap, but more fun to drink out of an outrageously large can, see if you can finish it before it gets warm."
"Pours a very clear yellow gold with a thin white head. Nose is grainy and smells like pee. Flavor is actually quite smooth. Slight sweet tone. Grainy kind of earthy tone. Feel has a thick carbonation that really makes me burp. Liquid feel is typical. This is an easy drinking lager IMO. For what it is, I don't think you can go wrong with it."
"Overall a great Amercian lager that is better than any of the other big macro brews of the same style. Also, price is amazing. This beer holds a special place in my heart and in my fridge as an easy drinking standby. Also, would never schedule a grill out or BBQ without at least a 12 pack or two on hand."
"D: man, got to be! I love this one and it always finds a place in my fridge. It is a toss up between PBR, Strohs, and Old Style for me...but I always go back to the Blue Ribbon when in need. Great price and for its kind a great adjunct Lager"
"Pretty drinkable, not a whole lot different than funky (just slightly) funky water."
"Saw this one at a local convenience store and decided to give it a try. Cheap, simple beer but all in all its not bad. Beats Bud, Miller and Coors for sure and for a macro-style lager it doesn't get much better. Would definitely make a great thirst quencher on a hot summer day."
"It's pretty much really drinkable because it's gulpably light and super cheap. I would drink lots of it if I was uber poor, and tonight, I was at the bar. So there you have it."
"Pours a four-fingered white head that quickly fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear, very pale amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is honey, very one-dimensional, hops are hidden, works as a lawn mower beer. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Barb's Beer Emporium Concord, NH."
"Drinkibility 3/5"
"Pale yellow with a big fluffy head that fades quickly into a thin collar of foam. Smell is of corn and grain with a faint hop in the background. Tastes like it should, no frills but light and pleasant like a macro lager should. Medium creamy mouthfeel with a faint citrus in the finish. Par for the style. It's at least priced right, a good session beer that I could easily crush all night long."
"Overall-This beer has a cult following, I'm not that sure why. Didn't really enjoy it and I don't even think it's better than BMC."
"No frills but not bad for a cheap-o lager. As iconic as the beer is, it's tough to see the price go up as the cult following emerges after this classic. Better than BMC, but still not a great choice at the fridge."
"D: When push comes to shove and I am short on a dime I will drink PBR first, foremost, and only. Like many others, good times over the years have been had with PBR. I plan to have a lot of great beers at my wedding and an ice chest of PBR will be there as well. It is a steal for the price and there is no reason to even consider drinking any of the other macros."
"D: This is the quintessential ""punk rock"" beer. Also the quintessential ""hipster"" beer. Also the quintessential ""get drunk with your dad and shoot beer cans in the woods"" beer. There's a reason for that: because it's really easy to drink a lot of it, and it doesn't cost much to get a lot of it to drink. It tastes good enough to just pound one after another without giving it much thought. That said, its superior drinkability is what makes it the venerable institution that it is."
"Pretty boring taste although very smooth and easy going down. Not too many hops, most beer lovers I think would not love this beer but it is better than other more common lagers."
"A classic beer for drunken college parties and nostalgic reunions. Great for shotgunning and beer bonging. Not so good for sipping."
"Golfing last week the beer lady pulls up to our foursome. I ask her what she has - all the typical stuff is listed - MGD, Miller Lite, Bud Light, Coors Light, etc. As almost an afterthought she mentions PBR. How strange to be actually delighted over buying a macrobrew. Any how, this is one of the few macros I can drink in large quantities. The beer actually has flavor - there is a decent maltiness to it and a crispness not found in the usual suspects. This was my fathers favorite beer growing up and now I know why. Now if I could just get their horrible marketing slogan from many years ago out of my head ... ""PBR-me-ASAP"""
"Easy to drink. Not bad for a cheap macro. Very easy to drink a bunch of these"
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of light biscuty malt with a hint of corn. The taste is like the aroma. It is mild, pleasant, nothing complex, but likable. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice macro lager. I still think I prefer Grain Belt Premium over PBR, but I could still drink one."
"D: Great session beer for the draft. I would definately drink this again, especially at $1.25 a draft all day every day."
"This beer was an average american macro lager. The taste beats a Bud because it is not overly sweet. It does have a slight metallic taste to it that really shows up in the aftertaste. I would not have a problem drinking these when I am performing outdoor activites."
"Overall, this is just a beer for the masses to get drunk off of. I easily prefer this to any other macro and I don't know why I didn't see more of this in college."
"taste, well what it isn't is as important as what it is, especially when you want a beer you can buy cheap by the case and use in just about any situation without getting sick of it. it's not corny (e.g. old mil), not too sour (e.g. bud can be), not crazy carbonated (e.g. a lot of them). the finish is crisp and short, and the aftertaste and afterburp are neutral, barleylike, and oh so slightly bitter. pretty nice really."
"It's not undrinkable, and can be fairly clean and refreshing when ice cold."
"Drinkability here is also very good. I've bought several 6'ers of this since, and I'll continue to use this as a go to for those situations where I just want a cold one without having to think about it. Don't write this off as your old mans swill, this is alot better than most will ever give it credit for."
"D- This is, in my opinion, one of the better macros. I will drink this again."
"Look and enjoy before you take that first taste of the old favorite PBR!"
"Went to my friend's place to help him move in and when we were done, he hands me a can of PBR... never seen it, never heard of it. Poured a transparent straw yellow with a bubbly 2"" white head that didn't die immediately. Cool. Smelled of corn, some amber malts, and a tiny dab of hops. Cooked veggies and sulfur? Hmm... I took a small sip. Eh, why does this taste like a Blue Light or a Coors Light to me? I didn't particularly enjoy the rest of it but it definitely does the job quenching your thirst. Heck, with a cheap 30 pack maybe it'll be some good pong beer."
"D. This is average drinking here. But compared to most macros, this is exceptional. Selected America's Best in 1893. As far as macros are concerned, it probably still is."
"Drink> For what its worth it is an easy to drink beer. Highly recommended for game-beer when playing Beirut or FlipCup. Also highly recommended that you don't challenge my crew. And if you do, that you wager much tastier beer as the prize, because when we're not downing, we are BA snobs.:)"
"I am of the crew that, for some random reasons, will take a PBR over a Bud, Miller, Coors (and yes, I know it's distributed by Miller, but still). It's unquestionable not good, but for some reason the annoying hipster in me will definitely drink it as a last resort (maybe it's the insanely cheap price tag). It pours a macro piss yellow color with a surprisingly nice head that actually floats on there for a good while. Nose is graininess and light skunkiness, with some sort of bland candy malt. Flavor is...subtle. Not a lot going on, besides that same malt and graininess. No aftertaste whatsoever. Body is fairly thin, but with upbeat carbonation. Overall, as I said, mediocre, but I'd drink 'em in a time of need."
"A cheap beer, but not bad compared to other macros out there. Used to drink alot of these back in ""the day"". Great when they're cold on a hot day or at a family reunion."
"A slightly above average macro lager. Like most of it's brethren it should just be used to wash food down. A go to beer in the style. First baby step towards better beer."
"I thought I reviewed this a long time ago, been testing it along side of other macros. I consider this the best American Macro Lager, they all can be similar and my favorites all are crisp, light and have no off tastes. This has the right carbonation, the head can actually stick around. Mouthfeel is too thin as the style always is but it does have a bit of bitterness and malt. Adjunct, shile there, is not overpowering."
"Very light-bodied and pale. It has a very grainy aroma and taste. Really not much flavor but that was expected. Doesn't go down all that smooth either making it really a beer I'll probably stay away from. It is cheap enough so if you're strapped for cash and want a cheap drunk, be my guest."
"M/D: It feels harsh on the tongue and throughout the mouth. The feel hurts the drinkability and isn't the best refreshment."
"Definitely my macro of choice. Not incredible, but a refreshing summer lager. Can't beat the price, too. When you factor price into drinkability, the score goes up for me. Now I better go check on that chicken..."
"Drinkability & Notes: So, the big question, is this worth going somewhat out of my way to buy PBR in bottles vs. just going to the close by grocer and getting a 12 pack in cans? In my opinion, no, it isn't. From my experience, the real key to PBR tasting its best is freshness, which due to distribution here in Texas, is generally out of cans. That said, the bottled version is excellent as well. I honestly believe that some people (including myself at times), are hung up on that a good beer can't beer served out of a can. Well, this has been proven wrong, and maybe PBR does taste a bit better out of a can."
"paired with aged cheddar, mmm tasty"
"I was surprised after drinking this beer...I have heard about it for a while, but I thought its popularity was primarily in the west and in the north...I discovered that a local convenience store carried this so I tried it...I think that this beer is much better than Coors, and all the other Macros because of its price, and thats it..."
"Bottle smell is corny and sweet but more sweet than corny. Pours to a light yellow color with a macro bubble foamy head and lots of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass like a TV beer. Taste is lightly bitter throughout with a sweetness in the middle and finish. Also finishes slightly dry. Mouthfeel is great not overly carbonated but a little chewy. Not bad for a 164 year old brew. Still a classic. I think the last time I had one was almost 30 years ago. For its style flavorful and extremely drinkable."
"When making judgments regarding PBR, it all comes down to comparison group. As a cheap, American-style lager the most direct comparisons are to Budweiser, Miller, and Coors, and PBR is a clear choice over the numerous variations of these big 3. When drinking this beer, one can actually taste a hint of hops, something that is lacking in the more watery big 3 beers. Although not a fine beer by any means, it is a good, simple beer to enjoy at parties or on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability: For 14 bucks a 30 pack I'll drink this like water and with my kraut heritage and the non-profit factor this is officially my party beer, along with a good intro craft brew of course. 1893, I'm with you, though I have to wonder is this the same beer probably not. So what. True story my tee-totaling ancestor, great grandfather or something, on his deathbed was asked what he could possibly want and he said give me a Pabst!!! It's true, Prost!"
"If you want a crappy American beer, choose Busch."
"I've had everything from St Bernardus Abt 12 to Victory Prima Pils, German, English, Belguim and even Norweigian. Thrilling to find a cheap enjoyable drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is moderate. Low alcohol makes this beer easily sessionable. Flavor is not the best, but better than plenty of macro brews. It's manageable."
"As an alternative to a big, expressive beer PBR is a much better choice IMO than any of the other macros out there."
"I think this has to be my favorite American macro. Has a pretty good full taste. For the price, this is worth every penny. What, $16 (+ .10cent dep./per can for me) for a 'dirty thirty'? Hard to beat for this. I try and keep my fridge stocked with this as my 'week' beer to save money. This is well worth a try, and if you like, your wallet will like better!"
"A good fallback that I order frequently at the wooden nickel in Marquette MI. This beer pours a golden straw color with a two finger head that quickly disappears. Tastes a little less watered down than your average American macro. I'll take this over Bud or Miller any day."
"It's not going to win any RB awards anytime soon but, dollar-for-dollar, it stacks up pretty favorably to its immediate competition (aka American macros and other pale lagers). Aroma is weak, but slightly sweet and grainy. Flavor is very smooth and dominated with sweet malt flavor. Nothing too strong or complex but is far superior to the Bud, Coors, etc. products out there. If you can't afford the good stuff, you could certainly do worse than PBR."
"D - It doesn't get much better than this when it comes to macros. It's not a particularly engaging beer, but it's a solid, simple brew proving that a macro lager can also be a great beer."
"This is a good beer for what it is. This isn't a RIS or a barleywine. it isn't supposed to overwhelm you with flavors. This is a good ol' American macro lager, great for mowing the lawn or watching a ball game. It's better than its competition by far."
"I now this sounds borderline, well, assinine, but, it really reminds me a a New Glaurus lager I just had yesterday, called Totally Naked. I'm impressed."
"Taste is a bit grainy and lightly sweet, slightly creamy and citric in nature. Best served well chilled yet in a glass. Most macros I prefer direct from the bottle/can. Feel benefits from a supportive carbonation level, but is by no means 'fizzy'."
"UPDATE: I do still love PBR, but I found something out about it that makes it even better! As the economy has tanked and beer prices have skyrocketed, I experimented with mixing some of my favorite beers with cheaper beers to make it go further. I know that sounds pathetic, but hear me out. PBR is the PERFECT mixer. I have tried almost every cheap beer to use as a mixer and they ALL detract from the flavor - EXCEPT for PBR. I even hesitate to mention this because this information is worth a lot of money in my opinion. I am serious. As I write this, I am having a Sierra Nevada Flipside Rde IPA mixed 1:1 with a PBR and it is delicious! I do this with Dogfish Head, Great Lakes, Sierra Nevada, and many other IPA's, Pale Ale's, etc. It is an AWESOME discovery!"
"Drinkablity - Pabst is nothing if not drinkable - I reviewed this side by side with schlitz which is slightly better in quality but if your looking for quality your not going to drink either of these - if you are looking for a nice picnic beer to slam ice cold out of a can and still know your drinking beer - I think this will do."
"drinkability: extremely drinkable, this stuff is slam-able. It's the kind of beer that you can sit around and appreciate or more commonly forget and about and drink whilst watching football or enjoying the company of friends."
"Extremely affordable, drinkable classic American beer. I love the packaging, the old-school feel of it. It's like smoking Prince Albert in a corncob (which I do). Aside from the Bud/Miller/Coors triumverate, this is I think the best of the ""cheap"" section. Does have a slightly ""fluffy,"creamy mouthfeel, as has been mentioned, and relatively light carbonation, which is a plus to me. Does NOT have the creeping nasty aftertaste that Bud and Coors tend to have. Taken altogether, I really like this stuff, and hope it never goes away."
"Easy drinker. There's nothing about this beer that I can criticize to a strong degree. It does the style well. I do think it sits a bit heavier with me than others, so maybe not the easiest drinker around. I think I'd rather take Labatt Blue or Schlitz if I've got to have a macro. Still pretty decent stuff though."
"D: PBR is a highly drinkable macro lager--it's flavors aren't offensive and it's rather refreshing. The only reason I gave it a formal review is that it's relatively hard to find in Alabama."
"D - I was in my sunroom on a hot summer night (72 degrees) and boy did this 16oz pour go down nice. I was afraid to let it get warm, but for these instances, that's not a hard task. Overall I recommend this as a good cheap summer session!"
"Perfect for tailgating, large get-togethers, or having a nice beer after a long day of yard work. Whatever the occassion, PBR doesn't fail to deliver the basic incentives of beer drinking."
"A magnificent diet beer with an oldschool attitude. It's way above my drinkable threshold (when adequately cooled), but earnestly tasty. I could pop back 2 or 3 in the bat of an eye and think little of it. I like it."
"Pours a clear, golden/yellowy color, slightly darker towards the edges, with a foamy white head which doesn't last too long and leaves some thin lacing behind. It's got that grainy/generic beery smell, but there's a bit of something else going on...maybe a touch of lemon. Nice, crisp taste, a little hop bitterness detected, grainy, sweet aftertaste. It's got a good mouthfeel, not too watery at all. A real easy drinker, especially in the warmer weather. I also got this out of my grandfather's beer/cigar fridge, which makes the whole thing that much more enjoyable!"
"The appearance is pale, the smell is of sweet corn and perhaps a hop or two, but the taste is classic. I didn't drink PBR for years, but since I tried it for the first time, it has become my regular. I love a good micro-brew, but PBR has a permanent spot in my fridge. Whether cooking out or just finished mowing the yard, PBR is a welcome sight."
"Easy to drink, but so is water. I guess with macro lagers, the less taste you get is best... if my memory serves me right Bud and Miller have some VERY FOUL flavors in there, which this beer doesn't. Nothing offensive to slow you down, and I can see where folks going after a cheap buzz might like it. Especially those who don't like the taste of beer. Me... I'll stick with something with a lot more flavor."
"I have on a PABST kick no for several weeks and its hard to get off of it. I must say for having more the 50 different selection to choose from I go for a PABST first."
"Drinkability is pretty spot on and for $7.99 a 12-pack PBR is really a great deal if you're in the mood to pound a few down with steak and potatoes."
"My go to beer (since Schlitz came and went again) for when you just need a beer. Something light and refreshing."
"I drink PBR often, but didnt think to review it til now. This is one of my go-to brews when I can find it!"
"PBR is a very inexpensive beer. Yet for the price, it is the best of its class. A cheap drinkable beer. The lightness of a PBR is its downfall. They tend to go down like water for the first few. There is the tiniest hint of hops that linger around after a swallow. The texture left in the mouth is very dry. With no flavor too strong, PBR is a nicely balanced average beer. Its a wonderful drink for someone not looking to spend too much money on a night of drinking."
"Think I'll pass on this one in the future unless it's on draft and it's the best choice at the place I find myself (it's happened before...)"
"This is a highly under rated beer who has set itself apart from Budweiser. This is getting back to the beer our fathers generation was drinking. Not as good as the micros, but as for a mass produced nationwide seller, not a bad beer for the price and something to knock back after the yard work."
"Clear, light, yellowy gold, with a fairly creamy lid of froth. Light smells of fruit, pale, and toasted grains. Light-medium body with a lightly creamy-fuzzy carb. Flavors of light, light, light fruitiness with light pale and toasted grains and some light earthy spicy hops. It will get the job done and it has some flavor to it."
"On-tap at the Alex P. Keaton in London, Ontario. Pitcher for $10 (great for Ontario...). Yellow, clear. No head. Ew. Terrifying. Nose is spice and bread. Noble hop fest. Palate isn't half bad. Well balanced between sweetness and spice. Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy but all in all rather inoffensive macro."
"T/M/D: Light grains, with a bit of a sweet edge. Some corn husk, a little splash of citrus on the finish. Light, refreshing, and quite a clean flavour. Body is fairly typical for the style... lighter, and easy going. A nice summer brew. Shame I've ignored this for so long... while I drop into the summertime 'lighter beer' phase, I think this will be a good, simple standby to have in the fridge."
"Pours up a pale gold straw pilsner color with a decent-sized pure white head. Some aromas of pale malt with a tinge of huskiness. Subdued hops make a short-lived cameo in the aroma, as well. Somewhat decent flavor, a touch of grainy sweetness with a light bitterness rounding it out near the finish. Rather watery all-around, but expected. Not particularly big on mouthfeel, but on-target for the style, carbonation seems just about right. I could see how my father liked to keep this beer in the ""extra"" fridge in the basement. A nice, simple beer for chasing away the accumulated stress of the workday."
"MF&D - Light, crisp and easy to drink. Not a craft beer by far, but than again nobody ever said it was. A good summer pounder, just watch out for the headache it tends to provide you with. One of the better macros out there."
"D - This is my favorite macro and is a very versatile beer. You can serve it very cold to quench your thirst when working in the yard or on cars. OR it can be served slightly warmer and more hop and grain tastes comes through. This is a great beer when you just feel like having something simple and tasty."
"Plenty of carbonation but not overpowering. Nothing astounding, but not bad at all."
" -ummm... it's drinkable but it has a weird taste. but goes down fast. Seems to taste better REALLY cold, like almost freezing"
"Would buy this again, especially for the price ($10 for a case)"
"Drinkability is Not good not bad either I'll go with average"
"d - a great session beer, or something to drink when you want a simple beer. The best of the macros."
" as mass produced canned lager goes, PBR is still one of the best of a bad bunch. it won't make you do backflips for joy at the wonder of it, but it's a good cheap drinkable cookout beer."
"Can't ask for anything more than it is. Beats BIG THREE and will always be my favorite beer."
"drinkability is good. this is a solid macro, with clean flavors, and character despite its thinness. one of the better macro lagers out there. cheers!"
"Like I said. This is the beer your grandfather drank. There were no fancy imports, microbreweries, brew pubs, etc. After a hard days work he went for an honest beer. He went for a PBR."
"Notes. I get a case of PBR 1 a month from my neighbor for mowing his lawn.Very much appreciated also my ""weiser"" drinking friends like it when they stop by to BS."
"D-Hands down favorite macro. There is nothing impressive about this beer, but it's just plain decent, and delivers a solid,simple taste that sates the palate when you don't want anything complicated."
"This is hands down my favourite buck a beer and favourite macro for sure. No there may not be much taste, but it doesn't taste awful, this is a very thirst quenching, get wasted beer with no hangover included. It pours a nice clear yellow with a nice head that leads into perfect lacing. Exceptionally drinkable."
"Great cheap beer to supply the masses."
"Not a bad macro lager and a good deal at $30 a keg. This is a good one to drink if you don't want to experience much. It is golden yellow with a tan head. Not much of a smell. Some bad hops. The taste is very neutral. Not as bad a most of this style. Feel is very light with ample carbonation. No bad off flavors, but not much flavor at all either."
"PBR or DIE!!!"
"It is what it is. It is not made by Trappist Monks in a remote Belgian monastery. It is not made by an eccentric Quebecois obsessed with tradition. It isn't even made by some rabidly insane American beer fanatic. It is the quintessential cheap American beer, unusual only in that it has not been changed for a century or more and the company doesn't attempt to convince you that drinking its product will cause scantily clad women to materialize randomly and start having sex with you. For what it is, it's pretty good."
"D - Oh yeah, no worries here, you could drink it until the blood vessels rupture in your brain, or at least until your liver fails. After the first two you don't taste anything anyways, that's why this is one of the ultimate college kid swill choices, and for good reason."
"D- People on here seem to rip the style very much because it's so mass produced and has been so overdone in our society. That said, this beer is good for a warm day or just if you simply want a basic beer. As far as lagers go, PBR and Yuengling are good choices."
"Ah yes, good old dollar-a-can PBRs. The cheapest beer you can find in a bar. I didn't bother pouring this one into anything just chugged it from the can. Tastes like any other mass produced lager. Drink it with your buddies and don't forget to tip your bartender for having to get you so many!"
"Drinkablity: Solidly drinkable American brew. Drinking one of these is a comforting as entering the city limits of your hometown after being gone for years."
"Poured into a pint glass. Very pale straw color with a regular size head. The carbonation is adequate for the style. There is a touch of hops in the aroma, along with that mixture of malt and corn. The crispness of the hops and is present in every sip, something not really execpted from a macro lager. The body is thin and there is an drying aftertaste that builds up after a couple. But if I'm drinking macros this and Shlitz are probably the two I'm drinking first."
"I've read some of the reviews and couldn't agree more with most of them. I started out drinking PBR because it was the only beer I could afford while paying an older person to buy it for me (what don't look at me like that, we all did it). I went back to PBR a few weeks ago after a four year long sabatical. I have to say, it's the most drinkable macro(cheap beer) that I've ever drank. and yes, it's better drank through a beer-bong. ""tastes so good, when it touches your lips it's so good.""-Frank"
"Overall, its a drinkable beer and good for the price!"
"I found this beer to be quite sweet. I popped open my first can and was surprised to find that I really like this beer. It wouldn't be my first choice to drink, but if the money isn't in my pocket to buy a nice Belgium, I would purchase this. What year did they win the Blue Ribbon? 1884? This is a good BBQ beer with the boys."
"This is an above-average macro lager. It smells faintly of corn and grain husk. The corn flavors are stronger on the palate with hints of pale malt and hops, but the corn is not as overpowering as Miller High Life. It goes down fairly easy and everybody seems to find it at least palatable. This is the one to get when the going is cheap."
"I won't go wholesale into PBR but if I'm at this bar again there are worse choices to be made. Much better than the last bud product I had!"
"A perfect change up when things get a bit tedious and want to drink a simple beer, (well put)."
"great go-to-beer."
"Drinkability is a perfect 5 as the low ABV and more than decent taste means you and your buddies can smash a bunch of these and have a good time."
"D: Far more flavorable than many macro lagners with a light body adn low ABV it would easily outlast a long session."
"Decent Macro with good drinkability. Tastes great with Cornbread. Mellow flavor that doesn't dominate the food you are eating."
"PBR is truly an American original. Great beer at a great price!"
"Drank my first beer out of a Dodger Blue pint glass that I had my girlfriend steal in her purse from the nearby bar, ""The Roadhouse"". Pours like any other Mac Lag, golden yellow body with a fat frothy white head that disapates within a matter of 15 seconds, settles then sparkles with a multitude of champengesk bubbles. Does not possess the smell of a stale tin car like other Macs, a tad yeasty and sweet like sweet grain bread. Mild malty taste, maybe a little sourdough bread, white corn, sunflower seeds, nothing overwhelming just hints of these flavors. Mouthfeel is great, smooth, mild aftertaste, does not have the pasty roof of your mouthfeel like other shitty macros. Suprisingly the warmer it gets the easier it is the drink, i'm not suggesting you let it sit under your bed for a week, but you can take your time drinkin' a sixy. Thank god for a cheap non shitty tasting beer for beer lovers that fell on hard times!"
"D: Depends on the situation, if your going out to camp or hitting up a college party PBR is my choice over any Mass produced, might be the cultish thing but, it does the job I suppose. If your a poor college kid. get a 24 oz Sam Adams and some PBR and your set eh?"
"Why do some establishments chill the hell out of their mugs? That's what I was thinking when I received my 25oz sample at an ice cold temperature. It's still decent ice cold, but it tastes better at merely cold (it took time for my sample to warm up), as the corn and hop flavors loosen up. Simple and refreshing beer without any astringent flavors."
"Drinkability was decent. Easy to pound down, but nothing I would relish having."
"Overall this lager's dryness and texture really sets it apart from most macros I've tasted. No funky flavors, just a nice tame character that's easy and breezy. A good non-thinking beer."
"Try it."
"Pours clear straw with sudsy white head which fades to a thin layer in seconds, spotty lacing. Smell: sweet grain, slight corn and grainy/grassy hops. Taste: lightly grainy, thin malt with a touch of hops. Ever so slight touch of alcohol. Medium carbonation. Fairly clean for a macro lager, although the cereal grains (and corn syrup?) really hit in the finish if it warms. Still one of the better American macro lagers around."
"M/D - Very good for a cheaper beer."
"Anyway, back to the beer. PBR is just as good as BMC. Plus its inexpensive. Long live PBR! We live in a great age. You can buy a lot of beer for little money! Forget buying a case for $40, you can get a 30 pack for $12. We can make it up in volume!."
"D-Definately drinkable, goes down easy and stays there."
"That last part was a joke for those of you who can't read sarcasim."
"In ""Repo Man", Otto looks wistfully at The Circle Jerks, now reduced to lounge singers in gold lame outfits, shakes his head and says, ""And to think, I used to like those guys."" And to think, I used to drink PBR on Wednesday nights at the Sub Cafe in New London, Connecticut like it was going out of style."
" PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!"
"mouthfeel: could drink it forever. smooth as a lake in the morning. not a trace of stickiness."
"Yes, I believe Pabst to be the best of the cheapo beers. It is always welcome in my fridge when the money is tight!"
"Smell was sweet, malty, and of rice or corn. Taste was similar flavors, lightly sweet, with a touch of a drying finish. Not the worst cheap beer I've had by far, but sort of left me with a trademarked budweisery headache, but I'm not sure if it was from this beer or a previous one or few.."
"From a 16 oz, tall boy can. As far as appearance, the can is a lovely design with a quip about being named America's beer of 1874 or something similar. I was unable to acquire much smell from the can. However, taste was excellent!!! for a macro lager, and I was really quite surprised. This went down wonderfully and was the best sixteen ounces of macro beer I've ever quaffed. There's no detectable hop (as per style), but a pleasant malt flavor and smooth finish. With these going for a measly two bucks at Underground Bluz, it's one I'll certainly repeat in the future."
"let me say that if you're drinkin alot of MGD, Bud, or Budlt...you could be wasting your money. At 3.99 a six this classic AMerican MAssPro lager more than holds its' own. Pours a straw hue with a 1/4"" inch head that dissapates rather quickly. Smell is sweet with a hint of alcohol. Taste is much the same. THis beer tastes like a masspro but there's not really any serious gripes here. Not too bitter. I can get a little hops in there...barely... the grains and the sweetness from them kinda remind me of a higher ranked german dort style but only more subdued. A nice earthyness between the corn-sweet and alcohol finish. Decent balance and some good qualities here... Quite crisp and drinkable, however, this beer is like HighLife in that it has to be cold and in the bottles to really be enjoyed. Less distinctive than some but still tastes fine. The alcohol here may be 4.7 but this seems to me to feel and taste like a 5.5 or so lager....if it wasn't for the watery mouthfeel I'd insist it was stronger...but I guess they have no reason to lie. Finishes a dry sweet. I think this beer tastes as good as ANY masspro lager on the shelf...save the money. Think generic Lowenbrau Light."
"Drinkability: This could be drinkable if it was less funny tasting, but it's not very drinkable even for a macro lager, becuase it tastes funny."
" Although many people may look down on American macros in general, Pabst Blue Ribbon is a hidden gem of American brewing. Like I said earlier, PBR is my party beer; its cheap and drinkable. Regardless of my favorable opinion, it is not one that I would recommend for anything other than parties and budget-constraints."
"D - I love this beer. This is my party beer of them all. Almost 5 % and only 11.00 a 30 pack."
"Aroma is a faintly sweet, untoasted grain with a faint hop scent. Flavor is more of the same. Good balance for a macro. Mouth feel is effervescent and light, plenty of carbonation. Did a great job of washing down some chips and salsa. Overall, my favorite macro and probably the only one I will bother to review."
"Pretty tasty for what it is. I would certainly pick this over others if macros were my only option."
"Overall: One of my favorite inexpensive beers. During the school semester when money is a little tight I usually opt for this beer for its decent flavor and high drinkability. My family has been religiously drinking it since we can remember. The best among American Lagers... hands down."
"Can says brewed in Milwaulkie, WI. Is this now brewed by Miller? Very close to Miller High Life in flavor profile."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Drinkability? I'll reiterate. This will get you drunk. It's your standard American Macro Lager, and it just doesn't taste very good."
"D- I can easily clean off a six pack of this. I probably wouldnt buy it more than 2 times a year but its relatively smooth and a good beer to have when you want to put away a few."
"The taste is also quit remarkable for a macro. A slight sweet malt and hoppiness on the finish. But unfortunately this all is spoiled by a corn aftertaste. It is light bodied and carbonation isn't out of control. Goes down easily. I think this is a nicely done macro. Between PBR and Grain Belt I might have to go with PBR because of the slightly lower cost if I had to choose."
"The drinkability gets an average since this is what it is: a decent tasting, inexpensive lager. With one of the longer histories of a U.S. Lager, it is neat to drink the beer that your great grand dad probably had a few times."
"Smells of grains with a touch of hops. Tastes of grains, then sweetness fades to a slightly hoppy and brief yet sweet finish. Mouthfeel thin, and finishes fairly crisp. IMO, this is one of the better mainstream macros out there. I am not embarrassed to drink these on occasion."
"And as with most macros, the drinkability is top notch. Had a good amount of these last night and could have had more."
"up on a budget, you get a suitcase of this stuff."
"I can honestly say that this is the best Light American Lager out there. Absolutely nothing offensive in the taste. Excellent mouthfeel. I could drink it all day long (and do). I'll tell you what, if someone gives me the choice between a heinekin or a PBR, I'm reachin' for the tall boy."
"Notes: Not a bad little macro lager. It's cheap, inoffensive and fairly drinkable, though not something I'd ever seek out. Still, it has more flavor than most."
"D- Wow I was expecting this to be a punishment to my taste buds but it was actually refreshing. The smooth light flavor had some nice balance and some interesting notes to it. I would order this in a bar if they didn't have any better beer, as opposed to just going for the gin."
"Drinkability - You can drink this all through the best/worst barbecue"
"What can I say? I used to get these for a buck at my old job (the pint cans), so I never bothered to look or smell it (hence the halfway grade of 2.5). There's an actual smooth beer in that can, w/ just a perfect mix of all cheap American macro lager ingredients other than alcohol and water - the grains, hops, hint of barley. For its price range and quality compared to its peers, it is a quality beer and will bring back some memories of days that have passed."
"Drinkability - Refreshing and light, no specifically unpleasant tastes, simply a bit weak and simple to be highly recommended. Great with pizza."
"The bottom line is that this is yet another macro beer. It has hipster cred for some reason that is completely beyond me, and I only drink it when even local micros or Sam aren't available, but it at least has the virtue of being cheap. The beer has some character, and is easily my favourite beer in its style, so I have to mark it up some for that."
"drinkablity:I guess I can drink this for a dollar at my local hipster bar...and look at hot chicks...but otherwise...ehhh...give me a good pilsner"
"Pours a nice light yellow color with a nice white head. The beer smells of a little bit of light malt. The taste is about the same with some light malt tones and some underlying light hoppiness. The aftertaste isn't bad, but it's very light. This beer is alot like the other American Macro Brews, light on the taste, light on the aftertaste, but a nice carbonation makes it a drinkable beer. Also good price for this beer because it is not worth much more than that. At least they got the price right and for that it is better than Budweiser in my opinion."
"Im not even going to bother to write full on review about this beer. basically what it is to me is a respite from bud and miller...and worse. its not a ""great"" beer, but when i want to imbibe beer for the sake of just enjoying a beer, and not necc the drink itself pbr is #1 over the others."
"D: A great example of a macro lager, my favourite of the style so far, much better and tastier than BMC."
"When my friend gave this to me so I could review it. I was expecting to bash it later when reviewing time comes. Well the time has come and I'm surprised. Has a straw color with a white head pretty average. Smell was of malt typical macro. I was surprised with the taste for a cheap beer its fairly good. The mouthfeel isn't bad theres a lot a carbonation in this beer. If I was out BBQing or camping this beer could make an appearance."
"Gets you drunk and doesn't cost much. Can't believe what the can says ""Selected as America's best in 1893."" That timeframe was the golden age of brewing in America. All the immigrants were bringing their different recipes from all over the world. There were more breweries then in the US than now. That was pre-Prohibition before the giant macro-brewers began global domination. As far as macro lagers go, this is probably my favorite after Schlitz. Actually has some taste. Extremely drinkable. A nostalgic choice for my brother and I, as we used to drink this because our dad drank this."
"Much more flavor than other macros of it's kind. Goes down easy when cold and is pretty inexpensive. Not a lot of hop presence but, does taste like beer."
"d: easy I guess"
"D: When cold, very easy to drink many of these. I have had some batches that have seemed slightly off and the adjuct corn flavor is more apparent, but by no means as much as Miller brand products. Overall, keep it cold, and you have an above average, ""average beer," at a great price. A better product and value than the rest of the mass produced swill."
"Overall: I fail to understand the cult fascination with this brew. Its a merely acceptable macro. Not recommended."
"Could drink more than one of these for sure"
"I'd certainly fish it out of a bucket before I'd touch Natural Light, which I suppose can be considered praise."
"Poured 12 oz. bottle into a tall straight-sided pilsner glass. The bottle has no date. Clear, pale yellow with 1/2"" bubbly white head that dissipates relatively slowly while drinking, leaving no lace. Light malt with wet cardboard aroma. Crisp, light acidic initial flavor that transitions into a light bitter aftertaste that is short lived. Surprisingly not bad & relatively refreshing. It had a slightly funny off flavor as it warmed. Light bodied with dry texture and relatively active carbonation. I don't drink this style very often, but I found the PBR to be a decent summer beer that pairs well with a sandwich or burger and chips. Probably makes a good session beer and is not nearly as terrible as some beer snobs would have you believe."
"As said before, this is the old standby. Better than the macro brews done by the same company (miller), this is the perfect pre-pay day beer. I enjoyed it in the military, in college, and now during baseball games. This is your average beer for your average guy. I still like it, keeps me true to my roots. Doesn't look like much, nothing outstanding about it, it's just beer, plain and simple."
"Another macro beer whose best feature is it's low price.It does go down smooth when ice cold and it's taste is pretty decent. If you are looking for a cheap beer for a hot day or just bumming around this is a good choice.I will buy again and would recommend for those who enjoy macros."
"Just found a place around here that serves PBR on tap can't wait to try it draft!"
"Would not purchase, but will drink it if its free."
"Folk's this is not to bad at all. some of you may think I'm crazy but it tastes like a Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold that has been toned down and cheapend a bit. All in all this is a great cheap beer. Much better than the big three."
"Considering its place in the world of beer, PBR ain't that bad. It is my favorite of the cheap macros. Much rather drink this than Busch, High Life, or god-forbid Milwaukee's Best. Its a little sweeter than the others which helps its drinkability for me. Helps overcome some of the inherent nastiness of this style of beer. Prefer to get it in the bottles, which I cannot do here in Georgia but Tennessee is just a few miles away. If you need beer on the cheap on a hot summer day, you can do a lot worse than PBR."
"Overall this is a decent beer for the money,it seems to get either way too much praise or gets relentlessly slammed, the truth lays somewhere in the middle. This beer is meant for drinking, it's very drinkable."
"Fizzy, overcarbonated, smells like creamed corn. Taste is corny but with a sweet finish that makes it pretty easy to drink. Some graininess, moderately refreshing. Pretty crisp. I doubt anything more has to be said about this ubiquitous beer, it's good for a macro but that's it."
"Notes: It all comes down to price here... and for the price, this one is pretty damn good. It's a bit more than 50 cents per can at my local grocery store, and it's worth every penny. Perfect on gamedays before going into the stadium, I would take PBR over Bud, Miller, Coors, Schlitz, Milwaukee's Best, etc. etc. etc. any day. The Best of the Bad, PBR still reigns after all these years."
"Poured from a can. Light yellow color with a nice bit of foam that fades. Aroma is sweet and grainy, not far from a macro lager. Taste is inoffensive with some bitterness. Good malt taste on tongue. Definitely tastes better than the last time I had it. Not too bad."
"Drank this from a 12 oz. can, poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear, pale yellow with a foamy white head that dissipates almost immediately. Can barely smell anything. Taste begins alright, centers around the malt, but then it drops out altogether. No aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a tad fizzy, but not much else. Easily drinkable, not altogether bad, but there's just nothing much to it."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, refreshing"
"Pours a pale yellow with a highly carbonated white head. In the nose is European hops and slightly skunky. It tastes of a smooth sweetness and a small bitter end. Smooth, dry end, and no aftertaste. I think it might be the hoppiest of the big 5. Refreshing and I alway sing in my head every time I drink this ""The beer that made Milwaukee famous, made a fool out of me!"""
"I have often wondered what the original formula tasted like when it was actually brewed in Milwaukee, not San Antonio...Can anyone provide me with this information?"
"Heads and shoulders above the big 3 macros. A fine brew for an afternoon thirst and goes along with most foods just fine. Excellent at 8am with a re-heated mesquite grilled steak leftover from the night before."
"Notes : where i buy this beer there's sign of Pabst that says ""Viva la Beer"" that makes me think ""isn't this the most patriotic beer?"" , i don't think the sign was a good marketing strategy."
"Drinkability is so so. I am not against the idea of Macro Lagers, some I don't mind drinking. This is one that I would probably pass on again. Not as clean and refreshing as some of the others in the style."
"In conclusion, these beers have their place in our world. God bless them, every one."
"Pour this? Why the hell would you? It's an American classic, that has very little flavor...a tiny hop ""bite"" in the finish...and is, in my opinion, very smooth and poundable. Now like $16/30pk, and was only $10 the last time I bought it...again, 6 years ago. Why the hell are they raising the price of this?! Anyway, I'd recommend it for a cheaper than B, M, C, etc...spacer brew. Not bad. I remember seeing empties of these around the house from my dad when I was little! Brings back memories of the old man. He drank anything cheap...but AMERICAN! I'd go back to this again, and sooner than 6 years....but I can see that I really didn't miss alot in those 6 years of not having PBR! Don't be too hard on it, though. Remember what it is...and that it DID win a blue ribbon...like over a hundred years ago....but it MUST be the same recipe, right?! Have a PBR if you're into the macro lagers and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Ciao for now my beer-drinking, alcoholic friends!! Cheers!"
"Terrible. Absolutely terrible. The only fans I know of this beer like it because its such a joke. The flavour has a faint maltiness that's mostly not present and no lace. It's mouthfeel is less viscous than water, the over-carbonation stings the tongue, and the skunkiness is UNREAL. It was a cross between rancid gone-off cocktail olives and the aftertaste of oral surgery. I found a sort of bitter aftertaste that left me far thirstier than a beer should. This beer has only served any purpose after many rounds of scotch and Guinness Extra Cold when one is still thirsty but broke, going at $3 a pitcher. Fans of craft beers, even American macro should stay away."
"Taste is a bit more fruitful, not literally, with a more friendly malt seeping through."
"Mouthfeel was thin to medium in body with high carbonation. Appropriate to style and non-offensive."
"This is liquid Fritos. Even the aftertaste reminds me of the Frito aftertaste. I like it. Better than the big three. I still favor Schlitz far more over this brew, but this is still a good choice if looking for a hot summer day cheap throw back beer."
"This brew was the laughingstock at my graduate school department. I avoided it as long as I could but alas, I did eventually try it. It was rank right out of the bottle, and thankfully it had a more yellowish tinge than some other brews...and that's a very minor thankfully. There is no discernable smell to speak of nor is there any discernable taste. The mouthfeel is very watery with hints of carbonation. Overall this is not a beer that I would try again, nor is it a beer that I would recommend to others."
"PBR = probably the best macro lager out there. Pour is a golden, carbonated, average appearance. White head of a decent size that fades somewhat quickly. Smell is of grain and malts with a bit of hops in there, at least more noticeably so that other macro lagers. Taste is much less watered down and actually contains some decent flavor for what is there. Slightly bitter hops and more grain and malts, somewhat sweet. Mouthfeel is light, refreshing, and because this beer has flavor, it's much more balanced and contains some substance. Drinkability, considering all other aspects of this beer, is good. That's hard to say for most other macro lagers, yet somehow I can't deny this one a 4. Cheap and better than decent. I see why this one still wins its fair share of awards."
"Ok, so I was at Hooters and had to drink something, had never, and I mean that never had a PBR, so what the hell. was actually very impressed. Poured a dull, unremarkable pale golden yellow, lots of carbonation and a white fizzy head that faded immediatly. Smell was non descript and uneventful, nothing really to discuus to here. The taste was actually quite pleasent. Now dont get me wrong, it was not complex and full of flavor, but for the style it was superb. Light corn/grain taste, but mostly fizzy water. Very smooth and well carbonated and easily poundable all night long. I would have to say, hands down thi is the best Macro lager I have ever had, not that that is saying alot, but this was nnot actually that bad with some wings!"
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, its all right for an inexpensive beer but there are certainly much better beers out there even within the style."
"I might just stock up on this myself next time I shop for beer."
"D: Very drinkable and better tasting IMHO than most other macros out there, also considerably cheaper (30 cans for 10.99 as opposed for 13.99 for 24 cans of Bud or Miller) always will be my first choice for cheap macros."
""
"OK...so I'm reviewing PBR. But I must say, its' really good for what it is...a cheap, let's drink a bunch, don't give a care beer. It's like saying ""Airplane"" and ""Gone With the Wind (or whatever oscar winning movie) are both great movies. It's good for what it represents. Onto the review. I poured one from a can (drank the rest of them from the can) and it actually had a really big head. It dissipated rather quickly. Verry yellow golden...typical of this kind of beer. The beer had little aroma but had decent body and taste. Not much of an aftertaste and they can go down rather quickly. Much better than the other mass produced swill that dominates sales. People laugh at it, but this is a classic American brew that is good for what it represents. It's obviously not ""complex", not one of our ""comfort"" beers or the beers we love and brew. But it has it's place as on of the better, if not best, of the cheap brews. Chug em baby."
"Overall, one of the best, if not THE best cheap beer you can buy. Amazingly balanced, it's a very good choice. People will still give you shit, though."
"This was a lager which I wouldn't really enjoy drinking, but on the other hand I wouldn't detest drinking. The smell is neutral an inoffensive. The taste is sweet and malty with strong hints of corn syrup and a touch of earthy hops (probably the only macro lager with hops flavors that I can detect). The mouthfeel is overly too carbonated and sweet. I found myself unable to down larger gulps of this one as it was powerful in my throat and this is not a good thing. I might take PBR over Busch, but certainly not over a decent micro brew."
"Look, we all know that if you want to drink a beer and really have an amazing taste experience, you aren't going to even consider PBR. But if you're outside on a hot day, at a frat party, or you just got home from the steel mill, and you want a cold, chuggable brew that won't make you gag, PBR is the way to go. It's the best cheap-ass, drunk-straight-from-the-can beer in the land, and we should all be proud of it."
"D - I like this! It's a weird old-school throwback that is not really tasty, but it's cheap and much more interesting than Bud Light. In fact, this was cheaper than Bud Light at my grocery store."
"One of the more decent of widely available American macro-lagers; nothing objectionable, but far from impressive. More affordable than BMC too. But not something to even consider getting for enjoyment at home."
"I cold never figure out why PBR is so hot with the hipster crowd. The only reason I got this was the store was out of Hamms, and I wanted to put something in the can holder in the door of my beer fridge for Memorial Day weekend"
"Pours clear with a dirty yellow color and bright white head that fades quickly. Lots of bubbles floating upwards throughout. The nose is very mild, with sweet malts-and-grits notes, a faint herbal tea quality and little else. The palate is quite bland, with a light malt sweetness and a touch of balancing bitterness that grows toward the end. There's a hard, carbonic quality to the beer. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy with carbonation and, as expected, extremely light in body... although not too light by macro standards. Overall, this is pretty bad, and nothing that I would order or drink if I had a reasonable amount of choice in the matter. But it's not terrible by macro standards, and I can see the attraction of it given its cost."
"For what it is this isn't a bad beer at all. Served extra cold this beer is damn refreshing. What can I say about this beer that hasn't been said? It's been a long time since I had a macro and the urge caught me on my way home today. It'll definitely be a while before I buy it again but I wouldn't turn one down if offered. I'm drinking the next one straight from the can for the true experience."
"At the Middle East Bar in Cambridge, MA (aka the home of PBR in Eastern Massachusetts) on 12 ounce bottle. Maybe it's 100% psychological but Pabst is one of those beers that tastes completely different depending on the serving method. Drank out of the bottle so appearance is moot. Little to no smell from the neck of the bottle. Corny sweetness with a Bill Raftery ""the kiss' of weak hops from beginning to end of the bottle. There's a reason that this sells unbelievably well, and it's not just the price. I really do prefer it on bottle to even can or draft. I think the can makes it too cold and while draftwise you are at the mercy of age of keg and cleanness of line when experiencing PBR"
"I still prefer colt to this."
"Drinkability: Probably one of the lightest flavored beers out of the AML group, easy to drink, not much going on."
"A: check"
"It's an easy drinking, affordable beer, best enjoyed outside on a hot day. When the budget is tight and I can't do the craft beers, I'll pick up a 12-pack of this. Worth a try."
"well a friend drinks this and gave me a can because really i am a beer snob and don't drink macros. with that being said, i did find the beer enjoyable in its own way, it had a very clean aroma, little malt, a hint of butter or it could be the cooking as dinner is being made. pours a brilliant golden with a 1 1/2 finger head that leaves lacing down the side of the glass. the flavor is very clean, little malt, some sweetness, little hop spice, has a very balanced bitterness, hint of honey and graininess in the aftertaste."
"overall this is a brew for a hot summer afternoon and for after youve already had a few"
"12oz can poured into a pint glass. Pours a faint straw yellow color with a large with head and lively carbonation rising to the top. Not much going on in the nose except for some grain and some faint hops. The taste is much like the smell in that it is pretty clean and crisp. Not much going on in the smell or taste, but it is one of the better macro lagers. I would take this over the ""Big 3"" any day on both taste and price."
"Cheap and easy."
"D: The taste isn't that great, and the appearance leaves much to be desired. But would I have another? At this price, why not."
"Drinkability: Well, it is what it is. Overall, more flavor than some of the more mainstream macro lagers. On this first warm day in Indiana, it was a great beer while sitting out at a patio restaurant with my family."
"Drinkability: This stuff is super cheap and rather enjoyable. PBR would be a far better value at double the price than Bud, Miller, or Coors would be PBR's price."
"PBR has always been tops on my list for Macros. It might have something to do with growing up in the south, or going to plenty of smaller venue concerts and associating what I was drinking with what I was doing. No matter what it might be, I always come back to the PBR out of respect. You can pair it with almost any down-home food or any gathering, especially grilling and barbecuing."
"Well it poured a pale yellow with a head about 2inches think and fluffy. That quickly dies though. Smell was corn and believe it or not a hint of floral hops in there as well. This was surprising. The taste was very weak. I couldnt find anything more than corn. It was an easy drink since there was really nothing to focus on."
"What is it about this beer. I'm not a dirty hipster and I can afford to drink better. But $1 PBR drafts come along and I can't help myself. It isn't much to look at and the smell is only sweet and grainy. But the taste is smooth with a touch of malt. As it warms the adjunct sweetness is a bit much for me, but for what it is, it aint bad. If they just put a little more hops in here we'd have a really decent beer. Alas."
"I did think Budweiser was the best ""macro", but after not having Pabst since HighSchool, I'll give pabst the nod. Not great looking, yellow and fizzy and smells like a macro(don't need to get into that, we all know that smell). But had some interesting tingles, almost of a fruity grain, nothing offensive, a slight aftertaste, no hops, very graining and not bad. I may reach for this again."
"Drink it cold, drink it fast, and in case you were wondering, this bottle had a two of clubs."
"D: Lets face it, drinkability is where this beer really shines. The weak taste makes it an easy beer to drink on a hot day (especially if a berliner-weiss isnt available), a fairly refreshing brew when chilled, and a great beer for cooking and eating since it doesn't hit the tastebuds hard, if at all. As a macro American brew, it is an example of the style that sits above the others."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkabilty: The beer is thin almost watery. The carbonation is in porportion to the beer and makes it easier to drink. This is a classic lawnmower beer that has just found its way back into my beer mix."
"Pale, light, straw-colored with virtually no head. Shades of carbonation. A sweet, grassy smell and taste. Complexity is the last thing this offers, which leads to a subtle smoothness. Not the most highly pleasant sour aftertaste remains in the mouth, which is a strange blend between that and the carbonation."
"limp puny yellow, you can see the carbonation. meager white head. smell's a little off, and gets worse as the beer warms. not a good testament to the quality of the ingredients. some slight malt smells, yeast, grassy hops, overly ripe corn. tastes like harsh grains, a bit too much sugar, and a slight hop kick (more so than in the other common place macro lagers). drink it cold, drink it fast."
"I would have to give the PBR the slight edge here. Very slight though it might be."
"Not the best beer but passible on my scale. But hey you can't beat a pitcher on draft for four bucks on a friday night."
"The best bang for the buck as far as Marco's go. Drank a lot of these beers in the days. Never turn one of these down. Go PBR! A classic Macro."
"Overall not a bad beer when options are limited."
"Very crisp, carbonated mouthfeel, and incredibly thin. But it is smooth, refreshing, and definitely not filling. This beer doesn't pretend to be anything it's not, and it is damned good considering it's counterparts. Definitely not one of my first choices, but I have yet to find anything that goes quite as well on a 100+ summer day or with a pizza, especially considering the price. That being said, you will rarely find my fridge without at least a 6-pack of PBR."
"D - This has always been my macro of choice."
"Pours a very pale straw color. One of the palest I have seen. Low aroma-sort of just says ""beer"". Rather bland and unimpressive flavor-lacks the crisp ""snap"" that I find in a BUD and others. Very 1 dimensional. Thin and watery body. As I said I love a good macro-theres a place and time for them in my book. I think I would grab a Strohs or Old Milwaukee first."
"Poured a clear straw color, a bit yellow, had a decent whispy white head that dissipated as I poured it and left no lacing. The smell is of corn, grainy, a bit of sulfer. The taste is better, it has a some sweet malt notes to it, not too artficially sweet like other macros. The mouthfeel is watery, nicely carbonated. Another good cooler beer and this doesn't have that ick taste that other macros have which makes it quite drinkable."
"Sometimes you just need to slum a little, and when in Portland, OR this is the way to go. It's pours pretty yellow and normally that scares me, but it sort of works. Not much for a head. The smell and taste are rather standard for an American macro lager, but their not unpleasant. A bit bland and not too much of an aftertaste. It has be be cold though. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but after a couple pints of the good stuff, this can maintain a pretty good buzz for hours. I'm still note sure why a Texan beer is so popular in Portland, what with all the craft breweries there, and it just doesn't drink the same anywhere else for me!"
"I was rather suprised when I had PRb for the first time with an open mind. The fundamental features of it were pretty poor, such as no retention, no head, no lace, no smell. The look was a light coppery color, not that bad looking. The taste was a bit spicy with a hint of malts and hops well blended together. A very solid draft brew. Don't drink and review."
"It pours very nicely into my beer clean glass, with abundant head a very faint yellow color. But that's where my pleasant trip down memory lane ends. Aroma is bad...smells like malted corn, and not in a good way. Flavor is more appealing, with some maltiness and corn taste which is much less potent than the odor. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and I wouldn't call this very drinkable."
"It's a punk rock beer. And it's cooler to order a PBR than a Coors Light. But don't expect to get much more flavor or satisfaction. I can appreciate why people like it, but it seems like a waste of time/money to ever drink this stuff when there is so much better out there. It serves a purpose for the financially struggling college kids and rock wannabes - but I'd rather have one or two good beers than a six-pack of swill."
"This beer is easy to drink and cheap to buy. I like this beer to drink when I'm playing cards with the guys. For taste it is some bitterness but not bad. It has a nice mouthfeel not grainy or anything like that. Smells like beer nothing fancy there. All in all its not that bad of a beer."
"Looks like beer.... smells like beer.... nothing special there. tastes better than any of the big boy beers ""bud, coors, miller, etc."" and is usually cheaper to boot. I would not go around preaching its virtues but a great beer for playing drinking games as it is easy to pound and does not leave me felling like a $2 wh%#& after doing so."
"Quite pale and transparant. Piss yellow. Clear. Thin ivory white head. Lacing is minimal. Nice nose on this beer for the style. Grainy and sweet. That's a given. But also some light bready malts and hay like tones in the background. Crisp and somewhat agressive carbonation. Light to light-medium in body. Sweet, grainy tones hit the palate first. Agreeable maltiness. Not a lot of depth, but a decent macro. And a good enough quencher in the summer."
"Ephemeral head is airy and alabaster in exhibition. The bouquet manifests hygienic with an ethereally nectareous character. Unsubstantially toothsome flavor is non-amalgamated to an acrid and musty sapidity. Mouthfeel is coarse yet gossamery. Speckless terminus initiates further suppings."
"Tried this on tap... not sure why. Beer was a clear yellow golden color with a one finger bubbly head. Smell is slighlty sweet of malt and corn. Beer is initially bitter but finishes with a malty crisp finish. A light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. Drinkable like water, very light."
"I find it easy to drink and that is why it is my cheap, working around the house turning wrenches, just finished cleaning, returned from mountain biking garage and basement beer."
"Drinkability: good"
"Overall, this beer is in the same boat as Budweiser. Very similiar to each other. It is what it is....an American Macro Lager."
"D: refreshing on a hot day...but again,..you pay the price on the porcelin pony the next day!!!"
"pabst is an old stand by. for the price it can't be beat. it ties schlitz for my american macro number one. super smooth. it's definitly way too easy to put a bunch of these boys away. nothing spectactular. but absolutly no off flavors, smooth pure watery american goodness. pbr is where it's at when the money is tight and drinking is in order. great with spicy foods and bbq. always in my fridge for those sundays off."
"I can really appreciate the way this beer tastes. It has very little in the way of hop flavor or any flavor at all for that matter but there is also very little about the tast not to be liked. This washed down the disgusting pizza I was eating very well and the easy-on-the-palate taste makes it an ideal session beverage. If you have to choose between PBR and any other macro. Choose PBR."
"B'ham UK (written while in Florida Nov 2006)"
"My favorite cheap beer, especially after a long day of work. If the ""corny"" aftertaste wasn't there it would be exceptional for the price."
"Pabst Blue Ribbon was pale golgen in color and very clear. It had a thick bubbly white head with decent retention and some spotty lacing. The aroma was sweet and grainy. The taste was about the same with a touch of hops and a dry finish. It had a medium-light body and medium carbonation. Drinkability was average. It's not to bad for a macro lager."
"D: Designed to be consumed in mass quantities, and very appropriate for doing so."
"Not bad for how cheap it is, not bad at all."
"I know what the fuss is about (current hipness of retro-blue collar posturing) but I just don't know what the fuss is about. I've had this one in the 12 oz. can, the 12 oz. bottle, on draught, in a 24 oz. can, and in the 40 oz. I watch people pay three dollars a can for this in an affluent neighborhood bar that has fifteen good taps. I presume they are making their ironic social statement (though the true irony eludes them). Ok, so it's thin bodied , with a weird off-putting fruity cheap cereal flavor. The finish makes me want to drink a glass of water, and eat a handful of pretzel nuggets before switching to something better. Is there a time and place for this? Yes, but not here, not now."
"A beer for the long haul, even light weights find this beer in their hand no less than 10 times in an evening. Not the best macro lager I've ever had but it's a damn good one in my opinion."
"Very pale yellow body with about a finger of head that quickly dissipates. Smells malty with a hint of hop. Tastes Sweet and watery. Not really noticing any hops here. Reminds me in some ways of Molson Ice in its flavor. Becomes somewhat more flavorful as it warms, but still fairly watery. Very drinkable, though. And very cheap. I would say this beats anything the Big 3 make (yes, I know Miller makes it now). Im sure its better on tap than from the 16 oz can Im drinking."
"Looks and smells like cheap beer taste on the other hand is out of the park this is some good tasting stuff and highly drinkable for the $9-10 a 24 pack"
"PBR Me!"
"Can: Poured a very light yellow color beer with a medium white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of corn and adjunct is not surprisingly dominating. Taste is as bland as it can be done with no aftertaste at all (which is probably the purpose but does not provide me with any satisfaction."
"For a very cheap macro, it could be much worse. I had a few of these at the pool in the heat on Sunday and found that I felt more like I was drinking beer than if I had many the big, more expensive macros. If you are in a place that allows only cans, you can do worse, especially for the price."
"The color is almost clear, little to no body. Foamy head that, reminds me of the foam you'd see on a questionable lake. The color of urine when you are close to hydrated. Smell of metal, a tinge skunky, no real hops or barley character. Taste is subtle with little to no complexity. Taste of metal, mild yeast a little sour, thin no alcohol warmth. Really this is not a good beer, but out of the macros I'd rather drink it than bud or any other cheep completely quantitative beers. Maybe simply for old times sake, but likely not."
"I could imagine wanting one of these after along day of work or mowing the lawn or something."
"We had a saying when I was in college. ""$4 rebate? You can't afford not to drink it."""
"This is a classic macro that has enjoyed quite a resurgence in the market at least in the southeast. While in college the only place one could find PBR was at either sketchy roadhouses or frat houses when money was low. Now it's at practically every beer bar out there. Pabst, among others, has really stepped up their marketing, and many classic macros have a much larger presence now (e.g. Miller High Life and even Schlitz). PBR is beer that brings back nostalgia as I drank it regularly in college. It has more flavor and body than most macros and is very easy drinking. I just enjoyed 3 of them for $2 each @ Gene's Haufbrau in Charleston S.C. When money's low PBR is always a decent alternative. FYI it was Pabst who originally invented the 6 pack."
"I got PBR because I heard that it might be a decent macro brew. Well it is. It pours extremely pale with a frothy head that quickly dissipates. I can smell corn before even puting might nose near the glass, but this subsides into a flowery sweet aroma. It tastes almost as light as it looks and leaves light sweet taste on the toungue. Imminently refreshing this is with a drinkability that would embarass any other beer I can think of. And what's more? It's cheap as hell! Apparently it's a classic though I would never know. This gets a five for drinkabilty for the ease with which it is drunk and for the ease with which it is purchased."
"Pours a light golden yellow color with pretty much no head (poured from a can into a mug). Average macro lager smell to it, with a hint of corn. The taste matches the smell, a typical macro lager with a hint of corn. Has a slightly sour taste to it. Very easy to drink, with a good amount of carbonation, making it nice, light, and crisp. Feels very light in the mouth, with a lot of carbonation. Very good for a cheap beer...very good for the style..."
"Eric"
"This beer pours a very pale golden with no more head then you would get from soda. By the time I has poured out the whole beer there was absolutely no head. Not very impressive smell with a sour wheat quality. It has a light hops taste with not much of an after taste. It has a slightly heavy feel with a little bit of a sudsy texture. Over all this beer is very well balanced. It doesnt have much of a taste but it doesnt have a bad taste. If you looking for a smooth beer thats really easy to drink this would be a good one."
"Pale golden body that crystal clear and constant carbonation rising. It looks like any other American Macro Lager. The smell and taste are nothing to special either. The both are filled with corny adjuncts. The mouthfeel is paper thin and it goes down like water. Not the worse Beer I've had but not the best by a long shot."
"This is a solid affordable beer, a bit boring compared to other Lagers with corn hops but still respectable."
"Went to pick up some beers to take to the lake and finally took up the recommendation from Kmpitz2 and purchased a sixer for the trip. The good thing about the beer is that there is nothing wrong with it. The look is a crystal clear and hightly carbonated canary yellow. Could have better head retetion. The flavors are grain, adjuncts, and vegetable-like. Nice tones of green apples and a light lemon-zest. Very light and playful in the body, with a very clean finish. A little dry and a little watery, but it is to be expected. Though there are no real standout characters, the flaws are what you'd expect for the style. Not bad stuff."
"It has a decent taste and it's very drinkable. Slightly sour, of course, but it's better than you might expect. Also, it's generally cheaper at the bars. If you're needing cheap beer, try this over your usual Bud/ Miller/ Coors varieties."
"Actually, this is a little icky. I think I'll avoid it in the future."
"Definitely one of the best American Macros. Nothing offensive about this beer at all, and much better than 90% of BMC offerings. Give this one a try."
"Extremely pale straw color topped with some white head that quickly disappers. Sweet smell of white bread, sweet corn, and college. Very simple and bland tastes. Nothing stands out as good, but nothing stands out as offensive either. Mostly a sweet corny malt flavor. No hop taste, but they must be there because it finishes pretty clean. Very bubbly and light. Easy and fun to drink because of all the memories. Not great, but the price is right for a big night of drinking."
"Frank Booth: Heineken? Fuck that shit! Pabst Blue Ribbon!"
"Both Stroh's and PBR have come through with flying colors in the tenth iteration of the MacSmack series. It's a shame that there has to be a loser. By virtue of its superior head and slightly creamier mouthfeel, Pabst Blue Ribbon takes the much-coveted crown. Really though, either one of these venerable American beers would be a good choice for reliving the good old days of one's youth."
"Ah yes the good old PBR. It's been quite the staple of my College life always finding it's time honored place in our refrigerator. It's a good beer for a nice cold shower after a day in the muggy New Orleans summer heat. However, this is by no means a good beer. I do prefer a Pabst Blue Ribbon over any Bud/Miller product any day, but this is only when I'm too broke to get a quality craft brew. After having an assortment of Abita and Sierra Nevada Kegs over the last month or so we got a little pour and decided to toss in a $59 keg of PBR into the kegerator. The PBR pours a light pale yellow and has a repulsive smell. After a night of drinking I woke up to find some beer stains on my shirt which were emitting quite a repulsive odor. However, the beer does go down smooth and is very very easy to drink. PBR, not the best of beers, but maybe one of the best of the cheap domestics."
"Pours a pale yellow with very little head. Smell has a faint grassy aroma. Taste likewise has a faint malt presence, a very light hop finish. Mouthfeel is just a tad creamy...not bad. Very easy to drink. This is a beer I wouldn't mind having during a round of golf or after mowing the lawn...better than bud."
"It is, however, fairly cheap; and a throwback to what I used to think beer tasted like as a kid. Recommended? Not really, but you can do far worse!"
"I won't waste any time with how it pours, how it looks, how it smells. On those counts it is exactly like any American Macro out there. At $6 a 12-pack (bottles or cans) there is a simple way to review this beer: It is way above average for what it is. For an American Macro on the cheap it has flavor and there is nothing offending about it. It is better than most American Macros out there and even those pushing twice the price. For whatever reason I find the beer out of a can better than the bottle. A good lawnmower beer. If you can find Schlitz I would go for it instead but if not, Pabst is a good choice."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, it's one of those cheaper beers worth getting over miller light (milwakee and all). For cheap beers, i'd prefer Shlitz anyday, but i know a lot of people loving this. good for them."
"I feel guilty giving scores this high to an American Macro, but judging by style, I'm probably marking it low."
"Drinkability - Below average drinkability. There are better macros out there, but it's drinkable when it comes to macros."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink, not offensive as it is mostly concieved. Great beer for social gatherings."
"I will keep this one as my session beer."
"It was better than I expected. Somehow I had never had PBR while I was a poor/college student beer guzzler. I had to try it and see how it tasted."
"I can't listen to someone tell me that this beer tastes SO much better than 'other macros'. What is the deal here? Here's what this beer has going for it....it is not as repulsive as Natty light, but is just as cheap. It'll get you drunk and can wash down food."
"Pours the typical light yellow with the quickly disipating head. No surprises. Smell is really grainy with a hint of booze. Surprising for the low abv. Really pleasant and not too sweet in the taste. Kind of drying in the finish. Mouthfeel doesn't suffer from the typical prickliness of excess carbonation. This is really good if you want to drink at home/at the bar on the cheap and makes a good summertime refreshment."
"Light yellow color. The head is very large initially and retains fairly well considering its a macro. Unbelievably disgusting oceanic aroma (sea water, salt, seaweed) along with light grains and corn. Watery, corny flavor with hints of light grains and sauvignon blanc. Terrifying."
"I forgot to note the cool ""poker caps."" The bottle caps have card values on the inside, so you can play games like poker and blackjack. Pit your caps against everyone else's, and the loser pays."
"Had this at the showplace theatre in Buffalo, NY for 2 bucks a pop. This is a whole nother beast on tap. The beer was an average looking american macro gold with a very small faom cap. The aroma was really sweet and grainy. Very clean and inoffensive when compared to bud or miller. Taste is actually kinda hoppy. Mouthfeel is thin to moderate. Very smooth. This is incredibly drinkable espcially when you compare the tap version to the bottle or can. This is much sweeter and smooth on tap. If this is on tap with the other standard crap I will have to go with this."
"Drinkabitly is OK , leaving me in a search for the perfect summer quencher."
"Pours a light golden. Fluffy head quickly disappears. Not much lace,but lots of bubbles.Smell is of light malt. Body is light and carbonated.Taste is sweet with a hint of hop. This beer is by no means offensive,and it's cheep. I'm sure that's why the college kid's love it!"
"Verdict: Solid canned lager. Nothing great, but it quenches the thirst in a reasonably satisfying manner."
" Seeing the 4.7% ABV proves to me why this is so popular among the young, trendy, and close-to-broke. There's no introspection here - no depth, no notes, nothing hidden or worth finding on the 2nd or 3rd tasting. It's a blue collar brew that does it's job and nothing more. I'm glad I gave it a try!"
"Oh right, nostalgia. Yawn."
"This is a nice macro lager...nothing offensive about it, just a nice clean crisp flavor that is able to avoid the ""just took a breath of wet air"" finish that comes from some macros. Best served quite cold as a refreshing beverage after hard work on a hot day. It also doesn't seem to lose too much when drunk from the can, so it's great to take camping or fishing."
"Really not a bad beer, and pretty good by macro standards. I'd prefer High Life or Schlitz, but would do nicely in a pinch."
"A Pabst Blue Ribbon, can be a refreshing beer, under the right circumstances. IY pours a clear lihky golden color into the glass. THe head is nice and foamy. The smell is reminiscent of an bar you have been into. It makes your think of stale beer, and sloppy floors. The taste is pretty much nonexistent. The mouthfeel is crisp. This is not necessarily an achievement, considering the absence of flavor to begin with. Not the macro lage I would reach for again: don't get got up in the fad. I would recommend a Miller High Life instead."
"Pours a clear straw sort of color with a quickly dissipating head leaving no lace, bubbles flying up from the bottom. Mostly a grain smell, pretty clean, with a hint of floralness. Grainy in taste, but not in a bad way, a little bit of corn, and only a touch of hops. Taste almost dances on your tongue with the amount of carbonation. I imagine this as a great beer with many different foods. Higher carbonation, but seems to be a nice addition to this one. Light to medium body, I expected very light body, but having a little something there is nice. I usually don't save any room for macro's in my fridge, but I may be able to squeeze a little room for this. Seems like this would be good for many occasions, BBQ, lawnmowing, fishing, just being out and about and just wanting something simple."
"PBR poured a clear golden color with a one inch head that went away rather quickly. Aroma was citrusy and fruity with a faint whiff of corn. Taste was very fruity and spritzy with a slight hop bitterness and some malt character in the finish, but not much. This beer had an incredibly thin mouthfeel. It was pretty bland and watery tasting, which is the standard for most macros I guess. I could see this as a refreshing drink after mowing the lawn in 90 degree temperatures."
"Notes: I'm in....Pabst and Budweiser are the two macros that see time in my fridge. They know how to make a fairly tasteless beer without any ""edges"" or something to possibly send you to another brand. It is what it is....a cheap brew that doesn't offend."
"With other options on the grocery shelf--namely Miller High Life and Milwaukee Best Light--the low price is not even a saving grace. Some people get used to the taste from buying the cheap beer on the shelf, but I honestly can't support anyone even 'tasting' this beer."
"So I was at a bar, and didn't feel like anything but a thirst quencher, and as I'd never had PBR, I thought I'd give it a go, not expecting anything except a cool, boring liquid. Well, it pours a nice golden color with a surprisingly long lasting head. Really, little smell to it, just a thin grassy, grainy malt. Good medium body and nice carbonation up front, with a grainy malt through the middle, and if I remember, a slightly bitter ending. Basically, pour this and don't give me the name, and I'd mistake it as a micro. maybe. Pretty drinkable beer though, a real thirst quencher."
"This beer is actually tasty on tap. The taste and smell are about the same as from the can, but the appearance and mouthfeel are quite a bit superior. It feels fuller and smoother. The head on the beer is also creamier and softer. Good choice for a cheaper keg at a party. The less-harsh carbonation also makes this more drinkable. As far as American Macro Lagers go, this is up there."
"Musings: Along with Schlitz, my macro of choice for the pounding sessions. I don't find the flavor of the PBR as noticeably sweet as the other macros. I like it from the can and not the bottle."
"This is one of the best mass produced beers I have run across. I prefer it to many of the others in it's class. I feel it packs more flavor and color then many of it's competitors. It pours a nice yellow and has a faint citrus taste to go along with it."
"clear to watery and brownish. corny malt odor is weak and watery smelling. taste is ok for its type. regular old macro flavor. sweet, grassy, corny, some malt taste evident. kind of watery but pretty drinkable overall. tastes like dave's party pants."
"This beer pours a very clear golden yellow with a thick fluffy white head. The smell is sort of fruity or grainy. The taste is a little sweet up front, but not cloying. Definitely a good choice if you're going macro. Clean, crisp taste not bad compared to the competition."
"Listen--this isn't a great beer. BUT, it is the best of its breed. American Macro Lagers are expected to be light-colored and virtually flavorless, with little-to-no hop aroma. And this dive-bar classic does it without making you feel like you're drinking a Men's-Room Special. The body is slightly more full, more malt-driven than your Bud or Miller varieties, and it delivers a surprisingly complex (albeit slight), clean, almost-citrus like finsh that at least gives you some indication that you've just taken a sip of something other than water. Add in the nostalgia factor (which is no small part) and you're looking at a classic American brew that definitely has a time and a place to be enjoyed. Appreciate it for what it is, my friends."
"Don't let retro lovers convince you that this is a good beer. Sure it may be cleaner tasting than Bud, but it is still a macro adjunct lager. So speaking of adjuncts, aroma is of sour corn mash and yeast. Pours a nice golden color, brilliant to the light. For a macro, nice amount of hops bitterness, zero hop aroma. Fairly light bodied for a non light beer."
"Very bright clear yellow, watery thin and no hop aroma nor much malt either, very grainy in aroma and in flavor, yet this grain isn't real strong so you can power tons of this stuff. It is difficult to write two hundred and fifty characters to describe a beer that has nothing really going on other than the fact it makes you pee and make you look studly because you cam power a case and still operate a lawn mower...hence the name lawnmower beer"
"88 cents for a pint can, not bad price for macro stuff. Pours a piss yellow, smells quite grainy and sweet. Tastes sweet with an unusual citrusy flavor but it's kind of weak. Mouthfeel is watery as normal for macros i've had. Very drinkable as this is supposed to be for a mass market. It won't win any awards except best in redneck category!!"
"The beer pours a pale yellow, about average for a macro lager. It smells grainy, not much more than that. Tastes similar to the smell, a mild grainy maltiness, with a small but noticable amount of hops. PBR goes down easy enough, and at $48 for a 1/2 barrel, its the perfect beer for a college party. I would still take it over most macros, given the choice."
"At the bar where I reviewed this, the PBR was three bucks a pitcher, hence, the reason I drank it. Though, I do usually get a bad hangover after drinking alot of this stuff, I still consider it my favorite macro."
"Oh boy. What can I say. Basic yellow color, no head to speak of. Smells and tastes like cheap malt with almost zero hops. Mouthfeel is kinda crisp, but not really. Why did I bother to review it? I'll tell you why. I drink it almost every sunday, for a buck, served from the tap in a PBR goblet no less (which i find totally hysterical), with my chicken dinner at the tavern. And despite the fact that it sucks, I enjoy it every time."
"D - Mild flavor, easy to drink. Absurdly easy to session. I would pick other beers over PBR for food choices though."
"Poured into a pint glass. This beer is almost always drank out of the can and sometimes the bottle. The appearance is a slightly SLIGHTLY darker straw color. The head is there for a second and quickly turns into a collar. If you pour agressively it's usually a bit impressive looking. The smell - is just normal APA beer which is still good to me as a smell - that's what we're going for here. The taste is a bit of dull malts with a slightly crisp hop finish. ( still good) The mouthfeel is sticky. Drinkability is quite good as long as you don't get tired of it and want something high-brow."
"Not my fantasy island beer but if I HAD to drink this, I wouldn't complain."
"Overall, what can I say? It's a macro and cheap and not very good. One could probably easily chug a whole bunch of these. There would be no true beer appreciation, though. Next time someone offers, I'll pass."
"The drinkinkability is quite good considering all of the above. It does quench some thirst, believe me. Will I buy this beer again? Well, hopefully, it'll be just as cheap as last time."
"Overall a pretty good beer based on what it is, definately better than anything spat out by the big 3. And for those who want to turn their nose up at you for drinking an ""old mans beer", go look in the mirror, you're getting old like he was. If it was good enough for Grandpa, its good enough for me, PBR me ASAP!"
"Well what do you do when you are in a bar with nothing good on tap and you will be there for a few hours with company folk. Drink PBR on tap and seem cooler than everyone else that is having Coors light out of the bottle. It looks good like a golden ale and is darker than I remember, nice white head with mild staying power and even some lace. Well I wish I hadn't given up smoking as it smells like corn and reminds me instatnly of beer drinking days of yore. It doesn't taste half bad, corny and sweet with some bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is decent if a little slimy, I know slimy sounds bad but that is the only way I can desrcibe it. I had four pints in the hour+ we were there."
"Drinkability-I have to have one every once in awhile , especially during a Red Sox game while eating peanuts. Not cashews, peanuts. Or State Line potato chips. Then it works. It more of a ceremonial beer than a regular drinker."
"Not much to say about this brew... better than BMC for the most part, but still not good by any stretch of the imagination."
"drinkability = it's palatable but will give me hangovers if I drink more than 2 or 3"
"Hmm, this is a macro I'm not too familiar with. You can get this in pretty much any liquor store around here, but no way I'm cluttering up my fridge with 6 bottles of something that's not supposed to be good, and bars just don't have this on tap in my experience. Anyway, there's a bowling alley near me that does and I tried this on a whim not too long ago. I have to say this is definately decent. Everything about it is pretty macro-standard but not in a bad way. The appearance is a sort of gold-yellow. Macro standard, but the better kind of macro standard at least. Head is thin, but I found it creamy, while it lasted at least. No lacing was visible, but then again this was in a plastic cup (that's what you get in a bowling alley). Taste was fine. I found it quite sweet up front with some very mild bitterness in the finish. There was some adjunct grain but at least it was corn and not rice. Mouthfeel was like any other macro, but its not overcarbonated. Drinkability is fine so far as I know. But I only had one and when you're going with a beer with the sort of rep this one has, I think several would be a good idea before you pronounce the drinkability great. But anyway for now this has replaced Highlife as my reccomended cheap beer. Granted I also don't know how this tastes in a can or a bottle which would be interesting. But unless I'm hosting a whole bunch of friends on a budget(or visiting someone else who is) I won't be finding out right away. Anyway this is a decent beer for its category. Better than MGD, less likely to produce comments about skunk or paint than Rolling Rock (I've never had that problem, but I know lots of other people complain about it), and way cheaper than Labatt Blue or Stella."
" The taste is crisp and has some decent hop characteistics and a slightly dry, bitter finish. It's clearly a macro but not in a bad way..more like a comfortable old pair of shoes. If you don't know what this is, go get some, but I don't think there are too many BA's who don't know PBR."
"Rediscovered this old friend on tap at a new local BBQ place and I have been enjoying it in cans with BBQ since. Average american canned lager that somehow tastes better then Bud or Miller. Maybe it is just warm memories of my good old high school days."
"Regardless, I do like this beer a good deal. The taste has hints of corn, malt, and hops. I like the nutty taste that I get in the finish. It definitely refreshing. This is a very decent beer, and a very good value. A 30 pack costs around 15 and a pint rarely more than $2 at the bars I frequent."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick white head that dissapated quickly and does not lace. The smell is dominated by corn but there is some bitterness. The taste is just a little bland. Kind of your average beer taste. The is good carbonation and thickness. Its a decent beer to just sit around and drink."
"I could have had several of these with out thinking about it, but I only had the pint. Another good point about the Pabst was that it was well matched with the spicy catfish as food with beer means a lot to me."
"OK here's my real question about PBR....Is it beer-flavored water or water-flavored beer? It looks about like water too! I guess the one up side to PBR is that it is very light and I could see it being pretty refreshing compared to most other brews. I wouldn't bother to spend my money on it thoughif you're going to drink beer drink something that you can taste."
"Crisp but with a medium body. I actually kind of prefer this beer as it warms up. It's a pretty good beer to drink while cooking too because it will not destroy or affect your tastebuds and, consequently, I can properly sample what I am concontcing on my stove."
"3. Respect. That's right. For some reason, drinking a PBR seems to garner a certain amount of respect from other bar patrons. People assume that you must be a really tough person to actually be drinking a PBR. It seems to say, 'Check me out. I'm wild, I'm crazy. I'm not afraid of anything. Watch out!' I think this is especially true sometimes for me because I'm female. As an added bonus, I've discovered men seem to totally dig the idea of women drinking PBR. Maybe it's that whole wild and crazy thing..."
"Poured out a crystal clear yellow gold brew with a 1 finger head.Moderate carbonation.Has a corn\grainy smell.Taste is hmm a little rough.Very sweet up front,with that corny lingering taste ,,nothing in the way of hops. Crappy feel. In the battle between this or high life,,high life definitely wins."
"Pours a pale yellow, very clear, small white head forms and goes real fast, no lacing. Smell is sweet and honeylike, with some grass and citrus. Taste is sweet malt up front, with citrus and grass hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is high. Perfect swill beer for watching hockey."
"An admirable beer for the purpose, I believe this is the best of the American ""drink while enjoying other activities"" beers."
"overall this beer really isn't that bad, i like it better than Bud and about the same as High Life. It does the trick when you don't really care."
"As for the drinkability, I wouldn't buy a case of this. The only time I drink this is when my friends and I all get together and drink. I usually throw in a few bucks for beer so that I am not only drinking the six pack that I have brought with me. I really don't recommend this beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Lawnmower beer, hot days beer, BBQ on the beach beer, call it what you want. It's not really bad to drink at all for cheap stuff. I will buy some again when in the appropriate mood."
"Yup, I'm broke but wanted to review beers tonight. Obtained from the discount bin of Liquor Mart (Boulder). Pours a finger and a half fizzy white head that quickly settled. The liquid is light straw-orange with a couple streamed of bubbles feeding the half-layer of head left on the beer. Smells dark hops, wet cardboard and fresh dark mushrooms. Malt sweet is way beneath, as is a little bit of sting, which I think is from carbonation release. Tastes sweet to start with a noticable hop oil on the tongue. The aftertastes sees a burst of hop floral in the back of the mouth. Yes, I do not exaggerate, 'burst'. Some grain in the malt character early, but this vanishes upon the swallow to leave and empty space in the flavor. Despite this, this beer is actually tasty. A bit more carbonated than I'd like, so I will swirl to release some of the CO2. The smell is now more of a wet hay than cardboard & mushroom. With the carbonation decreased, the beer is quite a bit more flavorful. I just don't understand why macro lagers are so overcarbonated that they make carb sting a main component of the flavor profile. The hops are still quite noticable, perhaps a touch stronger than the weak malt dictates. Md thin body. Drinkable, yeah, very nice. Judged to style, not to my flavor preferences."
"Definately better than PBR from a can, it tastes crisper and doesn't have that metallic taste. I don't have to force down the last few sips when drinking this from the bottle, even after letting it warm up a bit. I find PBR to have a slightly better taste which is more enjoyable than say, coors light. Slightly bitter taste, maybe from a touch of hops? For the price, drinkability is great. It's not hard at all to put down a few of these."
"I bought a twelve of PBR to take camping last night and I must say thank God that's over with. This beer looks undistiguishable from any other Macro. I can't even begin to describe the taste if not kept at a cool temp. Say around -12 degrees. The taste was right in line with what you would expect from a $4 twelve pack. I think cheap beer has an important place in society, but it damn sure ain't in my beer cooler."
"When the situation calls for a low abv macro beer and some situations do. I think it's best to just get the cheapest b/c it's hard to distiguish the taste between them. The cheapest is usually PBR. It's a cheap beer plain and simple."
"cheers..."
"Notes: This is the best of the college beers. Perfect drinkability for watching a movie in the winter or sitting on the porch in the summer. Always a treat to find one in the beer bath at a party. Even better in the long neck."
"On tap @ Barnaby's in Aston, PA. Pours the standard macro pale yellow with a one finger head that quickly goes away. I was surprised by how little carbonation there was, I could actually count the few bubbles rising in the glass on one hand. I tried like hell to find an aroma, but didn't have any luck. Taste is the usual cheap macro maltiness, with no hops present. Thin mouthfeel. Overall, nothing REALLY offensive, but nothing to seek out either. Great for washing down bar food while watching the Eagles smack the 49ers around, and quite a bargain at $2 a pint (it's most redeeming quality). It is what it is...swill for the masses."
"i get made fun of alot after telling people that i enjoy an ice cold can of PBR from time to time, however it's always from the people thast think that miller lite is some sort of golden nectar so i pay no mind to the laughter. the truth is that PBR is one of the best beer values on the market today. it looks like a traditional american lager, you know like a corn yellow. has a nice white head that doesn't stay very long, and no lacing to speak off. smells like corn to me. and i find it to have a nice sweet taste. goes well with bratwurst, and hot dogs with sour kraut. you can knock these puppies back if you want to and still feel ok the next day. but for 12.99 a 30 you can't go wrong. it is also a very good beer to cook with."
"As a beer in general PBR has nothing to brag about. BUT side by side with similar macros that cost almost double this beer is not only good but is a steal."
"I'll drink it at college parties, and it's maybe a step above Milwaukee's Best or Natty."
"Ill highly recommend its light malts and grains over the other big macros."
"A perfect camping/BBQ beer. Light and easy to pound down to wash away hot dogs or burgers. This is certainly far from gourmet but you need to examine the context in which it is to be drunk and rank it with its competitors. I would never drink this beer indoors but have decided it is a must on any camping trip to NH, ME, or VT. The taste itself is slightly less watery and more flavorful than Bud/Miller/Coors. For that it gets my recommendation when used in a situation I've detailed above."
"Up until recently I didn't know PBR truly came outside of cans (its natural habitat). Pours golden with bubbles throughout and a big broken foam head that faded slowly and smeared (glass not quite clean?). Feable attempt at malts, some hops, a slight artificial sweetness. Some citris hit my nose each time I pulled the glass up. It reminds me more of old Grain Belt than anything else. Much more tolerable off tap, not too bad actually if the heat is on."
"This beer is cheap and recommended by a lot of advocates as the poor man's beer. I'll tell you it is clear, straw fizzy beer with a white ring of head. Smells like nearly nothing, but at least it doesn't smell bad. It is a little malty. The taste is sour like soda water, a little bitter in a sort of metallic way that I can't stand. It isn't as bad as some but not something I'm going out of my way for even at the bottom dollar price. Mouthfeel is crisp and light. Like I said, I can't drink this stuff one after another. It has an offensive taste to me."
"meh. Dissappointing."
"poyred a pale yellow color with abundant white puffy head that had good retention. Smell is mild with only sweet notes present. Taste is refreshing and thirst quenching. It is the perfect beer for a hot summer day. Finishes wet and refreshing. Has its place in the fridge."
"Seriously, don't be so serious!!"
"This is far better than most American Macros. It should always be served by the pounder can, or on tap. It has a clean taste that can simplify the beer drinking experience for even the jaded beer geek. A great lawn mower beer. I would recommend it based on it's style and it's competition. This beer is far better than the majority of macros out there."
"There's nothing like a frosty cold PBR on a hot summer day. This is definately a quaffing beer! I know it's not the best brew out there, but there is a certain place in our lives and hearts for Pabst. This beer has a golden color and decent enough head to it, but I prefer to drink this one straight from the can....a 16oz Tall Boy!"
"I tried to find something good in this and I couldn't. The only thing that was ok was the appearance. It was a pale yellow color that somewhat of a head of foam on it. No smell, except maybe some grains. No taste, not even malt. It was just water with a watery mouthfeel. The drinkability is high for me because this some of the cheapest beer on the market and it shows it. The can made me laugh because it said it was made with some of the finast ingredients and voted America's best beer in 1893. A good beer maybe in that year, but thats over 110 years ago. Drink if free."
"if you are looking for a beer that taste the same day in and day out pabst is that beer."
"Starts off with a big fluffy head that quickly disipates. Pale gold colour. Not the typical urine colour of most pale lagers, but a pale gold. Smells of pale malts, bread, and grass. Simple. Tastes, quite good, actually. Simple, plain, and good. Like a decent, basic homebrew. Sweet at first, with a bit of bitterness and grass in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is clean and dry. Very drinkable. Great session beer."
"If i'm buying beer for a cookout/bbq/party... this is my first choice. Dad's beer has the sentimentality that makes it very drinkable. I've also noticed when pouring out of a can, Pabst keeps its head quite well. Tickly bubbles they are. There is a bit more flavor in this beer than most of this style, but it certainly doesn't compete in a finest beer category overall. That's fine... it doesn't need to. Dad could care less."
"I would say this beer is the beer I would buy over all other American macros. It's drinkability is substantially higher that the big trio."
"Pours a very clear straw, producing a two and a half finger head of white soap bubbles. Good retention and lots of spotty lacing. Husky grain and adjunct nose, with some stale german hop aromas. The taste is slightly sweet with grainy adjuncts and mabye a bit tannic but no ester or off-flavors; very nuetral. Semi-dry aftertaste with a hint of saaz hop bitterness. Medium carbonation and light mouthfeel that finshes clean and very sessionable. A cut above other american macros."
"It's been a little too long since I drank a PBR, maybe because of the beer snobbery that has taken over me. That's too bad because this one can get a bad rap since its the chaepest beer around and its the beer many of our father's drank. Not too bad. Typical macro, corn taste and smell, not too overwhelming. Pours a fine head with nice carbonation. Definitely easy enough to drink. A fine example of a true American historical beer."
"Man to someone who lives in Wisconsin, you have to toast a PBR once in a while. For a time, Pabst was all I drank, because I had very little money and no job. So if you do not live in Wisconsin or have very little money, steer clear of this beer. Now that I have the negatives out of the way, time to talk about the positives. If you want a cheap beer that you and you alone can enjoy, then this beer is for you. Also one of the best aspects of this beer is that it is readily available in the state of Wisconsin, and now I am out of college and having to pinch every penny, Pabst comes in handy for those hot days in WI. So enjoy a PBR on me."
"In my many years of beer drinking I honestly can't recall drinking a PBR. I'm certain I've never purchased one, before today. This 12 oz bottle from a six pack pours a clear, pale golden body that is actively carbonated. Once inch white head evaporates in seconds, and leaves no remnants of lace. Aroma is unremarkable, with subdued notes of adjunct grain sweet maltiness and a suggestion of vague hop. It's light bodied in the mouth, with bountiful carbonation. The taste is unappealing. Corn syrup sweetness, light grain presence, a metallic offnote, and muted hops bitterness. Tastes like cardboard, with an acrid finish. Crisp, but not what I would deem refreshing. Not as clean as other macros I've tried the past two years. Very disappointed that this is inferior to Coors and Bud."
"Pours into my Pabst Blue Ribbon Chalice a brilliant yellow color with a light coat of head that falls to almost coat the beer. The nose is light, slight grain and a very faint noble hop. Some light honey sweetness. Pretty standard. The flavor is actually nice. The honey-touched sweetness stands out to me first. The graineyness and light hop are mellowed out by the (corn I think) sweetness. A very nice flavor for the style. The feel is even a good solid moderate with a moderate carbonation. I let a little time go by before I sat down to this beer again with intentions of rating. It still comes through as a solid and drinkable beer. Had one off tap a few months back and it really quenched after a big meal of Mexican food."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this one. Pours a very clear yellow color with no head, leaves no lacing on the glass. There's not much going on in the aroma - standard lager smells. Nothing special here. The flavor is what would be expected. Standard macro lager flavors, but it actually has more taste than most of the macros, surprisingly. Slight malt character, slight hop profile. Nothing wonderful, but it's an acceptable session brew if you feel like slumming it."
"Mouthfeel is a bit watery, not heavy, nothing great, but I've definitely had worse. Still, you can have several at one sitting without a problem. This is a great cheap bar beer- there are SO many better beers out there, but everyone should partake in a pabst every once in a while- just for the memories to be associated with it. I salute you, PBR."
"Then I marched up to Vista Bridge for a read, not a jump!"
"Farewell to Falstaff. Went to Mangias for a final can or two since they no longer will be made. And after couple, switched to PBR for ol time sake. From a bottle, these werent too bad. Actually could taste a bit of grain with decent amount of hops. Still over filtered, over carbed  but a decent summer session brew if nothing else is around."
"I've always shunned PBR. I've always grouped it with Miesterbrau, Schlitz, Old Milwaukee, Natural light ect... Ive been laid-off now for a few months so iv'e been basically buying Bud lately. I saw a six of PBR Talls at the store for 4.50 bucks and said what the hell and tried it. For what it is I was very surprised! much better than Bud, Miller, and Coors. Good taste for what it is, goes down smooth and very refreshing. This is definitely my new cheap domestic for now on. no more Bud. the 6 of talls only cost $4.50. what a deal! A great beer to chug on a hot summer day. (without the massive Bud headache the next morning)"
"Pours a urine yellow color. A quickly fading frothy white head. Smells of grain and corn and nada else. Taste is next to nothing, somewhat sweeter, but there is a little bitterness to balance it out. This is my go to brew. If I need a macro it has always been pabst. cant go wrong with the pbr."
"Like the Johnny Russel song says, ""red necks, white socks and blue ribbon beer."" You ""sophisticated"" city folk wouldnt understand. Down here, we like manly brew. There is only 1 reason to drink...and that is to get drunk. This beer tastes just fine to me. It does its job quite well. Why pay big money for some fancy beer? You are just gonna piss it out. It all ends up in the same place when its all said and done. If you want to enjoy what you drink, drink some sweet tea or somethin."
"Crackling carbonation can not quite overcome a thin mouthfeel. Easy drinking macro, I would prefer this one over AB, Coors, etc. Comparable to a High Life, but a bit below an Old Style or Point."
"Drinkability: It is not that bad. It is not exceptionnal, but just a good cheap beer to get loaded with. Also, it was one of the most popular brands when I was at that bar in Chicago."
"Mouthfeel is a bit too still, surprising given that it's from a can. I though this one would be bubbly carbonated. Still, this is one quaffable brew, and if I found myself in a dive that was classy enough to stock this one, I would hesitate only just a bit. Haha. Okay, maybe I'd order a scotch, but I think I've lost my prejudice for this beer. It is the antithesis of ""Haterade."""
"Don't hate the playa, hate the game. Pabst ain't no joke and it ain't no lie neither. Better recognize."
"I'm pretty sure that it's time for the folks at Pabst to move on. If the label on my beer is to be believed, Pabst was selected as ""America's Best"" in 1893. (Was there some sort of great beer shortage that year?) Now tradition is all well and good, but food quality awards were never meant to be bandied about over 100 years after given."
"This is an acceptable shit beer if you don't have the money to buy a half rack of something slightly better, and DEFINITELY don't have the money for something good. Otherwise, skip it."
"Drinkability: I got a weird look from the cashier at the local beer distributor when I brought up a 30-pack of PBR and a case Victory Hop Devil. Kind of a weird ying-yang there I admit, but sometimes you want something big and bold, and sometimes you want the cheap-ass watered down macro, and as far as they go, PBR is one of my favorites. Easy-drinking, the carbonation is the only thing keeping me from downing one of these in one chug. Id take a PBR over a Bud, Coors or Miller any day!"
"Notes: As far as the fizzy little yellow beers are concerned, this one takes home a prize for having a bit of taste. No bold or fun characteristics, but it has something. There is a bit of something there, and I will honor them for that."
"This definitely was a macro beer that I'll return to time and again. I'm told it causes bad hangovers, so I would suggest drinking lots of water to stay hydrated while you drink it. But for one beer, it was very good."
"Straw yellow color and a small bubbley head. Lots of bubbles from carbonation. Smells like grassy grain and some faint hops. Has a very clean grainy malt with a faint hop background. Some sweetness from malts, but over all very thirst quinching. Very clean finish.This beer is a much better pick over the big three. A better quality American lager for a much less of a price. Pairs well with any kind of red meat!"
"Drank a bunch out of the can last night - might as well review one of the leftovers today. Pours into the pilsner glass a light gold/bright yellow with a 2 finger head that doesn't leave a lot of lacing and reduces to a very thin blanket. The aroma is corn with a slight lemony/peppery spice that reminds me of a hefe (interesting). The flavor is about the same with some adjuncts behind that and leaves me wondering how the hell there are lemon/pepper notes in an adjunct lager (but I'm not complaining). There is little aftertaste and the carbonation seems ok. As far as cheap beer goes this is one of the best and it tastes 100% better when poured into a glass."
"I could drink these in great quantities. So can you, considering it's cheap and yet of better quality than most swill. Quality, AND quantity: have your cake and eat it too! HA!"
"Not a good beer. Not a bad beer. Often my choice for quantity over quality. Lots of fond and fuzzy memories are associated in my mind with this here beer. For the money you're going to spend on it, it's actually pretty good. What I think is funny is that it seems to be becoming almost fashionable to drink which is the worst thing that can happen to a beverage. Pabst is for drunk and divy nights and it should stay that way."
"Picked up a 24 pack at the store for around $10. Tastes just as good out of the can as it does out of the bottle. All in all a nice beer to have around when you're not ready for a bigger beer, but still want something tasty. Either this or High Life have to be the best of the cheap beers."
"Well I couldnt avoid it forever. Clear pale golden color with tiny bubbles and a thick but short-lived white head. No real lacing to speak of. Aroma of sweetcorn and light hops. Light-bodied and somewhat crisp with a barely-there sweet flavor, and some bland hops. The finish is an off flavor that really prevents this from being a harmless, flavorless beer. The aftertaste is rather unpleasant, like wood varnish or something. Needless to say I wont be trying this again any time soon."
"At first I was somewhat surprised that this beer seemed drinkable. I wasnt expecting much, but the first few drinks werent that bad. It kind of reminded me of a Miller High Life Light at first. But as I went on, this beer got worse and worse. It gradually started tasting just awful. I found that strange as beer usually tastes better and better the more I drink. Anyways, it looked like piss, did not have hardly any smell, and the only noticable tastes were a bit of bread and a few grains. Nothing special at all. This is not even worth picking up if its the only thing you can afford. Better off sticking with Busch Light or even Natural Light. This beer flat out sucks!"
"This is probably my favorite budget priced american adjunct lager to date, still it isn't something to get too excited about. Color is light golden, head is average-sized and foamy. The aroma is of sweet macro smell, very typical. The taste has more depth than other adjuncts I've had, grain and hops are more apparent. The overall strong point of the taste is a grainy sweetness. This is very drinkable and well worth the very low price for a 12 pack. Hands down this is my money saver beer choice."
"-Enjoy"
"Drinkabilty: OK, a decent macro, nothing more. I don't go for trends, I just don't get them (like what was the deal with that goddamn Macarena thing?) and I don't get this one. Will I buy this again? Maybe try on tap, but that's it."
"Always nice to find this ""splendid blended"" lager on-tap. Not much of a head to speak of, with a pale yellowish appearance. I always found this beer to have a somewhat unpleasant smell, but the once it hits your lips the taste makes up for the odor. A very sharp, crisp taste which is eventually followed by an very abstract aftertaste that I have never found the words to describe. Overall it really does have a prized flavor when in the company of macrobrews. Captain Pabst is my hero."
"Taste: Pretty light, a bit too watery with a slight metalic twang, some corn, but with a little more malt than the usual macros. I don't want to start off the debate over drinkability as in ""chugability"" versus drinkability as in ""I would go out of my way to drink this again", so I'll give it a average 3. In the world of D- macros, this one gets a C-."
"I'm not much of a macro drinker, but I found this beer to be quite drinkable. It also didn't have the typical chemical flavor I find in other macro's. I'd probably get another Pabst if I was in a place that had this as the best selection."
"You are incredibly drinkable, Mr. Pabst. That I cannot ignore. And your taste. Well, let's just say it's heads and tails above the other beers of your ilk. Grainy and bready with hints of weeds. It serves to wash down just about any food quite well. You have a nice head, too, all big and foamy."
"I'm posting this one because PBR in a bottle is noticably different from PBR in a can. It's your usual fizzy yellow beer appearance, head is quickly gone, usual macro smell. However, I give this beer the distinction of the only macro I've ever tasted hops in. It's not like I'm even drinking a decent IPA, but the hops are there in the middle and the finish. Not bad. Not great, but I'll choose it over any macro (and quite a few crappy micros)"
"Mmmmm, PBR...The best beer in America as voted in 1893 when it was probably in competition against one other beer. Gold color with a slight head that even left some lacing on the glass, WOWWWW! The smell is almost non-existent. But damnit, it tastes just fine and you can drink it til the cows come home. By far my favorite of any cheap beer out there. We will make this world a better place, one Pabst at a time."
"Pours a simple light copper with a thin white head and no lcaing whatsoever. Smells like a decent macro-lager, but nothing special. Tastes like water with a pinch of grain mixed in. No complexity, and no flavor. So bland I could barely finish it. I used to like this is, but no more. Avoid."
"This was one of my Dads favorite beers. From a can, poured into a footed pilsner glass, this is a light, transparent yellow color with a white, pretty head. Unfortunately, the head doesnt last very long. Seems to have a little less carbonation than other, similar macros. Not much of an aromagrain, cornnothing else. Slightly sweet, very lightfairly smooth, with a less-than-crisp finish. Nothing distasteful, but nothing worthwhile either."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a light gold color with one finger of head that dies off quickly. Almost no lacing. The smell is light with just a hint of malty and grassy aromas. The taste is also grassy and malty, but it's very light on flavor. Nothing offensive though. The mouthfeel is very light and watery. The drinkability is good though. If I had to choose a macro to pair with pizza, this would be it."
"Tried PBR again for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Much more flavor than the big three. Hoppy aroma and a clean, fresh taste. Maybe I just was lucky and got a fresh bottle, but for the money, it can't be beat. My new go to beer when money is tight."
"I started drinking this beer after I became tired of the over-hyped premium brews out there. Beer pours a light yellow with little or no head. Smells like malt and nothing else. Taste of the beer is balanced, not too overpowering of hops/malt and can't detect the alcohol in the beer. I can drink this beer all day. While I like the premiums I am not afraid to slum it."
"Pours like seltzer, with the slightest tinge of pee. Smells like seltzer, with the slightest tinge of pee as well. Taste is rather nonexistent. It is impressively smooth, no skunk from this macro. But, the smoothness is so easy to create if there is no TASTE. However, I could down probably 2x the number of these than any other beer. Overall, I'd pick this over all the other macros if I'm playing beer pong."
"Taste is upfront sweet adjunct presence, with the slightest of crispness at the outset. The main observation I am presented with is ""watery"". Mouthfeel and drinkability are both okay for the style. Fits the 3 average for me: the only negatives are lacks of positives. Good for mowing the lawn, which I will be doing momentarily."
"Final Thought: This is the second best beer for price per quality (Honey Brown), definately a session beer when taste is irrelevant to your state of drunkeness..."
"Now from a goblet, I find there is an objectionable odor: vaguely nutty only putrid and rotten nuts. Phony cotton candy sweetness and ad hoc bittterness. I had hoped this would show-up a Baltic lager open on my desk. It did not. I can't figure out why this is the darling of slumming BAs. MHL is lots better. No change of score."
"Pours out a dingy but clean yellow. A big ole snow white head to begin with that settled down a thin film. Lacing wasnt much to speak of. Aroma was of cooked cabbage like smell as well. Taste was thin, watery, and not overly exciting. A grainy taste. Corn husks and steamed veggies. Carbonation was biting, but tolerable. Mouthfeel was thin and watery. Not very bitter, not very malty, but dry as a bucket of sand. Not a terrible beer, pretty standard macro lager. i wont complain, but there are better macros out there. enjoy."
"So far I've pretty much only been reviewing beers that I thought were exceptional, but tonight I'm paying a little homage to our old friend PBR. Looks like any cheap beer, pale yellow, not much head at all, too many bubbles. Smell doesn't really entice me at all, just reminds me of keggers. The taste actually isn't as bad as most ""cheap"" beers. Not much flavor at all, pretty much just watery with a touch of maltiness. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, I can actually feel the bubbles popping in my mouth. Well, I don't enjoy it a whole lot but it's pretty easy to drink. Ok, so we all know PBR isn't the best of beers, but it's not the worst at all. I'd say it's the best macro beer out there perhaps. After all, it was ""selected as America's best in 1893."" Anyway, plenty of more interesting beers out there, we are all aware of this I would hope, but hey, go easy on the little guy. When you're in a pinch for cash and in need of a party, a case of Pabst may come in handy. Cheers."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Still, the 20 oz. chalice I received for $4.00 on a hot day to down my mexican food was A-OK, as it is refreshing, and a little more exciting than water. It's like beer-flavored soda."
"One of the best, if not the best mass produced american beer."
"As a responsible journalist, I'll admit my bias: this is the house beer at Nyabinghi in Youngstown, OH, which is one of my favorite clubs. Buck a can on Monday nights. Come on down and join the PB Army."
"The taste was pretty awful, strong presence of adjuncts, either rice or corn i guess. A very fizzy mouthfeel like tonic water and even though we were out on a boat in the sun i couldn't drink any more of these."
"A decent looking lager from the pour out of the can, pale golden but lots of carbonation, as well as a fairly impressive foamy white head. It doesn't last long, but it's also something I don't see very often on an adjunct lager either. The aroma is light, slightly sour accompanied by a corn sweetness as well. Although I begin to wonder if there is a contingent of rice adjunct in there too. The flavour is light and pretty unoffensive, there is a slight underlying sweetness, and the mouthfeel and body makes me think that rice is the primary adjunct at work here. Not much malt, that's for sure. This would probably be the best cheap lager you can pick up in Canada at the moment given the price, damn near a buck a can which is almost unheard of (and completely unheard of for other drinkable beer in that category)."
"Cheers!"
"PBR (Oklahoma 3.2% ABW maximum) Pours to a quickly fading white head that forms a thin layer of foam that stays. Color is the typical pale American color. Flavor is much weaker than the full strength version (which is sold in liquor stores in OK). From the can there is a metallic harshness in the mouthfeel that ruins the experience. The ""low point"" version is very weak. I drank several in one night and barely got a buzz. For $4.99 / 12 pack, what do you expect? Beer is expensive in Oklahoma because of high excise taxes, btw."
"I didn't go into this tasting with too many high hopes and didn't come away feeling any worse for the experience. It fits the style to a ""T". It's not bad; you know, skunky or foul. It's just not anything. Not a brew I'd be eager to have again. I moved along smartly to a pint of SN Celebration Ale..."
"Well this one is a beer that anyone can drink. It is cheap and can befound in any store. $5.00 for a twelve pack a buddy and some fishing poles is a perfect combination for any summer day. A cooler to keep this yellow brew cold is a necessity. This brew does not taste good when it has even changed a few degrees from ice cold. Although I have to say for the price you can not beat this massed produced brew. Smooth taste, extreem yellowish clear color, and a nice blue ribbon on the can say it all. I am not sure when it won that ribbon but in todays beer world I do not think Pabst would get to many high honors. Well I know that this beer has missed my generation by a few years but I still find it an economical choice when feeding the masses for a party. It does have more flavor than Natural light and is compairable to Bud Light. For the true beer drinker I think you have to appreciate the road that this beer has travelled down. Not the best but by far not the worst."
"My first review is a trendy beer? PBR? The only reason I like this beer is it is the beer of the autoworker. When I was brainwashed into Busch and MGD land years ago, when I was a friends place that works at the Ford plant in Cleveland, he drank this exclusively. Foward about 10 years when I've had damn good micros and now, I'll say PBR is not half bad. I just kicked 5 back and I'm feeling no pain. Sure, it's average. Sure it's a lawnmower beer. But it has become a favorite for me. Better than the aforementioned Busch. When I want a good ""generic"" American ""burp beer"" I look for PBR."
"I guess this beer might be slightly better in taste than other American macros. There isn't that corny/rice adjunct taste that I usually get but there wasn't much else either. Some sweet, grainy malt is about all that I got. This reminded me of Molson. It was also thicker than other macros, but still rather smooth. Worth a drink when the wallet is light."
"very drinkable"
"Okay so Pabst isn't what I remembered, look at original can review and you will see that I didn't mind it. Pours a very light yellow with little to no head at all. Not much lacing to speak of either. Smell is grain and earth tones, slight metallic. Taste is of grain and very watered down, not bad for the price but still not good. Metallic hints as well. Feels light and flat in mouth, drinkable only on those sweaty days doing yard work."
"This just arrived in BC. and is sells for way less than most equivalent beers. The taste is not bad with a clean finish and not too much sweetness. I see value in what this beer is worth and would drink it again for lawnmowing/canoe sex etc where you just want a palatable cheap beer. Nothing to get too excited about but a pleasant surprise"
"Since Pabst has no brewery ! It's made by MIller..."
"Yes, it's basically better than most macros, but that's like saying Queen Elizabeth is hotter than Eleanor Roosevelt. I'm not touching either one of them. This beer is too sweet, too thin, and too indistinct to be any more than just another mass-produced brew. While about as drinkable as water, in theory, I wouldn't have another unless it was the only thing I could get hold of, and then I'd have to consider something non-alcoholic. I know some folks will take umbrage with this, but I just can't hop on the PBR bandwagon. However, I do use it often for beer-can chicken. It's a tradition. Don't ask."
"I can get a 6-pack of Portland Lager (from MacTarnahan's) for $3.75. PBR is not much cheaper than that. How about some local beer, eh, Portland paupers?"
"this is the beer of punk rockers. any good bar has this badboy on tap, to me this is the true ""average american beer"" and its good. don't ever dis PBR"
"This is actually the first PBR I've ever had. Can't say whether I like it better than the big three or not because I haven't had them in eons and don't really remember what they taste like. Maybe one day I'll try them all again just for kicks...but probably not!"
"I don't find anything here that would rate this any better than Bud or Coors. Typical macro-adjunct sweetness, thin and watery. Actually, both Coors and Bud have a more distinctive taste. I would still rank Miller high life as the best of the macros. After two of these, I could feel a headache brewing, and I felt bloated. On to something else, right now!"
"Lets face it, this is straight forward good beer. I can sit here and complain about macro's, but Pabst is pure quality and dependability. Looks a sweet, golden tan. Smells a nice thin hops with some grainy corn. The taste comes across as a bittery hoppy corn. Mouthfeel and drinkability are easy. Well worth having a few."
"This is my second big name lager of the night, and to be honest, I really enjoy it. This beats Bud, Miller, whatever hands down. If you're looking for easy drinking, cheap beer, give one a try. Or if you're on a college budget like me."
"Really not too bad at all. This is one I would've avoided were it not for the forgiving BA crowd. If I had to dumb down my beer choices due to budget, this is most likely what i'd reach for."
"20th and Wisconsin Avenue, west of Marquette U. You get a good feel for Capt. Pabst and his time."
"This beer goes down easily enough and tastes decent so I could probably have a few if squeezed for cash ($3.50 for 6 vs $4.29 for a bomber of Dead Guy). Will probably rival High Life as my cheap beer of choice."
"This was a very clean, tasty, and refreshing American macro. It may become my lawnmower beer of choice."
"Well, it's certainly no Westy 12, but served ice cold, PBR is certainly a better choice than any of the 3 major macros, and is a far better deal at 10 dollars for a case of pounders (probably since they don't have a multi-billion dollar ad budget). Though I'm certainly not going to toss away my craft beer for this, I'd certainly drink this over BudMilCo anytime."
"As two of my great uncles were master brewers at Pabst some 60 years ago and as its my great uncle Joes birthday tomorrow, he would be 122 years old, I raise this beer in his honor, even if he would turn over in his grave seeing how much it has slipped over the years, irregardless Uncle Joe this beers for you"
"The archetype for plain american macro-lager? There are no major off-flavors here, just a very simple and clean feeling brew. I will stick to Stroh's and Genny Cream when delving into the lowest castes of cheap beer, but this one is by no means something that I would feed to my sink. Much nicer than the flagships coming out of Molson, AB, Coors, or Miller."
"(I must edit here to say that I did drink another, in fact they started tasting better after the first and I ended up drinking the whole six pack. I will say that I think PBR will end up replacing Miller High Life as my cheap ""filler beer"")"
"ng"
"Light yellow color with a head the quickly dissipates into nothing. Smell is bursting with grainy maltiness and skunk. You can almost see the old guys in the ice house. A very grainy, malty flavor. No hops traces at all. This is not a very good beer. Not a good value, either, at $7.99 for a 12 pack."
"drinkability is good!"
"By far my favorite of the American ""swill"" beers. I personally try to support smaller beers in favor of bud, miller, coors, if I am going to be drinking that style. Pabst is the transparent golden color that is typical of an American macro. The taste is smooth, with a little bite at the end. Nothing particularly special about this one, but it is easy to drink and a perfect alternative to most macros if the occassion should necessitate drinking them."
"This is, hands down, the best of the american lagers. It pours a transparent yellow colour with a thick white head that quickly disipates. The taste is malty with a little graininess. I enjoy it very much. Don't let the cheap price make up your mind for you. You can't always judge a book by its cover. Pabst Blue Ribbon is the perfect beer to just kick back with."
"This is the macro lager i choose. When poored vigorously it produces a nice white head, but it quickly fades. First sip reminds you that this is a macro lager but some hop notes are present. There is not much to this beer but not much can be expected considering its price and list of ingredients. This beer is extremely consistent however, I have yet to have an off bottle despite this being a college staple for me."
"though i admit the cult following this beer has developed is annoying, it is the best tasting macro i have come across. great summertime beer when you're in the mood for something simple and refreshing. better on tap than out of the can."
"I've had to reconsider Pabst, after imbibing a bunch of macro swill as a part of my beer education it's clear that Pabst isn't so bad at all. You can actually pick up on a little zing of hops in the taste, and it doesn't smell like old pool water. I'm changing my scores for Pabst to reflect it's superiority compared to other macro brews. Definitely one of the best macros out there, if not *the* best."
"I could drink a half rack and walk home. My friends made me drink this. I'm sorry."
"Drinkable beats Budweiser any day."
"pabst blue ribbon has to be one of the best mass produced cheap beer around. There are many cheap beers out there that are just plain disgusting and horriable. pabst blue ribbion has a nicce feel to it when it, not much head to brag about. As for the flavor its not strong but its not too mild in hops and malt useage. i wouldnt pick this over a good flying fish or home brew but for $13.00 for a 30 pack this is your best bet."
"It's a mass produced lager, and it's better than most, but still not amazing."
"""Heineken? F*** that s***! We only drink AMERICAN beer! Pabst Blue Ribbon!!"""
"I have really fallen in love with this beer! I always listened to my friends bash this brew and call it the nastiest of all beers. Well when I bought a 12 pack of long neck bottles, I was impressed by the taste of this kick ass brew! It easily beats Bud, Coors, and Miller and for the price you can't go wrong at all. Give it a try, and taste a true American legend."
"PS. This is a good beer to drink with cheap hot wings while sitting in your favorite dive under the overpass or near the airport. Just watch for the effects on your gastro-intestinal system the next morning."
"This pours out of the can to a medium-large, densish, noisy, bubbly head. The beer comes out super-clear, pure gold in color. Sweeping, thin lacing. Smell is tangy, a little fruity, a little dusty. The fairly sweet front turns fruity, foamy and a little watery through the middle. Fruity with very mild toasty grains on the finish. I hallucinate cherries in the aftertaste... just a little bitter. This is an ok, light, fresh lager. Not too artifacty."
"Good drinkability, and a great lawnmower, tailgate, BBQ beer."
"The fact that its not overwhelmingly corny/ricey *which is what I expected* makes the drinkability slightly above average."
"PBR, the official swill beer of the Rose City, re-affirmed by a recent Willamette Weekly readers poll. Had a can of this, served out of an official PBR ice bucket. Poured some out to see color...it was a hazy light yellow. Smelled a little grainy, a little hoppy. Tasted OK I suppose for a swill beer, a little grainy and crisp. Not offensive. Mouthfeel was watery. It is drinkable, since it is so non-offensive. I was indifferent drinking this, but looked forward to finding a bigger brew."
"Pours a macro yellow with a white head, tastes pretty average, nothing too bad and nothing too great. At 8.99 for a case of 24 this is a bargain beer. When times are tough it hits the spot. Why pay for marketing? An old stand by that my Grandpa used to enjoy backin the 70's, and it's also the first beer I ever tried, but that's another story."
"I'm telling you PBR is great in a can and nothing else!!! I should of listened to the patrons screams!!!"
"i know it's far from being the best beer in the world (hell, most think it's far from being a good beer period) but i really do enjoy PBR. it's quite possibly the perfect simple beer. go into it not expecting much and you'll be rewarded hansomely. it's certainly better than the major macros out there. it even has some mild character to it, with hints of hoppiness and sweetness. it's clean and refreshing. what more could you want from a simple brew? make sure it's cold, cold, cold as hell (another no-no usually, but you gots to give in sometimes, right?) and enjoy."
"This does the opposite of what a beer should do, in that it makes me more thirsty! For a real beer!"
"Well, for what it is, I like it. I probably drink more of this than any other single beer, to be perfectly honest. Pale yellow, with no real scent. A very slightly hoppy taste, but not much else. Tastes fairly adjuncty (I know, that's not a real adjective), but when served cold, quenches thirst like nothing else. I have to say, it's the best macro lager around."
"Can't believe I ordered this, but had to be trashy chic like all the supermodels who are drinking this. Very light yellow transparent color, with a matching light flavor. Mostly corn coming through for me, with a bit of malt, but not much. Also some biscuity flavor hints. A bit watery. Not offensive, but not overly tasty at all. Beats the big 3, but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again."
"Drinkability: A long-lost thirst-quencher from my past. Good to have around for guests who don't care what they are drinking."
"Time to start hitting into the leftovers from the party we threw last friday. I remember seeing crushed Pabst Blue Ribbon cans at a 17000 foot pass in Tibet. In fact, PBR was definitely the most popular American beer in China (when I was there last summer). Anyways, poured a wispy straw color with a thin, cobweb-y head. Smelled of chex cereal, kinda sweet, with metallic hops. Stronger aromas than expected (not necessarily a good thing). Taste is, not surprisingly, of sweet cereal malts (maybe I should start drinking this for breakfast), fading unspectacularly into a rusty, mildly bitter finish. Not as watery as some macros, and pretty smooth going down, especially good for celebrating the installation of a new transmission on your camaro or 79 ford truck."
"Update  I originally rated this in 2003 so thought Id get a fresh 2006. The smell is definitely the worst part of this beer but otherwise its really not that bad in a white trashy kind of way. I stand by my rating: just shy of average for an Adjust Lager."
"With this beer experiencing a recent resurgence in popularity (especially around college campuses) I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Although not stellar in any department, I place this brew in the same company as Stroh's (my own cheap brew of choice in college) and Miller High Life....a step above most of what the big three macros have to offer, and a good quaffer on a hot summer day. The color is a pale straw yellow with a bright white head that disappears almost as quickly as it forms. The aroma is a bit grassy with grain and a touch of tea-like hops showing. It has a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel with an above average degree of carbonation. Grain dominates the flavor but the hops are noticeable, although more would be nice. A bit of lightly sweet malt peeks through. The best thing about this brew compared to its macro brethren is a noticeably lower quotient of adjuncts."
"I first met PBR in high school. Although she wasn't my #1, she was my #1 when I was running low on $. For the money, this is as good as it gets. What else is in your neighborhood for the price? Natural Light, Milkwaukee's Best, Schlitz, etc.? One can't go wrong with the Ribbon, as it is enjoyed by everyone from jocks to punks to hillibillies. I hung out with a few guys who used to live across the street from a beer distributor in Pittsburgh. They would buy a few cases of pbr in the afternoon, drink them until they were gone/ it became dark, and then return to the distributor to pick up a few kegs of pbr. People love this beer. Anyway, enough reminiscing. I got a case the other day. The beer is somewhat thin, and has a certain sweetness to it. There are actually floral notes present which is something unheard of for cheap macros. The hopfeel is there, but you really have to have a palette to find it. The beer goes down smoothly and finsihes sweetly carbonated. I dont know what else to say about it. It's Pabst Blue Ribbon, It's an American beer that's not as bad as you would expect, and its cheap and loveable. Good to have on hand for barbeques and parties. My fave cheapo by far."
"It drinks too soft and there is not much body. It has a better feel and flavor than many other macros out there but I do not get why it became a cult classic retro brew the last couple of years. I do have to say it is a lager I could enjoy served chilled on a hot day when an ale is just too much."
"This beer has turned into a cult favorite with the college students. I thought what the heck. My wife like it. Pours yellow, hard to get much head on it. A little sweet tasting with some hops. Not that bad. Easy to slam several down when you're used to drinking 8% beer all the time."
"While I wasn't impressed with this beer, I can honestly say it wasn't the worst beer ever. If you want tasteless yellow carbonation then go for it. I think the reason I can't say it was the worst ever, is that while it had no flavor, it also didn't have any strange off-tastes."
"I can't really put my finger on it, but there is something off with this beer. The taste is just odd, and I can't exactly say why. It is not as rough going down as say, natural ice, but it is a far cry from most other pilsner beers. I picked it for two reasons. One, I wanted to get another review under my belt. Two, it's cheap. 11 dollars for a 30 pack is a good deal, but I would drink strohs first."
"12 oz bottle. What can I say, this poured a straw yellow color with no head to speak of. Typical aroma for a macro. As is the taste. Just another fizzy yellow beer. I didn't like this beer when I first had it as a teenager, and I figured I would try it again. Well it hasn't gotten any better."
"Pabst is a great cheap lager. Nothing at all fancy about it, but the flavor is smooth and satisfying. $1 cans of Pabst used to be available (and still might be) at the BBC on North Ave for their Tuesday Burger specials. It's a fitting beer to consume with bar food or just to have on a hot day. A welcomed guest at any backyard summer BBQ."
"One of this countries stellar cheap and good mass produced brews. The can ssssuuuuckssss-but, in the bottle, this fella can do you proud-especially if on a budget. The only problem is if you drink more than three, get ready for a headache that will take you back to high school in a hurry! Worth a retry, but I'm not going to strain to come up with more info as I think the beer would get mad at me."
"very drinkable cheapo beer. won't ruin your tastebuds or wallet. now as for the trendiness....go figure."
"I was alittle short on cash, so I found a canned sixer for $3.29. I also liked the red-white-&-blue history of this brew, meaning its been around forever. It poured a pale yellow clear straw color with a white head that in some of cans disappeared to not even a film. Carbonation was not overdone, not fizzy. The taste was mild or bland. Not much in hop or malt taste to say anything overpowered this brew. It wasn't as crisp as I would like for a july lawnmower brew. Mouthfeel was not left to dry. Over-all an easy drink if you like a light body brew."
"this beer is cheap. dirt cheap. whenever i go skating, to the sand dunes, or i am doing yard work this is my beer. it tastes damn good, is light and crisp and is easy on the wallet. great for beating the las vegas heat and a great way to wash down bbq."
"This brew poured a small head of quickly disappearing fine to large sized white bubbles and a carbonated straw yellow body. It has a mild malt-hop aroma with a mild fizzy flavor of wheat and bread. It was smooth initially and had a lingering slightly bitter aftertaste."
"When poured, this beer had a small white head that consisted of small bubbles that quickly diminished. There was good lacing with this brew and the body was clear and yellow in hue. It had a light malty aroma to it and it was bitter tasting from start to finish. This beer definitely lacks character as there is nothing special that I have to say about it."
"I honestly believe this is a step above most macros. I know PBR has all the retro-hype going for it these days, but we used to drink this because it was the best inexpensive beer money could buy. Good, and at this price that's all you can expect."
"This is a macro beer. That being said, its a pretty damn good one. Its a pale gold color, a bit of a head that goes away after a bit. There isnt much to the taste of this one, which is why it is one of my favorite macros, the lack of the shit taste is definately appealing. A nice beer to catch a buzz or more with."
"This is a really good beer when you wanting something cheap and okay. I recently went to a bar and this was better than Bud Light. It's one of the easier beers to drink. It goes down in a smooth taste, but that is about it. There is not much else to go home about with this beer."
"I just graduated from college, where there was an occasional need for a cheap session beer. Now that I'm out in the real world with no money, I will still stay loyal to good old PBR when I can't get my hands on a quality craft beer."
"Not a bad beer. I love drinkng it on a sunny day, while I am BBQ. I'm sure it would be nice to go spend more money on some IPA or something light but for the money this is a pretty good beer. Light and crisp taste with a almost citrus hint to it. Low on hops but who wants a really hoppy pilsner. As far as american pilsner go I would rank this in the top 3 for macrobreweries. Best enjoyed on a hot summer day while lounging in the sun."
"This beer has a legacy and it's too bad I was never able to experience the *real* Pabst Blue Ribbon. I've driven by the Pabst brewery a few times and it's quite a sight seeing those two big brass orbs from the highway. But hell, I gotta be honest and say that PBR was a disappointment. I could probably drink a case of this beer but that's only because the taste was 100% acceptable but 0% cherishable. I wanted a new favorite cheap beer but instead was struck with the startling realization: 'Soylent Green is people!'"
"I really like this beer...It pours like you would expect from a $4.50 dollar 6er of big boys. A Very mild head and smell. Not too pleasing but certainly not offensive. Its drinkability is good, easily can put down the 6 pk no problem. The aftertaste is average. For the price, this beer is good.."
"This beer poured a very light, clear yellow. The head was fair and not long lasting. I had not had a PBR in years and thought it would be a nice walk down memory lane. The beer had little aroma and less flavor. About a third of the way through the glass, I spiced it up with several shakes from the salt shaker. After doctoring the beer, the taste improved slightly. It makes a good beer to eat pizza or maybe a burger, but not for stand alone enjoyment."
"Pours out with a decent-sized white head over very pale gold liquid. Nose is stereotypically ""adjuncty", mainly corn, with a light, light, light wisp o' malt & slight grass. Taste is alright for a cheap macro, decent mouthfeel with notes of light malt sweetness and a brief swirl of hop bitterness. Finishes with a quick fruity note, very slight dryness. There, I've done it! Nice ""lawnmower"" brew, but given the choice I'd cough up the extra sawbuck for a sixer of Ballantine XXX."
"I heard that this was the beer of choice at my school, so I gave it a shot and bought a case for $8.99. From the can, the PBR poured a pale golden yellow. The originally fluffy head disappeared pretty quickly, and the beer looked painfully macro-bland. The smell was of adjunct (corn, I think), but with a tiny hint of malt. Still, not much happening. The taste really wasn't too shabby, though. Refreshing, with a pleasant malt taste and a small sample of hops. The mouthfeel was perhaps a bit gritty on the tongue, but overall pretty clean and smooth. For a cheap beer, this isn't bad. I have to give the frat guys at school more credit. Among the cheapies, PBR gets my vote."
"This thinly malted light lager gets most of its elevated status as result of Hollywood created propaganda. This rest of its reputation is based on the fact that, even though it's cheap swill, it's pretty decent cheap swill. Pale gold with a thin white head and fast fading lace. The aroma is pretty bland and smells like American beer poured from a can...oh yeah it was. Medium hops with a slight metallic bite and some citrus bitterness. Theres something cool about Pabst. Truly an original! Try Pabst in a bar bottle  forget the can!"
"Poured out a bubbly clear pale yellow color with a small white head. I wasn't expecting much from this one, but I was surprised to say that it was a well blended and smooth light pale lager. Does not have the harshness of a Bud or a Miller. Slightly hoppy and grainy. Drinkable and not that bad at all."
"Enjoy!"
"NOTE: PBR is the official beer of geologists."
"Yeah, at 12.50 for a 30 pack of cans it's hard to beat this for a lawnmower macroswill selection. I prefer the bottles in overall taste, but poured out of the can this one has a very smooth creamy mouthfeel. Fizzy yellow with a frothy white going on, this beer is designed for people like me. In college and broke, so as far as aroma goes it's has a cereal grain adjunct based aroma but it's actually not that bad kind of pleasant in fact. I can definitely get down with this beer, for it's taste, price, and flavor can't go wrong. Taste is sweet with some balancing hop bitterness to create one of the best shittiest beers in the world. An American classic that is designed to be drank in high capacity."
"Not usually the beer I drink, but I would choose it over Bud, Coors, Miller, etc. in a heart-beat. Hadn't tasted it until now. Picked up a six-pack because the recent resurgence of it's popularity peaked my interest. Hard to find out here in the Phoenix area, though."
"Red, white and blue. You can't go wrong."
"PBR, the king of mass-produced swill. Appearance is nothing out of the ordinary for a pale lager - golden color, white head that disappears quickly leaving the faintest of lace on the surface of the beer. But the smell... hmm that's different. An American macrobrew with hops? Say it isn't so! The taste is very crisp, very clear; sharp and biting on the tongue, mellowing afterwards. A little grainy, but nowhere near Miller's grainy taste. It's not much, but it's cheap, and it beats anything A-B can put out for generic swill."
"This is definitely btb. The old Pabst quality is still here and still wining friends for the formula. While it is still in the class of mainstream lagers, it is a cut above many others. Inviting appearance but with a quickly departing white head. The taste is full-bodied and has a bit of corn added, but the hops cut into the sweetness. This is a thirst style lager that is still a ""go to"" in many markets."
"Presentation, the classic 12 ounce can with the recognizable Pabst Blue Ribbon logo. Pours a faint yellow, thin head which quickly disappears. Slight husky and corn aroma, but was very difficult to detect. A little malt and somewhat of a grassy or hay taste. Very light body. Pleasant to drink based on the undetectable adjuncts, I won't let the six pack go to waste, but still only slightly above average. PBR is difficult to find in eastern S.D., no joke!"
"well, after hearing how people liked this beer compared to the other big macro's I thought I would give it a try. At first it looked like any other macro beer, little smell, very bubbly. When i first tasted it I thought, this tastes like every average light beer, however my mind changed after it got a little air and warmed slightly. Suddenly i could taste some light malt, and a slight wheat flavor, it is more complex than most macro's. While this is still not a terrific beer, it is amazing for the price. $6.50 for a 12pk, pretty cheap. Even if it was the same price as bud, or bud light, i would probably still buy it over those. It has better character. Overall, its not really anything special, but quite good for a cheap macro beer."
"24 oz. 2x4 can, pours a bright clear golden-yellow color, has a decent foamy white head that doesn't last long, light grainy aromas. Starts with a light dry grainy flavor, finishes clean with a little sweetness, not much aftertaste. I have to admit PBR maybe the best american macro I have ever had, a well spent .99 cents."
"F."
"Feels grat and is very drinkable as a result..all in all a good American lager..no frills but beware in my opinion its far better this way ( in the bottle) than in the can."
"If you haven't had a Pabst, please withhold judgement until you tried it."
"A very good budget beer. Smooth state, and highly drinkable. It pours out a short head that disappears in very short time. Overall i would much rather have this than a Bud or Coors. Something about this beer simply has more to offer than many others that are higher priced."
"Okay I couldn't resist. Betty's, which had nothing but craft beers on tap, decided to add this beer as their one macro. It was a straw color and had a very small white head. A medium amount of carbonation was present. Had a slight hop aroma, but the major aroma was of grain. The flavor was also of grain. Had a slight bit of bite to the finish. Much better beer on tap than Budweiser or Miller. Probably why Betty's picked it."
"Taste = sweet, malt balanced pretty well with the hops. Big flavor for an inexpensive American lager, filling, a 'chewy' mouthfeel, semi-creamy. Sweet = my main impression, with some hoppy bitterness on the short finish."
"I am in agreement with other BAs that this beer, while not especially good, is certainly no worse than many common, heavily advertised mainstream lagers, American or otherwise. Why pay more, if this is what you want to drink? (Didn't a character from David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" emphasize this point about PBR in rather strong terms?) Pairs well with cheap Mexican food."
"PBR pours a white head over a crystal clear pale yellow beer but unfortuntly it all goes downhill from here. This beer has a mild skunky smell but hardly any aroma at all. It's taste is nonexistent and it's body thin. It's only saving grace is that you can drink it like water. If I paid more than the 25 cents a beer I would have felt ripped off. But at that price I guess I can't complain."
"This was quite enjoyable for such a cheap beer. I call this a ""working on the car/truck"" type of beer. I think it would pair well with BBQ food or corn chips. Along with Stroh's, Pabst makes two cheap beers that are quite consumable."
"Pabst on tap!!!!! What more can I say, well actually a lot. This beer is really cheap and fairly good, especially for the price. Can you beat $1 a glass? I think not! Anyways, back to the good stuff! Has real light color and real light taste. You can definately tast the malt in it, but it doesn't ruin the flavor. Also nice on the tastebuds. It's definately not some beer made by monks in France, but it's worth buying, especially if your poor or in college. Like most beers, it's better on tap."
"Easy drinking brew with questionable appearance....but seriously folks, there is no head on this beer, this little critter is bald. Having said that, taste is well rounded, tad malty sweetness, no lingering after taste...medium body that promotes session awareness."
"I finally broke down and purchased my first Pabst Blue Ribbon tonight. I've been scared to death of this beer, but I faced my demons and took the challenge.... This was actually a pretty good Cheap beer for the price. I rank it up there with Miller High Life. Bottom line: If you are looking for a good cheap beer that reminds you of the good old days (high school and College), this is the beer for you."
"Being poor lately I have had a chance to sample some of the cheaper beers. This is only an average brew and that even takes into account the price of it. It has a light straw color that leaves something to be desired but it does pour with a much better head than most poor man's beer and it thins out to leave a thin layer and leaves minimal lace. The taste is very decent with nice malty flavor. It has an aroma of corn and not much else. It has a smooth mouthfeel that goes down very easy. I barely enjoyed this beer but found it to be drinkable but there are still many other brews that I would put in my list above this one. One thing about this beer that I really did not like was the tightness in my head that it caused that appeared after I only drank like four. I don't think I will get this one again even if I am running low on funds."
"My experience with the Sleeman's rendering was pleasant enough that I may buy a 6-pack or so in hot weather if my cashflow is a bit limp at the time."
"Brilliant yellow color and has a white head that melts away into a fine lace. It is laden with that familliar domestic lager aroma, a bit  of skunky adjuncts. Tastes husky at first, followed by a slight corn sweetness which is quickly cut by a brief grassy bitterness wich gives the beer a relatively dry finish. The only aftertaste to speak of is that of alcohol and wood. No malt flavor. Neither too bubbly nor thin, though. Not a particularly good beer, but not a bad beer either.  It may replace Schmidt's as my cheap domestic lager of choice."
"My favorite low grade beer. Can not beat the price. It does not have that over manufactured taste that most macros have. Smooth and easy going, a kegger favorite. Must be consumed in a plastic cup."
"I'll take this over most other macros."
"Notes: This is a great premium American lager, hands down beats the big three. About the same in the bottle but obviously better on tap. A perfect change up when things get a bit tedious and want to drink a simple beer."
"Good ole' PBR, as reliable that old pick up truck or a good dog.  PBR is my empty-wallet beer of choice as I can get a case of 16oz 'tall gentleman' for 11.50.  It definetly beats any macro hog wash for alot less money.  Yea man i know what you mean by cringing when people make jokes about it when they actually think Heinekein is a good beer; it bothers me too.  The mouthfeel is a lil watery but the carbonation evens it out so that it is not a detriment to enjoying it.  The taste is balanced, a slight hoppy grain and lightly malted.  It a very drinkable beer, as it's balance, realtive lightness, and cost doesn't inhibit anyone from pounding them out."
"Pours translucent light gold, with a pretty impressive white foam.  The foam dissapates and leaves a lace around the glass.  Smell leaves something to be desired... mostly corn adjuncts, and a tiny bit of malt.  Taste is actually somewhat complex... corn, malt, a little fruity flavor... no hops to speak of.  Has a thin mouthfeel, as one would expect, with high carbonation.  Not a bad choice if you need a $3 six pack... and better than most American Macro Lagers."
"Pours exceptionally well, is a pale yellow with a creamy white head that lasts amazingly long for the style and actually leaves some lace down the glass. The aroma is definitely the weak point of this brew. It is better than most with a slightly corn and adjunct smell but still not all that great of a smell. Taste is great for the style with its incredibly creamy and smooth sweetness/slight fruitiness? and fairly crisp mouthfeel the brew is very drinkable and an absolute pleasure compared to the other macros and even compared to a lot of cheap brew, you really can't get any better for the price, at $9 a case it is a steal."
"Ultra pale yellow tinge, ultra translucent with a head that reached about ¼ inch before it dissipated, soapy retention, very sporadic and spotty lace (it is not very much to look at). Sweetish nose, adjuncts would seem to be influential. Honestly, it isnt very inviting. The taste is slightly sweet, malt is very much noticeable, vague influence of adjuncts. The mildest/lightest hops influence. The palate is decent, it can warm (to a degree) and it doesnt have to be served ice-cold. Moderate carbonation and medium body. Very drinkable, there always seems to be a time and a place for some PBR. It is just too cheap not to drink ($3.80 for a 6-pack)."
"This is a great fridge stocker and you can't beat the price."
"PBR leaves a pleasant bitter hops aftertaste that says put more PBR in please."
"I must admit, I really wanted to dislike this beer going in, but it wasn't that bad. As a matter of fact, it was decent. Pours out to a bright golden color with a fluffly white head. Smell is somewhat funky, almost chemical, but the actual taste has some hints of caramel and a very slight hop bitterness. Seeing as Pabst brews this and Schlitz, I can see why they taste similar. I could swear they were the same beer, with very subtle differences. Am American classic? That might be stretching it. Drinkable? Yes. And no different than most American Standard lagers. Rock on PBR..."
"This beer is drinkable and that is about all I can say about it.  I absolutely despise the mass produced garbage that is made in this country but for some reason, I can always tolerate a little PBR.  Stranger things have happened."
"I don't know.... this has been reviewed a lot here and a lot seem to like it, but I just don't know.  Very boring IMHO.  Simple, easy, almost like your not having a beer at all.  Take a big sip, swallow, and its like ""Did I just take a sip of beer or was that I day dream.""   It is cheap for sure and when I bought it it was like 90 degrees and I had a bunch of beer sitting in the cellar that was'nt very cold and I just needed some cold damn beer so I figured $10.99, what the hell!!  OK I guess, I don't know.........."
"Had always heard of this beer growing up but never tried one, figured it for lawnmower beer.  Even though I would not choose it again if I had better choices, it wasn't as bad as I thought.  Very light in color and the smell is really the only drawback.  Better than most of the beers we see all the time on tv.............CHEERS"
"Sampled straight from the can.  How else are you supposed to drink a PBR?  This beer is no better or worse than any other macro American light lager, but it has a serious advantage of being $2.69 a six.  The only problem with it is that holding a can of it makes you want to have sex with your cousin."
"Beer my grandpa and uncle used to drink, swill, or pound (it was, and still is cheeep).  PBR is the brew I was weened on (used to steal a sip when i was just a wee lad). Pabst has a unique flavor, which actually has a slight hop after taste. I have been a fan of this beer for many years despite its shortcomings.  However it is a gem compared to others in its price class..  Can you blame me for trying other types of beer?"
"I'm going to rate this beer in context to Schlitz, mainly because they are similiar beers and I really have trouble finding stuff to rate about these kinds of beers because they are so simple it's hard to describe them. While I found the Schlitz to possess both more hop flavors (grassy)than any other common macro I can think of, the PBR was much less bitter. The Schlitz was also metallic tasting (the grassy hops meshing with another flavor perhaps?) and the PBR lacked this. The PBR is a bit sweeter than the Schlitz, but still remains crisp. It doesn't even become undrinkable cold. Too bad typical beer swillers think this beer is below them. It really is a good cheap beer. That being said, the only times I'll be likely to buy this is for times when I'm not looking to really enjoy the beer, but looking for something that goes down easily and provides some social lubrication."
"Pours a very light pale yellow and is very clear.  It has a soapy type head that dissipates fairly quickly.  The smell is very faint and slightly sweet.  The creamy mouthfeel is well above all the other big macro brews. The taste is fair with no off tastes at all.  Just  lacking in distinct character.  There are actually slight hints of hops in this brew.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find it in bottles, so I had to pour mine out of a can. Very drinkable!  Cheap Cheers!"
"Light straw with thick big bubbled head. Quick to disappate.  Smells sweet with noticible adjunct smell.   Tastes smooth and somewhat sweet with a smooth drinkable mothfeel.  Goes down clean and refreshing.  Moderate carbonation adds to this fine macro lager.  Surprisingly good."
"I was curious about a better-tasting macro lager, so here I am...Pale and clear yellow, head is not stiff and has little staying power. Just a bit of a malty smell. Its pretty pleasant in flavor, not overcarbonated, hops short-lasting but not ""in-and-out"". Malt is sweet if non-descript but there's OK balance here. Doesn't finish with an un-settling impression in my stomach. Well, PBRs are more or less drinkable in a pinch, but its no undiscovered miracle. Thanks to Michael P. for buying a twelve pack and his sister Liza P. for bringing me a can."
"3.0/3.0/3.0/3.0/3.0"
"For a standard American beer, this stuff isn't all that bad. There is nothing bad I can really say, yet nothing good either. The ""plain jane"" of all beers."
"The best American macro lager.  It has a clean taste, with good body.  It pains me to see that this classic American beer is not beating the pants off BUD.  I respectfully suggest that, when the need arises (warm weather) you find it in long neck bottles, chilled down cold, and enjoy.  Please tell your establishment to buy it, now, before it's too late."
"Now....On to this Beer...PBR is a better beer than most people give it credit for being.  This was my dad's beer back in the 70's.  The first thing that impressed me when I sat down to grade it was the aroma..For a basic American Lager the smell is inviting.  About the perfect body/character for its style...Not a lot of maltiness(nowhere close to High Life)..a bit of a dry finish...a tich of hops evident but not as heavy as Strohs..jvery smooth though and creamy on the back of the tounge...just a basic solid version of an American Lager.  I plan on doing a blind taste test between this and High Life (the only other Macro I have around the house )...I like High Life better but believe it or not PBR is one of the better American lagers out there in my opinion."
"i would have to agree that PBR is a solid american lager that exceeds expectations in all categories. better than bud, MGD, michelob, coors, etc. and in my book battles high life for best american macro. it has a pleasant, kind of a floral hop aroma. relatively full bodied, a bit sweet, and a grainy, grassy flavor with a smooth creamy mouthfeel that allows it slide down like silk. nothing special, but nothing bad...which is GOOD!"
"Pretty tart at the beginning and then vanishes, other than a lingering alcohol bitterness, which is the primary flavoring agent.  PBR was the first beer I had, back in the stone age, and I drank a good bit of it in those days.  Ah, the folly of youth."
