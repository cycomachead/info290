"Brew pours a clear straw-yellow in color with a thin white cap. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of some grassy grains with a light hint of corn. Pretty much the same is said for the taste as well. Lighter-bodied with above average carbonation, that is why all the tiny streaming bubbles. Drinkable but that is about it. Nothing special and is cheap BUT then again you get what you pay for. Typical 'American Adjunct Lager' brew actually with some better than others. Not my type of brew style."
"A good backyard bbq/party beer."
"Really not very good. I think rating for look and feel is BS so I give them all 5's."

"Grew up on this shitty beer and will always drink it because it gets the job done."
"My NY cheap beer of choice. Never tasted that good but proud to drink it."
""
"There is not much going on with this beer, but for this style of beer, it is not bad. I actually enjoy it. It brings back the great memories of college, just like when you pop into a PBR!"
"DATE TASTED: January 11, 2015... GLASSWARE: Ommegang pokal... OCCASION: cataloging my beers of the year--slow-motion spread sheet fun... APPEARANCE: glittering, shimmering golden body; snow white head that frizzles swiftly; sudsy inadequate residue... AROMA: toasty, oaty malts that pluck the nostrils; a secondary biscuit and sweet malts; slightly pungent finish... PALATE: oily, slightly effervescent; overall, a clean glass-emptying kind of lager ...TASTE: sweet, corny and grainy, with a malty base; not very balanced, with the ping that suggests a 40 oz.... OVERALL: when it was 36 cans for $10 (with a $5 mail-in rebate), it was a winner; now, its primary function is lining the top part of my beer fridge to keep its coldness; a mostly tolerable, predictable, unimpressive lager that only goes well after a few better beers have been consumed..."

"Not a bad beer at all. These big dogs are $1.50 at the local gas station. It's not a fancy brew, but as low end lagers goes, I am quite fond. It's crisp, with a slight frutiness and subtle crackery sweetness. Nil bitterness. No hops. It's the kind of beer you drink when you just want a plain ol beer. Style wise, when compared to it's peers, it's certainly the best among them. I'll take this any day if my options are Bud, Miller or Coors."

"I was afraid this would be like the Silver Stallion I once encountered at the same place, but this was a decent, no-frills macro-style lager. Unlike other beer “finds” in such stores, this didn’t appear to have been sitting on a shelf for a long time, and was pretty drinkable for what it was. By no means was this something I’d tell someone to seek out, as it’s pretty interchangeable for many other, similar, beers, but for the same price I’d buy it again."

"O - Good session beer. It's a bit like Budweiser, except this tastes like a real beer. This would be a great lawnmower beer if I had lawn."

"O:Pretty typical AAL a good choice because its cheaper then most"

"Pours beautifully. Straw colored golden with a fat white head that fell fast and left splotchy lacing. Brilliant clarity . You could read through it. Lots of bubbles streaming up to the top./ Nose is faint light grain and a touch of cooked corn. A bit of hop herbal and perfectly clean. No fruity esters whatsoever. Just lovely. Taste is crisp with some firm carbonation. Light sweet grain, cooked corn that is sweet and delicious. There is a touch of mineral or metallic on the palate but it's from the water. This finishes dry and with a nice little bitter to tease you into more and more. Light smooth mouthfeel and you could drink this beer all day. Nothing wrong with it at all but it is thin and develops a watery quality as it warms. It also gains a bit of sour taste from the combined grains as ti warms."
"I would buy this brew again."
""
""
"O - This is a great hot day beer. Considering what it is it isn't too bad. I'll take a Cream Ale or 12 Horse over a Genesee Beer but I won't turn one down if it's all there is."

"Overall meh, as expected for adjunct lager but not as bad as the off flavors are not overpowering."
""
""
"This is a great little adjunct lager....for an adjunct lager. I'm going to go ahead and rate it within its style because why not. It's very very smooth, inoffensive, and has a supremely pleasant mouthfeel to it while delivering a desirable taste. It's got all the basics. The basics that you'd think are the bare minimum for a beer, but many of the most popular brands seem to almost TRY to sink below that. This, however, is a great go-to inoffensive lager. I can honestly say I enjoyed it. The extremely light colour worried me at first, but the lacing on my glass mug was decent and it had more taste than it looked like it would. I made a good choice by giving this a try."

"Overall with the brewery right up the road this is one cheap brew thats fresh and cold. Beats most of the other adjuncts out there in flavor."

"Poured on-tap and served in a nonic, the beer is a pale goldenrod coloring with a ton of carbonation bubbling and a tall, frothy, light, white head that settles into a filmy coating. Clingy all over the glass. Aromas of toasted grains and not much else...a bit musty and stale. Flavors of roast, with a buttery backbone and corn overtones. Bleh. Roasty and stale aftertaste with a quick, uneventful finish. Not good."

"You will find that trying to session this beer will be difficult. The pints are cheap, so its worth a try at a minimum. Thanks."
"O- Genny is an easy to drink, tasty session beer. IMO it has a nicer flavor profile than BMC. It is a lot more full bodied than BMC and is a great alternative to the large nat'l brewery offerings. I forgot to mention that it is really cheap....please don't let that turn you off from buying it! You won 't be disappointed. Just remember what style of beer it is!"

""
""
"From my rating book back in 1984. poured to a golden color, was clear in appearance and did not develop much of a head. Aroma was fruity and somewhat stale. Taste was sweet and on the bland side. Aftertaste was mild. Reminded me of a weaker, lighter version of Genesee Cream Ale."
""
"For the style it's not a bad beer. I'd entertain drinking this if I had something productive to do on a summer afternoon. Descent flavor and low ABV."

"Oh - Get your favorite aspirin or headache medicine ready, The Hangover from this beer is nasty..."
""
""
""
"It tastes of corn, grain, about even with sweet and bitter..both lightly done. Easy drinking, for sure while it's cold, not so much as it warms up. A decent brew to have on a hot day but so are MANY others and there's the odd one that excels. I like their Cream Ale more."

"I would choose this any day over your standard bud/bud lite, coors lite swill. If your in the mood for beer but are on a budget, it would not be a bad choice to grab a few of these."
""
""
""
""
""
"Its too sweet and has too little hops. Its your typical not very good American lager. If you drink it with a good beer aftertaste already in your mouth this will ruin it. Tastes better if a little of any other beer is left in the glass before pouring in the genny. Me and jenny were like peas and carrots."
"Got this as a gag extra, i'm gagging but kind of enjoyed the experience. It was a bit funky with some more sweetness than a BMC. I don't really know how to describe this other than a funky BMC. The mouthfeel is quite carbonated and left quite a weird sour aftertaste. I'm just kind of confused."
""
"An anemic yellow colored brew with a decent white head that quickly shrivels to a scant breath of head and lacing seems generally absent. The aroma indicates classic cereal grains with an accent on wheat and an inference of some light lemon. Not all that bad if you’re thinking in terms of light and refreshing. The flavor brings out somewhat watery citrus wheat. More cereal grain and It’s not offensive in my estimation, but it’s clearly a drinker for the driveway and burgers, a light refresher with a peppery idea that is aided by a lively, fine carbonation. But it is light bodied and other than the carbonation it’s pretty much watery stuff. It’s a standard cereal brew and it’s fine to pound these with the boys but clearly it leaves a lot to be desired if you want to truly enjoy a tasty beer. Then again, I think it would be un-American to be without some of these traditional lagers that can go down like....well....water."
"O-What you would expect from a adjunct, but honestly genny is my go to cheap beer. Much rather have any genny beer before miller or coors."
""
""
""
""
"Poured extremely vigorously into a snifter, achieving a finger of white head, zero beading. Smells like a grain belt- corn, lots of corn, a bit of sugar, nothing exciting at all. Tastes like some beer that someone forgot about back in July. I wouldn't offer this beer to my worst enemy... seriously. This sucks. All beer biases aside this one tastes like I shouldn't have tasted it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Like most adjunct lagers that i've had, it's isn't particularly bad tasting or offensive, it's just not what beer should be and definitely not something i would pick up."
""
""
""
""
"I know this isn't any good, but I kind of dig it anyway. Maybe all those kegs of this hillbilly juice in my youth inoculated me against its fairly noxious taste. I'm not proud of it, but I can drink this all day long."
"O - Not very good, but what do you expect? Rochester represent. If you want great beer from Rochester try Three Heads."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink but best when served extremely cold. Would be a great beer for sitting out fishing on a hot summer afternoon."
"O: It's not the worst beer ever. In fact, I could drink a few of these cans at a BBQ on a hot summer day to quench my thirst. American Adjunct Lagers have their place."
""
""
"If you want to experience some of the finer brews this brewery has to offer, go for Dundee. Dundee beers are actually pretty good, comparable to craft beers, especially surprising given that this is their flagship."
""
""
"O-In western NY, Genny is not as beloved as some other regional breweries are around the country, but for $3.99 for a 6 of pounders, its not awful, better than most things from BMC...."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being below average for the style. Overall it's not bad for the style, but it's not very good either. There just wasn't much to it. It doesn't compare unfavorably to the BMC's of the world though. I much prefer their Cream Ale myself though."
""
"Light bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is definitely one you could toss back and finish in a matter of minutes. The body is about average for an AAL, which increases the drinkability while decreasing the flavor profile. The carbonation is actually rather weak for an AAL and is barely fizzy."
""
"Overall I am quite surprised by this beer. It is pretty tasty with no off flavors and has some hoppyness. Would be excellent on a hot day. One of the better AAL's."
""
""
"O - Ugh. Drain pour to the max, this beer is just not good at all. Gross in flavor and nose, I would most definitely not want to experience this one again."
""
"O- I don't usually mind Genesee brews too much but this one wasn't for me."
"I picked up the Heritage 12 Pack today of Genesse today at Portchester Beer Dist. (great Place to go to get Beer) Now the Heritage 12 Pack comes with the Cream Ale and the 12 Horse Ale as well. The Beer is good better than some of the other Adjunct American Lagers and Better than Pabst. It dosen't really have a taste to it but most American Adjunct lagers but its a little bit Sweeter in taste . Overall its worth Trying ."
"Overall - Average for a standard american lager. At only ~$8 for a 12 pack it is worth the price. A good beer for tailgating and massive parties where you don't know and don't care to know most of the people there."
"I can't say I won't have some of this around for nipping at when I'm workin' around the place."
""
"Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF 6. It pours a clear golden straw topped by an active finger of white foam.The nose comes off as kinda adjunct lager-ly, what with light corn, lighter wheat, and dank-ish grass coming through. A small tinge of what seems like nutmeg hangs in the background all wallflowerly and whatnot.The taste runs pretty much the same as the smell, but without that spice tinge. There's a flowery crispness to the finish.The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, I can't say as I truly dislike it...I think I nothing it..."
""
""
"o: not a bad beer. will keep some of this in stock for the ones in my life that dont like alot of flavor in their beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely a drinkable beer. You could put away a lot of these. Ultimately, however, if you're looking for flavor and intricacies go elsewhere."
""
"O: For an adjunct lager, it's not the worst I've had. As long as this beer is ice cold, it can stand up against its brothers."
""
""
""
"O: I like some AAL, a lot, this is terrible. Point blank bad. No nose, no flavor and no body."
""
"Notes: This is an average cheap blue collar/retro beer and one that I have had many of."
""
""
""
"I will never let this beer touch my lips again. The last time I drank Gensee was at the Phish festival in Watkins Glen this past summer. Let's just say that they probably had to hose down the porti-poti after I was through with it. I will never forgive this brewery for the state I was in that day."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's a Genny, man. What did you expect?"
"Not bad, but I've had better drinking beers."
"Notes: Pretty typical adjunct lager. Not overly sweet but the flavors aren't great. Nose is weak. It's cheap and not horrible so I will get it for nights when I need something like that. Overall just what you would expect from a cheap 30 pack of cans."
"O: Not bad for a cheap lager, pretty comparable to others in the category. With Genesee, definitely go for the cream ale or bock over this one."
"O: The beer is easy to drink but I wouldn’t consider it to be very flavorful or refreshing."
"basic beer good any time you need a change of pace."
"Clear pale straw yellow color, with white foamy but, short lasting head. Very bubbly. Very spotty lacing of glass. Taste is a bit watery, crisp,somewhat bland, neither hoppy nor sweet. Corn flavor is apparent. Really disappointing, considering that their Cream Ale is to die for!"
"Overall – I though this was actually pretty good for the style. It had a nice scent and the taste was pretty well balanced. Also it is priced very reasonably."
"Reviewed from notes. Reviewed here for the first time after many tastings over the years. Poured from 16oz tall boy into dimpled glass mug for the purposes of this review as I normally just enjoy it from the can. Pours a straw colored yellow with strong carbonation and a good amount of head topping about an inch in height. Obvious smell of corn and sweet sourdough and tastes about the same although not as sweet as PBR and does have a little bitter hop in the the finish just enough to leave an after taste though nothing to offend as this beer is made for sessions and hot afternoons. Better then the BMC stuff IMO and dirt cheap at $3.99 for a sixer of tall boys in these parts or $13.99 for a 30 pack."
"O/D: Easy to drink, the flavor is better than BMC products. Might get sick of them, but the price is right."
"Look, this beer is what it is. It's .99 for a 24 oz can and it beats the crap out of Bud, Bud Light, MGD, Coors Light, Miller Light or the ilk. It reminds me of the great old Midwestern AAL's like Schlitz or Blatz before they went to hell. It's not as good as Coor's Banquet, but it's half the price. Bottom line, it's cheap, but not shitty. Go Genesee Beer!"
"O-The best commercially produced adjunct filled beer out there. But still not that tasty when compared to some real beers."
"Overall Im very pleased, and find this a very easy beer to drink! No bad aftertaste even after having several of them. If your`e on a tight budget, and cant always afford a craft beer, definitely give Genesee beer a go!! You just cant go wrong for 13.99 for a 30 pack!!"
"Overall, it looks like an AAL, smells like an AAL, but tastes a little better than one. I personally like a nice change up for IPAs and Belgian ales now and then, so I'd go for this again."
"Notes: 14 years in Rochester and this is my 1st Genny! This easily beats any BMC product."
"Overall I was kind of surprised by this one, but boy it is WAY too sweet, but I can't complain much you could do considerably worse."
"I am drinking this hobo-style out of a big-ass can, replete with paper bag and all, and so I cannot precisely say what it looks like, so I'll grant it a score of average. If the look is like the aroma, then an 'average' score is generous. It smells like bad cheap beer, sickly sweet grain and corn, alcohol and sweat socks, but perhaps there is a nostalgic element related to that ungodly combo that renders it better than horrible. The flavor is more in-your-face bad, with the same elements of cheap alcohol, corn and adjunct, dirty grain and sweat. The feel is about average. Overall this is pretty bad stuff."
"O: This is an old-timers brew that is extremely dirt cheap. For the price I would rather have it over Bud, Miller, or Coors. It is everything I expected it to be. Bland, vapid, and overly generic. The can even looks generic, like something out of an old health book that is just a white can with black print that reads: BEER! I think we could all use a little more Genesee every now and again."
"BTW, the minimalist can design is a stroke of genius. This will appeal to the good old boys and the hip urban dwellers who love retro stuff. Good thinking, Genesee."
"Golden and sudsy with lots of carbonation. Not much aroma to speak of. Smells of sugary vegetable and grain. Flavor is candied grains; has a roasted vegetable aftertaste. Good flavor for this style and it gets the job done without draining your wallet."
"Overall: It's a cheap AAL. Not the worst choice, especially for the price. On a side note, the can design has to be one of the worst I've ever seen."
"Pours a clear piss colored light yellow, with bubbly 2 finger head. Smells of grain, cornmeal, boiling water, stale, fizz? is fizz a scent?, but also has gentle citrusy lemon on top of the sweet malt. Exactly what an AAL should smell like. ""It tastes like fucking water"" screams a man in the crowd. Im not sure water is a taste, but it sure is watered down. Sour grains, sweet lager malts, slightly offensive on the after taste. Light to absent in body and feel. For an AAL i guess this is ok...but will undoubtably be the last time it touches my lips... what was i thinking??"
"A little dirty, but the cheapest thing I can find now since the gouging went into full effect."
"Overall I will never, ever purchase this again. I'm angry I wasted my money on a 6er of it. It was so bad. The worse beer, I can say that I have ever had. This beer has a C rating on here, but I would not recommend it to anyone. I would take any American Adjunct/Light beer over this any day."
"Big cheap ass can from ""Habits"" S.Salem. 99 cents Not even gonna pour this..the can is different than the one showing..simple Red Genesee logo on white. Aroma from the can is typical cheap corn lager. Taste is again corn, slightly sweet and semi dry . To be honest not the worst mouthfeel for this type of beer. Nothing greaqt or even good but not horrible."
"O - I had high hopes, but they were quickly dashed."
"O: Picked up for $0.93 per 24oz can, which now boasts the retro logo. I have downed plenty of these brews in my days at RIT, but was excited to see it down here in FL. Better than many others within the style, but still corny."
"O - better than a lot of other beers of the same style."
"The good ol' Genny. This was the first and only time I've had Genny Beer. I've had their other brews on other occasions. This beer was poured from a can into a glass at a steady pace. The head billowed and settled to a tiny ring around the glass. The beer smelled much like it tasted. Kinda on te sweet side but had enough bitter to keep it balenced."
"Drinkability: So far so good. I mean I think i'd rather have this over a bunch of other brands beers of the same style."
"can't say I'd turn to this one over some of the other AALs, but at 89 cents for a 24oz can, I can't really complain. actually, yeah... i guess I can. and probably won't drink another any time soon. there's better cheap crap out there."
"D- I could drink the amount given to me."
"not bad stuff...and to all the haters: LIGHTEN UP!!!! it's only beer. not everything needs to be over the top, ridiculously malty/hoppy, high in alcohol. you get the idea. its beers like these that got me into beer to begin with. much respect."
"Enjoy with your favorite fast food meal. It fits right in."
"Any true beer lovers who wish to take a break from those hop/malt bombs shouldn't have any problems with this one."
"Drinkability is fine in part due to the 4.5% abv. Good hot weather beer. Drank this after 3 or 4 PBRs and would say this is less tasty than PBR but no bad flavors and the low abv is a plus when drinking multiples. Good beer for the style."
"Pours a nasty sticky looking straw yellow color with a thick white soapy head and no lacing. Smells of nasty hop extract and corn. Tastes of sweet corn and water. Mouthfeel is very watery with an unpleasant carbonation. Drinkability is low. A poor beer overall. Stay away."
"D - Very easy to rink, but the flavor is such that it can be a bit challenging to down a lot. Compared to most adjunct lagers, this is actually pretty good, but that doesn't really mean much. consider it akin to a ""First place loser"""
"D - for the price, this beats almost everything else it was stored near in the cooler, with the exception of Yuengling. would have again. definitely a good one to just plop some change down for and get buzz on."
"Out of a can this beer was a perfectly clear, pale golden color. The one finger of white head retained poorly and left very little lacing. The aroma was of corn and rice adjuncts on top of a pale malt background. The flavors were classic macro-lager, adjunct grains, hints of cardboard, dry and generic malt and just a touch of hops at the very end to keep it crisp. Better than Budweiser et.al. but that ain't sayin' much. Forgettable."
"If you can get it, TRY it at least ONCE.."
"Overall a Basic beer. I'll keep this on hand if only to cook with. Has a low abv. To drink i'd go with the Ice version."
"Overall, this was different than I expected. I thought it would at least taste like beer. I should have known after looking at it the flavor would be weak, but I never expected it to be this weak. I would hate to try the light version. However, it is cheap like 50 cents a can and the can is really old school."
"Drinkability: while this is a light and somewhat refreshing beer, its overall level of pleasantness is rather low. I brought this tailgating a couple of weeks ago and it was universally panned; I don't think it's all *that* bad, but it is far from my favorite cheap lager."
"Flavor is smooth yet subtle, offering a pleasant feel and an easy drink. If this beer met Bud in an alley it would kick it's Ass all over town and come up smiling.."
"D: Good for a regional lager beer. Can't beat the price."
"Taste is pretty good grain and apple with light apple cider hint, and aftertaste of apple and grain. There is a hint of grass and it is fairly spritzy, feel is pretty good and not watery. Although basic, it is good and better than many."
"D: Not a terrible macro, definitely better than Bud. $5.99 a sixer isn't terrible, but there are cheaper and tastier options if you're on a budget."
"Drinkability - easy to salt these away when the mercury's up. Not much to recommend these really, other than their non-offensiveness. Sometimes, though, that's enough."
"this beer has a lot of sentimental value for me. grew up watching my dad and his friends drink this. kind of local for me. its worth a shot buying this due to its really cheap price. to me its better than most of your big name macros, and hey, you cant beat the price. one of the cheapest beers i know of."
"RJT"
"although the thirty pack i bought was in the ""cheap beer"" price range, i could see myself drinking more of this. new to my area; i hope it sticks around as it would definitely be welcome in my rotation of cheap lager thirst quenchers."
"Overall, another average FYB. But due to it's sentimental value it gets a slightly higher score from me. What the hell, give it a shot if you see it."
"Overall, just a typical macro. Nothing special. Relatively drinkable if you can stand drinking something with so little flavor. I, personally, don't want a lot."
"I guess it's not horrible. But I sure like their Cream Ale a whole lot better."
"Oh I did not think highly of this one. I had it one night, about 8 years ago in college, and I still remember it. We were tricked into thinking it was Guinness draft for a dollar. It's just a cheap beer that's not as popular as Natural or Busch, but that's what I would compare it to. So since it was college, and I was broke, we ordered several of these and I'm very surprised I remember anything from that night."
"Among be better macros that I've had. Despite the average taste and adjunct character, the lacing on this beer compares with a good craft beer A good simple food or when you just need a cold beer. Had this on tap at Pepe's in New Haven. If you're ever there it's a must."
"It seemed like to perfect time to review this Genesee, after running on a warm (for March) day. Genesee Beer pours a clear light golden yellow with a decent head that fades quickly. The aroma is strongly grainy, but with a hint of bitter, herbal hops. The flavor is more graininess, with a bit of cooked corn and some kind of astringent bitterness that is both pleasant and unpleasant. The finish is sweet and full bodied considering the lack of flavor elsewhere in this brew. Overall, when on a budget I won't turn this beer up, although at the same price I would much rather the bock or cream ale."
"The beer that made Rochester Famous! Or maybe not. Either way, you can find it around here for cheap simply because it's made in the state. It's not a bad little lawnmower beer, pretty standard American Macro fare.It poured a light yellow, minimal head. The smell and taste are straight up adjunct. It's an average beer, not much to say about it. Gun to my head I probably couldn't pick it out from a lineup against any other beer in the style."
"Notes: While this is by no means a great beer, for what it is, and the competition it has, it is definitely above average. The one thing I hate about adjunct lagers is that gross bizarre sweetness that they have. This beer doesn't have that. It just has the flavors from normal malt."
"Everything everyone else says is true, but there's something really basic about this beer that lifts it above the rest...interesting how there's a bit of a Cream Ale vs. Beer issue for Genesee...I like the Cream Ale but it has a sweet edge I could do without. I wish they would try their hand at a more sophisticated brew that would be available in my parts (downstate NY). Given the consolidation among beer makers over the past 5 years, mostly resulting in ill effects on quality, I guess I want to find a decent independent I can hang my hat on. This comes close but no cigar just yet."
"Drinkability: As far as adjunct lagers go, this is one of the better ones."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts and corn. Taste is crisp but without a lot of flavor. Some notes of malts and corn. Feels light in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this beer is not bad considering it's low price tag."
"One review used the term chemical tasting....RIGHT ON. Great description."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is grainy.Taste is cooked vegetables and grains.A very fresh beer that fits right into the category.I have learned to expand my beer taste but you just can't beat one of these on a hot summer day.I recommend and would buy again."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow with 1 finger of head that fades quickly with a fair amount of lacing. Smells of wet grain with some buttery sweetness. I've lived in Rochester for 28 years and have never had this before, and given all the horror stories I've heard about Genny, its really not that bad. The front end is fairly bland but with more body than most in the style. A hint of bitterness in the middle followed by a sweet finish that's fairly fast and clean."
"A finger of foamy, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a stale odor, like walking into the R & R Tavern when I delivered newspapers. Oof. Mouthfeel was thin without much flavor. It was lightly sweet with the cereal quality so prevalent in the style. Finish had a light bitterness, but nothing worth shouting about. Frankly, I really liked Genny Cream as a kid and this was a second if nothing else was at hand. Not much has changed."
"12oz can purchased at Shaw's in Derry. Pours a crystal-clear light hay-yellow body with a good inch of rim-hugging off-white head that slowly dissipates. Cereal grain dominates the aroma - malt and corn most notably, with just a hint of citrussy grassy hops. Tastes sweet, with cereal grains and cooked corn initially, and a bit more hops than I'm used to getting from the style, expressing themselves mostly as a grassy citrussy presence toward the finish. Finishes clean, as it should for the style. Nothing to complex or profound, but a simple easy drinking macro-style lager that's better than most, and a good quaffable brew for hot summer days like today."
"I recommend the Cream Ale over this one."
"T/M - The mouthfeel is adequate and not all hat watered down as some seem to think. The taste is clean and crisp with a slight hint of dried hops. I like it a bit better than the average rating calculated by BA to this point."
"D: A little tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, good representation of style I suppose, this beer is good for exactly what it's intended to be which is an inexpensive and poundable beer."
"D: I like Genny a lot more than I should. Bland, corny, sweet. Still, something about this one. Very clean and pretty refreshing. This is also all my dad drinks, so maybe there's some sort of residual bias. Whatever. Not bad."
"Medium light body with medium high carbonation keeps things refreshing, but drinkability is hampered by an excessive slickness coupled with the unbalanced sweetness. Really not at all bad for an American adjunct lager. better than most of the big brands out there."
"This beer isn't setting any records or braking any molds but it has been around for a long time and it pretty much sums up the catagory it belongs in. It is a golden American Lager, crisp, clean, refreshing, it has more flavor than most of the others in the style (in that style), and goes very well with lunch or if your in the mood for something easy drinking."
"Very good beer and a good price- harder to find now in Southern Teir NY. Genny Cream is very good too, but can't find it anymore ontap- too bad most people drink tastless beers like bud, and coors- miller- all forigne owned now... Wish more poeple would support American Brewers. Thanks Genny for being in there !"

"Very easy to drink. This is just an ordinary macro, not much different than the others."
"On a hot Summer day, Genesee really does hit the spot."
"A friend of mine owns a campground in upstate New York, and once we run out of homebrew and the good stuff, this is it! That normally means that by Saturday afternoon we're sitting around a smoldering fire with a can of Genesee in our hands. And you know what?... that works fine for me. There's a time and place for every beer, and I think for completely relaxing and doing nothing this is just fine. It's a basic golden lager. It's well-made. It could use a little more maltiness, and a little more hop flavor, but it's really just fine as it is. There are no flaws to it, and it's an easy-drinking, gently hopped, clean golden lager. And that's my review - I'm not going to go into the clarity, color, aroma and so forth because I don't think it's really necessary. If you need that check out my review of Genny Cream ale and they're not really that dissimilar (the Cream ale has some nice fruitiness, a little more maltiness, and appears less bitter)."
"If you see it though, get some - it will help you relive your early beer tasting years."
"This was litterally the lawnmower beer for me. I mowed the lawn, then popped the tab on the can of Genesee. I did manage to find a glass for the beer rather than chugging straight from the can. In hindsight, the straight-can method would have kept me from feeling pretentious about the beer. Quite fizzy and straw with a lot of carbonation. Head retention was fair, but efforvescent. Aromas of part-malt / part-grain first took hold, while German hops, sulfer, fruitiness, and cereal grains follows up. Flavors bring in the malt-grain balance, but the hops fell behind, allowing the sulfurs, esters, and a light vegitable character to gain strength. A carbonation prickle lifts the beer off the toung, and is perhaps its saving grace. The beer is quite thin, astringent, and grainy otherwise. Finishes with apples, pears, and a light corn flavor late. Not the best beer out there, but not a drain-pour either."
"Pours a bit darker than the average macro Lager with a small bubbly white head that leaves no lacing as it drops.The nose is slightly grainy with some light hoppy,earthy scents.The taste comes through with some understated caramel malt sweetness that teases the taste buds,but never delivers anything more than any other cheap Lager,a small amount of hop dryness is a nice touch,but too little too late.Could be a sessionable brew,but it really lacks creativity."
"Genesee out of the keg was the beer of choice among my pals up in Cleveland back in the day. A keg or two would accompany a weekly cook out so I have many fond yet cloudy memories with this beer. Tonight I grabbed a 30 pack for the heck of it. As I am drinking one right now I can honestly say it is a nice change of pace from my usual cheap stand by (which happens to be Strohs). This beer is unusually smooth and has a really good finish compared to most American mainstream beers. My only wish is that the frothy head that is immediately present once poured into a glass would stick around for a bit longer. All in all I can't complain!"
"Poured a light gold that was seethru and a small head that died quickly. Metallic smell due to the can; some faint hops with a grassy tone. A smooth beer, not harsh like other cheap beers, that has some faint hoppy notes on the tongue. Rather bland and weak, but agreeable and not disgusting. I could have another."
"This beer was in my ""Recession Refreshin'"" beer group with other sub $10 a 12-pack beers. It starts out ok, but after a few you really begin to taste the corny alcohol flavor which just isn't good."
"Easy enough to drink but this is a quite boring beer. Mild and non-offending sum this up best."
"For this style of beer the appearance is slightly darker- still very typical. The smell has some adjucts(corn) but not offensive. The taste is smooth with more character than the average American Lager. Highly drinkable --great smooth taste (crisp/nice carbonation)!!! Can be used to wash down wings during the Super Bowl."
"D - Very easy to drink and the low ABV was nice for the next morning. I wouldn't go out of my way and purchase but for the atmosphere like the American Legion with old school fellas, this one will do."
"Overall, very typical of an American style lager. No flavor or smell with an emphasis on trying to intoxicate."
"I wouldn't offer this to anyone but my worst enemies. It's abysmal, and it still shocks me to see so many old hands from my neck of the woods who still drink this swill. Don't try, ever."
"Pours a yellow color with a head that starts out amply and fades. Aroma is light, thin and corny. A bit sweet too. Typical of the style. Taste is not too bad though. Some alcoholic aftertaste with sweetness. Nothing really impressive. What it does have going for it is that it's inoffensive, easy to drink and cheap. I would just give it an average rating. Still much higher than my opinion on a few other macros."
"It's a rather bland, cheap beer that might do in a pinch while sitting at the pool on a hot summer day, but that's about it."
""
"I'd support this beer, especially for the cheap price tag, but also because they are not one of the ""Big Three""...and don't use all their money for advertising. Genny is a classic that I would highly recommend if you like this style...and I do. It wasn't even ice cold when I drank a couple today, (I couldn't wait any longer!) and it STILL was very smooth and yummy. Finish was oh-so CLEAN...and left NO aftertaste at all. Very clean and fresh beer. Props to High Falls for this American classic! I hope it's around forever, and I'm really glad I re-discovered it!! I think it's gonna be my new ""everyday"" brew! If you're a Bud or Miller regular...give this a try and tell me honestly that this isn't just as good...or BETTER! (Better, in my opinion.) Cheers, my friends."
"Cheers!"
"Genny beer is far better than B, M or C, and as a ""macro lager"" it's really pretty darn good. A great cheap beer and perfect for camping."
"Genesee Beer pours a pale yellow with a big white head from a twelve ounce can. The aroma is an extremely mild corn. Light, crisp body. Mild corn flavor, nothing offensive. Overall a pretty drinkable macro lager, nothing to particularly recommend it other than low price though."
"Karst"
"I bought a 12 pack of Genny cans today, haven't had any in maybe 30 years. Was pleasantly surprised and wondered why I took so long to come back to our local brewer. Big head, left a little lacing. A slightly sweet taste and smell, and a toasty aftertaste which I had completely forgotten about over the years. Not a lot of carbonation after the pour. Goes good with food, especially with a local delicacy - a Zweigle's white hot. Try it, you might like it."
"Can: Poured a light golden yellow color lager with a medium bubbly pure white head with an average retention level. Aroma of semi-sweet malt is a bit weak and no hops are discernable. Taste is refreshing with some adjunct malt being noticeable but not overly and dont ruined the beer. Hops level is very low and not discernable. Overall, this is another bland lager without any flaw or any complexity either."
"As far as macros go, this is maybe one of the best. Not a bad beer for a change of pace."
"This is actually very good. Its one of those products that doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it actually is - a decent macro. Yes, it's kind of sweet, but not in a bad, or sickening way. It really does a lot to wet things on a hot summer day. It is a full flavored beer, and it seems to go well with just about any food. Afterwards, I've never had any negative things happening as far as headaches or digestive system problems. In my opinion, it has the standard brews from the big three beaten by a mile, and it costs less as well."
"Pours a vibrant gold with a very large, white, pillowy, slowly-diminishing head thats leaves plenty of thick lacing behind. The smell is lightly sweet with grainy malts, some cooked corn and no detectable hop aromas. The flavor is mild, but not terrible for an obvious adjunct-heavy lager. Though light, the malt flavor that is there is pleasant and is accompanied by some yeast and a very light touch of citrus on the short finish. It has a thin body, watery texture and lively carbonation. Not one Ill be having again anytime soon, but you can do far worse. This wasnt nearly as bad as I thought it would be, though I guess its easy to be impressed when you have low expectations."
"Beats the hell outta most other macros, and anything BMC has ever kicked out. Pours out to a clear gold color with a head that dissipates over time. A thin layer of foam is left over the beer's surface. Some minute traces of lace. Smell is weak, with only hints of adjunct and leathery notes. Taste is acceptable; grain, corn, mild malt and some hops all have a moment with the palate. The mouthfeel is typical of a lager, mild and smooth. A decent level of drinkability. This is not a bad beer, but nothing special either. If I was gonna drink cheap beer at a hockey game or at the bar during quarter beer night, this would be a good choice. A definite step over most macros. Worth a try."
"I live in rochester, how can I give this a bad review? Oh allright, i will be fair. Actually i do love high falls brewing but this is one of the weaker ones. But, for 3.99 a six pack bottles it still is a good deal. Not as good a deal as genesee red or genny cream ale though. This pours a pale straw yellow color with a huge airy head w/some lacing. The smell is unfortunately a little chemically but also sorta malty, hoppy, but most of all CORNY. The taste is grainy yet smooth and clean. malty also. The drinkability is average. I would rather drink this though over a bud anyday. This beer should be bigger than it is. Respect the rock."
"It was a straw pale yellow color with a nice size head of foam on it. It smelled a bit like apple juice with some grains it. The taste was that of some grains that were watered down. Not so much watered down like some other beers. The mouthfeel was light and grainy. This what you would expect for a macro. This would make an ok cheap session beer."
"poured a pale yellow color with abundant white foamy head. Smell is slightly sweet and not much else. Taste is very light with only a bit of sweetness and little malt or hops to notice. Mouthfeel is refreshing on a hot day. Good beer to use as a spacer."
"Genesee Beer is an adjunct-riddled macro lager. That just about says it all, don't you think? In spite of the semi-nasty nose, it's probably drinkable in a pinch and is marginally better than the national brands. Swill it ain't, but it's within sniffing distance."
"Around here you either love it or hate it! It pours a nice golden color,with a good amount of head. Full flavor with no bad after taste. Refreshing, but not too light. I would take it over a Bud any day. No rice or other fillers either. 3.99 for a six pack of bottles. You can't go wrong!"
"pours a straw yellow with a small head, little retention. A grain/ malt scent, with a similiar taste. Not much lacing or carbonation. Below average taste with below average drinkability combine to make a below average beer; but its cheap, so if you are just interested in getting drunk on a budget, genesee isnt's the worst choice, but close."
"Been drinking this swill for years and love it hope it stays arround as long as i do, this beer has a clean crisp taste, holds a good head and most important after pounding genny all nite you wake up with no hangover,so get 30 and go for it your boss will think you had pepsi all nite."
" It's been a while since I've had one of these. It was last year some time in the summer at some parish picnic or firemen's bazzar. Anyway, if you do try this, you'd better hope that 'Genny', who is 'Here', is a nurse. You also better hope she's packing some Immodium. Every time I drink this I get the shits. Every time. At least the brewing process is consistent. If you're constipated, have one. Otherwise, stay away. Unless of course, there's no one in the line waiting to use the restroom and, you feel the need for a good bowel cleansing."
"Overall-virtually a clone of Bud only even cleaner and blander. If your cheap pick this up sometime instead of Bud and see what you think. If you don't like Bud then don't even bother with this product."
"drinkability: I'm only drinking this because my brother left some in my fridge, and I just wanted a beer, any beer, I would never actively seek this out, I imagine the hangover to be nasty, and the taste is awful, how people can put stuff like this above Budweiser, is beyond me, although Bud is certainly not GOOD beer, it's at least a notch above this."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice pale malt scent with a dry, yet slightly fruity lager yeast aroma. It is clean and crisp. The taste is average. It is virtually devoid of any real flavor besides the weak pale malt taste. It is full of adjuncts and a dry lager yeast finish. The goes down easy, but is quite watery. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a slightly above average adjunct lager. It has little complexity, but it drinks well."
"If you're going to buy yellow beer, buy something that's not going to go to keep Bud controlling everything."
"Update 3/1/05: I am buying this more in the can because it's a decent cheap beverage. Although, I still prefer the Red or PBR, I gotta say, when ice cold, this hits the cheapspot."
"I have had bad beers in my day but i had the misfortune of trying this. It was in my friends step-dads frige, i was so used to seeing budlight i noticed something different, he said his buddy brought it down from new york. eager to have a beer other than bud/zepherhills light, i asked if he would mind if i had one. to my misfortune he said sure, that it wasnt available here, only up north. seemed hermless enough, but the first taste was putred.Horrable disgusting taste, couldent even finish it. got half way and dumped it and went for the bud. if it's better than bud it's got to be bad. nearly imposable to drink."
"It pours a very light yellow color. In a pilsner glass, it looks disappointingly thin. The beer presents a wispy, white head that forms just a little lace. The taste is adjunct heavymore corn taste than malt. Still, it was satisfying. Its clean, crisp, and has a pleasant, lightly musty-hop finish. Body is definitely light, almost watery. I can say that I was disappointed, but not extremely so. Still, Ill avoid this one in the future."
"I'm sure the Dude would abide."
"Not a bad beer at all. Genesee never boasts of superior hops or malts. It has never aimed for greatness. It's just an all around good beer in its rawest form."
"I must put this beer into context before I review it. When staying at my in-laws I always enjoy the ability to walk to a bar. There is a working-class bar that I always hit up. It is ten blocks away and they have Genny on tap. The beer decent to look at. The head is one finger and stays for most of the beer. The color is yellow, but not overly clear. It seems to have some body. The smell is of corn and some light hops. The taste is okay for a pale lager. There is definitely corn but the beer is quite smooth tasting. Drinkability, of course, is up to the drinker. Sometimes it is quite drinkable in that little working-class bar in Western Pennsylvania."
"Wow I had this for the first time while in Western NY at my wifes hometown local bar,one of the worse beers I had had in some time.Poures a fizzy yellow color with almost no head,not much smell what there is is very unpleasant almost skunky.Taste is awful something sour hits ya right as it enters the mouth than fades to this watery fizzy tasting mass.Incredably bad will never even think about getting this again."
"In the world of Genny products, I'll stick with the Cream Ale or Red over this one. Or, if still in the mood for a cheap beer, get one of the old standbys (Pabst, Stroh's, or Schlitz). They always seem to do the trick when money's tight."
"Appears filtered clear ""golden"" with a white fizzy head including nice scattered webs of lacing across my faceted mug. Aroma is light sweetness definitely some adjuncts present with a slight touch of hops, clean overall. Taste contains a crisp rolling gingery sweet not bad but decent bland but solid flavor. Balanced and cheap and better than most macros in my opinion. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied but not thin there' some decent fluffy texture here from the carbonation. Drinkability well, much better beer exists but I would still settle for this over most macros like I said, a cheap high quantity type brew."
"12 oz can. I grew up on this stuff, and have to admit I still enjoy a few whenever I make it home. Pours a straw yellow, with a moderate head that recedes quickly. Aroma of the malt and maybe the adjunts. Good carbonation, and for me that familiar genny taste. I admit its a little lacking in any real body or depth but, still a good all night session beer"
"This is another of the many pale lagers that have done a better job than the majors in everything but the marketing. Not a bad effort a decent lager beer. The malt nose is joined by a pleasant grain taste that indicates both barley and corn. Decent enough straw color with the standard white head. Not a bad beer; not a great beer."
"Pale gold, highly carbonated with moderate head that doesn't stick around too long. Corn aroma mixed with a bland hop smell. Gristy corn taste that lingers sort of bitter/sour in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and lingering (due to the aftertaste)."
"This is one of those beers that does not aspire to be great - it simply aims to be drinkable. As far as that goes, this is actually a very pleasant beer. Don't waste time trying to find any complexity to the flavor - softly sweet, almost a touch of honey, malt with a bit sour finish is all you will find. But, pair this with some sharp cheddar and crackers and it won't get in the way."
"This is a pretty brew but it wont put out. Very nice mid golden colour and pours a nice head which disapates to a wide ring around the glass. However the taste is hollow, certainly lacking and is bitter and lingering. This to me constitutes a limited occasion beer, limited to those visitors of yours that you do not want to return."
"Since that time, small lakes Canadian, imported and craft brewed beer has flowed over this tired palate. Ya know what? Genny tastes good to me! You have to come from the right frame of reference. I believe you Yanks are too hard on yourselves when it comes to grading the local commercial sudz. This Gennesee reminded me of a traditional local brewed American lager from a time when the local breweries CARED and had to make their smaller batches consistantly BETTER than the mega brewers to keep alive. I'd give this new offering from high falls an overall 3.5 for focusing on the traditional repeatable quality of the regional American brewer before the 70s corporate shit-storm made national brands taste different depending on where you bought them. Long live Genny!"
"If the cream ale was not enough, we have this offering. Bland, devoid of any taste, this would make a good stadium beer. That is to say, if you spill a cup of this, you aren't going to lose any sleep."
"Maybe it was the can, maybe it was the beer.  I was faced by a lack of options at a party, so I though I'd give it a try.  I poured some into a glass exposing the light color and releasing some funky aromas.  The first sip was OK, but after I swallowed, all kinds of bad flavors appeared.  I tried it straight from the can a few times with no luck.  I hated to dump a beer, but I couldn't drink it.  So I picked up a Rock.  What's this, Rock Light?  I thought Rolling Rock WAS a light beer!  A review for a later time."
"A very bland beer. Not impressed at all."
"It is light in color, with a nice head with tightly packed bubbles.  First taste if of a fizzy malt rush with slight hoppy overtones.  Goes down pretty smooth, but the simplicity of the brew quickly annoys you.  Finishes with a heavy adjunct aftertaste."
"This beer poured a pale yellow color and had absolutely no head and thereby creating no lace. It had an aroma of hops and grain. the flavor was weakly of hops and mostly of grain. The finish had an incredible amount of bite to it. I drank this back in my poor college days. Glad I am a working stiff now so I can avoid beer such as this."
"Notes: Beats Bud hands down IMO, comparable to other American lagers of the sort. Sadly this beer is not as big as either of the big three Macro beers of the US."
"This is one of the better (macro-brewed) American lagers.  Clean and flavorful."
