"only better then bud cause has more alcohol"

"Among the worst beers of my life."

"Not very good taste for me"
"Try it, and please write a review."
"O- pretty unoffensive, but not much more than carbonated water.  This would appeal to a non-beer drinker"

"Outlier detected...*eye roll*...it's not great"
"My first go to beer from back in the day.  More flavorful than its world renowned relative and I found it more enjoyable."
""
"Cheap beer with higher than usually booze. Gotta love/hate it"
"good mass produced beer very drinkable"
"O: I appreciate the thicker malt constitution of malt liquors and the like, but this comes across almost as if they froze off and removed some of the beer and left the all the water... as a vehicle to drunk, it does the job, but I'd prefer a little more of what something like Old E or Colt 45 has going on... I'll sum up by saying this beer is technically impressive but sensually flaccid."
""
"Very light, not a lot of taste.  Very drinkable, but overall nothing great."
"Looks great, but not a lot of taste but very drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it."

"I had one of these fresh out of the freezer. put it in the freezer 30 minutes ago. Yeah its cheap obviously. If you can look past the price and not consider this to be trashy or whatever, this stuff is good. I will compare this on scale with other ice beers. Busch is maybe about the same as this, but this is stronger slightly. Busch Ice is some good stuff when you are wanting to crack open a brewski for cheap and relax. Its a nice golden color. One thing. Don't let this get remotely warm.  Best way i can describe it is it tastes like beer. Bought an 18 pack of this on my quest to find the best ice beer. So far ive had Busch Natty and then this. Also Keystone. Keystone is gross. This is a Good solid American Lager. Its not offputting or meant for craft drinkers. Its just a cheap beer. Isn't bad. I find it refreshing after a long day of work. I have a beer periodically because its good for you."

"Overall (2.01) : not worth a 12 pack; but for a one off with leftover pizza it's okay. Nice smooth flavor with a frozen feel and a malt character. Its still a crime to make a beer this bad and Bud Light is better tasting - and I don't even like bud light."

"Overall: Comparing this to all other AALs, I see nothing offensive about this at all. In fact, it tastes almost like every other American Adjunct Lager out there. I have a feeling that when people rate these cheap macro adjuncts, they rate them compared to the DIIPAs and 10% barrel aged imperial stouts that they love."

"While I was picking up a can of Bud Light Lime Appale-Ahhhh-Rita (was that the right number of H's there?), I spied a can of Bud Ice and remembered I'd never tried it.  Time to change that.  This stuff pours a clear straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam.  The nose barely exists, though I think some processed cereal grains and hard water come through.  Maybe.  I don't know, though.  The taste resembles your usual Bud Light, with some processed corn, hard water, and mild biscuit-like sweetness, though a hint of extra booze is in there (it's not terribly perceptible, but it's there on occasion).  The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat watery feel.  Overall, this is your basic booze-boosted adjunct lager, not really bad, per se, but decidedly boring and tedious."

"Bud Ice is a tolerable effort, one that is a bit better than Natural Ice, if that's saying much. I like its smoothness and its surprising lack of anything bitter or harsh, but also am underwhelmed by its lack of zest or anything outside of the ordinary. To a degree, it's almost offensively predictable."

"Overall a disappointment. I thought it would be a bigger Bud but it was not. Recommended for those who don't enjoy the taste of beer."
"This is the epitome of cheap/college beers. Horrible taste, but after one 16oz. you stop caring about taste. This is great for wanting to get plastered on a budget. Other than that, do your self a favor and pay a few cents more for a full flavored Budweiser."

"Ok, let me see here. This is cheap. Its average. It tastes like a mixture of beer and a sweet taste. Its cheap. For something you could get a 30 pack of for 13.99 its still better than natural light. for something thats so cheap that its almost malt liquor its good. but there are much better options available."

"Overall, this is about what I expect for this style of beer in this price range. It's nothing special but nothing repugnant either. I paid $1.99 for the tallboy."

"First i'll start off with how this beer ended up in my fridge. Well as I said I am just beginning my beer adventure and a local beer and wine store carries a free book that lists all of their available beer and wines. Not knowing a damn thing about either I simply decided to try the first one in the book which was a listing of their domestic beer. First on the list was this and luckily I actually like it. Its light and to my taste buds has a slightly sweet taste to it. After reading the reviews I see alot of people arent a fan. But I find this to be a good starter beer especially for the ladies. Its light in color, taste and the impact on your wallet. I got a 12 pk of the bottles for about 8 dollars. I think this would be great hanging out at the beach or pool or outside on a hot day. No bitter after taste that I hate from the stronger flavored craft beer. I'm a fan. I would definitely repurchase"

"O = bought this large bottle as a joke for me and my brother, a few sips and we poured the rest out. not worth drinking IMO, even for 99 cents for a 18 ouncer. We jokingly dub it a ""Big Ol' Ice o' Bud"" for reasons unknown."

"If there was a 0 i would have put it. A hint of mouthfeel other wise corn seltzer Held about a 1/4 inch head for about 1 minute. Just a really poor excuse for a beer! Most ices are sub par but, this one is dreadful! I remember bud dry which gave way to the ice but at least bud dry was in a dark bottle and had a hint of hops! I first tried bud ice down in arkansas where bad beer is the norm. I guess it's all opinion but i just don't see it! Never again !"

"Overall: Malt liquor lite, this has all the downfalls of cheap malt liquor, without the benefit of high abv."

"Overall: not the best beer in the world, but not the worst example of the style. That said, I still don't like this beer very much."

"Poured this American Adjunct Lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear straw color, produced a white head, retention was poor and no lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this beer is clean, some faint grain aroma. Light in body, this is a clean beer, somewhat strong flavor of grain, sweet, and some slight hop bitterness at the finish. Overall, not a beer that I would go back to anytime soon."
"Ehh. This may have been the first time I ever had this beer, but it was bad either way you look at it. Just stick with Budweiser regular."

"This is the typical American Ice Lager. Very comparable to Natty Ice, except slightly more smooth and less harsh tasting. Very light and carbonated, with an almost malt-liquor scent. Taste is in line with most all AAL's, but slightly more heavy on the malts. Pours a really orangish-golden color, no head retains and no lacing. Not a good beer, but if you want something with Ice on it, this is a safe bet."
""
""
""
""
"Wow, a beer I never thought I'd review but here goes: Pours brassy/golden with a white head that leaves some lace...gotta bless the brewing wizards for that! Slight sour and adjuncty nose. Mouthfeel is more than expected, much better than the mainstream ""Bud"" we were weaned on. Finish is pretty much non existent but for what it's worth I expected less (sampled at a party) Would I buy it on my own? No. Is it drinkable? Yes."
""
""
""
"The best "" Bud "" beer period. Easily the smoothest, And the best tasting. You can pick it up for cheap, And it does a great job at getting you drunk. A definite party favorite. Doesn't taste much different than most American beer's, But MUCH better than anything Budweiser or Bud Light can offer. it is altogether much more drinkable. And the high alcohol content will get you where you need to go"

"Not my first choice when the budget allows, but at five dollars a six pack, it does stand out among cheaper beers. I'd rank it right around classic Budweiser as far as my taste goes. That said, it would certainly make a good session beer for the light of pallet and tight of wallet among us."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, very pale amber color. Decent head but disappears quickly. Scent is weak but mostly of grassy grains. Taste is smooth and weaker, but does have some good features that are refreshing and drinkable. Leaves a semi-dry after taste and is decently tasty for a cheap Bud brew."

"Taste... not much. Insipid and nearly flavorless, unless you count wet paper as a flavor. Wet manila folders, corn, co2. Watery, astringent and overly charged with co2, gaseous and burpy almost instantly. This is a very poor AAL, but pretty much what you'd expect."

"Pours clear gold into pils glass, 3 finger head gone in 30 seconds. Smells, frankly, like vomit. Taste isn't horrible off the bat, plain adjunct taste nothing more or less. Moderate carb and clean finish, crispy with a bite to it. Below average but at least the taste isn't too bothersome. Smell is truly unpleasant though and for that alone I almost despise this brew"
"Overall, got this from a friend. Sine I drink anything I accepted it gladly. Not very good, but I like this more than a lot of other things."

"Tried this one at a friends house a couple days ago. I have drank many buds in my life but this one ranks down there with bud light lime and the chelada. Just nasty taste of rottin corn and barley. Even ice cold the stuff is a drainpour. My buddy said it was only $7 a twelve pack and thats why he bought it for the card game. there is a reason it is that cheap because it sucks bigtime. Normal bud is much better"

"Personally, I think Natural Ice has more flavor, a better flavor, and there's more alcohol, all for a lower price. I'd get Natty over this, but this is a good beer all its own."
"This is definitely a miss. There's nothing here worth a second glance. This is just another foul, macro adjunct lager."
"Oh dear God, I can not believe I had one of these. I was at a college party and my buddy bought some of these to be a game called edward beer hands or something like that, but I dont play beer games so I just had a few sips of it and gave it to him to play with my other friends...anyways, this beer is just terrible. It tastes like beyond cheap malt liquor, has a weird liquory with slight malt smell. The taste is just awful. Maybe I am ruined with these kind of beers, but I gag on beers with no flavor. The mouthfeel was horrible too, I couldnt stop burping after this beer. Overall this is by far the worst beer I have ever had."
"O: As unappealing as this lager is, there are worse beers of this type out there. Reach for this one only in case of an emergency, and even then, think long and hard about it."
"Overall: Neither good nor awful. Just a standard macro ice brew. Still, considering the almost identical similarity to Bud Light, you might as well get a little more bang for your buck and essentially get drunker quicker. The ABV will put you through the floor quicker than Light will. Still though, unmemorable enough for me to stash the remaining few bottles in the back of my fridge to never touch again."
"taste and looks like water.... no aroma... no head... i hear its very hard to make though and they get it the same every time... i guess that is one positive... oh and they do have good commercials!!!"
"O - I do not recommend this beer due to the metal taste and lack of any other flavor. It is cheap though, but it's just not for me."
"I actually really like this brew! It is cheap it does the job for sure and it doesn't taste like crap. If poured into glass it is golden in color with a nice smell of malts and a little hint of hops the taste is very nice mouth feel happens to be great! It feels between a Budweiser and natural ice but with a nice balance!"
"Overall Drinkability - One of the worst beers I've ever had. In one word: Unrefreshing. All off flavors, no good ones."
"D- This beer isn't awful and I could certainly have a few but it is not what I would choose to go back for."
"The taste is more mild than I was expecting. It tastes a lot like carbonated water and a tiny tiny bit like bread. It doesn't have any negative taste like a light beer or many macrobeers. So, that's a plus, I guess. But there is absolutely nothing good about it."
"Cheers..."
"smell grainy"
"Wow. 5.5% was such a big number back in the day. Pours light golden yellow. Smells stale and urea-like. Tastes the same with more sweetness to it than a regular Bud. Overly light mouthfeel, and an unpleasant rotten aftertaste. To be avoided."
"Overall - Generally very tasteless. Not bad, but not interesting at all. It would be a good general drinking beer."
"24 ounce can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about a half inch white head that didn't stay around too long. There's a small amount of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is bready/grainy and sweet malt, not much else to it. With that being said, the aroma isn't offensive. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly bready and sweet malt with a metallic bitter taste noticable. Mouthfeel/body is light, and it has good carbonation. Drinkability isn't bad at all, it's easy enough to drink. I certainly wouldn't make a point to drink this very often, but for $1.29 a can it's not bad. And when you buy Bud Ice, you pretty much know what you're getting."
"D - yeah, it's drinkable but why, unless you're under 21."
"I used to love bud and anything bud when I was younger, but all bud seems to do know is cause headaches and fills you up too much. Thats not that enjoyable. Bud ice though seems to be my favorite of the buds. The alcohol content is pretty high compared to a normal beer but this is not something I would buy persistently."
"24oz can ice brewed with born on date stamped on can. 2 finger head that went to nothing almost instantly. Ultra clear with absolutly no carbonation within moments. color is apple juice ( dark yellow ). This smells like nothing but maybe a wiff of grain. The taste is sweet from the malt and alcohol which strengthens in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is harsh it actually kinda burns a bit I dont think its from the alchol as its only 5.5 abv kinda weird feel though almost like a seltzer burn from the carbonation but theres no carbonation here. I would'nt really try this again nor reccomend it to anyone."
"I could drink a lot of these if they were ice cold on a hot day. Other than refreshment (which has more to do with temperature), this one doesn't have much to offer."
"Not a bad party beer or summer beer. I know i have rated it higher than most here but I was pleasantly surprised how good this 12 pack tasted. So I will give it its due....this time. :-)"
"Half a finger head, pure white, gone in seconds. Color is a 6 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of wet straw, damp corn and sweet barley. Taste is harsh and bitter, but a sweet aftertaste. Flavor of corn, wheat, and malt. Little mouthfeel, leaving a dry feeling in the back of my throat. May be better after a few, but I don't think I could drink that many."
"D- Boring, bland, and corny. Very watery."
"When this first came out I liked it. To me it had a dry finish that was good. This is another beer to mow and play golf with. It is good for that at least. I usually have this in bottles when i do have it and it tastes fine smells ok drinks well, and is cheap and easy to find. It is like the rest of these mass produced beers. I would drink it again."
"D - Sure this isn't the best beer in the world but for its style it really isn't all that bad plus I have a soft spot in my heart for it from back in the day in the Marines when I could only buy a six pack at a time on base"
"D - At first it wasn't too bad, but I found myself cringing toward the end or it."
"had this one straight from the 16 oz bowling pin bottle (pretty cool). not a bad mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. didnt really smell it. after raking leaves for 2 hours, it went down smooth and was quite refreshing. would i drink it again?...not unless i wanted the ""ice chunk bottle"" for my collection. all in all, not a horrible ice beer, but it is still an ice beer."
"From 24 fl. oz. can #10297-NA66. Sampled on November 13, 2010. It pours golden-yellow with no head to speak of. The aroma does bring out some malts but otherwise it is corny, grainy, and metallic. There's a creaminess in the thin body. The taste does have something sweet about it with thin hops toward the end but it really does not blow me away. Cheap though."
"Save yourself from this beer... must have Dogfish"
"Barely even drinkable for those unaware of beer goodness."
"To quote Dave Chappelle in his Samuel Jackson beer skit ""It's beer it gets ya drunk"" that is the only thing Bud Ice is good for getting you drunk. It is one of the worst Macro's in Flavor and drinkabilty and thats like being the heaviest person at Weight Watchers it is not the trophy that you would put on your mantle. Unless you need a fix to stop the shakes don't drink this beer"
"Pretty much in line with the 'ice' beers from the ice beer wars I remember in Canada back in the 90s. Generally smooth, generally inoffensive, generally more boozy, for that extra half point of ABV. More going on that I would have given Budweiser credit for, but that said, it ain't nothin' to brag about. I've had worse."
"The only bright spot was that after the game we had to track down a restaurant to sober up, so we errantly wandered into Pyramid Brewery (looked like a food place to drunk people). I'm sure I enjoyed their hefeweizen, but I can't remember."
"D: Bland and brainless, but also pretty inoffensive. It's definitely not hard to drink, but it's a bit of a chore to enjoy or appreciate. It says something that I was pleasantly surprised by this even though it scores fairly low."
"D: bout as drinkable as water but not as appetizing."
"Skunky and harsh with a thin but carbonated texture that is anything but smooth, there is no reason to buy this beer. I'm really glad that I tried one can for free because if I had bought a twelve pack of this I would have regretted it. Two of my friends tried it with me (all of us had it straight out of the can) and they literally couldn't even finish theirs. They dumped out half their cans in the grass. I managed to get mine down but it wasn't pleasant."
"D-Poor"
"Too carbonated and drinkable if ice cold."
"I'm not really sure of the reason for this beer. I guess it has a bit more maltiness than a regular Bud, but I'm not sure that it has anything else different to it. If possible, I think it actually has an even more limited taste than a Budweiser. In the past I've tried to appreciate these kinds of beer. But no more. I've had too many good beer and there is no other way to describe this than bad."
"Bud Ice, well what can you say other than look it's a bud beer trying to have a different name pretty much. I think that this one is alright. Not going to be what I reach for if I'm going for the big 3, but wouldn't say no if offered with no other options. I mean at the end of the day it's still beer. It's a light color, smells like nothing and tastes icy. It was ice cold thanks to the cooler and that made it tasty. Watery but that's alright because your not expecting anything but that from bud ice."
"D: I picked this 24oz can at a gas station for 99 cents. All of the other beer stores were closed, and this was something I hadn't troed before. Not terrible, but I probably wouldn't pay much more for this."
"That being said, it has a following that only Hitler would be jealous of, and for mere pennies more you could upgrade to the much improved Busch Light. You make the call."
"Overall: The body of the beer is light and the finish is light. This beer made me chuckle, it said an ale, but on another part of the can it said. lager. This beer is tolerable on a low level. The drinkability is very low. It is a beer to slam and not to enjoy."
"Dooby dooby doo..."
"Thin body, fizzy carbonation, and boozy taste make for terrible drinkability."
"AVOID AVOID AVOID!"
"Just eating out of the garbage would be better, from a cost/value analysis."
"Bud Ice is an Ice Beer, brewed by Anheuser-Busch. Bud Ice has an ABV of 5.5%  This brew pours out a deep amber color with a nice white head. The smell is sweet, with grains and , malts. This  brew has a strong beer taste.  You pick up on the 5.5 % ABV , and malts and grains. Bud ICE is best COLD. This brew has an ok balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in it. The mouthfeel is bold but , it has a clean finish. Anheuser-Busch did a nice job with this brew.  Overall I'm giving Bud Ice a 4.5 out of 5. I would buy this brew again."
"Wouldn't be hard to take a few if drunk fast & without thinking, but not worth paying attention to."
"D: If you don't care about flavor and just want to get blitzed, then yeah this is the beer to have. Can't detect any alcohol and there is hardly and flavor and it is watery....You can pound this stuff."
"D: I'd not really recommend this, Natural Ice is even better! but if you can find it, I'd recommend you try it at least once."
"I don't get it."
"RJT"
"dark gold with no head but some carbonation. heavy grainy aroma, not really adjuncty to the extreme. medium full body. hops? uh....i smell something more along the lines of rubbing alcohol. pretty smooth, with a crisp malt liquor type feel. it misses the mark in the refreshment category because it leaves a strange, unwelcome astringent aftertaste. oh well, slam a few quick, get a good buzz, and beware of the penguin!"
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"D- Although it is light in body, it certainly isn't something that I could drink many of."
"This is a very drinkable beer only if you are drinking to get drunk. It is better than some of the beers you would get from a keg but it's not as good as regular Budweiser or Bud Light for that matter. It really doesn't have that much of a smell to it at all."
"Grabbed a can of this to use in a dip for the Super Bowl party tonight, and decided to finish off the can. Poured into a pilsner glass. This pours a darker than expected gold with a nice frothy white head on top. Retention is zilch and there is no lace at all. Scents of corn mash and sugar. The body is crisp and refreshing, as expected. Flavor is of creamed corn with the subtle sweetness, and buttered white bread. Light bitterness. Huh. Color me surprised. This was actually decent and hit the spot this afternoon. This is one of the better Bud offerings IMO. In a world of light, thin, no-flavor beers, this one stands above with a bit of flavor and body. I'd have it again methinks."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1 inch head. Smell is fairly sweet, malts and corn. Taste is a bit sweet, corn and malts with a slight metallic flavor. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a very mediocre beer."
"D - Not drinkable at all in my opinion."
"D: Normally adjunct lagers are close to water and easy to take down. This one just isn't good and makes it tough to drink."
"Â "
"Although this is clearly a beer I steer clear of, it is still not the worst ice beer I've ever had- that distinction belongs solely to ""the Beast"". Still, I don't recommend this to anyone unless they are dead broke AND there's no Busch to fill their cravings."
"Dispensed from my kegerator into my frosty mug and also into my mouth. Pale golden color with a white head. Smells kinda like straw and alcohol. Not as corny as I would have expected. Fittingly, the frosty mug was so cold it froze some of the beer. Ice cold is the way to drink Bud Ice, and any American ""Ice"" beer for that matter. Its fairly highly carbonated, and served vary cold its fairly inoffensive. As it warms the alcohol comes out a bit more. Overall a bland fizzy beer."
"D: Not too flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling since there isn't much to it, mild kick (despite the ""Ice"" in the name), decent representation of a lackluster style, just another fizzy yellow beer, but it's better than some of the others I've had from A-B."
"Why does this beer exist? The obvious answer is to sell to people who want to get drunk, but considering this is only 5.5% ABV, why pick this over the regular Bud? If you want a high alcohol cheap beer, try one of the malt liquors with 8% instead of this. I would rather drink something that tastes like water than this: light beer."
"Drinkability: Not bad; it was better than I was expecting. On the whole, however, this is not something I'm going to run out and find for myself."
"A flash of grainy and semi-sweet malts is followed by a carbonation blast and then, poof...completely gone. Finishes dry and quick. Not much else to say about it, really. It's pretty easy to drink and for a beer like this, it is probably a good thing the flavor leaves the palate so fast."
"Out of a can this beer was a twenty-four carat gold color with some nice rising carbonation. The two finger beige head retained rather poorly and the lacing was good at first though it left only tiny bands later. The aroma was of macro grains, pale malt, crystal malty alcohol and aluminum. The flavors were bland, stale and dominated by macro grains with some pale malt, a slight sourness, metal, sweet malt and some bitterness of herbal notes. The mouthfeel was rough, the body was medium and the carbonation high."
"I'm going to go hug my penguins now (I have a rookery) and try to forget that this debacle ever took place."
"Very plain on the tongue and drinks just like water should. Err."
"The appearance was a crystal clear bright gold with no lacing. The smell was funky. Mildly sweet and skunky. The taste wasn't awful. A too-small kiss of hops followed up with a tiny bite from some alcoholic sweetness that gets buried in an avalanche of corn flavor until the end. The mouthfeel is ... it serves this beer well, 'cause you could pound these things but they'll catch up with you soon because there seems to be more alcohol than beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: Yuck!... The beers body is slightly more than watery. So this is what the water from the millcreak is like? The drinkability for me is shot due to stinging carbonation."
"Verdict: Let's do a mental exercise. I want you to imagine a bottle of Bud Light with a percent more alcohol and perhaps a little more grainy malt. Can you see it? There, now I've saved you from ever bothering to try this. Bleh."
"Drinking this beer was mildly pleasurable. There was no strong aftertaste or harsh alcohol flavor but there wasn't much flavor at all. It goes down well but just seemed to be too much on the lighter side."
"And yes, it is ""remarkably easy to drink."" Good show, AB. I rather like it."
"Drinkability: Dooby-dooby-doo! Not altogether horrendous. When it comes to these adjunct-laden macros, I'll take mild and smooth over harsh and sickly any day of the week."
"24oz. can, poured into a Busch ""pint"" habdle mug. Born on date O7 Jan '09. Pale maacro yellow with a fluffy white head of foam that dissolves into a light collar. Surprisingly little carbonation...hardly any bubble action going on. Aroma is of stale wet cardboard and overcooked rotten veggies. Taste is weak and watery. Rice water to be exact. Kind of a bitter, sour finish. Mouthfeel is light and slightly fizzy. Drinkability would be higher if it had any flavor to it. This wasn't even worth the $1.50 I paid for it. The only ""redeeming"" factor is that the higher alcohol content means ""it'll get ya drunk!"" When you really think about it, isn't that the only reason anyone drinks this crap?"
"Bud Ice is a pretty decent beer it looks a little shitty an smells a little weird but other then that, it doesn't really taste that bad but it has a hint of Alcohol and a watered down sensation.its very light and very easy to pound away, and the 5.5 ABV isnt that bad! Overall, very good party beer and hot summer day beer."
"Wow, this is a whole bottle of suck. The only beer below this one is Beer 30. Ice beer is just a terrible concept and should be purged from any brewers mind. Nothing good about color, taste, or head. Not to mention being seen with a Bud Ice is very unattractive. Ice beer has only one quality, they sacrifice flavor for alcohol content. If you're just looking to get drunk, you might have a problem."
"So, it's down to Bud Ice. I still can't understand why the guys at Ab would still put something in a clear bottle. Can they not have the ice-cuby bottle made in brown, or would it just look like it was covered in little boxes or something? Anyway, this pours completely clear and yellow with not much of a head at all. Little more alcohol than it's regular (non ice) brother, and a little more pronounce of a corn flavor. Overall, not the worst beer I've ever had, but it's not exactly for the connoisseur, or pretty much anyone with a discriminating palate at all for that matter. As far as good things... the blue can looks cool?"
"I pick up something like this once and a while just to try it and rate it.A pale golden pour with a thin fizzy head,not much of an aroma,slightly corny maybe something that resembled pale malt,lots of lively carbonation.I must have been really thirsty or this was ultra fresh,because it has kind of a fruity dimly hoppy flavor,dry finish.not bad for $1.99 . I don't think I would run out and buy this again but I would drink it again ."
"Out of a tallboy can, I now refuse to buy a bottle colored anything but dark brown. Pours darker than a usual American macro pale lager, no skunk smell (thank god) but not much else there either- a little on the pour and nothing afterwards. Not much of a taste here. A little more than Bud Light, a little less than Budweiser. Really nothing to it, but it is refreshing in the same way water is. Not as much carbonation as some other beers, even the Blue Moon I had last night I marked down more for excess carbonation. For what it is, it ain't bad, but in the whole spectrum of things, it's trash just like the rest of the American macro pales. I have a Smuttynose IPA to try after this, so this is really just a warm-up brew for me on a Friday night :-D"
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - You could probably only drink a few of these before the 5.5% sneaks up on you and slaps you in the face. Not much to say about this beer. Nothing to foul or offensive about it, which is good, and for 1.50 a 32oz, plus 5.5% ABV. That makes it an easy to drink, kick back get a buzz beer. Its a decent Adjunct Lager, but a little one profile and boring. Id still say give it a try sometime when your low on cash."
"Overall: yeah, in its time and place"
"Serve this one cold as possible and enjoy the benefits of the 5.5% ABV. I purchased a 12 pack of bottles for sale at $9.99, not too shabby. I was surprised to notice that I haven't reviewed this beer yet."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a thick white head. Not much aroma, some barley and hops. The taste was very sweet and metallic. Water texture and very carbonated. From my previous experiences with ""ice"" beers I was pleasentaly suprised. Not bad overall, but the taste was was not quite there to make it a hot day beer."
"D: Drinkability was uneventful even for a light lawnmower beer. Cold, stale, and was like licking a cold steel beam at times."
"The one thing good about this beer is that it is a bit sweeter than a normal budweiser, its like the baby of coors and bud light."
"Poured a piss yellow with a minimal white fizzhead that disapeared quickly. Some alcohol in the smell with a little sweetness. Tastes like carbonated corn water. Metalic booze taste also. Feel is highly carbonated and crisp without alot going on. I can't wait to go to my cousin's house and bring him a case of this swill."
"Golden colored, not quite as pale looking as some other swill. Some head and a little retention so it looks a little better than standard swill. Doesn't taste any better. I feel I've said this before: malty, corn, grains, semi-skunked offensive taste. No thanks."
"D: Not a horrible macro, but a bit of a chore to drink, won't buy again, when PBR is 50 cents less."
"mouthfeel is crisp, dry, highly carbonated, not amazing in the least."
"Just a poor offering. Wouldn't disrespect food by drinking this. An absolutely must avoid. I'd rather reach for a water if given the choice."
"Eww. I've only had one of these in my life and that was enough. I barely like Bud products as is... Average light beer taste, if not more watered down it seems despite the higher ABV% ... I think it is just a marketing ploy to get more people to buy it... I just say splurge the extra pennies on a better product, at least bud light if you prefer bud products, or better in my opinion, Miller products. All in all, avoid unless your dirt broke... in that case, give it a shot I suppose, haha."
"D - A pretty sub-par beer overall, but at least is mostly unoffensive. The sweetness inherent in this and most other ice beers really lower the drinkability; no doubt before I get through this 24 oz can I will find it sickeningly cloying."
"Purchased cheap just to do the review..wanted to compare to Molson Ice..there is no comparison apparently."
"D - Quite possibly one of the worst beers I've ever had. No hops, no maltiness, not even a little sweet. It reminds me of a movie beer, you know a completely generic labeled beer that just says ""Beer"" on the label."
"D - The only reason I drank this stuff was because it's cheap and has a 5.5% ABV."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 40-ounce clear glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Very bland. A sweeter than typical macro. The .5% alcohol is part of the gimmick. Not much higher abv, but the alcohol, I assume is what's lending its higher sweetness than normal for the style. I had to force it down, as it's rather unpleasant. There are much better ""ice beers"" and macros out there."
"Pours a very pale straw color with a nice head initially, but dwindles down to a lace. The smell is just adjuncts and nothing else. Taste is not too bad, but tastes watery for 5.5% ABV. Mouthfeel is decent and is moderately carbonated. There taste is not overloaded with adjuncts like you might expect. I tried to keep style in mind when reviewing this one and it's a pretty good Ice beer and I definitely like it better than regular Bud. Don't expect too much from this beer, but it's not the worst thing out there either."
"drinkability was smooth and easy, though the beer got alittle boring by cans end."
"Although there are some passable cheap swills, this is not one of them. Yuck-o."
"This is by far one of the worst in the Bud family. The color is a pale yellow with a fizzy white head. The aroma is mostly old grains and grass. The flavor profile is really bland with a corny bitterness. The body is extremely light yet this one is still hard for me to take down."
"It is about as filling as a regular Budweiser, and has a mild sweet taste, but not enough to ruin the beer flavor."
"WEll, rated fairly it's not as bad as some I've had. I don't like the style, though, so I won't buy it again."
""
"D - Not a beer I would drink more than 24oz of -just doesn't hold my interest. I appreciate a decent ice beer, but this is not Eisbock. I am not impressed to say the least. This is best used as a palate cleanser. I generally I am not a fan of fizzy and yellow, but I would rather drink this than Bud if pressed. I say avoid this it isn't worth the time or bladder space."
" honestly, this is one of the worst beer experiences I've ever had, not THE worst but damn close. AVOID indeed."
"D: Meh. It's not something I would buy on a regular basis, but if push comes to shove, I would drink it again. Granted, I have not had it from the clear bottle, but overall it's not a terrible ice brew. Nothing extraordinary, but palatable."
"In highschool, this was my beer of choice. Well, this or Red Dog. Says a lot for my tastes back then, doesn't it? I used to pound these back and remember preferring this to the taste of the Budweiser. I now realise that I was horribly mistaken on the taste. What the hell was I thinking?"
"Smells like skunky vegetable, tastes much the same. This is foul and awful stuff. Avoid at all costs. Basically it's water with an aftertaste of skunked malt."
"A clear, golden body that has nothing but a light alcohol and airy smell. It tastes like a tart Budweiser, which isn't as bad as that sounds but there is a horrible aftertaste and it leaves me even more thirsty (maybe that's how they get people to keep drinking this). After splitting a 6-pack with my friend Mike I not only didn't want to keep drinking this stuff, I was done drinking for the night."
"If you want cheap this is the beer to go with. This and the light ice beer they make. I cannot seem to find this beer anymore, as if I am trying. but overall it is not too bad of a beer from AB. I would recomend this beer to any college student trying to get drunk cheap"
"Drink-Ability: Not very drinkable at all. I do not recommend this beer."
"A less-than-spectacular offering from the famous Budweiser company, this is a slightly stronger beer than other Budweiser products, but where it scores for strength, it lacks in flavor and character. A resoundingly ""oily"" taste has you feeling like your drinking petroleum rather than a world-class brew. I wouldn't go for this beer unless I was trying to get really tipsy for as cheap as I possibly could. Definitely not worth a try unless you're willing to part with a $1.09 to try 24 ounces of a liquid that might as well have been pumped out of your local Texaco..."
"The taste has light notes of malt, corn, and even smaller hop character. Very bland...it's almost like drinking lightly flavoured water. I can't say much more than that other than I'm pouring the rest down the drain."
"Another crappy pale lager from the folks at Anheuser-Busch. Again, pours pale yellow with little head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is almost nonexistent except for the smell of adjunct. The higher alcohol content is evident in the taste. Mouthfeel is about the same as Bud, but this beer has less drinkability."
"Probably won't have this again"
"Moldy, stale cooked veggies, gritty woody and ropey taste. Just a stronger Bud Â– and at only 5.5%, what a waste of a bottle. Clear one at that, maybe a light striking would help this crap."
"If I could give this beer all 0's I would. This was once a staple of mine in high school, just because of the price. But i went back to this recently just to re-live some good ol days. and YUCK! the color goes along with the yellowish tint of most american brews, but the smell was horrific. smelled like rice, and the taste was just as horrible. I can't even describe it. Never agian will i drink this, or even allow somone to drink this."
"Pours a clear, yellowish color (seemingly typical) with a nice head at least. Aroma is of adjuncts and nothing impressive to me. Taste is much of the same,except that it reminds me somewhat of Budweiser but stronger. Not much else to say except that it's good if you like a cheap buzz. Steel Reserve was more impressive and Molson Canadian Lager is much better as well."
"Did I mention the alcohol? BURRRP."
"D - Pretty good for an ice beer. I'll take this over regular Bud any day. At least it's not watered down."
"when this came out ( i was 13, maybe?) i was seduced by the advertising...more alcohol, less flavor? hell yeah!!! had this more times than i care to remember as a kid. this beer really delivered on it's promise...a full .5-1% more abv and even less flavor than other macro lagers! how was this even possible? i probably owe getting laid a few times to the utter lack of taste in this beer..."
"Yeah pretty much one of those run of the mill American beers which I personally enjoy.Taste is your normal domestic lager.Decent flavor and feel until the last 2 watery gulps.Has a little bit more of a kick like most ice beers do.For the money I think this is a decent beer.I would recommend giving it a shot at times when your stash is low."
"Bud Ice was a pale yellow color and very clear. It had a white head that quickly dissipated to a ring with only a touch of lace. There was not much at all going on the aroma department. The taste was grainy and not at all pleasing. It was light bodied with lots of carbonation. Drinkability was not very good either and this beer is not recommended."
"Overall: Decent overall. A decent choice for those looking for a slightly higher ABV offering of their favorite macro swill."
"I would recommend this beer to those who like Plank Road brewery."
"If your looking for a beer to sip and marvel at taste with...this isn't it. But if you don't feel like spending much money and want to start off the day mowing the lawn with a brew dag, then this one is good enough. Only a decent taste at first, but after a few and you will start to like the taste a little more. It's decent for your domestic macro brewery."
"The taste is, well, Bud. Macro grains and rice, a sour, fizzy finish, and maybe a hint stronger than regular Bud. Mouthfeel is thin, carbonated. Drinkability; no thanks. I honestly drank it because my friend had nothing else. This is bad, even for macros. I'd rather drink Bud Light; at least that has less flavor."
"The beer was another pale straw yellow macro color with a (you guessed it) small head of white foam that just dissipated away in a matter of a nanosecond. The aroma was that of Ice with some rice in the background. Can Ice be an aroma? It is if you're talking about this beer. Taste? You might get a miniature amount of Ice, rice, and other grains. One time I thought I had tasted some juicy fruits in this, but I could have been day dreaming at the time. There was no mouthfeel, unless you count drinking water as something. I don't, so no. If it's the cheapest beer at a bar and I don't feel like spending extra $$$ for a better beer, then I would give it another go. It would make a good alternative if bottled water prices would skyrocket through the roof."
"Drink-Ability: Not very drinkable at all. I do not recommend this Ice beer. There are better oneÂ’s out there."
"This beer is right in line with the style. Really as far as mass produced brews go, most are similar. I bought this tonight for the ride home. No need to worry, I was riding shotgun. There's just something about a nice tall boy in a paper sack on a country backroad after dark. This beer is fine for that. Actually, I don't think you would want to redneck it too much with a barleywine. A lighter beer in a sack serves this purpose pretty good."
"The drinkability of ok. Good for a hot day when you can't find good water or you have had too much water. MK"
"Get my buzz on- n"
"Bud Ice pours a pale straw color with a thin white head froma clear, faceted twelve ounce bottle. Smell is grainy. The taste is also grainy, maybe some cooked vegetabe flavors, with a very clean finish, with perhaps a bit of sweetness. Nothing too offensive, yet not worth looking for."
"This beer is a little stronger than regular Budweiser but it is only one- half percentage point higher so donÂ’t let this fact scare you away from trying Bud Ice. The bland, boring taste is enough reason not to waste your time. It stands as yet another example of a below average ice brewed beer."
"Average macro, and much better than a lot of Anheuser-Busch's brews. If you like malty macros with a slight kick, try one."
"Otherwise, it seems pretty much the same. It's sweet like Bud without becoming cloying, and still offers the signature yeastiness of a kiss of light apple. It's fairly well-balanced and surprisingly drinkable while cold."
"Drinkability - Definately drinkable and a better choice than most lowest-rung macros. Definetely should suffice for college parties. Could use more flavor though."
"This beer is more refined than lesser ice beers, and could possible be one of the best ice beers I tried, comperable to icehouse possibly."
"It looks like what you would expect from an american macro lager. Golden yellow in color with a small white head. The smell is faint. The taste has an akwardly sweet bready flavor. Almost reminds me of a cinnamon roll. Nothing that reminds me of beer, not even bad beer. Huh, I wonder if my taste buds are off today or if bud ice always tastes this unusual. Pretty lame. It gets better after a few, but it doesnt ever get ""good"". I guess its worth it if your looking to catch a good buzz, but this beer doesnt have much else to offer."
"Pours a color kin to concentrated urine or apple juice to be polite forms a white overly carbonated head leaves thin lacing. Smells of cereal grains clean overall touch of chemically engineered hop aroma and evident alcohol with that whopping .5% increase in abv. Flavors more cereal grains pretty much malt liquor flavor to it clean sweetness mild tame bitterness no real hop flavor bland overall. Mouthfeel has a light body heavy carbonation not too smooth folks. Drinkability well when drinking in my hometown there are limited options I figured I should sneak a review in, not reaching for another anytime soon."
"Poured from 12oz. bottle to pint glass creating one inch head, short-lived. Yellow straw color, absolutely clear with no cloudiness. Smell is very... processed. I'm not sure how to put my finger on it, just super clean and processed like most all other macro brew lagers. This is especially true with this brew. The taste... to be really honest, it's fun. It's tacky, you know what you're getting from the beginning, and it does the job well. It may be watered down, it may not have the hops or the malt characters to set it apart from, well anything, but what I found to be the attractive aspect was just being fun to drink. Like watching COPS or Jerry Springer almost, you feel like white trash, but hey it's fun right? It's refreshing and crisp, and you can take out a lot in one sitting, so points for that."
"Poured a plae yellow crystal clear color with large white puffy head. Smell is minimal, but not unpleasant, being maily of a slightly sweetish character. Taste is also very mild, With a slight maltiness and no hops. Finishes a bit on the sweet side with rapidly disappearing flavor. Good spacer, but a little too high alcohol."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a clean and crisp pale malt and adjunct scent that is a bit husky and dry. The taste is average as well. It is dry and musty with a light pale malt flavor as well as a clean finish. It goes down easy with a slightly skunky aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an average macro lager. There is little flavor and almost no aroma, but it drinks well. The bonus with ice beers is the quicker buzz. It's the only bright side."
" Pours a pale golden color with a fizzy white head that full-on vanishes after about 1 minute. Serious carbonation just keeps on coming - fizzy, fizzy beer. Not much to the nose, besides some adjunct malt and a touch of astringency. The palate follows - there's just not much to it. A bit of adjunct malt, some light honey-ish sweetness. Body is very fizzy. I will say this - it's easy to put back a lot of this stuff. Still, it's just not a very good experience. Pass on it."
"This beer has a similar taste (or lack thereof) of Bud Light, but with more graininess and bite in the sides and back of the toung. Less malt sweetness and hop character than most Macro brews.Highly carbonated and slightly increased alcohol masks the flavors and numbs the palate. Graininess is left in the aftertaste and not much else."
"I don't know why, but A-B products usually give me an instant headache after a mere sip or two. Thankfully this one did not. Unfortunately, it brought upon a wicked stomach ache about halfway through the brew instead."
"Pours a clear gold with a two finger head that will vanish completely in less than 20 seconds and leave no lacing. Typical budweiser faint rice and grain smell, with some apple ester. Harsh grain and fusel aftertaste. A more fuller body than expected of an american macro, and only slightly crisp. ""Ice"" has the addition of a sweeter, malt liquor flavor and mouthfeel. Goes down hard, but at least there is something to taste besides adjunct."
"I give a bonus point for the bottle design: they used clear glass, but it is still one of the very most creative design for a US macro I saw."
"Drinkability: IÂ’m not sure why I used to like this stuff back in college. I think itÂ’s because it was different, had a cool bottle and had more alcohol. Now that I drink for taste, I doubt IÂ’ll ever buy this beer again. ThereÂ’s nothing to this beer except a bottle full of brewing shortcuts."
"Wow. I didn't think A-B could brew a beer worse than Bud Light. 12 oz, ""born on"" 4/8/05 - served ice cold in a mug. Pours an extremely fizzy piss-yellow with a 2 finger head that leaves a small amount of lacing. There is a slight hint of a semi-nice aroma while pouring, but afterward it is lots of metal with perhaps a bit of skunk. I'm wincing at the thought of drinking this. I tasted absolutely nothing on the first sip. By the end there is a trace of malts and hops but this is essentially yellow carbonated water with some alcohol. Hard to finish this one - I couldn't even imagine making this a session beer."
"Pale yellow color with a lot of carbonation bubbling from the bottom of the glass. Big fizzy head at first and then nothing buy a thin lace after that. Smells clean with some cooked corn. The mouth feel is thin with a sizzle on the tounge from the carbonation. The taste is waterdown with a cooked grain and light hoppiness. Watery aftertaste. There is really no point in this beer but a cheap buzz. But I must say I have had much worse."
"Well, it is yellow, and it doesn't have much of a head. There isn't any aroma to speak of, so I wasn't offended by the aroma, but there was nothing to like about the aroma either. Flavor is pretty bland as well some grain flavor, maybe a hint of hops, but not much going on. Mouthfeel is actually pretty good. Thick for the style. There's a lot of better Macro Lagers out there, but there are also alot worse."
"Not the worst beer ever, but very close. Sample #16 at Radekfest 05 to change the pace. No colour, high liquor smell, taste of grass and lemon in water left a long time with cheap soda water, not quaffable. Keep it very cold like vodka. On second thought, have a vodka."
"This beer appeared in my fridge for some reason. I swear I didnÂ’t buy it. I poured this 12 ounce bottle into my Duvel glass, because I thought the incongruity might be funny. This glass usually holds a head very well, but the head on this beer was gone in seconds, leaving an unattactive, pale yellow liquid in my glass. There is a hint of aroma, but the flavor is terrible. A little bit of sweetness with nasty off flavors and no hops. I did not find this beer to be easy to drink Â– too bubbly."
"-Enjoy [RrrrÂ…?]"
"In the end, it all comes down to preference. Neither one of these is particularly good beer, but I do like the Natural Ice better because I feel that the mild sweetness improves the flavor slightly and improves the body to some extent. The extra sugar might also limit drinkability if one chose to pound more than a few, but I'll never be drunk enough to do something so stupid. This side by side comparison was more than enough, thank you."
"Overall- a step above Natty Ice, a smooth beer to get drunk quick and have fun with your frat brothers. In terms of taste and hops and many other factors it leaves much to be desired. But for a smooth quick buzz go here, for just about any other occasion pick something else."
"If you're going to drink cheap beer, you may as well drink this shit."
"The beer as it sallies forth from the 12-ounce clear bottle sets in the glass a faded gold color with a moderate frothy head that is white in color and the residual lace a thin sheet to seal off the glass. Nose is typical lager, crisp and clean with the start somewhat sweet and the grain profile weak, top is cadaverous in feel. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops meek and the aftertaste dry as a desert bone, been a little over four years since I sampled this beer and as I like to review beers on occasion, this one I should have missed."
"Drinkablility in the can must be a little less than in the bottle. Yeah, it was a good cold macro beer but the AB flavor is one I don't care for anymore."
"The color is mild yellow as you can see through the clear bottle. We bought this back in college because the bottle looked kind of cool...well to a college kid it did. I don't get hangovers but I could feel one coming on after just half a bottle of this. Too much carbonation combined with a sweet but not too satisfying flavor. That alcohol taste you get with high gravity lagers such as Camo and Steel Reserve 211 follows almost immediately after the initial taste. Yes, that taste that seems like somebody dropped a really bad shot of vodka into your beer. I would pass on this beer. Instant hangover in a bottle."
"Drinkability - too carbonated for me, the bubbles will catch up to you in the morning if you make a session of these. Not bad, just not my style even if I am feeling effects after one 24-ouncer."
"A heavy pour and got a three-fingered white head that faded quickly to a ring leaving no lace. Clear golden color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Starts with a sweetness, the alcohol is noticeable, maybe that's what gives it some flavor, better than a regular Budweiser but really just a good lawnmower beer. $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"I could drink more of this than some others, like regular Budweiser, but I wouldn't want to if I could avoid it."
"It goes down smooth, though. In high school this is what the kids would get in 40s in order to get drunk really fast. So, if you're a high schooler or any other type of low-life alcoholic then this is the beer for you. Otherwise, steer clear."
"this beer tastes bad, but bad taste coupled with memories make for a truely heinous beer. this beer is yellower than the darkest piss i ever seen. this beer has but 1 purpose, to get you drunk the fastest, and leave you hung over like ted kennedy. the taste is there and then it's not but when it is there it's not good. this visions of my friends brother uninating in public, shouting racial slurs, threatening to kill people, shooting fireworks at buildings, engaging in rediculos conversation and making statements that would make president clinton blush have tainted my feelings about this beer even moreso than the bad flavor, stupid bottle can."
"I have to admit, i don't like AB products all that much, but this one hit a note in me. Strong overtones of corn, hops and alcohol, this brew went down very smoothly to my suprise. Short aftertaste of hops, and medium carbonation are the highlights of this beer. A good entry level brew for those looking to try an Ice Beer."
"Taste was more than i was expecting. More corn maybe? Wait, its the alcohol! Nothing offensive about this other than the company who makes it. Bland."
"After so many ""ICE"" beers died, I'd be curious to see where they sell this one well."
"Drinkability is acceptable. Tastes better than it should, it is Budweiser concentrated to the point of actual flavor."
"Not a good beer, even if you get it cheap"
"When I give it a high rating in appearance, I only meant because of the cool bottle it was in. Other then that, it was very light, and almost tasted to me like some really flat Budweiser. I'm not too crazy about this beer, it is decent, but another not so good Anheuiser-Busch product. I'd still drink if however if nothing else was available."
"Light gold color with a tiny white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of corn and cereal. Tastes sweet and grainy, with almost no trace of hops. A little malt flavor. It is a little stronger than Budweiser, so I would get this instead (you have to drink less of it...)"
"Its drinkable but I cant wait to get my paycheck next week..this has been a sobering expierience ..which has taught me to always go with quality over quantity."
"This is easily the most drinkable ice beer I have ever had. It did not have much flavor to srart out with other than grain and corn, but the taste was smoothe and not to intrusive. This is definantly a beer to get wasted on and not to seriously drink. Bud dry is much better as far as an AB beer goes. But if I were you, I'd stick to the Sierra Nevada's or Stone's of the world if you want new exciting beers! Cheerz"
"It is hard to find anything to criticize about Bud Ice, simply because there is so little flavor. It is hard for seltzer to be offensive. So processed was this beer that it retained very little beer qualities. Thin, a touch of malt and hops, and that is pretty much it. It made the Stroh's I had been drinking look like an IPA. Even when an insipid beer fits the bill, this one can't measure up."
"Comments Â– Sorry for the short review, but this one was uninspiring to say the least, causing a severe case of writerÂ’s block. I donÂ’t know what to say Â– it was Â“blah.Â”"
"Sure, it's nothing grand, but it shouldn't be on the 50 worst beers! I like this one on a cheap night, when I have hardly any money since I am in college. I don;t usually drink to get drunk, because it is rather barberic, but if you wanna do it for cheap, this is the way to go. The smell is pretty basic, but with a tinge of alcohol. The taste it simialr. Nothing else needs to be said."
"Notes: Don't drink."
"I guess if I was hot and thirsty it would be a toss-up between this and a bottle of water. Otherwise I wouldn't bother. I actually like this more than other Bud products because it doesn't have any of that horrid corn/rice/weak hops flavor. I'm still not sure why I felt like watching NASCAR while drinking this."
"Pours a yellow straw amber with a white head. Tastes almost like a generic bud, but not quite. It has that grain thing going on with that sweetness and that well... stop. This is really a nothing tasting beer. Why fight it? One of the worst ice brews out there. Drinkable? Maybe, but there are many better ice brews out there."
"I just keep trying to find an A-B brew that doesn't taste the same as Bud, one of the beers I just can't find a way to like. The look, smell, amd marketing are all formula standard. Completely the picture is that hateful Bud taste, with all that worst grain sense."
"How can I review a beer so horrible, It's macrogarbage at its worst. I don't even care to think about how bad this is, one taste will tell you, damn what am I thinking and drinking. Stick to WATER as with all AB products, it doesn't matter which beer it is Dry, Ice, Original, or Light. They are all lousy and of poor quality and that born on date doesn't matter if you drank it from the brewery itself."
"The body is a watery copper/golden color with absolutely no head. Smells of sugary malts and rice come to the nose. Tatse is the same but extremely light. Extremely dry finish and very watery and thin body. But, if you can drink hard water you can drink this."
"Hohum....acceptable brew but nothing more....good colour and has a nice glass cling but taste is marginal and the body is a bit heavy. Well balanced but leaves you lacking....dry after taste is persistant....I would not recomend this brew to anyone without a brown paper bag....."
"Small bubbly head, whitish, awful retention, some laceÂ… light amber-golden hue. Indistinguishable noseÂ… nothing at all, way too clean. Bafflingly plain taste, very faint hints of sweetness coupled with equally difficult to detect bitterness. Harsh yet watery. The sweetness inflames as it warms. Unsophisticated, designed for a quick buzzÂ… not what I am looking for in a beer. Skip itÂ… not recommended at all."
" Not a good choice for drinking leaves a bad taste in your mouth , stick with bud!"
"When you want to get drunk, this is what you drink. Tastes like piss but goes down easy. A real party beer, but thats it. Kind of scary that I once associated with people who thought this was the best stuff out there. Hey, atleast the commercials were great."
"a cheap beer popular in high school and college parties. a little higher in alcohol than the other american beers. to me, that rice brewing is just not right. it is almost unbearable to smell let alone drink."
"Nose is a chemical bitter mix with some cloy sweet notes that would gag a maggot, so its better to drink this stuff than to use it as an after shave. If youÂ’ve got to drink it then just drink it, smelling it is not an option."
"This is my father's version of a ""heavy"" beer, so he usually has some around when I go visit him. It does have an attractive pale yellow color, unlike some other macros that look too yellow for my tastes because they remind me of urine. It did have a slight aroma that was pleasant but faint. The taste is barely drinkable after it warms even a touch, so drink it cold if you must drink it. Feels like carbonated water and the aftertaste prevents me from drinking very many of them. Often times I pass on them when dad offers. In college we used to say ""any beer is better than no beer."" I'm not sure I can say that today."
"This is what you want if you want to get drunk. It taste like piss but goes down fairly easy and makes a great party beer. That is about all it is though. If you want to get trashed and not drink hard liqour then this is your beer. If there is any other reason, then don't drinkt it."
"If you burn your mouth on hot pizza, or better yet, are a flame eater, this beer is good. Either that, or have someone urinate in your mouth. You probably won't tell the difference. Dooby dooby doo."
"No surprises here. You get exactly what you pay for. Unfortunately, this was the best beer on tap at the two closest bars to my new residence (I have just moved to hell!). Light yellow in color and lacking a head, this beer smelled a little grainy and corn-sweet. No real hop character to this one. A little bit of sweet taste and a ton of carbonation. It's light body allows one to drain a mug very quickly. After that mug is done, order a better beer, if you can!"
"I'm sure everyone here knows what ice beer is (brewed at cold temperatures, ice crystals removed, higher alcohol, yada yada), so I will get right to my review.  The 6 pack of bottles I bought were a couple of days older than recommended, and seeing as how the bottles were clear, I feared some skunkage.  Not so.  It poured a light gold/straw color (darker than Bud and Bud Light), and actually produced a decent, but fizzy head that lasted about a minute.  I sniffed it, and there was no skunkiness.  It was a very clean smell, a little on the sweet side, probably from the adjuncts.  I sipped it: very watery feel, and somewhat sweet taste.  No bitterness, but some slight alcohol warmth in my stomach.  After the first few sips, the rest went down like beer flavored water.  I find it hard to hate this beer because it is so lacking in taste.  Probably a good beer to get drunk to seeing how it goes down easily and has increased alcohol, but after 1 bottle, I started feeling the birth of a headache that is so commonly associated with Bud products.  Overall, not entirely bad stuff, and quite refreshing.  Just a little lacking in the flavor department.  Doobie doobie doo..."
"Its an ice beer.  Hasn't the ice beer fad gone away yet?  Pours out to a light golden color, with a fast disappating head.  Taste is very light, with heavy carbination.  Very little hop taste.  I can see these being chugged easily (due to lack of taste/body).  Maybe good out of a funner/beer bong, but not something to sit and enjoy."
"Pale yellow, clear, almost light off color water.  Extremely carbonated with quickly vanishing head.  Smell is almost non existent at cold temperatures. Once warming the beer smells slightly of hopps and grain.  Taste is similar to regular Budweiser with a slightly more bitter hoppiness pared with a more pronounced alcohol flavor.  Not much better if at all than the rest of their lineup."
"Hey, it's ice beer. It's a little better than Nattie Ice too. The entire point of ice beer is too kick the crap out of you in a shorter amount of time. Bud Ice does its job."
"wow, they made beer with no taste, great stuff. i would rather drink the regular bud, but i still wouldn't want to do that. BLAAAAAHHH!"
"Coming soon - Bud Dry Ice. A can that releases clouds of fog when opened. Pop open a case and pretend you're at a Kiss concert."
"Ice Beer, is it really special?  Many people seem to think so. What is Ice beer? It is malt liquor dropped to freezing then the ice is removed so what remains is a much stronger malt liquor. Ice beer is for people who don't really like beer but they want to get drunk faster I suppose. Here is another fine example of a crappy beer from the ""King of Crap Beer""  Anheuser-Busch, Inc."
"Notes: Somewhat hard to coax down, there are better and easier drinking American Ice beers out there. Some breweries should stick with what they do best and some beer drinkers should stick to what they can drink without making a face."
