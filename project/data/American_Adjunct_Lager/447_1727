The aroma is of some yeast and grassy hops. Pretty much is said for the taste also. Goes down easy and a semi-dry finish. No harsh or bitter aftertaste. Lighter-bodied with good carbonation. Overall, I actually liked this one as I never had it before. Refreshing and would be even better for the warmer months.","BeerWithMike","Apr 01, 2015"

I guess they recently implemented a krausening process the last few years that helps the flavor. I can't speak for that since i did not try this beer prior to that process, but others seem to think it has made a big difference. Very enjoyable beer on a warm day. If you like adjunct american lagers (not my style but they serve their purpose), don't waste your time with bud, miller, or coors. Go with this bad boy.","Bosoxfan20","Mar 11, 2013"

Smell is so clean it reminds me of fabric softener, and I swear I am get a floral whiffs. That smell has to be coming from somewhere else. Anyway, smells interesting for such a beer.

This is the first beer I ever tasted, my Dad would very occasionally drink one of these, IF he ever drank beer, and I just remember how awful beer tasted, and it kinda still does, all do respect, this one is better smelling believe it or not than tasting, and it is smooth and not as carbonated as it appears which begs the next question.

This beer did leave mild lacing down the glass, which surprised me. The aroma was biscuity, there was a definite yeasty sent to it. The typical corn syrup aroma was there but is definitely toned down. The taste, all in all, is slightly bland even for a Macro lager. This so far is the best mouthfeel of a Macro Lager I've had. This beer finishes astoundingly dry with a big carbonation kick that tingles the back of my mouth (is that possible?) Due to the mouthfeel more than anything because of its dry finish, this beer leaves you wanting more. It's just dry enough to make you think you're still thirsty for another.

3,8.3,3,3,3,3,3,"A very average American Lager, but surprisingly, it has some malt taste to it with just a hint of hops.  A nice, quirst-quencher. I am sure the fine folks of Chicago still drink enough of this to keep the brand alive.","proc","Dec 14, 2001"
3,8.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Surprisingly not-bad for a cheap beer.  Slightly sweet front, fairly flat middle and a somewhat astringent, citric finish.  Some wine-like characteristics.  One of the better slammers.","Brent","Sep 10, 2001"
