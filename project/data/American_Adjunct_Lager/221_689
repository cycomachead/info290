It's light, but what is there is far from bad; certainly a few steps up from a glass of plain, flavorless, alcohol-free water.  This is definitely a "mealtime beer" rather than a "have one beer at the end of the day" beer.  If you feel like having two or three lighter beers with some good food rather than one strong, flavorful beer as a meal unto itself, Red Stripe fills that role nicely... and I can definitely imagine this being a good beer to have around when the weather's a bit warmer and you're chowing down on some sweet and spicy Caribbean-style food.  I may have to revisit this one when it warms up a bit, and I'll definitely have to remember to make sure to have a few "at the source" if I ever end up visiting Jamaica at some point.","Pantalones","Feb 23, 2015"

I have had this beer numerous times since I began drinking and at first I thought it was good, but I had not really started drinking great beer at that point. The last few times I have tried this one its been a disappointment. It has this strange wine-like back flavor that I just cant get used to. Its like a sour fruit taste, very much like a cheap wine, less beer flavor. Maybe if I drank it in Jamaica it would taste better but overall I would much rather have a domestic or Mexican adjunct lager over this lager.

Anyway, I put that aside and poured me one of these little bottles and hoped for the best. Well, it wasn't entirely bad, but it wasn't spectacularly good, either. This little brew does have a nice dark, golden hue to it that is very appealing. It pours a nice pillowy white head with little staying power, but the lacing sticks around pretty good. The smell was disappointing - almost skunky, but not quite. Mouthfeel was very, very carbonated with a slightly sticky aftertaste. I did, however, enjoy the full-bodied flavor the lager - not watery or plain hoppy or yeasty. Overall, it was okay, but I still feel a bit cheated by the smaller bottles... :)","jjamadorphd","May 16, 2014"

It's pours a typical straw color with an unimpressive head. The bottle design is sleek. The smell is of corn and grain, and the taste follows, with a lot of grain and some straw in there. The beer is light, and almost as light as a light beer. The bottom line though is that this is just barely decent and isn't offensive at all. It's a mild beer intended for sunny days and spicy food, both of which Jamaica has plenty of.","DeFaz","Feb 20, 2014"

I still dig the bottles a lot. A light gold color, a hair darker than many other AALs, with ample white foam and an aroma full of doughy sweet lager malt, a tangy fruitiness, and grassy mystery hops. An old colleague used to describe this beer as tasting like "lawn clippings" and I must say I don't entirely agree. I was surprised by the rather moderate carbonation (for the style, relatively speaking ... Its still fizzy!) and fairly smooth mouthfeel. Does not sear the tongue with scrubbing bubbles. Rather sweet, with the aforementioned doughy malt, fruity hard candy notes, sweet clover hay (I dunno, fairly fragrant but not quite bright green grass as per my colleague's review), subdued nondescript citrus rind, and a fizzy lingering "bite", put in quotes to emphasize that this brew is tangy but not exactly biting per se. I remember this as less sweet in the past ... The finish is on the crisp and dry side of course but the sugars do linger. Not too bad as a summer guzzler but of course typically fetches import prices.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 18, 2014"

I find it to not be my favorite beer, but occasionally I get some to enjoy (especially if it's on sale). I just got a case the other day and wanted to review it. I enjoy the appearance, the iconic bottle makes it fun, but it presents well in a glass also. The head is rich, and it has a bright crisp first taste. It tends to linger on the tongue just a second too long, but it just brings back warm memories. Its not a beer I'd want to slam back after mowing the lawn, but I do enjoy it with some spicy foods or a nice fish taco.","jjpadd","Dec 28, 2013"

APPEARANCE: pale golden body with disparate bubbles rising intermittently; two-finger head settles out to a semi-foamy froth that holds stronger than expected... AROMA: a metallic ping flicks the nostrils while corn and syrupy sugars pungently remind me this is a watered-down lager... PALATE: thin, slightly oily; easy drinking, if not for the...TASTE: whoo, haven't had this in a while, and I recall what happens when sentiment is sifted from the senses: sentiment is "this is the fun shore beer that is sold by that cool Jamaican dude in the TV ads"; the senses say "this is a funky hay-worn adjunct that has minimal profile beyond the sweet forty-ounce malts that wrestle the tongue".... OVERALL: Tough to distinguish this lager from any other mass-produced pilsner, save for the cute bottle and Jamaican locale--and even that is untrue, as the label sports Old Latrobe as its brewing and bottling site; as the second beer of the night, a mouth rinser that is little more than a cheap summer uplift...","dacrza1","Aug 09, 2013"

You could be forgiven for not realising this is beer; the malt is barely there and hops seem to be completely absent. Some nasty solvent undertones in the aroma/flavour. A dull, sub-par macro. Take my advice and avoid this - your money can be spent on better things.","jazzyjeff13","Jan 28, 2013"

3.16,6.8,4,3,3,4,3,"The beer pours a very clear yellow, like dehydrated piss and a big old white head on top that stays awhile and is fed constantly by a torrent of carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of slightly skunked grains, cereal and bread notes, with a little grassy and hay-like scent from the hops. The smell is clean except for the slight skunked notes. On the tongue the beer tastes sweetly biscuity with nice grass and hay notes. It shares some flavor characteristics with European pilsners. The beer begins with light hay notes and a little bit of funk, and then opens into sweet biscuit and hay notes and a slight skunk taste that sits below everything. The aftertaste is of light skunked malts and grassy hops. The mouth is left clean except for a slight lingering of the skunky/grassy taste in the mouth. The beer is thin and clean on the tongue, making the beer extra drinkable. Overall, this isn’t a terrible beer. It’s a little skunked, and definitely weak in flavor, but it’s not horribly flavored. A Jamaican pounding beer, I guess.","Maxwell","Dec 31, 2012"

The flavor isn't all that interesting; a lingering maltiness that isn't hard to find among the common import stand by's, but the real strength of this beer is the carbonation. If you are looking for a refreshing bubbly beer suitable for BBQ's and other hot outdoor activities this will do the trick. Don't overspend on this one though, at 15 bones or more a 12 pack you might be better off finding a lesser substitute.","Grahamenstein","Dec 04, 2012"

Tons of sweet grains, Along with some cooked vegetables/ More corn adjunct than anything within the veggie section. The mouthfeel is of sweet grains, sugar, and corn adjunct.

The taste too is pretty typical of an adjunct lager. There isnt much there but it is pretty crisp and relatively clean with only a bit of a skunky, vegetable like flavor. There is a bit of hop bitterness in the finish and the carbonation is medium to high. Along with the bitterness at the end there is a touch of sweetness. Overall it's a bit better than average for the style in that it is a bit more well rounded than the typical adjunct lager and it seems to offer a bit more to the senses.","fank2788","Apr 20, 2012"

3.7,25,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"this beer is a lager from jamaica that I had not tried before until now. I thought it was a trash beer from the appearance of how common it is. I really liked the hoppiness of this beer. It has a predominantly white head which is actually smaller than a lot of the beers ive been drinking lately. the beer has a light appearance like a regular lager. I can smell hops in this beer just as much as I can taste them. it is a nice bold hoppy beer. it goes down not as smooth as something like Bud light lime. I really liked this beer just because of the hoppy taste. I really enjoy beers with the bitterness of hops just like Red Stripe and beers like Sam adams boston lager. the reason this beer is not rated higher because I like a beer with a little more characteristics other than just a hoppy lager. I will definitely drink this again.","phenomenologian","Nov 28, 2011"

If it was creating a clean, crisp, drinkable beer with more flavor than your standard American macro lager, they failed. If its goal was to as cheaply as possible mass produce a generic adjunct lager then add a sugary sweetness to make it different so they could call it Jamacian and charge more money, they probably succeeded.","zac16125","Oct 08, 2011"

Pours a light golden hue with a very small quickly receding white head that lingers due to an imense fountain of carbonation. Smell is light grains bit of citrus in the nose. Taste is crackery grain with a small zest of citrus hops that is brought about by the bright carbonation. Mouthfeel is very clean and light almost efforvescent with the amount of carbonation. Overall this is not an overly complex beer, it pairs pretty well with cajun and jerk or spicy cuisine and is a far step ahead of the big lagers of the US.","rpardon7","Aug 24, 2011"

Smell is of grains and corn flakes primarily. Taste is of sweet grains and corn flakes, grass/hay, and some very mild citrus flavors on the finish. A mild bitterness makes itself known on the palate after each sip. This beer has a decent level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good adjunct lager with better than average smells and tastes.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 11, 2011"
3,1.4,3,3,3,3,3,"24 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. Aroma is lightly sweet, the brew smells like sweet malt and grain/adjuncts. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but there's the addition of some light hops which helps lead to a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel/body is light, and it's crisp and well carbonated. It's also smooth and easy to drink, which is a good thing on a hot day like this. For the style of beer this is, it isn't bad at all. I'm not sure if I would pay $2.19 for a bottle of this again anytime soon, but there are certainly worse choices out there.","bluejacket74","Aug 04, 2011"

As it warms, it gets vegetal. Drink it cold. Ice cold. The mouthfeel is nice, it's very effervescent and goes down easily. The drinkability is good, but no better than the style. This is a better than average AAL for sure, but it's nowhere worth the 8.49 a sixer seems to demand in the area when I can pick up a 24oz can of Genny Cream for a buck and enjoy it just as much.","shand","Jul 07, 2011"

Mouthfeel is bubbly and light. This beer is very refreshing and easy to drink, I could easily see a sixer going down quickly.

I was slightly taken back with the flavor, not quite the same as the smell. There is a sweet malt over a main flavor of wheat, with just a touch of hop. Well enough blend of flavor to keep me drinking. Grows in me as the temperature gets warmer and the alcohol takes effect.

The flavor is pretty much the same as the smell the corn/malt sweetness is then followed by a sharp bitterness that is honestly the only thing bad about the flavor. There is hints of breadiness from the yeast. The weird thing about this beer is that I honestly think that I can taste the alcohol in it, which is weird for a beer of lower ABV. The body is light as would be expected but the corn syrupiness isn't that pleasant. It's decently drinkable.

Red Stripe has also been one of my standbys, something to drink when there's nothing else around or no other real options when I'm at a restaraunt or bar. Pours a light straw with some mild carbonation. Volumous head that doesn't last very long. Light cereal aroma, not much else going on. Great mouthfeel, the beer isn't overly carbonated. Mild cereal notes yield to a super crisp and super clean finish. There's a reason I've enjoyed this beer for so long. I'm not a fan of lagers really, particularly light lagers, so a beer like this really has to work to impress me. Red Stripe does that. I'm always worried that I'm going to get the bitterness or skunkiness that I find in some of the macro beers or in the green bottle European styles, but it's always crisp, fresh, and clean.

Hey, call me a sissy, but this was a fizzy, golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity and I was looking forward to it. The nose was sweet, rich with cereal adjuncts. Hey, if you want the CANQuest to review better beers, send/trade me for some. In the meantime, I am becoming eminently familiar with the style. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with the characteristic lager sweetness offset by adjuncts. Frankly, if you have tried one, you CAN rest easy if there are others you may have missed.

The nose has lots of corn syrup, pretzel dough, cereal grains, semi-sour nature to the apricot, apple scents, some spice and wet minerally earth comes through with a big swirl inside the glass. Medium-bodied, more heavy than dense, front-loaded into the mouth entry, declining from there. The carbonation is flat-footed and can't seem to get anything moving. The malts add smoothness to the texture but not only minimal sweetness. The seems mostly to come from the corn, grains and apricot, pear, apple fruit.

Tasting it side by side even with some of the macro faux-crafts such as Michelob amber bock have displayed that Red Stripe, in fact, is vastly tastier and more enjoyable than that garbage. Compared to Michelob amber particularly is interesting because it brings out Maibock-like characteristics in the red stripe, a noticeable caramel malt presence.. blindly tested, I would guess Red Stripe was the bock. Essentially, in a world where we didn't have the beer market flooded with garbage, this sort of beer should be whats considered your average C.

It doesn't have that corn/grass/metal/rice stink and flavor of your typical Budweiser-like beers. It's actually pretty good.

There is this somewhat heavy slick biscuit idea going on with an odd corn syrup taste. It hints of the classic cereal but this is not too attractive. It has a very fine carbonation but is generally kind of flat. Although you might say this is somewhat refreshing, the syrupy grain flavor is kind of oppressive to me.

I don't think this one is oxidized, as this one really seems to have these qualities from the grainey character. The corn sweetness carries through lightly. This one is fairly flavorful, thoght I'd still like to see a kiss of hop. Feel is light with a light to moderate carbonation. This is what I expected.

The taste follows along the same lines, not completely offensive, but not overly appealing either. Sweet corn and malt up front, a bit grainy and husky in the middle, with a surprising lightly hopped aftertaste, although I'm assuming those are hops, as they just sort of creep in there under your nose. The mouthfeel goes from smooth and creamy to carbonated and mildly abrasive in a short amount of time, adding a bit of kick to the finish and aftertaste. Some Jekyll and Hyde action going on in that respect, but it doesn't detract from the experience.

Whoa, it gets worse. Dimethyl sulfide plays a significant role in this beer's flavor profile. A bit of diacetyl, too, shameful in a lager. There's a moderate maltiness, a light floweriness in the finish and it's carbonated; that's about as positive of a spin as I can put on this beer.

Not too light so it's a piss yellow, but a decent lager yellow. Bit of a head; I'd say less than a full finger. Lace sticks to the rim and slowly creeps down. Good smell. Dry hops, grass and barley. Bit of sulphur as well, though not much to turn it off. Nice, even balanced taste. Starts out with a mellow sweet malt and butter mix, ending with a bitter dry grass and hop aftertaste. Not WOW tasting, but I can't help but admire the balance. Mouthfeel is a bit astringent, thin. Not watery thin, but thin. Not bad, though. It's a very drinkable lager. One I'll buy again.

The mouthfeel is very fuzzy-almost cotton-like, but not in a good way (think cotton ball not cotton candy). Drinkablity on this one is largely dependent on the circumstances.

This lager starts a little oily and slightly bitter. It has a light body, and when it sinks into your tongue, you can taste sweet grapes and a gentle hint of wheat over more hop bitterness.

3.45,16.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"For some reason i love this as a band practice/watching tv beer. It's pretty cheap at like 6 bucks a sixer and pretty available. It comes in little fat bottles and pours a straw gold. it has a little skunk to it, but nothing like a heineken or becks etc. the smell isnt much but i get a touch of honey. the taste is pretty mellow, with a little touch of sweetness and i really enjoy the flavor, which is a bit odd and i can't quite place it. I know this brew hasn't recieved the highest of scores, but damn, I really do enjoy it. It's nothing amazing, but it is so drinkable that theres not much else id rather get if im going to just hang out and dont feel like going to a specialty liqour store to get something rare. So basically, they sell it at the corner store by my house, i enjoy the semi sweet odd flavor, it's pretty cheap and it isn't a beer that drinks like a meal so killing a 6 pack is very easy. I'll go out on a limb and say it, I like this beer.","DESTRO","May 24, 2003"

Towards the middle of the taste, citrus hop flavors appear, giving a quite refreshing quality. Finish is dry with a slight metallic bitterness.

Color is light gold, has an agressive, fine carbonation. The taste is very clean and light, a twinge of hoppiness, not much in the malt department. I didn't detect any skunkiness in the taste. The carbonation stings the lips, mouthfeel is very thin. I think this beer would probably be pretty refreshing on a really hot day, or with some spicy Jamaican jerk. I would view this as being perhaps a bit better than most macros, but basically in the same league. Not offensive, but not something I would drink very often.","LarryV","Feb 06, 2003"

The nose is a malty lemony shapness that mellows out as the beer sits. At first taste, the malt base over bears along with corn and rice present in the overall consumption. In the finish, I get some lemon grass hints of flavor that were very mellow. By no means is this worth the price, because last time I had seen a case it was around 30 bucks. No way could I ever invest in a case of this one. As far as Jamaican beer goes I want to find some Dragon Stout.","WVbeergeek","Jan 05, 2003"

Very faint malt flavor almost completely covered up by equally light sugary sweetness. Husky finish with some nice drying bittness. Beer was soft in the mouth from the tiny bubbles. Actually, looking in the glass you can only see four or five bubbles in the beer at any given moment after the beer has been poured for five minutes or so. The beer went very well with smoked pork ribs and spicy coleslaw. Definately an above average brew.","yen157","Dec 28, 2002"

The smell was also very faint, with a grassy malt smell somewhat detectable. The taste was crisp, and strong on malt sweetness. The finish was a little dry, like flat champagne, and tasted very acidic. It made my throat feel like I was drinking strong lemonade. The mouthfeel was adequate, but the finish was too dry. Drinkability was good, but not as a refreshing drink. I felt more parched after having this beer than before I started. However, I've never been a big lager fan. Good to try, and in this case a better alternative than Keystone Light.","aaronh","Dec 08, 2002"

The aroma had tones of malt and hops, a little spice, but faint. The taste was typical lager, light malt and hops were a little more pronounced. Again there was a bit of spice in the middle, might have been from the hops, but couldn’t pin it down. Crisp and clean. Average. I gave it a little extra on the appearance d/t the bottle shape.","Jarod","Dec 06, 2002"

A stoned (for real, not being stereotypic) resident of the town promised me that this is the Jamaican's 'liquid Viagra'. With a sell line like that it was hard for me to say no. I've had Red Stripe several times since. This beer has a sweet taste to it. Hops touch the tongue very very lightly. Not a fan of the bottle like some people; you can't fit as many in the fridge. Thrist quenching and would be good with something like burger. Not a bad beer, but I think this beer, like JW Dundee's Honey Brown, has an audience which would think more of it.

Hop bitterness is meager, and the malt graininess and funky corn sweetness dominate the flavor.  For a beer this light, it's pretty rough around the edges in flavor.  Finishes w/ a haylike dry graininess.  This isn't particularly good at all, but certainly isn't terrible.
