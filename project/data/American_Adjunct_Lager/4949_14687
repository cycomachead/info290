The worst thing about this beer though, is the aftertaste. I say this in a decent number of my reviews but it has an ""off"" bitterness. It's weird. It's unwelcome. It's gross. It's a metallic sort of bitterness that ruins an already pretty awful beer. Considering the 67 rating (which isn't bad by any means for an AAL), I'll have to just guess that this is a skunked bottle... it sure tastes and smells like one. Pass.","Alextricity","Jul 24, 2013"

I have no problem with this beer at all, a nice surprise from a champagne bar in Chicago.","StonedTrippin","Jul 08, 2013"

Flavor has a nice riding sweetness, alot of lemon notes actually in there. Finishes grassy with a kiss of hops. Overall refreshing great flagship mass produced lager from Espana. Estrella equals star but what is Damm? Mouthfeel is clean easy drinking sturdy carbonation, not over done.

Sweet grain and corn aroma, a bit fruity, mild grassy hops. The flavour was pretty basic, some sugary sweetness, cereal grains, with some cooked veggies and fruity hops in the background.

The flavors were parallel but a little better, a variation on the tradition macro stuff, it had more of a tart, crisp flavors than Budweiser Et. Al. and it was much more clean too. In this regard it was very 'bright,' summery and sessionable if you like the style. This was aided by the light carbonation and light body.
