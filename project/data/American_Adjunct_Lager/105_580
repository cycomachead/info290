Is it because Miller High Life is, was, and always will be the best party beer on the market?  You can bet your only can of ""Heady Topper"" it is.  Try drinking 12 cans of Heady Topper. I guarantee you will puke. Not so with High Life. Light, crisp, slight hop taste with a wet finish. Easily put away 12 of these babies with no sickness or bloated feeling. No headache. High Life deserves more credit. It taught us all how to drink beers.","JobiWanKenob","Thursday at 07:37 PM"

IT'S EASY DRINKING, AND, ICE COLD ON A HOT SUMMER DAY, IT'S HARD TO BEAT. FORMERLY, I HAD BEEN DRINKING BUD FOR YEARS, BUT I DECIDED THAT HIGH LIFE HAS A SMOOTHER FINISH. I WOULDN'T CALL IT THE 'CHAMPAGNE' OF BOTTLED BEER, MAYBE THE 'WINE SPRITZER'. THIS BRAND HAS BEEN AROUND FOR WELL OVER 100 YEARS, THOUGH, SURVIVING A PROHIBITION WHICH KILLED OFF THOUSANDS OF BEERS AND BREWERIES.

As it warms up though, it becomes pretty bad. Not ""warm"" warm, but basically as warm as the bottom of the bottle tends to be when you get down there. Luckily, they make grenades, those 7 ounce bottles, and this helps with that. I do prefer them in the smaller packaging, however, even in 12 ounce form they are cheap enough to dump out the last 2 or 3 ounces so its not a big deal.","kkleu357","Sep 25, 2014"

High Life is my go to for that.  The better version comes from the can, not the clear bottle.  It pours a nice golden yellow with a decent head that lingers for a couple of minutes, nice lacing.  It's somewhat sweet to the taste.  There is nothing offensive at all going on with the aroma, taste or mouthfeel, no off notes. Nothing exciting going on either  but it is a very drinkable brew for the type of beer it is.","riverlen","Sep 19, 2014"

I don't really know what to describe the taste like, just kind of like... corn? sweet. I drink this because i didnt have a job and was not able to buy more expensive things. I have read however this has won the gold medal for best american style lager several times. I think i know why they call this the high life though. It makes you feel like you are living the high life due to the taste and quality for the price. Their advertising campaigns hit the nail on the head. This is a testament to working men and women. I got paid my first paycheck recently and i bought some of this, and i felt like i was  drinking in style. This is better quality in my opinion than budweiser and its cheaper. There is a reason it rated highly in  american adjunct lagers, as you categorize them on the site. Apparently the Alstrom brothers on this site agree with me. They gave it an 81. I think miller is the best out of the as you guys on the site call them the macro brews. Whether its fishing or a barbeque or fourth of july party this  goes good with anything. I love this with a nice Hamburger and steak fries.","John9059","Sep 05, 2014"

For that purpose it does just fine. High Life is a tasty treat, abundant with corn. If you hate corn or corn-based beers, stay away! Very adjunct-y, mildly sweet, absolute zero bitter. No hops. This is one of my favorite beers because it's so cheap and it's still tasty. Where else can you get an 18 pack of bottles for $10 or a 30 pack of cans for $15? Or a 24 oz. for $1.49 for that matter??? Long live High Life!","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 31, 2014"

The color is pale straw with a big but fleeting head that gives way to minimum lacing.  The smell and taste are both dominated by adjuncts, but if cold enough the flavor is tolerable.  The carbonation level is good and the beer does feel rich in your mouth.  Overall one of the best in a generally poor class.","Retroman40","Aug 17, 2014"

If you compare this beer to a Belgian lambic or a graduate-degree level IPA, you're basically comparing Evil Dead to a Polanski film or something. They don't serve the same purpose, nor should they be judged by the same measuring stick. Now that those cards are on the table, I drank this High Life with hot dogs and watermelon while watching baseball. Perfect afternoon. It's not my favorite American budget lager - I'd certainly take 'Gansett or Pabst over this - but it's certainly better than Budweiser, and it's better than a poorly executed complex beer.","illpass78","Jul 27, 2014"

Heck ive been to the point where my local walmart was selling this stuff near the price of budweiser, and yes it was because budweiser was on sale. Im not going to say hate this beer, but for some reason it is so hard to kill, its like putting ur mouth up to a drain full of piss and saying "" Damn this stuff acutally gets you drunk"" It should be less than 9.79 a 12 pack. I understand the nice bottles, and the hot little blondie we all wish we could of Fuked in highschool was on the bottle but still its not that great of a beer. Would i buy it more? Probably not, because this beer makes me want to work overtime so i can get good beer. I love this beer thou still, cause it can provide me with a cheap buzz, and its better than keystone light, and coor by far. So im so undecide on what to go to. I guess all i can say is quit drinking and save ur money for some good stuff. Then you will appreciate beer more. I waste all my money on beer, and i suffer to drink this like you know who as well. Good luck, and god bless America :)","FukBeer","Jul 10, 2014"

Looking for a gateway beverage between malt liquor and craft beer? Grab a High Life 40. The semi-sweetness of the malt is very well balanced with the burn of the alcohol, making this one of the most drinkable 40's available.","Newrad2","Jul 08, 2014"

3.41,27.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"You have to drink this beer many times to really appreciate it because it is so unique compared to other beers out there today. This is a unique take on old school American lager beer. This beer brand has been around since 1903. Before it was called High Life it was just called Miller Beer dating back to the mid nineteenth century. High Life is one of the best values in the beer world. It costs $7.99 a twelve pack all over town. This used to be Miller's flagship brand (think Budweiser or Coors Banquet) until they decided to abandon it for MGD. Now it is a budget beer like Busch or Rolling Rock. It is just as drinkable as those beers, but it has more character. That character can be off-putting if you fail to understand what you are really drinking. This is an adjunct lager. This in the granddaddy of adjunct lagers. It has corn in it. That is the style. For a corn beer this is very good. It is meant for ice cold drinking. You do not slowly sip one of these at a time at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. You drink several of these at a time... ice cold. That is the High Life. For that purpose this beer is outstanding. The value is there. The taste is there. The approachability is there. Comparable to PBR and similar brews.","FrozenJoe","Jun 19, 2014"

2.48,-7.5,3,2.5,2.25,3,2.5,"Pours a pale, transparent straw yellow color, with a fizzy/foamy white head. The aroma is the expected grassy, musty hops over a lightly sweet malt base. The flavor is largely driven by sweet, grainy malts and a bit of a sweet corn character, although the dull, musty hops can be identified as well. As with most in this style, the light body and fizzy carbonation help this one go down easy, but it has more substance/body than others. In this regard, this beer is not much different than the other mass-produced adjunct lagers, but it doesn't come across as so watery and bland as others. Overall, its a fine beer to wash down a hot dog or any other situation where you just need a dumb beer, but it's certainly not something to crave and savor.","devilben02","May 21, 2014"

It's golden hue and bubbly carbonation makes it look like champagne. Other than that there is nothing special about its appearance. It smells rather sweet, probably due to corn or other adjunct. When it came to taste, I was pleasantly surprised. I can actually taste a mild hop character. This paired with its smoothness makes for a easy drinking beer.

High Life is not a beer you should be ashamed to serve your buddies or drink on the couch at home. It's a great cheap alternative to other beers in its price range and knocks some of them straigh out of the park. Just don't expect a fantastic dissolution in your mouth, you will be disappointed and probably grossed out.","LightEnthusiast","Dec 08, 2013"

Maybe a bit of malt in there, but I couldn't really make it out. This carried over into the taste. Some yeast, a lot of maize, a hint of bready malt, but not much, a hint of hops and a hit of alcohol on the finish. Why is that in a lager? Even in an AAL? It's standard, but that alcohol hit is an unwelcome change from the overall mediocrity of the rest of the taste. Mouthfeel was light bodied, with high carbonation. Standard for the style, the same as any other. Overall it's a standard AAL, held back from mediocrity and thrust into somewhat bad territory by a weird alcohol presence and a low hop character. It's not worth going back to for sure.","Auraan","Jul 03, 2013"

Pouring into a tall Pilsner brings up a frothy foamy white head with surprisingly nice lacing, the beer itself is pale yellow and crystal clear. I get corn sweetness with a whiff of Lager aroma. Mouthfeel is typical macro Lager: thin, kinda watery with pinprick bubbly carbonation due to the cold serving temp. Some corn/grass/hay flavor...verrry little in the way of hop bitterness to balance things out. Finshes sweet/watery...but you know what you're getting when you have this.

2.71,1.1,3.5,3,2.5,2.75,2.5,"Gotta give my thoughts on one of my father's favorite beers. It pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of white froth. The nose comprises wispy lemon peel, lightly-funky wheat, wild rice, and hard water. The taste goes straight for hard water diluted with musty grain and the lightest bit of brown grass possible. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation, a watery feel, and a crisp finish. Overall, a decidedly meek little beer, one that makes me wonder why straight tap water wouldn't be a better (and more thirst-quenching) option.","TMoney2591","Mar 09, 2013"

I first drank the Miller Lite, they tried one of these for the first time. It's your average lager yellow with no real smells to speak off with the typical carbonation. But the taste...The taste, For the type of beer it is was wonderful. Sooo easy to drink, sooo smooth. And it was a steal at $16 for the 30. It's a nice change here and there from my usual Pabst, Although Pabst will always have a special place in my heart. I had some of this, however in the Light version, Along with Colt 45 the first time I had ever gotten drunk and I strongly preferred it to the others in the cooler. And this even beats out the Light edition. Wish I would have known about this stuff as a teenager, Would have wasted less money on Bud Light","SometimesIfart","Jun 16, 2012"

Green apple skins, corn starch, and grains. Extremely bland, lacking any real flavors. Light-bodied, high carbonation.

Smells of adjunct grain, especially corn, really sweet. Sweet malty taste dominates, probably from the corn used, but actually has taste unlike many adjuncts. This light bodied beer has full taste, can go down really easily, and is not over carbonated. Overall, an average beer, but better than most adjuncts.","cyclonece09","May 17, 2012"

Hell, for $3.99 a six, and the significant amount of quality time I enjoyed drinking it, I'd have to say, ""It's Miller Time!"" ... even though I enjoy brewing my own beer as well.

The head does dissipate, but it leaves a nice cap on top with some lacing around the edge. There are plenty of bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass. The smell is of malt and corn. There is some mild hop aroma as well, but it's hard to detect. The flavors of grainy barley malt and slightly sweet corn are the dominant flavors. The hops are very mild. The body is light and it is abundantly carbonated. It's crisp and refreshing. This beer is very easy to drink. Overall, this is a solid adjunct lager that is good for a tailgate, a fishing trip, a picnic, or just for a nice summer day when you have the barbecue pit going. For the price, you can't go wrong with this beer.","acevenom","Apr 08, 2012"

Got some left over from a party I threw the other night, so why not throw a review up here. You know what color this is. Golden. It pours with a two finger head and has an actual reasonable amount of lacing. Smell is some harsh corn, bready notes, and that ""wet dog"" thing I always get from these brews. The taste is actually quite reasonable for the style, it goes down very easily with just a bit of corn mineral taste, then finishes with a bready aftertaste. Just enough taste to remind you it's a beer. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and very brisk. C'mon, it's the champagne of beers! Overall, I really like High Life, for what it is. As a cheap ""staple"" beer, it's really easy to do worse. It'll handily beat out most common ""import"" lagers (Corona, Stella, you know what kinda beers I'm talking about) at a third the price.","shand","Dec 10, 2011"

The mouthfeel is very light and isn't even that refreshing. Overall for me, its a picnic beer nothing special about it. If a bee or other bugs gets caught in the can you can just throw it away without worrying. If you knock it over it's not a big deal there's like 29 more cans in the cooler.

Miller is funny because it actually kind of tastes like champagne, on the smell that's exactly what I get, a champagne smell, very sour, maybe even berry smell to it. I mean, is it the best smell ever? No, but it's not a bad smell, and it's very unique as far as adjunct lagers go. Also let it be noted that I do not get that much skunk on the smell, which is good considering it's a clear bottle. The taste is interesting, I get almost no skunk, which is mind boggling, I don't know how that is possible. I do get a very nice berry taste to this, it kinda tastes like champagne, I mean frankly, it almost has characteristics of a hefeweisen. There is a nice sour, maybe even bitter after taste to this beer as well. I mean...yeah it an adjunct lager and yeah it's not the greatest taste ever, but it's actually not bad at all. As far as adjunct lagers go, this is the best I've had so far (accept for maybe PBR). The mouthfeel isn't too great, but that's ok.

I still agree, I catch myself gazing at it's golden color and slow moving little bubbles dancing around while I sip it in the Florida sunlight.

The creamy mouth feel can seem luxurious when only a lighter beer will satisfy my dry. The taste is consistently good for this style no matter how many glasses you drain. Along with PBR it is truly the working persons (or students) best option if you like to have six or more at a time without blowing out the budget and you want something that is refreshing and tastes good. I am very thankful that Miller High Life is still available at a reasonably low cost. This is known as ""The High Life"" for those of us who like to drink beer frequently within our budget.

Tried Rainier first, but it seemed to leave a headache, so I paid about 70 cents more for a six pack of 16 oz. cans and poured away. I was impressed by the persistent head, and began to drink. I found it rather soft and vaugely sweet, although you can detect hops and barley there. It is appropriately yellow, so unless they used food coloring it must be real beer. The taste was smooth, and the aftertaste was somewhere between acceptable and undetectable. Active ingredient being 5%, the buzz from 16 oz. is just about right for a quiet sunny day out in the yard. You could probably drink this all day and then run out in your front yard naked waving a shotgun and still wake up the next day feeling fine and ready for another session.

2.94,9.7,4,2.5,2.5,3,4,"Poured from a refrigerator-temperature bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours crystal clear, light gold, with a pure white thick head quickly dissipating into a skim of lace. Tiny rising bubbles live up to its reputation as the champagne of beers. Aroma is of light, sweet malts - unremarkable, yet inoffensive. Flavor is of corn malts, with no hops to balance. A slight bitterness up front yields to a malty sweetness that does not linger. I cannot believe the ABV - there is no real flavor of alcohol. This is a crisp beer, the bubbles are refreshing and the mouthfeel is thin and watery as befits the style. This beer is very drinkable - it's refreshing on a hot day, has such a mild flavor that it doesn't clash with edibles, and the price is right.","Ladybugger","Jan 03, 2010"

It's a clear golden beer with some carbonation bubbles visible within. In the bottle, you get no head at all, but if someone is foolish enough to pour it into a glass, you'll see a thick, pure white head that will dissipate quickly. I've never taken the time to smell a High Life; now I know why. Lots of sweet malt and corn that is rather off-putting. The flavor is also all malt, but cheap, sweet malts. There's a bit off the gross after-taste common to this style, but not as much as High Life's competitors. Considering the style, the taste is actually pretty good; hence the 3.5 rating. It's a thin beer that is has too much carbonation to really taste the beer (so maybe that's a good thing). This is a good beer to drink when you don't want to think about what you are putting into your body. I never drink it for flavor, but more for price point and availability.","ToasterChef","Jan 03, 2010"

And as far as flavored water goes, it's really not too bad. From the can, however, this flavored water is tinny and sharp.

Anyways, nothing is yellowier in appearance, nothing! Although the bottle is classic, which is what you want to drink this out of. The smell is of very faint corn making it hardly offensive, but not impressive nonetheless. The taste is actually damn good considering its price for a 12 pack and its availability. Better than most other swill in the same category sans PBR. The moutfeel is watery like a Mexican beer, but has a stickiness to it that makes it seem heavy.

I will note, also, that as a rule I only drink HL out of the bottle. Unlike any other beer I drink, I see no point in pouring HL into a glass, as I will not find much beauty in its appearance, nor do I feel compelled to open up its nose, as I will not be put in awe by its bouquet.

The first time or two I tried it I thought it was pretty good. And the bottle is really cool besides. But the more I have drank this one, the less I like it. The color is a little darker than most in the American Macro category (at least those that are brewed in America). It's still definately yellow though. If you like High Life you'll probably call it yellow with a bit of depth. If you don't you'll probably describe it as sickly looking piss. I've had unbiased observers (that is people who've never had the brand and didn't recognize it either) ask me how I could drink something so gross looking. Smell is what I'd call average. It's actually on the sweet side, with hops that are a little funky, but at least noticably present. Taste is what kills this beer, and is where I've changed my mind. My views on the other aspects changed when I stopped appreciating the taste. At first, I thought it tasted pretty decent. It tends toward the sweet side, the adjunct of choice is obviously corn at least instead of rice, and the hops are only a little funky. The problem is that the more you drink this beer, the worse it gets. With each sip, the decent characteristics fade and the chemical bitter/nastiness comes the the fore. If you have more than two, not only does it become unbearable, but the taste will linger for hours after you finish it, even after you eat, or drink something else. The mouthfeel is about dead average, a bit fizzy but not bad otherwise. The drinkability sucks because of the way the nasty aftertaste slowly creeps in and takes over your mouth. Trust me, even from the bottle (and the canned version is supposd to be infinately worse) you would have to be absolutely out of your mind to drink more than 4 of these. The one time I drank 4, even brushing my teeth could't dent the lingering aftertaste. I used to think this was my go-to budget beer. Now I say avoid at all costs. Maybe not as bad as Bud, but who knows, if you drink a fifth High Life it might taste even worse than that. I for one don't want to find out.","casualbeerman","Dec 31, 2005"

A little bit of hops show up along with some sweetness and bitterness, but there's just a little too much sweetness to my liking.

I can cook with them if I hate it). It's not as bad as I remember most macros being...but not that good either. It definitely has value as a summertime quencher. It pours a pale straw yellow in the glass with a bright white and extremely fizzy head. ""Champagne of Beers"" must refer to the fizzy head, not the quality. The smell is of corn-like sweetness. The taste is not bad actually, it's just that the initial burst of flavor is so extremely short lived. There's some toasted bready malt, that corn sweetness and just a hint of herbal hops. Mouthfeel is light and there's a high degree of carbonation. Save this one for a very hot day and drink it ice cold.","johnrobe","Jan 14, 2003"

""High School Party"" smell, mostly a pronounced neutral sweetness with a slight sense of cheap cheddar cheese. Malt flavor is very corn syrup dominated, a ""cooked veggie"" taste that to me denotes aspects of canned potatoes. Hard to pick out anything else. Hops are leathery in quality, as in many macros, and the flavor flattens in a typical way. Yeah, its pretty bad in a grand and traditional way. Budweiser has better crispness.","ADR","Dec 02, 2002"

It's pretty much always got a skunky aroma and flavor, and it's kinda watery, but it's cheap, and anyone with an alcohol tolerance level above that of a 15 year old girls', can drink about a thousand of these and still be functional. IMO, it's the tastiest macro money can buy, and it's always great at parties. If someone offers you one of these, don't start getting all beer snob on their ass and turn it down.

There is a smoothness about it that I like and makes it easy to drink when I'm hot and thirsty. Adjuncts can be detected, but aren't overpowering (as long as it is comsumed cold).
