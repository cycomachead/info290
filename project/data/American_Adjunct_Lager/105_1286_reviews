"Know how to drink The BEAST!!!!!!!!"
"No words for this beer."
""
"I don't know when they started calling this ""Premium"" but that is a misnomer to say the least."
""
""
""
""
"Gets a bad rap, I think due to the low price, but this beer is not bad. For AAL I go B+."
""
""
""
"Decent. It definitely beats bud light"
""
"Ahh Premium Beast.   Very drinkable but nothing else."
"When you attend Texas Tech, but are under drinking age, and your roommate is of drinking age but from Illinois, this is what you end up drinking most nights. thank goodness I graduated!"
"What's the point? I mean... seriously?"
"Pours a nice golden color with a nice head that lingers. Smells quite putrid like most other adjunct lagers. Goes down smooth, but a little bitter on the palate. Not much flavor but not bad either. Overall not bad for a adjunct lager."
""
""
"I used to drink this in high school when it first came out and good thing I didn't know any better. It is still one of the weakest tasting beers out there. It is cheap so if your beer budget is $10 per month this might be the beer for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"For the most part I don't find this much different than so many adjuncts as the corn is sweet and pervasive.  It does have a bit of metallic flavor and a harsh carbonated feel. It tastes cheap and is cheap."

"      Overall a solid 3 for Milwaukee's Best Premium - Miller Brewing Co. Its ok, nothing terrible,but on the same note its nothing out of this world. I'd get this for a big ass party that mainly would consist of people that don't even know what the term ""head retention"" is."

"I'll give the High School and College memories a 5.  But the beer is awful."

"Milwaukee's Best Premium brew by Miller Brewing Co with an ABV of 4.50%. This brew pours out a nice golden amber color with a nice white head. The smell is grain and corn. Milwaukee's Best Premium has the look and smell of an American style lager. The taste is mild with corns and grans, lighter than what I was expecting. Nothing to write home about but it not bad. I have had a lot worse.  For what it is worth this brew goes down smooth with a nice clean finish. There is nothing overpowering in this brew, it has a nice balance to it. Miller Brewing Co. did a nice job with this one. Overall I'm giving Milwaukee's Best Premium a 4.5 out of 5.  I would buy this brew again."

"lwaukee Best pours to a clear yellow. the smell is nothing new to me  just your typical of cook vegetables and grains . It does not bother me! Taste like a typical american lager grains and malts. The hops are their to balance  the beer out . It has very tiny taste of cardboard if warm but other the that milkwaulees best can hold its own against high price Budwesier , MGD. Your typical american  lager with out the price tags. It is the lowest price beer in most market in the country You can take the  label off  Milwaukee Best Premium  beer an put a Coors or MGD label on this beer and 99 percent of the people would not know they would be drinking a cheap beer. This beer is excellent for what it is american adjunct lager. I rate Milwukee Best Preuim with other maerican adjunct lagers an apples  with apples rating . Meaning I rate  Milwaukee  best Preuim with other american lager . IThis beer beats out 95 percent of american lagers out their on the market specially  Mexical lagers with their high price .  Milkwaulee  Best Premium is  the best value on market for taste , price and quality."

"For a cheap beer, I think this one might be the way to go. It's the smoothest of all the beers that it's similar to, and has a slightly more refined taste. It also drinks very light. You can chug a bunch without starting to feel bloated. The only thing I would change is that it's less than 5% alcohol. A little more would be nice."

"This isn't terrible for what it is, good hot weather beverage, and in my opinion is as good as any other AAL. It holds it own with such brands as a Hamm's, PBR, High Life, Busch, etc. Purchased as part of a 12 pack for $8.49 (that's 71 cents a can folks). Cheapest beer on the rack."

"This is a somewhat harsh, but tasty economy macro lager. Miller goes too heavy with the corn every time. That being said, I still like this beer and would drink it again. Tasty. Has potential. Good value. Not the highest quality."
""
""
""
""
"I'll be sure to try this one again in a week or so. I'd like to give it that second chance."
""
"O - This doesn't taste like the same brew I had 15 - 20 years ago! Very good beer & peerless in it's price range- $1 for 24 oz. can. Kudos to Miller!"

"O - Overall, Just another cheap swill. Oh well, At 88 cents for a 24oz. can I knew that I was getting. Realistically, At that price it makes me wonder how much the company spends to make a 24oz can of this stuff. I mean, If they didn't make a large enough profit from the beer you'd figure that they would stop making. I'm assuming the production cost per can is somewhere around 10 cents. Think about that before you buy this."
""
""
"To me its one of the best beers for its price.The Light is ok, and the ice beer has great taste but i get headaches after a few. It has great taste and is better served ice cold. Wish you could find it on tap more. But you can buy it at most super markets and gas stations around SC."

"12 ozers in a suitcase, poured into a Styrofoam cup in my motel one by one. Took about 9 of these before i could swig down a swallow without making a clicking sound with my cheeks. Once i got past that though, it was all i thought it could be. Got me cross-eyed, piss in my roomies sock drawer drunk. Left me with a skull splitting hangover the next morning. Everything I remember from it in college is still true."

"Final Thoughts: I have a hard time really slamming this beer too hard because it's basically just another average macro-lager. While not particularly enjoyable, this is just the usual Joe-Sixpack beer. I have no idea why anyone would choose to drink this more than once, but to each his own."

"'The beast', as it's called, is very drinkable and very plain. No offensive sweetness or astringency to speak of. That being said, I consider this a dirty beer, as in you'll wake up feeling crappy the next day. Not bad for the price, I guess."

"Milwaukee’s Best Beer: Well, sometimes you need a break from oil-thick imperial stouts and blast your tongue away signature IPA’s, as great as they may be. Milwaukee’s Best is just that, beer as a beverage. The golden color, light carbonation and thin head let you know this is just beer. While not as pretty as a Salvation IPA from Avery, it looks more refreshing than a Coke or Mountain Dew. There is some aroma, which is a plus. Flavor combines light malt with a bit of hop bitterness at the finish. Overall, its beer as a beverage and no more. But as summer approaches, and it is time to shed the pounds that all of those stouts and IPA’s added over the winter, a spell of just drinking plain Jane beer is just what the doctor ordered."
"I didn't bother pouring this one out of the can in order to observe appearance. That was not how this beer was intended to be consumed. I DID decide to compare it side by side to my current favourite economy beer, Old Milwaukee. I've got to say, it's a pretty good super-economy beer. Nothing offensive about it whatsoever. Fairly dry and crisp with just a hint of corn (I like it when brewers don't try to hide corn flavour with something more offensive or when they just remove all flavour). It does not stack up to Old Milwaukee, though. Old Milwaukee has more taste and I think might even be cheaper. So, this may not be the best option and I may not buy it again, but it's definitely a better option than Busch, Lone Star, Keystone, etc. It's about on par with the average batch of the ultra-cheap Big Flats, but as my review of that beer indicates, the flavour of that beer is not consistent."
""
""
""
"It's pretty much what I expected."
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours the color of straw with a tall white head. Tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The smell is mild. There are aromas of malt, corn, and some hops. The flavor is also mild. The malt, corn, and hop flavors are mild, but balanced. It is watery, but also grainy/gritty. The body is light. There is moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is fair. Overall, the Beast is the very definition of getting what you pay for. If you're on a budget, skip this and go with Old Milwaukee."

"O - I can't beat up on this beer too much. For $1.20 you get an easy drinking beer thats low on flavor. Its not offensive, and its not too corny or overtly sweet. Much better than I thought it would be."

"Another college tick. Pours light golden with fluffy white head. Aroma of stale corn and straw, with some additional unpleasant funk. Flavor follows with light corn and a rather dirty finish to boot. Light body and high carbonation, but that's about all this has going for it. Avoid."
""
""
""
""
"O - Yes, this is a cheap beer. Like most things you get what you pay for. I actually like the ""Beast"" more than the MGD I punished myself with the other day. This was the main beer we drank in college and it soothed many a pain post rugby games. Maybe I am just conditioned to its lack luster taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Out of a 40 bottle (hey, this is Baltimore!) this beer was a clear golden color with one finger of super fluffy white head. The retention was good especially as a collar and it left consistent spots of lacing. The aroma was of corn, rice and faint malt. The flavors were mostly of corn and sweet malt as well as a little floral hops at the end. Simple but non-offensive and actually much better than most beers available in 40s. The mouthfeel was average albeit watery (standard for the style), the body medium/light and the carbonation medium."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is not a very good beer, but I readily admit I have had much worse. Beast indeed, but not a complete abomination."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Am I really drinking this? Poured this American Lager from a 12 oz can into a pint glass. Pours a clear golden straw color, produces a below average white head. Retention was poor. The aroma smelled of faint traces of grain, faint traces of lacing left behind on the glass. Light in body, flavor of grain and corn. Semi sweet very thin brew. Overall, very cheap, piss poor beer- even for an American Adjunct Lager."
""
""
""
"I think this has recently been restaged as ""Premium"" and I'm not sure if the recipe was changed, but it's pretty bad -- it tastes like rotgut, bottom-of-the-barrell stuff. I think SABM has relegated the whole Miller family to the budget category and this is the lowest rung -- headache material for sure. Try to avoid."

"Poured one into a glass for reviewing purposes. Pours a straw gold, with an inch of foamy white on top. The nose is cheap and weak with a metallic twang to it. Slick body that goes down easily. Mild husky flavors that are spot on for this inexpensive brew. Simple. Thirst-quenching. Cheap. Most likely won't have again, but it's not the worst thing I've ever had."
"O: This stuff is even worse than I remember it being. ""The Beast"" deserves to be feared."
"overall this beer is bad."
"O - You receive that for which you pay."
"Date on bottom of can is ""AUG2211"". Pours to a quickly dissipating head and a strange gold-straw color with a slight tint of caramel color. Smells of cooked corn and slight sulfur form the yeast. Flavor is grainy, corny with a splash of cheap Chablis in the finish. No discernible hop presence, just a nondescript bite that balances the grain. Finishes dry with lingering corn notes. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Overall, for me today, this beer is not terrible, just not anything particularly interesting."
"It's dry, crisp, refreshing, and a great value for the price."
"Overall Drinkability - This beer is a catastrophe. One of the worst beers I've ever had. I will never buy this again."
"Overall its a good sub when drinking with the masses who don't enjoy good beer."
"Overall this beer really isn't too bad. I really liked that I could actually taste hops in it. I would recommend this for people on a budget and to people who are sick of Budweiser and Coors. I will get this again, keep it part of my ""cheap can beer"" rotation."
"Never again."
"D: I was surprised. This is nowhere near as bad as I had remembered from many drunken nights at the fraternity house."
"Typical for the style and yet without the shortcomings of many brews, 'Milwaukee's Best'?? holds strong amongst many BMC brews.."
"D) Drinkable cold. This is actually the beer I buy for mindless beers with friends. Cheap, imageless, flavorless."
"The Beast is even worse than I remember it being in college. I'm sticking with PBR."
"Drinkability: This is the worst beer I have had, bar none. It literally is nearly flavorless, with the only flavor it does have being unpleasant and off-putting."
"Milwaukee's Best Premium pours a crystal clear light yellow, with a fizzy head that faded before I finished pouring. The aroma is light and grainy. More slightly sweet graininess appears in the flavor, with no hint of hop flavor or bitterness. The finish is fairly clean. Overall the only thing this beer has going for it is the price, but it's not really offensive either. It's not nearly as bad as I remember from my early college days."
"This is another beer to mow and play golf with. It is good for that at least. I usually have this in cans when i do have it and it tastes fine smells ok drinks well, and is cheap and easy to find. It is like the rest of these mass produced beers. I would not drink it again."
"Possibly one of the worst beers ever invented alongside its counterparts old milwaukee, & Milwaukee's best Ice it has the same textures as any regular malt liquor. the smell is faint. when it goes down even when its cold it has a very watery but thick taste. its not a very pleasant experience. it is a very foamy one it when it is poured in a glass. i will admit it is a challenge to any beer drinker, specially ones who are in to more higher end lagers ales."
"Milwaukee's Best Premium has a light orange colour, not much head but some lacing. The smell is grainy with a hint of hops. The taste is a little malty with some metallicness at the end. It's quite carbonated so it feels ok in your mouth. Quite drinkable... this isn't as bad as I expected."
"drank straight from the 32 oz bottle. no real smell. goes down extremely easy (was in the freezer for about 45 mins so it is pretty cold). all in all, not a bad brew for something this cheap. would definitely do this one again, but i would probably stick with the bottle."
"Taste: Decent taste for a adjunct lager. I'd rather drink this than Budweiser. There's actually some noticeable hops."
"AWFUL. This 'beer' just smells from moldly boiled rice and distilled alcohol. Pale yellowish color, no head no lacing. Makes me wonder why I am drinking this, and who would buy this. The flavor is mostly of the bitter moldy rice. AVOID!!! unless your aying beer pong"
"Pours a nasty looking straw color with a huge white head. No lacing. Smells pretty decent for adjunct, like creamed corn and some acid. Taste like crap. Malty sweet, bitter (from what I do not know.) Mouthfeel is very thin and carbonation is extraordinarily high. Drinkability is pretty poor."
"Verdict: It'll get you drunk, but thats about the only thing going for it. Doesn't really taste too great to me."
"D-Easy to drink. If you're trying to get drunk for cheap...Milwaukee's best?"
"D - Actually, this is an okay brew depending on the situation. I works fine as a lawnmower beer."
"overall it was not terrible, but i doubt i would go there again. i did not really mind it per se."
"D- A below average adjunct. Nothing really to seperate it from the rest of the macro pack."
"Yet, I will never buy this again."
"What can you say about a beer thats $13.99 for a 30 pack? This is some seriously bad beer. But it is exactly what you would expect. This is a perfect beer for alcoholics, hobis, and poor college kids. If you know anything about beer, you already know better than to crack open one of these. But if youre desperate and broke, this is the way to go."
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down very easily and it's not too filling since there isn't much to it, mild kick, decent representation of an underwhelming style, for the type of beer it's made to be it isn't bad, but overall it's just another fizzy-yellow-beer."
"D-Pick up for memories or only when you are low on cash."
"Drinks good, goes down easy, not very tasty, but cheap."
"From the newly designed can no. SEP0610-B05072154. Sampled on June 4, 2010. Well, the new can design highlights it as a ""Premium"" beer. It pours straw yellow with a ton of carbonation rising to a quick burst of fizzy head that dissipates. The aroma is really nothing at all. Maybe a little bit of grains, rice, and a faint hint of hops. The mouthfeel is thin. The taste has a micro-spoon more in malts than the aroma but it is otherwise very typical of adjunct lagers. Easy to drink many but nothing to remember it by."
"as long as it is cold or at end of night drinking it goes down pretty smooth"
"I do not know about this beer, I cannot find anything on the internet about it so it is either a new labeling nobody knows about or it is a new release. Oh well."
"Overall: If you need to drink this and want a buzz, drink Light. You can probably stomach more of that."
"Drinkability? Not in your worst nightmare. Yuck."
"Bottom line, you may or may not like this. But keeping in mind what I paid, I don't think it can beat."
"Bad beer, dont drink it."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Cheers!"
"Milwaukee's best was the worst beer of the three and maybe the worst cheap beer I've ever had. But that doesn't make it the loser of the tasting. That would be me. Seriously, who does a beer tasting by himself with three crappy beers and takes notes on them?"
"RJT"
"How can I say anything bad about the Beast?"
"Mouthfeel, there's really nothing to grasp onto. Drinkability, it gets a bump up because its cheap, and people do drink it really fast, because its like water."
"Wow its been a while since I had this. So I grabbed up a 40 ounce bottle for under $2. Its not impressive by any stretch of the imagination. Clear yellowish color. Watery mouthfeel. Almost no smell and pretty bland overall flavor. Not to bad here while munching on chips but I would not reach for it again."
"Thin and watery. Almost no flavor until the aftertaste. Its not as bad as I was expecting, just nothing much at all. It has the mouthfeel of water, lots of carbonation in the mouth, no bitterness, overall I'm just really bored. I couldn't drink too many of these but one was enough."
"D: I wouldn't drink again, but was regular to accompany my meal."
"very light clear yellow color. the smell is very grainy, not a whole lot going on there. Short and sweet, the taste is pretty much water and alcohol. Its got nasty sting to it, poorly brewed in my opinion. I dont think you should get this beer unless you have a personal preference to it."
"Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit, certainly some corn here. Taste is crisp and basically flavorless, some mild bitterness. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall there is nothing special about this beer."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - A very easy drinking, yet very boring beer, this is definitely a cheap drunk beer in my opinion. Picked up a 30 pack for 14.99, if one was tired of Malt Liquor or the usual 5.9% ABV Ice lager, than this is a good change. Overall Id pass on it, boring, but nothing offensive either, just for tossing back with ease."
"Drinkability: If you want to use this crap to get drunk drink it cold, real cold, and for all that's holy don't smell the stuff. I used to drink this stuff when I was a kid, but I can't imagine drinking it ever again."
"MF/D: Over-carbonated, light body, eh...."
" edit: oh dear god, this review put some beer in my mug, i hope it's not this beer in it !"
"Overall - Oh, what fond memories I have with this beer. Not because it's good, but the parties it's happened to be at. Unfortunately, this beer is terrible. And this is coming from a guy who actually likes some marco-lagers. I guess at $16 for a 30-rack, you can't beat the value, but bear in mind it's cheap for a reason. To give this beer some credit though, I think I'd still take it over Keystone or Natty Ice. But for ever so slightly more money, you're much better off with some PBR if it's marco lager you're after."
"To it's credit, it does have a fair amount of flavor. It's got the three C's...unfortunately those would be corn, cardboard and carbonation in this case. Not too much trouble finishing off the tall boy, but it's not a very good beer and there are many other adjunct lagers I would rather drink."
"Pours a pale pale yellow color with a slight head. The smell is of cheap alcohol and water. The taste is metalic with no hops, and barely a little grain there. The mouthfeel is fizzy and carbonated. Overall you would not want to drink many of these. It is a typical macro smell and taste of cheap corn and water."
"Drinkability - Drainpour. Thankfully it was free."
"D = Throw this in the pile of miller lite, budweiser, and Natural lite....it's drinkable for ""Hash Runs", ""summer softball games", and drinking games where the object is to get drunk, not enjoy quality brew."
"Drinkability - I suppose if there is nothing else to be had I could choke down a couple but its not really worth it."
"A pale yellow color with a big fizzy white head that faded very quickly,no lacing. Aroma of corn,cardboard,and sweet baby vomit.Flavor at first is almost nonexistant,but as it warms a couple of degrees it takes on an odd sweet metallic taste,thin body and stinky finish. I can drink this if I am dying from thirst but save your money and buy some real beer eh."
"I don't even know why I drank this in the first place. I disappoint myself."
"Pale yellow with a solid cap of fizzy white head that recedes quickly into a skim. Smells of grits and faintly of grain alcohol and just a whiff of used up hops. Tastes pissy and metallic, really pretty shitty even for bargain macro swill. Thin and watery, don't bother with this stuff. There are much better beers even for this price."
"It really needs to have a higher ABV cause the only reason to drink this is to get drunk."
"Immediate skunk aroma--had to turn away. Poured into a long pilsner glass and big bubbles came(not my girlfriend, the beer!) Seemed a bit too aromatic at first, then mellowed to a bitter, bitter mouthfeel with almost promoted a protein spill. Half way through it became drinkable. But, oh my God, it was tough. Finally, after seven of these monsters, I switched to bourbon and Cokes. Seemd like a good beer at the time of purchase, but it compared what I think it would be like eating sidewalk chaulk and drinking chicken broth at the same time."
"Very shocked at how bad this beer is. No redeeming qualities, just a lot of bad. Pale in color and light in flavor. The fact that this is called Milwaukee's Best does not say much out the city of Milwaukee. If I lived there i would protest. Stay clear of this one. It will let you down."
"Pale yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and taste are your normal macro lagers.Refreshing and smooth, perfect for summer outdoor outings.This is exactly what you you expect from a macro, no more no less.I will always have room in my fridge for ""beast""!!"
"Overall: One of the essential college frat party keg beers. If you want to get drunk but only have $5 in your wallet, Milwaukee's best is the way to go. Speaking of which, if this is really the best Milwaukee has to offer, then I don't think I want to try any other beers from there."
"You wanted cheap beer?... You got it brother!"
"Pours a clear, pale, yellow. Little head with no retention and slight lacing. Smells of adjunct in lager. Fits the style. A crisp feel with low carbonation. Tastes of a weak lager with lots of adjunct. Overall, not worth recommending. The body is too weak for anything but drinking a lot of beer and not getting full (getting smashed)."
"The BEAST! Easily the best of the worst. Pours clear yellow with a big white head. Aroma is metallic and veggie, kind of canned beans. Some B.O. in the nose, and a bit funky in the taste. More veggie and grass, some actual bitter hops, and pale malt. Its bad, but not atrocious"
"I filled my 1 Liter Oktoberfest mug with a 40 OZ. of this stuff. Very foamy white suds like a washing machine with too much soap. Very clear yellow/gold fluid. It's stinky beer. Like chemicals, hay, and corn. Nothing pleasant. Hint of sweetness in the taste but otherwise not very good. But not much worse than Bud. Typical cheap beer. Watery and cheaply available in the college classic 40 OZ. I'd buy it again if I only had two bucks in my pocket and I was walking past the CVS. I could drink it behind the dumpster."
"Pretty bad. You used to be able to get this at the duty free shop for 50 cents a can. At that you gotta be a real asshole to complain about anything in the taste. But, its pretty bad. I'd love to be more specific, but if you're reading this and wondering whether to buy some Old Milwaukee tonight....go ahead"
"D: Not again, thank you very much."
"If you've got 4 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, team up with a buddy and split a 6-pack of something respectable. Unless you're a hundred year old man with fond memories for fishing the lakes of Wisconsin, you've got no business drinking this beer."
"D: Eh. It looks, tastes, and smells pretty blah, but it's no worse or more difficult to drink that any other adjuncty, bargain-basement macro. It is what it is - a cheap party beer."
"Don't be discouraged with the mainstream attitudes towards this beer. Just because a beer in inexpensive doesn't mean it cannot be a good beer. Hence, my love of this American Classic."
"The Beast. This is probably one of the worst beers out there. Like many others I'm sure, I first had this in College and honestly, had trouble drinking it then. Yellow color, not much head. Malty, corn, rice taste which is watery and semi-syrupy offensive. But hey, at least it's cheap."
"D: Do-able in a tight situation but wouldn't push it and certainly wouldn't brag about it."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp with a slight creaminess from the carbonation. Oddly, I like this a lot better than Miller High Life."
"Still as a summer lawnmower beer it's just about as refreshing as they come."
"I've only ever tasted it on tap, as it's my school's crappy beer of choice (every college has one). After drinking it for so long, I've learned not to mind it so much, but it is by no means a worthy brew. After all this conditioning, I'll admit I've learned to like it more than some other crap beers, like Natty Light, and if you're going to be playing beer games with it, then it does well enough. However, I'd never recommend tasting it while you drink it; gulp it down at a taste bud-numbing temperature. Even fresh, it has a weak taste neither of hops nor of malt and is a clear, pale yellow color. Not too appealing, but very chuggable."
"As with most macro lagers and malt liquors...it is what it is. Drink it as cold as possible and don't expect much going in."
"Hits the spot on a hot Texas day."
"The feel is way to light and has way too much carbonation. Hard to drink. I would rather have a water."
"I bought a tall boy can which I then poured into a glass, producing two finger's worth of bone-white, foamy head which slowly reduced to about a half-a-finger's worth and then experienced decent retention. The color was a light yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose was slightly sweet, somewhat lager-like, but underlain with a musty, metallic quality. Mouthfeel was thin and watery with only a faint sweetness on the tongue. Finish had a graininess accompanied by a metallic aftertaste. Oof. I would not recommend allow this to achieve anything close to room temperature. Heck, I would not recommend this, period."
"My friend loves this for some reason, and the night I drank it, it was free. Dear Lord, How dare they call this Milwaukee's BEST! Everyone who lives in Milwaukee should be outraged that their city's name is on this swill-piss. It is watery, thin, and tastes like nothing, with a tick of old corn maybe..if so that taste is even faint. But what did I expect anyway for a cheap brew. For the price, he should have bought PBR, it tastes much better, and for about the same price in NH. Why bother? ICK,ICK,Ick!!"
"If you can get by the first few beers, this brew can be drunk all night long but it will catch up with you in the morning."
"This beer has earned the name The Beast."
"D - Drank this in high school when we were broke or stole some from a friends old man. Only for the alcohol would you drink this. Not good."
"M&D: Smooth - like water. Not much here. Nothing particularly attractive about this beer accept for the price - and then you still find yourself weighing the pros & cons."
"I had to laugh when I read reviews of this because I couldn't agree more - this is a college beer everyone should experience in their younger days. I laughed because I remember this and Beast Ice before turning 21 were staples in my college partying days. the regular Beast wasn't my preferred option because I wanted to get drunk, but it is a better beer. The smell is slightly more grainy and less metallic, and it has a smoother slide compared to the bitter Ice. That doesn't mean it is good or anything, in fact it is quite pungent also, but not too horrible. Probably one of the cheapest domestics you can get and for good reason."
"Cheap beer... it should be cheaper."
"Fitting beer to wash down hot wings, enter a drinking contest, or if you are on skid row and are allergic to grapes.."
"commercial beer, industrial, chimical blonde like all the others, no distinction among all, no interest for the beer lover exept to quentch thirst and to pollute whith the empty cans. bad beer but still it has its public"
"D - I didn't actually mean to buy this beer. I thought that it was Old Milwaukee...which IMO is actually a pretty good beer for the rock-bottom price, and picked up a 12-pack. There are several cheapo beers that are decent PBR, Old Milwaukee, Stag, and Icehouse. This, however is nasty, so if you have to go the cheapo route, avoid this nasty sour rot-gut metallic beast at all costs."
"Heaviness of the beer prevents you from being able to drink many of these"
"D- Refreshing. But so bland it seems pointless to pay for it. Hurt by slightly off cheap beer taste."
"Very drinkable, I suppose, for what it is. I'm trying to figure out what to do with the rest of the 12 pack, since it only takes three cans to boil the brats."
"Milwaukee's Best pours a surprisingly golden body beneath a short head of creamy bright white foam that holds fairly well before dropping to a standard collar. Some minor lacing is left behind. The aroma is a fairly generic combination of malt and non-descript hops. It's medium-light in body and quite crisp in the mouth. The flavor is as the aroma suggests. It's basic but clean. There's some bitterness to it, but not much is really needed as there's not really that much malt. It finishes with a dull residue of malt left behind in the mouth."
""
"Eric"
"Milwaukee's Best pours a pale yellow with a white head from a twelve ounce can. Nasty aroma, some of these sub premium macros really have kind of a chemical aroma. Flavors seem kind of raw or harsh. Corn is the predominant taste. Drink it cold and drink it quick if you plan on drinking this one, by the time it warmed up it was truly nasty. I think you are risking a bad hangover drinking even a little bit of this stuff."
"This beer led to my worst beer experience ever. I was given this at a bar in Memphis Tennessee. It was clear enough that I could read the newspaper through the full glass. No aroma to speak of, and very little flavour. I asked the waitress what it was. She replied, It's 'Milwaukee's Best'. I replied that if that was Milwaukee's best, I would hate to taste their worst. I was promptly asked to leave the bar."
"This is better than I anticipated. There are far worse beers out there than this. Well worth the $0.25 I paid for it . One is enough, but I don't feel dirty for drinking it."
"Like I said the Beast is only good for a cheap substitute. Do not expect to experience much, and if your beer is Guiness, you will hate it. Do not drink quality beer before drinking this."
" If your need a good thirty and only have 10-15 this is perfect for you. This is just what the average fake-beer drinker would pick up on a regular basis."
"overall this beer isnt that bad for a macro, it should be served ice cold kind of a little refreshing then"
"A few days later I talked him into buying us some Budweiser, and I thought it was the best beer in the world. I guess compared to the beast, Bud isn't all that bad."
"All and all an average cheap macro, not too bad if you're looking for flavor from something cheap. For a similiar price I would choose PBR or Schlitz hands down."
"Don't be fooled, this beer has also won awards. Drink up."
"I hadn't had this one in years, and couldn't resist the 4.99 12 pack price. The nose is cereal grain/ corn with a whiff of the inside of somebody's pickup truck I once got a lift in. Ditto on the flavor. Thin and watery, it goes down easily, but without any satisfaction. What little finish there was served to inform me that now I had become that old pickup truck I had once ridden in. There is still more in the fridge, so I will have to push on through."
"Milwaukee's Best was a very clear light pale golden color with a white head. The head was of decent size to start with, but almost immediatly dissapeared, leaving no lace. The aroma was grainy. The taste was sweet and grainy with a dry finish. The mouthfeel was crisp and light with high carbonation. Drinkability is below average. Overall it is a crappy beer that should be avoided."
"Well, I guess it's not as bad as I thought it would be. Though, this is a beer best drunk straight from the can. Pours a pale yellow, with very little head. What is there slowly disipates to a thin film. Pungent smell. Overcooked veggies, corn, and corn syrup. Pretty much, adjunct ridden scent. Taste is a bit better. Well, their is hardly any taste to be offended at. A bit of an artificial sweetness. An almost sour bitterness. Not impressed, but not overly horrid. Mouthfeel is a bit dry and almost salty. Drinkable? Well... I have had far, far worse than this. Would I want to drink it again? Hell no. But, if offered to me, in a can, at temperatures at almost absolute zero, I might not refuse."
"Drinkability: It's a no brainer. It's just a good beer for relaxing and not thinking about it but rather hanging out with your friends."
"Yet another 40oz budget beer, sure why not. Pale yellow pour with a head that disappears quickly. Smells very faintly like corn syrup. Tastes a weak corn syrup flavor, slight citrus bitterness. Thin mouthfeel. Overall it's a cheap beer for a cheap buzz if that is what your looking for. Otherwise go elsewhere."
"I was helping Wcudwight paint and we sent my wife out with the instructions to bring back 12 of whatever was the cheapest. This was the winner only because they were out of PBR. Like any other macro, it smelled like a mash tub at a moonshine still. The color was light straw and little head. The taste was bearable cold. Mouthfeel was average for the style. Cold this beer really hit the spot when I was hot as hell. Not a beer to drink by a fireplace with snow on the ground. But a summertime work beer it is."
"Overall The Beast has it's place in the world of beerdom."
"Typical cheap beer. There are better choices in the category of inexpensive American lagers."
"Taste is ... salty [you thought I was going to lick my armpit too for comparison? Sorry to disappoint. Actually, it might not have been a bad comparison.] There's a light sweetness too, like watery corn mash and dull hops. A bit peppery, no aftertaste at least. Goes down easy despite the badness, but why am I drinking this? After these few sips I want to throw it away, but people might see me, and it was free...am I being a jerk if I toss it? Who cares. Hey, they have Rolling Rock too, after the best Milwaukee has to offer (tm) this doesn't sound so bad..."
"Beast is not as bad as people think it is. Just because it's cheap doesn't mean it has to be bad. I enjoy the taste of Milwaukee's best, but hate that my friends are always giving me crap about drinking it. It tastes similar to MGD just not as smooth. It's really not a bad beer. It has a good color for a lager. I laugh when i see people say this color is pale like it's a bad thing. Lagers are supposed to have a pale color, look for richness :). I would pay more than I do for a beer of this quality. Not that it's the best beer, but for what it's trying to be, it is excellent."
"The drinkability of this cheapo beer is pretty low. High Life is almost the same price, and tastes ten times better. This stuff isn't even worth the $1.59 I paid for it."
"D - Not bad actually. Much better than I expected. Not a tasty beer by any means mind you, but there aren't a lot of off flavours or anything."
"I'm embarrassed to admit, but this is the beer that started it all for me. During my high school years this was the beer of choice for me and my friends. $1.99 for a six pack and a package store that didn't bother to card 16 and 17 year olds was heaven for us back in the mid-80's. I decided to try this for the first time in many years and try to capture some of that nostalgia. The beer poured a very pale yellow color with a large head that went away quickly. I purposely gave it a vigorous pour. Smell was of corn, vegetable matter and adjuncts. Pretty lousy. Taste was equally lousy, very watery with no body or flavor other than a strong adjunct(veggie?) taste. No hop flavor detected and I could barely taste any trace of malt. How did I stomach this stuff for so many years and in so much quantity? Never again! Lord help me!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very thin and watery. The beer maintained its drinkability as long as the beer was cold. A very difficult beer to suck down."
"Drinkability - Gave me a headache and a hangover afterwards. Spend a few bucks more and get some Bud/Natty Lite instead."
"Color wasn't that bad, yellowish light gold color, with a very small head that evaporated about as fast as my enthusiasm for this beer. Smell was a little skunky and kinda veggie like. Taste was not very distinct, watery and plain, and nothing redeeming. This is definitely towards the bottom of the barrel of ultra cheap mass produced American lagers."
"D = I made it through one of these and stopped. This beer is purely for the frugal drinker wanting to catch a buzz. I won't drink this crap anymore."
"Smooth and a no brainer. A very inexpensive brew and good quality for the price if all you desire is a watered down beer to serve at a backyard BBQ. Goes well with ribs and rich foods."
"Appearance is a sort of light watered down yellow. Not neon bright like Bud, more an off-yellow. Like Highlife only watered down. Smell wasn't too good. I'm not sure exaclty what I smelled but it wasn't really beer. There was alcohol in there, that's the only scent I could identify. Taste wasn't too great either. Thin, sickly sweet, plus you can definately taste the can. No hop character at all, but considering the hops a beer of this price must use that can only be a good thing. And something else, not quite sure what. Not much of the bitter chemical kind of adjunct I found with Bud or Highlife, but there's something else a little off in this beer. Like the yeast was sick and stunted or something.(or maybe that was the missing hop character) Anyway mouthfeel was definately overcarbonated. Drinkability could have been worse, I didn't have to supress the urge to gag or anything. But even like 18 assorted beers, shots and mixed drinks in the hole this didn't make me want another.(and that's really saying something. Anything less than completely terrible is usually delicious once I'm that ""acclimated"") Having finished this beer, I popped open a cold Budwieser afterwards, thereby continuing my string of bad drink decisions. But that was actually worse by a lot. This beer seems to be not very beerlike but only moderately offensive. The Bud, being Bud, is actually a little more beerlike but definately tasted worse. Now somehow this rating worked out to better than Coors Light. Don't believe that. I don't consider Coors Light good for much of anything, but if it comes down to ""The Silver Bullet"" and ""The Beast", and you can't do the intelligent thing and get yourself a water or something, Coors Light is probably a better idea."
"The appearance is very urine-like, and that quality doesn't change when you move onto the taste or the smell. Given the above facts, this beer (or should I even call it that) really shines through at the times where you reach in your pocket only to find a couple bills plus some change. If you are looking to get plastered this is your beer anything less is just vile torture to your stomach."
"poured a pale yellow color with a nice white head. Rapidly fell to only a thin ring. Smell is minimal with maybe a slight sweetish note. Taste is very light, but not offensive. Finish is thirst quenching, but no malt or hop taste to be found. Acceptable as a cheap spacer."
"My brother, an unconverted (and unapologetic) macro-lover, had this beer on tap in his basement recently. I have to admit that I drank way too much of this brand in college, and this was the first taste of the stuff in years. Its a light straw color with very little head. Serious corn in the aroma. Also in the smell are a very weak hop scent and a fleeting whiff of alcohol. The up-front sweetness was more intense than I recalled from way-back-when. The body is very watery, and utterly unsatisfying. Its a weak and hollow brew, no question about it."
"A rancid work of the devil. This pours a very clear straw color with a airy as hell head that leaves you quickly. Smells like metal and chemical ass. The taste is hoppy but not good hoppy. Nasty carbonated iron hoppy. Aftertaste of acid. Milwaukee's best ice is the way to go. It is just as cheap, gets you drunk a little faster and tastes allright. Why do they make this? It is so painful. Not drinkable in any situation."
"Really strange, not as annoying as other beers from this brewery, but at least was dinkable. Almost green the liquid, like in those macro lagers around, but even more remarkable. Little foam, and no additives that hard. Extrange can for being one of MIlwaukee familly, you know what I mean."
"""a beer made for the men", i try this beer in summer 2005, and is good, over the counterpart of AB brewery; is rich in flavor, best in general like its name, smell hops flower and broiled corn, taste little bitter and full of plenty, clear yewlow color, dry malts, try with mexican food and bbq, friends reunion; serve in a glass mug; 91% recommended."
"Can provided amid a bunch of stuff given to me for volunteering at 2005 GABF. Uhm, thanks guys, I really appreciate the opportunity. Stamp on the bottom of the can reads 12255 E11889. Pours a 1 1/2 finger white head that settles really fast. The beer is clear and light straw in color. Smells almost like water. Very weak iron, honey, and cardboard. Tastes...not so good. The malt sweet is mild and I think there is a soured grain character in there. Hop flavor is strong (compared to the strength of other flavors in this beer). It comes across as dark and oily and doesn't mix well with the overly strong carbonation. Upon the swallow there is a nice melon sweetness rounding about naer the tonsils. The aftertaste is acrid carb on the tongue and iron-ish malt cat-fighting with the hops. Light body and I'm glad this review is over. I drank a MBest Light just before this beer and think the Light version is much better than the regular. I guess it may be that the flavors in the Light are so subdued that they can't be offensive."
"Pours a very clear pale straw. One finger head has about a 30 second lifespan, and no trace of lacing. Corn and grain aroma that doesnt hide the sweet estery alcohol smell. The same adjuncts make up most of the flavor, with a mild alcoholic bite, and no sign of hops. The lightish body and heavy carbonation fail to buffer the taste of harsh alcohol and adjuncts. Astringent and tangy sweet finish. For casual drinking on a budget, the ""Ice"" or ""light"" versions of Milwaukee's best are far superior, but that still not saying much."
"Aah it's a beaut. A true camper's beer. Would compete for the smash-the-can-on-your-head award. Unlike most beers, you have to drink at least four of them to decern any flavors at all. A powdery corn-like flavors. Some other vegetable and grain characteristics, but in too low of detection to identify. Quite metalic in taste and feel. Overcarbonate equals sandpaper on the toung. Light hop detection aids in drying and leaves the mouth void of flavor or body. I like this beer--It makes me appreciate other beers."
"D- Honestly... unless I was drunk already, I don't think I could handle more than one of these. If you serve it ice cold... it's got a chance, but let this baby warm and you're in for a sour stomach. If it's free, I'll think about it. Not one I'll ever part with cash for. There's better macro-garbage out there, so let the beast pass you by."
"Drinkability: It is cheap priced, because it is cheap. You pay for what you got. In my case, I bought just a single one for that review and it will probably be my last one."
"Damn, this is swill. Never liked this brew. Pours out to a cheap yellow color with quite a bit of carbonation. Notes of corn and a metallic like odor were noted. Taste was consistant with smell. I would recommend many other beers over this, as If you are buying this you are 1) in college 2) broke, or 3) an alcoholic with a fetish for shitty beer. Go with Old Milwaukee instead. Not recommended."
"Pale yellow color very thin white lace for a head. Very think bodied and a lot of carbonation. Smells like grains and cooked corn. The taste might as well not exist. Watery with some sweet corn, faint hops, and grains. Kind of hard to drink but gets the job down when people want to beer bong at a frat party."
"Thank goodness I live in my fraternity house, because I would probably never get to review this bad boy otherwise!"
"Paid $2.89 for a sixer of 16 oz. cans. I don't know if I've ever paid less for that much beer. Milwaukee's best is pale yellow in color with a small soapy head. Retention is non-existant. The aroma is typical of the average adjunct lager, however probably less sweet smelling than most. There isn't much here to talk about, this beer has all the bad tastes of adjunct lagers without some of the possible good flavors of grains or mild sweetness. This is pretty tasteless, which probably makes it easy to drink, but you can do a lot better for a lawnmower beer. Spend the extra 50 cents or dollar and get a Pabst product."
"It certainly takes some hubris to call your beer Milwaukee's Best when your brew is perhaps the most offensive commercially available beer. A little surprised, too, that Miller puts their logo on these cans. Just knowing that Miller knows how to make this beer makes me reconsider purchasing their other beers."
"Drinkability: Despite being nasty, I find these things easy to drink. Great session beer"
"This beer is almost as clear as water. It has a slight yellow tint to it. Absolutely clear. The carbonation looks to be quite active. A decent sized blanket of white sits on top. The aroma is actually pretty good. Grainy and sweet. Just a little corn, but not overdone as in some macros. The carbonation is just a little too jacked up. Makes drinking a little tougher than it should be. The flavor profile is grainy and sweet (like the nose). And a bit of cereal is noted as well. Just a touch of bitterness....barely deceptible. Overall, better than I remember from my college days."
"12 ounce can sampled, yeah now we are livin' large. Only cost me .60 cents in that beer rip off zone known as Grand Central station in NYC (Duane Reade also has Heineken for $1.30 a bottle...)Pours the expected light pissy yellow, medium bubble head, snow white. Nose of corn, very light bodied and quite watery. Next to no malt or hops noted. Crisp and cleansing of the palate,slight metalic note. Only decent on a very hot day"
"Another Fraternity staple. Smells of alcohol and grains, without any character. Very light, slight sweetness, but gets very dry and bitter. High on the carbonation as well. The bite and general bitterness make this one of the tougher swillers. Still, it's price will keep it alive on the party scene for good, I'm sure. Just don't drink it willingly."
"Well not that it matters, but again, all the Beast products are for frat boys and getting mass amounts of people drunk. They do the job, and they do it well. For $10 a 30 pack, it gets the job done. No matter what people say, Beast will always have a place in the hearts of America's youth, and for that, I tip my hat to them."
"For the price, it's not a bad buy. If you have money to spend, then stray away from this beer. It has an almost sweet taste to it. Very carbonated, but goes down pretty easy. This beer is definitely not good, but I wouldn't call this horrible. It's mostly the broke man's beer. Overall it's not too bad for the price and I would probably buy it again when my wallets looking a little thin."
"Canned (how appropriate): Most bad beers I try to think of something interesting or witty to make the experience worthwhile. However this beer is so worthless it is not worth the effort. Straw color with tiny bubbles and a thin white head. No lacing. Musty weak hops aroma. Thin-bodied and anemic with barely any flavor, and what is there is not pleasant. You shouldnt even be able to make something this low quality with malt, hops and water. The fact that there is an aftertaste is distressing because it is not an appealing experience. Never again."
"Overall-Beast Light is better, overall this is awful. I see many people scoring it high because they have memories of it in college. Well I'm in college, and this beer still sucks, no matter how often I drink it. A cheap horrible beer to be drank in high quanities for a quick buzz. That's it."
"This mouthfeel and the beer is under carbonated (that would be a good quick and cheap way to improve this beer). Drinkability is better than awful. Lots of better cheap beers to drink. In the spirit of always saying something nice, it is better than Busch."
"Drinkability: If one beer makes me queezy I've either got the stomach flu or a Beast in my hand."
"But anyway, this is probably the worst beer I've ever had, and being a college boy, I've had a couple pints here and there. It tastes like dogpiss and looks like it, too. No buzz whatsoever, and after a while, it's just a chore to drink. If you want a cheap college beer, go for the Pabst or Natural/Keystone Ice. Ice's are never a bad choice, but Light's are just disgusting."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is less than average. It has a pale malt scent with the addition of adjuncts. It is dry and slightly bitter from hops and lager yeast. The taste is horrible. It is tasteless and bland. It has no character and doesn't even refresh. It has decent mouthfeel. It is a low bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a less than average lager. It has little flavor and less aroma. It's one and done for me."
"Overall, pretty awful, tasteless like bud, rice and corn present in the mouthfeel and a nasty greasy finish on the palette"
"Drank straight from the cans. From a marketing standpoint, I would guess that they are trying to impart a sense of royalty by making the cans red and gold, but it just reminds me of drinking an old man's beer. Taste is so full of adjunct and skunk that it is hard to get anything else out of it. Do not buy this stuff, get 40's instead, they are just as cheap and not as bad as this crap."
"I know that Milwaukee's Best isn't the greatest thing in the world. The beer is also know as beast. It poured a putrid yellow with no foam, head whatsoever. The smell is very grainy and corny. The taste however isn't half bad. While it is nowhere near average it is better that some other more expensive macros (bud especially), in fact I find the taste to be the same as a Coors. Feels crisp but flat in the mouth but is very refreshing. Was mowing the lawn today so bought a six pack of this for 2.50 and I thought very drinkable. This is a beer for a swealtering hot day, not for sitting around a pub."
"God my friends and I use to drink this stuff all the time. For $12.00 a 30 pack I guess you cant go wrong. When this stuff is poured out it is a nice yellowish color to it, it has no aroma at all and as for the taste, it tastes like an aluminum can. The Hops in this beer you dont even no exist, it is defiantly a cheap beer with no flavor or character at all. As for why they call it the beast, I guess it comes from two things first the horrible taste and the nice hangover you get after drinking this beer."
"(I must admit a certain positive prejudice here since I am a Milwaukee native who worked at Miller Brewing many years. This brand was an old Gettleman label way back when)."
"A staple at colleges, Milwaukee's Best is more affectionatly known as ""Beast."" The reason for this is quite simple: it sucks. The color is unimpresive, taste is ungodly when it is anything but icecold. Evenwhen it is cold, I find it difficult to drink in big gulps."
"Overall - Hey, it's cheap, it's swill, and it ain't all that bad. has a surprisingly good taste to it. If you're feeling like 'slumming it', go ahead and grab a case!"
"This beer is a very light yellow with a thin, bubbly, white head that leaves quickly. The nose is quite offensive with a grassy smell. The beer tastes very watery. The corn is prevalent throughout the entire beer. Drinkability is low for this beer. The only thing going for Milwaukee's Best is the price, but it is probably too high at 3.85 for a 6 pack of 16oz cans."
"Time for a real beer, but before I leave the Beast behind, let us contemplate the phrase on the label, below the lie ""premium beer."" "Classic taste at it's Best"" It brings to mind this riddle: how many un-truths can you stuff into five words?"
"The Beast! This is by far some of the worst beer Ive ever had. It is for sure not the Best. Very faint yellowish color. Poured with a big head that was white and bitter tasting. Smell of corn mainly, couldnt detect any hop aroma at all. Taste of well nothing really stood out in the taste, but it didnt seem very fresh. No mouthfeel or very little and very easy to down since there is nothing really to enjoy."
"F."
"This is a clear light golden color brew, with a pretty nice white head on the top. The smell is a mix of grain and chemicals. The taste is gross water, with a hint of grain and hops. This isnt as bad as i was thinking it would be, but it sure fails to impress. Not a bad macro pale lager, if that makes sense."
"Pisswater all over the place. The smell, the taste, the looks, the mouthfeel all deserve more or less the same remarks to point them out: monumental crap. Much like movies like pirates of the caribbean, this beer is no fun at all, has a funky false story to it in terms of taste and makes you laugh at times. I pity the fool who prides himself on drinking this."
"Alright welcom to college, this beer packs a pale yellow golden tone with a white vibrant tone thin fizzy and fastly disipating. Aromatics is thin mild not too astringent but packed chalk full of cooked veggies adjuncts. Slightly sweet carbonated water no real flavor this beer is such a mass produced swill beer, I haven't drank it since high school keg parties wow I haven't missed a thing. Flavor has no hops to be detected cheap and drinkable in quantity thin as water in texture and taste never buy it if you really want beer."
"The flavor is of doggie biscuit soaked in mineral water. Broad for its class, and showing more swaggering intensity than its AB counterpart (Busch, right?) it is poorly balanced, with soapy, wilting dullness at the end of every hint of real, living flavor. The only thing that gives it structure is an obnoxious fizz."
"The Beast. That says it all really. Appearance is based on the can's logo, because there's absolutely no reason to pour this in a glass. The only time I've seen the stuff out of the can is playing beer pong in college, and no beer looks good with a ping pong ball in it. Good beer for poor college kids that want a cheap buzz, as was the case for me not too many years ago. Better than some other cheap beers such as natural ice and olympia (foul!). Drinkable to get the job done"
"Beast isn't the worst in the world, but hey some beer is better than no beer. This certainly is not one of my first picks, but whenever I feel I need a little change, I'll pick up a 6 pack of MB. Sometimes it hits the spot, other times it tastes like motor oil. Really all depends on the mood."
"IMHO this product does deserve some respect in that there is a definite spot on the market for this brew... economically speaking."
"At the low end of the food chain, this is macro at it's worst. Pale yellow with a white head that is small and not lasting. There is almost no smell but that of grain adjuncts. Flavor that provides no smoothness or enjoyment. This has all the character of flavored water."
"Looks like a mix of Mountain Dew and urine. Smells sweet, like very cheap white zinfandel. Bubbly in the mouth. Tastes skunky even though it's not skunked. Hard enough to drink one. I tastes much better when mixed with Captain Morgan's and served over ice."
"Mix Milwaukee's Best and Captain Morgan's over ice. Serve in tall glass, preferably boot-shaped. Enjoy."
"This is very cheap, and the taste shows as such. Excessive graininess (corn) gives this a harsh, bitter taste. Lots of carbonation. Very dry, with only a hint of malt aftertaste. The overall taste is of adjuncts and played out crappy ingredients. This is crap beer at it's best."
"If this is Milwaukee's Best, i would hate to see the worst! If you like water, then this is the beer for you. I like PBR and that is from the same town, and it is way better, so is Olympia. Try those if you want a cheap beer that is good."
"Crap pure crap! I'm trying to find the write words for this stuff. the head was pale thin fuzzy and awful. The color was an ugly yellow off white tone .the body was very thin like water with bubbles. The taste was that of a light beer gone wrong watered down beer flavor with a tinny aftertaste not really refreshing but almost heavy in taste to make you feel blotted leave this stuff alone!"
"I hear that they don't sell this stuff in Milwaukee (they probably don't want to get sued for libel). Seriously though, anyone buying this is obviously not expecting top of the line craftsmanship. They're expecting something that'll get them drunk, and this will do the ticket. Probably tastes better after the first few, but I can only drink one at a time."
"Beast. What else can I say. We've all been here, unfortunately. Yellow / gold in color with a ring of bubbles on top, this didn't start out too strongly. Maybe I was a bit biased, though. I already knew what I was getting myself into. It had a funky, kinda salty smell, with a thin graininess.  The beer had a very thin body from a complete lack of malt sweetness. Only corn sweetness was present. Grainy, salty, and metallic in taste, I must admit I knew it was coming. At least it wasn't super-carbonated like some of the other American premium lagers."
"a bad beer, but not as bad as a coors or bud product. what else can i say, sometimes it is there and you are already loaded, so you throw a few back. if you can taste em, it won't kill ya"
"That being said, its obvious one can consume many of these in a short period of time. An excellent beer for beer pong, but thats about it."
"What flavors and aromatics I can detect are harsh, not top shelf. A likeable brew, just not one Id get romantic with."
"Sickly pale gold; brilliantly white head, quick to disappear, vague spotty lace. Sweet, adjunct filled (corn?), and alcoholic nose. Light, plain, thin, semi-sweet, husky palate did I say plain? Watery, thin mouthfeel. Boring and yucky. Mildly dry finish. Skip it."
"Pale straw gold color with a thick and frothy head that fades to a paper thin layer in a minute or so, fair lace, slight carbonation.  Faint aroma, mostly grain and alcohol.  Scant maltiness in the taste, followed by alcohol, and rather tired hops, dry finish.  No much here, I'm afraid, among the beers that share this price level, Miller High Life and Schlitz are much better."
"Okay, this beer fooled me when a friend had it at a party.  I guess I thought it was Old Milwaukee.  But as a cheap macrobrew, this one really should be ignored and just stick to Old Milwaukee"
"This beer isn't good.  Its not the worst liquid I've ever consumed either.  It fits in nicely in dorms, frat house, and places where old guys named Stan hang out.  To be honest though, the ""Beast"" is better than Miller High Life in my book."
"Notes: A very sub-premium lager, you know it is cheap crappy beer when they are selling it for $1.75 for a 40 oz bottle. A bit hard to put down and not very clean … a rough around the edges cheap lager."
"UGH....i regret having to review this beer but every time i go home to my parents, this is the $5 12 pack that my dad has waiting for me. the BEAST has the worst taste of any beer i have ever tasted. it is horrible.  so i grab the spicy hot V-8, some Tabasco and a jar of olives and magically transform the Beast into something quaffable.  when you can buy 30 packs of High Life for $12, why even bother with this stuff?"
"The BEAST.   Gets an extra point for the memories.  A pretty crappy beer otherwise."
"No list would be complete without including Milwaukee's Beast.  I know there must be beer here somewhere, I just can't find it.  On the other hand, it is dirt cheap.  Not much flavor, but it is smooth and easy to drink. (Of course, a glass of cold water has the same quality, and is almost as cheap)."
