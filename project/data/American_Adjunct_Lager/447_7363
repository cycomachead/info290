3.65,28.5,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Review #300. This Natty Boh beer is special to me as I usually have it before the Orioles baseball game where they sell tall cans cheap - ~$2 to $3. Good times. National Bohemian has a thick, white head and a very clear golden appearance. Carbonation is high. Aroma is faint, but what one would expect from an American-style adjunct lager- that beer smell. Taste is delightful, with a nice hop balance; hop character is a bit more pronounced than others in this style category. Mouth-feel is light and watery. Natty Boh finishes crisp and refreshing. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer and I usually reserve it for pre-baseball tailgating in Baltimore. Natty-Boh, baby!","CuriousMonk","Dec 06, 2010"

The taste has the same notes as the aroma (grain, slight apple/metal tartness, bit of lager and very slight hop bitterness), but I would say that the taste is better than the aroma. This is good, solid cheap beer. Is it the best cheap beer? Not at all. There are some with better aroma and flavor, but there are also many that are worse.

The mouthfeel was thin and watery and there was a faint sweetness on the tongue, but that was about it. The finish was unobtrusive, at best. This is truly a lawnmower beer.

Body actually stood up a bit better than expected. an extra corn-sugar sweetness persists and leaves the body a bit heavier.

The head started out like a soda, but it's turned sticky and has left decent lacing on the inside of the glass. Smells very mild. Mostly I get a dark noble hop, something like spalt hops. There is a non-descript sweet way beneath and that's about it for the aromas. Tastes are out of balance. The primary flavor is a dark edgy hop. Greasy and dirty. Perhaps Tettnanger hops. The hop character is bolstered by an acrid from carbonation. Sweet is much too far below to contribute helpfully. Light body and heavily carbonated.
