review_text
"Pours a finger of sudsy, frothy white head, fades quickly to a thin film, and decent spotty lacing. Clear and straw colored. Smells of cereal grains, slightly skunky, very straightforward. Bland taste, with a short bitter hop bite. Slight citric tartness and notes of straw/hay in aftertaste. Feels watery, with higher carbonation. Taste does not linger at all, not that I'd want it to. Overall, I simply can't bring myself to find anything really pleasing or outstanding about this macro. If nothing else, it looks good."

"Decent. Does the job when asked."

"It is mostly grassy sweet, with some just a hint of hops bitterness that doesn't last or bite at all. In fact, none of the flavor lasts or really asserts itself in any way. No aftertaste. Smell is a bit skunky but this doesn't come through in the taste. Light mouthfeel, easy drinking, no challenge at all, the mac and cheese of beer. I wouldn't turn my nose up at this on a hot summer day at a BBQ, but I'm not going to be the one to bring it to said BBQ or buy this unless it's really the only beer in the one local store out in the middle of the wild."
"Very good overall but with slightly weak smell. Great feel."
""
""
"A great beer, when canned, for all day ocean fishing trips.  Very smooth and crisp.  Several off quality batches have occurred over the years having a metallic off flavor."
"This was  the ultimate ""hanging out"" beer back in the day it was cheap and readily available."

"Served in a Mug"

"Enjoy"

"This one always gives me the beer farts. Otherwise harmless and not truly memorable."
""
""
"Looks good. Stays constant. Better Taste than Miller Lite"
"I remember drinking a lot f this in the 90's. Now I ask why?"
"Overall:  People who desire an unbearable feeling of bland sensation will seek Miller Genuine Draft as a confusing compensation."
""
""
""
"Horrible ... you take the first sip and think because you've spent the money to buy a beer so"
""
"Good crisp and citrus taste gives is a fresh and great paring beer."
"It's a regular draft easy to drink"

"gets points for appearance is crystal clear,"

"Refreshing & slightly boozy adjunct lager."

"I wish I could rate it lower!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely awful tasteless and one to avoid"
"You know what your getting of you drink this."
"dominated entirely by a strange, mouth-filling adjunct fug. Not entirely offensive, but not even so much as a touch of grain or hops. Pretty ordinary stuff."
""
"Overall: thank you Millers for living up to my expectations. This is a pretty nasty and boring macro lager with awkward, pungent flavours and an unsatisfying and watery feel. Worth AU$44 a case? Not nearly."
""
""
""
"It's not the worst American Adjunct Lager, but it's certainly not great either. You know what you're getting into if you are on this website and buy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"MGD hits the spot. Good at parties. Miller is just good in general. Yeah they are big, but i enjoy miller quite a lot. Rating this against the style, this is good stuff."

""
""
"( should not that I don't think this one has skunked yet, as I did get it in Milwaukee...and that helps make it better than I remembered)."

"Typical adjunct lager. Slightly on the sweet side. Just a tad more malt flavor than Budweiser. Overall, average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Not good that is all I can say. The taste is bland and the finish is super dry."
""
""
""
"Terrible smell followed by terrible flavor that has an evil, God-awful bite to it. Avoid at all costs!"
""
"Out of 24 oz can. Smelled of adjuncts but was a good smell to it. Not too light. These beers such as PBR, rolling rock, colors, miller etc... Almost always seem to leave an odd dry film in mouth. But I did like this"
""
""
""
""
""
"MGD will always be my highest rated big brewery beer. When I was young, Miller Lite was my go to beer. I eventually graduated to MGD due to the amount of taste and how smooth and drinkable it was. I do tend to not drink it anymore because if I’m out partying I tend to go to Miller Lite because it is easier for me to watch my alcohol intake."

"But it's really awful beer, truth to be told.  I wouldn't buy this on purpose in a scenario short of the zombie apocalypse."
""
""
""
""
""
" Once in a while a friend of mine will offer me one. Only out of courtesy will I drink it, but usually give it away. Another beer whose fame came  only by shoving propaganda down the throat of the blue-collared and telling them that this is what 'real men' drink. When my friends  request that I pick this up from my local liquor store I flat refuse to buy this horrid mess of a beer."
""
""
"Had this for the first time in years at the local Labor Day picnic.  For what it’s worth, it is a notch above Miller and Miller Lite.  It's smoother and less corny for some reason. And, union made by my UAW brothers and sisters - so there’s that."

"Miller Genuine Draft brewed by Miller Brewing Co. with an an abv of of 4.7% This brew pours out a nice amber color with a small white head. The smell you pick up on grains and corn. The look and smell is that of an American Adjunct Lager. There is nothing special about this brew so far. The taste is ok you pick up on the corn in this brew, but it is not bad. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is nothing bad about this brew.Miller Genuine Draft goes down smooth with a clean finish. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3.25 out of 5. This is not the worst I've had but not the best. I would get this brew again."

"this was the beer that got me to like beer. I didn't care for bud light, milwaukee's best, coors, pbr, or any of the other big-name generic beers out there. they tasted like water-down crap. I remember first tasting this beer and liking it for its crisp, citrus notes, and then seeking out beers with more intense flavors. while it pales in comparison to what I enjoy drinking now, that's okay. it's still very easy to drink, cheap, and tastes decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly good. Refreshing and clean, but with good flavor for a pale lager beer. This beer is way under-appreciated. Better than Budweiser or Coors Banquet. Clean, refreshing, and tasty. A very good macro lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: If you like drinking sweaty ass, drink MGD. This was the lowest rated beer in the AAL bracket, finishing just below Bud Light."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale golden colored with a trace of white head barely appearing. Light Brussel's lacing. Aroma of corn and faint bittering hops. The mouth is light and crisp. I get corn,light malt and a trace of bittering hops. This is for hot weather and is highly quaffable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Flavor: mild flavor of corn sweetness, some white bread, a hint of hops in the finish."

"O - Nothing special or good here. If you need a cheap American lager pick Miler High life, actually. This, however is derivative at not really worth your time. You can find cheaper that you wont notice if it's worse or even better for that matter."

"This beer gets a bad wrap from some people but really this is probably one of the best brews from miller that I know of.. People getting this and complaining seem like they don't even realize what theyre buying.. It isn't meant to be a craft beer at all.. It simply suppose to taste like a fresh draft beer.. that's it.. and to me it tastes BETTER than many drafts.. I will admit the taste can vary.. sometimes they taste better than others.. and tbh The PAST mgd seemed better than whats made now.. But maybe its my tastes changing, no idea. But it has a very cereal grainy smell to it.. stronger than any beer I can think of.. everytime I smell it I think ""cereal"". it has a lot of carbonation and in my opinion, a decent taste. When I buy beer this is basically the cheapest beer I will ever buy, and it sure does the trick for what It is.. The only complaint I might have is I can drink ALOT of them.. seems like an 18 pack of these doesn't last long.. black crown is the same way... something about them makes u wanna drink em fast..."

"Quenches the thirst nicely. I always keep some in the fridge. Never drink water when you can drink beer!"

"DATE TASTED: January 10, 2014... GLASSWARE: Ommegang pokal...OCCASION: Shan's winterm is over; new Shark tank... APPEARANCE: two-finger swiftly declining soupy white head; slightly sallow, golden body with sparse bubbles; lacing is cloudy and sporadic... AROMA: sharp, pingy hops; malts are corny with wafts of honey and syrup... PALATE: gas-inducing, rather thin body; lingering aftertaste; oily and resilient...TASTE: sweet, almost lip-puckering sweet corn malt akin to thee malt liquor swigged in college... OVERALL: a top-shelf beer-fridge filler and a third-beer-of-the-night kind of quality; does not distinguish itself from the rest of the miller production line..."

"*Overall, this is an average beer. For adjunct lagers, it not half bad! It does have a draft type creamy feel, but it is just your standard American lager. But I was pleasantly supprised to see how the lacing stuck around at the bottom of the glass. I wouldn't ever pass up an MGD, although, I'd just not go out of my way to buy some."

"Not particularly offensive, it has no flavours that taste particularly bad; but it tastes like nothing. Reminded me of Perrier. A beer I would drink again at a party or somewhere that I want to get drunk cause it goes down smooth like the water it tastes like, but nothing I would ever purchase."

"Of all the American macro lagers I have tried, Miller Genuine Draft was one of the lightest on flavor, aroma and mouthfeel. This is truly carbonated water disguised as beer."

"A guilty pleasure. Sometimes You just need a light heavy beer, and this one fits the bill nicely. Pours a dark golden color. A solid head that condensed quickly. It drinks easily, and is quite carbonated. The taste dissipated quickly. Quite refreshing."
"One of the better examples of the style."
"Overall: This is what I thought all beer tasted like when I was a kid. The quintessential ""EW, GROSS!"" taste that everyone is familiar with back when you were ~6 years old and dad let you get a sip - a fond memory, looking back on it... back to the beer itself: i'd never go out of my way for it, and 9 times out of 10 i'd pass up buying it if i saw it. never turn down a free one though, and this would be great while doing some charcoal grilling, gritty yard work, car maintenance, or after a rough shift. there's a grit to it that is kind of charming, but also kind of gross."

"was this beer always this bad? I feel like when I was a kid and I went fishing with my dad and he would give me a can of this stuff, it had some appeal. some sort of honest outdoorsy quality. well, its completely gone. maybe I grew up, maybe they changed the recipe, who knows, but this stuff isn't even fit to batter the fish we used to catch with. the color is closer to mountain dew than a lager, is there honestly yellow 5 in this?! it smells like a corny adjunct, but it tastes more chemical than that. almost with an antifreeze sort of potency to it, its daunting. at least coors light and its peers still taste like beer to some degree, this taste like preservatives and artificial sweeteners. I can imagine how bad the 64 is, because its parent beer is a shocker. feel isn't that bad, a little thicker than it should be, but the carbonation is fine. overall this is something to avoid. it would chose it over some of the basement dwellers and budlight on principle, but this is really disgusting. the clear bottles do it no favors either."

"I tried this beer one time during the summer of 2012 and thought it was an ok to slightly decent beer. It is not a beer that i would have all of the time, but I would probably recommend it to another to try it. The taste was distinct and was very smooth and different from Miller High Life. The process of making a draft beer gives this beer a different characteristic."

"I'm real hard pressed to find a reason why this beer is so hated... other than beer snobbery. Maybe this beer is different in the States, but I doubt it since it is imported, not out-sourced brewed, up to Canada. Take it from me, this beer is good. There may not be anything to be learned about beer when drinking this, but hey, isn't that kind of the point sometimes?"

"I bought this because it was one of the first beers I liked when I first started drinking when I turned 21 and my birthday is approaching so I thought it would be good to retry it. Bad decision. This is one of the worst beers I have ever had. It has less taste than Miller Lite. Avoid this if all possible."

"Single finger white frothy head with nice lacing on a state to bright golden clear body. Aroma is pretty bad with mostly pale malts/barley and musty wet sock hops. A lot of malt in the flavor with mild bitterness from the hops and little in the way of sweetness. Light to medium body but still fairly oily coating the palate and moderate carbonation. I think miller is the worst of the big three for flavors and drinkability. This one reinforces that belief."
""
"24 oz. can into a mason jar. Pours clear, muted urine-sample yellow with the metallic, slightly malty fragrance common to American macro lagers. Watery and bubbly in the mouth. Little taste to speak of, but lightly sweet, lightly bitter and very easy to drink. An inoffensive, crisp, cheap beer that is better than other beers at its price point."
""
"Pours out to a sudsy white head that falls to a permanent 3mm head, significant lacing and pale yellow-gold color. Aroma is sweet, grainy, grassy and slightly skunky. Flavor is a weak mixture of sweet, grainy, corny, and slight tinge of over processed hops. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation generous and rather watery. On the balance, this is a marginally decent adjunct lager and reminds me a bit of Corona."

"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a transparent straw color with a large white head that dissipates quickly and disappears. Smells of cereal grain and corn, no hops at all. Tastes of corn and grain, not much in the ways of hops, and very bland but not watered down. Carbonation is heavy like most macros but it is very smooth for its light body. Overall, slightly below average beer."

"Overall, it just isn't a good beer. The mouthfeel pretty good, but it tastes and smell bad. I'm constantly surprised to find people bringing it to parties or storing it in their fridge. I can see how some people may find it average (at best) but I don't. Also, it is utterly terrible if not served chilled."

"Relating this beer to other mass produced adjuncts, it is extremely flavorful and refreshing."

"On tap at the AH Americsn Legion # 208. Served in a plastic cup. Light yellow color. Clear. Forms a bubbly white head that quickly reduces to a patchy surface coating. Smells of grain and corn. Taste is more of the same: sweet, corny, and grainy with just hint of toasty bitterness. Light bodied with a ""mealy"" mouthfeel Heavy carbonation. Overall a standard shitty American brew."

"Drank straight from the bottle. A dehydrate urine type of yellow, Standard of most Adjunct Lagers so nothing special going on there. There isn't very much to say about the smell either, Smells of some corn and perhaps some barley here and there. The taste is where this AAL surprised me. Easily the best offering from the Miller company that I have had to date, Perhaps slightly beating High Life. It doesn't just taste of carbonated water like most other standard AAL's and it is very easy to drink. Mouthfeel has some bubbles and a cooked corn aftertaste, Though sweet corn. Over all a great AAL"
""
"Overall I guess I have found a very lackluster beer even for an adjunct lager. Giving this more than an average score is like calling yourself an alcoholic."
"Overall - This is better than I thought it was going to be. It's very drinkable, but nothing special."

"High Life is cheaper, and a better value, but MGD is still very enjoyable."

"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a small sweetness and a small skunkiness. In the taste, a small sweetness in the malt and then nothing. A small bite and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry to sweetness in the aftertaste. Watery and a sweetness and really not much going on."
"Overall – Not a bad brew for what its’ worth. I try not to be a beer snob. Is this beer bad compared to what else is out there? Yes. But relatively speaking, its’ drinakable. I Would buy it again and drink it again. Its’ a good change of pace from Bud Diesel and Coors, and a hell of a lot better than its’ lite counterpart."

"Bit of an impulse tasting that went bad. In appearance it resembles any light beer (clear and empty) with a similar taste. The smell was week but consistant. Mouthfeel is not initially unpleasant but rapidly deteriorates into a disappointing aftertaste. Overall its not that bad, If I were to enjoy lighter beers I might not mind this one but all things considered this is not my go to beer my a long shot."

"Pours just about clear, smell has alot of grain and hop, very plain. Good balance in the taste, definitely some hops in there. Acidic character, alcohol, a bit of metallic taste. Crispy feel but burns a bit, and a little sharp, and watery at the same time, still pretty drinkable, leaves a dry feeling"

"Pours a clear pale yellow with a soapy head that does not last very long. A lot of carbonation. No lacing on the glass to speak of. Aroma is corn and cereal with a faint hop smell. Taste is pretty much a match of the aroma. Very watery and thin bodied. Overall it is not offensive, but not something I would drink."

"Pours out an extremely clear morning urine yellow color. The head retention is actually quite impressive as is the amount of carbonation. However I don't think all those bubbles will add anything positive to the mouthfeel. The smell is actually less solvent and offensive as I've found their other beers but far from good. What I can smell is a barely perceptible bready smell, and other weird cereal grain smells. No hop presence at all. Wow, tastes like, your average mindless American beer. It's even more marginal than i thought it would be. It's not even bad enough to suck! How disappointing! Some stale bread flavors, old soggy grains, and hmm, can't pickup the corn. The corn adjuncts must have been genetic bred out of the beer and covered up by those other faint flavors I am describing. Mouthfeel is kind of prickly but again nothing too offensive. I think Miller has developed some space age beer flavor now that they are just adding to their beers rather than really brewing anything. How do you think they pulled of MGD 64? Carbonated water and beer flavor concentrate, right out of the can...."
""
""
"Pours a pale yellow, crystal clear with a white soapy head. Smells lightly of some cereal grains. The flavor is light grainy character. Very litte if any hop profile. Mouthfeel is watery. Overall not something I would spend money on, but light and non-offensive and easy to drink."

"O - Avoid if you like interesting and flavourful beer."
"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle marked FEB0612-B05040047. Sampled on January 25, 2012. I would prefer this in a can but I also prefer not to buy a lot of it so I could only find a 6 pack in bottles. Pretty average looking American lager yellow pour with a burst of white fizzy head then nothing. Aroma is grain, cereal, and bread. The body is thin. The taste also rather bready with a clean enough hop finish for the American Adjunct style. Burger beer."

"The MGD looks good, smells good and tastes good. It definately comes across as trying to present ""fresh from a keg"". I like that, which is why I rated it so high. Anything out of a bottle is going to taste better than something out of a can. But side by side against the Rolling Rock, I'd have to give it to the MGD."

"This beer poured a pale yellow, with a two finger head. Good lacing. The smell was hard to define, corn, grass, and maybe a little skunk. The carbonation was a little over the top, too much for the style. The taste was bland, with a little corn flavor. Overall an easy session beer, and by far, the best offering Miller has in their lineup."

"Edit: After letting it ""breathe"" for about 20 minutes, it becomes slightly less rancid."
"Overall – Another beer that would work well for camping/cutting the grass etc. Not something I'd buy again however."
"O: I did not hate this beer as much I expected to, but that being said, I would only reach for this if I were severely strapped for cash. Decent enough for what it is."
"O: Unimpressive but smooth as it is very watery. Not much flavor and a very simple brew. Best drunk fast and cold on a sweltering night."
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty good in style. Not a good beer, but good in style. (I had to reiterate). Refreshing, light, slightly flavorful. Am I the only person here who actually rates by style still?"
"Dr: Easily poundable, as evidenced by frat boys. Decent price, but low quality. A true student beer, though budget wise High Gravity Steel Reserve is better."
"Like I mentioned before, this beer has an off-putting taste that I believe is one of the worst in the business. I gave it a 1.5 overall because beer is better than no beer."
"Bottom Line: Desperation beer."
"Crystal clear, straw yellow with a finger of bright white foam on top. Clumpy lacing stuck to the top of the glass, decent head retention. The aroma was quite sweet, cereal grains and slight corn. Low bitterness with lingering sweetness, perhaps a hint of grassiness. More cereal and cooked corn. Light bodied, thin and very dry, fizzy carbonation."
"If I was at a party and had to drink a BMC this is it. Not great but the lesser of the evils. It doesnt have a great color, there is absolutely no head retention, the taste is that of adjunct, and I don't even know if your could describe water as a mouth feel"
"Probably the most tolerable mass produced American lager. Smells of grains, corn is most prominent, and perhaps some slight hops. Tastes of corn and some malty sweetness, slight bitter metallic hop flavor, but much less discernible than is found in other American lagers. Definitely smooth and more drinkable than other cheap beers, but still tastes pretty bland. This is one of my cheap fallback beer when I can’t (or don't want to) spend more money."
"O - Poor, yet has some perks. I cannot understand why this is so popular, maybe it is simply the availability? Who knows? A last resort beer."
"Overall, this is one of the blandest beers I can recall having. I'm glad i only paid a dollar for this bottle."
"Food match: Anything really, you won't taste the beer anyhow so go nuts... chilli, pastrami, wasabi fries with a side of hot English mustard... yeah no, forget the last one."
"D - Maybe okay on a hot summer day, but other than that, I don't really care for anything this beer has to offer."
"I prefer it over Bud but this is still a very weak lager. Very nice bottle though..."
"Overall it's not something I'd actually purchase, but at someone else's barbeque it was free, so I gave it a try."
"This beer is a pale clear yellow color with a white head that comes and goes very quickly. I remember not minding this beer at one time but now I can't even stand it. The smell is of grains and corn, the flavor is also with a bit of rice there too. The mouthfeel is very thin like club soda almost. Overall it just doesn't appeal to me."
"This beer is ok. The only time I drink it is when the waitress at some restaurant tells me they don't have High Life. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink this beer. It's not bad, its not great, its just a beer that is carried everywhere and is better than its BMC light brethren."
"Verdict: While it’s still bland and thin compared to the rest of the beer world, MGD actually has a decent wedge of malty character for this style. Still, given a choice between this and its cousin High Life, I’d choose the latter every time."
"This isn't as good as most macros and given the price (12.75/6 in Canada), is likely best left ignored. (Labatt ver.)"
"Final Grade: 3.13, a passable C+. MGD is nothing special, but it's still a serviceable macro lager. Here in Canada, Miller brands seriously lack the market penetration they presumably enjoy in the States - I literally cannot remember the last time I saw someone buying this stuff. That being said, this is the sort of pale lager I could drink all night and not get sick of - light and refreshing, and without the obnoxious corn and cardboard flavours I often find in cheaper offerings of this stripe. It's not the sort of thing I'd ever buy regularly, but if someone handed me one of these at a party or campfire, I'd just be thankful it wasn't Budweiser (or even worse: a light beer)."
"Crisp clean and refreshing. Light bodied yet pretty cloying to my taste. Can't drink too many Macro's in a row."
"High carbonation. An average example of an undesirable style."
"More corn taste, high carbonation, corn syrup sweetness without the viscosity, likely from copious amounts of water. Aftertaste is slightly unpleasant, like old wood and bad malt liquor. Just not a good beer. I like many of the adjunct products made in Wisconsin, and this smells delicious when its being made from a distance, (like right around the Marquette interchange), but it is simply not good."
"D: Of the big adjunct junk out there, this packs more flavor than most."
"(there something nice.)"
"Poured a clear pee-pee color, with lots of carbonation, and a finger of bubbly white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of pee-pee and stale grains, Indian corn that's been hanging on the door too long. Tastes of skunk and more pee-pee, sickeningly sweet, with a rotten aftertaste. Yummy."
"O-refreshing. this carbonated water has hints of corn and beer."
"O - MGD is very drinkable and very refreshing. It's probably not the best adjunct lager in its price range, though."
"D: Not bad. One of those every day beers."
"Overall, there was nothing particularly wrong with the beer, but there was also not anything right about it. I actually had trouble finishing it because I just lost interest. I can now bury that part of my youth and move on."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth beer accompanied with bland flavours and aromas. This beer lacks alot of flavours and I don't think I would even drink this to get drunk."
"It was bowling night last Saturday....and yes....unfortunately the bowling alley in the small town I live in has a dismal selection. But when you bowling with friends...pitchers of MGD is not that bad. The appearance of MGD is fine...its a clear golden with good carbonation and head. The smell...what smell. The taste is well....beer. Certainly can call this a lawn mower beer for several obvious reasons. Enjoy and stay thirsty my friends!"
"Incredibly boring - bland and flavourless. It's dull to look at and has little aroma, taste or body. Amazing to think that this is one of the best selling brands in the US. Avoid - there are so many better beers out there."
"D: After having a few quality craft beers you could probably go through a case of this stuff."
" I would prefer not to drink this often but I don't think I'd turn one down if I was in want of a beer and low on cash. It isn't the worst thing I've ever had. I'd rather get a light buzz from this than resort to drinking certain wretched malt liquors just because of the higher ABV."
"Overall this is the best adjunct lager ive had. Good on a summer day to slug down. IM GRADING THIS ON A MACRO LAGER SCALE AND ITS A GOOD ONE FOR THE STYLE."
"Pours a very clear golden color with a thick white head and no lacing. Smells of corn adjuncts and sweetness, very bland. Tastes much the same of sweet corn, light malts, and overall very common to light shit of its style. Thick carbonation. Overall it is pretty trashy."
"Drinkability: Seriously. If this is the only beer available...I'll take a soft drink or iced tea. For me...this is not drinkable."
"Drinkability - If i want to plow through a dozen beers, MGD would be on my list of beers to use!"
"Slammed back one of these this past weekend with a few hot dogs at Coney Island in Worcester, MA. Looks like a standard macro - pale yellow color and lots of carbonation. Smell was sorta like a cross between lettuce and rice. Taste was mostly bland but wasn't super offensive or anything like that. Mouthfeel was decent, as it was smooth going down. A drinkable beer in my mind. Nothing horrible flavor-wise, and tastes a bit better than Bud. A bbq beer or party beer if nothing else is available."
"Miller High Life has this one beat, as do thousands of other beers. Not my favorite macro lager."
"pretty basic beer going on here, flavors being a little faint my be helping its cause"
"had this in many different cities across this great land and its too bad this was my beer of choice when i was a young lad. Not at all what I would consider to be a choice for drinking now. I would much rather have water and wont even offer to my friends. I rated this high in drinkability because I think you can drink your own weight of this stuff."
"D- This is alcoholic water. In a pinch, not wanting to insult friends, it's better than Bud...not saying much."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Pours a golden yellow colour with a finger of white foamy head. No lacing, but head retention was pretty good. Smells quite grainy with a hint of grassy hops. Flavour is incredibly clean, I'm surprised I'm enjoying this when I fully expected to hate it. Enjoying doesn't mean it is good, but it isn't awful either. Much smoother mouthfeel than many macro lagers. I would take this over Canadian, Blue, etc."
"I'm reviewing this beer because of the place it holds in my heart. We all need a measuring stick when it comes to tasting beer and I use this beer to set my taste-o-beer meter at 1. All of my friends thought the stuff is delicious, but I never got it's appeal."
"This beer looks smells and tastes bad. Would not suggest this for anyone. It must taste good to some people or it would not be around. It is like most Miller products, just bad. wish I had something good to say about it really can't think of anything."
"D- Off flavors make this watery beer undeserving of even the word refreshing."
"This beer served it's purpose today well. It reminded us just how great a great beer can be and just how bad a bad beer can be. Compared to a fine Belgian ale this is a stark contrast. Now lets dump the rest of this beer into the soup and bring out an ale please."
"I would most likely ""swill"" this one again if I was going for a 40oz beer rather than a stronger malt liquor."
"This was one of the first brands I tried when I hit drinking age and I got a six pack now just to retry after 20+ years. I can't believe I've got 5 more of these I have to use up."
"Notes: Not actually too bad (just tasteless), but I would actually prefer a plain Budweiser over this."
"The worst part about this beer is the taste and that is all that you really need to know. Avoid this one at all costs."
"Even way back when I knew nothing about good beer at all, I still couldn't stomach this beer. And that says a lot. Horrible stuff."
"I don't have a lot of respect for brewers that bottle their hard work in a clear bottle. I guess they are not very proud of this one...neither am I. I tried to get a head during the pour, but even with all my talent, no luck. This brew is a light yellow color, rating a 3 on the SRM chart. One of the lightest brews I have seen. Smells like wet straw and rice. The taste is a little better than the smell, because there is less of it. Rice and wet wheat are the predominate tastes, with a little malt, no bite at all. Mouthfeel is bland, almost like the beer takes something away, leaving a hole. This is another lawn work beer...I would rather do yard work than drink this beer."
"D: Enjoyable, yet strong vegetal flavours & aromas take away form my ability & desire to have another, even after drinking a few..."
"D= easily a 6-pack on a hot summer day if you actually like it. Great in the on-tap version as well."
"Either way, very easy to drink, inoffensive but very thin. Not bad for a summer time refreshment."
"From a plastic twist-top bottle comes beer #11 of Swill Tour 2010, and another oddly short and to-the-point collection of thoughts. It pours a clear jaundice topped by nearly a finger of white foam. The nose is of metallic Styrofoam. That's all I can say about this smell. The taste is closer to burnt puffed rice and Corn Flakes. The body is exceedingly light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish. Overall, a sad brew, not offensive but nowhere near good."
"The appearance is that of a normal AAL. It's a semi-light golden clear color. The smell is of rice and corn syrup. The smell isn't that amazing. The taste is OK. There is the same tastes as smells, plus there is an almost iron/steel-like taste. That's all I have to say about it. The mouthfeel is decent. It's kinda drinkable."
"Very chuggable but not very enjoyable."
"Although this does seem just the same as alot of other basic full flavored beers, It to me is exceptionaly refreshing. A great taste, an easy smell and a smooth quality. Again everybody has their opinions and own desired taste. For me, this is my comfort beer."
"Drinkability: on a hot hot day at a baseball game with extremely limited choices, I will frequently choose MGD over having no beer at all. Otherwise, not particularly drinkable."
"Pours a pure white, two-finger head that goes quickly to a ring and leaving some lace. Medium carbonation and light bodied. Crystal clear pale straw color. Nose is ?? - no skunkiness. Flavor is sweet corn and grass. Squeaky clean finish. Good lawn mower beer. Better than MGD 64 light but that isn't saying much. $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"D - Not as bad as Bud Light (My least favourite so far) but still a very unimpressive Lager. Gave my glass away after a few sips. Can't believe I use to drink this stuff."
"D: I could physically drink quite a few of these, do I want to? Not really. The carbonation makes you quite gassy. I could see this giving me a wicked hanging over."
"The body is normal for the style-- light body with lots of carbonation. Not really any problem drinking this-- but again, like so many other beers, I'd really rather just have a water. If it came down to drinking this or not drinking, I would honestly think about it. In a social setting, like a BBQ, I perhaps would drink a few while hanging out, but this is certainly not something I would have sitting at my house."
"D: this is a summertime party guzzler or lawnmower beer, and nothing else. The exclusion of taste has worked pretty well for the macro brews, you have to admit!"
" Bright yellow in color with a thin head and lots of carbonation. Smells sort of like wet hay or grassy. Body is fairly light with a thicker coating on the mouth feel than I was expecting. Otherwise leaves little aftertaste, and not as watery as many similar brews. Definitely one that I could drink during those hot summer days camping with the guys. I actually find this to be somewhat pleasant, although basic. Would go well with peanuts and dogs at the ball game also..."
"Overall not a horrible beer by any means, but the lack of flavor put up against some of the others I had this week just makes it pale. Still on a 100 degree day, they can go down like water."
"Oh well, I will choke down the six pack and do my own beer runs."
"D: I know this is supposed to be pretty similar to High Life, and there are some obvious parallels, but this is more expensive and a lot less tasty - why is there a market for this beer? Not out and out bad, but there's little to suggest it even amongst American macros."
"D - wouldn't buy again, wouldn't drink if free."
"Not great by any stretch of the imagination, but not a pour-down-the-drain either. On occasion, not a big deal to have."
"Absolutely the worse beer on the planet. If you like low alcohol, no taste beer, you are either an alcoholic, or a bum, and you probably love this stuff. If you are a REAl beer drinker, you know better than this. STAY AWAY! Definitely in the top 2-3 worst beers in the world, and I'm ashamed of being an American when I see people drink this."
"Drinkability is less than pond water."
"Overall impression: MGD is boring as all get out, but it seems to be a spot-on manifestation of a Premium American / American Adjunct Lager. It is watery, bland, and hardly memorable. A positive comment would be that it has no significant downsides whereas a more pertinent comment would be that there is really no reason to drink MGD when one could have a more flavorful PDB or Coors. Sorry."
"D- Meh. There are better macros out there."
"D- might as well drink a water with lemon in it. Why even pay for this?"
"(D)- I could put these away one after another if I felt like it. Very light and refreshing with almost nothing to it."
"The beer appears the color of gold can with the words Miller genuine Draft. The aroma is of corn, aspirations, rice, and grain. The flavor is corn and grain with a dash of alcohol and a touch of metal. There's a lower moderate sweetness to it. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery. There's not much else to say, the beer is bland and inoffensive."
"[Drinkability]: Low. I wouldn't buy nor drink this beer again."
"Overall not at par with High Life. Way too much corn."
"RJT"
"I feel like a real beer-snob trashing almost every ""common"" lager I come across, but once you have tasted a good beer, these just can't compare."
"My pour got me an easy two fingers of bone-white head that immediately began to settle in for the afternoon. Only the stock market, this past Thursday, fell faster. Unlike the market, this left behind something pretty in its wake. Stone may pooh-pooh fizzy yellow beers all they want, but this was nice. A beautiful sunshine-yellow beer with exemplary NE-quality clarity. The nose, however, was rank with adjuncts. Corn simply jumped out at me, speaking of Nebraska. Wow! Mouthfeel was on the thin side and there was a slight lager sweetness to it, but mostly, it was simply bland. Finish was moderately sweet with a slight tang, but nothing worth noting. I fet like Emilio Estevez's character in ""Repo Man"" watching the Circle Jerks as a lounge act and remarking, ""Man, I used to like these guys!?!"" Was it enough to make me want to rip the badges/patches off of my first jacket? No, but don't look for Miller products to get that kind of placement on recent jackets, either."
"If you're looking for an American Macro Lager, you could do better, or you could do worse than this. It is what it is. A clean, refreshing, non-offensive beer.Light, a little thin, when this stuff is cold, it's great for slaking a hard day's night's thirst. Personally prefer High Life (at a lower cost) but this has enough of that "" Miller"" flavor to be a good change-up. Is it a great West Coast IPA or a great German dopplebock? no. Does it try to be? no. What it is is a pretty decent brew in the American Macro style, and I've drank a helluva lot worse."
"D - A decent beer. Have had many of these in the past but not something I generally seek out. Would only consider having another in the absence of craft beer (like today)."
"Final Thoughts - Used to pound these back back in the early college days before I was enlighted in beer-dom. Used to HATE beer because of MGD. Decided to try it a few days ago and see if my opinion had changed...it didn't...."
"D - To me this is one of the worst from the style, I just hate those tart/fruity/apple like notes, ugh! I don't hate this style though, so don't get me wrong. Don't like this one at all though, I'd pass for a Bud any day, but over that I'd take a Schlitz, which is currently my favorite for the style."
"Overall: I honestly don't have much to say about MGD either way. It's not as good as Miller Lite, which is more refined, but isn't repulsive."
"I understand that I write these reviews almost entirely for the converted - those who, like me, share in the pleasures of real and diverse beers - and although there cannot be many whose minds can be converted simply by the act of reading this, any MGD drinkers out there, I implore you to try different styles and give your local microbrewery a chance."
"Eh...not really one to seek out and get."
"[Reviewed at a beer sampling]"
"Congratulations MGD, you are the winner in the Miller taste testing of 1/24/10."
"Appearance is a light golden color with a light crisp head. Smell of a slightly sweet corn cereal. Taste has the light sweet corn, mild hop and a metallic flavor thats a little watered down. Mouthfeel is light with fair body with good carbonation. It's not terrible, but I still prefer the High Life."
"I though this was going to be like high life, boy was I wrong. this is definitely noticeably obviously much worse than highlife. holy crap, was this sixer a waste of money. shit. well its watery the head dies quicker than charlie up against some silver fish, and the smell is oddly metallic for a glass bottle. the feel is easy drinking, easy chugging actually."
"D: I did not find this an altogether enjoyable experience, but I didn't mind drinking it for ""old times"" sake. There have certainly been a few nights of MGD in the past, but now I remember why I don't drink it anymore."
"Flat, undercarbonated and just not enjoyable mouthfeel in any way. Unless maybe you are dehydrated in the desert."
"An unquestionable and dramatic improvement as opposed to Miller High Life; you may be mildly surprised...then again...."
"there are way better macros out there, don't settle for this garbage"
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability? Too damn boring to enjoy this even on a hot summer's day. If I want a simple Lager that actually is refreshing from Miller, I'll stick with the High Life."
"Carbonation is huge, and of course, the body is extremely watery."
"D - The whole point of this beer is to be drinkable, get tanked on. Well, with it's lack of charactere, I find the drinkability of this beer to be extremely low."
"Drinkability: Ahh, cold-filter me away to beer heaven, Miller!"
"its a pretty good beer for after for watching a football game with the guys."
"D- Nothing was particularly *bad* about this beer but I could by many flavorful beers for the same price."
"Clean. Almost no flavour, but, beside that, no defect."
"MGD is a ""run of the mill"" American lager. I had it served very cold. Poured a moderate yellow, thin head with a grainy smell. Taste was ""strong", it has a bit of a bite to it which was a pleasant surprise. Mouthfeel is crips and a little heavier than I expected. If it were offered to me at someones house, I certainly wouldn't turn my nose up at it. Drink it with some chips and dip or a hot dog, it's OK."
"my favorite macro. good solid beer taste, close to perfect amount of carbonation, and i havent had any problems with skunky smell as of yet. taste is smooth right out of the bottle. great macro to keep on hand at home when you dont want company to drink your expensive craft beers. good compromise when short on cash, too. i would reccomend this beer as an overall good macro beer."
"Mostly sweet malts with somewhat balanced bittering, lots of sweet corn cereal develops. Tastes like corn pops on the finish. Pretty similar to High Life actually, but not as bitter. No idea why less bitter sounds like a good idea to some people when this has a sticky sugar cereal flavor that sticks around for some time. Light body and medium carbonation, feels quite nice."
"D: This beer is not as gereat as it's sister beer, Miller High Life. It is due to the Cold Filtering. I will drink this beer again."
"D: I'm sorry, but no matter how many differnet adjunct lagers I try - they all reminds me of coloured (light) water with a buzz. This one is not the worst adjunct lager I've tried, if I'm trying to be nice."
"Poured into a pint glass (for effect only) this brew has a straw color with a thin white head. The smell is a little grainy and has a mild aluminum taste. It is a little more full body and has a higher carbonation than some of it's ""lighter"" siblings. I could and will sit and drink a few of these watching the Badger game, but still not a great drink."
"I have just noticed something really funny about this brew in particular. I just drank a thick stout, then drank one of these only to find that I taste a LOT of concord grapes! I dont know why or how, but thats what im gettin!"
"Very disappointed I had been debating trying this beer because it says genuine draft I thought it may be like HL with more character but it's not and it's more expensive. Don't bother with this one."
"Drinkability- Overall not a terrible drink for what it is, I have to say its slightly better then I remember after also recently having some of its competitors in the non light category aka bud and coors and I would have to say this is the best of the bunch, not sure how it compares to yuengling probably a little below but not terrible, not something id seek often but for a cheap night of drinker theres worse roads to travel down,"
"This was my ""drink beer all day"" choice a long time ago and now that I much prefer an ale or a Weiss beer I did not know what to expect. But those good memories I associated with it came back to me quickly. Its appearance, the golden bubbly color with a 1 inch head that dissipates quickly is a little off-putting, but allows me to drink a mouthful or two before walking out of the beer tent with its uneven grass covered ground and mud everywhere. Besides the barley smell there is very little aroma present, and the flavor doesn't exhibit anything spectacular, but it is still a drinkable beer that is consistent after all this time, and is no less refreshing than it once was."
"My GF is from Milwaukee and sticks up for this stuff, SO (in the event that she reads this), since I have nothing nice to say, I am not going to say anything further."
"Overall, an average version of the style. If you have people coming over who don't enjoy craft beer, stocking in some of this would probably get them by."
"Poured from a can into a weizen glass. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Has a mild aroma with hints of corn. Taste is mild, refreshing but without much flavor. Feels watery in the mouth and is fairly drinkable. Overall nothing special about this one."
"The mouth is pretty slick and wet. Flavor is really mellow and bland. Some husky grains in the mouth that finishes a tad sweet. Bitterness is low to absent. I could drink a few of these on a camping trip, or after a day in the yard. I thought this was much better than the ""High Life"" counterpart. Not bad."
"Bottom line: I'm surprised, this beer is another in a long line of dissapointing Macros. Could this be as bad as the budweiser line? You decide. Later."
"MGD. My father being a Miller guy I grew up around this and I must say that I am not too impressed by it. It is your average piss yellow Miller product with a similar taste. It is very drinkable and I can see how on a hot summer day someone would reach for one to be refreshed. This beer is only tolerable for me if used for beer pong."
"Pours a clear yellow golden like color with a minimal head and no lacing. The smell is of corn but is feint and almost no existant. The taste is watery and there is not much going on there. It is a taste of corn with a little sweetness at the end. The mouthfeel is okay, noting really going on it is a little watery. Overall there just isn't much here, you could drink a lot because it is easy drinking but there is nothing to enjoy. Again just to add something a spice some hops anything to liven it up would help."
"The appearance was just a dull, light golden thin liquid with minimal lacing. It smelled like a bowl of corn flakes with sugar on top. I don't know. I like waking up to it in the morning. The taste is just this straight unfunky, unadjunct beer taste with kiss of sweet ness. The mouthfeel wasn't bad for how lame the appearance was. As far as drinkability goes, if you put a cold 12 pack in front of me it'll be gone quick. It holds a decent flavor for a while unlike anything AB has ever put out."
"We got a carton of this beer from a grateful client so had to review it,it pours a light amber hue that is well carbonated but looks lifeless,it has feint aromas of watery grain,it has a very dull taste with no solid mouthfeel at all and actually tastes of watery,grain,malt water quite horrible actually and would never buy this and hope that you do the same."
"I'm surprised at so many negative reviews on a classic American beer. This is a great dinner beer. Mild, not over-powering, so you don't lose the taste of the foods you're eating. Doesn't sit heavy in the stomach either. No preservatives, which is something I like, as nitrite preservatives give me a headache. I can drink this all night long, without worrying about a hangover. For the price, it ain't too bad. I prefer the bottle over the can. Can seems to have a tinny after-taste."
"Pours a straw color with fluffy head and lacing, for style it actually looks kind of good. Smell is creamed corn, taste is the same, a bit too sweet and no bitternes at all just a slight wierd of taste. Not as bad as natty lite and not as good as PBR or Coors. edited, this was written before the decision on whether or not to finish the can. It gets really unpleasant as it warms."
"Clear 40 ounce bottle with no freshness date. After enjoying a couple rye beers and some IPA's, this was a nite cap. I am intrigued by a beer that comes in a 40 ounce bottle for a couple bucks. its sole purpose is to satisfy thirst and induce drunkeness. This beer should only be drank at the end of the night and ice cold, just don't sniff it."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"the beer is very drinkable and refreshing. and it does the job. dont expect much more from it."
"D - Despite lacking in almost every category, this is my go-to 3.2 beer (well, besides High Life) because it excels in the drinkability category."
"D - It would, of course, be easy to drink a whole lot of this, but there is not much going on here to motivate consumption. This beer is nothing more than an alcohol delivery system, and it is not particularly good, even for what it is."
"The beer did it's job with the pizza though. I don't dislike macros, and I think this one is fine. I am not sure where I would rank it, but would advice Canadians who enjoy Molson Canadian that this beer seems like a decent, albeit sweeter alternative."
"For some reason, possibly due to my surroundings and distractions, this went down fairly well, lack of overt off-flavours and all. So, I guess the lesson here is: don't pay too much attention, and you can drink this, even enjoyably! Sums up the typical BMC marketing ethos, I'd say."
"I don't know what all the fuss is about. This is by no means my favorite beer but it is not terrible. For the price this is not a bad beer."
"Drinkability: It's okay, not something I'd want to sit down and drink for flavor, but it goes well with a burger or hot dog."
"Pours a transparent pale yellow color with a white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are faint - some biscuity barley malt, dried grass perhaps. Mouth-feel is thin and watery - average for the style. Tastes are limited - mild malt, some soggy cereal, trace hops, with a dried grassy character. Finishes crisp and is actually refreshing. Of all the American 'macro' lagers out there, I think I prefer this one - they are all very similar, but when looking for something to quench thirst, this does a pretty good job. It's nothing special, but there's nothing terribly bad about it either - besides that it obviously lacks some flavor."
"Drinkability - while this would be known for its drinkability, it's really a below-average beer that goes down easy but lacks the more enjoyable elements of beer."
"Taste: Little taste good or bad but fuller then I would have thought which is good. The lack of taste makes it worse though. What is there is a slight sweetness but very little and absolutely no bitterness."
"Overall, not something I enjoyed very much. I just got it from a friend so I figured I'd throw up a review. Not something I will ever be purchasing or drinking again."
"Drinkability doesn't completely fail, but only because it is so widely consumed by now most people are probably accustomed to its unworthy characteristics."
"A light golden color with loads of carbonation and a shoet fizzy head. Aroma of grain,canned corn,and hay. Flavor is light and mild as expected,malty for a macro Pale Lager but very little going on as far as aroma or flavor,slightly metallic aftertaste...meh ! Drinkable but noting special."
"D - good for beer pong."
"D = at 3 bucks and some change for a 40 oz bottle, you can drink it to get drunk. If served extremely cold, it could substitute a soda at a softball game. But this would never make it to my dinner table."
"D: One of the worse macros. Would be one of my last choices even if being used back in college for a drinking game."
"This is among the least offensive tasting non-craft lagers out there."
"D: Another sub-par college party beer. Not good, but not quite ""light"". Disappointing."
"Hey, like I said, its really not very good."
"Pours a golden body with strong carbonation visible under a two-finger white head with decent retention but no lacing. Taste and smell is rather weak. I find this to be the standard example of American adjuncts. Weak malt with corn and a small amount of hopiness. Not the best flavor but highly drinkable."
"The worst of the big three due to this salty parched mouth aftertaste."
"This was my first try at this beer, it was just ok to me. It smells and tastes like corn, but didn't leave a bad after taste. To me, this is an average beer, I'd drink it again if one was offered at a party, but would prefer other beers before this one."
"no head, very carbonated, not bitter or sweet, just kinda plain ole beer. good with other american food. Even if I'm half broke, I try to get better, but at most American restaurants, bars, ballgames and rodeos, this would be a better choice."
"ok, the only reason I tried this one was because it was $1.50 a bottle at my job. WAY OVER PRICED, even on sale.the piss color it had was an indicator of what was to come. smelled liked sugar water, tastes like sugar water. this is the beer that made me a pursuer of fine beers. I would not drink this ever again nor would I allow a person I consider a friend to drink this abomination...but on the other hand thank you mgd for forcing me to pursue better tastes."
"Look: Bright golden color, lots of bubbles and a foam finger head, fair lacing; Smell: Concentrated pineapple and grains; Taste: Bland and tasteless mineral water; Mouthfeel: Watery, fizzy and very soft body; Drinkability: It's assumed that is filtered in ice but tastes like mineral water only."
"The taste is bland, but at least not bad. Mouthfeel is nice, no real bad aftertaste at all. It makes it drinkable."
"I picked up a twelve pack of this on a way to a party, i ended up drinking them after i had a couple other beers, but this beer is not as bad as everyone has been saying. I mean its not the greatest beer in the world, but for the price you are gettin a decent beer, Its very light and really easy to drink. the smell is a little odd but no different then bud light or coors. Overall its a decent beer and ill prolly pick up some more!"
"Overall: Better than Coors, worse than Bud, shitty still"
"Okay cheap beer to put into a beer bong. (At least it was 20 years ago when I last bonged a beer.)"
"Poured to a half inch head that didnt last long. Left a little lacing. Beer was a very light yellow and very clear. Not much going on in the bubble area. Very faint smell. More of corny smell. Again not much smell. Tasted light also. Not much of a flavor. Did have a slightly sweet aftertaste. Almost tasted like it was watered down. Felt like water in the mouth. Very thin. I buy this every now and then. Makes a good lawnmower beer. Serve ice cold."
"I don't see much of a place for this product in my refrigerator."
"The strength of the beer is that it is so easy to drink. The watery flavor and soda-like feel make it a pretty mediocre beer, but it also makes it extraordinarily easy to drink. When I want a cheap, easy-drinking beer, MGD is what I go for. The taste is not overwhelmingly bad as with other beers like Bud Light etc., and in big gulps the beer flows down very smoothly. The colder the better."
"Very close to water, but a very light and refreshing beer if that's what you're looking for."
"P.s 50 reviews!"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Surprisingly sweet to begin with, which quickly turns into buttery slickness. Hmm, maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all. Sweetness persists through 'til the finish, which doesn't dry up at all. With a bit of balancing bitterness and a drier finish this would be pretty tolerable, but as it stands the buttery mouthfeel and monotone cooked corn sweetness become pretty tiring after a few ounces."
"D: A pretty good mouthfeel, but the taste was not very good at all. Too much sour bready notes nad some corn taste that made me pretty sick of the beer fairly quickly."
"Blech. Pours darker yellow with a giant white head. Disgusting sugar and corn mixture with a cake-batter twist. The taste? Just as awful. Who added sugar water to this corny nightmare? Love the commercials claiming this is grown-up beer. Maybe for those who grew up drinking Meister Brau. Wait a minute..."
"Drinkability : a not impressed beer in the style American Adjunct lager."
"D: Not really palatable to me. I'd rather drink water."
"The beer, while not great, is pretty drinkable. I don't mind slamming a few around the grill etc. I would never buy it, but I wouldn't turn it down either."
"D - This is easy drinking. Not the tastiest beer, but fairly typical of the style."
"Golden body with a short lived fizzy head. Smells of sweet corn cooked down but not overbearing. Goes down incredibly smooth, does the job for the summer but as fall has arrived it won't stand up. I'll buy it if its on a ridiculous sale but there are better alternatives in the macro world that are better and usually cheaper."
"What an incredibly average brew. I never expected much as far as a great beer from MGD, but it really doesn't have many good characteristics. It's a fizzy yellow beer that lacks taste. No head or aromatics to speak of. A beer for those not yet ready to step up to the world of true brewing. If you are going to buy Miller you might as well go and buy Coors."
"Genuine Draft is yet another American Macro Lager that I haven't had in years. When drinking this style I must continue to remind myself to rate it accordingly. As usual with this style a must drink at ice-cold temps."
"D: Drinkability was less then average overall with some sour citrus notes. Nothing I would care to drink again."
"That being said, I won't be having this voluntarily any time soon."
"Drinkability is kinda whatever. If you're in a pinch, this isn't a bad choice for cheap stuff, but aside from that, I'd steer clear of this stuff and save up for something better."
"Bottle. Swill golden colored, not much head or lacing to speak of. Some earthy, dusty flavor with corn and some semi-sweet malts. Tastes like so many others in the same swill category, which means I don't really like it. Drink it if you must but I wouldn't recommend."
"ehh"
"Drink: Very good and easy. Overall good job MGD, much better than the way it tasted."
"Tailored for mass consumption and value... flavor is less than enjoyable, save this one for the starving college kids who use it purely for buzzing (Go Badgers!)."
"D- Full marks here, as I have had this on tap at my favorite pub and I do like it better on draft, however either way I could drink this all evening or any time really. It's a good summer beer and schooners are usually on special at the pub, which is always a good thing. I recommend this brew for anyone entering the world of beer!"
"Free swill at a golf outing today so I thought I can finally rate this. Had it in all forms many times throughout my life. For swill, Miller is decent and MGD is alright in my book. Light aroma nothing to note, medium golden color, mouthfeel is adequate for what you get, and the flavor is a little more bold than Bud. Overall drinkable but nothing to get excited about."
"D. In desperate measures, I can drink this brew. Sad but true. Better than the other BMC offerings."
"I dig it. Far better than Budweiser in my opinion, and a much tastier beer to have at a party than some crappy light beer like Miller, Bud, or Coors Light, but just as drinkable as one of those. It's not a great beer, but it isn't bad, especially considering it's status as a macro. I'll drink a bunch of em'."
"Well, pretty bland American Macro. It only ranks up there as I like to smooth drinkability. I prefer this to a regular Bud personally. Hey give it a try, who knows, you might like it? Price is pretty mild so this is easy on the budget, I'll get this at a restaurant if there isn't much else of a selection."
"kind of blaut and and grainey, no hop character at all. not real good but at 88 degres pluss all day, and watching the yankees play at yankee stadioum 3 of theese went down smooth. drank out of 16 oz plastic bottels, it was real fresh but 8.50 for a beer is a bit insane!!!"
"Color is a typical clear straw yellow with a white head, nothing special. Aroma is crisp but weak, rather typical of an American macro lager. Flavor is malty and crisp but has no complexity or depth. Finish is no different from any other major brew I have tried."
"Drinkability: These beers may typically get higher drinkability scores, but with that taste and high carbonation, couldn't do it."
"D: Pretty easy to drink but out of the can it really tastes a lot less crisp and the flaws really begin to show, but just another boring macro easy drunk drinker."
"D: Full to empty in no time. This is one of the easiest beers to drink I have come across."
"This was the first beer I regularly drank in college many years ago. I snuck this one home from softball to review. It's not terrible for a macro but I wouldn't have too many of them in a row."
"Not terrible, but not good either. Better than Bud, but it's not as good as similar offerings like PBR, Stroh's, Schlitz, or even Miller's own High Life."
"There was a mild beer taste and more body than the other Miller products, but it is not an American brewery that I'll re-visit in a hurry."
"D - Usually I can at least give a bad beer a little boost with the drinkability because most of them are easy to down, but not MGD. It is in fact so bizarrely tasteless that I feel like I'm drinking water that someone ashed a cigarette in."
"I like this beer because it reminds me of my roots in beer. It reminds me of the stuff my dad used to drink, the stuff I drank in college. It's a good return to my roots, but I don't want to live there again..."
"I just don't find this interesting enough to drink on a regular basis. It's not offensive to me, but it's not that interesting either, and it works as a refresher."
"Drinkability - Absolutely none."
"Can poured into a pint glass. Sickly pale yellow with a watery white head that dissipates like cola fizz. Doesn't really smell like anything, maybe a little sour corn. Tastes like corn flavored Perrier with a barley finish. Watery and unpleasant. Lots of carbonation, paper-thin body. Drinkable when ice cold."
"D- my little experiment definitely worked wonders for a beer so often hated. with this, and perhaps most american macros, STYROFOAM is the way to go! head lasts to the very end and mouthfeel is enhanced considerably. taste and aroma, well they pretty much stay the same."
"I wouldn't have bought this beer to either drink or review, but it was available so why not do a review? I used to drink this beer in quantity some 25-30 years ago before I knew anything about beer. It was available then, along with a dozen other macros. I haven't had this in years. It isn't unpleasant when it is ice cold, in fact it is very mild and inoffensive. The surprise is in the appearance. Yes it is a straw pale yellow, or barely yellow, more like very watery pale gold, but it has a white head that retains better than I expected. It has a heap of carbonation. The smell is malty, cooked vegetables, adjunct, a bit of an iron chemical smell, but not bad really. The taste is so light, so refreshing, so inoffensive, and really making so little of a statement, that this beer is just a fine thirst quencher on a really hot day. The taste is a bit sourish as the beer warms, there is definitely cooked veggies, some straw flavors, hops are there in the background ... barely. You can't go wrong with this beer when it is cold. That's the key. Once this beer settles, I'm already getting some ugly tastes coming through. Enjoy it as a trip down memory lane, if it serves that purpose."
"D- Drinks average. Just average"
"but what makes this beer so popular?"
"Is there a difference between High Life and this. Maybe I'm prehudice. I can't reaaly tell much of a difference between most of these brews. This one has that basic yellow color and tan head. There is not much of an aroma. Grass maybe? There is not mush flavor either. Just stale malts and hops. Light body with lots of carbonation. Not very drinkable in my book. I'll have a water."
"Had a taste of Moretti with this. It was soooo much better."
"Overall; not even up to the standard of bog-standard Euro lager. Poor."
"Got half way through 300ml bottle, poured it down the sink and open a newcastle brown...not particularly drinkable."
"The taste is also similar to High Life, but here the differences are a little more marked. It has a strong corn-grain quality and seams at first cleanr and more crisp but also more bland and lacking the lasting perfumy-grain quality of High Life. It also seems thinner, a ltitle more watery, with less of a winey character and it lacks the apple that I notice in High Life. It soon develops a noticeable mineral-water quality and becomes more bland with only weak grain aftertaste. It's close to High Life but not quite as good, yet it's a lot better than Coors and a number of others."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled 1/14/2008. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours straw gold with about an inch white head. Head retention and lacing is OK. Aroma is grain and sweet malt, that's it. It doesn't smell bad, but it doesn't smell good either. Taste is corn/grain. Tastes worse the warmer it gets. It's not horrible, but not good. No offensive aromas/flavors. Mouthfeel is light, with average carbonation. It's thin, but not quite watery. Drinkability is OK, it's not hard to drink at all. I wonder how this would taste if it wouldn't have been ""cold filtered"" 4 times like it says on the bottle. I'd drink it again if I didn't have any better choices, but it's certainly a beer I wouldn't make a point to seek out."
"Not as bad as I remember. Maybe drinking from the can makes it better, or at least hides its flaws."
"Taste is bland, not unpleasant but essentially there is nothing there. Very thin, watery with no positive characteristics other than it is perhaps thirst quenching beer."
"It's actually a pretty smooth beer, however. I have no problem drinking it, but given the other choices for session beers, why bother?"
"D: Generally easy to drink and refreshing."
"poored pale yellow in color almost no head and no lacing at all. This is a bad beer no smell taste was awful with a funny aftertaste mouthfeel was thin with high carbonation. Whats up with the clear bottle brewers should know better. I dont think this beer used fresh hops tasted like hop extract."
"This is one of the beers I started drinking on. Thankfully I cam to my senses. It's not an ugly beer, but its color (which is average at best) is about all it has going for it. If you're interested in headaches, this may be the beer for you. MGD has a horrible aftertaste that almost rivals the initial taste."
"I wish I could get my quarter back."
"I'm drinking the rest straight out of the bottle just like my ""blue collar buddies"" would want me to. It is what it is and not nearly as bad as all the negative reviews would indicate."
"Drinkability - poor. Somewhat better than Miller High Life or Light, but not much better."
"I always have a hard time rating these ones, because the style as a whole just sucks, so it's hard to say if I should give a beer high ratings cause it fits in with the style, or low ratings cause it sucks. In any case, this one's straw colored, as you'd expect. Lots of bubbles but no real head. Nose is basically non-existant, but light apples and maybe corn. Flavor is likewise, that sort of biting swetness that comes with macros. Very very bland. Mouth feel is too fizzy, and way too thin. It sucks."
"Minimal aroma, mostly some adjuncts and the can, to be honest. Taste is minimal, with some slight hoppy or barley/rice presence. Goes down real smooth and watery, almost slippery but enough of these will kill your tastebuds so it doesn't matter. If you're having a party and need some cheap beer that doesn't make you look cheap (i.e. anything with the words Natural, Milwaulkee or Malt Liquor) then you could pick this up."
"It does have a darker color than the High Life but in MHO it doesn't taste as good. I try to stay away from these but if push came to shove and these were the only beers I had to drink...then yea I'll drink them. Again these have to be ICE COLD to even consider drinking."
" ~ This is my father-in-laws favorite. Therefore, I need to go easy on it here."
"Great quote from Jason's review, ""There are other macros that will do a better job of being totally bland to quench your thoughtless thirst."""
"Not my favorite macro, but certainly a touch above some I've had. I liked how drying it was, but the overlying sticky-sweet flavor is a bit much for my personal taste."
"D: A pretty pathetic macro lager, if you wan't a Miller product, go for the High Life."
"probably the smoothest beer I have ever had. A bit dry, but smooth none the less. As far as the average person goes, I will drink this if I am offered. When it comes to american macro lagers, I like smoothness becuase I know I'll get nothing else out of it. Smooth, but a bit dry. Miller is better but this does for a BBQ when its this or busch."
"bière blonde blé, comme toute les autres. nez de maïs, de malt, nez industrielle, bouche légère, pas vraiment d'arrière goût pas de goût non plus. produit de consommation masse pour ceux et celles qui n'aime pas la bière."
"Forget it."
"D: A little tasty, goes down very easy, not filling at all, mild kick, this beer has pretty much become my default choice in situations where I’m forced to choose among macros and other beer that I don’t like. It also helps that it’s usually inexpensive."
"Drinkability: Easy and uninteresting to drink. If you want to drink a lot and fast for the purpose of getting loaded, you could do worse."
"D - ok if you don't care about flavor or enjoying a beer for the hard work put into it"
"So many, many better choices out there for my money. And, did you notice? This really isn't cheap beer."
"An enjoyable beer overall."
"And to think that this was once a beer I drank on occasion many moons ago. Not impressed with it now after having been away from it for over a decade. Perhaps it was the can, but I doubt it. Pours medium golden color, little head. Little grabs the nose and, unfortunately, the taste buds either. It's rather dry, slightly bitter, and has an odd, exceedingly grainy taste, producing an aftertaste that was simply annoying. Not a beer I'll go back to anytime soon."
"I actually think that this is one of the better macros out there. The color isn't half bad and the head on it isn't that bad either. It doesn't really smell that great, like the typical American macro. A bit skunky actually. Maybe the dang clear bottle. Taste is nothing memorable but it is better than 99% of the other macro offerings. Unfortunately, that's not saying a lot. I would probably drink this beer again if I was at a party somewhere and it was the only thing available, but I don't think I will go out looking for this one."
"Drinkability: I run into this beer a lot at backyard gatherings. I have never been a fan, so I wanted to evaluate it under different circumstances. This is not the worst beer, but even when I evaluated it in the best circumstances possible, it was hard to find much to like. I will not seek this beer out, but I will not turn one down either."
"Bottle: Poured a golden yellow color lager with a small bubbly white head with limited retention. Aroma of sweet adjunct is dominating. Taste is also dominated by sweet corn with a watery aftertaste. No hops could be detected and body is quite thin. Nothing bad but just really plain and boring."
"All of these American macro-lager beers taste pretty much the same to me. Very little malt flavor, very corn flavored and almost no hops."
"A thin beer in the mouth that isn't heavy on the tastebuds either, but it's very simple, drinkable beer."
"The weak profile and low alcohol content make this reasonably drinkable for a cheap night out at a bar. Not worth the effort really... get PBR instead."
"Taste is about the same as the smell which is not really that bad,goes down rather thin and watery with a slight musty aftertaste,but nonetheless,quite enjoyable for a macro,very easy drinking,not bad at all."
"Poured it into my glass golden in color with a thin white head that quickly goes away. Doesn't smell all that good. It has a below average taste thats to expect from a macro. It has a good amount of carbonation in it. Well I really don't have a whole lot of good things to say about this beer. I probably would only drink this again if I was really hot and needed a beer."
"This is good for a day by the pool. Aside from that, I can't imagine sipping on this."
"Miller Lite is the way to go if you want to have more than one"
"pours a cheap white head - giving way to its true lack of malt body. Which happens to look nice, the white tendrils of lace clinging to the sides of the glass, framing the pale straw body of the beer. I can easily read the page of a book under the lens of MGD, its that clear. Smell is acrid and a little like slightly moldy malt on a tuesday. Mouthfeel is quite pleasant, like a cold glass of perrier...on that note, i'd still fancy the perrier to the MGD on any given night."
"Decent looking lager with a slighly darker straw hue and a nice, dare I say, almost rich looking head that took it's time fading away. Nice little gobs of lacing stuck to the sides of the glass that I hope is a result of a ton of corn syrup.Note a sweet, slightly grainy smell along with a hint of green apple fruitiness. Smooth uptake with an almost sharp Granny smith Aplle taste that is only there for an instant. Some bold, cereal-like malt and a barely there hint of hop round out the flavour. Maybe a tad watery at first and quite light in body, but overall a very drinkable macro."
"I had heard bad things about this beer before reviewing, but I have tried to be as objective as I can. Not the worst beer I've ever tried, this is not really offensive, moreso bland with a little unappealing taste. I'm sure this would be just as good from the bottle, but at $4 each, this is a total rip-off in Australia, and I will probably never drink it again."
"First thing's first,i basically grew up with this beer and it followed me all through high school.Thanks to my grandpa and dad for that.When i'm not in the mood for a higher priced great craft brew i find myself buying this beer often...can only.It is your typical big brew beer...rice,little malt smell,etc. This beer for me is great on a warm day out at the lake cooking out and relaxing and thats about it. I'm sure my childern will pick up on this beer too,after sneaking some from the fridge,and feel the same way i do abuot it."
"D- Refreshing. easy to drink but od limited interest because of blah aroma and flavour."
"A very average lawnmower beer. Passes the ""would you drink it if it's cold and free?"" test."
"D - Drinkable if no other options are available."
"First of all, I must admit, MGD is one of my favorite macro lagers. I try not do drink them, but if I do, I like to drink MGD. Now, that being said...Pours a darker yellow color with a quickly dissipating head (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Smells like a typical macro, mostly of corn, grains, and alcohol. The taste is fairly light, especially to those who appreciate much better beer. Though, for the style, definitely one of the better, more pronounced beers. Light in the mouth, and easy to drink, although lacking in taste (all typical of the style). I guess it's kind of like that saying about winning the special Olympics... in the end you're still a retard. In conclusion, if I drink macro lager, I try to drink MGD, because it has one of the better/stronger tastes.."
""
"D - It is better than some light beers I'm sure, but barely. It can be refreshing if you quaff it after chopping trees or digging holes, maybe. I will not return to this unless there is no other option."
"Overall an excellent warm weather beer. It does help to check the best by date."
"Pours a clear straw color with a small soapy head that dissipated quickly, leaving no cap. Left some nice lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is of corn, grain. The taste has an artificial sweetness flavor and corn, some metallic aftertaste. The feel is watery, not overly carbonated and a bit astringent. Its a fine cooler beer but nothing that I would look for."
"Not the best beer made by Miller, but a great cold filtered brew."
"The aroma is pleasant with some slight malty tones. The colour is a light golden colour similar to straw. The taste is slightly malty with some grassy undertones. It is very crisp on the tongue with some mild carbonation. A nice refreshing beer for an American macrobrew."
"When I was visiting my girlfriend's family in Winnipeg I got stuck twice with only MGD on offer. I realized that this beer is drinkable only when ice cold cause it warms up the nasty corn flavours creep out and the finish goes sweet. The clear bottle and piss colour only add to the bad appearance. Makes me realize how much I like Carib or PBR as versions of this style"
"Overall: Nothing there. I certainly will not have another one."
"Eric"
"This theme then continued through to the taste, bland with a very wattery mouthfeel. This was an advantage as it could be finished quite quickly. So that made it slightly drinkable, but why would I want to put myself through that again."
"Drank quite well after convincing myself this was the better option. Goes down fast and was good for the party, I didn't have to think about it."
"As a side note. This beer does pair well with microwavable Ore Ida Bagel Bites."
"My first introduction to something beyond the standard American pilsners, MGD offers a liitle more in flavor. Pours standard pale pilsner yellow with a light head that lingers for a short while. Smells of hops with a bit of something more complex. Tastes well-blanced with an even tug-of-war between the malt and hops. The finish wins the match with a sweet, malty overtone that makes this an above average macro-lager. Light-to-medium mouthfeel that is highly drinkable. A perfect light summer beer. Goes good with almost any food."
"Drinkability? I can't lie, I must say this is drinkable."
"Ive had more MGD than any other beer. Pale color with plenty of carbonation, thin white head, clean smell and taste no real after taste. Nothing stands out as good or bad. The price is right and Im sure it will me in my fridge most days. Its most welcome on a hot day."
"Overall: Whats the point? Avoid."
"Tasted along with Miller High Life for comparison (from forum post earlier about similarities between the two). The beer was poured from a 24oz big can into an Okocim glass (0.5L, very nice glass). Head started out strong, then fizzled out leaving some chunky lace on the glass and a wannabe ring after a few sips. Beer is pale gold similar to High Life, but none of the bubbles are there. I would choose High Life over this just for the amazing bubbles. Smell is almost the same as the High Life, but taste is fuller and carries on with the smell, not so great. This is less sweet, with a little more of a grainy aftertaste that the High Life did not have. Although these beers are practically the same (minus the pasteurization difference), I think High Life takes the cake on appearance and drinkability. Plus it was $0.20 cheaper!"
"ah, my favorite beer in the teen years. fizzy, rapidly dimishing large bubbles pass for a head. for some reason i used to enjoy the sweet corn adjunct flavor in this beer. at least it was something a little better than bud. no discernable hop aroma, light bodied, decent balance to this beer for what it is. blond and overly carbonated as you all know. i don't think i'll ever have one again unless i have a midlife crisis or something."
"This does have a malted taste to it. Maybe with some nutty overtones. Unfortunately its light body and heavy carbonation makes it hard to really taste what it may have to offer. Near average drinkability because you can have another and its not something that I will never drink again."
"I'm proving that I am above beer slander and I'll give this beer a 3 for drinkability since I do believe it tastes better than the rest (Buds, Coors, malted liquors, etc.) It does resemble a pilsner and I've had supposedly ""good"" pilsners that reminded me of this beer, so come game day, you know what I'm buying for my friends."
"I not a big fan of Macro lagers and not a big fan of MGD i just buy one so i can review ...it does'nt smell good at all...not a good taste...and not even a good appearence .... for me this is a bad beer not good at all if you want to buy a Macro lager this one is not the one"
"overall, for a macro this is pretty good, far better than bud, however i think i'll pass next time, and besides $6.50 for 16 oz of this..."
"D - Very drinkable on a cold day, bot so much during the hot summer days."
"Pale yellow fizz with an inch head that went away after a little while. Smell was slightly skunk and corn like. Flavor was of corn and slightly sweet. There was a horrid skunk aftertaste that lingered longer than I care to remember. i did detect a slight amount of bitterness, from hops? I couldnt tell if it was skunk or hops."
"Not very good."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, light golden color with a thin, soapy white head with lots of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Smell is mostly of grainy malt and possibly a miniscule amount of hops. Taste has a slight grainy taste as well, followed by a decent bitterness that finishes very neutral and clean. Not bad for a macro-lager. The mouthfeel is light and has a foamy consistency. This is a pretty drinkable beer and I think I would prefer this to most macro lagers. The taste is not impressive at all, but it isn't offensive either."
"Final Statement: I'm glad I tried it because I can now say with confidence, this is the worst beer I have ever had."
"Taste good enough for me."
"In the past, my mom would cook bratwursts in this beer, and they would turn out to be some tasty sausages. I think if I ever purchase this again, I'll use this to cook with before I use it as a refreshment."
"I just popped open a cold bottle of mgd and must say it is the average american beer for the average american Joe. No special characteristics or no really negative thoughts about this brew. It seems just like the perfect beer when the average american just wants to sit back and kick up their heels."
"D: This is the first macro I've taken the time to stop and review. It was really painfull and I'm not that much of a beer snob. Then again I've never really liked MGD. This is a bad beer through and through."
"For the style, this beer tastes pretty badass. It is refreshingly dry, balanced, and delivers just a splash of fruity hop flavor in the finish. A light but very creamy mouthfeel accentuates these qualities to make this by far my favorite offering from the big 3. It is a very fresh tasting beer with minor, if any, perceptable flaws."
"This, back in college, was my preferred beer, before I had good beer. It pours a golden-yellow with heavy carbonation and no head retention. The smell is grainy and lightly skunky. The taste is somewhat clea but rather blah, lacking much of anything worth noting. It's has a too sweet taste and luckily lacks much of an aftertaste. It's only a choice I'd take if I had no other options, and maybe not even then."
"For some reason I find this beer drinkable at the right times...but the ""High Life"" still has my vote!"
"I had a bottle of this at a party I was just at, I guess it is one of the macros of choice. The smell had a rather malty smell for an American Macro Lager. The taste was absent. I mean completetly gone, nothing...nothing at all. The color was a light yellow. There isn't much to say about this, but all in all it wasn't the worst beer I have had."
"D - Pretty good for quenching your thirst on a hot day. I've always liked this one much better than other BMC products, but upon reviewing this beer....it's not that much different. All of these BMC lagers really fall into a very narrow spectrum of flavors...and it's not that easy to tell one from the other."
"All I can say about this is it is light enough and cheap enough that you can (and I have in younger days) drink a load of these at once. Beyond that, the aroma is almost skunky, the taste is typical BMC grain flavor, and the palate dry and non-impressive. Its amazing how things change, as I used to really enjoy this beer before I started drinking and rating real beers."
"All and all a better beer as measured by taste and drinkability than the King of Beers."
"Dinner at the parents and the best thing in the house is MGD. Looks stellar clear golden ok head but not good retention. Not a lot here to smell just your standard lager fare. The taste is rather ok the beer isn't too cold and I rather enjoy it warmer. There is a presence of hops in the finish and this isn't the worst thing ever. It has a decent body and finishing 2 of these with dinner is alright."
"drinkability isn't bad at all, it is pretty smooth, and as far as macro-lagers go ...it's very drinkable IMO."
"I enjoyed this one except for the absolutely horrible aftertaste."
"As always, I will leave the disclaimer that this beer serves a definite purpose as a mass market beer and it performs well within its intended territory. It's inexpensive and non offensive and someone could definitely slurp down many of these beers without trouble. It's not really comparable to the premium craft beers featured here on BA."
"I've heard this is the same beer as high life, except that it is cold filtered not heat pasteurized. I have also heard that kegs of high life and MGD are the exact same. Well they sure taste similar, but I still give the edge over taste to mgd, but for the price might as well go with high life."
"Drinkability: If your not looking for anything to interupt your evening, this may be the beer for you. It is completely drinakble, just doesn't have the level of flavor that I am looking for."
"As far as commercial brews go, my favorite mass produced lager."
"While the beer lacked many of the synergistic qualities that have worked for me in the recent tastings of Dubbels and Tripels, it stil was okay with a slight taste of malt and corn followed by a bite. I could hang out and drink this in good company while watching a football game or a baseball playoff and not worry about it spilling..."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"MGD is probably my favorite readily-available macro. Unlike the rest, I can actually drink it at a reasonable temperature without having too much unpleasantness jump out in the taste. This is what I keep on hand for my light beer-drinking friends."
"There is more than enough water and since it lacks any substantial flavors, I was able to finish it. But, the bottom line is that there really is no point to bother with this one..."
"On present reckonings of the BMC I am a Bud man"
"As is my custom, I'm wrapping up the reviews before actually assigning the scores, but it's pretty obvious that Miller Genuine Draft is the clear loser of Macro Smackdown XI. In comparison to the winner, it's a crude effort that is becoming much more nasty as it warms. As far as I'm concerned, Miller High Life is still the only drinkable beer from this brewery."
"MGD is nothing special, but it does offer a smooth taste without any bite. I would never consciously buy this beer for my own enjoyment but I would consider it if I was entertaining and needed a product that most would find acceptable. Its an ok beer that has no qualities good enough to brag about but that also offers an easy- drinking style."
"Easy to drink on a hot day, and if your low on cash."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is a clear light yellow. There is a lot of foam. The smell is corny and the taste is about the same. This beer has a mouthfeel that is a lot smoother the colder the beer. I can drink mass produced beer on occasion, but not every day. Reveiwed straight from the clear bottle. No need washing a pint glass after this."
"Overall: I only drank this beer because my brother left some in my refrigerator, and I needed to make room for the good stuff. It is, however, my favorite American Macro Lager."
"Pours very clear, head lingers on edges of glass only. Aroma disappoints, spicy with a cooked corn smell that borders on rotten. Malt low to none, no hop aroma. Improves on flavour, nice corny flavour overrides the unappealing aroma. A smooth and creamy mouthfeel is balanced by a nice carbonic bite."
"My choice; I'll take the High Life if given a choice."
"¡Salud!"
"Underratred. Clean and crisp with fine malty taste. Not a strong, extreme beer, but it isn't supposed to be, the mouthfeel is extraordinary, I would put this up against SNPA on a hot summer day anytime. For the price and availability, this squashes many of the artsy micros. Open your mind, this is a fine beer."
"Miller Genuine Draft pours a typical macro yellow, with a white head from a clear twelve ounce bottle. Smells like corn. Very light flavor, corn, maybe the slightest amount of hops. Some canned vegetable flavor. Decent for lawnmower beer I guess, or break out the beer bong. Not recommended."
"Notes: A very plain offering. I would rather have High Life over this anyday for a better price. Still, not bad if you don't want to break your budget."
"I was forced to sample this after finding out a friend had received a free case and was just trying to get rid of it. It had been many years since I'd sampled this stuff and after one sip I remembered why. Its lack of any true taste while drinking is formidably trumped by its harsh, bitter aftertaste that reminds me of formaldehyde. This stuff is putrid. Miller high life is a much better macro alternative and sells for less. An interesting side note is that while in Ireland for 11 days last summer, I noticed that Miller was trying to infiltrate the american import market there(which Bud has a stranglehold on, its on draft in every pub) and the only product of theirs I saw was MGD. Oddly, if you saw anyone drinking a Budweiser over there they were undoubtedly Irish. I guess Bud is import to them technically, and the whole grass is greener on the other side thing holds true. I'd say we win in that exchange, I'll trade Bud for Guinness anyday."
"MGD, while not craft beer, is an improvement over its competitors."
"MGD isn't too bubbly and has the mouthfeel of many beers that cost much more. The taste of MGD is very smooth and the flavor has just the right balance of hops and it goes down very smoothly. Add that to the fact that while this isn't the cheapest mass prodcued beer out there, it is far more reasonably priced than other beers that taste no better, but cost far more. I give MGD a thumbs up, definately worth a try."
"Overall, if I had one beer to drink in a desert, MGD would be it. Not a very complex beer, but simple and refreshing."
"It's drinkable, when freezing cold. That is the only good news. Miller regular, high life is a cheaper and better option, if you have to go macro. Very, very, yellowy and skunky. Skunky in smell, especially and the beer, even after sipping for awhile, never grows on you. I cannot recommend this one, as many other macros are much better."
"D- goes down easy"
"So I'll probably come back and rereview this beer because I had it last night after I was already pretty wasted. I was also hungry and we went out to a bar and got some hot wings. I decided to try this and based on the situation, this beer really hit the spot. I was extremely pleased at first. However, once I got some food in me, the beer kind of lost it's luster (whether it had any in the first place is up for debate). It actually got pretty gross towards the end, and I couldn't even finish the last swirl. I can believe someone if they say they like it...but give me a high life over this any day."
"Edit: By the way, I don't feel bad reviewing this beer served in a plastic cup. At most parties where they serve this, especially from a keg, it is usually served in a plastic cup. So to me, this is the appropriate vessel from which to review the beer."
"Drinkability - The flavor combination is just not right. This beer is probably ideal for college parties, although there are better cheap alternatives. This is certainly drinkable, but you won't be delighted afterwards."
"Basic. Golden in appearance with decent head retention and lacing. The nose is grainy without hops; and as much alcohol as could normally be detected. Basically a ""generic"" beer aroma. It's crisp in the mouth with a median carbonation and moderate body. The grainy maltiness of the nose is present in the flavor along with a corn-like flavor. It's not sweet, but it's just barely balanced, leaving it lacking. Still, it's clean and dry. Basic."
"A beer that is better the colder it is and served directly out of the bottle. It becomes a struggle to put down, but remains drinkable."
"Pours a light yellow with hints of amber. The head starts off huge, but subsizes very quickly, though it does leave a small layer of frothy head in the end. The smell is a faint, but slightly offensive skunky caramel. Also smells a bit like plastic. The taste is malty enough, but the hops are very light. The moutfeel is thin and the carbonation doesn't make enough of a presence. However, this is a decently drinkable beer. For a cheap beer, this is decent."
"My rating numbers probably look high, but I am trying to rate against others of this style and think that MGD is one of the best in it's class."
"I can drink a few of these, but the dry after taste may gets to me"
"Drink this beer cold. It's a pale gold beer. The smell isn't very strong which i have come to expect from many beers in this class.The taste is slightly sweet. This beer really isn't one of those beers that you drink when you just want to have a beer. This is more aimed towards a party scene or football games and so forth."
"Drinkability: Serve this one blisteringly cold. If you let it warm up for a second it is undrinkable. MGD for when you just want to swill some beer."
"Those who want a strong flavor out of their macro, and are flexible as to its sophistication, might give this one a try. Since I dont smoke every day, this isnt likely to be my everyday beer; I might keep a few on hand, however, for those mild nights when a smoke is just the thing, and MGD is most likely to put over its intriguing Jeckyll and Hyde act."
"Overall, for the style, this is a really good beer."
"I have no plans to ever drink this beer again, but I guess its not necessarily a bad beer, it's just quite obviously not a good beer. Not much else to say..."
"I'm honestly not crazy about American macro lagers, but I won't discount them as being decent if you just want a beer to drink. I'll drink MGD to change it up sometimes when I'm not drinking Yuengling at the bar. I had this in a bottle and the color was straw/golden. The smell isn't very impressive and was pretty weak. The taste is pretty weak like you'd expect, but is still better than light beers. What really strikes me about MGD is that (atleast in a bottle) it's very carbonated. The mouthfeel was average, and like I said, bubbly. This carbonation seems to subside pretty quickly and the taste becomes somewhat bland when it gets warmer, so I would advise drinking it cold. I guess MGD is alright, but I wouldn't spend an entire evening drinking it as I feel it can get old rather quickly."
"Much to my dismay when I ventured to my beer fridge to grab a coldy it was fully stocked, unfortunately none of the beers I would consider sessionable. Not in the mood to drive I walked to the corner store and picked up some MGD. I certainlly won't turn my nose up to macro's, good Sunday sports type of brew to me. Yeah the adjuncts get annoying but the thirst quenching, flavorless brew actually works in my book. MGD is a shade darker than its competition. Carbonation will grab your attention as its almost champagne like on the initial pour. Decent head fades rapidly w/ trace lacing. Kinda sweet, and as it warms it gets a sugary syrup texture, by all means drink it ice cold."
"My friend drinks this because it doesn't have a ""hostile taste"" I've gotten him to drink good beer now but he still likes this. I've tried to like it and I don't. I hate it."
"Pours a very light yellow with a small, thin, fizzy head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Smell is grainy, with the adjuncts palpable in the slight aroma. Taste is, well.... lacking, and what is present is dominated by a slightly rotten corn taste. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, but ultimately under-carbonated, and the drinkability is slightly less than average for the style. All in all, it's sub-par for even the macro lager scene, and there are others which are better choices if one is seeking a fairly flavourless and non-threatening drink."
"So this isn't something that I would normally buy. I ended up with a 12 pack when my mom said that it would just sit at her house, and what did it do at mine, it just sat. Well the it pours a clear yellow color, with a small white head that lingers around the side of the glass. There really isn't much to the smell, I guess just beer smell nothing notable. Carbonation is slightly high, and there is not much taste grassy/corny kinda. This beer is kinda watery, and slight after taste but goes away fairly quickly. If you need a cheap beer this could be it? It washes down spicy food alright."
"DIts ok, not disgusting or anything to slam about it, but not one I would drink by choice. When I have had this in the past, it is because it is the beer of choice for my father in law and its what he stocks in his fridge (I have learned to bring my own instead) I will leave the other two cans for him"
"Mouthfeel's not too bad. Creamy and mouthfilling. It's only redeemable quality. Drinkability isn't great unless you're in the mood for corn on the cob."
"Notes: Shared with my old man at the kitchen table. He buys whatever is cheapest and I take the opportunity to review bad beer. I look at it this way. I wish the old man would buy better beer, but I get to review beer I normally wouldn't buy anyways."
"Pours a darker yellow, some carbonation, very small head, some lacing afterwards. Scent is malty and sweet. I like the taste for a macro, finishes kinda clean too. Medium body. Drinkable. This is my best American macro of the Big 3 I guess. When you can get a 12-pack for $5.99 it's not too bad, lol"
"It was yellow, not much head. smelled like corn. tasted like corn, rather unimpressive, pretty corny. Carbonation was not overly abundant but it was very watery. Makes it really easy to drink. This is not something I'd go out of my way to drink again, but I would recommend it to pretty much anyone who wants to get drunk off their ass with little or no effort."
"Pours out amber with a lame sickly fizzed out headskie. Tastes like an American Macro Lager, suprise suprise. Cheap, sweet, and watery tasting, but still better than Bud. Kinda on the fizzy side. I got through the glass though. Nothing special at all, but I wasn't really expecting this revisit to wow me. I'll stick to the craft beer thank you."
"This is a little below average. I think MGD is the best of the ""Big 3", but of course that is not saying much. It's got a little more body, color, and flavor than Bud or Coors, its not quite as bitter as Coors Origional, and no where near as nasty as Bud. Depending on when I drink it, I get different things out of it. I swear the first time I drank this out of a glass bottle the hops tasted like Jose Cuervo. Oh well, anyway the usual experience is a little sweetness up front but kind of watered down. Then come the hops which could be worse but are kind of bitter and tend towards that wierd chemical flavor that comes from Miller using cheap ingredients. Its kind of fizzy and the though sometimes the head will stick around a while, its always strangely light. Drinkability is average. This isn't a heavy beer, and its never disgusting. But once again, the aftertaste sure does get old after a while. How good is MGD? Good enough that I gladly drink it when its free. How bad is MGD? Well lets see I've bought MGD with my own money... well, never."
"MGD is terrible. It is not the worst thing in the world, and the Brits love it, but it is not good. It has no finish and can taste like a horses ass if you haven't downed 15. It is cheap, so I guess it has some admirable qualities, but the head disappears, it has a really weird aftertaste and no real flavors or complex anything going on."
"Pale straw coloured lager, poured from a 330ml clear bottle. Weak-looking fizzy head fades quickly, mildly carbonated. Smell is of sour corn malts, not much in the way of hoppiness in the nose. Smells like beer all right... Hits the tongue with an initial hoppiness, but as it slides down the throat sours quickly. I imagine I smell ""beery"" after about one sip of this. I feel beery, that's forsure. A bit of a soft mouthfeel, not enough bite for me. Weak American beer, but even so, in a pinch (which I always am with most of my family or friends) this'll have to do."
"Overall: Flavor is definitely the high point for this beer,"
"¡Salud!"
"Pretty much a standard American fizzy yellow flavorless lager. The smell is really bad, but the flavor is OK for what it's supposed to be. I certainly wouldn't buy this, but at a wedding reception, it was fun to review."
"just another faceless macro that doesn't distinguish itself in any way from the masses."
"I thought this beer was going to taste and smell like nothing, boy was I wrong. Poured a clear yellow color with a white head of foam that dissipated quickly. At first the only aroma was alcohol, but when I swirled it around, I got some kind of a fruit smell in the background. The taste was average, but it had just a little bit more flavor than most average macros. This was another beer that the mouthfeel was a bit too watery and thin for me. If you can this as cheap as me, then it's worth it."
"NOw, this is what I was talking about, perhaps the worst beer I have ever tried. The tatse is like drinking a tire. And the mouthfeel is the worst, because you can feel it even after 5 years. Believe me, you do not want to mess with this beer, if you dirnk it, it will get even with your worst beer dreams."
"Overall- Definitely not worth buying if you want a decent tasting Lager. This is a great beer drinking game beer. I would drink it if that was all there was at the party but I wouldn't be having a good time!"
"Some years ago I made a one off business trip to Milwaukee and on a free afternoon me and my colleague went to visit the Miller brewery. I was a bit disappointed to learn that despite the German roots of the founders the Reinheitsgebot (Purity Law of 1516 stating that beer be made only from malt, hops and water) is not adhered to. Such is rarely a sign of quality and in the case of the big American brewers (AB, Miller, Coors) the reasons seem to be rather economic. No surprise then the brew is totally bland, watery and insignificant. As it is commercially highly successful it may seem that some drinkers are scared of taste ..."
"The only reason I took notes on this was because I couldn't remember having reviewed it before. Same ol' piss yellow pour, with a thin canned beer head. Okay, there's something of a malt character here before it gets overwhelmed by corn. Not so much saccharine or cloying but like drinking from a cup smeared with lipstick. Empty barley pop."
"Drinkability: I have a slight preference for this beer over the many others in the style. That's not saying much."
"Theres a lot to dislike about this beer, but in comparison to other macro beers, it's more enjoyable. For a truly tasty beer, however, you don't need me to tell you to look elsewhere."
"The gold of the american beers, in its bottle of 12 oz, the perfect serving for bbq, buddies meeting, 6 o´clock, etc, its appearance is exceptional, pure nugget, smell so good remain my first draft beer, in mexico, malt and hops really balanced, and the best thing of all its packaging, sorry for my comments on the bottle´s package and presentation, i am a Professional graphic designer."
"It's an option when I hang with my non beer geek friends in places like Dayton, Ohio and go to bars that have five beers available and this is inevitably one. By no means good, but a drinkable macro if you have buddies who like bars with mechanical bulls."
"There is nothing really special about MGD. However, it is not terrible. It is good to order at a restaraunt with food. If you want to enjoy a good beer, this is not a good choice. Have it maybe with a pizza as it won't fill you up, but it will wet your whistle and compliment your food."
"Probably one of the better college aimed session brews out there."
"Drinkability: Owing to its generally inoffensive smell and taste properties, MGD isn't a bad session beer. I can think of things that would be more pleasant to drink, beers I might be less ashamed of, but if there's nothing else, I'd take MGD over staying sober."
"D = Expensive and crap."
"Obtained from the discount bin of a local liquor store. Freshness markings on the bottom of the can are 12064 B41078. Oh boy, before I knew anything about beer...years ago...this was my favorite. Can pours a two finger fluffy white 'amusement park' head over a crystal clear light tan liquid. Amusement park meaning plastic-fake-looking, like purposefully deteriorating styrofoam bubbles. Smells saaz hoppy with some dried hay and faint malt. There is an edge of cardboard. Tastes mild. Gentle saaz hoppy that almost comes across as well-chew on peppermint gum. Malt sweet is below this and is corn and mildly honey covered cardboard. Pretty disappointing considering my high expectations. Oh well. Light body and md to md-heavy carbonation."
"I don't know how this ended up in my fridge, but sadly, I'm out of good beer, but it's still really hot here and I'm really thirsty, so here we go ladies and gents... this really doesn't look inviting. Smell is pretty terrible... soaked cardboard that's been run over by a car. Maybe a few cars... with muddy tires. Yep this is pretty much the worst beer I've had. Granted I'm drinking it right after a Rogue Brutal Bitter, one of my favs, but this stuff sucks. I've been getting by this summer, consuming a lot of Labatt Blue and Genny Cream Ale with my macro drinking friends, but this is almost undoable. There's a gross burpy-puke taste to this beer. You know, when you're real full and you take a sip of beer and then burp... well this beer tastes like that burp. Yuk. I think the trick to this beer is leaving it in the bottle. Or funneling."
"Pours a pale straw with a head that raisies just above one finger. the thin white head remains to the finish, and it has good lacing. You can smell and taste the adjuncts in this one, and not much else. Poor balance. The higher carbonation helps it go down a little smoother, but there is harsh aftertaste and a brutal finish. The ""cold filtered"" technique to make this taste like a draft beer leaves a lot to be desired."
"Clear golden, somewhat pale, but still golden, with a large white foam head, with some stickiness to boot. Smell was mild malt, some corn-like odors, but nothing harsh or skunky. Taste was typical for the style, with a rough feel toward the end. Honestly, it triggered sensations of playing baseball (either from the crap we drank after a game or from my days in the Kingdome, I can't recall.) Mouthfeel was expected to be thin and was, but the carbonation and malt-husk flavors were damaging to any smooth finish this one might have had. Certainly a drinkable beer, but not necessary. My guess is that Miller simply wanted a beer that looked like a decent draft when poured from the bottle or can. In this they succeeded, but they forgot that their demographic doesn't pour...it's pretentious, don't you know."
"I know now that Miller did not just brew one beer and place a MGD label on one bottle and High Life on another. Its true what everyone is saying Miller High Life taste better. MGD pours light gold with good white head. Light and watery mouthfeel (like most macro's). Some bitterness and aftertaste at finish, which is not a bad thing to me. I really was not offended by the taste, just not has much to my liking as other macro I have tried."
"While this isn't a beer that gives you a whole lot in the flavour department, there isn't anything offensive about it either. MGD is actually one of the better macros, and one that I drink regularly when in establishments that don't serve craft beer."
"It makes a great free beer! It looks brightly golden with yellow tones and a sparkling white head. Don't blink--you'll miss it. Smells grainy sweet with vegitable (corn) flavors. Acidic and scrubs the palate a bit. Finishes grainy and vegie like, though clean. All in all, it's an average beer for a mass produced lager."
"Haven't had this in quite a while, but remember it clearly. Wasn't glass worthy but everyone knows this stuff is pale yellow/gold. Taste was the same as most of macros I've had except the finish was dominated by some kind of metal (aluminum?). Thin effervescent mouthfeel. I would say it's a good summer thirst quenching beer but it's brother High Life does that better."
"This is not a macro that I would really recommend, although I know a lot of people who swear by this beer. It's just a little too sharp and raw for my taste. If I'm going macro, I'm going with something smooter and more full-bodied, like a High Life or a Stroh's."
"It is what it is...crap. This macro is almost painful to drink. The aftertaste is really tough to get passed. You're better off throwing this out before you open it."
"Highly carbonated, goes down pretty easy. Much better than the other macros in my opinion, but that still isn't saying much."
"Drinkability: After the smell and the initial taste, I was a bit impressed. Even started thinking could this be a new camping and lawn mowing beer. But no, the finish ruined it. That powdery dryness is just not good coming from a cheap, watery, thirst-quencher. Lost MAJOR points there."
"Sampled as part of my ongoing quest for the best cheap canned beer for the lake. Haven't found it yet. Poured a typical pale golden-straw. Easily generated a meringue-like fluffy head - in fact on fairly vigorous pour caused so much foaming that most of the carbonation went out of that part of the beer. Aroma was a vague suggestion of malt and cooked corn. Clean and astringent, bordering on tart. Finish was a bit muddled, with some nondescript, but not particularly hoppy, bittering and a lingering cooked corn grits taste."
"Poured out to a dark golden color, with a medium bubbly head. Seemed to pour with a bit of viscosity. Aroma of corn and husk are noted, as well as a touch of sweetness. Flavor is overpowering, with corn as the main flavor, with only notes of alcohol and hops being present.Finished with a heavy aftertaste of corn and almost sticky mouthfeel. This is not a great beer, but for what it is, I suppose it's not terrible. Worth a try."
"Not a beer I would recommend, but it holds a place for me in memory. Not very differnt from any other macro asice from memories of $12 a 30 pack and many funny nights."
"Straw yellow bubbly white head. For a macro I must say the head retention is not bad. Smells grainy with some soft malts. Kind of bland. Very smooth with a decent amount of carbonation. Taste like grains, light malts, and faint hops. Has a corn aftertaste and finishes dry. Not bad not good. Just your average US Macro Lager."
"Drinkability/Intangibles - I think the cans have a cool color scheme, so that's a positive. Calling a beer in a can ""genuine draft," however, is strikingly poor form. No good reason to have this beer in one's fridge."
"Drinkability: One can pound out a few of these in a night. However, I am not that one."
"poured a light pale color that was perfectly clear with a nice long-lasting head. Not much to say about the smell except that it is typical of this style of beer. The taste was not offensive and it would be easy to drink a lot of these in one sitting. Little if any aftertaste"
"Still, it goes down fairly smooth, and would score decently on the mouthfeel, if it wasn't for this odd, ever so slight metallic twinge on the aftertaste. It's not big, but enough to cut down on the drinkability a bit. Wherever you are, you can probably do better than this."
"Again, nothing special about this one but definitely bearable."
"Every once in a while I find myself overcome by the urge to try something I know I probably shouldn't. While taking MGD out for a spin again wasn't as dangerous as, say, sky-diving or bungee-jumping, I certainly didn't do my palate any favors. Neither should you."
"Drinkability: Ok, that's a macro, but a very good macro. I don't like its higher price here, but that's one of the best sellers in Winnipeg,Manitoba. I don't know why, because I don't see here (Quebec), except exception (market tests?)"
"A light-moderate mouthfeel on the palate lent it self to feeling a bit heavier than others of the style and tasted much less watered down than Bud. A slight metallic taste was lent from the can but it did not overtly taint the taste. As adjuct lagers go, the one I would probably be apt to buy, though nothing I would want to make a habit of drinking."
"Pretty much every mainstream American lager has a corny taste to it, but it's almost overpowering in MGD. The corny taste combined with the grainy, heavily carbonated mouthfeel makes MGD one of the least drinkable mass-produced lagers on the market. It's still pretty easy to drink, but there are many better choices out there if you're after a cheap, easy-to-drink beer."
"pours a golden color, with a nice lace head. The apperance is slightly better than other adjunct lagers. The nose is you can smell the adjunct and maybe a hint of malt. The mouthfeel is that of club soda. Ok beer, very drinkable. Merry Christmas, this beer could be paired well with spicy foods"
"Had one of these at a family gathering this weekend. I'm going to give this the benefit of the doubt on the appearance score since I consumed it directly from the can. I detected little aroma. and what I did detect was light cooked-corn aroma. Taste, on the first mouthfull, was lightly grainy with more cooked corn, followed by a non-descript sour aftertaste. On subsequent gulps, I really didn't taste much at all... except that sour aftertaste. Just the tiniest bit of hop was detected on the first swallow... then nothing. Watery mouthfeel. Not quite as fizzy as other macros. It does go down pretty easy... but I don't know why you'd want it to! After one of these, I switched to soda for the rest of the evening!"
"Stay Away."
"Overall- just like Foster's I was fooled by an inviting appearance only to be dissapointed by the taste. Yet at least Foster's was bland from it's flavor and not the fact that it has been ""Cold-Filtered"" to absolute death. A sub-standard lager, I never thought I'd say this but I would recommend going with its younger brother Miller Lite because at least it tastes more like beer and not filtered liquid."
"I'd say i'd avoid this. Just has no real flavor outside corn and hops."
"MGD is better than Bud, but not as good as most small-lot beers. It's fairly light, neither too malty nor too hoppy, and you can drink more than one without retching. On the other hand, it's pretty bland and unmemorable. My dad used to drink Miller, so it was the first beer I ever tried. I still have a glass occasionally, usually when dining out, because it's a safe choice. But I don't really seek it out, and I wouldn't recommend that you do so either."
"In the end, I think the best part of this beer is its stupid name. Miller Genuine Draft. In a can. Right."
"The beer after its release from the 12-ounce bottle set in the glass a limpid bright gold, the head is substantial and a semi-creamy bright white with the left over lace a thin sheet upon the glass, Nose is prototypical malt, sweet and clean, start sweet with a light grain presence and the top thinner than my hair. Finish is light to moderate in acidity, the hops apropos to the style, dry and lingering aftertaste."
"How about the taste? Average but better than MHL. I'd take this if it was priced the same a Busch which is not saying much. Light alcohol flavor, heavy corn flavor but it doesn't specifically taste like corn as the hops and grain balance it taking off the MHL corn edge. Lets just say that if I'm ever going to drink Miller again, this would be the beer."
"This is probably the best beer that you'll see in a plastic cup at a frat house. Clearly, calling both this and Delirium beer seems wrong, but if I was drinking from a keg on someone's lawn and had to choose between MGD, Bud, Coors, and the rest of that class, MGD would come out on top every time. This is the best beer that can be affordably given to dozens or hundreds of people. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it sure beats Special Export."
"My favorite of the American macros. Not great, but not heinous either. It makes me laugh now that back in college I was thought of as a ""beer snob"" because I drank MGD instead of Busch or Natty Ice. Of course, now that I have had some of the better beers, MGD pales in comparison, but I am not averse to buying a six-pack every now and then when I can't decide what I want at the beer store. That pretty much sums MGD up, I guess. Just a generic-looking, generic-tasting, not-too-terrible, relatively cheap beer. Meh."
"not horrable on tap, better than can or bottle. still not by far a good beer but somewhat better than in the bottle. has a flavor to it, not strong but not overly weak either. it was really cheap on tap, so that helps, i guess a fair beer for your value, but i would stick to tap"
"It tastes like Miller High Life only more watery and not as sweet. Not at all bad, but not good either. The aftertaste is a little dry and bitter, which is probably my biggest problem with this beer. It's exceptionally smooth and goes down even easier than Miller High Life, though."
"Basically a standard macro in my opinion. Color is urine yellow and smell is typical macro rice or corn. Taste isn't very flavorful, but is smooth enough not to bother me. Drinkability is fairly decent since GD is smooth and doesn't have any strong negative flavors. Overall, this seems like a typical macro, good as a thirst quencher, but not enough flavor for an enjoyable beer experience."
"This is drinkable in the right circumstances, such as sitting in a sports arena with a hot dog or nachos in one hand, a MGD in the other. Other than that, avoid it."
"I just went to my friends house to celebrate the 4th of July and this beer and Miller Lite were all they had to offer! Shit, damn, other curse words, I can't believe I forgot to bring any beers. The appearance isn't awful because there is a nice fluffy head but this almost looks like water otherwise. No aroma and the taste is very bland, all I really taste is the can. Light in body but I guess it is smooth. I could probably drink a lot of these, but would I really want to? NO!"
"Unlike most American macros in Canada, this is brewed in Wisconsin and actually imported, as opposed to being brewed under license by Labatt/Molson/Sleeman's. Corn taste, reminded me of Corona/Sol in basically every aspect. And it didn't agree with my stomach very much. Yuck."
"I don't want to drink another one these...ever."
"if you can get past the smell, its pretty run-of-the-mill."
"This brew is a sick gold color, white head. Overemphasis on sweet cornsyrup, not much can be said except that this is pretty much youre standard macro brew, probably on the lower half of the macros sad bunch of offerings. On the plus side it comes in plastic bottles so that when you throw them on the field in disgust, no one should be hurt."
"more bbq beer! anyway this was a clear light golden, fizzy white head. aroma was like any other mass produced lager, simple, light...but a touch off. kinda medicinal? flavor was simple and clean...major corn, light hop touch, light mineral taste. not good but not offensive either. of course this was ice cold and i admit, it was refreshing."
"pours a champagne like, bubbly as hell yellow with a medium soapy head. not the worst of the macros in terms of appearance, but nothing good here either. the smell is really pretty bad, even for a macro: watery and metallic hop notes with hints of grain and a rubber tire. taste? what taste? less flavour than a miller lite. watery and sweet, at best. i found none of the finest hops and roasted malts that are boasted on the label, but perhaps noticed some wet cardboard dipped in sugar. drinkability is average, at best, i'd say, for the macro genre. blah."
"Plastic bottle, how low can you go? Yellow insipid color, large bubbles. Minimal head, doesnt stick around long. Nose is of corn and a wiff of cabadge. This stuff is bad, real bad. Taste is of corn, rice and faintist note of malt. cant detect hops, sure a few were put in the kettle. lawn mower beer, good on a very hot day."
"I really cant think of anything to add."
"Other: My can had NASCAR stuff on it. Where's mah pork rinds, boy!"
"I used to work for the local Miller distributor in college in the mid-to-late 80's and I remember when this first came out...I remember it being maltier, and tastier than this current version...I always thought High Life was better and now believe it to be vastly superior...I'm disappointed in this...I didn't expect the greatest beer in the world, and can definitely appreciate a decent macro from time to time....this falls short....I won't go into a lengthy detailed description...I'll sum things up quickly...Overcarbonated...too much head...soapy flavor...some metallic flavors....overall a poor tasting macro..."
"Wow, this beer just snowballs in a bad direction right from the start. The can is even a sickly yellow, big MDG on the label, with lots of faux condensation printed onto the can. Okay appearance for a macro, a little bit darker than straw, thin mottled head of foam that conks out, and even leaves a slight bit of lacing at first. For the smell I am having trouble getting through some sort of industrial/chemical aroma, but hiding behind that is grain husk and what I think is more rice adjunct than corn. The taste is truly repulsive, my god, this is worse than that A Marca Bavaria I had tried. Sharp chemical bite at first, rancid grains to follow, with the most horrible aftertaste I can remember encountering. I would gladly accept a Crazy Ed's Chili Beer to wash this down and kill this aftertaste. I'm craving a malt liquor after this, if only as a small step up in flavour. Can't even focus on the mouthfeel due to the taste. MGD, never again! This is the dregs of the dregs for any macros I've ever consumed so far."
"I can describe MGD in one word, ""undrinkable"". I mean in it's can variant, this shit is just undrinkable. This is coming from a college kid, where Beast is god and when the frat boys actually spring for Coors Light at a party its like Christmas; but this MGD, I couldn't even shotgun this brew without getting sick. Your better off getting some CAMO or Steel Reserve even, steer clear of the MGD at all costs."
"Its sometimes hard to step back and review a beer from the college student perspective. THis beer is not very good when compared to the ranks of true beers. But granted severe budgetary constraints and lack of availability, this isnt necessarily a bad choice. Theres not much appearance to this beer I'd assume, although i did consume it direcly from the can, as I was in a hurry to finish it and be off to more important things. The smell was nothing much in the way of anything except for some slight watery wheats. At least it wasnt too metalic (except for the can smell). The taste was actually bearable. It was watery and bland, but at least it wasnt sickening like most macros. It had an almost pleasant wheaty taste to it, and nothing else at all. I suppose I usually try to rate ""lesser"" beers on terms of whether they make me sick or not. This beer, therefore, succeeded because my stomach remained sympathetic to my causes after drinking it. The mouthfeel was typical, heavily carbonated water. Not much to this beer, except that for my position, it is decently affordable, and for the purposes of college life, it's not a bad beer at all. I'd prefer a High Life to this, but my friends seem to overwhelmingly choose MGD. It works for me, so hey I'll drink it."
"I guess this is drinkable at keg parties but not anywhere else. It poured a clear yellow color with a lightly frothy head that faded after a minute or two. The smell was very sweet and not pleasing at all. The taste was not much better. It was a very sweet taste but a grainy sweetness that got to me after a couple sips. I guess I got used to it after a few sips and it started going down eaiser so I gave it a little bit higher drinkability rating. Overall it is a standard macro that is bland, boring and not worth your time."
"Had this one when out with some friends as there was no other choice. I'm sure glad I was bracing for the worst with this one as it had very little redeeming qualities. Apearance was just a straw gold color with a small white head formed of huge bubbles. Smell, well i couldn't smell anything and in my opinion that's not very good. Taste was just off. There was a dominate earthy flavor in this beer that just seemed to gather in my mouth the further i got down the pint. I guess one could drink a few of these as it wasn't that offensive, but i just couldn't get past the earthy/mud like qualities of this beer."
"Not a great pale lager, infact a very poor one"
"Let's start with why Miller puts their MGD on tap. I thought the whole idea behind the beer was draft beer in a can. Okay, so I decided to find out if it was better on tap. No, it isn't. Straw colored and highly carbonate. The odor reminded me of what a house smells like the morning after a huge party with empties laying all over the place and beer spilled in the corners. It tastes like beer. It is thin and bubbly in the mouth sort of like carbonated water. I did not want to finish the first one, didn't one a second, and didn't get one. The best thing that can be said is that it's better than Natty light or Beast."
"I am not impressed but then again im not suprised. The appearance of the beer isn't all that great. It has a earthy smeel and its very bland in your mouth with a little bit of maltiness but not so noticable. Save your money. What you would expect from one of the biggest in the US."
"MGD has the worst bottling of any beer, the clear bottle just turns you off from the beer. Pours the usuall yellow straw yellow with minimul foamy head that will fizzle away quickly. MGD did have lacing on the glass when I drank it though, I like that some don't care. The smell is of corn, alot of the miller brands have this odd smell of strong corn with minimul hops. The taste is not horrible but not average either. A bitter beer with the corn taste. Feels pretty lively in the mouth though, little more substance than other macros. If I had to choose an american macro this wouldn't be it."
"Drinkability: You could drink them all day; you could also drink Perrier all day. Not offensive or truly awful a-la Pacifica, but a really bland, boring beer. Honestly, the High Life is, IMHO, a much better (and cheaper) brew. I’d pass."
"CONCLUSION: Drink better beers! But if you are trapped without a choice Coors, Bud, Ice House, and MGD."
"Drinkability: Save your money. It breaks my heart to say it because until I had my awakening, this was my favorite beer. To say something constructive about this beer: it won't give you Ebola."
"not bad for macro swill."
"If you beers with a minimum of taste, be my guest."
"Had it from the can and from a mug. Medium yellow, with a very small head. Smells of grain, corn, and a little malt. It is a very smooth beer, somewhat watered-down tasting. The grain flavor is very strong, almost defining this beer. Not the worst thing I have ever had, but it's lacking many elements to be a good beer."
"Tastes like liquid cheerios - and I enjoy cheerios. Lots of my friends drink this, and I can drink it all day without complaining. If you keep it cold, its a good beer for mindless summer activity like softball or fishing. when warm, it tends to acquire an unpleasant sour fruit flavor, and alchohol notes- it becomes ""not good at all"". Just keep it cold and its OK."
"pretty much a disgrace, if i was faced with this and a CUB brew, id probably just take the carlton. this would be pretty close to the worst overall import ive ever had. why cant the U.S govt let them import some decent beer? surely thats not too much to ask."
"This wouldn't ever be my regular beer, but I'll gladly drink it in an environment where better beer isn't available."
"i bought this in the form of a forty ounce. I couldn't see drinking a Miller any other way. First thing is first. This is a really pretty beer. Gilden yellow color that leads to a frothy head. sounds pretty good so far. i smelled it. It smelled sour. Not too strong, but the scent was there. I tipped back my glass and got a very weak malt taste. I'm not sure, but it had seemed a little watery too me. If I wanted water I would have got a glass from the sink. Pretty average for the style. I'm sorry Miller. I know we were friends back in high school, but I grew up. I have new friends now."
"The flavor is more sour than bitter and it should be served ice cold so as not to inflame your taste buds. I guess if your goal is to find a cheap way to drink something that is labeled as 'beer', this one would qualify"
"Fizzy yellow color, small head. Chemical macro-beer aroma. EECH, this stuff reeks. Cornish flavor. Some malts, some hops and some flavor. Mass-market swill. Drank it cause it was free. Think I will drink a soda next time. Mouthfeel is thin and metallic. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is neutral."
"Came in a clear, pull cap bottle. Poured an extremely pale yellow colour, with next to no head. Sparce lace through the glass. Weak corn and malt smell. Not alot of hops in neither scent nor taste. Reminded me of stale cheerios. No aftertaste at all. Thin mouthfeel. Drinkable on a hot, summer day after the lawn is mowed and you expired enough sweat to fill a kiddie pool. Too be honest, it isn't that bad."
"Drinkability  Thirty-minutes of prep time in the freezer and canned to keep out the skunk does the trick with this one. That aftertaste though probably took it down a whole point."
"This brew poured a large creamy head of fine white bubbles. It has a weak transparent urine yellow body. Its mild malt hop bread flavor is not bad, but is more like drinking flavored water with no bite. It does leave a slight aftertaste and is a little fizzy."
"Drinkability - on a hot day, all day. Keep 'em cold and they go down easy. You see, you don't have to worry about drinking them so fast that you might miss something. You have the full picture in about 6 seconds."
"Meduim yellow, perhaps light golden color body topped by a loose white head that recedes fairly quickly to nothing. Large bubbles of carbonation are visible on every surface. The aroma is slightly sweet, typical ""beer"" smell. The taste has a touch of pleasing sweetness, then mellows out to nothingness. Slight metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light and harsh, like strongly carbonated water. Drinkability is decent on the first can after a hot day, but subsequent glasses go much more slowly. One is really enough of this. I drank it as an alternative to Coors Light, and in the name of beer Advocacy. Next time, I'll probably have water."
"16 oz. can poured into a plastic cup at last nights White Sox game (White Sox 4, Red Sox 2; Pedro vs. Buehrle, Joe Crede 3 run HR in the 6th the key). Pale yellow with a very thick, sticky, foamy white head (bad pour by the beer man who was more focused on making change [he undercharged me though] than on the proper tilt of the ""glass""). Very little aroma or taste present, and in both cases what is present is not very good. Thin feel in the mouth, similar to water, so at least its fairly easy drinking. Would have tasted much better had this been a very hot day, rather than a nice evening in the mid 60's. Preferable to beers like Bud, but I can't think of anytime other than at a Sox game that I would choose to drink it."
"eh... one of the better offerings from any of the macros. decent head with a sick ass golden yellow color, i may be biased here as i might feel differently about the color if it was a respectable beer. smelled kinda skunky, with that typical smell of most macrobrewery beer. just smelled like cheap beer, you know what i mean. taste isn't awful, it isn't good either, the aftertaste is a little chemical like. doesn't have the seltzer water body of some other macro beers, so thats a plus. overall... eh... i'll drink it."
"One of my favorite domestic beers available today. Tastes best in a bottle, also provides a great aftertaste!!! I am usually more of a light beer drinker myself, but when it comes to regular domestic beers, Miller Genuine Draft is definitely up high on the ladder according to me."
"I drink this if I go out to eat and can't get anything else."
"MGD. Pours out to a pale, golden color in the glass with a big, fizzy white head. Aroma is that of slight corn and some chemical smell I can't quite put my finger on. The taste is not good. Its harsh and leaves a strange aftertaste. Burnt corn? I never understood why Miller pushed this to the forefront and discarded Miller ""Red"" (label) which was a much better beer."
"Pale gold in color with a fizzy white head and some trailing lace. The aroma is reminiscent of old rice water, corncob and hops. The light sweet malt is bland and near flavorless. The light/medium lightly citrus and metallic and hops is the star of this brew. It cant truly be a draft in the can, because its pasteurized! Odd slightly astringent flavor is detected in the back of the throat. In support of this beer, its not totally disgusting."
"It's clear yellow, actually slightly darker than many other American style lagers. The smell is grainy and just a bit grassy with little detectable hop aroma. The taste is also grainy with adjuncts not so subtly announcing their presence. That corn taste is most noticeable in the aftertaste. Although it's rather dry, I also found that it left a somewhat strange aftertaste, detracting from what might have been more drinkable beer than most of its style. It's another uninspired effort from a big one."
"A soft, typical american beer. it pours a simple, common lager colour, golden and yellowish. Its smell is not strong or very appealing, hinting what the taste will be like. its taste is not that bad, a soft, sweet feeling with a slight hint of bitterness at the end. Not the best of beers, but can be bought again."
"Yuck! Another American beer that tasted flat. It did pour a large head though as I will give this beer at least that much credit. It had a fruity aroma to it. It had a somewhat smooth taste. I did not notice any bitterness with this beer and no aftertaste. This beer simply has no character to it."
"Pours a gold color with a decent white head. There is very little retention and only mild lacing. The taste is much like high life but not as full, perhaps more delicate. Taste of adjuncts and a bit of sweet overtaste. Definitely of the standard macro mode."
"I wonder how people drink this stuff, then I realize that they've been hoodwinked! Somehow, they've been convinced that this foul concoction is actual beer and the Miller Brewing Co. is happy to provide. Lord save us all..."
"The taste in smooth and inoffensive, exactly as it was designed to be. A lingering slight malty sweetness, with grainy flavors, and a very minimal and faded hop bite in the finish. Better than a ""lite"" beer, but that is the best you can say about MGD."
"I guess some people could drink a lot of this. If I'm going to have macros in the Midwest, I could do better with an Old Style, Point or Lienies."
"MGD, she's definitely looking exactly like a nice full glass of piss. This is definitely a fizzy white beer, and I am not going to be like Stone and say it's for wussies. It's just for people who don't know what good beer is. Some mild sweetness of corn and rice grain origin. Flavor is well, ok a little on the sweet side, but definitely drinkable and for the price I guess you could justify buying it, but why try when there are so many more beers out there deserving the purchase."
"Best of the Big 3 (with exception to blue moon and killians of course)"
"feels prertty bad in the mouth and its not very drinkable..and to think Miller put this AHEAD of their much better product, High Life..strange world we live in!"
"For an American Lager, it was very good. It fit the style well. If I was at a restaurant and they only had ice tea and MGD, I probably would take the tea."
"Personal Notes: My father drank this. It sems that he picked the better macros. This was better than I thought and although it has adjuncts, I don't believe it's packed full of them like others. The malt and body were a pleasant surprise but...still needs work."
"Pours a clear light golden color with a decent head. The head fades pretty fast but does leave a decent lace. Slightly metallic on the nose, musty as well. Watered down taste with no real malt or hop character. A very slight bitterness, but it's not hoppy at all. Thin mouthfeel, not very carbonated either. It is drinkable, but so is water."
"Light overall aroma, somewhat sweet and sour. Mostly malt, with virtually no hops. Color was light gold and clear. Medium head. Mostly a sour and bitter taste, malt based with hops for dryness. Full mouthfeel from carbaonation, otherwise thin. Basic macro brew. I liked it even less than I thought I would."
"One of the better ones from this huge macro-brewer. But still not that great. It pours a nice straw color that has little head that fades but remains present throughout. It has grainy smell to it and a taste that is not much more, maybe a little bit of corn. The mouthfeel is moderately smooth but does have a fair amount of carbonation. The drinkability is barely decent, but if prepared properly this brew could be a good one to drink throughout the night. I personally will probably never recommend it to anyone unless they are desperate for something cheap but fairly decent."
"Poured into the glass this beer was a golen color. One of its highlights. The head was full and white. Disappeared quite fast. No lace. There was a small hint of hops but hardly. The taste was crisp when cold, and had small small small hints of hops. Has to be ice cold to be ok. And if it is free, it is better."
" King of the crap not to badd!"
"Pours out clear and golden with a white bubbly, foamy head.  Aroma is of malted barley and somewhat bread-like.  Real thin watery body has a mild crispness with a sharp carbonated bite upfront.  Another watered down Miller product.  Nothing special here, but probably my favorite from Miller's top trio of MGD, Lite and High Life."
"a bit better out of the bottle than the can. it is still nothing special, but when you are young, you feel good with bottles. now, it is something i don't even think about, but for some little teenie boppers this could be their dom perignon of beers"
"Like the bottle, although it is prone to the ""skunk"" factor. Nice bright color, a hint of hops, but it tastes mass produced. I think of high school or drinking on the corner with this one. If you left it out all night in the winter, it would freeze, you would thaw it in the sun, and it would taste even better!  And who could forget whizzing into an empty bottle and trying to pass it off to a friend? An American classic!"
"At best an average lager...maybe a little flat which is odd considering the amount of carbonation that is present. Mild after taste. Not Millers best offering but does seem to improve after the 2nd....and with the addition of ice crystals."
"Out of all the major breweries, this is my favorite. It has to be in glass and not can's. But, it still is not the greatest of beers. I still can't figure out why they put it in clear glass. This and Henry's are the only two that if I have company, I'll buy for them. Most people that visit me, don't know sh-- for shineola about beers anyway! Give them anything free and they think it's the greatest!"
"This is typical American fare, but very refreshing and recommended over Bud products. It goes great with a pizza, and Will Ferrell does the commercials for Miller, so it gets a few coolness points from me."
"Poured a very clear pale yellow with a 2 finger head that dissipates quickly as all american lagers seem to do.  Smells of sweet corn and not much else.  Tastes...not much there but is incredibly smooth.  Overall a thumbs down, but way better than Bud or Coors!  Cheers!"
"There was head, but it looked like the foam that collects near the banks of a polluted river. The hops are barely there, along with a nasty retro-nasal aroma of crackers mashed up with old lettuce. There's also a little bit of malt and grain flavor at the end. Very clean, no aftertaste at all. In my opinion this is about as bad as a beer can get without having something wrong with it."
"Roasty toasty something there. Like a pallette fire in the woods with someone passing around a resinated pipe. Cattails are there too. Some flavor. This is like a flattened, photographed, translated version of a good beer. An imitation of an imitation. Don't drink this."
"I find that Miller Genuine Draft is uninspiring with few of the qualities that I've grown accustom to in a beer, one of those qualities being, good taste. There are saving graces... one being the alcohol and two there was no plastic can liner taste."
"I was feeling nostalgic so I bought a 22 oz. bottle of MGD.  It turns out MGD is pure swill.  I just dont like it.  It starts off pale-gold with a frothy white head (so far so good).  But MGDs taste is nothing but corn & sweet, thats it.  It is not enjoyable at all.  I cant believe I used to drink this a long time ago.  The smell is a muted, twisted skunk & sweet corn.  This sh*t was a chore to finish.  This is a beer I will never have again and I lament buying it today"
"Pours a straw color. The white head fizzes out quickly. On the nose there is not much of anything. On the palate, it's slightly malty and the mouth feel is smooth. It's very easy to drink, and glides down with ease. Notch below High Life."
"Decent macro brew. Goes well with pizza or in a keg at a wedding reception but stay away if you are looking for something with character. Barely a 1/2 step above the rest of the Amercian macro garbage."
"Drinkability/notes: This beer is surprisingly poor compared to Miller High Life, which I find interesting as it is marketed as an upscale beer, and one that typically commands a higher price than Miller High Life."
"Miller is the sibling to Budweiser, with the same lack of color, no body and a strange aftertaste it leaves.  For some reason though, I find the taste of this one more odd the Budweiser."
"This is a little better than your typical macrobrew.  Pale yellow in color, with a decent head with big quickly dissapating bubbles. Good blend of ingredients, but noticble adjuncts when the beer becomes warmer.  They try to market to people who like draft beer by selling this ""draft quality"" beer in a bottle. If you want to drink draft, drink draft!!"
"I'd go with this one over most it's peers.  Still, it is pretty bad"
"MGD: in the infamous black can.  Weak pale head, which dissipated to nothing in nothing flat.  Pale macro-lager color.  Adjunct aroma, with a sour adjunct/corn taste.  Lingering, bad aftertaste.  I recall liking this in bottles, don’t like this in that black can."
"Both High Life and MGD have that real nice corn-sweetness kick right off the bat."
"for an american macro, i don't fnd too much fault with it.  poured a nice head which stuck, of course there is the adjunt aroma of corn.  mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth. taste is average...but not bad. some maltiness with a slight hop finish that doesn't bite.  very thirst quenching and satisfying. always a bit more expensive than High Life,  and i'm not sure what you're getting for the extra $$$.  maybe they use more corn, i don't know.  overall, pretty good."
"Besides the head being awfully soapy looking it's got good color. No smell to speak of. Somebody below said it tasting of corn. That is a good description and I never thought of it that way. I guess when it comes to American Macros this is up there."
"Big bubbled, ""laundry detergent"" head, about 60 seconds of duration.  Mid yellow color and just the vaguest of smell.  Bubbly taste, a typical macro clean-ness with little more than a corn sweetness attenuated by a slightly bitter finish that comes on like a door slamming.  A weird feeling of seltzer water in the esophogus and stomach.  Didn't demonstrate much last night, not even worth having to clean the pilsner glass."
"Notes: This beer would have been ok but the after taste is damaged with an unpleasant dryness. There are other macros that will do a better job of being totally bland to quench your thoughtless thirst."
"Maybe a bit better than bud, but still has no taste, doesn't really do anything for the imagination, i don't like it."
