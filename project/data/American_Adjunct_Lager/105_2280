2.2,-1.8,3.5,2.25,2,2,2.25,"Pours a finger of sudsy, frothy white head, fades quickly to a thin film, and decent spotty lacing. Clear and straw colored. Smells of cereal grains, slightly skunky, very straightforward. Bland taste, with a short bitter hop bite. Slight citric tartness and notes of straw/hay in aftertaste. Feels watery, with higher carbonation. Taste does not linger at all, not that I'd want it to. Overall, I simply can't bring myself to find anything really pleasing or outstanding about this macro. If nothing else, it looks good.","sporklift87","Saturday at 07:20 PM"

In fact, none of the flavor lasts or really asserts itself in any way. No aftertaste. Smell is a bit skunky but this doesn't come through in the taste. Light mouthfeel, easy drinking, no challenge at all, the mac and cheese of beer. I wouldn't turn my nose up at this on a hot summer day at a BBQ, but I'm not going to be the one to bring it to said BBQ or buy this unless it's really the only beer in the one local store out in the middle of the wild.","takusan1000","Mar 18, 2015"

The smell you pick up on grains and corn. The look and smell is that of an American Adjunct Lager. There is nothing special about this brew so far. The taste is ok you pick up on the corn in this brew, but it is not bad. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. There is nothing bad about this brew.Miller Genuine Draft goes down smooth with a clean finish. Overall I'm giving this brew a 3.25 out of 5. This is not the worst I've had but not the best.

I didn't care for bud light, milwaukee's best, coors, pbr, or any of the other big-name generic beers out there. they tasted like water-down crap. I remember first tasting this beer and liking it for its crisp, citrus notes, and then seeking out beers with more intense flavors. while it pales in comparison to what I enjoy drinking now, that's okay. it's still very easy to drink, cheap, and tastes decent.","jumpingmonsters","May 27, 2014"

People getting this and complaining seem like they don't even realize what theyre buying.. It isn't meant to be a craft beer at all.. It simply suppose to taste like a fresh draft beer.. that's it.. and to me it tastes BETTER than many drafts.. I will admit the taste can vary.. sometimes they taste better than others.. and tbh The PAST mgd seemed better than whats made now.. But maybe its my tastes changing, no idea. But it has a very cereal grainy smell to it.. stronger than any beer I can think of.. everytime I smell it I think ""cereal"". it has a lot of carbonation and in my opinion, a decent taste. When I buy beer this is basically the cheapest beer I will ever buy, and it sure does the trick for what It is.. The only complaint I might have is I can drink ALOT of them.. seems like an 18 pack of these doesn't last long.. black crown is the same way... something about them makes u wanna drink em fast...","Warmonster","Feb 20, 2014"

I can imagine how bad the 64 is, because its parent beer is a shocker. feel isn't that bad, a little thicker than it should be, but the carbonation is fine. overall this is something to avoid. it would chose it over some of the basement dwellers and budlight on principle, but this is really disgusting. the clear bottles do it no favors either.","StonedTrippin","Mar 23, 2013"

A lot of malt in the flavor with mild bitterness from the hops and little in the way of sweetness. Light to medium body but still fairly oily coating the palate and moderate carbonation.

Flavor is a weak mixture of sweet, grainy, corny, and slight tinge of over processed hops. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation generous and rather watery. On the balance, this is a marginally decent adjunct lager and reminds me a bit of Corona.","EagleTalon","Dec 14, 2012"

Easily the best offering from the Miller company that I have had to date, Perhaps slightly beating High Life.

3,33.9,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours out an extremely clear morning urine yellow color. The head retention is actually quite impressive as is the amount of carbonation. However I don't think all those bubbles will add anything positive to the mouthfeel. The smell is actually less solvent and offensive as I've found their other beers but far from good. What I can smell is a barely perceptible bready smell, and other weird cereal grain smells. No hop presence at all. Wow, tastes like, your average mindless American beer. It's even more marginal than i thought it would be. It's not even bad enough to suck! How disappointing! Some stale bread flavors, old soggy grains, and hmm, can't pickup the corn. The corn adjuncts must have been genetic bred out of the beer and covered up by those other faint flavors I am describing. Mouthfeel is kind of prickly but again nothing too offensive. I think Miller has developed some space age beer flavor now that they are just adding to their beers rather than really brewing anything. How do you think they pulled of MGD 64? Carbonated water and beer flavor concentrate, right out of the can....","Star80","Jan 31, 2012"

I would prefer this in a can but I also prefer not to buy a lot of it so I could only find a 6 pack in bottles. Pretty average looking American lager yellow pour with a burst of white fizzy head then nothing. Aroma is grain, cereal, and bread. The body is thin. The taste also rather bready with a clean enough hop finish for the American Adjunct style. Burger beer.","puboflyons","Jan 25, 2012"

Miller high life is a much better macro alternative and sells for less. An interesting side note is that while in Ireland for 11 days last summer, I noticed that Miller was trying to infiltrate the american import market there(which Bud has a stranglehold on, its on draft in every pub) and the only product of theirs I saw was MGD. Oddly, if you saw anyone drinking a Budweiser over there they were undoubtedly Irish. I guess Bud is import to them technically, and the whole grass is greener on the other side thing holds true.

Pale yellow with a very thick, sticky, foamy white head (bad pour by the beer man who was more focused on making change [he undercharged me though] than on the proper tilt of the ""glass""). Very little aroma or taste present, and in both cases what is present is not very good. Thin feel in the mouth, similar to water, so at least its fairly easy drinking. Would have tasted much better had this been a very hot day, rather than a nice evening in the mid 60's.

Although it's rather dry, I also found that it left a somewhat strange aftertaste, detracting from what might have been more drinkable beer than most of its style.
