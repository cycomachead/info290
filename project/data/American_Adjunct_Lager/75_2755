I actually thought this was a pretty good beer, with a malty kick and good mouthfeel.  With moderate carbonation and a golden color sprouting a white head, the beer looked and tasted above average to me.  Now, is that because I already had two Negra Modelos before I tried this?

Perhaps the most widely available shitty macro-lager in these parts, with the possible (likely) exception of Corona, a pale yellow fizzbomb with no head to speak off, although if you deliberately do an aggressive pour into a clean glass you can get about four fingers of blink and you miss it creamy white foam. Sorry, I fuck around a little when I get bored. Smells pretty mellow but what's there speaks of cooked corn, whiffs of apple and grape hard candy, skunk, dead grass (I am not exaggerating), and sweet dough. Classic macro lager taste and feel. Has almost a cotton candy sweetness, marginally thicker and less corny than Corona but this is not saying that much. More apple and grainy notes late. There is a German brewing tradition in this beer's pedigree but you'd never know it based on taste. Terrible brew truth be told, although a good study for those interested in intimate knowledge of DMS and the odd fruity notes one gets with under-aged beers.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 29, 2014"

There are beers out there that taste phenomenal, but you wouldn't want to drink more than 2-3 of them. While this beer has a pretty sticky aftertaste (probably the corn), it doesn't have the tang of the other americana mainstays - corona, bud et al. It also has a surprising maltiness that I would have thought would not appeal to the market (try a warm one as opposed to a cold one) that gives a very nicely rounded mouth feel. While it does have the sticky aftertaste, it is in every other way quite clean, which is a nice compromise between pure bitters and pure lagers. This is a good beer for good sunny times. I don't think it's going to be winning any awards for being super amazing or innovative, but sometimes having your socks blown off only means you need to be buying new socks all the time! It also has the nice attribute of not giving a man next morning fog (that's what the outstanding is for).","baalsword","Sep 08, 2013"

3.67,37.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pacifico Clara is a better than average everyday beer with a nice copper color and a refreshing, thirst-quenching quality. Understanding this beer is not intended to be a craft beer or high gravity, it beats most US mass-produced beers hands down for taste and quality. Mouth feel is nice though slightly watery which is outstanding on a hot afternoon. Once on an early June day hike in the Arizona mountains I stuck a few bottles in a melting snow bank at the trail head before taking off. On my weary return I cracked open bottle after bottle of PC and was warmly welcomed by an ice cold Mexican kiss. Looking for a decent but low key beer to enjoy with friends by the grill? Pacifico Clara will fill the bill nicely.","hoppyserpent","Aug 02, 2013"

Light in body and color with a mild flavor, Pacifico is very appropriate for the style, if not at all impressive for it. Featuring a slight bitterness at the end, this is a very good beer for pairing with southwestern and Latin based dishes, but is not very enjoyable on its own. There is a blandness and a softness to it that adventerous beer lovers may be left unimpressed by. As a ubiquitous and commercialized beer meant for consumption by the general public, it does exactly what it's supposed to do and nothing more. Much more palatable than Corona.","Aaron_Ramson","Jul 24, 2013"

I split a 22 oz. bottle of this between a friend and I. Initially I expected this too be bad. Overall I rate Mexican beer at average or below. The appearance was a decent yellow color. It didn't like artificial. The carbonation is high as I expected. The beer has a nice balmy smell. Some esters move in followed by good pale smelling malts. As I titled the glass to my lips I discovered a nice Pilsner. It isn't distinctive but it is refreshing to taste a Mexican beer with some character (e.g. Bohemia) The taste is pale and has a good hop profile too it. Pacifico and crisp and refreshing. I am enjoying the taste of this beer. It doesn't present any repulsive or off flavors. It is light bodied and would perfect for washing down Enchiladas or other spicy foods. or enjoying while hanging out on a warm summer day. This beer is mild but has more character than I expected.

Has a light malt and grain flavor, some bitterness in the end, not especially aromatic or flavorful in any way. The texture is much like a slightly viscous soda pop. The beer is easy to drink, but would get old fast for my taste. I have to compare this to the other common Mexican lagers and in the respect, it definitely does well.

I also discovered craft beer that way that most of us here know it but this beer is just good mass produced lager, it's not rotten like most mass produced Mexican swill. I even drink it ocasionally at my local Mexican restaurant called Puerta Vallarta. I even squeeze the lime and it tastes so good in bottle or frosted mug. Bottles there are 2 bucks, I just finished a 20 dollar bottle of Infinium. I'd rather drink ice cold Pacifico with Arroz con Pollo and Chile Relleno anyday. Even compared to other shitty beers, this is good tasting and enjoyable, so I'm offended that this is considered the bottom of the barrel. Yes it's fizzy yellow beer and it has corn and rice adjuncts but this one is a lesser of all evils for me. Flavor wise straight or with lime it has subtle sweetness no raw off flavors just a dynamic drinking experience that comes of both drinkable and enjoyable especially when paired with the right foods.

It pours a slightly cloudy yellow color with little head that dies quickly. The aroma is boring - mass produced style. The malts are slightly detectable in the flavor and the carbonation shows itself pretty well also. Still, it has the mass-product taste. The aftertaste was pretty dry. Not a favorite.","clvand0","Sep 12, 2003"
2.79,4.5,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Ahh, Pacifico. I would choose this beer over Corona every single time. And I dare say that I do enjoy this beer with a wedge of lime squeezed on in. I have had this beer plenty of times over the years in numerous Mexican restaurants and other places. As I drink, I am thinking about Cabo San Lucas and lobster dinners on the beach. Eating with your feet in the sand on a beautiful Mexican night, drinking Pacificos. Bright and clear fizzy yellow with a foamy white head. Slightly metallic in the aroma (I dont remember that!) with some whiffs of grains and lemons. Theres a sweetness in the body and finishes harshly bitter and dry. If this beer was cheaper, I would probably buy more of it, but once and awhile is fine.","pezoids","Sep 09, 2003"

Smell is nothing spectacular - grainy malt with a barely detectable hop aroma. The taste is not too bad - malt overtones, dry hop finish, slightly over-balanced on the side of the hops. Carbonation is very active in the mouth, and it really hits the tip and the back of the tongue. A very drinkable beer that should go quite well with burritos tonight.","jlervine","Jul 11, 2003"

Aroma has a bit of corn husk and a merging into hay-in-the-field hops, but this "argicultural" theme is very restrained. This bottle was not skunky. As much as the aroma and appearance are of little note, they are the most distinctive features of the beer. Sweet start, very little at the close, medium carbonation. Pretty close to tasteless, not offensive, but below many macros in impression.","ADR","Jun 20, 2003"

Chinchy or what? Pours a clear pale color with a modest white soda-like head that disappeared rapidly while making a fizzy noise. The smell consists of light corn, an earthy grain, and a light sweetness. Not too enticing! The flavor mimics the aromas with a light carb bite to boot. This beer should be considered a light lager with its watery mouthfeel. Not a good beer at all although its blandness makes for a slightly better than average drinker.

3.08,15.4,3,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Like an American macrobrew, the lack of protein from the excessive use of corn and/or rice as adjuncts prevents any head retention.  A touch of dimethyl sulfide (cooked cabbage) in aroma, w/ just a hint of malt sweetness. Hop nose is absent.  There's a bit more going on in flavor when compared to Budmillercoors-- hop bitterness is above the norm, and cooked corn and residual malt sweetness is thus thankfully masked.  Not quite as thin in body as a typical macrobrew, but quite light nonetheless.  Finishes dry and bland.
