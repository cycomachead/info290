"Enjoy"
"Overall 3.25: Good beer.  I am sure this would be like finding an oasis in the desert if you could drink one (or more) of these on a hot day in equatorial Africa, where it is brewed.  This is a good lager and not everyone is fond of, or really appreciates a lager these days...with good reason.  Regardless, this is a refreshing beer and worth a try if you are at a restaurant or at a beer store."

"On the sweet side of Lagers, generally average beer but drinkable.   Nothing to hate, nothing to stand out."

"Very good creamy smooth pale lager."
"Pours a clear golden color with white head. Cereal grains on the nose; follows onto the palate. Some sweetness on the palate as well. Finishes with a typical lager finish, lightly sweet."
""
"Final Thoughts: I honestly did not expect this beer to be as good as it was. This one was not another ""tried one Lager tried them all"" as there were enough unique aspects to this one that made me appreciate the nuance. Is it worth the cost of importing? Yeah, I'd say just barely,. I'm gonna give it a thumb up, give it a shot."
""

"Sweet edge that does not become pervasive.  Citric fruitiness as an underlying flavor that adds a nice character that differentiates Tusker from other lagers.  Nothing standout, but enjoyable."
"Like the overall taste and the look"
""
""
""
""
"Overall there is nothing amazing going on with this lager, it is not the worst adjunct lager I have tasted but it is not the best either. I would drink it again but I will not go looking for it."

"Nice and subtle on the tongue. Good Beer here!!!"

"Aroma was grainy, biscuit, rice/corn, smells bland and very much like an adjunct lager. There was a very slight earthy hop character and it took on a slight tang as it warmed. It poured a pale golden color with a big white head and it had a body that surprised me, I was expecting water and got something light to medium with a moderate carbonation level. Taste was BORING! That blandness really carried through to the palate. Grainy, biscuit from the malt, subtle earthy hop, but mostly a whole lotta nothin. It's just not a good beer, if this is the style I'm going for I might as well be handed a Bud Light."

"Smooth lager poured from a bottle. No head but minimal lacing. Clean with no after taste."
"This is just a nice change of pace.  Very pale in color and certainly with a hint of adjuncts in both the aroma and taste.  The mouthfeel is quite neutral with sufficient carbonation.  Overall nothing particularly special but certainly worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"Given a selection of lagers from various areas that included this, I would definitely recommend Tusker as a solid choice."

"This is a refreshing beer and very much native to Kenya. One can find it everywhere in Kenya and comes darn cheap! 500 ml bottles of the Tusker are sold at US$1. For the price, it's a bargain. Being a Lager it is quite smooth and light. One can definitely swap water for a Tusker, any day!"
""

""
""
"O: pretty decent... wouldn't mind drinking a few of these if it was the only thing around"
""
""
"O: Just another adjunct lager (JAAL), this time from Africa."
""
""
""
"Overall - A simple easy drinking American adjunct. Nothing really stands out here from other American adjuncts. This brew would be good after doing some yardwork."
""

"I'm surprised at how tasty this was."
""
"O: Great for an African beer. Again, cool bottle and label, and unique coming from Africa. This was my first beer ever at the University of Guelph years ago. Nice to have found it again today in Port Perry, ON."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Drinkable and not that bad for an Adjunct Lager"
""
"Still drinkable enough to enjoy it."

"Tusker poured a very clear yellow/gold colour with plenty of rising bubbles visible. Pouring produced about 1.5"" of pure white head that lasted for several minutes, leaving a considerable amount of lacing all down the far side of the glass. Its aroma is quite simple, bready light malts and not much of anything else. The beer's flavour begins with a fleeting light malt sweetness and finishes with a very, very subtle hop bitterness and no aftertaste. Despite the quantity of visible bubbles I found the carbonation to be quite light, and I would describe the mouthfeel as light and watery. I guess this makes sense...if I was living in an African climate I probably wouldn't be looking for a hefty porter or stout. The good news...my first African beer was drinkable. The not so good...I found Tusker to be too light in aroma, flavour and body for my particular taste. Though it wasn't a bad beer, I doubt that I'll be buying this one again. Tusker was selling for $3.35 per 500 ml bottle at the time or writing."

"This beer pours light golden, with light head, and had average carbonation. It has little to no aroma, its has the tastes of fruits, hops, vegetables, and goes down fairly easy. It finishes dirty, leaves the mouth dry, and is no better than the average domestic pale lager."
""
""
""
""
"I wanted to like this. Will try again but too watery and non-descript. Stella is better."
""
""
"Pour a crystal clear golden straw color with a decent sized tightly bubbled white head that dissipates quickly to a faint cap on top. Aromas of sweet grainy honey like pilsner malt and a faint floral hop. I'm a bit surprised that the aroma is so damn inviting. The flavor is lightly sweet and honey like with some faint earthy spicy hop to balance. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and slick sugary water mouthfeel. Very nice example of a pale lager, I could see some of these on a warm summer day."

"O: I can see how this would be refreshing in its native climate, but then again I'd probably chug any beer you put in front of me while the hot African sun was beating down me. A pretty average ""Euro"" feeling lager in every respect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has a nice African history tradition, nevertheless is not even a superior Adjunct Lager. I would pass."

"Aroma isn't very strong but appealing. Too bad the flavor is rather diffused and weak. Okay overall. Makes for a decent thirst quencher but won't do much for you if you're seeking memorable taste."
""

"Overall- Very mediocre to almost poor. We've all had this beer before and it's pretty much the reason why many of us are so obsessive about craft beer- we want a beer that tastes like something. This doesn't. You can pass on it."
"O: An expensive PBR. I have a fond memory of this beer from college, but upon a real reflection of it I realize that it just isn't that great of a brew. I think I'll pass on it next time I see one and leave that memory (mostly) untarnished."
""
""
"O: Not very interesting, to be sure, but as far as macro lagers go, this one is actually kind of good. Import prices kill any chance of me buying this again in 'Merica, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A non-offensive beer that is bland and has no character."
""
""
""
"I likely wont buy a bottle of this again, but it was basically what I expected would come out of a hot place like Kenya - a refreshing and not intensely flavoured lager, but pleasantly not full of adjuncts. Nice work at making a good adjunct lager - where the adjuncts are not the first thing you notice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is decent. Light hue, nice head, and thick lacing. Nose is pungent and nutty. Pale and washed out malt with a synthetic sweet/soapy palate. Overall, this is a pretty average quaff."
""
""
""
"Light bodied with average carbonation. Nothing special here, just a typical Adjunct Lager. I am glad I had a chance to try this. Too bad the beer wasn't better."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of pale malt, rice, hint of hops, and a hint of sorghum. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness. Tastes of rice, pale malt, hint of hops, and a hint of sorghum. Overall, decent appearance, but otherwise average at best in all other categories."
""
""
"o - refreshing enough, middle of the road, but very acceptable and happy to see Kenya producing a decent brew. I can drink it again..."
""
""
""
"O- this is just what the body needed. If you find yourself in the same situation, pass on the Kilimanjaro Lager and have this instead! The best you'll get in the area"
""
""
"RJT"
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light golden amber with a thin white head with good retention and lacing. Faint aroma of sweet malt and grassy wheat. Flavor is light slightly sweet malt and a hint of grassy hops. Finishes rather dry and abruptly leaving a slightly mineral aftertaste. Light bodied. A very bland and lightly flavored lager with no off flavors, but nothing really to recommend it. At least I can tick Kenya without flying thousands of miles for this."
""
"Overall: Nothing extremely special, probably about right for a typical lager with an extra point or two for not tasting skunky and I’d guess when having a fresh bottle in the country it originates from it would be very thirst quenching and agreeable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent light lager."
"I doubt I'll ever find myself in Kenya but if I do, I'd probably drink the hell out of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkable. Yes. Collectible? Maybe for he bottle."
""
"O: Comparing to other foreign lagers, excellent. NOT WORTH the 3.49 a bottle, but still very good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Average lager that has better than average flavor. And they do it better then the macros here."
""
"Overall nothing too special about the taste of this beer, but it wasn't bad. The website says all of the ingredients are sourced in Africa which is pretty cool. I'd say it is a good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm glad I can say I've tried something from Africa, but probably won't seek this out again."
"Overall / Drinkability: Despite not being much to look, it's still a crisp and refreshing beer. I could easily have another. It's a simple and unassuming beer and it goes quite well with food to wash it down (fish tacos in my case). I suspect it would go quite well with highly spicy African food as well to counter the fire and heavy flavor from that type of food. Glad I tried it."
""
""
"I really liked the fact that they still re-use the bottles. Not crush, melt and make a new bottle like in the US. I didn't find this a very flavorful beer but what flavor it did have was nice. It is a decent beer for those hot summer nights. I wouldn't bother trying to save a lot of luggage space to bring some back, maybe a bottle or two."
"Good on a hot day. Not offensive and pretty refreshing, but not terribly inspiring."
""
"Another bottle. I've been drinking pale yellow fizzy adjunct lagers for basically a decade now, and as with my original review I still feel Tusker is one of the better examples I've tried. The only issue? It's just too expensive to be worth it. If money were no object then this would be a staple in my summer beer fridge, but until then I probably won't bother frequently."
""
""
""
"O - It's actually a lot better than I expected. It has some taste or it is mildly pleasing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- For as bad the score I'm giving it, it is actually fairly drinkable. It would be hard not to be considering it is so watery."
""
"People mention sweet water. I didnt taste no sweetness. Just water"
""
"O: This was a pretty forgettable Lager. It was crisp and refreshing but nothing I would grab again. Although I am pretty sure this would be refreshing on a hot day in Africa."
"As much as I wanted to like this, I just don't dig it."
""
"Overall this was a terrible larger, it was undrinkable and the smell was truely awful. Worst beer I've ever had."
"Maybe I haven't had an adjunct lager in awhile but this was a decent drink. No off-flavors or bad smell."
"D: as far as an adjunct lagers go, this one is okay. good nose and flavor, considering what little there is to start with."
"O: Very easy to drink and quite sessionable due to the light flavors, smell, and ABV. But honestly, I'm not sure that I would really want to drink many of these or have it again... I prefer a little more flavor and something a little more interesting."
"O: Hey - not bad man. Would Tusker be a gold medal award winner at International Monde Selection if it were?"
""
""
"Carbonation could use a boost, I think it would help a bit. But not too much bubbles as they would detract from the flavors"
"At last! An African beer. Slowly my list is being completed. But will it be done before my liver and my life is? Doubtful. At least when I meet St. Peter I’ll be able to say “Take me or leave me, I drank an African brew. Bitch.” So….. anyway. Out of a bottle this beer from the Dark Continent was a clear, pale, yellow color. The one finger of white head fizzed out rather quickly and only a few streaks of sticky lacing remained to show for it. The aroma was slightly sweet, with an unexpected note of berries as well as sweet malt, some rice and a hint of floral hops. The flavors were drier than the aroma suggested but still pleasant enough and appropriate for the style. I tasted biscuity malt, the sweet, berry-like malt and the floral hops at the end. All of these notes were subtle and in general I would describe the beer as understated and yet it was altogether pleasant and in no way offensive, unlike many adjunct Lagers. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation soft. An easy to drink beer that would no doubt be very refreshing on a hot day, as I’m sure it was intended. Furthermore, I think it’s worth noting this was one of the best adjunct Lagers I’ve ever tasted. A gem and an oddity; like that girl I dated in VT with truly tremendous “assets” this specimen proved to be the best kind of novelty."
"This is quite an enjoyable beer and very good for the style. Definitely a thirst quencher perfect for a hot day."
""
"Pours a light gold color with a one finger white head. Average lacing and carbonation. The nose is skunk, grain, and slight malt. Fairly disappointing, even for the style. Taste is actually average for the style. It's not too sweet, got a decent malt background, and is not bad for a AAL. Feel is light, undercarbonated with good malt bill. Overall, a better choice than some others in the style, but I won't seek this out again."

"Notes: Not anything spectacular but if you want a quick beer to drink quick on a hot summer day this will do the job. Cheers."
""
""
"Pours a very light yellow color that is clear with a slight head. Very similar looking to Miller Lite. Scent has some slight grassy tones mixed with wheat. Taste is what you can expect from an adjunct lager. The taste reminds me a lot of Red Stripe and Red Dog. It does however have a little thicker texture and a quite crisp finish. I enjoyed trying a beer from a different country but this was a rather ordinary tasting beer."
""
"12oz bottle. Pours pale yellow with a small short lived white head. Aroma and taste of cereal and grains, light malty notes and light hops bitterness. Light body with soda like carbonation and watery mouth feel. Finish is cereal, grains sweet light bitterness ending with a watery, bland and metalic flavor. Overall not much to say, did not like this. Could not finish drinking this beer. Would not reccomend."
""
"O - Very simple adjunct lager. Not much was expected and this lager proved to be just that. I would not recommend it."
"O-not bad but for $2.99 for a 12oz bottle I think I would rather drink BMC for $0.50 a can and not have the floaties"
"O- It's not worse than many adjunct lagers. But it's not much better either. Wouldn't seek out again."
"O- Not a horrible adjunct lager, but not very good either, certainly not at the price of $2.50 a bottle. I admittedly bought this as a bit of a novelty having never had an African brewed beer and really liking the cap to add to the collection. That being said, this is a one and done for sure."
"Mildly clouded pale straw yellow, very fizzy head like a soft drink, that goes away completely in an instant, no lacing. Smells like a malt with lots of sweet corn adjuncts and strange metallic odors, some earthy-type noble hops (but not very strong) Taste includes more of the annoying metallic presence, some sweet malts completely out of balance with the faint attempt at hopping, mouthfeel is overly watery and not very satisfying at all. I'm probably never going to visit this one ever again, I do not recommend it. Too similar to any other BMC to justify the price."
"I would not move to Africa just to get this, but it is a very drinkable decent brew. Light honey color and sublime hoppiness. Clean rereshing taste but a bit middle of the road; then again the style of pale lager itself is middle of the road! I would drink it again but not go out of my way to do so!"
"It goes down smooth, though, and fast, ideal for a hot day when flavor might take a back seat to refreshment but very average otherwise."
"Pours a clear light yellow with a small 1/2 inch white head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Random broken rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet grain, corn flakes, and slight buttered bread. Taste is of sweet grain, light fruit flavors, and some slight citrus flavors on the finish. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good lager and my first beer ever from Africa. I am impressed with this one to be quite honest."
"T: Pretty similar to the smell. Lots of grain, some butter, corn, yeast and a bit of malt. Not exactly a clean finish. Kind of a lingering, yeasty flavor at the end. Yuck."
"Overall: If I had just climbed Kilimanjaro, I could drink it. Sitting in a comfortable chair in my room - NO!"
"Translucent yellow with no head. Only a small ring around the glass. Light and sweet grainy corn and some hay in the nose. Flavor is crisp and sweet however it is grainy and bland. The finish has a mild amount of carbonation which leaves a tingle on the tongue. No hops are evident. It was descent, nothing exciting. I'd drink it over any macro."
"O: Not a bad beer, again, judging according to the style. Light and refreshing, no off-flavors. Would drink it again if offered, might not seek it out, though. Worth a try."
"3.0 D: Didn't expect much from this and that's what I got. Not as bad as a lot of swill though."
"Poured into a standard water glass in Djibouti. Nice golden straw appearance, clear, and provided some head and mild lacing. Nice skunky aroma like some European or German lagers. Actually flavour was better than expected. Some breadiness, some mild bitterness, and some mild metallic taste. Mouth feel is light to medium bodied, refreshing on a hot summer afternoon in East Africa. Overall a very average lager but would drink again if the situation arises."

"Had a Tusker whilst visitng the Tusker restaurant in the Animal Kingdom of Walt Disney. Tusker Lagar has a clear golden color with decent carbonation which provided a nice white foamy head. The smell and taste are powered by grain, but there is an interesting taste as it comes off the pallete...not sure if that is a malt that they are using or not.. The beer is easy on teh mouth and is best suited to be drank on hot summer days."
"Overall, this is a really refreshing beer, and I can imagine that it's incredibly satisfying on a hot Kenyan afternoon. If this was slightly cheaper, I'd drink it all the time in the summer!"
"Not surprised."
"The pour resulted in a finger of dense, bone-white head with decent retention. Color was a really light yellow, so light that it made me think that I have passed darker urine. NE-plus quality clarity in that I could see into the future with this one. Nose had a very cereal/silage/cooked vegetable scent and I was not terribly surprised. Mouthfeel was medium with an unexpected blandness in the mouth. This was almost like drinking water in terms of its lack of taste. Finish was equally bland and boring. It was not bad, just unimpressive."
"O - Overall, not a bad adjunct lager. While I'm not really a fan of this style at all, I'm glad I got to try an African beer. Wouldn't buy it again though."
"O: Overall, I wasn't entirely impressed- but not turned off. This is actually the first African beer I've ever had, so I'm looking forward to exploring other flavours and styles."
"O - African Coors? Pretty much, albeit a little more interesting, sweet and appealing. Not a great beer, but still a pleasant and refreshing beverage."
"Overall - I found this beer to be very drinkable and better than the average beer in this category. It was a little bit on the pricey side for what it is, but I'd still probably buy it again."
"This poured just like any other lager would, a yellowish gold with a good head at first that faded quickly. The aroma had some hints of citrus to me. Not really sure where that was coming from but it sparked my interest. The taste was basically like most lagers out there. This brew wasn't too bad but it wasn't anything overly special either."
"Not awful, but not amazing. If you have the chance, it's not bad."
"When compared to other beers, it's a mediocre adjunct lager, but not bad for a lighter beer and refreshing. Worth it just to try a beer from Kenya."
"All in all, this isn't a beer to avoid at all costs, but it's nothing to get your hopes up about, either. It's designed, like I said, to appeal to the highest number of people, so a lot of the qualities that could make it stand out are diluted. That said, I'm sure Africa has better beers that I look forward to trying."
"Considering where it is mostly consumed, a perfect brew for hot climates to quench thirst. very light and smooth, therefore very drinkable. Over all a interesting different kind of beer."
"D=The off-taste that I experienced made this very difficult to stick with."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style Pale lager."
"I'm guessing this stuff needs to be sampled fresh and then it would be a passable light lager. but this bottle is awful"
"A bit uneventful - it's rather bland. This probably goes down better in a hot climate where you want something refreshing, but it doesn't do much for me."
"D-okay for the style, the style is just not great. I would drink this beer again if I get it with African food."
"What a pleasant surprise this is. Very clean, crisp and flavorful for the style."
"Overall not bad. This beer seems similar to Spanish style lagers and gets my ""better than Budweiser approval."" Unfortunetly, the price doesn't match up with the taste."
"Kinda cool to say you have drink a beer made in Kenya but its not $2.99 worth of beer, domestic brewery's make way better lagers for a lot cheaper, mainly paying for importing price"
"Taste is very light: starts sharp, dry, and sparkly and ends corn sweet and metallic. Lawnmower drinkable; tempered the spicy sauce that went with the African food I was enjoying. Not surprising in any way. Fine so long as you have appropriate expectations."
"D: This is a beer that I will drink again. It is a good African beer"
"Overall, when we were drinking this brew we kept saying ""apple juice"". It packs a light punch in the flavor department, and the overwhelming carbonation leaves the drinker somewhat burpy and unsatisfied."
" ~ While the American adjuct lager is not by any means one of my top favorite styles I have to say this beer wears on me. With each pull it seems to get a bit better. That being said, its hard to rate the drinkability anything less than good."
"D - For what it is its not all that bad and pretty much fits the style its a decent tasting lager that's refreshing if you haven't had an African beer yet this is one to try"
"12oz bottle date stamped mfg 31 Jan 08 exp 31 Jan 09. Maybe I'm a little late on this bottle? Poured into a tall clear glass - proud puffy multi-finger head. Extremely pale yellow color. Light aroma of hops and barley. Very watery with little carbonation, very simple tasting character - not much flavor or taste, just basic thirst quenching stuff. Very innocuous brew that could probably fit in very well with other TV beers (I'd rather drink Tusker than those any day.) Very simple stuff here - try it for the novelty but not much else."
"Clear light yellow brew is extremely fizzy, tons of carbonation on the glass, a fizzy white head fizzles out in a matter of seconds. Smell is practically nonexistent, just a little adjunct sweetness. Feel has mostly settled down, certainly didn't hold its fizz... it went from explosive to nearly flat in about 3 minutes. Taste is mild adjunct sweetness, maybe a little muddy hop... nothing offensive, but nothing interesting either."
"Surprise present from my dad. I saw that it was a Kenyan lager and I almost didn't even want to try it. Being the ticker that I am, I gave it a shot, and this is exactly why we don't judge a beer by its location...Appearance nothing to note...Aroma is light and sweet, corn, but you'd expect tons of skunk and none is present...The aroma is light and sweet, not at all a typical lager. This isn't a great beer but it exceeds expectations for a lager and a Kenyan beer."
"Beer is thin and clean in the palate. Not much sweetness or anything. no aftertaste, drinkability is fine but its kind of boring."
"Drinkability: with its inoffensive flavor and light body, it's pretty quaffable. Throw in its great aroma and general sessionable-ness, and I find it quite drinkable."
"D: The beer goes down much too easily. This is the perfect lawnmower beer; it's great if you're looking for something very light on a hot summer day that actually has some flavor."
"drinkability: overall quality appears poor, drinking the beer gives little worth noting, would not drink regularly."
"Overall a bad beer. It's balanced but just has a lack of overall quality. NOT recommended."
"Drinkability: No wonder Hemingway drank it for breakfast. Tusker stands out on its own. Damn good lager."
"Overall, very drinkable and refreshing, which is good for a Kenyan beer. However, at $6 a pop poolside in Disney, it will be my last."
"Drinkability> Really. There are worse lagers out there."
"Highly drinkable, smooth, and sweet. easy to chug down and enjoy."
"Comments: A lager that surprised me a little. I did not expect much, but this beer did leave me believing I may have missed something about it. However, in the end a run-of-the-mill lager."
"Pours a very pale golden color with a thin white head that quickly disappears. Aroma of grass and sour apples, I did not like. Light flavor, the taste has a little sweet malt and lemon, and some more of that sour apple. Body is quite thin, typical for a lager. Not completely undrinkable, but not something I'd buy again."
"D: Much better than the big American ones. Not much flavor or anything, but it's not overly sweet and it doesn't have that nasty adjunct aftertaste. Very clean."
"Overall: I am not a big fan of these ""Pale Lagers"" and maybe that' because the only ones I drink are the Macro brews. So if there are some good Pale Lagers out there, then I am just not aware of them. But this beer is a slightly better version that any of the main Macro brews. If you only like macro brews, then you can drink this to make yourself look cultured."
"Smooth and drinkable, but unfortunately, not great tasting. Finding a super-fresh bottle would have to be ideal for this beer."
"It's pretty much Kenya's answer to the macro lager. They've done a better job, however, you pay for that and the whole it's from Kenya thing."
"On the occasion of my 200th review, I've opted for my first African brew. Hailing from the southern portion of the Horn, Tusker looks Droopy-esque, all sad and unappealing with its run-of-the-mill sallow color and foamy white head. Frankly, if I saw an elephant looking like this, I'd be afeared of cathcing some new-fangled Elephant Flu. The high compliments don't end there, as the smell, though intriguing, is generally off-puttingly sour. Now, I'm not tslking gueuze or Flanders red here, but just a subtle, faint funk. The rest of the smell is very ho-hum: rice, corn, wheat, oh my...how boring and AAL of it. Which reminds me: why do so many non-American countries seemingly exclusively brew up AALs? I guess it's efficient and cheap and whatnot, but still... What would be nice would be a new and different take on the AAL, but no, it's all the same old song here, just with a different label from where it's from (the Temps didn't like that version of the song): corn syrup, rice cake, and vague wheat somber the proceedings the way the Big 3 have for decades. A slight tin flavor makes things extra disappointing. Apparently in keeping with tradition, the light body, moderate carbonation, and watery feel are all maintained in accordance with the BMC Neutrality Laws. At least you can just pound it down, right? All the better to get to your next brew."
"Appears clear straw gold with a short white head with lacing. The aroma is light and slightly metallic with a hint of bread and corn. The flavor has a touch of sweet candy, white bread crust, and an mild off-putting tang which, really, is normal for the style. In the summer heat, this would make for a respectable lager to wash down brats and beat the heat."
"D - This one surprised me. I'm not a fan of the American Adjunct style of brewing, but if I did have to drink it, I think I would choose Tusker. This has been a pleasant surprise, from a country that I didn't think would surprise me."
"Drinkability was good, as the beer had no serious negatives. A good lager, but as with most lagers, damned with faint praise."
"Notes: Overall this is your basic pale thin hot weather lager. It was clean, drinkable and well, boring. Anyway I can now say that I have had a beer from the continent of Africa!"
"Tuskers Lager pours a slightly hazy pale yellow with almost no head. The aroma is pale, grainy malt with a bit of sour apple. The flavor is just a bit sweet and malty with more sour apple and a crisp, dry finish. This beer may be past its prime, but there is no way of knowing with no freshness date."
"A pretty standard lager, but not bad if that's what you're looking for."
"It's a clear slightly warm pale yellow colour, with a small foamy white head and moderate carbonation. The aroma is lightly lemon scented with a sweet, almost marshmellow, candyfloss sat behind. The taste is creamy and buttery upfront, not what I was expecting. There is a sweet caramel edge to it with a slight floral hoppy finish. It's an interesting taste but I really like it. Well worth a try."
"D: The sweet honey flavor of the malts make this a very drinkable and refreshing beer; I can see myself having this with Ethiopian food."
"This kenyan brew poured up a pale yellow color with a nice frothy white head. Good retentive lacing on my glassy poo. The aroma was pretty plain jane, sweet corn malts. The taste was also sweet corn malts, a lil bitter hop finish lingering on my black tongue. Pretty full bodied brew with moderate carbo. If I lived in an African desert, this beer would be bomb. But thank God I live in America where I can fart away my whole day and drink waaay better beers. Not shabby tho...."
"I learned a big lesson in not making assumptions as to where a beer is brewed. I will definitely try beers from other places that you don't think of typically for their beers."
"Not too bad, probably would be quite good in the summer. A bit thin, nothing too exciting about it, but it did the trick and wasn't offensive."
"Golden yellow with a white bubbly head. Metalic canned vegetable skunk smell. Not great. Clean dry grainy taste. A fair amoutnt of bitterness with light carbonation. Not much from the malts. More of a hard metalic grain than anything. Some skunk in the aftertaste that reminded me of Red Stripe. Light crisp bubbly mouthfeel. I wouldn't recomend going out of your way for this. Not the worst thing ever, but the flavors just aren't very good. This would probably be one that grows on you. I'm sure the fifth one would be much better than the first."
"Drinkablity: Much better than expected. A good brew from a far away land. I never expected to try a beer from Kenya."
"D: A good lager for what it is; I remember drinking this under the shadow of Mt. Kilimanjaro--it quenched by thirst in the hot equitorial sun then and it does the same today."
"a good lager when all is said and done, not what I expect from Kenya"
"This beer is bland and boring but better than most macro lagers. It's a dull yelllow beer, clear as a bell, with a thin white, dissipating head. My new SN Hop Tulip is actually keeping some head on the beer. The aroma is sweet and simple but without any real fault. The flavor is a lemony sugar malt. It's a quite refreshing beer. I'd certainly be happier with this beer than most in the style."
"Pours light clear gold with a big white head. Aroma is cereal, sweet breads, corn. Very muted. Flavor is mainly corny sweetness with pilsener-ish grains, some hay and zero hops. Sticky and not refreshing. About what I was expecting from a Kenya pale lager..."
"really tastes like a beer you don't even notice you're drinking. not necessarily what i usually look for in a beer, but I have to admit, it'd be easy to drink back these babies all night."
"Fairly easy drinking, but too bland to provide more than a refreshing palate cleanser."
"Sweet and slick, the diacetyl is somewhat overbearing here. Buttery with a smattering of cooked vegetables and frozen white corn. Almost crisp, but the buttery slickness really impairs both the flavor and texture. Finishes sweet, grainy, corny. This is actually quite bad."
"A barely decent enough tipple for the style, as transposed across a few continents and an ocean or so, meaning that being an interesting thing to try from East Africa trumps overtly rejecting it as the same shit produced in the 'western world'. I don't know where to justify that particular piece of commercial and geo-political bullshit, but I'm not about to grab another of these, all the same."
"as our Native African friends conquer the world, their brew (and other food items) seem to follow them .... honestly, I am not an enthousiast of African cuisine (actually one of the 3 most horrible culinary experience was in a Nigerian restaurant in London), and as a fact I will neither become an enthousiast of African brews ... this one smells and tastes rather odd: grenadine paired with motor oil and valerian ... at least the label is quite interesting"
"Tusker does not have the flavour and character of many other beers of different styles, but it is an OK lager, particularly compared to the domestic macrobrews. It is not something to rave over, but it is OK. It is a nice beer to drink very cold on a hot day."
"Had at the Demera Ethiopian Restaurant in Chicago. Fortunately, I didn't get any of the skunkiness referred to in other reviews, and found this to be a pleasant, drinkable beer, clean and crisp, and very user-friendly. Don't know what this retails for, but it was $6 for the 12-ounce bottle at the restaurant, and this accompanied the tasty food nicely."
"So, the blandness continues in the taste. Is it Bud, is it Miller? It could be. Thin bodied and highly carbonated. Where's the hop? The brewer must have waved it over the kettle without letting fall in. If you like corn in your beer, this should serve you well."
"Drinlability - we've got a winner here! This satisfies very well when you're thirsty and you could pound a few litres of this away without getting messy. I would go for this whenever convenient to do so. Recommended."
"Poured from bottle into an ale glass (I know). Transparent golden yellow beer with a short lived finer of foam. Good clean taste is above average for an american style lager. Nice mouthfeel with slight residual carbonation. Above average drinkability."
"Drinkability is great. I'm really kicking myself for not getting a 6 pack of this, especially when I though to myself..this is gona suck. Awesome light beer, give it a try, fantastic with salad."
"D- Decent beer for an adjunct lager. Good session beer and one that I would drink again"
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a rich, gold color with 1 inch head. There is a light, sweet aroma. Taste is very flavorfull. Starts a little grainy and finishes sweet. Medium bodied in the mouth. This beer is very drinkable and quite delicious. I really enjoyed this beer."
"I had this beer last night and didn't write down any of the finer points of the beer for a sophisticated review, and that was because there really wasn't much to record and there were no real qualities that jumped out. This is an adjunct lager, with a slightly drying salty finish, there was plenty of cooked veggie, musty lager aromas and tastes. This was entirely mediocre beer that I didn't finish"
"D: I could drink this all day long but I really wouldn't want to."
"An okay lager. It's actually somewhat enjoyable and I'd certainly except one in Kenya, or actually several places. A little too much of the vegetable flavor in this one, although it's barely there. Good, but plenty room for improvement."
"12 ounce bottle, Mfg, 6/16/2008, best by 6/16/2009. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with about an inch white head. Head retention is good, not much lacing. Carbonation bubbles up from the bottom of the glass to the top for a while after it's first poured. It smells like sweet malt and a bit of corn. No offensive aromas at all. It tastes like sweet malt, grain, and bit of grassy hops. It's mostly sweet tasting. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's thin but not watery. Drinkability is good, it is pretty easy to drink. For the style, it's not bad at all, I'd rather drink this than most macro brews. Not that I'd make a point to seek this out, but it's a good alternative if you don't want to drink any BMC brews."
"D: Just fine for drinking as a food accompaniment, but not a beer I have to return to by itself. This was a gamble - a try-worthy beer from a foreign land; as such it was decent enough but not one worth seeking out."
"Wouldn't refuse if offered, but won't seek out either."
"Another example of an 'American Adjunct Lager' done better by non-Americans. 'Named after George Hurst a co-founder of Kenya Breweries Ltd, who was killed by an elephant during a hunting expedition in 1923.'"
"D - Very.... Easy"
"Light in body and decently carbonated. Refreshing thirst quencher, but that is all. I can see where this would be a choice in 120 degree heat. Overall, not horrific, and no real off-weird flavors -- just not alot going on either. Cool to try, but not worth seeking."
"It was a dull yellow in color with a thick foamy head and average lace. Malt scent to it. Very dry taste to it. Not bad at all, but doesn't really do anything for me, either."
"A very light golden color with a white one finger head of relatively thin foam. Beer was fairly carbonated. Aroma was light: grass and a hint of hops if you strained hard enough. Taste was thin, watery and carbonated, a hint of biting hops. I'd say slightly better than a normal macro...."
"D: I hope to try more beers from the African continent. I am certain there are better beers than this for the people to enjoy."
"Drinkability: very light and boring beer. Easy to quaff but you'll tire of this one quickly."
"D - I guess this is pretty drinkable. I could probably drink a whole case, although I don't know why I would. Maybe good for a hot summer day. Not a good beer by any stretch."
"1.3/5"
"First African beer I've ever tried. Pours clear gold with an average white head. Pale malt and mineral water aroma. Thin, but has a pleasant light and sweet taste. Really good on a hot day, no real shock as it is from Kenya. Not going to get again, but worth trying."
"Drinkability is on par with any macro lager. Slightly more crisp than Miller High Life. Next time I'll look for a bottled on date."
"D - If this is what Africa has to offer as a ""Premium Quality Lager"" I'll import my own if I visit."
"Found this at my favorite sofa bar and loved it! It pours well with a good amount of head. This Kenyan lager blows most American Lagers away! It is crisp, and refreshing everything a Lager should be! If you see this one in your local beer store give it a shot!"
"As it's made in Kenya I hope it will make me a faster marathoner."
"I was drawn to this beer mostly, because I wanted to try an African-style beverage, but my hopes for this beer were quickly dashed. This beer is rather metallic in taste and has an overall sloppy feeling on the palate. This is definitely a beer that you can cross off your list, but probably not worth going back for."
"Ordered a bottle of this at a restaurant. I poured the bottle into a pint glass. No head to speak of and no lacing. The color is very light. Sitting next to my glass of water, I could barely tell the difference between the two. The aroma is subdued to say the least. There is a slight hint of hops and malt and I really had to take a few deep sniffs to register the aroma. The taste is much the same...very mild on hops and grain, with a bit of a funky aftertaste. The mouthfeel is dry and bubbly. Overall, a rather underwhelming beer that barely registered on my senses. I think the bottle with the elephant logo was the coolest part of this beer."
"Pours very clear pale yellow with small head. Smell is not very strong, grassy and sweet malts. Pretty normal lager smell. Clean taste, average sweetness. Very crisp and light, pretty pleasant. Very drinkable. Very refreshing. Good lager, I'm glad I tryed it and would have it again."
"Overall a very good lager. Very crisp and easy to drink with a decent flavor."
"Give it a whirl. It probably won't rock your world, but it's a decent lager that is quite drinkable and should go well with food, even if it's a bit forgetable."
"Not much in the way of flavor, but it is highly drinkable...particularly in a hot-weather climate."
"got from the LS ... pours with a great big healthy head ... lacing is quite supreme, good start here ... has some corn and a hop smell similar to saaz ... some sweetness in the chewer ... is a very refreshing lager beer, also has a low to medium crispness ... not bad stuff, i can see drinking this in Nairobi..."
"I picked is up at Disney's Aninal Kingdom."
"D: Not very flavorful, but goes down ok, not filling at all, mild kick, it's a typical beer for the style but not one that I'd want to drink again if I had too many other choices."
"D: A decent, smooth and sweet drink that was easy to put down, but may be limited in quantities due to its high sweet character. As a single, moderately enjoyable."
"Pale Lager I guess! A very pale, clear looking golden color. A pretty good sized head that did fizzle away pretty quickly but left some on top. The aroma is grassy, grainy, floral and a little fruity and not bad. This however isn't a very good tasting beer. First of all the mouthfeel is thin and watery leaving me wanting a lot more. The flavor consists of mild hops but more grainy and grassy and an all around typical mass marketed below average lager taste. Except it wasn't that cheap. I bought a single at a local store and compare to the other prices/quality they had this was a horrible deal. I think I may at least get to cross off another country. I'll pound one if someone gives it to me but I won't be buying this again."
"Reminds me of Red Stripe with the heavy ""sweet buttered corn"" flavor, but not as good."
"Best by date of Jan '09. Pours a crystal clear straw yellow color with a nice amount white foam that slowly recedes leaving behind little lacing. Smell is of some sweet malt and not much else. Taste is surprisingly refreshing and quite nice for this style. It's simple, yet good. Some lightly toasted malt, small amount of spiciness, tiny notes of fruitiness, and a very light hop character. Slightly sweet up front, dry on the finish, crisp, and decent carbonation. Easily drinkable, and a great session macro-style lager. An all around nice beer, and my first from Africa. I'd take this over any BMC AML any day."
"Easy to drink and a step up from many macro lagers. Worth a try."
"D: An excellent, drinkable, refreshing beer. Cheers."
"I surely hope that not all African beers taste like this one? It was just a cheap watery beer with a small taste of malted grains. That's all folks for this beer. If you find $2 on the street and you want to buy a beer with it, then you might want to buy it."
"Would buy again."
"Not bad..."
"The exotic nature of this brew (from AFRICA!) is tough to not be excited over... still, responsible scrutiny must be adhered to... predominantly transparent, straw yellow body with discernable carbonation... snow white head settles softly to a quarter-inch haze--yup, it's a lager... malty, yes, but much more flowery than expected--almost fruity to a malt-softening level (promising)... thin, almost watery in the throat--a Miller Lite experiencewith added carbohydrates and carbonation--I'm going to burp out an elephant... mellow and toothless (ur, tuskless), thin in taste and presence... lagers named Tusker should STOMP--this one slithers...a seltzery finish cinches it: I'm not going to enjoy this unless I have a six of it IN KENYA!"
"Poured a clear, light yellow color with a pleasant, bubbly white head. Smell was fairly average and mild: some grainy malts and a little grassy hops. The taste had malts up front that were kind of bready, plus hops that were a little earthy and tangy, leaving a light zing at the end. A tad watery, a dry finish, but the taste was what a light macro lager should be: crisp and freshing."
"M & D: Light bodied with strong carbonation. The sensation on the palate is a little thin. Very drinkable, but there's not much complexity here to entice me to drink more than one or two. This beer definitely has two things going for it though - it's damn refreshing and not offensive in the least. I guess I was just hoping for a little more flavor and aroma."
"D: For the style quite good, a step up in flavour and quality than your average light lager."
"I've yet to travel to Kenya but I'd imagine that under a humid East Africa sun this may be exactly the kind of beer you'd hope to see in front of you. Even still, I've had Tusker Finest Quality Lager on many occasions over the years and, even from the confines of my suburban Canadian dwellings, never once thought it a bad beer. In fact, its consistency and quality are exemplary - I'd take this over most any domestic commercial lager."
"Drinkability is great and the crsip refreshment is very nice for a warm weather beer."
"This pours an extreme pale gold,so pale I'm not sure I""ve ever seen one so light in color,the head looks nice and bleach white,with lots of lace left behind.The nose is strange to me like chlorine or somthing so clean It almost has no smell.This tastes like raw uncooked spagetti noodles,with some grassy grainy flavors on the tail.It's light in body and semi creamy even,finishing extremly crisp and clean.Not bad at all,refreshing,easy drinker."
"Taste was along the same lines but underwhelming. The hop character was herbal and did keep it from being completely boring. A decent beer, but why pay more for something so mediocre."
"D: While this is one of the better examples of a macro-brewed beer, it still isn't all that great. Not without its good qualities, though."
"I remember I couldn't keep this beer on the shelf at Total Wine when I worked there. I enjoyed this beer a lot myself. Had it chilled in a pint glass. Poured a thick gold color. The smell was of creamy caramel. The taste was the same and I love that taste in general. A very drinkable beer for me because I can't get enough of the caramel taste. I could see enjoying this deep in the jungle on a safari. Good times."
"Foamy head.Not too bad to have on occasion. Not a beer that grows on you quickly."
"D- Think- water, but with carbonation."
"D: This is why I love this beer. Super drinkable and halfway decent taste."
"D: A one. This beer is different than any other macro lager that I've had. Refreshing and Fresh. My first African beer and a yummy first at that."
"D - This basic but tasty lager went well with some big sausages and turkey dogs. Nothing special going on here, but it's a very respectable if a bit basic lager. If this is classified as an American Macro, then it's probably about the best AML that I've ever had."
"Pours a typical straw-yellow, but the head is nice and thick and sticks around for a bit. Aroma is crisp and malty, rather typical of a lager except there is a fruity hint. Flavor is malty, about average for a lager, but better than the typical mega-brew lager. It feels a little thin and watery, but is still pleasant to drink."
"D- Easy going down. This one drank a little better than a typical american macro lager. Still, I wouldnt seek this one out, but wouldnt turn it down either."
"My first beer from Africa. Pours a crystal clear pale golden straw color with a big foamy head. Some malt character in the nose and perhaps some grassy notes. The palate is light and dry. Malt and breadiness on the palate balanced by some hop bitterness. The finish is dry and quick. Not too bad, if only it were hot and sunny day."
"If I had reviewed this beer in Africa, the score would have been a lot higher. Sadly in the cold light of an English day, it didn't come up to muster."
"D-Very smooth. It reminds me of what a good light beer could taste like."
"this beer pours a yellow color and quite clear with decent head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves very little lacing. the smell is quite average as i can't pick up many characteristics in it. the taste is consistent with a macro lager. the mouthfeel is a bit thin. i did manage to drink quite a few of these pretty easily. i'm glad i tried it, but i would not seek it out."
"Drinkability: Nothing special here. Avoid in favor of some richer, more robust beers."
"This is an exception to my rule that brew is best closer to home. The only reason (I believe) that Tusker has become so popular is because there are so many tourists in Kenya and it is a novelty to drink an African beer with that oh-so-African elephant on the label. This one is basically plain old beer and is a VERY far cry from the Malt Lager by Tusker, which I think is supremely better and shows more attention to craft. All of this brews qualities are the standard mass produced ones. The end."
"Brilliantly clear straw color under a tall foamy white head that leaves some patchy lace dripping down the sides. Doughy sweet pale malt aroma with clean fruity honey notes...almost pilsener-like in character. Clean, sweet grainy flavor follows the nose. There is a ""papery"" taste that cheapens the experience considerably. The body is light but not watery...smooth with a dry finish. Extremely easy to consume and probably quite refreshing on a hot African day. Not bad for what it is."
"I'm always a sucker for these brews from countries that have no brewing tradition. What you get is generally this sort of beer -- boring American macro."
"The beer exits the 12-ounce bottle a light gold color with a creamy white head that crowns the body, as it erodes; the lace forms a thin sheet upon the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, almost maple syrup; crisp and clean, start has a fair malt presence, thin at the top, which was expected. Finish has a pedestrian acidity, the hops mild but present, dry aftertaste, a fair to middling beer, a product of its environment, certainly better than many beers from such countries."
"The taste is standard import macro lager that could of come from anywhere. A little malt is detectable in an otherwise adjunct heavy beer. Very watery but it would be refreshing on a hot day."
" Overall I tried it because it was unique compared to what else was there, however it was really not that special at all. I am glad I chose it over the BMC making up the majority of the rest of the choices however it was of the same vain. I suppose you could do much worse in a selection; however this was really not that great. I would have it again if it was ice cold and I was thirsty and did not have to pay for it, but either then that I will find one from somewhere else."
"Drinkability: Another okay, but odd African lager!"
"drinking. Price is nice. A good beer to have on a hot day."
"A highly drinkable lager with a crisp and balanced taste. Well done."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer had a small thin head that was gone like right now. The beer was very light pale looking and smelled like some weird flowers or something. The taste was very yeasty to me and just not very good. I will not be purchasing this beer again."
"I tried this beer on September 13, 2007 at 'Smokeless Joe' in Toronto. The beer poured a translucent gold with a thin white head. The aroma was grainy with a hint of malt and some yeast. The mouthfeel was thin with high carbonation. The taste was grassy as with a lot of macro style lagers"
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is one inch in height, white in color, and recedes quickly into sparce lacing. The aroma is of faint caramel, and corn bread. The taste is like the aroma. The mouthfeel is light bodied with annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, this is one of the better marco lagers I have had."
"Alcohol was 4.2% with an Exp date of Feb. 08. Light straw / yellow shade of clear. A frothy white head on pouring but it settled quickly. Some decent lacing looked promising. Gentle carbonation. Mild grass or daisies on the nose, very feint, almost unnoticeable. Taste has a hint of hops but then a bit sweet on the finish. Bitterness is fleeting. Mouthfeel started out smooth but turned a bit syrupy, very light body. This beer is pleasant enough but not a taste sensation by a long shot, a bit boring; did not live up to its label. Then again, it might be a crossover beer for macro drinkers in north america who want to pretend they're on safari."
"Tasted thin, but had a slight trace of hips and a pleasant mouthfeel. Certainly no strong taste to write home about, and resembled a slightly more malty macrobrew that you might get here."
"This is Kenya's attempt at the american (ie Budweiser) lager. The beer pours a nice golden color with a large head. The head disappates quickly but a lace remains for the entire glass. The malty taste was a little dry which sticks in your mouth after you swallow. Leaves the tongue dry and slightly metallic. A dry lager, not undrinkable but could use some work."
"This fails entirely on its relatively simple premises."
"Drinkability- It was okay. I don't know why but I expected a little bit more from it."
"D- pretty high, a solid picnic beer or something for summery days, clean smooth, but nothing spectacular"
"Drinkability was very good. I don't care for lagers, in general, but ordered a second because it was so smooth."
"Tusker Premium Lager pours a golden yellow with a thin white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is sweet and grainy. I can taste a fair amount of malt and lots of grain, there's not much more to it. Very light bodied. This is a decent enough lager, worth a try."
"An all around good lager. The perfect lawnmower beer ... and it's made in Kenya."
"Certainly a decent enough lager and one I'd have on safari in Africa or my backyard."
"Though nothing to get excited over, the beer has some freshness and crispness that cary it a long way. Pours a vivid straw color with airy head retention, for about a minute. Aromas of green apples, pilsner malts, and earthy hops seem well balanced. The flavors of apples, pears, light malt, and fresh hops spice things up a bit, but never interfere with the fresh yeast / hop character. The body is lighter than the flavors, but never seem watery. Finihses wiht a minty snap and a crisp dryness. The beer is put together well, but lacks the character to raise far above average."
"D - I wasn't overly impressed. It looked better than it smelled or tasted. There just was much in terms of flavor."
"This is a good example of the style. Light yellow in color with a white head. The smell is somewhat sweet and grainy. The taste is smooth with no negative bite. There is hints of vanilla and just a touch of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth. Not a chore to drink. One of the better macro style beers I have had. A much better choice than some others. I could easily session this beer, although the price would kindly limit that. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle."
"335 ml. bottle- color of bight yellow, with a thin white small bubbled head  light sweet nose of corn , perfume , melon , straw, and hits of detergent  taste of cantaloupe , slight straw , and light bitterness body is watery , dry , and lightly carbonated  aftertaste of , sweet corn , soapy , and rotten melon"
"Poured into a pint glass from the bottle. 1/2 inch head with a vigorous pour that settles quickly into a thin layer of tiny bubbles. Malty smell with skunky hops throughout. Relatively active carbonation rising through the pale, yet saturated hue of yellow. The first sip was actually better than I had expected. Big malty flavor and a slightly thick and creamy mouthfeel. The aftertaste has a little tinge to it, but overall I thought this beer was way better than most American/Canadian macro lagers."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear pale amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight skunky nose. Starts sweet, hops are hidden, not an American lager, sweet corn finish, would make a good lawn mower beer. $1.95 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"I first tried this beer many years ago when a Fraternity brother was sent to Somalia in the early '90's and he returned with large bottles of Tusker. I found a 12 oz. bottle recently and thought I would test it against my more complex palate some 10 years later. I found this to be a good middle of the road macro lager. Really nothing more or less. It accomplishes what it sets out to do. It could be mistaken for any of a hundred other beers. But if one finds themselves in the bush of the Serengeti it would more than quench your thirst."
"Kenya's version of Bud...not a bad impression...but nothing more, either."
"a grassy astringency early quickly leaves as there is little to no aftertaste. consistant for the style but WAY overpriced. A little hops can be detected....early...underwhelming but probobly a touch better in taste and distinction than most massprolag's Bought on a recommendation....but I cannot give the same recommendation because this is overpriced and only slighty above average. warsteiner meets budweiser. perhaps the most overpriced beer of all time!"
"This lager pours a nice clear birght yellow with a massive head that lefts it's mark as it was consumed. Fruity/Floral sweet smell with a little vienna malt aroma (probably not vienna but that is what it smells like). Heavier on the tongue that most lagers with a nice malt character to it. The hops are very well balanced with plenty of malt to back it up. A clean and tangy taste with a kind of dry aftertaste. A good example of the lager style."
"Kenya is much better known for their long distance runners than for their beer, and Tusker beer illustrates why. Maybe they run a long way to get better beer."
"Drinks semi-okay. More malt please! I'd take this over a BMC any time. Love to get a sem--fresh bottle of this"
"D= you could probably go all night on this if you were so inclined."
"Drawback? Im not paying $2 a 12oz bottle for lawnmower brew."
"I was reintroduced to this beer at Nyala resturaunt in Los Angeles, the first time I drank Tusker was in Kenya while in the Marine Corps. From what I remember this was a great tasting thrist quenching beer. It was poured into a chilled beer mug, the appearance was a yellowish gold, the nose was malty and wet metal. The taste is malt with slightly sweet notes, with the food mug and memories, this is a drinkable beer with a decent flavor."
"A little white in another pale lager. Passable aroma. Light mouthfeel even a tad grainy rather than creamy and little taste. Macro type ale.A tad metallic mid-sip. Can drink it if thirsty.Fresh.More malty than bitter.Suitably carbonated. Passable overall rather than a standard macro."
"Somewhat watery, but clean and refreshing. Not bad, I've had worse, but not exciting either."
"Overall-I really hope Bill Clinton has better taste in beer than this. Perhaps I had a bad batch but I am not going to be buying it anytime soon to find out. Everyone who had one at the party just thought it was gross."
"Presentation: Sample reviewed was a 500 ml short brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown. The legend ""BEER ONLY"" is molded into the bottle; I could not agree more with this sentiment. Tusker was formerly packaged in a 12 oz green glass long neck bottle, this package is a significant improvement. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Pours a pale straw color with a decent head and heavy carbonation. Nothing really special about this, just a highly drinkable beer that went down almost too quickly. Almost as good as Chechvar, but with the carbonation of a San Miguel. A good choice for a session beer."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a slightly raspy finish. Medium body. I'm glad I tried it but I probably wont have it again."
"Overall: KenYa beer?!? Nah! More of a KeenNO beer  this is a I am not so Keen on this beer actually. I always wanted to give it a whirl though, well thats my curiosity well and truly put down, I have no plans to head out to Kenya thats for sure."
"Give it a shot!"
"This poured from the bottle a very average yellow with a slight ring of head at the top of the glass. A grassy smell makes it's way to the nose in this one, not too bad. Flavor is slightly sweet, very subtle in the hops and malt, with a very clean finish. This is one of the more easy drinking and refreshing brews i've had, Overall, not bad."
"For as much as this beer cost I was expecting a lot more. I've been disappointed by imports in the past but heard good things about this beer. For the style its not horrible but if I'm going to drink a bland macro lager, I'll stick with a U.S. product like Rolling Rock, Iron City, Straub, or Yuengling Premium. It was however my first African beer, most likely not the last."
"Review when called to but first you must drink beer."
"Wow. What a lot of nothing. The aroma totally lies to you. I was expecting atleast some grassy hops on the palate, but nothing. Goes down like nothing, so drinkability should be good, but who'd want to drink another one of these?"
"taste and mouthfeel are fairly light and thin. starts off with a hint of bitterness but the finish again has a slight honey flavor. comes off as sweeter but more balanced than most other mass-produced lagers, and is very drinkable, if uninteresting."
"IMO - it's not awful - there are worse out there - but nothing about it would have me buy it again."
"This is a sticky sweet lager with flavors of grain covered up by sugar and has what seems to be a subdued sugary fruit aftertaste -- something like a fruit roll up. Nothing offensive about the taste, and it's actually quite addicting. Considering the low abv I would have expected this to be very thin, but the sugar seems to beef it up a bit. This is unexpectedly balanced, and I would place it somewhere in the malt liquor category. Somehow I could see this coming in a 40."
"Everything was going good until the taste. If you're looking for a top quality macro, this isn't it. Do yourself a favour, and get a Red Stripe."
"There was a respectable head on the beer while I was pouring it but it shrunk way down. The nose and taste has grains and a weak grassy hop aroma. There's nothing spectacularly exciting about this lager, but it's head and shoulders above BMC and things like Heineken. The most impressive thing is how well this 4.2% abv beer holds up in transit across the world. Everybody seems to forget (myself included) that drinkability should factor in whether you want to drink or buy the beer again. Sure it's easy to drink and mighty refreshing, but I don't plan on spending $2.99 for another one of these anytime soon."
"D - Not too bad at all. Can't say it's flavourful, but within the style, it's really quite good."
"Better than I was expecting, this is an uncomplex but refreshing lager."
" Fun to drink as far as being sessionable but not an exceptional beer on any real scale. Guess I drank a little more then I thought it in England.."
"I hope it doesn't give me a headache."
"After reading the reviews I was kinda scared of this one but I persevered - Poured from 500 ml bottle into a pilsner glass - Color a clear gold with tight bubbles - Taste was full and clean and refreshing - Maybe the American Macro Lagers should be called African Macro Lagers"
"Medium yellow with a bit of chill haze. Bright white head that recedes to a thick collar with some lacing evident. Malty aroma with floral and fruity hops, maybe a bit of honey sweetness as well. Clean flavour with lightly fruity malt sweetness and delicate floral hops. Bitterness appears towards the end and contributes to a slightly drying finish. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Not bad at all. I kind of like it."
"D- This beer was very light and didn't have much character to it. For the style it did have some faint notes of kolsch beers and it would have been nice to pull those out. If I had to drink this style it would probably be this beer."
"Bright clean straw to pale yellow colored beer. Has a big foamy white head and good lace. Kinda a sweet honey character up front with a sweet grassy note following. There is a light sweet malty character at the start of the taste with a little nibble of hop bite on the finish which carries with it a hint of honey. Easy drinking and not bad tasting."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, light and refreshing. Goes down like water becuase it's about the same consistency. Carbonation is nice and not overly excited. Drinkability is good here. I could easily session this brew and maybe I would one day if I travel to Kenya. Obviously, living in the US there are many other beers I'd choose first...but this suprised me for an import lager."
"This is quite drinkable, and has a cool looking 500 mL bottle -- with an ELEPHANT on it. Not great, but worth trying."
"This brew doesn't offer that much (even ice-cold) but it doesn't include anything unexpected either. Glad I tried it...on to something else."
"Maybe not great without the authentic atmosphere."
"If you're going to mow your lawn, and you can buy this beer for $1 like I did, then you might as well chug a Tusker after you are done mowing. It will blend right in with all the other aromas and tastes in your mouth."
"overall- really not a bad beer. MUCH better then other macros such as bud/miller and the like. went great with the burger with the first bottle. very refreshing and the taste seems to grow on you the more you drink. worth a taste in my book."
"If I was in Kenya I wouldnt go thirsty by not drinking it but not one I would try again"
"500ml bottle: Poured a very pale yellow color lager with nice foamy with head with better retention then expected. Aroma of malt and hops are very faint and almost non-existent. Taste is refreshing with some malt and very little hops. The surprising thing about this one is that it is not skunk even though is traveled 5000 miles in a light brown bottle."
"The TUSKER I tried was the one brewed in TANZANIA! Beer drinkers say that it is better than the Kenyan original. It is a light beer with only 4.2% alc. good for a hot day in DAR. Taste and aroma are neutral. Good for thirst quenching but not for pleasure."
"Overall I thought it was drinkable but barely. If your having a BBQ or laying around in the hammock or something this is decent. I like lager's too so it had nothing to do with the style."
"it does the job it is supposed to do. this isnt for a heavy beer geek night, maybe for a summer night at the grill hockin' down steamers and other light fare. session beer ahoy..."
"Drinkability - Plenty light enough to drink without thinking. But nothing to go chasing after. Flavor is plain to slightly better than plain adjunct. But hey, it's from Kenya and its got a friggin elephant on the label (extra 1/2 point in the drinkability column for hippnes). Bia Yangu Nehi Yangu (Kenyan for : try it once if you like to try a large number of beers because it is ok, but nothing unusual or extraordinary)."
"I would drink this one again in hot weather. Solid macro lager."
"500 ml brown bottle, best before date clipped into label (same bottle as picture). Pours a bright yellow color with a fluffy 1 inch white head. The foam quickly shrank to a thin ring aroound the edge of the glass. Didn't leave any lacing. Smell was very mild and weak. The taste has some slight grains, some sweetness and a touch of hopat the end. Full carbonation leaves a tingling bite on the tongue, with enough dryness to erase any aftertaste. Clean finish. At only 4.2% it could be a better than average light beer. I thought a bit overpriced, but I guess it is an import."
"500 ml bottle. This beer is almost completely clear. There is just a shade of yellow. The head is big, white, and fizzy. The aroma is a grainy. It's the smell you often get walking into a brewery. The flavor is bland, but inoffensive. Just a bit of maltiness, but otherwise this is seltzer water. No bitterness. Maybe a hint of hop flavor. This beer is pretty refreshing, so it gets a high drinkability rating. As a light beer, this is pretty solid, but don't go out of your way for it."
"A solid beer, if not overly impressive. Would probably pick it over many of the standard macro lagers. Besides, how often do you find Kenyan beer?"
"My first and only African beer I have tried went in with low expectations and well it was pretty average.Pours a clear straw yellow with a decent head but it is gone in a flash,light iron aromas with some toasted grain but not much to it but it didnt offend me so ok.Taste is light just to watered down there is some graininess but just not enough going on.I could see this beer being chugged in the Kenya heat maybe even the NC heat but no other time,I'll pass again."
"This lager poured a clear, golden color with white foam that settled but clung a bit and left a little lacing. There was a steady bubbling from the bottom of the glass. The smell was very minimal, but improved as the beer warmed to room temperature: a very light biscuity malt aroma. The taste was lightly malty (biscuit) with a light floral hop flavor and very, very light hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with medium body and low carbonation feel. It was relatively clean with a trace of sweetness. This was a decent lager, surprisingly easy to drink."
"Crystal clear lager, pale gold, with a big-bubbled foamy head that didn't last a minute. Buttered corn smell overpowers any grassiness. Honestly, this tasted about like most macros. A solid adjunct lager. The mouthfeel was slightly lighter than I expected, as if water had somehow separated from the beer and remained on the tongue. Unless it is skunked or warm, most adjuncts are relatively easy drinkers. I'll get some of these and have folks over to watch ""Hatari!"" and ""The Snows of Kilimanjaro"". I heard someone say that Hemingway liked this stuff, so it's only fitting. Bia Y Angu Nchi Yangu -- ""My Beer My Country"""
"The body is very, very light. Neal was right: This is a good lawnmower beer. It is superior to the mainstream American lagers and good for drinking on a hot summer day. Coming from Kenya, I see why this beer is the way it is."
"When poured into a glass (the only way I've ever enjoyed a Tusker...most beer is better this way), Tusker offers an abundant head that leaves a noticeable lacing. Mouthfeel is excellent, with a subtle carbonation that almost tickles the tongue, rather than overpower the beer."
"Nice and refreshing. A beer I enjoy in a style I generally don't enjoy. I'll defintely buy more of this."
"On a pairing note, pairs well with mild, buttery foods like juicy roast chicken or buttery potatoes."
"Drinkability- This one did the trick. It both quenched my thirst and tasted good at the same time. Recommended"
"It pours a pale gold with a foamy collar that leaves lots of lace trails behind. The aroma is very weak with some limpid malt sweetness. The taste is of wet cardboard, grain husks, and stale white bread. The mouthfeel is very watery and theres virtually no hop bitterness. Carbonation is less fizzy than other adjunct lagers. This is an average lager, its definitely more flavorful that Labatt Blue or Bud, but not as flavorful as Becks or Grolsch."
"Poured a pale yellow with a white head that laced well. Smell had a lot of cooked vegetable smell, and a bit of hops. Taste wasn't too bad, not overly carbonated like many Adjunct Lagers. Quite a good amount of hops, and good clean finish. Light mouthfeel and was quite drinkable for an Adjunct Lager, but certainly not something I would go out of my way for. Perhaps if I am ever in Kenya, and this is on tap, I'd appreciate it more."
"I still wouldn't pick Tusker Premium Lager unless nothing else good was available, but for a macro lager it's tough to beat. A pleasant surprise from Kenya."
"Pours a pale yellow color with a cream white ivory head that resembles the elephant tusks on the bottle. The smell is of honey/grain and subtle dough, a nice lemon zest refreshes the nose, the tate is clean and refreshing, a nice citrus upfront leads to the honey smooth taste. Better than I expected, good beer for watching the ball games."
"Pours a pale yellow with a good deal of carbonation and a decent white head. Lace is minimal to the bottom of the glass. The aroma is kind of grassy or straw-like. The taste is much the same, kind of grassy with a small afterbite that you can taste on the roof of the mouth. This is not a bad beer, but more average than anything."
"Bought 2 500ml bottles the other day and drank them on two distinct evenings. I was actually able to detect the subtle flavors better in the second bottle. The beer pours very very pale yellow (almost clear towards the bottom of the glass). Decent head, moderate density. Though it has the same color as many macros, none of the metallic macro smell. In fact, there is little smell at all outside mild honey. Subtle herb flavor, plus a decent undertone of honey. Definitely a refreshing beer - perfect for the deserts of Kenya (country of origin). Good mouthfeel and drinkability - a refreshing drink but you have to search to find its distinctive qualities."
"Enjoyable, if not exceptional, this Kenyan is crisp and refreshing. Goes down easy, and is a nice thirst quencher. Worth a try."
"Nevertheless it is an easy-to-drink beer, but since it lacks personality and body I wouldn't recommend it."
"I realize that 90% of national beers are going to be pale lagers. I have to say that this is amongst the better ones I've had in that national pale lager category. Not that this is something I'd rush out to find, but the Kenyans should be proud of a better-than-average national beer."
"Drinkable, EXTREMELY well suited to eating wild game dishes like Antelope."
"Good African lager. One thing about Africa, they have a love affair with lagers. This beer poured a faint, standard yellow. Sort of what most North Americans would think of when they think of beer. Head was a short, 1/2 finger height, but boy was it strong. That foam lasted til it was suds at the bottom of the mug. Sparce strips of lace were left in purely random places on the glass. Very odd. Apparent, almost soda cracker smell dominated the nostrils. It was pleasantly refreshing. A bit of a sweet/starchy smell overall. Same soda crackerlike taste. Sort of a dry, starchy taste. Never experienced that in a beer before. But hey, I like it, and my judgement will show it. Their is a hop presence when swallowing. Refreshing, dry and crisp mouthfeel. Very refreshing lager."
"Appearance: Pale golden straw color to it not bad, with a visible frothy white head does leave behind semi decent specks of lacing not bad. Aroma: Lemongrass, light and airy a touch of herbal hop note very mild smell to it, but nice and simple. Taste: A nice blend of semi sweet graininess with, very clean tasting lager with a touch of grassy hops there. Mouthfeel: A light bodied lager with a fizzy note to the overall texture. Drinkability: Very refreshing the type of beer I would consume if residing in Kenya, there's is nothing offensive it's just a clean tasting lager with a nice citrus grassy note to the overall flavor."
"Well, this is a definite step up from BMC, which was my worry before I tried this beer. This beer is a bit fuller & has a bit more flavor to it. There are some definite soft complementing spicy hop notes in the flavor, as well as a nice subtle bitterness in the finish. This is a crisp clean beer with a bit of malt-grain sweetness to it. Having said all this, it is still not a great beer. Worth trying perhaps because it is from Kenya, but just barely."
"The beer pours an almost clear pale gold color with a thin white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is weak and almost non-existant. What little there was smelled of pale malts and little else. The taste is less than average. It is quite watery and bitter. It has little malt flavor, but does go down smooth. The mouthfeel is lacking. I feel like one of those dudes in the Miller Lite commercials; ""I can't taste my beer!!!!"" It is a low bodied beer with decent carbonation. This beer sucks. It's one and done for me."
"Light and thin bodied, it comes across kind of like unskunked heineken. I imagine it would be rather drinkable in an incredibly hot and humid area. Nothing special, just about Bud/Miller range, but how often would I have a beer from Kenya. Worth buying once just for that fact."
"There's just something off about this beer. I can't say I'd ever have it again or recommend it. Far too expensive at the LCBO for this--$2.85 Canadian per bottle."
"This isn't a beer I would actively seek out by any means. It's cheap and adjuncty, and I could pick dozens of American macros if I wanted that in a beer. Overall, just plain and unexciting."
"cracked the bottle open and instant skunk aroma came out. luckily (and strangely) it disappeared for the most part shortly thereafter. this one pours a pale straw yellow colour witha nice white frothy head that dissolves rather quickly to a lasting lace with surprising stickiness. the smell did retain a bit of the skunkiness, but aside from that, there wasn't much else in the smell department, save for maybe some grain and hop smells. the taste is again grain and hop, though mostly watered down, yet crisp and refreshing without being overly carbonated. there's a bit of a sweet aftertaste that did not compliment the dry finish so much. a slightly below average yet still drinkable lager."
"Very light colored, bubbly big headed pour. Very light hop aroma, bubbles disappeared quickly on tongue leaving a flat feel on the mouth. Light hop tastedisappeared quickly, not much aftertaste. Wonn't buy again, won't recommenend it to anyone.I'm stunned that Bob Klein so highly regards this stuff."
"Wasn't expecting much. Thin, light, some light dry grassy hops, boring and bland, but easy to drink, generally inofensive, but entirely bland and pretty boring in the end, so crisp refreshing notes in the finish, wouldn't drink it again, unless i went to Kenya or something.."
"Very light gold color, medium head. Aroma is a little hoppy and something else..corn? A light tasting lager. Mild tasting, a little sweet and grassy. Slight hop bite. Not a good beer, but it at least drinkable. Mouthfeel is rather thin. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is neutral. Best Kenyan beer (1) I've tasted."
"."
"Clear, light yellow hue, little animation, thick/chunky white head with good retention, soapy residue produces a reasonable amount of lace. The nose was completely uninviting (damn near foul) adjunct plagued, very sweet, husky and grainy thankfully it lacks potency. The palate is similar to the bouquet (sweet, grainy, husky), a dry finish and crisp carbonation helps cut through the sweetness/grain. Any influence of hops is minimal, trace element of hay and grass. As for the malt, its absent. Slightly tacky finish, the aftertaste is lightly sweet. Medium body, thin but not watery. This is not a bad beer by any means, just dont be fooled by the exotic location, it is a standard pale lager youve had it before."
"As for overall drinkability, well, it's refreshing, light, and crisp. But I can barely tell it's beer. If it is served really cold, it seems to go well with spicy food on a hot, hot day. When it warms beyond ""cold", it becomes insipid."
"Perfectly translucent golden body with a thick white head. The head fades quickly, but the effervescense of the beer never quits until the glass is empty. The smell was very tempting with a pleasant hop presence. Unfortunately, the look and smell of this beer were the best part. It's bland to the tongue, blah to the mouth. Calling it Kenya's version of Budweiser is too mean, but I could probably reproduce the flavor of this beer by mixing Singha, Budweiser, and water. Still, it quenches the thirst and goes great with the muggy weather here on a Georgia summer night."
"This beer pours a yellow color with a moderate head and minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma is not very pleasing, but not too bad. The flavor is respectable, but nothing special and the aftertaste is a little bitter. Not a bad beer, but not a great one either."
"Took a stab at this one as it was something new at my local pub. I wish I had started with this one, its subtle yet refreshing. Very active carbonation that started with an F4 classification, and gradually moved its way down. Light in color, mouthfeel, and character. Somewhat pungent nose and aftertaste that is bothering me a little bit, but overall, this exceeds my expecations as my first 'african beer'."
"500 ml bottle. Pours a clear pale yellow, with a white head that receded quickly, but leaves a little bit of lace on the glass. Aroma of lemon is evident. Highly carbonated, with a clean finish. Definetly a thirst quenching brew. I could sit and drink this all night! A real session beer."
"330ml can, claims to have won over 15 monde selection gold medals around the rim. Pours out a light clear straw colour, no real head and no head retention to speak of. Smell is sweet and bread-like, malt content has obviously been given the throne over hops in this lager. It shows in the flavour. Sweet, a little lemony, a tad yeasty, this is hot, hot weather beer. A little crisp with no discernable aftertaste. All in all though it is not very impressive."
"I would drink this beer if I was on safari in Africa, but not otherwise. And what is up with the label/name? Is this the preferred beer of poachers everywhere? Light and clear gold color with a medium thin white head. No lacing and mild effervescence. Weak grass and hops aroma with a hint of skunk. Light bodied and highly carbonated, the flavor is very mild and unremarkable. Crisp finish with a watery aftertaste."
"This is definitely a lager I will come back to...I believe it would be excellent in the summer months....."
"""From Kenya?", I thought. I just had to try this. Poured a nice golden yellow with a medium head. The taste was surprisingly crisp, with subtle hops, and a citric quality. Very refreshing, a good ""summer"" brew, probably because Kenya is in perpetual summer. A little on the exspensive side at $2.79 for 500 ml, but the price was worth it to taste what they are drinking in Africa."
"The pour produced a soft white head on top of a very clear golden brew with a extremely active carbonation. This lager is pretty much what i expected, not aroma or taste. The aroma of lemon and coriander are weak. Buttery grain and citrus flavors don't impress. I was surprised by the busy carbonation giving a gentle creamy mouthfeel."
"Thx."
"Not impressive.."
"It pours a clear straw-gold body topped by a full and creamy bright-white head that holds fairly well before dropping, and leaves some nice lace. The bouquet expresses a grainy malt sweetness with some mild grassy and floral hoppiness in the background. The body is thin but exceptionally smooth across the palate with a fine carbonation. The palate is limited to a gently sweet maltiness that's obviously thinned by a liberal use of adjunct; and balanced by an understated bitterness. Some minor floral hop flavor is present if you seek it out, but doesn't present itself otherwise. It finishes short and sweet, just vanishing from the palate in much the same way it came in. It's a teasing beer that continually leaves you looking for more, which adds to it's drinkability but not much else. It's refreshing and light - easy to drink, but lacking in character."
"Tasted: 01/01/03"
"Not bad, though!"
"Also, I was amused that the bottle had the raised words beer only."
"I enjoyed it and would LOVE the opportunity to go back and try it again."
"A fluffy white head to rival the snows of Kiliminjaro. A pallid gold. A soft wind whispers aromas of distant hayfields and spun sugar. A malt and hop symmetry at once right and good but quickly lost to a sickly corn aftertaste that lingers badly. A wholly average lager, but likely top notch when on safari in the green hills of Africa."
"Clear straw hue w/ swirling flakes of yeast, topped by a thick, well retained bumpy white head that leaves good lace. Corn sweetness, light grain huskiness, mild sulfur in aroma w/ a trace grassy hop nose.  Pasty creamed corn sweetness hits the palate upfront, then is followed by light, clean bready malt.  Devoid of malt character overall.  Subdued lemony hop flavor.  Typically thinly bodied and watery in mouthfeel from the copious use of adjuncts and consequent lack of protein.  Finishes clean and lightly sweet due to the paltry hopping.  Tusker isn't flawed, but the large use of adjuncts leave a void in flavor that make it most forgettable.  Not unlike macroswill, Tusker's bland enough to leave my palate craving flavor."
"Pours a yellowish pale straw color, with a slightly chunky, small white head. On the nose there is a slight oily herbal hop aroma. On the palate, there is a slight graininess, hops, weird chewy mouthfeel almost oily, bread malt character. This is an ok lager, but nothing Ill ever buy again."
"Tusker, from Kenya:  Very pale, absolutely clear beer from Africa in a brown half liter bottle.  Best buy/by day clearly shown on the label (4/03).  Very white, thick creamy head.  Very little aroma, if any it’s slightly skunky.  The first taste was quite a nice surprise, no euro-lager taste at all, rather it has a very nice bread malt flavor, with a crisp hop bite and a clean aftertaste.  Very light bodied, and very easy to drink.  Wow, I wish I had found this nice lager while the heat was on, particularly at $2 bucks a bottle."
"Notes: A no frills lager and a damn good import for such a pale middle of the road lager. For less than $2 a bottle is was worth a try, this one certainly does a good job of cutting the humidity of the summer and quenching my thirst."
"I did note with some curiosity that the bottle had a ""best before"" notch date which was 9 months later than my purchase.  I doubt this beer made it from Kenya to Kentucky in a big hurry, which makes me wonder if the brewer promotes a one-year shelf-life.  I've always assumed a six-month shelf life was pretty standard for non-bottle conditioned beer, and I can't imagine a one-year shelf life for a light lager like this one."
