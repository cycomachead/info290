2.9,15.1,3.25,2.5,3,3,3,"Fosters. Because... why not?! It's Australian for bored. Saw the oil can at the local Publix and couldn't help but remember how I used to think this was a premium beer. LOL. Pours from the obnoxiously large can in to a Modelo pint glass with gusto. The massive, loose head of fizzy, white crackling suds is as big as the can. It rests atop a pale, yellow lager with copious amounts of bubbles hugging the glass, before disappearing in record time. What's left is an uninspired pint of pale, lifeless liquid. About as transparent as a beer can be.  A slightly sulfurous smell melds with metallic accents and a subtle, sour, floral hop note. In a nutshell, cheap lager. The taste is dominated by malty corn sweetness, with scant balancing bitterness. But not a sugary sweetness. Like chewing on unpopped popcorn kernels with a hint of aspartame. The finish is relatively crisp and clean, with little residual flavor. Surprisingly mild carbonation, with a smooth, slick, and easy mouthfeel. I could easily shotgun this entire oil can with little effort. Almost like beer-flavored water. Overall, aside from the unappealing aroma this is your typical pale, fizzy, swill. From time to time, it's just the right change of pace. Surprised I said that? It's an adjunct lager. For the style it's not half bad. If I was self-medicating I'd probably choose a beer like this.","JohnnyI","Feb 27, 2015"

A frothy head of modest size ensues, the lace retention not so much.The smell was the only thing that really bothered me. It had a graininess to it that didn't feel fresh. In addition, there was an odor of cooked vegetables that was not so pleasant. The taste surprised me however. A smooth and clean taste that was malty and grainy. Not complex at all but not so watery that it rendered it flavorless. The feel was light bodied with moderate carbonation. Fairly drinkable beer.

Smell is of whet and some slight malt.  taste was... Well, actually, upon first tasting it, I thought it was pretty awful stuff.  Not much subtlety and too much malt, but upon taking a few more tastes, I consider Fosters to be an acceptable tasting lager.   It beats the Budweisers and Millers or the world, but not by too much.  It has a light body and good carbonation on the tongue.  It certainly gets the job done, and I wouldn't turn one down if offered.  But again, I had it on tap.  It's probably better that way.

When I was in eighth grade, such a large can (steel in those days) was quite a novelty, and when I found an empty, I just had to take it to school for show-and-tell. Well, I was so proud of it that I showed it to my social studies teacher straight away. His horrified countenance took me by surprise, and bitter was my anguish when he promptly confiscated my novelty can. Utterly deflated, I had nothing for show-and -tell that day (not even dried dog food to eat in front of the class, another specialty of mine)....Awe, memories...","archyquaffer","May 23, 2014"

Light gold with lots of lager bubbles wafting toward the top to meet a fat soapy head of white foam that had better retention that I thought It might. Nose is crisp with only a slight bit of apple, sweet grain and a bright hops character. A bit of lemon from those pride of ringwood hops as it warms. Taste follows the nose all the way. The malt stays in the background until it warms and brings a light dry cracker. The apple is thin and delicious adding something cheerful and crisp. The carbonation has a small bite and the yeast imparts a bit of sourness to really round out this beer. Even though the middle is quite dry and palate cleansing, this beer finishes off dry and with a bit of sweet lemon and is very delicious. I would have this again.","utopiajane","Mar 13, 2014"

Lots of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom and sides of the glass from lots of carbonation. The aroma is of some sweet grains, that's about it. Taste is the same with a very slight dry finish. Also has a very slight bitter aftertaste which isn't bad at all and does not linger at all. Overall, I like Foster's.","BeerWithMike","Dec 21, 2013"

Again, standard, nothing offensive, nothing stand-out. Flavor is sweet, with a bit of sweet malt, a good bit of maize adjunct flavors and a very, very slight hop bitterness. It's a light on complexity, sweet AAL. It's not offensive like some, but it's nothing special. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Standard.

One might hope for a big flavor from a big beer can, but this lager is pretty non-descript. In fact, there is very little taste or aroma worth getting excited about. But it is wet and does have a decent ABV, so if you're looking for something to slake a parched throat and you don't have any decent cold water about, Foster's will get the job done. Otherwise, there are too many other, better lagers out there to satisfy a beer thirst.","beergoot","Jul 20, 2013"

Within 5 miles I remembered why. Standard crap big batch lager.

Occasion: SHARKNADO....Appearance: clear golden orange body with sporadic effervescence; white head is uneven, rocky and thin--as my wife notes, though, the oil can it emanates from is attractive in the holder's hand ... Aroma: metallic corn ping; otherwise, adjunct vapors... Palate: oily smooth body--easy drinking with gassy deposits--ugh... Taste: toasted oats and lager malts make a rather empty dry tasting flavor; could be made in an American macro factory for all we the consumer know... Overall: the can instructs one to play Aussie bocce--this alone says much about the beer's intended patronage and its intentions; befitting Sharknado, this beer goes down smoothly yet predictably, like the Aussie who is gnawed upon only to be sucked away at the film's end by the impending tornado....I can live with this beer and its "imported" novelty....","dacrza1","Jul 12, 2013"

Medium to light body with a moderate to heavy level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly mouthfeel. Not the greatest beer in the world, but it was a step above the other macros offered on tap.

Smell is of grain, corn flakes, and sugar. Taste is of grain and sweetened corn flake flavors. There is a very mild bitterness that quickly fades after each sip and turns into a slightly medicinal flavor. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The mouth opening was poorly designed or something. Smelled very clearly metallic and sweet. C'est tout. It tastes like grainy metallic water. Refreshing, but the aftertaste is, once again, metallic. However, if it weren't for that this beer could almost rival Singha for refreshment as it doesn't taste TOO sweet and doesn't taste like corn. Still, Singha is clearly better. Foster's totally beats Busch, though. If this is on the same price scale in Australia as Busch is here, I'd say they have it a bit better over there. Cheers.","ElCommodoro","Apr 07, 2011"

It's yellow and clear with a pretty good head on it, the head actually leaves some nice lacing. The flavors are of the standard hops and malts. This beer is a little bit heavier on the belly than something like a Coors original or Budweiser.

This is just your basic mass produced lager. Nothing special, and not something I care to spend any money on in the future.","beeragent","Apr 03, 2007"

I was expcting something like Labatt Blue turned out to be. Not spectacular or too exciting, but a decent brew that would be readily drinkable. No such luck. Fosters turns out to be sort of like Bud on steroids. Color is decent. Though pale, Fosters has some noticable tan in with the yellow. Head is high and relatively well formed, and though it will die long before you finish the beer, it will also leave a little bit of lacing. Smell is where you can tell something is wrong. There's some wierd chemical scent in there with the grains. Turns out its some combination of crappy hops and our old friend "adjunct" grains. The grain part of the beer really isn't that bad. It's slightly sweet, and (like the color suggests) stronger than the lightest of American Macros. But the hops suck, and there are some inferior grains in there and they combine to produce lingering chemical nastiness and astringent bitterness that ruin the beer. And there's no excuse for this. Fosters that's sold in America is actually brewed in Canada, so the taste isn't from skunking due to a trip around the world. And Molson, who can make a decent beer when they sell it under their own name, is the subcontractor, so the problem isn't that Fosters picked a bad partner. The crappiness of this beer is their own fault, and seems to be due to inferior ingredients. Fortunately "Australian for Bud" does not translate to "as bad as Bud", even a megabrewer who doesn't obviously doesn't give a damn about quality won't necessarily screw up as bad as Busch usually does. So no this isn't as godawful as Budweiser, but it is still pretty damn bad. I would have to be pretty hard up for a beer to drink another one of these.

2.91,15.5,3,2,3,3.5,3.5,"Light golden, looks like any run-of-the-mill lager. No smell to speak of. Tastes rather run-of-the-mill but doesn't have any aftertaste to speak of. Smooth and refreshing at any temperature. Perhaps it's more acceptable because it isn't American. Placebo effect.","packetknife","Apr 29, 2002"

2.32,-7.9,1.5,2,2,2.5,3.5,"Very thin, but quite refreshing on a hot day like this.  Ground maize aromas.  If you've ever had Asahi, its almost identical.  Faint straw color, completely transparent.  Mild bitterness in the mix.  I'd prefer a Bud or Coors to be quite honest...","Jordan","Apr 15, 2002"
3.11,23.4,3.5,2.5,3,4,3.5,"Notes: A pretty drinkable lager, nothing to go “beer crazy” over. A good beer to wash down a working man’s meat and potatoes meal.","Jason","Mar 31, 2002"
2.5,-0.8,3,3,2,3,2.5,"gold in color, not much adjunct smell smell to speak of. poured a big rocky head which stuck around for the entire oil can.  has a sort of smooth creamy mouthfeel but the taste was rather boring, with a rather "crap beer " aftertaste.   i am rather dissapointed.  not something i'd turn down if offered, but nothing to go out of your way to consume.  in fact i'd say that most american macros are more worthy of consumption than this stuff.","budgood1","Mar 29, 2002"

1.8,-28.6,1,1,2,3,2,"This one falls under the classification of "lawnmower beer". Had just a bit more character when it was made in Australia (now it's contract brewed in Canada)","beerluvr","Nov 07, 2001"

2.06,-18.3,3,2,2,2,2,"Growing up this one of my favorites, (probably because of the oil can) I tried it again recently and was a bit dissapointed...Taste is similar to an American  Lager...very light...nothing special","grdahl","Aug 30, 2001"
2.6,3.2,3,3,2,3,3,"Bottled seems a little better than the canned version.  Contract brewed for the North American market in Canada, this beer has always struck me as being more like a less-than-average Canadian lager.","Brent","Jul 11, 2001"
1.8,-28.6,3,3,1,1,2,"It looks and smells like an aright lager, but one taste from its oil can container and it becomes this beergod awful beverage from down under (hell?). Sure the adverts in the US are funny, but it hardly helps to mask its hard to swallow taste. Thanks, but I'll pass on this one.","Todd","Jul 10, 2001"
