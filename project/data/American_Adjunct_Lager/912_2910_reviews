"Great for the beach, even better when it's free at an all inclusive resort"
"Pretty watery- minimal taste but refreshing if cold and served on A beach"
"Cheap adjunct lager, not my thing"

"Not great. Not awful. Ok for an island beer..."

"One of my favorite industrial lagers. Great with Caribbean food. I compare beers against their own style so this scores high for me."
"firmly mediocre and uncrafty but drinkable"
""
"Fairly light, but more interesting than many tropical beers"
"Better than light. If you don't want rum for a night go with these."
""
"It's a beer to be enjoyed in hot weather. Not a winter beer"

"I love Presidente!  I'd choose it over Dos Equis, Corona and just about any other mass produced Mexican or Dominican beer.  I had it first at port on the island of Saint Maarten during a cruise vacation, so I thought maybe my intoxication affected my perceptions so I tried it again when I got home - still great!  Very refreshing, crisp, clean and easy to drink: perfect for hot days and bbq's if you're looking to grab something cheap and in mass."

"Best when served near freezing right out of bottle. This beer is shit. If no better option then this will suffice. But if you have a choice pick anything else. Go corona. DR has corona. Hell go coors light!"
"It was the only beer we had to drink in the d.r. Last year. It remained mediocre under all circumstances. Even in the Caribbean sun."

"Pours a clear light golden color with a huge fluffy white head that leaves quite a bit of lace on the sides. Aromas of sweet bready pilsner malt with an hint of sulfur and some faint floral essence. Flavor is a bit on the sweet side with a hint of spice. Light body with a huge amount of carbonation and just shy of watery in the mouth. I've had much worse, but I could see a few of these going down easily on a beach somewhere."
""
""
""
"don't see why it has bad reviews Pairs very good with food and its very crisp"
""
"Generic South American lager.  No more or less pleasant than Corona, but certainly not very good."

"Much more on the dry side than many, this one builds up to a sort of chalky finish. That said, it's crispness is consistently strong, and it's not horribly unclean. It avoids stickiness, which is something."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: eh. I wouldn't seek this beer out again, unless I found myself in the DR and wanted a local quaff on the beach."

"O: I'm not a fan of pilseners nor lagers/adjunct lagers, but I have to say that I'm honestly impressed by this. I hold Dominican cuisine near and dear to my heart, so when I saw a Dominican brewed beer in the cooler, I had to pick it up to see what it was all about. While it's very much along the lines of a BMC offering, Presidente offers more flavor, a lot more character in the mouth, and serves as a refreshing beverage alongside some summer food. Will definitely be keeping this in mind for my next family BBQ."

"O: This is a beer that's very much like other tropical lagers I've had. It's not my favorite, but it's not repulsive, either. It's just kind of there. I've rated it relatively highly because it is, in my opinion and experience, exactly what I expected from a lager exported from a tropical country. It gets lots of points for being true to the style, but loses points subjectively, because as true to style as it is, it's not a style that I'm in love with by any means. Beats the hell out of Corona, though."
""

""

"Well balanced and refreshing, a good example of the adjunct style. The hops are non aromatic but provide the expected refreshing bitterness that lets you quench your thirst. Pleasant yeasty nose combined with a light mouthfeel and a very clean finish make this an excellent choice for warm weather chillin. At $12 for a 12 pack it's really worth checking out, if we ever get through the winter :)"

"Great beer to have on a sunny beach, but not so great if you want a lot of taste out of it."

"The beer has little character and cannot be recommended, but it may the lesser of evils if you find yourself in this part of the world. It was better than the local Aruba beer. The presentation and bottling were first rate. Cheers, Aruba. Cheers, Dominican Republic."

"After a Holiday in the Dominican I went on a mad 5 year search for this beer. When served as the natives do at home, with a pinch of sugar in a stout glass, this beer has become my absolute favorite. Strong head. No after taste. No Heavy Beer Drag but with a nice 5% pop It is no wonder that thou the Dominican is one of the poorest countries in the world the people all seem to have a smile on their face. I always have one when drinking Presidente !"
"Overall: Pretty straightforward and normal pilsner. It could be more crisp and refreshing, but just middle of the road."
""
""
"Perfectly average. Also forgettable. But by no means terrible. Good beach beer."
""
""
""

"This beer is just bleh. I actually shuddered after a few drinks. Glad I only bought a single. If I'm ever in the Dominican Republic I'll stick to wine."

"I had this on-tap, in bottles, and cans all while in the Dominican Republic. It tastes pretty close to Bud Light or Miller Light, which is to say, not bad for a day at the beach/pool, but not something you drink for its flavor. Its light on the alcohol so you can definitely enjoy a good amount of em and it doesn't really do you in. I enjoyed it because I was out in the sun and it didn't dehydrate me quite as much as heavier stuff. You know what youre getting into with a beer like this."

"A below average macro tasting pilsner with good looks."

"Nothing spectacular here - yellowish color, light head that dissipates quickly. Overly carbonated (which I'm learning I just don't like.) It has the taste of a lite beer (and no, I had the regular type, not lite.) I even had two this evening just to make sure of my impression. I sure do like trying beers from other countries, but the Dominican Republic won't be one country I'll be looking at any time soon."
""
""
"O - Overall my two cents would be that this beer is one of the better American Adjunct Lagers (oxymoron). It was a bit more than the fizzy carbonated water I expected."
""
""
""
""
"Finally getting down to reviewing Presidente, a beer that many Caribbean travelers finally had the chance to purchase in these parts a few months ago. It pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises corn, puffed rice, and a touch of mild skunk. The taste brings in more of the same, in true adjunct beer fashion, though there is now a bit more corn and a bit less skunk (thank God). The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a pretty sad, boring beer. I assume those who have fond memories of this beer were really just remembering the good times they had on cruises and whatnot..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Corn, saltine crackers, adjunct laden. Thankfully clean and not too weird. Fairly crisp and not sweet at all. Dry and bland, vague noble hop character, seltzer water mouthfeel. However simple, it manages to be pretty quenching. Not something i'd grab again but it gets the job done while passing the time."
""
""
"Overall - It's always taking a chance to try a beer from a new country. Not much of a risk here, though. Presidente, thy name is Coors Light."
""
"my beer of choice when vacationing in the caribbean without a doubt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- When I was in the Dominican Republic my beer choices were this or Miller High Life, so I went with this. Nothing to write home about by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not recommended"
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and could be refreshing on a hot summer day but it doesnâ€™t really offer much in the terms of taste."
""
""
""
" Most of the bars in the places I was in left you with a choice between Heineken, Corona, Bud Light and Presidente. In this class, Presidente was and still is president! Overall a fine Adjunct Lager."
""
""
"O: This is a very easy to drink and quite sessionable beer that matched very well with the spicy Latin American food that I had. I could easily have a couple of these beers and they were quite refreshing on a warm late spring evening."
""
""
"Gets pretty bad ratings here, but compared to other AALs I've had, I was more bullish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, faint, yellowish coloring that is very translucent. A chunky, frothy white head sits atop the surface and clings to the glass. Aromas are toasted grain and a hint of roasted corn, with a tangy floral highlight throughout. Flavors are very watered down, with a sharpness to them that makes this a tough drink. Toasted grains and a tangy, musty, bread-like character make up most of the palate. Part of this reaches a point where you don't want to know what else it is you are tasting. Bleh. The aftertaste is astringent and corn sweet, almost becoming syrupy. Rough finish, leaving the mouth battered and limp. Not good."
""
""
""
"Thin head and no lacing on a clear straw yellow body. Aroma is mostly pale malt and sweet corn. Flavor is more of the same with sweet corn, little malt and no bitterness. Light body and high carbonation. I stand by my belief that most of these adjunct lagers are just regular Budweiser in a different bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crystal clear gold with a voluminous white head. Heavily carbed evident in the body and the ridiculous head generation. Spotty lacing but rocky and almost 'whipped cream'-like retention. Pretty good looking for an AAL. A bit of corn in the nose, cooked veggies, grainy malts and a bit of metal. Taste has some sweet and vegetal notes, malty, a bit of cereal and again a bit metallic. Plain and mildly sweet in the finish. Blegh overall, not the advertised 'pilsner' but probably something conducive for getting blasted with on a beach in the Caribbean."
""
""
"Presidente doesn't get my vote. Not for best beer nor for worst. In fact, I am utterly disinterested in it. This, unless one is in the mood for something fast and mindless, is in my opinion one of the worst things that can be said about any beer. Mind you, however, I am not most drinkers and, more likely than not, others will find that a very positive attribute."
""

"This wasn't an awful beer. It was fine with dinner. It didn't offer much in terms of flavor or character. It's unoffensive, but ultimately it can be ignored."
""
""
"I figured a cruise was the perfect time to try beers I'd not had before, so since this boat had a DR flag flying off the back of it I felt I should ""rep"" the pseudo-terrain that I was living in. It appears as a golden color that you would expect from the style. The aroma had that cooked corn smell typical of lower quality ingredients. The flavor had some flaked corn and cheaper barley taste, but it wasn't all that bad for a drink. The mouthfeel was surprisingly nice and a lot more hearty that I would have assumed. Overall I didn't mind this beer, but I didn't order it again on the boat. I went back to the hard stuff."
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer, nothing to rave about, it's basic beer"
""
"O/D - Easy, not bad for the style. Enough flavour to be drinkable. Inoffensive but not interesting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have had this beer many times and have it only depending on the situation (I come from a dominican family). I really try my best to respect this beer but in my honest opinion this is nothing more than your basic lager maybe a little more dry. Granted on a hot summer day, and your at the beach in DR believe me the review for this beer is definitely much higher, but unfortunately I am not on that beach every day. Hope you all enjoy but be warned. Salud!"

"Drinkability is pretty good, this is a clean beer, light flavored and generic for sure, but gulpable, not to gassy, and a touch stronger then some of the other locals (although the label clearly states 5% ABV, not the 6% listed at the time of this review, although I've submitted the change)."
"O- A decent, cheap brew, pretty much what I expected."
"One and done for me! A nice gesture, but like I said, never have a stranger buy you a beer!"
"O: this lager is a good cheap option since it's very drinkable and decent."
"Consumed straight from the bottle at Villa Pizza in Manhattan, NYC. Paired with some supreme pizza. Basic pilsner taste with kind of a skunk background (not light struck, just Heineken style). I figured a Czech Pilsner would go well with the pizza. The thin and high carbonation washed down the pepperoni and sausage pretty well. Sure, it's not super delicious but it washed my food down nicely."
"the best and worst beer I've ever had from the Dominican Republic if I'm not mistaken"
"Cheezy smell, not skunked just poor quality. Pale lager, with big bubbles. Malt story, with a bit of an acidic bite. Vegetable, corn, sugar, watery. Lacey. Aggressive carbonation. Minimalist drinkability.Stephan's bottle from his recent trip. Probably better than tap water there."
"comes out a weak straw color thats more clear than yellow. big foamy head that sticks well and recedes rescues this a little bit. grain, corn husk, alcohol and a bit of pepper make up an uninviting nose. taste is bread malts corn husk and grain and a very mild hop bite in the end. lots of carbonation to this light bodied brew. so there it is its not much to it."
"Moderate dense three finger head of white bubbles, with very clingy broken lace. Color is a 3 on the SRM beer color chart, with lots of micro bubble action. Smell is of wet corn, rice, and a little malt. Taste is light flavors of roasted corn, wheat, rice, and a little grapefruit. Mouthfeel has a good feel from the carbonation, but a little watery overall. Very refreshing finish. Not a beer that I would go out of my way to buy, but not one I would not buy if it was on the shelf in front of me. Refreshing, and good enough flavor."
"D - This beer is above my expectations. I realize that's not the highest praise but this is a good emulation of simple traditional German lagers like some of the smoother Viennas etc. This is widely available in New York supermarkets. And I will have to rate it higher than some of it's Mexican competitors. *cough Corona cough cough*"
"D- Nothing special for its style but as far as a common american lager/pilsner draft this was solid, not too filling for the alcohol. I would definitely order this again on draft since its more common in south florida."
"Poured a clear straw color...uhoh, I see where this is going...carbonation, and a thin fizzy head that fizzled out to nothing. Mostly grains and staleness in the aroma. Weak taste of grains, corn, metallic hops. Bitter and very unflavorful, very light, and not very drinkable at all, unless bland and unimaginative and adjunct is your thing."
"What can you say about this one. It was widely available in the caribbean and for the most part cheaper than water, which is the. Flavor I get most from it. Pretty much the BMC of the Caribbean. I wouldn't seek this beer out but it was ok to drink when it was free on a hot boat ride."
"Glad I brought my own beer."
"This isn't a sharp, tangy pilsner, almost mellow in it's mouthfeel. OK, but not a lager/pilsner I'd stock a regular basis."
"overall, its a classic dook lager. Typical drunk ass slammable lager brew. No worse than the american eqiuvalents, but probably significantly cheaper, and produced in better conditions than the third world ghettos of st. louis."
"Poured on tap at MIA. Thin white head, some lacing. Color is clear straw-gold. Aroma is sweet and corny. Flavor is a typical blend of sweet malt, corn adjunct and noble bittering hops. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall a good Caribbean refresher."
""
"Enjoyed on special at Sergio's in Miami, FL. This beer poured into a chilled mug, which means way too much head was produced and took a while to be able to drink. The beer is a clear pale golden color. The aroma is slightly skunky with some grassy hop notes, but not very strong or well balanced. The taste is crisp and grassy, with a little skunky note as well. the mouthfeel is overcarbonated, but finishes very clean with no lingering harsh flavors. Goes well with a salad, but overall nothing I would ever choose to get again."
"Since there was nothing else left to try on the menu I picked up one of these. It's a drinkable lager but it's just nothing special. If you've had one Adjunct Lager then you've probably had this one too. The beer is yellow without much of any head. The smell is bitter and the flavor is grassy and bitter. Not much else to really say about it."
"O: this is a great beer if you are on a resort sitting on the beach with a novel trying to avoid getting too sunburned. Certainly not a beer I would buy in the states given the probable mark up (I've never seen it in the states), but for my money much better than corona, pacifico, etc, then again I don't ever buy those here either. Overall, I say a good beer for the style."
"D- Very drinkable but a premiem price i'll have to pass."
"Lay over...Miami International...might as well try a beer from the Dominican. I will go against the grain and comment that this beer is better than a lot of Mexican/Brazilian/colombian beers that I have tried! Its lawnmower beer for sure, decent. Yellow in color, no smell, white head, some lacing. Could seriously put these down with no problem, which means taste/drinkability/mouthfeel are all solid! C'mon man...try it!"
"Don't buy in states, but when on vacation it's a nice afternoon beer."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about his brew was the look. For the quality of the beer, and the price, there was a surprisingly robust head atop the beer. While the coloring was mute, and the tastes bland, this was one nice thing about a beer that fits comfortably around the same level as its competitors. This would be the type of beer you would expect to cost a buck at the ballgame."
"My aggro pour resulted in just over a finger's worth of foamy,bone-white head with moderate retention. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. It was the one aspect of the style that I truly CANsistently enjoy - it looked like liquid sunshine in the glass, brightening otherwise dull winter days. I know Stone's stance - ""Fizzy yellow beer is for wussies"" and so ""[I am] not worthy"" of some (all?) of their flagship beers, but so be it. This looked like what I think of when I think of ""beer"". The nose was still heavy on Saaz, but not skunky, so it must have been a pent-up whiff that escaped when I prised it open. Opening a green bottle = Forrest Gump's box o'chocolates = Russian roulette. You just never know what you are going to get. The head had fallen, leaving a little bit of sticky lacing in its wake. Mouthfeel was watery and it still tasted more of Saaz hops than of adjuncts in the mouth. It was more like a watery Czech Pils than an AAL. Finish was slightly husky, towards (but not heavy on) silage. Frankly, it was not too bad for the style and I wonder if it might be any better from a CAN."
"M: refreshing for sure, plenty of carbonation with a heavy body, D: it must be drank ice cold, anything less and the beer will be insulting to pallate."
"A friend brought this over tonight. This is a decent pilsner. I could definitley drink a couple of these on a hot summer day. It has a nice crispness to it. I really like this beer. Compared to bud this is an A+ in the American adjunt lager category."
"Enjoyed a Presidente right out of the freezer, stright from teh bottle. Once I opened the bottle the beer started to crystalize to frozen, leaving me a VERY VERY cool beer. Great stuff. I have had this beer before on the golf course, great summer beer."
"Everything about this beer is wrong but the fact that its somewhat drinkable when ice cold on a beach or in a dive bar in the latitudes. Pale yellow, has a head. Smell, not good. Corn and earth. Taste, corn and syrup and earth. Mouthfeel is ok, and like I said, drinkable but atmosphere has to right and taste buds need to be asleep."
"D - I've been killing these non-stop since I got to the Dominican Republic. Surprised it comes in at 6%, was expecting it to be around 4%."
"Overall if you looking for a ""beer"" order a Miller/Bud light or some other brand of beer before spending the extra cash for this import."
"Final Thoughts: Well, I did get bombed on it once during my stay in the Dominican, but as the week dragged on I found myself turning to Rum, so it certainly did overstay it's welcome, although given it was the only beer I could get without having to pay an arm and a leg, I can't say I minded. However, lets just say I'm not surprised this stuff isn't widely imported. As far as Caribbean beer is concerned, I'd prefer Red Stripe."
"I had this beer while on a vacation to the Dominican Republic. I had this beer during my week stay at a resort in La Romana, DR because it was the only beer option offered at the resort. This was unfortunate because this beer falls somewhere between a budweiser and a corona which is not a good thing. The beer seemed very watered down and had little flavor. It was a very light beer so you could drink a lot in one sitting if you could ignore the fact that there is not much good about this beer as far as taste goes. I would not recommend this beer."
"RJT"
"It tastes a lot like Miller Genuine Draft with a tad more maltyness and some skunkyness. After a little research, the brewery also produces Miller Genuine Draft. Coincidence? Nah. It is nothing special and is just a mediocre, bland american-style pilsner/lager."
" Smelled a little hoppy with an overpowering skunk aroma. The taste was pretty skunky as well but there was a little hop taste and enough flavor to identify it as a pilsner. Mouthfeel is pretty light and it is very drinkable for the first couple of beers it is really sort of like water. After knocking back a few of these on a hot day by the pool it starts to taste pretty bad but if you're just having 2 or 3 and are providing for people that aren't really beer drinkers its a good choice."
"overall it was not that the flavor was that terrible, but there was just something about this that i just could not do."
"it's too expensive for what it is, unfortunately it's the preferred beer for some people in my crowd and it's hard to steer them away. For being an american adjunct lager it's pretty good, although it's marketed as a pilsner. That being said, i like it for a drink but I wont be going out and getting this for myself."
"I had a very tough time drinking more than 2 of these in a row. I have had quite a few Latin American light lagers, and this actually was on of my least favorites."
"dr. Very drinkable, but unremarkable."
"D: Light, crisp and tastier than the average American macro. Good for the time and place (PR) but still Par."
"Pours a typical straw yellow, about average. Aroma is malty and a bit wan, but not off-putting. Flavor is crisp and malty, simple, about average - not spectacular, but still palatable. Texture is fairly smooth and tingly. Overall an average beer, but still worth a try."
"D: Not impressed at all. Not very drinkable except to quench down some flavorful Caribbean food."
"Pale golden not too clean colour, pous a small head, though there's always a thin cloak on the surface. Smell is just grain, I can't feel any other thing. Medium body, it feels carbonated in mouth, with taste of grains and some citrus. An OK refreshing beer."
"Medium bodied with decent effervescence. Reasonably good, middle-of-the-road brew."
"This was a pale golden-yellow color with a quickly disappearing white head and no lacing to report. The aroma is simple, clean cereal wheat, not much else, very light but okay. The flavor is passable cereal beverage just like the aroma advertises. There's a slight grass hop detectable perhaps, very crisp as a pilsner must be, although I see this categorized as a plain old lager. It's light bodied, very easy drinking, of course, not offensive at all in my book. Crisp and refreshing for sure. Most anybody would be okay with this brew. Not a typical Mexican beer from my limited experience, definitely more in line with macro pilsners from Europe. It's okay, not much else to report. If it's all they have at the picnic, consider yourself better off than if they had Keystone Light."
"All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this beer."
"cheers!...not!"
"Green bottle pours a crystal clear pale yellow body with a medium white head that leaves some spotty lace. Aroma has a hint of adjunct grain and vague hops. At least it's not skunky. Light body is actively carbonated. Tastes like your average American mass produced lager. Slightly sweet grainy malt with a touch of corn or rice, vague hop bitterness to balance. High carbonation is the dominant sensation. Inoffensive, but why bother..."
"Flag as Inappropriate | id: 985847"
"D â€“ Although I would not usually buy it, under the right circumstances I will chug the hell out of it. Because it works well with Mexican food or anything spicy, and itâ€™s nice in the sun, too."
"For 2 dollars on a hot Caribbean day? I'd say this is a winner."
"Drinkability - This is not a very impressive beer; there are way better beers from the Carribean region"
"It's a nice golden color producing a bunch of foamy white head. It smells a bit of wheat with a trace of corn. It goes down easily enough and leaves you wanting more. This was the only beer available at the all-inclusive resort I stayed at. I grew fond of it, not out of necessity, but because it's enjoyable. I'd take this over any American macro pilsner."
"This is a pretty weak hack at a pilsner. Plenty of overcooked grain and that classic, Corona-like skunk. Nothing doing in terms of hops. This might be appropriate to quaff on the beach with a few lime wedges, but makes for a disappointing brew overall."
"Pours a clear, yellow color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of pale malt, yeast, very slight hops, and strong adjunct. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, pale malt, slight hops, and strong finish of adjunct. Overall, right on par with other adjuncts."
"I'm not sure if I could drink this again, there is too much to be desired."
"Drink is good. All and all I like this beer. I really didn't know anything about it and I seen the handle and gave it a shot. I would much rather have this than a corona. As there is some taste to this."
"Now to drinkability. It is slightly higher in alcohol than most BMC products, so the fact that you would subject yourself to less, uh, ""quality challenged"" beer is a big plus. The fact that the beer is still mediocre pretty much negates that. However, living in a subtropical climate, this beer is quite refreshing. It has a cooling, quenching, quality."
"D - The drinkability is alright aside from the metallic finish and lack of significant flavor. The appearance of this beer is deceiving."
"D: Maybe b/c it was the only beer available while suffering through the 90 degree / 100% humidity days, but... average at best, but not horrific."
"Several years back on a vacation to a Dominican resort, they had this on tap for free. They had some beers you could purchase but I drank free all week and I would not have done that if I thought this beer was crap."
"Taste is sweet and malty with a touch of mild hop balance. At 6%, the alcohol is detectable as there is not much to hide behind. With Presidente, you at least know you are drinking a beer instead of flavored water. Falls somewhere between a adjunct lager and malt liquor. Not too shabby, I could drink this again."
"Drinkability: Does it get the job done when you're at the beach and the pool as far as quenching thirst? Sure does. I'd never buy it otherwise, though, and yes, clearly it's not a great brew. At 6% though, you'll feel good after a day in the sun after two or three of them."
"Overall- Unimpressive lager that is easily drinkable in the hot humid DR weather. Sitting in a pool all week this was easy to drink but I won't intentially look for this."
"Notes: I read the info that this beer does not travel well. The green bottle does not help. This beer was a single from a case in Miami. It traveled in the carry on of a good friend and while subjected to air travel it faired quite well. Much thanks to the kind hearted gal. This beer was easy to drink and the ABV was right on the money. No,not a complex beer,not exciting yet it quenched my thirst on this hot night."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Rich, gold color with a 1 inch head. Has a decent aroma, mildly malty. Taste is crisp and refreshing. Goes down smooth with a mild aftertaste. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"The aroma is light, but noticeable corn and a touch of hops. Light and mobile on the palate. Malt and sweet corn dominate the flavor. The finish lacks bitterness. But the light flavors make this beer drinkable. Not bad, considering the style."
"The taste is about what you'd expect from the smell. Very reminicent of the aforementioned Dutch beers. Pretty crisp in the front, somewhat astringent. This fades into well...a skunky taste with some grains faintly appearing in the finish. Aftertaste is of some corn adjuncts on the tongue....a little sweetness showing up. Surprisingly a bit thicker than I'd expect for this beer, as it does coat the tongue after swallowed. Certainly nothing to write home about. If I were to want a beer of this style, I'd look somewhere else."
"Presidente is a sparkling, crystal clear pale straw colored cerveza with a thin white head that has good retention and lacing. It smells like someone ran over a skunk. It's very light bodied and watery with a scratchy finish. It tastes like funk. Corn and funk. And skunk. I guess someone had this tiny green bottle under a grow light for a while."
"D: I can throw these back like no tomorrow. I am definitely going to buy Presidente again. Corona by day, Presidente by night perhaps."
"Drinkability - Refreshing and worth a drink."
"When poured into a Bell's pint glass, Presidente was a pale straw yellow color with an ant sized head of foam on top. This head of foam quickly fizzled down into a few rings along the sides. Not much of aroma, but at least it wasn't offensive or foul. The aroma was about the malted cereal grains with a spatter of green olives and apple juice. It sounds worse than what it actually was. The taste was all about the cheap malted cereal grains. No hops or apple juice, just malted grains. I could actually taste the grains get maltier as the taste went on. That was until the end of the taste when they just faded away into oblivion. As you tell already, this was a light bodied beer with a ton of carbonation to it. The aftertaste was just a quick flash of malted grains. Despite my low score, this wasn't a totally bad beer. I know for a fact that I would choose this over a quite a few domestic adjunct lagers."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down easily enough, not too filling, decent kick for the style and a good representation of style, I've certainly had much worse but this still isn't a beer that I would want to drink again if I had other choices."
"Certainly not a great beer by any standard, but drinkable."
"I went to a friend's house of Poker night and broke out the good stuff. Poured a lighter yellow color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of corn and some graininess. Tastes of corn, sweet maltiness, and grainy. Yep, it is a Pale Lager alright."
"D - It's easy to slug a bunch of these at once but if you're looking for flavor go elsewhere. Still better than you're standard adjunct though."
"Note: Nov. 2009 freshness date printed on bottle."
"D - Bleh. Not recommended. Not a good beer."
"This green bottle traveled all the way from the Dominican Republic to New York City where I bought it! It was a perfectly clear, pale gold color with a three finger head of cream-colored foam. The aroma was dry and grainy, typical macro stuff with a slight skunkiness. The flavors were actually decent, stale malt and some weak citrus hops with a general grainy quality. The mouthfeel was rough because the carbonation was so high and the body light. Generally generic but not quite offensive."
"drinkability- in Dominican the best beer to put back and drink lots of on the beach"
"Very pale golden color, thin white head. Pale malt aroma, a trace of grassiness.Quite clean tasting.Not much of the skunkiness I expected. Flavor is quite thin and non-descript but there is a bit of malt some light grassy hop flavor. Pretty quaffable and much better than I would have thought.I drank at least a case of this while in St Thomas, would buy here in Michigan for kicks and grinns"
"This needs something. Mild carbonation, thin mouthfeel with a sour after taste. Not even very drinkable. Had as the finish on some mexican food. Nothing really but a flavor washer. Not going there again."
"A good sub par beer that tastes better when your on vacation. I can drink this with some good Cuban food and it doesn't seem so bad. In fact it goes great with the half roasted chicken, black beans and rice I just ordered from Puerto Sagua here on south beach."
"Not really impressed with this one. Pours a yellowish wheat color with a very thin head. Smell is nothing special; I saw that most people said it smelled of corn and malt and that is dead on. Taste is smooth but not good. Tastes like watery beer, which I expected. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth yet no taste as I said before. This beer is nothing to fight over. Somewhat watery, spend your money somewhere else."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a white lace head. It has an ok mild hop aroma to it. There is the scent of pale malts and lager yeast. The taste is weak and watery, but not that bad. It lacks any malt character and actually reminds me quite a bit of a Budweiser in taste - tad more flavor. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer and could be quite drinkable - goes down relatively easily, but doesn't have much character to it."
"It is what it is. Golden colored with a thin head. It's pretty smooth but doesn't have a ton of flavor and seemed watery. I'm actually very surprised at the 6% abv, doesn't taste like it. Very light, somewhat refreshing and knock this one up a grade during the summer."
"D - This is a pretty good brew for the style. One of the better options at some locales in the BVI."
"Good mouthfeel and an equally good level of drinkability make for a light, easily drinkable brew..."
"Bottle- Pale, pale yellow with a fizzy and short lived white cap. The nose is grassy with lots of pale malts and a heavy dose of vegetables. Tastes of mild bitter grassy hops with veggies and straw. Quick and spritzy finish. Not offensive, just not good."
"Last beer of the night at the Milky Way in JP, given to me by a friend. Who's gonna pass up a free beer? Poured into a pint glass. Looked like an average lager. Smell was a bit musty. Taste was pretty bleak, mostly corn and water. I couldn't believe how sticky this beer was in my mouth. Bordering on sugary. I have tried lots of macro lagers from counties south of the border, but this one is bottom of the barrel. Barely drinkable."
"D: For a pilsner was a tad rough around the edges and didn't make me look forward to the next sip. Did not find it particularly refreshing or crisp per style."
"Not bad. I'd drink this on a beach. Off a beach, well that's another story. The aroma is light and grainy, no DMS at least. The flavor is pretty mild with a lager character and subtle grain taste. It finishes with a balancing bitterness and crisp, dry mouthfeel. Not bad, pretty drinkable, and completely inoffensive"
"Was recently in the Dominican Republic on vacation...our resort had this beer on tap. ONLY this beer on tap. ONLY this beer in bottles. Needless to say for one week I became a lover of vodka. This was not a good beer. Tasted watered down, was always served slightly chilled and a flavor relative to any US mass produced beer. I can't say enough good things about the people and their island except that if this is their national beer a revolution might not be a bad thing!"
"Drinkability : a well known beer in Dominicana republic, but a bad copy of Pilsener style"
"D - Had several of these, and they went down easy, so I'd have to say this is drinkable. Was surprised to see that the alcohol weighs in at 6%...more than some other macros, this has the same ABV as DFH 60 Min IPA, and I can't drink 60 Min nearly as quick as I did this, so this is a pretty dangerous macro to toss back pitchers of."
"When taking all of this into account, and having lived amongst these people, this beer is daggone good. Nothing tastes better than an ice-cold Presidente on a hot, steamy Dominican afternoon or night (yes, it's still hot and steamy at night)."
"D: Goes down like water"
"D: Don't drink this beer. Ever. Please. I beg of you. It was downright awful. Perhaps in the Dominican Republic, where it's fresh, it's mildly better, but man, this was one horrible beer."
"The second time I had this was several months later. I found 12-packs for sale at a large store in Boston (Allston?), across from the Sunset Bar & Grill. Upon trying a bottle it was evident that this beer must be served very young and fresh, and does not travel well. Unfortunately they only come in green bottles, and the result is as bad as any skunky import."
"Presidente is popular in south Florida and the Caribbean. They are decent to help wash down a meal with, but there are better brews in that region."
"biÃ¨re blonde commerciale trÃ¨s claire, mousse blanche chimique sans envergure, biÃ¨re de grande chaleur, nez un peu maltÃ©, bouche maltÃ© aussi avec une finale courte. bonne biÃ¨re pour journÃ©e chaude sur une plage Ã  rio del plata."
"Well, it mentions corn grits on the label, so you have to know what to expect. It's thin, watery, and proud of its adjunct. I don't really like it here, and I don't think I'd like it any better at home in the DR. I'm not sure a slice of fruit in the neck of a bottle would save it either. I finished the bottle- please don't ask more of me than that."
"Prosit"
"If only it smelled a little better, maybe I would have been a little nicer in the rating."
"Bottle aboard the NCL Magestic. Clear yellow-gold color with a barely-there white head that is gone in a hurry. Spotty lacing. Aroma of straw and weak malt. Light-bodied and bubbly with notes of hay, corn and mild hops. The finish is relatively flavorless aside from some weak hops. Easy to drink is about the best thing I can say for it."
"This beer is more or less an over-glorified busch light. Though it has a bit more alcohol, it usually tastes pretty skunked. The light color doesn't really help it much as it leaves me wondering why it was only $2 a bottle at the bar. Then I found out. First of all, it was warm. So I gave it another shot cold a few days ago. Same result. Not very much taste of anything except a little skunky flavor. Very watery and a hint of light malt taste with a very light hint of some mild hops. Fairly drinkable as it does not have much taste of anything except the skunky flavor which knocks some points off. Overpriced and not really worth it at all."
"Presidente is a great ""south-of-the-border"" beer. I know most people on this site would say that it takes too much like a macro, but it doesn't. I am not judging this beer against belgians and other great beers. It is a pilsner. And for a pilsner, it is very good. It ours golden and crisp and has a fruity tint to the taste. Very good pilsner beer, perfect for sitting on the beach."
"Basic yellow golden color with a small foam cap. A clean lager smell, as long as its draft. Every bottle I have tried has had a bit of skunk (ahhhh, green bottles). The taste is again basic, clean macro flavor. Good body, light and crisp, just what you want on a hot tropical day. Nothing spectacular, but does the job."
"Fairly mild beer, would pair well with a mild cigar like a Macanudo."
"I would never drink it hear, out of fear that it will ruin my island memories; but somehow there it has a quality to make you forget anything else that I could get in the states. Fine beer, in context.."
"Drinkability- I would not got out of my way to get this beer but it is a good vacation beach type beer like most of the ones in the Caribbean."
"D-not the best beer in the world, they could stand to use brown bottles. The Imperial I had with this is clearly the winner and will be my choice if it is presented to me."
"If you go the the DR, while there, have the Bohemia and stick mainly to rum drinks and have good beer when you return!"
"Mouth feels dry after while having this beer, not the most refreshing one, worth a try but not to drink it often"
"D: Smooth and easy going down. Great on a hot day. Probably just a tad better than BMCs. I've got great vacation memories associated with this beer, therefore, I'm afraid to try it out of the bottle stateside."
"Interesting that this one falls in as an ""American Macro Lager," although not really surprising given the flavor. Tastes like an ever so slightly stronger version of an MGD or Labatt. Got this one at a Mexican restaurant after having a Negro Modelo - should have stuck with the former. This one pours a piss-yellow color, a little head and no lacing. Nose is mild grain, hops, and malt, and some skunkiness. Taste is about the same, a little stronger. Feel is what you'd expect for a macro. Overall, not worth the effort of getting a Mexican version because of the extra price."
"This was all they had at the resort where I stayed, so I drank it and never regreted it the following day(s). To me, that's drinkable."
"Pours a clear gold brew with a one finger head.Highly carbonated.Smells like a skunk.Tastes a bit sweet,but actually is really smooth.I expected something like a bud or coors but actually this is a lot better. I was impressed for a macro type lager.."
"drinkability - IMO its pretty drinkable especially in the hot caribbean ;)"
"Very light body....easy to drink very quickly...non-offensive....I would rather drink this than bud(and possibly corona), but other than that I can do with out....I figured why not at $1.79 for a 22oz....now I have drank a beer from the DR. cheers."
"This is a decent macro lager, with more malt and hop flavors than the american and canadian examples Ive tried."
"Presidente is another in a long line of forgettable pale lagers that every nation on earth seems to brew by the oceanful. It's a damn shame that the large majority of the world's people believe that this is what beer is supposed to taste like. I say we call for Presidente to be impeached. Actually, given that it's brewed in the Dominican Republic, let's make it a coup d'etat."
"Pale golden color. Almost a faded straw gold. Low aroma-just says ""beer"". Mellow malty flavor with a ""bite"" of bitterness to it. Has the ""snap"" of flavor I like in a macro-it isnt some tasteless watery nothing. Good body considering the style. Definately a drinkable beer. Bring on the hot weather for this one."
"If you are looking to pound a few back with your buddies, this is probably a decent alternative to some of the other macro lager beers out there. Realize that you are drinking a macro lager and review it as such. It is actually a decent beer."
"Pours a clear pale yellow color with a surprisingly nice fluffy head that turns into a small layer of white lace. Clean lagerish aroma that is a tad skunky. Clean and dry malty taste with hardly noticeable hops. Overall, this is a pretty boring and bland lager that I wouldn't recommend."
"Â¡Salud!"
"Slightly light-struck aroma, carried a touch in the flavor. Light, corny and cheaply made, regardless of the price-tag. Some fizzy astringency at the finish that did nothing to redeem the beer, even as a lawnmower beer. On par with lower-tier Mexican light lagers."
" The taste is mild, light colored malt, light hops, it is going very well with this pizza. Mouthfeel has a prickly, clean finish. This is the best beer of this style that I have ever had. Wish I could get it in Indy."
"Presidente pours a clear yellow with a fluffy white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is skunky, possibly hoppy, possibly skunked, it's hard to tell. Taste is hoppy, a bit metallic and overall not very good. Acceptable as lawnmower beer."
"The mouth is a bit thin, drinkable only in a pinch. Don't waste your time with this one! Over priced at a $1.50 per bottle."
"Taste is malty and a nice clean dry hoppy finish. Tastes like it is lower than the 6% abv indicated in the description. Extremely drinkable."
"Past note - IÂ’ve had many of these while in DR Â– they taste pretty damn good on a beach down there."
"This is a very very fresh bottle. Pours clear golden, with a decent head, but not the rocky pilsener head i would like. Streaming bubbles of carbonation. Smell is lightly toasted malt and very light herbal hops. Taste is pretty simple and light, toasted malts, light floral herbal hops, tiny tiny bit spicy. It's balanced well, but nothing earth shattering. Quite crisp and clean. Body is very light, effervescent, pretty spot on for a pilsener, maybe a tad thin. Poundable. Overall, pretty decent beer, could use a little more depth of flavor, but not bad at all."
"Though not a good beer, the balance is correct and with a few flaws, but none that kill the beer. Would be easily mistaken for a Coors if not for the light striken quality that eminates from the bottle. Pours a medium straw color with a white fizzy head that disipated quickly. Too highly carbonated. Smells lightly malty after the skunk aroma. A noticable grain scent, but no corn or vegetable aromas. Flavor is light of pilsner grains and perhaps cereal grains. Malt flavor gives way for a light bittering and alcohol flavor the prevails into the finish. Lightly dry and fizzy to the mouth. Though not distinguished, its a fair beer per style."
"Grainy sweet corn taste with a baby hop snap on the finish. Pilsner-esqe, but lacking quality ingredents. Nice drinkable level if you are in the sun and thirsty. I paired this with some salsa and tortilla ships and it worked well."
" The taste is crisp but astringent through the sip with no strong or particularly interesting flavors. The mouthfeel is reasonable but featuring a gritty sensation in the texture that I could do without. Not great, but definitely easy drinking. Overall, cool on the beach when I'm completely stationary and doing nothing but not too many other times."
"Poured with a medium, sticky head, decent looking carbonation, not too heavy. Smells quite skunky as I open the bottle, corn mash and a hint of wheatiness below. Taste is....surprising. The extra alcohol is definitely apparent in the flavour, but not overpowering. A thin wheaty taste. Not nearly enough body or complexity for my taste. Goes down awfully smooth though, would be an ok summer patio session beer, and infinitely more drinkable and flavorful than say, Corona..."
"I just can't finish it."
"Presented in a green 12oz bottle that I brought back from my trip to the Virgin Islands. Pours a clear golden straw color with a large, foamy head that subsides rather quickly. Rather still afterwards. Slight skunkiness when the bottle is opened, with further aroma of adjunct malt. Taste is not completely unpleasant, but not so good, either. Adjunct malt with a corny sweetness is about it - no hop presence to speak of. Very thin body. Glad I only bothered to bring one back with me."
"was headed to the Blind Tiger for Saison, ended up in the Bronx with the wife in a crap beer joint, Beer heavan to beer hell...oh well...., I could have worse problems...this stuff, was yellow clear and fizzy. no nose, min. head and min lacing. Adjuncts, water and very minor notes/hints of the existence of hops. Lawn mower brew, Domenican macro swill. Saison dreams tonight for me"
"I'd drink it if it were a lot colder and the day was a lot hotter, but otherwise I would probably avoid it."
"This is similar to a Mexican beer, it is light bodied, heavily carbonated, and tastes of corn adjuncts. Although it is a bit boring and adjuncts are present, it is refreshing. Comaparable to Corona, Kalik, Tecate, Sol and so forth and so on"
"A clean light yellow beer. Has a big white head. There is a spicey hop note behind the light grassy aroma. The flavor starts with the promise of a light malty character. This is a promise unfullfilled. The bitterness character is very light but has an unpleasant metalic taste."
"Very mediocare brew that lacks the power of malts."
"I first sampled this beer in the DR, 4 years back, and it was refreshing after a long day of collecting insects in the field. The beer comes in a green bottle. Not sure wha to expect. A stink escapes the bottle upon opening it. This doesn't give me much hope. It pours a clean, slightly golden yellow color with a 2 finger head. HAH. My wife is sitting across the room and she just said, ""EWWW...is that you beer?"" after catching a wiff of it in the air. The skunk is strong, dominating any other aromas in there. The flavor is rather bland, with a slightly sweet honey and grainey quality. It is refreshing, but not really something I will enjoy much. There is a really strange flavor on the finish. Its kinda like an anti-flavor. The feel is moderate with a very big carb. Overall, the nose really kills this one. The aftertaste is just not all that great. Overall, this was nice when I had it on the island, but after getting stung by half a colony of ants, anything would help. Won't be drinking this again soon."
"Not bad and surprisingly easy to drink. It was served in a 12oz bottle. The restaurant did not have a glass unfortunately. Looked over carbonated through the bottle. The aroma was the off-veggie skunk tone. The taste was not bad. Malts were sweet and pleasant while the hops (even though not really noticeable) did a fairly decent job balancing. Other flavors made me thick of the beach and nacho chips (corn?). The mouthfeel was nicely crisp, probably would satisfy nicely on a hot day. I would consider throwing a six-pack of this in the back of the fridge for August (but only consider)."
"In Santiago, Dominican Republic this is the best beer. Forget Coors, this is the coldest tasting beer ever :) They serve it everywhere and it is 80% of all beer sales and you can see why. It has a light lager smell and no hop presence. It is served at very cold temperatures with ice forming on the bottles as is all beer actually. It is golden and gives some head but who cares. This is bottle drinking beer and can be slung back all day while sweating away in the Dominican heat."
"Overall-while the wonderful Carribean surroundings that I drank this beer in have to be mentioned, for a foreign lager this stuff wasn't so bad. It was smooth and had a nice alcohol bite at the end, not a beer to change the world and certantly not complex, but for the style and the surroundings it does its job just fine."
"Viva El Presidente."
"It has a crisp malty hop flavor, that isnot overpowering."
"The appearance was fine, very Pilsner/Lager like, clear golden maize color. The smell was a little lame, a little old maybe, a little oxigenated, don't know. As far as the taste goes the beer was ""nice"". It tasted similar to a domestic version of the same beer, but slighly better. The mouthfeel was interesting in the sense that all sides of my tongue had a chance to enjoy it, almost a tickle. Quite drinkable. I wouldn't choose it over other styles, but as far as availability they can go down all day and all night if you understand!"
"I'd definately drink this over the more popular Corona for my taste of tropical beer. This is a much better beer."
"The mouthfeel is thin and weak.Starts of with some crispness but ends quietly. Drinakbility is unimpressive as I could not finish the lone bottle I purchased and the flavors are lacking."
"This didn't suck. It is mostly unimpressive but the taste is just a little above that. The funny thing is that I used to think this was a great beer, so I had to try one a new Mexican establishment in Wildwood, NJ. The place is great; the beer is not so great. This one looked okay and tasted better than a Bud."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability Â– This is right around the top of my SA beers. It went down easy, was refreshing in the middle of an 80+ degree Florida day, and didnÂ’t have any funky smells or flavors."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a white lace head. The aroma is skunky and weak. It has the feel of a Czech lager. It also has a nice mild hop aroma to it. There is the scent of pale malts and lager yeast. The taste is weak and watery, but not that bad. It lacks any malt character and has that Mexican zing to it although it's from the Dominican. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with way too much carbonation. It drinks well despite it's flaws."
"This is surprisingly a pretty easy to drink beer. Definitely made for hotter climates. It isn't at all that exciting of a beer, but it serves its purpose as a decent thirst-quencher."
"The nose is light and grassy, along with some husky notes. The taste is sweet with some trailing and unpleasant bitterness in the back. Slightly unpleasant aftertaste. The feel is medium with a fair level of carbonation. Drinkable hot waether beer for a strong thirst - not a fine sipping ale."
"Appears a light golden tone with a vibrant white head that leaves a nice evenly laced ring of foam. The aroma is a mild hop aroma with sweet lemongrass tones along with the corn and rice adjuncts to make this beer at a cheaper price. Well, I did pick up a sixer at around 2.50 at Chicken Charlie's in Little Washington, PA so it was a deal no matter what the beer is like. Sweet refreshingly crisp perfect for a Caribbean island. This beer was a staple during my trip to Key West, FL where it was a common ground to find in any local grrocery store. Corona doesn't even stand up to this beer so if you see it at a reasonable price pick it up. Light body with high carbonation that tickles the tongue. On a a hot day this would be perfect for chilling in the sun."
"Tip: no matter how drunk you get at the barcelÃ³, don't go having politically-related drinks like presidente+cuba libre....that 151 is poison!"
"Who let the skunk out? Very uncomplicated tinny hop smellfollows initial explosion highway crossing skunk. Lively continuous light carbonation, but no evidence on the surface. Flavor hints at a dust malt, and metalic hop, with a slightly dry finish. I've seen this beer hiding in television show and movie scenes. Go figure."
"With little to choose from but Coors Light and Budweiser, I usually opted for Presidente on a recent trip to Puerto Rico. It beats the US macros, but not by a wide margin. The color is a bit nicer, a slightly orange gold with a decent head. Corn is quite noticeable in the smell and flavor. Once accustomed to them, they do go down quite well on a warm day at the beach. I've never seen it on the mainland, but I wouldn't buy it if I found it anyhow."
"Clear. Golden in color with a bright white head that thins but holds surprisingly well. Even fresh from a case just delivered to the distributor, it's lightly skunked. Damned green bottles! The remainder of the aroma is lightly malty. The body is light with a very fine and effervescent carbonation giving it a zesty mouthfeel. The flavor is well balanced, starting with a clean, sweet malt and finishing with some very light hop flavor and drying bitterness. Surprisingly well made. With the exception of the skunkiness in the aroma, this beer could stand side by side with some of the best made American macro-lagers. Refreshing and enjoyable."
"Presidente:  from the Dominican Republic.  Very light bodied beer from South of the Border.  I expected a knock off of Corona, but this was not a Corona.  A fairly highly carbonated beer, with tastes dominated by adjuncts.  Very clean in the finish, with some alcohol tastes.  $1.99 for 24 ounces, in a cheap green bottle, not worth it."
"Notes: Bland yet bothersome, not a very well put together brew. If it was a bit cleaner and had a touch more malt flavour it would not be half bad. I donâ€™t recommend this beer."
