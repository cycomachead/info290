review_text
"Oh what the hell. Drank thisw for a short amount of time, wandered away from it. One of those beers that take son a different personality when doctored up with lime and salt, but unadjusted it is a fairly fizzy joint that lacks taste. What's there is corned up and barely bitter. Just not a good thing no matter how you slice it or spice it...."
"Pours and looks nice.  Rancid corn.  No smell."
"A little bit of lemon in the flavor and aroma, a pale lager after that, not very unique apart from the small impact of lemon flavor, although it is decent."
""
""
""
"My favorite Mexican import. Try it."
"To be honest here this beer has some horrible reviews because it is considered the garbage of garbage beers because it is cheap and people turn their noses to it. I honestly believe if the company relabeled the brand it would do pretty good. It has a miller high life taste to it, with a lemon zest after taste. I do not care for non dark beers but this one I love."
"O: better than I though.  Sub decent drinking experience.  2 and a quarter out of 5"
"Ok not great.  Good on a hot day."
""
""
"Made my review comparing to other Cervazes. Great color and smell, not as great tasting as Dos Equis Amber or Corona Firmiliar but not bad. A little too much carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Bad beer.  Would rather have a Bud."
""
""
""
"It tastes better than Corona."
"I don't have too much to say about this weak lager.  It tastes similar to other Mexican beers like Sol and Corona.  There isn't too much to this beer.  It's not the worst I've ever had, but it is definitely below average.  Surprisingly this beer rates better among BAs than Pacifico, which I thought was a much superior beer.  Oh well, to each their own.  I won't be returning to this one."
""
"Lite gold and thin white head disappears immediately. Bread notes and flavor. Lite, crisp mouthfeel. Easy to drink cerveza on a hot Florida day."
""
""
"In my opinion the best Mexican beer."
"Still better than many inexpensive brews for a hot afternoon."
""
"Good beer with some Mexican food"
"Tecate is a tricky beer, if you can get some made in the northern states of Mexico you´ll get a good beer. If you get some from middle or southern Mexico you´ll get something awful."
""
"Smooth, needs salt. Good chugger if in mexico"
"Good for getting drunk while your eating tacos in the Summer. That's it."
"Served in a Pint glass"
""
""
"It's that beer that don't taste so good but you'll end up keep drinking them."
""
"Taste is similarly bland and unassuming. Few of the rough edges found in its competitors but what's left over is ... Pretty hard to pin down. Might just be the most dull beer I've yet to sample. At least skunk tastes like something. There's a corn syrup sweetness and that's about all. Watery body that is oddly coupled with fairly mellow carbonation ... Usually thin beers are fizzy. If one really and truly focuses there's a grassy hop note. Shouldn't be this hard though. Far too sterile and stripped down, although some might rank it above its countrymen due to a lack of clear cut flaws. Its hard to criticize a performance when the performer takes no risks."
""
""
""
""
"Nice n crispy refreshing beer."
""
""
"Not terrible, but nothing special."
"Nothing nice to say about this beer"
""
""
"OVERALL:  this is the worst beer I've ever had, NAFTA was clearly a BIG mistake, I have never given a rating this low, If I finished mowing the lawn and had to choose between bottled water and Tecate, I would just drink water."
""
""
""
""
"Just bad. All around bad!"
""
"Better than Corona and Dos Equis and cheaper. I actually find it quite nice when it is ice cold with a lime. There are better lagers out there, but I'd give this a try. Personal opinion - try to find it in a can. These AAL's get skunky (and not in a good way) to me in bottles."
""
"No good.  Really, really bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as bitter as other cervesa"
"I freaking love this beer. Don't expect much other than a cheap mexican beer."
""
"Not bad, not horrible. I could drink this"

"Great session beer. Great refreshing taste"
""
"Mexican Economy class beer."
""
""
""
""

"The taste is also more malty than anything else akin to a German lager.  A clean finish.  There is nothing unique about it."

"Overall (3.07) : Not too impressed, and I liked Sol a lot better. Next time I reach for a Mexican Lager beer, I'll go for Sol or Modelo Especial. Those are my top two taco beers."

"Haha I'm a bit of a beer snob but tecate....tecate and I go way back. This beer is the best cheap beer in the market. Tied up with PBR. Best party beer when you don't wanna break out the good stuff ;) rub a little lime, salt, and cayenne on the rim of the can and have a good time. Best when chasing tequilas."
""
""
"OVERALL:  This is not the most terrible beer in the world.  It’s certainly not something I’ll pay for, but in a pinch, with no craft options, this could be an acceptable choice."

"I liked it at first but it got musty and left a grainy kind of feeling in my mouth. Smelled just how it tasted."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am no connoisseur but I really like this beer. I like a thicker mouth feel and this seems to be just right. I also don't like very bitter beer and this has only a hint of bitterness, enough to let me know it is beer but that's just about it. I find a depth to the flavor I don't know how to describe Carbonation is on the light side and I would have liked a little more. Like others mentioned, head is light, but that does not matter when you like to drink out of the bottle."

"Tecate brewed by Cervecería Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma, S.A. de C.V with an ABV of 4.5% This brew pours out amber color with a thick, white head. Tecate is a filtered brew; you can see right though it. This looks an American style lager. This brew smells like corn and grains. Nothing bad, but not good. I would say the smell is decent to this brew. The taste to this brew is real nice. It goes nice and smooth. This reminds minds me of an American style lager. There is nothing overpowering in this brew has a nice balance and taste. Mouthfeel is nice and clean and refreshing. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out 5. This better than what I was expecting. They did a real nice job with this brew. I will buy this brew again."

"In terms of MEXICAN beer, I think this is one of the better ones, along with Corona. It has a medium flavor background, in my opinion, and a good amount of bitterness, though not in an overpowering way. It's probably great with some yummy Mexican food and is perfect as an ""everyday"" sort of beer. Reasonably priced, too."
"I like this beer a lot. It's great to drink straight outta the can/bottle or adding some lime and/or salt to the rim. I love it with tacos, burritos, enchiladas, quesadillas, chalupas, rice, nachos, beans, re-fried beans, tortillas and salsa, and so much more. It is a perfect beach beer. Cold from the cracked styrofoam cooler as you lounge with some hot babes and the suns in your eyes. Drink some Tecate and then go boogie boarding. You'll love it."

"O - Very refreshing and sessionable lager. Cheers!"

"Overall, a decent if unmemorable lager. Better than the big(ger) boys!"
""
"Purchased as part of a variety 12 pack of Mexican beers. This beer is only a little better than the previous one (Sol), and is probably also a little better than a Corona (faint praise, indeed). I was looking for something a little lighter, and I've certainly enjoyed some Mexican beers in the past, but these are terribly bland. I suspect that they are intended to be spruced up with some salt, hot sauce, lime and/or tomato."
""
"Excellent medium Mexican beer that hits that pitch between light and heavy with a look that says the same. Good choice to have with a Mexican dinner, barbeque meal pairing or alone with a springtime/fall appeal for me. Light fragrance, agreeable, only a slight bite."
""
""
"O: Not much nose. Not much flavor. Typical Mexibeer."
""
""
""

"Many years ago, before I discovered the joys of craft beers, I used to drink Tecate (and Busch, but that’s another story) and really enjoyed it. When I drank this can, I was unpleasantly surprised by the lack of flavor and body – I remember this as a darker, chewier beer. Either the beer or my taste have radically changed, maybe both."
""
""
""
""
"This is a good beer at a good value. Tecate is a corn adjunct lager that blends the corn flavor with barley malt flavor in a unique and satisfying way."

"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 12 oz glass. Pours translucent straw with a nice white head, but it dissipates almost immediately. Smells of grain and corn, very sweet. Tastes of water and grain, very watery. Beer is very watery but good carbonation. Overall, a below average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: decent for the price."

"Overall: Not bad for a Mexican beer. Not quite Dos Equies but better than Corona"

"I'm all danked out. Having survived on nothing but high IBU IPA's for months, I bought a 12-pack of Tecate, wanting something cold and refreshing that serves it's duty then goes away without making a big relationship out of things the way IPA's are want to do. And for a fling, Tecate is the way to go. Crisp and slightly dry with soda crackers, toasted white bread and other innocuous starches being the main flavors detected. Finishes extremely clean, slight hop flavors but also no big adjuncts either. Corn/vegetable husk is not a discernible flavor. Possibly rice, which also may be why this brew finishes so dry. This beer gets low ratings because it is ubiquitous and macro, not because it tastes bad. One of the better warm weather beers you'll find, and surprisingly good."
""
""
""
"O - There are far better choices if you want a Mexican beer. This one is like drinking an AAL."

"O- Somehow this Tecate tastes better than any I've ever had before. I had many, and always enjoyed Tecate for what it is – a great, cheap, beach beer."
""
""
"Overall - Definitely not a favorite as far as Mexican AAL's go, it's passable."
""
""

"T: Malty, alcohol, and clean hop presence. I would not buy this regularly, but it beats a Bud, or any other Mexican Lager."

"O: Overall an easy-drinking and unoffensive beer that underwhelms."
"Tecate beer is part of the family's reunions over in México. so I cant be a little snob and choose what type of beer I want. Either you man up and drink it or go watch the kids and help out in the kitchen. Anyways, this beer has grown on me. although I prefer it from the bottle we mostly get in cans. its a strong bodied full flavor beer that will get you felling good within 2."
""
""
""
"Simply put, the beer is a beer pong beer. Something you don't mind spilling or wasting accidentally and things of that nature. The ABV is so low it takes me 10-12 to feel buzzed."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overal : This beer is not good. I take a Corona and Pacifico before this beer even a natural ice and icehouse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The feel is a bit less refreshing then other Mexican adjuncts but the flavors and scent are better so I feel it makes it better than so many others."

"In the final analysis, despite Modelo Especial's slightly more complex flavor profile, I might still choose a Tecate over a Modelo Especial. I'm a fan of crisp lagers and mild hop flavors, and, despite feeling somewhat watery towards the end, Tecate delivered in those two departments more than Modelo Especial did."

"O- There's no upside to this brew, and adding lime would be wasteful. I try to be open minded to this style (I like Corona and Landshark, for example); Tecate, however, is quite poor to me."
"O: I'm not sure how I feel about this one. The smell is horrible but the taste isn't as bad. Still, the flavor is full of adjunct and there is no detectable quality ingredients. I would only have this if it was this or Budweiser or Bud Light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With all of that said however, this beer will probably not win any awards at beeradvocate because it lacks any qualities or features that distinguishes itself from the average light lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, just your typical Mexican light beer, yet worse. At least they give you a lime with a Corona and Dos Equis has some darker malts to compensate."

"It's your typical Mexican beer... Light and only drinkable in a Mexican all inclusive resort at the pool side bar. With that said, since I walked into a bar in Arrlington, VA and was offered it for $1.00, I had to at least try it :)"

"Below average adjunct lager, sweeter, more use of corn, high on off-flavors and less crispy given lack of hops and low carbonation. Stay away, hard to get worse."
""
"I just had 3 Mexican adjunct lagers and they all tasted almost exactly alike, only saddle differences. These were even worse than the American versions. I would definatly avoid both at all costs! Don't waste your money even if you are in Mexico."
""
"Overall: It's a cheap way to get drunk with a group of friends or wash down some barbeque or party food. Not something I'd drink if I'm trying to savor the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"At first, pouring it out of the bottle is none too impressive. It has an adverse yellow look although it does create a fluffy white head with some lacing down the pint glass. The smell also we your average hoppy scent. Now for the interesting part - for pouring such a head the beer had very little carbonation feel in the mouth. It also had very little after taste, where I expected quite a bit. Speaking of taste. I enjoyed it immensely. Plenty of barley, a nice mix of malt (which these Mex beers specialize at, it seems to me), and just an overall taste that left me wanting for more."
""
"Final Thoughts: It might not be a fair comparison but this stuff to me is Corona done right. Make no mistake, an award winning beer it is not, and I'm honestly a bit perplexed at how they managed to give the hops that sandy accent, but all in all you could do worse."
""
""
"O- Overall, it's a below average beer. The smell and taste gave me a headache, not sure why. Other people might like it better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Have I seriously never had Tecate before? Hm. Time to fix that: This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a relatively short-lived finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mild corn, light white bread, and hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, with more hard water and a touch of toasted cornmeal. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a limp little beer, but one that avoids becoming entirely offensive."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall-better than Corona, not better than Pacifico. Great beer with Jalapeno Cheese Chex Mix. The beer was satisfying when my mouth was on fire. It is better straight from a bottle. It doesn't look good in a glass. It's just the type of cheap brew to drink while eating Baja fish tacos in a taco shack on the beach."
""
""
""
""
"I tried the canned version from a gas station.It is definitely better than Corona. But nothing to write home about. If someone brought a case to watch a game I'd drink it, but i would not buy it myself. Below average. Now to be fair, if it;s cold enough it can be very drinkable."

"overall . . . . heavier than the US version and much more enjoyed. an hispanic friend introduced this to me and it shows how different a beer can be from the 'export' version'. i can drink probably several of these as opposed to the US version which is thin, corn-y, pathetically disgusting. the natural, mexican version is a much heartier version of the beer and much more enjoyed. this is a much more enjoyable version than the typical US-purchased version.... salud!"

"The beer poured pale golden and clear. Its head was medium sized and white. Aroma had citricness, sweetness and vegetables. Palate was light bodied with medium carbonation. Flavours were corn, sweetness and bitterness. Aftertaste was sweet and mildly bitter. Not one of my favorites."

"Tecate: I never met a beer I did not like, but some I like less than others and the Tecate fits into the like less than other category. The Tecate has a golden color, ample carbonation and a weak head. The aroma is of corn mash, and having been in ethanol plants, I know what corn mash smells like. The flavor is watery, with a weak malt sweetness and no appreciable hop flavor or bite. PBR or Bud has this brew beat by a mile. I am surprised that there is enough demand for this beer to get a spot on the shelf."
""
"A watered-down brew. ""Inoffensive"". There are worst brews out there is about it. Reviewed keeping the style in mind."
""
"Poured this American Adjunct lager from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This lager poured a pale straw color, produced a thin white head, poor retention and below average amount of lacing left on the glass. The aroma of this lager has some suggestions of grain and hops- not much to talk about on that front. Light in body, the lager features some malted grain, some sweet notes, and just a touch of citric hops at the finish. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, slightly dry finish. Classic, low quality mexican lager, probably no better and no worse then the others. Something I tried once but won't buy again in the future. Prost!"
""
"Back in the late 70'S when I lived in Southern California, Tecate was a favorite beer. It was malty with a slightly bitter kick. My mexican-american girlfriend (who became my wife) taught me to drink it from the can and squeezing a lime onto the rim. On many a visit to Mexico we would enjoy Tecate with limes. After moving back to the East coast I would always keep cans of Tecate around to enjoy with Mexican food. Recently it seems to have changed to a hoppier formulation that has less malt, probably due to the use of the more cost effective hop extract most commercial North American brewers have adopted as a substitute to using real hops. In any case, we have stopped drinking Tecate and switched to other smoother adjunct lagers."

"glassware: Warsteiner pokal...occasion: unwinding after a Hazleton home visit...appearance: clear golden body; little,, off-white head; steady effervescence....aroma: perfumy, with a bit of corn and metallic ping... palate: heavy on the back end, with oily liquid--slightly bubbly, but not truly enjoyable, as other Mexican party bottles go...taste: almost tasteless, dry, crisp, but without distinction...overall: palate-cleansing but otherwise just another nacho rinser from the ""Mexican sampler"" I bought--pseudo thirst-quenching party fodder..."

"12floz. bottle. Lager glass. (From my notes: Bought at “Mexican Week” in a mall. Enjoyed at home). Pale straw color. Clear appearance. With froth. Minimal & brief crown. Adjunct aromas –corn, rice, grain…- & subtle maltiness to the nose. Herbal touch, too. Sweet malty flavor, no hoppiness. Crisp sensation. Light body. High carbonation. Sweetness lingers into a brief bitter finish. Watery texture. Easy drinkability."

"Pretty standard beer in my opinion. Doesn't taste much different than a Pabst except for the addition of some metallic flavor. I'm not a beer snob, I typically review beers based on how successful they would be at a party and everybody seemed to like this with no negative comments however it didn't wow anybody. Nothing great, But it's worth a try if you want something from the usual"

"Overall, not the worst Mexican brew. No sharp or harsh edges; not too corny or sugary. Some fair balance. A worthy option when options are limited."

"Pours a slightly hazy gold with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is pretty watery with aromas of grain, sugar, and metallic notes. Taste is pretty much the same and like the smell is watery. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer all around with nothing that would make me try this one again."

"Not great or even average."

"Taste similarly is lightly grainy, grassy/hay, corn. Mildly sweet. Light body, good carbonation. Pretty fair example of an adjunct lager, which may or may not be saying much. I added the lime to the remainder, why not."

"O-fizzy, yellow and wet not that good if you are looking for flavor. Mexican version of BMC just another macro brew"

"Light bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer can be gulped as easily as it is sipped. The body is light and playful, allowing the flavors to come through while keeping good drinkability. The carbonation is a bit less fizzy than some other beers in this category, which actually adds to the experience."
"Light bodied with average carbonation. Not worth saying too much about. Reviewed mostly so I remember not to try this again."

"ya know what? as the mexican cheapos go, i like tecate. its been described by my flatmate wilson as mexican gatorade, and with a lime wedge dropped right in the can, i agree. smells like a crappy lager, nothing else. flavor though isnt bad, some mild malts in their watered down form, and i guess the balance in there is hops, but its nothing distinguishable. mouthfeel is its savior, light and well carbonated its just right sometimes either when you are traveling in the southwest, on a budget, or its just flat out hot outside. it has a role to play in the beer world, and for that i keep it on the island. say what you will..."

"Light gold with a monstrous head that left in seconds leaving about two spots of lace. The aroms is of sweet corn and faint malts. The hops are somewhere in that mix. The flavor leaves you with the same impression. The body is watery and thin. Ok lawn mower beer."

"O - It's difficult to differentiate the flavours from the traditional Corona import I'm used to. Nothing spectacular here, just an easy drinking tropical destination bevy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I wasn't expecting much out of Tecate, and my expectations were set appropriately. For an Adjunct Lager, there's nothing really offensive about this beer and it's easy to drink, but in the end, its just a average American/Mexican style beer that has nothing going for it"

"I would not go out to buy this beer but would drink it when choices are limited. I would like to try a couple when its 90 out and humid and see if that if an influence. I don't have a lot of experience with the Mexican lager beers and think there will be better to experience."

"Its not a horrible ""macro"". Its malty, heavy, and skunky. Not the worst beer in the world, but I wouldnt buy unless I was in Mexico or it was the best beer available (which is the case here). Better than bud, but not quite as refreshing as carona..."

"I've had so much Tecate over the years, by itself and in micheladas, I can't believe I haven't reviewed it on this site .. So better late than never, for the style and price it can't be beat .. Definately have it in a can (or cold glass) but not a glass bottle. MUCH better than over-hyped Dos Equis Lager and you probably won't touch Corona or Sol again."

"O: I bought it once and will never have it again. My buddy told me to try it because it was good, but my goodness it was bad. I dont get how people love this stuff."
"Overall this is a pretty crappy beer. Bought a 1$ can just to try it so I guess you get what you pay for."
"D - A very average industrial lager. The corny character is noticeable, but not particularly unpleasant and the aroma is agreeable due to some light notes of malt and floral hops. It certainly beats skunky corona with a lime."
"Had this beer while in mexico for the baja race. OMG this is worse than Coors! nothing but carb water and a touch of hop and grains that just get choked down by the patron we were drinkin as well! would never drink this state side as my $ would be wasted on a drainpour"
"Final Grade: 3.06, a C+."
"The mouthfeel is thin and just what I need on a hot summer day. Or miserable winter day. Or just whenever I'm craving a Tecate."
"Certainly nothing to excite even the lager lover, but in a Mexican restaurant faced with the full range of Lites, this is not a bad option."
"O-a very easy drinking and not terrible beer. as far as lighter beers go, this is awesome. its not a kick in the mouth but its great when you don't feel like getting your taste buds raped."
"Light, crisp, refreshing…ish. Like club soda. Tastes like lime if you squeeze a lime in it. I pick up flavors of plastic from the serving cup. There’s a muted honey sweet note on the otherwise unremarkable finish. Eh. I’ll drink it if it’s there and my only other choices are BMCLonestar (this is Texas, after all!) but I could easily never ever have this again and not miss it. For Mexican Independence Day liberate yourself from crappy import lagers and drink something with real flavor. Viva Mexico!"
"TECATTTEEE"
"O: Sweet, light and easy to drink. More importantly this beer doesn’t taste like gross stale water. I’m not a fan of the style, but in a pinch this is a better alternative to most."
"Overall, not a bad mexican lager"
"Overall: Nat a good beer for anything but slamming a few at a party or something. Would never sit down to sip on a Tecate for the taste, that's for sure."
"Overall-When I have a hankering for an inexpensive 6 pack out of a can Tecate will continue to be a go to for me. I really enjoy this beer"
"I'm surprised how little I like this. Before writing this review I've already had half a case of these while in the pool this week, and I enjoyed them all quite thoroughly. Moral of the story, I guess: keep the beer in the can, put the can in a coozy."
"O- Not too bad for the style, I would prefer this over some of the Adjunct Lagers brewed in the US. Although, it still leaves a lot to be desired."
"Poured a 12 ounce can into a frosted mug at a local Mexican restaurant. I had to request the mug. They were out of the draft version. It was not easy to see the color, but it was a pale yellow with a mild head of foam. This was a mild lager with no noticeable aroma of corn. The flavor was had a mild bite of malt with a touch of hops. I enjoyed the beer. I skipped the lime."
"Mediocre, but better than most adjunct lagers."
"A red 16oz can. A decent lager, especially when compared to Corona and Dos Equis. Slightly fuller bodied and more flavorful than the others. This tastes like a real beer and not like cold, carbonated piss. This is the cheap summer beach beer for the masses."
"While not the best Mexican beer, it's good for drinking on the beach or by the pool. I'd take this over the dominant brand of Mexican beer every time."
"Crystal clear and pale yellow in colour with a fizzy white head that disappeared fast. Somewhat sweet in aroma, a bit of cereal, slight spiciness. Bitterness and malt sweetness were mild and there was a fruity character to it. Light mineral finish. More body than I expected, certainly not thin for the style, and the carbonation edged towards soft rather than crisp and aggressive. Quite dry. While I wouldn't buy this again, it was mostly inoffensive and fairly drinkable. Pretty decent when compared to others in the style."
"Tecate as in most Mexican beers taste best in teh summer with a lime...however, judging Tecate solo...its just another no frills cerveza! The beer poors golden clear with good carbonation that give a white foamy head for a brief time. The smell and taste are enhanced with grain. The hops help somewhat with teh taste so that it is not bread water. Mouthfeel is easy especially on hot days...enjoy!"
"Overall, this is a party/lawnmower beer in every aspect. Simply a cheap and not bad tasting beer that goes with most food."
"Overall, I don't know why I reviewed this other than everyone at work telling me how great it is, it isn't."
"The initial reaction reminded me of a typical American style lager, light, somewhat watery. I didn't get a lot from the sniff test, and after later sampling the same beer in a glass, the color confirmed my thoughts; very light in color, with a tint of amber, but more...yellowish. When it was ice cold, I wasn't totally disappointed, and in it's defense, it's hard to keep a beer that supposed to be cold, well cold (when it's 90 degrees). Overall, in taste, I put it slightly above Sol (very similar), but below Corona, and Modelo."
"Booze delivery system, cheap and hardly with it."
"Not a lot going on here, no big surprise, but, as expected, it matched with the food just fine, i.e. didn't mess with the simple and pleasurable south of the border cafeteria-style offerings, especially once I went with, natch, the top end of the spicy salsa spectrum. Same deal as years ago, slamming this back in a more or less equivalent joint in downtown Las Vegas, for a buck a beer, at the time."
"As much as the taste improves that nose is just disgusting and I'd grab something else before having this thing. It is very easy drinking I must admit, but real sweet too."
"Overall not my favorite Mexican lager. It's ok though."
"flavor. Thats fine. Ill keep my flavor"
"Overall, why waste money on this? Skip it."
"O: Its not bad, but nothing special. A cheap beer that comes in cans. Easy enough to get when in Mexico, and overall middle of the road for easy to get Mexican beers."
"Special thanks to the IRIS interns for donating this to me."
"This is a stereotypical American-style lager, of which I'm partial, with a thick, white head, and a very clear, golden color. Carbonation is high. The aroma had a slightly off grain smell that I was unable to place. But, as I drank it it was not as prominent in the glass. The taste is okay, with a decent barley-grain-hop balance. Mouth-feel is light and watery and it finishes crisp and refreshing. Certainly, this is an ordinary type beer, but I'd say it's as good as other run-of-the-mill lagers. I think you should try it. I drank this sample poured from a 24 oz. can."
"Likely better from the can where the weak aroma is not a factor and the carbonation would stick around a bit longer."
"Overall, don't mind it, it's not skunked, I'd have again if it's the only thing there..."
"Overall perhaps a decent ""lawnomower"" beer, but certainly not one to purchase for the love of beer itself."
"Had a couple of these ice-cold, and I do mean ice-cold, out of the cooler after a recent backpacking trip, and they were delicious. I am admittedly biased towards refreshing beers over heavier beers, though, and love me some cervezas Mexicanas as well, perhaps because I am a Southern California guy. At any rate, this is a nice beer for many occasions: the ballpark, after a hike, or to wash down a meal. Disfrutalo!"
"Overall: Another beer to file under the ""lawnmower"" category. This would be pretty refreshing in 95 degree heat, but that's about all it has going for it. Not worth the import price of $13 a 12 pack, there are plenty of equal alternatives for a better price."
"Overall its not bad, not something I would buy a six pack of but if I'm somewhere out and thats all they have, sure I would drink it."
"Another ""fine"" choice on the mini tour at Old Chicago. Poured the typical yellow fizzy stuff with little head. NO aroma and, again, too sweet of malt. I guess swet (corn) malt is a must have for these brews; not offensive but, again, nothing I'd go out of my way to have again. I'll keep doing the mini tours to keep the shirts going (since '92) but..."
"It smells like metallic cheap cereal grains. It tastes a bit metallic and a bit like cheap wet cereal grain. It isn't sweet at all. It has a hint of bitter hops even. So, that's a plus, but overall it's not very good. I'd consider Sol to be better. This is a lot like Busch, but more bitter and with a bit more flavour."
"Yeah, look, it is what it is. And what it is is bad beer."
"Much like any other traditional lager. Minimal color, taste and quality. poured into a glass and watched the head disappear rather quickly. The aroma of malts are there but not much else. It's got a nice drinkable body to it, but still nothing overly impressive."
"watery , very light,"
"Poured from a can while at a resort in Mexico. The beer pours a crystal clear yellow-gold color with thick, bubbly white head that vanished quickly. Smells a bit musty, with slight sour tones, malt, and corn. The beer is light, round and crisp in mouth, with toasted oat and malty flavors. Aftertaste is musty, and lingers a bit. It leaves a slight film in mouth. Nothing remarkable, but when in Rome..."
"Goes down with the sounds of Brazilian jazz artist Airto Moreira and Flora Purim."
"I poured a 12 oz can into a clear plastic cup. The beer was a pale straw yellow with a pretty big white head. Smells like grains and corn with as hint of lime. Tastes kind of salty, mettalic and bready. The beer is watery, it is refreshing in the heat. Drinks like water."
"So over all I think Tecate Beer is very good and pretty smooth. I really liked the flavor, and I thought the beer was strong enough to give me a nice buzz. This is one of the best beers on the market. If you have not tried it yet, go get a pack! They are worth the money. Long live Tecate Beer!"
"After 2 beers of doing this the feeling is lost so go to drinking it straight or better yet go to drinking something stronger."
"Drink - Nothing special here but also nothing offensive. For the price is a fairly drinkable beer - you could do worse for sure."
"Pours a very light straw color with a thick white head and very little lacing. Smells of corn and hay and a little sweetness. Tastes much the same, some corn, hay and some sweetness. Mouthfeel is okay with a ton of carbonation. Drinkability is medium, its not the worst of its style."
"D- very drinkable if u dont mind it being pretty much flavorless. For the style it aint terrible."
"Mazatlan 1998, baby! Average fizzy white head that mostly diminished. Spare lacework. Clear sparkling body with a pale yellow color. Aroma of cardboard and hay. Over the palate came light caramel and hint of grainy feel. Light bodied with an average carbonation and thing light dry texture. Light sweet flavor with a hint of bitterness. Light malty sweet finish."
"Tecate provides. Like a bad movie with cheap thrills. Yum."
"Pours a light amberish color with some slight scents of grain and malts. Has a very light taste with the only main elements that I can pick out are grassy grains and some malts. Very silmilar as cheap mass produced domestic beer. Something new to try if you haven't had it before, but no taste here as it is very bland."
"drinkability: i wouldn't buy it again. it's like 12 bux a 12 pk. i can buy something better for less."
"Drinkability: selected this with a mexican meal. It did not pair well with the spiciness. Boring beer overall."
"d- easily chugged"
"D- Drinkable to be sure. But I don't really want another one any time soon."
"One finger snow white head, lace broken and little cling. Color is a 5 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell of wet corn, and malt. Taste is of corn, and malt. Much water feel in my mouth. This beer was given to me by a friend, and I doubt I would ever pay good money for another."
"D: Low ABV and easy to drink by not much here, pretty average overall..."
"Served with lime and salt it's fine for Mexican food, but mostly the additions make it taste like salty limes."
"Interesting session though! Cheers!!"
"side notes:growing up mexican in southern california ive drank this beer alot if you can get it in mexico its better, its probably best served ice cold and with some lime and salt and/or chilie powder. beware if you drink too many of these they can deal a hangover that can make you throw things up that you ate in high school."
"I kept seeing this on the shelf at the liquor store and didn't know what it was. Instead of looking it up, decided to pick it up to give it a try. Pours an almost clear pale yellow colour with fairly big white head that dissipates leaving almost half an inch. Some spotty lacing. Smells a bit off, vegetables and grains. Flavour is almost non-existent. I may as well be drinking carbonated water. I suppose the carbonation level is actually quite nice. Basically the beer is nice to look at and it has a nice mouthfeel, everything else about it is pretty bad."
"D: This was always my least favorite of the Mexican lagers that I'd had and this can reminds me why. Just no good."
"D- Since I've moved on to better beer, at the most I'd have to slam down this stuff when its really cold. Although its better than Budweiser, Coors, and Pabst."
"D: Although not the most impressive beer around, it'd make an OK (at best) beach beer; I wouldn't recommend it for any other occasion."
"After the initial review, I went with the fresh lime squeezed/rubbed on the lip of the can and sprinkled with sea salt (ala Tony Bordain). It was really refreshing (though I can't give bonus points for a beer making a good cocktail). It went really well with tacos doused in habanero salsa."
"They serve this a lot in Rosarito Mexico which is the first place I ever had it. Now years later I still enjoy it from time to time as my go to pale yellow Mexican lager. It's not bad by any respect but certainly isn't gonna blow you away. It's pale yellow, fizzy and tastes like corn. Not offensive like some other Mexican brews, ahem (Corona) ahem. Good for washing down some beef jerky which is what I'm using it for right now, or a home cooked Mexican meal."
"This beer is not just simply good, but very enjoyable as a light beer."
"D: Highly drinkinable, nothing more than a good easy to drink beer with spicy food, really no dimension."
"Pours an almost clear golden straw color with cap of frothy head, gone quickly with no lacing. Scent is of musty grass, hint of mildew. Taste does not improve on the qualities of scent much, musty and grassy with no real hints of good ingredients. Light bodied, overly carbonated. A poor AA Lager."
"It is easy to drink though.."
"I grew up drinking Tecate in my family so maybe that's why I think its not the worst beer out there. I like the taste of it when its nice and cold in a bottle and to make it way better add lime and salt. Plus its really not that expinsive to buy. Just give it a chance you'll end up liking it."
"I guess with some spicy food or a hot day it would be doable, but for your average session I would pass. I will admit I do not think it should be in the bottom list, I have had much worse."
"Pretty darn boring to say the least. Ice-cold Tecate is a useful utility in certain situations, but do yourself a favor: suck ice and leave this for the beezies. That is, the insect variety, they effing love this stuff. Trust me, your spring break experience will be much better for it."
"Usual mouthfeel for the style and it's fairly drinkable and when I say that, I mean when it's good and cold. I don't want something like this to warm up..."
"I might have this again if it were free and I was in a hot and sweaty cantina w/ no ventilation. Nonetheless, Senior Tecate, I see no reason to converse with you anytime soon, not even over chips and salsa, adios."
"I will never buy this stuff ever again. I would rather drink Corona."
"Let's face it, this beer won't be winning any awards any time soon. However, for a beer to quaff during the summer, it fits the bill."
"D- Average drinkability. I could see having a few of these at a time, likely why they are cheap and inexpensive."
"Way too pricey for what it brings to the table."
"D- Not bad for an adjunct. Better than corona, i'd say. one must always remember to rate to the style, so while this beer may not be great, for an adjunct it's tolerable enough."
"cheers"
"Overall/notes: Drank this last night while sitting on the balcony looking out to the ocean. It was a pleasant overall feeling. As an American Adjunct, this gets the job done just fine. Certainly more acceptable than Corona."
"A million poets working for a million years could still only describe but three eights of this beer's repulsiveness. It completely eclipses anything bad that has ever been said about Corona. Feel free to recognize the things written here as just my own opinions, but heed them as warnings and proceed to ignore them at your own risk."
"Drinkability: Potable but not enjoyable. Perhaps this beer is better in the extreme heat of Mexico."
"D: Given its status as a cheap-ass macro swill brew by Mexicans and its ""what's that?"" factor amongst your friends at a Mexican joint, you can;t be faulted for going there. I've seen it cheap enough for sixers in stores where I'd get it over Corona to bring to a Mexican-theme party or something, but the buck stops there. Fine for what it is, the Mexican High Life."
"d. it goes down just nice but still the taste factor isnt there!"
"d- not great here, but that is what i was expecting. you don't buy tecate for classy, refined enjoyment, it's a hot day gulper. thats about it."
"Drinkability: Blehh... This beer is terrible. I would actually rather drink American light macro swill than this abomination. This beer clearly serves only one purpose: inebriation. Don't even bother. There are better-tasting beers to get drunk on."
"D: Tecate is definitely an easy-drinker, but I wouldn't say that the drinkability is very high, since I think I could get the same flavor by blending a shot of vodka, a piece of cornbread, and tonic water. Maybe this would be a good beer for a scorching hot summer day floating the river, but aside from that, this beer has no purpose."
"D: Unappealing and lackluster beer. It's tough enough just to get through one bottle."
"A few shades darker than a typical straw-colored adjunct lager, thing white head that doesn't stick around. Smells very light, of corn and grass and hardly any hops/malt. Taste is light and watery but somewhat bitter in a way not reminiscent of hops. Carbonation makes it a bit tougher to drink when it overpowers nearly any beer flavor it has but the corn and vegetable/grass flavors are still ther - it isn't an offensive taste, just very light and wholly unimpressive. I was reluctant to finish one while drinking it without food, though it seems like it could be a decent beer to accompany some spicier foods, it just lacks good flavors of its own."
"Pouring a light yellow with a dense white head with decent retention, this looks acceptably good. No real lace, though. The nose is rather bad. Vegies and corn, this has no hop character (none expected), no malt, just nothing but some corn and vegies. The palate is the same and arguably worse. Vegies, corn and watery thin with no flavor of any significance, and an awful, watery finish with a lingering nastiness. I could not drink more than 2 sips of this."
"Overall this beer isn't anything special. I'd say it's just another macro lager."
"Felt good on draft at my local Mexican restaurant. Decided to pick up a 12 at Kroger for 11.99. Chilled for about 5 hours with my Budweiser. Good beer. A good complement to chips, pretzels and even shrimp. Took a moment to get past the smell, but after that, good, clean and drinkable. Beats Corona by a longshot."
"Picked up a six pack for an impromptu Cinco de Mayo dinner at my house. Poured into a standard pint glass. Pale yellow colored body. Quick fizzy head quietly faded fast. Surprisingly, there was a bit of lacing on the glass. Smell was not really there at all. Flavor has mostly just an adjunct lager. Corn and malt were the only real discernible flavors. Mouthfeel was smooth but very watery. Though....it was pretty smooth going down, and it didn't have a skunky or boring Mexican beer flavor. Actually tasted like a fresh lager, so I'll rate the drinkability a bit higher. Went nicely with a meal of grilled chicken fajitas. Since this six pack was almost a $1 cheaper than other south of the border options, it was not a bad choice at all."
"Drinkability- Would drink again considering it is a cheap import beer"
"D - I would consider this the coors of Mexico -nothing I want to consume again really,but if you are only looking to quench your thirst perhaps this would do. It has nothing to really separate it from the legions of other mass produced lagers IMO."
"Thin and grainy, drinkability is ok."
"Not really meant to be anything more than a beer to drink on a hot day after mowing the lawn. Even though hefeweizens or witbiers would be the refreshing beers of choice for me."
"Beer has a straw yellow color with a light head and moderate carbonation. Smell was a generic & bland. Taste was light and refreshing. the finish was a bit watery and went down easy. This is a drinkable beer, minus the lemon of course and the price is also a factor."
"Mexican beer should only be compared to mexican beer. When a country's water has the reputation that Mexico's has, one shouldn't expect the beer that's produced there to be on the same level as other beers from around the world. That being said, this is the salt and lime beer. They go down like water and all of a sudden you can't walk much less drive. Good for getting wasted but thats about it."
"Pours a very transparent light straw with just a bit of fizzy head. Can see a lot of carbonation in the beer. Smell is not particularly strong - it's the usual grainy Mexican beer smell. Taste is... beer-flavored. Sort of. Carbonation is very forward, a little bit of malt in the aftertaste, and in the middle it might as well be seltzer. All told, there's nothing to offend, because there's really not much of anything at all. You could drink a lot of it, I guess, but that's about all it's got going for it. That and price (it's the only import going for less than $6/6-pack at my local supermarket)."
"Tastes pretty good, especially with a homemade bean and cheese tostada."
"D- extreme thirst or a party would both be incentives to drink this stuff and it's thin body and lack of flavor lend it refreshing qualities. I see why people add a lime but on that note, I'd prefer a corona."
"D- I don't think I'll ever be able to drink more than two ounces at a time of this ""beer""."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Just your run of the mill macro lager. I can barely tell the difference between Tecate and other brews of the style, including Dos Equis. Not worth it. If you're going to drink it, do it quickly and make sure it's cold."
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is a half inch in height, and recedes within seconds into no lacing. The aroma is of faint bready malt with a hint of grassy and floral hops. For an adjunct lager this is actually a really nice aroma, and has solid complexity. The taste is like the aroma, but a little milder. There is still nice complexity, but it would be nice if it came out a little more as it did in the aroma. The mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a very pleasant surprise. It has a lot more complexity and flavor that most beers in its style, and it very easy drinking. I will certainly drink this again."
"Why is it the more beers you sample the worse a certain beer gets? A few years ago Tecate tasted fine. Did they change the recipe once they merged, or have my taste buds grown and developed? Perhaps its a bit of both. There is a definite ""Mexican"" taste in the beer's finish - somewhat similar to Corona, but more pronounced. It is the finish that saves this beer from just being another Miller or Budweiser. On a hot day it is drinkable - especially after you've had too many to care what you are drinking. Pouring it out of a can into a Pilsner glass brings out more flavor - highly suggested that you do NOT drink it straight from a can. Had the beer in Mexico in a bottle a few years back and it seemed to taste better. Again - recipe change? Bottle vs. can? Who knows... At least it isn't as pricey as it used to be!"
"Light and smooth on the palate. More bland malt on the palate with a bit of bitterness at the end. This beer has a certain stale quality to it that I did not enjoy. Probably will not drink again."
"A pleasant surprise is that the body is a wee bit fuller than expected. Drinkability is typical, it just flows right down the throat. If you don't approach this brew with any great expectations, you won't be disappointed."
"Not bad when drunk cold. Mostly can pick up barley malt flavor with some cornyness. No hops to speak of. Lots of carbonation. Too sweet for my taste but not to the point of being cloying."
"Well, simply put it's a run of the mill cheap drinkable beer. It's light, not much head to it on the pour if any at all. I put lime and salt in it to ""add"" to the flavor. Wouldn't drink it without the two. I prefer this to corona, which I hate. I could drink these if I wanted to get drunk and not drink BMC. I would call this a classy college beer. lol."
"Simply put, if going for a Mexican beer, i prefer this to Corona. I am still putting Modelo and Negra Modelo as my preferred Mexican beers, but Tecate will do in a pinch. I prefer mine with a bunch of lime and a touch of salt - Chelada style. It hides the mediocre beer that inhabits this can."
"Had this at some tavern on the lower east side, got it as a special, a shot of tequila and a can of tecate. Appearance is a straw colour and both the smell and taste are citrus-y, somewhat better than your average adjunct lager. However, the mouthfeel is a little too light. If I was in a warmer climate and I had a choice between this and BMC, I would take the Tecate, but I greatly prefer a Bohemia, a Negra Modelo, or even a Carta Blanca."
"I don't feel regret leaving beers like this behind and next time I see one of these in a fridge curiosity will not tempt me again but I don't find it as horrible as some seem to (although I'll admit I only finished enough to complete the review). I'd put in on par with PBR which seems to get love on this site for reasons I don't understand."
"D: I wound up running into another beer nerd at the party, and he told me this was his favorite of all the macros. I haven't had any in years, but I thought the whole point of macros was that they are flavorless, not actually bad."
"Ordered a bottle for $3 at Papa Gallo and poured it into a pilsner glass. This clear gold lager had a distinct roasted corn and husk flavor, which isn't off-putting, but isn't the most pleasant taste. I give this brew credit for actually having flavor. And at $3 for a decent restaurant, it's also not a bad option between tequila drinks."
"The aroma is light hops and a lot of skunk. The taste is basically the same. The mouthfeel is less than water, is that possible? Drinkable is ok but what's the point with the abv."
"D - If someone serves this absurdly cold, it might be palatable. I just don't know if you could get it that cold without freezing it altogether."
"D-Low. Wouldn't even be good on the beach. Didn't finish this one."
"I wouldn't go out of my way for this one. It's pretty ""average"" in every way. I envision this as the Mexican-man's Budweiser. Nothing remarkable but nothing truly offensive. Pale light yellow with minimal head. No real strong smell to pick up other than some hints of corn and malt. Taste is so-so. Mouthfeel is watery and boring. It's ""drinkable"" but I wasn't impressed at all."
"D: I can't even say this is good in a pinch since there are at least three other beers I would pick over it and which are cheaper."
"Drinkability: sadly, the overall nastiness of the flavor brings the drinkability way down. Sure, it's a light lager suitable for outdoor work, but damn, it just ain't good."
"D - Well, it's light and crisp, but then again, it also tastes terrible. So drinkability is not very good."
"Would not turn one down but not worth the money to keep stocked in the fridge."
"Lost my detailed notes on this one. Suffice to say, this is below average beer, even by Mexican beer standards. Started off nice, with a clear yellow color and an impressive bit of head (with even more impressive retention), but that was the best of it. Smell was sweet, full of corn and grains and the taste was no better. Just more sweet corn, rice, straw, and grains in general. Lighter body with heavy carbonation."
"Drinkability is good. Decent Mexican Lager, goes down easy, and is refreshing."
"Surprisingly poor, especially now that this popularly sells at the same price point as the regular BMC crowd. I love my Mexican friends, but this only sells because they slap a Mexican flag on it."
"Had it at Uncle Julio in Virginia. It was the closest beer to water (beats even Fosters lager), had to migrate to Negra after this. Medium carbonation and amazing waterlike mouthfeel and tatse. Only good part is that you can keep chugging at it without feeling a thing I guess."
"Not too bad if served ice cold with a plate of greasy Mexican food."
"D: Goes down pretty easy, after all it is pretty light, but the taste isn't good enough to make me want a lot."
"Nothing special but extremely refreshing on a hot day."
"Drinkability - I hinted my feelings about it above. It's the right beer with Mexican (maybe the only one in my book) but outside that class of food, there are better."
"D - I find this one really easy to drink and don't mind it at all on a hot day or when I'm eating junk and watching TV. It doesn't taste particularly good, but it's definately not bad and tastes better than water."
"Not a bad thirst quenching beer on a hot summer day. Light body with a dry finish."
"Tecate: This is a good Mexican lager for a hot day. Drank it from the can, just like when I was on a Mexican beach. Golden color, minimal head, lots of carbonation and often served with a lime and some salt. Im not a huge fan of adding any lime and salt to any beer so i didnt get any topping. Its a thirst quenching beer but dont perfer it when there are so many other great Mexican beers."
"D- Definitely better than Corona, IMO. Not bad stuff, better than most other adjuncts."
"D- Overall, I'm not a huge fan of this one and will probably stay away from it in the future."
"D: This beer is incredibly bland and watery. If your looking for crap Mexican beer there are much better alternatives. It's not offensive in anyway, just very boring."
"From a brown 12 oz. bottle. Pours a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Aroma is very mild, some hints of corn. Taste is also mild, some corn and malt flavors. Feels light and crisp in the mouth. Drinkability is average. Overall this is a mediocre brew."
"Notes- Decent mouthfeel and drinkability"
"T- Kind of watery. It has a grain/corn kind of taste to it, but really nothing there. No real taste that jumps out. But it's not bad and is probably my favorite mass produced Mexican beer."
"Light bodied with prickly carbonation. It's like slightly beer-flavoured water. Meh. I'd rather drink Modelo."
"I'll pass next time..."
"D- Drink one, drink two... what the hell. Its cheap, its a Mexican beer. Think outside of the U.S. think Tacate."
"Andy"
"D- Best on a hot day, when you need something ice cold to quench your thirst. A wedge of Lime doesn't hurt the taste."
"Finish: Dry finish with bitter aftertaste, some metallic notes and aftertaste."
"This is a very refreshing Mexican lager. If you want beer taste though, I would look elsewhere."
"This is a very unpretentious adjunct lager. the working man's beer of Mexico. Looks like a typical Mexican lager: pale yellow with a crisp white head. For what it is, it is fine. A little more hoppy than most of its competitors and doesn't have that awful Corona taste."
"D 4.0 - THis beer is okay for a budget brew. Similiar to a Miller HIgh Life in taset and price. You can get this on the cheap at $10 for a 12 pack of cans."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer is light bodied. The carbonation works well with the beer. This is simply another alcohol delivery system."
"D-Hate to say it, but better w/lime and salt. This one is the low one on the totem today, and we've had some good times w/this one in the past, but it's not too tasty w/out some help."
"Bought these to refill the bottles with home brew. At $2.50 a quart bottle, well worth it."
"Taste is pretty watery with a hefty corn presence mixed with some husky grains. Not as bad as I remember Tecate being. It has more flavor than the typical mexican lager, but it is not the best of flavor profiles."
"I considered giving this one some credit for its light, regular lager brand appeal, but I wouldn't really want to play beer pong with it. Even in its hometown in Mexico, don't people there prefer Bud Light? Does Tecate advertise and market itself well like the ""King of Beers?"" I'm just trying to figure out how/why a beverage like this makes such a long trip."
"A pale golden color body with a short fizzy head,no lacing left,light carbonation. Aroma of grain husks,cooked corn and a hint of hops.Flavor is grainy,biscuty,more of the corn,slightly sweet intially,with just a hint of bitterness,and skunk but not in a bad way. Light body,crisp clean mouthfeel,dry lager type finish. Quaffable and not offensive,,, meh another Pale Lager."
"D: Scores points for being inoffensive and respectably grassy/herbal on the tongue. Loses a few of them for a substandard malt profile, even for a mass-produced lager. Drinkable and refreshing. Nothing to write home about, but for the genre, pretty decent."
"D: it's pretty light bodied and bland so it's pretty easy to drink"
"D- Goes down easily, but so does water. Better than the light north American macros, which it resembles."
"yet really refreshing."
"The Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma Brewing Company is well capable of producing a good lager when it sets its mind on it, but this emblematic brand seems to be produced en-mass and as cheaply as possible."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, strong adjunct aroma, and very weak malt note. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of adjunct up front and then some yeast cleanliness comes through. Overall, the not a very strong flavor, but also no strong adjunct aftertaste which is a plus."
"D; pretty drinkable in the warm weather here in Phoenix."
"D - that's the whole idea. Something light and crisp for a summer day. It meets that goal head-on."
"As I said, it's like a Corona turned into a better drink. It has a better taste, smell, well, better everything. It's not exactly an amazing drink though."
"D - Better than the American macro lagers, but still has a ways to go before hitting the big time of such lagers as Session or Red Stripe."
"Not a bad beer. Simple and quite drinkable for the style. It's certainly one of the nicer adjunct lagers I've had."
"Nothing amazing here and taste a lot like other mexican beers."
"D. This one goes down easy enough. I picture a generic can of beer labeled as such: ""BEER"". I could drink this or most of the similar clones but, why bother? Answer: becuase it was a free non-skunky new-to-me beer!"
"Drinkability: El yawno! A boring and altogether bland lager to pair up and down with Mexican chow, I suppose. I'll have to search the freezer for some taquitos!"
"Average mexican brew. Thirst quenching on a long day on the links or the beach when in the neighborhood, not really worth seeking out above the 49th."
"Pretty not much. Huh...I'm yearning to switch this for a real beer...ah, real beer...I just can't LIVE! Without You!"
"Drinkability is better than average mostly due to the 4.5% abv. Fairly refreshing when served cold. I think it would go well with spicey Mexican food."
"I got this with a variety pack from World Market. I had this beer with a Thai dish and it actually was a very good match with it. It had decent appearance pouring yellow with a ok head that did stay around longer than i thought it would. This was not a great beer but it was good with the Thai dish."
"For some reason, this is far, far different and better. Pours clear gold with a decent white head. Moderate lacing. Sweet cornmeal, sugar, and the metal is replaced by grass. Smooth, sweet taste with actual grassy hops. Dry finish."
"The pour gives it a nice head that quickly dissipates . A Pale Straw color with lots of effervesces. There is little smell, I could pick up a slight hint of citrus, wheat and yeast. It has a yeasty tastes with a bumpy finish Overall it is semi smooth and easy to drink"
"D. Even for an adjunct lager this is pretty poor. I will not be having another, glad I just bought a single. Do not attempt to pair this with seafood, or anything else for that matter."
"An ok summer brew when ice cold, outside of that I dont think i'd ever go out of my way to get my hands on it."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - One could drink this all night long, nothing special, kind of just another vegetable/corny Adjunct brew. Easy to toss back, one of the smoother liter macros out there. Refreshing I suppose, but nothing special."
"D: I used to think the Tecate and Corona were on par with one another. I was wrong. This is the better beer. It's nothing special, however. But it does go well with Mexican food."
"Cheers"
"Overall for the price, which is really cheap, this is one of the best mexican beers I've had, next to Negro Modello, just a cheap, straight forward beer. Highly recommended!"
"22oz can bought at Smiths. Pours a clear golden hue with a small white head. A decent aroma of corn and sweet malts. The flavor is decent; lots of sweet malt, straw and corn. A light hops perhaps in the finish. Not bad at all, but not good either. Just a OK drinkable lager."
"Tried this at Acapulco's Mexican Restaurant. The beer poured a clear pale yellow color, though darker than a corona with minimal white lace. Relatvely clean aroma, virtually nothing in the scent other than a faint grain and corn girt smell. Intense crispness in a light body, clean palate with a thin grain flavour throughout. Some corn grit and light hop bitterness rounded out this brew and its dry finish. Not a bad beer - preferable than a Corona."
"The taste is grain with a hint of bland, fresh green apples, faintly sweet with the faintest hint of bitterness in the finish. It's really very bland and a bit watery, but clean, crisp, and pleasant. This is one beer that even I say really is better very cold, when i makes up for lack of flavour with a very clean, refreshing hoppy crispness. With food and warmed, its character tends to become more grassy and bitter to the exclusion of other traits, but not terribly so."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"D: Tecate is just another mass-produced beer with little or no personality. The taste is simply nondescript. Pass."
"Drinkability- Not bad, its a decent macro lager and if your south of the border you can do much worse!"
"The beer poured a clear light golden yellow with a very light, highly carbonated head that was not well retained. This was probably the best part of the beer. The aroma was very thin corn-ish aroma but also had a slight sweet hint to it The taste was not good. Very weak, thin, again with the corn and also a grain flavor. I could barely get the one down. The beer was way over-carbonated and felt very light. I could only drink one and I am glad that we finished off that 6-pack, yet it took about 3 weeks. Overall, not a good beer. AVOID!"
"You could slam a good bit of this. typical for a macro lager, but not very desireable. I'm sorry I wasted $2 on it."
"This beer poured muted yellow with a very small head and plenty of visible carbonation. The smell is faint, with a bit of buscuity yeast and corn. The taste is mostly sweet malt with tiny bit of hops in the midpallate and a fairly crisp finish. A bit of a watery mouthfeel, with some fine carbonation. I'd say where this beer shines is in its drinkability and its pairing with spicy foods. I tend to enjoy it the most in large quanitities or with a nice spicy burrito."
"Avoid like the Mexican Plague."
"Overall, not bad for the style, and I scored it as such. I would take a can of this any day over a Corona or BMC. Tecate is a great no frills, no thinking beer. I could put away a few of these on a sweltering hot day and not think twice. Good for what it is, a Macro Lager."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a golden with a fairly decent head, fair lacing. Smells like straw, grains, and fairly yeasty. Tastes fairly sweet intially and finishes a touch bitter. Light body, one of the better Mexican beers I've had this Cinco de Mayo."
"Pours golden amber with a white head that goes snap crackel pop. Mld malt nose, but better than most US macros. Taste has slight roast malt, with just enough hops to give it a dry finish which was a good match with Baja fish tacos. I know from those nights of drinking cans, you really don't want too many of these in a row, but this was fine to go with tacos dosed with a hot habanero sauce."
"D: Pretty drinkable and I might get it again when I'm at my favorite mexican restaurant."
"The mexican equivalent of BMC. The pour is piss yellow with no lace and a distinctly acidic scent that is not inviting at all. Flavor is all corn and grain mixed in with too much carbonation. I guess the figure the more carbonation the more it will mask the bad flavor...well in that case they need to add some more because the flavor is pretty much non existent and when you do taste something, it tastes like dry skunk. Not recommended."
"Good thirst quencher, not a good beer. There are worse beers out there, but there are more better beers out there."
"I do not mind this beer at all...it is definitely my go-to session beer when I am drinking cheap beer with my friends because we all love it...Compared to other Macros, I think this is my personal preference...drinkability is very good, making it ideal for beach/fishing days when the Florida sun is beating on you"
"www.theviceblog.com"
"First of all, you want to drink this beer cold; warm Tecate is bad news. Secondly, there are worse macro lagers to drink on a hot Texas summer day. I'd much rather have a Tecate in a can over a Bud or Bud Light any day. A totally average beer, to be sure, but if you temper your expectations accordingly you won't be disappointed."
"I pour it into a pint glass to investigate. Pale yellow gold color and a crappy little fizzy head that goes away rapidly. It stinks of inferior ingredients. I would describe it as smelling like old corn (duck feed) and a sour dish rag. There's a hint of sweetness from maltyness in the flavor. But this Budweiser-of-Mexico is thin-bodied, mediocre, and not very tasty. In other words, it's exactly what I expected."
"i go down to mexico every december and this is the most popular beer in the town, trevino. which is located right outside of monterrey where it's brewed so it's always fresh. This beer is amazing, it is way better when bought in mexico than it is in america. even the ones in texas don't taste the same. never buy in a bottle you will be disappointed. canned is the way to go. at five dollars a 6pack you cant beat it. by far my favorite beer and mexico's finest. i wanna brush my teeth with it"
"Overall, not a great Mexican stab at the style..."
"So blah. I'm hard pressed to even come up with thoughts or opinions on this beer. It's not so offensive that I would turn one down, and I'm sure it washes down food well enough, but it's just dull. I was so bored by halfway through the can that I forgot it was in front of me. If I was preoccupied, I'm sure I could down a couple. The price discourages future buys. How Mexican beers are consistently more expensive than Canadian ones that are almost always better confuses me. Not the best or worst Mexican beer."
"This is an incredibly bad beer. The DMS (Vegital) flavors and aromas combined with the grainy husky characters are very unappealing."
"Recently, at a barbecue, these were available in the bottle, iced nice and cold from an ice chest. Drank sans lime. Tasted like Mexican beer, as usual, but something a little sweeter and less offensive than Corona. Many comments from others, along the lines of this tasting better than Corona, which seems to be ubiquitous at these functions. Had four or five left over (didn't realize my wife had bought these!), so I got to take them home and enjoy in the following week. Still have a couple, so they're not THAT great, but nothing to shy away from if they're on special at the supermarket."
"A friend brough a sixer to the house, and left three on his departure. I drank one. There are still two left, and will be for some time unless he comes back soon. Just not my cup of tea, as it were. The thin nature works toward a drinkable character, but as is so often the case in macro style beers, the question to ask is, why would I drink this over other, more worthy possibilities? The answer, for me is, I wouldn't. Not again, anyway."
"Overall: Never would have guessed it, but this was a real pleasure to drink."
"D - A little boring to drink too many of these, and if I was drunk and reaching for a macro, Tecate probably wouldn't come to mind first. Decent and unoffensive enough though."
"Suprising to me was how much better this was then I feared. BMC drinkers will love this as its spot on for a light american style lager. It was head and shoulders above corona, but a step behind Modelo. As far as Mexican beers go though its not bad."
"Drinkablity similar to that of flavored water, which this beer strongly remembles."
"Ugh, this is bad, although (as most reviewers have observed) I wasn't expecting anything at all, so whatever. It pours I light pee color, and really smells awful (like, hard core cat pee, and I'm not exaggerating...well maybe a little). Flavor is skunky malt and grain with a ton of insipid crap tossed in (corn?). Body is thin...it's exactly like you'd expect a macro lager to be, only it's from Mexico. I will say, it seems like most of the Mexican beer I've tried is the definitely of ""lawnmower," high in the way of crisp-cool-refreshing, and low in the way of goodness. I wouldn't have more than one."
"Light malty pilsener style flavor with very little hop presence. Some adjunct, but nothing too off or weird; just a fairly solid cheap macro lager. I would drink it again."
"D: Mediocre drinkability, worth finishing out, but not seeking a second round."
"It's definitely a good beer to drink if you've been thirsty this summer, there's no doubt about that! Definitely not a ""go to"" beer, but a good ""warm up"" beer for something much better."
"M/D: Good drinkability with a watery feel that is light but not too light and slightly grainy."
"The most remarkable aspect to this beer was the head. Wow, what a rocky, frothy foam. It's quite impressive actually. Most beers this small have the head to match. Apart from that, it's your average yellow Mexican lager. It's refreshing and crisp, but nothing to get excited about."
"I would pick PBR over this anyday."
"D - This is a lake/fishing beer."
"Better than Corona without the lime. Smells kind of sweet, maybe this is a corn grit/ brewer's corn syrup thing going on here. Very light body, maybe they should have called it ""Agua Tecate"". Mild taste of corn and grain, followed by an almost dextrin sweetness. There's also a kind of sourness in the middle too, I believe this is what some on this site would call Tannis or Tannin. (which I guess is an ""astringent polyphenol", for you chemistry geeks out there. It's in Tannic acid in tea, so I guess this is tea beer,lol.) Prickly carbonation. Not too bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Would be great with some Taco Bell late night. I guess it's the Bud/Miller of Mexico."
"Served in a 24-oz. tall boy can."
"The start was quite alright, but the rest accounts for the overall low scores."
"I tried this beer on February 21, 2008 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured an a translucent gold colour with a thin white head, and significant effervescence. The smell was quite awful actually, grainy vomit describes it best. The mouthfeel was highly carbonated and watery. The flavour was metallic in nature. A bit of malt, a bit of sweetness, but no hoppy bitterness."
"Pours out the can a dark straw yellow-with a thin pillow white head. Aroma is not of hops but a sweet corn aroma? Taste is soapy and adjunct sweet. Mouthfeel is thin, highly carbonated and crisp. I have to say the drinkability is very high-I would drink this over bud or an American big boy lager"
"Decent lager for the summer. The color is fizzy yello with very little smell to it. What smell there is gives off a slight malt aroma. The taste is thin. The moderate-heavy carbonation makes this a crisp beer, but easy to drink. A good session beer for a hot summer day while eating burgers or grilling some dogs."
"Light body with no depth. Had this at Old C's and had heartburn the whole next day. I would not recommend this beer even to my enemy!"
"A pale yellow urinish color with a weak white head. Smells yeasty and a bit grainy. Pours with a pretty ok head, but it is gone all too soon. The taste is fairly standard for any mexican lager or any macro lager for that matter. Grainy and bitter corn mixed with cheap hops. Overall it is an average macro lager, but the again, most of them fall under standard. I'd rather have a water."
"It went pretty well with the food and was better than I expected. Certainly better than Corona and I think its even cheaper than Corona if you buy it from the store. While there is nothing truly remarkable about this beer in any way if you are looking for a very drinkable standard Mexican beer you should probably give it a shot."
"Mouthfeel is light and thin. This is a really awful cerveca."
"Final Thoughts: Definately had an idea of what I was stepping into when I picked up this watery golden potion. However it did come with some body. If only the brewers could take that note and try and brew a beer worth drinking. Never be afraid to take chances friends. I wouldn't recommend this beer to anyone, unless they had a low price range."
"Drinkability & Notes: I was expecting one of the worst beers so since I set my sights so low it wasn't THAT bad. I probably would never get again but it's not as though anything North of the border of this style is any better."
"Pours clear, fizzy, pale gold. Doesn't smell like much. Corny, as sweet as High Life, but it has (slightly) more hop and yeast flavor. I mean, it's subtle, but it's supposed to be a pretty flavorless style. Too fizzy, a little syrupy, but ultimately leaves you with that ""take another sip"" feeling that I expect from a decent lager. Definitely goes down easy. A fine canned macro by me."
"This is another beer that could be best used as a good thirst quencher with nothing there that really offends you. Stock up for Cinco de Mayo."
"D: A good beer to play beer pong and other drinking games with. You can definitely tell that this stuff was mass produced. This beer had no taste or consistency and definitely could not see any need to drink it unless you are planning to get sloshed."
"Serving type: bottle"
"It's a good beer for the style, in all honesty. Certainly not my favorite style, but within it I would pick this one over most others. A great Lawnmower beer for BA's, as it actually tastes and smells like barley. I'll probably pick it up again if I need a light beer in a can for the beach or whatever."
"Gold colored beer with quickly fading head.Aroma and taste are your typical vegetables.Served ice cold and with a hot mexican dish this can be one solid beer.I would buy again especially if it was a hot humid day or eating spicy food!!I rate this slightly above average."
"D - The only times to drink this is on a hot summer day or while eating some mexican food otherwise its just your typical macro"
"I've had this beer on 2 different occasions; once in Baltimore in winter, and the other in Venice Beach, Ca in summer. Both were great experience's but I think its more of a summer beer."
"Goes down smoothly and doesn't interrupt the flavor of your food. Does not go well with American cook out favorites, but for carne asada on the grill with friends, it can bee a crowd pleaser."
"Taste is a little hoppy and malty. Not offensive but doesn't stand out either. Mouthfeel is forced carbonation. Drinkable, but the blind taste test would be hard to discern from any of these macros."
"A boring brew in my opinion."
"That doesn't this was that good either. Watery still on the backend as it slides down, but there is some hop variance to give it a taste. At least it wasn't rough. Still haven't found a Latino beer that is really, really good. I don't mind, I just prefer a lot of other beers before this."
"Ok with a meal, I guess, but nothing I'd try again."
"This poured with a light, bone-white head with low retention. The color was a bright, lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity. The nose was light, slightly sweet, faintly lager-like. The mouthfeel was thin, slightly sweet, and again lager-like in its taste on the tongue. The finish was light, smooth, and lager-like. Does anyone else notice a trend? It has always been a good accompaniment to Mexican food, especially at El Zoccolo Restaurant in the Outer Mission district of San Francisco, where I had many meals with my uncle and a buddy of his. R.I.P., Jack Fleiner."
"12 oz can, trying to rate easy to find stuff. Wow, worse smelling beer I have had so far. The strong smells: dust, cardboard, band-aid and sweat, masking very light bready malts. Nothing great to look at either. Typical of the style looks (light clear yellow, white head, no lacing). Flavor is not great, but much better than the Modelo I just had. Cleaner and sweet throughout, much better tasting than the smell. Goes down like water. hmm. . ."
"Pouring into a pint glass from a bottle produced light foaming that dissipates very quickly to nothing. There is absolutely no lacing with this brew. The color is a pale gold hue that is crystal clear. Smell was weak with nothing notable about it. The taste was different from a lot of the American macros in that it has a slight sweetness to it, or at least no bittering, but doesn't really seem out of balance. The finish is mostly clean with nothing really left behind. Slightly watery and goes down easy, but not entirely satisfying. Not bad either."
"Not a complex beer, but a decent beer to wash down some grub on a hot summer day."
"The brew was served in a can with a lime slice which I thought was a little odd. I didn't use the lime, just drank the brew out of the can. The smell, taste and mouthfeel of this brew are all unremarkable. Not a bad brew to quench your thirst on a hot summer day, but not one that I'd go out of my way to drink."
"Nothing to scream about but makes an ok lawnmowing beer like many other macros do."
"D - Thirst quenching and fresh. This is a fine choice for a Mexican beach lager to drink on vacation. Nothing special, but it's better than Corona...although that's not really saying much."
"This thing is pretty simple,not much there from the start to the finish.It pours gold,with a thin snow white head that dissipates in the blink of an eye,smells kind of like playdough.There is a faint biscuit taste with absolutly zero hop pressence,and the mouthfeel is very thin,and the carbonation balance is strange,as far as drinkability I could drink a bunch but it would not be enjoyable."
"I enjoy this one more than Bud, but It is the last beer I would get at a mexican restaraunt, the restaraunts around here usually serve this beer cheap with salt and lime, but I would rather enjoy a Sol or Modelo especial, as opposed to this. I enjoy it more than some of the generic domestics"
"Not a bad mixer for Michelada though, which is why I keep drinking it."
"D: I had a six pack of these with lime over a nice authentic Mexican dinner, made for me at a friends house. Then I had another six pack. With a big feast this beer is perfect."
"Pours as expected, clear yellow, fizzy white head disappears in a flash, few lace spots, poor retention. Smell is weird, sweet and sugary, bread, yeasty almost, corn, veggies, light citrus, unpleasant. Taste is very weak and watery, no substance, light bread and citrus, sugary corn water, one of the blandest beers I've come across, even for the style. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, high carbonation, not fun. Pretty crap even for a macro lager."
"Plain ole' American Macro Lager beer here. . . mexico style. That doesnt change anything, but just thought I'd toss it in there. Pours that fizzy golden yellow color and has virtually no smell at all. Basically has no taste either, a bit malty with a few astringents, but youll never find any sort of hop aroma in something like this. Taste is similar to the smell. Nothing much to speak of. A bit malty, a bit fizzy, a bit watery."
"Appears a bright pale golden clear pretty much a light apple juice color, forms a white quickly fleeting head dwindles to thin scant lacing. Aroma cooked veggies mainly corn in this case with a rough husk grainy off tone with not much of a hop aroma. Flavor is pretty rough grainy husk with malted sweet corn flood the palate. Not too palatable even with lime thrown in it won't hide the roughness that this beer has to offer. Mouthfeel is thin watery highly carbonated rough on the gag reflex, really does induce it a bit. Drinkability, I will always pass on this but I have fond memories drinking it while visiting Ensenada."
"Now, on to the beer itself. No real smell, no real taste either. Just maybe a bit of malt and an astringent aftertaste. Needs lime, real bad. Color is a nondescript brownish, no real head ...just a light coating of foam."
"Pours a sort of darkish golden color with a minimum of head, but what is there positively clings to the glass all the way down. I can't smell anything on this beer. The taste is clean but a little nondescript sweetness. There's no bitterness or hop flavor to speak of. Not much there at all. Mouthfeel is a little heavier than water, but water is the closest thing to it. No creaminess or tingling or anything else, just water. Overall, it's drinkable, but so is water. I've had vodka & water that had more flavor than this."
"OK beer for the buck"
"D: Very good, one of the better macro lagers that I've had, not a great beer, but drinkable and refreshing on a hot day, good job Tecate."
"Normally this is the best of the lot of Mex lagers and fresh it's clean and decent if unchallenging, but canned and shipped 2500 miles to the LCBO to mortify on their shelves...well...losing the light flavor it had fresh it becomes great to down in a bong and recite belch poetry."
"Nothing special here. Pours with a fairly well sized head that dies right away. Leaves behind some lacing. Clear golden colour. Smell is rather bland, some grain and malt not much else. Has some corn like notes on the palate nothing to over power the tongue. The finish is clean and dry."
"I am not impressed by this beer. It pours a nice golden color, but thats where the positives end for me. I don't know if I got a bad batch, or what. This beer seems flat, and has very little taste. I think I would drink this again if I needed some beer flavored seltzer water."
"Pours straw yellow with adequate head. Aforementioned foamy stuff does a decent job of sticking around. Smell is faint; of corn and mildew. Taste is, well, of corn and mildew, but I've gotta hand it to it on the finish, clean as can be, and not offensive in any way, other than in a beer geek kind of way. Mouthfeel is totally ordinary, but refreshing and crisp. This is the most ordinary beer imaginable, but my friend brought some over and I've gotta say that it goes down pretty well on a hot day."
"A light golden colored brew with notable head that settled to a fine lace. There is a faint wheat smell but primarily I get that ""cardboard"" scent that sort of kills your taste buds right off. The flavor is slightly malty, a bit of cereal grain action. Very mild, dry, and kind of sweet but it's all watered down. Too watery for me. Seems more like a light beer. It's drinkable and probably works better when hidden behind some enchiladas with Mole sauce, but why would you pass up on a solid Dos Equis Amber for this?"
""
"Thanks Doug. (I probably wouldn't have bought this... and certainly won't now!)"
"Flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma, a little lighter on the corn flavor, but its there. Needs a lime to cut the corny sweetness."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not very filling, its pretty decent for a macro, but overall its just a run-of-the-mill beer in a lack-luster style and tastes a lot like the other beers from this company."
"Drinkability - at a buck per 12 ounces, this doesn't even make lawnmower class (those have to be affordable for what you're getting). Nothing here to make me want another."
"Drinkable? Hey, I had 4 that night so it couldn't be all bad. Not that I had a choice of anything else, but still...not so bad."
"I know I've had this beer many times in the distant past, but wanted to try it again for old times sake. Pale pale piss yellow color as you would expect for a mcro lager. Smells sweet and thin. Tastes a bit better, not a lot of flavor but the flavor is fine and inoffensive, some very slight citrus tones. Mouthfeel is thin and fuzzy. Overall it's very average tasting but refreshing too. I'm not gonna go rush out and buy more but it's not a bad beer for a hot day or spicy food."
"Appearance is typical for this sort of beer. Aroma is malty and rather weak. Taste is malty and thin, nothing special. Though it is smooth and easy to drink, it did not impress me. Then again, I drank it from a can; maybe a bottle or on-tap serving would have tasted better."
"Tecate beer is certainly nothing to write home about, but I don't find it objectionable in the least. It's better than most other Mexican lagers (and most American macro lagers), and it's really cheap too."
"Had this the other night at a Mexican restaurant. It went pretty well with the food and was better than I expected. Certainly better than Corona and I think its even cheaper than Corona if you buy it from the store. While there is nothing truly remarkable about this beer in any way if you are looking for a very drinkable standard Mexican beer you should probably give it a shot."
"Ill have to try again in Mex. restaurants with meals."
"Drank pretty easy, better than most mexican offerings"
"Recall the ""no detectable bitterness"" I described in the taste. Many people I've talked to who aren't crazy about beer find this as one of the beer beers they can tolerate. I can't tell you that personally, because I never had a Tecate in my ""beer palate development"" days. Might be a good beer to start out with, though not one I'd have even on occasion. At least it's better and cheaper than Sol."
"This is an alcopop. Especially with the lime. An alcohol delivery vehicle theoretically made from malted barley and hops, but with absolutely no flavor. It might be better than some North American macros because it practically tastes like nothing, while other US beers actually taste worse than nothing."
"Notes: My review here is quite a bit above average. Taking into account the style, I think 3.45 is fitting. Tecate is  to my mouth - much better than Corona, Budweiser, Miller, and the other run-of-the-mill beers that are the average AML brew."
"D-It is what it is....a fizzy, relatively unoffensive but unflavorful macro lager..I can't see paying import prices for this..toss it in a Milwaukee's Best can and no-one would know the difference. Not a horrible beer but nothing I would drink again. Probably better than Corona but not as good as Carta Blanca.."
"Drank this strait out of the bottle side by side with one in a pint glass. Pale as hell and very fizzy looking. Not as disgusting looking as Corona though! The appearance is light, light yellow. Almost like some light beer made in America...The smell is non-existance. Nothing to smell, which I guess is a good thing for a Mexican beer...The taste is light corn and wheat, nothing more, nothing less. A Carlsberg overpowered this beer by a longshot to say that much. It just screamed no ingredients. The mouthfeel is pure water, almost Michelob Ultra-ish, but still, loads better than any of that crap. Good part? You could probably drink a 12 pack over the course of an afternoon and not feel any after-effects of hop oil or bloating. Just like drinking alot of water in a way...but better of course!"
"Overall: Serve cold and with a lime when your local Mexican joint doesnt carry Negra Modelo."
"Drinkability- Very sessionable, and decent drinking on a hot day when it's ice cold. that's about it tho. There are certainly better Mexican beers out there."
"Pours a light yellow straw color, large coarse head dissipates quickly. Some nice lacing surprisingly. Not much going on in the nose. Light metallic grain and corn. Very light taste of corn, light malt, some faint hops, mild skunk. Big carbonation bubbles rise to the top of the beer. Overall a super light and easy drinking brew to go along with food or as an ice-cold thirst quencher."
"This poured a darker golden with really no head at all. Smell very weak, not much to take from it. The taste is pretty bland, like a flat Corona. There's not a lot to really say about this beer. It's just decent, something you might find a high school or college house party. I wasn't very impressed with it, but if you're just looking for something to get you by for an evening for little price, I guess it's a decent possibility."
"Drinkability: I hate to give a beer credit for not being awful, but this is a fairly tolerable Mexican macro. It's certainly better than the Corona that my cousins probably paid quite a bit more for."
"This is a decent solid cerveza. It pours a fairy pale gold to tan with very little head retention. Barely any smell, perhaps some hops but the taste brings out the hops a bit more. Well carbonated, with an average mouth feel. It's a good choice with take out Mexican food, or even a bowl of chips and salsa -- very good at cooling the heat. Add lime to punch it up a bit."
"Tasted like a cross between a Budwiser and a Corona. Decent, but far from great. Had it as part of a popular Mexican cocktail called a ""La Michelada," but I was sure to try it on it's own first. Then I mixed it with worcestershire sauce, tabasco, salt, pepper, and lime. Was much better as the cocktail, and actually - I would highly recommend trying!"
"I would not have another. I'll have a Bud-light over this one, so that should sum it up."
"Appearance is pure American Lager. Decent head formation, which stuck around longer than I expected (and longer than the Modelo Especial I had awhile back). Odor is a bit of malt but mostly adjunct sweetness. The presence of hops is barely discernable. Taste is pretty malty, and not awful. I would agree that this is better than Corona, throw in my two cents that it is better than Modelo, but I think that if you are limiting your choices to Mexican beers (not sure why you would punish yourself like that) I think I would go with a different FEMSA product - either a Sol or a Carta Blanca."
"Edit: I just saw some other reviews comparing this to Schaeffer and it couldnt be more true. Like schaeffer the only true purpose to this beer is to play drinking games with."
"Okay, for all of my negative stuff above, I have to say that Tecate is actually not a bad brew as long as certain criteria for drinking it are met: it must be cold (ideally almost ice cold), it must be hot outside, and you must not want any complexity in the beer you are drinking. This is a decent brew for washing down chips and salsa with some tex-mex, or for just simply quenching your thirst on a hot day. Other than that, it's just another boring macro lager."
"Pours plain golden straw color with a thin cap of head and visible spiderweb lacing. Nose is strong smelling with light malts but also some adjuncts. Taste is crisp and refreshing although not overly tasty. Stilll, it has a satisfying bite and finishes fairly clean. This is not a good beer but it does have enough character to make it worth a shot on occassion, especially if you live in Mayberry like me."
"Tecate is fairly easy to drink, and is a decent Mexican beer for your buck."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"I bright golden straw color with almost no head. A very malty grain smell. A watery metallic hard taste that has a hint of malts and grains. Hard to drink from the can. The after taste and feel is hard to swallow and I had a real hard time even finishing this beer. Ive had this beer from the bottle and Id sticking to that. It was much better."
"Average golden appearance with lack of carbonation. Nose: reminiscent of a morning spent at a tuna cannery Taste: tinny and semi offensive Mouthfeel: A bastard child of Black Label and Schaffer produced on a Mexican holiday. Drinkability: Deserves a lime, nay, requires a lime, but will serve the purpose in a pinch."
"This reminds me of the pisswater Schaffer that my college brethren and myself imbibed in mass quantities due to financial constraints and general lack of taste so many moons ago. It is yellow in color with low carbonation, smells not unlike sweaty feet, and is very cornesque in taste. I normally would not advocate a lime for use with a better Mexican beer: e.g. Dos Equis lager, Negro Modelo, but it is almost required here. Luckily it was just $10 for a 12 pack of cans. I would opt to Olde El PASSO on this brew."
"Funny, but I used to actually enjoy this beer much more before I started taste testing REAL beer. This still isnt too bad in a frosted mug, with a dash of salt and a slice of lime, while washing down chips and hot sauce. However, if I'm drinking Mexican beer, I prefer Negra Modelo."
"Twenty four ounce can of Tecate that I drank straight from the can. I've had Tecate before, it's a typical American macro, fizzy yellow and tastes like corn. Smells like it too, and not in a particularly good way, although better than some other Mexican lagers. Nothing to recommend it, I don't use a lime, but it wouldn't be any big sin with this one. Better than some Mexican beer, worse than others."
"A sub par beer from Mexico. Poured out to a medium golden color with a head of foam similar to a frothy spit-up from a 6 month old baby. Smell was not impressive, as all I picked up were traces of malt and grain. Taste was light and watery; little malt or hops. Mostly mineral water flavors with medium carbonation. Mouthfeel was watery, with little carbonation making it's way to the tongue. Drinkability was below average. This beer is better than other Mexican imports, but unfortunately, that's not saying much."
"This is the best beer to drink out of the three main mexican beers. Nothing special. Wouldn't pay import prices for it. Goes good with a burrito, quessadilla, or some enchilladas. Doesn't need a lime. Basically it's the miller of the mexican beers."
"Poured a clear, golden color with a frothy white head. The nose was malty sweet, crisp and clean. The taste was sweet with corn with thin malts near the top. The finish was very acidic. The hops fail to give proper balance and in the end its rather astringic. If it doen't finish well your not going to go back for another sip."
"Standard macro lager with lots and lots of corn, plenty of sweetness, and not much in the way of hops. Would most likely do a lot better with a big pile of spicy enchiladas. On its own, it's pretty iffy."
"Tastes kind of like a tortilla. Corn. Flour. Tortilla. Beer tortilla? That's all there is to it. Albeit, drinking cold- but I am afraid to drink it any warmer. Mouthfeel is thin, watery, boring. I guess drinkable if you want to have a shitty macro chugging contest- but for my money, I'd rather have a case of PBR. Hands down."
"Considering what one will pay for this, you may as well get this before you get Corona."
"If you want a good beer with tacos, look no further. Tecate is made for easy drinking; to cool off that burn from the jalepeños. Drink it cold and drink it fast."
"Tecate is easy to find and a very good choice for mexican food."
"The taste was watery and easy to drink. Not a bad flavor overall flavor though. Slight hop and malt flavors. Nothing to descript or outstanding. Very basic but better than others Ive had. A very clean and crisp drink."
"drinkability: Easy to drink, but only because it is light and watery. Pretty boring, but easier drinking than many macros because there is nothing offensive to it."
"The familiar red and gold 12 ounce can emits this super light and clear macro brew. Minor and non retentive large bubble white head, Lacing? c'mon....adjunct nose, easy swilling, watery, light in both the malt and hop area. Lawn mower brew at best...I picked up a sixer on ""cinco de mayo"" for old times sake"
"It's everything that other BAers say it is and less. The bad is that there is an over-bearing grain flavor and vegetable flavor. The good is that there is a little bit of beer in there. It's not terrible, just brewed with lesser ingredients, leaving a medium straw color with little retention. Tastes a little malty and sweet, but misguided with poor adjunct grains. A little creamy and buttery. Finishes the same as flavors, but with a fleeting exit. Not much to say, its just beer."
"Smells a tad skunky (even coming from a can), looks like every macro lager, and tastes a little worst than most. I couldn't drink two in a row. Similar to Brazil's ""kaiser", but even ""heavier"" on my stomach. No head, disappointing colour, and the smell has been mentioned already. I'd choose water over this most times."
"This is what they always have on hand on poker night over at my buddy's place, so I end up drinking more of this than I care to. It's not terrible, it's just not good. While it's drinkable, it's not enjoyable. It's just passable. Good enough to go down."
"Overall. Pretty bad. Not as bad as some other mexican beers available, but not one i would really ever want again. avoid."
"Stopped in at the gasser with a thirst but they had little to choose from. Picked up a sixer of this brew. Bottle smell is very sweet. Poured into a glass has a big bubbled head that dies immediately. Glass smell is also sweet. Color is a deep yellow. Almost reminds me of lagers I grew up on like ""Swing with the King and roar for more"" Lightly carbonated. Flavor kind of bland. Sweet start but not much finish to speak of, fades very rapidly. Amazingly I remember this beer being better out of a can. I think because I was in the blazing sun and it was good as an ice cold thirst quencher. I probably will only return to drink this if choices are very limited."
"Notes: This is terrible. Definitely one of the worse beers that I have had. There's nothing to this beer. Light carbonation, overly sweet, no flavor, and a aroma laden with faults."
"This is the believably the worst beer I have drank yet."
"Drinkability: Utterly awful. Another bad lager from Mexico."
"Still I can see myself downing several as my taste buds sleep."
"This is a very bland beer, still a little more flavorful than Sol or Corona. It was refreshing in the hot Mexican climate but then so was the bottled water."
"Pours an extra clear straw color, with a soapy one and a half finger head. Rapid carbonation and poor head retention leave weak lacing. Very faint nose, extra pale malt aroma, but mainly adjunct. Grainy malt flavor, with herbal and hay-like hop taste. Aftertaste is clean, the drinkability high, and the mouthfeel crisp. Appropriate for a very humid day south of the border, but too light and bland for any other occasion."
"Pours dark yellow with a fluffy white head. The smell is faint, mainly of sugar, with a bit hop. The taste as mostly adjunct and malt, but there is a bit of bitterness to it. Overall the feels is pretty smooth. I can't say this is an awfull beer, it does go good with some spicy fajitas, but it's not great. I can't see drinking this on it's own."
"I had this one in a Mexican restaurant in Texas. Its a light straw color with a fizzy, unimpressive head. Moderate carbonation. Adjunct laden aroma, with a little malt and hops hiding underneath. Actually, the aroma is actually notably better than many macros. The taste is initially sweet, in a corn-adjunct, hollow way. Theres a notable hop finish, but the body is incredibly light and watery. I didnt come into this one with high expectations, so I cant say that I was really disappointed. Still, this is unquestionably a sub-par brew."
"a real true mexican pilsner, in six pack or ten pack, sold commonly by seven eleven or oxxo; this beer is good for drink with the buddies; bbq, or poker; its heavy and easy put drunk who´s abuse; now tecate is sold in caguama, 12oz twist off, 12oz normal; 12oz can and a pint aluminum can. smell much hops and malt, full bodied beer; 95% recommended."
"Pours pale straw yellow. Active carbonation with thin white head. Not picking much up in the nose at all. Maybe a little bit of grains. Tastes like any other macro to me. Very bland, but not offensive and rather refreshing if you get it very cold. Mouthfeel is decent, very clean. Finishes dry and I could easily have quite a few of these. Overall, slightly better than the other macros, would be my choice at a mexican restaurent if Modelo Especial is not available."
"Old picture you have. BUt anyway, a lot of people say it is nasty, but once again, the more close you are from the brewery the better it taste. In this case, t is brewed in Tecate Baja California, and for a sunny day, it worths. A little bitter the back taste for a lager, but tastes good after all, in some presentations."
"Drinkable and refreshing. A decent summer beer."
"The smell is a cross between sweet champagne and the nasty smell of day old stale beer on the floor. Initial strong carbonation gives way to a sweet sugary (or maybe more like one of the better artificial sweeteners) flavour on the tongue which gradually dissipates leaving a stale flavour and ultimately dry feel. This stuff would be very easy to drink a lot of if I had already drunk a couple of better beers to deaden my critical faculties to a degree."
"Tecate is an excruciatingly unchallenging beer that, nevertheless, is a decent south of the border thirst quencher that fulfills its mission statement perfectly. It's a light, semi-flavorful, unfailingly polite, don't wanna think too much about it, goes with Mexican food, rehydrating, grows on you after a while, put away a six-pack with ease, no limes in the vicinity, inexpensive, doesn't have to be ice cold, drinkable kind of cerveza."
"Bottle obtained from the discount rack of a local liquor store. Pours a finger and a half nearly white (linght tint of yellow) head over a crystal clear very light rust liquid. Add a very pale rust to the very pale straw of color of a macro and you get this. Bubbles form randomly on the bottom of the glass and float to the surface. Smells potently hopped with something like Saaz that would impart a tin smell. To many people this comes across as smelling 'skunked'. Tastes mildly hoppy with noticable malt sweet. Hops have some hallertauer roundness and a touch of co-ho roughness. Malt is pretty clean, but has some honey. Upopn swallowing there is an acrid taste from carbonation release. This sting on the tongue settles fairly rapidly and leaving some floral hop and some flat malt sweet as an aftertaste. Body is thin, but with some quality I can't put my finger on that makes it come across, to casual taste, as Md-light. Carbonation is high. Amazingly, there is still a tiny layer of head still on top of the last little bit in my glass and the inside of my glass shows incredible lacing. Judged to style."
"Its not too bad for what it is, yet another pale lager, which isnt much in the first place. Pours a decent thick head. Color is almost a decent golden pilsener. Taste is bland at first, but begins to reveal a little malt character and a suggestion of German hops. At least it goes well with Mexican food, and yes, with a touch of lime. But you wouldnt want to drink this by itself."
"poured a pale gold color with an over-active white bollowly head that lasted throughtout the brew. Smell is nothing. Taste is sweetish and not in a good way. Mouthfeel is wet but little if any hops or malt. Average at best. I'd rather drink a Schlitz at half the price."
"Not a bad brew. Sure kicks the crap outta Corona though."
"Clear yellow-gold pour with a near-bleached thick white head that stuck for a while. And that's when things started going into a downward spiral. It reminded me of goopy burned corn oil on the nose, something unpleasant and somewhat rancid about it. A good hop on the tongue if you can avoid the smell but it isn't really countered by anything and leaves an oily film and aftertaste on your tongue. Not readily drinkable but mostly because of the smell, the taste and feel I could have swallowed if the smell hadn't gotten to me."
"Drinkability is so-so at best. While better than most megabrew offerings, it's nothing special, unless you just want something cold and wet that won't make you gag and has some alcohol in it."
"While certainly a great beer, at least it doesn't require a lime wedge to make it drinkable."
"Pale yellow color with a decent head. Head retention is pretty good for the style. Smells like light grains with a metallic aroma. Taste pretty bland. Grains, a little bit of hops and clean finish. Light but not over carbonated mouthfeel. Not bad. Basically a Budweiser from Mexico."
"Reviewed from 4-2-04 taken from notes. Straw colored nice carbonation and small to medium bright white head. Nose is mostly neutral with hint of malt. Sweet malty flavor, medium to full body, short sweet flavor. Enjoyable. Finish is very short, crisp, and, dry."
"Pours with a frothy pale head that quickly dissapears. It is a bright pale strow color and is pretty well carbonated. The aroma is sweet with notes of grain, corn, and an actual light hoppy spiciness (though with an emphasis on light). This beer is light and fizzy, with a sweet finish that has hints of dms, sweet corn, and perhaps a hint of bitterness. This beer, as expected is pretty flavorless, but that is really the only complaint I can make. If you drink it cold there is nothing to distract you from thinking that it is just watery refreshment. Just a note, if someone had not handed me this beer I would not be drinking it, company beer o'clock what can you do."
"Pours like any macro lager would. Pale wheat yellow color with minimal white lacey head. Smells decent, I noted a little apricot like fruitiness along with the thin and sour hop smell one would associate with a macro lager. Taste is one dimensional, nothing impressive. Tastes like a macro brew, but not overly sweet, and with a faint orange citrus note toward the end. Alcohol is hardly detectable. Watery unexciting mouth presence. This beer lacks the crisp corniness I associate with Mexican imports. I could drink a lot of these, but would only do so if...well never mind."
"Drinkability: with so many other lighter domestic style beers out there, why would you pay more to drink this beer when there are better versions of the watered down macro that dont cost as much. But its not really all that bad either."
"An automatic buy when you go to a gathering where you don't know who is attending."
"Nothing horrible or outstanding -- very non-descript/average thirst quencher."
"On tap at Taco Surf (and many other places over the years). Pours slightly bubbly yellow with a thin white head. Smell is clean - just a hint of adjunct and not much else. Taste is crisp and refreshing. This is by no means a great beer, but I would take it over Corona any day, and it's a nice happy hour choice."
"Possibly one of the greatest sins against beer ever perpetrated. Run, don't walk, away from this beer. Trust me on this one. Definitely rates highest on the ""urine"" scale amongst mexican beers. Whereas most of the time you can find something positive to say about a mexican beer consumed while on a beach or something, this stuff is way too bad. Corn husks and skunked grain dominate this beer. Pretty fizzy, leaves that ""draino"" aftertaste in your mouth after being consumed from the can. Even if you're looking for mexican crap-beer to have on the beach, there are so many better options."
"I had my inlaws over last September, and after they left, I found this can in my refirgerator. It sat there until now, when I fianlly decided to get rid of it. Instead of just pouring it down the drain, I thought to review it. So, here it is. This beer pours like urine. It looks like piss in a toilet. The head looks like white soap bubbles in the sink. The head disappers very fast leaving absolutely no laces. It smells very bad. Maybe like rotting corn? I cant really place it. It tasted skunky. Other than that, it didnt really have any distiguishable flavors. It was too carbonated, I think. It was a harsh beer that didnt sit well on the palate. Drinking more than one of there beers would probably make you sick. I just poured mine out. Probably the smartest thin I did since I opened the can. Do not drink this beer."
"I can see how this is popular in that it washes down spicy tacos and other food well, and does not interfere in any of their flavors at all."
"I give this beer a good rating because it is well above average as an American Style lager. If others give this a below average rating, I wonder what would make a beer in this style a perfect 5.0?"
"Pale, golden color. Thin white foamy head. Lots and lots of tiny bubbles streaming from the bottom of the glass. Decent head retention. Pale, floral smell. Not much else. Pale grainy malt flavor, slightly sweet. Maybe some corn flavor. Slight floral bitterness. Very high carbonation, light body. Decent amount of malt to go with the hops. Not the worst of the Mexican lagers."
"I could see myself pounding these, if I was forced to. If nothing else, Tecate is completely inoffensive. But really, why bother?"
"This is Beach beer. Light, no real strong tastes, no real off tastes or smells, clean and available in cans to comply with the National Park Service Regulations with respect to Sandy Hook. an adjuct lager that will take the heat out of the day and not get you intoxicated too quickly. I like Tecate because the price is good and the taste with or without the lime is mild and quenching. Bavik and Wittekerke are two other can beers that seem to work these days."
"With an aggressive pour it produced large, soapy bubbles over it's clear yellowish color, there was definitely a malty nose which I didn't expect, and I could smell it inside of a Mexican restaurant! The taste was very average and inoffensive, there was the ""cooked veggie"" taste, maybe it was corn, I don't know, the mouthfeel also surprised me, it was not as thin as I anticipated, it filled the mouth a little. Overall, an acceptable hot weather ""lawn mower"" beer, nothing to seek out."
"The beer poures a true corn oil gold, and has a minimal trace of head. The aroma is of corn malt. The taste is truly a corn based beer, and features a sweet corn start with a twinge of hop in the finish. The mouthfeel is light and oily. Tecate is passable as a macro type session beer, but when you sit down with a plate of enchiladas and tamales this is the beer to have. It perfectly cuts the chile oils and cleanses the palate for another taste."
"Drinkability: O.K., but for some reason these are just better when consumed on a warm day (or evening) in Mexico. In that setting I would rank it higher, but at the time I am in Nebraska and it is about 36 degrees. Would I buy iy again? Not for the regular price of $7.49, but maybe for $4.99."
"Comments - This beer is basically macro swill. The taste gets progressively worse as you drink the beer. If no other beer was available, I probably would still pass on this stuff. I recommend that you also avoid it."
"This one pours a clear yellow color with very little head and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is stanky, grainy and a little hops. Taste is stanky too. Very little flavor, some bitterness. Dry finish with some acid notes. Pretty crappy beer here."
"Drinkable? Hell yes, I could pound down six of these like they were ginger ale, and probably feel as much of a buzz."
"Consumed in October 2004 in Cancun, Mexico from the bottle. Geez...all these beers are the same. Too bad they aren't good beers. Pours a light copper yellow color. Smells of grain and maybe a few hops. Taste of a few hops and a few spices. Very acidic finish. Very dry also. Had some decent heartburn after this beer. Maybe the 6 taco's I had with it didn't help. I'll stay away from this one in the future."
"As others have noted, this beer is better than Corona. If Corona is the Mexican Bud, Tecate is the Mexican Miller. When served ice-cold, Tecate is a pleasant enough accompaniment to a burger or a fish taco, and it's light enough that you can knock down quite a few without feeling bloated, logy or bombed."
"Golden color, very fizzy carbonation, almost no foam or lacing. Slightly metallic nose, some corn and vegetables. Thin in the malt department, watery, slightly sweet, negligible hops that disappear almost immediately. The mouth feel is skunky, like a lot of Mexican beers. Dry, ascerbic finish and one is left with an unpleasant aftertaste that lingers. Try Sol or Carta Blanca. Avoid Tecate."
"as mexican brews go, this one isn't half bad. it's not good, but certainly beats stuff like corona. it pours a crisp and bubbly medium gold colour with pretty much no head, and certainly not a sticky one. it smells somewhat of corn, grain and some sweetness. very basic and bland...exactly what you'd expect from this type of brew. the flavour is neat and balanced amongst the same characteristics as noted in the smell. while i love my big beers, nine times out of ten i don't want 'em when eatin mexican food. that said, this one'll do just fine. i still prefer negra modelo and even dos equis to this, but it's more than serviceable for what it's needed for."
"The beer pours a clarion gold with a modest white head that is frothy in texture and the lace a concealing sheet. Nose is malt sweet, crisp and clean, start somewhat sweet, thin of the malt and the top light. Finish is dastardly acidic, the hops benign in their spiciness, dry as the Sonoran Desert."
"tecate is ok on a hot day like today. looks like your everyday macro. thicker head than expected....wait a minute, it's gone! smell is weak grain and wet paper. taste is minimal. a weak garainy corn like flavor. mouthfeel is light and unimpressive. drinkabilty is pretty good. a beer that could go down rather easily and quickly when hot and humid. better than a lot of mexican swill out there."
"This definitely is not a bad imported Mexican beer at all. There are some days that I will actually prefer this over Corona. It is almost up to par in the Dos Equiis region. Not too bad, it had a very light head and went down smoothly. All in all better then most Mexican beers around."
"This is the miller lite of Mexican beers. There was very minimal taste and smell. The grain was detectable. Also slightly detectable was hops. The liquid was clear and crisp, but overall, I found this beer very unappealing, one of the worst Mexican beers."
"Bought this on sale for $7.99 for a 12 pack of bottles. Appearance is a medium pale color, head is minimal and disappears quickly. Smell is really faint, it's clean, but barely there. The taste is really bland, not exactly watered down, just mild to the point of extreme blandness. The taste isn't offensive, mainly because there isn't much to taste. As for drinkability, this is a good beer for drinking in a cold mug on a hot day. Good as a thrist quencher, but not for flavor."
"This is a decent knock-back beer for a hot day, and one I'd take over Corona or Budweiser anyday. The price is competitive, too. Drink it from the bottle with lime for best results."
"Oh man. Pours as clear a golden as you can possibly imagine. Nose totally of adjunct grain, mainly corn. Taste again of corn, adjunct, astringency, bad grain, no hops whatsoever. Very thin in the mouth, not much use. Not totally offensive, just not really much taste. I guess you could drink a lot of these in a session, but I don't know why you'd want to."
"No real reason to buy this one, unless you're faced with the choice of this, or the traditional American macros. Not a great beer, but I'd drink it over some burritos."
"First of all as far as beers go, Mexico is not the top exporter of good beers, but I will admit that they produe some damn good lawn mowing beer. There really is nothing to this but I can't honestly find much out of any pale lager. Watered down but sure tastes good in the heat. This is one that you can literally drink all day (not saying your bowels would want you to)."
"the head on this one is very poor. big white bubbles that fade into nothingness. it is a very clear beer. taste is crisp, refreshing, and simple. not a bad choice for a drinking bout or just laying on a summers day. very drinkable. not that great. not that bad. ten times better than corona."
"The mouthfeel and drink ability are fine. The beer goes great with Mexican foods and is worlds better than the Sols or Coronas. While not a top tier Mexican beer, this is plenty to like about it. Enjoy!"
"Anyhow, everyone who gave this stuff a sorry rating, I suppose this was just not for them because personally, I drink a ton of this stuff by itself and with Spanish food and I think it's great."
"Not impressed with this beer although ive heard diffrently. It seemed almost like pop to me don't know why. Couldn't detect to much falvor. I was suprised at the high-carbonated mouthfeel, which i think led me to feel like i was drinking soda pop. I wouldn't necesarrily throw this beer out a window but if presented with choices like Dos X i think i would chose the later."
"Tecate isn't bad and it is alot better than other mexican beers at a fraction of the price. It pours a gold yellow with minimul head. The taste is average, blast of hops with a little citrus thrown in at the end. Feels carbonated and light in the mouth. A drinkable beer in hot weather, but during the winter it wasn't my touch."
"Drinkable, not a fine sipping beer, but a chugging to fight the heat beer. Way better than Corona."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a lacey white head. The aroma is of sweet pale malts and lager yeast. It has a very pleasant smell. The taste is light and refreshing. It has a sweet malt palate, but there is no complexity. This better than most lagers. It does taste a bit watery, but not that bad. The mouthfeel is perfect. This is a very low bodied beer with the right amount of carbonation. This beer drinks very well; an excellent beer from south of the border."
"Starting off we have a clear gold beer with a nice head. The aroma is mild and grainy. The taste is mellow, grainy, and slightly sweet with not much hop presence. There is not a great deal of carbonation and it is sort of watery. The finish is slightly bitter and dry. There were no new revelations here. The best part was it came in a brown bottle."
"Note to self. Never, ever ask a barkeep, no matter how cute she is, to pick you a beer. My only condition was no light beer. This thing is what she picked me. Poured a light yellow with some head and a fair amount of carbonation. Looked safe, but that's about as far as it went. Smelled funky. Like corn husks and rotten water. Tasted about the same. Sour corn funk. I don't know how to describe it better than that. Adding a lime didn't help much, but I guess it'll stop scurvy. What possessed me to drink this. Had a bite to it due to the carbonation. With decent flavor it could have been crisp. I don't think I'll ever drink this again. Even for free. Ok, maybe for free."
"But it tastes really good. For my money, it's one of the better pale lagers out there, and it's certainly one of the more interesting Mexican beers on the market. VERY smooth and full of character, it goes down real easy. Somewhat malty, you get a real feel for the hops about halfway through the can. Above average mouthfeel. I give it a very high score for drinkabilty because you can throw down several of these without even knowing it. It's great for road trips or backyard get-togethers. Not easily found in bottles, I usually buy it in cans. Get you some and have a perfect beer moment of your own."
"It wasn't as bad as I was expecting. It was actually fairly drinkable and didn't become undrinkable after it warmed a little. There's actually a surprising bit of malt flavor and while that doesn't mean it was malty, it just means that it was maltier than more beers in the style. I even started to pick up a little hop bitterness at the end. I had this from the bottle."
"Light gold color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is cornish and sweet. A light bodied lager style beer. Light malt and hops. Very little flavor or taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is nearly neutral. Not much to this beer, well made, but just not much taste."
"This beer poured a clear bright pale yellow gold color that was incredibly carbonated as we watched the bubble dance in the light. The small white colored foam was produced in the first pour, then, fell to nothing except a small ring on the edges. Lace was present but faint and barely visible. The aroma was fresh, clean and crisp, but no real smell except some sweet corn grain and malts. Plus I did get a whiff of lime, but I think it was from the one sitting next to the glass in the napkin. The tastes that I experienced were sweet malts (faint), citrus (not from lime), sweet grains ands a real slight hop bite. No after taste present. Light medium bodied. This is a crisp and clean beer from down under (Mexico). Nothing really spectacular - just what it is, refreshing and a good accompaniment to the carnitas that I was eating. I would get again over some beers that I have had in the past."
"I mean it. This is doppelganger bitterness. At first peppery and refreshing, then pale and stewed like an old boot. Very drinkable for such awful material. (?!)"
"Comments  Im all over the board on this one. Ill rewrite the review if any of the other cans show improvement."
"Bottle. This was not what I would describe as a good beer. There was not much to it at all. The head dissolved very quickly. There was no lacing on the sides of my glass. It was bitter and watery tasting and it also had an aftertaste to go along with it. The hue of this beer was pale yellow."
"I would not commend this beer at all except for being a thirst-quench style lager. Pours a pale and clean bright golden tone with close to no head at all. The smell, very, very slight is of some malt and hops but no other than that which suggests some maltyness. The taste, sweet but bitter showing the obvious main ingredients, is also faint which makes it watery lacking flavour. It's like an upgraded Corona, which makes it so far one of the better mexicans."
"A few years ago, I ordered this in a Mexican restaurant and was presented a bottle with a lime. Adding the lime further increases the drinkability factor to this. Lacks the harshness and nastiness of Corona. This stuff goes down like water. A great summertime brew. Although this is far from being a quality beverage, I have found somewhat of a PBR-like sanctity in this brew. A simple yet effective thirst quencher."
"I would say this beer is pretty similar to Miller High Life..but not quite as good"
"Drinkability: a good swiller, I prefer it over Corona if I'm in the mood for Mexican macro-swill, Negra Modelo wears the crown when it comes to beer from ""South of the border"" though"
"This guy has a fair fluffy white head. Real clear, paler gold color. its about what you would be expecting from a mexican lager. Not that great tasting, but on a nice hot day you could put down a ton of them. Better than corona anywho... Not recommended, not the worst either."
"Color is golden pale yellow with no head from pouring, a few clearish bubbles sit around the edge. Smells very faintly of spiced sweet malt, no hop presence what so ever. Taste is more of the same, very slightly spiced sweet malt and no hop to be found. Its very clean, crisp, and lightly refreshing. Feel is a bit more medium body but lacks in roundness. Mostly watery malts. Easy drinker, but stick with Dos Equis."
"Pours a clear golden in color with a lingering white head. Aroma is feint with some hints of grain and hops. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. Light malt sweetness on the tongue with a very mild hop, yet rather clean finish. Goes down easy on a warm day or to wash down some spicy Mexican food. Nothing fancy, just a clean tasting Mexican beer that provides a decent alternative to Corona."
"Grabbed a bunch of big bottles at the store and this was among them. Pours pretty plain, very little head, no lacing. Taste is grainy, hard to find any hops. The taste is only lightly malty. It is crisp tasting and refreshing. This is much better than other Mexican beers. Prefer this to Crapona anyday."
"lime and eat some good food and this beer will do its job."
"We went to our local Mexican restaurant tonight and my wife ordered a Bicardi and Diet Coke and got a Tecate and a large Diet Coke. So I drank her beer after a good laugh. The beer poured a fairly dark golden. The head was not strong but it did linger on the edges of the liquid throughout the glass. It had no aroma - either good or bad. The taste fit the dinner but was very mild with no hops. The mouthfeel was light. It was a good beer to drink with Mexican food. I would rather have a Bud than a Tecate for just drinking."
"Eh, just your average Mexican beer. What else can I say? Well, I'll have to say why. The color is a pale golden. The taste is a very light taste with little to no aftertaste. The consistencey is watery, well it might as well be water. Overall, nothing to get fired up about. Go with Bohemia, Negra Modelo, or even Sol."
"This is one of the better Mexican beers that I have tried, but it is not a good beer. It is very similar to a corona, but doesn't need a lime to cover the smell and tastes a little better. The only positive that I have about this beer is that it is drinkable. I will not be purchasing this beer again."
"Two Thumbs Down! Skip it."
"I'd take the Red Stripe over Tecate any day."
"This is pretty much on the same level as Corona, Carta Blanca, Pacifico, etc. Lower than average Lager that seems to be the norm for most Mexican beers. Think I will get a margarita next time."
"Pours a clear golden/orange with a small head that fades quickly.  The smell is that of adjuncty sweet corn and a hint of hops.  The taste is immediate crispness along with corn husk and grain with a slight bit of sweetness.  It is light bodied and finishes with a crisp clean taste yet there is almost no trace of flavor on the end.  Not bad for the style, but nothing to hunt for.  Salud!"
"Clear golden color with moderate head after hard pour.  High carbonation and very faint aroma---hops, with malt in the background (if you really tried to smell it).  The taste was more of the same and this is one that you have to add lemon to.  I still like the Dos Equis Amber the best."
"I like metallica, just not in my Beer."
"Just a step above coors lite. This beer is bland,bland,bland!!!! A typical lager from Mexico. Golden in color with a extremely thin head, aroma was just not there. Overall if you like bland brew this may be the one for you."
"Good grief...look at all those damn parentheses!"
"Pale gold, very clear, thin white head that dissipates quickly. Nice malt & hop aroma. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but buoyed somewhat by a zesty carbonation. Very light, generic beer flavor of malt & hop. Not offensive - not particularily pleasant. Finishes quickly leaving a light dryness. Somewhat refreshing but quite lackluster. Seems a little bit below average."
"I may have had a bad bottle but this was just awful. Pale golden color, darker than I anticipated produced a flat looking faint head. Smell was strong acrid, metallic, non-beer smell. Taste was equally bad, serious acrid, bitter, harsh, and slimy sourness to finish. Sadly for the first time since the ""Hurricane Rasperry Wheat incident"" the first beer I could not finish.......Maybe with all that money we give Mexico, we can just ask to have this brewery destroyed........ughh."
"Very light pale yellow with little head and minimal lace.  Sharp and crisp with moderate carbonation.  Taste and mouthfeel are light with faint corn flavor with a slightly bitter dry finish."
"Served at Chevys Tex-Mex in a frozen mug with a wedge of lime and a Mexican flag, both were discarded to get to the beer. Bright and clear pale yellow colour, minimal white lace. Very clean aroma, virtually nothing in the aroma other than a faint grain and corn girt smell. Intense crispness in a light body, clean palate with a thin grain flavour throughout. Some corn grit and light hop bitterness rounded out this brew and its dry finish. This is the Miller of Mexican beers, a better pick a than Corona."
"Clear light golden hue w/ a poorly retained head.  The aroma, although light, is an odd combination of husky 6-row barley, cooked cabbage and grassy hops. Although the hop bitterness is atypically high for an American macrobrew lager, the thin body and watery mouthfeel leave this beer most unimpressive.  Flavor contributions from malt are absent-- the void in flavor is characteristic of adjunct laden brews.  Tecate finishes with no surprises-- bland, yet clean.  I need a beer with flavor, NOW."
"Drinkability/notes: Nothing terrible about this beer, but not that exceptional either. There are a number of beers from Mexico that for the same money are much better. As an aside, I do not do that slice of lime thing that seems to be so popular with Mexican beers."
"I suppose average is the best way to describe this beer.  Of course, its available at nearly every Mexican restaurant and people really think they are being authentic to the cuisine drinking this.  Decent cold with enchiladas, but that's about it."
"It's better than Corona, but that's not necessarily saying much.  This is another popular beer to drink with lime and for good reason.  The lime helps mask the taste a bit."
"About the only thing it has going for it is cheer factor and it's better than Corona.  Oh yeah, it's not bad either.  I don't mind drinking these at Mex restaurants, but outside of that there's no reason to drink it."
"Not a bad beer, just not a particularly good one, either.  Comparable to most U.S. macro-brew lagers."
"Notes: Not one of the best lagers to come out of Mexico. It's palatable, but bland. A run of the mill beer."
