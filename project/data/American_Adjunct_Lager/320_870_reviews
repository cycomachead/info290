"Really not bad for cheap beer."
""
"About par for the course. This isn’t the worst American adjunct lager I’ve had, but there’s not much to stand out here. All in all, I’d rather have an Oly if drinking this style."
""
""
""
""
"Ahhhh the memories of days gone by when anything was glorious so long was it ethyl alcohol...but really, you could do worse."
""
""
"All things considered, Hamm's is a great value adjunct lager coming in at $13.99 for a 30 rack. It's a great working man's beer."
""

"C-"
"Overall it is an average player in the lowest category.  Drinkable on a budget, but not enjoyable.  I remember it as being pale yellow, fizzy, and bland...of course back when I drank swill like this I wasn't going for taste."
""
""
""
""
"Great AAL. Good with any food."
""
""
"An OK ""swill"" beer. Nothing remarkable, either good or bad. Certainly better than other stuff that comes out of Milwaukee."
"It was what it was"
"This beer is fine for an all day beer drinking marathon. Nothing special about it, other than the memories you create while drinking it."

"O: Not bad, makes for a good lawn mower beer. Holds its own for sure against more highly priced offerings in the style. The old school can is really cool as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"ok, its charming to drink hams, and it doesn't taste as bad as a few others...but"
""
""
"Being from Minnesota means you have to like Hamm's beer. Not liking would be like picking a Lady Slipper or dissing Bud Grant. We frown on things like that."
""
""
"This is really the perfect beer for drinking in a smoky room with sticky floors, late at night, after you may have over-imbibed. The sweet corn is understated considering the style and it still has a discernible hop flavor and bitterness to accompany."

"Not to big of a fan of Hamms. My parents sell it for $1 a can at there bar. I've had a few, but really just don’t like it. I generally only order this when a group of us are sharing rounds on the cheap."

"An elderly friend of mine gave me one of these in a gesture of kindness.  I took one sip and poured the rest down his kitchen sink when he wasn't looking.  Maybe it was skunky, but damn I couldn't stomach it."
""
""
""
"appearance has a yellow and gold look with moderate amount of carbonation. Hams smells like your typical american adjunct lager grainy and cook vegetables. Taste is grainy and smooth. It is very easy drinking beer . Mouthfeel is light but not watery . Overall hams I the top tasting cheap american lagers on market and cam compete with other lagers wich are priced higher ."
"I believe this is the best cheap beer out there, at $12.19 a thirty it's an unbelievable value for me, way above Stag, PBR, or Milwaukee's best (witch I tend to consume in high volume). It's no craft beer by any means, but for a classic American beer this is a home run for me."
""
""
"Pours a pale straw-yellow in color with a thin white head that settles down to just along the sides of the glass. Lots of small streaming bubbles are seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Good carbonation. Some very light spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of sweet grass/grains with a hint of floral and hay even. The taste is pretty close to the aroma with some corn sweetness in the mix as well. A little light-bodied but decent. Goes down easy and is really cent for the price as you can buy a 30-pack for $14.98 or a 6 of 'Tall Boys' for just $4.98. Overall not a bad brew."

"I have this in my beer fridge on a regular basis. It's my work in the yard and lawn mower beer. When you don't want a craft beer and it's not the place or time for one. It's an easy drinking adjunct American Lager retro beer. When you drink it you have visions of a simpler time in America. It's fun to take a 30 pack to family who can't get it and view their amazement it's still around. If you haven't tried it give it a try. Remember it's not a craft but an a American Original. Think Hamms Bear."

"Overall, this is a pretty standard adjunct lager. It's boring but inoffensive. I got it out of a $1 grab bag at a local liquor store, but otherwise wouldn't buy another one."

""
""
"This is the beer that is both good AND bad...so MODERATE consumption is required..."
""

"Overall Solid especially for the whole $1 I paid for the 24 OZ Can. Not a thing wrong with it just not really craft beer but a solid Adjunct Lager from a can."
""
"Hamm's ---2/5."
"I like this beer a lot, It's real, It's not expensive, It taste like a beer should taste. I've tried a great deal of different types of ""beer"" Some go way overboard and add funky flavors or way too much hops, But getting back to basics this to me is an almost perfect beer! Now some of you like the girly flavored beers, and that's ok , but that's not real beer, this is. Also just so you know I do like other beers such as Stella, Guinness Stout, Boulevard , (but not the IPA), dos equis, and many others, I'm not a beer snob, but when I like a beer that is good regardless of price I'll be as honest as I can going with my taste preferences."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: this is a classic lawnmower beer, the adjunct lager is inexpensive but satisfies on a basic level. Hamm's is better than most beers of this style so if you are on a budget this is a good choice."
""
"Overall, a previous reviewer said it best, Hamm's is ""nothing more than a thirst quenching lawnmower beer""...as all beer should be. Although a bit watery, finishes clean for an inexpensive beer. Where's my mower?!"
"Overall Hamms is nothing to write home about. Kinda gross, but drinkable. I stacked three macro lagers next to each other - Busch, High Life, and Hamm's. Hamm's was by far the worst of the three. For $12/30 pack it's a great value but don't expect greatness. Hamm's is like a cornbread tin-infested Coors Banquet."
""
""
"Flavor: not a lot going on here. Mostly corn sweetness with a slight malt flavor. Maybe a tiny hint of hops in the finish. Nearly a drain pour for me."
"Overall, this is nothing more than a thirst quenching lawnmower beer but it does an excellent job of being just that. A little rough around the edges but for the price, it is hard to beat."

"me likes hamms and will always 'cause the stuff just tastes good, gall'darnit."
""
"Thanx ""Hamm's"""
"At $10.99/30 pack, it's definitely best beer for your money. I live around a lot of beer snobs who only drink micros but I honestly think this tastes better. Real smooth taste either ice cold or warm. Not too much of a head. Not too bitter. Not too sweet. Perfect beer. Smell that brings back memories of old of my old man n his friends playing horseshoes. Perfect beer for those people who wanna drink a beer while hanging out in garage with neighbors or playing horseshoes with neighbors. Isn't that what drinking beer is supposed to be about? Top grade homeowners beer. Can drink a quality beer and still afford your mortgage."

"Overall: Pretty standard average adjunct lager. Seen it a bunch of times, so I gave it a whirl."
""
""

"Tall boy can - six pack for $4.00! Pours straw yellow - a shade darker than the average American Adjunct Lager. Foamy white head, lingers for a bit then stays as a thin wispy lace on top of the beer. Aromas is faint hops and cornbread - again, a bit above average for the style. Taste - Bready with a corn tinge, hops are definitely apparent but very light - very clean flavor profile - crisp and refreshing. Overall, just a touch better than many of its more famous competitors - given that this is one of the cheapest beers out there ,it is not bad for what it is. would choose over Coors, Bud, or Pabst."

"O: It's an alright, cheap AAL. Beer on a budget? Check it out. Nothing special but better than light beer."
""

"This is cheap beer - and below average for that, in my opinion. Not enjoyable, though I was able to chug the second half and move on."
""

"Hamm's is made for drinking. Of all the American lagers out there this and Schlitz tussle for king of the mountain. If you noticed in my review I mentioned how clean and grainy this beer is, just as I think it should be. For what this beer is it's respectable."
"Overall: Hamm's. No additional comments needed."
"O- It's Hamm's for damn sake, I wasn't expecting much when I bought this beer but I was going for cheapness. It's $15.99 for a 30 pack and it tastes just as good as any other AAL. Cheers!"

"Tonight after bowling league I picked up 12 cans of Hamms beer for around $6.99. I like to revisit the old industrial lagers from time to time. I'm on number three and I have to say I'm digging this beer. Looks like an old time lager should. Very clear and very pale. Aroma sort of leaps out you, for an adjunct lager that is. First of all it doesn't smell like corn, that's something right there. Second, I can smell hops, honest to goodness hops. Not like really powerful hops, but they are there in all their floral, grassy ahem, glory. Tastes alright. Again, doesn't taste like corn. It's not an overly sweet, corn flavored beer. It's light and wheaty, with a touch of grassy hops. Off dry finish. Nice full carbed up mouth. This beer is solid and mostly stands out for what it doesn't have. That is its lack of sweet, corny flavour. Clean and basic with a touch of hops."
""
" Hamms the beer refreshing, great with a shot of brandy, pizza, steak, or any American fare. Have a beer, have a Hamms."
""
"O: Ordered this for fun. Honestly, I wasn't expecting more than I received. I'd rather have a Bud. I would like to see how it drinks out of the can."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sourcing: Purchased at Spec's in Texas for $4.79 for a six-pack of sixteen-ounce cans, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
"O- I pick this up cause I wanted something cheap to bring to a party of non-beer drinkers. Plus I heard it was the new hipster beer and wanted to check it out. Not as good as PBR or Bud and probably wouldn't buy again."
""
""
"Overall a pretty surprisingly good adjunct lager, probably the perfect lawnmower beer."
""
"Of the many adjunct lagers that I have tried lately, Hamm's ranks up there with the best of them. At around $6 a six-pack, you simply cannot find a better deal."
"Overall: Truly not a terrible option for a cheap, easily drinkable beer for social events where drinking for taste is not the primary goal. This would be a good option for college parties, tailgates, and other social events where you want an unassertive crowd pleaser that is a step up from ice-cold light lagers."
""
"Hamm's was once a great name- in it's day the brand was practically synonymous with beer in certain parts of the upper midwest. My earliest memories are of it on draft at a certain 3.2 joint in Minnesota in the 70s. It had a reputation as a shitty beer by then, but it always had its devotees too. I think its a fine beer for the price- 3.99 for a six pack of pounders at my local C-store."
""
""
""
"Not a beer suitable for a full analysis, but not a beer that is asking for one anyway. For a cheap session beer, this one is near-unbeatable. Nothing about it is repelling, and the taste (straight wheat) is actually decent, if unremarkable. Just as palatable as any other adjunct lager, and wayyy cheaper. Plus the box's and can's artwork (if you can call it that) is classic."

"O: well, as to be expected, there isn't much going on with this one. Sadly, there are better light lagers available."
""

"O - I just may have found a new go-to cheap beer for buying en masse."
""

"If your looking for a medium bodied beer with great taste and unbeatable cost, then Hamm's is your beer. They have stayed true to their labeling as well as their flavor for years. I do like some micro's and I absolutely love Guinness, but I hate that folks are so proud of them. I can by 30 Hamm's or less then 1/2 case of a micro. I'll take Hamm's, thank you very much."
""
"I don't care about ""grassy"" this or that. The only question for is whether it tastes great. And, it does. The flavor is distinctive, balanced, and enjoyable. Again, as long as it's fresh, you'll get a really crisp, slightly grain-dominated start, which develops into a fresh, yeastier finish. Delightful. Hops are present in a correct ratio; this isn't some insanely over-hopped, liquid black dirt microbrew. Medium to lighter bodied, it's just the thing for the summer. It doesn't weigh you down, but it's immensely satisfying."

"Update 9/7/13... Okay, fine. Hamm's has been our House Cheepniss all summer long. Probably on our 12th or 13th case at this point, and it's always in the fridge now for handing out by the armload to a bunch of guests, for keeping the whistle whetted in between precious glasses of hi-dolla craft, for pouring on the flareups when grilling burgers and for soaking the grilled brats until serving time, basically for all general ""hey, it's beer"" drinking purposes. One time I tried 'dry hopping' a can I was drinking with some Cascade pellet. Yeah, don't do that. Take it for what it is and it won't disappoint (much). Expect anything more and you're dumb."
""
""
"Hamm's has a light golden color, lightly carbonated and drinks smoothly. Hamm's is very similar to Miller High Life & Grain Belt Premium in terms of appearance and smell, however Hamm's has a distinct hop flavor that makes for a more enjoyable drinking experience. Hamm's is a no nonsense blue collar beer that satisfies again and again."
"Cheers."

"I know this site is full of elitists and beer snobs but Hamm's is without a doubt the best session beer available ever. Great taste and great value. Get off your high horse and give credit where credit is due because Hamm's is truly deserving. I just wish it was easier to find In New England."

"Overall this is an adjunct lager and I cant say it is a great beer. It serves it's purpose as a refreshing lawnmower companion and makes my relatives feel welcome in my home. My rating for this beer is strictly style based receiving an elevated score because of price, 15 bucks for a thirty pack. It's not my favorite Adjunct, but it is the cheapest one I am willing to drink and beats BMC seven days a week."
""
"Milwaukee's Best used to be the cheapest 30-pack on the market, but now Hamm's has the cheapest 30-pack in town. A 30-pack of Hamm's is under $12 (before tax and bottle deposit), and the taste is decent. I'd say it's very similar to Red Dog, Busch, and Milwaukee's Best."
""
""
"Sweet grain, a little grassy, crisp bitterness, just a touch of corn, slight dry finish. Light and watery, very crisp, well carbonated."
"Note: I review for the style. I refuse to let my prejudices slant any review. Nothing worse than the typical beer snob reviewing an AAL, same for your AAL drinker reviewing a craft brew."
""
""
""
"Overall not something I would seek out might pick this up since it's around 15 bucks for a 30 pack."
"This pours a foamy pee color—light yellow with lazy bubbles. There’s a light corn malt aroma with the classic smell of adjuncts. It’s not offensive but not terribly appealing either. The flavor starts off about as crisp and clean and it’s going to get—keep it cold—and rapidly falls off with a harsh, musty finish. About everything I expected from this one."
""
""
"many people I have encountered are hating on the Hamm's. I have to say, for what it is, it is good. I like the fact that I have the ability to enjoy high end craft beers, homebrew, and Hamm's! all beer styles have that one beer that is the Platonic Ideal, and as far as American Lagers go, Hamm's is the one for me. Not as sweet as PBR and lighter feeling than Stag. Hamm's is a go to beer when you want to drink up American History."
"""An American classic...born in the land of sky blue waters"". Nice job Hamms!"
"Hamms is typical american adjunct lager, reminiscent of Coors banquet in its sweet, yet subtle flavor. Light, watery and very drinkable, no off flavors or smells but after a few I could sense a coating of tongue ""bum breath"" settling in. I think hamms holds its own esp since normally it is about cheaper than anything else around but has a solid drinkability. Still prefer ballantine, banquet, or schlitz as my go to adjuncts but hamms is certainly a very good choice when on a budget."
"Very easy drinking. A little too sweet for my tastes and a bit of strong on the adjuncts. I suppose it hits style fairly well. Can do for a lawnmower beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you enjoy drinking it because of the cool classic commericals then go for it. Otherwise PBR is a superior alternative."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent amount of taste, albeit cooked grain adjunct taste. That being said, if you drink this excessively, plan on waking up with a massive headache. I consider this a dirty beer. Union-made, but dirty."
"If I could rate this lower I would. By FAR the WORST beer I've had! The taste is the equivalent to a In Heat Wheat by Flying Dog head. I just get hit with wheat and awfulness, just a BAD beer, again if I could rate this lower I would, it;s just that awful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In conmparison to the more mainstream lagers, Hamm's looks pretty good. Better and cheaper, a double win. Just don't confuse this with a Sam Adams."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There is not a whole lot to say about this beer. Cost is appropriate. And of course expected results are met. I mean, really, this is a simple beer. Clean of any technical flaws for sure. Just not memorable. Great for summer sun re-hydration or kayaking trips."
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. I dont know if it is the hot weather or lack of having a beer for awhile but I found this one to go down fairly easy considering the style. With the assortment of other mass produced products in this classification, you could do worse. If given the option of nothing but BMC products, I would probably choose this one over them."
""
""
""
"Literally the very edge of the "" cheap "" corner of a beer shelf. Hamm's brings virtually nothing to the table in terms of anything. A transparent piss yellow color, With your average lager smell. Taste was slightly less appealing than Bud Light and the mouthfeel was all fizzy and carbonation. But, At $13.45 a 30 pack you can't really pass it up if you want to get a few people drunk for very cheap, Although I'd shell out a little bit extra for some Milwaukee's or Some Pabst. As a matter of fact, I washed this beer down with a Pabst"
"After some research I guess this is a MillerCoors product. My bad. And I do love the generic looking retro can. I have always loved those."
"O - It has a little more taste than others in this category. I appreciate the history of this beer as well as other rust belt beers so I'm kind of partial to it."
""
""
"From the can stamped: SEP1012-CO8031534. Sampled on June 1, 2012. It pours a highly carbonated pale yellow with a head that rises about an inch and eventually settles down. I am rating this on whether it looks, smells, and tastes like and American Adjunct should. The look is right. The aroma is of grains, corn, and a bit of hops. The body is light to medium and creamy. The taste is also grainy, corny, but the hops finish it surprisingly crisp and clean. I stumbled across this in a beverage store in Southern New Hampshire and I have not seen Hamm's in New Hampshire since the 1980's. Easily worth the $3.75 I paid for the 6-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure who brews Hamm's any more. The last time I had any was about 36 years ago at the Oly brewery tour. But one of our local stores had a 30-case for $17, so I thought it was time to sock some away for casual summer sipping. Then I broke out one and stuck it in the freezer for a half hour, and then poured it into a pint glass (I don't like the aluminum smell drinking from a can). The smell wasn't like a brewery, but just a pleasant non-specific fragrance. The head starts off OK, and drops off to near nothing after a couple of minutes. The color is standard for American beer. The taste is pretty much bitter malt with a slightly sweet touch, and the flavor fades away pleasantly. I think that if you keep this beer cool, you could continue drinking cans of it all day. Half a can provides a pleasant buzz, and this beer will make a sunny day very enjoyable."
"Barely drinkable as-is. I'll know for sure if I wake up in the morning with a wicked headache!"
"Light body with decent carbonation. This is is bad. My friend bought this and I want him to get his money back; all five dollars for the six pack of tall boys."
""
""
""
"I'm pretty sure if there was a purgatory for yeast, this would be it. Not heaven, not hell, but somewhere vaguely in-between."
""
"Overall - I'm honestly impressed by how bad this beer ISN'T lol.. In my area, Busch is the cheapest beer you can buy. They just started selling this stuff and it's about a dollar cheaper"
"O- Well its 9.99 where I live and you really get what you pay for, .33 apiece beer. Looks good for what is, in a glass, but if you make it past 4 your a champ for having put that much crap in your mouth."

"Overall, for as cheap as this beer is, it's actually just as ""good"" as any other mass-produced adjunct lager in the BMC crowd. It goes down very smooth, has very low ABV, and you could do a lot worse than this. My review is based on other American Adjunct Lagers, I rate according to style."
""
"Bottom line, it is what it is. A cheap beer for people on a budget that is no worse than any of the bigger names with lots of advertising money."
"Overall, I wouldn't recommend this for the advocates, but more for college kids trying to get drunk, like me"

"The taste seems very separated. First the bitterness with the carbonation, then a watery lack of flavour and then the light flavour of the malt that carries that classic bad beer taste I'm looking for. It doesn't meld together well, due to the high carbonation I believe. This kinda sucks, but kinda makes it interesting. I'd still prefer lower carbonation, though. I'm probably not going to buy this beer again since Schlitz Gusto is in the same price range and a better beer. But if Schlitz ends up costing more, I might think about buying Hamm's again. It's better than the big names. Marginally."
"Certainly not an outstanding beer, but taken for what it is (cheap at $9.99/24 cans), this mops the floor with the big boys' lagers, providing some taste for the buck."
"O- A pretty good beer, especially for the price. Probably about on par with PBR, definitely preferable to the big macros."
"Overall it's quite average but would certainly do when you're fishin' and someone else is buying the beer."
"Thanks to cpolking for providing this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of corn and grains. Taste is mild, some grains, just a touch of hops, nothing offensive but not exactly flavorful. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."
"Overall- What a great brew from Wisconsin! Awesome adjunct and can't believe I haven't seen this sooner. Haven't bought a pack of beer over 6 in more than months. Always cool seeing new beer on the gas station scene. Prost!"
"Notes: Too sweet, lacking in hops. This beer tastes a lot like Utica Club. I think I am over my nostalgia for this beer."
" COME ON Miller / Coors bring it back to Pa was a real big seller in the Old days here. And I think the way retro beers are selling around here in Pa would sell great again. A typical old time real working mans American Beer. Drinking it I could imagin the Hamms Beer Bear dancing in the old time ads. From The Land Of Sky Blue Waters Hamms The Beer refreshing!! Update Hamm's is back in Pa in 2012 just bought a 30 pack at Epps in Limerick. This will be my hot weather drink a bunch beer from now on. Thanks to Miller / Coors for bringing it back.Hamms is very old school in falvor and refreshment for it's type."
"O- A decent beer and refreshing. The carbonation was a poor move but otherwise it's one of the better adjunct lagers out there."
"RJT"
"D-A drinkable and fairly decent version of an American Adjunct Lager."
"O - Sure its not the best lager out there but on a hot day with burgers on the grill its not a bad beer at all and for the price and taste it beats the the other macros"
"I can remember the TV adds for this beer back in the 70's. One of my northern trucker buddies brought be a six of this since I haven't seen any since the mid 70's. Brings back memories. Very impressive head, three fingers of dense foam, with much lace and cling. Clear with lots of micro bubbles, a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. The smell brings be back to days of camping in Michigan, aromas of cereal grains, a slight floral array, and a wisp of lime. Taste is not quite what I remember from the 70's but it is not bad. Lime in the fringes, wheat, oats and malt in the forefront. Mouthfeel is thin but helped by the massive carbonation. Great for old time sake, brings back lots of good memories when I taste a mouthful."
"Continuing with the throw backs that have seemed to make its way into main stream I tried a Hamms. It is like Pabst's brother. The color is golden clear with decent carbonation. The smell and taste are grainy like you would expect. The mouthfeel is fine."
"It pours a huge head, I mean huge, three fingers, it's lasting longer than I thought it would, but I'm sure it will be gone in no time. The body is completely see through, damn this is see through, this might be the most see through beer yet, and that's saying a lot. There is a lot of carbonation, and surprisingly, the beer looks like it is leaving good lacing, I'm in awe. Even though I can here the head fizzing away, the appearance actually isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I mean the body is atrocious, but the head has some good qualities. Unlike Coors and Coors light, you can smell a little hops on the nose, very very small, but still there. Other than that there is a malt sweetness and a sour adjunct smell. Not horrible again on the smell, but for sure not up to par with any ""good"" beer. The taste is pretty crappy, there is mostly just sweet, almost stale malt taste here. There is the smallest hop taste, but nothing really there. Very watery, I mostly just get that gross cheap malt taste. On one hand, it has more of a flavor than Coors and Coors light, but it's not a good flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty bad, but not as bad as the Coors light. It has some girth to it, but for the most part it is just watery. The drinkability is the one great thing about this beer, it just goes down like no other, it is super light, and now that I drink it more, that flavor that I thought it had has kinda gone, and it's all subdued, so I makes it easier to drink. Overall on this beer, eh, ok for an adjunct lager, the beer changes a lot as you drink it, gross in some ways, smooth in some other ways."
"Flavor is weak, a touch of lemon zest with just a hint of hop to give a baby bite to the flavor of this beer. More flavor than light beers that are glorified mineral water, but not too much to think about here either. Carbonated throughout, light and kind of refreshing, although some flavor and boldness could do a little good here."
"D: I am not a fan of this style as a whole but this is far better than Bud, Bud Light, Corona, Miller Lite and their cohorts."
"Drinkability is good, it goes down fast, just a light, easy drinking beer. A good one to pick up in the warmer weather of spring and summer. Worth a try if you're looking for something cheap and you're tired of pabst."
"it tastes like a full beer not any of the light beers have a full body. I think it has something to do with the fact that it was on tap and not from a can. It is quite hoppy and has lots of bitterness to it followed by a small sweet spot right at the end."
"The body was a smidge fuller than usual. Drinkability was about what I expected. If you're in the mood for a fizzy yellow beer, you could do better, and worse, than this."
"D - Very disappointed, but not surpirsed for my favorite macro; I drink this beer with pride, you can't find garbage like this anywhere; I actually found a dive bar that served this and enjoyed every second of it; pass me another; good for when you want to get wasted and get caught up with old friends"
"can into a pint glass...not much here, piss yellow, no real body, flavor or aroma...pretty much what I expected. At least it was cheap at $2.99 a six pack even in downtown Chicago. Being originally from Wisconsin, I did drink a lot of this in high school. Cheap stuff. Better than a lot of adjuncts but still not real beer in my opinion. Goes down super easy. Like water. Which it pretty much is. Buy it if you're up against Coors or one of the others, but otherwise, take a pass."
"Taste, same cooked vegetal corn feel for it, but lots of carbonation, even detectable hops. Extremely metallic, maybe they never upgraded to those cans with the liner. Pretty thin mouthfeel, super easy to drink, and cheap enough that it isn't associated with the hipster ironic drinking revival."
"Overall: Perfect beer for the summer. As far as adjunct grain beers go this one is one of the best. As with most cheap lagers I recommend ice cold and in a can."
"Poured a very transparent pale straw color with a quickly dissipating white head. Doesn't smell like much, but its the typical corn smell. The taste also doesn't break the adjunct lager mold. You can taste the grain corn and alcohol. mouthfeel is thin, with soda carbonation. There is nothing offensive about this beer, but of course there isn't anything offensive in water, so it makes sense."
"i had the is the other day at the beer because it was on special for $2.00 otherwise i would not have ordered it i think its smilliar to High ligh life or Pbr. i think its a good beer if you want to Drink a few beers for a cheep price i would buy it again if its on special but not for more that 2 bucks"
"This is a decent beer for this category. I've had several way worse. I am a craft beer drinker so this is never a beer I purchase but have had several times. I have friends that do drink the BMC and others and I'm never one to turn down a free drink. This is one that I'm not terrified to drink."
"The first thing you will notice about this beer is the strong cat urine smell. There is a reason why a 12 pack of this stuff is only $1 more than a 12 pack of soda; it is not good in any sense of the word. The smell is putrid, the taste of old watered down MGD, extreme carbonation, brown, frothy head, and leaves a horrible aftertaste in your mouth. Avoid at all costs."
"Overall if I have zero options this is a passable cheap option."
"*Wal Mart here sells 30's of these babys for $16. Just thought others might like to compare. It's all they sell. Winco (the local supermarket chain here) sells the 12's."
"I have fond memories of this beer from years ago, ice cold from plastic cups while playing softball at one of my Dad's union picnics. I was about 12, and even then I remember this one being inferior to some of the others my Dad drank (Erlanger, Lowenbrau, etc). Anyways figured I'd try it again. Pretty much the same as a lot of the other macros, with little to distinguish itself. Clear yellow color, fluffy white head, big carbonation, grains. But with a bear."
"D= Not a bad AL. I actually sort of like it a little. It was cheap as balls and taste like nothing. I would buy this again if I wanted to get smashed."
"Enjoy!"
"I almost said screw it, Im moving to Wisconsin because of the beer here. This place is great."
"D - Well about as drinkable as any other BMC brew around, crack open a case & get the party started! This beer isn't anything special though, reminded me exactly of a Bud, being a Bud drinker I'm very familiar with the taste. Not bad, not good to me either though, so far Shlitz has been my favorite in the style. Eh, I don't recommend it."
"There isn't much to say about this beer, it's a little better than Budweiser but not as good as Schlitz."
"Overall, this stuff ain't gonna win any medals, but I'd still take it over that ""beechwood aged, for extra plywood flavor"" crap any day"
"From the land of sky blue waters...."
"Light flavor, but still a nice suprise."
"M/D: highly carbonated light body feel. The drinkability is ok considering the taste and feel."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Notes: This beer is great for what it is. It's an excellent alternative to most of the macro adjuncts out there, in terms of both price and flavor. In this way, I would liken it to PBR, which I am a fan of. Think of it as PBR's kid brother, looking up to and aspiring to be PBR."
"Hamm's is better than you might expect if you're looking for a very cheap beer (under $7 for a 12-pack). There isn't anything overly special about this beer, but it is more flavorful than other cheap light beers. The drinkability is high because there isn't a significant amount of taste... it is easy to drink A LOT of these at once. Give Hamm's a try... it isn't the worst beer around."
"The taste is pretty neutral with cereal grains and a mild, but noticeable, hop bitterness on the finish. This beer does a nice job of keeping the sweetness to a minimum for the style. Not a bad AAL, I could drink a couple of these without much of a problem."
"Drinkability: Meh. Actually it aspires to be Meh - more like Bleh."
"Great Macro swill, for the price its got all you could expect and more. My favorite style is American Classic Macro and this is one of the best along side Schmidts, Oly, and the new Schlitz. Hamms served at 32 degrees is as good as it gets for drinkability."
"Can. Yellow and fizzy and clear and urinesque. Smells like stale grains, old corn, cesspool water. Flavor is not as watery as some pale lagers but unfortunately the lack of wateriness is replaced with an abundance of cloying corn syrup and cereal. Finish is mineral and short. Yawn"
"Best to drink it quick. It if gets remotely warm, you're done for. I was introduced to it at a little out-of-the-way place in Chicago. But, being that is so cheap, that might not be the worst problem for you. An okay ""local"" beer if you find yourself out in the midwest."
"Final analysis, pretty much a generic American adjunct lager. I wouldn't be surprised if this same exact beer is sold under a few other names as well. Not bad, not good, just mainstream inexpensive brew."
"D: Representative of style and affordable. Nothing very special, but I wouoldn't turn one down."
"Honorable mention: this beer wins the prize for cheapest twelve pack I have ever purchased."
"I got a big, rocky two fingers of bone-white head with good retention. Nose had the distinct cereal sweetness that is associated with the style. Color was a light golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was thin with a watery taste on the tongue. Finish was very mild. Lawnmower beer!"
"Gold color with a little bit of prickle. Almost full coverage of lacing and a rim of foam. Lots of grain on the nose, but it stays in balance with the malt. Grainy attack with some mild hops in the flavor but dominated by the grain. Finishes with some graininess in true ""premium lager"" fashion. Good for the style. The style being what is often sold as ""cold beer."""
"HV"
"Conclusion: 1-dimensional, odd aftertaste...toast is nice but...meh, no thanks"
"Pours a pale gold color with a large foamy white head with decent retention. Smell is of corn, hops, and sweet malt.. The taste is a lot like the aroma. I can taste the hops and some sweetness which is a plus. The corn / grain taste is also present, but is not unexpected. The mouthfeel is thin and watery, but also crisp and clean. Got to take the bad with the good. The drinkability is average."
"Definatly a decent brew and the price is terrific."
"Perfectly clear pale golden body with a fluffy white head that melts quickly into a skim of foam. The nose is pure corny grits with no discernable hops present at all. The taste is better than the smell, still a lot of corniness but more dry than most adjunct lagers with a faint suggestion of hop bitterness in the mostly squeaky clean finish. Light bodied and easy drinking. I was looking for a new cheap lawnmower beer to replace the old discontinued schlitz cans, I think I found it."
"D: compared to the other macros i would say this kicks there ass the taste is just really there reminds me of the beer my dad used to drink"
"If it were $3 more, it wouldn't be as drinkable as it is at about 50 cents a can. Funny how economics can make some beers more drinkable."
"Not much else to say about this beer."
"Overall impression: About as good a macro lager as you're gonna get. Helluva lawnmower beer."
"Overall, this is just another macro lager that is cheap and nothing exciting. I don't plan on drinking this again unless it is free."
"Light color, flavor, taste, smell, presence...pretty much everything. But it goes down easily and I think the half I consumed from the can as opposed to the glass actually tasted better. Perhaps it was that it was the second half as well...."
"Overall: Highly recommended."
"Poured from 12 oz. can into a stein."
"D: Again, for the style, not bad--easy to have a few. Also would probably be a good beer to have with a variety of foods."
"This beer pours a clear light golden color. The head is an inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is a faint bready graininess. The taste is like the aroma. It is simple, but a little stronger than most Adjunct Lagers. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a smooth velvety feel most beers of its style don't have. Overall, this is a pretty good Adjunct Lager. I could drink this beer again."
"This beer is one of those beers that swill, but it's cool to drink it. It is a watery lager with unsetteling sweetness, but like Natty, the Beast and PBR, it is always cheap, and alway chic. This is swill. But I love it. Good with bluegill and making brats."
"Ordered a can at the Bryant Lake Bowl in Minnapolis. I just had to try it. And now I have. OK, this is basically PBR extra. Same watery sweetness with a cheap lager tang and a slightly bigger touch of spicy hops. Yeah, it worth trying for the sake of trying Hamm's, but it's not a terribly pleasant beer. Not patently offensive, but the taste is most easily described as cheap, watery, American beer."
"D- This ranks in at 5 and change % by volume so it's very drinkable. I usually pick PBR over this but for 11.99/case, you can't go wrong. Best enjoyed from the can, although the review was from a glass."
"I was excited when I bought this beer, I felt cool; like a born again college frat kid, then I remembered why I never wanted to be in a Frat and I hated almost everyone in college."
"D: A good yard work and family barbecue beer. In the bargain beer department, this slots in alongside PBR for me. Since a 12-pack of Hamm's goes for less than PBR, this is my new go-to cheap beer."
"Drinkability is better than average. One of my favorite US macros."
"D: Once again, I could drink Hamm's all night. It's not the best beer in the world, but for what it is - a cheap American lager - it's definitely pretty good. It doesn't taste as much like hair as Pabst. It's not as watery as Olympia. It's just a decent, drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel: light body and bland overall. Sits in the mouth alright...especially when ice cold. I could see this in my fridge from time to time. It is a sub-par macro-lager that is cheap and will do the job! Hard to come by this beer and when I saw it for 3.99 for a sixer of 16oz cans I just had to have it"
"Not a bad beer for the price. Excellent for sitting around a camp fire or on a hot day to enjoy a couple."
"Okay, I am updating my rating from last time... I do not know if I had a skunked batch, or what, but Hamm's is really not too bad for being the cheapest brew (12 pack) at the local liquor store. Decent taste and drinkability have made this one of my new 'Summer Beers'."
"I'm sorry, Hamms..this one is just undrinkable for me."
"Drinkability is inhibited by the stalenss."
"9.99 a case, I had to try it. You know what, its not bad - much better than any popular BMC brand. Light yellow color, smelled better than your typical macro, but taste fantastic. I wish this was available in bottles....looks like its going to be a Hamms summer!"
"drinkability is not good. this is a sub-par macro lager. the malt is not malty, but rather grainy, and stale at that. there is no hop presence, which leads to an unbalanced composition. not recommended"
"Poured a 12oz can into my Newcastle pint glass. Pours a yellow straw with just a slight carbonation. Aroma is mostly corn, with a slight sweetness. Not much more. It's really straight forward. This beer tells you exactly what it is in its aroma. The taste is just the same, no exception. Mouthfeel is light with just a slight carbonation. This is one of the better Retro's. It's a really great Lawn Mower beer."
"D: This beer was a pleasant surprise delivering more than I expected. It is one of my favorites of the style. I will throw a few of these into the beer fridge as the yard work season heats up here in the ""Land of Sky Blue Waters."""
"This was left over from a party...ya, I am a grown man and someone brought this to my house...poured into a glass this has a wheat color with a thin white head that dissipated before I put the can down. There was almost no smell at all, maybe a little skunk but nothing else. Very bland taste with mild carbonation. Not much else to say."
" ~ As far as a, hang out with buddies and drink a few beers, beer. It's not something I'd bring to a social gathering but I have to admit it could be worse."
"This will always remind me of Johnnie's in Chicago... RIP."
"Review: More of an IPA man myself, however this beer did not disappoint me in the least, especially considering the fact that a paid $6.49 for 12 pack. I can say without a doubt that for the money this is the best beer out there. Of course there is better beer out there, but if you want some cheap beer this the beer."
"The taste is weak. Don't remember it being this weak. Maybe get a little bit of the hops but otherwise is beer flavored water. It is light and crisp so pounding these all night would be no problem. Maybe that is why I liked it back in the day."
"Cheap. Cheap. This beer is very hard to even find anymore. Pissy and fizzy. Soapy head. The smell of cheap beer made from substandard ingredients. Tastes like metal, hay, and dirt. Thin and watery. But you can drink a lot of them with your jerkoff friends around a campfire. The price is the indicator when you buy this product. You don't buy this for the quality. You buy this for drinking large amounts. And that's a purpose it serves well. Cheap."
"D: One of the better macros I've had, and cheaper than BMC to boot. A good choice if you're short on cash, but wan't a beer."
"Light, pale yellow appearance. Minimal malt smells and taste characteristics. Thin mouthfeel."
"Havent seen this in the store for years. Thought it was long gone. Reading the commercial description made me laugh out loud. ""Another classic beer produced by Pabst Brewing."" Thats hard to say with a straight face. My dad used to drink this in the 60s. I drank it in High School some in the early 80s. Cheap American beer."
"No, this one is straw pale and a ridiculously easy drink, exactly what I want when I want something refreshing and light; which is what you get."
""
"Do you see how I rated this beer? 3.3 on the Richter Scale. I mean, good grief, give this beer a break. In 1964 when I first drank this ""mother's milk"" I would have rated it 3.3. It hasn't changed, thank goodness. This is the type of beer that my grandpa and dad drank when coming in from lawn mowing. Push mower I might add. Sheeesh, let's get with the program my friends and honor the name cherished by millions of teenagers in the middle 60's. From the Land of Sky Blue Waters, and always will be."
"overall this is not a bad beer for the price, i picked it up cause i thought it would be cool to try."
"The taste on first sip is all sweet malt and corn. A few more sips in and there's some citrusy hops, mostly lemon, in the background that is most noticeable near and through the finish but I can't say it does a good enough job to save this beer from a short and less than stellar review from yours truly."
"Drinkability: This was surprisingly balanced and refreshing, stays looking good, superior mouthfeel to other AML."
"I got a headache after I finished the 2nd can and needed to take asprin and switch to iced tea."
"Despite all of that, it is very drinkable. Would be good for the summer after mowing the lawn."
"And they had a cool macot once, dress up in his costume, visit a strip club, and see what happens..."
"As noted in the Old Style review, I continue to be impressed by Pabst. The beer they create (these two plus Pabst Blue Ribbon especially) is so superior to Budweiser, Miller and Coors products that I'm surprised at the sales figures. Well... maybe I'm not. Advertising dollars usually win out. Even though Hamm's is technically the loser of MacSmack XIV, it's still worthwhile beer for when you have a hankering to go old school."
"I found this little gem in the Batesville Liquior Store in Batesville, IN. it is not bad for a macrobrew. It is also very cheap! It has a decent mouthfeel and a crisp finish. You can taste the corn but that is not a bad thing in hoosierland!"
"Reviewing this for what it is, an inexpensive lawnmower beer. If you start with the macro brew idea firmly implanted you won't be disappointed. Drinkability is excellent because you won't notice the first 2 ,overall a better choice to me than Miller Lite or Bud for a softball game or the weekend fishing trip."
"D - Overall, it is fairly good. Considering the price it is a bargain."
"I bought a 40 of this and iced that baby up. It had a dirty corn taste, some sweet cereal malts and a little more body than your average cheap-o cruddy lager. It put a hurtin on me somethin' fierce though. Dull yellow in appearance, and almost no head. This one needs to get really cold before one should attempt it. Finish it quick before it warms up. A good accompaniment to Oreos, Cheatoz, bbq fritos, and honey-buns."
"Dim sun yellow. Thick and frothy white head. Great retention and some apeasing lace is left as well. Aroma is corny, grainy and sweet. Not off putting by any means. Very agreeable taste. Mild malts. Sweet wort like graininess. A touch of hop dryness...I think. Body is heft for a macro. I'd call it medium to medium-full. One of the better macros I've had in a long time."
"If you check my reviews you will note that I do not generally give such low scores, but in this case I'm going as low as possible to save my fellow advocates the pain."
"Get my buzz on- n"
"Hamms is a solid beer and great for drinking when PBR and Schlitz arent available. Its very bitter for the style, putting BMC brews to shame. The best part about drinking Hamms is that when you drink it, people watching all think, Wow, now thats a MAN!well, either that or, Wow, now thats a drunk! Hamms appearance is very similar to its cousins PBR, Old Style, Schlitz, and Blatz. When you poor Hamms into a glass (which should always be frosted because Hamms in a frosted glass has no negative flavors what-so-ever) you will see that it has a two inch thick, frothy white head for nearly 1.3 seconds. After that the froth becomes a thin, glass clinging lace. The body is hydrated urine with tons of carbonation. Hamms has a great lightly hopped metallic aroma and really tells you that the slightest amount of malt just might be involved someplace in the beer. The taste is even better and makes it obvious that Hamms is only made with sky blue waters. There is even a little bit of grain in Hamms. The Mouthfeel is light and as aforementioned, bitter. It goes down really well. The only bad thing about Hamms is that its proudly made by Unions, which means that for every $8 you spend on a case, a penny or so is going to eliminate American jobs and ruin our economy. Thats just sad but overall, the strong points of Hamms more then make up for that one small down side."
"Pours a pale straw color topped by a small, fizzy white head. Aroma is pretty much nonexistent. Not good, not bad, just not much of anything. Palate is lightly sweet, with very light adjunct malt and just a touch of fruity hops. Finish is clean and slightly bitter. Body is light, a tad fizzy, and a little bit tangy on the finish. I will say this - you can drink the hell out of this beer. Good in the large quantities preferred by non-discriminating types."
"What can I say? If I ever had to drink a lot of beers again, Id still have to choose Hamms. At $14 a 30 pack, you just can't go wrong."
"Well, perhaps I was being under the annoyance of those Central America beers with a lot of corn additives, but I really did not like this one. I found a lot of those in it, and really wanted to throw it away after a while. But going backwards, it had a nice bread smell."
"12 oz can obtained from a local grocery (HyVee) and consumed a couple days later. Pours a one-finger white fiszzy settling head over a crystal clear very light straw colored liquid. Smells mild hop and 2-row barley sweet. Tastes watery. Malt sweet is very gentle. Hop presence is there, but it's amazingly low. As it warms I get some saaz and maybe hallertauer. Watery mouthfeel and sharp carbonation that's actually part of the taste profile (because there's not much here to taste)."
"In conclusion, ""The beer refreshing"" - it certainly could be if the beer is cold enough and the day is hot enough. ""Land of sky blue waters"" - probably not, unless Milwaukee moved away from Milwaukee."
"The taste, coming from the same sensory mechanism of smell, is not that different. Its thin, very light in flavors that are predominantly sweet malt and just a turning edge of bitterness. Nothing strong, nothing assertive. But that makes it very drinkable. Plus, it's union made. That helps when it's this cheap."
"After checking my records, it has been some ten years since I have had a Hamms. The beer spews from the 12-ounce aluminum can a cloudless gold with a pleasant bright white head that is frothy in texture, with the resultant lace a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is all malt, crisp and the start sweet with the top cadaverous. Finish is caustic in its acidity, the hops bitter and unpleasant, quite dry and the taste sticks to your palate like crazy glue, a once decent beer that has now become a joke."
"Do yourself a favor and buy a schlitz or pbr instead.."
"And we come to another once of the crappy beers on my list to purchase and try. This is the current case I have sitting in my fridge. A friend of mine told me this was the worst beer he has ever had, and quite frankly he couldn't be wrong. This beer just has a bad carbonated corn taste that turns me off. It is more full than competing beers, but this isn't saying much at all. Each of the cheap macro brews has their own subtle taste after you are hit with the carbonation and watery generic beer flavor, and Hamm's has been the worst to date. I hold this up there with Stroh's. Schlitz still remains my number one go to beer when the funds are low and the need for feed is high. The case was under ten dollars so it is one of the few beers out there that you can still get somewhat of a bargain on."
"This tastes like the breath of a man who lives on the street and does nothing but drink Natural Ice. It tastes likes that man's pee. There is nothing, NOTHING, in this world worse than Hamm's. I just *had* to try another one, just to tell myself how bad it was. This was a shock from the past that I will not soon forget."
"This beer is almost acceptable."
"Medium gold with a big white head. Smells a lot like grain and a little like malt. Taste is actually more complex than most cheap beers. Starts out with a watery malt flavor, then passes into an adjunct flavor. For it's very low ($12.99 a 30 pack) price, this is quite a deal."
"Okay, with a beer fridge full of imports, and domestic micro-brews I really feel guilty about this one. I'm ""slumming-it"" in the greatest sense. But, and as the saying goes it's a BIG but, this stuff ain't bad. Sure, it lacks anything that could be called character, but it is what it is. This cheap macro-swill actually stands up. It's got more taste then you might think, and it's best served very cold in a tall glass. The quicker you drink it, the better, because it does show some negativity near the end. But, it IS refreshing, and the first few sips are pretty good. I've had it on tap, and I must say that adds something. But, at $4.50/12 pack, you can't beat it. It's a quiet beer that has survived. No mattter what part of the bottom shelf it's hiding on, beneath the Boulevards and the Fuller's etc., etc., etc., dig it out. This might surprise you. It's not trying to be great, but it does a pretty good job at being good, better than average, and most of all, refreshing."
"Good golly, here we go. Same look as most beers in this price catagory, reminds me of a headache. The smell actually gives me one (or was it the truckload of beer i had last night?). Either way, you are getting what you pay for with this one, a buzz. Taste is not great. Better priced than some of the other shitty beers however. All in all Not sweet."
"Remember when Hamm's was huge back in 70's. For a while, this stuff was truly foul. When General or Pabst owned this brand -- I really think they just mixed together some chemicals to make yellow foaming liquid that got yo buzzed. Today, I believe SABMiller brews this stuff -- and the quality of their operation shows in the product. Definitely worth a try."
"Hamm’s yes the beer from sky blue waters, Hamm’s refreshing, Hamm’s. Cripes, its been along time since I’ve seen this beer, and longer since I’ve had it. It pours from the can a panther piss yellow. A vigorous pour stirs up the bubbles, but not long enough to register a head that impresses itself. Thick, gorgeous Belgian lace! (true or false, the last sentence was not sarcastic). Adjuncty, barn yard aroma. The taste ain’t half as bad as it ought to be, mainly because its not got much taste at all. Sweet, corny, light bodied. Hell, I bought it as a lark, yet I’m not wholly dis-satisfied. Two dollars and forty-nine cents for a smoking hot six of Hamm’s, money not totally wasted."
"a side note...my favourite beer glass, which i sample most of my beers in, is a classic hamm's pint schooner. oh, the nostalgia...."
"Another of the great American classic lagers, the Hamm's brew filled a spot in the lineup of ""not bad cheap beers."" Good looking pour of clear straw color and a 3/4 inch white head. Malt nose with a faint trace of hops. The flavor moderates with warming and moves from sweet maltiness to a grain sense. It was a decent enough beer for the price, but not enough staying power against the macros."
"NOte this beer grew on me I did buy more..much more a good backyard BBQ swiller."
"This was one of the first beers i had when i went off to college. I tried it as i had never heard of if and wanted to do something different than all my roommates who were Bud lovers. It's not an expensive beer, and it shows. The flavor is not great, but not terrible either. It had a light aroma, and a slightly chemical taste. There was little or no corn / hops flavor, and seemed kind of watery. Either way, i can't find it anymore, and Bud has taken it's space on the shelves, which pisses me off. Overall, not bad. If it was there, i'd drink it."
"This is not as bad as expected. It is not a great beer, in fact, it borders on crap. But I wouldn't complain if I got one on a hot summer day. Pours straw yellow, with a dry white head which is gone in seconds. Taste is of corn. Hoppiness is weak. Very little if any malt flavor. Still, an interesting American lager."
"Light yellow, head reached about a ½ inch, spotty lace. The nose is sweet (like corn). The taste is sweet (like corn). Once this beer warmed, even minimally, it really started to taste cheap. When the beer was cold it was okay Now that I have tried Hamms I can move on, I dont need to go back."
"As far as cheap beers go, this is probably one of the best. Hamm's has a decent taste to it, but you still need to drink it quickly since its taste goes downhill when achieving room temperature. I would never buy Hamm's myself, but I don't have a problem drinking it at a buddies house."
"Since I'm from the land of sky blue waters I thought it was worth a shot as I really like the Hamms Genuine Draft..This is not a good macro lager, but it's not a horrible one either...It's drinkable...crisp and clean...some adjunct taste and smell (cornish)...I'm not sure how close this resembles the original Hamm's but it is not worth seeking out.  I think the original Hamm's was a Coors/Olympia type lighter/thinner style lager....this one seems  to have too much adjunct/corn taste to it...still it's not a horrible beer..This label I think was first sold to Pabst and now is in Miller's hands..."
"This beer was a very pale yellow color and formed really no head to speak of. The aroma was of grain and alcohol. The flavor was of grain and some alcohol. Very light beer and not much in the finish.I had totally forgotten about this beer. I really think that some macro beer companies need to rethink their policies. Cheap beer should have at least one redeeming quality, which is drinkability. This one does not have that."
"Holy sin. This was bad. Bad bad bad. It was rancid and tasted the part. Yeast from here to there. Not the good culture either. Something you'd go to the pharmacy for. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for it."
