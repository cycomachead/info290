"Meh. Okay summer beer, but nothing special at all."
"On draft at one of my favorite haunts.   Never seen it and asked ahead of time if it was any good....should have steered clear based on the barmaids response.  Maybe it will get better with this big plate of nachos that I'm about to eat but I doubt it.   I'll be switching up after this one."
""

"A better version of corona"
""
""
""
"This is just ""ok"". I'd get it over a Bud Light or something all day. That's about it though."
"One of my favorite beers. What sucks is winter time, no one buys it so it just sits on shelves. But summertime, one of the best beers. People waste money in Corona or expensive terrible Mexican beers. This ""island style lager"" is very smooth and light so goes great with any food also. 12 pack is 12$. Not too bad."
""
""
"One of the better terrible beers out there."
""
""
"Landshark incorporates a plethora of flavor, ensuring an infusion of fruity scents and tastes. The only problem is that it tastes like a fruity version of a mainstream American light lager."
""
"I was drinking a ton of this stuff when it was in cans in my area. Used to be my lawnmower beer. Cooler on the mower full of ice cold Landshark cans wasn't the worst thing in the world, by far!  Can't see myself picking them up in bottles for no real reason though."
""
"this is a perfect lager for a hot sumers day or just sitting around the house..."
"when this first came out, i kind of liked it, being a juvenile in my beer palate, and definitely preferring it to a corona (still do). it has less of the chemical off flavors of the other large scale island lagers, and is really pretty easy drinking. so yellow and bright and clear it almost looks to have a green tint in some lights, and while its real well carbonated, and cant hold much head. its smell is its worst feature to me, adjuncty and sweet, but the flavor is better, it drinks clean, and there is no residual weirdness or metallic tang to it at all. the carbonation is outstanding, and the refreshment value is high when its cold, but the clear bottles lend to skunking quickly, and if yours isnt real fresh, its probably terrible. i like the marketing, i like having an alternative to corona for that purpose, but for some reason this beer gives me brutal hangovers. i can drink imperial ipa all night, but three of these and im in trouble in the morning. not sure what does that..."
"Terrible.  Crap aimed at Jimmy Buffet fans.  Proving that saturating the market with advertising can sell anything."

"Corona-ish kind of taste, I tried it once, wouldn't buy it again."

"Winter blues making me dream of warmer weather and ....I just really enjoy the freshness and light feel of his beer in the summer."
"Bad even for an AAL. Sweet and pretty gross."
"This beer is one of the worst I have ever had."
""
""
"Overall I like this better than Corona. It might be closer to Sol lager than Corona. I enjoyed it and the price was $6.47 a sixer at Walmart. It is finally at a reasonable price point for this type of beer. My bottle says brewery is located in St. Louis, MO. not Jacksonville, FL."
"Yup did is a good beer"
""
""
"Extremely disappointed in this beer. Weak in flavor and consistency. I'll stick to Corona! I expected better from anything associated with Jimmy Buffett."

"Overall (3.83) : I desperately wanted to trash this beer because I hate how much publicity Landshark gets. I thought it was going to be horrible. A drain pour, even. But honestly, it's better than most of the macros out there by a nose, and it seems to be readily available and cheap to purchase. It's not amazing, but heck, it does the trick. You owe it to yourself to try this with a burger, a dog, or by itself on a hot afternoon."

"Had this at a backyard wedding this weekend.  This beer is marketed as if it were some craft version of Corona.  It tastes better than Corona but thatâ€™s not saying much.  The best thing that I can say about this offering is that it is union-made."

"Tastes good. Nice and refreshing. Its light. I like light beer, because i like how refreshing it is Ice Cold. I don't like drinking something heavy in the sun. This is perfect for fishing or bbq or a hot day."
""
""
"Believe it or not i like the adjunct style. I may not like the BMC adjunct lagers anymore, but i like high quality adjuncts. This is light. and sometimes, thats just what is needed. Pours a nice golden color. I like looking at this beer in a pilsner glass. bought one today and this looks nice in it. Its kind of low in complexity, but lagers for the most part are, or at least, so i've noticed. This is good. It beats bud light anyday."

"This beer is a nice golden yellow color sorta like a corona color, it smells great and taste similar to a light beer mixed with corona. its really easy drinking beer and i could drink this easily on a hot summer day or with a nice meal. Its not a heavy beer so its perfect for me."

"Landshark Lager was a light-bodied disappointment and, yes, I actually had some solid expectations. Ostensibly, I was expecting something of a lighter lager with tones of flavorful lime and refreshing hops, something I could easily down on one of these summer nights. Unfortunately, this is one of the most unremarkable beers I've tried in a while. The flavor is indicative of extreme amounts of corn and cheap grains, so much so that the ""Margarittaville Brewing Company"" label couldn't be further from an idea of what the final product actually tastes like. It is beyond and bland and almost entirely tasteless outside of overpowering corn. To make matters worse, my bottle wasn't as chilled as it could've been, which proved bad for about the first nine or ten ounces but detrimental and nearly undrinkable for the remaining two or so. For the brewing company's bestselling, most mainstream beer, it's surely a miserably tasteless and needless offering."

"The taste is unspectacular with its grainy malts and modest sweetness. Ends clean. Reasonably refreshing but overall pretty basic and boring. Hot weather lawn mower beer."

"The Land Shark was a really good beer. I had it on vacation once and I liked it a lot. You can tell that it is a lager by the taste of the beer. I liked the taste of it and how smooth it was when you drank it. This is one of my favorite beers. It smells really good as well. It is not too strong or too weak."

"Landshark is essentially all American lagers on steroids. Pours a light tan color with a 1/2-3/4 inch that sticks around. Smells malty. Tastes malty, with mild hoppiness. Moderate lacing. Bitter aftertaste. I will be buying this beer again because it is clearly the best American lager I've ever had."

"Enjoyed 4/12/14 at my daughter's birthday party. Servied in a long neck bottle with a lime wedge. Similar in appearance to Corona, but no skunky aroma. Taste has no off flavors as well. Slightly malty, and lime flavor of course. Mouthfeel is thin bodied and lower carbonation than average for the style. Overall its just a smooth, easy drinking lager that fit well with the scene, and great weather."

"It's very light--I'll give it that. Good for mass-consumption at an outdoor concert. But whereas Corona can hold up as being relatively flavorless as a refreshing summery beer, this one has that extra aftertaste of metallic unpleasantness that really makes this beer a smart one to miss. Don't bother."

"Nothing too amazing to report. Basically a corona with different packaging. Smell and taste were a bit skunky and it was light in both mouthfeel and appearance. It's popular due to availability and price and maybe a little from Buffet recognition. Overall you could pass this one by and not really miss anything."

""
""

"My favorite summer beer. A bit over priced, but worth it to me."
""
""

"This is drinkable, but a notch below other beers of this type like Modelo Especial and Corona. I wouldn't buy it out of my money, but it is decent enough to drink if it's free."

""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer isn't very flavorful, but it does manage to have a slight amount of bitterness to mask any sweetness from the malts. While not very exciting, it is rather drinkable."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Light yellow urine color in a clear bottle. Almost no head or lacing. It smells a lot like Corona. Tastes like it too. It's a little sweeter than Corona. Leaves a corny aftertaste that's a little sour. It's a pretty bad beer. It's not like I would turn it down if it was the last beer left but I don't think I'd buy it again. At least not on purpose."

"In the grand scheme of things Landshark is available all year round but should primarily be drank in the summer. It can be quite refreshing on a hot summer day. Better than Corona since you don't need to add a lime to it. Originally had on tap in Key West in Margaritaville, but better out of a bottle."

"I have an intense disdain for Jimmy Buffet and everything that he stands for, and I really wanted to hate this beer as well. Unfortunately for me, it seemed pretty decent for the style. This might not be a bad beer to have at the beach on a hot day. Then again, there are so many better options out there."
""

""
""
""
""

""
"I really wanted to enjoy this beer but the first whiff of skunky aroma turned me off right away. Nothing special about it exept for the marketing. Who wouldn't want a landshark advertising surfboard. I will not be buying it again. Add a little lime to it to make it palatable for the summer."

"O- thank goodness for mixed 6ers. I could not drink another 5 bottles; this ""1" is more than enough."
""
"Overall I wasn't a fan of this beer but I thought it was pretty close to being and average example of the style, this isn't a type of beer I would buy, but there's a good chance I would order one at a mediocre Mexican restaurant. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, not filling and pretty crisp, but the flavors couldn't hold my attention, one is enough for me and its a little hard to get through the whole bottle without just chugging it to get rid of it. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad and it was fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was way too skunky, but that's what happens when you put a a beer in a clear glass bottle. I wouldn't buy this beer again unless I was out to eat, but even then I would rather order a Negra Modelo, I would recommend this to die heart Corona drinkers but that's it. All in all, this beer is about the same as I remember it, not horrible for the style, but nothing that I enjoy drinking, I think Jimmy Buffet needs to stick to the music and leave the beer to the pros."

"Transparent lemon color. Soda-like head with minimal retention. Grain and rice aroma. Lots of rice adjuncts in the flavor with hints of malt. Subdued grass and lemon hop. Malt and adjunct flavors dominate. Light bodied and overly carbonated with no texture to enjoy. Overall, subpar but not too far behind other example for the style."
"It is possible I had a bad bottle so I will review again next time I do an all-sorts pack from the market."
""
""
"Overall - Would not seek out, but would have again if the establishment did not provide a better choice."
""
""

"This is a better version of a Corona. Add a lemon and it may make it a 5 but we didn't have any. Not sure why it gets such a bad rap on here but I enjoyed it. You can drink a lot of it and not feel heavy and the taste is solid and palatable for many servings."
"This is my go to beer when I head to the beach because it is a better tasting mass produced beer than the likes of Miller lite, coors, and bud, however, not by much. I am not as snobby to say that it shouldn't even be considered a beer, but it is what it is. For me it is a great beer that is refreshing on a hot day and goes great while playing frisbee or volleyball on the beach. I will continue to buy it because it is cheap and it tastes great on a hot day."

"I'm not going to say it's a bad beer because it isn't but you know, it's another Corona clone."

"This is like if junk local adjunct tried to make a weird Mexican lager crossover. Mexican lager is already not usually good, this is bad. I think they could save this by investing in better ingredients, but that would probably cut into the profit margin. Also, killing the bottle cost and using a ""plain"" bottle and label may help cut costs to increase actual quality. While the appearance and mouthfeel are actually not bad, the funk smell and awful taste are bad enough to cut into my overall. This shouldn't be bought. Buy Tecate, Dos Equis or even Corona before this."

"O: This beer is easy to drink and not offensive but this is not a good beer and I will not be getting another one of these - part of my project to balance out all of the good craft beers I have been drinking with some below average brews."
"I don't understand why this beer has scored so low on the site and there are other mainstream BMC lagers which score so much higher. Seems unfair. I was pleasantly surprised in fact. Poured a 1.5"" white head of average lifespan. The body is the standard clear straw yellow. It smells mildly of grass but also some citrus. Taste doesn't have the citrus but it has the grass and some mild malt. And there's actually a slight bitter aftertaste nicer than you get in most BMC lagers. This actually isn't bad for a cheap lager. Mine was brewed in Missouri instead of Florida so I don't know but maybe the brewery and freshness made a difference."

"but, back to the beer . . . . it's garbage. i mean, it's great on a hot summer afternoon after mowing the local golf course. and the first 6'er i drank was okay. but let's face the truth- it's below even BUDWEISER. and that's a harsh statement i dont feel comfortable uttering in a back alley. okay. maybe not below bud. but you get my point. it was hard to dislike this beer when the man responsible for it is an utter hero in my eyes. my apologies for the terrible scores . . . . can i remind you that Mr Buffett is also a great AUTHOR....? he is one of SIX authors to have a best seller on the NY TImes list in BOTH fiction and non-fiction. truly talented individual and complete hero in my world. i suppose i cant blame him for selling CRAP- so many others do, also, in this world and so get away with it."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. The presentation of this telegraphs the experience of drinking this beer; clear glass bottle and screw cap. Nice graphics though. Pours a light, clear orange-yellow, thin white head dissipates quickly to a ring around the glass. Unsurprising adjunct and malt aroma with a hint of skunk at first. Flavor starts out pleasantly enough with light, sweet malt and faint hops but the adjunct components soon dominate and then abruptly, all flavor is gone. A very watery, bland finish that took me by surprise. Fortunately no skunking to the flavor, although that may have added a little interest to the finish. Mouth feel thin with light carbonation, but appropriate for the style. Gets extra half point for being pretty much what its packaging promises. No off flavors and would do on a desert island. Glad I got this beer and brewer ticked off; my first reviewed American adjunct lager! Moving onâ€¦.."
""
""
""
"I am a little biased towards this beer because I get it free from my father regularly as it is his favorite. It certaily lacks the complexity of some of the better beers on the top 100 list, however it does serve its purpose as a light refreshing summery beer. There are not any beers that spring to mind as preferential for on the beach, though Jimmy Buffet's songs help make it more enjoyable as well!"

"16 ounce can, I picked it up as a single somewhere. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about a half inch white head. There's a small amount of lacing. It smells like sweet malt, corn, and that's it. And the taste is the same as the aroma, it's all sweet malt and corn. It doesn't taste bad, but it's not like it's good either. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's certainly not hard to drink at all. For the style of beer it is, it's not bad. It's worth trying if you can get a single can or bottle, but I wouldn't ever buy a 6 pack of this. With that being said, I wouldn't turn it down if someone gave me one."
""
""
""

"This actually turned out better than I expected, as I was going into this thinking it would be quite putrid. Definitely a hot weather beer, and as such it should be consumed very cold."

"Pours from the 12 oz can a fairly decent pale yellow with a giant foamy head that quickly settles into a modest collar. We have the usual macrobrew fizziness going on inside the glass. Aroma is of wet grass clippings left overnight in the rain. 1st sip is a bland, some what watery mix of straw, overcooked veggies, and maybe a hint of lemon rind. Palate is light and fizzy. Overall, it's your basic bland fizzy macro beer, the kind of stuff that will be a big hit on $2 draft night at the local dive bar. Glad I didn't pay for this one..."

"Overall: I would not have bought this if it had not been $20 for a case with a $10 rebate. Still, I ended up giving away 2 of the 6 packs. I just didn't want a case after a couple of these. Interesting enough my bottle looks just like the picture, except instead of Jacksonville, FL it says St. Louis, MO. Found that a bit odd. Not recommended, will not buy again."

"Landshark is by far the smoothest American Style Lager on the market. It has a fairly light body and mild hop bitterness. There is some good malt sweetness with zero aftertaste. The taste is not complex, and this will cause Landshark to get low scores from craft beer drinkers, but I would recommend this beer for people who normally drink light beer, but want to try a regular beer."
"I'm not sure I find it helpful or relevant when folks rate a beer like Land Shark and use a language that clearly shows that they are comparing it to darker or more full bodied beers like reds and browns. I respect your opinions, but in my mind rating a beer does not mean you rate it as to the preference of the beer type you prefer. Would you compare a Riesling to a Cabernet? Of course not. Can you imagine rating a Riesling and then saying you detected no tannins? If you are going to compare or rate Land Shark Lager, then wouldnâ€™t it be better to compare and rate it against other light lagers? I like reds and browns better too, but certainly not on a hot summer day. Sometimes I just want a lighter beer so I can eat my burger and then go out and toss the frisbee around on the beech. So compared to other lagers of similar weight, Land shark is a darned good beer. It has a hint of citrus, grass, and just a tiny hint of grains and cornâ€”just as a light, refreshing, thirst quenching lager should."

"Dude, don't buy this, unless you like Corona, in which case you shouldn't be on BA. This stuff is pretty gross, it's beer with little taste, high carbonation, and clean feel (like water). You can taste a little maltiness in the background but the day old piss from the rusty toilet bowl taste prevails. Ok, I exaggerate, but, still, this is un worthy."

"O-Bud with a little flavor and no headache, not bad for an AAL. What is bad is that it is way overpriced for what it is. Sixes of this go for about as much as some crafters. I guess there are a lot of licensing fees built into the number when I consider the Buffett empire. Oh, well."

"O - Its definitely better than Busch or Miller but definitely not something I'd ever by a case of"

"Overall: One of the best AALs I have had yet. If Iâ€™m ever in the mood to get sloshed on something light but with good flavors, this would certainly be a valid option."

"Not sure why, but I hear some random SNL skit blaring in the back of my memory when I hear the name of this beer... Anyway, it pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of white froth. The nose (how is this not skunked!?) comprises rice, hard water, and a touch of what may or may not be grass. The taste brings in more of the same, along with the lightest possible addition of wheat, and a mild, almost fruity sweetness, though this is also decidedly light. It's not necessarily bad, but the almost nonexistent nature of the flavors doesn't do this beer many favors. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, a sad little beer, one that I wouldn't really hate to drink again, but also one I would never ask for again, either."

"O: This is a typical American adjunct lager. Far from great, but also not entirely unpalatable if served cold. Avoid this one unless you simply must have a beer and there are no better choices at hand."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Look, in terms of American Adjunct Lagers, this one stands above many others. Much better than anything the big macro's throw out there, and i'd prefer this to a heavy craft porter, stout or imperial on a hot day in july."

""
""
"This beer rates right up there with Beast Ice, in other words, it's the most disgusting excuse for beer I've ever been conned into sampling. It was free, and worth every penny. Tastes like a cross between dirty dishwater and rotten bananas. Bad, bad beer. Something only assholes would drink there's no Coors to be had."

"This is a perfect beer for people who don't like beer. It is totally inoffensive, but then again. neither is water for the most part. It is a good beer for slamming down when one is very thirsty, but there is just not enough flavor for me to consider it anything other than just another hum drum light tasting American adjunct lager."

"This is a pretty decent beer for the style. There aren't any off flavors, but it is a little sweet. I'd drink this again."
"A decent adjunct that is great for tailgating or parties, but bad for when you wan to enjoy a well crafted beer. Nothing offensive about it but there just isn't much there."
"M: pretty drinkable in same way as ginger ale."
"The body is light with lively carbonation. Overall this one is off putting. Seems to have some flavors that just donâ€™t belong."
"Overall â€“ It's not horrendous.. especially when drank very cold right from the bottle. But still, there is no reason why I would ever buy this beer again."
"Change it up from Corona and the like."
"From Jimmy Buffetâ€™s Margaritaville? As if such a place existed. One more lousy, fizzy, mass produced lager. Sold in clear glass bottles so as to insure skunking. Pours clear. Thin bodied. Awful finish. What a waste of resources. Pouring down the drain might cause water pollution. Puts the VILE in Margaritaville. [eh! Even the puns are lousy with this one.]"
"Since I need 20 more characters for this review, do not insult Jimmy Buffet by playing ""Margaritaville"" when trying this!"
"Tastes the same as the nose. Although not as salient. It's cold, and that's good. I don't want to try this warm. Sweet, corn, stale malt, old sock. Drain pour"
"Makes no sense to buy this when Miller, Rolling Rock and Coors Light are so much cheaper."
"Bottle: Poured a super light yellow color lager with a small fizzy head with almost no retention. Aroma consists of light corn adjunct. Taste is dominated by lightly sweet adjunct with almost no other discernable characteristics. Body is quiet watery with average carbonation. This one was a very light and watery version of a macro."
"That last always puts me in mind of a lyric from the Sex Pistols' ""EMI"" - ""Limited edition with an unlimited supply"". Hee hee. The Crack & Glug was uneventful, but I was reminded of Little CANned Riding Woody: My, what a big head you have! Two-plus fingers of dense, creamy, bone-white head with excellent retention. Color was a pretty lemon-yellow with lots of CO2 bubbles and NE-quality clarity. Nose was as close to awful as I have put my schnoz near in a while. It smelled like a combination of slilage (fermented corn cobs stored for pig feed in the winter), which I CAN abide in the style, but it also had a metallic twang which makes people think that it was caused by the CAN rather than the brewing process. Mouthfeel was unobtrusive, just better than watery, surprising, given all of thee carbonation in evidence. The taste, however, was not too bad. It was very sweet, like candy that uses corn sugar, but it did not evince the metallic smell I noticed on the nose. It tasted like a sweeter version of a style that I have tasted many, many times over. Finish was moderately sweet, but overall, it was a pretty boring beer. I now wonder which/what island it used as its style so that I CAN avoid visiting there."
"The taste is fine and I could imagine sipping this all day on the beach. I would for sure get this over a Corona just to be different. I am a big fan of the look and feel of this beer. There wasn't too much head or retention and it looks about the same as a Corona or other macro brews."
"If I poured this into a pint glass and drank it indoors, I would probably give lesser marks...but to be honest, it wasn't all bad under the circumstances. I still think it was better than bud light and coors light as far as the aftertaste was concerned."
"I was in the market for a ""fizzy, yellow beer"" to drink after a day in the sun that came in a clear bottle since I didn't have proper glassware. Wish I would have stuck with the old stand-by, Miller High Life. This tasted like next to nothing - some grain sweetness and less carbonation than I was hoping. Drank from the bottle, so the aromas were almost undetectable..cereal factory smells maybe. I also paid $7 plus tax and crv for these, and I could have almost had a twelver of the champagne for that price. Had one while hiking the next day, and let me tell you that these guys need to be ice cold to get down."
"D: I don't know why on earth I would ever buy this again when there are a thousand cheaper lagers at every filling station. I will grant that it doesn't leave me as bloated as, say, Miller or Coors, so given that narrow choice, I'd pick a Landshark. But geez I wouldn't be happy about it."
"Overall I think it's creative calling this an island lager, because the only time you might want to drink this flavorless embarrassment is if you were stranded on an island for months without water and a fire had ignited in your mouth that needed extinguishing."
"Your typical macro tasting lager. No taste, no smell, nothing special at all. I guess, no smell is better than a horrible smelling beer, the same goes for taste. This is a WEAK lawnmower beer. Drink water."
"o - Overall not a very good beer, with some light skunkiness in the taste. Seems like a low(er) rent Corona to me. Wouldn't seek it out."
"overall, this beer was left in my fridge by a friend, not the worst beer on earth but not something ill ever buy"
"A very watery beer, probably meant for hot boat outings on the water . Would not be my choice in a beer store."
"All in all, this is an easy-to-drink light beer probably better suited to cooling you in the summer or getting you drunk than providing you with an exemplary taste experience."
"Not something I'll want again. Has some decent characteristics, but in the end, it its what it is."
"Wow. It almost tastes like a malted beverage made to take on the appearance of beer. It did not have a distinct malt or hop flavor. It seemed overly carbonated. Perhaps that is why it did not have any distinction in taste or smell. I suppose I would reach for this before a wine cooler. Yikes."
"It is clear, yellow in color. Minimally bitter but little to no mouthfeel beyond the mild carbonation. Where it beats out Budweiser, Miller etc is the aftertaste isn't as offensive. Much to be desired but not the worst beer in the world."
"Overall: Probably better than most adjunct lagers, but really that is not saying much."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a light body, light carbonation and good drinkability; a light a refreshing beer that basically has no flavor. Pass on this one as it's just plain boring."
"Mouthfeel is good. It's nice and light, which is the intention."
"O:I wouldn't mind masking what little flavor this beer has with a lemon or a lime. The only good thing I can say about this beer is that I like it better than Corona."
"o - meh. ill still stick with the red stripe if there isnt really any other options."
"Landshark Lager was pale yellow in color with good clarity. It had a white head with decent retention and lacing The smell was clean with cereal grain and a little sweetness. The taste was light grain and a bit sweet with a touch of hops. The finish was short and dry. It was light bodied with medium carbonation. Overall it's kind of boring, but would be just fine if outside on a hot day."
"O:This is a typical AAL beer, so because of that itâ€™s a great American lager. Besides the sour taste you first get this beer is a great one to knock back on a hot day."
"Got to take this as it is, not a classic, but a refreshing summer pounder. I will enjoy again!"
"Beer is super thin and nearly as remarkable as the aroma. Not at all. It is mildly sweet late and grainy throughout, at least there is a minimal aftertaste. Overall, gross. Excuse me for a moment, I blew out of flip flop, must have stepped on a pop top. And other disgusting lyrics to go with a gross beer."
"O-Overall I was dissapointed because I am a jimmy buffet fan and it was not what I expected. I would drink if there was no other options."
"O: Not a great beer..but I've had worse. If i were given the choice I'd take Corona over this. Very overpriced, High life and Coors original both taste better and are cheaper so I'll be going that route next time."
"Not all beers need to be IIPA's to be good. If you want an easy drinking, well made American lager, give this beer a try"
"This is rather horrific. The bad aftertaste and skunkiness add to what would otherwise just be non-descript and forgettable"
"Way to go Jimmy are making this boring excuse of a beer. This couldn't be more like Corona in any manner. I'm sure that adding a lime would help this beer along. It was skunky and kind of on the flat side. Very watery and bland. I don't plan on ever having this beer again. I don't think I'd order it even at a Jimmy Buffet concert in support of him. I apologize, but I just don't care for this brew."
"A crisp, refreshing, watery light beer with a touch of skunk and citrus. That sums it up. It isn't bad for a hot day. The touch of citrus is nice, but the skunk makes the beer suck. It isn't as skunky as some clear bottles can be, but it is boring and watery. It does have overcarbonation and a crisp feel. Maybe a lime could make it drinkable."
"I could through this back all day fishing or lawning the yard. It is light on the senses and watery but I think it is a good summer beer. Nothing special about it except its drinkability."
"So, I'm on vacation in Key West and I decide to take the Fury Ultimate Adventure with my kids (snorkling, para-sailing, jet skiing, etc.) and at the end of the day is an all you can drink fest. E&J Gallo wine and spritzers, bud light and...Landshark. So I imbibed. It was obviously a ""session", so what the hell. It was 80 degrees, sunshine like you dream about, salt air, ocean breeze and cold beer. Would I have picked it? No, but the guy kept coming around with the pitcher as I laid out on the catamaran deck and he quickly became the 5th most favorite person in my life (next to my kids, my girl and the hot 20-something blond sunning next to me)"
"Light looking beer. Had this with dinner at cheeseburger in paradise. This went well with dinner. Slight foam, goes down smooth. Could really drink several of these. No bad aftertaste. Not filling. I hope they come out with possibly darker versions of this beer or different variations. A little more hoppy taste would be good."
"D -Drinkable enough, it is refreshing. This is OK, for the style. I've also had this on tap, and thought it was better than bottled. Bottled version is better than the average supermarket lawnmower beer, but not by much. Will I buy it? Probably not for me, but it's a good thing to have around for buddies who like Budweiser."
"Very clear yellow color with a small white head and high carbonation. Aroma is grainy and corny with a touch of something hops. Flavor is bland and lightly grainy. Density is light and a lot of carbonation. Not much to the brew to be offensive but not much there to rate either. Sold in a a clear bottle but even the particles found in light stay away from this beer."
"D: I had to check the label again because it seemed like an average light beer, but really is not?"
"D: Not a big fan of this one, its not offensive just not something i would go out of my way to buy. Alcohol is well... lets just say i had to check to see if it was NA beer, taste didnt improve with warmth."
"Overall this is a below average beer. I thought the taste was lacking in every aspect. Other than being a drinkable beer not much here."
"Was at a restaurant without any beer selection, so this was the only new beer to try. This looks like the typical yellow fizzy lager. Head dies down fairly quickly, no lacing at all. Bland macro lager smell and flavour. Carbonation was so high, which made this hard to drink. I'll never have again."
"I would drink this in the future if offered, but I would not buy it again, especially for $7.50 (six-pack)!! Maybe if it was a $1.50."
"I bought this beer on mistake. Not much to say here, just another Corona from a different brand. It is a flavorless beer, perfect for those who love the mainstream beers like Miller Light and Bud light. You actually have to put a lime in the bottle to give it any flavor at all. I was very disappointed with this beer."
"One of the easiest to drink and one of the most refreshing beers out there. Jimmy Buffett knows his market (summer pounder beer)! The only complaint I have is that this beer (along with Red Stripe & Corona) are way overpriced for the style of beer. You can buy a comparable Rolling Rock for 1/2 the price. If I spend $9 a six pack, I'm buying a craftbrew with high quality ingredients not this type of beer."
"this is a very nice beer--it reminds me of red stripe and the other beers from jamaica/trinidad. a little cirtrus, reminds of the caribbean, nice light color, tangy, crisp. a very drinkable beer, easy to have a second. i have mostly found it at stadiums in dc and new jersey, and it is reliably tasty and tangy, i choose it above most others."
"Drinkability: I guess so, if it's hot on a beach perhaps in Iowa...would go along nicely with the corn fields bordering the beaches there."
"D - Easily Kill A Six Pack"
"In the situations that I drank it, it was drinkable. I can't say this is one that I'd come back to, but if forced to choose between adjunct lagers - one could do worse."
"Poured in a Pilsener-Bayern glass. Look: Bright golden color, creamy and thick foamy head but quickly disappeared, leaving nothing. Smell: Fresh corn and cooked vegetables. Taste: Almost zero, but some corn and root essences. Mouthfeel: Very clean, damper thirst, mild bitterness and extra soft body, almost watery. Drinkability: Not bad, first quencher, nothing else to say."
"I like this particular beer, during a summertime setting or a chill night. Like it says on the bottle, its an ""Island Style Lager"" which makes sense cause this is the type of lager you would want to drink while on the white sands of a caribbean island."
"Looks like every other adjunct ever -- straw color, thin white head. Smells like nothing, virtually no smell -- maybe a little corn or a little rice (some sort of adjunct.) Tastes like corn with a little sweet malt with a hop dry finish. Mouthfeel is awfully thin (like most in its class.) Drinkability is a complete joke. Another beer for the people lost in the abyss (not the beer) of mass market beer."
"When i poured the beer into my pint glass it had very little head to it on top of a pale yellow color body. The smell is light of corn and little bit of hops. It has a nice light taste to it, which goes down smooth. Nice mouth feel to it and i think is very drinkable for a summer time beer. I wouldn't drink it all the time but once in a while it would be good."
"So sad. Targeting the vast market of Parrot Heads, riding the wave of Buffett escapism visions of kicking back on the beach, with just enough Corona overtones to complete the image of the perfect beach beer - how nice if this had turned out to be a nice, crisp lager. Rather than vault the Corona bar, this beer slinks just below it. Rough, corn adjunct flavor, watery body and flat hops finish. Requires a lime to be palatable. I guess that was what they were going for."
"Poured with a surprising good head of dense bubbles of wedding white. Head started at three fingers, but fizzled down to a donut looking covering. Lace slides down the side of the glass as fast as it is placed. This brew presents a very light amber color, rating a SRM 3 on the beer color chart. The beer smells like wet straw and a breeze of sweet malt. Tastes much like it smells; malt, corn, and just a little lime. Very little feeling in the mouth, watery and little else. Heard this was quite good, but I wouldn't serve this to those who like a flavorful beer, but still it is a bit better than most domestics."
"Light bodied, thin, and watery. No need to try this again. Avoid."
"This is a good beer to have on a hot summer day when you're having a barbecue or sitting by the pool. It is light and refreshing and it goes down easy. It has a light golden color similar to Corona. It has a citrusy, lemony smell and taste. It has a watery mouthfeel without a lot of carbonation, which makes it very drinkable. I could easily have 3 of these in one sitting. I would prefer this beer over any other ""tropical"" beers that I've had. Overall, this is a simple, decent beer that doesn't try to be anything fancy."
"overall not really sure what just happened. soo light, it was almost mistaken for water and i should have ordered a tea to be honest."
"This I consider a summer beer. Goes down easy with a splash of lime or lemon.To really spice it up add a shot of Tequila..I drink this as an alternative to Corona when don't feel like drinking really expensive beers. It hits the spot every now and then especially on the beach or by the pool.."
"A great and easy drinking beer in the summer and dreams of hot weather in the fall and winter. It is a lot fresher then most Mexico beers. I love it. I don't care who makes the beer and that should not matter. It comes in 6 packs and 12 pack bottles. I wish it came in cans."
"D-Well they're easy to drink... but thats about it. There is nothing special about this beer. It reminds me of a crappy Corona. It is generic in just about every way. You might as well buy bud light instead."
"Anyway it's a decent summer beer that's nothing special, but impressed those at my recent barbecue who didn't know better. It's got more panache then a rolling rock, thanks to smart marketing. It'll leave your guests thinking better of you than if you loaded the cooler with Keystone Ice."
"Taste is better than one might imagine, actually not too bad of an AAL. Very clean with just a mild graininess and thats about it. One of the least flavorful, non-light lagers I have ever had...which is not a bad thing, considering that is what they were going for. I've spent two dollars on much worse than this."
"D: I couldn't even finish half this beer. Maybe I'm spoiled by Belgians, but this is just bad. The approach to an ""Island Style Lager"" seems to be to make it taste sweet, but more than this does a beer need. The only good thing about Landshark is the shark fins embossed in the bottle."
"Overall a bad beer. Let's face it it's popular due to Jimmy Buffett's involvement. Brown bottles might help too. Not recommended."
"This is definitely a step up from the usual skunkfests from Mexico and the Caribbean, but when you're looking up from the bottom rung, there's still a long way to go 'til daylight..."
"D- easy to drink, especially if you're more a 'strong-beer' drinker. At a BBQ or a get together, i would easily reach for this one in the cooler. not too bad, it is what it is."
"I prefer this to most Mexican or island beers. Somehow it doesn't have the formers typical skunkyness. Overall, for what it is, Landshark is a decent brew."
"It's OK, would choose it equally amongst corona or similar beers if nothing else was available, but that's about it. Don't plan to buy again."
"This was pretty much an OK summer beer. Good with hot weather and a BBQ (what I had with it)."
"It's plenty drinkable with no foul tastes and a low alcohol content, but I definitely won't be seeking this one out again."
"It's got a cool name, but that can't save this beer."
"I partook of this beer over at a friend's house. I thought the name of the beer was intriguing as it reminded me of my ultimate frisbee days in college. But, like the ultimate frisbee landshark, this beer was also rather unimpressive. The beer poured clear and golden. There was a head right after the pour, but it completely disappeared after a few short moments leaving a rather unimpressive glass. The beer had little flavour. I think the only way to enjoy this one is to get a nice cold glass and drink after a hard workout, making it more of a replenishing fluid, than a beer."
"This isn't a world beating lager by any standards, but it was an ideal thirst quencher and my notes told me to give in an overal score of around 4, so I have!"
"This light beer has all the attributes of a classic lager -- pale. golden appearance and an easygoing flavor profile that's more on the malty side. The clean, crisp taste compares more than favorably to Corona, so summer beer fans looking for a light and tasty alternative to the more mainstream ""light"" "beers"" should find Landshark ultimately satisfying. I say give this one a chance. You may be pleasantly surprised."
"Taste very close to Corona but still lacks the skunkiness. I dropped a wedge of lime into it. Drinks easy and just a good lager for a hot summer day. Really nothing too special about it but it tastes good...better than a CL or BL and quenches thirst. Again, if you want a light lager or a good summer-type beer kicking around, this is a good one to have. It's Corona-esque but without it tasting like a skunk popped a squat in it. I'll keep a few stocked this summer along w my Sam Summer's, etc."
"One good thing I can say is that the drinkability is good. Relatively low ABV and probably a good thirst quencher served ice cold."
"I was a little dissapointed in the beer, but that could have easily just been the location at which I had it. I am giving it a low score for now, maybe in the future I wil give it another look."
"The smell of Landshark is good, in spite of being in a clear bottle, I've had imports that smell like a family of skunks died in the bottle, this one is good, and the taste is decent too. If you want a reasonably priced beer that is better than your average mass produced lager, this beer will fit the bill."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are what I consider average, not detrimental but nothing makes it stand out."
"This poured a clear pale gold with moderate white head. It smelled like dirty grassy hops and sour lager yeast, with some lemon and wheat. It tasted like mild lemon and grassy hops, with sweet and sour lager yeast and bready malt. It was thin with lots of carbonation, and had a light bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very generic pale lager. There wasn't much to enjoy in the scent or taste or body. It was at least light and crisp for summer drinking, similar to a Corona. Easy to consume, but not easy to justify drinking."
"D- It's actually really good if you have that lime, and I know your probably sick of hearing about the lime, but come on no lime, no Land shark for me!"
"I'll file this experience away as a positive one if I should ever encounter this brew again."
"The mouthfeel is overcarbonated, thin, and lifeless. The high carbonation hurts the drinkability. After a few hesitant sips, I realized I had to choke some of this down quick and it wasn't fun. Stick a lime in here and it's tolerable, but I would rather have something else."
"Overall: I know I keep saying ""Corona"" but I feel like it's a fair comparison. Overall, it's neon, saltier, more carbonated Corona. It's fine. Stick to Corona."
"This is a dangerous beer. It has the lightness of a beer like rolling rock without the taste of alcohol. You could drink a lot of this and be really drunk with out really knowing what hit you. It is a really smooth beer to drink and there is not that much of a taste to it. It tastes very light in your mouth and doesn't even really smell like beer. A little expensive, but still a good beer."
"Overall Impression: Not a fan of Jimmy Boofay's music or his version of Corona. I've had worse though. It's still better than Shit, and Shit Lite, but not much."
"Drinkability- Is a lighter beer, kind of plain would drink it on a hot day that's about it"
"The beer has a pale yellow color with a white head and much carbonation. The aroma seems to be a typical bland. The beer has a very light taste although a bit refreshing. When it is served very cold it is easy to drink. Neighbor served this for the first BBQ of the year, which had a tropical ""Parrothead"" sort of theme. On the bright side there was no Corona or Coors Light."
"D: For the style...meh, why not?"
"= what can be said about this beer? no depth, only the sweet grass and adjunct tastes. it does what it does, which is facilitate inebriation in a expedient manner."
"Pours a clear very light yellow with a smallish white head and no lacing. The smell is weak with some lemon and floral hints. The taste is light with lemon,lime,weak hops, and some earthy floral flavors. Not impressive. The m/f is light with the few flavors mixing Ok. Let's face it, this is a Spring Break get loaded beer in Key West. Not horrible, but not the best summer beer."
"Overall: The first time I had this I really liked it, I don't know why. The Second time: son, I was disappoint. This beer does nothing to stand out beyond other light summer lagers. I wont buy this again. If I want a cheepie for a summer BBQ, I'll grab a Sapporo, Dos Equis or a Red Stripe before this."
"I usually keep some of this around for some of my less adventurous friends. Would be OK doing the yardwork, but I agree with a previous review--I'll just pick up some Rolling Rock to fill the yardwork need."
"However, see my bottle review."
"D - Would not drink it again and wouldnt recommend it to anyone I like."
"Pours a very light yellow color that is very clear with less than a finger of white head that receeds very fast. It is almost comical how once the bottle is cracked open, big bubbles of carbination race out of the solution. Strangely enough, if you look close there are small particles that are stuck in suspension and look like little fuzzers and pieces of stuff that does not resemble yeast...hmmm wonder what that is. Aroma has some sulfur notes and a bit of citrus and something reminding me of bubblegum. Taste is mildly citrusy with a very thin body and lots of carb with a crisp finish. Everything about it is your typical american adjunct except for the fruit/citrus factor which maybe is the ""island lager"" aspect of it. This isn't a type of beer that I would get thirsty for and go out of my way for, but I would drink a few after cutting the grass or doing yard work."
"Cheers!"
"Insert standard ""clear, pale straw yellow pour."" Head retention is nil, but it does have quite a bit of carbonation rising from beneath. Smell's a hair on the skunky side and also smells very sweet. Goes down with ease and is a much better choice in August than January here in Ohio. I'd rather save a couple bucks and have sixer of Rolling Rock."
"One of my favorite beers because it is all around great. From a bottle the apperance is very nice. The smell is hoppy with a little grass hints. The taste to me is great. It has a very crisp taste and a easy going mouthfeel. It is quite carbonated but it doesn't make the mouthfeel unberable. To the drinkablitly is great it goes down smooth and will defintley do the trick in my opinion one of the best island brews that brewed here in the states."
"Poured this into my Flying Fish pint glass. The beer is a piss yellow colour, reminds me of Corona a bit, fizzy white head with some lacing, smells of burnt corn and some skunk, tastes of burnt corn with a little bit of citrus. Refreshingly smooth and crisp carbonation. This is a beer I would only drink if desperate and in 90+ degree weather"
"This is incredibly thin, but, like most of its style, is crisp. As long as it's cold, I could see it being refreshing for someone who could tolerate the taste. Carbonation is moderate."
"Had these at a friends house. For some reason, I actually poured mine into a glass. Slight foamy head, pretty much looking like a Corona. Left behind a lot of lacing for an adjunct. Smells like an adjunct and tastes like one too. Easy to drink though and tastes remarkably similar to a BMC. Oh wow! Turns out Budweiser owns Margaritaville Brewing. What a surprise. Luckily, it didn't taste skunked, which surprised me given the clear bottling. Overall, very boring and not strong enough to get you drunk without downing lots of them. Cool packaging though. Avoid."
"Landshark is an adequate lager, nothing more."
"D- Average drinkability; good for cooling down after playing football in August, but utterly lacking in redeeming features that would make me take this over a PBR or Coors original."
"A good summer beer. Poured slightly dark for the style with a one finger head that actually stuck around. Smell is light and crisp with a hint of citrus sweetness. Taste is good but it's a little watery. Great for a summer picinic with friends, lounging at the pool or on the beach. Gotta be in the right frame of mind for this one! Put on some Buffet music and lounge! A good beer."
"Fuller bodied than I expected for the style. Bready yeast notes with some slight crisp light fruit notes and a very subtle hop presence in the finish. Not very interesting but at the same time not offensive. Much better than I thought it would be and it goes down very smooth. Very drinkable decent version of a style that is generally putrid."
"My expectations for this was that it would be a cheap corona knockoff. After trying it a few times, and to my surprize, I prefer this to corona. Its pale, fizzy, very light flavored with little hop aroma. But that's what its supposed to be. What I found appealing was that - instead of the trademark 'skunk' flavor of corona - Landshark actually has a light fruitiness in the background. Throw that lime away, this is real refreshment."
"The beer pours a pale yellow with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a crisp, clean pilsner malt and adjunct scent with little to no hop aroma and a dry lager yeast smell. It's nothing spectacular, but it's true to style. The taste is average. It has a smooth, pilsner flavor with a bit less malt character. It's weak in nature, thus the quaffability. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's not a craft brew, but it's one hell of a hot weather beer, just like it was intended."
"Great beer to have if you are out-side cooking some carne asada or at the beach. Clear bottle and golden color makes this beer attractive... This mild brew goes down smooth with slight hops aftertaste but very enjoyable... I like my brews with a slight kick and this beer lacks that... Would much rather have this one than a Budlight for sure..."
"Not a first choice, but in my limited location, I go for it fairly consistently."
"This is a very drinkable lager, but there just is not enough there to get me to buy it."
"Thinking this was a fluke ""bad bottle"" I gave it another try at another location and had the exact same impressions. I will not be buying this stuff again."
"Nothing overly impressive in any way. Basically this is American Corona. Great for a slightly darker alternative in the mass produced ballpark swill market. The one bright point is it does go down easier and with a little more flavor than some others. Good with a nice, large helping of hot wings!"
"D: Not very flavorful, goes down quite easily since there's not much to it, not filling at all, mild kick, it's obvious that this beer targeted to the masses as a poundable easy-drinking beer just like your standard fizzy-yellow-beers and it fits that segment well. However, it's not the most inexpensive nor is it the best tasting FYB that I've had. So even if I wanted an FYB, I would not choose this one."
"T- Ugh. I want to like this because I like Jimmy Buffett but this is not a beer, it's bitter flavored water. No better than any American Macro, and I would take Bud, Coors or Miller over this."
"Cheers!"
"Enjoyed a few at suggestion of fellow golfer after a round. Pours a clear light golden with littl head. Just not much to this beer, thin body, not much taste. Refreshing on a warm/hot day. A bit too carbonated for my taste. No malt or hop flavor comes through at all. Just a bland offering - I'll pass."
"easy drinker... not a flavorful cat... good mass quantity brew."
"Poured a light yellow color with good carbonation and a small white head. Nose is rather balnd and weak but managed to smeel grains, malts. Taste is oretty much grains, adjuncts,little bit of light citrus and a weak hop, malt billet. Mouthfeel is light, tasteless but smoother better than most of this style. While this beer iss rated low I believe it is rated low in comparison to other craft beers. For the style, consideringts competition is much worse this beer is ok."
"Absolute swill. No way I'll ever get this crap again, even as a joke."
"Drinkability: I found this to be quite good. It is certainly one of the better Adjunct Lagers I've ever had and is well worth a try."
"D: Well, it's very light and has a low ABV, so that must be worth something. A friend and I both ordered this on a whim and reached similar conclusions. We thought that the beer was too light and lacking in flavor. And in my mind, the flavor that was there was severely lacking. Landshark isn't a terrible beer, per se. Just not a good one."
"Taste: No sign of skunkage, which is a surprise because my first two bottles were slightly skunked. Actually tastes better once it's had a chance to warm up a little bit. For an adjunct lager it's pretty okay(assuming theres no skunk)."
"this got an F ?"
"Jimmy Buffet beer, now football, interesting."
"Drinkability: Decent Lager total absence of hops or malt"
"Overall, it is a very drinkable lager - not a lot to taste, but refreshing. It is very similar to a Corona, but better and no need for fruit, and substantially better than Bud Light Lime or Miller Chill. I would much prefer one of these over an average American light lager. Good beer for a hot summer day, bbq, etc."
"Pours a very clear yellow color with the carbonation visible through the glass. The smell is very mediocre. Not much there the smell is of some barely but that's about it. The taste overall is barley with some sweetness to it. The taste is like a much sweeter corona. The mouthfeel is good, nothing to harsh, pretty tame. The drinkability is high there is nothing to stop you from having a lot of these, but the overall taste is very average."
"Off tap at Alexander's in the Lincoln Inn this beer was a clear, pale gold color. The one finger of off-white head started as a puffy cap but the retention was only ok. The lacing was consistent and sticky, good for the beer. The aroma was light and rather neutral, macro grains, a shadow of pale malt and a touch of lemony citrus. The flavors were acidic and a little tart. Pale malt, macro grains, light lemony citrus hops and a little doughy malt on the finish. Nothing distinct and clearly designed to be a session beer. It was however, balanced and refreshing. Better than Budweiser, Corona etc. and a great choice for those who enjoy such beers, especially as a summer selection. The mouthfeel was good but a little oily, probably reflective of the lemony hops that gave it more character than comparables. The body was medium and the carbonation good."
"Overall a decent and refreshing lager. A suprising amount of body."
"Appearance is a light golden yellow with a thin head and lace. Smell has not much going on, maybe light grain. Taste is very light and again not much going on, but refreshing. mouthfeel is light with crisp carbonation. A good beer on a hot summer day."
"-Paulo"
"Poured from a clear bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale gold color with a 1/2 inch head. Hardly much aroma to speak of. Taste is crisp and refreshing although not very flavorfull. Feels watery in the mouth. Highly drinkable, especially in warm weather. Overall a pretty average effort here."
"D: An entirely unassuming, unoriginal beer."
"Verdict: While it's hardly a surprise that Landshark is not a good beer, it's certainly no worse that your standard macro Lager. Call it ""Corona With A Shark On It."""
"I guess this is the ""blue collar"" Corona?!"
"I have to agree that this beer is much better than I anticipated. If you are looking for a ""summer beer"" and are tired of Corona then this is your beer. I liken it to a Corona with no need for fruit and tastes better. The taste will never overwhelm you but will do the job at a party."
"This was an extremely average beer. There was nothing remarkable about the taste and character of the beer except for the price. You could get many fine premium beers in the same price range or less. The taste reminded me of corona or corona light. AS far as the appearence of landshark, I did like the bottle on how comfortable it felt in my hand. Other then that it was average."
"I don't think this beer is as bad as people are saying. I actually like this WAY better than Corona. I know people call it a cheap Corona but I am going to beg to differ. It goes well with meals, I am not sure how it is if it's drunk a lone. Some beers are best with food and this is one of them."
"I have had this at weddings and various dive bars in the past, but just getting around to reviewing it right now, would rather drink this than some of the other light macro beers out there, other than that not very good"
"bonus points awarded for being a parrothead. not bad, buffet."
"d - could drink this all day long, great beer for a day on the boat, mowing the lawn or some other summer activity"
"This beer pours a clear light golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of foam. The aroma has a faint corny sweetness to it. It would be a nice aroma for an adjunct lager if it were a little less faint. The taste is has the same corny sweetness as the aroma with the addition of a prevalent metallic tinge. The mouthfeel is light bodied with way too much carbonation. Annoyingly high carbonation. Overall, this isn't the worst adjunct lager I've ever had, but it isn't one of the better ones either."
"Tried one due to a billboard covering an entire building coming out of the Miami airport. Should have known better. Fizzy water. Marketed by Jimmy Buffet. Again, should have known better. Would have given it all 1's save for a 1.5 for drinkability. If you're really thirsty and there's nothing else available anywhere, then I'd drink this. But only then."
"Pours a clear, pale yellow color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and poor lacing. Smells of adjunct and not a lot of anything else. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of adjunct up front, some yeast cleanliness, but overall not a strong adjunct aftertaste - which is the best thing I have to say about this brew."
"D: didn't taste like beer, nothing horrendous to stop you, so could have plenty without trouble, just wouldn't really want to..."
"I could drink these somewhere warm and sunny. Barbeque? Beach? Lawnmower? Definitely at a Jimmy Buffet concert!"
"All that said, it ranks up there with the ordinary beers that try to become quirky and appeal to a certain crowd. I would drink again, but probably not go out of my to find at home in Minnesota."
"A good beer for a hot day. This is a beer tailor-made for the weather in Florida. When it's really too hot to have a porter or anything heavy. This beer has a pretty good mouthfeel, is also easy drinking and going down easy."
"overall - If it was a choice between this and all the other adjunct macrobrews, I'd drink this. Good for when you're craving both beer and something to cool you off on a hot day. It's just not in the same league as craft brew."
"Taste is similar to Corona, light and fizzy, mostly malt, some citrus (most of which is probably from the lime wedge), fairly refreshing although it would be better suited on the beach than in the still cold months of Maine."
"Overall: I am a big fan of Jimmy Buffett and enjoy this beer - it's nothing overly special but a good crisp beer for warm weather"
"Final Thoughts - This beer wasn't terrible. I was surprised by the bad ratings this beer has gotten on this site. Its not a craft brew, but for the easy drinking refreshment it is, its very nice. Try it as an alternative to Corona- no lime needed!"
"It's not a bad beer by any means, but there's really nothing special or unique about it. I guess the worst thing about it is the company is owned by Jimmy Buffet - send that clown back to Margaritaville."
"It seems to me that this is just a ""make money"" by marketing beer. The real gem to this brew is the marketing, not the product."
"It appears that this beer strives to be put into the same vein as Corona, a light, simple, easy drinking beer made for the beach. If you buy this beer I would suggest putting a lime wedge in it. (don't listen to the beer snobs, it's okay to garnish a beer) It states on the bottle ""Island Style Lager"" so that is the style I'll hold it to and in doing so...it holds it's own very well."
"Drinkability is good and bad, make a nice flavored water, not so good for a beer though."
"I almost think that Landshark is getting a bad rap on here. It's really not that bad. The appearance is very average for a lager, and it has virtually no smell. But if you're really thirsty, it is a definite thirst quencher. It's like drinking a soft drink... very fizzy, and it doesn't have a wattery aftertaste. It also doesn't have a metallic taste to it. On a hot day after work or something this would be a really nice beer to come home to. You know, you hear people say they like a Corona with a squeeze of lime. Well you can drink this one really cold without the lime and it's still not too bad."
"If you like Bud, Miller etc. then you'll like this just fine"
"The main turn off on this is price around here...its almost as expensive as Corona, and I like to play on the beach and I have not been able to find this in cans (no glass allowed on the beach). Still, not bad however, and if presented the chance I would perhaps buy this again"
"2.5s all around... Because this is a below average beer. It's not horrible, it's just not very good. Yellowy-gold color with a thick soapbubble white head. Smells like earthy sweet corn with a touch of bitterness. Tastes as it smells. There's a a slight sweet malty essence to it. No hop presence to speak of. Thicker than a light beer and about the right consistancy for a lager, I suppose. It's really just like any Bud type mass produced beer anywhere. I put it in that grouping. Nothing special for a few dollars more."
"Don't drink and review."
"It is refreshing for a summer beer thirst. It is kind of a novelty beer to have at a back yard barbecue. Nothing more, nothing less. I would pick up a sixer of these again just for the hell of it."
"Even though this type of beer is not really my ""cup of tea"" It has it's place in the world. Every now and then you have a rare craving for a beer like this. It fits in on summer days, with a slice of lime and something made of beef grilling near by. Other than that, keep it in your fridge and serve it to friends who don't know much about beer."
"D- If you like cheap beer this is for you! I wont have another again. No flavor and and all water."
"12 oz clear bottle. Color is piss yellow. There was an unexpected white head that lingered longer than I anticipated. It has no smell, so the rating I gave it was an overstatement. There is not much taste going on, maybe some corn. The only good quality is the mouthfeel (lively carbonation) and the drinkability (easy going down)."
"(rated Mar 17, 2008)"
"Drinkability is low. Flavor is terrible, and I won't be finishing."
"A pee yellow pour with a soapy white head,no lacing. Aroma of corn,straw,and barn yard.Flavor is like corn and cardboard,thin body,funky mouthfeel,leaves an odd aftertaste,cant pinpoint it but we'll call it unpleasent.A little fruit/lemon/lime would help this out,but I will never buy again"
"My father brought some of these home this afternoon. Clear bottle is an immediate turn off, I'm preparing myself for massive skunkitude. Skunky smell, weak watery taste. Most light beers look watery, but this looks especially watery in a way that I can't quite put my finger on. The only thing I can really say about this beer is that it's like Corona but not quite as terrible. Which isn't much to say at all. Bad beer, pass on it unless it's free. I was actually mad that I dirtied a glass with this beer."
"Avoid."
"Thin and watery."
"Is another macro that is meant to be ""drinkable"" by the standard of you can drink a lot and not be filled."
"not something id ever buy but it wasnt totally a waste of time."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight hops, with some spice. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop/citrus. Light body. Not drinkable, this is a dissappointment all the way around."
"Would only drink if I was eating spicy food or having a tropical themed party."
"I will never buy this beer. Fortunately the one I tried, I didn't purchase, it was something left over in my parent's refrigerator. It tries to be like Corona and succeeds at being nasty just like Corona. One of only a few beers that I've actually dumped out."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It looks like yellow water with a white head. I held a paper up on the other side and was able to read it. This beer is very sweet smelling, nothing I can put my finger on, just sweet. The beer is thin and sweet. Not a whole lot of flavor going on, no bitterness. Because the beer is so thin it is easily drinkable. I woud not buy this beer, ($7 a 6 pack). If you like this style there are better examples at cheaper prices. The only reason I am drinking it is it was left at my house by a friend."
"D: This may be okay with spicy food like wings but otherwise not something I would go back to."
"The taste is similar, light, sweet grain and sweet, faintly musty, apple juice, with a grain-corn aftertaste. It has essentially no bitterness - just the barest trace is noticeable. It's soft and pleasant, easy to drink but a bit too sweet and one-dimensional."
"D - as long as Jimmy Buffet is played, there will be a Landshark beer drinker. I'd rather pay the premium for water, myself."
"It's Corona in another bottle.. there's really zero taste difference, plus it's usually a dollar or 2 more than Corona per 12 pack.. which is already pretty pricey! Good if you're on a beach on a hot day but other than that it's pretty bad. Why do people drink stuff like this.."
"I guess you could pound a ton of these if you just wanted to get trashed."
"Pours the color of melted yellow snow with a white foamy head. Nose is non-existent. Nothing but water. Flavor is more of the same but with some carbonation texture. Really nothing remotely interesting about this beer. I enjoy a cold PBR or Coors Light or Busch Light once in a while but would not drink this beer again."
"This lager is NOT like Corona. It is far better but not at all worth 7 something a six pack. its tho only reason it gets bad reviews. Not worth it."
"I don't like to put bad reviews out there...but come on, this was horrible. I don't even know why I bought it this when there was Sierra Nevada Pale Ale right next to it. Anyways, I was told that this was the bomb and that it tasted like a refined Corona. Instead of ice cold mexican p***, it was a refined American ice cold p***. Poured flat. Smelled like a honky tonk men's bathroom. Tasted...the same. M/D kinda made me want to gag. Don't buy one or six... don't drink one... and definitely pass on this next great beer. Again, I don't like to give bad reviews but sometimes I have to give credit where credit is not."
"Not much going on here, but what would you expect from a Bud Light looking beer in a clear bottle? Too bad I wasted one of my mixer sixer slots."
"HV"
"Did pour with a decent head and some lace. Aroma? umm guess it didn't smell bad. Pale yellow in color. A very, very mild flavor. Beer. Had some body. Hint of bittersweet. Not much to balance. Carbonation is ok for the style. That's about it. Kind of a yawner."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a light-medium yellow (pee) with a very small off-white/yellowish head. Smelled like sweat, straw/hay and lime. Very thin body with a watered down corn flavor. Finished a bit salty. Not good, I'm not really sure how people can drink this."
"Wouldn't keep it on hand."
"For an American macro. Appearance clear golden color with two finger white head that settled and left a little lace. Smell clean and sweet malt. Taste sweet malt just a bit of hops to balance and very little adjunents. Mouthfeel light in body mediem carbonation. Drinkability good out of the bottle better out of the glass great for summer and good example of its style."
"Had a nice cold bottle of this with a little lime wedge in it. In comparing it to Corona it really felt a lot smoother and the taste was very unoffensive, unlike Corona. It had a sweet maltiness to it and went down pretty easy. When looking for a real light beer to enjoy, this isn't a bad choice."
"The drinkability is ok for a hot day on the beach, but not a well crafted brew for basic brew enjoyment. MK"
"As stated above, it is overrated, overhyped and I wouldn't give one to my worst enemy. Maybe with a lime it would be descent, but the venue I had it at inexplicably didn't have any."
"Overall, certainly drinkable and sessionable, but there are many better macro lagers to try. This one just doesn't have much character."
"Overall: Well, I put quite a few of these down tonight. It is drinkable. Would I seek it out, Hell No. But I would not turn one down if offered for free."
"I shall never purchase this swill again."
"Pours a very pale straw yellow color. Nice big carbonation bubbles, no head or lacing on the glass. Aroma is typical of a lager, even slightly pleasing - summer nights in the backyard, summer days on a boat. Taste is strange. Not crisp. Kinda overly sweet and cloying for a pale lager. I wish this could be more refreshing... Mouthfeel is decent. Nice carbonation. Drinkability is low due to the taste."
"D: Drinks like a macro lager, but with a bit more taste. Went down all right, and a decent summer beer. But, like a Corona, you might need a lime to spice this one up."
"Drinkability- I would like to call it a party beer but it really isn't for the price. It is an alright hot day beer though"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Definitely high marks for mouthfeel, as its carbonation is completely restrained yet purposeful. It remains good throughout the time in the mouth, and the swallow is easy. This would not suck as a thirst quencher come a hot day behind a mower."
"Bottle pours a clear and sparkling, pale yellow body that is topped by a minuscle vanilla head. Aroma is stunted, with light notes of corn and a weak suggestion of vague hops. Light body is watery and heavily carbonated. Taste is unremarkable. Some adjunct sweetness and a balancing bitterness that is remotely suggestive of spicy hops. Nothing offensive here but as for an island lager give me a fresh Carib and some conch fritters."
"I drank all of these out of the bottle. They all looked clear, light golden. Smell was corn--comparable to a Corona. Tasted decent, light and pretty refreshing. Left a bit of a nasty aftertaste and left my mouth feeling a bit like it had sand in it. Not something I would buy on purpose. Actually almost made me wish there was a sixer of Bud Light in the fridge. I guess at least I didn't ""waste"" my good beer...."
"(This review was done outdoors on a warm summer day listening to ""Margaritaville"".)"
"Drinkable and better than I expected. But overpriced at $8.79 a six pack."
"Very as much as expected."
"Like I said good for a hot day."
"D-For me personally the drinkability is not high because of the flavor. But objectively, looking at this beer from the perspective of an individual who enjoys this type of summer lager, the drinkability is at least average given the carbonation and relatively low alcohol content."
"(Oh, wifey got this when she went to the store for some Wit type beers. Man, my work is still cut out for me)."
"Landshark is easily drinkable if you can find any reason to do so."
"For what it is. I say it's pretty average."
"Worth a try when you don't want to waste your ""good"" beers trying to quench your thirst."
"Thin, watery and crisp."
"I'm no fan of generic tasting lagers. However, I believe this beer does have its place. This week I moved into a new home. It was super hot out and we were all working vary hard. I had some Bell's Pale Ale on hand, and my father brought some Landshark. Given the fact that we were rather dehydrated, the Pale Ale was certainly not the type of beer we wanted to be drinking due to its lack of thirst quenching capabilities. The Landshark on the other hand hit the spot. It has low alcohol content, thus causing less dehydration, and little flavor to speak of making it more refreshing, like water. I wouldn't suggest sampling this brew, as you would an Imperial Stout for instance; nor would I bother to pour it into a glass. But, if you're looking for something out of the ordinary, but still want it to taste ordinary and refresh on a really hot summer day, this is your beer."
"D- I might have one tomorrow after mowing the lawn, or perhaps during the lawn mowing."
"Overall: Not offensive to the taste buds, but an extremely dull and boring beer. No thanks."
"Decent brew, not great but better than lots of other macros."
"Pours a clean yellow/ gold-ish color with a white head. A small skunk like aroma, with a hint of saaz hops. In the taste, small sweetness, small maltiness, yet quite bland. A smooth and light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dryness yet clean aftertaste. Not worth it, macro lager done quite bad."
"D - If you're wasting away in Margaritaville, keep looking for your lost shaker of salt and pass up this dreck."
"Very drinkable, but you have to ask yourself if you are really willing to spend $30 for a case when you could get so many better brews for that price. In my opinion it isn't worth it, skip this beer."
"Drinkability: It would be decent if the taste and aroma weren't so horrible and skunky. Could be from the clear bottle."
"D: Not too bad. Would be good on a hot day. And yes with lime, forgive me beer purists that think that is blasphemy, I really like the flavor of lime and salt with beer and this beer goes well with lime and salt. amen."
"I could see myself grabbing this over BMC if it was my only choice."
"I guess it's drinkable but....why?"
"Drinkability was really not worth it. I had the one with dinner a while back and it's the only one I've had to date. Definitely not worth the money."
"O- slightly below average on the overall beer scale. Not complete swill though. If this was your only option it wouldn't be so bad...as long as it is 90 degrees outside and Jimmy Buffet is buying it for you."
"If it was 20% less in price I might have given it a break or two in the ratings."
"D: Dont think I will be trying this again."
"Not bad at all, Overall this one is fairly plain and average, I wish it was a little more full bodied, this one could have been a little more enjoyable for the price that I paid for it. Overall I would not turn this beer down if someone offered it to me for free."
"D - why?"
"I would put this a step above Corona. As an American style lager I would rate this one better than many. A good session beer."
"Drinkability: I disagree with all the ""beer snobs"" that slammed this beer. It's truly refreshing and went great with my take home meal from Taco Bell. This is a great summertime or session beer. This is a beer that can go head to head with Mexico's Corona Extra (which I like in the summertime)."
"This beer was $3 at an amusement park, served in a plastic cup. It looked extremely clear, yellow as corn, very thin head. The smell was a little like sweet corn and maybe a little malt. The taste was not bad at all for the style, but definitely corn came out as the predominant note again. Easy to drink, but I chose to have only one. Not interesting enough to try again."
"Overall pretty boring in general. One thing I will give it, is that it is relatively clean. Aside from just a hint corn on the flavor, it is a step up from your standard Corona. Either way, at $8.49 for a six pack, I won't be buying it again anytime soon."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured very light yellow, medium head. I can sum this up with one sentence: smelled, tasted, and felt like a generic lager. Nothing interesting in the least. It's not terrible, but there's just no reason to run out and get it...not a ""gotta have"" beer."
"D= RUN the other way. If you're really really thirsty, it's a very hot summer day and you have no true love or knowledge of good beer, you'd probably sorta think it was okay."
"Was advertised in local watering hole as a Corona like beer. The taste is a lot thinner with no real aftertaste. They served with lime (I hate that)but ordered a second without. Seems trendy without much substance. Sweet flavor without much to it. Priced higher than much better beers. Watchout for Landshark."
"D: Easy drinker, nothing really notable just an ordinary over-priced macro-lager."
"Bought a 6 pack at the local market- ( limited beer selection there...) Initial appearance is good, packaging catchy, eye appealing- 1st taste set the tone ... very strong yeasty taste( think labat blue aftertaste- very similar) strong notes of corn, light head disapears quickly, little , if any leftover lacing present. same price as Corona- there is better beer value out there in a lager!!! at 7.99, (a bit pricey for a domestic macrobrew )i'd head to the SteinLager, or for a few pennies more, Catch the Carlsberg Train !!!"
"This beer is a good summer time, outdoor beer. It is not great, it isn't bad, it is very drinakable. Good pool party/beach beer."
"D: Actually not to bad of a drink. Would chose this clearly over any of the other macro-light lagers. A perfect beer for the tropical beaches or islands and very cleanly brewed. A ok try for the skeptics."
"Swill."
"Nothing offensive about it other than the complete lack of flavor and origiinality. I can't beleive that people just seem to buy anything that Buffett sells. Thats why I like to call this beer its more appropriate name, Landsheep."
"Just your average American macro disguised as a micro. It seemed to me like a mixture between Bud Light and Corona. It doesn't have the skunkiness of Corona though. I wouldn't recommend it but it could be a decent beer on a hot summer afternoon after working in the yard. It goes down pretty easily so you could enjoy several without thinking of it. Not going to go into a complex review. It is what it is. Considering it's Jimmy Buffet's signature brew from Anheuser-Busch, I didn't expect much and I didn't get much."
"Good beer to sip in the sun outdoors in the summer. Similar to a Corona- but better. Drawback is the price $7.49 for a 6 pack here. The bottles are HUGE - tall and heavy. It really made by Miller but under the code name Margaritaville Brewing. So you are paying micro price for a macro beer."
"As one friend put it, this is beach beer, nothing more. There's a just a mild, pale grain taste with a touch of veggies. It's not terribly tasty, but it's also mostly inoffensive and would probably go well with a slice of citrus. The aroma is mostly bready and that carries over into the flavor as well. I wouldn't have this beer by choice, but when given a free bottle (such is the case now) I don't mind washing down some food with it."
"D- absolutely one of the worst beers I have had. I really can't describe the horrid shuddering aftertaste mine had. I hope that this was just a weird bottle and they wouldn't vend something like this. NOT recommended in any way"
"The price tag is too high for what this is but if you're an American macro lager drinker you'll probably like it."
"I really enjoyed the Landshark Lager . I had this at a hockey game I went to this winter great replacement for the normal macro brews normally quaffed at sporting events . Great drinkability . It was a step above the normal American Lagers but a step below the craft beers I have tried recently . Overall great summer beer good drinkability can see myself enjoying this with some BBQ this summer."
"White 2 finger head that doesn't stick around, straw pale yellow in color. Highly carbonated and very faint on any real flavor. Smooth mouth feel and over all refreshing."
"D- Very drinkable because there is no reason to linger with it. This beer is not horrible but there is much better out there."
"This beer is kind of like a Corona knock off, except this one is smoother and tastes a bit better than Corona. Pours a golden yellow with a short and fluffy white head that has some lacing down the glass. The aroma is of light malts and light hops, but it is very faint. At least it doesn't smell skunky like Corona. It tastes of a very minimal amount of malt and hops, not really much going on. It has a very crisp but pale mouthfeel and it is highly drinkable because it is alot like water. Though this is not the best American Macro Lager, it isn't the worst and it sure does beat Corona as a beer so this is also a plus."
"I had this beer at a trade show, and the color did put me off because it look somewhat artificial. It had a nice amount of carbonation and a mild flavor. It was more a ""fun"" drinking beer than a beer to savor but it was decent. It did not leave an after taste like a lot of lagers do."
"Another beer for people who don't like the taste of beer. Is this stuff actually beer? I don't taste anything. Seriously, this stuff makes Corona seem robust. There's not much that can be said in the way of a review. Someone told me that it's popular to add a shot of tequila to this and it's called a ""Loaded Landshark."" I don't know why you'd want to water down your tequila. I say just throw back the shot like a man and leave this stuff where it sits."
"Mouthfeel is just like the above. Very light and drinkable with very little carbonation. The thing this beer is good for is for those who don't like the taste of beer, twenty-something females perhaps."
""
"Typical gold colored beer for a macro lager.Aroma and taste are vegetables.This is another beer that I say that beer snobs are going to snub just because it's a macro.No it's not gonna win any prissy awards and no one is gonna talk about it's complexity,but it is what it is: fresh,smooth and a solid lager....I think I'll have another one!!"
"Drinkability - one and done. Nothing terrible, just terribly uninteresting."
"D- ok D, but it's just another slightly tweaked version of natural light."
"D - Not to big on anything in a clear bottle. Not too complex and I does not make up for it in flavor either. Probably would not have again."
"D - Maybe on a Slow Boat to China, or on the sides of a tropical Volcano, or even at a Jimmy Buffet concert this beer would be drinkable. But alone,not so much"
"It had the usual macro lager straw coloring, with very little head and lacing, but a lot of carbonation. Even for a macro, it had almost no aroma, just a very, very light bit of maltiness. Not a horrible taste, but there was a limey feeling to it, which took away from the beer. Went down fine. Not bad as far as macro lagers go; which means it's not that great if you like micro brews."
"Had this while traveling on business. Yellowish beer with whitish head that fizzled quickly. Smelled of very little. NOt much aroma to upgrade or downgrade score. Taste was kind of the same way. It was very cold at first and while cold I thought a cleaner flavor than the usual American Macro. Not much hop bitterness to speak of. But while it warmed it started to have a sulphur aroma and some flavors I did not like. Mouthfeel was fizzy and thin. I added about half a lime when my Shrimp Po Boy showed up and it improved the taste dramatically, but my ratings are without the lime. Overall not a good effort."
"Overall, this is an overpriced, nasty tasting lager. I'd take a Stroh's, PBR, High Life and yes, a Bud 100x over over this beer."
"Verdict: Better than Corona at least. Smooth and simple. If you're looking for a cheap, mediocre lager, this isn't a bad choice."
"The taste is the same - mild corn, very light sweet malt, no really detectable hops. Very thin, watery, basically an American version of Corona, and would probably benefit likewise by a touch of lime. If you are a Corona fan, this is for you. Otherwise, possibly drinkable if you are very hot and it is ice cold, finishes a bit sour if you let it warm up, so get it down quick, better yet, try something else."
"I am glad I just wasted money on one bottle instead of falling for their marketing design and getting a six pack."
"Pale. straw, some white head that persists. There might be a slight tartness to the taste, but I get ZERO hop and ZERO malt. Sure, you could put a lime in it if you go that way, and you could quench your thirst on a hot summer day. But it is not worth its own hype."
"Drinkability- If it was 100+ degrees and this was the last beer on earth, I would probably politely decline. I think jimmy needs to go back to the drawing board."
"My my my, if it aint a Budweiser tryin to be a Corona, and you know what? It's spot on! Yeah! Yellow color with a soapy thin white head. Aroma of corn/ cereal grain. Flavors of the same and that aching plea to add a lime for all the wrong reasons. You could put this in a can and I would pound it hard after some grilled hot dogs on the fourth of July. This could also be a Tecate or Modello with my eyes closed, but I'll just stick to HONEST SWILL instead."
"For those who care (all two of you), A-B, in the form of Landshark Lager, is now the official sponsor of Jimmy Buffett's concert tours, rather than Grupo Modelo, in the form of Corona Extra. Rather than brew another adjunct-riddled lager and put it in clear glass bottles with similarly colored graphics, why couldn't they have come up with something different and worthwhile? Yeah, I already know the answer. I just thought I'd throw it out there."
"Landshark is not a craft beer by any stretch. I don't appreciate the hefty price tag. There's hardly any malt or hops in it. It is all hype. Increase the alcohol and decrease the price and you'd have Mickey's. What a rip."
"All this together, though, makes for a beer that is drinkable, if you enjoy something like Corona. But frankly, I'd rather be hitting the Miller Lite than this. And if you're really looking for an ""island"" beer, get a Red Stripe. This is a bad example of a not-very-good style of beer."
"Fails even as a Corona knock-off... save the ""premium"" diffence and lime a Miller Lite instead. Landshark is a fish out of water."
"Heavy carbonation stings tongue. Bleah."
"Bottom line, I'd be happier right now if I had 4 Budweisers in the fridge rather than the four remaining Landshark Lagers I actually have. I'll drink them, because they are beer, but I won't be revisiting Landshark Lagerville."
"Probably better than Corona. Certainly nice drinking on a hot day with limes. But those fantastic grouper sandwiches and conch fritters would have been better complemented by a real lager or pilsener or many another real beer..."
"I bought this beer on a whim from a gas station convenience store simply out of necessity and because I don't usually buy beer from this type of location due to the poor selection (bud, bud light, miller, miller light, schwill beer, etc). I ignored the fact that the color looked almost artificial, more yellow than Corona (blech). The first thing that came to mind upon smelling is, skunk. Seriously. I was shocked when I realized this 6 pack was $8.49. Definitely not worth the price. I'm not sure what the brewer was going for, but whatever it was, I'd chalk this up as a failure, unless the goal was to produce a nearly undrinkable beer. I managed to get through the six pack mostly because I hate to waste money even if it's on crappy beer, but had I know going into it that this beer was that bad I would've bought Miller Lite. I see some reviewers calling this a summer beer, man, Labatt's Blue is more of a summer beer than this ever could be."
"Pours a light golden,with a thin white head. Not much retention,but lots of lacing,and lots of bubbles. Aroma is of sweet grains. Body is thin,crisp,and carbonated. Taste is sweet and refreshing,with some hints of fruit. I will remember this one for the summer."
"D - Pretty damn good actually, this could be a good beach beer if you kept it in a coozie, as the clear bottles frighten me. Not a bad rendition of a macro, even if it is overpriced. Worth a try I suppose, but as for me, I'll probably revisit this summer."
"Way overpriced, but then again did anyone expect the business group owned by a mediocre musician to turn out anything other than a mediocre beach beer? Honestly, I have no idea if Jimmy Buffet had anything to do with this beer other than receive a check for the brewery's name, but still. Has a better appearance than Corona, and that is clearly the market they're going for, as it is a darker hue of gold and not quasi-invisible. The smell is watery and grainy, go figure, and the taste is a tad like lime and just like Corona for the most part. Very smooth and watery, someone could swill these back and not get buzzed. But if you're at a bar and the best value for your buck is a bucket of these or something, you're in the wrong place."
"As with many Macro Lagers. Of very little redeeming quality."
"Just another beer using marketing instead of quality to sell."
"Notes: Couldn't reccomend this to anyone even after a hard days work."
"Ok, again, not normally fond of reviewing macro's but I'm bored and have some left over from a gathering. Pours clear, yellow and fizzy, nice head that lasts for 2.3 seconds and no retention. Smell is of some grain, maybe a hint of lemon but not much. Taste is ok for the style, ""ok for the style"" being the key. Malt, grain, not much else, somewhat typical of a macro. High carbonation and a light moutfeel. I would say this is better than Corona but still, not worth your money."
"Clear, light yellow lager with a small, creamy, white head. Decent retention. Subtle aromas of cereal grains, lemon and peppery hops. The flavor is of club soda with a sweet tint. Light to medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish."
"(d) The rough carbonation and then progressive watery taste kinda put me of this beer. Reminded me slightly of Corona, but w/o the sweetness."
"I tried initially to put out of my mind that it is an A-B product. Then I did my best to forego the Jimmy Buffet connections, of whom I am no fan, especially. And so, I can say, confidently, that this beer is not worthwhile, solely on its own merits, or lack thereof. The low drinkability is chiefly a personal issue, as many A-B products wreak havoc with my digestive tract. And this one is no exception. So now I have one fewer reason to visit Margaritaville. Which I think puts them into negative numbers."
"Drinkability/notes: Despite some shortcomings, notably the rough carbonation, a drinkable example of the style, better than the examples produced by the macro brewers."
"Pours a clear yellow/golden color with big, fizzy, white head. Not much aroma to speak of, but what there was smelled a bit of corn. Taste is similar to that of Corona, but maybe actually weaker. Carbonation level is high. Not impressed. Then I found out it was an Anheuser-Busch product and IÂ’m not surprised I didnt like it."
"Drinkability: It doesn't get more boring than this."
" The flavor is a bit surprising considering the nose was nothing to write home about. The malt is much more sweeter and smooththan I had suspected, it's like a cream 'o corn style malt and surprisingly clean with a mild lemmon/citrus edge that smooths out and becomes wheaty and very herbal. Finishes sweet and earthy without the dreaded metallic-sour aftertaste many of the macro lagers can deliver. A light body for sure and a bit thin and way to fizzy. The overall quality is a bit higher than i imagined and is a big step up from corona i think. not a bad brew to pass out on poker night."
"Overall Impression: A mineral water quality might be due to the high carbonation level. As a gimmick beer, itÂ’s not too bad, but itÂ’s just a gimmick beer."
"Pours typical industrial beer yeelow, with white head. Nothing really stands out, a little malt, very little hint of hops, and some malt & corn flavors. Not a bad brew, but not really my style. I can, however, see myself putting a few of these down as a lawn beer."
"Picked this up on a whim this afternoon and I wasn't very impressed. Nothing really set this apart from other Lagers except for the price. ($8.50 for a 6 pack) Comes in a clear bottle which is obviously a chance for disaster. Will not be trying this again."
"Drinkability- Really just tastes like they bottled Corona in a different bottle. Not much different."
"D - This is a step above typical beach party clear golden lagers, but it's really nothing special. I would gladly drink a few of these Corona killers on a scorching day at the beach, but I probably wouldn't buy this intentionally. This sample was kindly provided to me by the husband of a lady that I work with...I have a reputation at work as ""the beer guy," and he graciously sent one of these to work with his wife for me to try (at home of course)."
"Taste: Pretty refreshing, and a step above Corona. Still slightly weak, but the lemon flavor adds at least something to the brew. Would go well on the beach, which is what it's designed to do. I could put away a whole case of these... easily."
"If nothing else, I'll buy it to avoid the Big 3."
"Pretty solid beer. Not much different from a Budweiser, in all honesty. Pours a piss yellow with a foamy, off-white head. Not much lacing on the glass. Taste is refreshing with a pretty perfect amount of carbonation, and citrus overtones. A dry finish to which I could detect a little banana. This is a very good beer to have poolside on a hot summer day. Not something that will bowl anyone over, but it serves its purpose."
"Drinkability- One of the most drinkable and refreshing beers Ive ever had the pleasure to sample."
"This beer reminded me of Corona brewed in FL, nothing more. A ""yard"" beer and not much more. I could, and did, drink this while doing work outside in the heat and humidity."
"D - A okay brew. It would work fine as a session or landmower beer."
"Can't say that I didn't see this comming. A local offering to Central KY, I figured it was worth a try. Pours a standard Lager straw color with sparkling clarity, high carbonation, and a bleach-white head retention that falls somewhere between fizzy and frothy. Smells light, but sweetly of part-malt / part-adjuct, giving a moderate grain and vegetable aroma. Flavors closely mimic the aromas with a grain / malt combo. Corn flavors are quite pronounced, along with a buttery note that can't be overlooked. Body is quite firm, but riddled with adjuct sweetness and oily. Finishes quite clean with the same vegetable flavor that never disipated. Probably more comparable to Budweiser than Corona, but more problematic. Unless it's free, I'll likely pass this one up in future sessions."
"Notes: You have to give some credit to this beer for being brewed to the restaurant. FOr a big chains rest. with their own beer,nice."
"Disappears pretty quickly. Seemingly somewhat refreshing in the heat. Not terrible for the style - had worse...Not worth craft beer price. Gimmicky. Okay for style (though not the best there either - soapiness is a bit annoying.)"
"If Buffet has anything to do with this beer, at least this beach brew don't come with the lemon/lime already added...like some of late.."
"I didn't like it too much."
" This would go great with one of the burgers at his ""Cheesburger in Paradise"" restaurants. It won't distract from the margaritaville songs that'll be played, and the sourdough on the burgers has a similar taste to it than the back of this beer. As much as I hate to say this, this is not the brew that I'd want to be wasting away to while in margaritaville. Parrotheads, you've been warned!"
"Drank straight from the bottle one hot North Carolina evening after work. My Partner-In-Tasting (PIT) said that it reminded her of Budweiser, only with a little more flavor. Wow! That is really depressing! It looks and feels very much like Corona to me: it's light and refreshing, with little discernable flavor and a white, foamy head. The finish is at least yeasty, giving it a small bit of bread flavor. Nothing much to say; I suppose it's representative of its style."
"Drank straight from bottle. Color is yellowy (almost like when its expelled) with a little foam lacing around the bottle. Smelled yeasty, kinda like white bread. Doesn't have much flavor. Slightly bitter, left white rice flavors in the mouth. Felt ok in the mouth. Not too thin. Tasted better slightly warm than cold, didn't hit the spot, so not really drinkable."
"Overall impession: Tastes quite a bit like Corona, but without the usual skunk. Not great, but it serves its purpose well."
"Typical macro lager with a twist. They must have added liquid detergent at the time of bottling instead of lime juice. After three drinks, all I could comment to my friends is ""soap"". I should end this review here, but I will go on. I should back up, actually... the appearance and smell are pretty much exactly what you expect from a light lager. The interesting thing is that the body did not feel light.... actually pretty full. After getting a few more drinks down, I had build a tolerance up to the soap flavor.... and in conclusion, I wil say this is MORE drinkable than any other mass brewed light lager I have tried, but one I will not partake of again."
"Pours a five finger fizzy white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear pale yellow/green color. Low carbonation and light-medium bodied. Stale water nose. Flavor is sweet corn with hops in background. Not very beer like, good lawn mower beer. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"I remember hearing a David Allen Coe song making fun of Jimmy Buffett (""Jimmy Buffett Doesn't Live in Key West Anymore"") - I'm wondering if he could make a better beer."
"I should have known I was in trouble when the bartender kind of chuckled as I ordered this, and immediately asked ""Lime?"". I turned it down, and wish I hadn't. It would've helped. There was nothing beyond corn, otherwise. Not that I put lime in my corn, mind you but hell, anything would've improved this. I was so, so disappointed. I wasn't expecting the world from a light lager, but come on. Seriously? Libby's should sue. I'd not recommend this to anyone."
"M&D - smooth and drinkable, easy down, i bet in margaritaville it sells pretty good. i could see drinking this on a hot day beneath a palm tree on the beach in the Keys, like those corona commercials, of course i would rather drink nearly anything else, like water"
"I've heard this compared to Corona. So I went into the taste test expecting to reach for a lime. What I found, however, was something much more. Nothing to look at in the glass, except for longer head retention than I expected. Nice, clear, golden color with bubbles streaming up the sides of the glass. Not much in the nose except a hint of... not skunk or hops but malt. Surprisingly full (moderately full anyway) mouthfeel with pleasant carbonation and some foam on the lip. Fairly decent bready malt flavor with not much bitterness to speak of. Thankfully nothing like Corona. And while nothing to write home about in the complexity department, I enjoyed the rich simplicity of the taste and the buttery slickness of the malt. I'd definitely buy this again--especially for a BBQ party on the deck. And yes, I may try a lime. The bottle, after all, has a nice Corona-style neck that would work very well for that. Really worth trying. I hope it catches on. A nice craft-brewed alternative to Corona would be welcome when out on the town."
"I poured this overpriced beer into a tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice beer color very light straw golden. The beer had a nice head with good lacing. A little bready tasting maybe but really nothing outatanding. It is a great hot weather beer. I will buy again."
"This just isn't my style, but I'd take it over BMC. Certainly not worth the craft beer price. Could have bought a Bell's Kalamazoo Stout for the same $1.65 instead, but I had to experiment."
"D: Has OK drinkability, good for a hot day, but the adjunct flavor turned me off a bit. Too expensive ($7.99 a six-pack) for what it is, but I probably wouldn't turn down a free one."
"Ordered one of these in Margaritaville in Myrtle Beach. Had to try something new after a too-weak margarita. Odorless like most beers in it's class. Carbonated and crisp taste, a little less bitter than a Corona or a Bud, but not much different. Drinkable with a lime, but not really worth the $8 for a 6-pack that I found the next day at the local grocery store. Buffett is the luckiest man on earth, being able to market his brand in so many ways, but he's obviously not too passionate about his beer."
"Overall, a beach beer. Bland, but easy enough to drink."
"Clear 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a straw yellow color with a white head. The aroma is a faint whiff of grain and nothing much in the are of hops. The taste is cheap macro lager that is borderline offensive. No thank you, I did not enjoy this one at all. It tastes like a cheap version of Budweiser. In fact, I kept inspecting the label to see any signs of it being an A-B product because it was so reminiscent of Budweiser. There is no indication on the label, but after logging onto BA it was confirmed that A-B does make this. Not recommended."
"Not very drinkable, just don't care for it."
"Overall, i dont know how much alcohol it has in it, but i find it tastes and feels like a light malt liquor. I dont think it has all that much alchohol in it, but it suprisingly fills my mouth up more than i would expect, or would want on a hot day on the beach."
"Great packaging: clear, embossed bottle (shark fin on the shoulder) with clear pressure sensitive labels and a retro looking design and color scheme. This is obviously designed to compete with Corona, but does it really need to? Regardless, it looks great in the glass as well. It's clear and golden with a finger of creamy bright white foam across the the top. The head holds fairly well and leaves some minor lacing about the glass. The aroma is sweetly malty with some grain and an adjunct side; and a suggestion of alcohol, and some grassy hops in the background. It tastes pretty much the same, and to be honest, it's not that different from Corona. Medium bodied... soft carbonation... I don't have one to try side by side, but the Landshark seems a little sweeter... it's just begging for a lime to cut through it and balance it out, and there's even a suggestion of lime flavor to it already, and I wonder if there's something added. For what it's intended to be, it hits the mark. And as to why it's what it's intended to be, well, that's all about the money."
"Pretty golden color with a surprisingly tenacious bright white head. Aromas of cooked grains, a bit of a sulphury, corny note, and the slightest hint of Saaz-ish hops (but it doesn't smell like Saaz). On the tongue, sweet and sulphur notes pop up first, followed by a long, unpleasant mid-section of cloying corn notes and a soapy finish. Mouthfeel is completely nondescript. Overall, this beer is kind of sucky. There's nothing good about it, but there are bad things. Not a good combo. I don't understand the point of making this beer -- why not just drink a Bud? Bud is better, which is scary."
"All in all I didn't find this to be a terrible beer. It looks about the same as your typical macro lager, very similar to a Corona in fact. Smell is minimal and nothing special. Taste was pretty good for a macro swill. Better than Corona in my mind because it was smoother and a little less skunky tasting. Mouthfeel was light and empty. Once you swallow it, the taste seems to exit quickly, leaving hardly anything on the tongue. Pretty good drinkability, though nothing I'd want to drink often. Very easy going down but other qualities of this beer keep it from getting a 4 in any respect. An almost average macro lager and better than most that I've tried."
"Drunk straight from the bottle, it presented a light yellow colour a la Corona Light. I was disappointed in the lack of flavour, the second half of the beer was decidedly bland. It had a thin taste and a disappointing lack of body; while not labeled as a light beer I can think of no other way to categorize it. Worked for drinking on the beach where I was, but don't expect much outside of that. It did keep my throat wet, which was what I was looking for at the time, so I guess it succeeded in that regard."
"Landshark Lager pours a pale yellow with a white head from a clear twelve ounce bottle. There is very little aroma, a slight note of corn is noticeable however. There is a slight corn flavor, but this beer is really quite watery. At least it's not skunky."
"I didn't realize this was a Bud product. The bottle gives no indication. What the bottle should say is we spent money on attractive graphics so don't expect much. I purchased this on vacation in Tampa and found it as close to undrinkable as anything I've ever had, a horrible blend of fizz andGod only knows what."
"Picked this up as something I saw that was new. Looked enticing. Bottle smell is very sweet and corny. Poured into a glass with a neon yellow color. Nice head. Taste is highly carbonated but without substance. Very bland. Steady hopped lager taste but nothing stands out at the start or finish. Thought this was a microbrew and was tricked even reading all over the package. Even for a macrobrew it is in my opinion substandard. I think i'll pawn the rest of the sixer off on my friends. Hopefully they remain my friends.I'll be steering clear of the landshark."
"Overall: Another pointless and boring macro lager."
"Been to Jimmy's restaurant, and the food there's pretty good. I really expected something better to go with it."
"I didn't expect much, and I didn't get a whole lot from this beer. Avoid unless you absolutely love Corona - put in a lime to hide some of the bad tastes and smells of this beer."
"Oh yeah, the beer..well, let's see.. Lifeless yellow ochre, big white head that instantly evaporates to a bubble; nasty, adjuncty nose with a touch of fresh citrus. Surprisingly decent lace. Taste has a bit of rice and that typical macro light beer flavor but it does go down pretty smooth. Definitely not recommended unless, like me, you are drawn to the allure of the packaging and moniker. Still, better than most mainstream macros, and it surpasses Corona for flavor and drinkability, so it's not totally terrible by any means."
"This just arrived in PCB. Like Corona down to the bottle & marketing. Lacks the bitterness that makes Corona a more slowly drinking beer (and pretty good warm). My novice girlfriend noticed no difference to most other beers I try. I agree with the previous review that, considering the obvious ""beachy"" appeal, this should have a citrus flavor- I add lime. A-B could have re-marketed Tequiza as this and I would have been pleasantly surprised. A good beer for a beach day or Florida BBQ, but at $7.00/6pack, little reason to not just get Corona. The Jacksonville edge gives it a little taste of the tropics, but it lacks the originality of the craft beer it is meant to be. Ultimately, it ranks with Red Stripe, Corona, and others as an obvious choice for Parrotheads and other beachgoers, but it is just that--- a summery MOOD beer."
"Overall it reminds me very much of Corona; maybe a bit better."
