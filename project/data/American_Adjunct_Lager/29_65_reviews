"I have to say that to me this is like the American Heineken (which is a good thing).  You can taste the rice in it, but this will probably end up being my go to home beer since it's so incredibly cheap and it has a very similar flavor profile to Heineken."
""
"Good beer, this is my go to brew"
"Obviously nothing special, but this is still one of the best brews that the Big Three put out."
""
"Overall: It doesn’t taste bad, but it is pretty boring."
"Perhaps one of my favorite big company beers almost like any other pale yellow beer except something is different in taste compared to the rest not bad for a day out on the lake not to over priced and is refreshing"
""
"Probably one of the better big domestic pilsner beers out there. If you can't get a good Canadian beer...a bud is your next best bet. The more you drink the better they get lol."
"An awful beer, almost tastes 'off'."
"way better than craft beer"
"Good beer if you're low on cash"
"Crisp and fresh taste.  Pineapple/apple aromas.  It is a refreshing beer."
"Pretty awful smell, nothing special in color, easy to drink"
""
""
"Not brewed the hard way. Two thumbs down"
""
""
"Classic lager.  Crisp, great on a hot day."
""
"If you're going to drink Budweiser, make sure it's in a cold, glass bottle. It's very pleasant and drinkable. It's a dang good beer and very underrated. Drinking it out of a can is a different story. There is always a weird metallic tatse that takes over and makes it tatse dirty."
""
"Awful smell starts within few minutes, but otherwise very enjoyable. Easy-to-drink beer that I can just drink while chilling; nothing special, but I would still buy it."
"This beer is apparently ""brewed the hard way", if by brewed the hard way you mean brewed with dirty socks and cat urine. Gross."
""
"Good beer for pairing with barbecue and spicy foods.  When consumed alone, there is a strange artificial taste that gets stronger with each beer.  Its popularity probably has more to do with the Budweiser brand than its quality, but overall a drinkable beer."
"great out of the bottle close to the born on date as u can get"
"It's got a little taste.  What can you say?  It goes down easy. Like the flavour."
"King of beers brah brah"
"Not bad for the style"
""
""
"Budweiser for me is a beer that is quite frankly overrated. This is a beer that lacks taste and has a light, watery flavor. Really boring beer to drink, and it ranks as one of the worst beers that I've had. Pabst Blue Ribbon has more flavor than this piss."
"It is exactly what it is, no more no less. Everyone's first beer."
""
"Not going to go into detail.  Exceptional for the style (underline: for the style), not many beers I would rather have if it's 90+ at the beach."
""
""
"Ok this is the first Bud I've had in 2 years. Perhaps I was feeling sentimental. But one taste did away with all sentiment. The smell is awful. And although the taste really isn't bad, It is rather flavor less. Good if you want to get a buzz, But if you want to taste beer forget about it! Oh well here's to younger days!"
""
"The only redeemable quality is that this beer is union made."
"Not my cup of tea. There is no 'taste'.  This beer is meant for people who don't like beer, but like the idea of beer. A bit better than the watery version."
"For what it is, it is well done. Not much on the nose, rice, faint hops, light malts. Brilliant straw color, fizzy and light bodied. Light malt and rice flavor with a light hop finish."
"King of Beers? I don't think so. Has a nice golden color with a think white head of bubbles. Taste was very disappointing. Very bland and tasteless. Smell was off setting. Gave me a headache. Cheap beer is cheap."
"A very tasty beer that is great for having a good time with your friends."
""
"Notting great notting too bad, but better than nothing."
"Overall - For what it's worth, this beer is great! It is very drinkable, cheap, and Budweiser has never let me down before."
""
""
"Pleasantly surprised with this one. I really don't like Bud Light but this isn't too bad."
"We've all had it. You either like or don't. I don't."
""
""
""
"Too carbonated and no taste"
"a terrible beer for the homeless."
"On a really hot day in the summer, this is a pretty satisfying beer. If you develop a taste for it you won't have to worry about a small town bar not having a beer you like. I must admit, however, a world with only Budweiser would be pretty tedious."
"Very bad hangover after drinking just a 6 pack"
"No pumpkin or peaches in this beer. As promised. Also, this tasted as though it was brewed the hard way."
""
"Budweiser is the ""King"" of giving American Beer a bad name"
""
""
"beer pong beer, thats about it."
""
""
""
"Good for beer pong and college kids"
""
"Horse urine. One of the worst beers ever created by man. I'd rather drink toilet water than touch this again."
""
"Served in a Pilsner glass"
"Good beer to throw around and play beer pong with. That's about it, little taste. Fuck that commercial"
""
"It is not so bad for a lager"
"Old standby Bud gets a bad rap in that it's a beer by the masses for the masses.  Not particularly strong or of unique character it's nevertheless a great ""backyard"" beer after mowing the lawn or coming in from a hard day's work.  No hoppiness and a pale pilsner taste that goes down easy.  Serving in a frosted mug improves the experience greatly and it's really refreshing with no aftertaste.  Give Bud a break.  It is what it is."
""
"Sorry, but I just love American style lagers and Budweiser is delicious"
""
""
"Garbage, simply garbage. Nobody should have to justify bashing this worthless beer."
""
"Rating this just to get an AAL in my ratings..."
"Ah, the King of Beers. My Bud is brewed in Canada by the good folks at Labatt, and I'm not sure it is any better or any worse than most mass-produced beer you can buy. It pours with a fizzy, quickly disappearing head. It has a corn and morning breath aroma, followed by a really sweet malt profile. There is no evidence of hops whatsoever. Best served ice cold and enjoyed before, during or after some sort of sporting event."
"Consistent bottle to bottle and can to can. Serve from a Keg or a Can in a glass its a commercial American Lager"
"Its a cheap beer that tastes like a cheap beer"
"Calling all beer drinkers to stop drinking this stuff. Too many great craft beers to savor and enjoy."
""
"O: not a style I would choose for myself, but for the style, it's well made;"
"Plus how can you go wrong with there radio commercials Real American Hero's come on people. This is the most American thing you can drink so stop with the IPA's, Stouts, and whatever else and grab yourself a nice ice cold Bud."
"This is the swill my old man used to suck back back in the 70s and 80s and got hammered on. I gotta it say it tastes okay but damn Bud.......whats up with the bloody headaches?"
""
"Look...who in the world of beer snobbery can give this a fair shake? Well, apparently a lot of us. I believe I will quote a well-spun review which includes the immortal words of Billy Joel ""the classic microphone smells like a beer smell"" comment is very astute. I loved it. Yes, it was mostly watery...but if I can quote another reviewer , or analyze, I should say. The watery nature of the brew does not get you hungover. I'm not sure exactly what that meant, but that's his experience... I for one, will not turn one down if ice-cold and offered to me...even for a couple of bucks on occasion...the Bros did well in their review."
""
"Tastes too much like water. Nothinh exciting and gets me very drunk and hungover due to lack of taste."
""
""
""
"I have to say, giving it a fair shake, it wasn't as bad as I was expecting.  Although its appearance is nothing to write home about, and it has the classic ""microphone smells like a beer"" smell, there are some redeeming qualities.  The taste was a mixture of light hoppiness with sweet maltiness, with an overly carbonated feel.  As surprising as the taste was I have to admit - it was mostly watery, even for a lager.  Although not the worst beer I've ever had, it certainly isn't the king of beers for me."
"not much taste but good beer to have after a long day"
""
""
"On a hot summer day you taste like America, the rest of the time you taste like beer"
""
"Solid beer , classic taste(American)"
"No detectable flavors other than a ""tin can metal"" taste. Good for slamming one right after another but other than that it hasn't got much going for it."
"The granddaddy of bad beer."
"O:  OK, only have this when I'm at a bar that doesn't serve microbrews."
"If your first drink of beer is this it may prevent you from enjoying the best of the rest."
"Good national brew for the price"
""
"Another American mass produced swill"
"Because you deserve what every individual should enjoy regularly. It's American for mass consumption of beer. Drink a six pack and sing the national anthem while taking photos of bald headed Eagles. Forget the taste forget the macro and sometimes just have some beer. This is that beer."
""
"Refreshing and crisp yet mildly sweet. I detectable hops. Rice!"
""
""

"A beer that is good for anything"

"Grain pppp real clear but that is it, nothing else but a headache. Too fizzy. No hops no nothin. Won't drink free."

"Great volume drinking beer. Love."
""
"Don't Shock Top do that flavor? (made by Anheuser-Busch, bahahahaha)"
"Solid all around festive beer! Besides that, the ""King"" label is truly self proclaimed."
"It's fine to drink, but doesn't offer much."
"Overall : Extremely bland, but still feels kinda fresh."
"Its just not as good as my peach pumpkin ale"
""
""

""
""
"Wish i had a peach pumpkin beer instead"
""
"A descent everyday drinker, but it really lacks flavor.  The best thing about these mass produced beers is that they are consistent."
"But hey...if your taste buds ( no pun) prefer this, then so be it.  I'd take ginger ale over this."
""
""
""
"I'd rather have water. At least that will keep you hydrated"
"Best non craft beer ever!!"
"Pleasantly sweet & malty upfront but disappointing finish."
"I wanted to try it just to see what all the fuss is about. It's ok. It has a very watery taste compared other adjuncts. I compare it to seltzer water, which makes it pretty refreshing. It's not as bad as people make it out to be."
"From memory, since I won't waste money on it now.  For the category, it's good.  For craft beer, it isn't."
"Slightly better than shit. Which is bud light"
""
""
"Aroma is very closed off, but great mouthfeel."
""
"One of few beers I drink draught or bottle, not to everyone's taste though"
"Problem is, you can do the same with water, and I'd rather do that."
"I only rated this water to get a accurate list of beers I've had. Horrible"
"not epic, but will do in a pinch"
""
"It's Budweiser, the watered down beer that gave North American beer a bad name for many years.  Used to drink it in college when I was dirt broke and could get it for dollar drafts, but then I discovered hard liquor and I quickly realized it's not even worth a dollar."
"Worst beer in the world. Horrible watered down junk. It's not even an American beer anymore. I cannot drink it ever, I refuse and I hate every and any beer that AH makes. They buy out other beers and destroy them, for example Bass beer use to be a great beer until AH bought them and started brewing it diffrent. Horrible company and an even more horrible product! Budweiser is the absolute worst beer I ever tasted!"
"I have often chosen this over Bud Light, which is a ridiculous watery yet somehow nasty beer.  Coors Light really does taste like water, and is actually pretty good if you're thirsty.  If my choices are light beer or Bud, then this is it.  Not exactly a ringing endorsement, but there it is."
""
"Once your lips touch that nice cold bottle of Budweiser you will instantly look up to the skies above give Jesus a wink and a thumbs up because he has bestowed upon you the King of Beers!  This heaven sent beer was made so that everyone can know what sweet mother freedom tastes like. You see old glory flying and you hear the bells of freedom singing. So kick back, enjoy and by God taste FREEDOM!"
"After a couple of red labels on the rocks I like to throw back a couple buds and if you think it's weird to chase a nice scotch with a cheap American lager I suggest you try. It'll have you ""turn down for what"" lickity split"
"good beer for what it is, not too expensive and can be found just about anywhere. The flavor is pretty mild and easy to drink and the smell reminds me of family BBQs"
"It is what it is a drinkable beer you can find everywhere for a decent price. Not good not bad."
""
"One of the best macro lagers out there"
""
""
""
"The color is extremely light and transparent. The aroma is not overly complicated. The taste is disappointing. Rice with a corn sweetness and a sticky consistency. The finish is soap with a mild bitterness. The carbonation is strong."
""
"I am not an everyday Bud drinker, but it is the most complex beer brewed in the world. I travel the world and every place I try it, is as good in the US. Also consistent everywhere in the U.S."

"Was at an NFL playoffs gathering with some non craft beer friends. I brought some of my ""good"" stuff to share. When that was finished, I chased it all down with the host's Budweiser. Honestly, it's not a bad beer considering the fancy stuff I've grown accustomed to. On the surface it looks terrible. It pours a bland straw colored color with little head. Not the most attractive looking beer for sure. The aroma for me is off putting. A non fresh graininess followed by a piss like odor. The taste is nice though; smooth, clean and a simple grainy flavor. Pretty watery and non complex but not terrible. The feel is my favorite; crisp, refreshing, light and drinkable. A good session beer and not a bad choice to watch football with. I won't start buying it but I won't turn down if offered to me."
"Served too cold to taste how bad it really is."
""
"Overall: again not a fan of this style for my choice but must say it is my choice beer if I were to drop into a dive bar. Compared to all other American adjacent lagers. There is a reason it's called the king of (American adjacent lager) beers. Cheers!"
"I grew up on it so I still have a place for it in my heart.  Corn and bubbles."
""
"It's the ""King of Beers"" !!! Really ??!!"
""
""
"5 stars fuck yea America (errr Belgium...)"
"we all know why i rated this beer so low, it is stinker! who rated it higher??"
""
"Disgusting, of course. no surprises there. moving on....."

"Blah blah blah blah blah"
""
"Ok for mass produced beer fairly strong."
""
"Oh god, whhhhyyyyyyy?! Why must this be the poster child for american beer? Why couldnt have been pliney? I would of even taken Stone or Jai Alai!"
"For the record, my rating is of the beer itself based on several of its characteristics. I'm not going to bash AB, their merchandizing, or the source of their ingredients. I've had much worse beers than this one, and I suspect that some of the extremely poor ratings reflect a personal need to ""stick it to The Man"" more than an honest evaluation of the product. If you hate AALs to the point that you can't rate them objectively, you probably shouldn't rate them. At the very least, you should familiarize yourself with the style guidelines for the beer you're rating."
""
"Looks great, but not a lot of taste but very drinkable and pretty much everyone will drink it."
"Damn fine American Adjunct Lager. Very sessionable refreshing taste with clean crisp finish."
""
"Not bad for what it is, I'd have another if it was free."
"My favorite beer, it tastes good. Smooth it doesn't have bitter taste at all but not too watery. I'm not a beer snob iv'e tried expensive beers that taste like orange peels, coffee grounds, soup, rubbing alcohol its just not for me, i want a beer that tastes like beer. ice cold in bottle is the best. Iv'e had many bad ones tho that taste old, flat and bitter, so it's kind of hit and miss depending where u buy it at."
""
"Can't believe I never rated this before. I've had this beer so many times when I was younger. One of my least favorite beers."
"Thus, the King of Beers."

"the great american lager....need i say more"
"Okay beer for cheap price. Good way to get drunk."

"This is the major problem w commercial beer. This beer sucks"

"Pours a beautiful goldenrod color with a bright white head, gives off a nose that says high school (thank you, Proust). That taste -- yes, it is the King of Beers, with ""Beers"" being American adjunct macro lagers. There's no complexity here. It's a one-dimensional lager reeking of corn, the proverbial ""like making love in a canoe"" beer because it's ""fucking close to water."" So drinkable for what it is, but knowing what it is, and knowing what real beer is, there's no reason to drink it unless offered and there are no other choices. For what it is, it's not bad. But it's certainly not good."
""
""
"I've never had one of these without a headache. Absolutely won't drink."
"great beer for what you pay. bottles very cold is the way to go"
""
""
"It's a decent cheap American Beer."
"Brewed using a blend of imported and classic American aroma hops, and a blend of barley malts and rice. Budweiser is brewed with time-honored methods including “kraeusening” for natural carbonation and Beechwood aging, which results in unparalleled balance and character. Not fucking bad"

"O- Although Budweiser doesn't offer up anything that really impresses me in anyway, it is a remarkably refreshing beer that doesn't happen to taste like piss (yes, I am looking at you Corona). Not only is it easy to drink, but it's flavours and aromas are not offensive in the least and thats what really makes Budweiser. While it may not sit well with those who normally drink delicious craft beer (myself included), I gave it a 3 overall because it is great for what it's intended to be: a beer for the masses."

"Budweiser... Does it live up to the king of beers title??? Eh... No. Very bland, but tastes smooth and clean. drinkability certainly wins over everything else with this. Very drinkable. Not much going on. Just average. Still Better than Natural ice or Bud ice, but not better than other things. Would rather have MHL or MGD."

"This beer ain't bad.  True, it's not the type of beer that one savors.  What it is, is a good lawn mower type beer.  It's also good with Asian cuisine."

"Growing up in St. Louis, this beer had to at least make my list.  It's an American lager.  That's about all I can say.  I prefer strong, complex flavors.  Budweiser is neither strong, and it's hardly complex.  But, it will always hold a nostalgic place in my heart.  You always remember your first."

"Just mowed the lawn in a Texas summer? Crack open one of these freezer cold, it will do the job perfectly. The beer itself has a medium body and decent head.

"Poured from a can pretty aggressively into a goblet there was minimal head, nice big fizzy bubbles continuously rise from the bottom of the glass. The smell is very faint and not too distinct. The taste isn't all that bad, it is mildly soapy though and the aftertaste is not enjoyable. The mouthfeel is thin like a sparkling water. Overall I guess it's good for what it was meant for which is drinking fast and without much thought."

"Of the American Light Lagers... this Buds for you. I give it a 5 because it is the beer that got me to like beer. I dont drink light lagers any more because as a style they are boring, and expensive and time consuming to hombrew. I can't make a better light lager than Bud. It's exclusive beechwood aging produces a taste, a smoothness, and a drinkability you will find in no other beer at any price.(under 7 dollars a six pack)."

"O – I have already said it but I’ll say it again this beer is just dull. Although this beer may be a top seller it is good branding and advertising which has led to deep market penetration that has this beer selling so well. And I’ll warrant it that in extreme heat or an overcrowded pub this beer is probably very welcome, hell if you hand me one I won’t preach or turn it down I’ll just drink it and be damned glad of it. But would I buy this for myself…No I’m sorry I wouldn’t. But this is an adjunct lager and it is doing a reasonable job of being just that, mass produced consistent if a little dull."

"Review according to BJCP2008 Guidelines (style 1B). Bottle 30 cl - Batch 31/10/13 B03. AROMA: slight sweet grainy aroma. no hop aroma. APPEARANCE: very clear light straw yellow color. white head with low retention. TASTE: very slight sweetness from cereals (corn). no bitterness. finishes slight dry. PALATE: very light body with very low carbonation. OVERALL: an extremely watered down lager with very diluted flavours."

"Cutie reps at the bar had a computer set up to record commercials Q&A session for commercials should they like your answers....got a free Bud for my time. I smiled politely and accepted it, continuing to smile as I took a sip. But they could see in my eyes something was wrong. Skunky flavor, with a stale egg aftertaste. I plowed through a couple more sips before my taste buds over ruled and forced me to take a bow. A polite placement of the half full beer on the counter to check my phone then accidentally leave it behind as I walk away."

"Very bad beer = belly pain"
"A standard by many definitions almost wherever you go (in the US) and sometimes the only beer you can get. Appearance was a clear yellow with a very fizzy head. The smell was full of rice almost to the point where you can't smell the hops or malt. The taste was thin but not as bad as I remembered it. Overall even though this isn't the worst or best beer, it's something that everyone has had or will have at some point."

"Pretty plain, ordinary, nobody home, American lager. It is nicely balanced but absolutely un-noteworthy. If it's hot outside and somebody else paid for it, I'll happily consume it, but almost any of the American lagers (Miller, Pabst, Rolling Rock and (particularly) Coors) are all better beers."

"Overall (3.64) - Budweiser is a great beer to have, especially in the aluminum pints. By far, and I mean BY FAR, it is the BEST way to drink this beer. Very cold and refreshing. My rating would be much lower had this not been the serving style. When that's not available, settle for it in cans. Glass bottled Bud can be downright nasty. To this day I still don't know why there's such a difference. One of my favorite macro lagers. There's a lot of hate for this beer but for what it is, it's better than most. You owe it to yourself to try it if you haven't yet."

"overall: the overall impression is that this beer is engineered to be the least offensive beer possible; no strong flavors, no off flavors, very mild taste. I'm guessing endless marketing and testing has created a beer that will offend no one. If you are looking for an alcoholic beverage that is easy to drink and that gives the drinker the notion that they are drinking beer then this is it. Really it is alcoholic seltzer water that faintly resembles beer."

"Overall: The Grand-daddy. What Caesar's Palace is to casinos and the Rose Bowl is to football, Budweiser is to American beer. Trouble is, it's also resoundingly mediocre. I don't have a problem with a good ol' American macro lager from time to time, but I'd much rather have 'Gansett or Pabst. Unlike Bud, those taste like something."

"Budweiser is a good beer for any day of the week, or any time of the year. It is really refreshing and the taste is really not all that bad. It is a great beer to have when doing projects around the house. It is a great American beer, so if you have never tried a Budweiser you should at least try it once."

"Overall- It's refreshing, easy to drink, a bit sweet for my taste and short , a good barbecue beer. Wouldn't buy again but was O.K."

"I drink this all the time and love it. When I am not drinking this all the time, I am unhappy. I think it is perfect from a can, a bottle or on tap. I prefer cans due to 30 packs not coming in bottles, plus, I like to crush the empty cans after I crush the beer down my throat. Bottles are good to smash but a mess to clean up. Regarding the taste, I can't really find dramatic differences between can vs. bottle. This beer is life blood."

"A good inexpensive beer. Better than most others in its price range. Goes down easy and is a good beer if attending a sporting event or hanging out in the country. Its not my top choice to purchase at a store, but is a go to when going out to dinner. There is a lot of hype behind the beer due to all the marketing behind it which might make it seem better than it is. Still an average to slightly above average beer."

"when in doubt and stuck with the typical BMC offerings, this is a no-brainer. adjunct lagers are thought of as swill, but this is MUCH MUCH better than the BMC ""light beer""."
"Not outstanding but not terrible. Definitely not the King of Beers as the slogan says. It's pretty average. Light in coloring, easy to drink, maybe a bit on the watery side. Definitely not the best I've ever tasted but not the worst either. I would drink it at say, a football game."

"appearance is nothing special, pale golden yellow, pitiful head that dissapates quickly. I would say the smell is the best thing about it, smells grainy and live. Fresh yeasty beer scent. Taste is not so hot, watery, grain notes, watery again and finally alcoholic taste. mouthfeel not all that bad considering this is budweiser. 2 and three quarters all in all"

"I've always enjoyed Budweiser from the time I first tried it and i'm still drinking it. I prefer it to most other beers. It's not too expensive in comparison to most other beers. I generally pick up a 12 pack a week and enjoy every one till the last drop. This one is well worth a try."

"I have been drinking Budweiser for about 12 yrs. I love it. But lately I have been exploring and have realized there is better beer out there. It has better taste, appearance, and smell than the rest of beers from the big 3. It is smooth and goes down very well. Bud will always be my beer."
"It's best asset is it's ability to go down with ease. I tailgate a lot for football games and this is my official tailgate beer. Budweiser, MGD, and Coors all go down smooth but Budweiser contains the best taste. If you're just looking to have a good time out in the woods with some music then this may be your winner. If you're going for taste then perhaps not."

It's not overly carbed either so you can chug em down if you so chose."

"Pours a very pale straw gold with perfect clarity and a loose white head that fell quickly. There is almost no nose on this beer except for a bit of sweetness and as it warms it does start to smell a bit like rice. The taste is also more than subtle with a very neutral rice character that you can begin to taste once you learn that the adjunct in this one is rice not corn. It does have a strange sweetness that could be from the yeast ro could be from the malt, it's hard to define. When I first tasted it I assumed corn, and that's how I found out there is no corn in this. It has a good carbonation but without much flavor that can seem a bit sharp. It actually finishes pretty well. Most corny adjuncts finish with a big sweet bite and a drying out but this one finishes balanced, and completely albeit dry. It does have a bit of an aftertaste like overcooked rice."
""
"Hell, I can buy Yuengling for the same."

"overall; i wouldnt call it total crap but i'd never pay for it."
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and slight vegetal aromas. Taste is much the same with watery grain, rice, and slight vegetal flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that is somewhat drinkable but just boring and watery all around."

"Everyone need to try a Budweiser even if it is only once. This is not as bad as some make it out to be. It is what it is and that is an American adjunct lager. It is not much different than many of the retro brews that have gain popularity. I have done a few blind taste test against some of the other more favorable adjunct lagers and I found Budweiser actually taste better. The beer has a soft water feel in the mouth. It finishes with a crisp aftertaste. I guess if I had a choice of adjuncts, rice would be my choice over corn. The slight dimethyl sulfide finish makes it appealing."

"Oh boy, good ol' Budweiser. The ""Great American Lager", as they say. For an American adjunct, it could be a lot worse, but the slogan has brainwashed a million of my fellow countrymen. Although, this is not to say by any means that I dislike Budweiser. Its where I, and I'm sure much of you, started way back when we didn't know any better. I'd say this is my ""back-up"" while exploring the world of brews. An ""if all else fails"" beer, so to say. The same applies when I can't dish out that extra cash for craft brew. So with this said, ol' reliable will be always a staple in my life,regardless of how many other brews i have and will try."

"Very clear yellow color. Does have a nice white foamy head. Not much of an aroma, and not much of a taste. A notch above Bud Light, but still only tastes like water with a touch of alcohol burn. The only place for a beer like this is when it's the only thing around and you're doing some grilling on a hot day. Just plain not good."

"There's really not much to say about Budweiser that hasn't already been said. It pours out a pale yellow color with a fleeting head. The smell and taste are very light. There is some perceptible hoping and malt but it is very faint. The light body contributes to the very thin mouthfeel although the carbonation level is good. For what it is, Bud is very good. It's nothing special for sure, but hardly as ""bad"" as many detractors would have you believe."

"Notes: Bottle poured down the middle of a glass with a 3"" mouth. 2"" collar of foam remained for most of the glass. A gentle sweetness on the tip of the toungue, a mild bitterness in the middle, and absolutely no aftertaste. The beer is designed to allow its yeast strain to stand out. And it does. It's not a vehicle for giant amounts of hops. It's just a damn fine beer."

"Budweiser The Great American Lager. This beer is goes with anything and everything. Budweiser has an ABV of 5.0. This brew is a great beer to drink anytime. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice thick whitehead. Smell is rich with flavor. You pick up on grains an a hit of hops. Budweiser smells like what beer should smell like. The Taste is rich with flavor.  You pick up bold taste of malts and grains. This brew is  smooth with a clean finish. This is nothing bad about about the taste of this brew. Overall I'm giving this brew a 5.0 out 5. A Great American Beer at at Great Price. You can't get anymore american than Budweiser. Stay true to the red white and blue drink Budweiser.  I will buy this brew again."

"Budweiser is often criticized for having a bland and utterly watered down taste, and in the bottle and can, it is. But for whatever reason, Budweiser is a completely different beer on tap. Now granted almost every beer is a little bit better on draft, but very few taste as noticeably different (and far better at that) than Budweiser does on tap. It's almost staggering, because the draft Budweiser is very smooth, but not bland to even the slightest, and has a sweet, yet malty taste with an after taste you'd expect from a beer aged in wooden barrels. I often like ordering it and asking Bud haters (beer Hipsters) to try it, playing it off as something else, and they end up liking it a lot, shocked to find out that it's Budweiser. My guess is that they water down their canned and bottled counter parts to save money, because It's awful. But Budweiser is a damn good beer on tap."

"Sooner or later a beer ticker will get around to reviewing this classic icon of American macrobrewery homogenous mediocrity, and my opportunity as such arrived about an hour before midnight this New Years eve, wondering what the hell to have from a really limited tap selection. Why not watch the Flames continue to stink while drinking the flagship offering of the huge brewing empire that basically now owns the 'Dome? As expected, this one is ghostly pale, although maybe a tiny bit darker than some of its competitors, a light golden straw color speckled with white foam and full of bubbly geysers from top to bottom. Looks like someone dropped an Alka-Seltzer tablet into diluted apple juice. Smells of doughy old malt, corn sugar, a middling green apple ting, and wasted youth. Tastes like fizzy water, perhaps one of the least flavorful beers I've tried, although if you scrunch up your brow and focus you will get a little sweet white bread, the aforementioned green apple fruitiness, a stale earthy hop bitterness, some other sweet flavor that tastes decidedly artificial. To be fair, this tastes better than some of its competitors, the off-flavors are muted and clearly someone wanted this to taste palatable (or perhaps taste like as little as possible) ... I get a little plaster or starchy glue but no clear metal or plastic. The finish is remarkable in a way, you get a bit of that artificial sweetness for a moment, followed by a clean bitterness and then nothing at all, like a drop of water instantly evaporating: The aftertaste is there and then its gone. Poof. The massive carbonation scrubs the palate clean. Apparently the distinctive Czech pilsener this is (very) loosely based on, Budvar, includes a hint of vanilla flavor from the malt-hops combination used and lo and behold, I did notice this here although perhaps this is just the power of suggestion. There it is. Moving right along."

The body is smooth, the balance of flavor is nice all things considered, but the flavors themselves aren't that enjoyable. I had no problem finishing a 12oz can, but it's not something I'd like to revisit anytime soon."

"O- this is not a craft beer, but is very important in US history. Many craft beer drinkers anti Budweiser, Miller, and Coors, but this is one of the best beers made. I guess I am not a rebel trying to be differant, like most craft beer drinkers are. If you grade a beer you must respect it. Although there are many beers with more taste and feel, there are not any with more history and tradition as Budweiser. No other beer rated here can match."

"Perfect clarity with a soapy, foamy white head that dissipated into soapy lacing. Nose is sweet, somewhat cloying, canned vegetables, grain husk. Taste follows nose with a sweet, sour, tangy sharpness with some slight bitterness at the end. Grain husk, slightly grassy and vegetal. Extremely crisp due to high carbonation, and mouthfeel is on the thin end of medium. American Budweiser isn't nearly as bad as the pretentious beer snobs want to think it is, especially fresh on draft. Look at any of the reviews with low marks, how many people actually took the time out to review the beer and state why it ""sucks""? It doesn't. At all. Budweiser isn't a microbrew, but it does take craft to brew something so ubiquitous yet satisfying. This beer will still be selling when the IPA fad goes the way of the dodo."

"This beer came last score wise, it lacked depth, flavour and character: it was like a cheap supermarket lager with lemonade added, too sweet and wishy-washy. I've no idea if the UK brewed version is identical to the US one, but this isn't the 'King of Beers' in my eyes at all."

"Crystal clear pale straw color with a decent sized bubbly white head that slowly recedes leaving minimal lace. Aromas of light coarse grain light green apple and a moderate spicy floral hop. The flavor is a light sweet honey like bready maltiness. Just enough spicy hop to counter the sweetness and light hop bitterness. Light body with moderate level of carbonation and a slick sharp mouthfeel. Quite a contrast from the PBR. This is lighter and less sweet but still falls well into the style guide."
"O: AAL, they are what we thought they were. But for a horrible style, this is actually one of the best of the bunch. Not something Id choose to buy (only have this cause it was a left over of a six pack I bought for my dad), but if you have to have an AAL you could certainly choose worse."

"Overall: Assuming you drink this cold (you don't want this to warm up) this isn't all bad. It's a beer intended for those who just want to get drunk quickly and don't care too much about what they're putting in their body. This is good for that purpose, as it's bland and watery, but it just doesn't have any character."
""
"The very epitome of bland. Budweiser is a pale lager with only a trace grain flavor which while not entirely unpleasant just isn't what you want in beer. It doesn't even have the normal refreshing mouthfeel of a lager, really the only thing keeping it from having 1s across the board is that while bland, it's not completely disgusting. Only approach it if you're after a cheap buzz or if there's absolutely nothing else to drink."

"Budweiser is a classic beer if you're from the states. It's the go to beer on hot days. it's certainly a conditional beer; not what I would puck up a 6 pack of to relax on a Friday night, but certainly refreshing and flavorful. I have to disagree with it being king of beers, but I would recommend it."

"O- not much to say because there is not much to it. It has really no flavor to it and no body. The bros gave it an 80. Kick backs?"
"Poured from a bottle into a glass to try to get the best possible results. Smells ... kind of like an old barn. hey smell? Hey and carbonation. Looks exactly like a glass of my pee. There is a small head that quickly (instantaneously) evaporates into nothing. There is a very slight cling to the glass...all thin carbonation. It doesn't stick though, it just leaves the glass looking spot glean like I just rinsed it out. The taste ... The mouth feel is thin and instantly washes away into flat carbonation. Then the hey taste very quickly followed by lime and ... baking soda. I get a tongue full of baking soda. This is God awful beer, if you can call it that. It's like drinking ... it's like when you used to brush your teeth with baking soda as a kid. In short...you would have to be looking for a very cheap buzz to drink this stuff. You have to be a bit of an alchi to get any enjoyment at all. Basically, I'm going to wait until my friend goes and takes a leak and then have the bar tender drain pour it. Then I'm going to order some onion rings. I have no idea how people drink this stuff."
"Had to take a taste of Budweiser now that I know what I know and taste how I taste, poured from a can into a Pint glass showed a clear yellow/golden brew with a 2 finger head that went South fast. Nothing much came through in the aroma, the mouthfeel was crisp and clean with a refreshing finish. Taste was simple as you should expect from a adjunct Lager, the fact that you can find this all over the World should hint at the respect it deserves from the standpoint of the Brewmasters who started this brand on its path. That being said beers such as Grain Belt have more flavor ""sweet corn"" to speak of but aren't found in almost every store in the United States, people can afford it, find it and pound it....that's what makes it The King of Beers...not the best beer by any means...neither were most Kings if you think about it...but a beer that is one of the best at being what it was brewed to be...a popular beer for the people."

"Bud heavy, also know as the diesel, isn't terrible. too bad it is what people from the UK get for ""American"" beer. They are really missing out. For cheap beer. It is probably the best out of all of them. It has a grainy flavor with no bite. it is tingly and pleasant on the back of the tongue. It feels like it is going to be smooth all the way up to the after taste. it goes down a little rough."
""
""
"O: As expected, the beer is not very good. There aren't any flavors that I would consider noteworthy and the mouthfeel is just too damn watery. It gets worse towards the end once the beer begins to warm up. Normally, good quality beers get better as they warm up since you get more flavors but with this one all you get is more diluted flavors and a stronger alcohol taste. It does have some flavor but it's weak and not memorable. It's actually kind of sad since I know that Anheuser Busch has the capabilities to make this a better beer but they never will. American Macro beers don't have to be this bland. It is what it is and unfortunately this is what Americans are now used to. I would give this beer a below average rating. It is still better than a Bud Light or a Coors Light."
"I'll damn it with faint praise and describe it as 'clean-tasting'. So clean that it could almost be mistaken for water. Ultimately, while Bud may be an excellent example of an adjunct lager, it's a style I don't much care for - hence my low rating. I believe that beer should have more character and presence than this, no matter the circumstances. A classic and a marketing success, but there's no need to seek it out."

"This beer sucks. Its not american, it tastes bad, it's tasteless, the flavor is minimal, and the color appears to be the same as my cat Smooches urine. This beer was never good but once the Belgians went and purchased this beer IT GOT WORSE, which is outrageously suprising seeing as the Belgians usually bring the noise when it comes to cerveza. i mean if you are trying to guzzle a sweet, sweet, sweeet brew check that tecate light; tecate light has all the flavor you would ever need AND its from Mexico. WHO DOESN'T LOVE MEXICO? Lord knows i do, get turned on to that flave and step your game up kids. One Love."

"This, ladies and germs, is the King of Beers. All this time you thought Pliny, HT or Westie would grace the throne, but you are incorrect. While I don't find it very palatable, this beer does for most Americans what they want it to do: Gets them a buzz without giving them a hassle. Lets them forget their woes by imbibing large quantities quickly. I will keep my DIPAs and my RISs, but America will always love the adjunct lager."

"Worse then I remembered! Cooked sweet rice, no hops, an aftertaste of rubbing alcohol it's fusel from poor brewing. Never again. Maybe I got the wrong batch. Pabst Blue Ribbon is better, Miller Highlife is better, National Bohemian is better. Budweiser is the overpriced worst american beer pick the other ones or buy a real beer."
""

"Overall- The classic bud taste while not too layered, isn't all that bad in and of itself, but the smell, texture, and consistancy leave something to be desired."
""
"Coming from St. Louis this is the beer I've known since birth. ""The King of Beers."" Certainly the king of adjunct lagers. This and probably either Samuel Adams, Pabst Blue Ribbon or Lone Star are my other favorite adjunct beers. But back to Bud; I love this beer. It is the most accessible beer at a fair price. It has a wonderful taste that makes up for its faint aroma. The taste is Mostly consistent of corn and grain. It's got a nice slick mouth feel that has a little creaminess to it but not a lot. I do love this beer; it's drinkable, smooth, tasty, and it's refreshing. A lot of beer geeks (snobs) slam it and think it's beneath them. But you gotta have a good go-to beer when you're not in the mood for a more experimental type beer. Maybe I'm a tad biased since I'm from St. Louis but still I highly recommend this beer to anyone if they're willing to actually try it without having a pre-conception of distaste. Enjoy friends!"

"Only 1700 people have reviewd this beer and that is amazing considering I bet every single person on here has tried it at least one time. Nobody picks up the louisville wooden bat and jumps into the bigs... They start with a Tee. Which in this symbolic move is a mega brewers lager. The only good thing about this beer is it is extremely clear. Other than that.. the taste, head retention, fizzyness, and smell are all below par."

"Ah, The King of Beers. Yes, AB has roughly 47% of the market. 47% people.... sit back and think about that. Every small/medium craft/nano/micro/home brewer out there would love to be in that position.. honestly most of the great beers I've had should be. They have a time tested formula that is worth billions. They make it cheap and they make tons of it. AB gets a lot of slack.... rightfully so.... but their plain ol Budweiser isn't the worst beer I've ever had. It's down there but not the worst. If I had to say anything good about it I'd say the color and look is appealing, better than some but to me that's where it ends. It doesn't smell or taste good however the taste is minimally tolerable. I would not recommend but I would love to shake hands with the person who drinks beer but has never had a Budweiser."

"Pours a clear yellow color with finger width half foamy half carbonated head.  Poor head retention.  Very mild lacing.  Very bready/grainy aroma with ripened bananas.  Mainly bready taste with slight banana at the end.  Moderately carbonated.  Only mild hoppiness but not very bitter at all.  Somewhat refreshing but definitely not a go to beer.  Better than I remembered it from college."

Once you move on to the craft market I see no reason to ever drink this. Maybe at a ball game where the only other option is bud light. To me it tastes watered down, I know it not, the flavors just don't do anything for me. Only reason I am reviewing is because it was left in my fridge."

"The color was a pale yellow with a nice frothy head. There is a consistent taste due to the use of consistent water type, but the taste isn't that great. Tasted like corn yet the beer is made with mostly rice and was quite bland. The beer taste bitter if poured wrong."
"The appearance was a pale light yellow/clear beer. The aroma was a little bit sweet but just smelled like normal beer and nothing too special. I was surprised with the taste because it was not as good as I thought it would have been. It kind of had a grainy/corn taste to it.

"Overall- this is often seen after work and on blistering weekends, provided by my friends looking to swallow a few back over conversation, barbecue, or fishing. I had mine today with an old pal's chatter and a Reuben sandwich. This is a daily style that deserves to be respected for what it is and for the intent of the brewery. It's well-made by people who care about what they are doing and meets it's mission as one of the great mass-market drinkers. It smells okay, goes down smooth, leaves little aftertaste, and lets you get on with the rest of your day."

""
"Overall, Budweiser is decent. I do not love it, I do not hate it, but I do drink it. It is more or less intended for mass consumption, which many craft brews are not. I will say that the average person drinking a Budweiser is most likely not having one for the complex taste, but really slamming them down for the main purpose of alcohol. Overall, it delivers and suits its purpose."
""
""
"Overall, this brew gets terrible ratings, which is too bad because it is a classic. So I'll give it mediocre ratings. It has its same flat tastes from a bottle, on-tap, and from a can. When I am in the mood for a cheap crisp beer that tastes like soda water and rice, I'll buy it."

"this beer has an undue bad name. all their other products are garbage, from shock top to black crown, to bud light and on and on, but, this particular brew, the original, ive always preferred to its competitors, and it does have a useful part to play I think. it pours a yellow straw colored watery soda fizz mess with an average white head. the nose is a lot like the can, even when its from a bottle or on tap. an odd metallic smell, but there is some grain in here, and I can get hops if I focus on it. the flavor has a refreshing mellowness to it, and while this may be all cut up with corn and rice and whatever else, it does retain some nice malt flavors, light as they are, and the hopping is crisp. I mean, im never going to go out and buy this, but in a tiny foreign airport, a concert at some beer wasteland, or a ballpark with no better options, I actually really enjoy a Budweiser. it is also the first beer I ever legally bought in the united states when I was 21 returning from overseas, so it has some sentimental function as well. to me its the classic American working mans beer, nothing special, but far from repulsive too. say what you will about it, but it aint half as bad as a miller or coors, although black crown is unforgivable."

"The only time a bud is good, is when you are feeling a little cheap or short on cash. Not the best tasting American Loggers out there, but it serves its purpose if you only want to get drunk and don't care about a good drinking experience. Some times the first one could taste satisfying after a long day of work. Then it begins to taste syrupy and pissy the more you drink. And if you do have too many, lets not forget about the bud-mud the next day. Injoy! ;)"

"Overall - The ""King of Beers"" is nothing more than a bland, comparatively flavorless brew, even amongst other adjuncts. Nothing too off-putting in the flavor, but there's not much flavor to begin with. Give me a Red Stripe, Tsingtao or Pacifico any day over a Bud."

"the classic american beer, atleast anywhere down south. tastes ok. the price is right for what you are getting. the head disappears quickly after pouring. all in all its an ok brew. not my favorite but i wont pass one up! the beer has a decent taste, not what i would call great. the beer also has alot of carbination so it kind of feels like you are drinking an alcoholic soda."
""
""
""
""
"Subtle aroma, mouthfeel and taste is great. slightly fruity aroma. finishes smoothly with little aftertaste. Very good session beer. Clear, golden color. 1 inch collar of foam in the glass. Slight bitterness is very appealing. I am not crazy about a beer that has an aftertaste that stays with me for a long time, so this beer works very well for me."

"O: If youre some where and you dont know what to get, Budweiser is you standard, any where in the world, you know what it means, you may not like it entirely but you can associate with it and it doesnt kill you (usually), thats why you will buy it, or at least thats why I will buy it, its not for connoisseurs but those those who want reliability over having mediocre over the unknown. King of poop, thats all I have to say."

"Budweiser is in my opinion the worst American ""beer"" out there. Way too much sugar and carbonation, and I know why. That is an old technique to cover up lousy brew. Also sugar is one of the most addictive substances on earth, so why do you think it is so popular with alchoholics"

If it's offered to me freely at a party, without anything else there worthwhile, I'll drink it with zero complaints. Still, it'll never be my cheap beer fix, especially when Yuengling's lager is slightly less expensive - and far superior in quality."

"There's a reason they call it the king of beers. There's also a reason it's the number one selling import, non-European beer in Europe, and the fastest growing beer in the world by volume. Despite what beer snobs may think, the vast majority of beer drinkers like a light, American-style lager beer. Bud is the quintessential model of that style. Their quality control is absolutely second to none. I've met with the management a number of times and their penchant for quality is amazing. So, Bud? It delivers exactly what it promises, a light, refreshing beer that is right down the middle of the road; not hoppy and not malty. If you want a smooth, easy-going beer, Bud is, well,... the king of beers."
""
"Overall: Like I said, I enjoy it. Call me crazy, but for what it is, it's a pleasant drinking beer. Much better than some of the garbage out there in the more budget priced sections. For an affordable, everyday beer, it's the one I go for."

"Overall - Now that I've been a BA for awhile I would never purchase this. A best case for this beer would be to mow a few down after mowing your friends lawn and this is all he had in his fridge. A typical macro I s'pose, super cheap and super available, but can't recommend."

"Ah budweiser. Everyone has heard the name and this seemed like a start to my first review. I didnt pour it into a glass, I've done so many time before and it is a straw coloured lager with a good dose of foam that dissipates rather quickly with a lace around the edges. faint smell of adjunct, and almost no flavor but that metallic, adjunct ""flavour"". Far too much carbonation. Appearance is what it should be. Its a go to beer and easily accessible. There's far far better lagers out there for the same price, but it's a step up from overpriced corona."

"Poured from a can into a lager glass. Pours a standard bright yellow with a one finger head, With absolutely no lacing. The fact that an adjunct retained a head at all gives it a slightly above average score on the appearance. The smell of of strong adjunct and corn, With some wet bread. Actually smelled a little bit better than the standard for the style, Which is usually adjunct and water. It tasted of cooked corn with a slight hint of some sweetness and absolutely NO water. Worked wonderfully considering the fact that the temperature today is 105 degrees. The mouthfeel is this beers biggest attribute. The smoothest adjunct that I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Even stronger cooked corn flavor comes through, And there is quite a bit of carbonation but the mouthfeel makes this a beer that I could drink all day. This is definitely a "" go to "" for when you want a nice, easy to drink beer on a hot day"

"O - This isn’t a bad adjunct lager, but the acetaldehyde is a surprise here. If my home brewing knowledge serves me correctly, acetaldehyde is a mark of a beer that is too young, one that didn’t let the yeast finish its job. When I think about it, this doesn’t really surprise me since they mass produce this stuff and want to get it out ASAP. Aside from this, it’s really not terrible. At least it’s refreshing."

"I'll drink it if it's cheap, free, or the only thing available. If there's Pabst, I'm going with the Blue Ribbon 100% of the time. Or the High Life if that's what's around. But I'll gladly throw back these free Buds with nary a qualm today and accept the resulting buzz."
"This beer seems to have changed to me with more experience in better beer. Simply has no taste now, looks even worse and I am 100% sure after the merger with INbev, they tampered with the recipe to make it even worse. The beechwood taste that used to be there is now completely gone, and now has a taste of chemicals."

"o - Overall I would slightly prefer a Bud Light or BL Platinum to this probably, but they're pretty much all the same. All better choices than anything Miller makes."

"Pours a pale yellow color with a lot of carbonation, a small fizzy white head that reduces to a ring rather quickly. No lacing on the glass to speak of. Aroma is grainy and adjunct.

"Pours a very pale yellow color with a big white fizzy head that leaves very quickly. Aroma is with a grainy malt quality and a touch of hops. Taste is has a bland malt taste, very thin, with soft fullness from carbonation and a not so pleasing finish on your palate. As the beer warmed up, the taste got worse."

"It pours a clear straw-like color with a instantly dissipating foam. No discernible aroma. The flavor is middling, with a honeyed corn-liquor sweetness that quickly falls flat and turns harsh.

"Budweiser is still a top selling beer despite precipitous sales declines in the last decade. Recently saw 6 pack tallboys on sale for 5 so what the hell, it's been awhile. Appearance is golden with foamy head that quickly fades away, the beer stays highly carbonated. Smell has a adjunct scent to it but mostly neutral. Taste is a bit bland, the aftertaste is slightly sour. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth. Overall much less bitter than I remember but not a bad beer at all, I never turn it down when offered but rarely buy it."
""

"Overall. Not bad as a 40 really, but the price and the last 1/4"" lose it. $3.12 for this 40, compared to $2.75 and $2.50 for malt liquor 40's that are decidedly better in the spirit of a 40. I'll get this if I'm craving a 40 and Bud Light is the only other 40 in the store."

"This pours a pale yellow and the light side of the spectrum, tons of cascading bubbles and a thing clinging of white head. The aroma has faint malt character with a musty corn sweetness. I have never taken the time to concentrate on the aroma of this on the past, but damn... this is pretty bad! The taste isn't much better. The little amount of taste that comes through the prickly carbonation is corn, bread, and a bit of a twang. No hops to speak of. The mouthfeel is atrocious, light as a feather and carbonated to the max. Overall, I think this 12 pack is going to be difficult to get rid of."

"Back in Mexico this beer was a great break from all those corn flavoured mexican beers. Back here though it's just a below the average beer. I can see why it is so popular in some places though, it's very drinkable on a hot day and if you just came back home from work on a summer evening, this is a great thirst quencher. If I was living in such a climate myself and the price was right, I would certainly keep a bunch of those in my fridge."

"Ov: Bud isn't horrible. It is refreshing, readily available, tasty and inexpensive. It is the go to adjunct Lager when you can afford a few pennies more than Busch or PBR. I never understood why so many flock to Bud Light. It's worth sacrificing a few calories to enjoy a more robust flavor and receive a mild kick from the 5.0% abv. At least this tastes like a beer. Certainly nothing spectacular, but it also doesn't deserve all the hate. If I'm at a sporting event or at a party, I won't shy away from bud. There is always a better beer but not necessarily at this price. Cheers!"

"Funny...my first review is on Bud. But I'm sick of beer snobs so I had to. For what it is Bud is truly the King of beers. It is the best American mass produced lager. Can it hold a candle to your local brews and IPA's or a Sam Adams Utopia? NO!! But its not trying to. It is a good refreshing after work beer. Im a chef and after 12 hrs on the line I want a refreshing easy drinker not a punch you in the face complex drink. I have a friend who is a beer sommelier..and he drinks Bud on the regular. If its good enough for a professional, its good enough for me. There is a time and place for everything, and at a bbq, tailgate or a few after work...Bud never fails."

"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a very translucent straw color with a 2 finger white head that dissipates quickly. There is not much smell here, slight malt, but probably because of the adjuncts used (rice predominately) it doesn't have much of one. Tastes like most adjuncts, having very little. However, there is a little bit of hops, so this brings it up a little. Carbonation seems right and beer goes down smoothly without any aftertastes. Overall, very average adjunct lager. However, not the worst."
""

"The appearance of the beer is typical straw yellow/golden with tons of carbonation bubbles. The head build quickly and died with a lot of noise. The aroma is husky grain sweetness with a metallic twinge. The taste is very sweet, almost candy like, with a nice aftertaste that is mildly bitter. This is actually a pretty tasty adjunct lager in my opinion. It is typical, yes, but it is also not offensive and rather enjoyable. The MF is the standard for adjunct lagers. I feel that this beer isn't bad at all for a standard adjunct lager, it is a little too expensive for what it is though."
""

"Don't care for Budweiser at all. Looks darker than it's little brother and tastes super grainy with little to no mouthfeel except some carbonation. not complex or tastey which leaves me wondering why this is their main beer. I don't get it and I don't want it. Leaves you wanting something else to wash the taste out of your mouth. Let this be."

"OK, I was at the Celtics game last night, and a friend bought me a Bud. I'll take a free beer, sure. In the cup, it had a pale yellow color. I was somewhat surprised at the bit of lacing, and also the head that lasted the whole time. Taste and smell - we all know it's not a highlight here. Mouthfeel was on the smooth side, and it went down fairly easily while it's cold. Not as watery as I remember. Not a great beer, but it's a staple at all sporting venues. And I guess it's better than Bud Light."

"This beer is bright and clear. It has a quarter inch of white head that recedes to a film. It leaves a little bit of spotty lacing, but really not much. Aroma is light and inoffensive. Mildly grainy, not much hop presence, it is not bad, just not especially good. Flavor is similar, mildly sweet, light and unassuming. Mouthfeel is light, good carbonation, dry, refreshing, exactly what this beer should be. I do understand why people give this lower grades, and I expected to give it lower marks, but it is an adjunct lager and it is so inoffensive and unassuming without any significant off flavors that I cant. Just drink it cold and you're all good."

It is something to drink when there is no other choice."
"What can you say about the ""Great American Lager"" that hasn't already been said? Well bud heavy will get you drunk. Pours yellow with high carbonation. Head is thin. The smell is skunky.

"O - I drank a lot of this beer growing up around chicago, not something that you savor but not horrible, on par or better than most beers in its class"

"Pale, straw yellow with a nice white head. Aroma is nothing much other than light earthy scents and grass. Taste is light malt and corn with a decent, smooth mouthfeel. But where's the hop aroma and bitterness? Where's the uniqueness of character? Well, we all know it really isn't there and isn't meant to be there. Still, it's my go-to beer when there is no craft or micros around..."

"For the life of me I could not pick up any distinct taste and thats because I was secretly given Bud. I will say if there is only domestics on tap at a bar, I'll go for this one as opposed to the light beers as it packs the most punch for your dollar. Hey it's American. If nothing else heed the words of craft beersmiths throughout the nation, if you don't like Budwiser you at least have to respect their consistancy."
""
""
"I give it a fair rating and thus I was forced to review"
""
""
""
"O-Overall this isn't a very exciting beer. The king of beers seems to be kind of an overstatement. Still, I would rather drink this than Bud Light."

"This beer is not one to brag about by any means. It is way over carbonated and the taste is something that I personally can hardly bare at times. I always finish my beer but, with this beer I find it a challenge to do so. I even at times suffer from headaches resulting from this brew. However, it is a cheap beer and people find it somewhat ""American"" to drink it. But I, as a beer drinker, prefer a beer with much more character. You get what you pay for. But I will not pay for a Bud."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is similar to the nose, light mouth feel, like a lightly carbonated sparkling water. There is little with respect to a hop note in the flavor, but again this is a mass produced American Lager. On a positive note, the Budweiser you buy in Florida will taste like the Budweiser you buy in Alaska."
"Overall: this is actually as horrible as people say. I came in thinking it would earn a 3-3.5 from me, being forgiving. Nope, it's swill. Good thing I didn't have to buy it."

"Budweiser gets a good deal of hate, and the beer snobs give it a 1 like they have something to prove, but Budweiser fits its role pretty damn well. Its an inexpensive beer that has enough flavor yet one you can pound. I like alot of stouts and ales but sometimes a Budweiser is more appropriate for an afternoon of fishin in the sun. Nice crisp feel with a subdued flavor. Definitely refreshing. Nothing better than an ice cold bud. Not the best beer on the planet by any means but not deserving of the bad rap it gets. After all, its the King of Beers."

"Had this bad boy on tap multiple times out da kegerator. If you pour it good you can get absolutely no head on it, looks like apple juice when you do. Smells just like a an average macro brew, nothing specific jumps out. Has a weird, almost corn taste that I don't normally detect out of the bottle. I'd say I prefer to drink this out of the bottle than the keg, I have no clue why it just tastes better to me. overall- don't buy just get a real beer."

"Served in a pint glass. Yellow brown gold, with rising carb. Smell is almost non existent, faint sweetness and hop but very faint. Surprisingly crisp feel with spicy taste, grainy finish. This is better than the usual bottle. Not a bad choice for an on a budget bar visit."

"I had my first Budweiser at a local tavern. Understandably, my review seems to fall out of the norm, however, I must admit, I very much enjoyed this brew. I am a Belgian-white lover, hands-down. But the crispness was hard to deny. Frankly, it was quite refreshing, the head left something to be desired but my pallet was quenched. On occasion, I think I'll be back."
""
""
"Overall it was bit higher than I expected, but I knew I never had a problem with Budweiser. Something about Bud in a can seems pretty damn manly."
"1.5 D: The only reason this gets a 1.5 instead of a 1.0 is because the mouthfeel isn't horrible. I can't believe this is this bad though."

"Like it or not, Budweiser is linked to America's history. Growing up just southeast of St. Louis, were this is brewed, I might have a soft spot for this unremarkable beverage just due to homesickness, but this stuff really isn't as bad a people make it out to be. I guess it depends on mindset and the individual himself, and what he's looking for in a glass of beer."

"Overall, well... this is a good reminder as to why I never buy this. Budweiser is my least favorite of the big 3, no thanks..."
"- A Beer Snob"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - It just flat out makes my mouth feel bad. I feel the need to go brush my teeth immediately. Jiminy Christmas this is rank-awful. I'll be going back to craft beer in a few seconds. I tried my very best not to bash this beer. But for its popularity, it's just unforgivable."
"O - Okay you have to approach this beer differently than most. It gets a horrible rap for being a bad beer, but adjuncts are pretty bad in general. If I have to drink adjunct Budweiser is the easiest."
"This is way too sweet, too carbonated, and too crisp for me. It's drinkable, but I struggle through each sip."
"O - While I might like to make fun of this beer I find it is more than drinkable and definitely not as bad as some InBev/MC brands though I have to say since InBev acquired AB I feel that Budweiser has gone downhill a little bit and I find it hard to tell the difference between Bud and Bud Light..."
"It is the King of Beers and is the beer all others are judged, hated, and liked by."
"I wouldn't keep this in my fridge but would look forward to the right situation to enjoy it again."
"Ah Budweiser. The ""king of beers"" That's a term I laugh at. Pours like your typical American Adjunct Lager: pale straw. More like urine. The smell is full of corn. The taste is somewhat dry. I don't know if this is the rice talking to us or not. In the mouth, the beer is over carbonated, and the glass shows us this. The head, while it lasts is pure white. The head dwindles down into nothing."
"Budweiser is just a beer when nothing better is available. Its ahead of the lite American beers but far behind anything that constitutes a solid brew. Its everywhere and sponsors enough events to make it the only choice sometimes. its drank because its around."
"Really this one doesn’t do much for me. But not many adjunct lagers do."
"Had this at a party and grabbed this because it was the beer with the most alcohol there. The beer poured a somewhat decent darker yellow color . The smell was just of corn and wheat. The taste was just awful.. I have never had two sips and went straight for the drain. I just dont know how I use to drink this garbage. The mouthfeel of the beer is not awful, but not good. I hated this beer so much. I just dont see how they can call themselves the ""King of Beers"". To me its one of the worst beers on the markets."
"O-overall this is a decent beer to drink for its price. nothing exceptional but i wouldnt turn one down. I can enjoy drinking it but don't look forward to getting it. always a good beer for the long haul."
"Budweiser:  Better than expected!  I was at a charity event, and my choices were Fat Tire, Corona, Coors Light and Budweiser.  Well, I was breaking my one beer per night rule, due to the festivity of the occasion.  My first of the evening was a Fat Tire.  Given the remaining choices, what is one to do?  I have not had ""The King of Beers"" in well over 30 years.  The aroma was much better than expected, the color clear and golden and the head was thin, pure white, but did last and lace well.  The flavor was smooth, properly sweet with faint hop and other flavors, and a thin finish.  Overall not bad!  This is not the place to get into the state of US beer law, the power of big breweries (even without them, most sporting events and TV programs would loose a lot of funding), and all of the other reasons I should dislike Budweiser.  The product itself, the anti-micro brew, held up well in my tasting.  The enjoyment of beer can take you to the most unexpected places."
"overall - now while i have bashed AB in the past i have to say Bud might be the true king in this style - i have had many craft lagers that are barely better then this - that being said i will have no problems ordering a Bud when in a non craft bar"
"Overall, Budweiser is better than some, and worse than most. I'm having it out of a pint-sized AmeriCAN. As long as they put it in these flag cans or their new cans, I'm a sucker for marketing and will probably buy it. And yes, I know they are owned by a Belgium company, but the AmeriCANS are patriotic and great marketing."
"You could say this is a boring beer."
"O: There's a reason I stopped drinking this after my first try. I thought I'd be fair and give it a second go, but it really doesn't hold much appeal for me, even now. It's not the worst I've had (that belongs to Tsingtao) but it's certainly nothing I'd drink unless I was in college and living off of peanuts and 1 dollar bills. In my opinion, the king of beers is a peasant."
"Overall- Not disappointing, I knew what i was getting into here, but a dollar for a big can, I'll take it. I'd bring a few of these to a party, although I'd probably choose Yuengling over this. I hesitate to call it ""smooth"" because there are so many good beers out there that are more complex and much higher ABV that are more tasty and drinkable."
"This is proper stadium beer, or building fence beer. Recommendation would be to avoid unless other alternatives rate lower."
"O: I find it a bit offensive that this beer has the ""King of Beers"" motto in its label...what is that statement based on? This beer could be a good cheap alternative for some but I would recommend to avoid it and cough a few more bucks for something better and with more taste."
"Thin, watery mouthfeel. Tastes carbonated and bland with an almost sweet, stale taste. I couldn't get over that strange sweetness, reminded me of the aftertaste of applesauce that has begun to ferment. I would go for just about any other mass-produced domestic over this one. I can tolerate a poor beer, but I couldn't finish this one. That's never happened to me before (yes, I am ashamed). I am simply not a fan."
"This is truly the Rodney Dangerfield of brews!It gets no respect. In fact, it is a decent thirst quencher that is ok for a night in the sports bar or when you are low on funds! It pours a nice clear yellow, it has no scent to speak of, it is not offensive to the taste being very neutral and has no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is sodalike, pleasant."
"Budweiser pours a clear pale yellow with on finger head that vanishes quickly, with no lacing to speak of. I doesn't really have too much of a smell. At most a touch of grain in the nose. This beer is just offensive tasting to me. I have to say this is the most unpleasant of the macro beers. The others are light enough to be non offensive, this one sits poorly. It has a similar mouthfeel to seltzer water with slightly less carbonation. This is a beer I would not even crack open in an emergency. I find it strange that with so little flavor, I still find it so offensive."
"D - The king of beers?"
"I have to say, I was biased against Bud and other american adjuncts for awhile. But lately I have come full circle. I just recognize the value in these brews lately. They are refreshing, light, and inexpensive, and accompany a football game quite nicely. Don't get me wrong, I would choose any Sam Adams beer over this. But I can't hate this beer, for the price I think it's pretty darn good."
"We've all drank it, and I'm sure, had mixed feelings. In my opinion its not as bad as everyone says. For a macro lager made for mass consumption it has more flavor than one should expect. Typical appearance for a lager and a distinct pretzel flavor. The mouth-feel is crisp and refreshing which is it's best quality. I'm not arguing that its a great beer, just good for what it is."
"at barneys beanery you cant beat the $3.00 budweiser on tap special. in all reality i prefer this lager over heavyweights as heineken. pours golden yellow slight lace only knock on this domestic is the taste. enjoy it much better from tap than from a can or a bottle."
"Food match: Not much out there that wouldn't completely overpower the taste of this beer... light fare it is then: grilled chicken, with a green salad and a light dressing (light in flavour that is)."
"Ok. So i'm not going to shit all over Budweiser because when it comes down to it, it is my favorite cheap beer. I must say that if I'm picking up a 30-rack for a party I always lean towards the good ol' Bud diesels over Natty or Coors; however, that is not to say that this is a particularly good beer. If i had to give it an adjective, I would say that it is a bearable beer. Far from the best, but not quite at the bottom of the pack."
"""King of Beers"" eh? I call bull$hit! Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a regular lager glass. Extremely pale. Even more pale than Rolling Rock which claims to be 'extra pale'. Poured pretty aggressively, causing a 1 inch head to show up, but it fizzled away immediately. Smell was almost nothing except maybe some grain. I couldn't smell any of the 'choicest hops' or 'best barley malt' it claimed to have on the bottle. Taste was almost nothing except maybe some grain and grassiness. There's nothing horrible about it. If your goal is to get drunk, you can slam some Budweiser pretty easy. No nasty aftertaste. So it avoids getting an F."
"Due to its affect on your palette, I recommend reserving this beer for times when you're specifically only going to be enjoying beer (without food) or after a meal has been consumed. Bud Light may be the superior beverage to consume with food but Budweiser is a delicious treat all on its own. I enthusiastically recommend this beer to all of my friends and suggest it here too. Despite its faults, after just one sip, you'll see why Budweiser is America's premier beer."
"Overall: A little more robust than Bud Light. Very light and refreshing beer. Fits the guidelines."
"All in all, I feel that Budweiser deserves its spot in the convenient store cooler. When you're kicking it with your buds and need something readily available to get wasted on, Budweiser would be a solid choice."
"Not a slam but definitely avoid this beer! I don't know why there is so much popularity of it. Maybe mine was skunked or a bad batch but this was horrible at best. The look is a typical American Lager look. Taste and mouthfeel were absolutely horrid. Overall avoid this beer and go for some Coke instead."
"Caveat: I always rate to style, and for an adjunct lager, this really isn't that bad; it is closer to completely average. A little lighter on flavour than its Canadian competitors, but it probably makes up for this in drinkability. Honestly though, the only reason I bought this was to review it, and I'll probably never buy Bud again."
"I will say that Budweiser is my favorite of the major American names (Bud, Coors, Miller), but obviously that isn't saying much. I can deal with having these from time to time, especially if my options are Bud and Bud Light (although water would do too, or soda). Sometimes you just want an unassuming, light, no frills beer. Sometimes."
"O- Oh you Americans, stop whining please! Be thankful that at least you have this en masse when you could have one of our shitty beers."
"Overall your classic lawnmower beer but with perhaps a bad aftertaste."
"Drink enough and it will make you drunk. That's the best I can say for this yellowish fermented water+? To be honest, I can barely tell the difference between Bud, Coors, Miller, and any other American domestic swill. But let's be honest; despite the commercials, they really aren't going for flavor. They want to produce the most beer at the cheapest expense, without offending your senses. So I guess their market share has proven their success at those commercial goals. Good for them..."
"Budweiser beer is truly the king of American style adjunct lagers. It tastes the way it should taste, is priced the way it should be priced, and is absolutely one of the most consistent beers I have had in my few years as a beer drinker."
"O - This stuff is disgusting. I won't drink it even if its the only beer at a party."
"I'm 25 and so is one of my good friends. His father is in his late fifties and took us fishing so of course we drank good old bud heavy. Straight out of the can is how this was drank but I have seen many Bud's in a glass so I know there is decent head retention at first but that fades about halfway through the glass. Nose is lightly grainy and almost sour. No trace of hops, only the faint cereal and adjunct regularity. Flavor is bitter and tingly from all the carbonation. Best served ice cold because the sour grains will ravage your palette. No hops again in the flavor just the plain, mildly grainy flavor. Finishes crisp and thirst quenching. This beer serves its purpose in certain situations. Fishing on a boat baking in the hot sun is one of them. Bland overall but will always hold a ground in America."
"Overall, it is really not a terrible beer, and I think the rating should be much higher than it is. You have to judge the beer for what it is, and that is a beer for the mass consumption by a people with the blandest taste in food and drink of any people on Earth. By that standard, it passes with flying colors. For those of us who desire more, than yes, you should look elsewhere."
"Like most people I imagine, I've drank my fair share of this, but I find Budweiser to be just plain unpleasant to drink. This to me is among the bottom of the barrel for macros, there are better options at a cheaper price."
"King of beers? Strong statement. I would say this is a lager that is over priced, and absolutely not the king of beers. Is it drinkable? Sure. If someone offered me one, would I accept? Sure. Would I personally go buy this? No. A- it looks like a beer. S- not very good. T- no hops detection. Only drinkable if it's very cold. M- mouthfeel is ok. O- better adjuct lagers out there, would never buy this."
"The taste is similar to the smell, mainly some grass and corn with a slight woody character. Light body with lots of carbonation, causing the beer to be quite refreshing. There are better macros, but bud is not bad."
"drank straight from the can lots of corn rice and meal smells with some hops and bread..taste was grain some wet grass and hops and malts..mouthfeel was crisp and pure well carbonated..BUD is what it is and they make it very well..its not a bad brew and every once in awhile i enjoy one"
"After my recent tasting of Bud Light led me to believe that my standards have shifted slightly, I knew I had to review this beer. To my relief, it's pretty much what I remembered. It's an average macro lager. There are better (and cheaper) ones out there, but this is not embarrassingly bad. I may never drink it again, but I didn't hate this beer. My ability to swallow 24 ounces of this without gagging makes me feel like less of a beer snob."
"Overall: The King very well might be a King, but he is not the King of all beer. He spends all day rolling in the hay, cavorting with skunks in the corn fields. The only regularity in his day comes with his morning cereal. If he is King and Kate is Queen, I think the praying mantis does it right. The King is a play-King, but he plays well."
"beer snobs of the world have a negative opinion, but where ever you go you will see this great tasting beer being sold and thats the bottom line."
"There's something to be said for that."
"O: Eh. Not much to say about the self styled ""king of beers."" Good enough if that's all that's around, but a very mediocre brew altogether."
"taste and looks like water.... no aroma... no head... i hear its very hard to make though and they get it the same every time... i guess that is one positive... oh and they do have good commercials!!!"
"O- Not very enjoyable. Wouldn't be having this if anything else was available, or if I had to pay for it."
"Overall: That this brew dares to have same name as the original Czech budvar …With just the tiniest bit of self respect they would change the name into something else out of respect for the Czechs! This beer is light-years away from their quality and it is hardly drinkable."
"D: It would be very easy to drink six of these in one sitting, but I don't know how much anyone would enjoy that."
"O: Well, I thought that this would be funny. It’s actually more sad than anything else. To think that this is one of the most popular beers in America, and that they actually make a LIGHT version of this…and it’s even MORE popular! Aaahhhh! I’m very happy to be in the minority there."
"Pours a light yellow color w/ almost zero white head. The smell is that of corn, and slight malt. Very faint. Taste is very nondescript, w/ the corn flavor really coming out. Very water-like in consistency and flavor. Not sure why anybody who really enjoys tasting beer would drink this voluntarily. Feel is super thin, w/ an awful aftertaste, which thankfully goes away quickly. Overall, this is not a beer for anybody who really enjoys drinking beer. I'd rather drink water or iced tea if this is my only option."
"Very light pale color, watery, slight metallic hop flavor and a little corn. It’s refreshing, I’ll give it that, but if I’m looking for flavor with my refreshment I’ll go elsewhere. It’s a typical cheap, mass produced pale lager, so what do you expect?"
"Final Thoughts: Coming in with a unbiased mind it helped me to see this isn't as bad as I had thought, but it isn't anywhere as good as even the lower end crafts. I can see why people enjoy it, it's very easy drinking with pretty low ABV. Not the best by a long shot, but I think it could have been alot worse."
"O: Nope. In the batter's box is Bud Lite, can't imagine what's going to happen here."
"Drank it ice cold from a bottle. The bottle's appearance is okay I guess. Red, White, Gold, Blue. It doesn't smell great. Faintly of cooked corn. Full flavored, but in not good way. Concentrated adjuncts. We used to call this one Bud Heavy as I recall. That's still a good name."
"The taste is beyond bad. A lot of beers get knocked on hear for not having any taste, particularly the huge light beers (Coors Light, Bud Light, etc...), there is a fair amount of taste with Budweiser, it's just a bad taste, that makes me want to drink anything else, but."
"The smell is bland, but with a decent head and a refreshing taste, you have found a winner in Budweiser. It is hands down the best macro in the world. It's tough to rank it against many micros because different times call for different brews. BBQ's, baseball games, concerts, etc... Budweiser cannot be beat. Lounging on the couch at a relaxing gathering with friends, maybe it can be beat. But all in all, this is a good buy for any circumstance."
"Overall a below average beer. How did this ever become so popular?"
"This is the beer I'd steal from my Dad. Need to review it. Had warm on tap at concert. pours a pale yellow. no head. no lacing. smells of corn oil. taste is acrid. needs to be cold. i guzzled one on line for restroom so i wouldn't have to prolong the agony. Mouthfeel is off, tacky? Needs to be cold. easy drinkin though. yea, I made the right choice to mature up to craft."
"O - Certainly not my beer of choice, but I would never turn one down."
"Overall: What more to say? Its just a bad beer. Of course compared to the thousands of quality beers out there, but even compared to other bad American lagers, this is just tasteless and borderline offensive. The fact that this is the most popular beer in the world is both saddening and slightly pathetic."
"O - Budweiser is a beer to be enjoyed during beer pong, college parties, and whenever it's the last brew in the fridge."
"T: I'll take this over Bud Light any day, but not over too much else. Grains, malt, honey and a strange metallic sourness towards the finish. Drinkable, but not exactly memorable."
"The average American adjunct lager. No more, no less. No good. (Though, to be fair, it is better than Bud Light and Bud Light Lime!...so there's that...)"
"Bad beer. Worse than Busch."
"O - I'm clearly not a fan of the company's business practices or their swill but this beer isn't offensive. It's just not good."
"The one thing I truly take away from this beer is that it taste like just beer. The response that I have to a beer seems to always come back to a comparison of styles to budweiser. It is average to me in every aspect of what a beer is. The label is the most impressive feature here but it is also the only impressive feature."
"Not an attractive beer by any means. I'll need help running through the case. Will likely give away to the same neighbor. Even still, I've had way worse. Have to hand it to Bud for putting out such a consistent bland product for the masses."
"Overall, not the worst beer I've had tonight hahaha!"
"O - Standard macrobrew, content yourself for what it is, certainly not the worst of them, but if one is ever stuck, 'it would do'."
"It has been quite a while since I had one of these... born on date of Jan 06 2011, not the freshest. I must say that those who say there is no discernible difference in taste between Bud, BL, ML, Coors, PBR, etc. are flat-out wrong. This Bud, for example, is a very different tasting beer compared to AALs that I am more acquainted with such as PBR and/or Narragansett. The aroma is very light and has faint Sake-like notes of rice and alcohol. The taste is very light as well, offering almost no bitterness but lots of pale crisp dryness and a bit of an alcohol punch. The feel is sharply effervescent and is an integral part of the overall brew. Not the best beer, but it is not as bad as, say, Bud Light or Michelob Ultra."
"Overall for a ""flagship"" beer I can't for the life of me figure out why this beer is so popular. It's nearly flavorless and doesn't leave me wanting another in any way."
"This beer serves its purpose well as a thirst quencher. No offensively bad flavors and no notable good ones. Very one dimensional and plain overall, serviceable for a hot summer day or a family BBQ."
"O - I poured this brew into a glass, but drinking it out of a can is almost a must. Definitely one of the better BMC pairings. The 4th of July can is the shiz, best can ever. Brew is best served *ICE* cold"
"Overall this beer is just good for beer pong really. Wouldn't enjoy it on it's own."
"A."
"Overall a very weak beer, especially because I am into craftbeer now since last winter. Would work well while sitting outside with 30+ degrees Celsius though. But even then there are better alternatives."
"O: Just as bad as I remember it. Not very flavorful at all, which is why it appeals to a large population. Plenty of other adjuncts I would prefer...if I have to drink one."
"So I am sure no one needs to read these reviews anyways but the beer is straw yellow, a half finger head forms. The smell is of barely. Taste is bitter which is noticeable immediately and remains long after you have finished the beer. The beer tastes and looks watered down but really its just lack of hop flavoring."
"This beer isn't too bad; I'm not sure it deserves the across the board 1 scores that it often gets. Sure, it is somewhat offensive smelling, and if served at any temperature above ice cold, it doesn't taste much better than it smells. But you could do a lot worse for a macro beer. Still, I probably won't have another one for a long time."
"Overall this is absolutely a beer to avoid - just poured it out."
"overall i suppose this is a pretty fair interpretation of the ""standard american lager style."" on a personal note i say this style of beer sucks. on a more personal note this is the first beer i can remember drinking when i was like 10. i hated it and it would be the last beer i would drink for like five or six years, had that first beer been like an imperial russian stout... the world might be a different place."
"*Paired with Chinese food"
"O- When I'm in the mood for an adjunct lager I go for this or a Coors Light, they both are very inoffensive and clean."
"I'll drink it on a hot summers day or whenever, but nothing impressive here."
"O: Made for the masses not for the Few The Proud The Beer Advocates."
"Overall - One of my least favorite adjunct lagers and least favorite beer overall (next to Corona that is). Tasteless to a large degree and only good when you are looking for something cheap to play beer games with."
"Terrible, terrible beer. Poured from a bottle into a glass with no head and absolutely no lacing. The only reason I gave this obvious detail is because 250 characters were required. Smells like a rotten piece of beef and heavy yeast. Tastes like water with a microbial yeasty finish. Disgusting beer. Not the king of anything. Seriously, bud light is better."
"drinkability: the epitome of American lager-pilsners, very basic, it does the job and is drinkable yet nothing impressing."
"Came out the palest of yellows with a thin white head capping it off. No lace. Nose was dry and grainy. Faint citrus and husk. The mouth was crisp and refreshing. Excellent feel. Sweet corn, lemon zest, cheap grains make up the flavor profile. If ever I were to get this beer again, on-tap it would be. This was a refreshing and simple brew. Good one to wash down some wings..."
"Verdict: Not surprisingly, I’m not going to be ready to bow down to this “king” any time soon. Watery, boring, thin, and too sweet, Budweiser is just what you’d expect it to be."
"if adjunct lagers are your thing, ud be a fool to buy this. not much better than carbonated water. there are so many better ones out there, ehhhemmm...PBR, yuengling, genesee. a side from reviewing purpose, ill never drink this again, mainly due to there ridiculous advertisments."
"Not really my thing."
"Overall - Obviously not the pinnacle of what the beer industry has to offer, but I think that there are worse."
"I love the way they market though… they are all over the place. This beer is nothing fancy. It’s a domestic, very easy to find, and one that I know I will have again if nothing more than convenience. Bottoms up… and hurry up, you don’t want to leave the taste of this beer in your mouth for long. (Add a lime to this if you don’t mind putting fruit in your beer.)"
"This stuff is ok. Basically the prototype for the American adjunct lager. Simply put, this stuff is the definition of average in a category that is way below average making it undesirable."
"Overall average for this style. There are better adjunct lagers."
" You get a very subtle slight hop taste mixing in with the rice taste as well. The rice taste is definitely not bad at all though. I really detect no differences between the on tap version and the bottle version. Maybe a crisper and just an extreme tad bit more of a noticeable hop presence which really is approaching zero hop taste. All I can say about this beer is only pick it if theres nothing else but the light versions of the big 3 companies."
"Overall - I really probably should have left this piss in the bottle, at least it might have retained a bit of carbonation. The only redeeming quality about this beer is that it doesn't taste bad, it just water."
"Not all the creative marketing in the world can get me to drink this beer if there are other choices. This beer gives me headaches....like champaign. The color is....surprise...golden clear with bubbles. The smell and taste are grainiy. Mouth feel is fine. Just cant handle the headaches."
"O: It is what it is. Flavorless and crisp. Thankfully this will be my last and only experience with this beer."
"Clear yellow body with white frothy head that leaves some lacing. Aroma of sweet adjuncts, grain and some hops. Taste is very similar to it's aroma: sweet adjunct, grain, rice, subtle hops towards the finish. A somewhat coating sugar remains on the palate. Light, fizzy body. The best of the adjunct lagers but not the end all, be all of beer that too many people believe it is."
"Better than bud light at least. But seriously, water."
"Pour doesn't start off that bad, light golden color with a fluffy white head. Aroma is slightly vegetal, slightly sweet and really hard to pick up. I'm able to pick up the vegetal feel even more in the taste along with that slight sweetness, no presence of hops. It certainly isn't the worst beer I've ever drank but it is far from the best either."
"O: Extremely mass production tasteless adjunct lager. No soul"
"Overall - not a bad tasting beer, but it also doesn't have a strong taste of anything, but still more so than some others."
"The taste was clean and crackery. Just a touch of hop bitterness and a green apple note. Nothing foul, but nothing outstanding. The beer serves two purposes: To cool you down on a hot day, and to wash down food."
"I've had my fair share of the king because somebody close to me will drink nothing else. I'd never gotten around to reviewing it because when I spend time with these people it's precious and I think that even though this is monstrously watered down beer, many times having a beer is about much more than the liquid."
"The King of Beers. The Great American Lager. The ultimate T&A TV-ad beer. Yes, crap in a bottle all the way. I give it a 0.1 because [censored for BA]. Pours light straw-yellow. Smells of metallic, stale urine and tastes about the same, with maybe some small semblance of a hop in there somewhere. Light and non-refreshing, leaving a metallic, unpleasant aftertaste. Obviously to be avoided."
"Pours a small one finger head, the body is completely see through, yellow and lots of carbonation. The head is already gone, oh goody. Small possibility of lacing, we shall see. Overall the appearance is pretty bad, nothing good to speak of here, looks like a crappy american adjunct lager. On the nose, I get that sour adjunct lager smell, maybe some sweet malt in there somewhere, no hops to speak of. Maybe it's the fact that I've had way too many adjunct lagers recently, or maybe it's Budweiser beer, but bud and bud light have seemed especially boring on the smell and taste, like, NOTHING to them at ALL. Wow, I actually think I like bud light more, and that's hard to say, there is almost no taste here at all. I would almost venture as far as to say that they just made the same beer and slapped two different labels on it. I mean I get that sour adjunct taste, and some malt, and that's it, the rest is water. Yeah, there is just nothing else to this beer, pretty weak beer. Is it easy to drink? Yes. Is it the worst flavor ever? Close to it, but it's not a Busch. I mean I feel like a broken record, I'm saying the exact same thing about bud as I did about bud light, cause they are the same F-ING beer. Mouthfeel is atrocious, too much carbonation and super thin and watery all around. Drinkability is ok, but just because it's so watery. I mean the only difference between these two beers is that I got ok lacing in the bud light, and ok to bad lacing in the bud. Overall, what more can I say, bud light with worse lacing, I'm happy to say I only have one more bud beer to review."
"Avoid avoid avoid."
"D - Like I said earlier, American Adjunct Lager is far from my favorite beer style. I guess if I was forced to drink the style, this would be toward the top of my choices. Would be easy to drink on a hot Summer day...still not sure I should have soiled my Stone nonic with it though."
"O: Purchased for the sole fact that it was $2 at bar. Not doing that again. Was not impressed with Budweiser, first time having it in years and will not try again for a long time."
"M/O: Very fizzy and crisp. Actually quite refreshing. Even though I give this beer a poor review, (we all know it's a cheap macro beer) it is one of the most enjoyable crap beers. I'll take this and PBR over most adjunct lagers; especially over Coors and Coors Light, gross. So if I'm on a budget and headed to a boozer, there's a damn good chance I'm walking out with a 6/16oz pack of Bud."
"Ah yes the ""king"" of beers. This was given to me at a family gathering and I accepted even though I wasn't thrilled. The beer pours out as a traditional straw pale yellow with a little white head. Really nothing to rave about. The taste is slightly sweet but doesn't have anything but a malt backbone screaming at you. The mouthfeel is drinkable and light."
"M- Im a sucker for good popping carbonation. Nothing really else here for me."
"Drinkability: Budweiser walks a fine line between being an acceptable light American lager and generic, bland fizz water. The experience can be pretty dry and dehydrating. Once you start to pound them and get used to the taste it becomes much easier to drink. Definitely more drinkable than Miller and Coor's Original, just not as flavorful. I've never been a big fan of this beer. But, it does work as a highly drinkable generic beer. A crowd pleaser."
"Drinkability: : Just not that good. I can drink it and I don't hate it, but it doesn't really bring anything to the table."
"D: Aside from the taste this was a half decent beer, sadly beers need to taste good."
"Budweiser is a solid brew. Of course it is quite favorable to rip this beer, but I won't do that. With the advent and popularity of light beer, Budweiser must stand above and beyond this. Budweiser is a smooth, highly drinkable beer. It's not necessarily the most boldly flavorful brew, but it is tasty and made with with the utmost of care. Say what you want to say, but Anheuser Busch does get high marks for quality control. Crisp, consistent, refreshing, that is Budweiser."
"Overall - Well, it is what it is. It really isn't a bad beer and is one of the better ones in the adjunct lager category. This particular can was given to me at a friends house and I didn't turn it down.. but I wouldn't have bought it for myself."
"D- There just isn't enough here to bring me back for another. This one was left over from a party and I decided to give it a crack. Far from the worst beer but nothing worth drinking beyond the sheer alcohol effects."
"Value: Horrible. Should be $1.99 per sixer, but it's actually almost as much as Yeungling. A good test beer- if someone says they like this one, they sure don't know beer."
"D- It has high drinkability cause its as easy to drink as water. You could fly through a case of these and not even know it, and possibly not enjoy it."
"I loved Bud years ago, before I tried a real beer. Now I can barely drink it! It has a watery, quickly dissolving head. Nice clear yellow color, but when you use 40% rice and corn it's probably easy to achieve. The smell is pretty bad, no richness or malt aroma. Tastes like seltzer water and cornmeal mixed together. It's really sad that this is the number one beer in America. Sad!"
"Quite probably my least favorite beer, if I can call it that. I call it CO2 with alcohol and water basically."
"Dr: Cheap enough in America. Would I drink it again? Not over most cheaper American macros if I were looking to get drunk. Stick to steel gravity high reserve if you're sacrificing taste to get locked. Elsewise, lads, truth be told this tastes like what I imagine your urine would taste like after having a real beer. To its credit, it should be said that 5.00% is a fair bit above the standard 4.3% of many beers."
"D- To me, in order to be really drinkable a beer has not just to be quaffable. It has got to have some character to make things interesting. This is just quaffable. An easy drink but it cannot get more than 3"
"Overall, I don't think this beer is horrifying. I mean it's by no means a good beer, but if it were the last beer on earth, I would still drink it. It isn't that bad. But it certainly isn't the last beer on earth, and I sure hope it won't be."
"Drinkability: It's a smooth beer accompanied with bland flavours and aromas. This beer lacks alot of flavours and I wouldn't even drink this to get drunk."
"D: Easy to drink, but not anything special. A bit on the watery side, in both flavor and body. Not bad for an american lager, but also not something I would buy too often. Only when I'm low on cash and can't afford anything more interesting."
"D: for 5% it goes down easy. Not my favorite American Adjunct Lager but it isn't the worst."
"D: I have no problem drinking macro beers. I often do when I'm with friends. But there is something about Budweiser that makes me cringe. The only time I can even finish a Bud is if it's ice cold and I chug it. I also feel like Bud Light has more taste and more of a body to it."
"When standing next to its cousins, this one is not the worst. Period."
"Just bad. Avoid drinking this one. Even if it's beer pong."
"*Do they really still do fuckin beechwood aging? that must be a FUCK OF A LOT of beechwood. do they hire a bunch of drifters to comb the shoreline everyday for new pieces of wood? This ""beechwood"" claim is highly suspect!!"
"Drink - I don't suggest it to anyone. I don't buy it unless I need a lot of cheap beer. I can say that I can drink a lot of it and that under the right conditions I think it is just fine."
"I've decided to edit this review as this beer really has got worse the more I drink.."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink...but why would you. I finished this in 2-3 gulps. Low ABV makes this something only good for drinking games...lawnmowing....or your kids friends when they stop by."
"I definitely will not have this beer on my list as a have-to-have. I can think of at least five other adjuncts that I would rather have. But, if/when I am in the position to have another, I most likely would not pass one up."
"Drinkability- 3rd to Bud Light and Bud Select in Drinkability but awesome! Can enjoy, slam, or have anytime of the day. Had three in a row and will now switch to a Bud Select to see how this tastes on tap!"
"YUK."
"OVERALL: The Budweiser lasted about half the glass before getting drain poured, which is better than the BL. It was more drinkable in the sense that it was vaguely recognizable as beer and had some sparkle to it. Also, on tap, the beer was a bit warmer than normal. Out of a COLD bottle, when the temperature hides some of the flavor, it is much easier to drink."
"For a standard every day beer the king of beers isn't all that bad. Sure it lacks anything extraordinary, but this beer does go down smooth and is surprisingly drinkable. This is my go to standard beer. This beer seems to me to be less carbonated than the rest of the beers around it such as bud light, pbr, miller, and icehouse. I respect this beer simply for the fact that it has endured, and I myself could never really say no to a budweiser unless there was some ipa or Belgian style goodness around."
"Serving type: bottle"
"It is what it is. This beer is average at best and I'm sure that's what Anheuser-Busch want it to be. I would never buy this stuff but maybe it's mostly because I'm not a big fan of light lager. As an adjunct lager, it's really not all that bad. I've had much worse. An averagely drinkable, average tasting beer for average people who enjoy average things."
"This beer gets a lot of negative reviews on here but overall for the money I think it's an ok beer. Has a clear golden yellow color, with a distinct smooth taste. I've had it from a bottle, can and on tap each time I feel that if it's fresh it taste smooth."
"D-Well we know you (okay some people) can drink a lot of these. So technically it's drinkable in the same way that Arbor Mist is a drinkable wine."
"Overall its no king of beers, but a beer that never lets me down. Tasty and drinkable."
"Then again, it's a great bet if you are drinking through a funnel."
"Drinkability: If you want to pound down some beers, and don't want flavor getting in the way, this is the beer for you. Not for me, though. Finishing one was a trying time for me."
"Well I guess if you can stomach, very easy to drink as it lacks ALL things beer."
"D: This for me is the one of the worst American macro/adjunct lagers out there. if you love people, do not get suckered into buying this for a party."
"D--4.5 for sure. You could rip these all day long at the beach. That is this beer's intention, and for that, I am rewarding it"
"Summary: This is a good beer. I gave it 7.8/10, or C+. I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. After drinking Bud Light for several years, I imagined this to be a commercial ""beer flavored water", but it's not. It actually tastes like an Ameerican Adjunct Lager! I don't know if I would call this the ""King of Beers", but it's definitely something I wouldn't turn down. I would drink this beer again."
"Overall this is something you can down on a hot summer day. Otherwise, it's best to stay away from this beer."
"Drinkability - Well, it gets props for ease of drinkability... though desire to drink more is really non-existent. There is nothing compelling that really entertains the idea of another."
"D: It is what it is, a mass produced lager that tastes pretty awful compared to abundance of great beers out there."
"D-It is what it is, a standard american lager. Light, easy drinking, and fairly tame in both hops and malt. Not my glass of beer, but I applaud AB for their high standards that they assign to their beers; no flaws and consistent everytime."
"NOTE: If I reviewed to the style, which is probably the best way to review, this would get slightly higher marks, but since I already tend to review more to my tastes than to the style, I believe I should stay consistent with my history and review to my tastes. I will say that as far as American Adjunct Lagers go, you could do a LOT worse than a Budweiser."
"Overall: I am not going to slam this beer like others have. It's a beer made for the masses and isn't that bad. A&B has been making this for a long time and are consistent with the final product."
"Drinkability- i dont even find it as drinkable as u would expect a watered down light beer to be. its not that its heavy or has any unique blast of flavor, its simply not a good taste, and not a good beer to drink. thats my opinion anyways. like i always say, once you cross the sacred river over to the land of craft brew, you must leave this beer behind."
"Drinkability: I can't stomach this beer; not just because I'm a beer snob, I'll at least admit to that, but because this beer has nothing to it. This is a beer you'd drink if all you wanted was to ""get drunk""."
"I wouldn't go out of my way to get these, though. I'd take a Sam Adams or Heineken over these anyday, but they're good for a cheap grab."
"Of course Budweiser is the beer that's cool to hate among people here who compare it against completely different styles of richer, darker, hoppy micro-brews beers. But I love it and I'm not afraid to admit that's it's a fine, well made and consistently refreshing brew."
"Most likely the second most consumed beer in the USA, but must be because of the amount of exposure it receives in advertising. Two finger head of white froth, with no lasting power. Lace has some cling, but not for long. Color matches a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells of corn, wheat, and barley. Taste is muted cereal grains with a sweet aftertaste. Water in my mouth. Good for yard work, is refreshing, but not much more flavor than water, just more kick."
"D- Watery, lacking in flavor, rank musty. Hard to drink."
"D- Can easily buy a 12 pack and drink the whole thing. Cheap beer more for parties."
"D - If you're looking to get a quick drink, of nothing special at about $3.00-4.50 you can get a 40oz of this cheep beer. It's nothing I would consider as a top 10, a top 15 even, but at the same time, it's beer."
"I grabbed this beer with high hopes, I have never really had it before. It's my First brew of 2011 Hopefully the worst."
"Straight from the bottle tastes sweet light malt don't pick up any corn but for the matter hops are missing as well . Smell is minimal sweet light malt. Overloaded on carbonation which is par for the style. Not a bad beer one of the macros ill enjoy freely but nothing exceptional ."
"EDIT - this gets worse as it goes....wow...smh"
"D: Nah. Next time I shall reach for the bottle of red wine sitting there."
"This is another beer to mow and play golf with. It is good for that at least. I usually have this in cans when i do have it and it tastes fine smells ok drinks well, and is cheap and easy to find. It is like the rest of these mass produced beers. I would not drink it again."
" The taste of very light malt w/ slight rice sweetness and grainy quality begins the mild effect on the palate. The slight taste of pilsner malt is there, but overwhelmed by crisp rice taste so faint it almost is as if it isn't added for the taste. A pretty bland experience to me, overall just ok if no other better options are available -too light and thin for the style. It may work to quench or as a palate cleanser with greasy food, but it really is poor and lackluster drinkability + taste-wise."
"Overall, extremely mediocre beer. When I began drinking beer, I started with this and stopped after trying other beers. It is drinkable, but what's the point when that's the only good feature?"
"Visit my beer blog: http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Perfect if you've mowed your lawn and your fridge is empty."
"Overall if you've never had one i'd say its your duty as an american if u are one to drink this beer at least once."
"I'll give it this -- at least it's substantially better than Bud Light. But hey, ""King of Beers""? Where do they get that nerve?"
"Budweiser pours crystal yellow, off white head that quickly disappears. I do not know what to say except, you should have one once in your life to remind you why brewers use real ingredients and pride in their products. This is default beer for beer ignorance."
"yeah it's mass marketed. it really doesnt look that great. smell is just below average. but man can you drink these. budweiser is what it is. it's not trying to impress anyone. it's just that beer, thay you and your friends are sharing pitchers of at the bar when 1am rolls around. couldn't think of a better beer to hoist in the air as neil diamond sings sweet caroline. budweiser isn't ground breaking, but it is good times and a way of american life."
"- Kind of a funky aftertaste... a little too light and almost a funky off fruity flavor... it's been years since I have had a bud... It's not horrible... but it's not that great either..."
"Budweiser is and always has been a staple of the American lifestyle. That said, I do not like the beer. The only time I drink it anymore is between shifts when I know there is nothing in the fridge at home. Steer clear if possible, but if you find yourself in one of those hole-in-the-wall joints, give the classic a try. The tequilla you ask? It does a great job of clearing the Bud out of your mouth, and enough will actually make you forget that you ever subjected yourself to to this dissappointingly lame brew."
"Overall, for its style I think its hard to beat. It is much less musty and malty than others of the style which I think makes it much more enjoyable."
"Like I said, not a beer conisseurs go to, but it's also not terrible."
"D: Nice beer for the style. Easy drinker, best when served cold. Not as bad as some people advocate. A least it is a real beer and not some watered down light beer."
"The Great American Lager, obsessed with destroying any other beer that does not look like urine, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space...."
"Needless to say, I am not a fan of Budweiser. The beer borders on exceptional in appearance, always clear and clean looking. That is the high point of this beer though. The aroma is sour. The taste is bland. The mouthfeel is like water and the beer to me is not to be classified as drinkable."
"So, there. My last review was reactionary. This one is fair. It'd be damn dishonest to say this is anywhere near the worst beer in the world. But it's not very good, even for what it tries to be."
"Why the ""King of Beers""? This is actually a quite poor beer. It smells like metallic, diluted corn/rice water. The taste is not much better. Way too much rice which compromises the taste (which there is little of). If you want a cheap beer in the ""big 3"" go with Miller High Life!"
"I understand that this is the king of beers and one of the best selling beers in the world. That being said, I did not really care for this beer. This beer was a little too light for my taste. There wasn't a lot of body. It had very little flavor. In fact, it just tasted like tap water. The alcohol was the only thing that reminded me I was drinking beer. With out a doubt, there are better beers out there. However, if someone were to offer me a bud, I wouldn't refuse. After all, that just wouldn't be good etiquette."
"My first beers were primarily foreign beers. That is, I never paid much attention to American ones. When I tried Budweiser, I was very impressed. I Think a lot of people on this website might be rating Bud low because they are beer snobs and know they have to because they have a reputation to uphold."
"Overall, a fair brew. Certainly doesn't live up to the name ""The Great American Lager", but at the same time I don't think this deserves a horrible rating as given by some."
"Better than some, but not really one I look forward to ever having again in this lifetime."
"D-well i don't like to admit it here but what the heck, i can drink this all night, i won't enjoy it as much as a real beer but whatever"
"BUT ENJOY RESPONSIBLY, I AM NOT LIABLE FOR YOUR BAD DECISIONS."
"D- Its average. Not the smoothest out there but goes down pretty easy."
"Overall this is a horrible beer. How the hell this is the most popular beer on earth is beyond me. Only way I'd drink this is if there was nothing else at a party. If there was wine or liquor, maybe I'd have some bud to end the night after getting wasted."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can with a born on date of 17Jun10-NA96. Budweiser is consistant and that's all one really needs to say about it. Straw yellow pour with quick fizzy head. Weak aroma of grains, adjuncts, and something vaguely reminiscent of hops. The taste is generally the same. Everyone here knows that this is not a craft beer but it does help wash down some chips and dip."
"Overall not a great drinkablilty brew. I actually tried and preferred bud lite to this because of it's smoother drink and lack of odd bitter flavor in the Bud?"
"OK to have with pizza or something I guess but not something I would reach for"
"Probably the best part about Budweiser is the fact you know it's going to taste the same no matter where you get it, and when."
"D- Not really anything going on here. Its everywhere so it must be drinkable."
"Pours a golden yellow color with very little head. Smells of cereal grain and booze. Tastes pretty much the same. A slight sweetness in addition to the other flavors. Mouthfeel was very thin. Drinkability is a joke."
"This is national Budweiser week according to my friend who is a beer rep for Anheuser Busch. I am reviewing this beer as a result. Drank straight from a bottle - no glass - as this is the most frequently used method of consumption. The beer is a light golden color with little to no head. Smells of grain with a hint of sweetness and beer for a lack of better description - this is what beer smells like. The taste is crisp and light with not much to offer. No hop flavor to speak of and a slight and ever fading malt character. This beer is easy drinking - as can be understood why its served to the masses. Not a brew I'd recommend for those seeking flavor, however this is an easy drinking beer that would not offend most - therefore leading to its obvious popularity."
"""Drinkability," I might add is more than likely the unconscious reaction of the body to try and wash away the slime feeling with the only nearby beverage with a sensation strong enough to take the mind off the nasty feeling."
"Overall, about what I expected but still a disappointment. It's just amazing how much of this stuff gets produced and consumed on a daily basis."
"Beer #5 in the Swill Tour 2010. It pours a clear pale jaundice topped by some healthy white suds. The nose is of puffed rice, tears, and crappy wheat. The taste is of orphans' disappointment on the days that potential parents come to browse the selection. It's just corny water. Damn. The body couldn't really be much lighter, with a light carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, this is really just corn-flavored rice-water, not really beer."
"D: At 5% I could drink the beer all day long. I'm not inclined to but in a pinch (or at $2 per pint), it's hard to pass up."
"It pours an super pale golden color. The smell is of corn and rice gone wrong. This incites beer pong memories of old. There is a vomit like wheat tone to it as well. I've had this before, but I believe the ignorance that I brought to drinking it allowed me to consume it. The taste isn't all of that wonderful but at least it's smooth. The crappiness of the hops do not do it too much justice, but it is sadly drinkable so I can't say too much bad about it. Eh, it's Budweiser."
"Let's be honest with ourselves here, this isn't beer genius. However, it is dependable and it certainly blows most of its brethren out of the water. If you're stuck at a party with no craft brew in sight, this is your back up."
"This is by far the best macro lager. I don't care what anybody says."
"Easy to drink, and reasonably tasty (if your fucked up)"
"the drinkabilty of this beer is good considering it's price -sure there are better beers out there -but then again you get what you pay for ."
"Drinkability- Due to it's low ABV you can knock back many of these and all you'd get was bored. It's relatively bland but it's kind of what you expect from Anheuser-Busch."
"Drinkability: this beer is technically drinkable, and I aim to drink the whole can out of fairness (or something). Still ... not an experience I'd relish repeating."
"At a pig roast and was one of two choices the other being Miller Lite. So, I cracked open an icy cold can. Super light straw color. Aroma of corn and additives. Taste was bland and watery compared to a real beer but not so offensive I suppose. The best thing about this King of Beers is the easy water-like drinkability when washing down barbecue."
"Had this many times in many of it's bottling/canning derivatives but tonight I'm having it on-tap at the local Round Table pizza with the company of a King Arthur Supreme. A 60 oz pitcher to share with my wife in 2 chilled mugs. Light and fizzy. Average on smell seems worse on taste. I've had this beer so many times but it seems to taste ""dirtier"" the more I drink it. The so called ""King of Beers"" but there are many better."
"Definitely should be reserved for gas station desperation purchases. But is always surprisingly decent. I had two Buds the other day; one was warm, the other cold. Obviously cold is better, but both were alright by me. Sometimes I get wrapped up in getting the ""good stuff"" and forget that the ""cheap stuff"" is often not too far behind. That being said, this beer does not look or smell impressive at all. Sometimes it does not really matter."
"This beer pours with a very clear straw colour and a head that lasts but 10n seconds with almost no further carbonation. It had very little smell. It has a fairly weak flavour but there is something there just before the aftertaste, although I'm not sure what. Drink this when you want to get drunk."
"Taste is mostly carbonation sting ending with some corn grain flavor. Doesn't feel or taste bad, but doesn't feel or taste good. It is drinkable like water is mindless - little flavor."
"D: Obviously this is not the ""King of Beers"". However, I don't think it's THAT bad. Don't get me wrong, I won't be buying 6 packs of Bud anytime soon. However, if served ice cold and in the proper social setting I won't refuse to drink a few of these. As far as American Adjuncts go, there are worse ones out there."
"A pale straw yellow with just a hint of orange near the top with a foamy, paper white head that rises quickly and falls to nothing. Corn and rice in the aroma with no semblance of hops. The flavor, or lack thereof, is more corn and rice and is extremely watered down. Carbonation is high and the finish is dry and crisp. A little bit of corn in the finish. This is just a boring beer. It's not as terrible as some of its counterparts, but it just does not impress by any stretch."
"This is not the worst thing ever. In its abomination of a beer style, I feel that Budweiser actually holds up pretty well. Don't get me wrong though - I never want to drink another one. But rating to style this is pretty OK."
"I did not rate this poorly because it is a corporate beer, it is just not a high caliber beer."
"Pours a straw yellow without small bubbly head that dissipates quick enough. No lacing at all. Has an almost metallic smell to it, with faint grainy aroma. I get that I'm supposed to rate to style, but this beer isn't tasty. It isn't the most horrible thing either. Carbonation very prickly, making the mouthfeel a bit harsh and made me want to stop drinking."
"Drinkability: This beer is highly drinkable and goes down easy. If your looking for a refreshing, drinkable beer, this is it. Would take it over Coors any day. Otherwise, stick with the craft brews for fuller flavor and body. Not saying that craft brews are not refreshing and drinkable, they definitely are, but just a little heavier. It also depends on the meal you wish to drink with."
"I dunno, gonna rate this to style as I have probaly had about ten thousand of these and think for AAL you really can't do much better. It doesn't smell offenseive. It looks ok. It tastes refreshing and clean. You can do ALOT worse than bud, lemme tell ya."
"drinkability: it is what it is. probably the beers best quality."
"Drinkability: Bud's drinkability is another one of its highlights. Its quite refreshing, mild, with an interesting blend of flavors that makes it refreshing on a warm day. It is an excellent choice to serve with salty snacks, or a BBQ meal."
"Well it's easy to drink, and does not leave a lot for your senses. This is actually the 3.5% version for the Swedish market, brewed in the UK. A bit less sweet/alcoholic than it's big brother."
"Not my favorite by any means. Just another cheap american beer. Heavily carbonated and not heavily flavored. Slightly watery when compared to fancier types, and the only thing that keeps this beer going is its connection to america and patriotism...."
"D- Meh. On tap it's not a terrible adjunct. Better than light beer. Average adjunct."
"Pale average color. Simple aroma of beer. Standard, run-of-the-mill favor. A plain simple beer for a regular workaday mood. I'd have to say this is a consistently brewed beer from which my relative tastes refer. When I feel like I don't want to notice much flavor from my beer this is my standby."
"Drinkability- I think this is horrible. Better than Bud Light but still a statement that they care more about marketing than their actual beer."
"I use to drink a lot of this stuff, but since they sold out to InBev I have for the most part abstained from purchasing this. It use to be my American mega-brewery, go-to beer in a can, but not anymore. Mostly I drink it for nostalgia sake. Anheuser-Bush is not an exclusively American controlled company anymore, so skip the ""All American"" patriotism talk! I drink this with a heavy heart - why couldn't AB remain American!?! WWWHHHYYY!!!"
"Libation: What is there to say? It's a standard macro adjunct lager. It's not good, and I will probably never drink it again."
"Soft light enough in the nose where rice is felt, as so often in American adjunct lagers. Quite mild in flavor, supported by a slight hop and not really exceptional. It offers a mouth where the average bitterness sounds a bit artificial when it is not simply non-existent, there is a small taste of the flavors of rice, but unfortunately no real appetite."
"Drinkability: This one tasted a bit too sweet, and I suspect that it's too old. Still, Budweiser is an alright macro beer and extremely drinkable. Far from a first choice, I don't mind getting this one from time to time for get togethers or just for the hell of it- it is what it is."
"D- might as well drink a water with lemon in it. Go to any restaurant and they'll give you water with lemon for free. I don't know why anyone would even drop a dime on this."
"I feel that this beer is worthy of respect but it is repellingly boring. When most individuals think of beer they think of Bud. This is the original and any beer drinker should have a sip of Budweiser. You won't be that impressed but you'll be happy to know that your beer tasting can only get better."
"Pours a ""cat piss"" yellow with a decent head which dissipates quickly. At first sip it taste like most pilsner style lagers. Has some sweetness, with moderate carbonation. It has some mild bitterness but nothing like an IPA. Overall this beer is not for the appreciative crowd and more for watching football, eating crawfish, or something to play beer pong with."
"This was America's beer before its lighter brother displaced it. It is a light yellow beer with a yeasty smell with hints of metal. The taste is overall of its principle ingredient rice. It is crisp to the tongue and leaves a slightly malty overtone as the aftertaste. See my review for Bud Light. It is made for the American working man at a middle pricing range. Great commercials but poor product overall."
"his lager should be appreciated for what it is...a clean, crisp, refreshing, brew that appeals to the masses and can be drank whenever and wherever. there are many other much better lagers and ales that appeal to those of us with discerning tastes and appreciation for REALLY good beer. but after a day of construction work in the sweltering summer heat, nothing beats an ice cold budweiser. just as during the shortest and coldest of days in winter sitting in my favorite pub, a pint of stout, porter or doppel bock is just what the doctor ordered."
"Drinkability is gonna have to be decent here-- If I were forced to pick a macro, this would be it."
"D - I really didn't want another."
"D: Its drinkable. But there is a lot better options out there. This is the ""fit in with the crowd", ""This taste so good after a long hot day"" or ""I don't know what you serve here so I will take a mug of Bud"" type of beer."
"Holding this beer up against any style of beer, even the lightest all-barley lagers out there, is unfair. For what Budweiser is, it is good. For my money, I will likely reach for something cheaper when in the market for this style."
"Drinkability- Everything about this beer is average. It's not particularly good, but it's not bottom-shelf either. If you want to drink a lot but avoid being labeled as a light-beer-drinking-pansy-ass, then Budweiser would work for you."
"Budweiser, the King of Hangovers. Something is not right with this beer, additive-wise, I suspect. Every time in my youthful past when I can remember getting drunk on this stuff I had horrible, brain squeezing hangovers. It's not total swill, but pretty close. The color, mouthfeel, and body are solid average. The flavor is sweet and salty, like Beer Nuts in liquid form. A bit of burnt, malty caramel and really no hint of hops at all. Sometimes you just end up drinking one of these, but you always ask yourself, ""Why?'"
"Big ups to beefytits below me!"
"I grew up on budweiser. I grew up getting drunk, a lot. But this beer just doesn't cut it anymore. It looks like beer.... it tastes like, alcoholic nothingness. Dismal taste bud stimulation. Absence of hops. I can't believe this is the ""heavy"" beer as appose to the ""budlight"". I am glad America no longer owns this company. It was embarrassing."
"Highly recommended... that you drink it as cold and fast as possible, if you find yourself in a position to drink it at all."
"D- Easy to drink, cheap for an import, totally uninteresting though."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer. I previously said that Coor Light was the best of the Big Brew beers--the kind you drink to get drunk rather than to enjoy. I'll hold to that, but I'll say if you need to get a Big Brew to drink, this might be the one to get!"
"Had a few cans left over from a work assignment and decided I should review one. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. It's really one of the worst looking beers I've tried certainly doesn't look like a ""king"" of any magnitude. Pale yellow that you can see straight through. There is a bubbly and fizzy head that goes away extreamly quickly, probably faster than any other beer I've had, includig Bud Light. There isn't much of a smell to it and what you can smell isn't that good. Smells like it's cheap and skunked. Despite not looking or smelling good, the taste isn't the worst thing in the world. It's certainly not a style that I'm a fan of but I'd say it's pretty average for an American Adjunct Lager. Has a grainy taste with maybe some rice, nothing about it is strong though, like the smell it tastes a little cheap, I wouldn't say they exactly use high quality ingredients. The moutnhfeel isn't that great, feels a bit watered down, not that drinkable either. No matter how hard they try, I can never consider this the ""King of Beers"" it's just too weak. It also makes me dissapointed to hear that this is the self proclaimed ""Great American Lager"" it's just a macro beer with great marketing and they got the mainstream to enjoy it. Good for them, but it's not for me."
"Overall, I will say that this beer is beer. It's nothing to jump about, but it's got something to offer."
"I dislike Bud and Bud light, but I like Bud more than Bud Light. Bud at least has some ""beer"" taste, not much but some. I have had this many times, I am not a fan. I will actually drink this, whereas, I wont even touch Bud Light. overall, not good. tastes chalky, but hey its the ""king of beer""."
"Bud is something to try when you cannot find a decent pilsner on the shelf, or when you need a break from Becks or Urquell (if only to be reminded how good those macros are)."
"My dad always drinks this beer when its BBQ time. And while I don't drink it often, it does compliment cook-out food quite well."
"D. This is only drinkable out of the can/bottle served super cold to cover up any discernible characteristics. Even then, I would grab for another macro lager before this."
"Budweiser has gotten a bad rep, and I do not think it is an outstanding beer. But as American macro lagers go it's a decent one."
"Dont get me wrong this is a good beer and everyone likes what they like for different reasons."
"D - Very high drinkability. Nothing that I would buy as it doesn't suit me, but when friends have it around I'll grab one. There's a reason why this is everyone's go-to beer."
"D - Tried ""The King"" to see if it was deserving of the crown. Should be called ""The Jester"". All that advertising and no taste. This one won't be back in the beer fridge again."
"drinkability? this review is the product of four or five big sips. im glad it didn't take more than that. i'll have a Torpedo now, por favor!"
"Not really much to offer with this, it tasted kind of skunky and I can't say I was pleased in any way with it."
"Drinkability - I wouldn't order a second one of these unless it's the only thing being served. And even then, I'd probably go with water instead."
"Beer is thin and watery. There is some faint alcohol in the front and some grainy bitterness in the back. It has some flavor unlike some of these things but just not enough to care a whole lot. Its not very good. Its not horrible though. Its completely drinkable and it is what it is. It mayonnaise of the beer world. Sure you may love wasabi, but sometime you may want something simple and bland. Here it is."
"d-great drinkability smooth with a clean aftertaste"
"D - Goes down easy... I wouldn't call it quaffable, but neither is it off putting in any way... Not something seek out, but also an passable offering when the pickings are slim... One of the better BMC products relative to its peers... Any sort of inviting aroma and this could be a respectable offering..."
"Overall: I know I could take flack for this review, but I'm gonna say it: Budweiser is a good beer. I've tasted bad beer...Keystone...Natty...Bud Light for crying out loud! Budweiser does not fit that category in my opinion and as such is my favorite American macro."
"Overall- There is nothing that stands out here, I have drank this stuff for years. This and high life are the only American MACRO lagers that I will even touch for weekends that I am a little light in the wallet."
"It's only real flaw is that it has absolutely no flavor."
"D: Obviously this is not the ""King of Beers"". However, I don't think it's THAT bad. Don't get me wrong, I won't be buying 6 packs of Bud anytime soon. However, if served ice cold and in the proper social setting I won't refuse to drink a few of these. As far as American Adjuncts go, there are far worse ones out there."
"Mouthfeel is very hmmm light and drinkability is pour away mate..."
"Never liked Bud when I drank just to get drunk in the 80's and early 90's. Still don't understand why people buy it. ( ok...cool commercials ) Very little taste, to carbonated...even for American Domestic beers. I would rather drink....well, just about anything."
"Keep this cold as possible and its not bad on a very hot day."
"Not the worst thing I have ever had. Which is the reason I am reviewing this. Still nothing I would drink other than at a baseball game (when nothing else is available), though one of the better versions for macro crap that I have had."
"Simply put: a very VERY bland beer without many redeeming qualities at all."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Beautiful beer to look at freshly poured. It has a nice head and is copiously carbonated with a crystal clear golden color. Consumption of this beer however is ill advised. This is usually the beer first consumed by beer newbs and quickly turns them off to the thought of drinking another beer. The people usually drinking Budweiser are the peopel looking for the cheapest brew and have no interest in paying more for something palatable. If consumed ice cold and not allowed to warm it could be used in emergency situations like in the Sahara deset or Death Valley where the other option is dehydration and death. Drinking this above 50 degree temps will make you gag. This beer is best left to frat boys and their parties. Still works good at getting chicks to get naked if you are on a budget."
"D: Low ABV, but the taste is so bad that one must only partake when absolutely no other option is available."
"Not very good. Would be easy to chug a lot of but that's about it. The corn ruins any chance it has of being enjoyable."
"D: This is one of the many ""Everyday"" beers that can be found everywhere"
"D: Pretty inoffensive, and as the dubious standard-bearer for American macros, it's pretty representative. Reasonably refreshing and mostly inoffensive, but this lacks character as well as flavor. I go back and forth on this one, but I'd take a High Life over this any day."
"Overall as I said it's pretty unoffensive, but really why bother when there are so many superior beer styles out there? I got this bottle for free, so I figured I'd review it."
"I just wanted to add that I was very surprised at how un-horrible the king of beers really is when I take an objective look at it. Budweiser is certainly a shallow blonde, but believe me, you can do a lot worse at your local gas station."
"If I'm going to drink BMC its going to be Budweiser. It's the best of the big 3 and the most distinctive flavor wise. It truly does taste like a lager, and a little bit of wheat hops and malt comes through in there, but none of them stand out. Just a classic American working man's beer. For all of us on Ba, it's just something our friends drink."
"Notes: Well pretty typical for the style, not great but not offensive at least. Ok as far as the style goes and has its situations which it would be drank at."
"RJT"
"For an American Macro lager, this one really does the trick. The beer is all about balance, as is other good Macro lagers. It's a tough world in the world of ML's, but the things a brewer needs to stand out just might be to alter the recipe a bit. Conventionally beer is made with barley right? So they took this one, put some rice in there instead and out came this really drinkable, tasty macro lager that has done the trick for many people mowing the lawn on a hot day. It's a cut above what one would usually drink on a hot day. Great session beer too."
"D - I can drink Budweiser all day if I wanted too. Very light and refreshing, crisp, very enjoyable on a hot summer day and for hanging out with some friends watching some sports."
"Overall, one of the smoother American macros that does the trick on a budge t but does not fulfill my hophead needs."
"D: I can drink a lot of this beer and I will. This beer isn't my ideal beer, but it's good for what it is."
"D: I still think Budweiser is yucky."
"Very easy to drink, though I'll admit my taste buds begin to get bored after 3 or 4. Not nasty like some adjunct lagers, and it's a good ""warm up"" beer...in fact, I have a Black Butte XXI waiting in the wings."
"Avoid."
"Poured from a 24 ounce can with born on date of August 09. Would this have been best within 110 probably not. Clear golden straw color. Scent of fresh cut grass. Basic lager flavor one that I have known for years. So for that I give Bud props same taste can, bottle or tap. Other than that no special yeast, or hops flavors. Drinkable nature is great, goes down easy till you get a headache next day."
"As with everything else the mouthfeel is still in the ""watery"" catagory. Its too light and from the pour I guess, unusually flatter than I remember. Guess its not meant to be poured from a can? I would have on tap if there was nothing else, but never from a can again (Though I have had 1,000s) haha. I would def. get Shiner, Sam Adams, practically anything over Budweiser. Either way avoid this mega-giant sponsored beer, there is so much great beer out there, and this is far from one. ""King of Beers"" ?? Makes me laugh."
"Like it or not it's an American staple. For the record, many people in Europe drink this trash as well. It meets a need. That need is not flavor. It's smooth and that's about it."
"I end up having this beer sometimes at bars where the only choice is Budweiser, Heineken and Stella and the budweiser is the cheapest of the bunch. It is not a good beer but I have to say it isn't totally terrible. It does have a definite pilsner character about it and if you're already resigned to bad beer, I say go ahead and try one."
"It had been a long time since I last tried Bud, and I have became much more educated on beer since then. I was amazed at how listless this was compared to the really good beers I have had. Not what I'd describe as terrible, but just bland. Nothing stood out at all. Strictly for those who have no clue what a good beer is."
"Not like it induces a gag reflex or anything, but there are so few characteristics of this beer to bring me back that I'll pass until the next one comes along for free. I'd rather pay much less for a better beer in PBR. Or drink just a great lager with Full Sail's Session Lager."
"D- This has great drinkability. A low enough ABV makes this a very sessionable beer. I didn't mind the couple glasses I had of it but I wouldn't buy it as a regular. Favorite out of the big three. Would still rather just have a PBR if given the choice out of the style."
"D- Hardly any alcohol. Hardly any flavor. Hardly any body. Whats not drinkable about it?"
"Poured into a pint glass. This leaves 1/2"" of bubbly white head that dissipates quickly. Golden color with astounding clarity. Not much smell, a little bit of yeast, mostly rice. Taste is a perfectly clean traditional American lager. What I think sets Bud apart from others is the huge banana taste I get from it. I think it's interesting that more people don't comment on that, it seems so blatantly clear to me. Comes from that very present yeast character I guess. Feels a bit over-carbonated but drinkability is certainly fine. This and Coors Original are my two go-tos when I want a cheap American lager beer on hand. After this case though I think I'll go back to Coors, that's just a little better in my opinion."
"its amazing how consistent they make these beers. truly remarkable. the whole shtick is the same: lousy head retention, poor nose (no smell really whatsoever), feel is like seltzer, the d-bility is for frat bros only. the colour is perhaps a bit more golden, but not so much that I remember a distinct difference."
"D: won't be seeking this out, but I had to give it a fair chance and review it. :)"
"It is a true american beer with a rich yellow color and a great taste. You can really taste the hops which some would disagree but hey that is an opinion right? Anyway the smell is above average the taste is good and the mouthfeel is pretty good also. Drinkability is defintley good is a smooth beer with a nice abv%. Like I say it is a true american beer."
"Cheers!"
"Very light hop aroma which is difficult to detect. Something makes me think Czech, probably Saaz hops. Bright yellow color with a pure white head that vanishes quickly. Tastes of corn and rice. Quite bland but refreshing and contains no offensive elements. Thin and fizzy. Finishes crisp and dry. Far from a premium beer but it's probably the best of the big American lagers. Cheap and easy to find."
"why is this not served on nitro? i mean, at least occasionally."
"Served from a bottle as a 2 for 1 at happy hour. No glass to pour this into, but from memory, it pours yellow and looks like a standard adjunct lager, not bad, not impressive. Smell is pretty poor, as even this fresh Budweiser smells a bit skunky. Taste is a bit watery with some malt and corn coming through. Mouthfeel is fine and not heavy. Drinkability is fine outside of the poor taste."
"It's obviously one of the most popular beers in the United States, very drinkable, but not a great beer. This beer is for one purpose, to get drunk. Budweiser is one of those beers that is good for tail-gating, and back yard barbecues and such, and is very convenient. This beer does have it's place but is unfortunately the most popular. Also, this beer distracts people from buying better beers, which are more expensive, but obviously better. This is a decent beer for it's purpose, but again, it sucks."
"Budweiser: King of Rice!"
"D: I can't say Bud in a can is much different than Bud in a bottle. But Anheuser-Busch has the taste of Budweiser homogenized pretty much everywhere, so it doesn't really matter how you drink it; it all tastes about the same."
"Overall this beer is good. Anyone can drink it. It dosent have any distinct features that someone would be picky about and not like."
"Bud is to beer what Old Navy is to clothing. Sometimes you just want to skip the shower, pull on some $4 cargos and a $2 wife-beater, drop your ass on the couch and work through 12 of these. The good thing is, Bud will always be there for you."
"I'm not a fan of Bud ""Heavy."" I don't care for the smell, taste, and quite honestly don't find it easy to drink. The only thing about this beer that is redeeming is the container. The Bud can/bottle/label is a classic icon. Every American should probably try a Budweiser at some point, but it's just not a beer for me."
"I am not going to do a traditional review of this beer, just about everything has already been said. These iconic red and white cans have sat in the bottom of my parents refrigerator since before I was born, but I have to admit that they have no place in my mine. This was the beer that made me hate beer, but it was also the first beer I've ever tasted. I always hated the flavor of this beer, but grew into accepting it. If it weren't for this beer turning me off of beer in general, I would of gotten into beer a long time ago. All this aside, today, I can drink a Bud and appreciate it for what it is. This beer is America, it embodies everything that made this country successful on a world stage: it is low priced, highly available, has great marketing and an almost iconic image, very consistent despite its mass production, and finally strikes a balance between using the cheapest possible ingredients and still making a drinkable product. In other words, our culture in a can. Drink up."
"This is your basic American beer. It is easy to drink, and is somewhat smooth. But, there really is no flavor. Once the beer is poured into a glass, the thin white head fizzles out leaving an almost stale taste. Maybe a hint of cooked vegetables. Nice to have on a hot day, but not recommended."
"If this beer is the king, it most certainly is a usurper."
"I won't be able to finish it and only used 6-8 ounces for the chicken. Hopefully, as it bakes, I'll be able to use the rest in the pot. WOW."
"they only thing i can say for this beer is its cheap and can do down easily so you can get drunk with it. other then that it really is just a mediocre beer as far as market beers go. if you want a tasty beer then i suggest you go out and try different ones then this brand, it is a self proclaimed king of beers"
"Overall, I choked this one down. No flavor whatsoever. Aftertaste is mild and fairly bland. Sit around the campfire and get hammed beer. There are some shitty macros out there, and most beat this beer. This is probalby the last one of these I have in my lifetime."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Smooth mouthfeel, nice carbonation. A pretty drinkable summer beer for me."
"Pours a pale straw yellow with a thin white head that fades quickly, leaving nothing behind. Aroma is minimal - maybe some grainy scents. Taste is much of the same. Very muted. As it warms, you can catch the malty notes. There's no bitterness at all here. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and abundant carbonation. All in all it leads to an uninteresting, yet drinkable brew."
"Overall, this is not the king of beers as most would suspect. I didn't enjoy this at all. Not something I want to pay for, that is for sure."
"Pretty highly carbonated and watery."
"Drinkability: By no means a good beer, but among the ""big three," the best in my opinion."
"I can think of plenty of other beers at a similar pricepoint that are equally as easy to drink but that offer so much more. This beer deserves the bad rap it gets around here."
"Overall... just avoid. There are better American Adjuncts out there."
"Drinkability is that oft debated term, meaning different things to different people. I say that this beer is easy to drink, while being far from good-tasting. I don't know how that is exactly--you figure that you'd have to truly enjoy something to drink it--but Bud has so little character, it is an easy and disgusting swill."
"Drinkability: personally I feel this style is one that has poor flavored beers, and this one may be a bit better than some others out there. I had a hard time finishing the bottle, but I can see why some chug this light flavored beer."
"Typical American adjunct look and smell; pale yellow with a white fizzy head, lots of carbonation, smells of grains and metal. Tastes about the same, watered down grainy taste with a slight metallic finish. Lots of carbonation to make up for all that is lacking. If nothing else, bud diesels are drinkable. Not my go to cheap beer by any means, though, PBR holds that place in my heart."
"Budweiser is a great beer for what it is. Definetly not for beer snobs, but sometimes i think people bash it just for being so popular and because it comes from a huge corporation. So what? Sure, theres a time and place for a good pale ale,dopplebock ipa or stout,but there are times i really crave a good American macro. Open your minds,people!"
"Overall it is what I expected it to be. I consumed this beer a bit warmer than suggested - which did not help the drinkability."
"All in all a terrible macro thats probably not worth drinking. Has a bad combo of bad taste and a few too many calories."
"OK mouthfeel, drinkable in the sense it is balanced, that's about it. In a pinch, take this over Miller."
"Alright, here's the disclaimer. Before getting into craft beers I was a Bud drinker. I haven't had one for about a year and decided to buy one for reviewing purposes. I know its popular to bash the BMC's, but IMO, Budweiser is decent for a lager."
"Budweiser American Lager makes a thin pinky sized head that vanishes quickly without a trace. There is very little lacing, and... This beer is a total fail. There are no fragrances I detect, and the taste is of corn and booty. This is okay for mindless partying and working in the yard, but yields no respect at my dinner table."
"One of my first beers, ever, and thought it was good then. But my taste buds grew up and now I will only drink this if there is nothing else available. It will do in a pinch, but considering how tasteless this is, I will choose a craft brew any day over this."
"O: Not ""The King"" of beers by any stretch of the imagination. I honestly prefer Miller Lite over this. I had forgot how bad this beer can be. Lowest rating I've given to date."
"D: Well, it's drinkable, but so is water; this beer doesn't offend like may others, so for it's style, you can handle it; like most people on this website, I'm not a huge fan of this style, but on a hot day, this beer goes down easily and, although watery, doesn't kill the taste buds."
"D-If i could stand the taste and smell i would find this beer highly drinkable, its the closest you can get to drinking water without REALLY drinking water. I had 3 at the party and felt full from all the cheap filler this beer has in it. I wont be buying this but if its offered i wont turn it down."
"D: The drinkability of this beer is in the sense of the ability to drink massive amounts of it. The taste is incredibly bland, and that's the point, unfortunately."
"Pours a bright golden yellow with bubbly carbonation, frothy white head. Minimal retention and lacing. Smell is standard watery, light adjunct and light grain wih hints of sulfur. Taste follows smell with a watery blend of adjuncts, grain and a minor sulfury taste. Light bodied, thin and watery, over carbonated. Its drinkable, yes, because it only has a minimal amount of ""of tastes", just too light to be enjoyable."
"Overall meh..."
"Lost this review, the words at least. Remember the rating and the overall review well. Poured a clear golden color with a head that disappears completely from the beer and leaves no lacing. Smell and taste are of watery malts, only points given are in comparison of much worse Adjunct Lagers I have had. The malt backbone is better than some other Adjuncts I have had. The mouthfeel of this was not too bad, a pretty decent body with smooth carbonation, best aspect of the beer. Drinkability is weird. I could drink a ton of these but at the same time they taste so bad that I would not want to. The price is very good but the quality is not."
"A side note... Budweiser gives me a SCREAMING headache whenever I drink it. I think Bud is about as average as you can get. It's made for mass consumption and designed to be everything to everyone. Appearence is average, a little bit light but golden. Good head, smell is a little malty and crisp. Taste is completely unremarkable, not too bad but not very good. Given the headache factor, I avoid Bud at all cost. Even so, it's sort of bland and basic so I wouldn't choose it anyway."
"Overall, a beer meant for really hot days when you will be consuming large quantities very rapidly."
"The taste is light hops, mostly watery. Mouthfeel is non-existent. On the bright side you crush about 20 of these and keep drinking."
"Wouldn't recommend it. If you want an Amer. Adjunct Lager, buy Coors."
"Cheers!"
"not something I would suggest you drink, but its hard too avoid forever"
"Easy to drink, this is The King Of Beers like McDonalds is the King Of Food. Everywhere, cheap, and processed."
"The beer pours a bright straw color with a fluffy white head from the can. It smells of grains. It doesn't have much taste, but it is crisp with a strong bite of carbonation. It finishes clean, and I could drink these. all day, not that I would want to."
"Overall - This is a pretty standard marco-lager, in case you were curious. It's not bad, but it's not great either. There are several better options out there if you like marco-lager. It's still better than the really bad stuff though, such as Natty Ice or Milwaukee's best."
"I poured into a nonic fresh out of the tap to a large, white, foamy head. It is yellow and clear. As with most macros it has a sweet smell to it. It actually tastes good after mowing the lawn and needing a drink of water. Macros get a bad rap by beer snobs. It is what it is. A tasteless alcoholic beverage for the masses. I keep it on tap because my keg fridge only holds 1/4 barrels, so my options are limited here in BFE. It'll wet my whistle."
"Overall, I don't find it enjoyable or good, but I don't find it off-putting."
"Bottom line, take even the most pedestrian craft lager and put it up against this - it will taste like Westy 12 by comparison. I think I even prefer Bud Light to this."
"D: I'm not into adjunct lagers, but this is the least bad I've had."
"i'm sure i will be subjected to this beer again at some point"
"D: I just might be able to finish this, but I don't see the point. While not offensive, like most macros, I'd rather drink water."
"12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Very clear pale straw color, small white head quickly dissipates. Smell is corny adjunct, grain. Taste is thin, carbonated water, sweet adjunct flavoring. Bad aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Its drinkable because its so thin like water, but the taste is so bland its just bad bad."
"D: This is a Budweiser, what is there to say. It is what it is. Everyone has had one, and everyone know what they taste like. One hot day, after mowing the lawn, I could drink a few of these, but that about it."
"Pale straw body with a finger of poorly retained head. It smells faintly of corn and cooked grain. It tastes mildly sweet with a hint of grass. Faint ""green beer"" character. It isn't offensive, it's just extremely bland. It's thin and watery with active carbonation. I would prefer something more flavourful, but I could probably have a few of these on a hot day, if offered."
"Notes: As expected not a great beer. We've all had a bud and while I wouldn't recommend it as a beer to try for its wonderful flavor, it isn't so terrible that I can't have one or two if someone offers me one at a party or something."
" While at your local grocery store, please save yourself some time and pain by avoiding Budweiser."
"D: Had easier to drink adjunct lagers."
"It is what it is. Going solely off the style, I've had plenty that are worse. Nice for yard work, golfing, or beer pong. Tastes the same from 1st to last. OK, that part was basically cut and pasted from my Bud Light review. I actually like the taste and smell of Bud heavy a little more. I'd rather have this than some of the pseudo micros trying to be something they are not."
"Overall- Its not terrible. It just doesn't have any real taste."
"There is nothing remarkable about this beer except that it is so extraordinarily popular."
"okay..reviewing this beer is kind of tough because pre BA I was a fan of this beer because it was an American Institution that was available in India, and post BA..the attitude towards this beer (BMC in general) has changed my perception, at least I would like to think so. Frankly, this beer is a above average lager, good for binging or speed drinking. Very average in terms of appearance & smell. Great drinkability and good taste, I mean there is nothing offensive about it. If you want to enjoy an ice cold beer without much want of depth, Bud's gotta be the choice."
"Bottom line-- If they were all 99 cents, I'd go for the Bud. (mind you, this would be the day before pay day). But in this adjunct big beer category 2% more of taste at 30% more cost means squat."
"This will never be in the catagory of Stone or Sam Adams, but Bud is what it is and that's why they sell so much. It is sort of a base line, anything worse than this is a bad beer and anything better is an alright to good beer."
"D: very drinkable when near frozen, gets worse as it warms up. great for hot summer day."
"That said I still can't give it much of a rating, as you can grab a 1000 other beers that just taste better."
"Avoid when possible, but there are worse out there."
"Drinkability- I only give this okay rating at all because water is pretty drinkable, man this is a rough one, not trying to be hard on this but you drink some good belgians and try this and you want to cry, run while you"
"So in conclusion, if you're looking for a decent American Adjunct Lager to drink during a game, a movie, or even with dinner without breaking the bank, Budweiser might be an option to consider. If you're looking for robust flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel seek something a bit heavier and more exotic. All in all a good beer that is light and easy to drink. If you're ion college and have the cash, get this instead of Natural Ice. You're friends/party guests will thank you for it."
"Drinkability - with this beer drinkability is king. Easy to put away many."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Pours a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of corn, fairly mild. Taste is crisp, some malts, fairly refreshing, a touch of bitterness at the finish.. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a pretty mediocre offering."
"I have been to a couple Budweiser promos and I have to say that they do a good job in presenting their beer. Compared to some typical heavy micro/craft ales (which I do love, btw), Budweiser is a flavorless beer. But compared to other lagers in its class, it is actually an exceptional example of craftsmanship. The quality and consistency is excellent, and when you pour it ""right down teh middle", the head retention is surprising. They served this side by side with Yuengling Lager and I was amazed by the difference. Bud doesn't have any corn in it, which gives Yuengling, and most other macros, their typical frathouse stink. What I also noticed is that Bud uses a very clean tasting yeast that leaves no hint of character. Yuengling on the other hand, had a surprisingly perceptible spicy bavarian note that I usually get from a traditional Bock (and I will admit I only managed to notice in the bland environment of a budweiser tasting). Head to head, the Yuengling actually came off as offensive, a shrewd tactic on AB's part. Cleanliness was a good thing for what I expect from Budweiser, though. Amidst the ""subtelty"" of the light malt and rice and barely perceptible hops, a flavorful yeast would just not fit in. If you view Budweiser as the delicate beer that it is, the result is actually a well-balanced, refreshing light lager. I wouldn't pair it with food, since it wouldn't even support a sauteed white fish, but I do enjoy it on a hot summer day, when thirst quenching is the chief concern. It is what it is."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a small head. The aroma is of grains with a slight hint of hops to it. The overall taste is of grain and an ever so slightly hop taste. The mouthfeel is moderate carbonation and dryer than most american adjuncts. The drinkability is higher than most in this class, you could have a couple of them."
"Notes: Can be refreshing on a hot summer day only if served ice-cold."
"I'm not a big fan of Budweiser but I must say that I tend to drink a lot of it as that is what tends to be offered parties. Had some most recently at my buddy's ""American Lager Challenge"" Beer pong tourney and must say that the beer continues to not impress. It is just bad. I guess I would drink it if water wasn't available."
"I truly dislike that this is what 90% of the world thinks is true beer. I know I shouldn't judge this beer because of who made it, but when you spend that much money of PAC's to keep control of the market, sorry your product is not worthy."
"Typicle american beer. Not that impressed. Good beer if you are deinking all day in the sun or at an outdoor concert. other than that let the frat boys keep it!"
"This beer is not awful but it is not good either. If use to be better, I think, back in the days before aluminum cans and pull up tabs. But times change and so have some folks' tastes. Beer is fizzy and gives a good head and that is about the only good quality it has."
"Disgusting. Just horrible. I would never drink that stuff again. Its piss colored water and alcohol. Smelled of adjuncts and other nasty stuff. Tasted all wrong. I never want to go near this ever again. This is certainly not the King of Beers. That would be Westvleteren 12, thank you very much."
"Out of a can this iconic beer was a straw gold color with lots of rising carbonation. The head was a billowing, out of control mass though the retention was only decent as a layer and the lacing so-so. The aroma was stale and macro-grain dominated with a hint of sweet malt. The flavors were similar; crisp, classic and refreshing. The mouthfeel was rather rough, the body medium and the carbonation medium-high. As it warmed up the macro-grain flavor became more intrusive and took a lot away from it. But the so-called ""King of Beers"" does still have a place in the world of quality brew when served ice cold."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability: It's weak, but it tastes pretty bad. Even for very little money there are way better options."
"i could down a lot of these."
"I drank Bud for the first time in the early 80's and my reaction was pretty simply, if this is what beer tastes like then I do not like it! Thank God for imports and microbrews which introduced me to real beer. The flavor notes are bitter and rotten and that is about the best I can say for it. The aftertaste is simply awful with no redeeming characteristics other than poor flavor. How on earth Anheiser Busch sells millions of gallons of this garbage every year is beyond me, it aint' even that cheap!"
"D- It is what it is. Easily drinkable with a bland flavor. Not something I will be picking up often."
"dont spend your own hard earned money on this mass-marketed product."
"Overall: Overhyped, and overpriced when compared to the competiton -- especially Miller High Life and Old Milwaukee. King of Beers? Maybe, but probably not."
"Great beer to throw down on a hot day though."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and easy to slam, but would rather have so many other beers."
"The label states it's made with hops, rice and barley malt, so I guess the rice takes over as there is only a hint of malt in each sip. It's dull to me and feels like drinking a watered down beer after indulging in IPA's, stouts and Belgians for the past few years. Too bland for my liking, although the masses enjoy it."
"Lively carbonation attacks my tongue. Appropriately thin bodied."
"D = These I could slug back wholesale. It is my favorite ""drunken softball playing"" drink. I'll take one in the absence of any real beer."
"D- Great beer for sporting events, meals, or other times for general enjoyment. Definitely a classic."
"Drinkability: It would be pretty good with food, but it is nothing fantastic."
"It's not a chore to drink, but not one I'd recommend either. Moderately refreshing, drinkable due to its lack of flavour and clean, crisp palate."
"-RR"
"Taste starts as moderately unimpressive and contrives to go rapidly downhill from there. Front palate is watery and weak with slight, minimal hoppy undertones, then overtaken by a bitter chemical flavour, quite insipid and metallic. Finish is dreadful with a cloying bread yeast character killing off any drinkability this beer may have gained from being otherwise so flavourless. Just tastes like so many other adjunct lagers, and with a very poor profile to make it stand out as a particularly offensive one. Mouthfeel so thin it's like licking the inside of a vacuum tube. None of the bubbles promised on the pour. A distasteful drop, this. Weak and unpleasant. But then, I must be mistaken - how could a million rednecks worldwide be wrong?"
"Had on tap after a Rolling Rock. Smells faintly of some grains, and maybe a bit of corn. Pours a golden yellow with no real head. Tastes fairly clean with some grainy sweetness and a fairly clean finish. There's a good amount of carbonation. Not too bad on tap. I've always thought this was a good beer for what it is, but there are cheaper alternatives if this is what you were going for."
"The verdict: Looks like beer, smells like beer, and tastes like beer."
"Cheers :D"
"what more can you say about plain old budweiser, boring, lame fall back cheap beer. my uncles and my grandpa drink this stuff. i am not a fan by any means but i will not turn down an ice cold budweiser from a bottle or a can.... i guess its refreshing on a hot day"
"All in all, very drinkable. It doesn't have the sour aftertaste of other macro lagers which leave a sick feeling in my stomach. It's very balanced and a thirst-quencher. In that regard, it IS the quintessential brew of its style."
"One of the most drinkable beers there is. First beer I ever drank as a an under-age drinker so it has a special place for me. Not great but not horrible. The one beer that is served at every ballpark and stadium in america...so just accept it!"
" When consumed ice cold, flavors and aroma matter little and that's the way this beer needs to be consumed. Ya"
"D: You could drink this but the question is why would you with so many options that are better?"
"This beer poured a light yellow with a big fluffy head that only lasted second and a lot of visible carbonation. The smell is slight malt and some grain. The taste is real simple with a bit of malt and then a crisp finish. That's about it, I'm not sure what the hell happened to the ""choicest hops"" that they talk about on the outside of the 40oz., but I'm not tasting them. The mouthfeel is watery but has enough carbonation to make it crisp, as a good macrobrew should. This is indeed drinkable, and nothing can take that away from it. The undisputed king of mediocrity in beers."
"By the way, I hope the label of Budweiser being a ""hick beer"" subsides in the near future. It's not a bad lager at all, especially since no other lager goes through the same process as this one does, to my knowledge anyway."
"D: Not nearly as bad as I thought. It turns out Bud needs 10 years."
"Sometimes you just don't want something too complicated, and Budweiser fits the bill perfect."
"Drinkability - Overall, I wasn't too impressed. I got what I paid for."
"I really don't think this is a horrible beer. I've had much worse."
"D: When I set out to review this, I was all set to sample it with an open mind and take all the BAs to task for unfairly dumping on it because of its popularity and accessibility. But after seriously examining it, I can unequivocally say that it really is that bad. If I were judging a BJCP competition and this were an entry in the Standard American Lager Category, I'd give it a gold medal. But that only makes it the tallest pygmy. If you're too old for beer pong, stay far away."
"If this beer is the ""king of beers," then Don King is the king of dons and Burger King is the king of burgers. Back to real beers for me."
"dont hate the player, hate the game. just because its the most popular macro doesnt make it a horrible beer. in fact, its pretty consistent and theres really not many bad elements to complain about from a bud. but ofcourse it is hard to complain about things that dont exist, and in so many areas, bud is just not there. nonetheless, a clean, crisp refreshing brew."
"Like everyone else, I have had this beer in every possible way it is to have. Sure, it is not the most flavorful, colorful or have an outstanding appearance. What it is is consistent. No matter where you have a Budweiser you know exactly what you are going to get. And they take quality VERY serious."
"D: As far as I'm concerned, by far the best of the macros, which doesn't say much. Luckily there's Yuengling on the East Coast for desperate situations."
"Drinkable, it is. Not a bad option at all on a warm day or at a sports game."
" this beer gets far less credit than it should on BA."
"I'm through giving opinions on adjunct flavors. Unless I have the grain bill in my hand. Because, I have had pils and dort exports that taste WAY more like corn than this. However, they have WAY more flavor than this."
"Note that I've taken the liberty of reviewing this as an ""American Adjunct Lager"" rather than as an IPA, as some others seem to enjoy doing. It is a world-class example of its style."
"i decide to be fair an try this beer, for me is another one to add to the list of lawn mower beers."
"Would I reach for one of these when I really want a good beer, no; would I reach for one of these when I want a beer, yes."
"D: it would be very easy to knock out a pitcher of Bud with out noticing, but it leaves quite a bit wanting"
"All in all, while I would never consider drinking a BMC light, I may actually take one of these if it was handed to me."
"It is what it is. An average beer, always available, and at an affordable price. When I have to go macro, I go Budweiser."
"Best way to describe this beer, Victory Beer to reference Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four..."
"D- I like this out of a can better than from the tap and I can drink a few. Light on alcohol and flavors make for a simple refreshing drink year round and especially in the summer. This one beats out the other macro products simply cause I can stand to drink it at times, out of a can though."
"D: Very drinkable, it is what is says it is, that being the beer that the typical American beer drinker is looking for. It won't win any competitions, but I'll be drinking more in the future."
"Budweiser introduced the born on date, and they are genuinely committed to producing a quality product. Too bad they sold out to In Bev."
"D: Ah, drinkability. For some reason I saw this in a commercial. While the taste is not perfect, I'll be damned if I didn't just drink a few of these things working on the review. Easy to drink, nothing very strong or flavorful here, but not exactly water either. Nowhere near among my top preferences for a session beer, but easy drinking. I have to say this of course is an adjunct lager and I have to scoff at the BA member overall score of a D+... this is not a ""great American"" beer but is decent enough. And for the record I am not one of those noveau BMC apologists that populate BA recently. I offer no excuses of ""quality control"" just an honest opinion that this beer will not kill your children."
"It might not be the worlds greatest beer, but it certainly does the trick. On long hot summer days I can't think of a better way to relax than with a nice cold budweiser. It's highly drinkable and it tastes better than the other American macros. If you don't feel like spending a whole lot of money on imports this is a solid choice."
"Pours a golden body with a large white head. Smell is very malty with strong grain and some hops. Taste is about the same but has more boldness than I expected. Mouthfeel is standard. well carbonated and as drinkable as any other beer of the style but still better tasting than most."
"this beer is not my favorite.. looks like pee its very yellow ..light head..not impressed.. smells of lil grain, rice and thats about it nothing to go wow over.. taste is average like any other beer out there on mainstream.. bnut it doese give you a nasty headache in the morning"
"I don't think this beer is ""the king of beers"""
"For all the hate this beer gets, it isn't really that it's bad. It's more that it isn't good... really, it isn't anything much at all."
"Had it on Dollar Draft Nights back in the States. Its a standby for sporting events and for case sales."
"Pours a transparent yellow. Decent head present, but the bubbles are too large for it to stick around any. Smells slightly hoppy I suppose. Not much of the malts. Good carbonation."
"This is the King of Beers.... we all started here so you cannot knock this beer to badly...."
"Pours a pale cllear golden wit a thin white head. Smell is almost non-existent, a hint of corn. taste is very bland, a hint of malt, sour apples and corn. A touch of hop bitterness can be detected as well.. Mouthfeeli is watery, too much carbonation. Somewhat drinkable due to its very light flavor profile. I would only drink this again if given to me, i would not purchase it."
"D - not bad for the style. it's definitely the most drinkable beer within the style."
"Light, golden color, bubbling with carbonation, small head but some lacing. More respectable than the Light, by a lot, but not my choice. Flavor was crisp and uniform, bitter finish. Easy to see why it is so popular, very easy to drink and refreshing when ice cold. Won't be keeping it around but I don't mind it either."
"Poured into straight pint glass. Poured a bright, clear yellow with a foamy white head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. Slightly sweet aroma with nothing standing out. A balanced flavor that doesn't feature any one aspect of the beer. Smooth but thin body. Very drinkable, as in goes down quickly and easily. This beer is the standard of the style, the one one you judge others against. There are versions of this style out there that are more flavorful and enjoyable, as well as versions that are much, much worse."
"D 3.5 - like it for an AB macro, kinda light for a regular lager though, would drink it over most macro products if it's the only option, I kind of prefer it in the can for southern memories..."
"Pale yellow and clear as a bell with a quick fading fluffy white head. Smells faintly of corn grits and cereal grain. Tastes fairly sweet and clean with rice and corn being the standout flavors. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, finishes squeaky clean (must be the beechwood aging!) and is not entirely unpleasant. Always refreshes at the ballgame out of a plastic cup, good with a hotdog etc."
"It actually tastes and look like a beer. it pours very well and carries a decent ABV of 5% for a general beer."
"Light mouthfeel, a bit watery with a lot of carbonation. I'll only drink this if I find myself in a setting where this is the best anyone can offer me, but for what it is its alright. King of beers? Not a chance. But king of macros is pretty believable so I'll at least give it that credit rather than completely bash it."
"As far as macros go this is my favorite of them all, my go to beer when having to drink cheap and I know I can get it most anywhere I go. Pours a light clear stale golden yellow color pretty average but not awful. Not much of an impressive aroma which I guess is expected. As far as taste goes it's crisp and refreshing, obviously not a whole lot going on but that's to be expected for what it's for. Has a somewhat thin mouthfeel but in this case I don't think it really matters. I find this beer rather refreshing and I enjoy it. Like I said earlier it's my favorite of the macros and really it isn't all that bad. Not as much flavor as many others but for appealing to the masses and trying to be a nice refreshing beer it does it's job nicely."
"Drinkability: For the style this is above average and I have graded to that standard. This is probably the macro I reach for at parties. It is also something you won't ever see me buy except at a sporting event..For the style, I would think B+...overall a generous C- or D+"
"This stuff is served everywhere,so i'm sure i'll have it again eventually,but not looking forward to it."
"Appearance is a light golden yellow with a crisp fizzy head that dissapates quickly. Smell and taste take me back to my high school days, yet different (maybe because it's in a glass and not a can or plastic cup) with a light corn maltiness that is crisp with a good amount of carbonation leaving an acrid bitterness in the aftertaste. Actually the first few sips were not that bad, but about half way through my 32oz bottle it's getting hard to finish."
"My first beer and still one of my favorites. It is good at what is does which is a cheap mass produced beer. Very consistent and I can drink a good number of these and feel very refreshed. Great at backyard barbecues. Not very strong or overpowering but still has just just a hint of spice"
"i bought this for the super bowl. what was i thinking. it took me until today to finish this off. budweiser works really well in beer bread recipes. so do any beer, good or not. if you are going to drink this, make sure it is at least draft or bottle!"
"Light bodied and extremely drinkable. Absolutely nothing offensive or outstanding enough to distract you from slamming it down. Probably the ultimate session brew and goes well with practically any food."
"Hands down the best American Macro Beer out there. Good in any serving type, can, bottle, and tap. Appearance crystal clear golden color with a head that lasts a few minutes. Smells like a beer should. Taste, smooth pure and very clean. Mouthfeel and drinkability are exceptional, best in class and I would say best in the industry. You can never go wrong when ordering a Budweiser. This is America's beer drinking beer. It may not be the most complex or have the best palate presentation, or offer a fruity or nutty flavor, but who would want that flavor if they were actually considering buying an American Macro Beer in the first place?"
"I think I read on the label that no other beer is as expensive to brew as this one... Must be REALLY outdated"
"Very good offering within its category. As long as I don't have more than a few of these, all the world is okay. Good color, decent lacing for mass-produced beer. A good lager, enjoyable after a day's work out of a pint glass. Slightly bitter and dry. Really there is no other beer that tastes quite like it. Instead of slamming it like most others feel like they have to, I'm going to give it a thumbs up - Cheers to the King!"
"Drinkability: like all macros, this is inoffensive enough to be drinkable. But there's nothing 'distinct' about Budweiser - it's no different than the other macro brews. Unless nothing else is available, I don't plan on drinking this again."
"Innocuous, and easy enough to put back, but in the same way as a sandwich made with Wonderbread, you'll feel sort of guilty and empty afterwards. The 'drinkability' hacks probably pushed the IBU rating here into the negative range, but I actually have no problem downing it, particularly if I'm distracted, and already a bit sauced, which, thankfully, I am. Still no reason to make this your beer of choice, though."
"Drinkability: Despite the lack of flavor, it is still a crisp tasting beer that is fairly refreshing. This would make a great summertime with friends drink."
"Overall: This beer has a very light body with a high carbonation and a very thin but not watery body. The finish is nil. This beer is good for its style but that is pushing it."
"Watery, light finish. Not offensive, but not inspiring in the least. Would prefer water without the calories."
"A very drinkable beer for a Super Bowl Sunday. Poured down more than a couple yesterday. Very good for mass produced beer. Always consistent. Again, nothing special, just a good beer if you are having more than one and an excellent accompanyment to the mandatory hot wings and pizza at the party."
"My father in law will drink nothing but Bud and he and many others keep this macro at the top of it's class. I find that it smells and tastes of rice with a hint of malt. When poured into a glass it produces an enourmous head which quickly disipates leaving a yellow clear brew. When served ice cold it is very drinkable and it probably is the most consistent tasting beer on the market. I have never had a skunk one and find no matter where I have one it tastes the same. For the price (18 pk for $9.99) it would be the go to beer versus the other macros in this price range. However, I'll take a 12 pack of Harpoon IPA for $10.99 any day."
"Overall: It'll do in a pinch"
"Another macro brewed beer that I grew up on. Has that light yellow color that resembles urine, but is certainly drinkable if you're not in the mood to spend extra cash on a micro, or obviously if you're at a keg party or watching a football game with a bunch of people."
"Overall - I grew up drinking the Macros and will probably always drink a few of them. Bud is a staple in this style."
"Upfront I catch the malt with corn or rice. I can taste some hops through the finish. Budweiser is an extremely crisp beer and this should be apparent by the carbonation level. This beer has very little depth and a very basic flavor profile."
"drinkability: very easy. only good for long hot days."
"D--Yeah."
"Pours a very golden yellow with quite a bit of head and carbonation, but no lacing. Sweet malty scent, hints of rice/corn. All right taste, almost neutral, with a bit of skunkiness. Goes down very smoothly. Far from my favorite style, but this is a decent average beer for it."
"D- Very good. It is what it is.... an easy drinking belly wash beer."
"I used to hate everything Budweiser stands for but I have gotten used to this beer. If you can get used to the ""beechwood aging"" it's better than a lot of people give it credit for but it's still overrated. Not enough hops for me personally but as such it's easy to drink 6 or more"
"I always look to this beer as the old standard. It is my first ecperience ever with beer and is always a beer that i will go to from time to time. Hopefully it will never change."
"Budweiser is definitely guilty of false advertising, with all of the commercials and ""lager lessons"" b.s. that make the beer seem that it's the best in the world. At least they don't lie on the can: ""choicest hops, RICE and best barley malt."" There's a little exaggeration there though. Bottom line is that there are cheaper and better beers. Sorry AB, or I guess I should say inBev."
"Very drinkable beer no question."
"Mouth-feel is very light, crisp, and clean. And drinkability for me is quite high. I'm [almost] not ashamed to say that I quite like this beer. It's what I'd call a drink without any fuss."
"D= Very solid and drinkable beer. If you compare this beer to a decent craft brewed ale of course it will lose. But if you compare it to other mass prooduced American style light lagers, in my opinion this remains the King."
"From an ice cold bottle, just the way the founding fathers and jesus intended, this golden yellow beer is flooded with carbonation. A passive pour produces a minute head which quickly dissipates. Smells like an american beer. Light malt and no hops. When you finally take a drink, you realize that this is the king of american beers. The stalwart example for coors and miller to follow. As long as you drink these icy cold, they are drinkable all day long."
"D - Like I said before, it probably wouldn't kill you to hook up an IV of this stuff and have it pumped directly into your arteries. As for putting it in your mouth, The sky is the limit, but that's sort of the point."
"Conclusion: Light, thirst-quenching, and quaffable...there's nothing offensive here really...because there's really nothing here..."
"D: Not flavorful at all, goes down easily since there isn't much to it, likewise not filling at all, mild kick, it certainly is a good representation of its style even though I don't think that's much of a compliment, if at all. I suppose it is drinkable in a sense that you can pound through a lot of them due to its lack of substance. This beer is indeed the King of Fizzy Yellow Beers."
"Not really much in terms of atmosphere. Flavor is a strange combination of attributes, carried by a strange sweetness. The longer I keep it in your mouth, the more quickly I just want to finish it . Frankly it was a difficult quaff for me to finish off. Not a fan of this one."
"AND IT GIVES YOU horrible shits the next morning. BAD!"
"D- A very drinkable beer. 20 of them will have you stumbling drunk. The best of American macro beers."
"Comparable to Stella Artois."
"In my own words id say this really isn't too bad of a beer as far as a ""Light American macro"" is concerned. Its very filling, and isn't bad on taste. Very carbonated. All around not a bad beer."
"The last thing I have to say about this beer, is that the most common beer in movies has to be Budweiser. Every movie where someone is drinking at a bar, they always have a Budweiser in their hand. Anyone know if AB has any deals with Hollywood or is this just a coincidence?"
"Pours a pale yellow with 1/4 inch bright white head. Low retention and no lacing. Smells of adjunct in lager. Another example of a beer fitting this style. Tastes of adjunct in lager. Slightly more body than other american adjunct's but still watery overall. Not recommend to try this beer, too much water and adjunct in a weak lager."
"Taste: Taste is mostly adjuncts but it's a little better than most other beers of this style."
"D: As you'd expect, drinkability is high but I cannot give more than a 4 since I get frustrated each time I drink one."
"(rated Jul 11, 2008)"
"Im sorry but i can not beleave that this is the king of beers. It has to be one of the only beers even if it is for free i will turn down, and i drink a wide range of beers from light to dark. worst of all its not even american owned."
"This one pours a very pale yellow color with a faint sweet malt smell. The taste is nothing to write home about, which can be expected from a macro. I prefer Miller High Life and Coors Original to Budweiser, but there is not too much of a gap in likeness."
"Pours a clear pale yellow,thin white head,that goes away fast.Lots of carbonation,odd sweet malty aroma. Flavor is sweet metallic malt oddness,maybe a little yeasty bread at the finish,like this much better on tap.Of the macro-pale catagory I prefer Miller,and Coors to Bud. Drinkable,but I try not to buy this unless there is an emergency or something"
"D - Very high. I will probably finish the rest of the six pack (though that may be to get it out of the house as quickly as possible)."
"Drinkability: After the Philly cheese steak, pretty darn good! My fiance got a skunked Corona and she had to sip my Bud..."
"The macro tour continues. Hands down the coolest of the macros, too bad the taste doesn't measure up. Clear yellow pour with the bubbly white head. Rice and sugar. Lots of burps afterwards thanks to the mounds of carbonation. GO DALE JR.! Sorry, must be a side-effect of drinking the nectar of NASCAR."
"Called the 'King of Beers' but I would beg to differ. The beer is light in color and has that bland alcohol scent that similar beers have. It taste thicker than Bud Light, definitely not as watered down as Bud Light. My biggest harp on this beer has always been that it gives me heartburn if I have more than two. A friend of mine has the same problem. I avoid drinking this beer at all costs because of that. I've never had that problem with any beer except this one."
"Budweiser, while it is a macro-brew, is very consistent and drinkable. While there is no complex taste, it doesn't taste horrible and on a hot summer day it'll always get the job done. If you're looking for something complex this isn't the beer for you, but if you're just looking for a simple yet enjoyable beer, crack open another ice cold Budweiser and enjoy."
"drinkability is pretty high considering price and that its always around. Please drink this garbage out of the can or bottle though (and as cold as possible), preferably straight out of a 40oz (always a fun time)"
"D- Not something to drink for the taste. Easy to pour them back (that's about all they're good for)."
"Budweiser is one of the very few macro brews that is occasionally worthy of consumption. It pours a golden/brown with very little head and doesn't give much of a smell. The taste is fairly smooth and can be considered a little malty, but not as messy and metallic as many other macros. I would like to try this on-tap to see what kind of difference there is in taste from a can or bottle. It has some body, which means that it can still be consumed on a mass scale when possible. Overall though not a bad macro."
"I dont believe it is the king of all beers:P"
"(draft @ Fat Tuesday in the Pittsburgh International Airport - Moon Township, PA) Hardly any aroma but what I could detect was dry hops mixed with some corn. Pale yellow with little head and little carbonation. Heavy malt taste with very little body behind it. Overly watery. I don't know how this is the King of Beers."
"My old standby in college. Picked up a sixer of 8oz cans for boiling some brats. Had this one while I was cooking. Poured into a pint glass, filled up only half way. Pale yellow with a decent white head that slowly recedes leaving some light lacing. Aroma of some light malts, average hoppiness and adjuncts (corn). Flavor is much better than the aroma. Pale malts and light hops. Adjunct flavor is not a prevalent on the tastebuds as it is in the nose. Crisp, quite dry and refreshing. Still a great standbye, especially if I'm in a bar that only serves American Macros. This beer will always hold a special place in my heart, as it got me through college with it's bastard cousin Natty Ice."
"Easy to drink a few of these, that's for sure."
"I hadn't had this in a while so i thought i would pick up a six pack. You know, i'm not really sure why people are so hard on this beer, maybe just because it's a big name brewery...who knows. Anyway the appearance was ok, the head was not really there at all....smelled great for a lager to me and the taste was extremely crisp and smooth. Pretty sure i could drink my fair share of it."
"Edit - This is currently my second favorite for the style, I'll drink this over most other BMC brews except for Shlitz. To me it's actually got balance & more complexity when compared to others."
"D: Certainly perfect at doing what it's designed to do. Easy to drink and easy to forget. So forgettable in fact, that I'd rather pick a Macro with some character. There are cheaper macros out that are more interesting than the King."
"I don't care what anyone says...this is my trusty stand-by beer. no matter what state/region/area im in i can count on them having budweiser and they can count on me drinking it. so im sorry to everyone out there that is too good to drink ""normal beer"" I LOVE budweiser"
"Good beer, good price, available almost everywhere, and always a consistent taste. Great beer for a ball game or concert, but can also go well with dinner. A good stand-by beer."
"D: I don't mind one of these from time to time, draft, can, or bottle. I still pull for other macro lagers, but all in all, an accommodating beer."
"ok, this isn't so bad. will try a regular bottle sometime, i suppose. those cans i had were just atrocious..."
"Really???"
"It is a pretty refreshing beer overall. Built for your average beer drinker and succeeds there. If I'm short on cash, I'll turn to Budweiser. These also make an awesome red beer."
"A plain and simple lager that will quench your thirst again and again!"
"I reviewed this beer knowing it was a mass produced domestic beer and I didn't expect much so my rating is probably a little high"
"Drinkability : a not impressed flippant beer in the style American macro lager."
"Drinkable, but only because it is like water. Would knock a bunch back at a party if I was trying to get drunk."
"Can poured into a mug. Transparent straw yellow with a piss-froth fizzy head. No lacing, poor retention. Corn syrup aroma with a touch of alcohol. Flavor is weak pale malt base with a fermented rice sweetness. Completely inoffensive and completely boring. Goes down like water. Thin and overcarbonated."
"GC"
"For some reason this one never comes up for me. Just don't really drink it. But I did, and it was not really worth even paying attention. There's no point, really. It's just carbonated water with a solid booze infusion. Basically no aroma, no flavor. I can't even call it bad, cause that would indicate that there was something objectionable to it, and there was no THING to it at all. Bland bland bland bland bland."
"A completely average beer by all means. This in Budweiser so they are going for the average beer that everyone likes. Not for the beer enthusiast but perfect for the average drinker. Little no no head retention and I must admit that I like the smell of this beer even though I have to get about an inch away from the beer to smell it. Taste is pretty hoppy for a beer in this category. A safe bet for someone who doesn't want and interesting beer."
"Not one to sit down, enjoy & saviour."
"I'm generally a microbrew guy but recently when asked what I wanted I looked around to see if anyone was watching and whispered ""Budweiser"". It was on tap and obviously a fresh keg cuz when it arrived I could smell the combination of fresh bread and yeasty-brewery aromas. And I could clearly taste each component...a little bit of sweetness from the malt...a balanced note of bitterness from the hops (no hop flavor)...and I could also taste, 'feel' actually, the rice and where it fit in to fill out the body. It was refreshing. All the beer flavors were there. Each was subtle. None of them overwhelmed any other. It tasted good and quenched my thirst. I'm glad I ordered Budweiser that day. It reminded me that I just like beer...all kinds of beer."
"D/O: For what this is trying to be, you can't knock it. If given the option between this and [name your Macro light lager here], I'd take this and always know what I'm in for. It quenches your thirst (so long as you keep it cold), and you don't have to think about it too much. That being said, I may choose to drink a glass of wine in that situation as well."
"From that golden hue of the pour, to the quickly dissapating head, to the aroma of the ""additives"" (ie, corn , rice, or whatever cheap grain that was laying around the factory)added to make the production costs cheaper, what more can a beer nut say... Good old Budwiser. Its as american as Apple pie, fortunately anyone with half a brain knows that Apple pie is much better when its made by the little lady down the street rather then at the ""Apple Pie"" factory. Thats all...enjoy."
"About the only time I pay for one of these is at a ballpark over BL and ML. Could drink at a picnic perhaps, but make sure this beer is ICE cold."
"No it's not the quality of great craft ale and I usually drink beers with more hops and flavor, but it is still drinkable and enjoyable for what it is. If you are going to drink a mass produced lager I would go with this one without hesitation. Don't listen to the often unwarranted slams, and if a negative review talks about the corn taste in this beer just don't pay attention, there is no corn in Budweiser."
"I'd had a couple of craft beers that weren't the greatest, but then a friend gave me a Bud the next day and that really put things in perspective. Color is a weak yellow with white head. Not much aroma at all, a little bit of grain. Taste is a notch better than Bud Light, and that's the best I can say. Hints of grain and rice flavor, maybe some nuts, and that's about it. A light weak beer like this is certainly drinkable in a AZ heat, and that's all there is to say about this weak-ass beer."
"D - I actually made it through the whole can! With no taste and as thin as this is, it certainly isn't a pleasure to drink, but it is easy to drink."
"Drinkability: It's better on tap and I'm sure it's fresh as I can see the plant from the airport... I'd drink it again if complimentary."
"What else can i say, its budweiser"
" It could be better,yet I certainly have had worse."
"not sure what's up, but on an empty stomach this bud was quite enjoyable. however, not that it's done there's something a little bit unpleasant in the aftertaste and aftermouthfeel. maybe it's from the beechwood or an adjunct. still, struck me as surprisingly good given what i recalled from a few years ago. drinkability could be more of a 3.5-4 if this is not a recurrent issue (and taste could go to 3.5 if the aftertaste recedes after a couple more rather than accumulates)."
"Tawny straw-colored body that produces an abnormal amount of barnacle-like bubbles at the glass...tremendously effervescent... head is unsubstantially inflated early and rescinds to an uneven horizon... smells of corn syrup, sweet malts and through memory, stale frat keg metal... thin, pale and watery, with a bubbly final flourish... aftertaste is a short, lingering fizz... I'm still trying to taste the beechwood--until then, corn and water occupy the majority of the tastebuds... at the risk of sounding crude, this beer has always given me bad gas--and much worse after consuming a 12-pack at the beach, as friends at Wildwood 2000 will attest--Bud may be what is right and wrong with America: quick, easy, light, slightly artificial, consistent, gassy, and the popular choice for everyone from the establishment to the common folk, fathers and uncles (mine included)..."
"For what it is, a widely available beer meant to be enjoyed by the masses, it does its job. But, it's high in calories and not that cheap so if you want widely available cheaper beer there's much better options out there. Very hard to tell this from a Bud Light, maybe a hint of more taste but really none at all."
"Budweiser gets a lot of smack laid upon it, but for what it is -- a light, refreshing, highly drinkable brew -- it's not bad. Perhaps a bit characterless, but compared to its Lite counterpart, it certainly leaves the ring a winner."
"Okay, I've given this a shot. I will have no problem disliking this beer to the end of my days now, as my conscience is now clear."
"Sorry, not good at all in my opinion."
"Pours a light, clear pale yellow with a thick white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of cereal grains with slight tones of alcohol. Could definetly taste the beechwood with a mixture of cereal grains and hops. This was very sweet, not overpowering, but suprising for a lager. Texture was on the thin side. Overall I could not find anything bad about this. It is a lighter beer with good flavor. An excellent beer for the outdoors, to bad you can no longer call it an American Beer."
"Please dont be a beer snob, be a beer lover!"
"D: Not my cup of tea, but I can see how this can be consumed in mass amounts - there's really nothing to it. Not recommended."
"Terrible. This is difficult to drink and has an awful aftertaste. I never understood the Budweiser appeal. There's even much better swill out there. Musty, corn, stale, malt creates a bad taste that even lingers a little. The only good thing I can say about this beer is that the commercials are funny. And that doesn't have anything to do with the actual beer but may explain some of the appeal. Ahhh, nothing like a great marketing campaign."
"My pour produced two fingers' of thick, bone-white head with poor retention. It so quickly reduced to wisps that I began to wonder if it had ever really been there. The nose had definite corn overtones along with a sharp, vinegary odor. The color was a light golden-yellow with NE-plus quality. Hell, this was one of the beers that gave rise to the term. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a definite lager-like sweetness, albeit a watery one. Finish had a mild sweetness that let me know that it was in the lager family, but this could have been so much more. A shame, really."
"D- Just plain bad. The first time I ever had Budweiser was after drinking 7 other beers, and I still had a hard time finishing it just because I hate it so much. I'm no beer snob; I won't turn down something when it's offered to me. I'll drink Miller Lite, PBR, Coor's, etc. if I have to, but if my only option is Budweiser, I will pass."
"Drinkability: (shrug) It'll do. It's not ""I don't want to drink this ever again"" bad, just ""I wish I were drinking something better"" bad. Which isn't so bad, really. And hey - for all its faults, it is pretty refreshing."
"D: While not one I would choose to drink on a regular basis, much less in multiples, I didn't find this beer as offending as I thought it would be, though it was pretty much neutral in flavor it faired much better then anticipated and better then many foreign euro lagers which I sampled. It was cleanly brewed with few if any off flavors for a style that is considered one of the hardest to brew due to its lightness. Of the big 3 macros I would probable rank this a close second behind coors light and far ahead of miller which I found truly offensive taste wise."
"The king of beers pours pale gold with a medium head that recedes quickly. A small amount of lacing on the surface. Pretty typical macro aroma. A dull sweetness with a touch grassy hops. Taste is crisp. Not very sweet. Just a bit of grassy herbal hops. Balanced. I think you can definitely tell the rice note in this one. It just adds a some lightness and crispness. More pleasant tasting than most macros. Mouthfeel is light but there is definitely a bit of body. Pretty drinkable. Overall this is one of the better macros out there. No off notes. Nothing particularly offensive."
"Just as an aside, I find it ironic that my father always considered this a premium beer that he sometimes couldn't afford and therefore would settle for what he called ""bitter"" beer like PBR. He frowns on me now because I pay even more money for what he also calls ""bitter"" beer such as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"Not as bad as I had thought it would be. Lacks complexity and strong flavors, but refreshing overall. Very filling."
"This beer pours a clear straw yellow with just a bit of fizz. I was rather surprised at the lack of head that came out. No lacing. The beers aroma is typical of a macro lager. Hints of corn and subtle non descript sweetness come through. The taste is much the same. All sorts of average going on in this one. The mouthfeel is light and finishes dry. While I know many people would mock me for giving this beer as high a rating as I did, Bud has its benefits and its drinkability is one of them. It's really easy (on one of those nights respect for beer gets tossed out with the empties) to pound several. Its crisp and easy to drink when its ice cold."
"Ehhh, an American classic, yes. A great beer? Not in my opinion. It has a pretty mediocre taste that isn't hard to beat out. I rarely drink this as its close to the opposite of what I like but I don't need to go on. Hey... try it, it is a legend after all. (Personally I like Miller's taste better but I'll drink Bud if it's there)"
"D - This wasn't horrible, but it was definitely a few notches below what I expected. I thought it would be a nice easy drinking brew for the concert (as I don't too much mind Bud from the bottle or can), but for whatever reason this stuff on tap was completely bland and devoid of character."
"So, is this beer undrinkable? Perish the thought. It is highly drinkable, despite its many and varied flaws. It goes down easy. It tastes mostly OK as long as you don't quit drinking. And on a brutally hot Philadelphia day in the upper reaches of the stadium, it is damned refreshing. Think I need another."
"A standard American beer, better than most of the others around but too expensive for what you get. It's what I drink when I'm golfing or at my old man's house but that's about It, hey I'm a Strohs man. Pale yellow pour, faint adjunct-malt aroma, thin and watery, faint cheap flavor."
"Nothing special, but overall refreshing and easy. Pale golden yellow color, perfectly clear, with small and quickly-vanishing head, and very little lacing. Very weak aroma. Taste is boring, but not at all bad. Refreshing, in fact; it's no wonder it's perfect for football and Cardinals games, when you just want something to sip on and get a little buzz. Very clean an over-processed, of course, but not bad. Decent mouthfeel; light, with average or slightly-more-than-average carbonation. Drinkable. Decent."
"I rate this beer 3.0 across the board because I use it as, and think it is, a reference point for Macro Lagers worldwide..."
"not the king of beers. this is a disgusting beer. it amazes me how many people love this beer. i think it is awful. i guess it is better than king cobra or steel reserve but not by much. this beer is not worth my money. i would not drink it if it was free. i guess the only thing this beer is good for is the economy since it is american made and american owned. anheiser busch is by far my least favorite brewery, they have yet to impress me with anything"
"Having said that, I doubt I'll pick up any the next time I head to the store."
"D: Very high. Highly quaffable."
"this beer is drinkable enough to be the best selling in the world, it's not my style I can not fault this beer for much style wise. I would like to see more hops, I would have liked to see a slightly more pronounced, sweeter malt flavor. That said I can't fault much about this beer."
"Of course it is drinkable. But I don't see a reason have more than one of these. Better than expected though."
"The mouthfeel is crisp, clean, and refreshing. Drinkability depends on the situation. Budweiser is definitely the best at what it's trying to accomplish."
"So, I've had many many microbrews, my all-time favorite being Lancaster Brewery (hey, it's my hometown). So here I am, 39 years old, and I couldn't remember the last time I actually drank just a regular Budweiser. So I thought, seriously, could it be that bad? I mean, it's mass-produced, they spend quite a bit on advertising - but everyone, I mean EVERYONE, seems to hate it? So I bought a case. $17 dollars, no biggie. And guess what? It tastes good. Nothing special, no crazy hops taste. Just good old beer. Clean, refreshing - very drinkable for any time of the year. Will I be buying it all the time? Probably not. I do prefer to stick to local PA brewers (Straub's, Yuengling, Stoudt's, etc.) but I do think Bud has a bad rap. A fine beer for any occasion."
"For the style, this beer is not complete garbage...It serves society a different purpose than craft beer does: it is cheaply made and cheaply priced. As a college student I can admit to purchasing Bud diesel just because of its price. Remember it is made for mass production"
"D: Easy to drink and seemed to help keep the fish coming into the boat regardless of the time of consumption."
"Awww, the ""Great American Lager"" once again satisfies me. It is what it is, a pale, rather tasty staple of American beer drinking. Not a regular choice for me, but an easy one if nothing else better is available"
"Drinkability as mentioned above is good for a cookout, by the pool, or drinking with your buds. Otherwise, this stuff is a bit pricey for such an average brew."
"But if you want cheap beer that is everywhere, buy away. Goes great with any NASCAR race, bonfire, or all day fishing trip."
"Time to revisit Bud Lite, I suppose....the heat of summer calls for thirst quenching even more than big bold flavors and kick-ass alcohol."
"D- Drinks good when cold"
"But not something to really say what a great Product!"
"I agree with gonzo 46 and 2. You're gettin whatcha pay for here. It's not the worst. Wet's my whistle. No bad flavors. Removed all that's offensive. Like the McDonalds of the beer world. A little bit of head. No lace. Ultra mild. Borrr - rinnnggg."
"Had my first Bud in a long long time. The guy next to me at the Sox game bought it for me. I'm NO fan of Bud, and probably haven't had a BMC beer in 2 years, but this is NOT one of the worst 50 beers in the world. It's far better than many of the cheap, crappy pale lagers in many parts of the world. Although it had little taste to speak of, it was exceedingly easy to drink, which, for BMC swill, ain't that terrible."
"Yeah, keep on knocking Budweiser, but it's a champion amongst fellow victims of a wimpy style."
"Not a whole lot going on in this beer. Pour is pale and fizzy. A bit sweet, some malt. Just enough hops to balance, no taste from them or aroma. It does taste better than say Special Ex or Icehouse, but nothing to write home about. Or to take home for that matter."
"My old stand-by from the Anheuser Busch line. Two words: Consistent, drinkable. The appearance is a pale golden hue with a lacey head that is very lively with bubbles running up the glass. The smell is malty corn and nothing special. The taste is very balanced with a hint of hops, metal, and crusty bread. This rating stands as long as its fresh. If the beer runs past its freshness date, the taste suffers considerably. Always beats a bud light."
"Poured from 12oz can into standard pint glass. Dumping the can into my glass, this yielded 1.5 finger head that lasts less then the 10 seconds it takes me to walk to the recycle bin and back to the computer. Color is a very light straw. Smell is not impressive at all, no hop profile to speak of in the nose, slight, I mean very slight malt profile. Taste is very light, as to be expected, high carbonation, bland. Best to drink exceptionally cold. Good session beer when finances are tight and taste is secondary or tertiary."
"Drinkability: A great lawnmower beer. I have consumed many cans of this, and will continue to do so as long as someone else is buying."
"Today, I would say this isn't my favorite macro lager. I think I will stick with a good old PBR for a good simply beer. However, I think Bud is still a good simple easy brew to drink. Just remember to drink it cold, don't over analyze it, and appreciate this simple brew for what it is."
"Also, be sure to pour that shit in a glass if you buy it in cans (like I normally do). Gets rid of most of the metallic taste, if that bothers you."
"I am a craft drinking homebrewer so don't get me wrong. If there are alternatives I will jump for them. I absolutely hate bud light, and stayed away from this to. I figured they were pretty much all in the same. But I was suprised to find out that it wasn't so bad!"
"The taste is light, smooth grain, a bit of a mineral-water quality in taste and body that takes over part-way through. However, it stays smooth and retains some flavour, much more than Coors. It is lighter in flavour, especially hoppiness, than PBR and has a more mineral-water/7-up quality than PBR."
"It's Budweiser, what can you say? It's golden appearance is somewhat seductive, pulling you in to a trap. The aroma and taste are not very appealing. The problem is that it goes down smooth so you are encouraged to drink more. Drinks like this are the reason alcohalism for so many begins in college wher drinks like this are prevelent."
"I don't like bud. It has an average yellow color with a light tan head. The smell is of stale hops and some light malt. The taste is not any different. Basic light flavored malts and some icky hops. Feel is very light and over carbonated. I would not want any let alone one of these. Sorry Busch."
"It is what it is. I'd prefer something a bit more interesting and flavorful, but it's not as bad as some make it sound."
"beer review id: 7699 / 02-16-2002 19:30:44"
"The taste is very clean and smooth tasting. A bit of grain, a bit of malt sweetness, and a slight bitterness in the finish. The body is just right for the style and it's easy drinking. Not much more I can say. It's just solid."
"D-this is a beer I grew up drinking so maybe this clouds my judgment a little,that said, I find nothing wrong with the King of Beers"
"This is the all-American beer. Mass produced, mass consumed, a college person's diet staple. Pours and light golden color with a head that doesn't quit. Taste of smooth malts. Drink with whatever, whenever, whereever. Enjoy it as cold as you can get it and don't let it sit out too long."
"This is by far the best mass produced, mass distributed American style lager. One thing I try to keep in mind when rating beers is the style of beer. Now is this one of my all time favorites and I would order/buy all the time, no, but it is a perfect beer for when I am at the ball park, at a bar/restaurant that does not serve a variety of beers. The beer provides a nice clear pale yellow/straw color with a thin head. Not much of a nose, it smells like most other American style lagers. The beer is very drinkable with the right level of carbonation. It is light with some malt overtones, but very smooth and crisp. This is a beer that has its place. If I am going to be outside in the summer for any reason, I am going to grab this beer before say a heavy porter or stout. Overall, this is a beer that I enjoy a lot during the summer months and should be regarded as the best American style lager."
"mouthfeel is watery and very fizzy, but you could definitely drink dozens of these if you were feeling it.."
"It's probably the best of the American macro's. Kinda boring but it goes down good after mowing the lawn or while watching football. For what it is, it's probably the best there is. And at least they put it in a brown bottle."
"Pours light yellow with low head. Smell is a little off reminding you of your last hang over. For such a big company with many micros under its umbrella, they have done nothing to improve this beer over the years. Marketing is the only thing they have done well, but who drinks/tastes commercials...not good!.. Rather drink from a dirty stream. Not only that you wake up dried out with head ache. Not from quantity either!"
"D - The light flavor and body aid drinkability and contribute to a clean, simple overall impression. The green apple aroma represents a slight flaw IMO, and there are no real positive aspects to balance it out."
"Drinkability is moderate. It's a sessionable beer, but I'm not encouraged to drink many due to it's lack of flavor."
"To place this in perspective, some people say that people should accept any cultural tradition and not pass judgement on it. However, I hold that it is possible to condemn reprehensible traditions no matter who purports it. Budweiser is one such tradition."
"M/D: Watery feel with high carbonation like a soda. Not drinkable and should not be drank if you know what is good for you. Definitely good for beer pong though."
"Would I recommend it? No. Would I drink it? Only as an absolute last resort if nothing else is available where I am, such as a sporting event. Beer is better than no beer."
"Drinkablility: A last resort beer, like if you go to an afterparty and they have a 30 pack in the fridge you might have to drink one against your will...we've all been there"
"Notes - Not as bad as it's made out to be around here. Decidedly average, but not awful. While I'd never go out of my way to drink this, it's really not a bad brew."
"Their logo is pretty awesome. I guess if you're going to pee in a bottle and try to market it, you had better have some pretty eye-catching packaging. These guys have great business sense. Why waste time perfecting the taste when the bulk of the American public will swallow pretty much anything they can afford? I used to drink this when I was underage because I didn't know what I was doing other than acquiring something that would get me drunk."
"For what this beer is, a consistent staple in the American pilsner-style lager category, Anheuser-Busch has hit a bulls eye. Pours straw-yellow with exceptionally uniform and persistent lacing. Upon smell, a sour, almost always somewhat skunked version of hoppiness hits your nose, but once past, a great, clean scent of crisp pilsner can be found. Upon tasting, intense carbonation, moderate maltiness and mouthfeel can be noticed. Hoppiness is medium, and on the moderate sector in terms of spiciness. Finish is clean, with a moderate after-feel of malt syrup and carbonation. For a traditional American, mass produced pilsner-style brew, a cold Budweiser simply cannot be beat. Drinkability is exceptional, and is best in the spring and summer. A."
"That being said, I think I'll go to my fridge now and grab a Sam Adams."
"D - This was a good reminder of why I don't usually drink this. I remember in years past (i.e. college days) it usually gave me headaches in the morning and not because of overcomsumption."
"D-Got better with each sip as the palate adjusted itself to gradually lower standards."
"Drinkability - Not my favorite, but not the worst either."
"I agree with the Bros. that this is a mass-produced beer designed to please everyone who doesn't seem to care what their beer tastes like. Nevertheless, this doesn't excuse Budweiser for putting out a lame beer. It's not drinkable at all. I'd rather drink glass after glass of tap water. I'd probably get drunker off the mercury and chromium than I would with a case of Budweiser."
"What can I say had a can over at my uncle's house poured into a pilsner glass crystle cleer pale yellow color. The apearence was very good but the head disapeared to quick so it lost points for that. Smell not much here fant hop aroma maby green apple and grain. Taste very clean not much else no after taste. Mouthfeel a bit thin high in carbonation. Drinkability is ok you dont even know your dinking anything."
"Best location I've had this beer: San Diego, California"
"What can I say, this beer is exactly what you pay for. Little taste, not much color...a good swilling beer."
"Very light, pale-ish yellow with no head at all. Some sweet simple malt smell. Too highly carbonated on first taste. Just the mildest bit of bitterness, with malty, corn, rice-ish sweetness following in the aftertaste. Quite sweet actually, but the intense carbonation kind of strips the tongue making it hard to taste it after a while. A bit harsh on the palate. Not a great beer, obviously, but the worst part was the unusual headachy buzz this gave me. Would rather drink just about anything else."
"Unusually large head with an odor that matches the smell that their brewery produces (it smells slightly like urine and believe me, I know. I used to live close to their Los Angeles Brewery and when you drive by there, your windows better be rolled up). The taste is overly tingly because of the high carbonation and has a large amount of corn flavor. The aftertaste is not at all pleasant."
"Seriously, it is very pale and has very little flavor, hence the words AB uses to market it ""Clean, crisp, refreshing ..."" Sounds like a freshly laundered shirt more than a beer."
"The great american industrial beer. My favorite of all the major brewing company beers. Smooth and clean tasting beer. Watery compared to a mirco, but it has more taste than in other macro. Great on a hot day, out with your freinds, or at the ball game. can't complain that it is weak or anything, its not suposed to be a micro."
"They say it's tasteless, that's reserved for Bud Light, while this beer does have a crisp, smooth taste with loads of carbonation."
"Budweiser is an interesting beer. Its a consistent beer with a clean smell and crisp taste but there us something slippery about the mouthfeel and it doesn't sit well at all in my stomach. Its like there is an strange ingredient that is only in Bud that I can't put my finger on. I can see why it is a popular beer, but it isn't for me."
"It may not be what I reach for when I want a beer, but Bud isn't brewed for me, its brewed for the average beer drinking public (not BAs) and with this demographic, it seems to be right on. As far as the mass produced American lagers go, I think this is the best, but my goal is to review them all before I make my final judgment."
"Overall: Bud tastes like beer flavored water, but on the positive side its consistent enough that it doesn't have any glaring flaws from batch to batch. Bud is drinkable if it is the only beer available, but its NOT a good or even average beer. I'd rather pay slightly more for its big brother, Michelob... which at least has some body and flavor to it. I don't see a reason to buy Bud when Michelob (also made by A-B) is only slightly more expensive."
"D: The bourgeois seems to think pretty good. I agree."
"D - Tried a second just to make sure, but not more."
"Just ... don't."
"D- I like this out of a keg better but I don't like it and will probably never buy it. I think it is very overrated."
"D- Goes down OK, but feels very heavy for an American macro. Honestly I'd choose the thinner Bud Light given a choice only between the two. (2.5)"
"It is a decent beer in all aspects, but cannot meet the average level in any category accept for drinkability. When you are at a function with Uncle Albert, who loves Bud and they only serve Bud, that is the time to start drinking Budweiser."
"The smoothest beer in its class of mass made American lager. a lite yellow in apperance with nice bubble action. MUST BE SERVED VERY COLD FOR BEST TASTE. Able to drink by the mass quanities. Decent feel in mouth if you like thin beer. Not much taste, just a strong metal, much stronger than the lite beers. Not to bad for people that just want to get drunk but dont want the gas that goes along with the others in its class."
"bière blonde industrielle, avec une mousse chimique, sans grand intérêt. odeur de malt, maïs et autres produits substitut, en bouche elle est liquide, rafraichissante, elle est sans grand intérêt pour les amateurs. pour les journées chaudes. ressemble à d'autre (sic)"
"Pours yellow and carbonated like a soda. The nose is of air. At first taste it reminds me a lot of a 2005 evian. Actually make that one of those free breast cancer waters you get on horizon airlines. There is virtually no flavor, but whatever there is its water and a slight bit of barley or grain. Goes down like carbonated water. Coincidence? Drinkability is high, can be chugged like water. Good for your first mullet, very nice if topped with a red #8 hat. good with steaks cooked on the engine of a 71 chevy."
"D = I would not seek this out, but I would drink it if it were the only beer on offer, mostly because I like it better than most non-beer drinks, not because it is good beer. Like I said, it is pretty inoffensive and bland."
"In a typical 12oz can offered to me at a party, drank this grainy sweet brew unwillingly, but, since its hard for me to turn down a free brew, did my best to enjoy it... Appearance and smell are equally poor... very corny and malty with not much flavor... somewhat bitter-sweet with a unsatisfying mouthfeel lead to a drinkability that is border-line awful... wouldn't want to down more than one of these in a single setting... since its such a popular brew in the USA, its hard to avoid, but I'd never run out to buy a sixer... Not recommended..."
"I guess this beer is very typical for the style...one i care to not indulge in again."
"Pale colored beer with average macro lager aroma.I know it's far from the best tasting beer but it is just what it was made for,a refreshing beer for hot days or when you are with your buddies watching a football game.It's easily the freshest beer on the market and most likely the most popular.I will drink Bud until the day I die and recommend this beer.Just watch out for those nasty Bud headaches!!"
"This is more of a refreshing beer for the summer months, but thats about all I can say about this."
"Overall, probably my favorite macro (not considering price). Almost well balanced, it shows at least some thought by the brewer."
"I used to call this a Diesel, more of a drinking with buddies clean finish beer then a beer you would enter into a taste test. Calories of a dark lager but yellow in color. Not my first choice but very good draft. Kinda sneaks up on you alcohol wise 5.0 abv very filling. I would take this over a Miller Genuine Draft anyday of the week."
"Goes good with bbq and tailgates...shop for this stuff like you do milk...get the freshest carton of bottles even if you have to reach way far back into the cooler...One appreciates the born on date...but one seriously wonders why they used rice to brew an American icon?...Ah well maybe that adds to the crispness...and the plainess...This is not a bad beer and I can remember when I thought this beer was heavy...it's been so long since I had it and so many delicous craft beers since that I thought for a second I picked up Bud Light instead...Of course I knew I hadn't...that beautiful label...it's quite possibly one of the most effluent labels ever!...Buddy is from Bavaria and he chides me on my eating of ""white bread"" and drinking of this beer...yet I swear I've seen a red carton in his fridge a time or two...didn't say anything...""When in Rome..."""
"D - I'm not impressed with this beer at all theres really no good qualities to this beer at all"
"Any way, what Budweiser is good for is getting you drunk and maintaining a pleasant buzz. It has just the right alcohol content to drink it all night long. I dont recommend drinking it while you are alone because then you think too much about it. But drink it in a bar. Its cheap. During happy hour bars are almost giving it away. You can drink Bud all night without having to miss a mortgage payment."
"Despite the utter inclination to trash this macrobrew, that would be unfair to a moderately decent, if unremarkable, beverage. Thin white head over a pale amber body. The least impressive part about it is the lack of nose to it--barely a whiff of malt and rice. But the taste isn't bad--again, nothing spectacular, but a smooth, clean taste. On the whole, worth having if it's warm and nothing else is available, a decent fall-back beverage in a genuine pinch. However, it's nothing I'd go out of my way for."
"Was thinking about having some water LOL. Didn't enjoy this, glad I didn't grow up on this stuff, i actually started drinking beer like 6 years ago, and started on Sam Adams."
"Drink it instead of water."
"Look, this isn't the worst beer ever made. It just seems that way because it's a BILLION-dollar company who spends a lot of the $ on ads. And yeah, had I gone over to Germany for the 2006 World Cup only to see that Bud was available at the games, I would've been pissed. In fact, my real regret is that people outside of America probably associate Americans w/ Bud after Coke and McDonald's. As for the actual beer, it's not bad to have one or two during a football game, although that aftertaste that drys out my mouth is unwelcome. I find the 5% abv hard to believe, because I've had pitchers of this with buddies and not gotten a buzz. If for some reason you've never had Bud, don't bother."
"This is everything that is wrong with the vast majority of American beers...I know we are not supposed to slag a beer unjustly,but I have nothing good to say about Bud.Everytime I have ever drank it,a massive hangover has been the result...along with the trots.Rice does not belong in beer...Sake sure,but beer?No."
"Best of the American Light ""Lagers"". This thing is smooth and sweet. Goes best with about 9 more of the same and some peanuts. When you can't afford Duvel this is adequate filler."
"Drinkability: A consistent beer. Not bad."
"D: I could drink in a session about as much of this brew as I could during a similar session of drinking water. Best on a hot sweaty day and served ice cold."
"I have had a few of these in my day. Appearance is typical BMC. Smell is of hops and barley but very weak. Taste is watered down and bitter in the wrong way. Mouthfeel is over carbonation and no maltiness. Very drinkable beer on an extremely hot day outside, otherwise not too much want for this one. I always seem to get a head ache from this one..."
"I got a 24 ounce can for $1.49. Poured half of it into a pint glass. It's pretty ugly. See-through urine-colored beer. Quickly dissipating soapy white head. I smell hay, dirt, and metal. Perhaps a hint of rice and/or hops. But it's not bitter. And it's not horrible. It's just not very good. It tastes like any mass-brewed American beer. Mediocre at best. Kind of watery but easy to drink. I would be embarassed to have a German over at my house and serve him this. I think I'd buy some Samuel Adams Boston Lager should that situation arise."
"This is the most solid beer of your Macros considering price, availability. Great on a summer day on the beach or working."
"Easy to drink, once you get used to the bland taste. Not that enjoyable, but in a pinch, at a ball game where there is no decent micro brews available, this is what I grab."
"Bud is my favorite of the macro beers. Light malt and hop bitterness but is definitely very easy to drink and gets my nod when at a bar that basically only has A-B or at a Cards game unless I am in the Casino Queen Party Porch area where the selection is a couple of micro beers better."
"i never did expect anything great from this mass produced beer. it isn't at all a terrible beverage but when reviewing a beer compared to some of the better micros it makes bud seem very poor. the pour is a weak yellow with an offwhite head. the mouthfeel and taste are not impressive at all, kind of sour in my opinion. it does however have a decent drinkability though. overall not so good."
"I only tend to use Bud for beer butt chicken and thats it. I would rather drink water than this."
"D: One of the better American mainstream lager beers, at least there's no rancid corn taste, tasted fine warm as well, not my first choice, but would drink a free one for sure."
"This beer pours a nice gold with a nice white head. As for an American Macro Brew, this is what it is supposed to look like. The aroma is of light malt and light hops that make a very refreshing beer, but not necessarily good. The taste is average with a small amount of hops and malt that are melded together using alot of water. The taste is pretty bland, but the carbonation is right on and because of this, it makes it a very drinkable beer. Not bad for an American Macro Brew."
"I guess for an American macro brew, this takes the gold. As far as being a good beer, I think this probably ties for last, along with Miller Genuine Draft and Coor's Original. Despite obvious intuitions, I've never actually seen this stuff being filtered by a horse. Pours a clear golden yellow with little to no head, no lacing and lots of carbonation bubbles constantly streaming to the top. Aroma is only slightly detectable: corn and malts. Taste is corn and little to no hop flavors present. Mouthfeel is thin and easy drinking. Overall, if I had to choose an American lager to drink, this would definitely not be it."
"Pours a pale yellow reminiscent of urine. Almost no aroma and pours with little white head that dissipates rather quickly. Not much lacing on the glass. Taste is sort of bland with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel is not to pleasnant as this seems to be overly carbonated. Still, it is very consistent and has a high level of drinkability. Sort of like water."
"If it's on special, at a bar, or in the store, and you're not trying to impress anyone or going for something different, then Bud can be purchased without regret. Otherwise, spend the extra cash and get something you'll have something good to remember it by."
"Overall, you can pretty much test any beer by Budweiser. If it's just as good, then it's good enough to drink. If it's better, then that's just a bonus. If it's worse... well then you know it's worse and it's time to stop drinking that beer."
"But hey, if you're drinking one of the American 'big three' (AB/Miller/Coors) out of a can in the first place, was anything supposed to be different?"
"D: Doesn't taste bad enough to be offensive. Mouthfeel kinda lowers the drinkability, though. Beer is still easy to quaff and isn't horrible. At least you know you can find it anywhere and chances are it's on special."
"I HIGHLY recommend this be consumed in the aluminum bottles. I drank mine out of a special cooler that set the temp at 22 degrees...and having it be ice cold makes it infinitely better."
"I guess one thing it has going for it is that it has more alcohol than a light beer, but if you are going to have this much alcohol, you need to make it microbrew"
"D-not the worst thing I will ever drink. Malt flavoured seltzer. No off taste which is the best thing I can say"
"Words cannot describe how terrible this beer really is. The only thing this beer has ever done for me is give me a brutal headache and the runs. I literally could have one of these and I can guarantee a headache and a trip or two to the toilet. Though 99% of the people who are on Advocate would never drink the stuff or recommend it, do everyone a favor and dont let anyone drink this stuff, it sucks so much."
"It's ok for it's trying to be..I'm not going to over do it..it will never compare with other great beers..it's as ubiquitous as a Big Mac..and about as flavorful.."
"drinkable?: of course. how could it not be."
"T & M - Really mellow straight forward lager. Not much complexity here. Really nothing going on for me with the feeling in the mouth. Overall it was a starter beer for me in my teen years. Now It is a great beer for doing a Beer Can Chicken or if you have had too many and you need something really light."
"I also dropped my cup and splashed a bunch on the girl sitting in front of me -- she didn't notice, and the cup didn't spill, so bonus points for Bud on that one."
"For a 'full flavored' beer very drinkable.I rated drinkability as very high because it's accessible to the consumer, it's inoffensive to most every tongue, and people, [myself included way back at the start of college] drink it in more than medically sound amounts."
"hot day and this beer is ice cold and the offer is there...hmm hard to turn down...drinkable but not my choice."
"Down from my snob soapbox and on with the proceedings. I purposely waited till after jogging in 85-ish heat to give the much maligned King of Beers a fighting chance as I always recall Bud actually satisfying a few taste buds when meeting a parched palette. I actually have some fond memories of the flavor from back in my younger days before an oatmeal stout or even an IPA ever touched my lips. So...yes, extremely pale gold, very piss-like as so many have suggested over the years. However, the head actually is pretty fair as it settles to an even thin white fluff with decent lacing even! I think the aroma is quite passable, a light citrus and wheat, maybe a slight lemon, weak but not horrible at all. OK, now the taste. Watery blah, even in my depleted state of thirst, it just didn't happen for me. Very week flavored, thin bread-like, wheat a bit, even undercarbonated which surprised me. This may not have been the freshest bottle but nothing lasts too long in my fridge. As always, it's drinkable. Has a slight peppery finish, sort of tangy at the tip of your tongue. It beats light beer but compared to a real brew, this is light beer. Aftertaste is sour and unpleasant to me, which is consistent with my memories of the old all American standby. In all fairness, I have had plenty worse beers among the micro offerings and it does go down quick when you want to beat back a thirst. Still, if you want a beer around for company I think you could do a bit better."
"Okay..this stuff is so pale it looks like my piss after drinking 6 beers. Very clear, very pale yellow with a head that fizzled away quick. The lacing is absent as well. Just a slightly sweet, slightly sour odor. Not appealing at all. Taste is watery, weak, and virtually tasteless. Some faint maltiness, but the corn and rice adjuncts over power it as much as weak tasting adjunts can. Watery, weak, light weight body. Makes perfect sense that Labatt's would brewe this stuff here in Canada as most of their beers are tasteless like this swill."
"This was once my favorite beer and only beer I would drink. Now It is just a boredom beer. I prefer to drink somthing with more taste and more substance than this now. But I still love bud and will always drink it. I would be happy to recomend this beer to somone who wants just a plain beer to drink and not really into the pure enjoyment of beer tasting. It pours a golden color with a decent head. Really the taste is a hoppy taste for the macro kind. I like this beer a lot. Always will be my old faithfull in a pinch."
"D: Not my first choice for a macro but certainly not the last. Average in terms of macros which really isnt saying that much."
"Really not the bad beer it's made out to be by some. I only drink bud occassionally because it is expensive in Australia, but it is clearly superior to some of the euro lagers due to its lack of dodgy smells and tastes. If you need your beer to be tasty, stay a way, but if you just want to be refreshed (or get pissed) this is not a bad choice."
"D: I would not recommend this beer. While Bud is a macro, I feel the bottled version gives it more justice than any of the other ""versions"" of it."
"My dad gives me crap about the fact that I don't buy the ""King of Beers", but instead I buy Pabst. Come on now, they're both from the same family tree... cheap, American beers... Yes, I would rather have a good stout or porter, yes, there are many more expensive beers that taste better than this, but for it's style, Budweiser is not bad. It isn't an entirely heavy beer, it goes down easy, and the taste is not overpowering - just what 90 percent of Americans like. I do enjoy good beers, but I also enjoy the good old-fashioned American macro lager (Pabst, Schlitz, Blatz)... now does that make me so bad?"
"It's still pretty tasteless, but this really beats the can or bottle any day. On a hot day at an amusement park, this actually tastes GOOD, and felt sort of dry and hoppy. Who knew that Bud could be so good?"
"Drinkability is pretty good, but only in the way you can chug a glass of water. I'd rather a beer that I want to drink a little slowly to savor the flavors. This I just want to swill so I can get it over with!"
"Not much smell. Not a ""bad"" taste, but, not great. I understand it is a top seller, but, that is mostly due to people drinking in bars, just to get drunk. Great for that, but, not so great as a beer to relax with."
"If only Bud could put a decent beer in this cool bottle!!!"
"This beer is not terrible."
"Poured into a small lager glass. The head is a thin white head that dissipates quickly. The color is a bright straw/ golden hue. Tight carbonation and crystal clear. The aroma is a cooked corn flake and pale malt grain. There is a crisp upfront taste, but a sweet aftertaste that lingers. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. There is a slickness that is unpleasant that coats your palate and keeps that aftertaste from leaving. I drink it when there is nothing else, but if I can I will drink something else."
"The mouthfeel was fizzy and lively -- probably the beer's best feature. Certainly drinkable -- goes down pretty easily, again like seltzer. Would certainly refresh on a hot day and does a good job trying to be exactly what it is -- a mass-produced, mass-marketed beer product that's uberconsistent. Doesn't make it a good beer -- frankly I don't see the point of having one of these; for a couple of extra bucks there are lots of better choices that are just as drinkable and refreshing that won't bust your budget to any huge extent. But it is what it is."
"Pours a clear color with a decent head at least. Aroma is one of corn and malt, which is to be expected of the style. Taste is much of the same except that it's a little sour and leaves an interesting aftertaste of corn and malt. Nothing impressive for sure but not too bad for the style. A little sweet and syrupy as well."
"D- this beer is a classic, hands down. it is cost effective, it is smooth, easy to drink, refreshing, consistant, and everything it was meant to be. though craft beers and micro brews may rise above in taste and aroma, AB did exactly what it set out to do: create a beer for the masses that will retain its american popularity forever and ever and ever."
"D- If the price was right, and I was hard up for money, I still dont know if I would buy this beer. Every once in a while I will buy a AB product, and its always disapoints me. Perhaps a bottle would taste better."
"Well, Budweiser wasn't as bad as I expected after my long haitus from the beverage (self-imposed, while I tried every craft beer I could find). The appearance was clear light orange-yellow, with a finely composed thin white foam. The smell was light with just a hint of malt and MAYBE hops, but so neutral it was hard to tell. Maybe most important there were no negative aromas to speak of. The flavor was a light malt with just a hint of hops at the back-end, again not negative in any way, just tailored for the masses. Not bad for a baseball game, and a damn sight better than Miller Lite if these 2 are all the selection you have (as is commonly the case)."
"This offering from the ""king of beers"" pours out a pale straw color leaving a thin white lace. The aroma is really faint which is what AB is going for grain, maybe some very suttle hops and malt. The taste is clean, crisp, refreshing, nothing really exciting to the palate though again a quality AB is going for. The beer does its job refreshing, clean, solid macro lager. For the style I give it a perfect score but for my overall enjoyment it is what it is."
"Macro lagers are to beer as fast food is to fine dining. I might suppose Budweiser then is the MacDonalds although unlike eating at the Golden Arches, I cant say I find even any guilty pleasure in drinking this"
"Still as a macro lager it is just fine."
"Drinkability - What can I say other than it is Budweiser. It's not amazing but it's not horrible. If I was at a party and this is what they had.. sure I'd drink it. Not too bad ice cold and during the hot summer months."
"On tap fresh from the source after the tour. Poured into a sample glass like a typical macro; clear, pale yellow, foamy white head, not much retention. Aroma is slightly fruity and grassy. Taste is also fruity with a bit of sweet malt. Finish is crisp and clean as advertised. It is what it is and can be a refreshing beer and as far as the category it is towards the top for me."
""
"I wasted my dollar and will avoid in the future."
"I have had two versions of this beer, the Anheuser-Busch brewed version in the bars of Memphis, Tennessee, and the ""brewed in Canada by Labatt under license...."" I'll take the Canadian version hands down. Sadly, the Canadian version sucks too. For a beer that is as heavily advertised as it is, and sells as much as it does, the rating here says it all. This is America's finest pisswater (Labatt Blue is Canada's finest pisswater). It amazes me when I go out with friends, there is always one who orders Bud. Take a gamble people, try one of the beers on tap you've never heard of....they're great (with all due respect to Tony the Tiger). This is one of those beers I will go out of my way to avoid. Having it in your fridge is a great way to get taken off my Christmas card list!"
"D - The only reason this gets an extra .5 is because you theoretically could drink 12 of these. Personally I'd rather drink 4 of something that actually has some character though."
"16 oz can left over from an after-work cookout. Born on date 25May07. Looks like the urine sample I submitted for my last drug test, only fizzier. Very weak sweet malt aroma, very weak sweet malt flavor, very weak watery mouthfeel. Budweiser is the beer equivalent of carbon monoxide: colorless, odorless, tastelss, lethal in large doses."
"I only give it a 4 on drinkability because you can chug it like there's no tomorrow. The appearance is pale yellow like a discharge we know. The taste is thin because they use very little malt and use rice syrups to boost the alcohol, Strohs is not really good, but it's way better than Bud. Bud has an eerie similarity among all its breweries. Quality control, or what. Only drink if you have to. Compliment the host."
"I'll always like this beer for what it is. Don't be too harsh on the King. He's got the crown for some damn reason! (Oh, and after several of these ice cold...who the hell really cares what you're drinkin' anyway, right?!) Take care and happy sippin' my beer-lovin' friends. Ciao for now! This Bud's for you!!"
"than the contents, so do recycle."
"Clear and golden. Fair amount of carbonation and thin white head. Smell is mainly of malts, somewhat grainy. The smallest hint of hops is present as well. Taste is of sweet, somewhat tart malts. More flavor than other macro lagers. Mouthfeel seems light as it should be, though too much carbonation isn't its best match. Drinkability is close to good as it is extremely light and admittedly refreshing on a hot summer day. Yep, there are plenty of other beers I'd like to drink, but this is probably near the top among macro lagers."
"I've enjoyed this 24 ouncer and have decided further investigation is in order."
"Overall: watery, bland, characterless and no personality."
"Light mouthfeel with some slight grainyness. Would be a bit more drinkable if not for the strange aftertaste. Best when cold and very thirsty. Not a beer i would keep in my fridge."
"Pale straw yellow with some head that quickly disappears. Smells... metallic, highly highly metallic, dig deeper and you find some maltyness. Dig deeper if you dare, anyway. Taste is also metallic, very light and barely malty. Mouthfeel has a bit more to it. Overall, this is what it is- a Bud. Many drink it because it's light and goes great with food at a bbq, and it's refreshing on a hot day. Can't blame them, but... I'd still rather have a PBR, or something else similar. Cheaper, and tastes better."
"The more I learn about how beer is made, the more I can appreciate beers like this. 10 years ago I would have scoffed! Cheers!"
"It is what it is Budweiser. I tried three new single bottles tonight Harp, Bass, and Peroni. Reverting back to this crap is the worst. Like I said its a budweiser. A watery, piss colored, standard domestic redneck beer. Thumbs down for this bottle of pee water."
"Note: Somehow, on the golf course, this beer is transformed into a heavenly thirst-quenching brew - that's miraculously worth the $3 for a can. Seriously, something about the outdoors and maybe not ice ice cold brings out a fullness in the underdeveloped fruit nose and a nice sprightly taste. I read somewhere that AB uses 9 hops for this one..at least a few of those show up in the right setting."
"Es una cerveza gringa, sin cuerpo ni sabor ni nada, de las peorcitas que he probado, aunque se vende mucho y tiene muchisima publicidad, y tiene la exclusiva de los mundiales de futbol. El envase es ambar con etiqueta de papel. Hay ediciones especiales de esta cerveza como la conmemorativa al mundial lo unico que cambia es la etiqueta."
"I drank this at a party because there wasn't anything else available. Appearance is typical of an American macrobrew lager. Aroma is malty and better than I expected, but not wonderful. Taste is malty and rather wan. Though it is zingy and jazzy in the mouth, it is not a memorable beer. Well, I had to try it after drinking craft beers for so long."
"I'd call this one a little underrated. Almost as good as PBR for a macro. The color is a little to dark to look like urine, as some people like to say. Th taste has a hint (all the flavors are hints) of grains with a slight tang. The drinkability is decent and the overall experience isn't offensive. Still, this beer is one I'd only drink if given or free."
"Beef Notes: I needed something to drink with my pizza and this did the job. Not nearly as bad as Bud Light and actually quite serviceable in a pinch. Don't be afraid to crack one open if there's nothing better."
"Next please... PLEASE!"
"This beer being a macro lager , still is a very good beer,is nothing to be impress about,This beer have a light gold color with a little bit of head.Very easy to drink ,not a hard taste or a hard feeling on the mouth. Does'nt have a lot of smell. Good beer if you want to have more than one."
"DA: I had a hard time finishing this bottle, but it was slightly better than the canned version."
"Pours a straw yellow with a pure white head, which dissipates quickly. Smells of light hops, corn, and water. Tastes average really, nothing good about it but nothing bad, better than most american macro brewed lagers, especially the light ones, i think it gets a bad rap but it isn't THAT undrinkable. Mouthfell does leave something yearning."
"Years ago I thought this was the greatest beer on the market. However, I grew up and tried other kinds of beers, and my opinion of Budweiser has changed immensely. It had been a while since I tried Budweiser, so I picked up a 12 pack that was on sale the other day. What a waste of money. I don't know what I ever saw in this swill. It has to be ice cold in order for me to drink it. It's actually not too bad ice cold, but once it warms a little - forget it."
"Drinkability - Felt like I was wasting my time. Hurried the beer so I could go on to the next drink."
"I'm in college, so we drink this stuff alot (much to my dismay). It's your stereotypical macro beer. Doesn't smell very good, doesnt look very good, but you can pound them very easily. Cheap beer means you can share them when your on the college budget (like myself), but if you want to buy some cheap beer you might as well by keystone light or somethin (10 bucks a 30 pack haha), cause when you start drinking beers that are this dull they all start to taste the same."
"even before i knew anything about good beer and drank mgd and little kings all the time i hated bud. i hated how flavorless and watery it was even back then, even compared to other macros. super light in color and of course overly carbonated, necessary to balance since there is no hop character. faint vegetal and metallic aromas. no flavor to speak of, completely absent of malt or hop flavor other than some rice adjuncts detected. finishes very crisp due to the super light body and aforementioned carbonation. this is a minor step up from bud light and why would anyone drink this when clean drinking water is readily available? oh yeah, gullible ignorant ""tough"" guys love this insipid crap, along with our media saturated youth."
"Highly drinkable, not filling, I can suck quite a few of these down. Classic All American (macro) Beer."
"Drinkability: Funky smell, a nice malty sweetness in the finish, bad mouthfeel, easy to drink though."
"The King of Beers, eh? Not sure what type of kingdom this king would preside over. Appearance is inviting, to say the least, what with how we've been inundated over the years with the sight of this beer. Really light, almost neon, yellow color, with a small head that wilts after the first few sips. Smell, nothing to report. A dry, sharp acidity in the smell is noticeable. Tastes like carbonated water with just a tart, tinge of hops. Weak. Mouthfeel, none to report. This is a light lager, which could easily be consumed in mass quantities. If you're mowing the lawn and want something cold, I might pick this over water, as it does have alcohol. Also, it's a beer I'll go for if all the other offerings are Bud Light, Coors Light, etc."
"D: It's light & smooth, but I'm still not fond of the taste (even if it is light as well)."
"Pale in color with decent head and an awful smell. You could drink these all day long but why would you want to? This is a great beer if you are in high school and haven't experiend real beer, but other than that, its an extremely dissapointing beer in flavor and smell. This beer is so poor that it almost turned me off to domestic beers altogether until I found Rouge and Highland."
"Drinkability is pretty fine , as long as its not on tap you should have no problem drinking the ""real"" budweizer all night, a fine hess beer!"
"Nothing gourmet, but it doesn't taste like paint thinner either. This one's as low as I go, and that's not a put down. Decent average stuff."
"Overall, if you are mowing your lawn and have this beer ice cold, it might do the trick. Other than that, no other redeeming qualities. Under no circumstances have this at anything above freezing temperature. I let mine warm slightly and it got unpleasant very quickly."
"overall, this is not a beer that i will buy again, but served very very cold it can be rather refreshing"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and relatively easy to drink. It's just simply not very good and I don't really want to drink anymore. Overall, drinking Budweiser is a nice nostalgic trip down memory lane. Other than that, I certainly wouldn't recommend it."
"Bud has always been a drinkable beer. White thick head from tap, light fizzy head from bottle. Not impressed with the taste, never have been. It's a lot like s strong club soda. Not the worst beer, far from the best. Looks better than it tastes, bottom line."
"Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. Easy to drink, would be better with less carbonation (or more flavor!)."
"Ahh the king of beers, everyone needs a Bud right? Poured a clear yellow with a huge white head that just sank into the glass after a few seconds. Lots of visible carbonation left this at least looking halfway decent. Smell was light but what was there was of rice and grain, slightly musty. At least it had a smell, albeit muted. The taste was very bland. Almost like wet paper. Born on date said it was fine, but just did not taste well at all. Very carbonated and light, which seems to be the case with most of these macros. When they are ice cold they go down like water, when they warm its just a mess. Can really not see myself drinking this again anytime soon, if ever at all."
"This poured a golden straw color with a small head and light glass retention. The smell, taste, and mouthfeel are all what you would expect as this is the gold-standard of American macros. Everything average with nothing remotely complex or inventive, but completely run-of-the-mill. It's amusing to me that most of my friends that drink macros by the gallon hate this stuff, but those of us that enjoy our beers from the crafted variety will doen't always despise this if we are forced to choose a macro. Hey, it beats the hell out of no beer at all."
"Simply not a good beer. Looks like hell. Light and fairly complex taste, but most the nuances are unpleasant. Refreshing, yes; hydrating, yes; but I would rather just drink tap water. Although, you can't argue with the price. You get what you pay for."
"Stick to this beer on draft!!! This beer gets worse!"
"Light golden color, weak smell, and VERY weak flavor. It felt very carbonated, but because of it's weak taste, it was very drinkable (almost like water compared to other beers)."
"D - There is no point in drinking this beer. It has no taste!"
"Poured a clear straw color, not quite Corona yellow, had a small soapy white head the dissipated into nothingness. Not much of a smell, maybe a bit of adjuncts. The taste is quite neutral, and when I say neutral I mean don't taste like nothing. It has just enough malt taste in it to offset the adjunct taste, not like Bud Light. I think I may have detected a hop. It has a pretty fizzy watery mouthfeel that finishes like seltzer water. Fine cooler beer for tailgating and mass consumption."
"It's kind of worth a try, but it is an american macro."
"Notes: a good session beer but nothing more."
"Overall: Another ho-hum macro lager. Why bother?"
"It's not the worst macro lager, but I would never buy this beer on my own initiative, and wouldn't drink it unless there was a very good reason. It's very bland and inoffensive, made to appeal to every beer drinker in the world."
"not trying to slam the beer without reason, it's just gross. (it's not the style -- i'm more than happy to have a High Life or a PBR in front of me, just about any time.) this is undrinkable."
"a slightly distinguishable brew with that beechnut corn sweetness, but for a couple bucks more get Brooklyn Lager or Dortmunder gold and call it a day."
"No I didn't pour it down the drain; it isn't THAT bad. I finished the pint. But it truly is not very good beer. American Macro. Designed to be as inoffensive as possible to the largest number of people."
"Drinkability: It's very drinkable when ice cold. But as it warms up and you can actually taste and smell it, well...it ain't real pleasant."
"Anyways, here goes. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured a light yellow with no head to speak of. Lacing was non existant, except about an inch at the end of the drink. Smells like funky water. I dont know what to relate the taste to but boring watery swill. mouthfeel isnt anything to declare, but nothing to really knock either. I can drink this all day. If I were to have a party with a bunch of jocks and bros, this would probably satisfy them quite well."
"Budweiser, everyone knows it, many hate it, many love it, some don't give a rats ass about it, like me!! Pours a very weak yellow color with a lot of fuzziness. Smells like water. Tastes sweet, slightly malty and very watery. Mouthfeel like carbonated water. Overall it's quite drinkable but who really cares. Budweiser pride themselves in only using the best ingredients, but why? This is a nothing beer for tasteless folk."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is watery thin and borders on light body. The carbonation is probably the most annoying thing about this beer. I found the carbonation to be stinging. This beer wasnt the chore I thought it would be to drink. This isnt the worst beer. It is far from the King of beers. This beer has no real smells or taste to it. The body of the beer really doesnt have anything to reccomend it. If this was my only choice I think I would do without a beer."
"D- This beer is very light and clean with no malt taste and a faint hint of hops but it is not a bitterness. The biggest part of this beer is the bubbles. I'm impressed that they can high the alcohol in a beer this light."
"But don't forget that drinking too much of this alcoholic yellow water will lead to very bad things the next day. Why do Macros do such evil things to a person's digestive system?"
"Not that good, but better than I thought it would be. Tastes sweet, though not sure what from. Smells slightly sweet. Crisp and clean. Quite drinkable. Light bodied, but not as light as I was expecting. Wish I had more to say, but this beer just didn't strike me. Okay for what it is, there are definitely worse macros out there."
"This mass produced lager poours a pale light yellow, with a white head that disapated quickly. A bit of thin lacing and a crown which fades fast. Quite a bit of carbonation too. The smell is rather metallic with definite rice and malts. The taste is a bland with a bit of a harsh hoppy aftertaste which I found frankly nasty. It's crisping and watery with very little body. It's fairly refreshing, maybe after a number of pints of the good stuff, but clearly not something I would drink. I merely tried it because I had the opportunity to review it."
" but so is water."
"D: Low ABV and relative lack of taste make this a session beer that appeals to millions of people. I must admit, it does go down easy. It's also pretty tasty at a cookout. However, there are much better alternatives within the macro lager category."
"Finished crisp and clean, since it really didnt get warm in the cup with the freezing weather. Only really drinkable if you keep it ice cold. Must be the beach wood aging."
"Drinkability: Even though I hate this beer, something was done right cause it is one of the biggest selling beer in the world. So for drinkability the statistics say yes while I say no. This beer has no tastefull malt, no presence of hops of any kind, has a nasty after taste, is watery and lifeless. The only thing that is respectfull about this beer is its filtering and the fact that AB sat down and came up with a recipe that try to offend the least amount of people to make it the #1 most bought beer in the world. (its still awful)"
"Drinkability is the best part of a Budweiser. No offensive tastes, clean finish. Can't really complain when it comes down to realizing that this is a macrolager."
"Looks like your typical American Macro. Smells like it. Taste is better than it looks or smells, but I won't flatter. Mouth is bubbles and water. On a hot summer day, I will have it, if it's the last thing available. Chances are, if you are drinking this and posting a review, your buddy gave you this and it was your only choice."
"I really tried to be objective and review solely on what was in the glass, not what was on the label. In all honesty the only thing that even remotely reminded me of beer was the color and modest head. There was a vague recollection of hops in the aroma, almost as if this beer had talked to a hop plant in some dark, forgotten history. Beyond the appearance of a classic pilsner, any trace of the genes of the true lagers from Europe is long since been bred out of this beer. The taste and mouthfeel made me think of a Jones Soda that is ""beer"" flavored. The carbonation in this beer is way overdone; as if it had just come out of a bottle with a Co2 canister attached. This beer might be suitable to pour into a large pot for a crab boil, but only if you add enough other seasonings."
"Slainte!"
"Going to drink a St. Bernardus Prior 8 in an attempt to free my abused tastebuds."
"Notes: I admire this beer for its clean aroma and flavor. It takes some brewing skill (and the right equipment) to produce something as clean and consistent as this. However, I've always found the flavor of Budweiser and the like to be quite objectionable. I can barely finish 12 ounces of this."
"Drink-Ability: Very cheap good beer to drink if you just want to get buzzed."
"I'd drink this beer once in every blue moon for its alcohol and that's about it. And in that event I'd go with something quite a bit cheaper like Schlitz or Old Style."
"Overall, it is what it is. An American Macro than serves it's purpose but isn;t exactly a Beer Advocate brew."
"Budweiser was pale yellow in color with a white head. The head quickly dissipated to a very thin layer and eventually became just a thin ring. The aroma was very light with a little grain. The taste was light as well, crisp and clean with a dry finish. It did not taste bad, but there is just not much there to taste. The mouthfeel was light and highly carbonated. Drinkability was about average, much better than a light beer. Overall I would not recommend Budweiser to anyone that actually likes beer."
"overall taste and drinkability are passabe but not to my liking.... if it's the only thing available.... I'll drink it.... but most times I'll take a pass."
"I realize that this beer outsells anything in the U.S. hands down, but I've never been much of an AB fan, even long before I gained an appreciation for craft beer. I like the fact that it is American owned, but megacorporations like AB and Wal Mart are just bad in general. I digress. A: Standard yellow low carbonated American lager appearance. S: A little hoppier than many american macros with a definite corn aroma with something that I would characterize as beechwood? T: Pretty smooth mild with a nice clean finish really not too bad. M: Clean and crisp nice carbonation balance D: In the past if Bud approached warmer temps I would pitch it, but this session it actually seemed to improve when not ice cold. I was surprised to say the least how much I liked this beer. It still pains me to patronize AB, but if I find myself in a pinch for selection(Mom and pop markets at the lake are a prime example), I will now consider something that I previously would not have."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- To its credit, the carbonation is restrained just to the right degree... there is much action and life, but it doesn't wreck the inside of the mouth. Soft yet busy. The watery finish is a letdown, and it emphasizes the adjuncts in a negative way. Not a good beer for waxing poetic over, just another mass-produced American macro offering for the majority who will settle."
"Fizzy Yellow beer, the only thing going for it is it's availability and drinkability. Same everytime, everywhere, whatever serving. Everybar, including some of the best beer bars, carry this or Bud Light. I don't recommend it but, it is what it is."
"This beer pours a clear golden yellow with a large white foamy head. It's not too bad looking,but the color is too light. The smell is were the big macros really go belly up. There is almost no smell at all in this,maybe a small scent of corn or sweet malt,but that's it. The taste is crisp and clean with sweet malt, corn, and floral flavors. The m/f is light and what little flavors there are mix well. Bud is very drinkable, you can say what you want,but it goes down easy,when cold, it's everywhere, and you can drink alot of it. Budweiser is what it is. A large macro that appeals to the masses. It's not great,but it has its place in the beer kingdom."
"Im quite surprised at the number of >3 reviews for this beer!"
"Notes"
"D: This may be a very light beer and extremely light on flavor, but in no way does it taste bad. Not something I'd go out of my way to get, but I am not ashamed in any way to drink them from time to time."
"Its drinkable, but far from great."
"While the drinkability is very high, the thinness of the brew is it's final downfall."
"Get my buzz on-no"
"D- I prefer this to the Light. No frills here as it has to sacrifice almost all character to appeal to the 50% of the market it dominates. Very quenchable and easy to drink. This beer probably took your beer-cherry. Ah, the memories."
"Overall: Not a good lager by any stretch. Not easy to drink with no redeeming qualities. Im no AB or Macro Lager hater - if this was a good beer my review would reflect that."
"This is the epitome of an unimpressive American beer. That said, this is also the least bad of the products manufactured by the Big 3. If I'm somewhere where my choices are limited to Coors, Miller and AB products (and the ubiquitous Corona) and I simply must have a beer, I'll take a Bud. I doubt I need to explain its characteristics to anyone."
"2/24/07 Update: Had Bud in a tall neck with recent date of making. Sorry, no improvement. Still holding out for draft."
"Drinkability: Up there with the best. How can anyone honestly say otherwise?"
"I guess considering the style, this beer isn't that bad... Pours a light golden yellow color, with a tiny head with almost no retention and a tiny bit of lacing (poured from a can into a mug). The beer smells like a typical macro lager...and very weak. The taste is also typical of the style..nothing too impressive, but what do you expect? Definately a ricey taste to it. Very crisp, with a good amount of carbonation. A typical ""go to the party, get drunk, who cares about the taste"" beer...if thats what you want...drink it."
"Well, actually do I have time to think about that before deciding?"
"D - Not bad. A generally inoffensive if flavourless beer. I guess this is what macro lagers are all about."
"Overall not too bad but far from great. I wouldnt buy it."
"This one is very drinkable, but not too exciting. If you swapped it with water, I may of never noticed. Its a good beer when there are no other options, and you just want to get drunk. If you want something good to drink (and can't find another type of beer), get a glass of water, its cheaper."
"D- Easy to drink. Macro beer designed to be drunk in large quantities. Not a bad choice among American macro beers."
"I could drink this but I would get bored by the time I finished it I wouldn't want another. I just glad I don't actually buy this one. It would be a waste of my money."
"the drinkability was not good at all and yea thats really all there is to say about that so if you like it what ever but its not my first choice let's put it that way..."
"As a beer in general, there is many other better beers out there. But for a Macro, it's really not that bad."
"Budweiser is a great selling product due to the relentless advertising that appears everywhere you turn. It has wide availability and it will likely continue to sell in spite of its many flaws. I drink it only when I have no other choice. Otherwise, the so- called ""King of Beers"" is not permitted to dine at my table. I'll take a lesser- known microbrewed beer any day."
"Had one for the hell of it awhile back. Poured that nasty, putrid looking American Macro color of dehydrated piss. Head was all big bubbles, didn't have any retention. Albeit, better than its light counterpart. Smell is really nothing, a bit corny, but not as strong as Miller's offerings. The taste is decent, kind of malty, and primarily adjuncty however. The mouthfeel? Water, just like anything else produced by AB. Drinkability is the only high part of this beer. If your looking to throw a party or whatever, and don't want to slip below Natty Light, this or Coors Original is what you wanna go with! Usually on sale in some sort of different packing. For the love of god, I don't know why people pick this up in the 22 oz can all the time. A 40 must be hell!"
"This beer pours a rich golden color with a light lace of head. The head stuck around until I was finished. It had a faint smell of sweet grain but not much of any other smell. It tasted fairly common place with a grainy malt flavor but unlike many caned beers there wasnt much of a metallic aftertaste. It has a bubbly feel and a smooth texture. Over all it has been around as long as it has for a reason. Its a finely drinkable beer that would appeal to most people. Its not too complex but it has a decent taste."
"ok here is the one and only King of Beers, well I dont know where they came up with that tag line, this doesn't taste like it should carry that tag line. Poured into a pint glass, yellow and fizzy with a head that recedes in less than 5 seconds, no lace left. Taste is of malt with corn added to it not very tasty. I like to avoid this Loser of beers at all costs."
"¡Salud!"
"It sort of quenches a thirst and I can drink it when only American macros are available, or in a pinch - but, it really lacks character and a good taste."
"Drinkability is something like this....could I session it...no....could I chug it at a frat party...yep"
"Drinkability: Easy drinker just kinda boring and not very appealing tastewise. It's kinda the beer you'd drink after you just got done mowing the grass. Also I'd say it's better in the can/bottle."
"I can see why it's been about 10 years since I had one of these... and it'll probably be atleast that long until I have one again."
"Every now and then I go down to the local biker bar and drink a couple of beers. All the bikers down there drink Bud because it makes them look tough. If your a biker, looking tough, especialy in front of your buddies, is big medicine. What do I drink when I go down there?...Bud of course...Hell, I'm in a biker bar."
"Anyhow, I don't know that I have ever bought this beer until this weekend. I wanted to try some beers that are mainstream and that I haven't had before. I picked up a 24 ounce can of Bud and got exactly what I paid for: yellow, low flavor, low hops, consistently brewed macro lager. Being a hot day, it went down smooth."
"D - Easy drinking as they say in the ads. I could drink 20 of these at a baseball game anyday."
"Pours a pale yellow with little carbonation and has minimal head which thins out to pretty much a single layer of bubbles with a little more on the side. Looks like water with a drop off yellow food coloring. Has a sweetier malty smell than I remember and has a faint piney hop aroma also. The taste is much stronger than I remember also and kinda just sits in your mouth, but not necessarily a good thing in this case. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated and acidity and kinda burns in the back of the throat. The beer isn't very well balanced. This beer could be a bit better if the flavor and carbonation were balanced a little better."
"M&D: rather sharp on the mouthfeel and extremely thin-bodied, leaving an artificial feel down the palate, although at least it doesnt have too much negative bearing from the cheap adjuncts (like sticky or chemical...). Now I know why its not liked (to say the least) by so many people who know their beers. It's definitely the bland-est beer Ive ever had, so much so that even those cheap replicates of this legend taste more exciting than this. Simply boring and bland, not worth my single penny on it."
"I probably would never drink this again."
"Big head that does not retain well save a small crown. Pale, pale yellow straw color. Not much there to smell. The faintest grains. Same with the flavor, you really have to let it linger to get any flavor. The mildest of hops. Everything that survives the watery base is overwhelmed by the fizz. A little bready malt on the finish is the only thing that separates it from the lite. Perhaps slightly fuller mouthfeel too but that might be a reach. To its credit you know what you are getting and it always tastes the same. Its also incredibly easy to drink."
"Refreshing."
"Even with the little chunks of ice floating in it, it was very quaffable. It was cold and refreshing and went well with the pizza. If I have to drink macro, it might as well be a Bud."
"drinkability.. .. .my last one was 4 years ago!"
"D: Decent but not as high as PBR or High Life. I'll stick with them in the future when free squid isn't a factor."
"drinkability = this beer is chock full of impurities and preservatives that give me a massive headache."
"I would reach for a PBR or Molson before I reached for a Bud."
"Ultimately a clean refreshing american lager that defines the style well, promotes itself to ready drinkability quite well without being too watery and with no other clearly discernible faults."
"I pray to God I never drink this again."
"Hmmm, were to begin? Why would some one drink a ""Bud""? Well lets just say it was there and leave it at that. Pours a clear light gold color. There was a nice fizzy head, I won't say foamy as while this was a good size it was lacking in density. The smell is yuck, nothing but corn or rice or what ever adjunct has been added to this brew. The smell does not bring to mind, malts or hops. Taste is bland, no flavor of desire comes through. The mouthfeel is crisp. Beware what you reach for, as you might get one of these, when there are far better American Macros out there."
"Overall, it is the ""king"" of American macro brewing, so I give credit for that, but praising macro-brewed American beer is a backhanded compliment indeed."
"Taste is really mellow with a crisp and dry body with lots of carbonation. Mainly grainy. I think Bud fits the profile of a american macro pretty well."
"However, with limited choices and friends egging me on, I took one can. I've been drinking heavier stuff lately, so it tasted like water. Slightly flavored water, but still. So I suppose Bud is drinkable, it's just not good. It's appeal is that it has no flavor and it's cheap, like McDonald's. We all cheat a little on our diets. So, Bud is the guilty pleasure of the Beer Nut. After all, it could be worse. It could have a taste."
"And, yes, if they had the reach, MGD would try to take over the World Cup too - blame FIFA, not Bud."
"The perennial pale US maco lager...thats all it is and it fills that niche well....if you come at it from any other frame of reference you destroy your objectivity"
"So what does Budweiser taste like? Almost nothing really. Bud has a ""clean"" taste compared to the bottom rung beers... but tastes rather impure compared to what brewers are capable of. It's easy to see why it's so popular, but for anyone who is looking to experience ""beer", there is little to offer. Hops aren't present, and neither are the malts. Just rather bland beer."
"-UF"
"I'm supporting my local macro-brewery, since AB has a facility in Columbus. This Budweiser was from a Dale Jr. 22 oz bottle, served in a weizen glass. It pours a light yellow/gold color, with a inch or so head. Even a minute or so after pouring the beer, there is still a bit of carbonation, with little bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass to the top. It smells pretty much like most macro products, with a corn/grainy smell. It's a very light beer, with a thin watery mouthfeel. It goes down extremely easy, very drinkable. Not much flavor at all, and not much aftertaste either. The only flavor I could really tell was the grainy/adjunct flavor of most macro-beers. I guess that's not completely a bad thing, because it is pretty non-offensive and easy to drink. The Budweiser was dated about 3 months since the born-on date, but it tasted the same as fresher Bud I've had. It's OK for a macro-lager. A good session beer if you want to drink something without too much taste to it. Nothing great, but there are worse beers out there."
"Pours a pale neon yellow with a thin, fizzy head that settles out quick. Really faint aromas of grain and rice, but it's very subtle. Very weak flavors that were present in the nose, but this has a nice and crisp flavor, nevertheless. Extremely dry in the finish with a bit of bitterness, surprisingly. Mouthfeel is typical: light and bubbly. This is a lot better than I remembered, honestly. It is far from being really flavorful, but I could easily knock these back with glee."
"a few scores updated 7-7-08 after a nice time having a few Buds on a July 4th trip to Oriental, NC"
"Light golden color, similar to hard cider, but with a slighly nicer head. It has a grainy smell, no hops noticeable. Taste is dry and inoffensive, no real malty flavor, just the light graininess. Overall a pretty drinkable beer, although I wouldn't pay for it, I'll drink it when its left in my fridge."
"Avoid this beer if at all possible, possibly the worst lager I have ever had."
"average.."
"As I said, its about the best you can get for your money."
"Overall: Before I ventured into the realm of beeradvocacy, this was my favorite. And still, when I'm stuck at a party or in a bar with only macro swill to drink, this is what I reach for. And why not? budweiser is has infinitely better flavor than its ligher (or liter) cousins. For what it is, a mass marketed beer made with the intent of broad appeal, there's still a good amount of flavor packed inside, it's still very drinkable, and I have trouble not enjoying it. On the other hand, there's nothing memorable about the beer, no flavor that sticks out and makes you say ""Oh yeah, that's why I like budweiser."" Also, from my pre-beeradvocacy experiences, I can say that this beer, when consumed in large quantities, will produce a monster hangover."
"For a nice summer day with a college students' wallet, this beer works."
"Goes down smooth, no aftertaste. I have had many on a nice warm day and while I dont think it is the ""King of Beers"" it is one of my favorite Macro Brews"
"Hey, it's budweiser, what can you expect. They lie on every add, well, coors lies a little more. Bud is actual drinkable if you haven't had any micros beforehand. Has a little taste, no smell, no hops, not much life. But if you're gonna drink an american macro, bud should probably be the choice."
"Pours an almost crystal clear pale yellow. Nothing distinctive at all. The Narragansett I just had was more appealing. Not much at all in the smell department. I do enjoy the taste of a Budweiser now and again though, especially in the summer or at a baseball game or watching football. This is the easy drinking beer for the masses and although I don't reach for it often, I never turn it down either."
"Keep an open mind."
"Bottom line. This beer is not very good and there's no excuse for how boring and flavorless it is. This is just another example of the old addage that if you try to brew a beer that will offend no one, ultmatley you'll make a beer that appeals to no one."
"Realistically, people drink 'bud' because they think they are the all-American for it, which is a horrible reason to drink budweiser. The image of the hardened American backwood dweller is not something to be proud of...and associating Budweiser with yourself? Shows you haven't had that much to drink."
"This beer is supposed to be a full flavored beer. It tastes really watered down. I compared it to an MGD in a bar, and liked the MGD a lot better. Bud has no taste to it IMO. I think it's more for people who don't like a lot of beer taste in their beer. It has a nice flavor and is really smooth and has a nice crispness. I could knock these back all night with no problem and not care, but I prefer other beers over this one."
"Look, we all know this beer and what it represents. However, for all its problems - and they are legion - it's not completely offensive. I'm drinking a little 7oz. pony bottle as I write this, along with the aforementioned turkey sandwich and a cup of coffee (lunchtime). I think the pony+sandwich+coffee makes a good lunch: the flavors all play off each other and there's so little alcohol involved it doesn't interfere with the afternoon's work."
"Not all of us can afford to spend $8 or more for a sixpack all the time. When I can't get my high class stuff, I won't cry over having to buy a halfrack of Bud."
"People need to quit drinking this beer."
"This beer had a moderate head that didn't last long and the color was light. The aroma was fairly weak and smelled faintly of the malt. The taste wasn't very hoppy and had a thin body to it. The mouthfeel felt about average and had a moderate to high carbonation to it. As far as drinkability goes, I think this beer would be adequate for those who just want to have a reasonably priced macro lager that atleast has a bit more body to it than light lagers."
"¡Salud!"
"Crystal clear and very light yellow, it looks kind of like watered down apple juice. The fluffy white head dissipated rapidly. Faint malt in the nose, along with a hint of apple and alcohol. Light grainy malt and just a whiff of hop bitterness and sweetness at the end. Just a bit of fruit here as well. Thin body, crisp carbonation and very clean. This isn't as terrible as many believe, just incredibly boring with a thin flavour. I've had some very nice ""light"" beers from smaller brewers lately with delicate flavours and light bodies that completely outclass this beer."
"After you have crossed over into the world of good beer, it is kind of hard to go back to the BMC crowd."
"If going strictly by style for review give it 4.5s this is the best of the big mass produced macro lagers."
"Tastes- Very light... Some corn/rice and a very light hop bitterness. Very one-dimensional as expected, but drinkable as it goes down pretty easy with no awful tastes coming through. Another positive is that it's pretty fresh tasting."
"King indeed! Maybe it isn't the best beer available, but it may very well be the easiest beer to drink, and its popularity no longer mystifies me. It is underrated on this site, I think, but mostly because of the tarnished reputation of the mega-brewer that makes it, and its tendency towards crass, lowest common denominator marketing. Thats easy to overlook though, with the beer this enjoyable and the label this classy. Budweisers biggest drawback is its hefty price; outside of special sales, a 30-pack costs $21 in glamorous Worcester, MA. A-B engages in a regular price increase for its brews, and as a result it may eventually be in danger of pricing its bread and butter brand out of its intended market."
"I can drink this beer for days. Budweiser is what it is: a mass-produced lager fit for the working man. It is certainly light, lacking any of the characteristics most beer connoiseurs ask for in a beer. But Budweiser is the everyday man's beer. It's made of rice, and the finest hops anyone can grow in their backyard, but it's still good. I've spent many a sweaty day, working in my yard, or on my truck, just waiting for the reward i would get from Budweiser. Call the beer simple, or call me simple, i love this beer. It's ultra light straw color, utterly scentless nose, and rustic grainy flavor do nothing for me but quench the thirst in my belly. I'm certainly not writing this to advertise for them, they do enough of that on their own. Simply put, it's the best worst beer out there. And to get a taste of America, crack open a cold Bud."
"Well well, the king of beers? An intruiging statement, I had to give it a try... So I didn't bother pouring it, sorry. It was actually a little darker than my expectancy, so extra points for that. The smell, nothing special, hard to pick out anything from it. Mostly a faint hoppiness. The taste is basically the same. Nothing too spectacular going on, but hey what do you expect? It is a good crisp beer, refreshing for sure, not too heavy, giving a good drinkability to it. For what it is attempting, a cheap and crisp beer that's refreshing every time, it passes with flying colors."
"D: More unpleasant than the light variety. Leaves an unpleasant aftertaste, but it works well with spicy food. I've tasted a lot worse beers, craft and macro, but this one isn't going to be in my fridge regularly, although I occasionally have one when eating out. If you're going to drink it, drink it ice-cold."
"Nothing special to look at--a truly piss-yellow with a white head. The smell is sweet and overly-floral...and very overly synthetic. Not much taste to speak of, or what taste there might be is covered by WAY too much carbonation. Hints of vinegar are present between the overpowering, disruptive carbonation. You gotta be pretty desperate to drink this."
"Taste is crisp, clean with a bit of grain. Quick finish doesn't linger long on the palate. Served cold with a pizza, it's actually a pretty refreshing beer that doesn't demand much of the consumer. Doesn't have that sweet flavor that a lot of macros have. Not bad for the style."
"Appearance is prototypical AML, heavily carbonated straw. Grainy and malty smell, slightly sweetm, Bud reminds you that drinking beer is like drinking bread. That breadiness dominates the taste, along with hops bitterness. Highly carbonated, malt finish... Not a whole lot to be said for a beer everyone knows so well. I don't care what anyone says, on a hot day when you're fishing or sailing, Bud out of a can has a certain charm. Still a hell of a lot better than all of the light beers out there."
"Color is pale yellow w/ a slight head that dissipates pretty quickly. The smell is grainy and slightly sweet. The taste is a little bitter; lots of carbonation. It goes down easy and would be fine to have really cold with a burger or hot dog on a summer day. However, like most would agree, it's not a flavorful beer, and if you're used to higher end stuff, this will surely dissapoint you."
"boring boring boring. goes down smooth though, a good beer to cook your brats in."
"it does go down easily, and as mch as A-B is the devil around these parts, it's really not a bad beer."
"Verdict- Inoffensive and reasonably flavorful for a canned beer."
"Wow. It's been a while since I've had a bud. It's even worse than I remember. A buddy had been using this stuff to cook bratwurst in, and left some cans in my fridge. I thought, what the hell, I'll just drink one. It'll be tasteless and boring, but oh well. Well, it was worse than that. I couldn't finish the 16 oz. can--I just didn't have the heart after about half the can. Luckily, a buddy came by and he shotgunned the remaining brew. Don't drink Bud, even if it's been left in your fridge. Cook with it, donate it to a needy frat, whatever, just don't drink it."
"This beer poured a very pale yellow color with a large head that dissipated quickly. The bubbles rising to the top of the glass were quite large and the head did not stick to the sides of the glass, which is typical for this style of beer. The aroma was fruity, with the trademark smell of adjuncts. Taste was also quite fruity, with a good bit of sweetness. Is this a wine cooler? I could not detect any hop character and very little malt taste. This brew is very light bodied and I guess would be a good choice after mowing the lawn. Next time I'm in the mood for a light lager, I'll go for an all malt beer instead."
"DI think it is very drinkable, there is nothing offensive about this beer. It just doesnt have the bolder flavors that I like in a beer. I can understand its popularity and would drink this again if it were offered to me (and there were no micro/crafts available)."
"Drinkability - Out of all of the macro lagers, perhaps the most drinkable beer. I have yet to get tired of it and is great after a warm day or when your friends come over. (07/09 Edit: used to be drinkable, but after tasting other macros, there are much better tasting drinks for the price)"
"The best thing about the aluminum bottle is that the beer is (or feels) a lot colder. And this is good on a summer day. Makes it easier to drink, that's for sure. Other than that, no major difference between this and the bottle. It'll do for parties or a cheap(er) drink at the watering hole."
"This is not the King of Beers, as labled....trust me. Maybee it was back in the 1800's when you had but 2 other brands to choose from: The color is as any other, a light fizzy yellow. The smell was too skunky for a macro. The taste was for the most part like tap watter with a ABV. The mouthfeel is too dry and what I would call as being light with no bite. Drinkability? Nill... For the Money it's a waste."
"The drinkability of this beer is ok. Its definitely not something that I'd ever really want to buy, unless I was hosting a party. Infact, I took this can from a party. It is however really easy to drink and goes down easy, you could drink this forever, but would you want to? I don't recommend this beer to anybody, unless you are a fan of macros. If that is the case and all you drink is macros, then this may well be the ""king of beers"" as far as your knowledge of beer goes."
"Bottom line: this is what I drink at sporting events when I've forgotten my flask and all the other beers are ""lite"" offerings."
"After drinking so much craft beer lately, why not pick up a bottle of good old Budweiser? Poured straight into the bottom of the glass with a light gold straw color and a pretty nice white head that ate itself away quickly. Smell was of sweet sugars and cereal grain. Taste was very crisp and sweet with the minute amount of flavors fading within a moment. Hop presence was pretty slim...I think if they heightened it a bit this would be a much tastier beer. Mouthfeel was very very light and easy on the palate. On a positive note, this beer is really easy to drink, with the low alcohol content, one could drink quite a few of these without becoming too intoxicated. King of all beers? Hell no, but even so, this is a simple beer that is easy to drink, cheap and a real thirst quencher. It might not be the most flavorful beer, but any beer lover shouldn't feel deterred by the fact that it is such a popular, run of the mill brew. Cheers"
"Ah, the king of beers. What can one say about Bud, its beer for the masses, probably one of the best known brands in the world. Unfortunately, its brewed for the lowest common denominator. Poured pale yellow with thick white head. Has a somewhat sweet taste. About as inoffensive and uninteresting a brew as one could find. Great for keg parties and barbeques, but I'd usually rather drink something else."
"A regularly consistent beer. You know what you are getting here. I've had this beer so many times over the years. Certainly not a quality and complex beer, but a beer option that you can find just about anywhere at anyplace."
"well, guess i was right all the time. cant remember the last time i had one of these, but i probably will have forgotten this by the time i have another."
"I will say however, i think its fucked up the way they control the beer market. Their massive marketing and distributor monopolies seem to stiffle the efforts of craft breweries who love EVERYTHING about what they do and deserve a fair shot. I don't know... i guess im just reviewing the beer here."
"Like most american BAs out there ive had a relationship with bud as long as ive had a relationship with beer. I have had in cans, in bottles on tap, in nips, pints, tall boys, cannons, you name it. I dont drink it much any more but i dont revile it. Its probably the most consistent beer in the world, and thats pretty impressive. Its refreshing after you finished digging a big hole, or spent a whole day putting fiberglass insulation in a cramped attic space in the middle of july. But for the purpose of savoring the craft of brewing, ill look elswhere. Theres a beer for every day and a day for every beer."
"Clear yellow with a decent white head that falls to scattered bubbles after a few minutes. Smell is almost non-existent, a little clean water, a touch of malt or adjuncts. Taste is crisp, carbonic, and, again a bit boring. About a third of the way through, the middle to end of the taste started to wear on me. The carbonation, combined with a grassy bittering (not in a good hoppy way) started getting in the way. While not spit it out bad, it made me not want another. Mouthfeel was thin and crispy as expected. Drinkability is ok. I think I'd have to develop a taste for the ""corn soda"" aspect of this before I could rate that higher."
"How am I going to say 250 words about this beer? let me tell when I think Bud in a bottle is not a bad call. If you've got to go lawnmower, you could do worse. The bottle imparts something nice about this beer. I would never pour it into a glass. What messed up person would pour a Bud from a bottle to a glass? If there eveer was an inviting beer bottle to drink from, this is it. It obscures the incredibly pale piss colored beer that it is in a sexy daark shroud with a 5 star logo in good ole red white and blue. Drink it from the bottle, it goes down pretty well, if you drink it quickly. If you drink several it gets even better. It's a good buisness lunch beer. Shows you have no intention of getting buzzed and your down with the common man. Plus they pay a lot of ball players salaries and help get games aired on TV, so the company is cool, kinda. All the same, I don't keep it around unless my brother needs a chaser. It's a good chaser. I think it mixes well with whisky too."
"To date, Budwieser is consistently the worst beer I have ever had. Aside from one or two badly skunked Heinekens I've had, there hasn't even been any competition. If I had to drink either a cold Budwieser, or even a warm ""Beast"" (Milwalkee's Best if you've never been to a party paid for by college students who don't work) I'd take the Beast. The fact that anyone who's not a raving alcoholic voluntarily pays money to drink this crap (let alone that its far and away the best selling beer in the world) boggles my mind. First the color: It's a bright yellow that lends it self well to the use of the word ""piss"" as an adjective. Really, I don't find the color objectionable for its own sake. But the taste I've been conditioned to associate with that color is so bad it makes the color like a warning flag: if your beer is this color, don't drink it! And I will say that light, bright yellow has got to be the least beerlike color I've ever seen from a drink that we call beer. The smell is also objectionable because it hints at what to come. Fans would probably use words like ""crisp"" or ""clean"". Detractors like to use the word ""piss"" again. Me, I think it smells like alcohol that someone's spilled some not too strong but not pleasant household cleaners into. The taste is what kills me. That bitter gall combined with the disgusting chemical background and the cheap corn-rice-whatever adding just the tiniest bit of sweetness is what makes Bud so horrible. If I really try I can choke one down, but its hard to think of a realistic reason why I'd want to. Unlike a lot of people, I find the taste very strong, and it accumulates. Eventually it produces an almost physical reaction, and getting that last bit of sludge and foam down is especially hard. That's why I rated the mouthfeel and drinkability so low. The awful taste crowds out the light body and ruins the drinkability. How bad is Bud? Even if I have a dozen or more drinks and get competely hammered, I can still tell how completely awful it is. At this point I would not drink Budwieser at all. I think I would rather drink water or go entirely thirsty if my only alternative was Bud."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a very very light yellow color, almost like they forgot to add all the coloring. Has a very thin layer of head that disappears pretty quickly. Not a particularly great start. Smells slightly of yeast, a little grassy, but really there's not much aroma to it at all. The taste really isn't that bad, it's just that there really isn't much. Most of the flavor is in the form of sweetness that I doubt really comes from a whole lot of malt. Tastes like all adjunct. But no flavor is better than bad flavor, as I've said before. The mouthfeel is a little heavier than water with very little carbonation hit. Good if you aren't looking for any sensation at all. All in all, it's very drinkable as it tries very hard not to offend anyone by not having anything to say at all. For a macro beer for people that don't like beer, it's not bad. But I'm a beer drinker who likes beer, so it's not for me."
"This is lower end even as macro's are concerned. The color was like any other, light yellow. The smell offended my nose. The taste was for the most part nonexistent. The mouthfeel was not good enough to consider drinking often. Drinkability? Often times I will give a macro higher scores in this area. But this would be a exception. I could not drink these anymore. If you want a macro, look elsewhere."
"But, if you dig it, hey, knock yourself out. Don't let me get in your way."
"This is it, the King of Beers!! Actually, this was my LAST beer I had to drink to finish up my Beer Club at a local pizza pad and watering hole so it was worth the $50 gift certificate I now get for drinking (or at least buying) them all. Honestly, the first three sips weren't bad and reminded me of good times tailgating at ND games. Then it went downhill and never gained steam again. I've got nothing more crititcal to write that hasn't been written 421 times before."
"Nothing to see here folks. Move along."
"Pours a clear yellow, fizzy white head, no lace, sparkly. Smell is sweet, corn, honey and a little citrus. Taste is almost non-existant, some sweet honey, corn, rice, little citrus, basically just bland and tasteless. Mouthfeel is light bodied, highly carbonated, generally lame."
"Hmmm... not much to say here except... Its beer? The bottle is a little better than the can, but that is expected, I'd say draft is the best way to ""enjoy"" this. It smells like rice, like most american beers do. I poured it into a glass and wasnt satisfied, even my pilsner glass was mad at me. hardly any smell, well I take that back, it smells like high school or a bowling alley, ah I know, a KORN concert. Really no hops or malt, kinda like water with bubbles. It's good if you are on a budget or are just looking to get wasted in your friends basement. I wouldnt recommend this beer...blah"
"Indy :o)"
"Taste of a very little amount of malt, mostly corny and whatever. Very small amount of hops. This beer probably wouldn't be so bad it it had more hop bite to it."
"We have had this pouring in my Firehouse for the last 100 years. I have to say that on tap, unlike virtually every other tap macro product, Bud simply sucks. Massively over carbonated with an overly heavy, almost oily composition for the product, this mass macro is sure to leave you wanting for more and wanting for less of cerebral pulsations. Highly disappointing on tap, the product is better tasting in every other available packaging known to mankind. Yes even the dreaded aluminum can."
"not impressed, but not repulsive. easy going down but i give it a low drinkability score because it's SO BORING. if you give me 1 minute i can name 100 beers with more taste and more character that would be more fun to drink."
"So leave it alone, if you don't like it then don't drink it but certainly don't bag it for doing what its trying to do well."
"It is not surprising that Craft beers are becoming popular in the US if this is the standard fare"
"Poured a pale yellow color with a head the dissipated fast. The only aroma that I smelled was just some kind of sweet smell. Not sweet hops or malt, just sweet. The taste was that of bland grains and nothing else. The mouthfeel was that of an average macro, watery and light. Since this beer is cheap, you could drink a couple of these in a sitting."
"Budweiser does compare favorably, in my opinion, to Coors, Miller, and many other mass American lagers, in that it has no unpleasant character. Thus I give it a slightly below-average score. Nothing especially good, but nothing too bad either. Just.... mediocre."
"Mouthfeel is smooth but very light and watery, might even be considered refreshing. There is very little bad to be said about this beer -- it is decent and clean -- but there is also very little good to contribute as it is too much ""like sex in a canoe."""
"So thirst quenching but gosh darnit thats not why beer was invented. Better than the other macros, but not the ""King of Beers"" by any means."
"I only had one pint. Absolutely boring, just like crappy Canadian macros. Maybe better in that there arent any nasty vegetal flavors, just rice."
"I didn't expect the ""King of Beers"" to be this underwelming. It pours a fairly deep gold color. The beer has a fair amount of a frothy head which suggests carbination. The head doesn't stick around long however. The smell is bad, sickly sour. The taste isn't very strong at all. It reminded me of a light beer. The blandness of rice is there but no hops. It is very drinkable, which is the best quality of this beer. The hops do show up once the beer gets a little wamer. This decreases the drinkability however because it also turns sharp and sour like the smell, besides nobody wants warm beer. So basically this beer is only good for some ice cold chuging. I would never buy it myself but I guess it is a good party beer because it is weak and appeals to the average High School student."
"For it's category, availability, and cost.. this is one of the best in it's class. Nothing can touch it on a hot summer day, and the aluminum cans can go virtually anywhere. And don't bother putting it in a glass.. it's best to drink it straight from the bottle or can. Gourmet beers have their place, but Bud should be appreciated and enjoyed for what it is."
"This beer was not that bad either. You can sense the rice in it, bud it is actually good, not great, but is a new sensation in your tongue. NOt like other beers with rice aditives. Actually it made it a little more interesting than more beers from macros. The only bad thing is about the name stealling, but the label is nice."
"Budweiser, the king of beers, well not quite. Before I really got to know beer this was my favorite beer. Now that I have experienced a much more broad range of beers I have changed my tune. Its a decent beer, boarderline good. It does bring back some very good memories, but overall just an average beer."
"Although the taste isn't too bad, the feeling that this stuff gives your mouth is unforgiveable."
"Drinkablity: Overall, the beer is easy to consume -- almost no taste and absolutely nothing offensive about it. It feels good in the mouth and is light and non-filling. I gave this beer a low score on drinkablity because there is nothing about it that would make me desire another. I do believe that it is possible to make a beer like this more interesting without departing from the basic style paradigm."
"Pours a very pale yellow, would have thought this was a light beer had I not know any better. Active carbonation forms a thin lacy white head. Not much going on in the nose at all. Maybe tiny traces of grain, corn to be specific. Very bland in taste as well. Is rather sweet, again, taste small traces of corn. A decent body for a macro, and I could easily put a few of these down (not that I would want to). Overall, not good, but not terrible. It does what it sets out to, I suppose, and that is giving the American public a beer that can go down easy and often."
"As someone put it, this is rather water with an infusion of beer taste than a beer itself (tastewise not with regards of it's ABV)."
"This is like getting shot in the face with a corn gun. Best drunk when screaming at a football game and eating hot wings, so as to mask the flavor."
"it is the worse beer than I have proven in my life, its flavor to rice, also lets much flavor to me to sugar I do not recommend it, all the beers of anheuser busch know me the same thing , this beer forme not had a appeararance, smell, taste or mouthfeel."
"Overall I can't see myself ever buying another Budweiser again, I paid my ticket for the ride, took the trip, and walked away with no thrills, and yet no spills. Mediocre to the extreme, the wishy-washy middle road. The Charlie Brown of beers in fact, always talks a good game but continually fails to kick that football in the end. I have no doubt in my mind that they spend unfathomable amounts of money to produce this beer, to use quality ingredients, to maintain state-of-the-art sanitized production facilities. And yet in the end they waste all of that producing this wallflower of a beer, which requires countless amounts of clever advertising dollars to market. After all, without the help of a well-paid PR department, you wouldn't approach this easily overlooked kid at the high school dance either. It's all about hype, not substance."
"Drinkability: This is a drinkable beer. That is partially due to its being so light and watery. It would be more drinkable if it had a little more going on. Its price makes it somewhat drinkable too."
"(foods that pair well): pizza, spicy (Indian curry in my case)."
"This pours clear, pale/golden in color with a white foamy head (decent retention). Little smell to it, but a little fruity. Taste is a little overly sweet for me. Mouthfeel is what you could expect, light clean and fizzy. Not especially drinkable because of flavor, but it is what it is, easy to drink."
"I don't hate this beer but I wouldn't drink it except in an emergency"
"This was a beer I would pick up in college if I didn't have much money. Not worth while as there are much better beers out there like Sam Adams and Sierra Nevada. Not too impressive as this is one of the worse beers put there despite it being a macrobrew."
"Notes: you drink it only if you're really desperate"
"I guess I wasn't expecting anything at all from this beer. That being said, I guess it did live up to my expectations of it. Haha."
"This is the beer you go for when you want to simply get messed up. At $12 a 20 pack, it's exceptionally easy to get drunk off this, especially considering the smooth texture. If you're looking for a real beer, stay away, but for parties, barbecues, and just getting smashed, this is your beer."
"Please Note: I'm not bashing this beer. Its just the beer calls itself the king of beers. It ain't. Also don't mix this beer up with Budweiser Budvar. Thats not a bad beer. Its just expensive drivel. Not recommended."
"This beer tastes better in the bottle than in a mug. Their is always a weird off funky taste to this beer, maybe from the rice or beachwood, but that off taste is what turns me off for this beer. Beer made popular by huge advertising campaigns, this is just macro swill. Not too bad though."
"I needed something to wash down my snack, and free is free. It is what it is, and that is that. I'll take it over the ultra cheap and it is pretty clean and crisp but not my first choice."
"Can obtained from the discount bin of a local liquor store. Freshness date is 17 Jun 05. Pours a single finger pure white fizzy head that settles rapidly to clumps on the surface and then a ring around the glass. The beer is crystal clear, very light straw in color and has a single line of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom. Smells almost like nothing. A very gentle hint of malt sweet after the beer had warmed. The pull tastes like water but this quickly turns to a dark malty with a carbonation burn/release. Then comes a malty sweet with some honey and melon charatecteristics. This late rising sweet fades as a very gentle hop floral rises. Tastes like a mix of 'plunky' hallertauer with a gritty 'spalt'. Extremely light body and heavily carbonated. A bit darker than I expected for a beer that's said to be so light in flavor. Scored to style, not to my taste preference."
"Poured this from a 12 oz. can. It pours a light straw with a quickly dissapearing head. The smell is sorta corny some malts too. Not the most pleasant. The taste is sorta malty but the hops are there. Noot really tastey though, but they are there. Combined with crisp carbonation your tounge gets a little tingly. I would want this one to be a little sweeter but as it is it is still fairly drinkable and refreshing american lager."
"Reveiwed once before on tap at the Anheuser Busch Brewery and had a plesant experience. However, this time from the can. Looks brightly straw with small head retention and small lacing. Smells faint of light malt, corn, rice, and maybe other cereal grains. A bit astringent and metalic. Tastes powdery and malty. Light buttery and corn flavors dominate. A bit of cidery flavors present to the palate and in the finish. Noble hop varieties are nicely balanced but lend no flavor. Finishes scrubbed from over carbonation. Aftertaste is powdery and mildly sweet. Fades quickly. Crisp yet remains slick to the toung and metalic."
"Here's the deal. Bud is good at what it does. This is an American adjunct lager produced for the masses. It's easy to slam this and other mass produced American beers, but remember, we're not judging the style as a whole. Bud is a crisp, refreshing, drinkable beer, although not heavy on flavor. It would never be my first choice (nor would any other mass-produced lagers), but if I'm at a cookout or pool party and the host offers Budweiser, I'm not going to complain."
"This ought to put my ratings in perspective. Rice beer. Gotta love it. How could this possibly be any blander? Hmm. I know. Cut it half in water and call it Bud Light. That would make it blander. Anyway, this is the very definition of quaffable, much like water. The carbonation is nice and it does have a good finish. The flavor is grainy, the smell is ever so slightly grainy and there are some hops in there. But lets be honest. I come here to rate real ales and lagers made thoughtfully by people who respect the tradition, science, art and mystery of brewing. This one doesn't fall into that category."
"Her name was Wendy, and she was my wife's best friend. She had married her music teacher after High School in Southern California. We went to visit them in their Manhattan Beach home, and he brought out the Bud and the bean dip. I have never been sicker - after two Bud's, I tossed my waffles, and have never tasted that beer again. Sorry for the anecdote, but this is not beer, this is swill. If you like it, at least try to broaden your palate. As Stone Brewing puts it so well, ""Fizzy yellow beer is for wussies."" Pale, thin, synthetic beers like Bud are mass produced in stainless steel tanks for the unsuspecting masses, and million dollar ad campaigns keep it alive. Beechwood aging is NOT a good thing."
" Like I said, I expected a bit more over its light couterpart, for a flagship beer this big."
"Pours a light straw color with little to no head. Slight lacing, faint hops aroma, but overall pretty bland. Tase is a mix of hops, and something unfamiliar, possibly the rice? Just another american macro with little taste and reasonably high drinkability...look elsewhere for the ""king of beers""."
"Pours a pale yellowor slight golden color. Little head which doesnt stick around for long. The scent is slightly malty. I assume wheat or other weak grains. This is what the taste comes out as also. Slightly grainy, slightly malty. Overall a decent flavor, somewhat stale thought. Typical harsh american macrobrew."
"This is my first ever Bud. Waiter looked rather oddly at me when I asked for a glass, and I can see why as it came out the thinnest palest nastiest yellow I have ever seen with absolutely no head whatsoever. Smell is almost nonexistant--the faint whiff I caught reminded me of cheerios. The taste was much better than I expect, very light malt and corn flavor, but nothing offsetting or bad. The mouthfeel was also nice--medium bodied with a med/high carbonation level for a nice refreshing drink. For years I have been slamming this as a bad beer, but it's really just a good example of a bland beer, which has it's time and place."
"I am going to rate this solely on the fact that it is an American macro Lager and nothing more... The color is a light gold color, VERY translucent with a smell that is of wheat and not much more. The taste is surprisingly full, with wheat in the first part, sugar in the second and ends with a refreshing burst of water. If you are looking for an incredibly inexpensive beer that you can drink MUCH of, you have found it!"
"poured a pale yellow color with pure white puffy head that slowly fell. Smell is a slight sweetness but nothing spectactular. Taste is very light and non-offensive, but refreshing. mouth feel is thirst quenching. A beer designed to be the lowest common denominator so as not to offend anyone."
"12 oz. bottle, ""born on"" 5/16/05 - served chilled in a pilsner glass. Pours a very clear gold with a good amount of carbonation and a 1 finger fizzy white head that dissipates quickly but leaves some lacing toward the end. The aroma consists of grains, adjuncts, and a bit of sweetness - very clean. The flavor is about the same with touch of hops and some metal. It has a medium body and is pretty fizzy but it drinks ok. The best AB product I've reviewed so far."
"Overall I actually enjoy this product for many reasons. Including availability and price. Its no belgian or hophead special but it is what it is. A macro that feeds the masses and is worth your attention when its stacked up against other Macro's."
"Take Budweiser for what it is... a simple macro lager. It's not the greatest example of the style, but it's passable."
"I've never poured this into a glass before. It's pale like a ghost. Looks like urine in the morning. Smells... not as bad as it looks, but doesn't have much of a bouquet, smells kinda like off water. Can't come up with any spice flavours in the smell. Nor in the taste: very thin, just chemical taste, but not as bad as some Australian macros. Mouthfeel thin too. Drinkability's probably all right... you could smash a lot of those down pretty easily. But I'm not buying them."
"Very pale straw color, thin white cap of foam that only lasts a minute. Lots of carbonation. Smell of faint malt and grain (very faint). Taste is crisp and very smooth, some mild sweetness (I am guessing it is from the rice). Slightest hops to balance. No aftertaste. Wasn't as terrible as I was expecting. No overpowering tastes just clean and easy to drink - that is what appeals to the masses."
"When poured, this looks like a beer. It smells a bit like a real beer, but the taste, well, that's another story. Not a tasty treat."
"I don't even know why I'm reviewing this beer. It pours a golden color with a white head. It smells like any given house after a prom party. The taste is overwhelmed by the carbonation but it mostly tastes like watered down light malt with a small hop addition. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. The drinkability is really high if you don't have any standards. Otherwise it is o.k. if this is your last resort at a family gathering or wedding reception. Blah."
" It had a little more bite than some others I've tried but nothing that leaves an impression that makes you want to have another. I think it caused the headache I got afterwards but can't be sure."
"I know I wasn't hoping for much from Bud but it was even less than I could have imagined! This was just damn disappointing and I had pretty low expectations..."
"Drinkability: 1.5 This shouldve gotten a higher score, because its such a fine lawnmower beer, but because I hire the neighbors kid to cut my grass, I watch the poor punk sweat from the comfort of my air-conditioned house and drink a Unibroue."
"Slàinte! or not.."
"A thirsty man's last resort. I think they took stale bread and boiled it in water strained it added some food coloring with stale hops carbonated the whole thing. Continuing to taste marco lagers at the wedding reception this is quite bad. The smell is most offensive and this is the most urine like smell of them all. The body is mostly from the filler grains that come through in the taste but not a good thing. No thanks!"
"Overall impression: This is definitely a beer brewed to avoid offending anyone. Very crisp and clean, but very little flavor. I wouldn't turn it down for free, but certainly would prefer almost anything else."
"Pours a very watery yellow color, kind of a straw yellow... This beer seems a bit over-carbonated to me, it made a large white head, which quickly dissipated... The carbonation was enough to keep me belching with regularity. The beer had a skunky smell to it, with faint malt and hop scents. It tastes pretty tart, with corn being the main thing I tasted. As for the mouthfeel, to me it felt kind of heavy and syrupy in my mouth, and I didn't really want to keep it there for very long. I don't consider this beer to be very drinkable, unless I didn't pay for it.. If you slam it, it isn't that bad either.. and it beats Corona..."
"Quite likely the most over rated beer of all time. King of beers my ass... Poured out to a good lager golden color, but the praise really stops there. Medium high carbonation kept me belching between each drink, and with the high flavor of corn, and strong presence of alcohol, this was a difficult beer to enjoy. Finished with an odd aftertaste of malt and corn, mixed with a metallic taste. I guess if you have never had this beer, give it a shot. Me, no thanks."
"A very thin hay color, a foamy white head that dissipates quickly leaving a wispy lace. A mild malt aroma with a barely detectable hop scent. A very watery grain flavor with some very slight hop bitterness. There's also a mild sweetness to the flavor. Thin mouthfeel, with moderate carbonation. Not recommended."
"Although Budweiser isn't as drain-pourable as Bud Light, it isn't that far off. 'One of the most popular beers in America' just got spanked by a beer named for a city in Wisconsin, but brewed in Texas (or in Wisconsin, who the hell knows?). Neither one of these combatants is good beer, but Budweiser is clearly the worst of the two. The skill it must take to brew a beer this lousy is simply mind-boggling."
"For whatever reason, this tastes better out of the bottle. A bit fuller body and more intense flavor. Very corny and grain-like, but it's better because it's not as watered down. I'd prefer this to cans, as the carbonation seems better and it's just easier to put down."
"I believe that all beers have their proper place, including the macros and this is the grand daddy of macros. It is very drinkable and does one heck of a good job on a hot day or when you want to make sure not to overpower other tastes in a meal. Bud does have some grain detectable to the nose and taste. It is very light on the mouth. There is nothing awe inspiring here as for as a memorable beer, or a beer to sit down and contemplate but, it sure can hit the spot quenching a thirst."
"When it comes to Volume, Bud is the King. No doubt. But when it comes to the Beer itself, calling it a servant would be too gracious."
"A little better from a bottle than a can. Its refreshing on a hot summer day if its been awhile since you tasted a beer. I guess Budweiser is really not bad at all when you consider the type of beer that it is meant to be and its peers. Yeah, sure there are much better beers out there, but I dont feel there's any reason to get all fancy with your beer everytime you drink. Definitly doesnt live up to its ""King of Beers"" nickname."
"Pale yellow color with a foamy white head. Head retention is ok. Smells very clean with grassy grains, faint hops, and a little bit of malts. Taste clean. Sweet cooked grains, metallic minerals and carbonation with a clean finish. Light bodied. Well this is your classic American adjunct lager. No more No less than what I would expect."
"Yeesh, what can I say? I'd drink it regularly if it was the only beer on earth. We should be thankful that they haven't succeeded in that. It has its place, I guess. Seems to me, no biker rally would be complete without it. Also, I think many people could probably say this too: the first time I got well and truly bombed out of my skull, I was drinking Bud. I might find the stuff more enjoyable if it weren't for that wierd green-apple flavor/aroma that it always has. Sure, I drink it if it's free and I'm hot and thirsty, and there's nothing else around. I'll choose Bud over Coke, but that's mostly because I assume Coke has more calories and I think it will rot my teeth quicker. I could be wrong about that."
"PS Bud stinks but it goes well with pizza"
"Hey its usually the cheapest thing out there and easy to put down if your looking to have enough beer to hug everyone in sight. But I would only choose it over a couple of the generic light beers."
"I dont know what to say about this beer that hasnt allready been said. I've even noticed this beer having a diffrent flavor from one batch to another. I dont want to go in to how it tastes cause if you havent had it theres a good chance you live in a cave."
"Probably the worst thing about this beer, for me, is the sour tingle it leaves in your mouth after drinking. If I wanted a lemon seltzer I'd ask for one. Can't say as how they're hard to drink though. Like many macros, this beer goes down easy, leaving only the faintest memory of having just finished a beer and leaving one craving more. If only they knew it was more taste they were craving not more volume ..."
"Most of my rating is out of personal preference and taste; I could conceive of this as being drinkable when served ice cold and already inebriated, but there are sooo many other beers out there that there is no good reason to ever spend money on Bud ever again."
"when you pour this it doesn't look half bad. sure it's not a craft beer, so the color is light, looks like straw. I do like the fact that if you pour it vigorously you get a nice white head, and. the head will leave in a minute or two, and there is no lacing. i can really taste the corn, and that corn syrup taste. Smells like rice, but goes down rather well. hey its budweiser, so you can't expect much."
"This beer is not quite worth the price to me, but if it is in abundance, I will surely drink it up. The beer is quite bad on tap and when poured into a glass. I suggest drinking it straight from a cold bottle. Bud light is best from the can...the aluminum must give it flavor."
"Drinkability is average. I could easily drink a few of these. Thing is, cheaper beers with different flavors seem to get my vote. Bud will stay a default beer if there is nothing else on tap. Yes, I can afford Bud if I wanted Bud, but why spend the $$$?"
"It gets slammed, but under the aegis of reviewing it AS an adjunct and representative of the style, I'll say it isn't bad. Certainly thist quenching and uncomplex when you don't feel like being cultured by complex beers and just want something to watch the game with. Best paired with nachos and hot dogs."
"Overall: Budweiser is a decent beer and probably one of the best the macro-brew world has to offer. AB certainly deserves many of the criticisms it gets for its operations, but I do not think that its Budweiser beer brand should be the target of these criticisms. Save that for Michelob Ultra and Bud LIte."
"A.B.s King of beers. For a American Pilsner developed for the summer heat, not entirely bad. Light for todays craft drinker, but it will do in a pinch. Has the standard mass market lite malt taste, minimal hops. Not too tasty, but not a crappy taste either. It sure has a lot more umph than the Bud Lite version."
"If you're looking for something unique and complex, you simply won't find it here. After all, it's made by Anheuser-Busch.. But if I take it at face value, it's gotta be one of the best Adjunct Lagers I've had...and while that's still not saying much, I believe it's a decent example of the style."
"I know it sounds snobby of me, but I feel that people that think Bud is a good beer dont know the first thing about beer. The King of Beers Ha! What a crock! Only beer I can think of that could arguably be called the King would be Guinness due to its age and worldwide popularity."
"When you say Budweiser, you've said it all."
"Yea I wont buy this beer and dont recommend that you do either."
"blech"
"You know, it isn't THAT bad. Sure it is damn close to water and piss yellow with little head, but it doesn't actually taste bad. After a long time of BAing I had one at a law school function. I was suprised by lemony tinge I hadn't noticed before. It w as kind of like grain infused ice water with lemon. All together not the worst experience."
"R eviewed."
"Poured a very light almost gold yellow color with absolutly no head at all even after a pretty hard pour. No aroma except maybe a slight hint of malt. Flavor is very bland and onesided with barely any malt flavor pretty much all just what i would believe to be a rice flavor and no hops at all. The mouthfeel is very watery with a signifigant fizzy carbonation that makes you burp a lot. Definetly a beer I would avoid and if all that was available I still would not order it."
"well, i dont really know what to write about this beer. its better if you drink this instead of bud light, but really, you are better off paying for a six pack of something good rather than spend/waste your money on this beer. good try by AB, but it really is a slap in the face to the German name of this beer"
"A distilled dirt sandwich."
"Well, its a beer. I starting with this beer and will try to do ten. It pours with a small head that diminishes quickly. Looks very effervescent. Metallic nose, maybye some adjunct rice. Taste, not much. I could be refreshing if served very cold. I could drink many if that is what is around."
"Well...for some unknown reason the other night, I was debating whether to get a bottle of Czechvar or ??at Redbones, and since I have had Czechvar, I took the plunge, ordered a Bud and a glass and decided to have this beer and review it. Actually I was surprised...it was better than the Rolling Rock I had a few weeks prior. Here goes: Crystal clear faint yellow in color. Carbonation rises in glass. I was disapointed that I received no head from this beer and I was doing the pouring... I tried hard, but the beer refused to top itself off. Aroma is faint, but I detected an underwhelming jelly bean like smell. The beer was pretty much ice cold out of the cooler...I of course dutifully let it linger as long as I could, but it never seemed to warm up. Tastewise...what can you say...nothing till the very end when you encounter a bit of tartness or lemonyness in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium --, prickly, and makes you burp. Drinkability...I have to say that this beer was darn easy to drink, I finihsed the whole thing, and made a mental note that if I stroll down the macro path again, an ice cold bud is not going to be a horrible thing."
"Drinkability- Hmmm, I guess this means I have to try the other big 2 macro's and compare now. Not as horrible as everyone says. I wouldn't go out and seek it, but if it's all they had and I was thirsty as hell I would pop one open. Heck, I didn't pay for either one of them, so that makes it taste a little better too :)"
"Light pale yellow color body. White fizzy looking head that lasts about 30 seconds. Smell is grassy with some maltiness. Taste is sugary up front followed by a light bready flavor and then some corn and rice adjuncts. No hops present whatsoever. Mouthfeel is a little overcarbonated but its not horrible. I don't really enjoy bud but I can easily drink a six pack if this was all thats available. Take this bad boy brew for what it is. Suc it up and drink a few ice cold buds with your buddies because this is what they are probably drinking (remember... ingest ICE COLD)."
"Ahhh the king of beers. Well, maybe the king of macro swill. It is what it is and it is a very clean crisp American lager that is super easy to drink. I used to drink a lot of this beer and that was because it is so easy to drink no matter what season it is. I know it is pretty boring when compared to the many different styles of beer available, but when it comes to adjunct lagers this is the king. It has little taste, but for the style that is a good thing. I give the King all 5's, but remember, that is only for it's style. In the grand scheme of beer it ranks much lower."
"So I know everybody loves to slam AB for their ""flagship"" product; however, the stuff from the brewery is actually drinkable, and if it tasted like this from the store, I might actually buy one or two six packs a year."
"How anyone can be offended by an ice cold budweiser is beyond me."
"Served from an oversized pint glass, the beer was yellow, clear, and had a thin white head. The head disappeared quickly, but the beer remained notably carbonated. Theres not a lot of aromafaint graininess and a touch of hops, but theyre not worth the olfactory hunt. Its light, watery, and has a touch of hops. Again, not much in the flavor department. Served cold, I have to say it was a refreshing accompaniment to the meal. It just doesnt carry much flavor on its own. Its the centerpiece of an American style, and the rightful target of both praise and derision. From my point of view, Id have it again under similar circumstances, but I wouldnt be disappointed if I had to wait another ten years."
"Overall-the standard for American beers, a run of the mill lager with distinct smoothness, a crisp if somewhat bland taste and a watery sort of character. There are no factors that make it truly exceptional but also none that make it bad. I find it better than Miller Genuine Draft and leaps and bounds better than its cousin Bud Light. Drink extra cold, a warm Bud will make you gag for weeks."
"As everyone will always tell me ""Bud is awful, don't try it", but I decided I had to experience at least once. I purchased a 750 ml can, on the pour I marvelled at its flourescent urine colour. Smell, hops? Maybe? Taste... It is like carbonated watered down apple juice, but it didn't make me retch, it was kinda refreshed actually. Very watery mouthfeel, and quite carbonated. I COULD drink this all day and probably will if I was given a case, but I can think many other things I would rather have. Not nearly as bad as everyone says though, kind of enjoyed swilling it down... except the colour? comes out the same colour it went in."
"Light lemon colour. Faint malt and corn aroma. Some sweetness. Honey, vanilla, fresh grass, honeysuckle. Vanishes quickly. Watery texture. [1.5]"
"What was left was a craving for beer. I had to wait through the door prizes before I could hurry home and have something with malt and hops."
"Pours a golden straw color with a large head full of large soapy looking bubbles. Nose hmmm... didn't really pick up that much and i'm afraid that if i try too hard, i'll end up snorting this beer instead of drinking it. First taste doesn't yield much information. This beer doesn't want to be profiled. Finally a sweet malt flavor (from cereals?) comes through on the finish. There is nothing too offending about this beer, but there isn't really anything redeeming about it either. I guess Bud will always have a place on the shelf and it continues to provide enjoyment to a slew of people. As for me, I'll leave the bud to all those who enjoy it."
"This beer is good i guess for a macro, but not compared to much anything else, it may be good to have around when your working hard on a hot summer day, but probably not for much else."
"I figured id give this beer more of a chance inead of bashing it so much. Still not impressed but its a step better tha a lot of its macro competion."
"Basically, I will drink Bud only if there's no other beer available, like at a ball game or street fair where A-B has obtained monopoly status. Even then, I may pour out the last 1/4 of the cup, or choose a Coke or lemonade instead. I can't really say it's a BAD beer, just mediocre-minus. Well, yeah, maybe I can. Some of my friends call it ""Buttwiper"" or ""Crudweiser."""
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden beer with almost no head. I wont surprise anybody by saying that there is no aftertaste and general aroma is very weak. Pretty much the only thing I could pick-up was some sweetness. I personally dont care about this but I got to admit that this the perfect macro beer, i.e. no taste, no head, a little bit sweet for that extra refreshing feeling  everything that people who dont really like beer but still drink it like to see and taste."
"Bud - the ""American"" icon of beer. Well I guess we are known better for other things than our beer here in America. Popular drink at my local biker bar in Cleveland. Everyone here seems to be split between it and Rolling Rock. Again I say ""local biker bar"" , mostly folks who have never had the opportunity to taste anything besides Bud. So I drink it on occasion when I win one off the pool table. Color is unimpressive , reminiscent of urine in a bottle. Smell is pretty much nonexisetent. After taste isnt too bad , flat and uninspiring, which lends to its drinkability as you can chug it like a bottle of water. the taste itself is beer like , but no strong features about it in any department. I would cringe when I was stationed in Germany and drinking at a local bar when i would see young servicemembers come in and order a ""Butt-wiper"" , your in Germany for God's sake , home of Bier!! forget voting for President Vs King of Beers , we need a revolution and institute a dictatorship where all beer is required to taste good..."
"Whatever, it's Bud. I got an 18 pack and an accompanying Seattle Seahawks t-shirt as a present and I'm not enough of a snob to criticize the gift-giver's perception of my taste in beer. Of course there's the almost clear yellow color and the hint of actual beer taste, but as long as it's really cold and you aren't drinking enough to get to headache levels, decent alternative to a soft drink. Note that this Bud was brewed under licence by Labatt's."
"Bud is one of the most tasteless brews I have ever encountered and had the unfortunate luck of consuming. If it's free then it makes it less painful (wedding reception) to consume. Other than it's ""clear"" it has no redeeming qualitiies in my book. Pure crap in a can or bottle with a headache attached if you drink too much ""free"" at a party."
"Reviewing Bud is a tough assignment. On the one hand, I'm pretty sure the piss from the horses in the commercial are what they bottle and sell to us as the beer. On the other hand, it is a cultural icon and a dynasty of a football team, managing to beat out Bud Light for the Budbowl three years in a row (which, in this age of free agency and salary caps, is quite an achievement). Reviewing Bud is like reviewing America, and it turns out we like crap that we can make a lot of. Henry Ford, I salute you."
"If you feel the need to drink this shyte, make sure that you have some Gatorade and extra strength Tylenol on hand. The next morning is comparable to death warmed over. ""Headache in a bottle."""
"The beer after its pour from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass an unclouded light yellow with the head modest in size, frothy in texture and the color a bright white as it dissolves quite quickly the lace a thin sheet. Nose is malt and clean, fresh with the start lightly sweet with fair to middling rice profile, the top skeletal in feel. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops apropos to the style, dry aftertaste, it is what it is a mass produced beer, and at one time many years ago, it was my beer of choice."
"WOW - got a sample of the factory fresh bottled that day Budweiser!! Woo HOO.. I was promised that factory fresh Bud was amazing and well.. NOPE.. Poured the same weak colour that it always is.. A bit of fluffy white head. Smell is of grain and not much else.. Taste is.. well boring.. No hops-- Its like lite malt and nothing else.. Mouthfeel isnt horrid medium carbonation. Drinkability is low-- I dont know why but Bud gives me a headache every time. It maybe the King of beers but well I dont like Royalty"
"Bud cans, everyone knows what this beer tastes like, even though some people will never admit it. So why review it. It's the largest selling beer in the world, its yellow, carbonated, sweet and, cold enough, tasteless, but they sell gazillion gallons of this stuff. It's cheap enough for your parties where nobody knows good beer. The can fits nicely in your hand, at 95 degrees out, it flows easily down your throat, you could fit a bunch in your cooler. Not my first, second or fourtyish choice, but everyso often, there is a bud can in my hand."
"I drink this when my friend's buy and they know no better, and I've given up trying to lead them to better beer. *sigh* The taste of this beer varies from time to time. Sometimes flavourless, other times tolerable."
"I could not have more than one sip. Makes club soda taste decent. Aggressive carbonation with metallic behind it. Some bitter sweetness hit me and that's it -where's the water. There is some fruity aroma here. Pale colour of some fizz. Definately awful looking."
"Well, well, well. The King of Beers. When you pure this beer in a glass and take a look at it, you see a really light bodied lager. Where is the head? It really looks like a light beer. The taste isn""t the best, but it is drinkable. I can always pick up a ricy taste in this beer. I will drink this beer occasionally and many of times it is the only beer available at some establishments. As for buying it on a regular basis, I will definetely pass. In my opinion, the BUD name is so popular do to many years of advertising. Most people drink this beer just for the name."
"Not very drinkable. After about 2, starts to taste like sweat."
"I was going into this beer expecting to taste swill. Though, I had a surprise when it wasn't as totally disgusting as I had imagined it. I have had its light counterpart in the past, and this I expected to be a magnitude greater in terribleness. However, this beer was significantly better than Bud Light. I have to say that this 'higher; rating must be due to the KEG as opposed to the bottle. Pours light amber, little diffuse head. Smells of hops, alcohol, and stink. I didn't let this one get warm at all for fear of retribution. Very cold it goes down surprisingly smoothly. Has a little flavor, not very bitter. I did enjoy this much more than I would have thought."
"a beet with minimal flavor, in that it has more than bud light. But i work in a grocery sotre and we sell a hell of a lot fo the stuff.I guess it wouldent be bad if you are in an economic crunch or something, but i cant see too many reasons to pick this up when you have a beer case full of much better beers. this beer reaks a foul odor, and does not taste much better. I keep hoping peopel who really like this are just uneducated drinkers, because theres way better out there."
"Poured a pale yellow, not much head, faded fast, smell was slightly hoppy and malty sweetness, taste follows the same, rather creamy mouthfeel, kinda filling,good drinkability, goes down smooth, for what would be considered a weak, cheap beer, on this site, it still is better than most in this category, I'd sure rather drink this than some of the REALLY cheap beer, like Busch-light, Golden Anniversary(see my review), Black label, old Milwaukee,etc..."
"Basically I bought this one for two reasons. First, to put it on my beer list, and second, because I wanted the bowling-pin shaped bottle. That's about it."
"Eh, it's ok, it's way better than the Bud Light. I just drank some this weekend, because it's a cheap alternative that was available. I'd have it again in a pinch for cheap beer and it was between that and Bud Light. Had some hop body to it, but nothing over the edge or ""in your face"" about it. I would classify this as a Duff beer. It's there and that's it."
"That being said, I don't buy it for home consumption, but have been known to consume it otherwise. It beats water, however you look at it."
"What a beautiful day."
"Drinkability: very pleasant pool beer, it seems that this beer is the standard bearer of a ""3" or ""average brew"""
"I ended up at a cookout this evening, and there was nothing available to drink other than four kinds of macro-swill, Budweiser being one of the domestic varieties (along with Yuengling Light). The imported swills included Corona and Kronenbourg 1664. Instead of leaving and embarrasing my family, I took this as an opportunity to try beers I had not consumed in over two years. Frankly, I wish I had left when I had the chance. The Budweiser poured a light urine yellow. The smell and taste were pathetic--the most distinctive part of it was the grain (no hops that I could detect). In simplest term, this brew is worthless."
"When I poured this beer, i did a double take, because I thought that i had mistakenly picked up a bottle of water. There is no appearance to this beer. Its color, simply put, isn't. Head is average in thickness, but is gone within a minute, with no lace and just a small ring. Smell is a tiny bit of hops with a tiny bit of malt, and an overall wet dog smell. The taste is sweet, and it has huge overtones of corn. No hops in the taste. The mouthfeel is simply uncomfortable. Its not crisp at all, its kind of cheesy feeling in the mouth, with a small bit of carbonatoin on the back of the tongue. Although it is better that some macro-runoff that I've had, its just not good."
"PS - does maintain carbonation well, foamed quite a bit when poured in the sink."
"(other) Beer is good. Happy beering."
"ng"
"Terrible. This beer is terrible. Even for a macro brew, I was not impressed. My best friend drinks this shit by the pool all Summer long and I gave it a try in a 40 oz. bottle. Tasted like piss and has it warmed, well you can only imagine. About an hour after I killed it also got the worst headache I've had in God knows how long. King of Beers my ass."
"On a side note, the maxim printed on the side of your can mangles the English language, and my girlfriend, who is an English major, would be pissed if I didn't point that out. Is this supposed to indicate the intelligence of the average Bud drinker?"
"Decided to take advantage of the nice weather and do a bit of yard work. After sweating for hours went to the small package store around the corner and opted to refresh myself with Budweiser. I actually remember rading somewhere years ago that Bud is good for muscles when you've been doing a lot of work in hot weather. And I have to agree there is something refreshing about drink a Bud in the right circumstances. The beer is pale yellow in color with a higher carbonation than most other beers. The smell and the taste both come across as slightly salty to my nose and tongue. I could easily drink this beer all night if my goal was to get hammered. But I do that so rarely, I opted for two cans to help me relax."
"went to eat yesterday and this, budlight, miller light, coors light and fosters was the tap selection. pretty crazy guys! anyway, havent had a bud in a long time so, i got one. it was extremely clear and pale with an almost fluorescent yellow tint. big foamy white head that falls flat. the smell is very faint, smells like clean low impact beer. in the mouth it was crisp and cold, bubbly and refreshing, but in the taste department it was whack. very light corn notes, a slight funk, and seemed lighter than the budlight i had not to long ago. strange. anyway, lackluster beer, but drinkable."
"Not a beer that I would ever go out of may way to order but I had no real options. There are many better macros & regional beers of this type available, but Bud is not the worst of the bunch either."
"My goodness, even on-tap this beer is terrible. The only thing I'll give credit for was the appearance on this beer. It did look somewhat decent with a nice amount of carbonation. But after that there was nothing impressive about it. Smell? Maybe a very slight touch of grain but that's about it. Taste was the same way. Nothing happening here. It did finish crisp and dry which was ok, but that's about it."
"I can tolerate most bland macro beers, and in fact enjoy them. Budweiser is probably my least favorite of the full flavored standards. The appearance is nothing special, slightly fizzy yellow. Barely any smell. It feels okay in the mouth, and drinks easy, but there is something a little off in the taste. Not sure if it's the use of rice. I would rather drink Schlitz for a bland watery macro. Advertising got this beer where it is today. Oh that and the public's lack of taste."
"--Joey"
"12 oz can, born on date of jan 22, 2004. ahh the ""The King of Beers"". I grabbed a can for research purposes out of a cooler that was not gonna be finished after an affair I was at. No noticable aroma/nose. Very minimal malt, no hops ...hmmm whats left? as we all know, this is about as close to water as can be. Pass it by."
"Extremely easy to drink. American lagers serve their purpose, like when you've been drinking good beer most of the night and you get to the point where it doesnt much matter what you drink next, youve surpassed the point of appreciation. Save some money and grab the King of Beers (I laugh every time I hear that) and seize the night."
"I poured the King of Beers into a Pilsner glass and I was rewarded with a sickly pale yellow hued beer with modest animation racing towards the bubbly white head. After reaching about a finger and a half in height the head subsided to a loose cap rather quickly, this did hang around awhile though. No subsequent lacing was produced. Visually this looks like a very sad beer. I found the nose to be sickly sweet, it is not very clean or lagerish; behind the sweetness is a note of grain. This is not an inviting bouquet. I regrettably am about to take my first sip ever. The palate is bland, sweet, and clean. There really isnt much flavor and thus Buds popularity. Some graininess and husk is found way behind the vast nothingness. The finish is clean, empty. Like almost all AB products Ive had I got a headache drinking this one, this hurts my personal view on its drinkability. If I were forced to drink an American mass-produced Pale Lager I would pick Coors Original, Miller High Life, or Leinenkugels Northwoods Lager. The strongest aspect of this beer is its mouthfeel, it is medium, sturdy carbonation, very basic but appropriate. I was actually expecting to find a decent beer with Budweiser but I found out that the king has no clothes. This is a pointless drink and I will never consume it again."
"Notes: Nice on a summer day; If you dont care about taste. there are other things to ""quench your thirst""...as some people claim they like Bud for."
"Light bodied, a touch of butterscotch, very clean. There just isn't much here. Built to not offend."
"Char"
"It's pretty easy to drink because it doesn't taste like anything. I wouldn't go out of my way to have one."
"One historical thought- like Pilsner, Budweiser was once a style of beer. In fact, Miller and other big brewers offered their own Budweisers! Props to the AB legal team!"
"Ok.. after a look back at this review, i decided to lower the rating even more. This beer has no flavour, except for the faint beachwood ??? either way it tastes bad, barely any aroma, so its hard to determine what it is even supposed to smell like. I guess the only plus about this beer is that it goes down like water, very smooth. If your looking for beer, don't waste your cash on this * beer*. Highly overpriced for its *quality*"
"I like this beer even though its not my favorite. Its a pale yellowish color with almost no excisting head. It tastes of some malt mostly but its pretty one dimensional. Great beer to have under the sun while grilling its probbably the only beer that i'll keep drinking from my college (cheap) years when they are over."
"A friend stopped by with some while I was outdoors enjoying the sun, so I said, ""What the hell, let's review"". So, poured into the glass with a short lived white head over pale watery looking yellow liquid. Nose is light with weak adjuncty aromas...not too much goin' on, you catch my drift? The taste was much like the nose, a brief crispness gives way to pinprick carbonation and flavors of light light malt and adjuncty/rice/corn flavors. Finishes quick and watery. Over, finished, done, gone, out!"
"Yuck. What a stale nasty excuse for a beer. It gets you drunk and that's about all it's good for. It has a terrible aftertaste, and almost as bad of an actual taste. It amazes me what a great marketing campaign can do for such an awful excuse for a beverage."
"Taste: Well the taste is also below par, almost a light watered down bitter taste. I find Busch, a cheaper version in the BUD family to be better than this, and that is not saying alot."
"The US standard of adjunct beers, boring colourless and dull"
"CONCLUSION: Drink better beers! But if you are trapped without a choice Coors, Bud, Ice House, and MGD."
"Perhaps the best overall opinion I ever heard about Budweiser was told to me by a friend who visited the Straub Brewery in Northern PA. They had a picture of a horse drinking beer out of a bucket labeled ""straub"" and pissing into a bucket labeled ""budweiser""."
"The beer pours an almost clear color with a little gold tint. The head is a thick frothy white which quickly fades to a spotty lace. The aroma is light with little malt or hop scent. The taste is skunky, but refreshing. It has no malt character. I hate the use of brewing adjuncts to create a paler, cleaner beer. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with good carboantion. It drinks rough for me, but there are a lot out there who love it; I can't figure it out."
"This is my first on-tap review. I passed on the Michelob Light and Bud Liite. Great choices are so difficult. To my profound surprise, this Bud poured a frothy white head and laced down the glass. I could actually smell a hint of hops in the nose. Mouthfeel was well carbonated. Taste was light bodied, and flavor was negligible. Still, this draft ended up as an acceptable session beer. Especially, after seeing the skunky, green coloured brew that came out of the Michelob tap."
"Wow. This is way worse out of the can than the bottle. How can this be so much worse? I don't know anything about these things. The taste is still primarily grain or...whatever...but it's sour, overcarbonated, and metallic. I had trouble finishing this. Flashback to Milwaukee's Beast."
"i have never noticed this before but, heiniken and bud smell and look alot alike!"
"I like many of you still enjoy a macro, I have to where I live it's hard to get specialty brews. This is probably my favorite of all the macros. Like all american macros the color leaves alot to be desired. The taste however is one of the best, great start and a clean finish. Really a great beer to enjoy on a hot summer day."
"But I digress. Nothing about Budweiser is impressive. It is what it is, it's a macro, plain and simple"
"Drinkability: Every bottle the same, and ""fresh"". Just what I would want."
"Overall, a very thin, weak beer with little to offer. This beer must be served ice cold or else not served at all. It is nearly flavorless and without any character or interest at all. When poured into my glass, the beer bubbled like I'd expect from a can of Sprite/7up. Within seconds, the head was gone (not uncharacteristic) and what was left was a thin golden (nearly clear) beer. The first flavor you'll experience is moderately bitter with no other flavoring. When this subsides, you are pretty much done with tasting the beer."
"This is by far my favorite macro. Had it on tap at Bennigan's in Bloomington. It is suprisingly well balaned and flavorful, for a macro. It definitely has more flavor than any miller or coors products, IMO. I wouldn't turn one down, but I'd still probably drink something more interesting if given the choice."
"it has been a while since ive had a bud. fortunatley i just havent been in the position where ive had to endure it. if i never came across it again id not be losing any sleep thats for certain. zzz."
"Boring, but that is what they are going for."
"It was a buck a draft, so now seemed like as good a time as any to review it. Have to give it some points for being the proper color, I guess. There actually was a slightly fruity hoppiness to it, and I could taste the beechwood. But way too many off flavors, adjunct and DMS tastes, and besides, next day I got a pounding headache. Yes, it is the perfect beer for NASCAR fans."
"I can drink it, like I said, on a hot day, watching the bottle or can sweat seductively. And they do go down so easily. However, what limits me is that it seems to be my own, one most effective laxative. I can get it down, but it makes its way out in spades the next morning. Just as well, I should know better than to drink more than one or two in a pinch when I can get my hands on better."
"Despite it's unintentially hilarious claims, Budweiser is at heart an unpretentious and inoffensive, if not watery beer that goes down easily."
"Had this at a wedding because it was this or the light. Light gold color, no head when its served cold, light grain aroma, very light adjunct hop taste, but at least it lingered on the tongue for a second, unlike the light,watery aftertaste, absolutely no different then the light. Its a thirst quencher, but nothing more"
"Pale, shiny yellow color. An agressive pour produced some bubbly off white head that faded fast. Smell was at first sour, then grainy, mown grass, and fields of hay. Taste was a somewhat pleasant dullness of flavors, moderate sweetness, lots of corn water and ever so slight mushy hops toward the finish. Lacked the rough bitterness and metallic flavors I have come to expect. Moderately carbonated. Scrubing bubbles paired ok with Black Bean Chili Chips. Drinkability and taste held tight as long as you drank it fast and have some spicy things to pair it with. Quenched the thirst, but didn't impress while doing it. Drank it all and now happily I have more room in my fridge for another Maine Beer."
"All I could think of while I was drinking this was when will the torture end? They call themselves the King of Beers. The Biggest selling beer in the land. Was I impressed? No. The light yellow color reminded me of what a good beer isn't. no imagination, no complexity, nothing. The taste was more of corn syrup than of anything. Nothing in the way of hops, malt, or barley. But I did like one thing. The Bud Girls."
"Finally found this rare beer on-tap. Pale urine yellow, foamy white head. Smells of creamed corn and adjuncts, not much in way of malt or hops. Taste is very thin and carbonated, rice syrup, corn, and a funky flavorless aftertaste not unlike over-cooked rice. I think Bud is better straight from the can or bottle. With so many other choices for pale lagers, avoid this one."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 21AUG03, this post is based on notes from that review and several tastings since. -"
"I don't think so."
"The self proclaimed king of Beer <Fill in your joke here>. I was at a party the other day and it was either this or Bud light(review soon to come) so I chouse the lesser of two evils. This beer has a clean yellow color with some carbonation. The smell of grain and malt was very noticeable. The first taste was that of grain and corn. While this might be good in some cases this is not my first choice when it comes to beer. While I did not care for the taste that much I did think it was drinkable and it was very easy going down. Dont drink this beer."
"Finally got my hands on this rare brew. I made sure to set aside an entire evening for this tasting/reviewing. Almost clear, very pale straw body with a very bubbly, yet quickly dissipating white head. Smell is [corn?] malt aromas with some subtle hops. Grainy, lightly sweet corn adjunct taste up front with a disappointing, unbalanced finish of not enough hops. Very taste-less, but not horrible."
"I was recently at a wedding reception and I had Bud for the first time in about 3 years. Although the pour was pretty weak and the smell was of your typifal grain and rice, the taste was pretty smoothe if your goal is just toi get fucked up! It had a decent sweet malfy flavor with almost no hint of hops in the taste. If you are looking for a beer to go down smoothly then this is to one!"
"The biggest tragedy is the effort A-B puts into brewing this. With their incredible tech and output, they could make an unbelieveable beer and sell it everywhere. Oh well, I guess Bud sells and to a big business, that's the most important fact."
"OK, the Bud didn't taste all that bad. I drank it fast and it was a thirst quencher. However, without getting too much into the flavor profile here (it's a very brief profile...grain, slight hops and distant sweetness) it's best to just sum up the discussion by saying that it is not a good beer but in fact serves a purpose as a beer for a hot day. The end."
"Flavor is initially nothing, traveling into a metallic rice sweetness, with a fairly clean hopping towards the end. Carbonation is sodalike and large bubbled. Very artificial tasting. Regardless of their natural carbonation claims, I'm not buying it. Absolutely no aftertaste. This is perhaps one of the most inoffensive beers I've ever had. So bland, I really can't think of anything funny to say about it. Not really terrible, but there's so much better out there, why bother?"
"Why Budweiser sells the way it does should be the eighth wonder of the world. Extremely over marketed, this is truly a bad beer when one considers the countless other brews in this world of ours. Appearance is typical for a main stream American beer. A weak head with weak lace, ""Bud"" is literally urine yellow. The smell is again typical for a main streamer. The taste is weak and dull. I saw where someone else called Bud ""alcoholic water", and must say that is indeed an accurate description. Not a terrible lot happening with mouthfeel, either. Feels like you've got a mouth full of highly carbonated, over rated sub-standard beer. Wait a minute... you do! Finish leaves a bit of an after taste you'll be burping up for hours to come. A lot of folks like this stuff; ""why"" remains a mystery."
"Comments  The King is a good standard for American piss beers. Its smooth, well carbonated, and refreshing. Of course, its mostly water with little to no body, but it goes good with pretzels, pizza, or a four pound salt lick."
"Bud is what it is. They give me soccer on TV for free."
"This isn't bad at all. Better than basically any light beer there is. The adjuncts are still strong with a rice flavor that is listed on the bottle. But it gives me more taste than other macro lagers can. It is crisp and refreshing something I need after working in this summer heat."
"Bud is Bud. It IS an amazing fact that they can brew so much of this stuff and it always tastes the same. Lots of better beers and lots of beers that are worse. Lt gold color, large head. Lt flavor, no maltyness, some hoppyness. Pilsner Style beer, but very light flavor. Neutral mouthfeel, some hoppyness on tongue. Finish is crisp and clean. Aftertaste is neutral, slightly bitter."
"All in all, this is what I like to refer to as ""a beer of last resort."""
"Ach. This can of Bud came from the A/B brewery, not Labatt. The difference is amazing. When the tab was opened, an immediate smell of white rice came wafting through the air. Poured a typical Budweiser colour, with a very faint head. Smelled of rice, corn, other adjuncts, and that's it. No malt, no hops. Tasted bland. Sort of a Molson Canadian taste, but weaker. I can see why people slam this beer."
"I don't know why I rate these. I guess it is because my town is hung up on nothing but macros everywhere you go. Pours yellow a little half inch head....yadayada. Taste is a little hoppy and malty. Served cold it is drinkable. Not that bad. Contrary to aging beer they like to tell you when it will spoil. I hate to admit I drank this for many years. But my excuse is I was not aware of what was available."
"Bud is deliberately brewed, exceptionally crafted and completely ounded by many. This one should be enjoyed without too much thought!!!"
"Beer #4 - the skies have opened up and drenched us to the bone. Boston plays 3 or 4 songs during the entire cloudburst without so much as a hesitation for applause between tunes, just a musical transition into each successive tune from these musically creative geniuses, battling the thunder from the sky above which also treats us to a higher altitude lightning show nothing short of awesome. What a Rock&Roll Band, huh? Very impressive. This beer, the alcohol taste prevails over the grain, but I don't care. The music is great, my wife is by my side (I'll skip any innuendo to Foreplay/Long Time here if you don't mind) and we have a Peace Of Mind as Boston plays for 2 and a half hours. A great evening despite the rain, an even better band, a top-notch lady by my side, but just an adequate beer."
"The taste, somewhat sweet reflects the maltyness and is a tad bitter at the end but is rather too soft and the body is extremely watery which concurs with what should be its motto, ""The king of mass-production""."
"I poured this in a glass for reviewing purposes, but I prefer to drink a beer like this out of the can...it just feels right to me. It's a pale clear yellow with little head or carbonation. Scent is slightly grainy & actually somewhat malty if you get a good whiff, with some other 'acidic' sort of scent, if that makes any sense. Not a whole lot to smell. The taste is very mild but not completely watery. There is something in the taste of Budweiser that sets it apart slighly from the other american mass produced lagers. Just enough taste for me to choose this over say MGD of something. Nothing special here, but tolerable. Leaves a bit of a syrupy mouthfel..never noticed that before really. Very easy to drink..not really that exciting to drink, but easy"
"OK, I am taking my BA.com ratings seriously. I will even rate a .... ugh, must I say it, Budweiser. It has a mild fruity to no aroma. It has a head of fine bubbles that disappears quickly and body with a watery weak light yellow color. You can taste the carbonation in you r mouth. I look at the glass and bubbles are still rising off its bottom. I belch after the first taste. I can still taste the carbonation on my front teeth. The flavor is weak to non-existent. Definitely a no-character brew. There is no real flavor to speak of. There was very little lacing on the side of the glass. I belch again. Must I drink more of this swill? OK, I finished the glass and just had to come back and add one more point. I did get a buzz off this beer and for a cheap drunk; I had to bump up its rating. After all, it was only $0.89."
"This beer poured a large white frothy head with small bubbles that quickly diminished. There was no lacing with this beer. The body was clear and yellow in hue. The carbonation was fizzy. The aroma was somewhat fruity. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and the finishing flavor was lightly sweet and lightly acidic. The mouthfeel was light, thin and watery."
"Pours golden pale with a soft white head that fades immediately. The aroma is mosty green apples and sour maltiness. The taste is clean, inoffensive, and pretty much non-existent. This beer does what it is supposed to, so I guess that is worth something."
"But I was painting my bedroom midday, and any other beer might have made me tipsy enough to have problems with edging. Fortuantely I was able to drink several Budwiesers and still get the job done."
"A beer so inoffensive, it's offensive."
"A light straw color, some hops and corn on the nose, but overally un-offensive. Some light malt and light hops are detected, thin bodied, obvious adjuncts, and a watery finish. Lacks a true body, but overall, drinkable when backed in a corner, the king in lower case letters."
"Pours a mild goden color, topped by a loose, white head. Aroma is slightly sweet, with a distinct grainy note. The taste is pretty mellow, with a touch of sweetness on the finish and something resembling hops. The mouthfeel is agressive due to the large and prevalent carbonation. The drinkability is a little less than average, as I can't seem to stomach more than one of these, ever. This beer has almost all the qualities of a lager I don't like, and none that I do. The King of Beers on volume alone, I must admit that they always taste identical."
"It poured a pale unimpressive yellow, but the head retention was surprisingly good! Smell was of hops, corn, and some funky odor that I can't place. Not bad enough to discourage consumption, but enough to discourage further smelling. The taste was uneventful - carbonated beer-flavored water. Dry finish with almost a hint of hops. This beer's best suit? You can pound them back one after the other. And, it's better than Bud Light."
" An average mouthfeel but overall a drinkibility thats hard to beat.If Im not drinking homebrew or micros nothing beats a Bud for this kid.I dont care about the mass marketing and that Im paying to keep the speedboat running or the race car going or the Clydesdales happy-they make a consistantly decent product that has its rightfull place in ""beerdom"""
"Diesel is probably one of my favorites made by the Annheuiser Busch Corporation. It actually goes down very well, and I can see why it lives up to the name of ""The King of All Beers."" Although, changing the logo to modernize the brand might not hurt either from a marketing aspect."
"Definately not that good. A very pale coloured beer with little to no head. This is OK to drink, if it is the only option but otherwise I would go with almost anything else. This tastes like beer flavoured water and it has basically no mouthfeel. It does not smell too great either and the drinkability is crap. It is better in the bottle than it is in the can though."
"In my opinion, the ""King of Beers"" is the best of the American macros. Do I really need to explain it to anyone? I go to school in Williamsburg, right next to Busch Gardems and the Bud brewery, and this beer is everywhere! This is always the beer that I choose when I go somewhere that doesn't have decent imports. Much better than the ""Silver Bullet"" or the God awful Bud Light. If you go to Pizza Hut or Outback, then I'd take this. However, if you're drinking in your house, do yourself a favor and pick up a decent beer."
"It is hardly worth the money it costs, but is not a beer you should snobbishly refuse if offered."
"Why did I drink this? Oh, yeah, I was at a bowling alley, and then hung out with people that have no respect for even half-way decent beer."
"When you say Budweiseryou want to hurl."
"I have to say this is a beer for folks who hate beer..""king"" indeed..the emperor has no clothes."
"Most everyone here puts this drink in a certain category, Macro-swill. That it may be, but as far as it goes in that category it cant be topped. I have loved this beer since the first time i drank it, now i put it at the top of the shit-beers category. Nothing special by any means, but if all else fails, this is your go-to-guy"
"I had this recently while sitting in the stands of an IRL race here in Phoenix. Since the aluminum bleachers were cooking us a nice medium rare, we had to drink something, and you don't drink water during a race! So I got a big 22 oz. can of Budweiser, King of Beers. After my first sip, I think Bud should be know as the Queen of Beers, because it is so outdone by the micros of today, it makes Bud look like the Richard Simmons of the group. However, it did quench my thirst, since the flavor was not too overpowering. I can't put my finger on it, but the taste just has an unnatural flavor to it, possibly from the aluminum can, but it sits in my mouth longer that I like. It's not horrible, I just can think of many other beers I would have much rather had."
"After all these years of trying this beer, the best thing about it is its consistency. You always know what your about to taste when you have a cold one (usually)"
"I was at my local burger joint and they had all American tap beers for $1.50 for 16 oz. I have not had an American Lager in a LONNNGGG time so I gave Bud a try. It was poured a nice clear golden and had a good sturdy head. The aroma was as I remembered - absent. It tasted crisp and had a slight bite of hops. The beer was VERY cold and I could not detect any adjuncts - probably just as well. The mouthfeel was light and had some good carbonation tingle. For eating a hot pepper burger and fries, this beer hit the spot."
"I had a hard time getting it to go down, and had to throw out half of it. It has turned me off to a lot of pilsners because I'm afraid they will taste the same. Just say no."
" I believe Adolphus Busch would roll over in his grave if knew what had become of his beloved brewery. The largest brewing company on the planet and no doubt has the largest payroll for lawyers, accountants, marketing and advertising. To give credit where credit is due, they do have remarkable advertising campaigns. The beer itself is totally unremarkable. The lager is straw is color with a foamy white head. The thin body is made possible by liberal quantities of rice. The aroma smells of cardboard and stale dishwater with a trace of hops. The flavor is bland with the exception of the seltzery fizz and a slightly bitter back of the throat hop bitterness. Dry with some sweetness, but overall stale tastingeven within the Born on Date limits. I wish they would put as much energy into brewing a really high quality lager as they do in bullying smaller brewers with their vast and powerful legal team."
"There is just nothing I enjoy about this beer. I can't describe the taste element that tuns me off so much; perhaps it is the type of hops that is in every Anheuser-Busch product. The appearance is OK, but this is just a typically macro brew as to be below average in the categories. All in all, I'd rather drink almost anything else."
"I felt weird pouring this can into a glass. You might as well drink it out of the can because the appearance is just a super pale straw color with no head after 10 seconds. The aroma was a whole lot of air. I really couldn't smell anything from this beer. I really couldn't taste much of anything either. The carbonation is zingy on my tongue. This beer defines ""bland"". There's really not much else to say. A boring beer, the ford taurus of beers. (I consider the Taurus a very boring, yet smooth driving car. :)"
"I, as I'm sure most beer drinkers, have had Budweiser many times in my life. The only time I drank it consistently was for a while when I was about 19 or 20, and I liked it out of the can. It never really was my favorite, I preferred Michelob in those days. To rate this, I had it in a taste test with three of the highest rated American lagers - Yeungling, Miller High Life, and Pabst Blue Ribbon. The Bud was (by far) the worst looking beer of the group, as pale as any beer I've ever seen. Small head, disappeared almost immediately. No lacing. Smell was nuetral. Taste is not bad (in this company). I am not a fan of American lagers, and this tasting did not make me want to go back to the ""old days"". This being said, there is nothing off-putting about Bud, and it was as good as the Miller or Pabst (the Yuengling, as expected, was the best of the bunch). Bud is a refreshing, drinkable beer, good for barbecues, fairs, and the beach. But for my tastes, I could find something (if available) that I would prefer, even in those circumstances. Ultimately, just too damn nuetral! (I took one sip out of the can, for old times sake, and it was better than in a glass! These beers are not good when left naked."
"All in all, a delightful experience."
"Like I said, I prefer cold water, but..."
"I really wanted to say good things about this beer. It is THE American beer, like it or not. Pours average with dismal head. This is brewed with rice as the main ingredient, but what you get is cereal grains and more cereal grains. Very dry, with only a slight remnant of hops. This is the ultimate macro. It's ingredients are crap, so is the end result. Disappointed to say the least."
"Notes: I guess it's a decent American Pilsner, zillions of people like it. It's not really to my taste and there's something in it that doesn't work well in my bloodstream. I always seem to get a headache when I drink this beer (funky chemicals?). Compared to an aching head from a $5 sixpack of Bud, it's worth the extra $1 to buy local micro brew instead and/or beers that adhere to the German brewing purity laws. I can drink one Bud safely, but if I plan to drink more than one, I'll drive to town and buy something I can process better."
"Drinkability, well I don't think it is drinkable for enjoyment. If you would like to put away a number of these, I bet you could it is smooth and practically flavorless."
"Although this is a less than average beer, I have to give it some credit. Out of all the American Macrobrews (excluding Sam Adams), it is my favorite. Not only does it have decent alcohol content, but it has a decent taste. Nothing great here but it is heck of a lot better than any light beers."
"Pours thin and light, nice initial head, but loses overall carbonation rather quickly. It's a hop soda pop, and smells better than it tastes. After the first few sips of Bud Lager all traces of hop and malt are gone. Kind of like a carbonated water. Really nothing to love or hate about it. Highly drinkable. What's all the hub-ub about Bud?"
"Would I ever buy a chase for home use? No. Even for guests? No, there's better yellow lagers that I would actually want to drink. Would I turn up my nose if offered a cold one? No, I'd drink it (quickly). Would I choke down a warm one? No."
" Actually death would be better – truth be told. ; - )"
"Nothing to complex here.Pours a clear yellow with a fairly good foamy white head.Has a nutty wheat taste with a seltzer like mouthfeel.The only thing that makes Budweiser the King is the price and its drinkability quality.They are easy to pound when your at a bar or a hockey game.Or your just on a ""diet"" from darker beers for awhile.Not a very good beer,but it serves its purpose sometimes.I must add that its the only beer that gives me a pounding headache the next day.It never fails..Even If I only drink a few i still get a headache.What do they put in this crap?"
"Pours a bright pale straw color, with a thin white lace. Carbonation is very good. On the nose there isnt much going on slight graininess, pretty much just clean aroma. On the palate there is a nice bitterness, crisp, traces of malt, grassy taste, slight apple flavor in there, light grain, but overall very clean and to the point. Always fresh is what makes it drinkable crisp & refreshing but hardly any flavor"
"Its golden. Its beer. It is consistant. not much else"
"Pours pale light yellow color, some head, very strange looking, grainy- chemical aroma, no flavor, hops or malt, the rice adjunct takes away the flavors, light body and clean finish. I used to drink alot of this a long time ago, being from St. Louis I thought it was the best, I was wrong there are much better American Lagers, PBR, High Life and so on, I don't like paying extra for their marketing, they do have great commercials. Not worth the price, too much hype."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard tap glass."
"Though it's very close to water, at least it's not Natural Light or Bud Light!"
"Pours a clear yellow with a white head, Not any overwhelming flavor, just a very basic beer. Nothing Objectionable about the flavor, but nothing that jumps out as being great. A good beer for quenching thirst, as opposed to drinking for enjoyment."
"One of the most known brand and one of the last choices on my list. Pale coloured, no particular smell or taste. Com 'on guys I know you can do better than this all it takes is a little effort..."
"This is the KING! Of malt based rice beverages, anyway.  I am troubled by 1. the fact they BRAG they use rice on the label; 2. this beer is so lacking in body, taste, and especially hops, that they should not even call it a beer.  I've said it before, Augie Busch would go to jail if he brewed this in Germany, and I've taken this beer down a couple of notches as A-B is the evil empire."
"...and my friends at work said that I would not be impartial when I Reviewed this, Huh... questioning MY Beer Intergrity, what do they know??"
"A slight step up from Original Coors, but not quite Miller's. This is still a borrrrrring beer and it seems to have a watered down taste. Just nothing there! Took a tour of the Brewery in Fairfield California and was interesting. To bad the beer isn't!"
"After writing these notes the identities of the beers were revealed. I was not surprised that this was what it was."
"Best if taken in at a rapid pace and very cold so as to not give room for too much pondering on the qualities of the beer while drinking it."
"The only reason I tried to drink this because it was the last beer, and the game was under 2 minutes. I say tried, because after the first taste, I thought someone had slipped me a zima or some other water with alcohol in it. What's the deal with the continents listed on the can? Is that all the places it's been poured on?"
"All in all, a thoroughly unobjectionable, if unremarkable, beer."
"The smell of this beer is nothing special, a little sweet and something I can't quite pinpoint. Pale straw colored and crystal clear. It has a very thin body, and a lot of carbonation. There is just a little bit of hops after the fizz, just enough so that it doesn't taste like all malt. It finishes with a little grain and/or rice. It has no aftertaste to speak of.  This is definately the Budweisr of... well, beer."
"This is garbage. It is a shame that it is even included in this site. Although I might believe AB is a disservice to the beer community, others may disagree and I gladly support them. With that said, Bud is horrible to look at, piss water from a urinal is more easy on the eyes, probably taste better too. Why not, if you drink Bud you can't be that far from sticking your head in a urinal. The mouthfeel is like bad warm soda. Too effervescent. This is a very bloating and gassy product. Overloads the kidneys as well. AB should burn this recipe and pour the remaining barrels down the sewer; I will raise a glass of fine brew in honor of the sewer that takes that hit."
"Golden color, dissipating head with little aroma.  Straight forward malty flavor balanced with a few hops.  Flavor and body were pretty thin.  Ho hum and harmless.  A better alternative than a diet coke but not much else."
"Crystal clear. Very light yellowish color topped by a full and foamy bright white head that holds very well. The carbonation is quite fine, leaving thin steady streams of tiny bubbles rising steadily to the surface. Nice appearance! The aroma is quite limited with just vaugue indications of malt, hops, fermentation esters and alcohol. The body is light with a gentle carbonation and a slightly creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is quite one-sided, however, with only a very light malt character ever so gently buoyed by hop bitterness and a light ""apple"" character from fermentation. The finish is ""short and sweet"" with only a residual malt and next to non-existant bitterness. Refreshing! This is the best selling beer in the world for a reason. Although limited in character, it displays no flaws whatsoever. There is nothing even remotely objectable about it - a true ""beer for the masses""."
"The only thing that I can find to remark on, is that Budweiser King of Beers is quite unremarkable. This Bud does not offend the buds, but it does nothing for them either."
"My recommendation? Since I'm not an AB hater, I would recommend this with pizza, or hanging out with the guys.  Just a normal beer when you don't want anything special."
"Not much to say about this one, it's just another way to consume some alcohol without to much trouble. Refrshing and easy to drink, but so is water. Its rather dull in all fields. ""King of Beers"" - I think not, well maybe in a frat house."
"Clear light straw hue topped by a thin head that manages to leave lace. A hint of green apple in aroma, but there's not much else there. Flavorwise, it's quite bland-- light husky 6 - row barley notes and light residual sweetness due to the paltry hopping are all that is there. Hop flavor is virtually nonexistant and can be overlooked altogether. Thin, watery mouthfeel. Finishes clean and abrupt. This was my first Bud in years (lousy Appelbees!) and will probably be my last. No outright flaws in Bud, however. Just a total lack of character."
"It claims to be ""the king of beers"" but a quick look at the ingredient list makes you wonder quite how it even manages to be a subject in the beer kingdom let alone the ruler.  Then you taste it and what hops and malt it does have in it are nowhere to be found.  A great example of the power of advertising - why else would so many people pay to drink something that the rest of us get out of our taps."
"Okay, my friends caught me in my neiborhood on the way to my craftbeer friendly Betty's.  So since one just got back from his honeymoon, I had a beer with them.  This beer on tap is why I avoid it whenever it is usually offered on tap.  The beer was a light straw color with very little head and no lace.  The aroma was next nothing and was mostly hops and grain.  The flavor was faint and basically hops and grain with a bite to it.  The finish was very light, with little character and a bit of a bit to it.  As much as this beer suffers in can and bottles, I think it fares the worst as a draft.  And I am an old seasoned Budweiser drinker."
"This is perhaps my favorite macro.  The color is a deeper golden than most other macros, giving one the impression that it will have more flavor.  The smell is a little bitter, but not offending in my book.  The bitterness follows through into the flavor, but leaves relatively quickly.  I am not one to say I hate all macros and I like this for a change every once in a while.  One of the best macros in my opinion."
"Update: An Ice-cold 32 oz. draw of the ""lowpoint"" (4%abv) version of Bud seemed to hit the spot on a nice warm fall day at the Tulsa State Fair. I have to confess, I actually enjoyed sipping on this brew while walking arond at the fair. I also know I'd never buy it and drink it day in and day out...ever."
"I love beer, but if this were the only beer in the world...well I say pass the tea.  This beer has no characteristic that impresses me except for the marketing of Anheuser-Busch.  It gicves me headaches among other things LOL and well lets just say great commercials AB but work on the beer........CHEERS"
"Budweiser is simply a good, dare I say, great beer. It doesn't cost $50 dollars a case and no one will think you're high society when you tell them you drink Bud, but it is a fantastic beer. The truth is if you truely love beer as I do, and your not just some Frasier with a pention for beer instead of wine, then you must agree this beer rules the school. If you want to get drunk, this will do the trick. No head aches (unless you posses a vagina, and even then it is a matter of chance), it goes down like ice water, and it taste great."
"Scourge of all those who enjoy good beer."
"A beer that is an American classic and worth revisiting from time to time."
"Clear slight yellow color with a white head.  Very light color.  No noticible smell other than a slight malt/skunk smell.  Taste has a sweetness but the brew is very bland..."
"First off let me say, I've always been a Miller man (worked on the delivery trucks during college) and have always thought Bud to be the worst of the worst. Well, that may be overstating it. There are many beers worse than this....cheaper beers with bad off flavors....This is certainly no powerhouse of flavor...it pours a disgusting very very light straw color(Basically pour a glass full of water and then drop in two or three drops of piss for color and you have this color)...it is not bad, but really doesn't have much taste....some soft malt(rice) tones but overall it is pretty tasteless and easy to drink..no hops at all...Tastes like a light beer..."
"Had this at the ballgame, bought by a friend (not a beer advocate, mind you). Much the same as I remembered from my youth -- slightly sweet, rice-like. Definitely not skunky; I'd probably take this over a Heineken. There are worse tasting beers out there, but there are far, far more better tasting beers as well. At least this is consistently sub-average."
"Footbal, Soccer, Nascar, etc. For some reason Budweiser just goes real well while watching a good event. It's very drinkable and smells good. Otherwise it's just... well... Bud."
"Ahhh...liquid rice. This is only the most popular beer in America because as George Carlin says, ""they smear their logo feces everywhere."" The only reason to drink this stuff is if you are already plowed and it's on special at the bar. In addition, it's far too expensive for the poor quality...stick with something else."
"I hadn't had a Budweiser in a long time when my neighbor, an AB employee, gave me a six-pack that was two days old.  It was better than the stuff that's been sitting around forever, but it was still Budweiser.  On the rare occasion I do drink a Bud, it's usually out of the can or a plastic cup at a baseball game.  Pouring this stuff into a clean glass was someting of a shock.  It's barely a shade darker than water.  It more or less smells like water too.  By the time I saw and smelled it, the watery taste came as no surprise.  I like it better than Coors, but that's not saying much.  Fortunately, most of the beer I get from my neighbor is his homebrew."
"Ahh the old red and white.  Looks like colored water, tastes like colored water, and smells like it too.  I can definitely taste some adjuncts, probably the rice.  Incredibly carbonated, you will still be burping in an hour.  I would have to say that among the macros most A-B products are on the bottom as far as I am concerned"
"Well, I have always been a huge Budweiser fan. Hey, it's not extremely complex but it is a great thirst quenching beer and they are a very respectable company when it comes to the pride they put into their product. They are legendary and always will be and I will always take a Bud over most of the other typical beers (Coors light, Miller, Rolling Rock, etc.)"
"I can't manage to choke down a full bottle/can/glass of the stuff. I can at least polish off a Nasty Light. Don't think I've ever been able to finish a bottle or cup of draft of the stuff. I'm guarenteed to start gagging before I get to the bottom third. That and it's overpriced for what it is. I don't diss the beer because I'm trying to judge it for something its not. I'm dissing it because I can't drink it."
"Very light-colored, and smells as refreshing as it tastes. Goes down smooth and stays down...smooth.  A lot of people like to knock Bud, but at least it makes no pretenses, and I'll fall back on it anytime. Clean, refreshing and inordinately drinkable--available in 30-packs for a good reason.  You know going in that it's not meant to challenge your taste buds, so just take it for what it is and enjoy what could be the easy-drinkingest beer in America."
"Time to weigh in on the big boy (sadly second to Bud LIGHT in sales in the US -- what have we come to?)...American=buy American (as some have said)? Some of the best beers in the world are American micros so its not a case of preferring a German macro product...Bud is VERY consistent (with the production and delivery capacity to prove it) and ""adjunct"" clean but alas has no flavor other than sweet/remotest bitter in the most fleeting way...so in the case of comparing it to urine, c'mon, is it like that acrid smell? A standard setter for style and I have no problem drinking one. The color is lesser than many macros, but the flavor has some pleasant cereal grain notes -- actually Bud is one my favorite macros for style."
"Think about this: How much does A-B spend on advertising? And how much do you pay for a six? Now remove the ad budget. Yep, it's a $2.50 a six beer, and not even a GOOD $2.50 a six beer, but you're paying $4.00 a six for the priovelege of looking at talking frogs and seeing people say ""wazzaaaap!""  Feel dumb? You should.  There's no reason to subject your mouth to this crap. There really is no reason."
"Appearance is watered down looking with a soap bubble head.  Taste is weak but odd at the same time with a mild rice-sweetness.  This is the kind of beer you can share with your friends because most don't appreciate the imports anyway.  I drank plenty of this is my younger days...when you look up headache in the dictionary it reads ""Drink 12 Budweisers and take a nap."""
"this lager should be appreciated for what it is...a clean, crisp, refreshing, brew that appeals to the masses and can be drank whenever and wherever. there are many other much better lagers and ales that appeal to those of us with discerning tastes and appreciation for REALLY good beer. but after a day of construction work in the sweltering summer heat, nothing beats an ice cold budweiser. just as during the shortest and coldest of days in winter sitting in my favorite pub, a pint of stout, porter or doppel bock is just what the doctor ordered."
"People like to pile on this beer because it is the largest selling beer in the world and its always fun to poke at the guy on top. Is it good or is it bad? Neither. Its right down the middle. It is a clean-tasting American lager. It leaves a dry aftertaste in the mouth, but is overall decent on a warm day. I have no problem admitting that I don't mind drinking Bud. Its only when people say its the ONLY think they drink is when I find it questionable."
"A consistant brew for the unwashed (NASCAR) masses. It is what it is...your basic, bland American lager."
"It is very light tasting and easy to drink. Every once in a while I pick some up and when I have the first one I usually wonder why I don't get this more often and when I finish the last one I usually know why."
"My understanding is that the ""beech wood aged"" propaganda has to do with wood chips in the fermentation vats to increase the yeast surface area.  This may explain why this beer always seems to me to have a funky, off flavor, not to mention that corn and rice adjuncts seem to be the major characteristics.  I hate to go against the billions who love this beer, but it is just about my last choice as I fish around in the cooler."
"While it is true that Budweiser is the ever-present American beer, and that it garnishes some blame from folks thinking it should be other than it is, it is in fact a good all-purpose beer. It is an excellent summer beer, and goes well with barbeque."
