"It was cold and wet."
""
"The main thing going for it is price...it's cheap.  Consume it as cold as possible...freeze your taste buds."
"This was my first beer, sadly. Has to be served ICE COLD just to get it down now."
""
""
""
"Back in the day some friends and I went to visit another guy who went away to college. This stuff was everywhere, all the dorm parties, frats, dives. Long story short, ice house is a totally  forgetable beer however the timesI had drinking it were wicked pissah"
""
""
""
""
""
"No words for this swill."
""
"Cheap. Server Cold otherwise it tastes a bit like rusty water."
""
""
"Could be one of the worst beers I've ever had."
""
""
"Harsh & grainy adjunct lager.  Cheap & Dirty."
""
"It's not trendy, nuanced, or lovingly crafted. Don't let it warm up and drink it from a snifter.  But for what it is, I think it's great and I'll buy it again, particularly at We're here to respect beer, so let's not call things awful that are simply out of fashion."
"Feels like I threw up and havent gotten the taste out of my mouth yet"
"Good drinking beer. Crisp very enjoyable. Price is awesome. This and Keystone Ice are my favorite ICE BEERS."
""
""
"Pretty rough stuff, definitely better choices out there."
""
""
""
"A terrible beer.  It's my Grandfather's favorite, and I've had more of these than I care to admit"

"It's an awful beer."

"Overall (2.18) : This stuff will get you hammered fast. That's not my goal personally, as I'm more of a connoisseur than a drunk; however Icehouse drinks a little better than some macro tall beers - but not very many. Better than Keystone Ice by a nose. And now the alcohol is taking effect. Great. Best out of the tall macros? Natty Ice. Sorry Miller/Coors."

"Thos beer was an okay beer for a cheap beer. The taste was not that bad, but it was not the best tasting beer. The aroma was just ok as well. I personally would pick another beer over this one. But that is just me. But for a cheap beer like I said it was just ok."

"O: A little better than I remember but still in no way good. It's tolerable."

"Not a bad higher abv, economy beer. 5.5% but the flavor is not that harsh. Nothing that good or bad about it. A decent ""get the buzz on"" ice lager."

"Edit 7/18/2014. Appearance is really excellent for this beer. I can't think of another AAL that has a better long lasting head and the lacing is rather superb for a beer of this type."
""
""
""
""
""
"Icehouse? Gah. I'll finish it, though. I'm just grateful that there is no taste to develop a taste for."
""
""
"O: I refuse to bash any beer, but I will say this is not what I would choose to drink. But in a pinch it will do alright. It is what you would expect from macro breweries. The taste has the same notes as others to me. It was drinkable and as I said will work when you are in need of some refreshment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this was drinkable, but not exceptional in any way. A decent brew for the price."
"Overall, it tasted like licking the inside of a metal freezer, hence the name, I guess."
""
""
""
""
""
"IF IT AIN'T THE HOUSE, YOU'RE WEARIN' A BLOUSE."
""
""
""
""

"For what it is, this isn't half bad, though quite bland overall. There is maybe a bit more hop character than than the average AAL, and it's cheap enough. It's smooth compared to a typical malt liquor, and as strong as the weaker varieties of that style. There are worse beers out there, and though I probably won't seek this out again, I wouldn't refuse one either."
"O: This is nowhere nearly as bad as the 51 Beer Advocate is giving it. While it's not a good or even solid beer, it's better than the BMC's and far better than the Natty and Keystone level beers."

"Icehouse is a brew that is brewed by Miller Brewing Co . This brew has an ABV of 5.5% and it pours out dark amber with a nice white head. I like the color of this brew; it is not to dark but not too light. The smell is grain , malts, and some hops. It has the smell of an American Adjunct Lager.  The taste is bold with flavor, but it is refreshing and smooth.  You pick up on grains and malts. There is nothing bad about this brew. This is one Miller Brew that I really like. Mouthfeel is bold but clean.  I will get this brew again. Overall I'm giving Icehouse a 4 out of 5."

"Icehouse bought from Sterk's Grocery in Hammond, IN when i was a young-in ... outstanding!"

"This is why you must seek local brew. Compassionate brew makes for better brew, local mkes it fine!"

"Definitely not a ""good"" beer but one I feel very nostalgic about due to it being the preferred choice of friends during college. Higher ABV than many other macrobrews. ""Adult soda"". When I need a lot of light refreshing beer I'll always go with this guy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer has a decent woody/smoky flavor up front. The finish; however, is harsh and dry. It leaves a prickly, dry feeling in the mouth."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's certainly not the worst or the best I've ever had but the price is right on this beer. It went down pretty smooth !"

"O: Not a terrible beer, I like it better then a lot of AAL beers, plus it comes in the 40oz format which is convenient. Its also got another ABV point at 5.5 then most AALs."

"King of the bank account-friendly ice-beers . cheers ."

"I used to drink this beer alot when I lived in Minnesota. I would stick a few cans in the snowdrift to get them ice cold when grilling. It seems to taste best when the beer is near freezing. It has a crisp taste and seems to have more carbonation than most beers. Not the best beer I have ever had but its light and goes down easily."
""
""
""
"For the price 13.99 a 30 pack where I live this beer is good. It better then most in the same price range. Has a strong apple cider taste with a sour after taste. Some metallic taste from can I believe. Aftertaste goes away quick. Really a smooth taste for ice brew style non watered down. Has what I call ok drinkability not top dollar but not the worse,"
""
""
"Overall, this brew has a good balance between clean/crispness and actually having some flavor. It's got more flavor than most beers in the category without being too fruity or sweet. The carbonation is on the low end of moderate and just about right, in my opinion."

"O:not bad for the style. Of course I enjoy the taste of beer period. So it's tastes like beer to me. Its got above average ABV points for that. A decent choice if you want to slum it for a day and someone else is buying!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent AAL option. Ubiquitous and cheap ($6.99 for a 12 pack in my area). Easy to drink but nothing amazing. Could be refreshing on a hot day. Would not highly recommend seeking it out."

"You realize why this beer is so inexpensive one you taste it. This brewery spent no time or effort making a good tasting bee!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pousrs clear yellow with a thick soapy head that fades quickly. This beer, is very grainy, corny and cheap. Corn all the way through the nose, and into the taste.. Cheap grain, cheap malts, decent carbination. Its just a very cheap tasting beer. Its only purpose is getting drunk."

"Overall â€“ While there are much better brews out there, Icehouse is better then I was expecting. Not really offensive and rather easy drinking with an even little bit of bitter hop working its way into the taste."

"Their is so much better ways to get drunk"
""
""

"Thin head on a brownish gold body which slightly hazy. Aroma of stale honey, grains and tropical fruit. This beer is just awful. It's mostly sweet and barely has any malt or grain flavor making it more like old apple juice than even just a bad beer. Moderate to high carbonation. Basically tried it for the review. I understand not all beers are good but they should at least be drinkable to some extent."
"Well, it's Icehouse: Brewed below freezing. Is that even possible?"
""
"O: While this is probably the worst tasting beer I can think of, it does remind me of college and having a good time. It is higher in alcohol than your average beer, so I view that as a plus. This beer should only be consumed when there is nothing else left."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not terrible. Another good one if you're short on cash but wants lots of beer. It is what it is."
""
"O - Overall, An off flavored adjunct that provides no frills."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"1.0 D: I don't know how they got this up to 5.5% without having any flavor in this. Amazing."

"It's obviously light and somewhat thin, but crisp and with a bit of smoothness to it. It's not quite creamy, but almost."
"The price could go down a lil bit. Its pretty high down here in Indiana. Overall you cant go wrong with an ice cold Icehouse."
""
"it is what it is... a cheap ice beer. nothing special"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer for the style. It started out pretty well but the taste was not much to speak of."
""
""
""
"The beer is amazingly clear with a white head. Clean aroma with a strong corn character. Some grainiess and a bit of yeast. Very simple flavor as well. No hop character or anything, but a clean flavor and moderate sweetness. Better than I had remembered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I don't really see the appeal to Ice Beers. I definitely have had worse but this just was not a great beer to drink what-so-ever. Don't be tempted by the $1.50 price tag, spend that extra $2 and get a bomber of Fat Tire instead"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: Pretty rough stuff here. Tastes pretty much like a 3% beer that has been iced to death to create a measly few abv degrees. Not alot of flavor, and the flavor there is not tasty and very metallic. There are better ""cheap beer"" options than this.... just about anything. But don't take my word for it, just read a few reviews. Universally awful and not to be purchased unless you're a glutton for punishment ."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a straw color with a small white head that dissipates quickly and leaves no head. Smells of corn and other malt, that is about it. Tastes of bland malt, that is it, a little taste of alcohol, but nothing too bad, and has some fullness to it. Definitely goes down smooth for a light bodied beer, but carbonation seems a tad heavy. Overall, a below average beer."

"This is a light bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. I drink this and I am immediately taken back to my days before I was of legal drinking age. If you dont have a choice and you are forced to drink this than it is pretty good. But living in the wonderful world we do, and being of legal drinking age, thank God this isn't something I have to be forced to drink. If you are going to drink this, make sure it is cold. ICE cold..."

"Overall - Very, very good. Much more of a bold and flavorful brew than I suspected (it was only $1 for the bottle). The only bone with this beer I have to pick is the very noticeable metallic flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not sure why I bought this. I think it was to amp me up for the craft brew that followed it. Steer clear."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"This wouldn't be ever be my first choice for a beer, but in the category in offers things other don't such no metallic off notes and not off apple-like yeast notes."

"O - Not offensive, not good. It is what it is. No desire to really drink it, no real taste."
"Overall: Horrible. I'd much rather have a Lionshead, Rolling Rock, or High Life."
""
""
""
"D - A surprisingly decent adjunct lager - I'd certainly drink this over PBR or other similar swill if forced t choose. Probably a good value at its price point."
""
"O - Not my favorite AAL. Probably not something I will buying again in the future..."
""
""
""
"O: I've enjoyed Icehouse so many times that it was interesting to actually review it critically. For me Icehouse is my ""Happy Place"" of affordable macros. Super sessionable, cheap, and available everywhere. I'm astounded by the low ratings that other BA's give this beer."

"I have only had Icehouse once before, about 8 years ago, from a keg at a Halloween party at the University of Toledo. Obviously I had come to this party armed with some Natty Light...So i really don't remember ""tasting"" the Icehouse. Anyways I was at Krogers today and noticed a 6pack for $4.29. Thought i might be nostalgic. To be honest....i have had worse. Its for sure got that grainy, corn taste but you could do worse. I can kick back, and drink a 6 of this, get a good buzz and thats bout it. For the price...i recommend it. Goes down pretty smooth. If you can afford better...no need to bother."
"O - Perfect representation of the the style. On the other hand it is terrible. Considering every beer in this style is a perfect representation of this style, I'll give it a 2 and tell you to avoid it. Not bad for a cheap drunk, though!"
"Overall this beer is just below mediocre. There is nothing special. It is easy to throw a handful of these back on a hot day but this is not a beer that I personally would spend money on."
"Well, apparently the beer Ice Wars that spanned the 49th parallel back in the 90s have left some stragglers - no surprise there. What we have here is, then, a remnant of a bygone era, out of place, but not out of our collective consciousness. Bloody hell."
"Pours a golden color with super thick head that eventually thins to a lace. Standard putrid adjunct aromas. Goes down smooth, like water a hint a bitterness in the back of the throat with a little bit of that ice beer alcohol flavor. Overall this beer is standard adjunct crap, but if your into ice beers, this is one of the better ones."
"This beer is not all that bad, not great by any stretch of the imagination, but if money was an issue and I was looking to buy a 12 pack of something cheap, i wouldn't mind getting this. Or if I went to a friend's house and this was my only option to drink, I would not hold it against my friend. It is a drinkable beer but it does have a little bit of a bitter taste to it."
"O- Good drinking beer for mass quantities but not alway tolarable."
"D: not undrinkable, but i wont be hunting icehouse down anytime soon. i couldnt detect the 5.5%abv tag. reminds me of coors light or just about any other american adjunct lager."
"Overall, it is what you are looking for in an American lager. To me it cheap and get''s the job down,"
"Overall Drinkability - Maybe it's the Bud Ice I just had, but this beer does seem to be suprisingly complex for the style. Reminds me of a german pilsner. Maybe a watered down Warsteiner. Very watered down."
"icehouse takes me back to my younger days bar hopping. Icehouse isn't the best beer I've ever had but as far as everyday run of the mill beers go, it aint bad. It has a little more bite than some other beers of the same caliber. The color is clear yellow, there is nothing really great about the smell, and like I said there is just a little extra bite to an otherwise bland flavor. All in all I'll drink an icehouse from time to time. You could do worse."
"24 ounce tallboy with ""Icehouse"" on the side in huge letters. This beer looks like it means business. Golden lager with a big, foamy head that dissolves pretty quickly. Tons of carbonation. Sweet corn and toasted grain aromas. Odors are a little faint. Sugary, malty vegetable taste. Becomes crisper and tangier as it warms, but retains a good flavor."
"Overall: You get what you pay for, I guess."
"Very clear pour resulting in a two finger head of pure white, thick foam that lasted about three minutes, and left a broken but clinging lace. The color is a 4 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell yields a slight aroma of floral, with a overtone of roasted wheat, corn, and rice, followed with the sweetness of malt. The taste is a little harsh and unbalanced, yet sort of appealing, with wheat and corn flavor in the lead, and undertones of cooked rice and just a shave of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is a little over carbonated, but what it short on smoothness it makes up in zing. Not a bad, cheap beer, that will cool you down after a hard day in the yard or sports. Not something you want to drink warm...heaven forbid, but a solid after a hard day of work beer."
"Icehouse is not exactly an award winning beer. But it is beer than Natural Light. Icehouse is a little darker golden than your standard American Adjunct Lager. There is not much to smell but grains....same with the taste. the mouthfeel is ok can be a bit bitter."
"Thanks buddy."
"Overall - not bad tasting, but very bland in general like most of these types of beers."
"Poured a pale yellow color with little to no head on it. Smell is pretty faint, maybe some grain - not a lot to speak of. Taste is not good but not too bad. Again not a lot of flavor, but it doesn't taste like ass. Just a bit of malt flavor and some grains coming through. Very light mouthfeel, goes down pretty easy. There are definitely worse beers out there. This was not as bad as I expected. It's pretty cheap, so if you're looking to get drunk, this would get the job done."
"If you somehow can't afford Schlitz this will do. As such, I give a Schlitz about Icehouse"
"this is a beer you buy when you want a cheep party beer"
"Poured a dark gold colour with a bone-white head that comprised about a third of the glass. It smelled sweet, metallic, and like corn. It has high carbonation. The taste has some corn in it, but mostly it tastes like bread and a bit metallic. It has a bit of a bite to it too that I like. It's not a particularly harsh bite. It's probably partially due to the carbonation and that metallic off-note, but it's there. It's got a bit of a starchy flavour to it as well, despite being watery. That's what i like about this beer, it's a water-beer for sure, but despite that it still tastes like liquid bread and it's got a 5.5% alcohol content. This is my go-to beer for a budget beer. My only problem with it is that it doesn't taste fresh. Something about it tastes old and stale. It's probably due to that metallic taste. That's no bueno. But all in all, I like that good old bread and water taste."
"Drinkability: I suppose if you want to ""get trashed"" this beer is a winner, but not really for someone with a discerning taste: basically this beer is for trashy college kids."
"Overall: Like I said, to fans of ""real"" beer, this is an awful beverage, but as a cheap beer probably meant to be drank en masse - it does it's job to the letter than nothing more. Honestly not an awful experience, just nothing remarkable in any way."
"24 ounce can, best by date of May 9, 2011 printed on the bottom. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear straw gold color with a half inch white head. Not much of any head retention or lacing. Aroma is very, very weak, but I can smell some corn and grain. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also a slight metallic taste noticable. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's thin and a bit watery with decent carbonation. Overall I just don't like this brew. Even for the style of beer this is, it's not one of the better adjunct lagers out there. It was a chore just to finish the can. For $1.39, I think I paid too much for this."
"The appearance is just like any other tasteless Busch beer, the smell is horrible and the taste is like drinking beer that has gone bad for like ten years. overall this beer tastes like dirt mixed with carbonated water. It seems like it was only brewed for underage drinkers and homeless people who just want to get drunk. PLEASE AVOID THIS BEER. Sam Adams and Fat Tire is where it is at!!!"
"I had picked up this a week or two ago while I was out and wanted more beer, 6 16 oz. for 4.75. Saw the last one in my fridge and figured I would review it while I had the chance(b/c I wont be buying this again)."
"D- Harsh and watery. Musty and not enjoyable."
"This is a good drinking beer. It looks and smells very average has a nice flavor, and drinks well. The higher alchohol content adds to its allure. I would drink it again for sure. It is not watery like most american beers. Wish they carried it at our golf course I would drink more."
"Feel is in stride with the smell and taste, a touch of citrusy grain helping it along. Fairly good drinkability given the lack of challenges and decidedly better than that Beer 30 I had last night."
"Thin and watery mouthfeel, too much carbonation, harsh to drink. A terrible beer, and a drain pour."
"Poured into a pint glass. This beer looks like every other macro lager, but even lighter and more watery. Foamed up nicely, left no swirling. Not much of a smell, but what is there is slightly floral, mostly corn. Tasted like metal and corn. Not much beer taste at all, but a metallic unpleasant after taste. This isn't the worst beer I have ever tried, but it is certainly bottom tier."
"Smells of some sweet corn and some floral notes. Tastes much the same maybe some hop extract in there somewhere. There's not that much going on here. Fairly thin mouthfeel and moderate drinkability."
"D- Good cheap beer. I would say a malt liquor light and its good for when you are broke and wanna get drunk but hate natural ice."
"Beer #3 during Swill Tour 2010. It pours a clear urine topped by an uber-urine-y few fingers of white suds. The nose is only malt husk...though I think I can get some cashews in there too. It ain't ""bad""...just not good. The taste makes me unhappy. Maybe some wheat, corn, whatever flavors elicit images of personality-less folks in bowler hats. Seriously, this is one lazy-ass beer, folks. The body is quite light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish. Yeah, this is pretty meek. It ain't all that bad, just...it's the wallflower at the party who's all really shy and when that decent-looking gal over there asks him to dance (I assume out of pity or something) he stutters and wets his pants, fleeing in even greater ignominy than usual. Yeah."
"This pours a pale golden color with fading lacy foam on the surface.The smell is light on the nose. There is a light malty sweetness on the nose and and a slight corn smell in the back. Other parts of the nose have a mineral like aroma. There is a bit of a spice aroma on the tip of the tongue, but followed swiftly by the corn syrup flavor, which to its credit isn't that potent. There is a slight souring from the cheap hops. There is a granola like husk taste throughout. It's not really that complex, the mouthfeel is just as weak as I would expect. You could probably drink this if you want a cheap beer. Other than that I'm relatively indifferent with this beer."
"Absolutely the worst beer in my opinion. Very rough taste and bitter after taste persistently exist after every swallow. Color seems non existent. Can not hold flavor from the second the cap is cracked. No refreshing qualities in my opinion about this beer."
"$1.39 a tall boy at my local CVS. I don't why when I'm looking for a cheap beer I seem to pick this one. It's not good in any way. I've seen other reviews stating the aroma and taste of over cooked grains, kinda cabbage-y. All true. It's good for a quick buzz or to finish off a night of drinking but that's about it. I would pick this over a Bud Ice but then again that's not saying much is it."
"pours a pale yellow, almost no head, smells like over cooked grain, tastes like it too. watery in the mouth, and all i can say it is possible to drink, but whether or not you would want too. other wise if you want american macro this isn't it to me."
"Tough to get down tastewise with something that smells awful. Alcohol is there, not much else, maybe some ample carbonation if you're into that kind of thing. It is kinda heavy for an adjunct lager. Don't look for any hops. At least some beers just taste like water, this tastes like bad water and alcohol. Pass."
"If you love horrible hangovers, this is the best beer you can have! Icehouse is cheap and really should not be drank by anyone who considers themselves a beer connosseur. If you are a 21 year old poor college kid, this is amazing beer, if you are not, this is a skunky brew."
"I remember the days when an ice house can 24 pack was considered a splurge off my regular diet of natural light. This beer is watery and skunky with a touch of alcohol. This bad boy will give you the worst hangover ever but its really not that bad to drink."
"D- Overall this is something of ""malt liquor light."" better than some adjuncts, and good enough for what it is."
"The mouthfeel is light and has a good amount of carbonation. This is actually quite drinkable, the taste isn't off-putting, and it doesn't make you want to pour it out. It's light enough and refreshing enough that you can put away quite a few of them."
"This beer smells metallic and corny. It tastes like cream corn and malt. Feels bubbly and goes down easy, harder to drink as it warms. For the price, it'll do the trick. Not bad when you're paying 99 cents for a 24 oz."
"Everyone has their own opinion about what a beer should be, even within it's own style. Icehouse is, to my palate, not something that should be consumed. I typically review beers at room temperature since I don't usually mind the taste at room temperature and in some beers actually prefer it. At room temp. Icehouse is harder to swill than most cheap beers. While not so bad as Milwaukee's Best Ice and some others it doesn't have many redeeming characteristics. The aroma is very metallic and almost overwhelmingly that of corn instead of barley malt. There is barely any hop character if at all. The main redeeming quality of this beer is its price point, which admittedly for my area at least is hard to beat. Give it a try if you like Stroh's and other inexpensive ice beers."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can AUG0910-RO8011023. Sampled on May 26, 2010. Ah yes, it is 93 degrees, the air conditioner is not installed yet and I needed a beer. This was perfect for such an occasion with its pale yellow pour, overly carbonated head, skunky aroma, and vaguely malted but fizzy taste. As a craft beer it cannot compare to anything. But for a day like today it was perfect. That's about all I have to say about that."
"For the cost this beer isn't bad. It has a nice malty taste and it has a high alcohol content, so it's good for getting humans completely wasted. I'd say buy this beer if you want a high alcohol content lager for a low price."
"As a side note... their new labels look pretty cool."
"RJT"
"first taste was of cooked corn and also grain.. i was shocked at how light it felt in the mouth, not much malt/hop detection.. kind of a dry finish.. not much aftertaste.. as for drinkability its a good swill and session if you want something like this haha."
"For about a year this was my dad and uncle's go to beer here in Arkansas. A 30-pack can be had for about $13 up at the Missouri state line and this quenched our thirst for a whole summer and more. To be honest, I'm partial to Icehouse and find it to be better than or equitable to most American Adjunct Lagers."
"Overall: One of the most unrefined beers in my opinion. Forget Coors, Icehouse is like a freight train coming into your living room."
"Drinkability? Not a bad quaffer at all but one to ""enjoy"" quite cold as there's nothing to be gained by letting it warm up...."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Well, this pretty much an average example of this style. Clean clear yellow with a thin, white head without much retention or lacing. A slightly sweet, grainy aroma. A neutral, slightly sweet, slightly grainy flavor. The thin watery body we expect from this style. This is as drinkable as beer flavored water gets. If you're going to drink this style, there both better and worse examples."
"from 22oz. bottle poured into a highball glass it has a dark golden color that doesn't really appeal to me the smell not so bad if you swirl in the glass and smell it actually has really grainy smell. I am not a fan of the taste. Mouthfeel is about average for its class of beer and its drinkability is not so harsh if you can get over the taste. I would much rather drink Bud Ice and its the same price. All and all to me not a good beer!"
"Tastes just about the same, clean with maybe a bit of stale corn grainy taste, and almost the slightest hint of sweetness that tries to come through with a faint metallic. Very thin, alittle dry, somewhat drinkable but even for a lighter beer this could give you a stomach ache or that bloated feeling some cheapo brands tend to do. I dont see much of a point to this beer, save your money or get yourself a couple decent 40's."
"so I tried the can version of this btich. you know what? it was exactly the same. well, it didn't smell like I was actively haivng my face farted on, but it was close enough. the qualities are the same as my bottle review, so go there for the few details I give."
"D: I had two.. I mean i had to.. i mean i'm had too"
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink many of these. Good beer if you're looking to get drunk or play a drinking game. Not good for its taste purposes, but easy to get down surely."
"I would not recommend this beer, unless you just want to get wasted, there is hardly anything to offer."
"Gold to light yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma and flavor is pretty much grainy and bready.A good macro beer that is a good fit for any type of outing.Drinkable and smoooth a good deal at 13.00 for a case of bottles.I would recommend and would purchase again."
"My buddy Rob reports that it's considerable better if you can find it in bottles."
"D: A beed bar, but inoffensive flavor and very affordable price."
"D: This beer is very drinkable, but I would only drink it to get to get drunk. Not a sipping beer, but it gets the job done!"
"Poured out of a can into a glass. Golden color, 3/4"" white bubbly head. Actually left some lacing. Smells like corn and grains. Very crisp taste, bitter, grainy, smooth. Typical American pilsner. Little bit of a bitter aftertaste that vanishes pretty quickly. I still think this is a pretty good pils, because of the abv this leaves one feeling pretty relaxed! Can't beat the price; 30 for $15!"
"Note: The scoring in this review is based on the style of industrial lager. It should be viewed as a reflection of this beer in comparison to other cheaply made, mass produced fizzy yellow beers."
"Appearance is a light golden yellow with a nice crisp head. Smell has a corny adjunct aroma and not much of anything else. Taste is pretty much the same with light sweet corn and mild hops. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Overall there's not much going on here, just a easy drinking adjunct lager."
"Poured from a 24oz. can. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smells of corn and malts. Taste is crisp, some malts, corn is present, fairly refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall for $1.25 a 24 oz. can, I can't complain at all."
"Drinking this at almost 50 degrees was my first mistake. This puppy needs to be consumed at the coldest possible temperature to choke it down. Sweet with a noticeable fruity alcohol presence. The grains are fairly husky and rough and there is not really any hop presence to balance things out. Icehouse is a pretty typical higher abv offering from the macros...not really meant to be enjoyed for the flavor, but makes an efficient alcohol delivery system."
"Not much to say about this one. Just a run of the mill macro. Very watered down, low abv, fizzly carbonation, transparent straw in color. Corn and grain along with a cereal and metallic note comprise the nose and flavor. Avoid, plenty of better adjucts to be had"
"This is the first time I have had this beer and I am presently surprised. After being hooked on Red Dog ( I'm strapped for cash, so cheap 40's for me!) I didn't think this would fair much better, but I have found a new love. The taste is nothing special but it does wonders after a hard day of work. Smell is pleasantly sweet and nice. I'm quite fond of this beer and will most definitely purchase Icehouse again. Good job ""Plank Road."""
"The mouth is a little thin; I thought there'd be a bit more carbonation on the tongue. This is a decent refreshing lager. Nothing harsh about this at all. Some buttered bread and corn flavor is about all I'm getting, but it's more flavorful than any of the other BMC lager mainstays. Not bad for the beach, but I most likely won't get this again."
"D: this beer is refreshing and easy drink when its a hot summer day so it does what it is supposed to do i like this beer dont think it deserves a d though maybe c-"
"Out of a forty bottle this beer was a perfectly clear gold color. The one-finger of off-white head retained well as a collar and left impressive lacing in sheets. The aroma was distinctly unpleasant, macro grains, stale grains, skunky malt and wet wood. The flavors were no better. Dry, grainy, skunky and boring. The mouthfeel was rough and a little slick, the body medium and the carbonation medium. I was not happy to have a full forty of this to deal with. I always hate to fail a beer but this one sucked in several categories, especially the flavor one that matters."
"Cheers!!"
"D: This is surprisingly adequate. For a bargain ice beer from Miller, easily drinkable and inoffensive. It's not a good beer, but it is a complete beer. It at least achieves mediocrity, if only coincidentally."
"My first thought was that the big boys sure can make a pretty beer. It had a fluffy finger's worth of bone-white head with decent retention. The nose was pretty weak with a mild lager sweetness deep down, but it was not readily obvious. The color was a golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Again, think pretty, not good. Mouthfeel was on the thin side with a very unobtrusive flavor on the tongue. In fact, my tastebuds decided to take a break at one point and wait for something to happen. It never did. The finish just went down like tap water. This was not an evil beer, like many that I have tried in cans. It was simply ho-hum boring."
"D: But for the carbonation, goes down easy and fast."
"Overall it was a standard for my roomate in college so I crushed my fair share. I can still see havin a few now. There's worse beer out there."
"Poured a 12oz can into my Sam Adams perfect pour pint glass. This beer pours a light clear straw with a nice 2 inch white fish eyed head leaving no lacing. The aroma is canned corn, a bit of sugar, and fresh corn. The flavor is right up the same line. The is definite flavors of corn, an odd aspartame sweetness, just a hint of of grass, and a bit of booze. The mouthfeel, in my opinion is the saving grace for most AAL's but this one blows it. It finishes overly sweet and not dry at all. I like my AAL's to finish really dry leaving the palate wanting some more. This one completely lacks the quality. If it wasn't for how crappy the mouthfeel is, this would be a pretty average Macro Lager."
"Drinkability is decent. You can kill a whole case of this stuff in a matter of hours with friends, as well as drink it for good times. Otherwise this is a College 101 class beer for the student masses."
"Overall, I'd give this a D. It's a step above a Malt Liquor of some kind, but you'd probably be better off sticking to a malt liquor than this stuff."
"A pretty average beer for a low price. I'm in college so sometimes its all I can afford. Poured out of bottle into a normal pint glass there is some head but it fades rather quickly with literally no lacing at all. The smell is of any light beer although this one isn't. The taste is about the same as the smell, very light followed by the alcohol. Not much here but its a beer that I could drink a few of."
"Was visiting in South Carolina and picked up a can in the grocery store. I didn't get to pour into a glass so not sure about the appearance. The smell was very good and the taste was refreshing. I had only one but wished that I could have had several. Normally I like a more complex taste but on that warm day it hit the spot perfectly."
"D - As with most macros, drinkability for the masses is their M.O. not offensive, but not terribly stimulating either. A solid ""C" in this category."
"Not the worst beer I have ever had, but on the list. Just not good. I can get better beer cheaper than this that may not have as much abv but is far superior."
"It tastes like skunky beer. It also has one of the lowest ABV% for an ice beer so getting drunk even takes more painful tasting than other ice beers."
"D- Not great, it is quite watery for a beer with a high ABV so I guess that should help it's drinkability but I personally am not rushing to grab another."
"Overall, nothing I would buy. I got this from a friend, I mean it's not the worst, but it's just not craft."
"Icehouse doesn't taste bad. It just doesn't taste good. There's nothing here that I can say turned me off to this beer. It's plain, old, beer. It is better than Bud Light, I will admit. For me, this beer is a waste of time. But not a waste of money. You will, however, be a waste if you drink enough of these beers."
"Overall: not good"
"D- OK, watery and very bland even by macro standards. Decent if you're looking for a cheap buzz."
"D: Not very flavorful but better than most macros, goes down very easily since there isn't much to it, likewise not filling at all, decent kick, good representation of a Fizzy Yellow Beer but taking it for what it is, I think it's not too bad compared to other beers of it's kind."
"D- Drinks like fizzy water."
"Watery-crisp with vivid carbonation. Best served Icehouse-cold, flirting with the freezing point, as in one step short of 'Beersicle'."
"For all the major ice beers, like Keystone Ice, Bud Ice, Natural Ice, Ice house is the best, it might have slightly less alcohol, which might account for it tasting just a little better than those others. It's a typical Ice beer, nice and yellow, with that malt beverage taste to it, but more good old beer flavor than malt beverage, unlike the other ice beers I think."
"A clear light yellow pour with a two finger bubbly white head,pretty good carbonation. Aroma of corn and yes maybe a hint of hops in there.Flavor is faint hops,some dry grain, and hay. Thin to medium body,short finish.Normal mouthfeel. Drinkable, I guess."
"I have never forgiven Miller for inflicting this beer upon me throughout college. Bright gold pour, oily, with a white head. Chemical sweet mix of corn, nail polish remover, and sweetener. Taste is a disaster of corny, metallic pee with some sugar mixed in to ""ice"" it. The only thing worse than drinking it is the hangover. WORST. BEER. EVER."
"I think they left some chemicals in the vat after the previous cleaning? Man, this stuff tastes like it should have a warning label on it about possible toxins. It looks okay IF you want to see what the hell you just took a sip of... I guess I am spoiled after drinking 'proper' beers."
"The body is a very clear pale yellow with quite a bit of bubbles in the body. There is a lot of white head and lace. The lace is very spread out but there is a lot of it all the same. It has a watery and thin mouthfeel. There is not much to smell, a little stale and adjunct. The taste is about the same. The flavor is watered down and grainy. It has sort of detergent like taste. Not much to this beer it is pretty neutral cheap beer designed to get you drunk. So it is good at serving its intended task."
"Taste: This is a rather bland and boring beer, even for a macro, but I suppose nobody ever drinks macros because they taste good."
"Drinkability: I could drink this IF I had to but since I don't I will not be. I mean after the first i'm sure you get drunk enough that the next few so long as they are cold are ok but for the love of beer i won't drink this again."
"Drinkability is fairly low. It's not very tasty, but not the worst of the style either. I could do without it."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a three finger head. Head is white and carbonated. Aroma is basic, barley and malt. Taste has a lot of yeasty with some barley, especially in the aftertaste. Taste also has some metallic to it. Mouthfeel is light, expected for a macro, and very carbonated. This was offensive and not enjoyable, not recommended as a session beer."
"The metal in the can leaves a metalic taste, there is no sense of hop, or malt. the 5.5 ABV% is the other saving grace. Its no craft beer lager, but when its this or light/lite go with this every time!"
"D - It cheap and sessionable, but certainly not a great tasting lager."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a light thin body. The carbonation helps it out a bit. Just a beer to sit and pound or maybe do yard work with."
"The taste is cooked rice with a little funky, old, sweet apple juice. It then finishes with a faintly acrid, sharp, softly oily soap taste and feel that isn't really bitter but almost is. It leaves an aftertaste of light cooked rice with a little soap and a soapy feel. Throughout, it's thin, very bland, the flavours ghostly, and it;s a bit watery except the oily soap quality. At first, it's ok and kind of drinkable, being mostly just a bland, basic but ok lager quality. However, after a bit the soap element becomes quite tiresome and tends to take over the drink too much."
"Wow where to start. This beer just takes the cake as the worst beer i have every had in my entire life. I had a fresh cold one and it just tasted like metal and alcohol. If your gonna buy something for a cheap buzz, maybe get Natty or anything really stay away from this one. NO GOOD. I also made the mistake of trying one when it was warm. That was just a bad call on my part and I could not finish the can. One of the only beers that I have deemed worthy of being poured out."
"D: Fair at best, nothing spectacular. The 40 oz with 5.5% abv gives you a cheap buzz."
"Overall not undrinkable if you want a cheap lager with a hefty ABV, but I suggest drinking it ice-cold. If you let it warm the clean crispness disappears and it just tastes like a cheap grainy can of swill."
"D - This is pretty low as far as macros go, though I recall giving it a higher rating when having it out of the can a couple of months back. Either way, what I drank last night highlighted a lot of negative aspects of macro lagers."
"Golden color with a small white cap on top. Aroma was a little foul with some (sorry) piss-skunky smell to it. Sweet, tart-bitter, relatively strong flavors of corn, malt, wheat and rice. Not good. Took some grimacing to get it all down. Aftertaste is harsh. I won't get it again."
"D- Full marks as frankly, this is something that I'd be alright with having during an evening. It's fresh, decent American lager that Miller has done a decent job with. Amongst lagers, this rates right up there!"
"Pours a very pale straw color with a large head that fades quickly. Some lacing is left on the glass. The beer has a metallic smell along with adjunct aromas. Not the best looking or smelling macro. The taste is about average. It is on the drier side of the style. Not much for hops or any thing special about the malt bill. Carbonation seems mild for the style but the body is quit thing. If I am going to drink a macro lager I can find more tasty alternatives."
"This isn't horribly bad, but I can't get excited about drinking it whatsoever. I would be much happier taking High Life over this. Not even sure what the point of this beer is for Miller, since High Life packs just as much alcohol. As with just about any alcoholic product, it grows on you as you get intoxicated. If I wanted to get tanked I'm sure I would not care much about the flavor by about beer #3. Probably won't buy again. Even if I get tired of High Life, there are other better choices."
"I used to drink this back in college and remember it being full bodied. Whered the body go?"
"At 5.5 ABV, this is a nice heavy macro. It goes well with my morning tacos (no I'm not an alcoholic, I work nights), and supplements the Mexican morning cuisine I am so used to. It smells kinda funky, but tastes nice and strong, and goes down smoothly. But, because of the gravity, and the extra bitterness present, it isnt as drinkable as it could be. But, I still enjoy this one nonetheless!"
"It's been a LOOONG time since I've tried this...about 6 years or so....so I thought I'd give it another shot. Was told by my friendly neighborhood distributor that they just lowered the price...to $11.99 a case for bottles!!! I haven't paid that for bottled beer for YEARS! SO, I'm giving it a whirl now...and Icehouse really isn't that bad! Smoooth...a touch of hops....and very malty. I would much rather have a couple/few of these than a TON of Miller Lite (it's ""SISTER BEER"") any day! WHY?? Because it makes you feel good QUICK...kinda tastes like an old-time American macro, and has more flavor than the Lite sister! I would recommend this to anyone who's on a budget, and who wants a decent, American macro...for one HELLUVA PRICE!!! OH, they (Plank Road Brewery) claim that they've changed the beer somewhat, recently, so that may just have done the trick to make it better than the days of old. Decent, drinkable, and 5.5% ABV!!! CHEAP, TOO! What more do you need?!?!? Take care and CHEERS my BA FRIENDS!!!"
"At 5.5% we have a heavyweight macro on our hands? Will it stand up to the best? No. Yellow color and a tan head. Aromas are faint and very grainy. The taste is a bit bitter and stale. The body is light and foamy. Not a very drinkable beer. I think I would have a water or better yet, a stout."
"Not good at all, but not bad for the price."
"It's certainly not the worst I've ever had. I got a can specifically to review it and because I didn't want any skunk from the bottled version detracting from the beer. Like I said, not bad for the style, but a style that I generally pass on."
"Poured to a very light yellow with a white head. Head lasted for a little while. Had a little lacing, but nothing to brag about. Didnt really have much of a smell. Just of maybe some grain and a hint of alcohol. Didnt have much of a taste either. Kind of reminded me of water. Kind of flavorless. Felt like water in the mouth. Carbonation was evident and I think it had to much carbonation. If this was your lawnmower beer, it would have to be ice cold. All and all not that bad. Just seemed like your were drinking water. The extra alcohol was evident. So on a hot summer day, you would have to be carefull."
"It went down fast. Almost water like. Kind of leaves a cottonmouth feel in the mouth. The aftertaste reminds me of a gross hangover when i was 17 years old. This is a cheapo beer by all means - you can taste the cheapness. But if you want to get all drunk for cheap. go for it! it's not horrible or undrinkable."
"Enjoy."
"24 oz. can from the 7-11 to accompany my half-smoke with relish, mustard and onions. Chill hazed lazy pee-pee color with a thin soapy head. Aroma of muted corn/ cereal grain. Tasted only faintly corny and otherwise very smooth and clean for a macro (keeping it cold is key). The body is just barely more than light - maybe a quarter of the way from light to medium. It's really quite nice with down market urban economy food. Finish is almost nil with a hint of cereal grain. There is a time and place in my sad life for this beer I'm afraid."
"I could drink more of these when I am in the cheap macro-drinking mood that I find myself in sometimes."
"24 oz. can left over from the previous night's Super Bowl get-together. Pours a slightly darker than usual, crystal clear golden color. Forms a short-lived foamy head that disappears into nothing in no time. Quite fizzy, but that's not really a surprise. Aroma is a basic macro sweet malt/corn combination. Taste is crisp and somewhat bolder than Bud/Miller/Coors with a slight bitterness/metallic taste on the finish. Cheap (in both price & quality) hops notes. Mouthfeel is light & watery. Overall, it's your basic macro lager. Good for getting wasted at a frat party, or if you're between paychecks. Or like last night, it works for washing down buffalo wings while watching football. You can do slightly worse, but SO much better!!!"
"A middle of the road cheap macro lager. Looks like the typical, golden/yellow color of a macro. Smells kind of like fermented fruit mixed with metal. One can definitely taste the alcohol in this lager, but not so much after the first one (presumably because all of your tastebuds have been killed). Not the worst I have ever had, but I will never buy it again."
"Pour is very similar to all macro lagers coming from BMC, except this was was slightly harsher to drink. Smoothness is not there as with most lagers, although there is a crispness contributed from an abundant source of carbonation."
"Pours clear pale straw with a small head. Aroma is mild and somewhat sweet- fairly typical macro smell. Light malt and adjuncts. A touch of grassy hops and a dull sweetness. Smooth light mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable. Overall a very average macro. The only thing that really distinguishes it is the slightly higher than usual abv."
"- I will try a fresher version of this beer in the future and will update this review if necessary. As it stands, not very fond of this offering."
"I can honestly say out of drinking probably a thousand different beers this beer gets an award for being in the top ten worst beers I have ever drank! Yuk! A weird grainy malty taste and nothing else! I am hardcore. So when I say a beer is nasty I guarantee you it is! Hopefully in the future the beer industry will create a beer that is high in alcohol, tastes good, low priced, and low in the deadly congeners that are causing health problems in the U.S. and abroad. Beware!"
"Icehouse has a special place in my heart because it's the first beer I ever got drunk on. Maybe that's the reason I like the taste of it, but I think it's actually one of the best cheap beers you can buy. Maybe the best. The only other ice beer I like better is Molson. Icehouse is a great beer to get if you're having a party but you don't hate your friends enough to buy Bud Light."
"overall, this is not one of my beers of choice however there was one in the fridge and i was feeling bored"
"D - I remember this being better than it actually is when I had it a few years back and this will be the last time I pick it up"
"Perhaps the nice thing about Icehouse is that it doesn't taste bad, it just has little taste. No need to pour it out of bottle or can, there's no missing flavor unlocked in a glass. The color is straight yellow and very light at that. There's hardly any smell, as you get the feeling quickly you're drinking an American light beer, but they've replaced some water w/ alcohol (5.5% abv). Not bad for a pitcher when you're eating wings, but other than that you're just asking for a stomach ache and bells in the brain if you're chillin' with this."
"Had this at a friends house not too long ago and just now getting to it. The appearance is pale yellow with little white head that fell quickly leaving now lace. Smell is non-existant for the most part..maybe some of the adjuncts in there...not much else. Taste is bland. Overall the beer is bland and like all macros as it warms is terrible, bordering on undrinkable. Great for quenching your thirst when hot and sweaty and you're out of water...other than that...I don't think so"
"D- I always have had tremdous hangovers off this stuff with bad headaches."
"Drinkability: Never again... Yeah you could drink this all day.... but why would you?"
"overall if you call this drinkable then you need to try other options, even in cheap beers. I couldn't finsh 1 can and thats on my college budget taste. Horrible."
"This beer is perfectly inoffensive, an important characteristic in a cheap macrolager. It has almost no taste, a bit of alcohol and a smattering of bitterness. It goes down like water and thats the reason to drink it if your going for a cheap buzz and can't stomach malt liquor."
"D: If this is a beer to drink fast to get drunk, Miller is not doing a very good job, I just got bored with it by the middle of the can."
"Two down, two to go. Natural Ice is coming up soon."
"Overall an average middle of the road macro."
"Pours the usual light yellow color with a lingering head. Aroma is strong and there's a bit more corn flavor but not by much. Taste is much of the same except that it's stronger, somewhat bitter and leaves a bland aftertaste. Burns a bit going down as well. Haven't had Icehouse in years and I'm reminded of why I stopped drinking it in the first place."
"TRY IT!"
""
"Overall a typical mac in a can. I was hopeing for more. Even as a mower brew. Best when cold. Icehouse Cold!"
"Then it warms a bit. It goes from being a pleasant 'lawnmower' beer to awful swill.A shame really as cold it's one of the better macros."
"Drinkability makes me wonder why I'm a beer-drinker tonight - and why I'm at this place again."
"Well I was out at dinner and it was this or bud light. Poured a pale golden yellow with a white foamy head that faded to nothing in mere seconds. No lace and lots of carbonation. Smell was really of nothing, maybe a slight muted corn or grain, but really nothing. The taste was balnd, tolerable when ice cold, but really absolutly nothing to write home about. Overall ehh, not again unless I have to. No life, or profile to it at all."
"This is your typical mass-produiced, highly advertised big beer with golden yellow pour, high carbonationa and grainy nose and flavor. Bottom line..itÂ’s an okay beer for the price, when consumed from an ice cold mug on a hot day. Beyond that, let it go."
"Tangy,grainy mouthfeel with some slight cloying. Not a beer I would buy,but no too bad for a Macro. Used to buy this a lot when it first came out,probably because of the 5.5% and the 6% limit in WV. The things we did when we were young. Still drinkable just couldn't drink lots of these. Wouldn't turn one down if I was thirsty nothing offensive here just not a beer that fits in my fridge."
"Aroma is typically beery. Looks like the average straw-yellow US macrobrewed beer. Taste is OK, not bad but not exciting or exceptional either. Both aroma and taste are mainly malty, with just a hint of bitterness. This brew does not have much to it, but it is OK if nothing else is available. Good for parties and sporting events, or for whenever you want a beer but don't want to focus too much on your chug."
"Drinkability: Decent. Nothing exciting, just an easy ultra-light American lager."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's pretty light bodied. It's crisp and goes down easy. On a hot day, I could take it if it was really cold, but it wouldn't be my beer of choice. But, drinkability is limited simply because it's not very good. Overall, it's tolerable for a macro, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it."
"This poured a pale bright gold with a small, thin head and no retention. Tons of carbonation, appearance of a bad champagne. The smell is heavy in poor-quality malts and a burn from the carbonation. Again heavy in malts in the taste, like a malt liquor. Thin and unimpressive in the mouth. The finish is smoother than the rest but nothing noteworthy here."
"Pours to a thin white head that fades to a ring but leaves bits of foam on the side of the glass if you swirl it a bit. Color is pale yellow similar to Pabst or MGD. Aroma is corn, sweet malt and a bit of alcohol. Flavor is clean and a bit sweet, maybe due to the corn, malt and extra alcohol. Finishes dry and clean. This is an economical pale American lager that has no apparent style flaws and fits the style well. A solid citizen."
"Other than a slight lingering corny sweetness, this beer is as easy to drink as water. This is an average AML, and a good bet if you are on a budget, or need an easy drinker for caps or beer pong."
"Got a 6 of this as a Xmas gag gift. I figured I might as well review it to sharpen my tasting skills, as there probably wouldn't be a lot to taste. Pours straw colored with a miniscule head that quickly disappears. Smells of seltzer and a little grain. Hits the tongue with a seltzer taste, then a hint of malt mixed with a taste that reminds me of the aroma from the grain we feed our horses. Upon swallowing, ALL taste disappears! Feels like I just had a sip of water. Not even a good lawnmower beer for the summer months. I will throw it in the back of the fridge for non-beery houseguests. This is still the cleanest tasting, least objectionable Miller product I've ever tasted (not that that happens often; certainly won't anytime soon)."
"D- This beer has a combo of sulfury dry hops and lots of fizz that is just not very appealing. The fizz is the strongest player in this beer not the malt or the hops."
"will not buy again."
"Overall, I never actually tasted this beer until today. I've drank it a few times and thought it was ok, but never *tasted* it. Don't taste it. Just enjoy the buzz."
"Pours a medium-pale yellow with a large, white, frothy head that diminishes to a short-lived film and leaves some lacing behind. The smell is nothing special, corn and alcohol are most prominent. The taste is a big improvement over the nose though. Corn and grain of course, but thereÂ’s a pleasant maltiness to it and a light hint of hops. The finish is warm and dry, with some alcohol coming on a little stronger but still not too offensive. It has a medium body, dry texture and lively carbonation. Now granted, I wasnÂ’t expecting much from this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It wasnÂ’t terrible at all. In fact, it was oddly satisfying. IÂ’d consider giving it an above average rating if it werenÂ’t so corny."
"I'd go with Milwaukee's Best Ice if looking for ice beer, it is as flavourful as Mil Best Original and really does a fantastic job of masking the alcohol content. But why not drink a good malt/double malt beer if looking for high alcohol content though, more flavour to be found there."
"A great brew if you are looking to save some money and drink quite a few."
"Opinion: Well, I hate to admit it, but I drank this beer quite a bit before I knew what good beer was. Now that I know, I probably won't finish this glass. This beer is hollow and only has a higher than average alcohol content. I bought this beer as a single bottle, and it is a good thing because I wouldn't want any more of this one. Whew!"
"Icehouse was a very clear light golden color with a shortlived fizzy white head. The smell was lightly sweet and grainy. The taste was light and grainy as well with a lightly bitter, dry finish. The mouthfeel was light with medium to high carbonation. Not a good beer."
"You can't even drink this when your already drunk... It has a malicious odor. It is offensive. It tastes like can mixed with creekwater. It also has enough alcohol in it that it gets the misguided people that drink it really messed up after a six pack of 16 oz cans."
"An ok Macro."
"like most of its resemblances, this beer does not make an impression to me, but this within the spectrum by above of bud and bud light, blond color, defined body slight flavor and with content within standard of alcohol the beers to lager, finishes sending a new image and promotional campaign, to replace its mark, rare in the border but to the aim can be obtained; good for Mexican and American kitchen recommendable 65%"
"Drinkability: I had to choke this down. This was just flat out bad, and there is no way I'll ever drink it again."
"Typical macro. Watery and virtually tasteless."
"Typical mass produced swill, nothing unusual here."
"This beer is just terrible. First off I got it skunked and the fact that it is so cheap should set off some lights. Anyways I was dared to drink one for ten dollars and god for bid after i drank this shitty beer the ten dollars wasn't worth it. The color looked worse then piss, well actually at first I thought it was piss. Well not really but this beer was just utterly disgusting looking. It was all down hill from there. Yes I got my ten dollars but in retrospect it wasn't worth it. Beware of shitty beer."
"Drink to get drunk."
"M/D: Medium bodies for a macro lager, high carbonation, smooth but bland. Not terrible, but did give my stomach the feeling that I drank too much water."
"Overall: A below average macro, not recommended. And contrary to urban belief, the 5.5% ABV is not worth the sacrifices in flavor."
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow, big fluffy white head forms, settles down to a layer and some lacing on the glass. Good retention for a macro. Smell is sweet with some slight citrus and honey, little bit of grass and grains, some rice. Taste is sweet honey, some citrus and little bit of floral. Clean finish with a little bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Not a bad macro lager, there are worse."
"Overall i cant tell if i can tolerate it much. It seems decent at times, but i dont know if i could drink this on a weekly basis. not completely bad though, especially for the price. But i do have to say i would choose this over all the other miller products."
"Taste was a hollow malt, pinot gris type of flavor. Light, fizzy, bad finish."
"Purchased a twenty four ounce can. This beer pours a pale yellow, with a thick head. Smell is minimal, taste is fairly bland. Good alternative to drinking malt liquor, but not particularly interesting either. I would not recommend this unless you are looking for a cheap, mostly tasteless buzz."
"Yeah I like to pick up a sixer of beers I tried in my youth. If for no other reason just to see how my taste have changed, and this isn't all that bad. But when you compare it across the board it is well below average, but drinkable and halfway enjoyable."
"I've been plenty of places in the world where this would be considered decent beer ( when I was 16/Egypt), I think I'll pass unless either one of these 2 scenarios repeat themselves"
"Well now, I'm actually reviewing ""icehouse light', but BA doesnt seem to have that available. Frankly, they're both macro adjuct lagers, so the light vs. no light distinction is pretty unimportant. I gotta say . . I'm not hating it. Some of my younger bro's friends gave it to me for free and I'm not complaining. I'd rather a coors light if I'm stuck down this road, but the extra alcohol punch will get me where I'm goin' quicker and I can't begrudge the beer that. Yeah, it tastes lean and watery, not nearly as adjunct-y as a lot of other AmiMacro Lagers I've had. No complaints. Where the beer is free, there can never be any complaints . ."
"That's it, I have made a promise to my soul that I will never put this shit in my body again. It smells awful, like beer that has soured after a kegger with rotting corn and notes of crap. Taste: this swill would be better off with no taste. Dimethyl sulfides and phenolic initially. I get acrid corn, and think Miller said the hell with it, let's see what happens with this malt I found behind the forklift. The only part I wasn't disappointed with was the lack of aftertaste. Still not too drinkable from overbearing carbonation. I can't drink this anymore, Olde E sounds delicious in comparison. Even for this style of beer, Icehouse is wrong. I'm feeling like a genius for bringing my last Alpha King to hop out all of this Icehouse. Bad beer, if you can even call it that. I could brew better in my car trunk."
"Yes, just like every other macro, its a piss-yellow with some fizz and smells like grains and ass. With that said, I actually like it better than a lot of its counterparts. Its not a good beer, but for what its intended to be, I suppose its not all that bad. One of the first beers I ever started drinking back when I was in high school. If I remember right it was usually icehouse or bud ice. I think we just liked the fact it had a higher abv than busch or miller."
"VEry simple beer, not bothering, but neither interesting, at least I had my beer at that moment. Foam is present, is not green, at least not remarkably, and it has bubbling, so it is a good Macro Lager after all. I am not so sure if I had tatsed it before in 1999."
"I obtained the unusual 22 oz. bottle and pour it into a glass. There wasn't much of a head but it did leave a fair amount of lacing. I enjoyed the smell. Nothing weird. Just the way I imagined the very clear gold liquid to smell. I took a swig that went down very easily, leaving no aftertaste, the way I like it. The taste was pretty good. It wasn't slight like some American Macro's, nor was it funky, trying to be something it is not. Just straight up cereal malts with a little sweetness as if you put sugar on your Cheerios. There is a little bitterness which is due to the hops, or the fact that its ice brewed? Probably the ice brewey-ness. It is thin though, which isn't a plus. On the whole this a cheap beer I love. I hate the camos, hurricanes, etc so if I'm low on cash this is what you might catch me drinking."
"Probably one of my favorites when it comes to macro lager. It has very little smell to it and appears like you'd expect, but the beer tastes okay. Very weak hop and a decent tasting malty finish. It is very, very clean and refreshing. I can sit around drinking this for awhile without getting tired of the bad aftertaste I associate with many macros. I really don't think there is anything about the beer that is bad."
"Pretty good for ""free beer"" I guess. Stuck in the macro hell that is most of Jacksonville, you could do much worse than this one."
"You can't go home again, but I wiil drink it with the homies next time I'm out in Ohio, just for old times sake."
"Quite ordinary. Not as bad as most Macros, but far from quality. Hightly carbonate and clear yellow. Modestly creamy head that may or may not lace. Grainy sweet aroma with light hop detection. Tastes the same grainy sweet with the addition of cereal grains, decent hop bitter, yet little hop flavor. A grape skin or apple skin flavor. Finish has a grainy bittering. A bit corn sugar sweet in the end. Fairly crisp without drying."
"Most people would rather drink gasoline than Icehouse, but I quite like it. My favorite cheap beer and beer to get toasty upon."
"poured a very pale yellow color with a bountious white puffy head that would not leave. Smell is almost nothing, with maybe a bit of sweetness present. Taste follow through with a bit of sweetness and a cold refreshing taste. Finishes wet and not much else. Only thing keeping it from being a lawn mower beer is the 5.5% alcohol."
"Pale gold color with an off-white two finger head. Light bodied with good lacing. Aluminum and grain smell with a hint of malt. sweet/sour adjunct taste that gives a good bite. This makes it hard to swallow, and a poor session brew. Plank Road brewery misses the mark again. Your typical ""Ice"" beer is a hybrid of light lager and malt liquor, I'll choose either before having another Icehouse."
" Horrible gas takes the drinkability down a peg."
"Drinkability: It is not that bad for a macro. It is easy to get worst from the BMC guys. I didn't fell in love with that beer, but I don't hate neither. If I am stuck in a bar selling only macros, I would mind to have a drink of it again."
"Drinkablity: See above. I'd never get this again. Never."
"As much as I try to complete every sample of every beer I review, this one's gonna have to go down the drain. Not enjoyable, barely tolerable."
"Drinkability: For an ice beer....does the trick but it is so bitter and skunky"
"Pressed into service at a local pizza joint, this beer pours the typical light golden, completely clear, but with a nice white head. Some stickiness. Smell is not as corny as some (maybe this was fresher than most, I didn't check) but it does have that somewhat plain grain odor. Taste is mild, uninteresting, but matches the style. Thin mouthfeel but was not watery. There is nothing really wrong with this beer, but if you want something excellent, exciting, or exceptional, then this beer and beers of this style are not what you should be drinking."
"""It gets you drunk."" -Samuel Jackson. Besides that this blows. But really what did we expect. It is cheap but it pours a piss gold color with a yucky head. It smells like chemically booze. While it does have a crisp taste it tastes of molten ass. Not as bad as the beast I guess. Mouthfeel = n/a. Depending where you are in life, this is quite drinkable."
"Please don't allow yourself to be taken in by the museum-like picture on the front of the can. There is no concivable way, brewers of the past would have cooked up and sold this chemical cocktail. Can should come with a ""Mr. Yuk"" sticker. [scrapes tongue]"
"Fairly crisp and mellow, but the alcohol has to be the main reason for drinking this beer."
"24 oz. tallboy can in a bag. I notice the Loop 7/11 no longer sells malt liquor (but theyÂ’ve also dropped Pilsner Urquell, drat them), but I also notice the big cans of beer have their ABV printed on them, like this one (5.5% ABV). Pretty much what youÂ’d expect. Smell is nearly non-existent, but thatÂ’s a point in its favor since IÂ’ve had bad-smelling beers. With the first few sips, IÂ’m already getting gassy. And itÂ’s the same old adjunct-filled, hopless dry ""beer"" flavoring of any mega-brew. Force-carbonated like a seltzer water. Considering IÂ’m taking in enough alcohol for two vodka shots, IÂ’d have preferred the vodka shots."
"The beer pours your standard yellow color. And tastes like a standard corn-flavored macro from miller. It also smells like alkaseltser. there is one thing it has going for it and that is it has a stronger taste than MGD. Even though both beers are almost identical."
"In my opinion Icehouse is basically a malt liquor, however, it is a little better than most. The perfumey sweet aroma is there, as is the standard yellow color. Taste is sweet, adjunctish, and somewhat surprisingly a drop of hops. This is fairly easy to drink, basically Icehouse is where malt liquor meets cheap lawnmower beer."
"I like the label: I could see it from my office for the about 14 years I spent at Miller."
"My roomate showed up with a few of these the other day because they were cheep. The price can be easily justified after one taste. This is honestly the first beer that I dreaded finishing, and not just because I would be out of beer. Didnt even bother to pour this, really just wanted it gone, but I am not one to waste beer. Anyway a 22 oz is only $1 so thats equivilant to about $.50 for a 12 oz...so...$6 for a 12 pack if I have my math right. Good price/bad beer. Stay away from this unless you just want a quick buzz from the 5.5%ABV or if you just like nasty tasting beer."
"Icehouse is the worst of both worlds. Too nasty tasting for lovers of truly good beer and too flavorful for lovers of easy-drinking, virtually tasteless macro swill. It's a wonder that anyone buys this more than once."
"I poured the first bit in to a standard pint to give it a full rating. Big foamy fizzy head right off the bat. The head actually has a bit of retention surprisingly, and even faint lacing clings to the glass. Smell is sweet and bland, it has the typical mushy macro fragrance to it. Taste is barely there as well, hint of a flat malt taste, and a flavor I perceive to be Â“cornyÂ” No real notice of any hop flavor at all. Another beer I prefer out of the can, or in this case 40 where it glugs straight down and I donÂ’t have to deal with it too much. I will say that averaging at $1.50 a 40oz, this is the cheapest beer I can stomach, and unfortunately, IÂ’ve drank way too much of this stuff for one life time. Sure IÂ’ll have it again though when I only have a buck fitty to spare."
"Pours a straw color...big cooked corn and alcohol on the nose...smells like a mild Malt Liqour...tastes like it too...harsh alcohol flavor...cheap adjunty flavor..smooths out a little as you drink it but not a favorite of mine...there are many macros I'd pick over this including a lot of so called cheapies...and the ABV on this is only 5.5. or something like that....kind of a light malt liqour without the full flavor/sweetness that malt liquors pack.."
"I was in a cheep beer mood tonight so I tried some ""classics"". Icehouse poures a little darker than straw color with a decent white head that left a little lace down my glass. The smell was quite astringent with grain and alchohol dominating the scent. The flavor was not much to brag about either. The grain was overpowering and not balanced at all, the aftertaste of alchohol was not plesent and the lack of any bittering agent was sorely missed. But what can you expect from $1.25 a 24oz can? Average for the style at best."
"This is a good beer overall, one of millers better. nothing amazingly special about it but it has a deep enough taste to be a beer drinkers beer, yet not quite as powerful as some other beers. Easy to drink, goes down pretty smoth, not a bad aftertaste. not as watered down as some say, not as filling as some say either, in the middle between ultra dark and ultra water, descent balance."
"This is another one of those beers that will hurt your feelings. Tastes like ass and gives you the worst hangover a mortal man can imagine. It is cheap, but that's about all it has going for it. I can't say I have one good reason to drink this swill."
"Drinkability: Inoffensive and timid. the only things this has going for it are price and a lack of offensive flavors. Of course, it has no real good flavors, either. McBeer."
"This is my second review of macro lagers, and it's actually kind of fun, a back to the roots kind of thing. I bought a 24 oz. for $1.50, pretty good deal, I guess. Piss appearance, slight corn smell. No real flavor, basic adjunct flavors with no real aftertaste. Now I can really appreciate good stuff, but well worth the price."
"The beer pours a very pale gold color with a spotty white lace head. The aroma is less than average. It has a watery, pale malt scent with a skunky lager yeast smell. The taste is terrible. It is really bitter and watery. It is light on malts and heavy on the skunky finish; no complexity. The mouthfeel is also less than average. It is a low/medium bodied beer with way too much carbonation. This is a horrible brew. It's one and done for me."
"Weak and embarassing. I said I was going to boycott the big three. This is why I should stick to the boycott."
"Clear yellow look, adjunct foam head of little duration. Laces in slight rings, about 3 incomplete circles. Slightly petroleum aroma, sweet with a slightest bit of far off oil and gas mix for a two cycle engine. Flavor is slightly unusual, sweet in an antifreeze sense, grainy and rolling across the mid palete. Finishes relatively dryer (tight and arid hops) than the start, a slight nod to complexity. Reminds me of the old Pig's Eye Ice, not tasteless, a little different, but not much of a beer for my preferences"
"Picked up a bottle of this from a friends house so I could review it. My friends seem to always have this beer stocked so I gave it a chance. BIG MISTAKE. Icehouse is the worst ice beer I have ever tasted. Pours the usual macro corn yellow with a little bubbly head that fizzles away to quickly. The smell is potent, corn is the strong scent here, no smell of hops just strong corn with a small small hint of malt. The taste is what really makes this beer horrible, the taste is of nothing, absolutely nothing, like drinking dirty water. In the mouth the beer feels flat and warm. Not a drinkable beer, this beer was made to get f&^%*'d up, and that is about it. Ice beers are the true alcoholic beer, get drunk quicker and faster, sounds like fun...not!"
"I bought a big 24 oz. can of this stuff just to review it. I drank it from said can, so appearance was average based on that. Didn't smell like much, maybe a little malt, maybe not. No trace of hops anywhere in the smell or taste. Didn't make me gag, didn't taste good. Light and well-carbonated. This is a prototypical ""get drunk"" beer. The fact that it is called Icehouse and is brewed in 'Scony make me think they are trying to appeal to the ice fishing sect, but maybe it's just me."
"Cheers."
"CONCLUSION: Drink better beers! But if you are trapped without a choice Coors, Bud, Ice House, and MGD."
"this pours pale and unattractive and looks like typical bad beer. the smells makes me wince, because it sucks. it smells like corn and alcohol. the taste though is actually alright, clean and simple. on par or better than other cheap lagers. really no hop profile but a bit of grainy malt, a light alcohol touch finishes it off. not horrible, not good, its ok...gets the job done and thats about it."
"Drinkability: To be honest, I was expecting a lot worse. This is an average beer."
"A crystal-clear yellow-gold body is capped by a short head of creamy bright-white foam that holds fairly well before dropping to an average collar. Lacing is limited. The nose offers a generic beer aroma of sweetish malt and adjunct with a touch of non-descript hops. The body is medium and it's crisp in the mouth with a fine-bubbled, standard carbonation. In the flavor, a slightly grainy, sweetish malt is well-balanced by spicy and floral hop flavor and moderate bitterness along with a subtle apple-like fruitiness. It finishes crisp and dry; almost as if beer had never been there. Very clean and well-brewed but generally lacking in character."
"M"
"Aroma: Definite corn and rice approach to their malt profile sweet and slightly alcohol ridden after freezing the initial beer they filter out the ice here and what's left is a concentrated version of shit beer. Mouthfeel is thin but overcarbonated and nothing calling out to me. Drinkability: Not a beer I would chill with daily but it goes down easy and would get you crunked up, however if you like beer don't try this one."
"Drinkability: Really, you could do worse. But then, does anyone really aim for mediocrity? This is the sort of thing you drink during a hockey game. Early in the season. Definately not a Stanley Cup beer. Chug it, and move on to something better."
"Drinkability Â– I was ready to gag on this one (I had never tried it prior to this tasting), but was pleasantly surprised. Nice effort for the style (American ice lager)."
"Poured a honey gold color with a big foamy white head. The smell isn't so great. I can barely make out a hops aroma, but there's this weird metallic scent as well. Yummy. Taste is bland, and the mouthfeel is very, very thin. I guess you could pounds these back all day, since it wouldn't really do anything for you otherwise. Not enjoyable to drink, and certainly on the bottom-end of my list of cheap macro-lagers."
"Icehouse is made for one reason. To get you drunk. It's cheap and strong. The flavor was lacking. No hops, no malts, not much of anything except adjuncts and a generic lager taste. But it's not thin and goes down decently. This one wasn't made to taste good, just get you hammered."
"(See disclaimer at my review of Bud Light.) This one was poured vigourously as well but its head went away rather quickly. THe clarity is again flawless, perfectly crystal clear, and the color is a bit darker than the other beers in this session to this point (bud light, coors light, busch). THe aroma is also more ""beer-like"" from this beer - I actually get a hint of malt in the nose, and not much else. In fact, compared to a typical quality lager like a Munich Helles or Dortmund export style beer, the aroma is good, although with everything it could be bigger and bolder. The flavor features malty hints this time along with some other sweet notes that may be from corn or another cereal grain. The hop notes seem to be limited to simple bitterness. There is some hint of astringency at the end as well that is kind of puckering and reminds me a little of tea. I've been to concert venues where this was the strongest beer available. Under those circumstances, I wouldn't hesitate to buy one. Furthermore, I'd rather have this at family get-togethers than most macroswills."
"ng"
"I guess this would be an ok beer if you wanted to get a quick buzz, but its not one that I will search out. Much better macro alternatives available."
"Fizzy little clear yellow guy with a nice white head to start; none to finish. Lots of carbonation and streams of continuous bubbles. The nose of light malting and adjuncts. The taste is not too bad with a little sense of hopping and light flavor of adjuncts. This is a very thin watery brew with over carbonation."
"This brew poured a small white head of fine to medium sized bubbles and a weak pee water light yellow color. It has a mild hoppy aroma and leaves just a fair lacing. Its flavor is that of a typical fizzy weak rice beer, mild and uneventful. Continuous carbonation rises up the side of the glass. Can you spell BURP?"
"This beer poured a large creamy head with small bubbles that fully diminished. There was some lacing with this beer. The body was clear and yellow in hue. There was some carbonation observed with this beer. This beer had a light malty and hoppy aroma and also a citrus aroma. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and finished in the same way. The mouthfeel was light, thin and watery."
"Icehouse isn't the greatest domestic beer available today, but it tastes pretty good. The design for the label is great, and it has a real catchy name. The beer itself is sort of thick, and has an unusual taste to it, but not a bad taste. It is not a first choice beer for me, but certainly not a last choice either."
"For an icebeer this is exceptionally easy to drink. When cold it goes down fairly smooth. There is a bit of an aftertaste but nothing too bad. It's not much to look at and it's not terrible complex, but all things considered this is a good, economic beer. Nowhere near a Guiness, but it was never meant to be."
"The taste starts out innocently but packs a mean aftertaste, especially in the first two or three drinks, and after that the beer becomes utterly forgetable, even whilst i drink it. My mind is already on my next beer. Skip it."
"One of the few beers I've never finished. Pretty much a typical macro in appearance and smell, but the taste is much too bitter and metallic, with a harsh mouthfeel and an everlasting aftertatse that tastes like an acid-soaked penny. This is absolutely horrid stuff."
"This brew pours a pale yellow. There was a head but it left without any lace. The smell is sweet and of corn and grain. The taste is water down with a touch of alcohol at the end. So much for their Â“ Never watered down tasteÂ”. Glad I was cooking with it"
"This is a bad beer, but there are worse. Very pale yellow with only a very thin ring of head. The smell is very bad. No aromas stick out. Taste is similar. This is a light bodied beer. Drinking more than one of these is hard to do. I would stay away from this beer, unless your digging in the couch cushion for bling to buy beer."
"Had a couple of these on the golf course today. Overall, not too awfully bad for a Macro. Good swilling beer, if the need arises. Pale yellow in color, with a white head and typical fiziness. Limited aroma and taste. I know they sell alot of this stuff. Advertising is a good thing???"
"It's pale straw in color. A rather large fluffy head forms and is nice to look at for the 15-20 seconds it lasts. There's not much of an aroma, just a little grain. And the same goes for flavor, just a little graininess, and slightly noticeable alcohol. It's crisp on the palate and that's about the only plus to this beer. That and the fact that it can be a cheap buzz for someone who is broke. It's definitely not a beer for beer advocates to enjoy. Not much flavor, just a cheap buzz."
"For a lot of my friends at college, this is the perfect drink for them. A six pack of tall boys is about 5 bucks, and after that you will be feeling alright. A nice cheap drunk, if thats what youre looking for, if for some reason you were looking for a tasty beer and thought this might be it, keep on looking."
"This beer is the reason people don't take beer snobs even a quarter as seriously as they take wine snobs."
"Not too bad of a beer. Beats the hell outta Red Dog in my opinion. Had a nice slightly pale yellow color, skimpy white head, but decent flavor of hops. It had a bit of a watery / alcohol flavor that i found kind of overpowering, but compared to other beers in this price range, it's nothing to totally turn your nose up. If you have never had it, i say it's worthy of a try."
" stocked in his fridge."
"I tried a can today, its been a year since i last tatsed this..and after trying so many good micros this is very bland..but i am strapped for cash and i must says its still better than more exspensive macros...so if your after a summer beer for the BBQ Icehouse ain't too shabby if your short of cash."
"Gets a 2.0 for drinkability, and I think I am being kind."
"well instead of waxing poetic about this beer, i'll get straight to the point. it's gold with a detergent head. grainy and alcoholic smelling. tastes slightly grainy with a pronounced alcohol bite. kind of a spritzy mouthfeel, the slight fullness in mouthfeel comes from the alcohol. if you want to get comfortably numb quickly...this is the beer for you. i'd recommend mixing this with some tomato juice or bloody mary mix, olives, pickles, and some tabasco. one of my top five all time worst hangovers came after a night of drinking this beer in college. the pain of the following day still haunts me. this is not a good beer...even by ""swill"" standards."
"This beer came out of the can a gold color. There was a white head present no lace. It seemed to be well carbonated. The aroma was of weak malt and hops, alcohol was present. The taste was watery, carbonated that is about it. Look if it is hot out, the beer is ice cold and you are thirsty, think about it. Hey after you get 1 down, your taste buds will be numb enough to drink more. Don't expect much from this beer."
"Why do brewers advertise the fact that they make their beers with ice? I never understood that. Why not just have a beer on the rocks? More domestic crap with a weak aroma and flavor. Just have a beer-sicle if you like this stuff."
"Pours a clear goldent with a small white head. Smells of sweet adjunct and not much else...very very faint. The taste is very bland revealing a bunch of faint adjuncts with a carb bite and perhaps a mild black peppery hop flavor. Very thin bodied and very smooth....very drinkable if you want to ""power drink"" ;-). Maybe even a decent summer-time drink after a hard day of yard work. Not much else to talk about here. Cheers!"
"Icehouse tastes like it was brewed with all adjuncts.  Very cheap tasting.  I can not recommend this stuff."
"Friends told me this is the beer that will get you there, there being drunk. To me, it just gives me a headache. Golden color, I did not pour it out, just into my mouth. I could taste the hops, barely. I would not pour this down my mouth again even if my throat was on fire."
"Not much here, although at a barbecue on a hot summer day I would take it over a Bud, but then again i might take water or lemonade too."
"If you are not broke and/or an alcoholic why buy it?"
"O.K., so this isn't a Commodores song, but its not much of a beer either. This beer has a rather strong alcohol taste/presence that resembles cologne.  Brickhouse, Icehouse, Outhouse...whatever."
"Icehouse, a good ice beer that can be had at a good price."
"Crystal clear medium gold color with a head that vanishes in moments, faint lace.  Very little aroma, just a bit of cereal and pungent alcohol.  Taste is odd, a bit of malt and cereal, lots of alcohol, traces of hop bitterness, odd chemical aftertaste.  Reminiscent of Schlitz Malt Liquor."
"Smells a bit off. Hints of metal. Leaves a metalic and slightly soapy after-taste. Seems to have its highs and lows. Which is odd for a major macro."
"Not good. Mostly flavorless and what flavor there was is unpleasant. I won't be trying this one again."
"Notes: A half decent macro lager and for ice beer it is not half bad. Nothing to really talk about, just a clean ice beer to drink if you are into ice beers. No point really, you may as well drink malt liquor."
"When it comes to a good cheap beer you can't top Ice House. The bitter yet delightfully delicious taste is what drew me to this exceptional display of a common beer. Now i catch alot of flack for calling icehouse my beer of choice, but when it comes down to it when you buy icehouse you get your moneys worth and you get drunk what more could one ask for?"
"There is a word for liquor that contains nothing but water and alcohol and thats vodka. Drink that, not this."
"Another of Miller's Plank Road Brewery products.  As I was drinking it, I was trying to identify the flavors for description.  The problem was, this beer just has a general, vague ""beer flavor.""  No real characteristics of any particular kind.  Overall, fairly bland and weak.  It would take a more discerning palate than mine to give a more definite description."
