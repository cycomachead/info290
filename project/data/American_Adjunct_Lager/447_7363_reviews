"As a college student, it's been a popular pick-up for parties and for Marylanders for years. Something good for the regular folk. If you're looking for a bud light or Coors alternative, then Boh is the way to Goh!"

"This is a fine example of an American Adjunct Lager (AAL). Granted AAL is far from my go to style, near the bottom in fact, however measured against style, this is a VERY good beer. For those keeping an open mind and not having the expectations this is something it's not, this is certainly worth a try!"
""
""
""
"Typical bad, yet refreshing and drinkable, adjunct with a little bit of a funny taste in the nose. Nothing to see here."
"So I thought ""why the hell not?"" While at the Green Turtle in Annapolis. Ended up with a glass of fizzy yellow water that mayvor may not have contained corn byproduct at some point in time.  Needless to say, this is a boring, bland beer that apparently has niche hipstrt appeal. Go figure."
""
""
"Almost at the US defined Session Beer at 4.6%, I'd take this over the few other AALs that linger in the stores around town that include BMC(old name of course) and non BMC."

"Actually fairly decent for what it is.  theres a little hoppiness accompanying the normal macro corn flavors, but is not cloying.  I cant drink much of it before Im sick of it, but that goes for pretty much every domestic lager.  Better than most & a sixer takes me down memory lane every now & then"

"Feeling generous with the rating but it deserves it. I hate the city of Baltimore and their Criminal football team but ""oh boy what a beer."" I love me a cheap light novelty beer, and I always drink natty bo from 16 oz pounder cans. Ratings are earned through finesse rather than impress. You get what you pay for for, excellent sip to sip value. No bs here this is a smooth beer that is refreshing on a hot day or after work. Goes great with some Maryland blue crab."

"I am arn IPA drinker, so to me its kinda bland, but quite refreshing when served cold on a hot summers day."

"Overall (3.54) : The label says it was made in WI. I think it's still Pabst made though? Anyways, this lager tastes paerrrrty good! It's a good pair for food and a night on the couch watching The Office. Love the one eyed guy on the label, and I wish they made it up here. Nice stuff! Back to the couch..."
"Refreshing on a hot summer day, at a Nascar race or a tailgate."

"For some reason, I smell hot dog from this beer.."
""
""
""
""
""
"Best served in an Old Bay-rimmed glass."
"Overall if I want to drink a beer where I don't want to think or be disappointed, or horrified, this is pretty much it in a nutshell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had a lot of adjunct lagers and pilsners and for its style Natty Boh isn't terrible. There's no complexity, but that's not what Pabst is aiming for. Good for baseball."

"good old boh! so many great memories were made with this beer which may be the reason for my higher rating. I still say the best way to enjoy natty boh is poured into a plastic cup at an o's game on a mid summer night...although it will cost you $8. well worth it in my opinion!"

"I only drink this beer from a long neck bottle. The cap has puzzle on it. There r 413 different puzzles. They r fun to solve and we do not let drink the beer until u solve the puzzle. I will have a few tonight with some Maryland steamed crabs. Oh what a beer!!!"

"I like this beer. I like Baltimore. I like Camden Yards. I like to drink this beer when in Baltimore and maybe even at Camden Yards watching the Red Sox whoopin' some robin birds. Good beer, great logo. Ice cold, gimme gimme, yum yum. If not in Baltimore and I can find it wherever I live, I like to drink 'em and watch The Wire and perhaps listen to J. Roddy Walston & The Business."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Born, raised, and educated in MD this offering was available everywhere during my salad years. Yeah, its an adjunct but perfect for a hot summer day, while eating crabs. Better when ice cold (don't let it warm... it will ruin your day). Sentimentality aside, a decent adjunct lager."
""
"What else is to be said about good old natty boh. It's a baltimore delicacy hon (well not really since it's been bought out by Milwaukee brewing co) . Best served with crabs, or another natty boh. Considered a staple of the city, many people take pride in drinking this questionable beverage. Most likely brewed with corn, and leftover hops from the miller light batches, this beer is down-right bad. However, it has the best deal you can get. 30 packs for 14 bucks? oh yeahhhh."
""
""
""
"Poor scores across the board, except for the ""overall"" category which I gave a 5. My reasoning has nothing to do with beer. The Ravens have won every playoff game (including the Super Bowl) in which I drank Natty Boh; therefore, overall, the beer is outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not half bad, can't say that I don't like it. As a Maryland resident, Natty Boh is a requirement. Watching sports and eating wings at BDubs certainly aided the drinking of this beer. If I were to sit down and drink this in a blind taste test I certainly would not be impressed. Nevertheless, there are beers for different atmospheres and this is great for Redskins & Wizards games. Better than BMC for sure."

"O- There's nothing good about this beer. But I hate to kill a beer so...I'll give a nod to it's name, which is catchy. The notion that this beer evokes Maryland pride is scary."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't the best beer for most places, but at a baseball game - especially at Camden Yards - this is THE beer to drink. It's a perfect ""pale beer"" and very refreshing with little to no aftertaste and really hits the spot on a hot afternoon. This is what the other yellow water beers should try to be."

"The feel is okay; it's got the crispness and is reasonably clean in its appropriately light body, without too much slickness threatening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and definitely sessionable - better than most of the other BMC products as it does not taste of preservatives."

"Appearance, yeah it looks great in the can - no way am I pouring this into a glass! Smells very clean, a bit of hops and carbonic acid and maybe the slightest impression of malt, but it does smell a tad sugary. Starts off wanting to have a taste, then there is a bit of a hop bite in the middle before the (mostly clean) stinging carbonic finish. Doesn't sound too appetizing, but for the category it's a winner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Better than most in this category. Got the can from a friend who is from Baltimore. I guess it id there state beer. Very drinkable, but basic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is Baltimore baby! Crabs and Boh, it doesn't get much better."
""
"Overall, this is one of my favorite versions of the style, which is why I gave it a 4 in the overall category even though my ratings would suggest otherwise. Its not as good as Schlitz Gusto, but to me it is more enjoyable than most of the others in the category. Its also cheap, which is nice."
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a straw yellow with a one finger head that dissipates quickly. Smells of sweet grain that is it. Tastes of water, grain, and maybe a little corn. Beer is carbonated correctly and is very drinkable for its light body. Overall, a slightly below average beer, but not a bad adjunct lager."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you've ever been to Baltimore in the past 10 years, you've seen ""Natty Boh"" out at the bars. It is a seventies style American beer. It is made to be cheap. People only drink it in the city because of it's price and nostalgia. Everyone's parents in Baltimore ate steamed crabs and swigged down the old bay with some Natty Boh. And so the tradition continues."
"Buy some Natty Boh, it's Baltimore in a can."
"one of the better shitty beers. on par with pbr, though not much of a surprise since they're made by the same brewer."
""
""
""
""
"The beer is very clear and has is slightly straw colored. This beer looks like water more than any other I've had. The white foam head settles down quickly. Aroma is standard for the style; sweet malt and rice and not a hop to be found. Big corn flavors abound when I taste it. Light body and not too much carbonation. Surprisingly, there is little coating. What's there is sweet but not all that sticky. All in all, this is just another adjunct lager. It may have some local pride, the way Naragansett does here in New England, but outside of slumming it while drinking in DC there isn't much reason to seek this beer out."
""
"People need to like beers for what they are and not what they want. Not everybody is trying to be Russian River. Beers like this have a place, which is why it has a category. All the 'real' people I know (presumably I'm one) don't drink 4 year old RIS every weekend, they have 'fillers', beers like these, give it a rest with the 'Poor'. Most of you wouldn't dare take a blind taste test and if you did I'm guessing most would be 'magically' surprised that some beers taste better than their label and some taste worse."

"Overall, a better than average adjunct lager but not a lot to set it apart from others. Better and cheaper than BMC so that is a definite plus."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is better than PBR, and the faint biscuit notes make it a bit more interesting than your average macro. And its cheap. Despite these positives this is yet another cheap mass produced beer that fails to excite me."
""
"Not much going on with the lager. I must admit is beats a majority of your mainstream adjunct lagers. There may be a lack of taste, but nothing about this beer is unpleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: other than the mouthfeel this is a standard adjunct lager. Very drinkable but not very special."
" All that said, this is comically easy to put down in quantity, which has its virtues. I will get this on occasion, although it is not up there with PBR and Schlitz, which are the outside beers of summer in my book."
""
""
"O - Really not impressed by this brew. I thought Pabst would try to put out something a notch above what they usually do...but instead they put out their own version of Coors Light. Watery, excessively carbonated and boring. Avoid this brew unless you're trying to get sh*tfaced. 2.5"
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Light bodied. Moderate carbonation. Pretty drinkable, very crisp. Pretty much the official beer you should drink at O's games. Tastes better and cheaper than your usual macros."
""
""
"Taking into account that this is a cheap beer and knowing that, it should reviewed as such and compared to other lower mass produced beer. I didnt think that this beer had any great qualities for this self proclaimed category but when in Maryland you must drink what the locals drink, Its a pretty decent beer not the greatest but good for a good backyard party exactly how I had it so if you need a cheap beer and your perhaps from out-of-state could be a good change up from the usual"
""
""
"(Overall) it's what you'd expect from a popular local lager. At a good price, it would make a fair trip substitute for something like Budweiser or Miller, but over craft options, it's not even worth the couple of bucks. One of the lightest flavored AA lagers I have ever had, and there's little wrong with that if you're in the right mode. 3"
""
""
"O - this beer is nothing special. It is however good for what it is. It obviously sets out to be lighter and easy drinking-which it most certainly is. Plus, being from Bmore, I can't hate on natty boh!"
""
"M + D: An easy downer--moderate carbonation keeps it from stinging like a soda. A good, simple, outdoor beer that I was satisfied spending some time in the sun with."

"Well I had to go all the down to Maryland just to get my hands on some Natty Boh though it isn't brewed in Baltimore Anymore. Its a smooth pale Macro Lager and its great I recommend it . Over all its got a slight taste but thats the way i like my Beer and it a summer Beer perfect to sit down on a hot summer day and pound down about 8 or 10 or so. Great Beer indeed ."
""
""
""
""
"O: If you are from the Baltimore area you have probably swilled a Natty Boh. This is beer is a Baltimore institution / cult. People actually tattoo them selves the the Natty Boh guy. Enjoy, I think?"
""
""
"overall - I last had this beer 20 years ago in college (can). I really didn't like it then at all. I find it much easier to drink today. Owned by Papst but much better than a PBR."
"Enjoyed a ""Natty Boh"" on tap at Dogwatch Tavern. Very clear, pale yellow color with negligible head and ample carbonation. Very little in the way of aroma beyond the faint wheat smell. The beer is a decent one as far as inexpensive mass produced beers go. The flavor is clean with some wheat taste present. It is a nice change of pace compared to my normal favorites. This is a good beer to enjoy in the Baltimore area, watching a ball game."

"But you know the deal - it's a macro lager, so drink it straight from the can, as frosty cold as possible, without over analyzing it."

""

""
""
"I love the Boh, plain and simple! Natty Boh, please don't go, I'll drive to and fro, so you can go, into my stomach below! A wonderful beverage from America's past that has surpassed potential extinction and emerged unscathed to ""The Bright Side."""
""
"O: Refreshing yet gritty, it's Baltimore in a can. Nuff said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Out of a can (this retro six-pack cost me only $3.50!) this beer was a clear golden color with one finger of white head. The retention of the head was not bad and it left scattered lacing. The aroma was of pilsner malt, corn and a hint of sweet malt. The flavors were very similar but very drinkable for a macro-beer. I tasted mostly pale malt and corn with a bit of lingering sugar that helped to ‘fill it out’. The body was medium, the carbonation appropriate and the mouthfeel good. Simple but solid. Upon reflection I concluded that this bargain beer had some real substance and better than almost all of its competition, in my opinion."
"O: Baltimore Legend? Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed it – but it was only a step above on a Budweiser."
"A classic. A necessity for anyone visiting downtown Baltimore for the first time. Cannot beat Natty Boh when you are looking for a satisfying, cheap beer in Maryland. While it will not please those who strictly drink craft beers, I will take a Natty Boh over any other similar Macrolager any day of the week."
"O - For what it is, Natty Boh is one of my favorite cheap adjuncts. It's refreshing and doesn't have any off flavors to it. As long as you keep the style in mind, Natty Boh is definitely worth your time. Too bad I can't get it in VA (though MD is a short drive), but Natty Boh will be my go-to when I want a lawnmower beer."
"Every big city has one; their own cheap, plentiful, shamelessly promoted cheap beer. Baltimore has Natty Boh. As cheap beers go, this is one of the better ones out there. A nice crispness to the beer and some actual hops detected while you drink it, you can pick up 24 of these bad boys for $12-13. While it isn't special by any means, it isn't meant to be... it's a beer to drink on a hot night or to take advantage of the $1 special at the bar, and its delicious and refreshing. No frills, but above average for it's style."
"The CPJ"
"Enjoy"
"O: For the style, really not bad at all. Easy drinking and refreshing. A good substitute for the watery light lagers out there."
"O - Easily one of the better Adjuncts on the shelf, and the memories I have associated with this beer are unquantifiable. I'll always pick up a case or two when I'm visiting home."
"D- Not a very good beer. If you're in Baltimore you might be obligated to have one, outside of that it's not much better than your standard lager past the looks and mouthfeel."
"drinkability: it's a hometown favorite, cheap, drinkable, and not that discernable from other more pricey beers of the same adjunct style."
"I love Natty Boh. I drank a TON of this during my 7 years living in Baltimore. My local corner bar had it on tap for $1 a pint---always. Ice cold with a plate of steamed shrimp or a crab pick. Goes well. Its a simple adjunct lager---crisp with a touch of bitterness. Drinks easy. Oh, did I mention it's cheap? Whenever Im back in town, I always stop for a case or two to bring home. In all honesty, its no better or worse than the higher priced adjuncts like Coors or Bud. Only cheap beers I prefer would be Miller High Life or Yuengling Lager."
"O- Overall this beer was average at best with nothing that makes it better than most adjuncts in my opinion. It was a good and well made for what it was suppose to be. The lower ABV makes it easy to have many pints of this. If this were around where I lived I would have this after mowing the lawn in the hot sun easy."
"For the price of a six pack of bottles ($3.99) you can make a lot WORSE Choices."
"Drinkability - Im from Baltimore, we are apparently the only people that love this as much. We put this stuff down like there's no tomorrow. By far my favorite crap beer. A step up from your traditional light beers for similar price, except boh is not a light beer."
"D - Like I said, it goes great with crabs!"
"D: very easy to drink, good balance. Finished 12oz in 3 seconds one time, well many times!"
"D: On tap. In Baltimore. What more do I need? Oh yeah, happy hour pricing. A nice way to end the Belgian Beer day."
"taste a light in flavor"
"can't wait to try natty boh on tap this year."
"D. Easy to drink and perfect for crab feasts or long days at the beach where a bigger beer (basically any other) may do you in."
"Review #300. This Natty Boh beer is special to me as I usually have it before the Orioles baseball game where they sell tall cans cheap - ~$2 to $3. Good times. National Bohemian has a thick, white head and a very clear golden appearance. Carbonation is high. Aroma is faint, but what one would expect from an American-style adjunct lager- that beer smell. Taste is delightful, with a nice hop balance; hop character is a bit more pronounced than others in this style category. Mouth-feel is light and watery. Natty Boh finishes crisp and refreshing. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer and I usually reserve it for pre-baseball tailgating in Baltimore. Natty-Boh, baby!"
"D: I'd love to give this a worse review but it is up to adjunct lager standards and it has a lot of eastern MD nostalgia. Its my beer of choice when playing beer pong and such but I won't be buying it to sip on or pair with a meal."
"Beer is thin and grainy. Almost no sweetness. The finish is boring as well. Its a grainy, watery beer with almost no flavor...I was expecting too much from Pabst in this case."
"Pale light golden in color with a small head that quickly dissipates. The aroma is of very slight grain, a bit metallic, a tad of lager and some hop bitterness. It is very finely carbonated, giving a tickle on the tongue. The mouth-feel is creamy and light, without being watery. The taste has the same notes as the aroma (grain, slight apple/metal tartness, bit of lager and very slight hop bitterness), but I would say that the taste is better than the aroma. This is good, solid cheap beer. Is it the best cheap beer? Not at all. There are some with better aroma and flavor, but there are also many that are worse. In addition, I did really like the mouth-feel of this beer (at least for a cheap American adjunct lager)."
"Drinkability: I rated the drinkability unusually high due to the nostalgia that Natty Boh brings. This is by no means a craft beer, but still enjoyable after mowing the lawn or when watching the game. If nothing else, its a good alternative to a BMC when available."
"I'm not sure about anywhere else that you can get it, but if you have a couple bucks you can get a decent amount of this stuff in Baltimore, like a sixer for $3. you have no excuse to not at least try it here"
"D - I was drinking this since I was with a group and it was offered, but I don't think I would purchase this personally. It is bland and there are too many canned options with way more flavor out there"
"RJT"
"Overall, this is my favorite macro lager, probably cuz I grew up in Baltimore, and still live there, so its iconic of home. I prefer almost any craft offering over this, but as far as macros go, this is my go to beer."
"I'll be honest, granting you, the reader, full disclosure. I wasn't going to do an ASTMD review of this beer. However, I changed my mind because I didn't want to appear to be too biased. Do you want me to be honest though? I am biased. With this beer, I loose my objectivity and I think back to experiences around fell's point, and the west side of Baltimore. This brew has history on its side, and regardless of where you stand, I'm in Mr. Bo's corner."
"Not a good beer, but not a bad cheap beer. The ""cheap beer cost-benefit analysis"" works out comparatively well, unless you live close to the College Park Shoppers Food Warehouse, where 12-packs of Schlitz are, by some act of God, less than five dollars."
"At the end of the day, you really have to score Natty-Boh on a scale of: smell, taste, drinkability and nostalgia. It's a part of our history, and when given the choice between this and Miller Lite, I'll spend the evening with Mr. Boh anytime! Wink wink..."
"Natty Boh is drinkable for what it is. It doesn't become atrocious when it warms, it doesn't seem to have that awful metallic macro taste (even when drinking from the can), and it's cheap as hell. Not worth searching out, but if you're visiting Maryland you ought to try it at least once."
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts. Taste is rather bland, some sweetness. Feels light in the mouth. Drinkability is fairly good. Overall not much going for this beer other than the cheap price."
"Wine Specialist/$8/12-pack"
"Bonus points for the cool logo and ""local"" feel."
"$5.99 for a 12 pack"
"D: I was not impressed with this at all; it took quite a while just to guzzle down the first bottle. Then again, I'm not a big fan of any Pabst products."
"2 for $5 outside Camden Yards. Thanks to Pickles for the special, thanks Mark for the tickets/company and thanks to the city of Baltimore for your apparent lack of an open container law. This lightly golden lager had a clean smell, a bit of grainy/grassiness but otherwise unremarkable. Taste was lightly (again) sweet with a generic cereal grain flavor, mixed with a little sulphur (yeast?). Mouthfeel is light, with a clean finish. Good drinkability due to venue, company and 80 degree temp. Good times."
"2.0 D: Not the worst choice for a frat party, but far from the best."
"The mouthfeel is not great as well, almost no carbonation with no head. The only thing is that you can drink this all day, although you mouth won't taste very good the next morning."
"I will stick to drinking it for old times once a year."
"Not the best brew out there but nothing to really complain about. Would make a great dinner beer. Natty Boh is a given with a table full of hot steamed crabs."
"D: Nothing offensive about it at all, although the flavor is somewhat weak and watery. The taste is actually well above average, but it's just a little too muted. Still, better and more drinkable than most comparable bargain-basement macros."
"Throwback beer."
"For what Natty Boh intends to be, you can't beat it. The price is great, about $9 for a case of cans, and the taste is not at all foul. Although I do prefer and recommend the slighlty more expensive bottles, the cans fit the bill just fine."
"Bottoms up..."
"This was the last of a six pack and I thought that it might be a good idea to get a review on file. It poured with a finger's worth of bone white head with lousy retention - it was disappearing as quickly as I could pour! The color was a crystal clear pale/straw yellow. The nose was on the sweet side, very lager-like, but with an underlying sugary smell at the same time. The mouthfeel was thin and watery and there was a faint sweetness on the tongue, but that was about it. The finish was unobtrusive, at best. This is truly a lawnmower beer. It would be nice and refreshing cold out of the cooler on a hot day, but beyond that, it was pretty nondescript."
"So... this crappy beer (let's not kid ourselves) sort of reminds me a bit of strohs, but with a somewhat cleaner flavor profile. Of course it's a terrible beer, but in the world of lousy macros, I have to say I've had much worse (pretty much everything made by BMC). This beer would make good snail bait, or for that matter probably wouldn't be bad in beer chile or beer bread. This is a lousy beer, but in all fairness is not nearly as lousy as I was expecting. In a blind taste test, I'm not sure but I wouldn't rate it higher then Yuengling lager. I know that's not saying a whole lot, but this truly isn't nearly as wretched a beer as I was expecting (though the longer it sits in the glass, the more tiring/boring it is to drink). Ho hum... I've had worse."
"D - For the style its an average beer not great but not bad this could be a session beer on a summer day while bbqing"
"This was probably one of the most disappointing beers I have ever drank. Trying to be unbiased, but the most noticeable taste was the aluminum in the can. Smell was sort of funky, has an ok middle taste but an aftertaste which is slightly light less enjouable follows. Felt a bit watery. Ok for one drink or 2, but not one I'd go out out of my way to get or drink."
"First choice of beer to drink with Maryland Blue Crabs. Its not the greatest beer in the world but it goes down easy and is pretty good. Give it a try!"
"Overall, a fantastic macro lager. Too bad I can't get it here in MI."
"Now, this isnt to say, those of you that enjoy the hearty beer and like to sip and enjoy A beer versus a few or more in a sitting should switch brands or anything. Natty Boh doesn't try too hard to impress, it just does. For those of you that drink a lot of macrobeers like Coors and Budweiser, deff gives this one a shot. I think you will be 'pleasant'ly surprised."
"Overall: This is a classic college-esque beer. Don't expect much more out of it."
"The mouth is blessed with crackling carbonation that adds to the enjoyment of this simple beer. You could do much worse than this old time favorite. Very easy to pair with crabs and oysters."
"I grew up in Maryland, so I know this beer well, despite the fact that I moved out of the state before I really had a chance to give it a shot. I had my friend pick up a twelve pack on his recent visit. Natty Boh pours a crystal clear light golden yellow with a foamy, short lived head. The aroma is sharp and grainy, not too much else. Taste is a sweet grainy malt flavor, no hops really to speak of. Fuller body and more flavor than I would expect from a 4.2% macro lager. This one is definitely a good party beer when you're on a very low budget, and I would drink it every now and then if it was around my area. Next time I'm eating crabs in Maryland, I'll be sure to pick up a six pack to help them go down."
"Now stand back a minute pardner! Why such high marks on mouthfeel and drinkability? Well, it's the funnest water I ever swallowed with a slight buzz to boot! At the end of a long night of British and Belgian ale drinking, I thought I was down for the count. But I was still thirsty and not ready for my pre-bedtime glass of water. Mr. Boh to the rescue! It was nothing short of miraculous. I got a whole can of it down, quenched my thirst for one more beer, and didn't add to the risk factor of my heavy evening. Score!"
"Cheers!"
"As a side note, after the old National Brewery closed, a small corner of it eventually went on to house Brimstone Brewing, operated by Marc Tewey."
"Reminds me of my first homebrewed pilsner. I didn't drink much of that either. This beer is a bit muddy, but intriguing nevertheless. A dirty, bruised apple and peach, yeasty, confectionate sugar sweetness eminates in the aroma and flavor. Has a typical lager look with good head formation and retention. Body actually stood up a bit better than expected. an extra corn-sugar sweetness persists and leaves the body a bit heavier. Problematic is a heavy presence of buttererd popcorn, celery, and cooked vegetable flavors that was difficult to look past. As you could imagine, the finish had a thick lingering and left the mouth very slick and oily."
"Figured I should review this since its logo is my avatar so here is my 500th review. Rather pale golden color with a fair amount of carbonation. Very low aroma-nothing there really. Its not bad or anything just isnt there. Mild malt flavor with a trace of bitterness. Somewhat sweet in the finish. Average body for the usual macros out there. Fairly average overall. I love a good macro but think I would pass on this one. From what people tell me this and National Premium were quite the beers in their day."
"D: Let's just say this. If this was available in my area, and I was in high school again... this would be my beer of choice. I'd much rather be drinking this as apposed to Mickey's or Beast. In fact, I could see myself drinking this now on occasion. Not bad."
"I have to agree with palffyfan from Boston...'Tiz a malty beverage, and that's what I notice more than anything. Not a BAD thing, however, as it's a very drinkable brew...and smooth. Plus, I get sick of hearing about HOPS! They're decent...but what the hell??! That's not what beer is all about. Malt is another aspect, and Nat. Boh. seems to deliver in that category. Nice switch from the ""hop craze"" and I really don't mind this classic brew at all. Again, very SMOOTH and easy to drink. Decent flavor, light on the palette...or tongue, if you will....And pretty cool-looking old-fashioned design! (I DO think that's the Pringles dude! He must be moonlighting!) I recommend this, and at $11.79 for 24 of these...how could you beat it?! Although I've yet to try 'em with crabs as everyone recommends....It's pretty damn good just drinkin' by it's lonesome whilst sittin' here on the pc! Give 'em a try....especially if you like a more MALTY brew, with less of a hop character. You WON'T be disappointed, and your wallet won't hurt EITHER! Bottoms up my friends!"
"I know there is a strong regional following for this beer, but, without the ballgame association, this stuff is pretty bland, approaching flavorless. Has the same fizzy, slightly sour thinness that one finds in light beers. Not much malt, no hops that I could find - about the only thing I can say about the beer is that it lacks the flavor to offend."
"Drinkability - Beers maltiness would wear on me. Not much of a character to this beer so I would avoid this in the future."
"A real thirstquencer that I always keep in stock. Sometimes it's hard to find bottles though because popularity among the masses has skyrocketed around here."
"This review is dedicated to the people of Maryland who according to legend live off of this shit. And to our regional hero, national treasure and friend: Mary Prankster, 1995-2005."
"Can provided amid a bunch of stuff given to me for volunteering at 2005 GABF. Uhm, thanks guys, I really appreciate the opportunity. The stamp on the can bottom reads 11285 C50668. Pours a fizzy white three finger head over a crystal clear light straw colored liquid. The head started out like a soda, but it's turned sticky and has left decent lacing on the inside of the glass. Smells very mild. Mostly I get a dark noble hop, something like spalt hops. There is a non-descript sweet way beneath and that's about it for the aromas. Tastes are out of balance. The primary flavor is a dark edgy hop. Greasy and dirty. Perhaps Tettnanger hops. The hop character is bolstered by an acrid from carbonation. Sweet is much too far below to contribute helpfully. Light body and heavily carbonated. I would describe this as the ""IPA"" of american macro lagers. Tough to put down."
"Watered down piss color with a rocky white head. Metallic corn aroma. Corn taste, watery, glad this was freezing cold. Not exactly what I'd call a goo dbeer. Had it for the first time just last night, and I think it is quite safe to say that it will be the last time I ever have it again."
"D - Ah Boh! Goes does easily. One of my favorite cheap beers. Nothing washes down a bushel of crabs like Boh."
"I heard someone talking about Natty Bo, and I wasn't sure what it was until my roommate brought some of this stuff back from Annapolis - apparently it's a big Maryland beer. The can is awesome - ""From the Land of Pleasant Living"" with a one-eyed face that resembles the Pringles guy. Served chilled in a pilsner glass, it pours a very light gold with few streams of carbonation and a 2 finger white head that leaves little lacing. Smells very clean with grains, a touch of fruits, hops (floral?), and a hint of metal. Taste delivers about the same with a medium/light tingly body. Overall, way better than other macro beers and just as drinkable, if not more so, for the same price."
"This is your perfect beer to enjoy whilst tailgating and/or eating bushels of crabs. Ive seen a lot of negative reviews. However, most appear to come from the rancid can version and not from the fine, fresh bottled versions around. For the price ($3-4 a sixer retail and as low as $1.25 at some local bars) you cant really beat it. This is my go to brew when stuck somewhere with nothing but macros or questionable taps, which happen to be too many of the bars in the area. Ill try to throw this one in with the next few BIFs to get some non-regional love. Boh's day is coming. If people will give mad props to PBR, they will surely fall under Mr. Boh's mystique."
"Natty Boh is a great beer for a hot summer afternoon by the pool with good friends and a couple dozen steamed crabs. Its light flavor doesn't interfere with the taste of the foods and its low alcohol content makes it a good ""spacer' beer. At $8.99 a case it has its niche"
"On draft served cold, in 7oz old man glasses (and an attentive bartender to keep thiem coming), I could see this being a good experience. In cans, eh."
"Brewed at the Lion in Wilkes-Barre, PA. A retro classic! It pours a clear golden body beneath a creamy white head that fades quickly to an average collar and leaves only minimal spotty lacing about the glass. The nose displays sweetish malt and not much more; perhaps a subtle touch of yeasty sulphur. There are no noticeable hops. It's medium bodied, smooth, and crisp in the mouth. The flavor offers a lightly sweet and gently crisp maltiness with just a touch of yeasty fruitiness. It finishes short and drying with a touch of residual sweetness. An enjoyable and refreshing, basic American-style lager."
"Natty Boh is a Baltimore institution and the king of the super-cheap macros. Although quality has suffered since Pabst bought the brewery, and you can no longer get the Boh in kegs, this beer is still a hero to students and Baltimore's working class. If you ever see this at a liquor store and you're looking for a dirt cheap  $3.99/12-pack near me  alternative to High Life, Busch, etc., buy a case of this and toast the land of pleasant living."
"This is a cheap beer where you get what you pay for, nothing more; nothing less. There was nothing foul here and I wouldn't mind having this as a lawnmower beer. Sort of tastes like a ""better"" light beer (there's an oxymoron)."
"There's not much you can say about these ""lawnmower beers"". They go down great on a hot day, but leave much to be desired in the flavor category. This is typical of the name brand american lagers with a high percentage of adjuncts. For the money, though, on a cost per can basis, a much better value than the big labels."
