I am sure this would be like finding an oasis in the desert if you could drink one (or more) of these on a hot day in equatorial Africa, where it is brewed.  This is a good lager and not everyone is fond of, or really appreciates a lager these days...with good reason.  Regardless, this is a refreshing beer and worth a try if you are at a restaurant or at a beer store.","BeerDocT","Mar 22, 2015"

It poured a pale golden color with a big white head and it had a body that surprised me, I was expecting water and got something light to medium with a moderate carbonation level. Taste was BORING! That blandness really carried through to the palate. Grainy, biscuit from the malt, subtle earthy hop, but mostly a whole lotta nothin. It's just not a good beer, if this is the style I'm going for I might as well be handed a Bud Light.","BrewChatKen","Oct 28, 2014"

Pouring produced about 1.5"" of pure white head that lasted for several minutes, leaving a considerable amount of lacing all down the far side of the glass. Its aroma is quite simple, bready light malts and not much of anything else. The beer's flavour begins with a fleeting light malt sweetness and finishes with a very, very subtle hop bitterness and no aftertaste. Despite the quantity of visible bubbles I found the carbonation to be quite light, and I would describe the mouthfeel as light and watery. I guess this makes sense...if I was living in an African climate I probably wouldn't be looking for a hefty porter or stout. The good news...my first African beer was drinkable. The not so good...I found Tusker to be too light in aroma, flavour and body for my particular taste. Though it wasn't a bad beer, I doubt that I'll be buying this one again. Tusker was selling for $3.35 per 500 ml bottle at the time or writing.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 13, 2014"

At least when I meet St. Peter I’ll be able to say “Take me or leave me, I drank an African brew. Bitch.” So….. anyway. Out of a bottle this beer from the Dark Continent was a clear, pale, yellow color. The one finger of white head fizzed out rather quickly and only a few streaks of sticky lacing remained to show for it. The aroma was slightly sweet, with an unexpected note of berries as well as sweet malt, some rice and a hint of floral hops. The flavors were drier than the aroma suggested but still pleasant enough and appropriate for the style. I tasted biscuity malt, the sweet, berry-like malt and the floral hops at the end. All of these notes were subtle and in general I would describe the beer as understated and yet it was altogether pleasant and in no way offensive, unlike many adjunct Lagers. The mouthfeel was average, the body medium and the carbonation soft. An easy to drink beer that would no doubt be very refreshing on a hot day, as I’m sure it was intended. Furthermore, I think it’s worth noting this was one of the best adjunct Lagers I’ve ever tasted. A gem and an oddity; like that girl I dated in VT with truly tremendous “assets” this specimen proved to be the best kind of novelty.","thekevlarkid","Jan 28, 2012"

Hailing from the southern portion of the Horn, Tusker looks Droopy-esque, all sad and unappealing with its run-of-the-mill sallow color and foamy white head. Frankly, if I saw an elephant looking like this, I'd be afeared of cathcing some new-fangled Elephant Flu. The high compliments don't end there, as the smell, though intriguing, is generally off-puttingly sour. Now, I'm not tslking gueuze or Flanders red here, but just a subtle, faint funk. The rest of the smell is very ho-hum: rice, corn, wheat, oh my...how boring and AAL of it. Which reminds me: why do so many non-American countries seemingly exclusively brew up AALs? I guess it's efficient and cheap and whatnot, but still... What would be nice would be a new and different take on the AAL, but no, it's all the same old song here, just with a different label from where it's from (the Temps didn't like that version of the song): corn syrup, rice cake, and vague wheat somber the proceedings the way the Big 3 have for decades. A slight tin flavor makes things extra disappointing. Apparently in keeping with tradition, the light body, moderate carbonation, and watery feel are all maintained in accordance with the BMC Neutrality Laws. At least you can just pound it down, right? All the better to get to your next brew.","TMoney2591","Mar 28, 2010"

Not a good beer, but it at least drinkable. Mouthfeel is rather thin. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is neutral. Best Kenyan beer (1) I've tasted.","beerguy101","Sep 28, 2003"

2.82,-6.6,4,2,3,3,3,"Clear, light yellow hue, little animation, thick/chunky white head with good retention, soapy residue produces a reasonable amount of lace. The nose was completely uninviting (damn near foul) adjunct plagued, very sweet, husky and grainy thankfully it lacks potency. The palate is similar to the bouquet (sweet, grainy, husky), a dry finish and crisp carbonation helps cut through the sweetness/grain. Any influence of hops is minimal, trace element of hay and grass. As for the malt, its absent. Slightly tacky finish, the aftertaste is lightly sweet. Medium body, thin but not watery. This is not a bad beer by any means, just dont be fooled by the exotic location, it is a standard pale lager youve had it before.","bditty187","Aug 18, 2003"
2.59,-14.2,3.5,2,2,4,3.5,"As for overall drinkability, well, it's refreshing, light, and crisp. But I can barely tell it's beer. If it is served really cold, it seems to go well with spicy food on a hot, hot day. When it warms beyond ""cold", it becomes insipid.","Garin","Jun 16, 2003"
3.3,9.3,4,4,3,2,3.5,"Perfectly translucent golden body with a thick white head. The head fades quickly, but the effervescense of the beer never quits until the glass is empty. The smell was very tempting with a pleasant hop presence. Unfortunately, the look and smell of this beer were the best part. It's bland to the tongue, blah to the mouth. Calling it Kenya's version of Budweiser is too mean, but I could probably reproduce the flavor of this beer by mixing Singha, Budweiser, and water. Still, it quenches the thirst and goes great with the muggy weather here on a Georgia summer night.","jlervine","Jun 14, 2003"
2.56,-15.2,3,2,3,2,2.5,"This beer pours a yellow color with a moderate head and minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma is not very pleasing, but not too bad.

2.68,-11.3,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Took a stab at this one as it was something new at my local pub. I wish I had started with this one, its subtle yet refreshing. Very active carbonation that started with an F4 classification, and gradually moved its way down. Light in color, mouthfeel, and character. Somewhat pungent nose and aftertaste that is bothering me a little bit, but overall, this exceeds my expecations as my first 'african beer'.","TripelJ","Jun 07, 2003"
4.45,47.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"500 ml bottle. Pours a clear pale yellow, with a white head that receded quickly, but leaves a little bit of lace on the glass. Aroma of lemon is evident. Highly carbonated, with a clean finish. Definetly a thirst quenching brew. I could sit and drink this all night! A real session beer.","Indybeer","May 31, 2003"
2.52,-16.6,2,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,"330ml can, claims to have won over 15 monde selection gold medals around the rim. Pours out a light clear straw colour, no real head and no head retention to speak of. Smell is sweet and bread-like, malt content has obviously been given the throne over hops in this lager. It shows in the flavour. Sweet, a little lemony, a tad yeasty, this is hot, hot weather beer. A little crisp with no discernable aftertaste. All in all though it is not very impressive.","IronDjinn","May 24, 2003"

Light and clear gold color with a medium thin white head. No lacing and mild effervescence. Weak grass and hops aroma with a hint of skunk.

Very refreshing, a good ""summer"" brew, probably because Kenya is in perpetual summer. A little on the exspensive side at $2.79 for 500 ml, but the price was worth it to taste what they are drinking in Africa.","bewareOFpenguin","Mar 27, 2003"

3.23,7,3.5,3,3,3,4,"It pours a clear straw-gold body topped by a full and creamy bright-white head that holds fairly well before dropping, and leaves some nice lace. The bouquet expresses a grainy malt sweetness with some mild grassy and floral hoppiness in the background. The body is thin but exceptionally smooth across the palate with a fine carbonation. The palate is limited to a gently sweet maltiness that's obviously thinned by a liberal use of adjunct; and balanced by an understated bitterness. Some minor floral hop flavor is present if you seek it out, but doesn't present itself otherwise. It finishes short and sweet, just vanishing from the palate in much the same way it came in. It's a teasing beer that continually leaves you looking for more, which adds to it's drinkability but not much else. It's refreshing and light - easy to drink, but lacking in character.","NeroFiddled","Jan 27, 2003"

2.98,-1.3,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"A fluffy white head to rival the snows of Kiliminjaro. A pallid gold. A soft wind whispers aromas of distant hayfields and spun sugar. A malt and hop symmetry at once right and good but quickly lost to a sickly corn aftertaste that lingers badly. A wholly average lager, but likely top notch when on safari in the green hills of Africa.","inebrius","Oct 18, 2002"
2.44,-19.2,4,2.5,2,3,2.5,"Clear straw hue w/ swirling flakes of yeast, topped by a thick, well retained bumpy white head that leaves good lace. Corn sweetness, light grain huskiness, mild sulfur in aroma w/ a trace grassy hop nose.  Pasty creamed corn sweetness hits the palate upfront, then is followed by light, clean bready malt.  Devoid of malt character overall.  Subdued lemony hop flavor.  Typically thinly bodied and watery in mouthfeel from the copious use of adjuncts and consequent lack of protein.  Finishes clean and lightly sweet due to the paltry hopping.  Tusker isn't flawed, but the large use of adjuncts leave a void in flavor that make it most forgettable.  Not unlike macroswill, Tusker's bland enough to leave my palate craving flavor.","marc77","Sep 25, 2002"
2.65,-12.3,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a yellowish pale straw color, with a slightly chunky, small white head. On the nose there is a slight oily herbal hop aroma.

Very white, thick creamy head.  Very little aroma, if any it’s slightly skunky.  The first taste was quite a nice surprise, no euro-lager taste at all, rather it has a very nice bread malt flavor, with a crisp hop bite and a clean aftertaste.  Very light bodied, and very easy to drink.  Wow, I wish I had found this nice lager while the heat was on, particularly at $2 bucks a bottle.","jackndan","Sep 03, 2002"
3.31,9.6,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Notes: A no frills lager and a damn good import for such a pale middle of the road lager. For less than $2 a bottle is was worth a try, this one certainly does a good job of cutting the humidity of the summer and quenching my thirst.","Jason","Jul 18, 2002"
2.98,-1.3,3,2.5,3,3,3.5,"I did note with some curiosity that the bottle had a ""best before"" notch date which was 9 months later than my purchase.  I doubt this beer made it from Kenya to Kentucky in a big hurry, which makes me wonder if the brewer promotes a one-year shelf-life.  I've always assumed a six-month shelf life was pretty standard for non-bottle conditioned beer, and I can't imagine a one-year shelf life for a light lager like this one.","Brent","Jun 26, 2002"
