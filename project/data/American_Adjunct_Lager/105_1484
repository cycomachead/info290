It actually has some flavor (tasted similar to PBR to me but not nearly as good, kind of a creamed corn taste. Tastes cheap to be sure, but it could be worse) but it could go down much smoother. It's also extremely cheap. This is the perfect beer for kids in college who just want to get drunk.","SenorElRaz","Mar 19, 2015"

Would not buy again, not even for $2 a 12 pack. Yeah it's a terrible beer - tastes like miller lite's reject batch from experiments gone wrong.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Dec 02, 2014"

It tastes like a mixture of miller light and malt liquor, and as an ice brew thats practically what it is. There is a strong grain and corn taste to it, but its not offensive. Don't let it get warm though or you will get some bad tastes. Carbonation is a bit high for my taste, but not absurd. For what it is it's pretty good and I find myself actually enjoying them.","JayTime","Mar 28, 2014"

The flavor is too heavy on the corn. At $1.49 for a 24oz can it's what you'd expect... shitty quality, but it IS pretty drinkable. Probably wouldn't bother with this one again... though I will say that the price is hard to beat for the ABV.

If you're at a party and this is all they have, by all means go for it, but don't drink this if you like good beer.","Beastdog75","Oct 28, 2002"
1.68,-15.6,2,1.5,1.5,2,2,"already half in the bag, i started funneling these things. rank skunky odor and a rough flavor made it hard to drink any other way. this is just not right. i could make out the piss flavor while my taste buds were really sleeping if you know what i mean","ElGuapo","Oct 25, 2002"
1,-49.7,1,1,1,1,1,"Milwaukee's Best Ice, if that ice was cut from an outhouse. It is best real cold, left outside all night on November night. I perfer it with little chunks of ice swimming in it. Real bad beer, but a good way to get loaded.","bewareOFpenguin","Oct 08, 2002"
2.21,11.1,3,2,2,2.5,2.5,"It stinks like corn and rubbing alcohol, and tastes very thin and highly alcoholic. Anyway, we got it for beer pong, and should do the job in getting people all druuunked up, despite the nastiness. I'll probably sneak away from it every now and then for Harpoon IPA.","IrishRedRock","Aug 30, 2002"
3.77,89.4,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Surprisingly good for ""beast"". Light straw in color with fast rising bubbles and rich head. Almost no lace.  Slightly malt sweet flavor with metallic corn and cooked veggie flavor. Surprisingly, this works pretty well. Not a bad beer when drinking just to wet your whistle.","psugrad98","Aug 11, 2002"
1.22,-38.7,3,1,1,2,1,"Starts with plastic, then goes to a light corn with a hint of malt. Colour is a fair amber, looks are so misleading here. Some unpleasant sticky palatability, with a fair amount of carbonation. If you need this beer for effect, then go for it. HAZMAT (hazardous material) teams can be seen unloading this stuff from the beer trucks from time to time, Im sure. Once you get past the first few cans, every thing settles down except for the plastic taste, that never goes away completely.","BeerBob","Jun 29, 2002"
1.91,-4,2.5,1.5,2,2,2,"darker than your average lager, with a slight head.  smells like crap and the taste isn't much better.  it IS better than regular Beast, but what does that matter?   nice alcohol punch, some smoothness and a tiny bit of hop bite in the end.  a beer purely to get drunk fast.  not recommended.","budgood1","Jun 08, 2002"
2.3,15.6,2,2,2.5,2,2.5,"I cannot believe I drank Beast Ice. And, more than once. Was it good? No. Was it bad? No. This beer doesn't have that ""Miller"" taste like the rest of their products. Its a little darker (slightly) than I expected. There is some actual taste to this beer that for some reason I enjoyed it. Uneventful to say the least, but the gold standard of The Beast Lineup. Best consumed at hunting camps, with guys named Doug.","proc","May 10, 2002"
