2.87,-19.2,2.75,2.5,3,3,3,"Not overly offensive this pours, smells and tastes like the common adjunct lager. It has a decent amount barley graininess with some rice like malts. The tinny after taste is tempered and the bubblegum-like sweetness, that I find common in the style, is present but soft.","KYGunner","Jan 31, 2015"
3.16,-11,3.5,3,3.25,3.25,3,"ahead of its peers, but this is a style thats hard to pay much attention too. its cool they brought back an original recipe, and i agree with others that its far less offensive than some other domestic macros, but again, not something i ever really care to drink again. a little more grainy in malt composition than others, less adjuncty ans metallic and sweet than many others, so i like it on those grounds, but it is a little oxidized in the bottle, stale almost, and the hops are almost entirely absent. refreshing enough though with a light body and fine carbonation. i would choose this one over a lot of others in its category, but if i never see one of these again, im not going to be broken up about it. a nod to history, always cool, but the beer remains woefully pedestrian.","StonedTrippin","Jan 30, 2015"

I drink a lot of craft beer, but sometimes I just want a classic lager. Something that my grandfather would have drank. This reminds me of the first sip of beer I ever had. It is head and shoulders above Bud, Miller, and the rest of the competition. This and Yeungling are right at the top for the style.","PureMichiganChip","Jan 04, 2015"

3.69,3.9,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,"My favorite AAL, it beats Bud/Miller/Coors hands down. Light but tasty malt flavor, and unlike its competitors it has a noticeable hop presence. It makes you wonder why they ever changed he recipe in the first place. At a current local price of around 9 bucks/12 pack, it's the best option for someone on a budget. (Note: $9 is probably more than people pay for Schlitz in other areas. Hi-Life and PBR cost the same. For some reason, cheap beer is more expensive in New Orleans while craft beer is priced pretty reasonably.)","GerryPendry","Dec 13, 2014"

Smooth and easy to drink. No watered down character at all. Tastes like older style Milwaukee beers used to. The perfect lawnmower beer, session lager, or summer thirst quencher. Paid $5.99 for a six pack in bottles in Vonore, Tennessee. Beats Budweiser, Coors, and Miller for only a slight premium in price. Worth trying at least once. A pleasant surprise for macro lager.

Beer has a light look, feel, pours with a two finger head into a Schlitz goblet.The sip is clean, good balance like a Macanudo cigar. Nothing at all unpleasant and most certainly a go to beer for all occasions. This isn't a craft but its easily still one of the most balanced drinkable adjuncts I've ever had.

When tasting the corn is there but it isn't so prominent. Hop flavor is mild but present. Even a mild hop presence is much more than your average American macro lager. This beer would benefit from more bitterness. I think too much corn is used in the mash bill also but it isn't terrible.","Theheroguy","Nov 08, 2013"

Just make sure you get the new reformulated stuff and not the bargain basement stuff usually found in the 12 oz cans at the Quickie Marts. Better than Bud, better than Coors and better than Miller.

Not sure I could say the same if they hadn't re-introduced the classic formula before I hit 21, but oh well, lucky me! However, if you like more malt and less bitter hops, I'd go with something else. The only downside about this beer is that I can't get it where I currently live. I'll have to pick up a couple 12 packs each time I'm home from college.

Fine speckled lacing layers arounds the sides of my glass. Aroma has abright cereal grain sweetness, seems a bit mineral in the middle but overall a nice sweetness meant to be drank by the masses especially during the industrial revolution. This neck label states that this is the classic 1960s formula. Drinks so nicely semie sweet cereal notes goes down smooth it's actually chuggable and likeable and sessionable. Amazing that an old retro beer can come back and actually be drinkable for someone like me who has tried almost 2500 different beers.

Not bitter. But did have a sweet taste. Not real heavy on sweetness. Just slightly sweet. Probably from the malt. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation I thought was good. Ill buy again.

Smell is that of cereal grain, heavier on roasted corn and malt. Taste brings back memories of a younger time in my life. Rough of the edges, flavors of cooked wheat, roasted corn, and a slight sweetness from the malt. Mouthfeel is light but creamy, with a wonderful tingling and a little dryness on the edges. I really like the taste that remains in the back recesses of my upper soft palate. Although this beer is not refined, I like the taste and the pleasure it brings.

The taste brings in more of the same, though that sweetness has deserted me, and a light brush of metallic ore comes in at some point (thankfully not for very long and not very strongly). This taste is pretty bland, but in a positive way, if that makes any sense. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp-ish finish. Overall, probably the best AAL I have ever had. I wouldn't necessarily pick this out to drink as a regular thing, but if I ever am looking for a cheap pack of beer for an outing or something, this will be opted-for over the likes of BMC, PBR, and Old Style.

It's much more bitter and noticeably lacking in sweetness. However, it's lacking in just about any other flavour too.

Maybe extended with rice, but corn was not an additive here. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a lightly grassy hop bitterness on the tongue. This is undoubtedly what they meant by "Just a kiss of the hops". I prefer a French kiss, lingeringly so, but so be it in this case. Finish was pleasant, unobtrusive and definitely nostalgic.

Not much hop presence, the taste is overall a little more grainy sweetness than any type of bitterness. A very easy drinker, like any adjunct lager should be.

There is definitely a kiss of grass/floral hops that come out at the very tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is rather sweet for the style and doesn't finish with any of the dryness that's associated with the American Adjunct Lagers.

The taste is mild and not objectionable. The body is thin. There is little in the way of hop flavour or odor - but that is typical of the style.

3.93,10.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"The 1960's formula pours a brilliantly clear straw color with a quickly diminishing white head. The aroma is medium-low graininess, a bit of corn and a hint of spicy hop. The flavor is moderately sweet, a little musty malt, a bit of corn and low hop bitterness. The carbonation is medium-high but beer is still rather smooth. The beer finishes clean with just a bit of lingering malty sweetness. Overall a well done example of the style. Easy drinking but with more flavor than most examples. At $4.99 a six pack, worth picking up, maybe even go for the 12 pack.","uwmgdman","Sep 04, 2008"

3.4,-4.2,3,3,3.5,3,4,"Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. Aroma of pale malt, floral hops and just a hint of yeast. Flavor is pilsner malt, light fruit and light hops. Light bodied, somewhat sticky texture. Long sweet finish. Really quite a few steps above any other mass produced pale lager available. This might become a staple in my fridge.","kmeves","Aug 13, 2008"
4.22,18.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"They pretty much hit the mark with bringing back this recipe. It's been a while since I had a reformulated version, but this version seems far less bitter from what I recall. I would probably have to drink the two recipes side by side to really break the differences down. But I like this new/old recipe.","Rennpferd","Beers"
3.85,8.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I honestly don't think a macro lager can get any better than this. True, it's no Two Hearted or Arrogant Bastard, but for what its going for its fantastic.","Pauly2X","0"
