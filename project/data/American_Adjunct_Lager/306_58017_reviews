"Very good. Commercial owned, but better taste and value over Third Shift."

"Well - had to try this, it was all the pub had that I hadn’t already tried. Pours a clear golden amber with a fluffy and fine-bubbled wheat head. Have to give the big brews credit, they know how to make their pseudo-craft brews look. Strongly fruity and rather sweet aroma has a malty undertone. Flavor, though, is quite good - malty, fruity and hoppy, rather toothsome. Body is about average, though there is decent fizz. Coors, you’re not fooling anybody - but your Batch 19 is at least superior to your other stuff. Gotta give the devil his due. ;)"

"2/28 Bottle - Decent malt smell, OK but not a very strong taste or feel, and very light to drink.  I prefer stronger beers and tastes, but this was a decent beer for what it is."

"I was surprised to see it was a product of Coors. Good balance of hops and malt sugars to keep it mild and not too sweet nor bitter. Almost a wheaty soapy colored head that dyed quickly , I wasn't overall fond of. After smelling a slight nutty aroma from the brew, I enjoyed the beer with some slow cooked pulled pork and it coincided with the dinner just fine. Enjoyed it more than I thought I would."
""
"All in all not a bad beer. Definitely above average in its category. Look is a bit darker than others, smell is average, and taster a bit above. Liken it to a Yuengling, which is a good thing."

"I really wanted to dislike this beer but it is surprisingly good. It pours brilliant gold with a pure white 1” foam cap with masses of tiny bubbles that produce excellent lace. Has a clean, light malt, spicy herbal nose with a hint of earthiness and a light touch of grainy spice. The initial palate suggests light fruit – hints of apple but this soon hides behind rich grain and light malt with a crisp bitter emphasis on the finish with a faint lingering hint of anise from the hops. Medium light body and above average carbonation – seltzery but surprisingly drinkable."
"Pleasantly surprised by this beer it was really quite good! Not too bitter no bad after taste! Smooth and flavorful."

"Overall (3.03) : Not a bad lager. Again it's much like an amber and if you like Fat Tire, you'll love this beer as in my opinion, it is slightly better. Coors did a good job with this one, and I'm not quite sure what ""pre-Prohibition"" is completely about, but it's a decent beer nonetheless. Flavor is there, and in spades. Its just not my favorite style of flavor. This is a perfect example of me not liking a beer but respecting it for what it is about and the flavors it presents. This ain't your typical AAL. This is more along the lines of a copper lager or a harsh amber red."

"The beer is hazy and light brown with a half inch of light khaki head. The aroma is adjunct sweetness, sweet caramel malt. Smells macro all the way. The taste is just shitty. There's really no other way to say it. I try to rate to style, and I don't expect an adjunct lager to have the complexity of a gueze or big imperial stout. That said, this beer tastes like syrup, artificial sweeteners, fake fruity crap. There is no integrity in this product. This beer was designed for commercial purposes only. Gross on so many levels. Avoid."

""
"Coors did a real nice job with this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- There is some nice soft hops flavor but it is to dry and astringent to really enjoy and no malt character shows up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Overall a very well deserved 3.75 for Batch 19. I would've gave it a solid 4, but the lack of scent did away with that. This is up there with Dortmunder Gold, as far as I'm concerned. I will definitely buy this brew again!"
""

"Pours a medium amber with not much a 2-finger white head that settles down to a thin layer on top. Lots of lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of different sweet hops and malts. Taste of like a corn sweetness followed up by gentle hops. Overall very enjoyable. If this is what some beer tasted like before Prohibition in 1919, then fire up the ol' DeLorean and lets take a trip 'Back to the Future"" to taste some more early-type brews. Great job Coors!"

"This beer really surprised me.. and since then I've drank a ton of it... I actually buy it by the case... The look and taste are both good, but what got me the most was the smells as the beer warmed... you can literally smell the strongest floral smells I think I've ever smelled in a beer... it literally starts smelling like flowers are in the beer... The taste also gets more complex as the beer warms.. I recommend drinking this only slightly cold.. or take it out of the fridge and let it set for 10 mins or so... When I seen coors brewed this I couldn't believe it... At least someone over there knows wtf theyre doing, haha... Sure isn't the brewer coors light and that other crap beer they make... If you haven't tried this beer you should."

"Nothing special but I liked it. The bottle itself is pretty cool looking. It's a thirst quencher that I'd like to try again on a hot summer day. I have a feeling the bottle will go down smoothly and relieve that yearning for something cool, unsweetened and wet to give that get up and go kind of vitality you need when you're, say, mowing the lawn. Nice."
""
""
""
"Trying the Batch 19 at the UGS Lounge at Dulles Airport...The beer poured a nice clear copper with thin white head that is not leaving a lace. The scent carries bready malt with hint of bittering hops. The taste is very nice and smooth...there is a definite malt which provides a biscuit punch then finishes clean with slight bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium in body with good carbontation. Overall this is a solid lager and was worth the try and the bottle is pretty unique as well."

"One more comment. Everybody has their taste preferences. I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest and have probably tried more microbrews than most people think exist. Within the caveat that everybody likes something, most microbrew stuff is bilge. I like good beer whether it's a global brand or one cooked up in the neighbor's garage. If you're in the camp that says the big brewers can't possibly make great beer, well, as the saying goes, ""no man is as blind as one who refuses to see"" or taste in this case. The big brewers weren't always big which is still irrelevant. But, prior to prohibition they all had great recipes. Every once in a while they bring'em back and batch 19 is one of them. AB has done it in the past as well. So, if you're open-minded, not quite ready for an IPA but like a complex, hoppy flavored lager that will go great on a hot or cold day, give this a shot."

"Price: $9.99 for 6/pack"

"Coors' Batch 19 is the American macro-brewery's attempt to cash in on the recent explosion of craft brewing in the US. I purchased this bottle expecting not to like it. What a surprise. No. What a shock! For the first time, I'm nostalgic for the 19th century and looking forward to trying more of these ""pre-prohibition"" beers, which have been increasingly visible on the craft beer scene of late."
"Overall: This is well brewed beer. The lightly roasted malt flavor is accented with well balanced hopped finished. A good, fairly light bodied beer, with decent flavor. Great on hot day. Hats off to Coors for this one."

"O: An all malt lager with a balance of enjoyable hop character. A good example of a style I really get to enjoy outside of home brewing circles."
"I have to say, for the style, this beer was much better than I thought it was going to be. Definitely a good alternative to the Bud, Miller Lite, etc."
"Fairly drinkable beer. Poured at a good temperature with a thick, cream-colored, medium size head that settles after a bit and some lace. Color is a clear medium amber with a few slow bubble trails. Aroma is a tad perfumey, malt, grass. Flavor's like nose, tang and mild sweetness up front, bitter in back. Not too complex, but drinkable. Body/carbonation decent. Finish is like flavor, on the short side."
""
""
""
"Over all, this is a pleasant beer. If I wanted to drink a lighter beer, I'd consider having one or two in a bar."
""
"Try this!"

"to bad they have the money and market to make a real good beer. this is not"

"My favorite beer to date. I'm a history guy so when I saw a pre-prohibition style lager, I had to get it. Could not be happier with the decision. Good color, wasn't a fan of the smell because I didn't realize that the first batch I picked up was way past the suggested date. It still tasted great though. Then had to buy a new batch not past the date and it was even better. Can't believe it's made by Coor's. Thanks a lot, Prohibition, for making this delicious beer disappear for almost a century"

"A pleasant surprise! I had no idea Coors was capable of such a product. Easy to drink and refreshing. Everyone should go into this one with an open mind and prepare to be blown away because it's not just a good beer for a domestic brewery, it's just a good beer period."
""
""
""
""
""

"O: This beer is a lot fuller bodied compared to other beers in the style and doesn't have any adjunct-like flavors."

"Overall I really like Coors Batch 19. If beer in 1919 was really as tasty as that, I can see why prohibition was in force."
"Coors has made a solid beer here. If they can manage to avoid marking it up to craft beer prices, they could find themselves with a new hit. Just a few bucks more than a 12-pack of the Banquet would be perfect. The fancy bottles are nice too...shame they aren't pry-off!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I think it is drinkable. It is an interesting departure from their regular beers, that just so happens to taste a lot like all their other beers, albeit slightly better."
""
""
""
""
""

"Batch 19 Pre-Prohibition Style Lager pours a light orange color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a touch of spicy hops in the aroma, and sweet maltiness also is noticeable. Fairly good flavor (guess I wasn't expecting that) that starts with a sweet malt flavor and then some spicy hops make themselves noticeable. Much better than a typical macro American Adjunct Lager. The bottle says it is inspired by a pre-prohibition recipe."

"Malts? Hops? Flavor? I am used to macro lagers being wimpy, fizzy beers, but this was a notable exception. Coors really came through big time with this ""pre-prohibition style lager."" I would love to see it offered in tall ball cans, perhaps taking a space alongside PBR, Narragansett and Schlitz at my local digs."

""
""
""
""
"I'm wanting to compare this to other ""retro-brews", or attempts thereof, and am definitely interested in how this recipe was conceived or discovered. It definitely has some hop flavor, beyond a mere kiss, and reminds me a bit of some ""retro"" styles out there, such as Olympia, Grain Belt, Schlitz, and regular ol' Coors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains and malts. Taste is crisp, grains, some malts, lightly hopped, not a lot going on. Feels light in the mouth and overall is not a bad beer, but at this price point you can do better."
""
""
"12 oz from a six pack from local Mom and Pop convenience store, S.Salem $6.99. Slightly darker gold than usual for a pale lager..nice really,large frothy white head. Realtivly clean aroma or weak caramel,nuts, and weak resin hops. Taste is balanced, caramel,grassy hop and bread..not too bad really maybe a bit sweet. Hae to say i liked the mouthfeel of this ..it made me take big gulps and i am not thirsty..i can only imagine how fast this would go next week as i camp in the Oregon Dunes. A good lager"
""
"The twelve cost me $13 (a ripoff), and I feel bad because I just got done telling my wife that I would certainly be able to drink the entire twelve pack. But one taste and I poured the rest down the sink."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Decent head, and some pretty strong lacing. Nose is malty with a little tea and sugar. Peaty roasted malt flavor, accentuated with wood chips and a slight sweetness. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think the quality of this beer is relative to the situation. In my case it was the better of multiple evils, and it was hot out. If I were to have this beer at a bar or restaurant, it would certainly be a lot worse."
"I purchased a 6 pack of this thinking it was a local micro @ 10.00 a 6 pack I was robbed. Cracked open a cold one and had to do a double check. Is this beer or water. Oh its a Coors product. you would think that a company that has been in business as long as the big boys they would figure out how to create some beers."
""
""
"O-I was not impressed, the guy at ABC Liquor was very excited, and sold me well, bastard! This is nothing different than the standard Coors crap from Walmart."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have become spoiled living in Michigan and all the great craft beers we have. I was pleasantly surprised to taste this decent craft style beer by one of the big boys, Coors. It isn't as lifeless as a Bud Light or Coors Light. There is an actual taste. Although the hop flavor is limited, it is there. It has a smooth taste and not bitter. I would drink it on a hot day when I don't want to be filled up."
""
""
"The smell is somewhat weak, but the taste is very full and warm to the tongue. The carbonation on this one is on the high side, but compliments the after taste very well, making you want more. Not anything special just a great regular ol beer. Would prefer on a hot summer day sitting around the grill. Good from the bottle and glass."
"I'm impressed in the way that I didn't hate this like I was expecting to. It's not something I'd ever go out of my way to order again, but if given the choice between this and your typical Bud, Miller, Coors, etc. products, I'd take this in a heartbeat. Quaffable to the max, though I wish the nose were a bit more lively to say the least."
""
""
""
""
"Overall-Like a fuller bodied Coors. Goes great with pizza and a game though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, considering the style it’s not too bad but there are other similar beers that I would choose first."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The brews got a bold flavor and good presence, but lacks it a memorable pour of odor. I was overall happy with its taste, but am not of the opinion that it is one of the better ambers I've had."
"Pours to a rich white head and minimal lacing. Gold/amber color. Aroma is grass, earthy hops and sweet grains, some DMS. Flavor is sweet, corny, slightly malt and not quite balanced by the hops. Mouthfeel is not bad. On the intangibles, this beer works pretty well. The hop flavors are approaching APA levels and the flavors are strong, although it could stand to be a bit drier and less chewy for a lager that is not a bock or Marzen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid golden color with some off-white froth on top. Sweet, clean malt and grassy, spicy hop aromas. More noble-like hops in he mouth with some added floral character, sweet-ish cereal grain, hay, and fruity yeast. Pretty crisp and lightly bitter. Not too shabby all around, for what it is."
""
""
""
"O: In the end, this is a good, refreshing lager. I really appreciate the fact that the flavor displays a bit of complexity and the body has some depth to it. I don't know how well this will go over with either beer geeks or BMC guzzlers, but this is far from a bad effort. Recommended to those with an open mind."
""
""
""
"The taste was a bit the same with some malty, roasted, nutty and grainy qualities. Somewhat bland but not much more than average this is not a ringing endorsement for bootleggers beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just a decent lager – pretty forgettable."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer gets trashed for being a MillerCoors product, but honestly, this is a great beer. I don't care if A Brewer Who Shall Not Be Named makes it- they make a great interpretation of the style and should continue to do so. A refreshing drink with considerable more flavor that other beers of its family. I honestly believe that people rate this beer lower based on who makes it, and that in a blind taste test, this one would compete admirably with other of the best AALs."
""
""
"On the whole, this is not a very good beer. But it's not the worst beer I've ever reviewed either. Not worthy of my 400th review, but whatever. I don't regret any of the 400 beers I've had en route to this moment. No reason to start now."
"To the Point: have to say I did not expect much from this product; after being tortured with that Third Shift crap – what else do you expect from the big beer companies trying to compete with the craft beer segment … a good beer … yeah right. Oh yeah, right! This is good. I will buy it again for sitting around the campfire up north."
""

"Overall this is a real interesting take on the style, quite memorable."
"This really is a great beer, all the more for the fact that a macro-brewery made it...proving those guys really are capable of making delicious beers--if American consumers actually demanded them..."

""
""

"Yes, I would recommend it, especially if you have not tried it already."

""
"It is good."

"Batch 19 is good, not great. I was expecting more from this ""pre-prohibition"" beer. It's a step above Coors Light for sure, but it's not as remarkable as the label would have you believe. I was expecting a higher ABV content as well. Overall, it's a good beer, but it's not noteworthy enough where I need to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I did not like this beer. I gave it a chance. It reminds me of all the beers AB tries to get creative with. The aftertaste is always Bud. In this case the aftertaste was Coors Light. Take Coors Light, add some hops and some coloring and this is what you'll end up with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent flavorful adjunct lager."
""
""
"With that being said, Batch 19 rates better than average.... 3.5"
""
"Overall: I'll be damned. Easily my favorite Coors product. This beer should stirs up nostalgic images of rugged, blue collar lunch breaks at the steel mill. I will be getting this again."
""
""

"Not a heck of a lot going on here but still a vast improvement over the Beck's Sapphire I drank a bit ago."
""
""
""
"A bigger tasting and fuller richer lager than typical."
""
""
""
""
"O: I didn't realize until I brought this home that it was brewed by Coors, at which point I became quite skeptical. But this was a very nice surprise. The taste has a great amount of complexity and balance, and they nailed the mouthfeel. I could definitely see myself buying this again sometime."
""
"Pours a five finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Almost clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Sweet bread nose, flavor is bread and grass, malty sweet, hints of hops at finish. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, MA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As a craft brew drinker I had my doubts about this beer. However, I will admit this was actually a very drinkable beer. Nice deep golden color with an herbal biscuit aroma. The right balance of hops and malt. Notes of caramel come through in the finish. This one was actually a good all around beer for me. If this is the beer they had during prohibition then the guys who broke the law to carry it have my salute of approval."
""
""
"This beer was just OK I would drink it again but all of the things I have heard about it, and the hype around it I expected alot more it was just a regular beer. It is worth a try and it is a great attempt by Coors to branch out."
"Visually comes off glowing amber golden hued with flowing off white rocky textured head, thick bubbles forming as it settles down. Thick bands of lace settle along the sides of my glass, quite a nice looking brew from the folks at Coors. Aroma has a lingering citric, grassy hop nose amongst a clean mix of grain perceived sweetness, let the hops shine in this supposed recipe pre-prohibition 1919 lager. Definitely a nice smelling mix of barley, corn husks, cereal grains with hop appreciation showing some love from the bottles label it says strisselspalt and hersbrucker German hops. The alcohol weighs in pretty heavy in the flavor at first but settles into a mix of semi sweet bready grains and bitter green hoppy citrus rind and grassy accents. Not the best American brewed lager lingering flavors that don't work are bitterness from an almost plastic or burnt bread crust carbon flavor that I'm just not appreciating. Overall mouthfeel has ample carbonation but is a bit harsh with those lingering qualities that stick with you between sips, not a beer I'm looking to consume on a regular basis."
""
""
"Very drinkable, quenches the thirst on a hot day. Definatly one of the better adjunct lagers I've had, but that's still not saying much. Would I buy it again, NO."
""
""
""
""
"CHEERS"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely one of the best adjunct lagers that I have ever had. It has a pronounced hop character. It doesn't have any of the off flavors that plague the style like apples, metal, and the intensely sweet grains. It also has a tremendous mouthfeel that isn't grossly over carbonated as many macros can be. I could definitely sit down with a few of these and enjoy a game or family outting."
""
""
"Overall: Its not bad but not something I would go back to. Still has that big beer adjunct taste which I just cannot get past. But this beer is a step forward over their other products which shows some hope for the future."
""
"Overall, this is considerably better than your typical American Adjunct Lager. Its much more flavorful and fuller bodied. You could definitely do worse."
""
""
"A decent effort from Coors."
"Coors took that bitter craft beer taste and made it drinkable. You can pound about 2 or 3 of these and not feel bloated or heavy like many crafts do. Coors found a way to commercialize the craft taste. So if you are in the mood for that more bitter beer, this is a great way to go. Don't let the beer snobs on here fewl you."
""
" I like the flavor while it has a slight pils sweetness it also has an herbal hop flavor which adds to the malt profile with a dry finish it is a pretty drinkable lager"
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 6/10/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a lot of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of pear, apple, lemon, floral, grass, bready grain, cracker, light pepper, and yeast esters. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast esters; decent strength. Taste of lemon, apple, pear, floral, grass, bread, light pepper, cracker, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light fruits, floral, grass, bread, cracker, and earthiness on the finish for a bit. Pleasant flavors with good balance of malt and hop flavors; with no cloying flavors present after the finish. Slight grainy astringency, but not bad. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good pale lager. Good malt/hop flavor balance; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."
"However, it's a bit pricey considering its origin."
""
"O: When I found this on tap at a place that did not have a lot of other interesting brews currently available, I said what the heck and decided to try it - expectations were pretty low but this is much better than the traditional BMC offerings and I could see myself getting it again when at a place that has a more limited craft tap list."
""
""
"It's by far the best adjunct lager I've had. If you see this at the bar and the other options are bad, this is definitely worth trying out. It really shows that the style does not have to atrocious."
""
""
"I think many will not be open to this beer simply because its from one of big boys. Judge it for what it is. Word."
""
""
"Multidimensional, complex yet not overwhelming, full but not heavy, Batch 19 is a real option for a satisfying upgrade/premium staple beer. As one who tries local beers whenever I have the chance, I'm frequently disappointed when I get into an establishment that doesn't have a variety (e.g. a chain restaurant like Applebees, Chilis, etc.). I typically end up ordering a Sam Adams but am not happy with the heaviness and sweetness. Likewise, as a go-to option at home when I want a good beer without things getting complicated, I want something much more than a mainstream pale ale but not something extremely craft. Something complex but mainstream. Batch 19 seems to be the right beer for this niche, as it is probably the most consistent high-quality pour beer out of a mainstream production. MillerCoors got craft brewing on a large scale right on this one."

"All in all this is an enjoyable beer that tastes like something from a craft brewery. Not perfect, and it would be difficult to session a beer like this because of its tendency to become cloyingly sweet and thick in the mouth, but still something I would crave and enjoy drinking occasionally. A lot of pretentious snobs comment here that it tastes like a Coors product. They're full of baloney. If you put it in a micro-brew bottle and served it to them, they would not know the difference. If you see some at your local store, try it and see for yourself."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a crystal-clear amber body with nearly an inch of off white head. Smells grainy and biscuity. Tastes biscuity, bready, and somewhat nutty with just a touch of grass and citrus to balance. Tastes good and is quite drinkable. Balanced and flavorful."

"Lightly sweet malts, vaguely grassy noble hops, with a bitter carbonic bite in the end. Some astringency, gassy and light bodied. It's ok, fairly drinkable but ultimately nothing special. Wouldn't refuse at a party, but wouldn't buy it with so many better craft lagers in the market."
""
"It pours a golden color with a frothy white head. Smells like your average American macro beer, with some corn and adjunct sweetness. Now the taste is where it gets interesting, up front I noticed a nice lemongrass bitterness along with the adjunct flavor, but the hoppy taste really stands out and isn't very noticeable in the aroma so it's a surprise when you taste it. It is light bodied with moderate carbonation and a dry finish. This beer kind ofcaught me off guard, It's way better than I thought, It looks and smells like any old beer but the flavor really makes up for it. I could actually see myself drinking this more often."

"Poured it in the nonic, but it wasn't smellin' bubonic. Nah, not that sticky icky stuff. Taste? Yeah, it was aite. This is definitely an Adjunct, but Raul respect it like Little Caesar hot n ready special: you know you're not going to get the best, but hot dawg it ain't bad! (for what it is). And what it is, is a palatable Adjunct. (Looks like dehydrated urine) but it's a palatable Adjunct."

"Like another reviewer said, I think many people are rating this lower than it deserves simply because it is made by Coors. Of generic, run of the mill, canned beers, Coors ranks low for me. Maybe just about Natty Ice. This doesn't even taste reminiscent of typical Coors and it is worth a shot. I definitely stand with the Brothers rather than user average on this one."
"This beer is OK. I'm not to sure when I would actually want to drink this beer or what food I would pair it with, and so on. It is a microbrew take on macrobrew ingredients that accomplishes its goals better than other premium macrobrews (e.g. Bud black crown, Becks sapphire) that taste like the only thing they have done is raised the ABV."
"I feel like people are giving this poor reviews just because it's Coors. This is a really good beer. Not quite Full Sail Session, but damn close."
""

"Update: Tried the beer a second time upon getting home after having a few (much better) beers at the bar. It was even worse than the first bottle this afternoon. Drainpour. Must update ratings. How the Beer Bros rated this a 90 I have NO idea."

"O: A hoppier and fuller bodied AAL? Unfortunately, this falls in the same price range as Sierra Nevada beers where I live, so I'll probably never buy it again. Make it as cheap as regular Coors and I've got a new go to. A much better swing towards quality than Shocktop or the like."

"Overall- Found this beer as an okay sessionable beer, a basic flavor that is drinkable but nothing to get you out of your seat for"
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber, moderate cap of frothy white foam. Scent leads with fresh dried cereal grains and sweet malted barley, some grassy hoppyness and a touch of citrus rind, finishes with a bit of fresh corn on the nose. Taste follows scent - both fresh and malted grains, moderate hop presence and touch of vegital taste. Medium bodied, surprisingly creamy for the style. Overall, was pleased with the scent and flavor profiles and the body of this beer."
""
""
""
"O - Looks great, smells nice, tastes a bit odd. Coors actualy brewed a beer that I sort of enjoyed, nice!"
"A deep golden coin color that had a white head on top, and good lines of lacing come to. A sweet and malty nose. A taste that's heavy on grains, malts, and a surprisingly good hop presence. A mouthfeel that is almost creamy. Not a bad experience. If they put this in a can, I'll definitely buy it as a camping beer."

"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. March 2013 indicated on the bottle.Pours a semi-translucent orange-gold with a fizzy, half inch, white head that quickly dissipates into a soapy skim; no lacing. Nose expresses corn adjuncts, a hint of sweetness and a light, skunky/sour mash quality. Taste consistent with nose - malt profile is almost non-existent. There's a slight grassiness to this, as well as some earthy hoppiness, eventually yielding to the skunky/sour mash character towards the back. Mouthfeel is light in body, with an assertive carbonation and a semi-crisp finish. Overall, a pretty solid American Adjunct Lager. I had this on-tap a few months back and thought it was quite tasty (didn't realize it was a Coors product). That said, given the bottle dating, I feel like this beer went a little downhill. As such, I may need to update this review with a fresher bottle."
""
"O - Credit to Coors for the attempt because it isn't a bad beer. What I see is a brew that has little to offer the craft customer and not much for the gateway craft drinker. Stick to Sam Adams and the local craft."

"Good Bironga are tough, I never thought that Coors, or Miller now merged with, could do something gueno, well ... being a mother is with cool people arriving good beers to the shelves, finally, I found something between a Dortmunder and a Märzen, good body, very good flavor balanced between malt and hops candies, which I guess is the same hops used in the coors normal. 5.5 degrees of alcohol, enough for me. cheers!"

"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured copper with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, spice, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, grain, earth, and subtle spice. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly average brew. Nothing on this one really stood out if I'm honest. I would like to give them credit for trying on this one but I really don't know why they felt the need to do so. Worth ticking if you get the chance, but that is about it."

"O - I would drink this again. A nice attempt by the big boys to bring something with substance out of the woodwork. Still, it's been done better before by better breweries that need the attention."

"Kind of cool to try a beer like this, but I wouldn't buy it."
"A nice adjunct lager, solid malty backbone with good bitter hops, clean finish and highly drinkable. Sort of a watered down adjunct SA. My only issue was the price, in my area 9/six competes with many better beers. If Coors drops the price to a more reasonable level this one could make it."
"Overall - Does not have the best drinkability I've ever had, but definitely can have quite a few of these at 5.5%"
"I have to admit, I'm impressed with this one. I didn't think that Coors had it in them to produce such a drinkable beer. It's really quite a shame that pre-prohibition lagers aren't attempted more often by BMC. They might win over some new drinkers in the process."
""
""
"Poured aggresively from bottle creates a foamy head that goes down slowly atop an amber beer. No lacing. Few streams of carbonation. Fruity aroma, probably from hops. Great moderate mouthfeel with good, but not overbearingly sweat or bready coating on the tongue. Taste is fruity with a citrusy IPA bitterness. Finish is dry with lingering hops. A balanced beer. Overall, a surprisingly satisfying offering from Coors."

"From the 12 oz bottle (one of the silliest designs ever) bought in San Francisco."

"Overall, this seems like less of a Classic American Pilsner and more of a poorly made amber lager. If the sweetness were dialed back a bit and the metallic aroma taken care of this could be a decent beer. If I want an older style American beer, I'll take a Schlitz Gusto."
""
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. In the past year I have had several ""pre-prohibition brews"" that were very enjoyable. This however was not that enjoyable. It tastes like coors original/banquet beer but with a dirty caramel flavor and a touch of herbal hops."
""
""
"D- My first experience with this beer was a bar in Golden, CO. I thought it was a great beer to pair with a meal when your selection is limited. I recently picked it up in bottles and think it is still a pretty great beer. I prematurely told a few people it was Coors and could see the bias change as they found out."
""
""
"Pours a dark amber with a high white head. The smell is crisp minerals, some grain, maybe a little mild citrus. The taste is pretty yeasty, or maybe like soda bread, with a tough mineral backbone and some citrus tang in the finish. I could believe this was a dortmunder lager. It's a little more fizzy than it needs to be, but is largely crisp and refreshing. Not one I'll probably revisit often, but certainly a respectable lager."

"O - This is nice. Better than regular Coors."
"looks and smells like ""beer beer"". taste is a more full-bodied banquet beer with more malt sweetness, less corn, and a touch of bitter hops. it's still not a great brew but is leagues ahead of regular coors, and I'm a fan of that beer. it was nice and cheap, a plus, and hid the 5.5 completely. a winner in my book"

"It actually has malt flavor. The graininess and tang are somewhat offputting."

"clear golden color white half finger head. grainy hay like nose. tastes is dry biscuit, leafy hop, grainy mouthful, a bit of acidity, pretty big body for a smaller beer, not as clean as expected with a bit of flavor but nothing crazy. boring with some rough edges. feels nice in the mouth and has more flavor than your typical lager but it's bad example of a great lager in my opinion."
""
""
"Taste-Right off-the-bat off-putting metallic note, pale malt. A couple of German specialty hops are listed on the bottle, but my taste buds are having a hard time finding their hiding place. Maybe Batch 20 will be better. Here's hoping."
"Wish I could have had this available back in the day, tasty lager beer that is a cut above the regular BMC fare."
""
""
""
""
""
"so this is a Coors product. first time I've ever bought one. it was an impulse buy at Wegmans. To be honest, it's not bad. could be a lawnmower beer for sure."
""
""
""
"Notes: The branding seems to be piggybacking on what some craft brands are already doing, namely Brooklyn (see Brooklyn Lager and its pre-prohibition plug) and Pretty Things (the historical recipes series). They also seem to be trying to tap into that rebellious craft beer spirit. Mixing in a little bit of that old-timey throwback feel too. It works though. It'll be interesting to see how this sells down the line and where they go with it."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pokal glass. Pours copper with a thick, slowly dissipating white head. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass. The beer has a bready and sweet smell from the malt. The hops bring some grassy and citrus notes in the nose. The flavor is of bread with those grassy hops that add some nice bitterness and balance to this beer. I also get some of those citrus hop flavors and not as much corn flavor one would find in regular Coors. This is to be expected because there is much less corn used in this recipe than in regular Coors. There is some caramel sweetness that opens up during consumption as well. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The beer finishes crisp and the drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer. The big boys aren't sitting tight in this market and this throwback recipe is an example of what they are capable of brewing."
"OVERALL: A stylistically exceptional lager that is very clean and well defined. Super refreshing, Coors should replace all of their standard products with this, most of their customers wouldn't notice the difference, but BeerAdvocates certainly would."
"Taste/feel: Well above anything else I've had from the style. There's some of that adjunct in the flavor, but the malt is much more pleasant than what I'm used to. The feel is also nice, as it's smooth and easy drinking. At 5.5% ABV and without any offensive flavors or smells, this is a VERY good choice if you have the option ... especially for the price. Far and away the best of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A nice easy drinking and good session brew. It has enough hop flavor to make it somewhat exciting, but it still maintains an easy and relatively clean lager taste."
""
""
""
"O - Great brew. Would drink again and recommend. I enjoyed it straight from the bottle and from a frosted Mason Jar :)"
""
"Approachable American lager that's easy to drink. And coming from Coors, which is noteworthy, as I was told that Batch 19 was the name of the brewery, not a beer made by Coors."
""
"O - a fine example of the style."
"O-Great overall. I picked it up from a local grocery sore first, and have since been asking / requesting for it at a few local bars. No tap handles yet to be seen but a few places offer it in bottles."
""
""
"Much more interesting that most brews that come out of Coors, both in flavor and body. Hardly seems like an adjunct lager at all. I'm impressed."

""
""
"Don't be fooled. Tell your friends."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-I seemed to like the first few bottles of this more than now when I am sitting down to review. Didn't pickup the tart finish as much previously. Regardless this is a nice beer for an adjunct lager. I've read some criticism about the actually effort to reduplicate this beer and how they fell short and what they could have done better. I agree with those thoughts but this drinks ok anyhow. Wouldn't buy it for the price again but if priced like a regular BMC I'd pick it up from time to time.."
"The deep golden color, and one finger thick head, made for an attractive looking pour. The smell was pretty nondescript malts, and just a shade of hops. The taste was a simple mix of sweet corn cereal, light hops, and some toffee. Very clean in mouth, like a lager should be, with somewhat vegetal finish. This was head and shoulders above anything else from Coors, that I have ever had, but it was nothing I would go out and search for."
""
""
""
""
"Overall its a good attempt by Coors and hopefully it will lead more people into craft beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good American Adjunct Lager."
"One of the more impressive AALs and even more impressive it comes from Coors. Pours a clear, pale amber color with just over one finger of head that had good retention. Surprisingly heavy amount of lacing is left down the glass. Aroma of sweet malt and hay/grass- like hop qualities. Nice clean flavor that is just a little too sweet for me. The hops are a little more assertive than todays AALs, but it is not enough to balance the sweetness. The hops give some grassy flavor. Good body and carbonation. Enjoyable lighter beer texture with lively carbonation. Nice that Coors is branching out a bit and offering an interesting lager. Maybe not enough to warrant another purchase from me, but should appeal to other pale lager drinkers."
"Sweet malts, bready, toasted, a little caramel, just a dash of corn. Hop bitterness is medium, sharp, but mainly citrus-piney. Finish is very dry. Body is light-medium, carbonation is very active, crisp."
"O- more flavor than most of its style, yet not too sweet. a lot like a euro pale ale. not a bad option if you're looking for a decent lighter beer."
""
""
"Poured a clear golden color with a thin fizzy head; no real retention or lacing to speak of. Sweetness of pale malts in the nose, light leafy hops, spent grains. Toasted grains in the taste with an unexpected honey sweetness, backed by light leafy hops as detected in the aroma. Light body, easily drinkable, but overall lacking in flavor and complexity, as any basic adjunct lager would be. Still not bad, all things considered."
"deep golden with a thick white foamy head that stayed around for awhile. smell was sweet with a little teabag type hop in the background. taste was overly sweet for me, but it went GREAT with the hot, fresh cheese pizza that i had with it. it complemented the crust and cheese in a fine way. i also had it with a bunch of tacos a few nights later...again, solid with food. it has a medium heavy mouthfeel and goes down very smoothly. again, the only complaint i have is that it is a bit overly sweet for me to enjoy without food. good offering from coors, though...by far and away the most taste in a bmc beer i have had."
""
""
""
"The appearance is a deep bronze, mildly carbonated, with a thick white head. The taste is hop forward, but not overly hoppy, balanced out with malt character. Batch 19 is a well rounded brew. This is a very solid offering from Coors. I can't help but think that many reviewers are biased because this is produced by a big brewer. I will definitely keep this one in my rotation, and I advise any beer lover to at least give this one a shot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: It's weird comparing this to other adjunct lagers since this on another level; really this is a beer to compare to the amber lagers and the Euro lagers of the day. Drinkable, a little to sugary, but a solid effort."

""

""
" Recommended, I will certainly buy again."
""
"I cracked this thinking it would be a gimmick, as in ""let's bottle some slightly thicker 'Silver Bullet' and market it as something historical."" Well, turns out that this is actually a really good brew! If this is what macro lagers were like back in 1919, fire up the DeLorean and take me back!"

"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long-neck bottle, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
""
"sickly-sweet, with a poor blend of flavors. The honey taste does not blend well, standing out in an awkward manner rather than enhancing flavor. As if Coors could not agree on an overall theme and tried to include all. Sweet/bitter/sour without distinction."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"would not buy it again"
"Prohibition did a lot to ruin beer but it was also beneficial to a select few breweries. I won't delve into the history here but, sufficed to say, Batch 19 is a welcome start to reparations from Coors. It harkens back to a time when brewers didn't use fouling, adulterating adjuncts. I doubt this offering will change the culture of commercial lagers, but hopefully it will change the tastes of at least some commercial lager drinkers."
""
"Overall - This beer stands out among its american lager peers. Light and refreshing, but flavorful and appealing. How can it come from Coors?"
""
""
""
""
""
"O:Damn coors. I never thought I'd find an AAL I liked but you've done it. Not start mass producing this instead of your light beers and you've got a new customer. If this is what an AAL should be then I'm on board. I would certainly purchase a draft or 6 pack of this regularly."

"12oz bottle, pours a deeper golden/copper color with a foamy off-white head, good lace surprisingly. Aromas are lager yeast, grain, grassy, fruity -apricot? Tastes are different - grainy, bready, bread crust, odd veggie, onion, rum, and tea. Good body, creamy, smooth, ample carbonation. Overall, I found some of the flavors to be somewhat odd, and the onion notes were rather off-putting. Fun to try, but I'd pass on it if I came across it again."
"Overall a better brew than I was expecting, and this needs to be made more mainstream so i can eat this with some wings at Bdubs."

"Pours a clear golden-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, grass, and hay. Taste is fairly sweet and is of malt, grain, caramel, and some slight grass and hay flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that I would not ever think was something Coors produced in a blind tasting."
""

"This is an excellent adjunct lager. After finding out this was Coors I was very surprised. nice job."

"O: Next to a lot of craft lagers, it's competent yet wholly unimpressive; but next to other BMC macro lagers, it's a damn revelation. Don't seek it out, but give it a try if you manage to randomly catch it at your local watering hole."

"Pours a clear golden color with a short lived white head. Nose is fairly typical macro lager aroma of sweet grain/cereal, light esters, and minimal hops. A slight corn note is present. The flavor is sweet grain, minimal biscuit qualities, and no hops to speak of. A touch watery, some yeast and mild fruit esters. That's pretty much it. Nothing wrong with it, just nothing all that great about it."
"Cool bottle. Interesting brew. Pours an amber lager with a bit of white bubbles here and there. Nose is caramel, sugar substitutes, some banana, a little grain - nice nose. Flavor is nice and smooth lager - reminds me of a munich helles and is slightly sweet and woody. Easy drinking. Medium bodied with lower carb and a nice semi slick finish. A surprise from a giant - a really drinkable beer. I would order this occasionally."
""

""
""
"Overall: It'll do in a pinch!"
""
"This one was crystal clear and had a brownish/golden hue to it, mild carbonation and it was topped off with an off white head that quickly thinned out into a small congregation of bubbles. It did have some mild lacing. Overall, this beer looked nice and inviting. The aroma was a bit thin, some roasted wheat mixed in with roasted hops came through, but I couldn’t pick up much else. The taste was really good, smooth throughout and a mild hops flavor dominated the beer, some mild citrus flavors like orange zest are present. Bitter all around but the bitterness isn’t overwhelming. The aftertaste has a mild hoppy and alcohol taste but it’s easy to swallow. By the way, this beer has a light-to-medium mouth feel. Overall not bad, I personally wouldn’t buy this one on a regular basis, but I do have to say you’ve got to try this one."

"Sampled on June 29, 2012 at The Tap Sports Bar and Grill in Belmont, New Hampshire. The pour is golden to pale yellow with a small white fizzy head that settles down. The aroma highlights include pale malts, a slight hop note that is both clean and crisp, but little in the way of adjuncts. The body is light to medium. The taste was of grain malts with moderate bitterness at the end. Compared to other adjuncts this was an improvement. I had to drive a ways to find it in my area. It tasted better than other standard Coors products but was nothing extraordinary."
"3/13 update...had served on tap at a local bar...was not nearly as good as I remembered it...I would have given it a 3 this time, so I am changing my taste to the average, or 3.5."

"The beer pours brilliantly clear deep golden bordering on copper color with a thick white head that diminished to a thin skim yet left bits of lacing. A good looking beer. The aroma is moderate sweet malt, rather grainy, perhaps a hint of grassy hops. The flavor is medium-high grainy malt, a bit of spicy hop flavor and the finish is dry and crisp, with just a bit of sweet malt reemerging. The body is medium-light with medium-high carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer, in the pre-prohibition style I've had better, but worth picking up at least a single."

"I had no idea this was a Coors product when I bought it so my perception of it was totally unbiased. Pours a coppery amber color with a decent frothy head. Aroma is subtle grain - mellow. Taste is malty with a decent hops tinge, and a bit of a peppery overtone. I don't know if they used adjuncts in this beer, I don't taste them but if they did, they were used very well. I think this is a pretty tasty beer and I would buy it again, one of the better lagers I've had actually."

"O: call a spade a spade...its coors, but its tasty. I like the story and mystiq that comes along with this brew, but most of all, its just a good beer. Perhaps a brew to introduce other to the world of craft. Highly sessionable. Tip of the hat to Coors."
"Quite easy to drink. Better than I thought it would be."

"Beer arrived in a pint glass, translucent golden amber color with a finger's width of white bubble foam, good retention and lacing. The nose is malty sweet with hints of earthy hops and caramel sweetness. The flavor is mild and approachable with a solid malt foundation and mild bitterness. Well balanced without a hint of skunk that is so prevalent with the style. Finishes clean and crisp. Good. Lighter bodied but not watered down, nice, easy to drink. Overall, again one of the better adjunct lagers out there."

"Coors Archive Brewing Company introduces Batch 19, a per-Prohibition style lager, based on authentic recipes dating back to before all alcohol was banned. Batch 19 pours a golden-amber with a slim, light off-white head and a decent amount of lacing. A slight, yet malty nose is joined with somewhat surprising citrus hop notes. a semi-sweet malt profile meets the pallet before being balanced out by slightly spicy hop characteristics, all before leading into a crisp, clean finish. The beer is medium body with a lighter amount of carbonation. Thankfully Prohibition didn't last, but we believe Batch 19 will!"

"an upgrade from other coors products this one is presented beautifully in unique glass. looks and smells a little darker than their usual stuff. this beer has a much more prominent malt profile than i was expecing, and it just has a whole lot more flavor than anything else ive tried from coors. its not a great beer, but it is drinkable. im always a fan of putting a little more oomph into a brew, and the same applies at the macro level. step in the right direction for coors."

"O - Not too shabby, Batch 19's throw-back attitude and pre-prohibiton bandwagon-jumping are a bit gimmicky, but it's a drinkable brew. Not overly hoppy, but surprisingly so coming from the big guys. Good balance and nice finish."

"Pours a deep golden color that borders on red with a decent white head that displays moderate retention and lace. Smell is sweet grainy bready malt with a smattering of spicy earthy hops to counter the malt. Taste is quite sweet, almost too sweet with honey like bready malt. Bits of corn spice and earth try to cut through the sweetness and almost succeed. Medium body and carbonation with a sweet sticky mouthfeel. Not bad for an adjunct lager and I would certainly pick this one over most others."
"Overall, Batch 19 is a nice little beer in a Schlitz Gusto sort of way. Although I doubt Coors will ever veer away from their more vapid staples, Batch 19 shows that they really can produce a decent beer."

"Hopefully, like Colorado Native, this will end up in cans."
"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of pale malt, grain, slight sweet malt, and slight citrus hops. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of grain, pale malt, citrus hops, and slight sweet malt. Overall, great appearance, and for an Adjunct good aroma and taste."
"Overall: This wasn;t a bad beer. I enjoyed it at the brewery in Golden. Drinkable and smooth."
"O: Pleasant and easy to drink, but does not stimulate nostalgia for pre-prohibition."
"Saw this on tap at Penguin Pizza on Sat. I have not really seen it around very much here, and even though I knew it was a Coors product, I thought I'd give it a try. Served in a standard pint glass. Muted yellow color to the body. Decent amount of carbonation, with a small head at first. Smell was nothing special, sot of like all other macros. Flavor was a bit better than I was expecting. Pretty mellow taste, but it has some nice notes of malt. Plus the mouthfeel was somewhat thicker than other examples from the BMC catalog. Not a bad beer; I'd order one again if the choices were limited. Worth a shot to try once."
"Described as a pre-prohibition lager, which I used to think meant ""all malt"" but now realize means ""somewhat hoppy adjunct."" And that's exactly what it was: thin pour, full body, dry and lightly bitter American-style lager. Strong cereal grains, almost like eating a bowl of barley, and then some rounded, bitter, east coast hops."
"Thanks Ratman for giving me a bottle of this one the other day. Good refreshment for late afternoon. Poured a nice dark golden color with a good sized white head. Aromas of bread, cereal and light hops. On the palate, light bodied, with cereal, corn and bread."
"Never thought I'd actually see this brew out by me, but then Serendipity came along and randomly dropped it in my lap at a local watering hole. It pours a clear russet-ish straw (this may have just been the weird light in the bar...) topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, light corn (straight from the cob, baby), and mineral water. The taste brings things up a bit, with notes of wheat, caramelized pilsner malts (damn homebrewing...), flowers, light grass, and a twinge of grapefruit peel in the back. The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, I think this is the best Coors product I've had in a long time. I really hope it stays on in the area, so that I can have a nice alternative to the usual BMC nonsense where craft is not abundant. Not all that bad, I gotta tell ya."
"Pours a standard one finger head, the head is almost pure white, maybe slightly off white, it is puttering away fairly fast, it's not a bad head though, from what I can tell from the head that has stuck around, it's good, decent lacing. The body is traditionally darker than a standard lager, it's a very unique color, almost a 50/50 mix between golden/yellow, and amber, I've never seen a beer like this before. For the most part this beer is transparent, but it is dark enough that it objects your view just a little bit. Overall....the head went away fast, but it left good foam and lacing, the body is mostly see through, but it's a really unique color, so overall the look is confusing - unique, bad in some areas, good in others, final conclusion - it looks good. Very good aroma, perfect balance between hops and malts, at least in terms of lagers. The malts come through first, and they are very sweet smelling, but not an offensive or overpowering sweet, it smells just right. Then the hops come through the smell a little bit in the second half of the aroma. Overall I would like the smell to be bigger, but I can't ask much more from Coors and an adjunct lager. Considering everything - this smells really good. Maybe a tiny bit of cheap adjuncts, but not really at all, maybe some honey in here in fact, which would be very nice, anyways, I'm ranting, like I said - good smell. The taste is very interesting, the first thing I get is malt, sweet malt, but like I thought on the smell, it's not offensive, it works with the beer very well. Then comes a nice hop bite, very small, but very noticeable as well. I do notice a nice honey flavor appearing in a few different places in this beer. Overall it's a very smooth, drinkable, tasty beer. The flavor isn't huge, but it really shouldn't be for the style. Overall it tastes really good. Mouthfeel is very good for a lager, not too much carbonation, it's just right, and it's not too watery in the mouth. Drinkability is very high, cause it's light and very tasty. Overall there really isn't anything wrong with this beer, is it outstanding? No, but it's very tasty and pretty dang good. I can't believe how high I rated this beer, considering it's made by Coors, but by gosh it deserves it."
"Overall, not bad, pretty good, and I was surprised to find out, only after, that Coors makes it."
"On tap at We the Pizza in Washington DC. Pours a medium glowing golden with a small white head. Aroma of pale malt, some sweet caramel, grainy and a touch of honey. Flavor is much of the same, a bit of honey, pale grain and slightly bland. A fairly strong metallic flavor I wasn't big on. Finishing lightly bitter and a touch of grassy hops. Light to medium body and a fairly high carbonation. Interesting what they are going for, though could have been better still."
"I can say this, I would prefer this over many other adjunct lagers. This is one of the better tasting examples of the style."
"D: Very drinkable. Don't really taste the adjuncts like most of its ilk."
"d - Not much going on in this beer. Some light citrus hops that are faded but not much else. Not bad for a Coors product but wouldn't look to have again."
"Given that this is a product of the SA/Miller/Coors conglomeration, this beer is a solid average to above-average brew. The bar tendress at this saloon commented that numerous patrons had come to the bar in search of this particular beverage. According to her testimony, upon realizing that is was within their grasp, many expressed that they had achieved beer Nirvana! I am unwilling to extend that degree of self actualization! I am grateful that I was able to sample this self described 'Pre-Prohibition Recipe Lager', but I would not go out of my way to find it in the future."
"Good drinking, reminds me of some of the retro-beers that are all the rage right now. That is a big hint to the MillerCoors marketing department ... tall boy cans, crack into the hipster crowd and this beer might actually make it."
