"Overall: pedestrian but not offensive. A good lawnmower beer."
""
"Gave it a 2.5 based on nostalgia only. Probably a 2.0 beer. Nothing at all stands out. Kinda musty, almost spoiled tasting. It's like buying Ocean Pacific  brand at Walmart. Not real. You are paying for the label only."
"Pretty typical adjunct lager. Drink it fast because the off flavors show when it warms."
"same crap different can, okay when free."

"Lets not kid anybody. This isn't very good beer. It used to be back in the early 70's but a lot of things have changed since then. When I can find it, and that's not very often, I drink it because of the nostalgia effect. I put on some Jerry Jeff , close my eyes and imagine myself 40 years younger driving my 56 Chevy Sedan Delivery around Texas listening to AM radio and going into Austin on occasion to hear some good music at the Armadillo. For that alone its worth the price and the hangover."
""
"Lone Star, its name and also its rating"
""
"Watery, corn flavor and aroma. Zero head, flat mouthfeel. Pretty bad."
"The national beer if Texas, a sweet lager with a grassy finish."
"Piss beer, I had to try just because. PBR bottled with a different label. This is the kind of beer my grandpa might have liked In boot camp back in the 40s. That being said, it's easy drinking for guys that don't require much out of their brew."
""
"For a basic, go-to American-style lager, Lone Star stands alone at the top of the list. Easily drinkable with a good taste and mouthfeel that pairs perfectly with brisket, steak, hunting, tailgating, etc. Lone Star won't be found at the top of most beer snobs' lists, but it remains an excellent American-style lager and holds a proud place as a staple of this Texan's fridge."
""
"My friend brought this up from Texas for me. It was a very average beer. I'd rather drink it than Bud Light any day."

"OK, first this is supposed to be the state beer of Texas but it's made in California? My first sip and I seriously thought this was diluted with water. Very weak. Take your average beer and then mix it 50/50 with water and there you have it: Lone Star beer. I could not even finish 1/4 of the bottle and not wanting the waitress to get offended, I poured most of it on my 12 dozen finished oyster shells and leftover bread to look like I at least drank most of it. Would I drink this if there was nothing else? Sure, but this stuff is not really good at all."

"Out of all the readily available adjucts out there, I find this one to be the least offensive to the senses. I'm rating this on style, not personal preference. But actually, I wouldn't turn one down if offered. If I go to Lonestar steakhouse for dinner, that's usually what I order. Even though I'm a beer snob, I still have a soft spot for an easy drinking american lager. This one fits the bill perfectly. Way underrated. And millions of Texans can't be wrong."

"I like this beer. It was never really available for me when I was younger since I was not living near Texas, at all. But I have grown to drink and love it. It's cheap which is so awesome. It's refreshing which is so awesome, again. It's great to drink all night and all day which is the best awesome. I get it when I can find it. I enjoy it when I get it. Lone Star is a Super Star beer!"

"Overall: On the positive side, it is cheap and no worse than other mass produced beers. The excessive sweetness can amplify the hangover. If you're visiting in Texas go for a Shiner instead."

"Pours a light/medium straw yellow in color with about a half of a finger white fizzy head that settles down quickly to just the sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of some basic grains. Nothing special really. The taste is about the same with a hint of sweet corn with a slight tart finish. Above average carbonation. Drinkable, but once again nothing really special."

"O: This beer seems to have a lot more drinkability compared to other adjunct lagers as it doesn't have any ""off"" flavors or skunk in the taste."
""
""
""
""

"Lone Star Beer is a refreshing and relatively flavorful American adjunct lager. All in all, definitely a notch or two better than most beers of this style."

"I mean...it is what it is. Had this at Atlantic Beer Garden in Boston. It's got a sweet but musty smell to it. A little dull. This hails as the ""National Beer of Texas"". Come on Texas, you can do better than that! I'd probably rather go with a PBR if this is the genre of beer that is called for."

"Avoid this beer."

"I had never had this one before and it is not available where I live, but on a trip through an adjacent state I stopped to pick up a few beers when I noticed this store had six packs of this stuff. I had listened to Texas musicians and others praise this stuff for so long I had made it a point to try at some time in my life, I did not realize it would be yesterday. Sometimes when you are not looking for something it just appears. Anyway, this beer was alright nothing to sing about, even though people have. This is more a novelty to me, but overall had it been the middle of summer and I was going to listen to some Texas troubadour sing about it it would fit the bill rather well. Anyway to the review, it smelled sweet and grainy and when I poured it in the glass it was a very pale yellow, almost colorless really. The taste did have a bite to it that I wasn't expecting but overall not bad, I could see myself drinking a few of these on a hot summer day while grilling out and listening to some good tunes. Like I said before it is what it is but Lone Star had a certain appeal which precipitated the purchase."

"O: Average. I have not had this in a looong time. Glad to see an old friend."
""
""
""

"Watching some live Spelunky action and downing some beers. Good times. This stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of relatively short-lived white foam. The nose comprises lightly-funky wheat, light hard water, and very light flowers. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some extra minerals in the water. The body is pretty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a watery feel. Overall, your basic, non-light adjunct lager. Not much to see (or taste) here, folks."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's not something I'd recommend unless maybe you're scrounging for quarters out of the back of your pickup truck."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and pairs relatively well with the smokey flavors and spices of BBQ. Could definitely be sessionable but would not be my first choice beer for it..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - It's an adjunct lager, and it doesn't really do much to differentiate itself from its competitors. I was able to finish the 12oz can thanks to the relative dearth of flavor, light body, and minimal alcohol, but it's not an experience I'm dying to repeat."
""
""
""
""
"O: Guess it's not totally fair since I tried an expired bottle. After trying 100+ Texas beers, I would say this beats Shiner's Ruby Redbird and that's about it. Well worth the money I spent."
""
""
"Being a avid craft beer drinker, you need to have a beer that you just have everyday. This is my beer just for that purpose. I've probably had every top notch beer made in the world, but this always sits in my fridge. Its a good cheap beer that does its job well, quenching my thirst after a long day of work. Then I will dig deeper into the fridge and pull out something else to sip on. Its good for what its worth."

"A somewhat tastier macro lager than the run of the mill, pale yellow with a fizzy white head that fizzles. Smell is beery for lack of a better descriptive and the flavor is grainy as can be. Ice cold it is quite refreshing, I wouldn't think about it much past that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is - well, crisp and malty, but lacking complexity. At least it smells like a beer, albeit an industrial brew. It pours a typical clear straw yellow, not much head. Flavor is - meh, a little malty, that’s all. I’ve had ""lite"" beers with more flavor. Texture is fizzy but rather watery. I had to try it, and at least now I know."
""
"The taste follows the nose. The barley and corn are detectable and typical of the adjunct lager taste. The hop flavor is mild. The body is light with plentiful carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a good beer. It's unoffensive and accomplishes what it sets out to do."

"Light bodied, plenty of carbonation, not much aftertaste. Not the best or worst adjunct lager I have tried. Nothing to get to excited about either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste followed the aroma. Flat, watery and lukewarm, this cup was like one of Proust's madeleines, taking me back my first encounter with beer, a keg of this at a family reunion as a grade-schooler in the late 70's. Some things haven't changed."

"O - Yeah its cheap macro beer but while in Texas on a hot day this beer hits the spot when its cold its refreshing and light enough to be pretty enjoyable a good everyday sort of beer that you don't have to think about just enjoy it"

"O: Overall glad to have another beer under my belt but would not seek this out again not the worst beer ever drank but slightly under the middle line."
"Take any weak BMC and put a Texas-proud label on it and there you go - Lone Star Beer. Poured a 3"" white soap suds head which faded fast. Standard clear pale straw yellow color. Almost no smell or taste but I suppose you could say it has a very weak grassiness to it. About as watery as they come. Everything is big in Texas, except this beer."
"Carbonation is pretty high for the style. Very prickly. Starts off pretty sweet and with a definite presence of corn. Fades into a finish with a vegetal taste and a little bit of grain helping to end the beer. Nothing amazing, but as others have noted, it does have a Pabst-like flavor. This makes it better than most adjunct lagers, but nothing exciting."
"Drink it cold, for as it warms up the flavor (what little there is to speak of) drops off. Completely."
"As mentioned, Lone Star is my go-to bar beer if I'm feeling frugal, other than that, I typically don't drink it. But that, by no means, should mean its a bad beer, just no where close to be the best, most exciting beer you'll ever have."
"As for the advertisements of this being the beer of Texas, I've never actually seen a Texan drink this, at least not in the Panhandle where the beer of up here is usually Coors Light or Shiner."
"6 pack of bottles was $5.99 VERY hard to find here. But worth a try."
"Verdict: I’m sad to say it, but Lone Star is a piss-poor representation of Texas beer. It’s has a bit more malt bite than most of it’s competition, but at the end of the day it’s just another in a sea of faceless beers in this style."
"O (D) - well It's better than I expected. I don't think it's very good. Attempting to review to style."
"Why is Lone Star made in Illinois these days?"
"One finger head of pure white, dense foam, which lasted less than a minute, leaving a few bits of lace on the side of the glass. Color is a 3 on the SRM beer color chart. Clear with lots of micro bubble action. Smell is of cereal grain and that is about it. Taste is not much there, flavors of corn, wheat and a touch of sweetness from the malt. Mouthfeel is almost water, save the zing from loads of carbonation. Cheap beer for days working in the yard, but there are a lot of those with more flavor and less cost."
"Smells like sweet corn and grain. However, sweetness does not jump out of the taste. It has high carbonation. It tastes like really cheap bread. It has an interesting bitter taste that is refreshingly different from the corn sweetness in most beers of this type. But still, it mostly just tastes like a mouthful of soggy off-brand bread."
"Overall Drinkability - This beer has no redeeming qualities other than the fact that it tastes like water, and it is conceivable that someone might want to get drunk while drinking water, so this would be the solution to that need."
"Pours a piss yellow with a decent amount of pure white head. The frothy head hangs around forever. Smells pretty bland. Some light maltiness and sweetness but no other smells. Tastes... blah. Not awful but really nothing to say. Its a bit thin and the corn is prominent but its fairly decent overall for the style"
"I had to try this at some point now that I live in Texas. It pretty much lived up to its reputation, which is a pretty poor beer."
"I guess it's greatest assest is, as somebody else already said, it's not an annoying beer. Drink 1 or 6...and well, it works well enough to quench your thirst."
"Mediocre. It offers no redeeming value and it will take you an entire 6 pack to feel a buzz. Lame."
"Lone Star is a yellowish brew with a little white head. The aroma, to the extent that you can detect it, is sweet with adjunct. More of the same on the light bodied palate. I believe corn is the culprit here. Very little bitterness to counteract the sweetness. As I drink more, the sweet residue builds producing almost a syrup-like coating of the mouth. Cloying appropriately sums this one up."
"As a Texas I want to point out that Lone Star even gets a bad rap in the lone star state, snobbishly looked down upon by Texans who prefer Bud and Miller (which I find pretty hilarious.) I started drinking Lone Star in high school, mostly due to its low price at the time, and it has become sort of a comfort beer for me. I know its not the best beer on the market, but if you want a cold one while mowing the yard in 100 degree Texas summers or to wash down brisket at a backyard barbecue, you cant go wrong with a Lone Star."
"Lone Dtar beer is another favorite of mine. Besides the little puzzles on the bottom of each bottle cap the beer isn't that bad. I was surprised that it is made by Pabst brewing. Lone Star has to be the best beer from this brewery, atleast by what I've had. The smell is not impressive but it is easily drinkabe. You can have quit a few without being annoyed by it. At has a little bitter bite toward the end of a drink. It tastes slightly hoppy and grainy. It is a step above bud light and Coors Light. Pretty good dud sud."
"Pours a light gold color with little head which dissipates quickly. Lacing doesn't stick around long either. Odor is faint but comes across as dry and grainy. Tastes like watery grains with a very slight hop bitterness. Not the worst brew I've ever had but far from the best."
"Not a bad looking beer. Not something to write home about, but not bad. Pours a golden yellow color with a nice white head that sticks around a moment, no lacing. Smells of corn and grass, and a little grain. Tastes of corn and sweet malts, a little hops, and some simple syrup or something. Mouthfeel is fairly thin. Drinkability is pretty average too."
"This beer is incredibly average at every level except I thought it was an excellent looking beer. The aroma is alright. It is a bit grassy, grainy and a little adjunct but no worse than other beers in this category. It has a brass colored body with good carbonation. A good white head and a little above average head. The flavor is mild and reminds me of the aroma with some malt and hops. The mouthfeel is light and easy to drink."
"This beer is way too carbonated. Drinks ok I guess."
"Overall, I was expecting something of a surprise when I initially bought this, became disappointed after I learned Pabst brews this, then was surprised again when it wasn't as bad as I initially thought after learning this was from Pabst."
"Overall it was just another in a lone of light lagers that just lack depth and profile. Not terrible, just uninteresting."
"Mouthfeel is very light and crisp with very high and champagne-like carbonation, and an extremely light body. Refreshing and easy to drink, it's watery and kind of boring, and overall an OK beer that's just very dull."
"I usually drink this straight out of a 16oz can which is the best way to have it in my opinion. It does not really matter how you drink it, it still won't taste good. For some oddball reason I tend to drink a lot of this whenever I'm in Texas."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some notes of corn. Taste is very mild, almost nothing to this beer. Maybe a touch of malts and corn. Feels light in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall other than for drinking games, this is a miss."
"Mouthfeel is a smooth light body that finishes clean. This is a beer for hot weather. Not just warm weather, hot weather. I'm talking about a heat index over 100 degrees."
"Drinkability - This is not bad at all for a semi-macro beer. There's nothing offensive in here, which is more than I can say for most AALs, and everything is in balance. Nice to finally get this here in SoCal."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer at all. Lets be honest they aren't trying to be the next hop bomb or coffeee stout. It is what it is. A simple american lager. I recommend getting these in cans and serving them extremely cold. Great beer for after mowing the lawn."
"Fuller bodied than I expected with a subtle dry hop presence up front that lingers throughout over the pale malt and sweet grainy corn notes into a long mettalic dry finish. This beer is about what I expected except fir mouthfeel and since it's 95 degrees here today I wS able to pound this down pretty quickly"
"RJT"
"Had this beer in the great state of Texas. The appearance is pale with a quickly dissipating white head. The smell and taste are not bad for an adjunct lager, but not really noticeable. What stands out about this beer is the smooth mouthfeel and drinkability."
"Lone Star is my favorite session beer and that's all that I expect from it, it isn't a bad beer at all."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"The CAN had homages to Stephen F. Austin, William B. Travis, The Alamo, and the words ""Since 1845"". It also read, ""Texas Born & Brewed""."
"D: Very bad to drink, maybe if you accompany any snack with it should be fine."
"M/D - Goes down about cheap vodka. Come to think about it, it's as drinkable as 9 dollar handles of vodka at the grocery store."
"Bottle- Pale, pa,e, sparkling gold with a short lived white fizz. Very faint aroma of pale malt and wet paper, a whiff of grains. Slightly sweet grain and vegetal flavour with strange bitterness and watery palate. Not offensive, just doesn't smell or taste like much. Because nothing says Texas like Wisconsin.Thanks David for the bottle!"
"Ordered a bottle with a bbq brisket sandwich at Soulfire BBQ in Allston. Poured into a pint glass. Clear yellow color. Fizzy body. Soapy head that quickly vanishes. Some lacing on the glass though. Smelled a bit skunky. Tasted was straight up macro. Loads of corn and other adjuncts. Kind of unappealing on the palate. Tastes like nothing, so it's only slightly more easy/enjoyable to drink than water. This is what you get from a $3 bottle of beer from Texas I guess."
"Had a bottle of this in Gruene TX. Poured from the bottle to a dark yellow with little white head or lacing. Very grainy nose, mouthfeel and taste. Short, non-descript finish that left me thirsty, but not for more. This beer really was not very good and I plan to avoid it in the future."
"This is a below average beer - can be refreshing after long day of yard work. Appearance is dismal yellow and unimpressive head nonexistent the bottle is where this should be drunk from - it improves the appearance greatly - the national beer of Texas. The smell is grainy if your lucky and skunkish if not. The taste is similar but of corn and sweet with little hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is on the thin side with okay carbonation. Drinkable on a hot day but there are better American Adjuncts - Grain Belt Premium, Pabst and Schlit. I wouldn't turn one down."
"D-- I just nailed 3 of these during the USC game, and was quite satisfied. Low ABV, plus great food and beer salt, make this very drinkable. I'll be done with the sixer before the 4th."
"This beer tastes like a mix of an american adjunct lager and a malt liquour. It has the normal pale yellow color, tinny smell, and watery mouthfeel. It is really only worth drinking once since it is the National Beer of Texas, but it does not taste very good and is not worth pouring into a glass. The flavor of the beer is bland with metalic undertones. Not my favorite beer for sure."
"As a beer, this is a macro-lager. There is nothing worth reporting on this other than that. If you are faced with the choice of this or a BMC, flip a coin because it does not matter."
"Mouthfeel isn't bad, but not even as good as from the bottle. It's pretty crisp with some smoothness. It's very thin and watery. Body is very light."
"Wow, that is pretty damn watery. Does not taste like much at all, nearly like a sparkling water with a very mild grain characteristic and a touch of alcohol. While this beer is not really that offensive when served very cold, it does very little for anyone with an appreciation for beer."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has a thin fizzy body. This beer is crisp and clean and boring. This is BMC by another name."
"Pours a yellowish color with no head to speak of. Smells like rice and corn. Tastes clean at first, goes down fairly easy. It's very carbonated. The faint flavor of grains comes through as it warms. Its not offensive, but who cares. This is better in the bottle. Still, at 1.50 a pint I cant blame it for being what it is. Good enough value beer."
"Edited to increase drinkability score. This stuff does go down like water."
"Now I know why I never sampled Lone Star from a pint glass before this review. The saving grace of this beer is the price and ultimately the picture puzzles beneath each cap. Lone Star winning 2 gold medals at GABF is beyond me."
"enjoyed it and i will buy it again."
"D: Ouch. This was one of only three Texas beers I could find near Bush Airport in Houston. The hotel bar had it on tap for $6.00. ($6.00?!? For Lone Star? Are these people nuts?) The convenience store across the street; however, had a bunch of single 16oz cans for a much more realistic price, so I grabbed one. Not my wisest investment. Even the special ""Limited Edition"" can didn't help."
"Had a case this past weekend- now Lone Star comes with a RED PULL TAB...with a little white Texas star on it!! How cool is that haha. This beer really isn't half bad. I guess its fresh cause the cans are new...maybe Lone Star will keep up the good work."
"Drinkability: For the style I think this is highly drinkable--certainly better that Coors/ Miller..There is a bit of sweetness which made this stand out. On my own scale, I would give this a D+/C-. It is however, an above average adjunct lager. I could certainly drink six or more if I was in a macro drinking mood."
"being from the capital city in texas lone star is around everywhere and for the most part can be found for 5.99 a six pack alot of times 4.99. all of my friends drink it in mass quantities because they are not beer snobs like me, also it is way cheap and tastes way better than other beers of its price range (busch, bud, coors, pbr all those types) also its claim to texas heritage gives it another flavor that most outside of texas could not describe. however since the company got bought a few years ago by pabst it has lost most of that appeal and i myself feel as if i have lost almost every attachment to this beer because of it. corporate america claims another"
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thin fizzy white head that quickly fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is average. It has a weak and watery pilsner malt and adjunct scent with little trace of hops anywhere. The taste is less than desirable. It's an adjunct loaded beer that's crisp and clean and devoid of any character. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with too much CO2. This is a one and done for me; nothing special."
"Had a couple while waiting around for a table at a restaurant last night. Clear and yellow with a fizzy head. Whaddya know? Its exactly what I was expecting. Not a lot in the nose, but the taste isn't offensive. This beer is fizzy and refreshing. Makes its name for being very cheap and very drinkable. There is a time and place for a beer like this. It is what it is."
"Pours an extremely fizzy, but extremely diminishing white head, like a soda. Body is a very clear amber yellow color, with lots of bubbles. Fruity sweet roma, some vegetable too. Lots of malts. Not very appealing. Some skunky sourness present too. Malty, nutty crisp taste. Not too bad, pretty refreshing. Very malty nuttiness."
"Certainly a drinkable beer that would probably be much better in the heat of the summer. I appreciate the brand association with Willie Nelson during the 70's, but at the end of the day this is an average brew."
"Taste sour and stale. Not pleasant at all. Served ice-cold which didnt help mask the taste. No aftertaste and very light. I will stick with the other American lager standards in the future."
"Surprisingly serviceable atmosphere, and a more complex flavor than I anticipated (given the price). Okay feel, but solid drinkability."
"Just terrible. Smells old, tastes flat. Pours a darker yellow with a short, bubbly head. Aroma of corn and dirt, not earth, dirt. Taste is sour and bitter, very metallic, and old. I only knew one guy that loved this beer. He was from Corsicana, TX. I later found out this was a dry town. Possibly to keep this beer away?"
"A local favorite, Lone Star is better than I thought it would be but can't touch the drinkability or flavor of the similar non-lights Heineken, Becks, or Shiner 99."
"This beer pours a clear amber with a 1/2 finger white head and no lacing. The smell is kind of sweet. The flavor has an ok malt base to it with no hops flavor, I would much prefer this beer to a bud or others but still hard for me to consume. Mouthfeel seems way undercarbonated and not the smoothest of beers. I could probably drink a few of these but my taste buds would certainly hold me back."
"Very cheap beer. I buy 6pack of 24 oz cans for $3.88."
"D: Not offensive, but there are definitely better macro options out there."
"These are readily available all over the Lone Star State. Is it a worthy flag bearer of Texas? Well.... Out of the can this one poured a bleached yellow with a thin white head. Minimal retention or lacing. The nose was cereal malt and pale malt with some lemony sourness. The flavors were washed out and similar, mostly pale malt with some lemon from the hops and a little bit of butter. Watery, light body and medium carbonation. This is a getting wasted at the lake kinda beer and nothing more. Let's be honest, it's really Pabst in the south. Love it or hate it, Texas deserves a better brew."
"Uses: I'd probably sell this beer to minors to teach them that underage drinking is bad"
"This is a local staple here in San Antonio, and as such, it is cheap and readily available. I prefer other light style beers, but Lone Star can do in a pinch, and did in this case. Not a bad value for your money"
"Not much to report. Not a horrible beer. One good for summer afternoons. I had one several years ago in Texas at the Big Texan Steakhouse."
"Overall good, I'd buy it again, but not for $15! Also there are some writings on the bottle caps."
"Drinkability: Could possibly be tolerable, but I'm definitely not digging that sour lemon taste."
"D: Drinkability was unimpressing. A struggle to finish and enjoy one sample let alone multiples. Would give this a big texas pass. Sorry."
"Pours a crystal clear light straw color with loose sudsy pure white head that dissipated into a sparse cap. Its lighter than most macros. The aroma faint; grainy and a corn like sweetness. The taste is of grain, artificial sweetner, adjuncts are very noticable, but the hops are not. Typical macro stuff here, doesn't really stand out, not that most do. The feel is light with fizzy carbonation. Finishes neutral, perhaps a touch on the sweet side. I drank it when cold so the drinkability was fine, wouldn't recommend letting it warm. Overall an ok macro, it doesn't unseat the High Life."
"overall, if i lived in texas i might get it every so often for tasks that require cheap beer, not the worst thing in the world but far from the best ;)"
"I would rate this at par with Miller High Life or Coors, even though where I get it (usually in 24oz cans) it sells for about half the price. If you are low on cash and want a buzz, go for it. Just make sure it's ice cold. Somehow it tastes slightly better in cans."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is decent. Slightly crisp. Drinkability is low due to its blandness and lack of flavor. Overall, it's not a good beer."
"How could I go to Texas and not at least try Lone Star? It met my expectations in that it really wasn't that good. It was a fairly typical macro lager. It poured a star-colored yellow with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. Smell was light a bit of malt, some corn, and that was about it. Taste followed suit. A bit of malts, corn, adjuncts most likely, and that was about it. Maybe a tiny hint of hops, but not much more. It was clean and crisp to drink though, and went down very smoothly. Still, I wouldn't exactly recommend drinking this, though, you'll find there are some places where it really is your only option."
"This beer poured a yellowish straw color with very little head. The smell was very subtle and hard to pin down. Perhaps some malts. The taste is mostly malt with bit of hops towards the end and an aftertaste that reminds me very much of malt liquor. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but not offensive. As far as a cheap beer goes, this seems to be pretty drinkable beer. I'm not sure I'd ever choose it, but I probably wouldn't turn it down."
"whether you love it or hate it, this one always has a home in my fridge to help through the hot Texas summers"
"Slight metallic, bitter smell and similar taste, except watered down too. Maybe some corn too. A very generic beer, without anything special going for it. Medium to high Carbonation, and somewhat refreshing ice cold, but not a great beer taste-wise obviously, and most people over 21 wont want this unless theyre on a budget. A very, very strict budget."
"Like any good macro, this beer isn't inherently offensive. It doesn't really resemble beer, but it was sweet and smooth enough. The flavor just tasted like malt-infused water in that it had a bland sweetness that didn't taste like any grains in particular. I kept trying to pull more flavors out of it, but it was to no avail. Will say, however, that if I was in Texas on a hot day and someone handed me a Lone Star, I'd drink it."
"No reason to drink this as there are many equally dull beers around"
"I grew up drinking Lone Star as a kid back in San Antone. Back then it was locally owned, locally brewed and a superior product to the current edition. I still like the smell and the after taste of Lone Star, but overall it's just not something I'd go out of my way to purchase. I had a friend come into town and bring me a case of long neck bottles. I'll certainly drink them all, probably with chili and or barbecue. It's not my favorite drink anymore, but it still reminds me of home. This is still a pretty good session brew, lower in alcohol than a lot of other lagers."
"This beer is a pale yellow-gold color with a thin and short-lasting white head. Specks of lacing on the glass. Mild aroma of hops and grainy malt. Light-bodied with an unappealing flavor profile of grain, corn and weak hops. The finish is moderately bitter and not very flavorful. Slight lingering grain flavor. Overall this beer doesnt know when to fold em."
"Drinkability - It would be easy to chug a sixer in under an hour (been there, done that... but I am not proud of it or anything...). I don't buy this type of beer anymore, but I would reach for it every time over any of the big 3 (i guess it is technically the big 2 now...) anyday. It is an easy drinking macro, but I just don't desire that type of thing."
"Drinkability: If you have to drink Lone Star for some reason, drink it out of the bottle and not from a glass. You don't want to waste your time scrubbing the hell out of your glass to get this beer out of your life. This is clearly an example of the saying ""you get what you pay for."" And for about $4 a six pack, you're not getting much."
""
"This one surprised me. I had 5 beers in my ""make your own"" 6'er and eyed the shelf looking for something I hadn't tried. This one jumped out and I stuck it in the 6th slot. I had little hope it would be much of anything. But I was surprised. A bit better than expected. As Macros go, Pabst is one that has a little bit more drinkability than others. So it's no surprise that this reminded me of its less expensive brother in terms of taste (or lack thereof) and complexity (or lack thereof). No, the gold color, the moderate head, the thin to moderate body and the bubbles all said ""bland"" when I saw it. But it actually tasted a bit better than that. And the mouthfeel was a bit more substantive than I thought it would be. All malt all the time (and some great Texas water, I assue), but one of those beers you could enjoy to wash down BBQ and go right back for another and another. Very smooth and unpretentious. And sometimes that's what you want in a beer."
"The taste is nothing special..big surprise. Weak malt character that's mostly sweet and sticky, hop character is very subdued. There's just some slight tartness that weakens the sweetness a tad but not enough for my liking. Blah. Once is enough for this one. Can't recommend."
"Described to me as the ""National beer of Texas"" by the bartender. Not everything is bigger in Texas!"
"Drinks pretty easy, I could 2-3 on a warm day, way better than BMC, a pleasant suprise; went well with my chopped beef bbq sandwich & jalapeno"
"Even in style, this is pretty bad, though not the worst. Still, why bother..."
"D - Not so good. As far as inexpensive American lagers go, I'd rather have a Stag or PBR."
"cheap too."
"¡Salud!"
"Pours straw in color. Frothy head,with little retention,and minimal lacing. Smell is grainy, and metalic. Body is thin,and carbonated. Taste like the smell has a nasty metalic edge.Grain flavored water maybe. I've tasted better from Pabst. This was not good."
"Overall a typical and unremarkable macro. Not much else to say here."
"Drinkability: ehhhh, didn't want another"
"Drinkability: an easy drinker by far. It's just a bit too boring for me though."
"Had this in a bottle today at Joe Tejas in NJ. This ber looks like it's probably going to get a better score out of me than it really deserves. Here's the thing, there's nothing to it. It smells like a very light beer, it astes like a very light beer. There's a decent amount of carbonation to it, not much in terms fo the head, a VERY basic nose. It goe down really easy and is super drinkable. I'd ather have this than a bud, if you're in the market for that sort of a beer,but here was nothing bad or offensive about it, it just doesn't have anything gret about it either."
"Drinkability: nothing about this beer makes this unique versus other macro lagers. Personally I did not enjoy it, but I am sure all the Texas marketing makes this popular in the lone star state."
"This was actually slightly better than what I expected. It's really nothing to write home about, but I'm sure they get lots of sales due to the big can. I'm reasonably sure this is contract brewed in Canada somewhere (forgot to check the can). Possibly Great Western who does PBR and Olympia around here. Possibly Sleeman who does it out east and would more likely have the canning line for these 710ml brutes. I'd drink this again, but I won't be running out the door to get some."
"Good American Lager. Not great. Not awfull. Fairly cheap. Clean aftertaste. Not as bad as many people think. It is worth its price. The most intresting part is how many times the bottle mentions Texas.""Dont mess with Texas"" "Serve Texas cold"" Texas bla bla. Oh well pretty decent beer."
"I drank this beer at a party and it was kind of watered down. People were drinking it thinking they were hard. I was like wtf? People think just because beer is cheap it must taste like crap. THis beer was pretty crisp. Not a lot too it though. There are beers at the same price that are better."
"drinkability = very high. this beer goes down easy and isn't too filling. it won't win any awards, but it's definitely one of the better american macros."
"Pure. Texan. Beer."
"Much better than expected, but I didn't expect much. Stands up well against the best macros. Oh, and the can is pretty too."
"**Note** As I am supposed to, I am reviewing this beer against its style. That is why it is scoring so high because this is probably one of the better macro brews."
"Actually, this isn't too bad. I would drink this again, especially if it were ice cold. I drank this little guy down in about 3 minutes. Much better than most domestic macro's. Sure, it's nothing exciting, but at this price point you're really looking for what's least offensive. Give it a try."
"Clear body, no head whatsoever. Smells faintly of grain, that's it. Taste is bland, watery, lightly grainy, very much like something you could envision Hank Hill, Dale Gribble, or Bill Dauterive drinking. Mouthfeel is fizzy and thin. I will pass on this, pretty bad."
"Not as bad as some macros, but nothing to love here. I'll happily sing the words to Red Steagall's ""Lone Star Beer & Bob Wills Music"" as lustily as any good Texan, but there's no reason I can see to ever drink another one of these."
"ALmost the same than Schafer, I do not know, but I think they are now belog to SABMiller, maybe they are still being free at some range. It was good, for a BBQ party, but since we do not got them in Mexico, it was booring, and annoying at the end. And I would have a lot to say about the can, but I prefeer not."
"I dont recommend seeking it out if you cant get it in your town but if youre ever in Texas and youre given a choice of BMC and theres Lone Star available, order one and enjoy the company youre with."
"The national beer of texas, the slogan of this beer give honour its name appearance and taste is good , smell low in the average, but easy drinkability and special for bbq and buddies meeting, in sunday, or soccer game with any snacks; very recommendable."
"Bottle obtained from the discount rack of a local liquor store. Pours like a ginger ale...with a tiny fizzy head of white carbonation that quickly settles to nothing. Appears crystal clear straw yellow with several streams of bubbles and many miscellaneous bubbles rising to the top. Smells of an oily hallertauer hop with a ting of saaz tiny zing. Malt sweet is nearly absent. Tastes of carbonation and sweet hop floral with a touch of honey. The carbonation flavor is a sting that lasts only a moment, the most of the flavor is the hops. It's rounded and oily floral in a way similar to hallertauer. Late is a malt sweet that somes across as honey, but then the hops make a return to dominate the aftertaste. Light body and highly carbonated. Simple and drinkable (once I swirled to get rid of the overbearing carbonation)...much better than I expected."
"Smell, average for yellow beers. Nothing distinctive. Average yellow color. Mouth was , average again. See where this review is going? It had average carbonation. Taste was grain belt. Period. You don't get more ordinary than this, but there was a metallic note in the end, probably from the water. I didn't think much of this brew, it lacks the special ""oomph"" that makes Falls taste just a little different. I could have had this and several other similar beers, and would be hard pressed to tell which is which. Plenty of other beers out there..."
"Lone Star is exactly what you expect from a bargain-priced adjunct lager. The color is pale yellow with a weak head. Aroma is sweet adjuncts and taste is about the same. The flavor has a notable cereal grain quality, with no attempts to hide the adjuncts. Fortunately, this doesn't have any nasty off-flavors and remains drinkable. You could probably buy worse at the price they sell Lone Star, but you could also do better by picking up some PBR, Stroh's, or Schlitz."
"This is the only beer I buy in a can. It is dirt cheap here in the lone star state and is my everyday beer. It is a great thirst quincher and good with a meal. It is the water of my beers. I always pour into a glass as I cannot be reduced to complete beer barbarism. It pours a one finger head that speeds away in two minutes. It is a medium yellow that leaves the faintest hints of lace on a glass giving away its cheap manufacture with a healthy dose of corn sugar. I enjoy a grainy flavor in any beer and that is fortunate because that is about all that can be detected in the taste and aroma of a lone star. There is an ample amount of carbonation but light on the malt which is why the head doesn't stick around long after poured. This is about as predictably macro in its characteristics as can be expected but there is nothing unpleasant here, just nothing to savour. Quite drinkable."
"¡Salud!"
"Your choice - but for me and the pig it's Lone Star born / brewed in Texas, as much part of Texan culture: rodeo, two-steppin, or The Alamo. Lone Star maintains its place in Texas lore by supporting todays Texan musicians, outdoorsmen and our friend, the armadillo. (humm. . . I have not seen an armadillo since I left Missouri and now Rich only drinks Bush nothing stays the same."
"So I'm at a Crawfish Boil/Rehearsal Dinner in Orange Texas where the only beers left were Miller and Bud Light. However, I found a case on a bench with this brew. After ""borrowing"" one, I thought this was the best choice of the night. Nothing real special, other than a nice after taste. Would not have had a chance to try this otherwise."
"After reading quite a few reviews, not to many people apparently like this beer. I personally thought it was great. I'd never heard of Lone Star before, especially in the state of Virginia. I bought one not too log ago, served in a bottle, and I gotta tell ya, I really liked it a lot. I think its a perfectly substitute for a Budweiser any day."
"Drinkability: Not quite what I remember, and at $6.99 a six-pack, definitely a rip off here. I thought this was a little better than this, but I could only stomach two, and half of a third is in front of me and I may just forget to finsh it. It may be that this is old. In Nebraska we have a pretty strong dislike for all things, Texan, and the three sixers that were on the shelf may be part of the original case the store got in stock."
"A typcial American lager. A smooth, light aroma of corn that is not unsimilar to Pabst, but a bit less overpowering. Pours out with medium light carbonation and a short lived head. Mildly rich golden colour. Refreshing flavor of a straight forward lager - a touch on the watery side, but none the less tolerable. This is supposed to be THE beer of Texas, and if that is so, I wouldn't mind living there all that much. Recommended for those who like macro-regional brews."
"Straw colored with a lumpy white head of tight bubbles. Aroma is corny, a little sweet. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but bubbles tingle the tongue. Flavor is also corny, a little biscuity, but not so far as to say malty (probably because there is little or no malt). Difficult to tell if there is a fine hop presence, or if it's just the tingle of the carbonation. Finishes pretty clean. Not too complex, but not offensive."
"This beer was cheap! I like that when I buy some beer. It tasted alot like Budweiser. Cheap beer is usually terrible, but this wasn't that bad. I drank a 6pack tonight and I'm glad that I did. I found out my girlfriend was ex-girlfriend had been f---ing me over with some metal-head kid, and i was depressed. The Lone Star solved my problems at least for a short period of time. I will buy it again when I am depressed and feeling suicidal. Thank you Lone Star."
"Bender Factor: This was cheap as hell on post. I would try it agin, just for S and G."
"Bottle. The stuff on the side which says ""Dont Mess With Texas!"" Thats so cool. The beer, unfortunately, is slightly unpleasant. Lots of stewed corn flavours. Yellowish appearance. Normal smell. A cheap lager. Fizz. Pasteurised. Mostly pointless."
"Lone Star (where is it brewed again?) is lackluster at best. I would hope that its brewers would either go back to the drawing board and come back with some decent beer or make every attempt to hide its origins, not trumpet them from the highest mountaintop."
"Stick to the summary of the beer at the top of the page and ""AVOID""."
"Drinkability - a good thirst quencher that offers nothing outside of a plain, easy-drinking beer, which is sometimes just what ya' need."
"I certainly have to give Pabst credit for remaining totally invisible with regard to this beer. The label is a monument to hyperbole of Texas mystique (not that I don't think Texas is a fine state, but enough is enough). The only brewery identification is ""Lone Star Brewing."" The beer - well, it's your basic, old-style slightly grainy yellow lager. Solid body, workmanlike in a rough around the edges sort of way. An okay thirst quencher. I had this in the airport at Dallas (waiting for a connection, I did what I could to spend the time), perhaps if the setting had been a bit more pleasant, I would have appreciated the beer more."
"My aunt sent me this from San Antonio. Had I known what I was facing, I'd have sent it right back. Thin, flat of flavor, and pretty much devoid of any real identity, the vegetal notes played too strong a role to allow the otherwise crisp emptiness to make this drinkable. It'd been in the back of the DBF for about a month, and I just kept putting off trying it. But she spent the shipping costs, so I was guilted into it. Silly me and my conscience."
"This irritates me. Lone Star was drinkable back in the day. It wasn't the greatest beer ever by a long shot, but it carried the state's nickname with some semblance of pride. No longer. Tip to visitors: put the Lone Star down and try something else. The state of Texas has plenty of better beers to offer."
"Not really terrible, just the same standard megabrew. Corny taste, some malt, very little hops. Slightly more complex than, say, a Coors, but otherwise just another cheap beer. I started undoing the screw tops to drop in a dried chile to test my chile beer recipes."
"ave"
"A crystal clear, straw gold body is capped by a frothy head of bright white foam that holds well and leaves some limited, but nice, lace. The aroma is welcoming with a sweet, grainy and lightly floral nose. The body is light-medium and it's quite crisp in the mouth. The flavor delivers a combination of sweet, semi-grainy malt and floral hops balanced by a low-key bitterness that's bolstered by it's crisp carbonation. Some sweet malt lingers in the aftertaste, but it's basically crisp and dry."
"I didn't have a bad experience with this brew, its just its like alot of others in the macro market. Brewed by the same folks that bring us pabst & stroh's, there isn't much more to expect. Its a straw colored lager that for me poured clear gold with a nice white head that laced all glass long. I thought the body was alittle fuller than the pabst. The aroma was grassy, the taste grainy and malt with very little hop to balance. It is drinkable because there isn't nothing big about this Texan. Picked it up vacation because it had that Texas only thing going for it."
"This beer pours an ultra-clear pale straw color with nearly no head to speak of. There is a massive amount of carb action racing to the top, but still no head. It has a sweet corn and a fresh-cut grass smell to it. The top of the taste is a carb bite that nearly burns like a Coke product and has a twangy lemon and earthy grain taste with hops nearly being uninvited to this ill-fated party. It is thin and watery and aside from that carb bite, it has no character. Could have been an easier drinking swill, but the bite burns so it takes away from the only thing this beer could have had going for it. Im embarrassed that this is called what it is. Cheers anyways!"
"Cheap beer meant to cool you down on a hot day. But, for it's price, I like it. In University, their was a roommate who watched ths weid show called Hot Springs Hotel. Mainly, Baywatch with nudity. Anyways, all the girls were drinking this. Funny how the mind works. I tasted this beer and thought of that stupid show. Now for the actual rating, instead of rambling. As a note, this is the Sleeman brew. Poured out a very faint, yellow colour. Kind of like sand. The head was about 1/2 and lasted, but was grey. A grey head is a turn off, especially considering I've never seen beer foam that shade of grey before. Light barley husk smell. That's it. Tasted a little sweet, malt and corn adjunct evident. But, it wasn't too artificial. Little mouthfeel and drinkable for what it is. Basically, swill. Tolerable swill, perhaps even good swill, but swill nonetheless. A lawnmower beer."
"Nuff said...hohum"
"Round up yer little doggies and bring 'em on over to the trough for some corn water. One of the great fizzy yellows so successful at the bank and not so successful in the tasting room, this is one of the pale yellow, white-headed beers that we admired in our youth. Typical macro lager with not much to offer but price and great advertising. Watch out for the corn silks!"
"This is the Budweiser of Texas...in fact it was founded by Adolphus Busch in 1883. Light straw yellow and light flavorless body. The seltzery texture is hardly distinguishable from the hop taste. Am I tasting hops or seltzer? Weak, dry and stale tasting with an odd stale aroma. The head disappears as quickly as the flavor. I don't think the defenders of the Alamo would approve. Prime example of Cheap Beer!"
"I like this stuff. Sure, it's not Olympia, but it's not bad. I thought I would try it, because I've had bros suggest it for a cheap thrill. Cheap? Kind of. $5 a sixer. It was the usual yellow color with a white head. The taste was very hoppy! No, not like a rabbit. Har har! The smell was hoppy too. Not much out of the ordinary for mouthfeel. I may come back to this rhinestone cowboy."
"I'm sure Texas has its strong points but beer sure doesn't seem to be one of them. On a recent visit to the northern suburbs of Houston I was forced to drink many a bad beer, this one included. The choices were the usual national macro swill and local macro swill. I went local but gained nothing for the experience. The same yellow fizzy crap that I associate with AB, Miller and Coors. Utterly lacking in taste and character. Texans apparently think of themselves as rugged individualists but their beer is wimpy."
"My suggestion is that if you follow the label and drink this ""Texas Cold"" and quickly, it is somewhat tolerable. I had to try this seeing how it is somewhat of a novelty seeing it in central NJ, but I won't be rushing to buy this one again."
"an every so slight step above stuff like bud and corona. looks and tasted watered down. no flavor or character here. not a very good beer, but if i have to suck back garbage on a hot summer day, i'd rather this than the afforementioned bud or corona."
"Worst Beer. EVER!"
"Lone Star, a beer that a lot of people in Texas drink each and every day, so Dont Mess With Texas!"""
"The nose is foul, stale, like cardboard and old gym socks. When fresh out of the refrigerator cold the flavors are subdued, mainly malt, the hops are absent. Awfully pale, light gold in color, artificial-looking white head disappeared rather fast. The adjuncts dont seem that out of control. Overall, really bland, simple no need to drink it again."
"Very pale in color. Pours with a dry white head which exits quickly. A very dry beer. Hop taste is strong, with a pronounced aftertaste. Faint hints of burnt corn. This is not bad for a cheap beer. Serve ice cold if possible."
"The beer pours a clear straw or gold color, the head is off white, average in size and the lace adequate. Nose is clean and crisp, dominated by the malts. Front is malt and somewhat sweet, the top thin, the finish is pertinently acidic, passably hopped, dry aftertaste. Beats dying of thirst, but just barely, not a beer I fancy."
"Clear yellow, a little darker than a Budweiser.  Ivory Dish Detergent head that doesn't last longer than a 15 second TV commercial.  An odd aroma that's similar to old socks.  The foot wear theme continues in the malt impression, other than that, corn syrup.  Typical macro hops, an afterthought.  Drink this stuff cold and thirsty, its unpleasant at warmer temperatures."
"A Texan beer, unfitting for Texas. Often seen empty cans in dead Armidillo's claws. An all right beer if you are very hot in Texas, but it still tastes like Armidillo urine. Or maybe El Paso runoff."
"Very clean! Virtually no aroma, very little taste, except for a dry american lager bite. Easy to drink! The bottle says ""serve Texas-cold"". OK...what is that?  Texas is damn hot, so I take it that this beer is supposed to be served ice-cold to cool you down. This beer is made to do one thing: cool you off. It doesn't stray from it's mission by trying to have any discernable beer ""character"".  Oh, yeah...the bottle also says ""don't mess with Texas""."
"Medium yellow in color with thin head. Crackery fresh tasting. Very crisp and average in flavor and mouthfeel.  Goes down very easily.  Tasty on a hot day with a big T-Bone!!"
"Package reviewed was a 16 oz can."
"This is my dad's favorite beer.  Poor bugger.  He can drink it all day long and seemingly never even get a mild buzz.  The best thing you can say about this beer is that it's cheap. Even better for me, it's always free at the folks' place.  It's always a choice of a Star or a Miller Lite... Lone Star gets the vote from me ... for what its worth."
"Pours a very light golden color with a carbonated white head that fizzles down to nothing in 5 seconds.  Slight malt and very slight hops on the nose.  Fizzy mouthfeel.  Not a lot of taste but no off-flavors of note either.  Decent for a macro.  Fairly drinkable."
"Are you guys kidding me?  Is this stuff really available outside of Texas?  Ugh!  We don't drink it down here, and I recommend you not drink it either, no matter where you are.  I wouldn't even water my office plants with Lone Star."
"Smells like a Bud, basically tastes like one too.  ""The National Beer of Texas"" is an oxymoron.  I think the abv is 5%."
"Don't be fooled by the implication that this a premium beer. This compares to any other swill, and it's not as good as some at that. Harsh and astringent flavor."
"Notes: Bland lager, same as any other macro brew in the US. No need to recommend this beer being that the big three in the US do a fine job of making beer just like this and selling it for less."
"Pours with a medium sized white head, a well carbonated beer.  Unfortunately that's the best thing about this beer.  Clear bright yellow color.  Smells slightly sour and cidery.  No skunk thanks to the low hopping rate and brown bottle.  Light body.  Not much flavor beyond some faint watery maltiness.  Finishes with a brief sour aftertaste.  There might be a hop in there but I couldn't find it.  Might be okay if you've just mowed an acre of lawn during a Texas summer and there's nothing else available."
"You;ve got to be kidding!!!!!!!!!!  I was in Austin, Texas a few years ago and a man walked up the the bar, the bartender asked if he wanted a beer.  He said, ""No, I'll have a Lone Star."""
"I remember drinking this when I was trying to get a 25oz mug at Bukowski's in Boston. We had to drink 99 beers. This was one of them. Everytime I went in there I would procrastinate, dreading the day that I would have to drink it. My thoughts were confirmed when I did. Hard to swallow and ultra-bland."
