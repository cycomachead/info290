For $6.99 a 12 pack it is hard to beat and much better than it's main competitor on the shelf Milwaukee's Best. This beer actually won some awards back in the day so give it a break and evaluate it for what it is.... a cheap American Style beer....","Andco924","May 20, 2014"

Look, this is just not a great beer...but, I had to go grab one and review it for a couple of reasons. (1) Takes me back to golfing with the boys in college, and (2) reminds me of my Grandfather, a man's man who took it to the Nazis back in '44 in a B-24, got shot down, and walked 200 miles to the Adriatic sea to be rescued.","Badger6","Feb 11, 2014"

2.35,1.3,2.25,2.25,2.5,2.25,2.25,"I typically wait to try mainstream American/Canadian adjunct lagers if they happen to show up at various social functions or restaurants where there are few other (better) beer options. Too fizzy and weak flavor-wise as a general rule, although these beers can be nostalgic and are great if you really are just in the mood to drink socially without constantly taking tasting notes or analyzing everything else going on with the brew. Old Milwaukee is very, very pale straw colored with the requisite level of mouth-numbing carbonation and white foam. Also classic is the muted, tenuous flavor profile and aroma. This example is corn-forward and fairly sweet, corn meal and boiled dough along with some subtle off-flavors (the sweetness tastes a bit artificial like aspartame) ... Chalky and dry body keeps the sweetness lower than in some other adjunct lagers but the corniness and cooked flavors do add a little nuance I suppose. Mellow and largely unoffensive.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 07, 2013"

There's a hint of hoppiness which is nice but there's a weird sweet/metalic flavor that just shouldn't be there. It's a little malty and is drinkable. The bad tastes that are there aren't overbearing, but that's probably because simply everything about this beer is not overbearing. It smells like someone spilled beer on your couch three days ago, but to it's credit it also smells crisp and grassy, like a corn field. Aftertaste is nonexistent, which is nice, because as bad as this beer is, at least it doesn't stick around.","cambabeer","Jun 19, 2013"

In my area old milwaukee is only carried in one grocery and offered in 6 pack tallboy form only. The appearance is light straw colored, paler than either schlitz or pabst (old swill owned by pabst, sub-brewed by miller) with large white head that fizzes away. Surprisingly some lacing is left in the glass. The smell is rather neutral to weak, generic grains is about it, nothing offensive but nothing of note. Taste is similar, a bit weak with slight bitter, a cardboard papery taste as well. Mouthfeel is crispy and dry, is drinkable. Overall old swill is superior to other budget brands like natty, keystone, busch, etc but schlitz gusto is way better for slightly higher price.","adjunctjonez","Apr 20, 2012"

And as obviously cheap as the flavour is, it's really just indescribably pleasant. It's hard to put into words. The ingredients just taste good and natural. It doesn't have any weird flavours you don't want in there like Budweiser, Coors, MGD, or any light beer. It's just a regular old, easy-drinking beer-man's beer. Well, impoverished beer man, anyway. This is quite possibly the best ADJUNCT lager I've ever had, not including higher alcohol brews like euro strong lagers. It may be the only adjunct lager I need to buy from now on, but I will keep trying new ones when I find them. This one is so damn cheap, though.","ElCommodoro","Apr 06, 2012"

Now on to the review. As expected, this beer pours a pale yellow color with a large one inch head that dissipated quickly. Aroma was very strong of corn/adjuncts along with a cooked vegetable smell. Not very good. Taste was slightly better as long as the beer was very cold. I could taste the ever present corny flavor with some malt character way in the backround. There was also a lemony/citrusy taste that was thirstquenching and pleasant in the 94 degree heat of the afternoon. Hop flavor was not present. The finish was very thin and watery in the mouth. As the beer warmed, I was unable to finish the can and had to dump it. Oh well. My memories will always be there, but I will not be drinking OM again.

As sick as it was I thought at the very least, due to the lack of flavor, I could drink it quickly and move on. However, a terrible, extremely bitter aftertaste followed, as if overcompensating for the original weak taste. Overall the taste was grainy with a hint of corn. The aroma was unappetizing. It had little frothy head to get in the way, and the color was a thicker yellow than most.

The body is extremely light and the finish mostly just bite. Okay, this has to be the most popular cheap beer that me and my friends used to pickup and what some of my older friends still try to bring over on occasion. If your going to go cheap, you might as well pick this over things like Miller.","Wildman","May 28, 2002"
1.33,-42.7,2,1.5,1,1.5,1.5,"This beer has a very strange aftertaste.  For some reason, that taste can best be described as ""tin"".  I believe it interracts with the can to form this taste.  A watery beverage, that to be honest, wasn't that good.  I think you must be over 60 to drink this beer as that is all I ever see buy it in the stores.","proc","Apr 25, 2002"
3.07,32.3,2.5,3,3,3,3.5,"old mil has a bit more body and character than typical mass produced lagers....it doesn't have that awful adjunt odor and has some malt body and a bit of restrained hop flavor...it goes down well and i'd rather drink it straight out of the bottle rather than pour it into a glass.  all that said.....reviewing american lagers is boring and more time should be spent pounding them rather than reviewing them so i'm off to do my duty.","budgood1","Feb 22, 2002"
1.06,-54.3,2,1,1,1,1,"Mineral and salty, with a harsh finish that passes for hops.  Tastes like some sort of medicine to clean out your colon (which is does pretty effectively, too).","Brent","Aug 24, 2001"
