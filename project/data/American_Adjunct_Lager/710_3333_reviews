"It's flavor almost could take it one step further, leaving just enough for you to want to keep drinking."

"A solid go to that has just a bit more than the average bear.  Tasty enough for a repeat or two."

"Another beer I remembered fondly from my youth that I decided to try again. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. A refreshing lager that would be great anytime."

"I think all of Leinenkugels' fruit beers are the same: fruity and delicious, but leave you wishing they had something more distinguishing than which fruit is in this particular beer you're drinking at that moment."

"Overall (3.37) : yeah, I'd drink it again. It's not the horse pee I remember it being, but it isn't really fantastic either. I'd say if you mixed Pabst and Miller High Life this is what you'd get. Dirty hop leaf, creamed corn, gritty finish."

"A bland lager with an odd, though mild, soapy undertone. Personally, if I had to choose, I would take Miller High Life over this. There are cheaper bland brews out there, too."

"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised after smelling it. Smell was definitely of a light struck beer, but the flavor of the beer was actually more full and malty."

"The feel is what can be expected. It's light=bodied with a firm crispness. Carboantion is moderate, not too heavy, which is nice. It's got a touch of smoothness in the body, too."

"Leinie's is a very good Northwoods brew. The brewery isn't that far from where I live either."

"Appears straw yellow, with a typical short-lived one finger head and bland sweet corn on weak grains aroma / flavor. Light watery body, but at least it is well carbonated. Really just barely a tiny step above any BMC you may encounter, but not quite better enough to justify the price tag IMO."
""
""
""
"The worst are the people paying $5 for these on Water Street at the Leinie lodge. No dude, you aren't totally into bad ass craft beer, its just a brand that was bought by Miller, please stop embarrasing yourself."
""

"O- We initially bought this and some 1960s Schlitz for a party we were attending where there'd be beer pong and flip cup. I preferred the Schlitz at the time (review forthcoming), but am surprised by how drinkable I find this compared to the PBR I had recently."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad for the style. Better than the BMC alternative."

"Lienenkugels Original pours a clear yellow with good carbonation that provides a bubblely white head...bot which dissipate overtime. Some lacing was present. The smell had sweet corn and light grain with balance hop. The taste followed suit....sweet corn, grain, hint of malt and hop with good finish. The mouthfeel was good and could be sessioned easily. Overall it is a fine american adjunct beer."
"Best of all is the free Native AmeriCAN female with every case, YMMV. Mine was on hand to assist with the Crack & Glug and she did a fine job, producing a finger-and-a-half of bubbly bone-white head with moderate retention that would make any Lodge member proud. Color was a golden-yellow that would have made either/both King Midas and Croesus proud. The nose would make any local pig farmer proud, given its distinct resemblance to silage. The mouthfeel would make any chemist proud, given its resemblance to CO2. The taste would make Greg Koch proud, since he revels in being able to measure his beers by using AALs as his yardstick. The finish would make a drain proud as it either came from one or belonged there. No, sorry, that last was too harsh, but I was at a loss. It was simply a standard AAL. I remain a proud member of the Leinie Lodge, but I have better beer to put in my cooler. Again, YMMV."
"OK, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"There's a good mouthfeel, excellent hop/malt balance, and good drinkability overall. The adjunct quality never detracts too much from the beer's better traits, and this is just about the right weight (at 4.6%) for several in one sitting, especially on a hot summer afternoon."
"Tried this on tap- in a plastic cup. Sorry I had no choice in the matter. This lager poured an almost clear yellow color with a thin white head. Head retention is poor and there was no lacing. The Aroma of the beer was malty and sweet. The taste was mostly sweet with slight hints of grain. I didnt pick up much of a hop flavor- this for sure was not triple hops brewed! Not very good- lawn mower beer at best."
"It's a nice golden color with plenty of fizz and a fat finger of foam. The aroma was light with corn or grain and some hops. The taste was some grain, fair amount of crispness. It's super drinkable with a small amount of the crispness remaining. It isn't complex, not very distinctive, but you can enjoy it bottle after bottle. This was the first bottle of Original I've seen in the DSM area so I hope to see more of it."
"D- Served cold, it's one of those beers that you can put back a couple in a sitting (as I've done with family during holiday evenings). Doing a formal review makes me see some of the mediocre (if not flawed) aspects of this beer. It's a good BMC substitute."
"It is quite bubbly in the mouth, a bit too much actually. The body is also quite light. Not wretched like some Adjuncts, yet-- unless you have some non BA buddies and it is on sale-- it is undrinkable."
"Substandard adjunct lager. Is there anything else to say? It's sweet pale malt which fades into watery grainy nothingness with maybe a hop or two peeking through, it's light-bodied and I drank one over two hours of talking to somebody about how bad the job market is. Which is usually a three-beer conversation."
"I do not think these are all that similar to each other. My brother in a law is a Miller Light drinker who love Yuengling on vacation. I'm not surprised he liked Leinenkugels more, it is more like Miller Light to me."
"D: I find this to be a good, drinkable beer for the style, one that is easy to put down and does make me want to have more (not that I could say that about most Adjuncts). Great in cans and represents the style in good fashion."
"Ah, fishing in northern Wisconsin...the perfect opportunity to enjoy more Leinies than in any other situation. Get some. This ""original"" pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of very quickly-dying white foam. The nose comprises corn, corn syrup, brown rice, and what the group collectively agreed was a mixture of taco seasoning and Jacob Leinenkugel's sweat and tears (no word on what happened to the blood, though...Count Yorga (or Iorga, to some) is a suspect). The other cans didn't really smell this way, nor did this odor come out of the can itself; we believe the snifter (clean, by the way) brought out some hidden smells. Something like that. Regardless, it smelled pretty damn awful. The taste mirrored the smell, minus that noxious second half of pain, though some tin and hard water seeped their way into the rice and corn syrup. The body is very light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, not the best of choices for fermented enjoyment, but the price and source are right for downing some brews on a boat while attempting to catch some fish."
"This was the main beer consumed on guys weekend. Appropriately it was in the Northwoods of Wisconsin, just like this brew was intended to be enjoyed. The appearance as expected is a pale straw color with light head on it. The smell makes me think I shouldn't have poured it into a glass. It smells of corn syrup and stale hops (or some other foul off smell). It's rather sharp on the nose. The taste has a slight bitterness to it which seems ok for a pale lager that it is other than that it tastes similar to the smell, just a little less foul. Bitterness seems to come from the corn syrup but there is some malt and maybe honey in it. That makes it surprisingly a lot smoother than I expected. I will consume a lot of this so I hope it's as drinkable as I think it is."
"Good mouthfeel here and I find this very drinkable. The Original just showed up in town and I quite favour it for further sessions."
"M/D: Light body. Pretty thin and watery. Carbonation is on the higher side. Pretty easy drinking though. Probably would be one of my top adjunct lager choices, especially being pretty local."
"Overall, this is a macro I can drink without grimacing. That's what I mean when I say best AAL."
"This has been my old man's brand forever. I have good memories of sneaking them from the garage fridge growing up. Pours a clear golden yellow with not any head retention to speak of. Just drink it from the can and you don't have to care what it looks like. Not much in the way of smell, some light grainy corn but not much else. Absolutly nothing great about it, but to quote Wendell ""It's good honest beer."" Nice crisp coarbonation, very drinkable. Just a normal yellow beer from a can. Nothing wrong with that."
"Taste is grainy malts that taste and feel a bit stale and cardboardy. Very light tasting beer and certainly corn oriented. A bit too much fruitiness shows through for a lager - green apples and grapes. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and carbonation is not that high for the style. Not too much to get excited about, but I would choose this over a bud light anyday. 12 pack for 10 bucks...I might do that every once in a while. For an adjunct lager, one could do worse."
"D - I'm sure many of us from Wisconsin all have stories of wild nights drinking with this beer. In Wisconsin this has a bigger following than Miller in my opinion and it's quite enjoyable in just about any experience. The smooth, clean body makes it drinkable at just about any time or occasion."
"Cheers!"
"Not much to this one. As much as I had heard profess to liking ""Leiny", I was expecting more from this. Pours a pale yellow with little white head and not much lacing. Aroma is muted and what is present is grainy hops. Mouthfeel is pretty lackluster and the taste follows the nose. Short, dry finish rounds out this ho-hum beer."
"Leine's, if you're reading this, please make less of this, and more Big Eddy RIS. PLEASE. I'm begging you. You have proven you can make phenomenal beers -- If you want to."
"D-Appropriate for enjoyment while in the northwoods, as all of their ads now display. Leinie's is an odd duck. Original is a classic ""dad's beer"" in the region, holding a pretty loyal following of life-long Leinenkugel fans. The company seems to be somewhat straying from this thread (possibly under the influence of MillerSAB, 49% owner of the company), but while they continue to make Original, I'll continue to drink it."
"D- It could be pretty easy to drink this stuff, the ABV is relatively low and it's not an overall bad beer. I probably wouldn't buy it again however."
"A pale golden yellow color with a fizzy white head, high carbonation. Aroma is slightly grainy and hoppy for a pale lager. Flavor is crisp , and again quite hoppy fore a pale Lager , nice crisp mouthfeel , light body and quite refreshing , very sessionable , I might buy this again for company"
"D - It's beer. Not fantastic and definitely not bad for a lawnmower brew. I enjoy it from time to time and would never pass up the opportunity to consume one...especially for free."
"Drinkability: A simple, easy-drinking lager that, while dull, thankfully doesn't come across as packed to the hilt with adjuncts as many others do."
"Drinkability - decent drinkability. Not bad at all."
"D: Good amount of carbonation and the right mouthfeel, though not much in the way of taste. Although I'm not a big fan of Leinie's to start with, this definitely is not one of their better offerings."
"Poured from a can into a pint glass this brew is a light straw color with minimal head. The aroma is mild with hints of corn, malt, and some alcohol. The taste is a little metallic, and the carbonation is a little much for the light flavor. For a ""local"" competitor to the Miller empire it is a good beer, but doesn't strike me as impressive on the whole."
"D - Very light flavor and clean finish. Definitely a summer beer, but the lack of flavor will keep me from returning to this. I know its an adjunct lager, but IMO there are other adjunct lagers out there with more flavor than this one."
"D: Good taste and easily drinkable, great go to beer."
"Notes: not that familiar with adjunct beers. probly would go cheaper for a big name lager than drink this. i appreciate what its trying to accomplish, but if the name on the label says anything to me, there are much better adjunt lagers out there"
"Drinkability: It's not horrible, but it's not all that great either. Perhaps my standards are too high? When I think lager, I think a crisp, memorable flash of a moment. What I get here is a brief walk-by. Better than some beers, but worse than those beers I respect."
"D - It's a Wisconsin staple and comes in at a step above BMC. You really can't go wrong with this as a lawnmower beer, or to wash down some summer food."
"A Nice Retention for a lager. Slightly metalic(It was a Can). It is a very drinkable beer, cant beat the price in NW Wisconsin (>14 for case). A lot of bashers on this beer, but it seems that most are lager haters, For the most part I dont like them, but this a better example than most."
"Pours a sparkling clear, straw-colored lager with a small, frothy, white head. Good retention and decent lacing. Malty and citrusy aroma and flavor. Well-balanced. A whisper of canned corn in the flavor. Medium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, crisp, clean finish. Pretty much a staple in northern Wisconsin."
"Thanks to my cousin Pete for bringing a 6er of this Midwest classic for Christmas. First off this beer gets an A for appearance. It's about the only macro lager I've found that actually has head retention and lacing. The aroma and flavor have a clean, cooked corn/DMS character with toasted grains. Smooth, only a slight barley aftertaste, very drinkable. This beer is to the American adjunct lager, what Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is to American pale ales."
"Not bad for the style. A macro lager with a surprising amount of honey. More hops would be appreciated in the finish."
"Boring stuff. I don't know why anyone would pay premium price for this stuff."
"My rating is based on the style, this beer is about the 2nd or 3rd best I have ever had of the style. (well above your average BMC). In the world of beer as whole I would say this is a C- or C."
"Overall, this is an upgraded macro lager. Not something I would buy again, unless I got into lagers."
"Maybe its the fact that it's brewed close to home, or maybe it's because it was one of my fathers favorite brews. Something about it just reminds me of home and the midwest and puts a smile on my face. Its like an old friend with good memories."
"Drinkability: It was OK but I could get something better cheaper."
"""I really felt like picking up a simple lager or pilsner, something easy to quench my palate. Came across this and being a fan of Leinenkugel's I grabbed a sixer. Rich golden color in my pils glas nice frothy white head and steady carbonation along with moderate lacing. Aroma is pleasant and crisp but doesn't have much depth. Outstanding flavor for a generally boring style malty and full with just the right amount of hops. The taste is extremely clean well balanced. Surprisingly full mouthfeel with a wonderful crispness. Easy but well crafted, one of my new favorite pale lagers."
"Poured from a can. Straw yellow color with a small white head that quickly settles to a thin layer of foam. A little lacing is left on the glass. Immediately after the pour, I was able to pick up a nice Noble hop aroma but it soon is overpowered by adjunct aromas. As far as taste it is about average for macro's. More on the drier side with light hop flavor. Finishes crisp and clean. Light body with fizzy carbonation. A decent macro and a good thirst quencher."
"D- Easy to drink just nothing special going on here."
"Good lawnmower brew and probably the best of the macros to me."
"Bright, clear light golden-colored body with a foamy off-white head. Moderate retention, little lacing. The nose is a little more hopped than I expected though not strongly so, with decent malt lurking. Nice if straightforward taste, bittersweet hops emerge, somewhat sweet malt but not like gutter macros such as Genessee or Grain Belt. This is slightly more balanced than that, thankfully. Thin texture, not unexpected, but smooth. A fairly good accompaniment with my wings, Original doesn't compare to Sunset Wheat which is far superior. Still, not all bad."
"Leinie's Original is the best yard beer I can imagine. Based on a complex algorithm I cannot explain here, it's taste per yen is out of this world. It's actually cheaper than other Miller macroswill, which is amazing considering how much better this beer is than the rest of its competition. It pours a yellow/light gold with a very grainy aroma. It's considerably full bodied for its kind. Original brings to mind a Sam Adams Boston Lager, which may seem like blasphemy to some. For less than $7 a 12er, you can do a lot worse."
"Average boring lager with a slightly bitter, grainy bite that lingers. Really not much else to say about this beer. They brew a Light in cans which I don't mind taking along on hot days out in the boat as a nice thirst quencher however."
"This is a bit over priced for what it is, and that's an average macro lager. It is a clear straw color with a lacking whitish head. The nose and taste are both light and grainy. A watery body has a bit too much carbonation. Not the most drinkable due to a lingering bitter presence."
"Heard so much about this beer for years -- yet it isn't anything that special. OK to bring to a party and toss a few in with all the other stuff just to be different, I guess."
"This beer pours a clear straw color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of very faint malt. The taste is of corn, malt, and more corn and metal in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is an awful beer. The taste is a look more bold than other macro lagers, but it is so metallic and corny that it is undrinkable."
"A regional version of an American macrolager. Pale gold and with a thick white head, as is typical for all these beers. Aroma? Nothing special. The smell anticipates the taste. You can tell it is a beer. The high carbonation puts an unpleasant burning bite to the taste, so I found this more palatable as it sits a little."
"Drinkability: If it was a choice between this and a bud, miller, or coors product, I would definitely choose this leinenkugals original. It has a bit more body that typical macros and is refreshing."
"drinkability is great, because this brew is devoid of any boldness or character that could make it worthwhile (and less drinkable)."
"I'm not a macro basher, I drink Grain Belt Premium on a regular basis and have some Miller High Life in my beer fridge right now, but this stuff was awful. The only worse beer I have had is Beer 30 Ice (yes, that is actually the name of the beer)."
"The taste, not to bold, but the citric shows itself over a malty base with a slight hop dryness toward the finish. Not big on alcohol, so a good session brew indeed."
"I poured my Leinie into a frosted mug and it poured a light golden color with a one finger white head and a fair amount of lacing. The first whiff was great with a slight citrus scent. This brew has excellent mouth feel and a great finish. This is the kind of brew that you can drink all day long, a great session beer. I was well rewarded for my wait, I'll definitely be on the hunt for more of these."
"Mouthfeel was medium to light in body. Zesty carbonation. Slightly slick."
"Pours a pale yellow color and is a little cloudy. A thin lace of head is left also. Smells like every other macro lager out there, except a little more sweet. Taste is average average for a macro lager and has a slightly fruity and sweet flavor to it, which makes it stand out. Goes down smooth with a little crispness also. This is a decent macro brew that is a step above AB macros. Might make an ok session beer."
"D: Good session beer that I would much rather drink than BMC."
"Drinks okay, a bit too cloying as this warms. Drink ice cold. I'd still take this over BMC"
"Original is not a bad beer but there are so many more out there with a lot more to offer."
"absolutely unremarkable beer. not offensive but no real reason to drink it either, unless the other options are from the coors family of beers. drinkable enough, i suppose. this was brought to a dinner at my house, so i'm not sure how much it costs, but hopefully not too much. if it is cheap then it might be a good value over the major macro pilsner type brews."
"Another old stand by. A very good beer for Wisconsin traditionalists. A little more true to form of a classic pilsner than some of the other macros, but this beer is barely a macro. Easy to find and cheap in the Great Lakes area. Good choice if you are having a crowd over and want a little selection for low price."
"D - This isn't great but it is drinkable. This beer truly is far better poured from a bottle than from a can."
"So - the ""original."" A title I always fear, as it gives me the feeling I'm about to taste a beer that's not made itself any more substantial since the days of prohibition. Nevertheless, I'm very glad I checked out some of the other reviews before writing this. It seems that some of my peers had a good approach: rather than trying to hold it up against the finest, most sophisticated ales the craft brew industry has to offer, judge it for what it really is: a plain old American macro pilsner; and (in light of that, I can recognize), not a bad one at that. Pale, weak and straw-colored in appearance, with a rapidly disappearing head, and a smell that is nearly non-existent. Yet, there is some flavor there, and it is undeniably refreshing. It's not at all brackish like its big brothers from Milwaukee & St. Louis, and even has a pleasantly little tart taste and not at all disagreeable finish. It's watery, no doubt, and won't be making me forget a Sam Adams Boston Lager any time soon. But as to the four I ended up with after a potluck summer gathering with coworkers - well, I will drink them and enjoy them."
"7.99 6 PACK"
"Basically, if I want a cheap session beer, or am at a bar with friends and want to split a pitcher with people who don't like more complex beers, this is always the way I go. In Wisconsin it's no more expensive than Miller, but it's much, much better. I can drink this beer without thinking ""why am I bothering to drink this?"""
""
"I'd put this in the same league as PBR. Easy drinking, no negative effects, and it tastes good even if it ain't great."
"Overall, It's a good cheap american lager, but nothing more. Nothing more."
"If you can get a macro drinker to devote him or herself to Leinie's original, you've done good in the world."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and easy to drink. I don't really want anymore. There are too many other good session beers out there to choose this. Overall, not impressive. It's a step above most macro lagers, but not enough to win distinction honors."
"D-High. This is a good everyday lager. Nothing offensive at all, also nothing very distinctive either but overall a nice beer to keep stocked in the fridge when you dont want anything to sophisticated just a nice refreshing ""cold beer""."
"overall this is not a beer that i would really recommend, i think that miller brewing company has taken this over and changed it way too much"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a golden-yellow color with a slight soapy looking head that quickly dies down to just bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Smell is sweet with malt and has only the slightest presence of hops - smells like most macro lagers. The taste has a grainy malt consistancy with a slightly bitter finish and more grain to follow for the aftertaste; dry finish. The body is light and isn't as carbonated as I had expected. This is a drinkable beer, but an average lager at best."
"The can cracks with a quick hiss and pours a clear yellow-gold body beneath a bright white head that exhibits just slightly better than average retention and lacing. It maintains a thin but solid surface covering. The nose is generic lager with a sweetish malt, lightly grassy hops, and yeasty sulphur. It's medium bodied, gently crisp, and then smooth across the palate. The flavor follows the aroma: malt, hops, restrained but balancing bitterness. Dry, grassy finish. Thank God this beer has some character!!! It reminded me of the Schlitz my parents gave me as a kid - a beer with hops, not like most of the mass-produced swill available these days."
"D - On sale for $10 a case, can't go wrong. Miller F'ed it up though."
"Combined with 3 varieties of pale malts and cluster hops this traditonal american lager pours a rich golden colour with a crisp clean taste and great drinkability, for being a light lager it sure tastes like an original german lager because of the traditional brewing process so I say I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys a good lager."
"As I reflect, this is a version of style that has some flavor and some complexity. I'd guess that's why I preferred this one long ago (any maybe why others often didn't - image and low flavor were preferred I suppose). It does have a heavier sourness than many, and I would think that would be a turn off, but I don't mind it and I could easily find a place for this drink in the right environment."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y"
" Although I thank my father for hooking me up with this beer, I can't say i'd reccomend this to anyone but budweiser and Miller fans. Cheers"
"This is the ""original"" of Leinenkugel's options, they should call it ""unoriginal"" as it reminds me of a beer you can buy anywhere, in any town, at any store."
"We all know where this went. I got the Leinies. It wasn't bad, in fact, for what it is, it's quite good. I didn't expect much, and the foamy tap delivered. A nice yellow color, very fizzy, could toss them back like water. Didn't think I was drinking anything alcoholic. But, hey--beer flavored water is better than nothin'. I guess the only shock was how many of the people at the wedding got plastered from these. If you compare these to BMC--it's got better flavor, appearance and smell, but it's not what a good lager could be."
"Drinkability- I could definately have a couple"
"Pours a clear pale yellow with a white foamy head. Stale malt aroma combined with hops. Smells of lake water.... ugh. The mouthfeel is thin to just slightly medium in body. It's gritty and fizzy. Light hop bitterness with a soft malt presence. Some grain sweetness rolls back toward the front after the finish. By no means is this a great beer, but surprisingly less offensive than I expected."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and lightly carbonated. Although this lacks the crispness desirable in the style, I'd say its one of the better macros I've had simply because the elements of beer are actually recognizable in it and adjucts seem to be used sparingly, if at all."
"Drinkability: A damn fine macro lager brewed by a smaller (regional?) brewery. Purchased a six pack for $4.99, I will definitely be getting more Leinenkugel's products in the future. I had forgotten that these are good inexpensive beers."
"Beer pours a clear golden color with a foamy head that goes away and leaves decent lacing. Smell is mostly of a macro, but seems to have something slightly more to it. Taste has a slight sweetness to it, almost like a very light crisp honey. Taste is better than the average macro, but I can't bring myself to bringing it above average just because it is better than an average macro. Mouthfeel is alright, not great. Drinkability, I could put back a few of these no problem."
"This beer pours an average clear gold macro color. The smell is also average, just like any other macro, plain malts and hops. The taste is okay, pretty good for an Amercan Macro. Nice cereal malts and and pretty good hops, though slightly overpowering, with no crappy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is really good. It isn't very watery at all and it doesn't leave anything any your mouth. Strong for the average macro but it is quite drinkable so I have no problem pounding them down. This is easily the best American Macro Lager I have had yet."
"If you like Light beers, this one might suit you. It's not for me."
"Also, Leinie's O has something that most other beers of its flavour class do not: price. This is a great bang for your buck! Cheap AND tastey? Too bad I drank too much of it."
"This beer has a clear, slightly dark yellow color with a fizzy head that quickly vanishes. Boring aroma, no different from just about any macro. The flavor is tolerable. Not as watery as most macros, and you can actually taste some malt. The finish is nice and bitter. This beer works alright for what it is. I enjoyed a few pitchers while out at a bar with some friends."
"Drinkability: Its satisfying and I do miss it having moved out of its distribution area"
"Im starting to find the Leinie brands a little more fun than I thought. This is kind of corny, but not overly sweet like most cheap beers, and there is a bit of hop bitterness. Actually much better than most the usual mega lagers. Slightly darker than expected. A nice sweet malty taste. Still falls into the ""Oo-oo-ooh, hops are too scary for me"" territory, but basically okay."
"Drinkability - Pretty solid for an american macro lager. Straight-forward unchallenging lager, but at least this has beer characteristics. Certainly not a recipe worth saving for 5 generations."
"This isn't a beer I'd reccomend to friends or family. It is your typical ""It needs to be near frozen to tolerate"". I traded this from my father for a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA so he can see what good beer is. It is a standard yellow color, decent head. Taste and smells of malts, if you've had one macro brew you've had them all. The mouthfeel is very sharp with the carbonation. Drinkabilty would only get bumped up a notch or two if you had already had a few beers, then it becomes almost tasteless. Is it the worst beer I've ever had, far from it. But I wouldn't run out and buy this."
"Below average beer overall. The appearance is that of a cheap lawnmower beer, with aromas that aren't far away. The mouthfeel is somewhat better than a prototypical run of the mill American Lager but that is ruined by a watery after taste. The beer is drinkable, I would have no problem drinking a six pack at a party, but after a few sips you forget you are drinking anything at all."
"Sampled at Casey's Inn in Egg Harbor, Wisconsin. 12 ounce bottle purchased for $2.50 in this tourist town. Came out of the bottle with aclear gold color and a fizzy light head. Nose very neutral but some grass and malt in the nose. Buttery grassy flavor then a long for style finish. Very drinkable."
"Appearance is clear golden with a generous head of foam, but leaves little lace. Aroma is lacking in hops, some sweetish malt, grain and little else. Initial taste is mild malt, almost sweet, and then plunges into nasty. Body is watery, not enough carbonation, and finish is a non-event. Pass."
"The color is a pale golden shade with some light carbonation bubbling up from the bottom of the glass. Head size is average with some decent retention. The aroma is a one-dimensional attack of standard sweet adjunct lager. The taste is pretty good for this style, it seems they used a larger amount of malt than expected. The flavor starts nicely with sweet malts, but soon adjunct taste makes itself known. Luckily the malt flavor hangs in there just enough to keep this from entering Miller/Bud/Coors territory. Plus a little saaz-like hop zest is an unexpected treat. This definently fares well with it's style, but still isn't that interesting. I could definently think of many worse choices to wash down a burger or some wings. If this were cheaper around here, this would probably show up in my fridge from time to time."
"Leinenkugel's Original Lager is, I presume, the first beer that this brewery ever produced. I wonder if it was better back in the day. That is, prior to being dumbed down by virtue of its acquisition by Miller. It's difficult to say since I haven't had a High Life in a while, but I'd put it somewhere in that beer's league, taste and quality-wise. Drinkable when cold? Yes. Desirable? Definitely not."
"The aroma is quite sweet, but what you expect from the style, nothing offensive. Clean taste, a bit grain or grassy. Again nothing offensive. Good carbonation, medium body, a bit watery. Very average."
"Drinkability/notes: Quite decent, nothing special, but very drinkable."
"Overall Impression: A light tasting beer. Minor adjunct flavors noted but overall just a bit watery. Nothing wrong, nothing right really either. Pretty dead on for style."
"Drinkability is below average, even for the style. As far as adjunct lagers, it's not quite as good as it's local peers in the same category, namely Berghoff or Point."
"Ugh, the epitome of Midwest corn beers. It is actually worse than I remembered. It looks like normal macro swill and it sure tastes like half of Iowa's corn is in the beer. If it wasn't for the overpowering corn taste it would at least be drinkable. Note to self... Avoid this beer!"
"Very pale, very clear light, light golden tone. Decent sized white head on top that has some retention. Carbonation looks to be minimal from the appearance. Only sporadic bubbles make their way up. This beer's got a cereal graininess to it on the nose. And some light barley notes as well. Overall, it's a very faint nose however. The beer is a little on the flat side...not totally, but definitely not carbonated the way an American Style Adjunct Lager should be. The taste is quite subdued. Nothing off about it. (Is there ever with the Big Macros??) But nothing on about it either. Light sprinkles of grainy maltiness blend with a bland cereal note. I just had Milwaukee's Best and prefered that to this."
"Mouthfeel is watery thin. Basically the consistency of carbonated water...not my cup 'o tea. Drinkability is decent....I could see this going down on a hot summer day...but it's definetly not something I would seek out."
"I'll have to make this one fast because I'm dialing long distance just to connect to the Internet! Essentially, Lienie's Original is an okay beer. I don't think I've ever had this sort of lager before, so it's hard for me to judge this beer based its peers. I will say, though, that it tasted like a pale ale or a ""relaxed"" porter (less abrupt flavor but similar palette complexity) - certainly not something I expected from a lager. Pours absolutely crystal clear and golden in color. A considerable white head forms but fades in about one minute to a few lacy remnants. Smell and taste both had noticable sweetness. Regardless, I felt this beer left something to be desired. A rose by any other name may smell as sweet, but a lager that tastes like a concealed porter and goes down like water ultimately fails at mimicing any of the three. Oh well, it's good enough to finish the four I've got, but I think I'll have to go back to stouts for a while to set myself straight."
"This beer is probably my least favorite out of all of Leinie's endless array of subpar offerings."
"Sampled at the Miller Factory in Milwaukee."
"Clear gold color, moderate white head. Smells of grassy malt, a little stronger than your average macro offering. Taste is very full of malt and a hint of corn, but, unlike the macros, has a definite hops presence. Pretty good for an average priced lager."
"Leinenkugel's Original. A basic macro brew. Good color for a pale lager, golden and not too watery looking. Small white head tha dissapates quickly, fairly high carbonation. Taste is fuller than any of the big three's main beers. A hint of corn but not overpowering. Mouthfeel is fizzy but refreshing. This is a drinkable beer. I'd take it over the big three (but it is a Miller owned product). Personally I'll usually drink grain belt if I want this style (Schell vs. Miller, MN vs WI, easy choice for me)"
"A decent session beer and maybe the best leinenkugel product."
"Overall this is no world beater, but it isn't horrible either...middle of the road American lager I'd drink over Bud, Busch, Old Mil (despite the fact they some how keep winning awards)...Perhaps the best of the Leinie bunch..."
"Definitely a beer that I was not impressed with as it lacks character and there was not much going on with it.It poured a medium white creamy head with fine sized bubbles that mostly dissipated.The body was cloudy with a lot of lively carbonation.The hue was gold and there was very little lacing.The nose was hoppy and slightly sweet with a slightly bitter flavor.The mouthfeel was tingly and light bodied."
"ng"
"Once again, a beer happy in its mediocrity. Pale straw, adequate carbonation and head, flavor is slightly grainy but smooth and pasteurized. According to the brewery website, Cluster hops are used, but apparently in great moderation. Another lawn mower beer on an ever-growing list of unmemorable lagers."
"Average at best, but if its on the menu with only other macros, I guess I'll take it."
"Better than most macros. Pours the same color as all the rest of them. Some head but dissapates quickly. Fairly malty with a little hops afterwards. Some velvet in the mouthfeel. Sometimes can have a little charcoally taste. This beer is cheap and passable. My wife will drink it. Not much more to say here."
"This is a walleye-fishing, straight-from-the-bottle brew."
"The first tastes were a bit more like macro than expected but improved with warming. Feel is thin, watery and bit astringent. Overall this is an acceptable beer that is probably rated a bit high by me due to its handsome labeling, bottling, and initial appearance."
"A good beer. Not great, but definitely worth drinking, especially as an affordable alternative to the big name American lagers. A good mellow hop presence, moderate carbonation, and refreshing. The real surprise is a malt presence that makes this piss drinkable."
"Skip this one."
"Pours a clear light gold in color with no head. There is hardly even a collar of carbonation around the glass. Musty aroma with a thin hop nose. The smell reminds me of a lot of macros. Bland taste, slight sweetness, no real hop bitterness. This would be a good summer refresher as the beer is fairly crisp and clean. Nothing really offensive, just not a great beer for sure."
"I think Miller has moved production from Chippewa Falls to Milwaukee, but the taste seems to be the same. This is superior to the Miller, Bud, Coors type of beers and holds up well to other good regional brews. No longer unique as it once was but still a good everyday beer!"
"pale straw color, thin foamy head that dies in seconds. refreshing pale malt aroma, no real adjunct smell...grassy hop aroma. tastes fairly grainy and crisp...some grassy hop taste and bitterness in the finish. a fairly light bodied, tasty and easy drinking american lager that has some euro-pils qualities to it. stands up to the big macro boys."
"Leinenkugels Original Lager is an all around good old fashion American lager that is not on steroids nor is it lacking in good taste. Wholesome body and flavor are readily found in every glass."
"Golden color with moderate carbonation and head.  It had a hoppy aroma and a mild, but full, flavor.  A good lager, on par with Bud and definitely better than macro lights."
"Good premium American lager. No detectable adjunct character, decent bitterness to balance the malt, nice head retention for the style. Goes great with pizza delivery and videos. Reminds me of North American Lowenbrau. A solid dependable American beer."
"Yellow-gold body. Large, smooth white head, recedes some, leaves some light lacing. Looks better than it drinks. No real strong aromas. Just a very basic American Lager beer smell, but not stale. Very little taste at all, but a soapy aftertaste.  Nothing to really recommend it, I would prefer Bud, Coors, or High Life, at least they are not pretending to be a craft/micro.  It is certainly not in Yuenglings class as a traditonal American lager."
"Not a bad looking beer, for a semi-macro lager.  Had it in a can, and it smells awful, it’s got a sharp metallic tang that runs straight up through the nostrils.  Decent first taste runs into an awful aftertaste.  I’ve had (and liked) Leinie products, and I know this is their bottom of the line, but I ain’t liking this.  I’ll get it in a bottle and update, but until then go with High Life or PBR."
"Pale straw color with a mysteriously fast fading head.  Very little smell.  Quite sweet in flavor, I can't detect a macro corn flavor, though the malt may simply be barely ""cooked"".  Hops are minimal and mostly crisp at the back of the mouth.  Unlike many Leinenkugel products, Leinie's O doesn't promise a lot and let you down, its just an easy going American Lager.  It goes well with stadium food..."
"Light golden hue & very clear-- it's just a bit darker than a pilsner. Decent head retention allows for a sparse lace. Mild grainy & husky six - row aroma. A hint of cooked corn in the aroma (is this really all malt?) & just a touch of grassy Saaz nose. There's nothing outstanding in flavor in this brew, but there's nothing off - putting either. The mild hop bitterness & meager malt backbone are balanced. Hop flavor is insubstantial. Finishes dry, clean and with a slight sweetness on the tip of the tongue. This innocuous & fairly bland brew epitomizes the style. Ehh."
