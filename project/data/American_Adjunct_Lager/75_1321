APPEARANCE: clear copper body; pours a rashly fizzing head that comes to nothing quickly; a solitary bubble ascends; no lacing... AROMA: sweet, syrupy malts are front and center; biscuit and bread suggest a standard premium pilsener... PALATE: soft, apologetic and thin--drinkable but fizzy...TASTE: candied caramel malts and oats combine with some flowery hints to create a below-average, pitchy flavor...OVERALL: the can suggests it is the Mexican Miller, and not much in the can suggests the contrary; a good beer to finish the night with, when other quality beers have already been quaffed; as a sessional, meh...as a study, a fast, unrewarding one...","dacrza1","Jan 26, 2015"

A dark than expected orange-yellow with a light dappling of white bubbles rimming the glass. Aroma is slightly astringent and grainy, with an overarching corn sweetness. I was actually pleasantly surprised with the taste, perhaps because the expectancy bar was set appropriately low. There is a subtle buttery raisin note in there, along with a watermelon rind-like element (noble hops? ... Whoa...). Almost like a drastically watered-down Oktoberfest and distinct from other Mexican mainstream adjunct lagers in this regard. The expected corn sweetness is of course still present. Obviously its thin and watery, but there are at least some other low key flavors to note here. Perhaps I am guilty of overstating the case. At least this is almost as available as Corona and Pacifico in these parts.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 29, 2014"

3.12,12.2,,,,,,"Overall (3.12) : Again, this beer is leagues better than Corona Extra. I don't even want to look at a Corona again. Modelo Especial is still pretty terrible, but drinkable. If someone showed up to a party with Modelo, or if it was in a cooler full of macro light lagers, I'd take this in a second. If there were anything else that was in the running however, I would leave it chilling in the icebox. I hope that makes sense. I'll pass on this brew next time.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 08, 2014"

1.25,-55,,,,,,"Well, what can I say. Some drunk left behind a  can of this so I put it my fridge until the moment when it was all I had. I really hadn't tasted beer like this for a long, long time. Back in the day you could buy a six pack of Red White and Blue for maybe two bucks. Or some dive might have pitcher night or something. If you were to overhear a party discussing this beer and one said ""Taste like piss"" his mate would probably just retort ""How would you know?", but nobody would disagree.  Where you might expect the taste of hops you are met witht he taste of what? is it vinegar? Smells like something  in a photography darkroom - fixer, I guess. Also, has that 'left out all night' quality that I recall from days past. In the same way that old coffee is 'off', so is this, fresh from the can. I commend the brewers for their disdain of humanity and their apparent commercial success is converting Mexican wastewater (I guess that would explain it) into a viable commercial product. Packs a kick too - which would help with the prospect of downing a second one.  I'll give this 1.25 (not 1.0)  just so that I can reserve a place for a beer that might be even more repugnant.","darter909","Oct 03, 2014"

Modelo is a filtered brew you can see right though it. The smell is rich with grans and some bitterness. This for the most part looks and smells like an American Lager. The taste is bold but light. I'm not picking up on the bitterness of this brew. You pick up on some grains but not much. Modelo Especial has a smooth clean finish to it. Almost like a light american style beer. There is not much else to say. this is a good drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is clean and refreshing. Overall I'm giving this brew a 4 out of 5. This beer is better in a can. I would get this brew again.","nicholas2121","Jun 29, 2014"

I noticed it has lower ratings here which I can understand if you don't like this type of beer, but for a lot of people this is a perfectly good beer, with plenty of flavor and is better than corona or a lot of the other Mexican beers...

This is one of the better tasting adjuncts though, with enough sweet and bitter notes for even vet craft drinkers. But anemic and weak albeit. Golden water. If there are no tastes to speak of, they might be in the aftertastes, which are sadly stronger than the brew. The epitome of beer breath: grainy, malty and skunky. The carbonation is well attenuated and present, (above average). But when it's all said and done, this is a beer that you have to BURP to get a stronger taste. I have to keep the brew in my mouth and swish to even pick out any flavors. Not the wateriest beer but still watery. Drink Modelo Especial in the bottle to retain and compact the smells and flavors, (the little there are).","shacawgo24","Jan 26, 2014"

Flavor is mild, beginning with malt, maize and lager yeast, these flavors stay throughout, with a mild hop bitterness showing up in the middle and lingering on the aftertaste, with a bit of a metallic twinge, but not a lot. It's pretty good, mild but refreshing, with a higher hop character than some AALs I've had, and a decent malt and adjunct flavor. Mouthfeel is light bodied with high carbonation. Yet again standard for the style. Overall, when rated to it's style, this is a good beer. It has more flavor than many domestic options and has little of the offensive flavors other Mexican lagers can sometimes have. If it's one's only option for a lager, for instance at a Mexican restaurant, or you want a decent, inexpensive lawnmower lager, this is a good choice.","Auraan","Aug 29, 2013"

The nose has musty corn notes along with bread and zero hops. Not very pleasant. The taste is nearly flavorless aside from some faint corn paired with metallic flavors. A mild sweetness is present at the finish, but mainly just watery. Mouthfeel is light, fizzy, and a bit sharp. Overall, this is below average even for an AAL.","homebrew311","Aug 11, 2013"

The beer smells like grain husks with some sweetness. It has the classic American lager aroma. What you get in the flavor is a very straightforward pale lager. You get the flavor of the barley malt, but there aren't a lot of hop notes here. They weren't strong in the aroma, but there is some minor back end bitterness. The body is light with strong carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. This beer is highly drinkable. This is a good beer.","acevenom","Jul 15, 2013"

Aroma is slightly sweet, with a hint of bread. After adding lime, it smells much more citrusy. Go figure. Taste is almost non-existent, with very little by way of malt, hops, or anything else. With no lime, there is almost no flavor and I now understand why it comes with lime. Even lime doesn't really bring much to the party. But it IS better. Has a decent mouthfeel, smooth with a hint of carbonation. It does do well with spicy Mexican food when served with a lime, so it's got that going for it.","delta490","May 05, 2013"

I've only had one adjunct that tastes different, Landshark, and that's just because of the added sugar (which doesn't improve that particular brew all too much). Modelo is just a good standard example of the style, with little discernible hop flavor, not very malty, plenty of rice, or corn, neither of which has anything remarkably distinctive to add.

Smell was like all other adjunct lagers - all rice. Taste actually wasn't that bad, maybe because it was on draft. Regardless, it was a pretty smooth tasting lager. Mouthfeel was on the watery side, but it went down easy. Not a bad pint for $4 with a plate of gourmet tacos.

The aroma was typical of a mexican style lager, dominated by grain and grass. The taste had slight hints of grain, it was very sweet and it had almost no hop bitterness.

The smell is a little watery, but roast and toasty cereal, mostly. The flavors are limited, at best. Roasted malt with a musty, almost stale aftertaste. The finish is crisp and dry, but again, still stale, and the mustiness continues to overpower. Bleh...but they fill the fridge with 6 ""fresh"" ones every day, so I will continue to drink.

I consider this a pretty decent example of the style and not a bad choice when noshing on ribs or other grease laden fare. I found this to be refreshing and it satisfied my craving for a second beer without weighing me done or making me feel bloated like some overly gassy adjunct lagers have a tendency to do and I like the fact you can actually taste the malt, not just a seltzer lager flavor.","Slatetank","May 17, 2011"

1.92,-30.9,2,2.5,1.5,2,2,"Pours a small one finger white head that I can head fizzing away, which is not good, the body is a dark yellow color, with medium carbonation and almost 100% transparent, but not completely. Here are my first thoughts, the head is gone, and I can tell I'm not going to get much lacing, so that's bad. But on the other hand there isn't a crap load of carbonation and the color isn't as light yellow as most of the adjunct lagers I've had, so that kinda offsets things a little bit. The smell is a little hoppy and a little malty, frankly it smells a little skunky, but maybe that's just the hops, because it's in a can so theres no way it's skunky. I mean overall the smell is very faint, and not very strong, but what I can smell I like, it smells like it has some taste to it, so not bad on the smell for an adjunct lager. Extremely watery on the taste, like WOW, super watery, I was expecting much more flavor out of that smell. I'm for sure getting a metallic flavor and a almost a cough syrup taste mixed in with the low carbonation. The taste is not very good at all, I'm really not getting any hops or malts either here. It really just tastes like metallicy cough syrupy water. On second thought, there might be a small small hop bite in here somewhere. The only two things I can think so say that are good about the taste are the small hop bite and the fact that it's not skunky like I thought it might be on the smell. I was really expecting more flavor from this beer, but it's falling very short, even for an adjunct lager. The mouthfeel is ok, not terrible, medium carbonation, but frankly it could actually use a bit more carbonation because the flavor isn't all that great. Drinkability is considerably low considering it's an adjunct lager. Overall on this beer, way worse than I was expecting, and I wasn't expecting all that much from it, being an adjunct lager.

A bit of plastic flavor on the midpalate and in the finish, but it is largely missable, making this a fairly well done adjunct lager. Honestly one of the better adjunct lagers out there, though on the more expensive side for a style that encompassing various types of swill. Feels pretty light, probably because of the high carbonation, though it stays prickly and not foamy. If you're going to drink swill, this is a pretty good choice.","vacax","Sep 30, 2009"

Geez, get rid of the grainy malt and substitute with a dry cracker like malt, and have yourself a nice pilsner. The feel is light but not watery, quite fizzy, finishes grainy sweet and a bit astringent. A Mexican Euro lager which fits the brewers style I guess. I wish they went with more a pilsner style.

2.95,6.1,3,3,3,2.5,3,"An above average lager. Pours a very pale golden tone with a thick but easily fading head that leaves verym very scarce lacing. The smell, very strong, shows some citrusy and low hops mixes with no much maltyness. The taste is a nice, full body sweetness with some bitterness. A good lager anyways.","Andreji","Jun 13, 2003"
2.26,-18.7,2.5,1.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Nothing too special (or especial) about this beer except the nice packaging. Average all the way around. Might possibly have been a little better if not skunked. This is like a premium version of Corona, if you could imagine such a thing.","Beastdog75","May 23, 2003"
2.73,-1.8,2.5,2,3,4,2.5,"This brew poured somewhat of a small head. It was yellow in body. It was a thin brew. It was a rather smooth brew to drink. In my own opinion, I was not very impressed by this particular brew. This is another brew that lacks character in my humble opinion.","hotstuff","May 13, 2003"
2.86,2.9,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Pours a clear gold with a voluminous white head that vanishes quickly leaving behind a thin layer of lacing bubbles. The nose of this beer out of the clear bottle was of light skunk and malt. The taste is purely macro and the feel is of a light body with a thin sense. The finish is highly astringent. Some sense of adjuncts. To my peril, this beer was served closer to room temperature than it should have been. Clearly, it needs to be kept very cold.","AtLagerHeads","May 10, 2003"
2.06,-25.9,3,2,2,2,2,"Packaging looks good. Pours like a macro lager, pale yellow with a 1"" white head. Smell and first sip are of malted grains. Only slight hop taste. This actually was surprisingly smooth. I don't think this is great, but it's not as bad as some.","Rifrafboy","Mar 06, 2003"
3.18,14.4,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"The appearance of this little mex caught my attention. The foil wrapped short bottle helps this brew stand alone from its Corona big brother. Its pure clear gold color and small white head compliment any mexican or spiced dish. Its smooth clean finish helps make this a very drinkable brew.","chilidog","Jan 24, 2003"
2.26,-18.7,3,2,2,2,3,"The pour the prototypical lager clear gold or straw if you prefer. Modest in size white head and something resembling lace that is oozing its way down the glass. The aroma of malt and little else to speak of, sweet as is the start and the top skimpy. Finish is lightly hopped and the acidity mild with a very dry lingering aftertaste. Another average beer, it is drinkable, I must give it that and I donÂ’t like being totally negative.","Gusler","Dec 10, 2002"
2.44,-12.2,3,1.5,2.5,3,3,"Not so good. This is a beer that brings the word ""thin"" to mind. It has no color beyond the usual macro-tones. The smell is actually bad, almost smells spoiled (I had this beer at least 6-7 times in Mexico and it smelled the same each time). Flavor is lager - minus. Drinkable in Mexico only.","doho95fu","Nov 24, 2002"
1.3,-53.2,1,1,1.5,1,1.5,"This certainly wasn't very ""especial"". This may be even worse than Corona. Vile, repugnant smell. No redeeming qualities in the flavor. Truly heinous. Another contender in the ""crap Mexican beer"" contest.","Dogbrick","Nov 06, 2002"
3.25,16.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"A bit better than average Mexican beer; goes well enough with Tex-Mex, or barbeque.  Definitely a summer beer, I might have liked it a bit better on a really hot summer day, rather than a cool autumn evening, such as this one.","Pegasus","Oct 13, 2002"
3.4,22.3,3,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Bit more flavour than your usual Mexi-Lager, this is a prefered lager I have when enjoying south-of-the-border cuisine. No lime is needed being that there is less offensive off flavours to try and mask. Best consumed ice cold.","Jason","Aug 18, 2002"
3.13,12.6,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Typically clear golden hue topped by a head that settles quickly into a tight layer.  Sparse lace is left.  Soft grain, a touch of herbal / grassy hop and sweetness in aroma.  No trace of skunkiness. Very mild, almost bland all around flavorwise-- light grain husk flavors and paltry hop bitterness are discerned at first, and are followed by a mellow corn flavor and residual sweetness.  Finishes very clean w/ a hint of sulfur.  There's nothing outstanding about Modelo Especial, but it far surpasses most domestic macrobrew overall.","marc77","Jun 30, 2002"
3.2,15.1,3,3,3.5,3,3,"I'm not sure how this is supposed to compare with Lowenbrau as a reviewer below mentioned. Perhaps I should try again some other time. It was hoppy, light on smell and feel. I'd suspect it would be a good meal beer but nothing special.","packetknife","May 05, 2002"
3.2,15.1,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Not a bad light beer, but I don't think it tastes like a Mexican beer. It has more of an American light beer taste to it, but is better than most of the stuff here. I would probably only drink this at a Mexican restaurant, which is where I originally had it. The bottle is the most interesting part of the beer.","IrishRedRock","Apr 17, 2002"
1.06,-61.9,2,1,1,1,1,"Thinner than most ""lite"" beers, if you dilute one Corona in a gallon of seltzer, you've pretty much got this beer.","Brent","Aug 22, 2001"
