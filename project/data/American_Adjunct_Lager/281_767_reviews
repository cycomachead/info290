"It is a good beer... Only you drink it somewhere in China's Night Markets."
"Nothing too bad, your average good looking dinner beer but the rice gave a bad taste in the mouth after drinking."
"good dinner beer if you have the option"
"Strong head. The smell slightly fruity, floral, hoppy. Taste slightly fruity, hoppy. Bitterness average. Beer without body"
""
"Crystal clear amber color with decent carbonation. Very little head retention and average lacing. Taste is fairly bold on the hop note, but in a skunky way. It goes excellent with spicy Chinese food and is very drinkable. No, it is not the greatest beer ever nor does it have a complex flavor; but for an average beer to enjoy with dinner that is drinkable-- it's a good bet."
""
""
"Very hard beer, just how I like it. Doesn't need salt but it definitely gives it that extra kick"
""
"If you're looking to add a beer to the list, it's a fine choice. However, I have heard there are many better Chinese beers out there (have not personally had one). Overall, it's refreshing enough, tastes alright (bit watered down), and looks not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So so. Light drinking feeling."
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoy"
""
"I found this beer to be cheaper than water while working in China. Would I buy it back home? No. Would I buy it while living in Beijing? Sure why not"
"This just was not good"
""
"The initial taste was quite strong, a little sour, and thereafter some malts and hay, a bit grainy with the rice making an appearance. A nicely balanced beer, not overbearing, with a lot of subtle flavours. Not much in the aftertaste, but overall this beer was very smooth, and not at all heavy. The crisp and refreshing taste makes this one of the most sessionable lagers you can find in my opinion.  I like Tsingtao Beer, its not going to get you wasted, but you can drink a lot of them without having to worry too much about the night, or indeed not expect a bad hangover."
""
"Was expecting this to be very bad.  I was pleasantly surprised by the clean (read: lack of bad aftertaste) profile.  Not a good beer...basically a typical Asian adjunct beer...but okay if cold.  Could be worse...and many are."
"Amazing with Chinese food and Sirracha!"
"It's great with Asian food ."
""
""
""
""
""
"The the feeling is nice with a bit of carbonation and tingle on the back of the throat"
""
"Not bad... sort of on the level of Bud."
""
"nothing special by any means."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty sessionable lager that is moderately priced"
"Not the best goin round please"
"Piss poor beer in a green bottle. This shouldn't be a surprise."

"I've had this twice. In a Japanese restaurant and at the time, I thought it was pretty skunky but the one I'm drinking now is perfect. A perfect amount of skunk but the beer is very mild. Would defiantly get again if I'm at an oriental restaurant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my choice (and usually only choice) at Chinese restaurants.  Its got a strong grain flavor and usually a bit of skunky aroma with some mild hop bitterness.  It cleanses the palate nicely and goes well with the cuisine."

"Light and a bit skunky. Great served ice cold poured into a glass next to a big plate of kung pao chicken. Nice"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pale and bubbly. No head to speak of. Mild grains and skunk in the nose.  Flavor is dominated by skunked rice adjuncts. Light bodied with an odd slick texture. I drank just enough to write this review. The rest went down the drain."

"Over all – I hate to be mean and if I compare this to other beers in the same style it is not the worst in the world. If you like a Budweiser then this is a better brew, I think. If you like Ales or Bitters then give this one a wide berth. For what it is trying to be it does the job, I just don’t like what it is trying to be. My final score is based on the fact this beer is doing what it set out to do but what it is trying to be is not interesting or even difficult to do, however there are worse beers in this style."

"of all the places to find Chinese beer, i didnt think Bavaria would be on the list. picked it up cuz i wanted to try something different. good thing it was cheap. the Chinese do a lot of things very well, beer isnt one of those things. id rate this beer marginally higher than bud light, only for the higher alcohol content."

"O: Not much here, like an empty shell."
""
""
"Overall: Sour and skunky. Nothing resembling beer."
""
""
"Pours a light, almost clear, yellow with little to no head. The smell was fermented rice, almost skunky smell. The taste was the same and the skunky aftertaste lasted way too long. The mouthfeel was nice but overall I wasn't a fan. It is too similar to Heineken in all the worst ways."
""
""
"Basically has the flavor and taste of a check Heineken. Can't say if recommend buying it as it isn't an inexpensive beer. Flavor and smell were both on the skunky side. Bottle is nice, again when has the bottle designed similarly to Heineken. Would be interesting to taste it out of a can"
""

"day beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My first beer from China, and one I've wanted to try since beginning to study Chinese last fall. Good for the tick, but not something I have the desire to ever have again. Would try again if this came canned or if I knew it was fresh and not lightstruck."
"This should match perfectly to spicy Asian food."

"It's always tough to review an AAL, since it's a category fabricated to house certain sub-par beers. To style, this beer isn't all that bad. What kills it is the green bottle and the skunk that follows it. Not quite as bad as Moosehead, but it's up there. The head was quite nice for an AAL; downhill after that. A bit too sweet and grain-husky"
""
""
""
""
"Well, we had a beer with a pale watery yellow hue that resembles a low end american lager. It has not much of a smell and believe me the flavor is dead as well. Mouthfeel is terrible.. Feels like I'm drinking cold mineral water over here. Overall I rate it 1.5, halfway between poor and awful because thats what it is. Only ordered it because I was a chinese joint and never tried the darn thing. Adding insult to injury is the fact that I blew three fifty on twelve ounces of it..."

"Very mediocre lager, watery, flavorless in seconds, typical skunk aroma. However, the appearance is OK – nice body and decent lacing."

"Straw yellow in color when poured, with no real head. Lots of small carbonation, what I would expect from a lager. Smells alright; sort of yeasty. Not strong smell. Not much flavor; tasted like a watered-down decent lager. The flavor was not offensive at all; it was very drinkable - just not much there. Thin and watery mouthfeel; dry finish. Nothing special. If someone gave me one, I could certainly drink it. It was light; I felt like a could drink several and not get full. I drank it with dinner; it was fine in the sense it did not compete with the food - since there wasn't a strong flavor."
""
""
""

"Flavor: white bread, sweet malt, grass, slight hops in the finish."

"If anyone knows where to get this unfiltered nectar in a can, please let me know!!! Until then, I'll have to wait until I make it over to Qingdao again and get some on tap!"

"A “classic” blah American adjunct style lager – bland, boring, and plain ol' funky/weird. But, hey, it's wet and sure does look outstanding!"
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"delicious, easy-to-drink lager that is not arrogant, pretentious, or hangover-on-the-first-sip inducing. This is China's top beer, and realistically, the only good beer coming out of China today. Multiple flavors = red label, green label, more. Tastes better on draft in mainland - the bottles travel ok to America."
""
"The Rest: Meh, what can you say, it's an adjunct lager. Gets you buy in a pinch."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the green bottle into a pint glass. A super pale straw yellow brew, maybe just a hair darker than some American examples of the adjunct lager, with the expected foaming white bubbles filling the glass. Beer remains fizzy and effervescent throughout. Smells grainy and slightly tangy, rank waterlogged barley and no trace of corn sweetness ... Rice is king here, astringent, crisp, and clean other than the aforementioned wet grain notes. Palate benefits from a cold temperature, drink up quick. Some tangy lemon rind and grape flavors, vaporous and fleeting, followed by old grain mill or malt liquor, a little like Singha but no where near as flavorful. Some medicinal aspirin and a sour metallic tang throughout. Plastic flavors emerge as the beer warms. Somewhat skunky, another feature that unfortunately gains salience over time. Stripped down. Far less sweet than most American adjunct beers. Finishes dry and with an unexpected American hop currant twang (but this feature is decidedly subtle). Meets expectations. This beer may very well complement Chinese food but that ain't going to bump up my ratings."

"Appearance is a light gold, decent head that recedes to a fat ring with little to no lacing. Wet cardboard is the aroma, skunkiness is dialed down. Flavor is mineral and salt a bit, fairly bland but a tinge of flavor is found. Not offensive but not really what i'm shooting for in a beer. Still, for the price, you could do a lot worse."
""
""
"This beer had its moments for sure. I’d say above average for an American Adjunct Lager."

"Tastes like a watered-down Heineken. Has a strong skunky smell and offers a thin yet off-putting body that basically amounts to a Chinese Heineken Light. I had but one bottled poured into a glass and I'm glad I did for the sake of trying it, but I will never pay for one again. Can't recommend this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing special, China's version of an american macrolager"
""
""
""
""
"Overall you could do a lot worse. Here in China you can get one of these big bottles for less than a dollar (5 Rmb), unless you are at one of Shanghai's fine nighttime drinking establishments in which the price can, of course, range anywhere from 2 to 10 dollars. (12-50 Rmb). For something typical, pretty smooth, and drinkable you could do much worse than this one. Probably one of the better mass produced Chinese lagers. I'll keep coming back to this one again and again."

"Overall, it is what's available in China and it is one of their best beers. It is thirst quenching and is excellent for the last days of summer and the transition into fall. Are there better lagers out there...yes. Does this one hit the spot...hmmm...sure."
"I was morbidly curious as to what a Chinese beer would actually taste like. Was surprised in a decent way. Not exactly a stellar beer but fit the Chinese food we were eating well. Was a more refreshing light kind of beer than anything else. I would recommend if you're not looking for anything fancy and want to try something new."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Despite the atrocious smell of this through it's actually quite delightful. It is one of the smoothest beers I have ever had and leaves a good aftertaste. It has great flavor and is always enjoyable. Hands down my favorite chinese beer, and also one of my select choice beers personally as well. I would always recommend tsingtao."
""
""
""
""
""
"On its own I could not session this-at all! This is, for me, is a beer food. The sweetness and lower carbonation pair well with wasabi, soy, ginger, sushi, sweet and sours, etc.. I would definitely get again at Asian restaurants."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I give this beer a low score, however I will try it again from another establishment and see if it was just that particular bottle that did indeed get skunked."
""
""
""
""
"Apple juice color. Almost no head. Fades quickly. Decent lacing. Slow rising carbonation. Not really a discernible smell. Taste is better than the appearance and smell would suggest. Starts very carbonated. Finishes very smooth with a great malty taste. Leaves a pleasurable aftertaste. Overall, not bad. It was my first ever Chinese beer and I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""

"one of my least favorite of the Asian beers, it has a good mouthfeel, is well carbonated and drinkably light, but that's about it. it has a really strong adjunct metallic flavor, and the finish is mineral heavy and always a tad skunky no matter where it comes from. im not sure if there is rice or corn in this, but it tastes starchy, sweet for the wrong reasons, and it is unsettling in the stomach after a few of them. it always seems to be available at the Asian eateries, but I much prefer Sapporo or asahi or even tiger or kirin to this. it is bright enough to cleanse the palate, but it almost has a chemical preservative sort of finish to it that just really turns me off. maybe at the source this beer would be something to try again, but for now its one I stay away form when there are other options in front of me."

"Poured from a can into a pint mug. Clear pale straw color, ample and quickly dissipating white head, no lacing. Nose is quite sour. Tastes of lime, with a faint hint of bitterness in the background, but neither malt nor hop notes are recognizeable. Actually, quite reminiscent of Radler, a mixture of light lager and Sprite and a popular summer refreshment in Germany. Thin, highly carbonated."
""
""
""

""
""

"What I did like was the aroma of this beer. It smells like hay and there were some herbs and grass smells."

"Can be found at almost any good Asian restaurant. Out pours a nice pale golden color with a small white head, lively carbonation but it fades away fast. Faint aroma of malt, sweet corn, light grains and no bitterness. The combination of a thin body, low carbonation and sweet taste works well with oriental foods. Overall it's not bad, maybe a little watery, but works great as a thirst-quencher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good in the summer, and the best accompaniment I know of to Chinese food, particularly very spicy Chinese food."
""
""
""
"Reminiscent of a Chinese Heineken, except with an odd medicinal aftertaste that became increasingly difficult to drink as it warmed. Decent to drink with Chinese food, but not worth the price of admission at import premiums. I also laughed when I encountered the U.S. packaging touting Tsingtao as ""the number 1 selling Chinese beer in the USA"""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: My favorite pilsner. Distinctly crisp, clean, fresh and hoppy, with none of the soapy flavor or yeasty smell of macro lagers. It's a great lunch-time beer. It beats anything else in the category than I can think of, and the bad reviews of this enjoyable beer simply don't make any sense."
""
""
""
"O-not terribly appealing, little flavor"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - The smell is very skunky and prevalent while the flavor is almost non-existent. Although I'm not sure if I would want to taste the beer if it were made earlier just based on the smell I was getting."

""

"O: A chugging beer. Will not have again."
""
""
""
""
""

"This isn't the best tasting drink, but it is very light. It would be easy to kill a bunch of these to get drunk, if that's how you roll. Not terrible, but just below average."

""

""
"Light smell of citrus. Taste is flat with no carbonation feelable in the mouth. As a beer for a warm day this beers does it's job, no more and no less."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale straw color with a decent sized white head that dissipates slowly. Smells of grain and a hint of earth and little else. The flavor is light grain with some earth and a slight mineral metallic flavor. Light body with a spirited level of carbonation and a thin watery mouthfeel. Even for a light lager this leaves much to be desired. Light body with minimal flavor."

"Surprisingly pleasant lager. Washes down my hoedubbap and kimchi rather well. 3.5"
""
"A passable lager, but nothing special. Perhaps it stands out well in China. At least the taste is clean, if uninspiring. OK if there's nothing else going, but no need to seek it out."
""
""
""
""
"This started as just another import; skunky and unpleasant. The flavor, however, is much different. The flavor has a light malt character and a moderate, grassy hop character. The drinkability is great. Crisp, clean, refreshing. This is definitely one of the better adjunct lagers out there."
""
"Transparent yellow in body with white bubbly head that fades fast. Aroma of most adjunct lagers: light grain and hops. Tastes of light grains, hop bitterness, a bit grassy and some sweetness. Light bodied with mild carbonation. Such an easy drinker that doesn't gross me out."

"O: This beer isn’t overly flavorful, but it probably be a good accompaniment to Chinese food if you were looking for something other than water to help wash down spicy dishes."
"O: Not bad, I kind of equate this beer to the Heineken of China... especially because of the slightly skunky smell due to the green bottle. This beer is light and easy enough to drink but not anything special. I will likely has this again but not because I have a really high opinion of it."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with bland flavors and aromas."
""
""
"Despite the smell, this isn't really that offensive. It's too sweet, and utterly lacks taste. It has the body of an American adjunct lager with about as much (or less flavor) as a light lager. I don't know when I would ever drink this again, but I must once again note that this isn't awful. Just bad."

"I had this with some Japanese food the other day. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It is straw yellow with a thin fizzy white head that dissipates immediately leaving no lacing. It smells slightly skunky with a hint of Noble hops and somewhat grassy. The taste is similar to the nose as there is a hint of hop bitterness but is dominated by the malts. Not a lot of flavor. The mouthfeel is thin and carbonated. Overall, nothing special but I didn't expect it to be. I will probably never drink this again."

"Really not bad when nice and cold. As it warms up just a bit, the flaws of the style start to show, it is hard to describe but it must just lack a balance that beer brewed with more hops and malt displays."

"A decent adjunct lager, well-balanced with no genuinely annoying flaws to gripe about. Refreshing and serviceable enough, but I doubt most people would have trouble finding a cheaper domestic equivalent. Not really worth trying, unless you're at a Chinese restaurant and don't have other options."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: decent, and probably only come back to it depending upon what else was served"
"O - a pretty basic lager, but perfect for Chinese food"
"O - This beer is a bit to light to when drinking it with spicy dishes. The beer is easy to drink and therefore it is a real thirst quencher."
"This beer does not thrill but it does have a smooth feel that seems to slide across the tongue and goes down with little effort."
"Overall a good adjunct and I much prefer it to Budweiser and the like. I don't need to be eating Chinese food to enjoy it."
"O: It looks like I won't be in the market for any Chinese beers after this one."
"O: Unfortunately, I didn't like this beer at all, even paired with chinese food, which I was hoping would go good with it. I'm looking at the full glass I have left and wondering if I'll be able to finish it."
"Overall, this is a fairly bland lager, but it is my go-to beer at the Chinese buffet. It's the only Chinese beer I typically see in local Chinese restaurants and I prefer it to any domestic macros or just having water at dinner. Certainly nothing great in a beer, but its not bad either."
"O - Easily drinkable, and a bit more flavourful than most mass produced export ales, but still rather weak. Great cottage drinking ale, or the kind you crave after mowing the lawn."
"Overall: Not too bad, but still not a beer I would drink. IMO there are better Asian lagers to have with Chinese food."
"Summary - I'm really not impressed by this brew. Again, not good by itself, but decent with some food. Wouldn't really recommend."
"This beer is crisp, would be great on the porch watching the sun go down. This has to be the Chinese Budweiser. At any rate, it's good. Maybe one day when I visit China I can drink one with the natives. Yummy! Bottoms up people."
"O- Better than what I expected. Nothing special at all, its not a beer I would seek out or drink regularly. But its a decent option in a Chinese restaurant because Chinese restaurants normally do not have good beer selections. I would drink this again."
"Pours a crystal clear light yellow with a 1 inch bubbly head that settles to a thin film on the top of the beer. Thin broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted grain, corn flakes, and grassy/herbal aromas. Taste is of the toasted grains, corn flakes, and slight honey. This beer has a pretty average mouthfeel with a crisp and bubbly texture. Overall, this is my first beer from China and I think it's pretty good for what it is."
"O: Not bad, just leaves you wanting more. Light for a lager; would probably do well with heavier, spicy Asian food."
"This is beer? I will say, it didn't actually taste bad. But it didn't taste good either. I'd rather drink water."
"Overall: Fine for sessioning, good for washing down snacks, but can't stand on it's own. Very comparable to the other world's large brewers, which is both its blessing and its curse. I will inevitably have it again, as I currently live here in the home of Tsingtao Beer, but if given a choice I would pick something with more flavor."
"Updated after drinking it from a 640ml bottle."
"D:Would like to review this one fresh but since I have no plans to visit China anytime soon, this will have to suffice. Is it fair to review an obviously skunked beer? YES. The Tsingtao company needs to get its act together and drop the green glass act that seems to fool only stupid yuppies in America trying to impress people with their imported swill."
"Yeah, it's from China. But it's not much different from any other adjunct lager. Pours a pale, watery, golden-straw color with a puff of white head that fizzles down to nearly nothing. Aroma of weak grains and a passing touch of hops, with the classic green bottle skunk. Taste of watered-down grains and corn, funk and skunk, harsh and metallic. Light and watery mouthfeel, and definitely to be avoided at all costs."
"Flavor is light, just a hint of hop sharpness cut by the carbonation of the beer. When served super cold, it's the simple lager style that can be refreshing it the hot months. Carbonated, cold, and in no way complex, it's great for after a run. Just know that you're not getting a beer that's going to challenge your palate."
"Pours a clear pale yellow with a very small white head. Aroma is very grainy with a very faint hoppy character. The body is extremely light and hardly any hops or malts are noticeable. Very skunky and watery. To be quite honest, one of the worst beers I’ve ever tried. This was a drain pour after the first couple of sips, I just could not bring myself to suffer any longer."
"For the record I'm used to some fairly piss-poor Australian lagers but this is just so much worse. Just based on the colour alone I didn't want to drink it (yes it looked like urine). The smell was ok but it just let itself down in so many other areas. Easily the worst beer I've ever reviewed."
"Food match: I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say ""Chinese food"". Of course that probably means nothing to someone who is actually Chinese - ""Chinese food"" as seen by Western eyes is a mixed bag of what is a large and diverse cuisine no doubt, but you get what I mean."
"Beer #3 for reviewing here in China. Tsingtao is everywhere seemingly in China, it's not too bad, not too good, just something to go with the good food you're having."
"Sitting in the FC lounge in Hong Kong on my way to Singapore and I am trying the Tsingtao beer from a can. The appearance is fine....clear golden color with good carbonation that provides a minimal white head. The smell is dominated by grain. The taste is over powered with grain and comes off the pallete a bit bitter toward the end. The mouthfeel is like rubbing dry wheat on your tongue then washing the dust down with water."
"I wouldn't hesitate to have another one of these!"
"NOTHING TO SEE HERE, GET ONLY IN A PINCH!"
"O: A light and easy to drink beer. Not really my favorite, but it goes well with a Chinese meal."
"This beer is okay, like any other adjunct lager but more watery. It is easy to drink and could be good when eating spicy foods at Asian restaurants. Still, wouldn't go out of my way to get it at a store again."
"Quite drinkable in this context, but not otherwise"
"Pours clear yellow/gold with a half finger of foam. Aroma is abhorrent. Cabbage, cooked corn, and skunkiness. First sip is better than it smells, thankfully. Finishes pretty dry with minimal sweetness. Not much flavor whatsoever. Honestly not as bad as I expected."
"O- A standard import adjunct. Nothing exciting but it goes down easily enough."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its simplicity, and how light and clean it is. This style can be overly metallic or adjuncty, but here we found the product to finish fairly smoothly, and without too much extraneous junk."
"abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Okay beer but just average and simple maybe next time I'll match this with Chinese's food would be better."
"Not as bad as I will admit I thought this would be. Adjunct, sure, but nothing to really ruin things. Drinks like a soda."
"Overall Drinkability- Started off rough around the corners, but this beer grew on me noticeably by the time I finished."
"Tsingtao is ""the Chinese beer"" that I never had a particular reason to try, so I decided to give is a shot. My tsingtao poured from the can with next to no head over a clear golden body . It really looks like a cup of chilled piss. The aroma put off was slightly skanky with a bit of citrus. The taste test revealed initial grainy maltiness that soon gave way a crisper bitterness that has some citrus quality to it. There's some prickliness and a thin watery mouthfeel to it. On overall drinkability, it goes down like a charm but probably because there's not much reason to reflect on this one. The only poor point is probably the smell, while the rest render it merely a decent means by which to get drunk."
"D= if this is all you have, you'll drink it and session on it, believe me-- but if you're in most places where choice is available, wave this one on by."
"bleh."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1/2"" white fizzy head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a crisp, clean pilsner malt and adjunct scent along with a dry lager yeast aroma. They must have used a ton of corn/rice in this beer. The malt aroma is so faint. The taste is decent. It has a smooth, quaffable flavor that goes down easy and finishes so clean; no defects present. There is little malt or hop character either. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with adequate good carbonation. This is a damn drinkable beer. It's light and refreshing with a crisp, clean finish."
"D: This is a very light, refreshing beer that is both simple and solid. I would say this is a good example of the style, but it does not define the style. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this, but like many beers in this category, it is not groundbreaking or complex."
"I always imagine, when having a beer from another country, that it's going to be an interesting and unique experience. Instead, the sensation I get from Tsingtao, is that I'm having a beer from a brewery that rhymes with Schmanheuser-Tush."
"Pours clear very pale yellow color, very fast fading thin white head. Aroma is very faint, sweet malty i´d say. Flavour reminds me of cardboard and some cheap white wine with a slight bitterness in the finish. Odd taste in mouth afterwards.Usually drunk at thai or chinese restaurant."
"It's a decent beer to try once in awhile. I don't think I've ever seen it in the store, but it's readily available at Chinese restaurants in the area."
"Saw this at the LCBO in Ontario and just grabbed one bottle of a broken six pack. This is my first beer from China. Pours the lightest yellow colour I've seen with a beer, very close to clear. White head dissipates pretty quickly with some spots of lacing. Smells of grainy malt and not much else. The slightest hint of bitterness in the flavour, but it is close to carbonated water pretty much. Nothing wrong with this other the lack of flavour."
"I purchased a 22 ounce bomber of this at the local Hibachi style restaraunt. The beer pours a clean yellow-gold color, with no head. It has a typical lager smell, although a bit on the sour side. The beer is crisp and light in mouth, with sour undertones. Weak barley notes to the flavor. The beer has a clean, crisp finish, with no discernable aftertaste. Decent beer to go along with the meal because you didn't have to worry about it interfering with any of the food flavors; there is not much going on in that bottle."
"Light grains and a floral, malty sweetness."
"D--as drinkable as water"
"Like I said, kind of an odd thin grape juice flavor. Other than that, just inoffensive, bland, and oh hum."
"Drinkability - This beer is easily drinkable. Would be great during the Summer. Very thirst quenching and refreshing. Lacks a bit in flavor, but a beer for socializing without complexity. A beer one wouldn't have to ponder or try to analyze too much."
"D: My first China beer... not the best beer ever, pretty average overall. Nothing to run out and look for."
"D: Easy drinking and slightly watery this beer did not stand out but it paired well with my Chinese food."
"This beer is quickly becoming one of my everyday beers, since I have started drinking it, many of my pals have started to like it also, replacing some of their everyday beers too! My co-worker and I joked about it being the only thing of quality coming from China."
"Including Tsingtao. I'd be more curious to try any of the (frankly, stomach-wrenching, Fear Factor-esque) delicacies above than sit through another bottle of this insipid, conventional, mass-produced swill. Not that it's so bad, but at least the other items would offer flavour, excitement, novelty and an authentic reflection of Chinese gastronomy."
"Pours a thin straw yellow color with a thick white head and a little bit of lacing. Smells of grain and maybe some rice and a little hops hiding somewhere in there. Tastes of grain and a little corn. Some bitterness probably from some hop extract. Mouthfeel is thin and nasty feeling. Drinkability is decent."
"Pours a moderate golden straw color with a white head and a tiny amount of lacing as it goes down my glass. Nose is lightly skunked hops and a bit of grain. The taste is light grain and straw with some mildly herbal hops. Light body with good carbonation. Not a great beer, but drinks well enough."
"drinkability: Drank it all but didn't order another!"
"D - Okay."
"D - If you happen across a Chinese restaurant, or wake up in Shanghai for whatever reason, you could probably do FAR worse than this. Overall, I am sure it would pair well with Thai or a spicy Chinese dish like General Tso's chicken or a kung pao dish. Why not drink this at a Chinese restaurant instead of a BMC?"
"Not much else to speak of, mouthfeel, same stuff, no nuances, drinkability easy to drink but pricey for what it is."
"Where is the head? I tried, but even with aggressive pouring I came up with nothing. Color is a dark yellow, rating a 3 on the SRM chart. Not much for smell, some rice, corn, malt, and yeast. Taste is clean and well balanced, but not a lot of flavor. Not a lot of excitement in the mouthfeel category, sort of watery and bland. It gets an ok rating on drinkability, as there is not a lot of flavor to offend much food, and it is an import."
"Tsingtao is good with chinese food or other spicy foods but only enjoyable with food. It is crisp and refreshing and could be a social beer amongst my Chinese friends."
"Thanks to Nesi Marc for the sixer. This pours pale yellow and clear. Fizzy white head, no lacing. It smells ""euro-lagerish"" with some hints of cooked vegetables and grains. Flavor is similar, sweet with a light mouthfeel. Finishes a bit sweet as well. The label says brewed with the finest malt although I suspect there's a lot of corn syrup in this one. Still, it you like Beck's this one is usually available to pair with some good Chinese food."
"D - Drinkable but not enjoyable and not recommended to have more than one."
"D: 绝佳伴侣 (forgive me, Chinese speakers, I have no idea how accurate google translator is for the word 'drinkability') is really quite good. A first sniff from the green glass showed a modicum of 'skunk' (good lord, world bottlers, why do you insist?), but this is otherwise a pretty good example of a common adjunct lager. I had no problem slurping this one down ~ 谢谢, my friends!"
"A fairly typical knock-off of cheap American pilsners. The head dissipates almost immediately. You get some skunking (green glass) but I've had worse. You do get some grassiness as well as basic grains in the taste. Not undrinkable but also not special in anyway. And in a blind taste testing I'd have guessed this came from the US, not China."
"RJT"
"D - goes great with slightly spicy asian cuisine, and certainly one of the more enjoyable adjunct lagers."
"Pours a pale straw color, not much of a head at all. Noticeable carbonation and light mouthfeel, typical of a macro lager. Overall appearance is very much like a BMC. Taste was actually better than I expected, I noticed a bit of skunkiness when opening the bottle but I didn't notice any ""off"" taste, it was actually sweeter than I expected. Would probably be highly drinkable, I just chose this one after a hot day walking about in the city and it was agreeable as a refresher."
"overall this is not bad by any means, its not great but it serves its purpose well."
"Well, after an abysmal introduction, the flavour settles down to that of a simple sweet adjunct lager, suitable enough for fiery ethnic-adjacent fare, and absolutely nothing more."
"I poured into my pint glass to a fleeting white head that left no traces that it was ever present. This beer is yellow in color. The aroma is sweet and bready. Surprisingly, there is no skunk smell or taste since it does come in a green bottle. The taste is overtly sweet. If it wasn't so sweet it actually would not be a horrible beer. The mouthfeel is thin, as expected. It is probably not a beer I would seek out."
"Bright yellow color with good clarity. Started with a thin white head that reducedto a healthy cap. Unlike most lagers of this type though, the foam was creamier and left some respectable lacings. Very light, sweet malty aroma. Good carbonation and a light body feel. Light sweet malty flavor. Nothing spectacular but far better than Bud, Miller, etc. Easy to drink."
"Drinkability: well, while unimpressive, it's certainly not offensive. As a light thirst-quencher, this would do the trick. We're having a heat wave today, so it's OK."
"The ""Glug"" was not as pronounced coming out of the pop-top as from the now-standard crack-open CANs, at least not until the end when it suddenly rushed out. It was The Case of the Mysterious Disappearing Head as one second it was there and in the next, it was gone. Vaporized! Color was a pale sunshine-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was pretty much standard for the style - a light lager sweetness underlain by a cereal smell. Oh well. Mouthfeel was medium with a light sweetness born of malt and adjuncts on the tongue. I am getting to the point that I do not mind the better ones as much as I used to. This was really not too bad, I know, damning with faint praise, but at least it was not gag-inducing like some I have tried. Finish was crisp and dry, fairly refreshing and I think that we/I need to remember why beers of the style are referred to as ""lawnmower beers"". They are not intended to be wildly hoppy or big in ABV, so as long as I CAN drink it down, it will get a satisfactory review."
"Drinkability: Meh. Kind of reminds me of Heineken, but maybe a little sweeter. Fortunately, it doesn't get really bad as it warms, as Heineken does."
"D - a decent beer, I've had more than my fair share of these over the years due to the taste and the low cost. Worth a try in my opinion."
"Honestly, I can think of several of the style that simply taste much better."
"I kind of get that budweiseresk rice adjunct flavor, but not nearly to that extent. Pretty good tasting beer though. Does the trick on a ridiculously hot day like today."
"A darn good green bottled beer, and tastes like a green bottled beer. I compared it to Becks or Heineken immediately. It's nice and light, but still keeps a grainy flavor. Not much for head though, almost poured more like a soda. I would like to find this in my grocery store or get a keg of it for home."
"Drinking this straight from the source, or pretty close to it. I do have to say I think it is real funny that most chinese poar your beer into either a wiskey/Old Fashond glass or a High-ball glass. THere is no head, nor any much of anything. But the taste is 40 times better than Budwiser and it has never mad me sick, unlike budwiser. And although I paid a full 90 cents USD for my pint, I have to say it was worth it. This beer is the best Chinese beer that I have incountered; I will post if there is any better local beer. For the price and whithin the catagory, TsingTao (Qing Dao) is the best beer you can get, and I would recan In the US it still beats most American shit y lagers."
"D - could drink a lot, but there are more interesting beers out there."
"D: Well... Please avoid it."
"Drinkability - Much much much better then the Tsingtao Pure Draft very drinkable and great for the warm weather months."
"D- Nothting special here at all. Seems like drinking any Bud or Miller products."
"Notes: It has it's own unique taste unlike any other macro adjunct lager, and this beer stands out from it's competition. Not to mention it is affordable and very easy to drink. I'd say buy this beer if you like a nice smooth lager."
"Drinkability: It's cold and wet with a complete absence of character."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, semi-sweet, a touch dry, crisp, and easy drinking."
"Value: Overpriced by a buck or two per sixer if you ask me; Tsingtao is a decent drinker, but only a half step up from Miller High Life."
"Overall: Nice beer that goes great with Chinese food (obviously) or anything a bit spicy. In other words, more of a meal beer. Thumbs up."
"Drinkability - This is better than what I expected from it. If you have it cold enough, its pretty decent. The caveat is that just because the flavor isn't bad, doesn't mean its good. There is absolutely nothing here that would compel me to ever have this beer again. I do travel to China occassionally though, and this is good enough that I may switch it up in place of the licensed local brews of Heineken and Bud."
"I say give it a shot at least once. You might be glad you did!"
"Not too bad if you are pairing this with some sushi or sashimi"
"thankfully it isn't sweet as it suggested...very light, crisp and smooth. nothing skunky though stored in a GREEN bottle! also, the grains come across in a way that certainly does pair well with spicy or fried asian foods. a very drinkable (though not quite remarkable) brew. would love to see something from them with more pizazz"
"Drink: A nicely drinkable beer to be sure. Probably goes well with most dishes at your favorite Asian restaurant."
"Straw color with a large whit head with poor retention. Faint smell of grain and grass tells me the flavor will not be very bold. Not much taste. Bland with some light sweet malt. The hop flavor is pretty weak at best. Overall a pretty weak effort, not recommended."
"D-the mouthfeel is fine but not a fan of the taste, there is a lot of platic and phenol in the taste which is not enjoyable. What can you expect from an adjuct lager?"
"The nose is very sweet with the scent typical of a lager but with a dose of freshness and more. The flavor is that of a lager, but the taste is weak but it is quite aromatic. There are touches of metal but also with subtle touches of rice. The finish, though somewhat artificial, is slightly bitter and is touched once more to the taste of rice. Beer fairly low in terms of bitterness and flavor but is very pleasant to drink, which contains a heady force very well hidden. Indispensable when you went to a Chinese restaurant."
"Pours a pale yellow with a white head. Aroma is a slightly sweet grain but nothing more. Pretty much the same when it comes to taste. Not a horrible beer, but nothing good at the same time. Probably the only decent selection when you go to a chinese restaurant anyway, but even then, I would just get the tea."
"This is a nice import lager. It has very light straw colored look that is quite carbonated. The smell is of grain and of sweet notes. The taste is good it does taste of grain but does finish with some nice hop notes. Mouth feel is about medium not to light not to heavy and it has a nice drinkability. I would defintely drink this beer while eating some general tso's chicken!!"
"Light but not so bubbly mouthfeel, slightly flat almost. Not the smoothest out there. Was alright with my Chinease meal."
"Body was typical for this style, but due to the skunk factor drinkability was far less than it should have been. Overall, an OK beer, no need to seek it out, but if you see it, why not give it a shot?"
"Very unimpressive, bland beer. Easy to drink but the only time I could see myself having another would be for cooling off on a scorching hot day."
"D- Weak flavor and underwhelming body to not bode-well for overall drinkability. Could work fine as a lawnmower beer though..."
"D - I wouldn't turn it down. And with Asian being my favorite cuisine, after Kirin Ichiban or Sapporo, it's a great compliment to a meal of spicy Chinese."
"D: On its own, this is not an overly impressive beer. However, it is quite a functional beer and is a great compliment to the wide array of flavors present in a Chinese meal. The lightness and high carbonation are able to cut through spice, grease, and salt, giving this beer a great cleansing quality."
"reminds me of Heineken just a bit, I won't be drinking this anytime soon not because it's a bad beer, only because there's better beers for the same price"
"Overall, for the largest country in the world, population wise, you think they could come up with better beer."
"Overall, a less than decent brew, but stays on par with the other adjuncts out there. It seems like it's only good for washing down hot foods or a refreshing lawn-mower beer. Don't think I'll be buying this one again."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice blond straw color. The beer poured a nice white head that was pretty. The smell was skunky and not good at all. The taste was not skunky but was green and sweet tasting. The beer had decent lacing. I will not buy this beer again."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Average level. Light bodied, watery mouthfeel. Smooth to drink due to the soft cabonation."
"12oz bottle at a Chinese restaurant. Golden color, no surprise there. It didn't have much smell in the glass at all. The flavor was surprisingly better than average with a fruitiness that I was not expecting from a macro Chinese lager. Great beer to pair with hot and sour soup."
"Drinkability? It sure is an easy quaffer and the taste is respectable. A good example of the style."
"A pretty good middle of the road beer and better than most of its American counterparts. Decent in the drinkability department."
"went through it very quickly. much better than the red oval. If this stuff were as cheap as it should be, I'd drink it. As it is, I'll unfortunately probably never drink it again. nice brew"
"The feel is a little less watery than I thought but its drinkability is held back by a bitter skunked finsih."
"Poured a clear blonde with a moderate head that faded to nothing. The aroma was straight out of a skunk's arse, but after I became desensitized, just a sweet grain aroma. The taste was sweet, malty grain with no bite (hop or carbonation). The feel was light bodied with almost no carbonation. Drinkability was good. Nothing outstanding here, your basic lager, very sessionable."
"This beer poured a darker yellow with a single-finger fizzy head. The smell is good old capitalist cooked corn, just like we've got over here. The taste follows suit, starting off with some corn that gives way to a fairly clean finish. As with every beer in this style, the highlight is drinkability. It wouldn't hurt someone to have one every so often, but it hardly seems worth importing mediocrity of this level when we already have supermarkets full of the stuff."
"First impression of this beer came from my father-in-law who somehow clung to this brew's name. Taking his typical style preference into account (stouts) I figured this may be ok for an AAJ. Either I was completely overhyped or a whole lot of people (1.3 billion) just don't have any other options..."
"Overall you can do worse in the category than this beer. It's light and refreshing, inoffensive and the flavour is mild enough that you can pretty much ignore it. I won't be searching it out, but maybe next time I'm eating Chinese I'll see if they have this available."
"I didn't care for this beer. Color was darker than it's American counterparts, small head that didn't laste. It's very carbonated. Smell is a bit skunky and the taste is bitter, without a good finish or flavor to even it out. I don't see this as a good choice for any occasion and I will avoid it in the futre."
"Drinkability - Drinkable in modest amounts. A good second or third string beer. Would compliment savory foods like fajitas or sirloin. Out of pilsners I rate it well."
"D: In all, a surprisingly easy to drink beer, considering all the low marks. This is probably due to its resemblance to carbonated water."
"Final Thoughts: Well, let me start by saying that there are worse beers out there, but this stuff makes other adjunct lagers look good. This isn't just a case of a beer being bad as a result of getting skunked as the only qualities behind the skunking are either boring or out of place. Maybe it would be good with Chinese food, but that's a stretch. You'll want to avoid this offering."
"Drinkability: Not the worst adjunct lager out there. Goes great with Chinese food and is pretty refreshing. Don't look for much in the way of taste however."
"This is maybe my favorite adjunct lager. I know the style is much maligned on this website, but I had to pick this one up for a review. It's a clean, easy going, sessionable beer that I think is definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: Good, light, easy drinking lager with a unique taste that makes me, well, think of Chinese food. My 640ml bottle disappeared relatively quickly."
"Overall: A surprisingly unique beer for the style. Will drink this again for sure"
"Drinkability: It's not bad, but it's not very good. There are better lagers out there to drink."
"Overall: Better than most Asian macros, better than every other Chinese beer I've had, potable but not worth paying top dollar for in a Chinese restaurant unless you're trying to prove how cosmopolitan you are! (In which case you should be drinking rice spirit anyway.)"
"Yellow colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is cooked vegetables.Taste is fresh with hints of barley and malts.Overall very refreshing and smooth.Drinking this ice cold on a hot summer day would be a perfect match.Overall a good beer and something I would purchase again!"
"Drinkability: Easy down but not entirely enjoyable in terms of complexity, would be good to pair with cuisine but not in its own right."
"This is not all that bad of a beer, but should be relegated to washing down Chinese food."
"Easy to throwback. Goes great with Chinese or Mongolian food. Probably not something you'd drink just for the sake of drinking though."
"Overall, something you can pound on a hot summer day, but not what I would choose for its flavor and complexity."
"YAY"
"Pours a pale yellow color, with no lacing, very little foam head, that quickly dissapear, smells like rice and corn, low alcohol volume, very crisp, does well chilled with asian spicy food, had it for the first time at a thai restaurant and loved it with the food."
"Pours a pale yellowish color with a very slight head to it. When drinking there is very little lacing. The smell is of a small amount of barley. The taste is very light and crisp. The taste is pretty weak and watery...it taste like barley a little bit. The mouthfeel is average it isn't very harsh and is crisp and dry. Overall there isn't much to the beer, but it is very drinkable because it isn't overwhelming."
"Very refreshing, actually. It's hard to imagine anybody not wanting one of these on a hot day outside...or, like me right now, inside on a Friday night."
"Decent beer. Wouldn't buy a six pack of it though. Good while waiting on my food though."
"The first ""illegal"" I had at an actual restaurant at Ocean City more than a decade ago...this one is going to be more professionally sampled...straw colored, almost ""light"" in its presentation--an effervescence helps offset thinness and the runny, weak head... yeasty bread dominates with the ping of Saaz hops as its butter--almost hints that something is amiss... presents a bland blanket of smoothness akin to water to the mouth, with little early or late that suggests this is a beer... such a light body leads to an almost phantom taste, a pilsneresque presence minus the snap of Eastern European brew... without really finding blemish, Tsing Tao finishes crisp but not sharp; one senses rice or corn int he tank here, but no skunk infiltrates... stays balanced throughout the 22 oz. bottle, never bitter or malty despite its aroma..."
"Very pale beer with little head and extremely light grainy flavor. It's biased a bit sweet, so I like it. Quite drinkable and with an appropriately clean finish (no noticeable aftertaste), but for my money I'd prefer to pay less with something like PBR."
"Very pale, head dissappears really fast. I don't really like the smell, like of most of the lager beers. Taste is very clean and light. Reminds me a bit of those German Reinheitsgebot-beers. It's refreshing, drinks easily and no bad aftertaste whatsoever, (mostly because the taste dissapears rapidly). It's a simple but honest brew."
"This beer went flat before I was through with it. I am a power drinker and did not sip this beer slowly. Look, I know some comments are inappropriate, but as a well educated business man, I find these comments to not be out-of-line when I say this beer cut corners on its carbonation. It is typical (not a prejudice, but a known fact in the PROFESSIONAL business world and far into the mainstream) that Chinese business are notorious to cut corners. That may work with billion Chinese population, but in America we are subject are own free will and can buy another beer from just about anywhere in the world. I had to knock down my results across the board except smell by -0.5."
"Served in a green bottle at one of our fave Chinese-Japanese restaurants. Pours golden to amber and clear. Aroma is grainy, mostly clean. Taste is sweet, almost doughy - expecting malt or corn and am sensing neither. Unexpected, but certainly not bad. Mouthfeel is medium, heavier than expected. Finish is sweet and this had decent drinkability. It was a little heavier feeling compared to many of its type. It did, however, compliment my sushi rolls quite nicely."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale yellow color with virtually no head, and a very mild aroma. I didn't expect much of a taste but it was actually pretty crisp and refreshing. A liitle bit of sweetness to it and slight aftertaste. Feels light in the mouth. Goes down smooth and is very drinkable. Overall not a bad beer."
"D: An average light lager. Decent with chinese food which is the only time I've ever had, and ever will have, this beer."
"Drinkability is alright."
"Drinkability: Just another forgettable, faceless lager from China that makes me really wish I had some Chinese grub to pair with it. Mongolian Chicken, Pork Lo Mein, Moo Goo Gai Pan -- bring it on. Heck, I'll even go for Broccoli Beef!"
"Notes: It states that this is China's finest beer. Well.with that said I can add that it was certainly not even close to a bad beer,yet I feel China can still do better. It did go well with my sushi."
"Overall: simple and fresh resulting in a quite acceptable oriental beer. Nothing special but better than an average macro lager."
"Nicely drinkable. Something to have at a Chinese restaurant.... But that's about it."
"D - This is an okay lager. Easy drinking but lacks a lot of punch in the flavor department."
"looks quite lovely when poured - a slightly translucent pale yellow with a fresh white head. The head disappears in seconds though. Not much of anything in the nose, though creditable for its genre - no skunkish odour either. Slightly sweet, watery taste, and no aftertaste at all. Overall, an unremarkable but not foul beer."
""
"Pale gold in color with large bubbles of prickle that are mildly active. No head. The nose is very some macro brews like Moosehead or perhaps Heineken, but I believe that Moosehead is the match. There are some grain notes, faint hoppiness, and it is surprisingly more appealing than I had expected. My expectations were pretty low. The attack is consistent with the nose. Lots of grain and faint hops that reads as somewhat sour notes. Very light body and mouthfeel. Prickly aftertaste that dries in the mouth. It is amazing how much it resembles ""premium"" beers from this country but manages to be drinkable."
"Not really offensive in any way, but not particularly good either."
"Overall, this is something I would never want to get again. I would rather have an American macro lager over this. Not my style and not something I'd ever recommend."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, though not very desirable."
"Drinkability: The sweetness makes this a mediocre lager"
"D: Goes with Chinese food decently, as it can wash down even the spiciest and most flavorful of dishes. However, there's not much of a point to drinking it by itself or buying it for any other occasion."
"Overall: It is a good beer that you could drink throughout the day - I enjoyed in both bottle form at parties and while walking around Epcot Center"
"it pours up a clear golden color with a decent white head. decent lacing at first. the nose is pale grains, bready, oily textured aroma, subtle sweet malts. I taste the exact same as the nose with subtle sweet malts, bread, pale grains, very buttery texture. light to med bodied, med carbo. a pretty clean lager"
"In short, the meal in the restaurants is always better with a beer than without, but this beer is pretty mediocre"
"Final Thoughts - I was curious about Chinese beer. I tried this one, and was wasn't impressed. It is your typical macro European lager style. Nothing terrible by any stretch of the imagination. The price tag hurts this one a bit as it runs $9 for a six. I grabbed the 24 oz. bottle for roughly $3 which gave me the chance to try it without going crazy. My friend has tried it in China and they she says it isn't really any different, bonus points do go to the brewery for giving it to you in a plastic bag of sorts."
"Overall, this is palate washer. Nothing I'd ever seek in a six, but at a Chinese restaurant, worth drinking with the cuisine."
"Appearance aside, I am seriously impressed by this Chinese lager. I expected it to be bad, which it was far from."
"Not terrible, but I would never buy this again!"
"D= Very high. Not bad for an adjunct lager. Not bad at all. i would say its better than most other offerings. Still not really a reason to drink this unless your Chinese. There are better offerings of the same style for less money"
"Nikki"
"Its drinkable - easy to have a few, though its not a beer I'd get excited about."
"it did however go very well with the chinese food, so i may consider it again in that situation"
"This is an extremely watery thin brew. I'm sure this aids the ""drinkability"" but I don't like this. All I'm tasting is the adjuntness; tastes fake. Some thin vegetable flavors. Very weak beer. Avoid."
"Paired this with a nice meal at a chinese restaurant and found the beer to be a huge distraction. I should have stuck with a glass of water."
"Carbonation was lower than I expected, which was fine. I would have liked a cleaner finish, but I had no problems cracking open a second bottle."
"Drinkability: Looks pretty funny, but outside of that there are no complaints. This is probably the best of the Asian beers I have had thus far out of a mixed sixer I made from the restaurant I worked at (I picked out Sapporo, Kirin Ichiban, Kirin Light, Asahi, Budweiser, and this).This would definitely go well with Chinese food or sushi- maybe even your typical American BBQ."
"Overall - This is a disappointing beer. However popular it may be in China/Hong Kong, it is a weak excuse for a lager. Uncharacteristic, bland, not worth the money. Once in a lifetime but I wouldn't bother. Had this in Hong Kong. Reviewed from notes."
"Taste falls off from the nose. Flavor is only slightly malty with a bit of sulfur taste back there as well. Hops don't really come through, but an astringent dry aftertaste does. Hey maybe that's lead. Mouthfeel is light and overall this beer a low degree of drinkability. Only 23 more to go."
"I picked up this beer on sale from the LCBO. Pours out a light yellow color, with no head or lacing at all. Looks decent for what it is. Smells like all other macros do, but i will give it a 3 for no skunky smells like many imports have. This has a decent taste, goes down like water, with a touch of bitterness, but not much else. For a light lager, it has a lot more taste than most of its more popular counter parts (coors light/bud light etc). Decent. Also has a much better mouthfeel than most other light beers, nice and full with good carbonation. I gave this a perfect score for drinkability, because since it goes down so easily, you could easily drink this all night. Goes well with spicy food. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: this is a light beer that actually goes well with spicy food. To drink in alone as a session beer, this gets boring very quickly. This has a touch more flavor than some others in the style."
"For me this is a situational beer. Yum cha for Sunday lunch wouldn't be the same without a couple of bottles."
"If you are comparing this like you should to other Macro lagers, this is by far one of the best."
" do not be affraid!!"
"D- Good with a refreshing feeling"
"This beer was sadly bland and wannabe grainy in an entirely non-inspiring way. I drank this from a bottle with a few friends for the first time a few days ago at a Korean restaurant and was not at all impressed with the meek color and watered-down taste. Despite its semi yellow color, which looks like it was added, the finish is over-carbonated and particularly did not pair well with the Korean dishes I was eating it with."
"drinkability: i wouldnt say know to a free one but not something id ever purchase, not off flavour other then overly sweet"
"D: I've had this many times with Chinese food. It is a nice compliment to that cuisine. As a stand alone beer; however, it doesn't do much for me."
"Pours a body that is a pale golden color, looks like domestic fizzy, with a white head, quickly diminishing. Has a sweet aroma. Has a sweet flavor, and the mouthfeel is very fizzy and lively. Very bland flavor."
"D: this is my first chinese beer and not bad. I would drink this over many domestic macro lagers, but still not a top vote"
"This is far more tasty and interesting than Tsingtao Pure Draft, so do not get these confused."
"As a couple others have said, this is by no means the greatest beer in the world. However, it had a couple qualities I really enjoyed. It's an excellent beer to pair with chinese (or any type of food really). Probably a chicken and veggie or lighter meal. Also, It had an extremely light, almost sweet taste to it. Sort of like a snow pea (if you can imagine that taste in a beer). Certainly not a filling beer by any means... so it would be good if you're looking for something you can have a few of in an evening. As for negatives... at first I wasn't to pleased with the smell. It's got a skunky aroma initially. After it breathes for a minute or two, that goes away. Overall, it was a win in my book. It's always at my local Hyvee supermarket, and it's one I'll certainly give another go."
"D: This is simply not a good beer. What taste there is evident is pungent and undrinkable. Pass."
"Paired with spicy chicken and string beans. Great combination with chinese food. A smooth, light, and crisp beer. Not too much more to say. The texture was almost like water. The carbonation got in the way a little, sort of stung my tongue, but it was still good. On a second occasion I had it when I was dehydrated and in desperate need of a drink and it went down just as well the first time. I would say its not a good sipping beer though, when it got the slightest bit warm it became a little less flavorful."
"Ok, this is not the best beer in the world. But it has quite a few pros: This beer is intended to be consumed with food. If you want to have chinese food with a light drink then this one is just what you are looking for! It goes perfectly! It's a typical lager: Crystal-clear blonde, discreet taste and weak aroma. I usually don't drink lager beers but this one I can have by the barrels while there's food on the table. I wouldn't drink it alone though. This beer is what you want to drink when you don't want to drink!"
"Eating Kung Pao I had to have a liquid supplement so I ordered one of these. Out of a bottle the glass was delivered to my table a pale gold color with a fluffy white head. The head retained itself pretty well but there was little lacing to speak of. The aroma was of a typical macro-lager, lager malt and corn mash with some skunked quality. The flavors were a little better, light dry grains, malt and corn with some huskiness, then a bit of citrus rind but the finish was metallic. Reminded me of bad iced tea. The mouthfeel however was light and crisp and it did help to wash down the food. However, with that said I could only imagine ordering it at a Asian restaurant when I had no other alternatives."
"Pours a pale golden yellow that is clear. Has a decent white head that dissipated quickly and left not collaring or laciness. Very skunky aroma, bringing the glass to the nose gave subtle hints of cereal grains. Taste was all skunk and cereal grains, moderate aftertaste. Light and thin on the tongue, with a lot of carbonation. For being a skunky beer it was not terrible, went down like water. Not recommended."
"I could see this being strictly an accompanying drink for Chinese food or other Asian cuisine. Outside of that, I couldn't give it high marks in any category."
"D: A big pass here, finish-able, but not by much with a less then enjoyable fun factor going down."
"A friend of mine brought over some Tsingtao, imported from China. A clear yellow color with a wispy head. Light in the aroma but some lager malt does register in the nose. Fairly crisp, clean and light on the palate. The beer presents mainly grainy and bready flavors and finishes with a light snap of bitterness. This beer isn't too shabby considering the cringes the style ""American Macro Lager"" invokes in some folks. Keep an open mind and enjoy ""China's Number One Beer."""
"Was the only option I had at a Chinese restaurant once and it actually wasn't too bad. Maybe because I thought I'd hate it or the Chinese food masked the flavor. Hay, sweet malt taste, slight trace of bitterness. I'd get it again in the same situation but I won't go looking for it. I have heard of it being skunky, which mine wasn't."
"D- I will be using this beer to hydrate from other beers."
"The wife and I were at an Asian place having dinner on Saturday and the Olympics were on. To salute the Games, I ordered a Tsingtao. What a mistake. Poured into a beer glass. Bright yellow body, fizzy yellow color, and a white head that took a heavy pour to form. Smelled like all macros do. Tasted like old apple juice, or maybe stale iced tea. Gross. One of the worst beers I have ever had. Stay away."
"D: Definitely drinkable, a little too expensive to buy all the time but one of the better Oriental lagers that I've had."
"This one is a good choice for spicy foods of all kinds, not just Chinese. If you must go eat Chinese, you really cant go wrong drinking this. It did help to put the fire out nicely!"
"overall, a fairly enjoyable imported lager. I would recommend it to someone looking for what it is, however if this is not your fancy, it's not so great as to be worth gong way out of your way just to get one."
"A good beer for a hot day. My first beer from China."
"Taste is quite neutral, slightly malty and also maybe a bit too watery. Carbonation moderate. It goes down very quickly and is quite refreshing. I liked it."
"Would have it again even though it's definately not my favorite lager."
"Notes: Overall it's a very easy drinking lager with a modest light flavor. Average."
"It pours out a rather typical straw yellow, not impressive, but the white head is thick and fluffy and hangs around for a bit. Aroma is crisp and malty, typical for a lager. Flavor is malty with a surprising hint of fruit, making it better than most macro-brew lagers. Texture is smooth and pleasant. Not outstanding, but OK, good as a companion to a meal."
"I have never run into an Asian beer I don't like. Tsing Tao reminds me of a weaker version of Peroni, this beer I believe is best enjoyed in the afternoon, while being lazy or just finishing a big project, and want to cool off. Not bad and I always enjoy this one."
"Not bad..."
"It's ostensibly a pilsner-style beer, very light and crisp, with flavors of malt and rice. But there's not a lot going on flavor-wise. Typical macro lager; not worth it for its own merits, but about right if you just need to wash down some inexpensive spicy food."
"From a bottle into a pint glass. Pale muted gold color. An aggressive pour left it with an inch of head. Quickly dissipated to almost nothing and there was no lacing. On the nose the smallest hint of malts. Simple taste of just ""beer"". Uninteresting, but drinkable. Lightly carbonated and very light on the palate. Overall, pretty easy to drink. Definitely the most common beer in Chinese restaurants and I don't mind ordering one."
"Good beer where you least expect it!"
"If I drank this with some mushi pork, I'd be a happy man. Repeat buy!"
"It certainly is spot on for the style. Great beer to enjoy with Chinese food or sushi. Doesn't fill you up."
"I must say, I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this one at a restaurant in Boston's ChinaTown..But..It's surprisingly good! Who would have thought the Chinese brewed good beer..go figure. It makes more sense now, upon learning that Tsingtao was a German possession in the 1900's. The beer itself is refreshing and bizarrely light-tasting for a regular beer, but in an inoffensive sort of way. It's a bit cloying, has some malt sweetness, and faint hops. Decent brew all around. (AB owns 20-ish% of the company)"
"Thoughts: Apparantly equivalent to the chinese Budweiser. I think the China Man Macro is alittle better than the American counterparts, but overall not too impressive. Does well for its category. Just not my favorite style."
"D: I was pleasantly surprised with this one. As far as macros go, this one is top notch. Session!"
"Last night in Manhattan I had a bottle with dinner, and decided it was time to review. The beer looks like any macro lager, clear straw color with a sufficient white foam. The aroma and taste are neutral, easier to detect hops bitterness than malt sweetness, but either way muted. Just a refreshing drink to try to wash away the burn of spicy peppers. I've found coating my tongue in rice helps more."
"D: If it had any sort of taste, I would have rated this one higher. Frankly, I don't think I'll be having one of these again. It's little more than a notch on my beer glass."
"The beer was golden yellow with a pitiful head of a few white bubbles.The smell was pretty grassy and the taste was average in taste. The mouthfeel was lite with a bit of carbonation. It was a beer that went down pretty easy, but had nothing to make it very special going for it. Good if you want a lighter beer I guess."
"Smell is skunky at first, but becomes more grain like after a few out of green bottle. Taste is pleasant - a lot better than I had expected - light malts and grain, not to bitter but a bit sweet. Body is very light and bubbles are present but not obnoxious. Finish is decent with little aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbonation is okay. Has a nice, crisp bite that makes it mildly interesting. Goes down easy enough. But, drinkability is severely limited due to its blandness. Overall, it's not a good beer. Not something I'd seek out."
"Taste saves this beer from utter desolation. There is a slight hint of hops on the mid palate, but by ""mid"" I'm talking in terms of timing, from the first sip to the afterglow of the back palate, not in terms of the actual progression of taste from the first sip to the afterglow of the back palate, since there is actually no real taste. The hops though tell me that I am definitely drinking beer. Apart from that there's a slight cloying character to the mouthfeel which is very unpleasant. Overall, very very little character or anything to this beer. It's bland and pretty unappealing."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a light straw color, forming a thin white head, that quickly fades. No lacing. The aroma is a skunky mix of light hops and grain. The taste is very bland, consisting of light hops and alot of grain. Clean light mouthfeel. As far as drinkability, if you like a flavorless light beer, then I suppose this is your beer. For me, this beer was no better than drinking a warm Bud Light. Sorry."
"mouthfeel/drinkability-My brother-in law brought this for me fron China and if I ever go there I will drink this and the other brands. I have tried this over here and it didnt taste like this. This is a crisp beer you should try. Enjoy"
"Taste is light and crisp, but has a horrible aftertaste not so dissimilar from a typical macro lager, bit more ""skunk"" though."
"This beer poured a nearly clear pale gold into the glass with a thick head that dissappeared almost instantaneously. It left NO lacing. It smells strongly of white bread, and is equally tasteless. It is bubbly and carbonated when you first sip, giving it a light-bodied feel, and fairly dull-tasting as it reaches the back of your mouth. It leaves a slightly sweet aftertaste. There is nothing particularly noteworthy about this beer. It is comparable to a Bud or Coors."
"D - This one is flavorful for the style. Goes down easy. Overall comes across as average though."
"D- This beer goes very well with Asian cuisine. Whether it be General Tso`s chicken or sushi, Tsingtao is always an excellent complement to your plate, but outside of those avenues, I do not drink it."
"Bought this at my local Chinese restaurant just to say I drank it. I should have known better. I was scared the minute I saw a light green bottle. This usually means skunk. It did taste fresh. But taste is minimal. Difficult to get a head during the pour and goes away about as fast as you pour the beer. Clear pale yellow. Taste was kind of malty, not much to say. Really boring. Ranks up there with our macros but less flavor."
"Light bodied and quite smooth. Goes down easy and actually didn't taste too bad with some spicey homemade eggrolls. Certainly tastes better than Bud ot the likes."
"12oz brown bottle with a freshness date of 5/23/08. Pours a light straw color with a 1 finger head, poor longevity and poor lace. Slight honey malt aromas with a touch of citrus. This stuff is pretty watery - even as macros go. Some honey and malt tastes with a small bit of bitterness. Its crisp, light and easy drinking but just a bit too watery - even for a macro."
"Still, if you're seeking a common Asian lager, I'd go with 33, Singha, or even one of the Japanese rice brews."
"I wouldn't go out of my way to obtain. Amazingly, not unduly overly carbonated."
"Very light on the palate, aroma and taste are the same - you could technically say well balanced, but that is just because there is really no bitterness, or sweet maltiness. There is a faint beer/alcohol note somewhere, and perhaps some rice, but maybe it is me looking for something."
"Not bad for a macro, but a bit too sweet for me and besides I'm trying to boycott all things from the people's Repub...so I won't be having another anytime soon."
"Drinkability : bière pils correcte"
"Light straw color and very clear with lots of carbonation bubbles running around. The flavor in this one is relatively light, so there isn't much to talk about. The only thing I can add is I was not impressed by this brew. But I should note the flavor gets better when it warms up. It probably hits the spot when eating an array of Chinese dishes, but as a session brew, there's better for less money."
"Poured out an average straw color, very little head and pretty much no lacing. While it doesn't have a bad smell, it borders just this side of skunky. It has a very flat and bland taste, nothing worthy of note and nothing that stuck out. Goes down fine, as it is, but don't expect much."
"Pours out a still straw color with a thin, meager head. Lots of sulfur and DMS in the aroma. Some malt and graininess underneath the defects. Taste is rather grainy with more of the sulfury and vegetal notes coming out. Has a bit of hops towards the end. The finish is kind of harsh, drying, and tannic. Mouthfeel is bubbly, but not too light. Not for me."
"This one did'nt get reviewed the first time cause of a bad batch,comes in a green bottle and it was completely flat,no fizz no head ,,,nothing.Turned me off.But here i am trying it again,and this time i got a decent batch.Pours a clear light golden yellow with nice size bubbly white head with fair retention and minimal lacing.Nose is skunk upon first whiff which goes away and than it's musty grains and grass with a sulfitio whiff to it.Taste is sulfury,with lite tangy bitterness to it with a faint sweetness comming thru and kinda watery flat finish.Not much there,almost like drinking Coors lite with a little more tang and sulfuric taste.Very lite mouthfeel to this one and watery feel going down.I think i'd rather drink Busch or MGD at a cheaper price.This one didn't do anything for me."
"i'm stuck in china for the time being, so stuff like this is pretty much the standard. though i suppose you could do worse."
"It tastes not like much of anything. Very thin, watery, and slightly sweet. It finishes clean with no aftertaste. Not much point in drinking this because if I want an American Macro Lager I could buy something a heck a lot cheaper with more taste."
"D - Very easy to drink, it would be very easy to drink lots of these on a hot summer day. Also good when you want to have a beer with your meal that won't overpower what your eating and leaves your mouth refreshed, to eat more food or just as easily take another drink."
"Not too heavy, so could drink a lot of these probably"
"Better than I anticipated. I wouldn't go out of my way to pick up a six. But certainly enjoyable in my setting with szechuan spicy beef and crab rangoon"
"D - Pretty damn good! Reminds me of a malt liquor since it's really heavy with creamed corn adjuncts, assertively boozy, and really sweet. I would drink this again in a pinch."
"I tried this beer on August 8, 2007 at a Korean Grill restaurant (Queen/University location) in Toronto. The beer poured a golden yellow into the glass with no head. There was no aroma to speak of...I even had my partner smell the beer and she couldn't smell anything either. The mouthfeel was thin with mild carbonation. The taste was slightly malty with a dry finish."
"Tsingtao is basically like a Chinese macro, similar to Budweiser, which is no surprise, since Anheuser owns about a quarter of the Chinese Brewery. Tsingtao has very little taste or smell. It's drinkable enough, but not something I would go out of my way to get. It's a very clear pour, with little head or lacing. The taste was nothing special, very watery. I was not impressed, but it's not so horrendous that I wouldn't drink it if it was all that was available."
"Edit 12/07: After having another meal of Chinese short ribs, a couple of these went along well. It wasn't as skunky, but that biscuity sweetness was there. It reminded me of a Pilsner."
"I've had this beer for years whenever I went to any good Chinese restaurant that served Tsingtao. On a recent trip to China, this became my mainstay. As one traveling companion noted, this is the Heineken of China, and I guess that is about as spot on an assessment as any I could come up with. The beer is pretty good but not exceptional. The pour is slightly frothy with not much lacing and a quickly dissipating head. The color is light-ish yellow, reasonably carbonated, but not overly so. This is a light bodied beer that is reasonably well balanced hops vs. malt, but you aren't going to get either in spades so the term ""well balanced"" needs some qualification here. The taste is a bit straw, a bit grassy, and with just enough hop bite to let you know there is some substance to the beer. There is a bit of a yeast fizziness to this beer as well and that is an added plus. Tsingtao goes down easy, leaves very little after taste, has a tinge of sweetness in the middle, and has a very light mouthtaste that does clean the palate when eating your favorite Chinese food. I believe the Tsingtao in China is fresher and noticably better in China than over here. L'Chaim"
"Pours like your typical lager. Fizzy and yellow. Smell has some florals in it along with sweet malt, light grassy tones, with a backing of hay and light pomegranate. Taste is crisp and a bit grainy, with a hint of hop flavoring. The flavor is never predominantly much of anything, just a nice crisp clean flavor. Which makes this an easy beer to drink, especially with some nice spicy shrimp or any other hot Chinese cuisine."
"D: Easy to drink, washed down my Chinese take-out, but not something I would seek out outside of a Chinese restaurant."
"D- Not terrible, but not very good, and boring. I may have another in the next chinese place if it's the only alternative to BMC and I'm desperate."
"nice clear light golden color with a large white head that held to a quarter inch then to a ring on the glass with some lacing. light aromas of malt and yeast. taste of sweet malt and yeast with a grainy slight hop finish. medium body, crisp, lots of carbonation, slightly different from the run of the mill macro lager pretty enjoyable beer. good for summer fare."
"Overall a pretty good and drinkable lager. Certainly superior to the BMC grouping."
"D-despite the skunk aroma this goes well with some salt and pepper squid and red vinegar. The carbonation cuts through everything. Still this in no way a good beer"
"Fairly refreshing on the palate, good for thirst quenching. Just a touch of bitterness, but an underlying slight skunk despite the freshness of the bottle that makes this a with-spicy-food-only kind of beer. Not as crisp and dry as one would like. There are certainly better options in this category."
"Beer poured out fine for a macro lager, mild carbonation, mild head, a deeper golden color than many lagers. Smell as others have said, bad. After I poured the beer I could smell it from about two feet away, and it didn't smell good. After a few drinks, I could not even smell the beer with my nose in the glass. Taste was flat, and a bit skunky for me. Mouthfeel very light, very flat, seemingly no carbonation. All in all, a pretty bad experience. Almost as if the beer was on its last breath, and just flat out died 2 seconds after entering the glass."
"Tsingtao was a clear pale golden color with a small bubbly white head. The head quickly dissapated to a thin ring with very little lace. The smell was light grain and a hint of skunk. The taste was light, grainy, and somewhat harsh. The finish was dry. It was light bodied with plenty of carbonantion. Drinkability was below average due to the taste. Save your money and your tastebuds and skip this one."
"D- easy to drink but the smell makes you not want to drink it."
"¡Salud!"
"D: I didn't find it tasty at all and had a hard time finishing it. It's slightly filling for the style. My father-in-law loves this stuff, but I can't understand why."
"Overall: It's decent, better than the typical American macro. Certainly one I'll order next time I'm out for Chinese; I have a hunch it will complement a spicy dish quite well."
"An above-average macro lager."
"Not too bad. Its al little heavy and sweet, but I can see this one being a life saver paired with some flaming Sichuan."
"D - Very average for the style, inoffensive and very refreshing especially with a hottish chinese dish. Would not touch it outside of a chinese eatery."
"Drinkability: What can I say, it's refreshing. Tasteless. Maybe I'll give this another go when I'm having some Chinese. I'll chug the rest."
"Overall, decent if you drink it very cold. Typical for the style. Decent session beer [if your only other choice was a Bud]."
"Mouthfeel: A nice carbonation bite, lingering sweetness with just the faintest sense of hop bitterness. Biting, light, a bit watery, but crisp."
"This pours a light transparent straw hue with a white head and little retention at all. The aroma is rather standard for American macro lagers. with a bit of hops and mail to it. The taste is a bit malty with some bitter hops. It's a subtle yet pleasant taste. It's has a nice balanced feel, a bit more to it that usual and it drinks well with Chinese food. Nice carbonation and it's rather drinkable, balancing out chilies and spices in a good Chinese meal."
"No aroma and no taste, rice maybe, my tastebuds had a laugh with me, I thought it was sweet at first, then a heavy dryness appeared and is all I can comment on, it does stay dry in the mouth, but it is not a beer I could recommend, even with a curry."
"Drinkablity- Nice, easy drinking beer. Good on warm days and with any kind of Oriental food."
"Not a type I would normally drink."
"This offering had no head or lacing. Color was the palest of yellow. Aroma was that of a rice lager. Mouthfeel was light to medium and fizzy. Slightly resinous palate. Crisp, light taste, quite nice for a lager actually. I'd revisit this one; especially if I were out to retire some replicants..."
"Drinkablity: Very easy to drink, good with spicy food. I would recommend it."
"Really bland taste, however. Adjunct, pale malts. Nothing to get excited about. Overall, quite drinkable, but not anything I'd feel compelled to have again."
"The smell is faint. Some pale malt comes through but not much. There's a little more flavor in the taste, but not by much. What flavor is there is a plain mix of grains and a hint of floral hops. The mouthfeel is fairly sharp, while drinkability is decent."
"Drank pretty easy, certainally a cut above BMC & went well with the sushi, the 2, 12 oz bottles went down easy"
"A fairly average lager in all respects. Light in colour and lost the head fairly quickly. Not too much to say about the smell. Taste was pleasant enough - slightly bitter at first, but sweet and crisp through the aftertaste. Reasonably light carbonation gives a pleasant tingling wihtout being overpowering. Goes very nicely with Chinese food or heavy curries, but probably not worth drinking by itself unless you really want to try it that way."
"Yellow bubbly pour. Smells of grains and hops. The taste is slightly bitter up front with sweetness to follow that continues into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit on the carbonated side, but mellowed with sweetness. Drinkable, but not a first choice."
"Hard to come up with much good about this. Basically a typical Asian beer, in the same class with Singha, Kirin, etc. Very light lager with virtually no head or lacing. Strong aroma of grain, and more if this in the taste and finish. Not much to write home about on this one."
"A clear golden color, with a small white head that disappates quickly, leaving no evidence that it was even there. No aroma that truely stands out, biscuity and malt aromas, with a slight scent of hops at the end. The taste of biscuit is there and not much else. It is light to medium bodied, coats the palate, but the carbonation is very strong. The Chinese macro lager is not very impressive, just ordinary yellow and fizzy stuff."
"I guess this is what I'd imagine a Sino-macro lager to be. And that's just a reflection, not a recommendation. It has some fair flavor, and I've had it with Chinese food, an actually willing companion, but on its own it's thin and a challenge to latch onto. It's pretty drinakable, but the billions in China are welcome to as much as they want to drink. I like the food, but not so much the beer."
"It's perfectly fine for a basic mass produced lager. If that's your thing and it's on sale, I'd say drink it. But it's not for me."
"Drinkability  at about $.50 US for a 600ml keep them coming at pace with the lamb kebobs."
"I hope this isn't the finest beer in China, as the label states. A sample like this poorly serves the reputation of such a majestic nation."
"Overall, a decent, easy drinking macro that goes well with Chinese and other heavily spiced foods."
"Pours a pale yellow color that produces a white lacing. Aroma is faint grains and a tad bit of the hops come through as well. Mouthfeel is crisp and light with a heavy dose of carbonation. Not much going on in the taste. Clean, crisp and refreshing yes! But as far as taste goes, it is really bland. The only way I will get this again is if I am in a Chinese restaraunt and it being the only thing offered."
"Light yellow  white head bubble gum, grass, hay nose- taste yeast, slightly malty- creamy medium body aftertaste frothy, crisp Light yellow  white head bubble gum, grass, hay nose- taste yeast, slightly malty- creamy medium body aftertaste frothy, crisp Light yellow  white head bubble gum, grass, hay nose- taste yeast, slightly malty- creamy medium body aftertaste frothy, crisp"
"Taste is above avg in my opinion. Some sweetness but not overly. A nice crisp rice taste and some hops. Very clean and smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation. I wonder why I havent had this beer before? This is a pretty good beer to style (I prefer ales). Maybe I will keep this in the fridge for visitors and let them taste a nice, clean lager."
"Granted, I'm sure I rate this beer on the higher end of the spectrum compared to most, but this is a great ""drinkable beer."" No, its nothing to dissect in detail and analyze life over, but with any Asian dish this one sure satisfies. Not very depthy or complex but a great tasting beer. A nice clean, pine nut, hoppy pilsner taste. Reminds me of a Molsen lager only arriving at a clean bitter hop taste sooner, stronger, and leaving quicker. Tastes much better when cold in a bottle than a somewhat flat, poured, slightly warm beer in a glass. Again, nothing to analyze, just a great drinkable beer."
"The beer pours a golden cider color with a light carbonation. Very clear with almost no head. Skunky smell with a faint sweet aromatic smell. Very faint grainy sweet taste but lacks much flavor at all. The feel is flat and creamy almost coating your mouth. This is not too bad to drink but I would really want to go out of my way for one. There is almost no flavor and the beer is not exciting at all. Id just as soon order a water."
"D = If you can't tell by now, I hated this beer big time. Only thing it has going for it in China is the fact that it is always availiable and damn damn cheap. Avoid it folks."
"Not terrible, not good, very US Macro like in flavor, but was fine with the spicy Mongolian food I had it with."
"Not only does it taste like water but the mouthfeel is similar to that of tonic water going flat.The feel of this beer on the palate is very bland, It goes down way too easy and is probably one of the worst beers that I've ever had. I will never buy this beer again, and I will encourage others around me not to buy this beer, it is not even worth a penny let alone what Asian restaurants charge for it. This is by far one of the worst macros I have ever had."
"It's innocuous... a good pairing with Yum Cha I found... helped me wash down the chilli sauce... but I wouldn't go out of my way to drink it for the sake of it."
"Tsingtao pours a light yellow with a white head from a green twelve ounce bottle. Smell is grassy and grainy, perhaps a bit skunky. Definitely getting both grassy and grainy tastes. This is an average macro style lager. Nothing to particularly recommend it."
"Basically average all around; nothing particularly redeeming. Only worth having if you're out at a restaurant and there's nothing better."
"What you taste first with Tsingtao beer is the sweet, grainy flavor from the malts. This taste is a little bit bisquity and a little bit like rice, with other flavors that seems like a touch of honey has been added. This is followed by the crisp taste of hops."
"Geez... Horible smelling beer. Obviously suffering from light strikenness. Very skunky, but I kinda expected that from the green bottle and the lacking seriousness of American Macro lagers. The look is an ok straw with fading head retention. Once I got past the aroma the flavor revealed a grainy, oily, vegital flavor similar to rice cakes. A decent amount of dms shines the way into the finish. Not a particularly pleasant experience."
"Mouthfeel is watery, finish is crisp, but the aftertaste lingers... Carbonation is fine. Despite its flaws (or perhaps because of them) it's pretty drinkable, especially when washing down some Chinese food, but doesn't have a whole lot of appeal on its own."
"D - Just a very average macro."
"Pours a very light clear yellow with a perfectly white head that lasts fairly well and leaves some lacing at the top of the glass, though this doesn't last. Smell is pretty standard green bottle lager, though with less skunk than is perhaps to be expected. Light hoppiness and some adjuncts round out the aroma which, if not stellar, is certainly passable. Taste is slight, a mild hop bite over the light maltiness and nothing offensive to put me off. Mouthfeel is crisp and light, and, while it's pretty thin, it suits this beer well. Drinkability is pretty good. Obviously the perfact match for Chinese food, but not a bad lager on its own."
"Overall: A great balance of hops (aroma, flavor, and bitterness) against maltiness and carbonation. At present this is my favorite pils/light-lager; I would place it in the German Pils category."
"Very light body, watery with some fizz in the mouth, where's the alcohol in this one? Goes down like water (almost looks like water as well), I will think of this as an Asian Pilz...? Good hot weather refresher, maybe a squeeze of lime?!"
"Overall, it's not bad for what it is. If at an Asian restaurant with a limited beer selection, or if you order Chinese food, it's a good selection (otherwise I would not recommend it so much, as it is, in the end, not anything special.)"
"Overall: Not bad, but no aspect of it stands out in my mind. Although it's forgettable, it would be a great summer quencher."
"Overall. I wasnt expecting much from this beer, but its not so bad. I'm pleasantly surprised... one of those beers you dont think about getting ever, other than trying just to say you've tried, and finding it rather enjoyable. But dont get your hopes up too high."
"Opinion: Well, I have drunk this beer a lot in China. Somehow it seemed to taste better there, but this may have been because I was dying of thirst. San Miguel is really common over there also, and I would normally pick that one over this one. In some bars, there is a very short shelf-life version of Tsingtao that has a higher ABV and has a better flavor. This one is OK, but not one that I will drink much of in the states."
"Although it's nothing to rave about, I'm surprised how drinkable this is. A macro style lager with some actual character, wow. And a good pairing with Chinese food."
"Verdict- Just when you start to sort of enjoy the flavors, they disappear in the finish."
"I wasn't really impressed with this beer at all. Admittedly I will drink it at a Chinese restaurant but did not enjoy it without eating food to mask the blandness of this beer. It pours a clear yellow with an initial head that disapears quickly and completely leaving no lacing on the glass. It has a slight skunky smell and rice aroma. It has a slight sweet flavor to it, with minimal hop presence. I didn't even want to finish the one bottle I had."
"Poured from a bottle into a Pilsner glass, it's an alright looking beer for it's type. The head is alright, but the lacing is almost not there, which is to be expected. The nose is a very mild touch of hops. You really have to look for it. The taste is very average. Very similar to Czechvar (Budweiser Budvar), except without the distinguishing grassy flavor of the Czech pilsner. The mouthfeel is unexceptional. Thin, but that's to be expected. It's an alright beer. Perhaps just not my style, but other than it's averageness, it's got nothing going against it. It could be easiliy consumed en masse if there weren't anything better around."
"Taste- Very mellow malts with some light yet springy hopping. A lot of plain grain flavors e.g. rice."
"Had this at the Peking Duck House in Chinatown in NYC. As I expected it was a thin, watery, pale brew that had the faint skunky aroma that accompanies all green bottle beers. Was otherwise unremarkable. Aroma was faintly hoppy , but mosty sweet adjuncts. Taste was mild, watery with some cereal grains (mostly corn/rice and dough) notes. litttle or no aftertaste. Just overall a bland brew. Drinkable? Kinda, sorta, yes, but why drink this when there is so much better available."
"The body is light and weak. Really there isnt much touch overall but it is easy to drink. So I might sing tao, but I will sing thanks."
"Rather watery looking with some initial head. Passable aroma and taste. Not a great rating, but above average for its style. Canadian yeast and barley you say? Crisp and slightly better than expected. Maybe good Yangtzai water.Thanks to the broken 6-pak LCBO bin."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy!"
"Pours a yellow color, some carbonation, small to no head, some lacing afterwards which does not hang around long. The smell is kinda sweet and skunky. The taste is a little malty and watery. Light body at best. Drinkable, but not by much. I would not recommend this at all."
"Pours pale straw, with pristine clarity. One finger head fizzles out quickly and leaves no lacing. The aroma is overpoweringly light-struck, and blocks out any other odors. Sweet pale malt, corn, and rice flavor, soon overwhelmed by skunk aftertaste. Typical light body and high carbonation, mouthfeel slightly acidic. Finishes fairly clean considering the spoilage from long exposure to light. The bottle version is seriously flawed by the time it reaches my local beer store, but I'd love to try some on tap to get an untainted sample."
"Pours a light straw color with white thin head that dissipates quickly leaving nothing, no layer, nothing. Also nothing in the way of smell, except a lot of skunkiness. Some bitterness, but no maltiness or anything in the flavor. There is a weird flavor on the back end, not sure what it is, but it isn't good. There's a lot of carbonation burn, and real thin mouthfeel. This isn't very drinkable, but not the worst I've had. It's pretty far down on the list though."
"Appearance is a clear straw color; head is average and recedes quickly. Little to no lacing on the glass. The smell was OK -- slightly sweet. There's a good amount of carbonation and a slightly fruity taste to the beer. This beer goes well with chinese food, obviously. It's not extraordinary, but is good for one or two with dinner. Aside from that, I wouldn't really go out of my way to have one."
"This brew pours a clear pale straw color. The head is two-finger in height, white, and recedes quickly. The aroma screamed of skunk when the bottle was first opened, but the skunky aroma vanished once the beer was poured. The aroma from the glass is midly sweet, and by mild I mean as mild as it can be. The taste is milder than the aroma, if that is even possible. The mouthfeel is to style; light bodied with a lot of carbonation but not too much. Overall, this isn't the worst macro lager I have ever had, and it isn't horrible. However, I have had better macro lagers, and know they can have more flavor."
"Nice medium-gold colour, not much head, but the carbonation is pretty, and this beer dosen't look flat at all. It seems to have travelled well in that green bottle, because I'm not getting the bad skunkiness that most Euro Lagers have been giving me. Smell is pleasantly malty, a bit sweet, but just a hint of cooked veggies to make you realize that yes, this is a macro lager. Taste is sweet and bready, mildly alcoholic, very lightly hopped. A bit watery in the mouth, but the carbonation helps you forget to a certain extent. This would be a decent light-tasting lager to put back a few of while downing Asian food, especially the spicy variety."
"Drinkability/Overall: Easy enough to drink but I wouldnt pay for one again."
"can I say my mom forced me to drink it? Ok I took it as a duty to review it, not the worst I had but in my top 10 of the worst unfotunately."
"Worst tasting beer I've had in some time. I was mildly optimistic after the pour. Looks nice in my mug, but holy dinah, does it taste terrible. Drain pour. Avoid."
"Drank at a Chinese restaurant. Was a little worried about the green bottle. Overall, a decent beer. Was pleasantly surprised. Poured a clear yellow with a thin film of head. Scent is light. Some light grains, grassy and floral hops... No skunk. I guess the bottles were stored properly. Tastes plain, but good. Sort of like a bland, decent, thirst quenching homebrew. Light, sweet crispness followed by a small amount of floral bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit dry. Overall, a drinkable session lager."
"Tsingtao can take its place among the worlds best German beers in this class. Tsingtao beer is a great German beer that just happens to have been brewed in China"
"Lite and fairly tasty, this makes for a decent drinker  had several with dinner, and they all tasted the same."
"I would imagine this would be a good beer to have if having some spicy Chinese dishes, when you would down several during a meal - it is not at all heavy or filling. Any other time, however, I would stay clear of this."
"Overall, a non-descript beer. It's verging on being offensive and undrinkable, but it's not quite that far gone."
"I had a bottle here in Berne yesterday when visiting a Chinese style foodcourt and almost had a shock .... the distinctive taste, this smoky bitterness, of Tsingtao was there however very diluted and watery. My suspicion is, Tsingtao is using a 'milder' (or in other words watery) style for export. Sad .... the original Tsingtao would earn a 3 ..."
"Definitely drinkable if you're in the right mood or having Chinese or spicy food."
"Overall = I did not enjoy anything about the beer. In fact, I'm dumping 3/4 of the bottle down the drain."
"It poured a straw color with a head that didn't stick around all that long and left no lacing. The beer smelled sweet and had a taste on the sweet side as well. I got a lot of grain flavors and a surprising, although neither overpowering or negative, sweet character from the light mouthfeel beer. It went down really well with the chinese food I had ordered at the restaurant and something that I could imagine being pretty refreshing on a hot day. All and all, this isn't a bad beer at all. I am pretty surprised with the level my level of enjoyment with this one."
"The taste seems to compliment chinese food well, and goes down pretty cleanly with a bit of sweetness to it.. and ends with a slightly bitter aftertaste. It's not an amazing beer, but it is a very ok beer, especially for the fun of drinking a chinese beer in a chinese restaurant. As a side note, I've heard that this is easily the worst of the Tsingtao products, and that the ones they keep in China are vastly superior. Not sure if it's true, but makes me wanna try one all the same."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color lager with a small bubbly white head with minimal retention. Aroma of weak malt and hops with bad case of skunk in the back. Taste is pretty inoffensive apart from the bad case of skunkyness. You have to wondered why they import all those crappy lager into North Amercia"
"Composed of sweet grassy notes, some malt, a hint of skunky sulphur, bitter hops and bread. Medium body, light carbonation  seems to be designed to compliment Chinese Food, and I usually order one when at a Chinese Restaurant."
"One was enough...it was on to a tawny port with dessert anyway :)"
"Not a great lager, by any standards. It does however have an odd taste all its own. Almost indescribably weird semi-sweet malts, and some rather lackluster hops. Fairly nice, sweet scent though. More flavorful than many macros, but not really in any good way. I don't think I'll be coming back to this one anytime soon."
"The taste is also sweet, almost a little sugary. Very, very faint hops at the end. The mouthfeel is typically thin for this style. Not a bad beer to chase down a spicy dish of Kung Pao Triple. It is not much different from other Chinese, Japanese beers I have had. Pretty straight forward, nothing memorable, but I think that is what they are going for. A good drinkable beer."
"Served to me at a Vietnamese restaraunt in a glass, the appearance was golden, with a good amount head which quickly fizzled. Not distinctive smell, except a slight sweetness. Taste had a noticeable sweetness, similar to a Miller High Life. No remarkable characteristics, a rather thin but passable mouthfeel. Matches up well to spicy food, but not as enjoyable as a Thai Sigha. Decent with a meal, but that's pretty much all it's good for."
"I was expecting quite a bit more. Perhaps this bottle was a bit old, but it tasted exactly as it looked - like piss. My bottle poured with absolutely no head and was a horrifically ugly yellow. Far, far worse than the budcoorsmiller trifecta. For a mass produced lager, give me one of those over this any day."
"M/D: Very clean feel that is something I could drink again, especially with Chinese."
"Nice beer on a hot day, but I can think of about 10 micro Am Lagers that take this to school."
"I poured this one from a bottle into a pint glass. Must be an old picture of the bottle and label on the website, mine is different looking. This beer pours a very transparent golden yellow color. Practically no head retention and not much visible carbonation at all. Quite a poor looking beer by any standards. The nose is a little skunky, but not too overpowering. The taste is not bad, definitly better than the appearance. Somewhat skunky at first, yet the finishing taste is a little bland. The mouthfeel is watery, but what else could I expect? I'm not sure if I could down a whole lot of these but one or two is not bad. Not good but not the worst beer I've had either."
"Pours crystal clear like an adjuncy should. Nose was a little bready with faint grass and malt. Not a single skunky iota of smell. Taste was bubbly and crisp. The adjunct must be rice, there was no corn taste. Thin mouthfeel as expected. Man this goes down easy with spicy or sweet sauces. Nice beverage, not for my fridge, but I do enjoy it with my Chinese repasts."
"Sampled at the chinese restaurant at Epcot in Florida. It poured a pale yellow color with a 2 finger, light and bubbly head. The nose was slightly grainey, with a ever so slight hop. Nothing really special. The flavor surprised me a bit. There was almost a gingery tinge in there. I found it very refreshing with some honey seseame chicken. The feel was moderate with a healthy carbonation. Also, very refreshing. Much better than I had expected from the initial pour. I would probably visit this again when dining on some general tso's."
"I definitely would recommend this with Chinese food. Otherwise, I'd say it's about an average beer. It's not incredibly remarkable."
"Ut vivat, crescat, floreat!"
"Had a few of these brews at a PF Changs restaurant. Its basically an everyday common lager, with a bit more malt flavor than most. Bright yellow color with a respectable head and a grainy smell. Theres a little sweetness up front and a spicy hoppiness in the mid-taste. The beer goes well with food, and is fairly drinkable. Light and airy, simple, and not really any flaws. Unfortunately, its also average and uninteresting."
"Drinkability: I don't know too much the chinese beer scene, but it seems to be typical to the asian macros. Drinkable, but not exactly an exceptionnal product to compete on the world markets."
"Nasty. Talk about a skunky macrobrew. Pours a very light yellow with a bit of white head that is gone very quickly. Smells of skunky hops, and not much else. Tastes like watered-down american macrobrew, but has a strangeness to it that I cannot identify. A unique tinge of flavor, perhaps resulting from the regional Chinese ingredients used. Mouthfeel is almost like a sprite - extremely carbonated, but not much else. I guess it's drinkable, if you can stand the taste."
"At first sip, it tastes like many cheap euro-lagers. But after a few more, it's better character comes out. Light-bodied feel, bread-like malt flavor, backed by hops, slightly sweet (but not too sweet) crisp finish. Reminds me of Bitburger. I imagine it would go great with spicy Oriental dishes. This is what American macros should taste like."
"I'm not quite ready for a 6 pack, but I will have have it again - maybe for Chinese New Year's (Feb 8th and 9th) - and raise my glass of ""Green Island"" beer to the start of the Year of the Rooster!"
"The mouthfeel and drinkabilty are solidly average. The beer does hold up well to spicy food so that is a point in its favor."
"What to say about this beer? it is unusual by domestic stand points or even most international. while i isnt horrable it does leave a bit to be desired. Moderate flovor, not weak, not potent. About this biterness of a back, but with not as clean a flavor. All in all not a horrable beer, but one i cant see drinking every day"
"Rather drinkable if you need something refreshing."
"Clear gold body, small fizzy white head. Smells of skunked grass malts, and not much else. Taste is thin and weak, only a couple hints of grassy malt breaks through the watered down flavor. What's the point of this beer? Get american macros that are better for less."
"Pours a pale straw color with a thin spritzy head that leaves decent lace. The aroma is mostly of grassy hops with crackers and a slight malt sweetness to balance. Theres also a distinctive yeast smell. The taste is somewhat hoppy with a dry firm malt base. I think I detect rice flavors. The mouthfeel is light bodied though quite crisp, I guess from the yeast strain/and or carbonation. This beer is hoppier than most macro lagers and is therefore better (to me)."
"I will often order this beer when I am at a Chinese restaurant and it compliments various dishes well. A nice alternative to a Heineken or Budweiser. If I am at a store and searching for a 6 pack this is very rarely a preference."
"Big foamy head at pour that hangs around too long. Pale straw color, and generic ""beer"" smell. Hard to get a good sip out from under the hunka foam. Taste makes me yearn for the more complex flavor profile of a Budweiser. After some effort, I can taste a little malt sweetness and a slightly bitter aftertaste. To paraphrase the old stereotype, it takes much less than an hour again for me to be thirsty... for a real beer. Again, it doesn't taste bad per se, just has no taste at all."
"Drinkability- The sweetness ruins it for me. Had it with my freshly made Korean Beef with noodles and it slightly spoiled my dinner experience. Should have stuck with a nice sweet wine instead of this so-called beer."
"Green 355 mL bottle with no freshness date."
"""Pale straw body with a crackly, wispy white head. Gotta love green bottles...Gee, I wonder if this has anything to do with these skunky aromas pouring out of the glass? Actually, the skunk isn't too bad, but it's there. There's also some light, cerealy malt, and a touch of true, low-key hops. Goes down with some lightly sweet malt up front, followed up with a very modest dose of balancing hops. Not bad. Could wash down some good Chinese food, although I'd prefer a good pale ale or IPA with some spicy Szechwan. I can't see buying this again, unless at a Chinese restaurant, or back in China, where this is one of the best beers there. Trust me, it's way better than some of the cheap swill you'll find in dirty, 20 oz. bottles..."""
"Taste: Mostly grains, and slight hop bitterness, and very faint floral taste as it warmed. Drinkable, but not too good. Don't really care for this one."
"A good pale lager, great little refreshing session beer, great with chinese or indian food"
"Drinkability: I wouldn't drink it outside a chinese restaurant. Not a very good drinking beer. On par with Michelob Ultra in my opinion."
"Tsingtao is a barely drinkable adjunct lager that would leap into the undrinkable category if consumed at greater than 55 degrees. Maybe I was able to consume it with my Chinese food all those years because my love of spicy dishes deadened my taste buds to the beery depredations of this close-to-nasty Far East import. Stay away."
"My first new beer in quite a few weeks, and I picked a fairly good one. Of course, it would have helped me to get this beer if only I'd known that its name is pronounced ""J'n-tow"" but the server didn't have too much trouble figuring me out. It pours a dull golden-yellow with a slightly off-white head that's not too thick or lasting. The smell is sweet and fairly generic, without too much of a distinctive character. This beer starts exceptionally smooth - especially for a lager - and then settles on the tongue with even amounts of sugar and cinnamon-like flavors. It is medium-bodied, though almost light-bodied. The finish is the most unusual part of Tsingtao. Once the somewhat weak flavors of the beer are headed to the back of your throat, a practically over-powering alcoholic flavor invades your mouth. On my first mouthful, I compared it to Listerine."
"I have searched far and wide and have finally found a lager I truly enjoy. Pours a golden yellow with a white foam cream head that is quite impressive. Lacing is thick and foamy. The smell is of grain with slight skunk. Hints of earth and slight malt. The taste is smooth and sweet. The grains have a sweetness to them that is quite unusual. Almost caramel grains. Slight bready taste, the sweetness is creamy and refreshing but still light and lager like. Cleans the palate well. The most drinkable lager out there. Goes great with Chinese food, great cooking beer as well."
"Drinkability- This beer went really well with the chinese food I was eating, even without the food I could imagine drinking quite a few of these. However, at Tsingtao's normal price there are better beers to buy and many of equal quality that cost less. Still, I imagine having one again with chinese."
"Not skunky like euro-lager, nor corn-swilly like the usual north american suspects, I could deal with this next time I'm eating chinese food (or better yet, thai) if pressed. Remarkably unremarkable, and the spicier the food pairing the better."
"there's really not much to this brew, and i expected more as i remember it being more flavourful in the past. pours a fairly clear golden colour. not american macro clear, but not much better. minimal to no head here rfom a vigerous pour. the smell was of straw, grain and corn perhaps. there's somewhat of a dirty smell and flavour here too, which makes this one, whilst more flavourful and fuller-bodied than an american macro, less appealing to drink. i've had far more enjoyable asian brews than this one. certainly nothing special. thumbs down."
"This is definitely an asian tasting beer, which isn't really a good thing. Strong rice flavor along with a semi sweet taste, a little like sugar added to a beer after fermentation is complete. The body was nice and full but there wasn't too much in it. The aftertaste was atrocious, like said before: a sweaty sock. This might go well with a rice dish b/c of all the rice in it."
"Actually not nearly as bad as I expected. This beer goes down pretty smoothly as long as it's cold; my only objection is the sweat-like aftertaste (yuck). It has a pleasant color, only no head to speak of. I guess the old idea that it ""goes well with Chinese food"" held true, although it's not a beer I'll buy again."
"-Oelergud"
" Not an outstanding import, but I enjoy this with spicy Asian food."
"This beer exceeded my low expectations for it and was better than I recalled."
"After the St. Bernardus Abt. 12 I had earlier today, I'm definitely finding my feet are now firmly back on the ground."
"Always super drinkable with Chinese or Thai food, a reference brew for a class I call ""Asian Pale."" Asian beers are just different; really need their own classification."
"Perhaps if it was ice cold it wouldn't be so bad, but as for now, it just isn't for me."
"Very pale straw colored body with a frothy white short lived head fed by fake carbonation. Clean grainy malt smell with notes of grassy hops. Cloyingly sweet diluted corn syrup like taste is pretty bad. A touch of hops in the aftertaste make this a bit more drinkable than it would otherwise be. On par with mass produced beers from the big three, and only worth sampling as a novelty. My Chinese friend at work handed this to me as a free sample. I would not buy it, and Ill have to try to get him to sample some of the better pale lagers so that he wouldnt either."
"yet another international pale lager. holy moley it smells like someone ran over a skunk in alexgash's kitchen when we cracked open this thing. I've never smelled a more skunky beer. looks like all the other lager, pale's. Taste is a pleasant surprise, however. A very sweet tasting lager. Sugared bread or cereal dominates. No adjuncts and pretty drinkable. If only the skunk was gone this would be a mighty fine pale lager. I know that's not saying much..."
"Very pale yellow color. Clean (no floaties) and almost clear appearence. Pours with a big white head but it does not last long and does'nt leave much if any lace. The only aroma I got from this beer was a light sweet kinda grain smell. I could dissern no hops at all. The taste was again lightly sweet at first with a touch of bitterness and the sweet grainy finish. I was not impressed because the flavor does'nt stay with you very long."
"This isn't bad, but there are many other better choices (even if you limit yourself to pale lager). Why bother. It looks like your basic lager, pale yellow but it does have a decent white head. Not much retention or lacing. It smells like your basic lager, a little bit of sweet malt with barely a hint of hops. Taste is much the same, mostly sweet with not quite enough hops. I suppose it's drinkable because there isn't much to it. But I have to admit, I'd probably take a High Life or a Grain Belt Premium before this. Maybe I'll try this again at a Chinese restaurant, but I usually default to Sapporo. I don't think this is better."
"It's ok for a production beer."
"The archetypal lager color a bright gold, typical head modest and bright white, frothy in texture, the lace thin. Nose is quintessential lager malt and crisp, start is sweet, top is cadaverous. Finish is moderate in carbonation, hops apropos to the style, not a very good beer by any countries standards, but they sell a hell of a lot of it."
"Had this at a local Chinese restaurant and I will make sure to never make that mistake again.Pours a straw color with not much head aroma was kinda skunked with some grainy aromas popping thru faintly.Taste is pretty bland some corn flavors with a very light fruitiness but not much here at all a light malty aftertaste but not much here.Seemed a litttle watery not much here a waste eating space."
"The beer poured a pale, yellow color, and had a decent white head. However, the head didn't last much longer than those stupid crappy ""snakes"" that you light on July 4th and that are supposed to grow, but really only leave a smoldering, stinking mess. The aroma was mild, a little flowery, not much malt in the aroma. The taste was very much like honey, almost meadlike--not sure if it was because the bottle wasn't a good one (I was drinking it with other people who had it before and said it tasted off). I didn't mind the honey, though, it enhanced the mouthfeel, but this beer is still one I wouldn't go back to, other than in a chinese restaurant."
"12 oz green bottle. Served at PF Chang's in PBG. Medium yellow to light golden pour. Dingy rocky off white head, lasted for a few sips then faded. Some nice smells of bready malt way in the distance, mostly wet grainy smells. Some crisp lager like tastes, not alot of malt. Spicy hop presence toward the end, bitter and crisp. Somewhat muddled flavors, but somehow faintly refreshing. A decent lager, not much more. It will be a long while before I reach for another one."
"A nice looking golden lager with minimal head and very little if any lacing. This beer didn't have a strong smell but that's not really to be expected with this style of beer. The taste was bold and mellow with a nice crisp taste, a little flowery and grainy. Still a decent beer and again goes well with a asian oriented meal."
"Popured a clear yellow colour with quite a bit of carbonation and a thick head that quickly disapates. The scent was grainy, yet flowery. There was detection of hops and malt. The taste was also very grainy with flowery hop accents. The carbonation was a little too strong for my taste, but it wasn't that bad a beer. Good with a chinese buffet."
"This beer poured a crystal clear golden yellow color that was well carbonated. It produced a white fluffy head that lasted only a short moment before it fell to almost nothing but a thin ring. There was some lace detected. The aromas that I detected were of grains, sweet malt, hops and flowers, very light over all. The tastes were more distinct and detectable, flavors of hops, grains, husks, some light malt and dandelions seemed to be the only things that were stand out. The aftertaste was very light, some hops were noticeable, but did not last very long. The body was light. This beer to me was surprisingly crisp and clean, and quenched my thirst well. Over all impression is very light in aromas and the tastes were decent but non-lasting, which in some circumstances is a good thing. Probably a fairly good beer on a hot day."
"For me, Tsingtao is one of my favorite Asian beers. It's especially well suited for spicy Asian dishes. Paired off against most American macros, I'll take a Tsingtao every time."
"Overall, a decent beer that you can use to wash down a meal with, or use for beer drinking games."
"Nice choice if better opportunities dont present themself. Nothing spectacular however."
"Head to head with Molsons Canadian and Golden, this beer has the full-body of the Golden and the dry, quenching bitterness of the Canadian. A good triangulation I would say. Toasty, buttered grain flavors are delivered without any condescending sweetness. Hops are unobtrusive. Decent Lager in a pinch."
"I have a soft spot in my heart for Tsingdao. It brings back a lot of good memories of my visit to Zhongshan last Christmas."
"Well...like everyone else it seems, I had this while out at a Chinese restaraunt last night. If anything, it paired ok with the curry chicken I had, but in drinking and reviewing before my food was served, on it's own (i.e. not drunk while eating), it's not quite a beer masterpiece. Here goes: Pours a clear golden with no head, you can watch the bubbles float up in the glass. The aroma was of musty, dry cardboard. Thankfully, it didn't taste that way, but my notes say that the mouthfeel was thin, and the taste was sweet, but soapy....Don't run out and buy this one. If you are at Chinese restaraunt, and want to drink 'locally' aah...I guess this'll do. It was ok to drink while eating, but overall, below average. pat"
"2 - goes well in hot weather - tonight is hot, so it gets a favourable review. Otherwise its just run of the mill."
"Carbonation is there in the mouthfeel, but overall the feel is light. Nothing worth seeking out it comes across as a Heineken modification, but it works well with Chinese food. I like having beer from the same country as the food - so I'll probably have it again."
"Just had with a Chinese meal, and it is a very good choice for one. Pours a very beautiful golden color, unfortunately the head disappears almost instantly. Not much of a smell, a little whiff of alcohol. But taste is quite good, light and refreshing, tastes a little like rice. Clears the palette and accompanies salty Chinese food quite well. Not bad overall."
"Poured a very clear yellow gold under absolutely no head whatsoever - just a few short-lived bubbles a la soda. I detected no smell at all at first, but then picked up a bit of ricey malt. The mouth was light and very prickly. Sweet rice and malt attack the tastebuds at first, chased by some hoppy bitterness. The aftertaste is mainly malt, with just a touch of bitterness. Thanks, but I'd rather drink Stella!"
"as i said earlier, i only drink this coz it goes well with duck. apart from that i wouldnt drink it. the tsingtao premium in the gold labelled bottle is much much better."
"s.d."
"It kind of tastes like an interpretation of miller high life, with an odd ultra sweet chemical metallic taste. Not terrible, but certainly nothing to go out and buy. Definitely not worth imported price, but it did compliment my mango shrimp nicely."
"Light color full but quick disappearing head, full but not distinctive aroma, highly bubbly absolutely no sftertastehas texture and mouthfeel of a light beer. Very simple totally loses flavor with food, almost like seltzer water. It does however clean your mouth so you can enjoe your Chinese food.A gulping beer strictly for quenching thirst."
"This bad tasting average macro aspect beer is nothing short of pisswater with a spin on the bitter end. Sharp and ugly flavour probably suiting the chinese politburo but not my capitalist, high quality demanding arse. Pour the next one, mao! cuz along this production line, the next youd expect is another revolution!!!"
"Appearance: Pours a clear straw golden fizzy hue with a bubbly short lived white head, absolutely no lacing to note here. Aroma: Some rice is definitely evident a spritzy sweetness without any real character to it. Taste: It does do well with spicier Chinese dishes but I would still rather have something else of better quality myself this is a beer produced toward the masses and meant to be light refreshing almost without taste. Some adjunct ridden sweet tones with a quite simplistic hop character just a touch there. Mouthfeel: Thin just like carbonated water no difference to me. Drinkability: A beer meant to be consumed in number not enjoyed for each beer's flavor but the mass produced Chinese beer that sells the most."
"Mid-yellow, vanishing white head, and no lace. The smell was strictly skunky and of rotten veggies. The taste was horrid, being very metallic and of a flat-natured lager mix. The feel is watery and acidic. Ugh. Why would anybody import this? Oh, yeh, for BAs to review."
"way too many ""off"" flavors for me. i generally like pale lagers, but not this one. seems to have a funny, peanut-like aftertaste. it's pale, very carbonated (think chinese rendition of heineken), but i just don't like this one. very few redeeming qualities. even most chinese restaurants have SOMETHING better."
"If this were not skunked, it would have its place amongst the more drinkable ""fizzy yellow beers."" Still, this is crisp and somewhat refreshing, and although this is going to sound cliched and predictable, I would recommend it with Chinese food or other Asian cuisine (it seems like its made for that type of food)."
"This beer pours a light golden color with a small head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly skunky and unintersting. The flavor is somewhat skunky - reminescent of Heineken but slightly better. It's a little sweet and fairly crisp, but still not very enjoyable."
"Not a bad beer. Not spectacular by any stretch but it will do just fine. Pours to a dense white head that falls to fine ring and clumps of white bubbles. Aroma is of hops and sweet malt (adjuncts, too?) finishes dry and clean. It tates like it would be a good choice with Asian cuisine. Better than Sapporo or Asahi."
"I had the choice of this, Heini, or corona, all for the same price at a chinese restaurant. I thought i should go with the chinese brew. I wasn't expecting much from this beer, and i didn't get much from this beer. Lager is hardly my favorite style of beer, but i found this offering to be fairly inoffensive. The light golden appearance and the fluffy white head were unimpressive. The taste was a little grainy and yet sweet with pretty good carbonation. No flavors bothered me, there was just nothing there to impress me. Basically this is a pretty inoffensive/good enough beer. I don't think i would ever go out of my way to find it. But I won't mind getting it at a chinese restaurant over the more common alternatives."
"Green 640ml bottle with no freshness date. Although I usually order this when eating at a Chinese restaurant, that's usually the only time I buy it. This was an exception, and without the ethnic meal partnered up with it it seems pretty mediocre. Pours out a very light clear straw colour, with a big bubbly head which dissipates after a few minutes leaving no sign of lacing. Nose is a bit skunky at first, then sweet with mellow hops. Taste is a sweet biscuity malt and light floral hops. Sweet yet crisp. Nothing exceptional, but goes down smooth enough if you're going to be drinking more than one (or two or three) in a sitting. Best with hot weather and Chinese food."
"Color is a pale to clear yellow with a small white head, some very small tight lacing. Smell is faintly sweet and some grain as in bread thats soft in the back. Taste is clean and sweet with a grainy backing thats lightly bread-like and finishes with a small bitter hop bit that drys slightly. Feel is light, crisp, and clean with a sweetning thats light and finishes slightly dry and bitter from hop. This was very refreshing to have with my mildly spicey thai food. Would settle for this over many other Asian imports."
"Poured out gold/straw in color with a medium white head. Smell was awful skunk and corn what a combonation(no pun intended). Taste was just about the same, it's a chinese version of bud. The mouthfeel was crisp with carbonation not bad the only good thing it had going. It's a good thing I had some food to cover up the flavor of this beer. Will only drink this again when at a chinese restaurant or if forced to drink it."
"This brew was a very light clear golden color with an impressive head that lasted for about five seconds. A small ring was left around the edges but that too was gone half way through the beer. This beer had a grainy smell with hints of corn and not much else. The taste was very light, I really couldn't find anything specific, very bland. It was kind of like drinking carbonated water. The aftertaste was terrible, very skunky and just weird. The mouthfeel was extremely thin, this just wasn't an easy beer to drink. I would not drink this beer again."
"Overall, a decent beer, but with some off flavors and aromas that just don't seem right. Why use green bottles?"
"Still, I continue to order it occasionally at Chinese restaurants and will probably continue to do so."
"The Budwieser of China. This is a macro all the way. Very faint hops and little maltiness. Dry in character. A little skunky. Grain aftertaste. Quite bitter. If I try this again I want it ice cold. I recommend this if you want to see what the Chinese drink."
"Feels light in the mouth and its drinkable..I bought this to go along with the Szechuan chicken i prepared at home..it does a good job with this spicy dish"
"It's pale yellow with a foamy, white head. The smell is par for the course lager. Coming in green bottles, it frequently has just a hint of skunkiness. The taste is not bad, but just a bit on the grainy side. It does pair well with spicy Mongolian barbecue, or at least better than the big ones."
"This is probably my fav Chinese brew. My grandfather got me hooked on it after he brought it home from a chinese restruant. They wanted $18 for a sixer of it!!!!! Instead, I just went down to the local grocery store and got it for $8. Anyways, it's a nice pale yellow color with a short lived white foamy head. You can definately taste the rice in the brew. It does have a small hint of skunk, but it's really not that bad. It's very smooth and goes down very easily, even quenches your thirst. I guess the only bad thing about it, is that the money goes to the commy government of China. Oh well, it's still a darn good brew."
"this chinese lager pours out a clear golden color, with a thin head and leaves the slightest of lace. aroma of pleasant floral hops, followed by a hint of green bottle skunk, mixed with a grainy goodness. although from china, the taste follows the usual euro lager flavors; providing a slight twist by being a little more grainy and alcoholic in nature, while still seeming light on the palate. overall it seems pretty clean and quite refreshing. i'm guessing that this would be a proper beer to wash down some hot and spicy chinese food, and it would take more than a few to quell the fire, as i like my chinese spicy! would be good with mexican and other tex-mex dishes too."
"A grainy malt aroma, nothing special. Dry grainy palate with deeper flavor than ordinary Macro brews. Highly carbonation but lacking head. No bitterness or floral aroma. Would be a better beer if it came in a darker bottle and had more hops. Decent beer, but no need to go out of your way to try it."
"Pours without much head and the carbonation is low. Pale colored, this is really a lawn mower beer and not something you want after shovelling snow again. Slightly sweet but with a faint skunky nose. The drinkability is high because it is a smooth brew."
"Lemony gold in appearance with some active carbonation but virtually no head aside from delicate lacing along the sides. Smell is reasonably strong with grain and floral notes coming through. Taste is somewhat flat, however, with dry grain flavors ruling the day. Mouthfeel is rather firm and a bit too persistent for my taste. Still, this is a drinkable beer that would be a fine choice at your favorite Chinese restaurant."
"Tried this beer in a Chinese restaurant. I wanted to try a Chinese beer and it was the only one on their menu. It pours a golden colour topped by an average white head that disappears quite easily and leaves no lace as you drink the beer. Aroma consists of malt. Taste is quite average with nothing special to offer. It's an average to poor lager."
"Pours a clear pale golden color with a foamy white head with large bubbles that quickly dissipates. Aroma of malt and grains with some floral hop notes. Flavor is a bit unusual. A sweet maltiness is present but it is blended with a bready, grain-like taste, and something else I cant quite identify. Finish is clean and crisp. A good partner with spicy Chinese takeout."
"Just an average pilsner knockoff. No great malt taste here, and just the faint presence of hops. Goes good with Chinese or Thai food, mainly because it sets the moodOther than that, just a novelty."
"Poured golden in color with a white foamy head and a lot of carbonation present. Aroma was pungent with a feint hop scent. Mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated. Taste is rather bland, with a stale dry finish and hop bitterness. I wouldn't mind trying this beer again with food, but by itself it is rather boring."
"Golden color with small foam that disipates quickly.  Average pilsner.  Nutty smell and flavor with a slightly bitter initial taste.  It's good to add to Chinese food...go figure."
"A very average pils.  Mimics the American Standard in everyway.  It is a refreshing, but lacks any substantive hop or malt presence.  Could be drank in quantity on a hot day.  The green bottle lent to the light struck aroma."
"Green bottle... you have been warned."
"Sharp and peppery up front, then dissipating into a smoother sugar coated malty finish.  Very similar to mainstream Amerikan brews, only maybe a hint of added flair.  Not worth the added tax in my opinion.  If someone offeres me one of these in a kind gesture, I doubt I would object, but I would never spend my money on this again."
"Clear, tawny yellow in color with a big-bubbled foamy bright-white head that holds well, eventually dropping to a collar but keeping a misty foam across the surface from rising carbonation. Light aroma of grainy malt with some hops way in the background. Medium-light body with a spritzy mouthfeel. The flavor is of a mild bready malt that's well backed by hop bitterness. Very clean, with an interesting character that I can't identify. Finishes crisp with a short-lingering medium-dry maltiness. A very nice beer; free of flaws and with a unique character. Certainly worth trying as it delivers much more than its appearance promises."
"This is my mainstay at any Asia (Chinese) restaurant in the Boston area, I know it is quite fresh and clean the palate well with some grain and crisp carbonation. It holds onto a slim sweetness as well."
"Very pale and clear color, decent head but with large and even bubbles.  I couldn't smell a thing in this brew, maybe a trace of skunk.  Body is very light, malt is OK in flavor -- not great but in the category of a fresh loaf of white bread with sugar on top.  Watery finish, not crisp.  To me, there's not a lot of hop, what's crisp to others is dying flavor at the finish to me...why spoil Chinese food with this, when a great IPA can clean the palatte?"
"Pale gold, crystal clear with a flood of CO2 surging its way to the surface.  Good head for the style.  Doesn't last long, but CO2 continually keeps a layer of lace on the brew.  Very little smell or taste.  This however, means there's nothing offensive, but nothing special either.  The taste it does have is a bit sweet and malty.  Not really an enjoyable beer, but a good palate cleanser whilst enjoying a Chinese buffet for dinner!"
"TsingTao: From China. Pours clear, with a slightly dark yellow color, no head to speak of. Malty/sweet aroma. Some skunk. The taste is sweet malt, with toffee flavors as the beer warms up. Dry finish, with a hint of sweetness. Very light body, but with a whiff of skunk that really takes this beer down a notch."
"Pale straw color. Medium light body. Mild bitterness. Mild malt. Mild hops. Dry. Reminscent of fruits. Pleasantly and clean with a refreshing carbonated note and lingering bitterness. Better than Bud, but definitely a beer for light weights."
"similar flavor to Heineken, but more skunky. Slightly nutty and hoppy but you will never know because the skunk-ass green bottles will kill it for you 75% of the time."
"The sparkling, clear straw hued brew is covered by a large bubbled head that exhibits better retention than typical American megaswill.  Light grainy notes and a touch of a spicy Saaz hop nose along w/ generic sweetness.  Hop bitterness is above the norm for the insipid style while the mild bready grain notes are fairly pleasant. Corn flavors are thankfully absent, but the body is typically light due to the apparent large percentage of rice in the grist. Tsingtao finishes crisp, clean and cleansing.  Yeah it's bland, but I'll take this over a Bud anyday."
"It always goes well with Chinese and other Oriental food, but I can not imagine myself drinking it somewhere in a bar:)"
"A sickly looking pale yellow colour with a foamy, white head that morphs into a mildly lacey ring.  The smell is a turn off, musty, raw, wet-grains perhaps, but noticable almost two-feet away.  Little taste with weak malts and non-existant hops.  The feel is airy, but a light shade of medium bodied.  Drinks better than I thought, compared to other far-east beers anyhow.  Probably best with a meal, Chinese, eh? I drink in the name of beer."
"Note: Some reviews say this goes well with spicey Chinese...IMO, I don't think so I had the real spicy sesame chicken, and it still tasted gross..."
"i agree with michael kennedy, extremely dirty unclean flavour and a dirty sock sweetness, quite horrible, i wouldn't even drink it when eating Chinese food, repulsive."
"Clean and crisp appearance. Light to medium head.  A little floral and hoppy smelling.  Taste is clean, with nice hops to malt ratio. Almost a little sweet. Kinda fizzy."
"Drinkability/notes: Quite refreshing and easy to drink, a warm weather beer."
"No head to speak of. Overly carbonated. Smelled like armpit. Tasted mediocre at best, slightly sweet and hoppy. A bit soapy."
"I would not buy this beer to bring home and enjoy on it's own, but I have no regrets about drinking it paired with the appropriate cuisine."
"A decent light lager. Slightly sweet with a faint hop character. Went well with Thai Penang Curry."
"I think you guys are being to hard on this beer. If it smells funky, you got a bad bottle. Get it from a store that knows how to treat a beer. Yes this is very light but as a light lager style beer it is good. When it is fresh it has a wonderful floral aroma that works perfectly with the slight malty sweetness. Is it the best beer I ever had? NO, but it has light charater that I will definately drink again."
"I dunno - are we drinking the same beer?  I thought this might pass for lightly beer-flavored soda water."
"Notes: A most unique sweet lager, and it stands apart from most imports as a result. It goes great with Chinese food, but even better with Chinese chocolate treats, waffers and freshly bought Chinese pastries."
