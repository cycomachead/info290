2.77,6.1,3,2.75,2.75,2.75,2.75,"Brew pours a clear straw-yellow in color with a thin white cap. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of some grassy grains with a light hint of corn. Pretty much the same is said for the taste as well. Lighter-bodied with above average carbonation, that is why all the tiny streaming bubbles. Drinkable but that is about it. Nothing special and is cheap BUT then again you get what you pay for. Typical 'American Adjunct Lager' brew actually with some better than others. Not my type of brew style.","BeerWithMike","Mar 12, 2015"

APPEARANCE: glittering, shimmering golden body; snow white head that frizzles swiftly; sudsy inadequate residue... AROMA: toasty, oaty malts that pluck the nostrils; a secondary biscuit and sweet malts; slightly pungent finish... PALATE: oily, slightly effervescent; overall, a clean glass-emptying kind of lager ...TASTE: sweet, corny and grainy, with a malty base; not very balanced, with the ping that suggests a 40 oz.... OVERALL: when it was 36 cans for $10 (with a $5 mail-in rebate), it was a winner; now, its primary function is lining the top part of my beer fridge to keep its coldness; a mostly tolerable, predictable, unimpressive lager that only goes well after a few better beers have been consumed...","dacrza1","Jan 13, 2015"

It's crisp, with a slight frutiness and subtle crackery sweetness. Nil bitterness. No hops. It's the kind of beer you drink when you just want a plain ol beer. Style wise, when compared to it's peers, it's certainly the best among them. I'll take this any day if my options are Bud, Miller or Coors.","Living816","Dec 03, 2014"

Unlike other beer “finds” in such stores, this didn’t appear to have been sitting on a shelf for a long time, and was pretty drinkable for what it was. By no means was this something I’d tell someone to seek out, as it’s pretty interchangeable for many other, similar, beers, but for the same price I’d buy it again.","woemad","Nov 18, 2014"

Lots of bubbles streaming up to the top./ Nose is faint light grain and a touch of cooked corn. A bit of hop herbal and perfectly clean. No fruity esters whatsoever. Just lovely. Taste is crisp with some firm carbonation. Light sweet grain, cooked corn that is sweet and delicious. There is a touch of mineral or metallic on the palate but it's from the water. This finishes dry and with a nice little bitter to tease you into more and more. Light smooth mouthfeel and you could drink this beer all day.

The basics that you'd think are the bare minimum for a beer, but many of the most popular brands seem to almost TRY to sink below that. This, however, is a great go-to inoffensive lager. I can honestly say I enjoyed it. The extremely light colour worried me at first, but the lacing on my glass mug was decent and it had more taste than it looked like it would.

The aroma indicates classic cereal grains with an accent on wheat and an inference of some light lemon. Not all that bad if you’re thinking in terms of light and refreshing. The flavor brings out somewhat watery citrus wheat. More cereal grain and It’s not offensive in my estimation, but it’s clearly a drinker for the driveway and burgers, a light refresher with a peppery idea that is aided by a lively, fine carbonation. But it is light bodied and other than the carbonation it’s pretty much watery stuff. It’s a standard cereal brew and it’s fine to pound these with the boys but clearly it leaves a lot to be desired if you want to truly enjoy a tasty beer.

It smells like bad cheap beer, sickly sweet grain and corn, alcohol and sweat socks, but perhaps there is a nostalgic element related to that ungodly combo that renders it better than horrible.

There's a time and place for every beer, and I think for completely relaxing and doing nothing this is just fine. It's a basic golden lager. It's well-made. It could use a little more maltiness, and a little more hop flavor, but it's really just fine as it is. There are no flaws to it, and it's an easy-drinking, gently hopped, clean golden lager. And that's my review - I'm not going to go into the clarity, color, aroma and so forth because I don't think it's really necessary.

Quite fizzy and straw with a lot of carbonation. Head retention was fair, but efforvescent. Aromas of part-malt / part-grain first took hold, while German hops, sulfer, fruitiness, and cereal grains follows up. Flavors bring in the malt-grain balance, but the hops fell behind, allowing the sulfurs, esters, and a light vegitable character to gain strength. A carbonation prickle lifts the beer off the toung, and is perhaps its saving grace. The beer is quite thin, astringent, and grainy otherwise.

Though light, the malt flavor that is there is pleasant and is accompanied by some yeast and a very light touch of citrus on the short finish. It has a thin body, watery texture and lively carbonation. Not one Ill be having again anytime soon, but you can do far worse.

Taste is acceptable; grain, corn, mild malt and some hops all have a moment with the palate. The mouthfeel is typical of a lager, mild and smooth. A decent level of drinkability.
