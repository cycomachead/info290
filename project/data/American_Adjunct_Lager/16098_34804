2.99,13.7,3,2.75,3,3.5,3,"when this first came out, i kind of liked it, being a juvenile in my beer palate, and definitely preferring it to a corona (still do). it has less of the chemical off flavors of the other large scale island lagers, and is really pretty easy drinking. so yellow and bright and clear it almost looks to have a green tint in some lights, and while its real well carbonated, and cant hold much head. its smell is its worst feature to me, adjuncty and sweet, but the flavor is better, it drinks clean, and there is no residual weirdness or metallic tang to it at all. the carbonation is outstanding, and the refreshment value is high when its cold, but the clear bottles lend to skunking quickly, and if yours isnt real fresh, its probably terrible. i like the marketing, i like having an alternative to corona for that purpose, but for some reason this beer gives me brutal hangovers. i can drink imperial ipa all night, but three of these and im in trouble in the morning. not sure what does that...","StonedTrippin","Feb 24, 2015"

Ostensibly, I was expecting something of a lighter lager with tones of flavorful lime and refreshing hops, something I could easily down on one of these summer nights. Unfortunately, this is one of the most unremarkable beers I've tried in a while. The flavor is indicative of extreme amounts of corn and cheap grains, so much so that the "Margarittaville Brewing Company" label couldn't be further from an idea of what the final product actually tastes like. It is beyond and bland and almost entirely tasteless outside of overpowering corn. To make matters worse, my bottle wasn't as chilled as it could've been, which proved bad for about the first nine or ten ounces but detrimental and nearly undrinkable for the remaining two or so. For the brewing company's bestselling, most mainstream beer, it's surely a miserably tasteless and needless offering.","SteveJeremy","Jul 09, 2014"

Taste has no off flavors as well. Slightly malty, and lime flavor of course. Mouthfeel is thin bodied and lower carbonation than average for the style. Overall its just a smooth, easy drinking lager that fit well with the scene, and great weather.","BoozySmurf","Apr 13, 2014"

2.33,-11.4,3.25,2,2.25,3,2.25,"Overall I wasn't a fan of this beer but I thought it was pretty close to being and average example of the style, this isn't a type of beer I would buy, but there's a good chance I would order one at a mediocre Mexican restaurant. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, not filling and pretty crisp, but the flavors couldn't hold my attention, one is enough for me and its a little hard to get through the whole bottle without just chugging it to get rid of it. What I liked the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it wasn't bad and it was fairly true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was the aroma, it was way too skunky, but that's what happens when you put a a beer in a clear glass bottle. I wouldn't buy this beer again unless I was out to eat, but even then I would rather order a Negra Modelo, I would recommend this to die heart Corona drinkers but that's it. All in all, this beer is about the same as I remember it, not horrible for the style, but nothing that I enjoy drinking, I think Jimmy Buffet needs to stick to the music and leave the beer to the pros.","StoutHunter","Jun 18, 2013"

Also, killing the bottle cost and using a "plain" bottle and label may help cut costs to increase actual quality. While the appearance and mouthfeel are actually not bad, the funk smell and awful taste are bad enough to cut into my overall. This shouldn't be bought.

Taste doesn't have the citrus but it has the grass and some mild malt. And there's actually a slight bitter aftertaste nicer than you get in most BMC lagers. This actually isn't bad for a cheap lager. Mine was brewed in Missouri instead of Florida so I don't know but maybe the brewery and freshness made a difference.","MoreThanWine","Nov 30, 2012"

Pours a light, clear orange-yellow, thin white head dissipates quickly to a ring around the glass. Unsurprising adjunct and malt aroma with a hint of skunk at first. Flavor starts out pleasantly enough with light, sweet malt and faint hops but the adjunct components soon dominate and then abruptly, all flavor is gone. A very watery, bland finish that took me by surprise. Fortunately no skunking to the flavor, although that may have added a little interest to the finish. Mouth feel thin with light carbonation, but appropriate for the style. Gets extra half point for being pretty much what its packaging promises. No off flavors and would do on a desert island. Glad I got this beer and brewer ticked off; my first reviewed American adjunct lager! Moving on…..","LiquidAmber","Jul 28, 2012"

There's a small amount of lacing. It smells like sweet malt, corn, and that's it. And the taste is the same as the aroma, it's all sweet malt and corn. It doesn't taste bad, but it's not like it's good either. Mouthfeel/body is light, it's certainly not hard to drink at all. For the style of beer it is, it's not bad. It's worth trying if you can get a single can or bottle, but I wouldn't ever buy a 6 pack of this. With that being said, I wouldn't turn it down if someone gave me one.","bluejacket74","Jul 14, 2012"

There is some good malt sweetness with zero aftertaste. The taste is not complex, and this will cause Landshark to get low scores from craft beer drinkers, but I would recommend this beer for people who normally drink light beer, but want to try a regular beer.","JackMatthew","Apr 12, 2012"
3.95,50.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I'm not sure I find it helpful or relevant when folks rate a beer like Land Shark and use a language that clearly shows that they are comparing it to darker or more full bodied beers like reds and browns. I respect your opinions, but in my mind rating a beer does not mean you rate it as to the preference of the beer type you prefer. Would you compare a Riesling to a Cabernet? Of course not. Can you imagine rating a Riesling and then saying you detected no tannins? If you are going to compare or rate Land Shark Lager, then wouldn’t it be better to compare and rate it against other light lagers? I like reds and browns better too, but certainly not on a hot summer day. Sometimes I just want a lighter beer so I can eat my burger and then go out and toss the frisbee around on the beech. So compared to other lagers of similar weight, Land shark is a darned good beer. It has a hint of citrus, grass, and just a tiny hint of grains and corn—just as a light, refreshing, thirst quenching lager should.","carolinacastaway","Apr 11, 2012"

Anyway, it pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of white froth. The nose (how is this not skunked!?) comprises rice, hard water, and a touch of what may or may not be grass. The taste brings in more of the same, along with the lightest possible addition of wheat, and a mild, almost fruity sweetness, though this is also decidedly light. It's not necessarily bad, but the almost nonexistent nature of the flavors doesn't do this beer many favors. The body is light, with a moderate carbonation and a watery feel.

Color was a pretty lemon-yellow with lots of CO2 bubbles and NE-quality clarity. Nose was as close to awful as I have put my schnoz near in a while. It smelled like a combination of slilage (fermented corn cobs stored for pig feed in the winter), which I CAN abide in the style, but it also had a metallic twang which makes people think that it was caused by the CAN rather than the brewing process. Mouthfeel was unobtrusive, just better than watery, surprising, given all of thee carbonation in evidence. The taste, however, was not too bad. It was very sweet, like candy that uses corn sugar, but it did not evince the metallic smell I noticed on the nose. It tasted like a sweeter version of a style that I have tasted many, many times over. Finish was moderately sweet, but overall, it was a pretty boring beer.

Drank from the bottle, so the aromas were almost undetectable..cereal factory smells maybe.

There was a head right after the pour, but it completely disappeared after a few short moments leaving a rather unimpressive glass. The beer had little flavour.

Aroma has some sulfur notes and a bit of citrus and something reminding me of bubblegum. Taste is mildly citrusy with a very thin body and lots of carb with a crisp finish. Everything about it is your typical american adjunct except for the fruit/citrus factor which maybe is the "island lager" aspect of it.

Given the fact that we were rather dehydrated, the Pale Ale was certainly not the type of beer we wanted to be drinking due to its lack of thirst quenching capabilities. The Landshark on the other hand hit the spot. It has low alcohol content, thus causing less dehydration, and little flavor to speak of making it more refreshing, like water. I wouldn't suggest sampling this brew, as you would an Imperial Stout for instance; nor would I bother to pour it into a glass.

Smells light, but sweetly of part-malt / part-adjuct, giving a moderate grain and vegetable aroma. Flavors closely mimic the aromas with a grain / malt combo. Corn flavors are quite pronounced, along with a buttery note that can't be overlooked. Body is quite firm, but riddled with adjuct sweetness and oily.

Fairly decent bready malt flavor with not much bitterness to speak of. Thankfully nothing like Corona. And while nothing to write home about in the complexity department, I enjoyed the rich simplicity of the taste and the buttery slickness of the malt. I'd definitely buy this again--especially for a BBQ party on the deck. And yes, I may try a lime. The bottle, after all, has a nice Corona-style neck that would work very well for that.

It tastes pretty much the same, and to be honest, it's not that different from Corona. Medium bodied... soft carbonation... I don't have one to try side by side, but the Landshark seems a little sweeter... it's just begging for a lime to cut through it and balance it out, and there's even a suggestion of lime flavor to it already, and I wonder if there's something added.

A-B could have re-marketed Tequiza as this and I would have been pleasantly surprised. A good beer for a beach day or Florida BBQ, but at $7.00/6pack, little reason to not just get Corona. The Jacksonville edge gives it a little taste of the tropics, but it lacks the originality of the craft beer it is meant to be.
