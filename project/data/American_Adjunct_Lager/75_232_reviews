"Salud mi familia (Dominique Torretto)"

"Any beer that requires a lime wedge or salt added to it (or anything else for that matter) isn't worth the time.  If a tall corn stalk could take a piss, it would smell and taste like Corona."
""
"Great beer. Very refreshing on a warm day. Salt and limes are necessary"
""
""
""
"Added a lime at recommendation of the bar tender... Pleasantly surprised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The clear bottle prevents skunking."
"From the bottle with a lime (traditional, right). What's to say about the Look - it's light golden. Smell is  citrusy on a hot day at the beach, the only place I drink it, and the taste is smooth and refreshing with the lime. Smooth - medium bodied with a pleasant taste. Overall best for a hot day at the beach."
""
"This is overpriced crap. The only way I can enjoy one of these is when it's ice cold and with a lime wedge, which covers up the bad flavor. Tastes like urine when served normally. This has no business being as expensive as it is. I'd rather drink Keystone Light than this overrated swill."
"Awesome w a lime.  I could many of these on a hot day."
"Complete, absolute, and utter skunk."
"It's ok.  I prefer modelo"
"O: If it is hot, you're on a beach, and someone is giving this away, go for it. If it is any other scenario, why are you drinking it?"
""
""
"You know, on a nice summer day outside on the beach I just like to have a corona"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall : Faint flavors but good freshness. The sugar is good and does not feel artificial like most macro brands."
""
"Pale yellow, bad smell, like skunky smell."
"I don't care, a good ol fashion care free corona & lime didn't do nobody no wrong"
"Enjoy"
""
"Any beer requiring fruit to enhance the flavor isn't good."
""
""
""
"Best beer you can get"
"Looks nice in a glass but your high expectation gets killed by the, as other said watered down taste."
""
""
""
"Utterly devoid of taste, yuck!"
"There is a place and time for these"
"Coronas look great but they have a horrible smell and horrible taste. Definitely at the bottom of my list."
"Awful.  Need I say more."
"Looks ill. Tastes watery. Inconsistent carbonation. Even fruiting the beer doesn't help."
""
"Looks like piss, smells like piss, and tastes like saltier piss."
"Its like having sex in a canoe: fucking close to water."
""
""
"Not horrible, but not a preference either. Smells horrible, but taste fine. A Mexican version of Budweiser and about the same taste wise."
""
"O: Beer for the general public, not for beer lovers. It´s good for mixing."
"Not great, but better than other in it's class"
"bad bad boring bad bad"
""
""
""
"Skunk city in a watered down fashion."
""
"Thank God for limes, other wise this would be undrinkable."
""
"Did someone piss in a bottle and mark it beer?"
"Has a nice solid straight up look. Smells refreshing, to most the taste is going to be an acquired taste aka you'll get used to it."
""
""
""
"If you have to add something to mask the bad taste, then it sucks. that being said, ice cold with a wedge of fresh lime, this is hard to beat on a hot summer day.  Take the lime and hot summer day away, I prefer piss warm chango"
"O:  Avoid this beer.  Nice mouthfeel can't make up for everything else."
""
""
""
"even lime can't help this"
"Favorite new beer to sit around and get drunk on."
""
""
"Its the best beer ever created. Its always fresher wen u get one from mexico in T.J mexico"
"Refreshing beer, with very little taste, it is similar to American Lagers. Nothing special"
"Not a great beer, but refreshing during the summer."
"Light & refreshing.  Decent in the bottle with a lime."
""
"Tangy taste with a lime in summer, unusual sweet taste"
""
"Even when I was a youngster and didn't know any better, i still never pick this beer. The only reason i did a rating is to have a accurate list of beers I've had. I get sad looking at the bottle.lol"
""
"Less offensive than Budweiser, Coors, Miller or Bush.  But let's put it this way -- if Corona isn't a drunk Mexican's piss in a bottle, it sure as hell tastes like it.  The fact that people only seem to drink this beer with plenty of lime or lemon juice added is a testament to how undrinkable this beer truly is."
""
"Not bad easy to drink, I could knock a couple down at some dive."
""
"Very light and tasty.  I like mine with a wedge of lime and a healthy pinch of salt.   Not for beer snobs, but perfect for a hot summer day."
"It's good for summer parties and with lemon."
"I remember the first time I saw a girl nekkid. I was glistening with joy and excited about the fruits I was about to partake of. After it was over I thought to myself that was the greatest thing ever. Then i met a real woman and saw her nekkid and she blew my mind and I totally forgot about the first girl.  Well Corona is the first nekkid chick I saw. Forgettable"
""
"Good beer that you can find anywhere"
"Corona is my go to for a good mexican beer. It's not great but prefer it over del sol"
""
""
""
""
"Acceptable Lawnmower beer. If thirsty enough and need to operate machinery"
""
"God awful regret buying it"
"On a hot summer day.....on a beach......with a slice of lemon or lime."
""
"On a hot day, a cold Corona is a beautiful sight with that golden color and the sweat beads collecting on the bottle.  It's not heavy.  It's not a designer beer. It's not an IPA, but it's got a great taste and it's perfect for quenching a thirst built up in the August Mexican sun."
""
"Corona has its place - best enjoyed while floating around on something inflatable, with a slice of lime jammed into the neck. Sampling this beer from a glass was strange. It is no better or worse that your usual macros. Suited for quenching thirst - end of story."
"Slightly better than water, don't see the attraction, light beer has more flavour."
""
"Had one too many at a friend's birthday party, otherwise wouldn't dream of purchasing this shite."
""
""
""
""
"An okay beer but way overpriced."
""
""
"T: Like skunk. Using lime and serving ice cold can cover some of this."
"this beer is pretty good."
""
""
"I don't have a problem with this beer. It's best to drink on a beach. Lime needed for better taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hard to belive that I used to like this!"
""
"It is real beer or another drink?"
""
"So I am not afraid to say that I truly enjoy a corona with lime on a hot summer day!  With that said - I tried it without a lime and it was really tough to drink.  Skunky, murky and strange.  I will continue to drink it in the summer at times but it makes me wonder what the lime is covering up…  I would give it a 3.25 overall with the lime but I am trying to just rate the beer here and I think I may have been generous ;)"
"Reviewed at long last, one of several consumed over the Christmas break in Cabo San Lucas. An embarrassing previous staple of mine and the sort of thing you want to kick someone for daring to drink here, yet loaded with nostalgia and primed via years of social conditioning that says ""skunked corn actually tastes GOOD""! Everyone knows the color but for posterity's sake its bright yellow and has pretty minimal white fizz rimming the glass. Smells like creamed corn seasoned with a nondescript apple-like fruitiness due to under-aging with a dash of skunky marsh vegetation. True to form, I do find this to be the corniest of the mainstream Mexican fizz parade, with corn bread and DMS cooked veggie flavors running the show. Sweeter and breadier than Pacifico with subtle apple and citrus notes. Some people claim they can taste a hint of lime in this even without the iconic wedge added. Sure, although its probably a mirage.  I'd actually say the carbonation is moderate. Thin, watery, and finishes predictably sweet with a bare hint of grass. The corn and skunk elements do add some character than is missing from American examples of the style (but see my above remark about conditioning. Don't mistake this preference for ""good beer""). Most people pay little attention when drinking this but I suggest you do so, for educational purposes if nothing else. Skip the lime too, at least once."
"Refreshing; very refreshing like water"
""
"330ml clear bottle.  not terrible.  sweet grain & corn with a light, ugly bitterness"
""
""
"I will not drink this beer unless there are no other choices."
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer for a restaurant outing, not spectacular, but it's fine enough for what it is"
"Solid lager fare. A little better than similar American offerings in my opinion."
""
"Smells like cat urine. Tastes wicked awful, like sex in a canoe on a river near a water treatment plant. But not as bad as Bud light."
""
""
""
"Though it's not the best beer, it's comfort food for us Left Coasters.  Simple, almost a light beer in disguise."
"Corona’s very light in taste, mild, clean with no bitterness and has a rather thin tasting watery feel. It’s flavour is minimal, but on a hot day it quenches the thirst."

"I can't understand how people drop $24 - $26 a case on this beer and then proclaim it's something drastically different and superior to the traditional American adjunct lagers. This is a subpar beer, overpriced and bland, and would be commendable for its sole purpose to be consumed on a beach with a citrus wedge if it wasn't so astronomically expensive. Modelo, while by no means great, is much more flavorful and heavier - probably why it's not as big of a sessionable beer (although its sales blow Corona out of the water at the particular liquor store I work at)."
"Most refreshing beer when its not skunked!"

"I see this is rated lowly. Once again, i don't really know what you all are comparing this to. It doesn't remotely compare to Sierra Nevada Pale ale or  Any of that. compared to budweiser and others in its class its a step up."

"I created an account and gave this beer a 5 simply to try and offest all the terribly negative reviews. This is a mass-produced pale lager. It's not going to be anything like your supah-fancy exquiste craft brews. Alone, without the customary lime, it is sorta nasty and smells skunky. And it looks like straight up piss. But add that magical slice of lime- make sure to squeeze out all the juices, I mean really lime it up, use a gigantic slice of lime, and BAM, you have a kick-ass refreshing beverage. Sure- it's not really the beer we are reviewing at this point, more of a beer-lime shandy type thing, but my god, it is refreshing and delicious. Tell me a better beer to put a lime in. This blows Bud Light Lime out of the water. It is cheap and refreshing. Also, by sheer chance, my review averaged out to a rating of 4.20. Blaze up fellow beer advocates. And suck my lime flavored dick for dissing on Corona."
"O- If you have a warm day on the Gulf of Mexico, a white sand beach, and a lime, you have the perfect time for a Corona. Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to obtain this brew."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 1C). Bottle 35.5 cl - Batch LA 040915. AROMA: faint sweet and corn’ish like aroma. very faint hop aromas. APPEARANCE: pale straw color and translucent. thin white head with poor retention. TASTE: extremely watered down cereal flavour. low bitterness with a dry finish. no hop flavour. PALATE: thin body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a watered down premium lager that lacks the ""premium""."

"If there's nothing else around, it is beer, in the most technical sense."

"Probably the most overrated, overhyped, and over-marketed beer of all time. The popularity of this beer proves that  strategic marketing can sell millions of beers, not the taste or quality of the product. The brew has a watery,sour grain and flat taste that can be rather repulsive. People that defend this beer always say ""you have to drink it with lime!"" I understand where they are coming from, the lime masks the bland taste and adds some flavour. Lime should never need to be added in order to make a beer tolerable.  It amazes me how popular corona extra is and how they try to position it as a premium brew.  This is proof that marketing and presenting a certain image with beer does NOT reflect a quality product."
"I certainly agree with others on this site that Corona is not good beer.  It is a very tepid AAL, and not much more can be said about it.  The color is a light yellow.  A couple others said it looks like urine.  They are not wrong.  I drink it at my local Tex Mex joint on Corona Thursdays. Special low price, as it should be.  I wedge a lime in the neck of the bottle to pretend there's something flavorful about this beer.  But there really isn't.  Aroma is not rotten vegetables, though.  It's just faint corn grains, nothing special.  No head to speak of.  The taste is weak, but smooth.  Mouthfeel is acceptable.  It's an acceptable, mediocre beer.  You can drink a few at a time and it's not going to faze you.  Get it on special and wedge that lime in.  Enough said."

"If you NEED to add an actual fruit, how can the beer be good?"
"Overall – Popular with the 18 to 20 somethings at university. This beer is really only drinkable with half a lime wedged in the neck of the bottle and chilled to the point were your taste buds can’t tell what you are actually drinking."

"This is my safety beer! If I know I have a night of drinking ahead of me I'll stick with corona! Delicious lime water!"

"Is this beer? I will drink this if someone pays for it in the summer and there is nothing else to drink. I think its quite insulting to call this beer to be honest. Yes its refreshing but its not beer... Its a soft drink!"
""
""
""
"Pours a golden yellow,  with a somewhat light flavor, but somewhat refreshing despite this. For what it is, it's quite good. To really open up the flavor, add a wedge of lime. I find Corona to be an underrated brew. It's not the best, but it certainly isn't awful, and it's far better than other mass produced beers. Enjoyable around summer time."

"I gotta give this piss water a 5. Yes it taste horrible, yes it probably does have some pee in it. But this beer was my first beer ever. And that's special to me. It's gotten me hella wasted, it's gotten me into a lot of fun. Most of all it brings great memories of me relaxing on a beach with my wife. This is THE vacation beer. But once summer is over I do not drink this piss water! Ugh seasonal all the way"

"Overall (2.07) : I do feel like I wasted a dollar. I'm not kidding. I will probably pour the rest of this down the drain for fear of illness. Never ever felt that way about a beer before this one. I'd avoid it if I were you. Worst part is, over half the beer is left. Probably the worst lager I've had in a long time, if not ever."
""
""
""
""
"So would I recommend it ? Only if its a very hot summer day, you find it on special, have some lime, and need some water/beer then YES, but otherwise its a NO. Its just a big commercial beer."

"This stuff, like most Mexican beers, is simply bad. With or without the lime. A marketing made swill, at best. I'd rather have a malt liquor... and before anyone accuses me of being an affluent beer snob, I am a seasoned biker who tolerates Pabst, on occasion, because it's cheap, not too horrible, and often the only non-light beer at a biker clubhouse. But I won't touch Corona."

"Realistically this is Chupacabra piss.. Everyone knows that.. So there is no need to go through a normal(A,S,T,M,O) review.. But c'mon on a hot summer day an ice cold Corona with a lime wedge reminds me of a simpler time of chasing booty at a pool party.. So for that I have a soft spot in my heart..

"DATE REVIEWED: July 5, 2014... GLASSWARE: Blanche de Chambly pokal (though tough to choose one, considering this is mostly a bottle-to-mouth beer... OCCASION: the comedown after two solid days of eating, drinking and celebrating...APPEARANCE: blur-inducing golden yellow body with minimal bubbles forming; quickly disintegrating white head forms a pencil-thin circle; zero lacing... AROMA: some metallic pings, but mostly a blank slate to sift other scents between; faint bubblegum and biscuit ... PALATE: where this one wins at least in its functionality--as enjoyed the past two days, a clean, clean palate-cleansing body that thinly holds to a beer-like guise--mostly water; when held on its own merit sans setting, a liquid pure and simple... TASTE: is it corn chip? just corn? bitter malt ping of a Vienna lager minus all that complexity--a syrupy ending leaves a little aftertaste, but a bit beefy if chewed...who knew the lack of a lime could be so detrimental to the overall experience?... OVERALLL: after oscillating between this and Starr Hill's wheat, I found my Fourth of July well enjoyed mostly due to the family, food and fireworks...the beer itself served to quench thirst and balance out the grill carbs, and little else...I do believe this review would have been more complimentary if the lime were present, as I even had difficulty selecting a proper drinking vessel..."

"Pours a straw-yellow in color with a very thin white head with some very light spotty lacing as well. The head is gone in just a few minutes just like the lacing. The aroma is a very light 'skunk' smell then some grassy hops and corn. The taste is about the same with a touch of corn sweetness at the end. Always a popular brew in the warmer months and always with a lime wedge as well."

"This beer is a great beer for the summer. It has a good refreshing taste. The taste is not to strong or to weak. The smell is pretty good. It also taste really good when you put a lime in it as well. I would recomend to a frend to try this beer. I know that I liked this beer and that will have this beer again."

"A rather well done corn dominant adjunct lager. Not bad. Drink fast and cold for maximum enjoyment."
""
""
""
"Tasts of sweet corn and light crusty bread. Light to medium feel with heavy carbonation. I'd take Corona over the scores of similar beers (foreign or domestic) any day."

"Overall: This is by no means a great beer - but everybody knows that. That being said, this is a brew I do find myself enjoying on occasion. At the stinking hot beach in Mexico? Yes. A Corona is welcome. While its composition is not a masterpiece by any means, it is refreshing and dare I say, pleasant. Its skunkiness is debatably ""by design"" and has become a characteristic trait of this brew. Its ABV is low and its produced in the millions of barrels. Yet, again, it is refreshing and hydrating with the right setting. Would I pick this over a fresh DIPA at home? No. Would I pick a fresh DIPA over a Corona in 115 degree weather in a sunny beach? Maybe - never had the option."
""
""
""
"One of the worst beers i drank in a long time and the fact that it is best served with a lemon is the best prove of it's poor quality, which even the sour can't hide. They say Corona is refreshing in the sun on the beach, but lager beers in general are and there are much better picks."
""
"O: If you're gonna buy a light drinking adjunct lager, just buy Budweiser in cans. It's essentially the same thing except it won't be light struck, it'll be 20% cheaper and taste better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthful was okay besides the taste. It wasn't bad or good. Definitely something I wouldn't keep around in the fridge but I can see how there is a market for this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoy Corona's, just returned from a vacation and the first beer that I wanted to drink while at the beach was sure enough a Corona. Very light and crisp beer that is extremely refreshing especially in the hot sun. Always add the lime as well for a little extra bitterness and flavor to top it off."
"Corona was really just a test I am trying to expand my horizon. I did not care for it. if I had to chose between Guinness and Corona I would chose Guinness I know its a completely different style of beer I am just trying to broaden my beers. I just guess I like dark beers more than light beers everyone has different tastes but if looking for a light beer this is pretty good."

"Corona has a very watery taste with a hint of skunk. It has a very skunky smell and it feels flat and uncarbonated. Corona's very light in taste but at least their commercials are cool."
""
""
""
""
"Anyone who doesn't like this beer is just a hater because of the hype. The beer is light and is very refreshing. Nobody ever says ""nah man i don't like Corona""... that sentence should be followed by a slap to the face because they are clearly lying to your face."
"Classic Beer. Pop one of these open at the beach and you'll surely enjoy yourself. If you're feeling extra adventurous, stick a lime slice in it and you'll have a great time. This is very refreshing and you'll get to taste a little bit of Mexico!"
"Awful??? what the F><K are all you people drinking? because I want some!.what Bullshit! how the f>>k can ANYone think ""Corona Extra"" is ""Awful???? I smell a rat here...OK it is Over priced,and Advertising has made it a Huge HUGE Seller due to It's ""Beach Ice Bucket~cell phone in the Sea"" Deal~and the whole dumb as shit ""Put a Lime wedge in it"" Crap...but ""Awful""? on a hot as hell day,and you just pulled a 14 hour shift outside sweating your ass off pounding nails,or paving roads,or doing tree work,or ANY kind of real work,an ICE COLD CORONA Taste fucking GREAT! So all you ""Beer Snobs"" in your air conditioned office,spending all your time Bashing Beer that is actually pretty damn awesome,do all of us real beer drinkers a HUGE Favor and just shut the F*&k up and dont forget to tip the mexican who just spent 12 fucking hours trimming your hedges or washing and waxing your Beamer in the 100 degree heat~snobby bastards__----"

"Hate the color of this, placid yellow with no much life though there is a thin ring of foam. Aroma isn't great, not too skunky thankfully. Flavor is better than i remember, meaning it doesn't taste like piss. Has a semblance of fruit and grain and skunkiness is dialed down. This particular tasting was decent but i've had worse bottles.

"This is not at all unpleasant. It is not sour, it is not offensive, The corn sweetness is not syrupy and the lager character is light. It's called a light lager. it's easy to drink and because it does not have any complex flavors it would compliment a variety of food, from Chinese, to Mexican to Italian or just a pastrami sandwich. You don't have to think about this beer it drinks as easily as water with a sessionable abv. There is a faint odor of sulfur that develops as it warms."

"Overall: There is not a beer in the world that screams ""summer"" like Corona with a lime. I drink this one solely for that reason- that sitting outside when it's 90 degrees with 80+% humidity just goes perfect with a pale yellow beer in a clear bottle with a lime stuck in it. Even when drank after Thanksgiving dinner, it hearkens back to that sticky, hot summer day when you last had a sip and felt refreshed for refreshment's sake, not because it's a good beer."

"Seriously this beer is a chick beer and I mean that chicks drink this because it is week and taste watered down with corny corn syrup and then these peasant women put lime in it to over foul that bad waste products that the after taste is. Cheep beer and I know my Mexican friends who grew up with lots of money from their parents even despise this uncultured commoner's drool. I could not imagine offering one of the peasant brews to some one like Michael Jordan, he gets the Sierra Nevada Torpedo. What kind of vagrant scum trailer trash would take such pride in furnishing their fridge with such a pauper's brew and then to compensate they put lime in it so it removes the taste of the Cancer this beer is to my mouth."

"But the body of the beer – its main flavor – is what really sinks it. The flavor is that of an oddly rubbery-compound tasting liquid. Not pleasant. No complexity. Take away the harsh jalapeno bitterness, and what you’re left with is a one dimensional beer of no particular high quality. Compared to the bursting complexity of Stroh’s, it’s a one-note bitter pill. As I said, I just don’t understand its popularity."
""
"Pours a light golden color with a smallish white head that quickly dissipates. Aromas of light sweet fruity and grainy malt with hints of floral hops to counter. The taste is sweet with honey and fruit. Light bready grainy flavor with a sharp spicy hop flavor with a low to moderate level of hop bitterness. Light to medium light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a slick sharp crisp mouthfeel. Nice grainy bready aroma, this actually tastes pretty decent without a lime stuffed into it."

"Corona Extra has been my favorite beer for the last 5 years or so. It’s light, stout but not bitter with the right amount of carbonation. However, Corona Extra contains barley malt, rice &/or corn with GMO’s antioxidants and propylene glycol (stabilizer). It is off my beer list. What a shame!"

"O-I am a sucker for cheap Mexican/American Adjunct Lagers (in the right setting), but I fail to see how any setting could be right for Corona. The smell is either skunky or non-existent and the taste generally follows suit. I don't think there are enough limes to save this stuff."

"Even amongst American adjunct lagers, people really seem to hate on Corona. I, however, found it to be rather unoffensive and noticeably more flavorful than many of its American counterparts. Perhaps getting a fresh bottle, keeping it out of direct sunlight and holding off on that lime is key to enjoying this."

"O: One of the worst mass-produced light lagers out there. I hate to sound so harsh, but if it weren't for the three limes that I shoved in the bottle, this would have been an absolute drain-pour from the beginning. As the beer sat and warmed out of pure neglect (I couldn't bring myself to continue sipping on a regular basis), it got even worse. I suppose it's drinkable if you add a lime or two while it's ice cold... Anything less and it's drain material. Go for Miller Lite if you're reduced to drinking a light lager."

"Ok, I know that Corona Extra is not technically a good beer. It has a generic yellow color reminiscent of Bud Light, it doesn't have much in the way of aroma and what is there has a slightly skunky aspect to it. As far as taste goes, it's just ok, and for the price there are a LOT of better beers you could get. However, that being said, I will admit that I enjoy this beer when it is served very cold with fresh lime on a hot day, and it's light and crisp feel are probably it's best attribute. ."

"Split a 6 pack with my brother, Appearance is fine looking, the smell is decent but nothing to great, the taste is alright I suppose, nothing bad, nothing good, its fairly light, and much better with a lime, mouth feel is also average, overall its an okay beer, but its nothing special, and definitely shouldn't be priced to what it is, theres a few beers I would prefer this to, but many many more I would rather take, for instance Busch, Pabst, Icehouse, Samuel Adams, Rolling Rock, hell I would even rather have budweiser, and also notice how all those options are far cheaper than Corona, I do think they put something in the water in making this beer because while I wasnt impressed I craved another for a week or two. I have no Idea how this beer is more popular than Heineken."

"I must admit, In the summertime I've probably drunk gallons of this stuff! When I think about this i realize why. I always made sure it was as cold as possible ( if it warmed up i was always sorry). I often drank it in mini bottles, added a pinch of salt, then juiced about 1/2 a lime. By this time there was very little remnant of the actual flavor of the beer remaining. Its a very musty smelling beer. There's this faint bitterness, accompanied by a corn after taste. The carbonation is also a killer. That being said as long as it was fully doctored, I wouldn't completely avoid this beer, but I definitely cannot and have not ever been able to drink one straight. For now I will stick to beer that has the ability to be delicious on it's own !"

"""Rapido! Rapido!"" I woke from my slumber to a pounding headache, resembling an intense hangover. Whatever I was riding in was dark, dusty, and shaking from side to side. Sweat beaded down my face and I came to realize my situation: I somehow made it to Mexico again. Fuck. Suddenly my transport halted and I flew face first into the front of the hot metal cab. I heard several footsteps, definitely those of short Mexican men. The back doors flew open and I was blinded by the Sun. They grabbed me and threw me onto the dirt. ""No mas, amigo! Andale!"" I looked around to see what looked to be the Great Wall of Arizona and walked in what I thought was a straight line. The Mexican van took off spitting dust into the air. As I approached the border line, I reached into my pocket, finding a little crumpled paper with my handwriting. It read, ""The secret ingredient to Corona: One Part Mexican Water, One Part Chicken Piss."""

"Not a beer worth drinking in just my humble opinion. Mexico makes so many great beers. Sorry this is to one of them. No taste whatsoever. For a full beer it tastes lighter than a light beer. And what is with adding the lime? Not for me, but hey whatever floats your boat."
""
""
"This is the Mexican version of Budlight. Absolutely no taste to it. A beer-flavored water. You are better off drinking water at a party. It has a nasty skunky smell. An insult to beers worldwide. I can only imagine what corona ""light "" must taste like....good lord"
""

"Overall - I wouldn't want to drink this again unless it was free."
"I have to admit, I wasn't sure what to make of this beer before I tried it. A friend of mine told me that I should try it so I did. This is one of my favorite beers that I have tried. The smell of a Corona is unpleasant and skunky at first, but the taste is great. The appearance is a yellowish color and looks very good at first sight.Some people say adding a lime wedge to your Corona will make it taste even better. I recommend this beer to anyone."
""
"This beer is only to be enjoyed in 3 situations: 1. The beach 2. The pool 3. A hot day. Other than that this beer will be too much. This beer, just like how it looks, is a beer to be enjoyed on a beautiful day. This beer is light and has a bit of a grainy taste to it but in a sweet way. The bottle is very attractive and makes you feel like you are on vacation."

"Corona beer is a bit like The Eagles. I cannot imagine anyone taking the trouble to really dislike something as light and smooth as the Eagles' music, but if the Eagles are your ""favorite band", then you haven't sampled the subject of rock music very deeply. I've never had any beer that I can just quaff as fast or as long as Corona. It tastes fine. In fact, it's hard to beat on a hot day at the beach. There's just nothing memorable about it at all."

"Another beer that I had so many times but never took the chance to review. So what if it’s snowing outside, I grabbed a bottle from the supermarket and I even poured it into a lager glass. The classic clean glass bottle of 355 ml, who everyones love to hate, ABV 4.5 on my bottle. Very pale, piss yellow colour, with one finger of white froathy head, very low retention and of course no lacing on the glass. Great activity in the glass though. Lots of adjuncts on the nose, with the corn being quite obvious, but at least it doesn’t have the ""wet cornflakes"" smell. Probably is covered by the light citrus notes. The corn is much more obvious on the taste. Nothing else to mention here. Very thin, almost watery on the body, saved by its high carbonation. Overall, what can I say that is not already written? Only good for the beach."

Initially it wasn't quite as bad as I expected, but hints of corn quickly materialise as it starts to warm up. Very bland, with almost no aroma and little flavour to speak of. It's just not that good and has to be ice-cold to be palatable. Don't follow in the footsteps of millions; instead give it a miss and drink something good."

"Overall - It is what I always knew it was - a nice light beer to drink if you are having a Mexican meal, it's hot outside, and you plan on drinking 10 or so beers. Otherwise, very plain light beer that's not worth writing home about."
""
"O: Corona Extra managed to exceed my very low expectations. No particular flaws excepting the remarkably low levels of hops and malts, and high level of corn in the nose and flavor. Only good as a thirst quenching cold beverage where I would indeed prefer this to water on occasion."

"If your looking for a beer of great quality I cannot advise you to chase after this beer, however if your just looking to get hammered go for it."
"Serving type: I've had this on tap and in bottle before. I've had this in the US of A and straight from a brewery before as well. It's not good."
""
""
""
""
"Corona Familiar bottle. Pours a clear yellow with a thin head that goes away fast. The smell is some grain and maybe faint rubbing alcohol. The taste is about the same, what little there is of it. It's refreshing in its way, pretty fizzy. Not a good beer, but inoffensive when not skunked."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Goes down smooth but almost no taste to it. Pretty subpar."
""
""
""
""
""
"Side note: Why did I choose this for my 500th review? In some ways I have Corona to thank for inspiring me to explore craft beer. I disliked Corona so much that I felt compelled to find better beer. And I did. Th-thanks, Corona."

"Pours a clear, straw color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of hop, and adjunct. Fits the style of an American Adjunct Lager. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight sweet malt, pale malt, slight hop, and adjunct. Overall, weak appearance, aroma, and body, but decent mouth feel, and blend."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very drinkable beer. Not the fullest in flavor, but its something that everyone will like. This beer is way overpriced however, and that is a huge flaw for me as you can find a beer just as good or better for a cheaper price."
""
""
"An outstanding dull and boring lager! I can't explain the smell discrepancy between my wife and myself, but there is definitely a rank aroma to this bottle. Distinctive taste and flavoring is nearly non-existent. A perfect beer for those looking for easy drinking blandness..."

"overall, worse then i remember - maybe because the lime helps that much."
""
""
""
""
""
"2.0 D: Without the lime there is nothing good about this, though this isn't even close to the worst AAL. Perhaps the only reason I crave this every so often is that I'm craving the lime. I can't do the review with a lime since that isn't what the brewer bottled. Oh well."

"Drank it from a bottle with a lemon slice on top. This is the classic way to drink this beer. It has a very clear yellow color and transparent. The aroma was hard to gauge as I had already squeezed the lemon into it. The flavor was somewhat hoppy and the lemon gave a very refreshing flavor to the beer. It was a very refreshing drink. Overall I think that this is a good beer if you add lemon to it and it is very refreshing."
""

"Overall impression: Meh. It is what it is. The skunk character is a little too much for me and I'm assuming it's a bottle characteristic because I've had the tap version and it's somewhat tolerable. If I wasn't in Cancun looking over the Gulf this would be a horrible way to spend a New Beer Sunday. Given the overall purpose, I'm willing to overlook this issue. Won't ever have again unless I'm stuck in a Mexican resort."

"Bland, fizzy and with a rough hop edge that I find unpleasant. Perhaps the hops are trying to hide the vegetal husky corn flavor of the malt."

""
""
"O- I know, I'm going against the grain here, so to speak, but I like what I like. And I liked Corona 30+ years ago when I first had it, and I still do, lime and all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Update: The fashion of placing a lime in the Corona bottle actually works to some degree. I found myself, once again, drinking Corona at a friend's house. This time I drowned the darn thing in lime juice which actually made it palatable."
""
"Overall, this is probably the worst beer I have had and that is saying something. Don't know if I got a bad bottle or what but I really don't see how people drink this stuff. Horrid."
""
""
""
"O - As with most adjunct lagers, this beer doesn't bring a great smell or taste. However, when served ice cold, some of this becomes masked and tolerable. An ice cold temperature is the key though as this beer is pretty tough to drink otherwise."
""
""
""
"O: I have no idea why someone would spend the money for something that tastes worse than other adjunct lagers. Clear bottle ruins and little flavor that might have been there."
""
""
""
""

"O- This beer has to be masked by a lime to be tolerable. By itself it is hard to drink, even when cold."

"picked up this beer thinking was a different variety of corona. poured from the quart bottle into a pint glass. pale in color with no lacing , and since i decide not to slice a lime and jam it down the bottle there really . a bit of grain and malt . for me its not a bad beer although i would like to pick up a single clear bottle to see if there is a major difference in flavor between the two"

"Thin lacing, virtually no head. No hops, mainly watery malt flavor with heavy notes of grass and corn. Skunky to boot. Tastes just like Cat Piss de Mexico de watery. Much better in the brown bottles as Corona Familiar which upgrades it to better than BMC adjunct lagers. The clear bottles ensure it does not travel well. Put down the Skunky Beer. Not recommended as Extra, decent BMC alternative as Familiar in the Brown 32 ounce bottles and decent lawnmower or summer beer."
"O: This beer is easy to drink because of its light body. It’s not that bad when served ice cold and has some refreshing properties but as it warms up the beer beings to taste bland."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty poor beer in my opinion and I understand why every other time I have had one served to me, I had it with a lime - you need something to change the flavor on this beer. Not one I will be having again anytime soon."

"P.S. The only reason I am reviewing this beer is that a friend left it at my house. I would never actually pay for this trash."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent straw with little head that disappears fairly quickly. Smells of adjunct grain and slight limey smell, however, smell is very weak. Tastes of adjunct lager, not much else. The only thing going for it, could drink 6 of these and not notice the light bodied beer with good carbonation going down. Overall, a below average beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"nose is vaguely skunky with notes of grain and precedes an equally lackluster flavor; grainy and bland with an unpleasant bitterness to it. this is what necessitates the lime, obviously. as noted in other reviews, this is not a good tasting beer even by macro/AAL standards. still, i will admit accepting one from time to time under the right (read: beach) circumstances. with a lime."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Refreshing, decent at best. If I'm going to have a macro lager, it won't be this one."

"I've had worse beers, that is for sure. This is relatively unoffensive, except for its aftertaste. Still, among the Mexican brews I've had, this is among the least remarkable."

"O-fizzy, yellow and wet not that good if you are looking for flavor. Mexican version of BMC just another macro brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A standard adjunct lager. Nothing special in terms of flavour. A patio or beach beer at best (this is what this beer is known for). Thank heaven for the creation of limes to make this brew a tad better."
""
""
"Pours a very pale yellow color with a fizzy head that goes to nothing in minutes and no lacing. Aroma is of a typical macro beer with corn, and some hops with a skunky odor that is hallmark of the brand. Taste is also a bit skunky, but the lime and salt definitely helped cover it up. Very thin and highly carbonated but slightly refreshing on a hot sunny day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hence my calibration for Corona. Can't say that Corona had any additional taste, character, etc. over these less expensive (and less calorie) beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thin in body, but good to quench the thirst with. The packaging may throw some people off, but this is just regular Corona."

"The best thing about this beer is the sweetness at the beginning, and how well the bitter metallic adjuncts balances this out. This is not to say that the beer is well balanced flavor wise, but rather that the mouth is not left with a sickeningly sweet, or offensively bitter flavor in the end. On a more negative note, the beer is over-carbonated. Finally, it lacks any real complexity, is overly adjuncty, and is bland in aromatics."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have had this beer a few times, but this is based on my last encounter with this brew while vacationing in Mexico. Poured a pale yellow color with no head and lacing. A lot of carbonation. Smell and taste of mild skunk which was improved by couple of limes I jammed in there. It was a hot day by the pool, so I did not mind it as much, but not something I would go and buy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I felt that beers like Corona and Sol get a hard time on this site, but going from this session, it's fairly deserved. There really isn't much to taste from this beer. However, I do think that I'd enjoy this one ICE cold, on a hot day, with a wedge of lime in the neck. The beer itself has a refreshing quality already but that's more to do with the feel and coldness than anything else."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a weak tasting beer that is very light. Tastes alright with some lime wedges on a hot day, but there are much better alternatives. Someone once described this to me as 'good beer'. I would disagree."
""
"Pours a very pale gold yellow with a big white foamy head that lasts about a minute. There is absolutely no lacing on the glass. Aroma is of adjunct mainly corn and some skunk. taste is same with a very bitter after taste. Mouthfeel is very thin. The lime and salt really help cover up the taste."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This would've been much better in the bottle with a lime. Corona Extra is a good session beer, but the taste just doesn't do much. Did not work well with any of the food I was eating. A kinda sad reunion."

""
"Man, everything is wrong with this thing. How the hell can you expect me to enjoy sumthin that tastes and smell like a skunks boo boo? Damn... the only way I can wash this gutter drink down is with a hefty dose of lime and salt. And still... ay mami!!!!"

"Corona in Lebanon. The beer is making itself known in this side of the world. Good looking colour, and inviting appearance. Taste is light on the tongue, and not over carbonated. Is great with a slice of lime or lemon pushed into the bottle as it adds to the flavour. Still prefer Sol though!"
""
"Also does make a good bloody mary chaser."
""
""

""
""
""
"O - This beer is made to refresh and that's exactly what it does. Not something I usually go out and buy but on a hot summer day these can really do the trick."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not different from the clear 12oz bottles in my opinion, and I don't know if I would buy this with my own money honestly, but it was a gift from my friend at work who gave it to me as one of his staples from back home. Thanks Jose!!!"
""
"O - On a hot day down in the Yucatan where I travel on a regular basis this beer is sufficiently refreshing if you slam a like into it. This said, I do prefer Bohemia."
""
"Picked up a bottle while at lunch in Vail. Decent 1/2 finger white head that dissolved almost immediately. No lacing. Very little aroma aside from a hint of skunk. The taste starts crisp due to the carbonation with a hint of mild hop bitterness. Not much in terms of complexity, fairly weak flavor. Overall, it's been a long time since I had a Corona and after this one it will be a long while again, not much of anything, not a fan."

"Just as terrible as I remember, but surprisingly without a whole lot of skunky aroma or flavor. That doesn't make it good beer though."
""
"Transparent gold in color, very small white head swiftly vanish and left no lacing, medium carbonation. Somewhat skunk in smell along with grain, husk, corn and subtle sulfur. The tastes blend with some bitterness, slight sweet, dry grain malted, a bit acidic and unpleasant aftertaste. The body is thin with a bit coarse mouthfeel, very crisp, dry finish. I drank without lime wedges in order to experience its real characters and I would say this beer is definitely no go."
""
"A freebie courtesy of Southwest Airlines on a delayed flight. Adding insult to injury!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a pale yellow color—piss yellow, some things never change—with a barely discernible aroma. It still had that honey sweetness I associate with Corona but it wasn’t cloyingly so. Not much flavor, a weak finish, but I’ll take this (the Familiar) over the clear glass bottled version any time."

""
""
"Overall, nothing too spectacular. There are still about 5 other Mexican macros I'd rather drink before this one."
""
""
""
""
"O: Drink and ""enjoy"" it for what it is, but this beer is not for a matured and developed palate unless you are trying to cool off from a hot summer day, laying on a beach, or trying to wash down some tasty tapas on Christmas Eve at a Tex Mex joint in London."
""
""
"Looks like a pale lemonade. All yellow and clear as they come. Smell and taste are somewhat skunky, and all rice and corn grains. On the palate, its only good quality is that you could probably drink 100 and not feel like you've had many."
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall not the worst beer of its kind but there are better. It is popular because of its marketing campaign, not its taste. If you like beers like this stick to its higher end companion Modelo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"PS: For the good of beerdom, just drink water instead. If you want a buzz, get some cheap whiskey, or if you absolutely MUST have a beer, some Miller High Life. In fact, I surmise a punch in the face would be more satisfying than Corona."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty bad, and reinforces the idea that since beer is mostly water, you generally want ones made as far north as possible. Very little flavor, no body, thin mouthfeel, insipid overall. The success of Corona is (as far as I can tell) a triumph of marketing -- ""the sizzle not the steak"" -- because the product is deeply flawed. And I hate the whole lime thing."

"O: It's not horrible, but it's really, really bland. There are myriads of better Mexican beers. I can see this one being mildly refreshing if a lime is added, I suppose."
""
""
""
""
"The beer tastes lime flavoured if you put a twist of lime in it. It tastes lemon flavoured if you put a twist of lemon in it. I can't wait to chuck a passionfruit in my next one... or maybe a pomegranite? No, I've got it!!!! - a banana.... yum..."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is horrible...I honestly do not know why anyone drinks it....in trying to be respectful I will leave it at this...I do not recommend this beer at all, if it is for you then great but of al of the beers I have drank this is one of the only ones I will continue to turn down."

"Overall: Corona Extra? Extra what...Extra bad?"
"O: Perfect libation for fixing surfboards. The brown bottle really helped prevent the dreaded ""Corona Skunk"" that I was so wary of when my friend presented this as his payment for repairing his board! All in all though, I can think of many beers in this style that I'd prefer over this. (Pilsener in El Salvador - maybe because I was there while sampling!) Good style for hot work though!"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: In the realm of Mexican lagers, this one is below average for me."
"Bought a 24 oz of this stuff because, honestly, I am gonna use the bottle for a batch of hard cider that I have fermenting in the basement at the moment. Of course, the reason clear bottles are perfect for cider is that THERES NO DAMN HOPS IN CIDER! Upon opening the bottle, I was immediately struck by the unmistakable smell of skunkiness. That smell is only reinforced by taking the first bitter, bitter swig. Ugh. Look, it's marginally better than Tecate, but way inferior to Dos XX, Modelo, or Negra Modelo. Steer clear."

"From the one quart growler labeled Corona Familiar. Stamped: AF13AO78-05:00. No lime. I try to rate these Adjuncts based on style not reputation. This is pretty average for the style. The pour is straw yellow with almost no head (Below average). The aroma is of malt, grains, corn, rice, and token hops with enough character to make it a little distinguishable (above average). The body is quite thin (below average). The taste is balanced enough with grains, rice, and a tickle of hops (average). As far as a craft beer goes - forget about it. There's a reason this is one of the best selling Mexican beers in the world but not all beer drinkers are into crafts."
""
""
""
"I think the commercials on TV are all this beer has going for it. The lime was of better quality than the beer. I would rather of had bottled water for refreshment, a coke for taste. This was they absolute worst beer I've had...PBR is better. Corona means ""crown""...I'd say they earned the crown of skunk beer."

"Quite some beers do not deserve their bad reputation. This one does and it would probably be quite hard to enjoy even during a sweltering summer day."
"A pretty average beer. Considering that I’ve been rating good beer for about three months, I thought this would have been lower, but really not that bad."
"There are worse out there..."
"Mouthfeel is actually not horrible, but the taste is so overwhelmingly bad that it's still awful. Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation. Overall, this is something you should only drink when dying of thirst. Even then, maybe you should just forgo it and die with dignity."
"This beer goes down smooth on a hot summer day. It goes down smoother when you are fishing on the river in the hot sun. But when you are not thirsty from the heat, you realize that there is really nothing special about this beer. The smell is not appealing at all but I think it gets better after you have had a few. I think the big selling point is the memory pairing that people get when they think of paradise. And that is great marketing!"
"Not impressed."
"O - its corona so you know.."
"Pleasantly surprised, I must say...I haven't had a Corona in a few years and went into this expecting something awful. Other than the scent I found this to be pretty decent for the style. There's many better options for the price, but I wouldn't turn down a free one."
"It is your basic straw yelloe beer, with not that great of smell. I didn't enjoy the aftertaste and it isn't worth the price because it's too high. I probably would never get it if I wasn't at the beach and that is only because people buy it for me. I rarely buy it."
"So I went to a party and my buddy bought a lot of this because this is the only beer he will ever drink. Well I brought my own beer and then once those were done, I had me one. The appearance is of your typical beer, straw color and yellow. The smell was just awful. I dont know if this was old or what, but it sent chills down my back it was so bad. The taste was just like the smell. I got nothing from the beer, but maybe a little grain taste. The mouth feel was highly carbonated and very unimpressive. Overall this is one of the worst beers I have ever had, I just dont get how people buy this and enjoy it. It is just terrible."
"O- This beer really doesn't have anything there it is all just bubbles and takes on a soda pop carbonation."
"The pour is vibrantly yellow-gold, and is capped with faint white wisps of froth, but deposits lace from seemingly out of nowhere. The aroma is quite plain, with maybe, maybe, a hint of of corn sweetness atop a light husk and mineral base. The flavor is really quite good, sans skunkiness; it is not terribly flavorful, mind you, but it does have light mineral notes, a restrained sweetness, and a total absence of off-flavors. It is a bit like a Cream Ale, reminiscent of NG's Spotted Cow, which is very surprising to me. All in all, this has to be my favorite incarnation of Corona, thus far; the concept of anything other than clear glass longnecks, though pragmatically a better idea, has long seemed sacrilege - but no more - as this is likely my go-to cheap fizzy swill from here on out. I guess I'll have to find it on-tap, if such exists, and see if it can top the canned version."
"D-"
"Corn/rice are apparent, with a hint of pale malt, and a small amount of hops."
"I don't know why but I hate this one a little less than some other AAL's but I still wouldn't drink one even if there were no other beers on offer. I can dig an ice water on occasion too."
"Honestly: Whats the point? To get drunk without tasting a goddamn thing..."
"Cheers!"
"This was a tough one to drink, I can't say I enjoyed anything about this one."
"The first time I had a Corona, I had it without a lime. It went down rough. Let me tell you. It's strange how much of a significant difference the lime makes. It changes this beer from piss in a bottle into a drinkable beer. The one thing that bothers me though is the fact that no place on the bottle tells you to do this, unlike some other beers. Take Blue Moon for example. It says specifically on the bottle that you should have it with a slice of orange (which is a good suggestion if you ask me), however, Corona never says that other than in their ads. So if you ask me, as a beer by itself? You might as well just drink toilet water."
"This beer does not deserve a real review. I was a couple deep and decided that I had to just get it over with. I will not be ordering this again. I regretted it right away."
"Bottle. Pale yellow colour no head at all. Aroma almost nothing. Light body.Weak and watery. Maybe citrus in taste. This is not a beer. Some people say that there is a place for this beer, the beach. Not for me not even there. Avoid it at all costs !!!"
"I recommend drinking this freezing cold with a lime."
"This beer is so thin and weak that I'm having a hard time giving an abysmally low score. How can you be offended by something when there is no substance to cause offense? This is a beer for those who don't like the taste of beer. For all the talk about this being a ""refreshing"" beer and a good option for a hot day, I can't see why I'd drink this, even those circumstances. I'll opt for actual water!"
"Overall this beer is very unbalanced. Taste is average, but it the bitterness was actually the result of some hops, this beer might make a decent session beer."
"So sad that it is so easy to dupe people into shelling out relatively high dollar for joke-time pee pee swill. I'm not being snobby - if a six was $5.99 tops then I would keep quiet but no, we're talkin craft beer sixer price for sweaty water."
"You know its sad when this is my best option at a pub. Safe to say, I won't be going back there again. $5.50 for a bottle of this golden piss. Thank god for the lime, got me through most of this. Just tasted really bland and a rusty like after taste. Definately a low point for me, with beer in the past couple years. This town sucks."
"Presentation: Packaged in a thirty-two ounce brown glass (Corona""Familiar""), served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"330ml bottle.Enjoyed directly from the bottle many times in many countries since 1981.Pale light straw yellow.Cristal clear.Poor crown,no retention,white foam.Grainy slightly malty aromas.Tasting & mouthfeel are bland.Light bitterness,light body,watery.Notes: So do what you have to do:put a couple of lime or lemon wedges into the bottle & make sure it is at a low temperature in a hot sunny day...then could be easy drinkable.Nevertheless,avoid hot meals or over carbonation is gonna bother you.I promise."
"Not too impressive. Slick and watery. Overall it's on the low end of the category. Lime would certainly enhance but not even that much."
"i will never drink this beer willingly again. i am only drinking it now because my mom left one in the fridge and i thought now was as good a time as any to knock it on this site. it begs the question ""why a clear bottle?"" and i think that the answer is that that marketing image just means more to the C.O.'s than what is in the bottle."
"Over all opinion ... Not a beer (liquid) worth drinking. Over priced like many imports are, Wich most certainly does not determine quality!"
"Poured this Mexican version of an American Adjunct later out of a clear bottle, into a pint glass. Poured a clear straw color with a thin white head, poor head retention and little to no lacing. Aroma is skunky , smells like broccoli. The taste of this beer is light in body, sweet, light suggestions of grain. Very Mild hop flavor. Not a fan, while i admit sometimes a corona poolside is good...but its mostly because its hot, thirsty and there are 3 lime wedges crammed down the neck of the bottle to mask the skunkyness of this south of the border brew."
"Pours a clear yellow with a 1 inch fizzy white head that fades to a thin film. Random spots and streaks of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains and corn flakes. Taste is of sweet grain and corn flakes. Surprisingly there is no skunk aroma or taste in this glass bottle. Lucky me? This beer has a decent level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this particular bottle is a bit below average but I definitely have had the same beer in other bottles that was a D or F score."
"O: This beer is just like other adjunct lagers, except not as good. I don't understand why they sell so much, oh wait...lots of advertising promoting that cool beach vibe. I would much rather have a Pabst or something because they taste about the same and is a lot cheaper."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"This is another beer that relies on marketing to sell. If it weren't for brand-recognition, this wouldn't be nearly as common. There are several other Mexican beers that are cheaper and/or far superior in every aspect."
"O - I hate this beer, maybe my least favorite in the world"
"O) Ice cold and with a lime wedge makes this a summer standard for many. Corona isn't great but it will always bring back fond memories of Jimmy Buffett concerts at Alpine Valley, and drunken ladies showing off their boobs."
"Corona as in most Mexican beers taste best in the summer with a lime...however, judging Corona solomente...its just another no frills cerveza! The beer poors golden clear with good carbonation that give a white foamy head for a brief time. The smell and taste are enhanced with grain. The hops help somewhat with the taste so that it is not bread water. Mouthfeel is easy especially on hot days...enjoy!"
"I like adjunct lagers; and it's rare I hate a beer, but this is one of those rarities."
"The taste is luckily not as bad as the smell. I suppose it’s not skunked, then. It is not as bad only because there’s very little taste to speak of. It’s a bit starchy with a mild tang. Really nothing there. And what’s there is far from pleasant. Don’t buy this beer."
"O - I think Corona light is better because there is less skunk, but with a lime I will drink it on a hot day."
"Pours a beautiful light golden color with lacing, practically no head to speak of. Tastes watery, not overly carbonated, slightly sweet and a little bitter; lots of grains. Very smooth and dangerously drinkable, needs a lime to mask the otherwise skunky flavor and aroma. Great for the beach or a BBQ, otherwise steer clear. Oh, and WAY overpriced."
"T: This is what is seems, a light beer for lounging at the beach, with a bit of fruit to temper the rough edges. It must be good because this is what cool people drink."
"Overall: No words for this."
"D - Was worse than I expected, and I didn't expect much. I will admit, these Mexican lagers leave some pretty fine lacing, but it's gonna take more than some foam on the glass to impress me, especially when everything else is sub-par."
"it is what it is - sitting by the pool beer."
"O - Was it refreshing after a day on the beach, yes. Was it something that I would spend money on for a party with 30 people, yes. Would I order it because it was the ""best"" beer in the bar, yes. But this falls quite short of what one could consider a ""good"" beer."
"o - Overall not a very good beer, but slightly better than Landshark. It's never a good sign when people need to add a lime to your beer to make it taste better. Not something to seek out; go for Negra Modelo."
"I will buck the trend and disagree with the D rating of the Corona Extra. The head does fade quickly, the color and flavor is very light. But on a hot day, a cold Corona with a twist of lime really hits the spot! The right amount of carbonation, the subtle malt and hop, the infused lime really clear the palate on a hot day. OK, it’s not a heavy duty intense craft beer, but is a good beer for its category and purpose. Better than the more trendy Pacifico. A nice change of pace from the Hefeweisen I drink during the summer months."
"D - I wouldn't drink this unless the Mexican-style restaurant I was eating at had a really, really limited selection to choose from; I really have never been a fan of this beer and its skunk smell, even with a lime, sucks; I always thought it was served from a green bottle"
"D- As easy to drink as most adjunct lagers with the skunk and corn being a little strange but not off so much that it is not drinkable."
"And SwillFest 2011 begins here in painful earnest. This stuff pours a clear sallow topped by a finger of short-lived white foam. The nose starts off mildly skunky (damn clear bottles...), but this somehow passes, allowing some wheat, corn, and sweaty-guy B.O. to ""shine"" through. The taste holds notes of hard water, bad creamed corn, and dirty lemongrass. The body is pretty damn light, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather watery feel. Overall, a sad beer, more akin to flavored water than an actual brew, if you ask me."
"O: disappointing even for my low expectations. Truly not something I would pay a premium for among the AAL style. Don't know how people consider this ""good beer"" compared to other adjunct lagers. Avoid."
"O: Lime???wtf. Come on, you guys. Lemon, really? Is this just to mask this gross beer?"
"Worst of the Mexican variety, still baffles me the popularity of this beer. I understand why you put a lime in the beer, gotta jazz up that flavor somehow, right? Had to force one down last night, only beer left available. It does serve, however, as a reminder of why I love craft beers so much."
"Not terrible, but not good. When they serve it with the lime, use it. Improves the taste vastly. As an accompaniment to some Mexican or South American food, it serves as a nice thirst quencher. But it's just not good on its own merits."
"D: Fantastic after a few nice ones, and the cooler starts to get low."
"Overall, I'm not as down on this beer as i used to be, but I'm not going to buy one any time soon. I might even refuse it, but I can see why people drink it: because they have no real taste for beer."
"Typical adjunct lager smell of corn grains rice and yeast and beery smell. This is actually better than how Corona usually smells because I'm drinking it from a can so there is no skunky smell at all. On the taste I get crispness from the carbonation along with the sweet corn syrup like malt with a very very slight burst of a citrus hop? Its very very subtle though. I also get the rice taste mixing in with the yeasty taste. Its not that bad. The corn syrup malty taste tries to hold up against the watery body and does an OKAY job at it. This is a pretty refreshing full flavored beer and I actually like this better than regular Budweiser only if it comes in a can though. The bottle skunk smell and taste is awful at which point I'd pick a Budweiser over this. Smart move on their part to put it in a can though. Not bad but not good."
"As a very advertised beer, I actually am impressed with Corona. It has a rather potent taste, and is refreshing. It isn't the best beer from Mexico...but it isn't the worst. Pretty average look, nothing special. Smell is decent, but the taste makes up for it. I may not add this to a ""go-to"" beer, but I'll definitely take one at a game, or party."
"Thanks to my sister-in-law for the opportunity. "
"There's a reason these things are advertised the way they are, so it should be considered. Besides, you wouldn't be able to save Keystone or Natural Ice with these constraints."
"O: Ewww, I can’t believe this is so popular. I can pee in a cup for a lot less than what this costs. If I were stranded on an island with Corona and needed to drink it to survive, I would Bear Grylls it and give myself an enema."
"O: Really difficult to drink it. I could not finish the glass"
"Overall - not impressed at all. If I had to choose between Budweiser and this beer, it would be a very hard to decision between which I liked least. I probably would have to choose the Budweiser over this one because of the smell coming from this beer."
"O: tastes like a generic cerveza. seems like something frat boys drink when they grow up."
"It's cold, wet and lightly sweet. You could definitely do worse."
"Final Grade: 2.30, a D+."
"O: Not what I want to be drinking..ever really. I know I will have it again, but it will likely be due lack of other options at a party or BBQ."
"O: I could do with out, but when available at a beach party I'll take it."
"This beer is for the hot days on vacation down by the beach, near the pool, in the garage, while doing laundry, finishing a project in the workshop, getting yard work done or just making friends at the lake on a boat. Found in nearly every bar on the planet. Great with tacos. Enjoy."
"Not my top adjunct lager, which still gets to be PBR. It isn't very smooth compared to most others, but it does have some hop citrus, letting me know why it's popular as a summer beer."
"O: Out of the 'crappy lager' category, this is one of my preferred."
"I cannot believe that this bottle was drinkable! There was absolutely nothing wrong with this beer, and it tasted better than the Corona Extra someone had brought fresh from the store to the Pacquiao/Mosley fight-party last night. It really goes to show you how much the clear bottle degrades the product that it contains. There were no skunky notes to our Familiar bottle despite its massive journey."
"D: now i see why people throw a lime in this bitch, to give it some kind of flavor. classically uneventful."
"Overall: Fairly refreshing and drinkable with no offensive taste but I'm not a fan of the skunk. I'll drink it again but wouldn't seek it out."
"Overall: This certainly isn't the worst beer in the world but it lacks personality in just about every aspect. The one saving grace is its drink-ability. This is one of those beers you chug after mowing your lawn on a hot summer day. If this was a bargain price beer, I might even recommend it for such an occasion. It may be worth trying once on a hot summer day at the beach. Otherwise, it should be avoided."
"Pours a nice looking one and a half finger head, but I'm sure it will be gone soon. The head is completely white, and the body is yellow and completely see through, it also has more carbonation than any beer I can seen in a long time. The body is also completely transparent, the head is pretty much gone, but not to the bare bone, it holds on a little bit which is good. Overall it looks like an adjunct lager, nothing impressive here. The first thing I pick up on the nose is skunk, this is a skunky beer for sure, too bad too, because I think I can actually detect some hops behind that skunk, which is rare for a adjunct lager, after that I smell some sweet malt. I have to give it some credit for having a hop characteristic to it, but for the most part, it's not going to be a good beer because of that skunk. Well it's hard to dissect any flavor out from underneath that skunk flavor, but if I had to it would be that little bit of hops and tiny bit of malt. The skunk just totally overpowers this beer. It's not a god awful taste, like some adjunct lagers have, but it's not a good taste. I mean it's drinkable, and somewhat refreshing, but for the most part it's all skunk. The mouthfeel is very interesting, it has a very fizzy, maybe even thick mouthfeel, so...it's not a typically ""good"" mouthfeel, but I'll give it some points for being creative. Overall, it doesn't have many good qualities, but it is a unique beer, even if it is because it's so skunky. People always say ""Corona and lime"" for a reason, it's because it has a unique taste (that tastes happens to go well with limes, but that's aside the point). This isn't a good beer, but I don't want to call it a bad beer, despite what my numbers say, it's drinkable and unique. Fine maybe it is a bad beer, but it's above some of the other bad beers."
"Overall: despite the nostalgia I have for Corona, drinking it on summer nights at the beach before I could legally buy beer, this isn't particularly good. Fairly thirst quenching though and okay as for as American Adjunct Lagers go and okay for drinking on a hot day, but if I had my druthers I would've been drinking pretty much anything else. Cheers!"
"Finally decided to review this one as I'd had it several times over the years, most recently last night at Old Chicago for the annual Cinco De Mayo mini tour. Poured a clear yellow color with no head and no lacing. No aroma whatsoever. Taste was pretty much just sweet malt--too sweet, in my opinion. I guess I could do this on a hot summer day but definitely one I won't buy a sixer of."
"O - The drinkability actually isn't all that bad. It goes down easy, and is pretty good for an adjunct lager. It is one of the least offesnive of the style that I've had."
"Despite its high adjuncts, skunked smell, and skunked taste there is something about a long summer day that can make this still an enjoyable beer."
"Standing alone, this beer is not great."
"overall-i do not mind it.it is over rated but still decent if having more than a couple.plus id rather pass a few of these out than share my private collection"
"O: A market built around selling skunk beer to the US. Mexicans don't even drink this crap. I will quote a typical beer store customer in the south: ""I need a case of MGD and a case of Corona because it is the best beer ever."" Nuff said."
"In my years of beer drinking I've never had a more terrible beer than Corona. I did have this beer with a lime and without a lime and found that the lime improves the flavor. That isn't by any means a good thing though. Corona is a terribly made lager which is overpriced and made from corn and bottled clear (where it is skunked). No head retention and a very thin mouthfeel. I really don't understand how this beer is so popular when it is so pathetic. Better than Corona light though."
"A translucent golden yellow. A bunch of bubbles but no head only some minimal lacing around the rim. Nose is all mild, somewhat sour, light grain obviously adjunct. Tastes like sour/grainy water with a lot of carbonation. An extremely light body that can be easily be drank quickly during your typical American BBQ. No lime for this review but i have sadly consumed a good amount w/ Lime and I ""like"" it a lot better."
"just plain bad not a good beer false advertisement! i mean the taste sucks its skunky leaves a really bad aftertaste the only way to make this beer descent is add to salt and lime, even then its still hard to take down! i rather drink pacifico than this it has more of a smooth slight bitter taste to it than this awful if u want to call it beer"
"Ok, so this beer couldn't be more popular amongst most people. Haven't been able to see what the hype is though. It comes in a clear bottle that doesn't hide anything. It's clear yellow flavor is minimal and the only thing that really gets this beer something special is a lime wedge. That's pretty much it... Without the lime this beer is pretty much worthless to me."
"Straight from the bottle. Clear, pale yellow, pretty standard of the style. Quite a bit of skunkiness on the nose, along with sweet corn, pale malt and a whiff of sulfuric lager yeast. Light on the tongue, firm and crisp up front with a mild bready malt profile. Becomes sweeter in the finish with a bit of lingering corn and sulfur. Very little bitterness or flavor in general. Admittedly pretty refreshing, thanks largely to the general lack of flavor. Not a good beer by any means, but enjoyable on certain occasions."
"Overall: This beer does not hold a candle to any craft beer but it's not suppose to. This is merely a mindless party beer that should be considered as that. Also don't buy this beer in a six pack or by itself. The twelve pack carton is the only way to have this beer taste decent."
"I feel foolish giving this such a high rating, but the truth is, it is pretty close to what I expect in a Lite American Lager and while some are highly offended by it, I can't imagine what exactly they could be offended by. I hardly notice that I'm drinking it."
"I guess this beer would go down fairly easy, but i don't want to drink anymore than i have to for this review, because if i wanted carbonated water, i would buy that instead."
"Overall, I echo what others already know, this beer sells exceptionally well in the United States, and in a lot of parts of the world, sadly, due to it's tropical apeal ads. I drank this without the lime and in a glass, but the fact they promote the lime, (and to drink from the bottle) so much, you might as well just drink cold sparkling water with a lime in it on a hot day. It would be just as refreshing as the ads claim this beer is, which it was not for me."
"After remembering how disgusting Corona Light is, I figured this would also be terrible. It actually shattered my expectations, and forced me to reconcile my preconceived notions about not just beer, but life. Just kidding. It's not THAT good."
"Who hasn't had one of these beers. Definitely the quintessential beer of the beach or vacation. Other than those two instances I would not recommend this beer. Obviously, it is best paired with a slice of lime. Drink this beer as cold a possible, when it gets warm it definitely tastes awful. Cheers."
"Even though reviews are terrible for this beer, I still rather enjoy it."
"All kidding aside, I wish this beer had much more character and taste than it does tradition and name recognition. It seems the only reason Corona is consumed is a result of a marketing campaign that appeals to the modern human desire to at times escape the modern life to a tropical retreat with no cell phones or email."
"OMG! If you try to swallow this make sure to add lime. It is the only way not to gag. Its got some corn, water, a bit of citrus touch, mineral water, some grainy characteristics and a pound of skunk. It looks like piss, pale yellow with a fizzy white foam that fades fast. It smells close to the same with some nasty skunk, a little rot, and some metallic notes. Terrible. Its a drain pour. The lime barely helps. I don't know what the extra is unless its body. Its thin, fizzy, watery, pale and skunky."
"Overall: One of the worse adjunct lagers. Most beers in this style are just close to water - boring, but mostly unoffensive. Corona can't even copy that losing formula. Honestly, if they suggest you serve cold with a lime in it, they can't really be confident in the taste. Life is too short to waste it drinking bad beer. Avoid!"
"If you do buy this beer, as I said make sure to get it in a 12 pack. I've never bought a sixer that wasn't skunked."
"D: Simple task would be to throw back a few. Like so many others, the drinkability is one of the only positive factors of this particular brew."
"Bad beer. Presented with this, it's no wonder why some people hate beer."
"Pick up a Bohemia, Dos XX Amber or somethin of the such."
"Drinkability: Water is preferable. I can understand why people put a lime in this thing, but why even drink it? Vodka and water with a lime wedge would be better. I poured out half this one, the first drain pour I can remember."
"Pours a light golden straw color with a thick soapy white head and no lacing. Smells of sweet corn and a little grain. Tastes of sweet corn and a little malts and some very nasty flavor. Mouthfeel is watery and it has an intense carbonation. Drinkability is low."
"24 ounce bottle poured into a wine glass. No lime. Short lasting head that dissipates quickly into a thin ring around the edge. Looks flat under a minute after it's poured. Smells slightly skunky, like raw potatoes. Very subdued raw potato taste as well, but essentially flavorless. Crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Could use a little more carbonation. Easy to drink on a hot day. Still enjoyable on a cool one. Probably preferable with lime. Definitely a mood beer, or for drinking with Mexican food."
"If you haven't tried this beer yet, you really aren't missing anything. No head. No lacing. Clear and fizzy. Acrid stale flavor. You drink this to get drunk, period."
"I'm thinking the proper way to review a Corona is actually ice cold straight out of the bottle with a lime wedge stuffed down the neck; I'm feeling like an idiot sitting here drinking it from a glass. Who would do this? No one, that's who. Corona serves its purpose in mass quantities sitting in an ice bucket at the beach along with a good stash of limes. Reviewed as a beer, sure, it sucks. As a beverage though, Corona does serve as a great cold lime flavour delivery system. Drinkability ice cold on a hot day, straight from the bottle with a lime wedge: high."
"D - There logo is ""From where you'd rather be"". And they are spot on. I'd rather be somewhere else drinking a different beer."
"Folks, this is not one of those beers that you want one of.. You just gotta have many of these at a time. For quantity, this beer is best at a party but maybe not for the price. Price is a little bit more than other light beers aka ""party"" beers . Corona extra is the perfect party beer though just because how many of these you can drink after you hit that 20+ beers, i usually get sick of drinking light beers but not this 1 my friend, NO WAY!. Not too much of a smell though. But the drinkability is out of this world. The appearance of this beer is pretty dull. But the bottle looks cool and tastes great so im going to start buying this more when i want to drink in the 20+ range!!!party on!"
"Not going to go deep into reviewing this one, but tried it recently after getting into serious craft beer. Light beer used to be my thing, but now I like big ,dark beer. This was still surprisingly refreshing for me. Light,crisp, put a lime in it and enjoy!!"
"Personally this beer is one one of my favorites to drink! It's smooth and easy to drink. Goes good with a lime! It's a good beer to have anytime,especially at a party! Seems most people are critics towards this beer due to it's lightness in taste! But I find it as a favorite! Cheers!"
"I do enjoy this beer.Its something you wont scream WOW about but I keep it on hand.Just like on the commercial you can drink this on a hot day,relax,and have several without falling down drunk out of your chair.It does have a almost light beer taste to it.You can not drink a stronger European ale then come back to this..."
"Mouthfeel: Slightly crisp from the carbonation, which was surprising for how little there was. There was also a sensation that almost ""bites"" the tongue when you first taste it mixed with the crisp feel..."
"had this in many different cities across this great land and its too bad this was my beer of choice when i was a young lad. Not at all what I would consider to be a choice for drinking now. I would much rather have water and wont even offer to my friends. This stuff is as bad as it gets for me."
"Nothing exceptional about it, but served ice cold with a twist a lime after a hot day on the beach, I find Corona to be refreshing and enjoyable."
"D: I could pound a 12 pack in a moment, this is alcoholic/carbonated water. If I never had a lime in it, don't think I would ever drink it. There are better Mexican and adjunct beers."
"drinkability: i'm not a fan of this beer. it's easy to drink but i feel retarded for buying it since it's promoted everywhere and they have lots of slobs trying to be cool and wearing their logo. and the fact that college kids and girls would really like this makes me not want to buy or drink it. if something bad happened and i wanted some beer to down this would work perfect or if it was real hot and i was bored."
"I now understand why people put lime into this because otherwise it doesn't taste like much."
"The only reason why I am even rating this beer is because I had it on tap for the first time ever which is really rare. My wife and I went to Mexico at an all-inclusive resort and they had Corona on draft. Usually poured into a tall glass. Pours golden, without any head, some bubbles. Grassy hops aroma hit as soon as I first taste it, then some sweet notes came through as the beer wormed up in a glass. Good, medium body. There is a taste to this brew, although not much -- some light hops and some sweet notes. Definitely a lager to drink in the heat or when eating Mexican food."
"D- This beer is drinkable I suppose. I'm not a huge fan of it but I see where people will drink it. Hot summer day this is a nice crisp beer to refresh yourself with. Will I be buying a six pack of it anytime soon? Nope."
"D: a single note song, not worth the calories."
"So bad. Not even strong enough to actually get drunk off on a Saturday night."
"Notes: Nasty"
"D - Very light, fairly refreshing. Some beers are made to be focused on as you drink them, others are made to help you forget you have a beer in your hand. This is the later."
"""Mas Fina""? Por desgracia no."
"Only drink this beer ice cold and with some citrus fruit."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden, without any head, some bubbles. Grassy hops aroma hit as soon as I opened the bottle, then some sweet notes came through as the beer warmed up in a glass. Good, medium body. There is a taste to this brew, although not much: some light hops and some sweet notes. Overall it is a drinkable beer, although much more difficult though by the end of the bottle."
"D: it is mellow enough that if you are thirsty, it will satisfy your thirst. Beyond that there is not much to recommend this beer. Add a lime wedge and you can forget you are drinking terrible beer!"
"D: It's not as bad as I remember but still not anything good. To actually be a good beer I don't think you should have to add anything too it."
"Smells like grain, corn, some spicy hop in the background. Tastes okay, lingering sweetness from the grain and corn combo. The hops do provide a slight bit of balance. It's really not bad. I'm going to drink the rest of it with blueberries, though."
"I ordered this beer for a fellow that just had to have one. I said let me taste it as not having done so before. I immediatly looked around for the donkey they botteled it from. This was the worst tasting and smelling beer I ever seen. Wish i had something good to say about it."
"Overall, while I would rarely order one of these, if you want a quick, refreshing, lawnmower beer, you could do worse."
"Why this beer is popular is a huge mystery to me. This is definitely manufactured for the gringos and no actual Mexican would ever drink this poor excuse of a beer. Just looking at the gross color you know youre in for a bad ride. The beer tastes flat and stale and the skunkiness is overwhelming. The reason people drink this with a lime is because without the lime, its unbearable."
"Drinkability - I do not mind this beer, maybe cause it's a decent advertising campaign. Not something I would die for but do stock."
"D- you could drink these all day with a lime. :-)"
"This beer tries to please the palate too much: it's so smooth and easy, it is trying to please me too much: going down, it makes for a very boring experience."
"The quintassential beach beer. I almost feel bad for reviewing Corona. They were and at times still are in my fridge or cooler in the summer. Anyway, Color is not impressive, pale yellow. The smell is not enticing at all, almost smells sour. Taste needs the lime. As a matter of fact, it would really bad without the citrus element. As with many of the ""beach beers", really cold is the way to quaff this beer. Good thing? You drink 20 of these if so inclined."
"and I don't recall it being this bad."
"Cheers!"
"Very light an watery. Its lawnmower beer and it accomplishes the wet your whistle mission. Drinkability is high if you are blitzed, not so much unless you can stomach the smell."
"D - I would take any Canadian macro over a Corona, but it's still beer and I love all beer, so I can't hate on it too much. I mean let's face it, this beer is coming from a country which doesn't even have the cleanest water so how can their beer be all that good. One thing they have done well is commercialized the hell out of it, so I gotta give credit where it's due."
"This is anything but good. I wouldn't even drink this in sweltering heat in the summer like the commercials suggest. I honestly don't even know how to describe it but it's a bit skunky and doesn't even taste like beer. It's borderline syrupy to me? Never again, that's all I know."
"Does the nose of lime is due to the scents of the beverage or just the citrus that automatically served with Corona, I do not know. Anyway, the taste is that of the bottom floor of Adjuncts lagers. Just a little stale cereal in his mouth to support the citrus taste and recalled as a little cactus juice. Finish unconvincing and without great power that recalls both the corn and not too fresh cactus juice. One wonders just how the joke is able to penetrate all markets. Just a little poor thing."
"Notes - Maybe a drain pour. Ill see how much of the 32oz bottle I can drink."
"Poured into a pint glass. Not sure what the point of that is, considering that this doesn't really form a head or produce lacing and I can tell its color by looking through the bottle. Color is golden. No head. Nose is skunky hops. That's about it. Light with a lot of carbonation. I can see why people like to lime this up. Faint whiff of light bread. Not really much like beer and what is does not taste good."
"Pours the lightest pale straw color i've seen in a beer... active bubbles, minimal head. Scent is light, watery with very very very faint notes of straw and hop extract. Taste is also extremely pale, with faint notes of pale straw and hop extract. One item to note, the scent and taste is so faint that there is not much there to signify any cooked vegetable adjunct notes. Light bodies, moderately active carbonation, dry. Not a fantastic beer by any means, but manages to avoid too many off notes. Note: really goes taste better with lime."
"I strongly believe that a good beer will taste great on its own. If it needs a little assistance with other accouterment, then it's usually a red flag. Since Corona is always served with a lime, it should come as no surprise that this beer is not the best beer available. I've tried Corona without the lime and I quickly understood why the lime was necessary. Without the lime, I found it to be undrinkable. The lime added a nice citrus flavor that made it a little bit more palatable. But the only saving grace of this beer is that it pairs quite nicely it Mexican food. So, the next time you're at a cantina enjoying some carne asada tacos, get yourself a Corona. For all other occasions, drink something else."
"Poured out a can with no lime. Beer has a soapy looking head, pale yellow lots of fizz. Smells sweet, some processed corn and faintly smells of apply juice. Weird. Taste is sort of cloying and corn syrupy. Some mild bitterness and some annoying bitter seltzer aftertaste, which contributes to the lame mouthfeel. I have no idea why or how this beer got as popular as it is, oh yeah, when you cover up the terribie skunkiness with a lime, you get the idea..."
"perhaps the industry standard in lousy skunked beer and sadly I doubt anyone can avoid it until the day they die. everyone eats a pound of dirt and everyone drinks a pint of Corona"
"This will be the last time I pay money for this swill."
"I never thought I'd say to myself that I'd rather have a Miller Lite. I'm amazed."
"I never understood why this is the most famous ""beach beer"" or what genius decided that a clear bottle was a good choice for beers that you're going to drink while sitting out in the sun. Either way, do yourself a favor and avoid this beer whenever possible. There are many more refreshing beers that aren't skunked and cost less."
"Crap beer, hard to imagine something this bad is the third most purchased beer in the world. Even when I knew nothing about good beer, I never actually liked this, and that says a lot."
"D- Average."
"D - Summer drink when nothing else is available but other than that very simple beer with almost nothing in it."
"This beer has a lot of following, but I am not impressed. Poured into my chilled, but not frozen mug, it produced a two finger very white head of thin bubbles that dissipated in less than twenty seconds. Its color is that of light amber, rating a 4 on the SRM chart. Smells like roasted corn and malt, with a hint of lime. Tastes, what there is of it, like little to nothing, maybe a bit of yeast, sweet malt, and corn. Very weak in the mouthfeel department, watery, with just some carbonation. Sorry someone will have to pay for my next round of this brew. Maybe good for yard work, but not food, as it does not lend any real flavor to enhance anything."
"I suppose it is so popular with the not-really-old-enough-to-drink-yet crowd because it is cheap, and because, having a limited reference as far as beer goes, they do not know a good beer when they taste one."
"D - Ok, still has a spot in my heart. Cold one on a hot day.. OK."
"D- Drinkablity is good. An easy beer to pound and get drunk on. Thats really the only thing its good for. The price is ridiculous though. Not even worth it."
"D- Very average if your the type to not get easily bored."
"d it goes down easy ice cold beyond that buyer beware"
"Drinkabilty: not very by itself but with added lime and little salt very drinkable on the beach or bbq but the price doesn't make it a regular choice of mine."
"This is my first Corona in quite awhile and the first I've ever poured into a glass. The marketing for this beer is amazing. They somehow take a terrible product, sell it for top dollar ($30-$32 a case here in PA) and end up being the top selling import. Oh, and you have to buy some limes to add to it. This is just poorly brewed beer people! The nose and palate are loaded with corn husk, cooked veggies, and off chemicals. I see why the lime is needed. Mouthfeel is watery, even for the style. It's not cheap and I shouldn't have to add anything to my beer to mask it's taste. This is one beer I will always try to avoid."
"D - in reviewing mass produced/consumed beers I'm aiming to keep an open mind and not just be another beer snob writing off a layman's favorite, but there really isn't much too this beer in terms of aromas, flavours, or feel, the only real plus is that you can basically chug this like water, and it is light and refreshing with a lime on a hot day, it's not a bad beer, there's just nothing to it"
"drinkability: the addition of the lime is its only saving grace; it's a beer that can be drank casually but nothing spectacular."
"D-Out of all the large scale beers out there I think Corona pisses me off the most. Only really enjoyable with a lime."
"I do not understand why limes do not come with a box of Coronas. Is anybody drinking this stuff by itself, without a lime? I've never seen it. And for good reason, because the beer does not taste well on its own (w/o a lime or lemon). But it can be refreshing on a hot, summer day...Or at least that's what the commercials tell me."
"Seriously, this stuff is that bad."
"Drinkability: Well okay it's drinkable, sure. Although it's better with a lime to mask the sulfur and even better when actually on a beach in Mexico. Otherwise I do believe it's nuts to pay $20+ for a case of this stuff."
"I'm not sure what I hate more: the beer itself, or the mindless fanboi zombie culture that loves it. Yea, on about 3 seconds of contemplation, I'm sure I hate the idea of Corona even more than I hate Corona itself (and that's saying a lot). This beer, probably more than anything else on earth ever spawned from a very unlucky yeast cell, has a huge following built on nothing but image and advertising dollars. If there is such a thing as Yeast Reincarnation, no doubt only those unfortunate fungal microbes with the worst sort of karma would ever find themselves in a vat of Corona wort."
"pours a clear, pale yellow with a couple fingers of white head that lacks any sort of retention; no lacing. smells skunky with notes of grain. bland, lackluster flavor with an unpleasant bitterness to it. this is what necessitates the lime. as noted in other reviews, this is not a good tasting beer even by macro standards. still (also as others have mentioned), i will admit accepting one from time to time under the right (read: beach) circumstances. with a lime."
"D: YES on a cold or hot day (especially)... the beer does taste rather bad when hot almost undrinkable, so Ice cold is the way to go. The Party beer IMO"
"Clear bottle. Crystal clear beer. Pale yellow with a bright white head that disappeared almost immediately, leaving a thin collar. I really don't like the aroma -- too much of a sulfury hop character and some skunkiness make it hard to take. Musty and a bit sour smelling. Grainy sweetness and the same skunky hop flavour, sort of floral, but not good. Light bodied, average carbonation, dry. I'll continue to avoid this in the future."
"O: It's consumable enough, except for the abrasive aftertaste. On the insistence of a friend, I squeezed a lime into the remaining half of my beer; now it tastes like limeade with grain squeezed into it. Make of that what you will...it's more drinkable, but no longer tastes like beer. Overall, pretty bad."
"Pours a clear gold with a nice white head. Gets off to a good start but everything is downhill from there. The nose is vibrantly grainy but not venture into more interesting hop territory. The taste is also a one note wonder. It's not terrible but neither is worth my while to ever have another for any reason. Taste become outright atrocious if it's anything less than ice cold."
"Overall, i enjoy having these.. while in Mexico. I find it heavily carbonated and slightly overrated. The taste has no distinguishable characteristics, no hints of flavor, just carbonation. With lime, on a beach in mexico, I can enjoy it. But as an import, especially any time outside of the summer, this is not my beer of choice."
"Very low. I couldn't drink the rest of this beer. I rather drink Bud or Coors over this awful beer."
"D: very very drinkable. (trying to be generous here) drink these by the dozen if you care to."
"D: I'm not knocking this beer because it's an adjunct lager. I'm knocking it because it's one of the worst adjunct lagers. The only time I've enjoyed this beer was as a water replacement in Mexico. I like almost all the other BMC style beers more than this one. Stick a couple limes in it and serve it ice cold if you must."
"D - I'll admit, that if I'm lying on a beach chair and someone hands be a cold corona with a lime; I'll drink it. But it is a poor beer."
"I feel that this is one of the most overhyped beer's on the market. I'd heard great things before I actually tried it. It was very disappointing. If I'm going to drink a mexican beer, I'd prefer Modelo Negro. Even though similar, I think it's a good alternative."
"Drank it straight from the bottle, chilled. Probably a good thing because the first thing I noticed was the awful piss-like smell, a skunkiness. Looks the same, too. I guess Corona is an acquired taste, it manages to be stinky and watery at the same time, like a Bud Light gone sour. Alcohol content is a bit lower than other lagers, so I'd say the drinkability would be on par with a light beer. I'd not want another because I don't enjoy the taste or smell, and don't drink just to get a buzz. I give this two thumbs down, especially since the price isn't as low as the quality. (Still a lot of Gulf Coast Floridians love this stuff, their choice.)"
"D: A beer that can be drank quickly, but it does not have me coming back to the taste."
"This one was free, so don't judge me. Haha. Served from bottle into a Blue Ridge standard pint. Pours pale yellow with a one finger white head with AGGRESSIVE pour that subsides to none almost instantly. There was no apparent lacing present at all. The aroma was comprised of malt and a small hint of fruit. The flavor was of malt, sour fruit, water, and citrus. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall I tried to be fair with this brew in my rating but it is just bad. I have never really been a fan of this brew and will probably never be. It is just missing too much to be good. Maybe this is why the tell you not to drink the water in Mexico???"
"P.S. Anyone who says this beer tastes of citrus or it tastes ""limey"" should think about the fact that they might have put a lime in the beer and that might be where the taste came from. If so that is not good reviewing because we are not here to review the lime juice that is added. I did not use a lime and I am here to tell you that this beer has ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, no lime or citrus flavor at all. Not even a little bit. Nope you are totally wrong if you think there is. Try again with out the lime in it, it really has no lime flavor. None whatsoever. Really, Seriously. No lime. Not even a hint of citrus. None. Nada..."
"No need for a long winded explanation, it looks bad, smells and tastes horrendous, and gives me a headache every time I drink it. Knowing this I bought another six pack to rate. Yep, still awful. Pity the person who forgets to buy a lime to kill the flavor."
"D : Light beer, so I could drink a lot of these over a session. This would make an excellent session beer in the summer only. I never buy Corona in the winter, there is no reason doing so!"
"D- The limes make this beer possible. there are better mexican beers out there."
"cheers!!"
"Years gone by, billions of dollars spent, Corona has become immersed in idyllic images of pristine beaches, sunny settings and vacation lifestyles. This is the deceit of advertising and nothing more; there is nothing about the beer itself that accounts for these associations. It is as lifeless, insipid and ordinary as any other mass-produced lager."
"Overall: Who knew that a wedge of lime would make such a big difference? Without the lime this beer would not even be worth rating, but add the lime and a blazing hot day, it becomes somewhat drinkable. So here's to citrus!"
"I highly recommend the chunk of line that most bars add to this beer. It is the only flavor there is to the watery mess they try to pass off as beer."
"RJT"
"Not very good overall."
"Just had one of these for the first time. Didn't expect much from it, but it was better than expected. (That may have been improved by the addition of a lime wedge.) I usually don't have much of an appreciation for thin beers like this, but at a friends house on a nice summer day, I would definitely drink one."
"Drinkability.: must admit I do have them at parties and bbqs. I would never buy themfor myself though."
"D- This beer is very drinkable, I can easily demolish a 6 pack, and its essential for summer days near the pool. This beer is a good beer just to relax and chill out, you don't really need to have it with food however it goes with most meals."
"for a very drinkable everyday beer. If you agree with this review, you will also probably like Lionshead."
"D- I could drink quite a few of these but only if i'm in the mood for it, and I have a lime to drop in to give this known skunky beer any flavor."
"Review must be over 250 characters and less than 5,000. Apparently we shouldn't be snobs, but shouldn't not be snobs, either."
"D: While not awful, this is certainly not good beer by any stretch of the imagination. Marginally refreshing, but generally a somewhat rough, middling Mexican macro."
"Overall: The body of the beer is light and the finish is a little more than light. This beer isn't very good."
"Overall I would not recommend this beer. It does not taste good. It is decent with a lime in it, but what good is a beer if you need to add fruit to make it drinkable???"
"this was probably skunked. i poured it out after a few sips. so it goes."
"d - Despite all those aforementioned defects, eh, its pretty drinkable. It is pretty similar to water and therefore pretty refreshing. If its available, its easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Potable, but nothing to it. No depth."
"D: Would drink this more than the Extra Just becuse of the higher ABV %"
"Crisp-ish, with only moderate carbonation, and a remarkably thin body. Dry enough that you don't have to worry about the flavor hanging around too long, but nothing offensive enough to warrant a drain pour. Whether you want the extra calories without any kind of flavor payoff is another question entirely. I don't, so I poured the other half down the sink. I got the idea well enough to know I don't care much about this beer one way or another. Think it's time for a Green Flash West Coast IPA..."
"Still not sure why people put a lime in it though."
"And this stuff is just as expensive as SN pale? Jeez."
"Notes - It did have an OK mouthfeel"
"Overall: Take this for what it is: good cheap beer."
"D : Light beer, so I could drink a lot of these over a session. This would make an excellent session beer in the summer only. I never buy Corona in the winter, there is no reason doing so!"
"If it was free id drink them, assuming there was nothing better, would drink before almost any aussie beer, and easily beats budweiser being the only american beer ive tried."
"D - There's some potential to drink a few with the light body, but the mouthfeel doesn't make it the least bit enjoyable."
"Wow, there is not much malt flavor in here at all, I am guessing the adjunct percentage is pretty high on this one. Finishes dry and with plenty of carbonation scrubbing, there is actually a fleeting hop presence at the end too. Breath of alcohol makes it feel heavier than 4.6%, I would have guessed more like 5.5 or so. It is not as bad as I remember from back in the day. It seems these cans help keep some of the skunky flavor I remember being so prevalent at bay, those damn clear bottles cannot be good for the beer. Middle of the road Mexican lager for me, could certainly do worse."
"The marketing department for Corona has the easiest job on the planet. Just by having a Corona in your hand makes you feel more tropical, and who doesn't want that? I love drinking Corona, despite it not being a great beer. I had this on tap on a cruise ship a few months ago, and it was not good at all. But I will continue to drink and enjoy Corona. My motto in life is, ""someday my life will be a Corona commercial."""
"d-good drinkablity for a quick fix of beer with minamal enjoyment should be left for college students or thous that would like to drink beer to drink and not really for its taste and deeper flavors"
"MF/D: Extremely light, over-carbonated, prickly feel, and a sour metallic twang to it"
"D: Between a choice of this and the Mexican water supply, I'd choose this hands-down. Thank God I live in America. Yet somehow, I can't turn these babies away if offered one at someone's party. They also seem to disappear rather quickly. Every time I drink one I get flashbacks of when I was in college, and watching hot girls get sloppy drinking these down and spraying themselves with beer as they tried to figure out how to get the lime in. Good times."
"Body is very watery, but surprisingly this could actually use more carbonation, it's quite low."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"I never understood the hype of this beer and thankfully the popularity is starting to wane and the price coming down."
"For shame, Modelo."
"Bottom line is I really like beer so even a sub par beer ain't so bad."
"Notes: Pretty similar to other beers of its style. Not great, but there are some occasions that it would fit well in. Never really a supporter of fruit pieces in beer, but a slice of citrus isn't a bad addition to this."
"This is not as good a beer as I thought it would be. You MUST shove a lime wedge in the neck of the bottle to fully enjoy it and it really should be a summer, beach beer. Not that good a taste and also not that drinkable. Not worth it, get something better if you want a lighter lager."
"Libation: A watery mess that I simply can't drink unless I mash citrus into the glass. Surprisingly bitter for the lack of flavor. It's really surprising the popularity this beer."
"I do not like it Sam I am!"
"Note: also, why would we need a lime to make this beer taste good? Should be a red flag right there, it's a bad beer all the way."
"First of all, there is WAY too much hype around Corona. Amazing the affects a huge marketing budget has on consumer behavior in America. This is nothing more than an over priced American style lager. One Saturday in college we actually did a blind taste test to see if anyone could tell the difference between a Miler High Life with a wedge of lime or a corona with lime and alas nobody knew the difference. As a matter of fact, I actually preferred the High Life over Corona."
"where do i start. oh boy this has to be one of the worst beer ive ever had, skunky, un appetising, yet morons drink this all night long. Its appearance is extremely pale, though it is packaged in a nice looking bottle, shame that. little to no taste, though perhaps you could compare it to dirty water. Very light texture in mouth though not smooth at all. Drinkable, i guess if only option and basically you just want to get wasted, then i would consider it. 2 thumbs down."
"Nice after a good jog in a hot beach, ice cold. And it can get you drunk cheaply. Other than that, no point in drinking this."
"pale urine like colour. slightly sweet smell. starts off with a frothy head that quickly diminishes. no lacing whatsoever. tastes flat and bland its only distinctive feature is a very average sweet citrusy flavour. for me it's a very unenjoyable beer to have but it always manages to make an appearance at parties. this is the one time it may be accecptable to drink it. also i wouldn't even attempt to drink it unless it's ice cold :("
"Poured from a bomber size bottle into a pint glass. No freshness date on the clear bottle. No head at all. Clear, pale yellow color. Smells is distinct, almost like rotten vegetables. Flavor is pretty flat nothing really sticks out. I can see why salt and citrus are often used when drinking Corona. Pardon me while I chug this while it is cold."
"D: It's a hot day out, so I won't say no to another."
"This bewared splits me in two. Before i became ""enlighten"" i though this was a good think to drink. The problem is just that! I have liked this and without it i would never attack the finner things of the industry. This ""philosophic"" thinking may go on a while but i will hold my ground right here.. You can read 30 different reviews and you will get 30 different opinions..!"
"I am a proud supporter of coronas and im not mexican btw lol."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and, unlike most adjunct lagers, can actually taste the Pilsner roots. I hadn't had this in years and expected to hate it. I was pleasantly surprised and prefer this over most macros. Maybe it helped that it was from a can instead of the clear bottles I had in the past."
"I thought this beer was at least okay a few years ago but after drinking nothing but craft for the last couple years I was surprised at how bad this was. We now what it looks like, foamy head dissipates quickly leaving almost no trace of lacing. Aroma offers Munich malt, corn adjuncts and booze. Taste is more corn cereal, German malts and little to no hops. Carbonation is excessive and sharp. Finish is moderately dry. Overall lacking real flavor."
"Very drinkable, this is a good beer to have for tail-gating. However, it has very little flavor, and does not really compare with better beer. This beer is good with a lime or lemon, some people like to add some margarita salt on the bottle top. This beer is also known as ""Panther Piss."" This beer is not at the top of my list."
"This beer is simply water. It is not as bad as some, i.e. Miller Light with Lime but is only better because its flavor is not repulsive. It is a fine drink for those who do not like beer but if you are looking for malt or hops you should stay away. Overall this is a brew for those whom do not like beer, or simply wish to party and have no need for quality."
"There isn't much to say about this beer. It is a very plain and generic looking beer. It is hardly different in flavor than similar beers, such as Bud (although it may beat out having a Bud Light Lime). It's not a terrible beer to have if you out to a Mexican restaurant, but probably not my first choice."
"this is a slight improvement over the light version. the body is darker and there is a little more of a discernible taste to the beer. do I want to drink this? no. but given a choice, i guess I would take the extra over most american adjuncts, except regular budweiser, as long as I was eating tex-mex."
"Again this beer is crap, gets alot of hype, tastes like crap and is priced the same as Bass Ale in the supermarket... What gives?"
"D. this is just another beer to use to get drunk with."
"One of the last beers you can count on to be skunky, if you like that. It taste almost exactly like Miller used to taste (corn and clear bottles?), at least that's how I remember it. The beer does look pretty in that bottle. It isn't bad. I got a case as a gift and I'm not complaining."
"Cheers!"
"Gross."
"Notes: Now I know there are different opinions with regards to reviewing these adjunct lagers, however I'll be the first to admit that under the right circumstances I love an ice cold corona. However, when I review this, it is under controlled conditions. Compared to other beers, this one isn't great, but don't let that affect whether or not you would drink this occasionally."
"You don't stick a lime in here for decoration. There isn't anything special to say about this one but it has its purpose. Its needs to be ice cold with the lime on a hot day. It goes down as easy as water and has a better quench factor. So don't run out and buy this for the taste or for May 5th."
"Reviewed on: 07-12-2009 19:20"
"Imported yellow fizzy stuff. I am reviewing this without a lime which seems to be the best feature of this beer. Skunky smell (thats what happends with clear bottles) I guess the lime would have hid that. No real head or lacing. Crystal clear straw color and not so great a taste which is better than the smell. Reviewed this only to bump up my numbers, I would usually avoid but it was free. Why do people pay imported prices for this. There are much better Mexican beers out there."
"¡Salud!"
"EDIT: Crap, I actually ranked this high in a blind taste test of low-end adjunct lagers. Need to at least increase the score from an F to a D, since it's decent for a crappy version of this already crappy joke of a style. I hate American Adjunk Lagers with a passion."
"p.s. Better drink it when it is ice cold."
"The taste is the same. Its light but highly drinkable. Nothing special here at all. But in Mexico, do Mexico."
"Pretty drinkable when it's ice cold, and I understand the whole ""refreshing on a hot day"" argument, but I've had other beers that are equally drinkable and refreshing, but still have good flavor (e.g. a good hefe, blond, or wit). Also, the price is surprisingly high enough that I could never justify purchasing it."
"D: This is probably the least drinkable of the adjunct lagers I've had. The smell just puts me off before it even gets to my mouth."
"In closing this bottle was actually slightly better than most of my experiences with Corona. It was definitely less skunked. But for the price there are a myriad of better options out there."
"Taste is very light and a bit hoppy, I'm tasting some saaz here, it's almost like a really bad pilsner. Ok but not great, I think the can is good so it's less skunked."
"If you want some good Mexican beer, try Negra Modelo"
"d- tough to force down. for some reason, people love it, and it gets drank on beaches everywhere. I just don't get it, people think it so sweet to throw fruit into your beer. Its a lot cooler to drink beer with fruit fermented into it"
"Final Thoughts: As the top selling import in the world, Corona is a testament to the power of marketing. A squirt of lime would give this beer some flavor, and help it's case but on it's own, it's really only appropriate for dousing ridiculously hot Mexican food, or having one after sweating on a beach at some resort. Frankly, if you put it next to a light lager, I would be hard pressed to tell the difference."
"had at peppitos on chicago ave i know this is bile but i will say there is a place and time for this lager and that would be at a mexican restaurant it was ok flavorful and went down easy with the chips and salsa and my tamales.. so as i said corona is ok at this point and time and not much else i did enjoy the brew while at the restaurant i must say"
"Drinkability: I really don't like this beer. This is one of those beers that I actually can say I dislike rather than just saying I don't want it or it doesn't fit my mood or that there's something better. However, if it were hot outside and this were served to me ice-cold with some lime, a bit of salt, and maybe a burrito...no problems there."
"It cracks me up that Corona, which is ""lite"" to begin with actually makes a ""lite"" version. The reason you have to add a lime is because of the complete lack of flavor in this beer. I know that the lime is the ""kitch"" factor making it look cool and trendy, but the fact that it just doesn't taste all that good should keep you away from this one. If you want to drink something ""Mexican"" with your Mexican food, grab a Dos Equis or Sol. They're both much better choices."
"It has a very thin appearance in the glass with light bubbles resting on the top. Smell is bland, better with a lime on the top. The flavor is ok but best when having with food, especially mexican. It is heavy in the mouth with carbonation. Drink on a hot day with good friends."
"I must have been lured back by my own fond remembrances of pre-craft beer life, where the sweet paletteableness of this beer (plus lemon-slice) and the unfailingly good times that surrounded its consumption had left a mark in my mind. Well, it is what it is; and that's an adjunct-laden macro, with little to excite my senses, when not surrounded by drunken frivolity. Pale straw-color & fizzy, short-lasting head. Thin smelling and thinner on the mouthfeel, the overall experience is of an OK thirst-quencher, and little more."
"Bought a six pack of this stuff thinking it wouldn't be all that bad but i was definitely wrong. The site of this was extremely pale almost like tinted water. The smell up close smelled skunky and unappealing. The taste was nothing special at first but after a few sips it definitely became clear to me that this beer had nothing for me. The drinkabilty was ok, but the smell and taste overpowered me from even finishing the stuff."
"Drinkability: I really do see the appeal that this beer has for some people. It would certainly be refreshing if you were outside, especially on a hot day. It's extremely chuggable, which would make it good for parties as well (trust me, I know). With a wedge of lime, there might even be some flavor to this beer. That said, this is one of the most tasteless beers I've ever had. If your looking for flavor, go elsewhere."
"the 6 was about a dollar each"
"The smell is skunky, as is the taste. Not much to the taste, but I can see why it may be so popular due to the lack of an aftertaste. Those who don't like strong beers and just want to drink would be drawn to it. I imagine like so many import beers, if I was to grab one very soon after it was born and drink it at the source, it would be somewhat a good beer. Truth is it just is not any sort of beer to enjoy."
"D- Aside from the complete lack of flavor, it really isn't offensive. Way too pricey for what you get."
"The quintessential beach beer. We have quite a few beaches in Minnesota, but you are far better off drinking Summit or Grainbelt up in the North Woods. Don't bring this week shit up around me. The one thing I will say is that I was a little surprised at the abundance of malt I felt... still crappy though"
"So hey it's Corona, not great and make sure you drink it cold, if it's what cheap and they have some limes"
"The lime is almost required. I also like a little salt around the rim and down in the neck. It's not a good thing, though, when you have to add lime and salt to your beer to make it passable. That said, it's still a pretty good entry-level beer once you dress it up, and it just kind of works with Mexican food, pizza or a day at the beach."
"Drinkability is there if only on hot days or a neighbors party when nothing else is available."
"Found one of these in the fridge and figured, why not? After all, I just downed a Double Dog Double IPA, so my palate should be pretty well toasted. Maybe it'll block the taste I know Corona to have. Pour is a clear straw yellow with a fluffy white head that quickly vanishes. Unfortunately, the taste is the same as I remember. Hint of skunkiness, though not as bad as Heineken. Taste is American macro, although it does have slight hint of bitterness. This is OK on a hot summer day. I'll drink it occasionally if its around, but it's not something I'd ever buy."
"Cheers!"
"this beer ivwe drank a good many times and rather drink a natural light or a budweiser instead it tatse like what i would get if i held head under a cow's rear end to long. i drank quite a few when i was very drunk so the next day i ordered one at a bar and could not beleieve i even drank one the nite before."
"Pours a weak pale yellow color with a fizzy head that is about a millimeter and fizzes out instantly and leaves no lacing, no the most appetizing looking beer, carb can be seen rising. Not much of a smell, some malts, some citrus and some sweetnees, weak smell. Taste is the same as the smell, lots of citrus, water, a small malt backbone that dies fast, sweetness too. Yucky mouthfeel, very thin, way too much carbs and a weird citrus malt aftertaste that im not a fan of. Drinkability pros are that it is so light you can drink it like water, cons are that it tastes not so good."
"Extra what? Anyway... Pours a clear straw with a weak, wispy head. Vegetal nose, maybe the barest hint of grass. Kinda cidery aroma. Bland, watery flavour. Balanced towards bitterness, but that's fairly relative. Harsh carbonation and light body. Somewhat mineral watery. Pretty bad even for the style."
"I don't trust any beer that is required to have a lime in it, which this one pretty much unanimously is. I've never met a Corona purist who only drinks it sans lime. That being said, I don't think a whole lime saves this beast. It looks like the urine of somebody who is well hydrated and doesn't taste far from the same. It just has a sour, grainy taste like somebody left the bottle on the beach for a week."
"I'm sorry but this is as far from a beer I would buy again as you possibly can get."
"Verdict: Don't be fooled by the Spanish on the bottle, Corona Extra is just another bland and watery American Lager. I'm usually not a big fan of fruit served with beer, but in this one's case a lime certainly can't hurt."
"D= the taste is really awful. I would have pegged it for a non alcoholic brew if I didn't know better."
"Drinkability: I mean, it's refreshing when served really cold. The carbonation and cold are the two things that really make it worth drinking on a hot day, but really iced tea or water would do the same thing. If you're having one, put some lime in it. It's more a citrus-y drink at that point and less of a beer, and a little more enjoyable that way."
"If I am going to drink fermented rice I would go for something with a little more flavor, or is that an oxymoron."
"Pours a golden yellow color with visible carbonation and a very slight head. The smell is of cheaper hops and some grain notes. Taste wise there is a taste of cheaper hops and of grain, rice or corn variety. The taste is more flavorful than most adjucts. The mouthfeel is moderate to high. A little fizzy. The overall drinkability is above average for an american adjunct."
"Pours a golden Yellow color, low alcohol volume makes it very drinkable, almost no aroma what so ever, and very poor Foam Head, Surely not a beer either for beer snobs or connoisseurs, but a very good option for a 105 degree summer day with friends. very drinkable. not good warm. but who cares after a 12hr. drinking binge in cancun."
"GC"
"Looks brilliant golden yellow in the transparent bottle. Always had it with a lemon wedged in the bottle, gives it a likeable twang to the otherwise plain taste. An exceptional summer beer, that can be consumed all 6 pack at once. Light on the palate, could have been more malty. Smell is hoppy and fresh. Great beer to go, especially for a macro level produce."
"Small bit of foam on top of a light yellow. Not too much to smell or taste really. Goes down pretty well, mostly because it’s pretty thin, like water. Decent beer for a hot summer day when your thirsty, but other than that, nothing special. Wouldn’t go anywhere seeking for it."
"Guilty pleasure. Goes great with spicy Mexican food."
"I like what's in the glass better."
"In any case, this swill is a testament to how dumb people can be. Shelling out 15 or more bucks for a twelve pack of crap beer, while they imagine themselves swinging on a hammock over some white sandy beach in wonderland. This is prob what Coors Light drinkers go with when they're on vacation."
"d- Its drinkable, but that's as far as I go, I only drink this when i go to party's (and free). I fail to see the need to go and spend imported beer prices for a beer that I'm going to modify."
"D - somewhat drinkable."
"Poured from a clear bottle into a weizen glass. Has a pale straw color with a 1/2 inch head. Mild, corn aroma. Taste is light and rather bland. Feels watery in the mouth. Drinkability is o.k. Overall not a terrible beer but not a lot to it. Very ordinary."
"Drinkability: For what it is, I feel this might be one of the better American Adjunct Lagers that I have tried."
"Corona always tastes the same, the bad thing is that it tastes like...RACOON'S ASS!"
"Straw yellow pale color with medium head formation and little lace retention. Aromas with minimal presence of malts and little hops, very much bitter in smell notes. Tastes of little malts with bitterness. Finishes dry and with the lime in the bottle and the beach can be a decent avergae macro beer."
"For all that though, yes it is clean and inoffensive, but it's also shamefully weak. Good for chugging and getting drunk if you're into that sort of thing, but not one to be savoured, or in any way enjoyed."
"Dont even know why im reviewing this beer but its the only beer they had my mates place as im sure we all know about corona already it pours a golden straw colour and has hardly any smell to it maybe a grainy smell but nothing else and does not have much taste to it at all,definately an easy drinking beer if you like those sorts of beers but the only time i tend to drink this is when there is nothing else on offer and even when i do im still trying to reach for the limes."
"This is another of those beers that I would cane if I was in country but not gonna touch it again here."
"Verdict: cheap non domestic beer that is slightly different than domestics in taste, so drink if you want to down some beers, but are tired of the same-ole-same-ole."
"Drinkability: With a lime and served ice cold it is quite drinkable on a hot day if you've bought into the advertising campaign"
"Overall, not one of the better mexican beers and definitely not worth the import price. If you want a ""lawnmower"" beer there are countless other options for a better price."
"Drinkability- can possibly be drank again, wouldn't usually do it, maybe on a hot day or something, thin enough where it might be thirst quenching but probably only one"
"I find it drinkable but i think if i had to drink it all day i would have to break down and put a lime it to cover the skunky smell. I donk think i would ever but this its not worth it for the price insted of 30$ they should sell it for 12$ and i still prolly wouldnt buy it."
"Ugh.. Rue the situations where Corona is your best option.. Whereas certain Hefe's or such could gain some taboo, frivolous sweet-accent by the addition of citrus, this beer requires it just to reach the level of tolerable. It looks just like yellow nothing. No thank you. Smells simply of adjuncts. Sure, its not actually an offensive odor, but theres nothing enticing about it. Flavor is just all adjunt and, should you encounter the horror of sipping it once its warmed a bit towards room-temp, is mildly-enraging. Mouth is thin, not light but thin and has an acrid feeling. Drinkability, well.. how do you want to define it? Sure, you could chug tons of it while at your frat house's party or at some sort of BBQ whilst waering your khakis and possibly before pushing one of your bro's into the pool while he's still fully clothes..but as for considering what makes me WANT to drink something.. I don't think so."
"Bottom line is that lime makes ALL the difference. This beer is perilously imperfect without it. With it, it is at best mediocre."
"Poured into a pint glass. No lime. White, soapy head that disappears into nothing within seconds. Pours a pale yellow. Smells grainy, fairly clean, but with a bit of funky/skunkiness I can't place my finger on. Mouthfeel is a little slick and undercarbonated. I think pouring this (people typically have this out of the bottle) knocks out the fizziness you'd want. Tastes has a faint skuniness to it and a little bit of a vegetable-like sweetness. Not at all bitter. The shear simplicity of it warrants some drinkablity. A clear bottle makes it look fairly refreshing."
"Drinkability - For what it is, I can drink several of these on a hot summer day. I could think of plenty of better beers I could drink on a hot summer day, but I've had plenty of these over the years when those others weren't an option. I know a lot of you will disagree with me, but this isn't a totally horrible beer for what it is (a cheap, extra light, Mexican brew)...just don't forget the lime! This stuff tastes almost toxic as it gets warm and there's no lime added."
"Drinkability - this is highly drinkable, goes well with pizza, wings, burgers, etc. Pretty well anyone can get a Corona down. This is a beer you can slam all you want, it is what it is and it's popular. Under the right set of circumstances, you can enjoy it for what it's worth."
"For free, this one really is a steal!"
"This ""beer"" is a flat out embarrassment, especially given the cost and marketing of this swill. I don't care how hot it is outside, or how many lawns I've mowed, I will not be ordering this beer ever again, even for free. As bad a beer as I've had in some time..."
"D: easy to drink not becuase of taste but becuase of its thin body. DON""T LET IT WARM! would never buy this beer but would drink it if someone handed me one (like tonight). I liked it better then ""dos equis""."
"d- This is probably the best part of the beer. I believe this is still a drinkable summer beer as long as you wedge a good piece of lime in there. It won't win a blue ribbon after all but it's drinkable"
"Good carbonation keeps this from being a complete stinker. Fairly light bodied, so a decent hot weather chugger. This beer is a guilty pleasure for me. I have no trouble downing these with spicy tex-mex or wings or whatever. The lime actually gives it complexity, but if you have to introduce something to the final product, you need to suspect so major faults. There's other much better macro out there, and much better Mexican beer."
"I'll be honest, this isn't all that bad, but it is a hot day and I just had a burger with some slightly spicy bbq sauce, so it may be the situation helping the beer. That being said, I could think of plenty of beers that I'd rather have in the summer heat."
"d- for me it's very drinkable for what it is, nice cold summer beverage. you don't expect the world when you have a corona. and always add the lime."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: Perhaps its the bomber of Corona I have drank speaking. The beer is thin and watery. While the beer is absolutely cold the drinkability isnt terrible. The carbonation is active but not stinging. So for me this is an improvement over Bud and its ilk. If I had some lime in this beer I might even be enjoying it. Ok if the price is right. Whats the right price? When someone else is buying you a beer. You can never go wrong with free."
"It has one of the most solid bodies of any macro adjunct lager... which is still only medium-light. Decent carbonation. As with other adjunct lagers, the lack of flavor lends to drinkability. It's easy to put back, but let's call it what it is: fermented junk food. Do not drink this unless it's an emergency."
"Average in feel and quite drinkable given its light structure and lack of offenses. Nonetheless, this beer is ridiculously overpriced for what it is."
"D- I love this beer down by the shore pool.. or bbq.. slam them back and have a good time"
"My friends rave about Corona and if they like it that's cool. Problem is, I really don't see the appeal. I think it's because before I tried it, I was drinking the more expensive stuff like Guiness and Sam Adams. I think I'm a spoiled beer drinker."
"Taste: More skunk. To quote the notes I wrote when I drank the beer, ""yuck""."
"Final thoughts: If you wanna drink it, get a lime. It helps with the unpleasent taste. Drink on hot days. Cinco de Mayo"
"sorry if i offended anyone, and i realize that beer in clear bottles gets skunked quickly in the sun but this beer did not see the sun and it was bad, they get even worse with age. two thums down"
"Final Thoughts: This shit straight blows. It's expensive shit too."
"D: I had to drop a lime in it as it warms up, but still not very good out of a pint glass. I just popped open another one, dropped a lime in, and took a swig. That's a world of difference, it just hits the palate differently of the bottle also. If it's hot out and I'm by the pool or on the beach, I'll give it a shot. No sense in bringing a nice IPA out the sun to skunk..."
"That's about it. I exaggerate a little. Don't pretend you didn't enjoy it."
"Overall I think this beer gets an undeserved bad reputation. If it's the skunk taste that gets you, give it a try in cans if you can find it, really above average taste for a macro adjunct. Can be a little pricy for what it is though."
"Picked up a big 24 oz bottle and a burrito to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Popped a couple of lime wedges into bottle. Fizzy yellow color, almost see through body. Smelled like water. Tasted like fizzy lime water. Gotta have some lime in here to give it a little zing; otherwise you are not working with much. Listen, you don't drink Corona for flavor. It became the King of Beach Beers for a reason: drinkability. You can drink one of these in your sleep. Awake or asleep, not much to write home about when you're done."
"D - Being it Cinco De Mayo, I'll probably put my entire 6 pack down no problem but from now on I will never have them without the lime in the bottle. It's the only way."
"Everyone I've talked to either hates or loves this beer. I, as a matter of fact, think its great. It's the perfect summer beer, just add a lime and your set to enjoy the day in the backyard pool or a swim-up bar. It's light and refreshing. It's not meant to be the king of beers, so don't go buying this beer thinking you're gonna get some over-the-top quality Mexican beer. I'll always chose Corona over its peers."
"Drinkability isn't too bad, but the whole beer gets bumped up a couple grades with a lime in it."
"I do not recommend this beer... I can only imagine how awful the light must be."
"D: I feel violated. Honestly, I think this would be pretty good served ice cold as part of a michelada. But as a stand-alone drink, it's pretty rough sailing."
"This beer pours a clear pale straw color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into sparse lacing. The aroma is of faint corny sweetness. The taste is like the aroma faint, bland, boring. The mouthfeel is light bodied with lots of carbonation. Overall, this isn't a very good beer, and I don't understand its popularity."
"For the style, this is not drinkable at all, this isn't beer, it ceased being beer about 2 weeks into its clear bottle journey to america."
"Nothing distinguishable and it's pretty much only drinkable when the weather is blistering, the beer is ice cold (so you don't notice the taste), and with a lime... mmmm, lime."
"I will never get why this beer is so popular and how people think they have a distinguished taste by drinking it because it's not bud light. The only time it's acceptable to drink corona is at a beach party with buddies. Other than this, Corona serves no purpose. An absolute sorry excuse for a beer. Tastes, smells, looks, and drinks terrible. I would much rather go with a Tecate or Negra Modelo if I want something south of the border."
"Drinkability: Not a favorite in the macro group. Even if you add a lime, it still does not taste good. I would not turn it down at a party, but I would also never buy it."
"despite all of its flaws and lack thereofs, corona can be a very drinkable and enjoyable brew. maybe theyve done a hell of a marketing job, but if its a hot summer day, particularly on the beach, this is the first thing ill pick up in the store. quenches the thirst, refreshes, and washes down. really, it wasnt meant for much else was it?"
"Drinkability - Not good. At least I tried it."
"In summary, is it just canned over-carbonated water with poorly brewed and processed cereal grains."
"As with others, this beer has a great color, and appearance... but when you get down to tasting the beer, it is very unpleasant, and does not fit my personal beer drinking tastes. I dont ever imagine me going anywhere and picking this beer up with a meal or for any other reason."
"No lime for me since I was reviewing, but usually I squeeze the lime over the top of the bottle, pour the beer out and then lick the bottle while sitting on the beach. Like a lime popsicle!"
"D: World class."
"I have friends that love this, but I cannot understand. The first thing I notice is the skunky smell, worst of any beer i've ever drank. After 2 of these I'm done, heavy feeling and nausea. I've heard people say Corona doesn't taste like beer, they are right it doesn't!!! I guess the limes make it better, it would have too. No offense Corona folks, but I just can't handle it, but to each it's own."
"Dr. Based on this one today, I'd have to say not so much. But based on last summer (hammock,sweat,lime) it's very very drinkable. I think more research is necessary."
"Overall, it's not the quite thing you would actually ""enjoy"". Either drink something else, or don't drink at all."
"Well this is one of those beers you either like it or you don't. We I don't. The appearance is very commercialized very pale to yellow. The smell is that of gym socks. The taste is...well there really is no taste. The drinkability is very bad. The after taste makes you want to use sandpaper to get rid of it. Don't get me wrong I like beer a lot but this is not one worthy of calling beer."
"D - On a hot summer day, while you're laying on the beach eating street food in an exotic Caribbean destination, a corona is called for. Other than that, look around."
""
"Pours a straw color with a small white head with poor retention and no lacing. Smells very weak but atleast there's noticeable tones such as; weak hop, even weaker malt and a small amount of citrus. Tastes is the exact same as the smell, however I find the citrus note to just be annoying. Mouthfeel was poorly carbonated and only a small step above water. Still just as drinkable as anything else of the style."
"I almost forget that I am drinking a beer when I have this. It more reminds me of a soda that was never sweetened. Pours a yellow, sand like color (or maybe I'm just associating it with those great commercials) with lots of carbonation and no head worthy of mention. Smelled malty and bitter, with a very light, bitter taste that mellows out. Don't drink it without a lime wedge. My favorite macro beer and I don't mind it at times, but definitely should only be consumed during the three warm months of the year."
"D: lots of macros are at least easy to take down, but I've never really enjoyed corona... something about a beer that 99% of the time you see with a lime in it seems odd to me. If it needed something extra, shouldn't it have come that way?"
"I wouldnt recomend this at all try something else."
"Note that after this beer I had a Blue Moon. Man, did it taste good by comparison!"
"D - I find it hard to drink based on the aftertaste and the lingering presence of its poor quality."
"D: Almost as easy to drink as water; but not tastier than water."
"This is making me wish that this wasn't the last beer left in the office fridge after an overly long Friday afternoon company staff meeting, but that's now neither here nor there. Corona is what it sets out to be - fizzy, grainy, skunky as a feature, not a flaw, and sexy in its foreign grittiness. Blah, but I'm not about to lay down in front of this particular bulldozer."
"Tastes similar. A little bit skunky and metalish but not so horrible that you want to spit it out all over the place, I just kept thinking to myself, what the hell is that taste? It is drinkable but I can remember why I prefer these things with a lime it it."
"It's Corona. I mean, what do you expect? It's pretty awful. But somehow drinkable."
"D 3.0 - I actually dig the high carbo & citrus hints in this brew."
"Comments: Not really an off taste until it warms up and then it is not good to drink at all. Refreshing while still cold without a lime it is plain but with a lime it is not too bad (I know fruit shouldn't be added but trying it with and without is a good idea)"
"This beers has it's place but it's usually with a lime and some salt and being sipped on a beach somewhere. Not strong, it's real good on a hot day or a BBQ."
"Drinkability- The only thing about this beer thats expected to be decent at all is the drinkability as you can drink it just as good as you could any water you would get from the tap. Gotta be a beer you have ice cold in the summer at the beach or something. Nothing stellar here and if looking for a light beer even Id still go else where."
"On a hot summer day or just on a regular night while watching a fight or a game this can be an extremely good beer to just kick back and hammer. Dont have to worry about tasting notes/savoring. I can drink 12 of these in one night with no problem...minus the stumbling"
"Mouthfeel is spritzy, light bodied, easy to drink, lemony & semi-dry in the finish."
"Notes from: 7/15/04"
"Despite the bad rap this south of the border brew gets, its still my favorite macro and definitely has its time and place. I usually drink it straight from the bottle and yes *gasp*, I use a lime. Yummy."
"*sigh*... I'm really quite surprised at the consistent D's and F's this beer receives. Compared to others in its class, I don't really think it deserves them. I tried to rate it fairly here, and compare it to other beers in its class. Let's be honest.... it's not a great beer, but in it's class, it certainly rates better than some of the other american macros. I remember once upon a time thinking that all beers were like macro lagers, and someone suggested that I try Corona. I was actually pleasantly surprised... comparatively speaking. I won't buy it now, and if someone handed me one, I would sip it to be polite, but I probably wouldn't finish it. But compared to say... Bud or Coors, it's definitely better."
"Let's just say if this were to go above 40°F, I think you'd have to get rid of it immediately. But hey if its a hot day and you can polish this off in under 2-3 minutes then mission accomplished I suppose. And yeah, forget about a glass, just do the lime thing and go straight out the bottle. I can't imagine why people pay for this stuff...it's basically just overpriced, imported Budweiser. If prices were equal, I'd probably choose this over Bud but is that honestly saying much?"
"I prefer Bud over this lager and many many others."
"drinkability: very easy. only good for long hot days."
"Drink this ice cold with a wedge of lime on a hot summer day and its awesome. Without the lime and in the middle of winter, it's just not very nice."
"Why bother with this? I have no idea why it is so popular."
"D - Very drinkable. I could drink these all night."
"I don't understand why pop culture has let us believe that this is good beer. I remembering being younger and seeing in movies, hearing music, and other places, that Corona was great beer. What??? Really!!?? It tastes like its been left in a steel drum for months. When I drink a Corona all I can taste is metal...and the piss coming through. There are some many better Mexican beers out there, do yourself a favor and stay far away from Corona."
"great ""session"" beer, especially if you are just planning on relaxing outside on a warm summer evening."
"You know what, despite the fact that the beer doesn't have an exceptional taste it still is a good kickback beer. Better than light beers, it is refreshing and crisp. It doesn't hold a candle to most other beers, but as far as good beers to just relax with, it is really nice. No bad smell, no bad taste, I just think of the bad guy from El Mariachi, smile, and drink."
"Taste is mild malt sweetness with a fair amount of hop or hop extract leaving a bitterness in the back and center of the tongue. Reminds me of many european pilsners though a bit light on the hops. Finish is slightly dry. Thanks to the 4.6%abv it is quite sessionable. Mouthfeel is slightly thin. Very similar to many American macros but this has a bit more hops. Good beer with food and it won't fill you up."
"Overall - For the love of God, stop importing this crap. There are plenty of equally crap beers brewed in your country (unless you are unlucky enough to live in a country with little beer production)."
"A very light, tasteless beer."
"Drinkable no, drainpour - yes"
"What can one say about this beer? It doesn't have an offensive taste or a good taste to start. It's an ugly looking color which makes me wonder why they have it in a clear bottle. It has a bitter skunk buildup that leaves a nasty aftertaste if you continue to drink it. Smell is bleh, mouthfeel nothing special. All and all, life is too short to waste on this kind of lager which there is far to much of in the world today. I wouldn't have even drank it except my aunt sent it along with some other stuff she gave us from her bar. I've had seltzer water with a more pleasant and strong taste."
"What can you say about this classic summertime drink... Obviously this won't win over any beer purists or those who actually enjoy the taste of a good beer, but it does have its place on a hot day with a slice of lime. Not a good beer, but a very good drink on a hot day...preferably in Mexico."
"1.2/5"
"Overall: I used to think this was drinkable, but last night I couldn't even finish the beer. Corona is only palatable if you hide its smell and taste with a lemon or lime wedge."
"I've never liked Corona. I always thought it was overpriced when I was in High School because all my friends drank it. I never understood why. I guess it was the cool thing. Whenever someone handed me one, the only way I could drink it without giving a shot face (yea, a shot face after drinking beer) was to put a lime wedge in it. For this I got so much crap from my friends. ""REAL men don't put fruit in their beers!"" "Pussy!"" Etc, etc. Maybe it was the forgettable beer, or the ""fond"" memories, but I doubt I'll ever have this again."
"(rated Jun 12, 2008)"
"This claims to be the number-one beer in Mexico. Its not. Yellow and fizzy, full of corn and pee. The nose is weak and watery, as is the taste. I don't think there is even one hop in this bottle. Do not attempt to drink this without a lime, otherwise you may be able to taste the beer."
"Corona is a nice choice when you're on a beach or in some insanely hot climate (hence their commercials). It is light and refreshing, which you crave when you are sweating your a** off! Me personally, I like to fill the rest of the bottle with a flavored vodka to make a ""dirty corona""....better than by itself if you ask me. Not that impressed if you ask me, considering all the hype."
"Well corona, what do we have here? Nothing. Onto the review. Looks like super watered down yellow color, looks like piss. The smell is brutal, smells a bit skunky, cardboardy, stale. Taste? Taste? This is non-existant. Goes down like water, and tastes like water, with a hint of beer in the background. Mouthfeel, is also non-existant. Very very thin and watery. Drinkability is high, because its like water. Just a brutal beer, if you wanna get drunk this is decent to use. Avoid, otherwise."
"D - avoid, avoid, and avoid. One more word. AVOID. I guess the addition of limes is what drives the marketing, but wasn't impressed"
"Well this is what it is. A very drinkable bland beer that is very refreshing with a lime in the summer time. I don't see any point to shitting all over a beer like this like a lot of people seem to do on this site. There's nothing offensive about it at all, and its not as skunky as ppl claim. Don't drink one that's been sitting in the light and it won't be skunked."
"Bottom linke - I wouldn't bother, I'd only drink it if offered at a bar or something, I wouldnt go out of my way to drink this"
"A very pale gold/yellow color,thin head.Aroma of corn,cat feet,and hay,and skunk weed. Flavor is very watery,kind of a skunky band aid taste, thin mouthfeel,funky finish. I could see drink this if you were really loaded allready but I'll pass.Save your money for some real beer eh."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with a very thin white head that fades quickly. Nothing special about the aroma or flavor other than it is refreshing on a hot day. If it is served freezing cold with a slice of lime on a very humid day it can be drinakble, otherwise avoid at all cost."
"This always comes in 330ml bottles I find, not a very satisfying beer. Also can be extremely expensive."
"This beer is just a whole lot of nothing. It has a pale yellow body without a head. There isn't much taste either, because the beer is so incredibly watery. The only reason why I didn't give this beer anything lower is because it's by no means offensive due to the neutrality of the taste and smell. Extremely carbonated. It goes well on a warm, summer day when there is nothing else to reach for."
"D - it is almost drinkable just a crappy finish doesn't work"
"Drinkability: Mostly harmless. Eh, it's not a great, classic lager, but I will say I have tasted far, far worse."
"Only drinkable if you cram a bunch of limes in it! Otherwise Pass!"
"Not a great beer and absolutely overpriced, but it still hits the spot once in a while. Grainy aroma, very pale yellow pour with a solid white head (at least for a short time), and a semi-crisp feel. Flavor is enjoyable in small quantities and best serves it's purpose on a warm day with a light meal. Overall typical expensive ""import"" brew, better off spending less on a nice American Wheat."
"it is though the best beach beer! and I love beach beer because it means the beer doesn't really matter."
"A friend left this at my house, so I figured I might as well review it. It pours a pale urine like color, with a frothy head. Corona smells sweet, I do not know if it corn or another additive, but it is very sweet. The beer is thin and sweet. There is not much complexity to it, nor hops. The beer is very drinkable. This beer is good for serious quaffing as it is very light. That being said it is considered a good sessionable beer for the masses, but one I would rather skip."
"This is a party beer. If you want to knock back a 12 pack and get hammered this is one of those beers."
"(Great for cruises though!!)"
"I don't hate Corona, but I certainly don't like it as much as I used to. I used to worship the stuff, but as my beer tastes evolved, my liking of this beer definetly faded. It smells funky and tastes only slightly better. The taste without a lime is downright bad. I don't think the lime is in it to give it a citrus flavor, it's just there to cover up the blandness. I won't turn down a Corona, and sometimes I'm just in the mood for a couple of them, but the inflated price makes it even harder than it already is to believe that it's worth the purchase."
"It still baffles me that whenever there's a summer party people are like brainwashed to get this. It's usually like $13.99/12 which is more than most awesome microbrewery 12 packs!!! Anywho, I must admit on a hot day I don't mind one of these with a lime in it but after a long day of work I would never reach for this one. It's way too bland and fake tasting.. go elsewhere for the price."
"I'm not even sure I should include a ""taste"" category. Maybe success minute rice? This beer tastes like nothing, except the faint trace of lime from the added treatment it got. It has zilcho in the way of character. Ditto for mouthfeel. You might as well drink a tonic with lime. But make sure you do so in a cabana. On the beach. Only then will it be ""muy autentico."" My ass. Pretty bottle with lizards on the front don't sell it for this gringo."
"This beer is light straw in color with a short white head, no lacing. The scent isn't overly impressive. Slight corn husk scent to it. The taste isn't overly impressive by itself. Adding a lime makes the beer easier to go down. Although I don't think this is a great beer, I must admit they go down very easily. It's a beer for being out in the bars."
"Say what you want about it being refreshing and smooth. Water is refreshing and smooth. The only flavor is its mild skunk. Otherwise, it's lightly carbonated seltzer. It's highly drinkable, but that's only because it has virtually no flavor. Put it in the freezer for twenty minutes before drinking to get it extra cold, and squeeze in some lemon or lime. Otherwise, it's completely undrinkable."
"Corona is so light in flavor I now understand why adding a lime wedge is recommended - next time [if there is one] I will. This is a beer for one that is not really a beer drinker - intended to be quaffed cold on a hot day. I bet if I reviewed this brew on the beaches in Mexico I would rate it much higher :~)."
"D: Not bad on a hot day but not great. Corona is not my first choice but I will drink it if someone hands me a bottle for free."
"This beer is thin. Pale yellow color. Don't bother pouring into a glass. It's not worth it. Drink from the bottle. It's definitely better with a wedge of lime shoved in the bottle. That doesn't say much for its natural taste. Pretty bland and weak. It seems to be a popular beer among women (as far as mainstream mass-market beers go). I find even the bottle design to be quite feminine, slender and naked. Somewhat sexy. Over all I'd give it 3.5 out of 10"
"Overall impression: Bad. Overrated. This is overpriced Budweiser. AVOID."
"I would gladly throw a lime in this one to improve it. I think it's maybe worse than the majority of Mexican/Central American macro lagers as the flavor has really nothing to offer and the aroma is just offensive."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a yellow with little, fully diminishing white head. Aroma is of straw, light yeasty/dough, and a bit stale. Light body with a bitter flavor, watery. Needs the lime to make it better, and that may not put it higher than Bud Light Lime."
"There is very little aroma or taste, adding a lemon or lime will ""add"" that note; it is refreshing, but that is all you will get."
"Glad I didn't buy this beer."
"My mother-in-law's birthday party had these being served. So I decided to rate them. Appearance was wicked bland with a pale, pale, dull yellow with some frothy lacing on the sides. The lemon flavoring aroma was very weak but did have some yeasty hints to it. A generally bitter taste to the drink with a lacking lemon zest made it a pretty boring drink. Mouthfeel probably was the better dimension of this drink. It was light, watery and slightly carbonated to allow for something relaxing on a hot day. Overall, a somewhat festive drink but the novelty wears off quick."
"Hard to imagine there was a time when this was one of my fav's. Not horrible for pounding in the sun, which I've done on more than one occasion but nah, it's not a good beer. Corny, grainy, sometimes skunky. I'll drink one in the sun if someone gives it to me but I doubt I'll be buying this anymore. For whatever reason it does seem to be OK with spicy foods."
"Poured a clear yellowish gold like canned pineapple. Foamy white head that displayed very little retention and no lacing. Weak. Flavors are clearly those of a Mexican Macro Pilsner. Corn husk, grassy hops, old grain. Again, weak. Highly carbonated and a light body. Bitter and unpleasant aftertaste (limes are used to mask this). Would be awful at room temp. The strange thing about this beer is it has its place; on a hot summer day with lime wedges for example (which is what BL Lime - which I have also reviewed - tries to emulate). Good with a taco, bad drinking solo."
"Plenty carbonated. Plenty thin. Plenty crappy. In desperate need of a lime wedge (or anything) to give it some flavor. Meh."
"Overall: you know."
"D: There are far better lawnmower beers for better prices. Not a very good beer, and not something to allow to warm even in the slightest!"
"D. Well, I tried it. A few swigs, then down the drain, I cannot continue to hurt myself. This is worse than Natural Light. The Swill to end all Swill."
"Neither the mouthfeel, nor the drinkability are nothing to write home about. They don't stand out in any way."
"Well, I'm currently drinking this beer right now. I didn't bother pouring it into a pint glass, because whats the point really with a beer like this. It has a yellow color to it. I took one whif of this before i drank it. It smelled like a skunk, which I haven't experienced with a beer before. Took the first swig taste was worse than pretty much any beer I've ever tasted. I'd rather drink even a best light over this beer. Drinkability I guess is average. If your drinking the beer cold then you could probably drink a whole lot of them without cringing. I think true torture would be serving this beer warm though."
"not the best beer in the world, but good every once in awhile. they spend a lot of money on their marketing campaign to look like the face of mexican beers, but when you actually go to mexico (not cancun or any of the americanized cities) you will not find this beer at all. you will find tecate or modelo. tecate is better but modelo is okay. if your gonna buy corona, buy a sol instead. sol is similar in taste minus that skunky taste that corona has, and you can get a 32oz for the same price as a 22oz of corona."
"D - For the price (about a buck a bottle) this is nothing special, but it certainly beats other macros. I probably wouldn't buy this, but I could easily see kicking a few of this back from the bottle by the beach on a warm day..."
"light straw in color, clear with a short white head, no lace to speak of. smells of corn husk with a slight metalic tinge. taste fresh corn slightly sweet and hint of salt. light mouthfeel and carbonation is good. i like it once in a while ice cold by it self or with a slice of lemon or lime."
"Drinkability: Don't let it warm, extreme cold will mask most of the unpleasantness of this beer. Better off to buy something (anything) else."
"I'm only sure I'm not drinking water in that it's yellow. A cardinal sin. Can we have some flavour, please?"
"D - Goes down pretty easy, one of those cheap beers to have at a party in the summer."
"D - Not as bad as I remember it, but certainly nothing remarkable. I might have one if nothing better was available."
"Notes: For the most part this is really just a trendy drink so for best results serve ice cold in the bottle with the lime and enjoy on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability is okay, but these go very quickly. They're good to satisfy thirst, but that's roughly it. Spend your money wisely somewhere else as this stuff is incredibly overpriced."
"Drinkability is very good because I could have about 20 of these and not really taste too much. I don't know why I would want to, though. Probably the worst Mexican beer I have ever had."
"Not really worth the money I paid for. Now if I could go back to my college days...nevermind."
"Overall, from what I have seen and heard, I expected this to be much worse. It actually wasnt bad. I wouldnt seek it out with any regularity, but if I should find myself on a Mexican beach, this may be my beer!"
"On a hot day one could drink a number of these for refreshment but not much enjoyment if you are looking for flavor."
"Pours a dark straw yellow with not much of a white head. The smell is pretty dull with not much going on, some malt and grainy smell. The taste is lackluster (without a lime), minimal grainy flavor, with an odd aftertaste. The mouthfeel is not the best, bad flavor balance (for what is there), and not very smooth for how watered down it tastes. The best quality is that this one is a very easy drinker because the lack of flavor, can put a few of these down on a hot day."
"This is the epitome of Mexican beers, yet to get anything out of it, fruit needs to be added. I never understood that. My friends all say it tastes like a Mexican meal in a drink form. I wouldn't go that far. Pours very pale yellow, virtually no head. Smells corny, some malt, slight hop. Pretty easy to drink, which is dangerous, cuz it's not that good. Best served cold. Would pass on this for more flavorful beer for sure."
"As far as the lime trend with Corona, i just cant do it. I hopefully won't have to drink one again to find out if lime actually makes it drinkable."
"M/D: Is watery but leaves the mouth a little parched in the end. Could be very drinkable if the flavor and smell had a little work done on it. I wouldn't pass up one offered by a friend."
"Ok you know this beer already. Best thing about it is the lime that you put it in it to get it to taste like something. My best recomendation is to give it to your neighbors that you don't like or that don't appreciate beer since it is at least cheap. Would say that a glass of water tastes better. It does go down easy on a hot day."
"D- Drinks well when cold"
"Avoid at all costs, unless it's brutally hot, these are in ice and there are plenty of cut up limes nearby. Then again, why not just keep a better beer on hand to begin with and skip the fruit? Oh, unless you have scurvy, or something."
"Yea look it's your average beer, with mexican theme, and a lime. woo. I guess the only thing to say is that this beer is easily located with friends who dont explore their beverage tastes houses, but when given the choice of Corona and anything else they have, I'll take it."
"Yellow color with a tan head. Looks better in bottle. Smel is of sour malts and bad hops. Taste is of dried malts. Needs a lime to add to flavor. Feel is light and some what refeshing. This is decent to drink when you can't taste anything because it is so hot outside. Mexico makes much better tequilas than beers."
"Drinkability: Yes, this beer is drinkable but as someone else said, its drinkable in the same sense that water is drinkable. That being said, I opted not to finish my bottle."
"This is dreadful. It's watery, exceedingly bland, and has on old, dirty water taste with the merest hints of apple and rice. There really is little else. It's gold with almost no head at all, the aroma, feel, and taste are as I mentioned above. It's not really nasty, but it is slightly less enjoyable than merely being bland. At least Pacifico is clean and inoffensive, but this is just slightly unpleasant."
"A lot of people drink this with a lime wedge, but I have always thought it was trend that lended to the ""tropical"" feel of this brand. Then again maybe the acid from the citrus cuts some of the undesirable tastes, or at least dulls them. If I review with a lime and it is different, I will edit."
"D: I really tried to be fair with this beer. I guess it serves its job as a summer thirst quencher. Best served ice cold to mask the beer's generally unpleasant and uninteresting flavor. I wouldn't buy this on purpose ever."
"The pour created a bone-white head that was reducing even as I was pouring. The NE-plus quality clarity in this pale-yellow beer was startling. They must have filtered the living Hades out of this beer before packaging it. The nose was light, a little on the sweet side, but not offensive. Mouthfeel was thin with a sweet, honey-like lager taste on the tongue. Finish had a mild sweetness, but nothing really jumped out. I can see why so many people add citrus fruit to this - it is pretty flavorless. Certainly, I've had better, but I've also had worse. Much worse. I can't really see returning to it, though. Maybe on draft or in bottle, just as a try anything once scenario, but no more cans of Corona Extra for the Woodman."
"Pretty drinkable for what its worth, whatever that means. Still not gonna buy it."
"Not much can be said about Corona that hasn't been said before. The beer looks about like piss and I imagine piss would taste better. There just isn't much of anything to the beer. No smell. No flavor. If you put enough limes into the beer you can get it to be almost drinkable."
"I had to opportunity to try it so I took it. Expecting the worst I actually found it drinkable. The taste was reasonably fresh, with a sparkling element that gives a ""slight"" sweetness in the finish. But overall the beer is quite dry, one dimensional, and it tastes like poor man's beer ingredients (i.e corn) have been used"
"Thanks Corona for nothing."
"This pours rather flat looking with strong skunk. Taste is grainy and a hair malty. The skunk tastes too. Mouthfeel is overcarbonated. Drinkability suffers due to the skunk. I know we are not supposed to review skunk beer, but you think these people would figure it out. Everyone I have ever drank is the same and it does not appeal to me."
"Overall: I would drink this beer as my standard low-quality beer if (i) it wasn't so expensive and (ii) it didn't make me look like a douchebag."
"D-If you can get by the taste it actually goes down smooth, but thats probably because it's so watery."
"P.S. Jamming a lime wedge into it doesn't exactly make you look macho."
"Big fan of Corona for what it is. Big fan."
"I've gotten into arguments with friends who have sworn to me that this is one of the best beers ever. Some of them tell me that I'm not drinking it right if I don't add the lemon or lime; and on occasion I have humored them and added said citrus (after first making it clear that the beer should be able to stand on its own without the addition of fruits). In either case my opinion remains the same. Corona is unfit to be bottled. I apologize for the graphicness that is about to spew from my keyboard, but I swear that the recipe of Corona is: drink tequila, then urinate into a bottle and let chill."
"Appearence pale straw color almost no head. Smell corn almost no hops hint of grain. Taste same as smell no aftertaste, thin body, high carbonation. Drinkability not to good I see why they put lime in this one that would be the best part of this beer."
"Goes down easy, but that's the main goal where this is spawned. For the love of God, don't even think about trying this any warmer than ice-cold. If I'd paid for this, I'd be much more pissed off. Drink this in Mexico when you've already seen the local source for fresh water and actually saw someone or something crapping in it. Otherwise, avoid."
"Decidedly, an undrinkable beer. It's mystifying why this is such a popular drink."
"This flattens fast, unsurprisingly, rendering it almost undrinkable. Unless you enjoy bottled cat sick, don't buy this. The worst thing of all is that it costs a decent buck, and for what? Garbage."
"Mouthfeel is highly carbonated but kinda slimy, and body is paper thin. This contributes to a very high drinkability and refreshment. The only circumstances conducive to enjoying this beer are 3 digit temperatures."
"Light medium gold with no head. Smell mostly of the lime in the drink, and not much else. Taste is what you'd expect in a pale lager with a slightly different, bitter, yeast, or skunk taste or something, but not too bad. Mild malty taste and a drinkable beach beer, but not great."
"PS - this beer sucks by itself w/out the lime."
"Overall: Drinkable... but that is it. This is another beer in which it would be more enjoyable (and cheaper) just to go with water."
"I will never have another one of these beers, the only way to choke one down is with a lime in it."
"D- Average, Corona is what it is. It is a light-bodied lager that is easy to drink. And with an ABV below 5%, it is nice sometimes to have several of them at a social gathering."
"d: Utterly undrinkable if not ice cold. Lime/lemon/orange greatly enhances the experience by masking what little flavor the beer has. Perhaps its just a case of highly effective marketing, but given the proper situation (ie: on a beach with a girl in a bikini within reach) this can be an enjoyable beverage. I can't imagine buying it, there are so many better Mexican beers and if you are looking for a refreshing macro lager, this is a poor choice. Plus, for the price you could get any of your local micro brews."
"Conclusion: stay off the bandwagon and spend your money on something better."
"D - Would go better with a lime, but even that is pushing it. Could not finish beer. :("
"D - Without a lime this is a horrible beer I haven't had this beer in a few years until now and I wasn't missing anything"
"Welcome to the beach. This is where this beer makes its marks. 90 degrees in the shade and 90 percent humidity. There it has a place as a wet refresher, I guess. I might go for water. The bottle smell is pure corn. The color is evident in the bottle, no glass needed. The taste is dry, good for the heat but not for the beer conasiuer. Pure flat hopping on a corn base. The mouthfeel has the right carbonation so that may be the best of this brew. The drinkability is very questionable, after drinking this I have a sudden slight headache. I think I got sucked in by the propaganda. They should show somebody mowing the lawn then imbibing this swill. Then showing them going for water to wash it down."
"Lots of fuss about this brew,seems like a favorite among everyone,i think the novelty is wearing down now.Pours a lite yellow clear color with a decent white head,lots of bubbles and fizz,left some mild lacing.The nose is where it hurts,strong skunk smell,and lingers for awhile,some mild grains and old corn comes at you.Taste is not that bad though,way better than what it smells like,quite crisp and refreshing,mild grainy grass and corn comming thru,got quite a bit of carbonation,like drinking a pop,would be good on a hot summer day,didn't really mind this one.Will have again,maybe try it with a next time."
"D: One of the easiest beers to drink. This beer gets dumped on so much and I guess it deserves some of it, but, if you're in the mood for something light and something you can just suck down when you're hot and thirsty, then this isn't a bad choice. I'll admit to purchasing a 6er every few months."
"D- I don't drink this beer, I might have 1 if it was given to me and ice cold."
"Piss yellow color with a light smell of I don't know what. Maybe its lime,that could be it. Mouthfeel isn't great, but its not so bad to merit a 1.0. taste is a little sour and bitter, really not worth drinking but when you go to a mexican diner, what beer is there to drink? This is probably one of the better mexican beers."
" I don't care if you are on a beach in Mexico, look for something else."
"D--I see why people want the lime with this. It really has no flavor. I recall the several that I've had and seem to remember I can only drink this with lime. In that case, save your money and buy a decent hefeweizen."
"Drinkability: this is just an awful beer with no flavor. The lime must provide some flavoring to make this drinkable. I had this for beer for fun during a holiday get together, and just couldn't finish it. I was also frowned upon for asking for a glass and no lime. Ugh."
"Drank straight out of the bottle, no lime/lemon in there. A very light yellow color. Didn't check out head retention. Smell is very light and the macro beer smell comes through. Don't smell any cereal type flavors in there at all. Taste is of a macro brew with a strange sweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel is very light on the palate. It's highly drinkable...good for a hot Saturday afternoon. Overall, not a good taste, but great to drink if it's hot out."
"Overall, very drinkable. A good lawnmower beer. I actually enjoyed this much more than expected...even had a few. Went well with the food."
"It isn't worth the money it sells for, and its popularity proves the adage that there is no accounting for taste."
"Color is yellow. Head is non-existent. Lacing is missing in action. Aroma ? I guess that was what the lime was for. Tastes like macro-brewed beer, no more no less. Thin mouthfeel but it does have a lot of sodapop-like carbonation. Drinkability  I would drink a million of these if they where free, if I am paying for them then I am looking for something better."
"So I dont normally review macro's but I'm bored. Pours yellow with fizz, no head retention and no lacing. Smell is some malt, some sweet, some corn or grain. Taste is of skunked Bud Light. No, seriously, I really cant distinguish much of anything other than some (presumeably) corn syrup and malt extract. Light and crisp does feel ok on the mouth and though I hate to say it, it is easily drinkable, a refreshing beer on a warm day. Please dont drink for taste though, only drink if its hot and you're thirsty."
"Poured this beer into my session glass. The appearance is ok for what it is, very pale straw color...in the bottle it almost looks yellow. The nose is almost non existent in my opinion some slight malt and corn flakes, but very faint. The taste very bland and what I would expect from looking at the beer, and I am serving ice cold. The mouthfeel is very carbonated. Not the best beer, but on a hit summer day on the beach, I enjoy putting them back. Thus, a 3.5 for the drinkability based on refreshment"
"Pours a pale yellow with a medium white head. Smells slightly of corn. Taste is almost non-existent, a slight amount of grain and sweetness. Bitterness from the hops is there. Mouthfeel is thin, carbonation levels are high. Pretty drinkable due to how light it is, but the flavor is so bland, there are much better choices out there. Corona costs the same amount as a lot of craft beer, so buying this is something I would probably never do."
"Tastes seems to be thicker, sweeter out of the can vs the bottle. Sweet corn, some grainy malt and a bit of metallic astringincy. An average macro, much better out of the can although the one's I had in Acapulco in 2006 were better"
"When it comes to this beer, ""skunked"" doesn't apply. It's actually SUPPOSED to smell that way. God only knows what this stuff is like when it actually has been skunked. Absolutely awful diluted rotten vegetable taste, zero lace, weak head; just about the only redeeming characteristic is that it's pretty drinkable. But that's moot, since I wouldn't even drink another Corona for free."
"From a typical 12 ounce bottle, poured a golden yellow color with minimal or no head... Served with a lime, this was a nice, refreshing light beer that would go really well on a hot, lazy summer day chilling on the porch or the beach... The flavor is crisp and the lime really complements it... Not much going on with the smell - bland and pretty uninviting but then again, I wasn't expecting much... Mouthfeel and drinkability are decent, and I could down a few of these, but with so many better choices out there to choose from, definitely wouldn't make this a session choice... Overall, I liked it and would drink it again if offered, but I wouldn't run out to buy a sixer..."
"Dunno whats worse, this or Sol."
"Well, the memories that I had of this beer were fonder than what I experienced this time. It's not a horrible beer or anything but I don't know that I will revisit this one anytime soon."
"drinkability - I use to drink this a long time ago. Brough back memories and the question why."
" It is clear after trying this beer that the fancy ads on TV are trying to compensate for the low quality of beer they sell."
"Pours a very light amber color with no head and minimal lacing that immediately slides down anyway. Smelled a little like corn with a lot of skunk and some alcohol. Not too much taste, but what taste there is isn't pleasant. The aftertaste of salt doesn't help matters much. Essentially has the consistency of water. If you want me to respect a beer, it had better respect me first."
"Nothing offensive about it, aside from the price - I guess marketing isn't cheap. It's a shame this is the image most people have of Mexican beer, try to find a better authentic Cerveza - it'll probably be cheaper too."
"Review added 11-20-2007, translated from french 2-27-2008."
"D: A fair beer, better than most macros, but still, at the end of the day, its just a boring industrial lager. There are a lot better lagers out there, and better beers for the same price, so why waste your time with Corona? I'd drink it if I'm in the Sizzler, and there's no better beer around, but all and all, it's just not very good, and I would not spend my own money on it."
"The taste is corny and sweet until some hop moves in and then it's gone. Finishes watery. Yuck. ""nuff said."
"This beer is about as tame as it comes. It looks like beer, and almost smells like beer. It has a very inoffensive taste and minimal mouthfeel. It leaves me feeling unsatisfied. The beer has its place at times, but it is not something I seek out or think of when I am looking for a macro."
"I dont know what all to say about this one. I always seem to get a skunky smell when I open a bottle of this stuff. The beer is OK and cheap but not my favorite by any means. It has a little bit stronger taste than most macros, so its OK. Good on a hot day or tailgating for a game."
"I couldnt believe I had yet to rate this. Pours a yellow color with white head that dissipated pretty quickly. Has a chemical metallic odor to it. Taste is light and of corn adjunct. Not really offensive, but bland and boring. I guess the drinkability is reasonable high. One of the worst buys considering the price."
"This is not a bad beer, but it is cheap and something readily available. It really has to be served with lime to have much flavor. I would say that most everyone has tried this. I would rate it a try, but not something I would buy regularly. Not recommended without lime."
"Corona, in my feeble opinion, is similar to Coors Light. Watery, crackly and thin. The lime gives it a tasty overhang. I use the ""RealLime juice squeezey."" You can regulate your lime taste. Corona is great on hot days and the clear glass, although it can impair the taste of beer, makes it a handy chug after mowing the grass of after a good session of 'you know what.' The clear glass motto is null because the rate of sale for Corona is so fast the impariment of flavor is not affected, similar to Miller High Life."
"it has a nice golden wheat like color and it is crisp and goes down somewhat easy with the obligatory lime....It finishes very, very, very, clean in my opinion, but i must admit it does not make my top choice, any apologies to its fans...But it was drinkable..I really dont have much to say about this particular beer..."
"D- 2 summers ago, i attempted to cut down a large tree with my uncle. i was way up there with the chainsaw and somehow the top part of the tree ended up on my neighbor's roof. to make a long story short, we patched up the roof, and sat down on the log in the blazin heat and cracked open a few coronas. may uncle said ""damn that's good"" and i said ""yeah"" and everything was just a-ok."
"Without a lime, this beer is just about undrinkable. I am glad to see that this beer is already Not Recommended. The pour is OK but it is so light with a light white head. The aroma is just horrid. It smells like a skunk. I have had this beer many many times as people for some reason love it, but everytime I try it, it still smells like a skunk. The taste is just as awful. It is sour and bland. What is worse is that it leaves the same taste in your mouth that is left when you drive by a dead skunk on the side of the road in the summertime with your windows down. Overall just a bad beer and should not be consumed without a lime. That is the only thing that can make it drinkable."
" The beer does look beautiful in the bottle & if it weren't for the alcohol in it, it would be soda, my other water alternative...so conserve water,and drink Corona instead !!"
"Sitting outside or at the beach on a summer day, this beer is great. But for everyday drinking, not my cup of tea, but better than Bud or Coors or Miller, etc."
"Drinkability- Not horribly unpleasant if your looking for somthing to taste cheap and pay relatively high amounts of dough for it, if you like that sort of thing."
"This beer does have drinkability going for it, but water is drinkable too. This beer tastes much better with huge slice of lime in it. Pours a lighter then straw almost neon yellow with no head no lacing. Usually all I like to taste is the lime. Mouthfeel is very watery."
"Without hot sun and lime, no thanks."
"Taste is refreshing, but not great and always thought the smell was a little weak"
"I find it odd/funny when I'm out at a bar and someone (friend or otherwise) tries to act like a beer connoisseur by ordering a Corona. Personally I can't bring myself to drink one, although I have to handle it occasionally when someone buys a round of it. Although it's not undrinkable, the beer is unimpressive and flat. There are much better 'south of the border' beers out there if that's what you're going for."
"To be fair to the Corona this was one of my first beers to drink. The appearance is a light gold color with little or no aroma, except for the lime. The taste is simple and plain but on a hot summer day it is easy to take down 8 to 12 of them, as long it is a Saturday. There really wasn't much in the way of mouthfeel most likely from its simple ingredients. Overall it is an okay beer to drink when eating Mexican food and or on a hot summer day similar to cracking open a coke when you need the sugar and carbonation fix."
"This beer doesn't do much for you unless your laying out on a beach in cancun and watching girls go by in bikini's. but other than the commercials, that's where the good qualities of this beer stops. It really has no taste, hence everybody putting lime in it. No real smell, and the watery mouth feel really leaves a lot to be desired. I don't know that i would drink this beer if i was in an emergency. Not worth the money or the time."
"D - Gets a 2.5 because you could theoretically drink these all night long (Im sure many have witnessed it) but I'd rather drink lemonade."
"I would certainly insist on a lemon wedge, but I don't think I'll have to."
"Clear color with a head that disappears fast. Aroma is mainly of skunk (really no surprise here). Taste is pretty thin and watery. Bland. Tastes of roasted veggies. Not a good beer trait. Ick. Bleh. Never buying this again. I can see why they place so much emphasis on a lime."
"This beer is the perfect example of when people talk about ""yellow fizzy beers"". When you put a lime in it then it doesn't taste too bad and it covers up the original smell."
"Clear bottle, skunky nose, pale straw color, a taste that makes me just smack my lips and go ""What WAS that?"" No wonder people drink it with lime and salt. I sell beer, and I make it a point to steer people away from this one. I see no reason why anyone should spend eight dollars for six of these. I try whenever I can to get them switched over to Pacifico or Tona. Baby steps, but hey, I'm doin' what I can."
"D - A basic light lager flavor w/ some drinkable qualities, but not worth seeking out and I would probably avoid this in the future."
"D: This isn't the worst tasting beer but it tastes much like any other macro, so why pay extra for the same thing. Awful."
"M: Watery, malty, a little fizzy."
"¡Salud!"
"Overall, I thought Corona Extra was easy to drink. But it did leave a pretty awful aftertaste. Maybe this is why people drink it with salt and lime. Personally, I think it is more fun to experiment with different Mexican imports, all of which are priced similarly."
"There's no skunkiness, there's no adjunct nastiness. Heck, I'd take this over a Bud or a Coors any day. It ain't good, but it ain't really bad, neither."
"Drinkability is good enough"
"The feel is light and watery and malty. Leaves a minor, wheaty film. For a pale lager, it is dead-average. And it is summery. Overall I suppose this might be good for a hot day, and maybe it's closer to an iced tea than a beer, so for that, I suppose it's fairly drinkable. You could do worse for a pale lager; just don't expect much flavor."
"To me, this is the definition of beer coloured and beer flavoured water. The aroma is very weak. The colour I've only seen before in toilets. And the taste is watery. Like Budweiser, it amazes me how many people order this beer instead of the multitude of great tasting treats in Canadian bars"
"Still, it's a very drinkable beer. Like I've said in many other reviews of south of the border beers this is a great beer for hot, humid Florida summer days. When you want to quench your thirst and don't want water this is it. Open a bottle, cram a lime down the neck and enjoy. Good stuff."
"D: Not 'undrinkable' but I'd only have this as a 'last resort'; maybe if the local water was unsafe to drink. I tried this today merely because it had been so long since I'd had one and (funny) it was the six-pack that had the most bottles left at the end of the day (I believe 5 of 6 remained). Not recommended, but I'm glad I tried this again as a reminder of why craft beer is the path I've chosen..."
"Eric"
"I have heard lots of things about the lime in this beer some people says it change the taste of the beer (of course,it would taste like lime), but a friend was in a trip to Mexico some years ago, when this beer was not that popular in US and he tell that the tour guide tell him to rub a lime on bottle mouth to repell flys and insect. Is this true don't know but don't put anything in my beer anyway."
"""Beer is proof that God loves man."" Benjamin Franklin"
"On a hot humid day...much like today...after mowing the law a bottle of Corona (without the lime, sorry ladies) is actually refreshing. That may be it has as much taste and as tap water. But seriously, this beer reminds me of all the great times I had in Mexico and for that it is worth the money to get a six pack every once in a while. This beer is bland and doesn't have much carbonation, but is tolerable. If you are looking for a good Mexican beer I would still rather drink XX!"
"Better than Bud. Even without the lime wedges. With a lime, this is merely a limey beer- you can make any cheap beer limey. Without, it's a relatively unoffensive, bland, tasteless thing. I had one for the first time in aaages and someone commented, they made a LIGHT version of this?! I can't believe you can get any lighter. It doesn't taste awful, it's not metallic, and it's great on a hot day, as are most brews in this style. Stick a lime in it and it's even less offensive. But Corona is WAY too expensive. There are half a dozen other brews in this category, that come in convenient cans, by the by, that are 1/3 the price. I'll take one of those any day over this."
"The company really went through the effort to make Corona Light? Really? It is hard to imagine this being more weak or flavorless."
"There is no head, only a yellow body. Taste is like the smell, and bitey at the end. There must be some form of complex alcohol in here to create this effect. It is not pleasant. Fortunately, the mouthfeel is an OK light body like you'd expect in a lawnmower beer. But then you swallow. What a corny, astringent aftertaste. How is the the biggest-selling import beer for the US? Shame on you, US! :)"
"Drinkability- Decent it is not the worst beer ever and it is some what refreshing on hot days."
"Yep, pretty much what I expected, except worse. The brew delivers a very pungent, peppe-le-pu scent that simply never went away. How can a beer with such a lack of flavor and character carry a scent that strong? Clear, straw, and fizzy wraps up the appearance. Grainy and earthy flavors never go anywhere. Weak body with no texture, but, hey the carbonation seems abrasive. Finishes grainy ...and with that damn smell!"
"If some one else is buying I am prepared to drink , but it wont get any of my premium beer dollars"
"How Corona can call this brew ""Extra"" is beyond me. No offense to the brewery, but how the American everyman beer drinker can be bamboozled into thinking this is a premium quality beer is stunning. Pours a tepid pissy yellow with the standard American pilsner foamy head. Smells of pee-pee and light hoppiness mixed with water. Taste is very underwhelming and no doubt gets a boost when the obligatory lemon or lime is squeezed into the glass. Mouthfeel is non existent. I guess that this is highly drinkable as a session beer since there is very little substance to be rated. Credit must be given to the marketing staff of the brewery, since most Corona drinkers are missing the boat when it comes to taste and variety in America's beer industry."
"D - If you just want something cold to quench your thirst, this is not a bad choice. If you're looking for taste and an experience, you've come to the wrong place. At best, this is a refreshing beer."
"Final Statement: After I downed that poured sample I put a couple of lime wedges in the bottle neck for the rest of the drink. This beer needs it! It's actually not bad when it tastes like a lime cooler, its the only way this disgrace is drinkable. Not recommended."
"Es la cerveza mexicana mas vendida en el mundo, pero no es por su calidad ya que en su elaboracion utilizan procesos quimicos, y se fermenta rapidamente, es una cervezas sin cuerpo y si te la sirven fria y tienes mucho calor es algo placentera tomarte una. Su envase es transparente y no tiene etiqueta, esta impreso en la botella el nombre. En algunas partes del pais venden corona en envase ambar para que aguante el sol y no se heche a perder."
"This is an extremely overpriced beer, that needs a slice of lime to have any character whatsoever. It is quite refreshing, but if you want taste, look elsewhere."
"On tap at city place in west palm beach, FL for cinco de mayo, poured into a plastic party glass, pours a piss yellow with no head and heavy carbonation bubbles. Usually this beer has a serious smell of skunk, but not today probably from being in the keg, Still it has no distant smell maybe of heavy carbonation. This did not impress me on tap and would only drink if given to me for free,I would never pay for this crap in a bottle."
"Good one for mowing the lawn on a 90 degree day."
"D: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all, there really isn’t much to this beer, which makes it easy to drink but prevents it from being the least bit enjoyable."
"D- Bland, light-impacted flavour and slightly off mouthfeel make this a beer I usually avoid."
"used to be one of my favorites somehow, but now i can barely drink the stuff. avoid."
"why? i guess the advertising. i just don't understand why you would pay more for this crap, it's basically your average macro with some faint corn adjunct aroma/taste. no malt or hop character to speak of. fizzy and very carbonated which provides the crisp finish. just get a soda water and put a lime in it. ugh. hey, you look cool drinking it though!"
"Don't worry about pouring this one in a glass, the longneck bottle will cuddle just right in your hand. In regards to the clear bottle, just use common sense and don't store it in direct sunlight...who does that to beer anyway?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. It's tastes very watery and is relatively easy to drink. I just simply have no idea why anyone would want to. It's not a good beer at all. Steer clear."
"I don't care what others may say i love Corona for its great refreshing quality and the nice crisp taste. I wouldn't say it is a beer that everyone would like but it is a nice tasting beer with a lot going for it. The look and flavor is great because it is great for sitting back on a hot summer day. I often hear people mocking it and claiming that the Mexicans won't drink it but I don't mind because they can send it all to me. I would pick Corona any day of the week because it is miles away from ordinary."
"Overall: flavorless, bland and empty. I dont see why this beer is as known as it is. My first and last try!"
"overall this is not a very good beer at all, they run a very good marketing that makes people, like my cousin, think this is a really good craft beer, not recommended"
"The drinkability is high only because you could pack down a bunch of these and not even know a difference, i cant rate it more than just a smidge above avg only because if i had a choice, id drink something else."
"I can obviously drink these but not at home in the 12 ounce bottle."
"*NOTE: trust me, don't mix shots of tequila with this beer or you might end up on the wrong end of a gun."
"This brew is practically the same as Sol in terms of flavor and criteria for drinkability. When consumed ice cold, with at least one lime wedge stuffed in the bottle, it can be refreshing. However, if it's not ice cold it's simply not drinkable. All of that said, I am still not sure why in the hell this is so popular year-round with people, as the only flavors it has are simply off flavors. Also, as the price it's sold at, I'm not sure why some people spend the money they do on it. I would love to see how popular this brew is if limes were unavailable among a community of Corona lovers for a month's time."
"Served in its proper glassware, the bottle, with a wedge of lime. Normally I´d eschew the beer in the bottle and fruit thing. But as far as I can tell this is the proper serving technique. There´s still that cheap, grainy flavor, but the fruit helps make this drinkable and not an unpleasant experience. Try this once and call it a cultural experience."
"Ok a couple more to go and I am done with my macro experiment. Had the corona ligh a couple days ago, didn't think it could get worse. Then I cracked the regular. Pured a dark yellow with no head but some visible carbonation. Smell was very moldy and stale. Smelled like wet straw, not appetizing in the slightest. The taste was just odd, it tasted old, funky, and moldy. Some hints at maybe some corn, but predominated by a wet bread taste. It feel clean going down, but as it warmed, wow this just should not be allowed to warm. Overall this was not as good as the light, if you could call the light good, and was honestly the worst of the bunch, for now."
"Pours a medium yellow, little head..minimal carbonation. Smell is mainly light corn. Taste also has cornelements, but with a syrupy sweetness that is not overly bad. Mouthfeel is medium..not great, but not bad. Easy on the drinkability scale,,,syurpy smoothness. Probably a better summer brew."
"The color is too light and yellow, and the odor is so-so. Taste is about like a typical American lager - thin and simple. It is OK if nothing else is available, but one can certainly do better."
"I would recommend this beer only with the lime and do not pour it in a glass! It needs to filter through the lime as it does in the bottle."
"Things got worse with the taste. If it were bad then at least it would have a taste but there's nothing there. I kept it in my mouth for 20 seconds at a time (like wine) but it is so bland that you'd get the same effect from an aspirin and a glass of soda water. There is NOTHING. Continue drinking produces a build up of bittery persistance but there are no interesting characteristics at all. No yeasty/malty flavours, no hoppy notes, NOTHING. The mouthfeel has a fine carbonation but is flat if you leave it longer than a few minutes. Girls in pubs add lemon or lime to it. This is absolutely necessary. The bottle should say ""flavour sold separately"". I now know why I don't like this beer. It doesn't bring revulsion like a can of VB, its just nothing. It is devoid of substance. Make it go away."
"By far the most disgusting beer you can buy right off the shelf. I mean honestly, it just looks repulsive in the damn bottle! Anyways, I'm sure we've all been involved in the discussions on the boards about its marketing job, but Corona is by far the worst beer (especially for the money) that is largely consumed in the United States. The smell is all corn, but at least it's got a stronger malt to it than most Mexican and Macro-USA beers. The taste is horrid, literally piss in a bottle shipped to unsuspecting Americans for too much of thier hard earned cash. All corn this beer is. The mouthfeel is slightly heavier than most Mexican beers, although I don't know why...to much adjuncts wieghing it down possibly? The drinkability is alright, but if I want to stick away from the beer shits...I stay the $@$#@ away from Corona! I worked at a place where chicks and dudes would buy this in the 12 packs for $16-17 some odd dollars and laughed everytime thinking about how much they've been suckered"
"This is definetly a beer that you have to acquire a taste for. It has a strong almost bitter taste to it but after pouring a couple down your throat the following go down a bit more easy. Don't get me wrong this is above average stuff but if your used to the weak domestic beer you definetly have to acquire a taste for this more potent brew."
"D - A mediocre macro lager, the taste is not nearly as offensive as the smell makes it out to be, although probably because the carbonation takes most of the taste out of the beer; a party beer, not to be sipped"
"Corona has a light golden color and virtually no smell. The taste is predominately corn...and I assume that is where it derives its' sweetness from. Slight metallic finish even from the bottle....or is that the one drop of extract from the batch? Not impressive at all but utterly poundable...if you dont want taste and you're just looking for a decent result...this is STILL a bad choice; because you could save yourself 4 or 5 bucks for every 6 beers if you just bought schlitz original....that's about 16-20$ a case...NOW who's throwing there money away? This is the ONLY beer that is improved by adding fruit....and in my opinion... if it's not good out of the bottle then why bother? If you add the price of four lemons or limes to the price of a case that's 18-22 dollars you're wasting... now if it's free.... and over 80 degrees(the weather not the beer)... and it has a lime.... yeah sure....sounds appealing"
"Get out the lime and comfort yourself with the notion you could finish a carton without a feeling bloated, but that's about the only upside to this waterish beer."
"Other notes: I find it amusing that despite over 450 applied reviews, no one has seen fit to send in a picture of the bottle. That speaks volumes about this beer."
"I think there are people that actually like it, but not me."
"The bottle should read La Cerveza Mas Mal."
"what a bad experience. i wouldn't drink if this was all that is left in the world"
"It's not awful, just mostly unimpressive."
"Pours a straw color, almost yellow, with a small white head that disappeared very quickly and left no head. Not much sense in pouring this beer in a glass but I did anyway. The smell was grainy, artificial sweetness. The taste is grainy, a bit skunky, very light bitterness. The feel is not terrible, not nearly as watery as some macro lagers, nice carbonation. The drinkablity is fine; it has to be cold and near a beach. As it warms it becomes a bear. I like the painted bottle."
"Taste is decent enough for a macro brew. Drink this ice cold and just enjoy it for what it is."
"Drinkability: I used to think this was an okay beer for a macro lager, but I was probably 20 the last time I had one."
"This cerveza pours a light pale gold and is highly carbonated, so it quickly loses it's head. It's smell is a tiny bit hoppy and there really isn't much taste to it, aside from the ubiquitous lime, which is a must. Fair mouthfeel, not bad, but not good either. In my opinion, is a rather mass produced cerveza that works only after my sense of taste is numbed on the good stuff."
"Lime or no lime? Lime. It adds some flavor, and there is little pre-existing flavor to overwhelm."
"First beer I ever tried. I've had so many great beers since then, but every now and then I get a craving for one. Normally, I would suggest having Corona in the summer time.. squeeze the lime in there too - it helps! Average to below average on appearance, smell, and taste, but very drinkable non-the-less. Salud!"
"Pours watery and thin. No head at all. No smell except C02 buzz. Tastes like nothing. Feels like water in the mouth. You really do need to add a slice of lime. Heck -- I like the acid citrus of lime. So on a hot summer day, with a twist of lime, this ""beer"" is almost as refreshing as a vodka-soda with a twist of lime."
"It's not the best beer, but its not the worst either. I got this from my dad's refrig. It had a pretty yellow color. There was not a smell at all. The taste was kinda weird I don't know how to describe it, but it wasn't good. I did like the mouthfeel though. Barely drinkable. Don't drink and review."
"D- had amazing drinkability as celtic had just beat man utd 1-0 at parkhead therefore this was absolute nectar, on an average day it is just a summer beach or bbq swill. Average!"
"Ok, this beer is horrible for a NYC cold evening, but perfect for drinking on a hot beach. It's refreshing for a hot day. For everything there is a time and place I guess. Here in NY it is incredibly overpriced. Pick up some Brooklyn Brewery brews instead."
"Drink-Ability: I have to admit the first time I ever drank Corona in mass quantities I ended up with one eyebrow shaved off and a bald spot on my head, so I dont have the fondest memories of the brew. I recommend other Imports from across the border than this one but it is still a good summer time brew when masked with a couple of lime slices and a salted rim. P.S. Must sever COLD!"
"Poured 12 oz bottle into a glass mug. Yellowish color with a thin head that almost fizzled away immediately like a soda. Smelled kind of skunky. Tasted slightly bitter but was smooth going down. Very thin mouthfeel. Add a lime to it and it becomes pretty drinkable. Otherwise, average drinkability."
"This is probably one of the worst beers I have had. Not to mention how it is absurdly overpriced and looked at by the beer layman as premium stuff. I'm baffled."
"Well you either like this beer or you don't. I can tolerate it, and if it's this or Bud, I'll grab one of these every time. You can drink a lot of them too, if that's your goal. So if you haven't tried it yet, have one and see if it's tolerable to you. Me, I'll still drink them, but only when I have to."
"Sure this may not be the best beer in terms of taste, smell, appearance, mouthfeel, or drinkability- but its still one hell of a beer. Go ahead and call me a fool that has fell for the marketing of this brew, but frankly, I don't give a damn. I love having this beer on the beach, in the sun, at JB concerts, etc. I love it all. And yes, I'll have a lime with it please. I know it doesn't do much, but it looks cool in the commercials."
"D- Drink it on vacation in mexico or something..."
"Overall drinkability is poor.... only if there is nothing else, will I sample another Corona Extra."
"This beer pours a very unexciting pale yellow with a bubble head that disappears as fast as you can drink it. It smells like a skunk light beer with an overly sweet smell and a slight metallic touch. The taste is bland and sour. It has a slightly wheat flavor but thats one of the few things that even reminds you that its beer. In all I cant say much positive about this beer other then if you drink it fast enough you can hardly taste it."
"Pours a clear urine yellow with little head the quickly dissipates to nothing. You don't pour Corona, you buy the bottle or can and drink directly from it...period. The smell can range from not 'too' bad to totally FOUL depending on the batch you get - or should I say hot/cold cycles the beer has been through. It is an American macro style beer but the mouthfeel and carbonation is very different from a Bud/Miller/Coors beer. It is a little stale and watery without any sweet/corn flavor that most of the style have. The aftertaste lingers and you will burp it for quite some time. There is no question that this beer ice cold is a great warm weather beer (pounding a 6 pack without any ill effects). I think it gets a little more bashing here because of the hype and I can certainly understand that. From a value standpoint, Corona is aweful. It is WAY to expensive. I have an occasional bomber for 2 bucks now and then but there are much cheaper 'lawnmower' beers that are just a refreshing for a summer afternoon in the back yard. Drinkability is high because they go down real easy - next thing you know you have had your 6 pack and you are 8 bucks poorer. This Cerveza is not terrible, it is a price that makes it a stinker - in more ways than one."
"Comments--I'm not a big fan of macro lagers, but this is probably the most unoffensive of the lot."
"Make no mistake about it - this is a T E R R I B L E beer. Mexico makes some bad beers and this amongst the worst. At least it is common practice to disguise the taste with fresh citrus. The lime is the only part worth ingesting."
"D- This is very drinkable and my alternative to Lite. I can drink these all night though I would prefer somehting else. There are better beers from the land of Sol but this is the easiest to find. A little expensive though for how below average it is."
"As much as I would avoid buying a Corona to drink with a nice steak dinner, theres always a certain appeal to buying it as ambience at a cookout. Its like the balloons at a birthday party; absolutely pointless but incomplete without."
"I don't know how this is the biggest imported beer in the U.S. And at twenty bucks a case as well. The lime thing doesn't help it at all either."
"Get my buzz on- y (session)"
"Somebody left this in my fridge after my 30th birthday party -- I swear I told everyone that I'd have beer for them to drink! Pale yellow. The lazy beginnings of a head appear during the pour, but at best it resembles the head on a glass of Mountain Dew. Thirty seconds later, there is absolutely nothing there, not even a ring of bubbles. Not flat, though. There's plenty of carbonation here. But in any case, this sorry beverage doesn't need a head to help release its estery aromas. Nothing but skunk city. A clear bottle'll do that, I suppose. Anyway, skunky flavor up front as well, and then a pitifully brief corny sweetness, and then...nothing. I really think I've found a beer that is virtually flavorless except for its lightstruck flaw. Terrible. Thin watery mouthfeel. This truly does need a lime and certainly does NOT need to exit the vessel in which it was purchased -- either into a glass or into your mouth. Even as a ""lawnmower"" or ""tropical vacation"" beer, there are many, many other better options. Please avoid."
"Does it stand alone? No idea. I am too scared to try! It works as it is."
"Cheers!"
"The watery body and overall weakness make this beer a popular choice on a hot summer day. Personally, I can think of at least 100 better choices for warm weather brew. It is amazing how the management team at Grupo Modelo have successfully convinced the public that this skunk- enhanced beer is something special. Other than the ads and the sophisticated- looking bottle, there is really nothing to cheer about with Corona Extra. Mexico makes much better beer than this."
"Pours a very clear straw-yellow with a fizzy, purest white head that dissipates instantly and leaves no lacing. Smell is corn. Period. Lots and lots of slightly rotten corn. Taste is along the same lines, with a slightly bitter grainy note accompanying the ever-present corn. Mouthfeel is watery and thin, with absolutely nothing to commend at all, and drinkability is reasonable. Nasty-ass corn flavoured water in a clear bottle. At least I didn't pay for it."
"But I must admit, Grupo Modelo has done a fine job in convincing thousands of Americans that Corona is somehow special, much better than the big three, and worth the higher price tag."
"Suprisingly one of the most expensive beers you can buy (in Ontario at least) considering there is next to no taste in it."
"Overall a poor mexican beer that I see no reason in buying again. Id pick Dos Equis Amber Lager over this anyday."
"M & D- Same as Sol here, high carbonation, easy enough to drink, it's just that I don't want to. Far too watery and lacking flavor. Good with some Mexican food though and better with a lime, but why should you have to add anything to a brew? I prefer something with more body and flavor."
"I won't waste your time with descriptions of mouthfeel, smell, taste, etc. The skunk like odor escaping the bottle should tell you everything you need to know. Avoid this sorry excuse for a beer at all costs."
"Corona Extra pours a typical pale macro yellow with a thin white head from a twelve ounce can. Smells primarily like corn. Tastes like corn/adjunct. Interesting to try this out of a can, it's certainly not skunked, on the other hand it's certainly not good either."
"It was summer, and I thought i'd splurge and by some corona. Definetly not worth the 15 bucks a 12 pack. This beer is light in color, and well light in taste. It's a good beer no doubt, but not an awesome beer. There was a somewhat skunky aftertaste. Maybe a lime would help with that but i didnt have any."
"This was a very average beer, about as good as can be expected from a beer in a clear bottle. Might be okay on a really hot day, or at the beach."
"But as a beer, there are better on the shelf at your local grocer. Light in color and taste, there's just *nothing* there."
"I usually don't mind drinking macro beer...I don't enjoy that much, because it's rather boring usually, it but it's usually far from unpleasent. This, though, has only one redeeming factor, and that is that it's easy to chug a cold bottle of it to quench a thirst. Trying to savor any of the flavors that this beer has is futile."
"Looks the same in a glass as it does in the clear bottle. Okay....I know it smells skunked and if not for the lime wedges it may be almost unbearable most days, but when ice cold and tailgating at a Jimmy Buffett concert ( like last night ) it goes down really easy. Very crisp, light body beer that is a guilty pleasure on hot summer afternoon."
"¡Salud!"
"Normally I have a policy of only reviewing for beeradvocate beers which are unadulterated, i.e. no added lemons in my hefeweiss or fruit or anything like that -- even if that's not the way I'd normally drink it. Since I've got a large enough sample and I've completed my review, I'm squeezing a quarter of a lime into my Corona. It helps. Instead of drinking kind of gross bland skunky water, I'm now drinking fizzy skunky lime juice. The sharp acidity and sourness masks most of the unpleasant flavors in the beer, significantly improving drinkability. Is this good? An unfair advantage? Eh, I'm not too worried."
"Appearance is light yellow with a slight white head. The smell is nothing special--hints of corn. The taste is good for a light-bodied beer. This beer is perfect for a summer day -- the mouthfeel is good, with a fair amount of carbonation. Drinkability is high since it'd be easy to drink these all day outside at a BBQ or just kicking back. Seems to have a bad rap on BeerAdvocate.com...but...seriously....it's average is lower than Rolling Rock?!?!"
"D - It is drinkable, especially on a hot day."
"My god, please don't place one of these in front of me again. I was only too happy to split a bottle of Shakespeare Stout with my friend so that we both could wash the taste of this crap out of our mouths. I won't ever drink another one of these, even if it is free."
"As far as drinkability, I admit that I can, and have, drink a few if the occasion calls for it, but not one of my first choices."
"Drinkability - Its good hot summer day beer if you're a college student just hanging out. You have to have the limes though."
"I tried this with lime in it a while back - not my thing, adding fruit to beer...A guest brought over nips, and I wanted to see if it could stand alone. If you drink this, which I do not recommend - put limes in it (I don't like adding fruit - but this needs it)...better yet - just avoid it."
"I would avoid this beer if at all possible, but it would be possible to drink one or two on a scorching hot day."
"All of the nicknames I have heard for Corona run through my mind. Frankly, however, the beer gets a bad rap. There isn't a lot to it; and it's expensive (many macros and German imports are a better buy). But there's some inherent fun in sitting in the shade on a hot day and sipping a Corona (yes, with a lime... always with a lime.... sorry). They go down easy. And cold. And that's about it. But everyone has to try a Corona (yes, with lime) at least once. It's Spring Break all over again."
"Corona plays silly games with your tongue, biting it and promising heavenly pleasure, but never fulfills the promise. Forget about it. Don't look at the ads. Take a real beer. Give a healthy example to your Corona-crazy buddies."
"The biggest downside to Corona is the price tag. At $27 I was jacked, as popularity and their attractive ad campaigns continue to push the price up. All that aside, Corona is what it is; a good party beer and nothing else tastes like it."
"Although I had have this beer alot when I was younger, I haven't had the taste for it for several years butI had another at a friends BBQ over the weekend. Not wanting to be thought of as a beer snob, I had a few. Although the beer is refreshing on a hot summer night, there was not much taste to speak of, except for the hints of lime since I jammed one into the bottle. The body is pretty faint and the taste does not linger long but I guess that is the point and why one can consume a bunch of them in a night, as I did."
"Feel free to enjoy this with a slice of lemon, or lime, but don't make it your #1 beer."
"Bottom Line: An OK Mexican Lager that i wouldn't go out and buy myself but I would drink it if I wasn't the one paying for it."
"With lemon: it passes more quickly, perfect body, good head.. . i mean.. . excelence, 2 tumbs up to mexico for creating this beer."
"I was searching high and low to find a good beer in a can that I can take to the pool. Futile search. So I grabbed a 12-pack of Corona in cans, a lime, and headed to the pool. Now, grant you, Corona is what it is, but I actually found myself enjoying this out of the can with a lime thrown in. Watery, yes. Tastless, yes. Corn notes, yes. Carbonated, yes. Enjoyable, yes!!! Maybe the hot day got to me, but I'll buy it again for the pool, unless my beer guy can get some Dave's Pale Ale in for me."
"Drinkability: Yes, it's easy to tank this and say it's awful, etc. etc. But it's something I do like to drink during summer every once in a while. Like I said, if you're sipping this in front of a fire with a cigar, something's wrong, but if you're hanging out with folks who aren't craft beer fans and are grilling out, I see nothing wrong with it."
"No wonder everyone's trying to get over the border."
"Herbal, noble hops along with adjuncts, skunk hair, pale dust covered malts and more skunk combine to make this one of the worst beers I have ever tasted."
"After having a Corona Light, I cracked this open to see if it was any better. The beer pours out just the same, into a pale straw with no head. The smell is actually worse in this beer because the hops aroma is a little bit stronger. Unfortunately, it is very skunky and offensive to the nose. There isn't much in the way of a grain smell. The taste is a bit sweet, and hints at some grain, but it's not all there, unfortunately. The hops are much more noticeable in this beer compared to Corona Light, but it is still very faint. The moutfeel is very thin, though the carbonation is one small redeeming factor. In all, this is a hops flavored batch of water that isn't very good unless you're thirsty on a hot day. I don't think I'll get this anytime soon from the store, but if someone offers it to me on a hot day, I won't turn it down."
"This beer has a horrible aftertaste if you drink it by itself. Why do you think it is served with a lime? The lime helps mask the taste of this beer. I can only drink Corona when I am already pretty drunk and can't taste much anyways. It seems to be the ""in thing"" around here with the college kids."
"It does the job on a hot day. There's nothing to disguish this beer from other decent macro lagers. It's certainly better than BMC, IMO, but you'd never buy it to appreciate beer. It's simply to quench your thirst on a hot day. I'd rather be drinking lemonade or iced tea."
"Not the best of the light Mexican lagers, but there is a time and place when these beers have a certain appeal. While I rarely drink Corona here in the states, I did drink a lot of it the summer I spent working in rural Mexico. After a long day sweating in the sun, a cold watery Corona tasted just fine. Then again, I may have been suffering from heat stroke."
"d: This beer does hit the spot on a warm day (with or w/o lime), but that's about it."
"12oz. bottle that I chose to get since it was Cinco De Mayo and it was the special of the day at a local dive bar. I had this out of the bottle because there were no mugs, but that's ok since they put it in a clear bottle. The clear bottle really shows off the urine yellow color of the beer. I kept trying to get a smell out of it, but the only thing I smelled was beer. I thought maybe it might smell like something, but nope just a beer smell. I tried it with out the lime and I was quite surprised by it. I thought it would be totally bland but I noticed a slight hint of hops in there. You really need to shove a couple of limes or lemons in there to make it taste better. The mouthfeel was nothing. No aftertaste, just nothing after the beer goes down. Let's just say that it's a good thing this beer is cheap. Something I wanted to try just once and I learned my lesson."
"I am not impressed at all."
"D: Could probably choke it down, but not pleasantly. Just this side of drain-pour."
"Ahhh...Corona. Brings me back to days when beer was only for drinking a sixer of these (and other crap) within a few minutes. Pours literally urine yellow, no head and very fuzzy. Smells all skunky. Tastes a bit like skunk and citrusy flavor, why add a lime? It's already there. Water like mouthfeel. Overall, well for the price of a micro you can buy this junk, man people are stupid for thinking this is fancy ass stuff. But I had to try it out again for old time sakes."
"This is a poor beer. While it is refreshing, there is very little to distinguish it from any other macro lager. The adjuncty taste of corn is only very slight, which makes it more drinkable than the rest. There is minimal flavor, and even less body. While I usually despise fruit in my beer, a lime adds a lot of flavor."
"7 oz bottle left by some dinner guests. Pours a white soda-pop-like head over a crystal clear light straw colored liquid. Smells of skanky Saaz hops and corn. Some tin. Tastes wet sweet, but foul. Corn, cardboard. Noticable hops that are Saaz tin-like. Not very bitter, but full of musty straw flavor. Light body and strong carbonation. Judged to style, not my preferences."
"If Corona was the price of Bud Light, I could support it, but I think price is an important consideration; it defines our access to the beer. Corona is overpriced and not worth the price that people have no problem paying."
"This beer is one of the most over rated beers IMO. People are always bragging when they spent some extra money on corona. I think they've wasted their money. It has little taste, and the little taste it has is awful. The worst thing about this is the price (although i know it is imported. I will say that I did not have this beer with lime, but I was highly disappointed when I went to taste it with all the hype that surrounds it."
"This is a drinkable beer, but lacks character and flavor. Its not worth the money for an overpriced import."
"Overall this is a beer for high school and college jocks who don't know the first thing about beer. Add a lime to give this water some flavor, and serve ice-cold to reduce the dry aftertaste."
"This is a unflavorful yellow beer. The price is extremely high. This is a very watery, unflavorful beer that has simply been advertised to be a great vacation or special occasion beer. The flavor is light along with the aroma. But I will say you won't have any problem drinking 9 or 10 becuase of it's light consistency."
"I had this beer from a bottle with the lime wedge at a bar. The head is medium and the beer looks light yellow. The aroma is very weak with a bit of malt and hop scents being detected. The taste was also pretty weak and was very light. The flavor was very simple and I want to say I detected some adjuncts that cheapened the experience for me. Nonetheless, it was crisp and a bit refreshing with a medium amount of carbonation. This makes a good choice for an inexpensive beer to be enjoyed in a backyard BBQ fashion or on a hot day (although others are just as good). Admittedly, I'm not a light lager man at all. I'm also not trying to trash this beer at all as I know that many people enjoy it. However, I guess my basic sentiment is that if you're only drinking a beer for it's ""refreshment"" value and not the taste, why not just drink a nice cold glass of water and skip beer altogether?"
"-Salud X 3 (see photo) yes... those are Coronas"
"This pours a light yellow with a small head that disappears quickly. I can't say anything about the smell because I can't smell anything. The taste is weak,light,and watery. Now I know why people put limes in this beer. The m/f is light and weak. Although this is a real bad beer, I know I will have this again at occasions were I know I will drink alot,i.e. tailgating, beach party, or BBQ. It's light and you don't have to worry too much about getting too drunk. Plus sometimes you have to drink what's at the party. Cheers."
"I find it very interesting that authentic native Mexicans call this trash beer."
"A pissy-yellow colour is mated with a strange skunky, yet somehow sugary smell that has an odd corn scent to it. Watery corn mash taste with sugary essences to it. There is no one particular flavour, but rather a blend of weak, industrial additives and general lack of any real hop or malt presence. Thin, actually undercarbonated and very lacking in almost everything. Hardly even drinkable...Mexican food, generally strong flavoured and spicy, would burn out any flavour from this."
"Every other bottle i purchased was either labled 6.0 percent alcohol or 4.5 percent alcohol. Only in mexico .... but it was a damn good time."
"Very easy to drink, amd light. I can see why every barbecue I go to in the summer has them. Though if I wanted to be refreshed I would just have some water. Then have a nice light pale ale."
"It just goes to show you why companies pour millions into advertising to get millions to pour utter swill down their gullets. Any beverage that is consistently a skunkfest and requires a fruit to help it go down does not deserve to be called a beer. This is what you are served in hell (and people actually pay money for this!)"
"One of the worst. Before tonight, I had never had Corona. I want my money back. Pours out to a light yellow color with very high carbonation. The head of white foam hung around, but looked like an unflushed urinal at Wrigley Field. Terrible aroma of wet cardboard and wet fart. Taste was similar, but luckily i've never experienced a wet fart (in my mouth, that is). The only redeeming fact was the mouthfeel was decent; aside from that, it's pretty bad all round. I'm gonna pour it out. My recommendations to Corona 1- use brown bottles. 2- use better ingredient 3- Keep this stuff in Mexico until then. Not recommended."
"My parents drink nothing but Corona and Corona Light, I have no idea why, maybe they have fallen prey to the marketing wizards who seem to have put a spell over the people who absolutely love this stuff. As a marketing dude, I think what they have done is genius but as a beer drinker I would never pay that much for this type of beer when there are so many other similar, cheaper beers."
"Offers very little in the way of taste, fragrance, or appearance, but if you shove a couple lime wedges down the neck, you basically get a fairly tasty, fairly drinkable, flavored beer. Lime flavored beer, that is. Without the lime, I find this completely undrinkable, but with it, it's somehow almost refreshing. I almost don't consider it a real beer, but I also don't really mind putting one down at a Mexican restaurant once or twice a year when the mood hits."
"Drinkability: Nope. Again , not my type of beer. But there is a beer for everyone, so enjoy"
"Drinkability: I haven't said anything good about this beer, but this is certainly very drinkable if served ice-cold with a lime. I actually prefer Corona Light, because it is slightly more refreshing; this one has a strangely sticky mouthfeel."
"Looks like a golden, sometimes-bubbly beer. The smell is a tad skunked, damn clear bottles... whats the point in these things anyway? The taste isnt too terribly skunked though so thats good. Its hit or miss with these ones. Very bland tasting. Corny/grainy flavor, a little bready, not much else. Very faint tasting, nothing offensive. Clean finish. The mouthfeel is decent for a beer of this style. Drinkability is okay as well. I wouldnt go out of my way for one of these, but I suppose its a little better than most of usa's macro lagers."
"Drinkability - Very bad macrobrew, particularly something considered an export beer. If you're buying something cheap, stick with Bud or Natty Lite."
"It's weird though, even though nothing really stands out in this beer, i would continue to drink it. If I were at a party with some friends and they had some ice cold coronas, what the hell right? Don't forget to put a lime in mine... better make that two slices..."
"While it may not be much of a beer for us "" beer drinkers "" , it is really good under the hot sun when your thirsty. ( lime is definatly mandatory for me , would NOT drink one without it. ) Nothing special , but very drinkable in certain situations . ( cutting grass , out on the beach and forgot to get better beer , ETC...)"
"Can drink many as its like water."
"D = this is a lawnmower beer plain a simple. nothing special, really. I wouldn't waste my money on it when something like pbr or old style is available for less than half the price."
"The color is a bright gold but the head has a hard time getting going and then what little head shows up fades quickly although there is a little foam the whole way down the beer. The smell and taste are the usual corn like flavor characteristic of the style but is very water down. The mouthfeel is waterery with sharp carbonation. Overall it is easy to drink but the carbonation is really harsh so it gets an slightly below average drinkability."
"Corona is to beer what the hot brainless blond cheerleeder you went to high school with is to people. Looks great, but no substance. For some reason, that beer in a bottle that's just been pulled out of the ice and is condenced over is pretty near to the most appealing looking I've ever seen. I'm not sure why, I find this so asethetically pleasing since you could also argue pretty well that Corona's color is a dead ringer for urine. Anyway, this forced me to rate the rest of the attributes a little lower than I otherwise would have. First, because the price is a big turnoff imo and for that reason I don't think I'd reccomend this very often. They charge real premium beer prices for Corona, and that's ridiculous. There's no excuse. The quality sure as hell isn't justification, and neither is the fact that its an ""import"". How much more could it possibly cost to ship this to NJ than say Sierra Nevada? Anyway, the smell, taste, and feel are nothing to write home about. They aren' t good or bad, just extremely bland. There's a tiny bit of sweetness, a very vague notion of hops, you can tell this was better done than say Budwieser, and its got enough body that you won't mistake it for light beer. But that's it. Nothing much hear folks. The reason why lime does so much for Corona is because that's almost all you can taste if you drop in a lime wedge. This is in sharp contrast to the couple of ""Whites"" I've tried of late, which go well with citrus because the citrus compliments their own noticable flavor. The only time I reccomend Corona is if you plan on drinking beer at a barbeque all day, and its real hot out and someone else has paid for it(If I wasn't concerned about inflating the overall rating past what I think it deserves, I'd give Corona's drinkability a 5). Then its bland inoffensiveness would come in handy. Otherwise you could probably get yourself two of something that tastes much better for what Corona costs. Its not awful though. I might pay the ripoff price if all I could have was Corona, or one of our American ""Big 3""."
"mmmm skunky! I could smell the skunk before I even poured it, and I wasn't sniffing the bottle. The smell of this beer is lightstruck plus yeast and maybe a little burro urine. It pours a decent golden color with no head whatsoever, even pouring into the middle of the glass didn't generate any head to speak of. The taste is sorta sweet, and sorta hoppy, but nothing you can really make out. It has a lingering aftertaste that I can't say I enjoy. Mouthfeel is actually pretty heavy and a little creamy, but does nothing to help the rest of the beer. All in all, it's not great. I won't be buying this again, especially at australian import prices."
"Drinkability - So bad that I can't drink another. Maybe if I had just mowed a lawn, or was at the beach. But at a party or anything other than that, no way would I drink another."
"Stick a wedge of lime or two in it and you've got manna from heaven. I don't understand it. Does anyone else?"
"I would hold a sixer of these for if alternative for water on a hot day."
"Yuck. As far as I am concerned, Corona is about the worst beer in the world. Lime/no lime - it doesnt matter. It tastes like crap either way. I wish I could be more contructive with this review, talking about the hidden flavors and whatnot, but I really can't. I'd take a natty light any day."
"poured a pale yellow color with unstoppable white puffy head. Smell is minimal with only a slight sweetish character found. Taste is also minimal but refreshing (maybe the lime helps with that) Finish is very mild, but not offensive. An easy to drink beer on a hot summer day."
"oh yeah, and there was recently a discussion in the beer forum about beers that are good out of the bottle, as opposed to poured into a glass... i'll pop a lime wedge right in the bottle and say this is one that might be better with no additional dirty dishes"
"Stay away from this one."
"A little bad than its sister corona de barril; prefered by gringos with lime; its hops and malted smell; bitter and soft body taste; i try this beer ion special ocassions(weddings, partys, reunions) good for all mexican food and most seafood; try in a shoot glass; 90% recommended."
"As long as you add that lime wedge"
"Yack!"
"there is a story about the slice of lemon usually added to the bottle in a bar: Mexicans apparently used it to clean the rusty remains of the cap (not sure whether that is true but maybe one of our Mexican friends here could shed some light to it) ..."
"This has a very pale straw appearance that looks kind of un-beer like. It's not impressive. It has an initial flourish of carbonation but that dies quickly as does the head. The smell is primarily grainy: corny (literally) and cheap. The taste is very grainy too, not a lot of malt or hops to speak of. It's very watery and light. This beer would benefit from being consumed on a 100° but really has very little to offer to somebody sitting down to enjoy a beer."
"12 oz. with no freshness date. Knew I'd review it some time or another. Pours a clear gold with a thin 1 finger head that doesn't leave lacing. Smells like metal and some sweetness. The first sip had no taste. The rest of it tastes like adjuncts and metal with an average mouthfeel and average (for a macro) drinkability. Overall a macro at micro prices. A beer this price should be 2-3 times as good."
"Well it is what it is. An overpriced import in a clear bottles with a painted lable. I drank it from the bottle with lime jammed down the neck. It killed the skunkiness and overpowered what little taste this brew has. I lke to drink Tecate or Sol as they are cheaper and taste better IMHO. Corona is one of those summer beers that is popular with some guests and helps cut the heat. It is great for those times when water is too heavy and you need something light to quench your thirst...(Grin)."
"I really wonder who could tell a difference between Corona, Red Stripe, Flying Horse, Taj Majal, etc. All are considered ""not recommended," but Corona is noticable lower rated than most all other beers. Sure, it's nothing great, but it's no worse than many others. I realize marketing sells the crap outa this stuff, not flavor, but it honestly isn't THAT bad especially when compared to the TRUELY undrinkable swill like, say, Old Milwaukee Ice or Charles Reibenbach Ice Ale. Even if they market the hell out of that stuff, it will not sell. Corona sells because it doesn't taste that bad. Very little interesting taste of any kind whatsoever, actually. It's slightly malty-sweet, but that's the extent of fancy descriptions. If you get a fresh batch and don't let the clear bottles (CLEAR! They're as stupid as Samuel Smith!) ruin it first, you seriously don't have that much to bitch about."
"Drinkability: At parties in the summer where my options are Miller Lite from the keg or Corona from the fridge, I can happily drink a half dozen of these perros or more without feeling much of anything. Gotta have about 5 limes wedged in to the last one if youre gonna drink that many though."
"I had this in the bottle with NO lime. I only had two and got no buzz, but somehow it gave me a terrible headache. This is a very overrated beer. It reminds of some Miller stuff except it's nastier and more expensive than anything Miller makes. I will never buy this again."
"For me, this is good at the beach or barbecue but once fall arrives, I don't consider another until Memorial Day..unless its free of course."
"Pale yellow, with a little foam. IN general, it tastes like if it was frozen and then put in the sun, what is sometimes called Burned. I would avoid to drink this beer as much as possible since the after taste is a little anoying. It is known as Coronita in Spain, due to some legal issues, but Coronita in Mexico is a smaller presentation. NO cans found in Mexico but available in the USA."
"Unless served with limes (plural), this beer is very unenjoyable and most likely undrinkable."
"Drinkability: A world-famous brand, but one of the most overrated ones too. I have had better stuff from Mèxico, uh XX"
"Quite possibly one of the worst beers on the planet. Appearance resembles ""morning urine", smell is rather skunky and unappealing, Tastes like crap, however it is almost always served with a lime with gives it an exceptional drinkability. With the lime inserted it is as drinkable as Perrier and goes down just as easily. would take no time at all to polish off a 12 pack. Overall however this beer is little more than headache in a bottle and wouldn't reccomend it to even my worst enemy."
"Average mouthfeel. Not drinkable at all. People will almost always drop a lime or three in this beer to offset the acidic nature of the beast. That kinda works. I highly recommend that tactic if you're ever stuck drinking this overpriced, overhyped turkey. Next time I housesit, I'm leaving the fridge alone."
"Tastes of salt, dried and fresh, crushed lemons/limes rise to the surface in the initial sip and are replaced by plums in the finish. Upon warming, brine and seafood in the nose...hints of grapes in the aftertaste. Souvlaki, yeast, and mozarella emerge too. I mention these latter flavors not to suggest that the beer is complex, just to indicate that as it gets warm, funky, random tastes appear. Very cold, this is a guilty pleasure. Warm, it's all feet and naval cheese. (The 1 for appearance is because of the anemic look and the appearance of having already been recycled. I'll recycle my beer myself, thank you very much.)"
"This is not a decent beer."
"You have to worry about any beer (other than some wheat beers) that highly suggest you add a wedge of citrus to it. I can't believe that this is the #1 imported beer in America. The only reason it scored so high in drinkability is that it goes down like a lime Perrier on a hot summer day, but then again so does lime Perrier. Why is it such a popular beer? For the same reason that Vodka is the most popular liquor. No taste, thus it is not offensive to anyone. Its a shame when there are so many good, refreshing beers out there."
"Well a typical piss yellow appearing macro brew lager.I do like bottle though. Smell is half corn and wheat. The taste is of corn and wheat. However, add a lime and you can drink it like soda. I relize its not a great beer but its not that bad either. On a hot sunny day its the beer of choice. So I have to give it a higer grade than most macro brews."
"It poured clear like yellow mexican pee pee with little tiny bubbles. And is that Sulfer or Salt water I smell in the beer? I dunno but hopefully they dident put any of their water in it! It tasted overly carbonated and like a soup made out of salt water, corn, and wheat. Yum Yum! A piece of advice when visiting Mexico. Drink Tequila, Cuban Rum, Absinth, and the real German Jaggermeister with wormwood in it."
"Pours a light gold tone. No noticable smell, just a hint of grainy light lager.Doesn't taste very good, and it goes down even harder. definitely better withOUT the lime. I suppose if you like the taste its drinkability would be great, but this import is most definiely not woth the extra money. La Cervesa mas fina es asi asi."
"Cool refreshing and mexican. Other than that, there isn't much to say. Enjoy it with a lime wedge...everyone else does. Pours light golden yellow. Little head, no retention. Smell plain and pale. The taste is the same, plain. Drink it cold, very cold."
"the appearance wasnt anything to brag about. its a very pale yellow. smell is ok, not a distinct hint of hops or anything. the taste was almost like a perrier or other sparkling waters. mouthfeel was good. drinkability was good, especially in the heat"
"Goes down like soda water but took a bit off my thirst."
"I had a BBQ a few weeks back and only served fine micros and regional goodies. Several ""friends"" brought some brews of their own that went unattended. A leftover mixed 12 pack of Bud Light and Corona were amply used to water my flowers periodically. I smile when I do it"
"There must be some truth to the story I heard that bartenders started the trend of putting a wedge of lemon in bottles of Corona in order to deflect customers from the fact that the beer is essentially tasteless. I can't say that Corona tastes bad - that would imply the presence of such a thing as taste - but it is watery as hell and it looks, when in the bottle, a lot like urine. I guess if they were giving it away on a sultry beach in Mexico I would think about drinking it."
"As soon as my neighbor wasn't looking, I dumped this disgusting liquid on the ground and pretended that I drank it. Stay away. Far, far away."
"I am sure this beer has its place, but today is not that place. Color is frightening pale. Nose is non-existent (which may not be all that bad). Taste is not much--corn maybe. My favorite part is the half a lime I shoved into the bottle. I like lime. Bit of something else. Mouthfeel is crisp. That is nice. Might be drinkable any other time when I have been working outside."
"Note 2: I'm still stuck trying to figure out how this beer is so popular, other than the heavy amount of marketing."
"This beer is thirst quenching and easy to drink. Not a quality beer by any stretch of the imagination. Corona is yet another one of those macro beers that I rarely purchase, but wouldn't decline if offered."
"Corona with a lime after a long day's work on the convention floor may not be a belgian trappist ale, but it's not bad either!"
"Extra? It should be ""Lacking"" since that is what this brew was in almost every way compared to beers I consider similar to it like Miller, Bud, etc. It's basically yellow water with a slight bit of alcohol in it and I don't see why it's seemingly so popular with bar crowds. If it had a high ABV, at least then it would serve a purpose by getting you buzzed without having to drink a dozen of them. No thanks, I'll pass."
"well, i don't rank this beer as low as most on this site obviously. it isn't great, but its not as bad as a bud light either. i would put this as a decent beer to bring to parties, b/c alot of people drink them and you don't feel so bad about sharing something that isn't too precious to your heart. its also good for the girls as they do not tend to be as judgemental about beer as those of us that really care about it. i consider this beer just under average, not good, not terrible, just there..."
"Bottle from a friend's fridge while house sitting. Pours a urine sample yellow with a foamy, qickly disappearing white head. Aroma is of light skunk and even lighter malt. Taste is thn, watery, cheap commercial malt with no hops to be found antwhere. Watery, somewhat fizzy mouthfeel. Overall, hey it's Corona. If you want flavor either add a lime or order something else"
"Drinkability: The soapy, dishwashing liquid notes ruin everything here. First Corona I've had in years, and certainly the last. I understand why people put a lime in these-to obscure all the off notes. I would pass on this even if I were on the beach in Cozumel."
"It came in a 7 oz bottle, which was enough."
"Drinkability: A world-famous brand, but one of the most overrated ones too. I have seen better stuff hecho in Mèxico..."
"Had a couple of these last night, needless to say, I was not impressed. I decided to drink it by bottle, and even if i did drink it by my prefered pour, I still don't think this review would change. I must say it didn't look like it had any different of an appearance as other lagers. I popped the top off, and right away I got a whiff of skunk, disgusting. Upon my first sip I came to the conclusion that this was basically water with a very limited beer flavour. My opinion didn't change for the rest of the night. Not too bad of a mouthfeel, and its overall bad qualities didn't make it very drinkable. My final thoughts of this beer goes as follows: Way too expensive (not enough bang for your buck, you might as well save the money and buy buck-a-beers), ann completely overrated."
"Whoa! Just as nasty as most reviews noted. Good grief, its skunky smell lasts thoughout the glass, and the taste  wow, stale ol meats . No wonder you pop the lime to it, a 100% improvement (but 100% better than crap is still crap). But I was a trooper and finished it, someone bought it for me and I wasnt gonna give them the uppity nose act."
"Drinkability: I inherited a 12-pack of this stuff from the weekend, and I think thats the only way youll find it in my fridge again, because I wont be buying it. Sure, its easy to polish one of these off if its cold enough, but if thats the kind of beer youre going for, theres far better ones out there that dont cost as much. I think this is a terribly overrated beer."
"Arrrg. It smells like sewage. It sounds like a soda pop when you pour it and looks like pee. The taste is pretty bad. I would rather drink the beast. Mouthfeel is of water. Drinkability not the best. I have always wondered people like this and i don't understand it. Wish i could say more but i can't. oh yeah, and it is too expensive. You might as well by some cheap american crap and throw some lime in that. People who give this good reviews say something like ""oh i wouldn't drink it without lime"". WTF? Buy something that isn't mexican sewage ass so you don't have to put lime in it! Put lime in something good and see what happens! Totally unecessary. Solution? Get a good brew."
"Dont believe the hype. Pale straw in colour, fizzy, bittersweet mess. Much better beers than this one."
"The beer pours that peculiar strain which can only be called corn yellow. It develops a bit of white rocky head. The aroma is of corn malt. The taste is pretty much what you'd expect from a Mexican corn based lager. I was sipping it slowly enough that it warmed and I actually preferred the taste. Once closer to room temp the corn taste became more apparent. The feel was light and oily. This is not an upleasant beer, but it doesn't have much that would grab you. It falls between beers that use a little corn like Dos Eques or Carta Blanca, and those which are proudly corn beer like Tecate or Chihuahua. This middle stance puts it far below any of the other Mexican alternatives."
"Pours a two-finger white head that goes quickly and leaves no lace. Yellow color similar to urine. Light carbonation and very light bodied. Slight skunky nose. Starts and finishes very bland, no flavor, qualifies as a poor lawn mower beer. Why did I buy this stuff? I needed the bottle for my collection - now over 1650. $1.60 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA"
"(12 oz. silk screened clear bottle)"
"Drinkable but I would not recommend it."
"What you have is no longer a beer, but instead more of a mixed drink. It tastes better than a Corona though, try it and see for yourself."
"Its amazing that Mexican beers have so much more flavor than American macros. Anyway, decent beer, sort of like sparklingly water mixed with a little corn and a tiny hop punch. Stick a lime in it and I could drink this all day, but without, Ill pass."
"Drinkability - It really is fascinating how beers with only the most subtle differences can be marketed to suggest not only differences in the type of person that enjoys the beer, but also largely non-existent differences in taste. Is it the hint of lime in this beer that conjures a beachfront vacation or is it the ad campaign? Is there even a hint of lime in this beer? In any event, when drinking this beer with my mind engaged, I'd rather not be. And putting a lime in it doesn't make that go away. This may be my least favorite beer - bad for style in a uninspiring style of beers."
"Why is this stuff $25 a case??? I just picked up a case of Augustinerbrau Maximator for $27. Something is wrong here. If you enjoy urine in a bottle, this brew is for you! Why do they put the lime in the bottle you may ask? No, its not a tropical tradition, its to mask the rotten corn odor that eminates from the clear bottle. Yep, clear bottle, brewed with mexican water, coming from Mexico. You do the math. I give it higher marks for drinkability simply because once you mask the horrid odor and add some limes it pretty much tastes like nothing. They say this is the #1 imported beer into the US. This makes me sad."
"Flavor is very mild but some spicy hop mixes with sugary sweetness and some corn husk. The beer finishes with a sweet candy coating on my tongue. Very lite and easy to drink, but mostly due to a lack of any depth in flavor or character. A fairly bland beer."
"A previous reviewer commented on the sexiness of the beer, and I think this is a strong suit though not a typical rating factor here on BA. With the heat of the dance floor, the fizziness of the setzery beer, and the tartness of the lime, this bottle was enjoyable and I would rate the drinkability above a five if possible. Goes down easy, begs for more, clearly and cleanly refreshing."
"Even the sleek shape of the bottle suggests you can slam umpteen of these at a time."
"Notes: My 1st review! It's fitting that it should be of a beer that I thought was so ""cool"" in my younger days. I've since tasted beer that makes corona taste like water. And from my experience, those who drink Corona and other lights don't want to taste the beer. Of course, even though the lime ruins the head, it covers up the little flavor the brew has. Definitely a good thing. I've definitely learned that Corona is mostly good marketing. Fortunately, I've only ""borrowed," never paid for it!"
"Pale gold clear liquid. Tiny bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass, but moving very slow. Thick white foamy head. Head retention was ok. Pale skunky aroma, slightly floral. Very pale malt flavor, not much bitterness, maybe a hint of floral hop flavor at the end, but not much standing out. Light body, watery, high carbonation. Not much going on here in terms of flavor or eye candy. Pass."
"Mouthfeel is paper thin with small bubbly carbonation but no backbone at all. This is not a brew I would choose to drink...as there are many better. However, if I can drink it at work...and it's free...why not."
"Probably the first time I've ever poured this into a glass rather than drinking it in the bottle with a slice of lime. Very pale golden hue with a very small, fizzy white head that vanishes almost immediately. Held up the glass, and hey, I can watch TV right through it. Aroma of adjunct malt, astringency, and some skunkiness. Light (but not delicate) taste of cheap adjunct malt and just a whiff of generic hops. Slightly foamy mouthfeel. By almost any measure, pretty bad, but you know what? I can drink this all day, especially in Vegas or at the beach where there are few alternatives."
"Pours a pale straw with a fizzy shortlived head with pathetic lacing. The aroma is of corn and malt with no hops. The taste is of sweetish plasticy malts with some DMS. The finish is watery with a matallic zing. The mouthfeel is thin. This is one bland, watery beer. Its not even worth trying. What a waste of time."
"Drinkability actually relatively high (compared to other scores). This muust be my fond"
"All in all, nothing terrific, but a nice beer to relax with every so often during the summer."
"Overall-I won't slam Corona without explanation as many others do, but I must admit that I am shocked many uninformed people consider this a top-quality beer, the sour mouthfeel could make you gag, the lack of any head ruins its fine color, and it isn't at all refreshing if not drank ice cold. In my book this is a sub-standard beer overall, not at all worth the price tag. Any beer that needs an outside influence (a lime in this case) to taste good should immediately be considered a tasting hazard."
"Surprisingly, this beer pours a decent-sized head.. I wasn't expecting that, since if I have to drink this stuff, I drink it straight from the bottle. I don't like to think much about the color of this beer, since it reminds me of urine. The smell is really not very appetizing.. I'm not sure how to describe it, but its not pleasant. This beer really doesn't like much of anything, but it is often fairly skunky. It really tastes MUCH better with a lime in it. As for mouthfeel, it's light-bodied, but leaves a bad aftertaste. It's actually pretty drinkable, unless you prefer beer that actually tastes like something. The main thing I dislike about this beer is how expensive it is, yet its not exactly something of great quality."
"had this beer this summer at a graduation party. from the bottle. poured a golden color with a white head that didn't last1st one no lime little aroma and flavor. 2nd one with lime there is the flavor to bad it was lime. another one to drink ice cold and fast"
"Drinkability: IMO, very low. Get something else. My friend and I did get a few chuckles as we thought of the movie Fast and the Furious where Vin Diesel tells Paul Walker's character ""you can have any beer you want, as long as it's a Corona"". We both agreed if we were in that position, the movie would be over."
"I would never go out and buy a Corona; I am only reviewing it since a six-pack was left in my fridge by a friend. If you must drink one, do so very quicky at the coldest temperature possible, just to move on to something -- anything -- better."
"Perhaps the most successful advertising/marketing scam of all time. Bud never looked so good."
"Consumed in September 2004 from a 12oz bottle. Well, I'm sorry to disappoint everyone, but this beer isn't that bad. But, it only serves one purpose. When you are dying of thirst on a beach, this is a good one to grab. It's not a pretty pour, it doesn't smell like anything special, but it's a decent beer when you want a quick one and there isn't anything else around but bud/miller/coors. At least this one has a bit more taste. Don't understand why it's so expensive though. I always have a 12pk on hand for when I am moving the lawn of doing something outside."
"My only question is will I get scurvy now that I've had a Corona without a lime?"
"as often as you see people ordering this in bars youd think it might be half decent its actually pretty atrocious. no wonder they put the lime in it. everything about this beer is unimpressive yet oddly i wouldnt turn it down if i was offered one. why is this so popular???"
"What can I say that other reviewers haven't already said? Basically, Corona Extra is the Mexican equivalent of Crudweiser, perhaps a bit better, but not much. It has a tendency to go ""skunky"" -- perhaps 'cause it's shipped in those clear bottles that offer no protection against harmful UV rays (or whatever it is that ruins beer). I'll have to concur with the ""Avoid"" rating on this one, although I think that Grupo Modelo's dark beer, Negra Modelo, is quite good. If you're in an establishment that serves Grupo Modelo products, go for the Negra instead!"
"I truly believe that every time someone purchases this product, they are buying status & chic, and the only way you can like this beer, is through systematic desensitisation."
"Put the Corona down and step away from the suckiness."
"These numbers would be lower if no lime were added, 1.5s at the most. However, with a lime (don't drink it without the lime, I'm begging you), it works to quench your thirst with some decent beer taste. The color is unappealing yellow, the head quickly disappears if you pour it, and it tastes a bit like beer. I usually don't want more than one."
"Corona Extra is nothing special but not horrible either. It is a light gold color. Smell is certainly ""adjuncty"" as is the taste, which is rather watery. This is the type of beer which is best enjoyed straight out of the bottle, and only when all other options have proven elusive."
"Yes I really love this beer on a hot summer day. I prefer it with out the lime. There is no other beer I can sit around and drink like water. I know this is a below average beer and many like to slam it due to the fact it's ""cool"" to drink, but in actuallity there isn't another beer that goes down so easily on a hot day. The smell is aweful but the taste isn't poor. I just wish the price reflected the taste because I would drink this all the time. I only drink this now if someone offers me one, or if we are getting tanked on the golf course durring May 5th."
"Well its been just a month shy of 4 years since Ive had a Corona, and now I remember why. The beer sleazes from the 12-ounce clear bottle a limpid light gold color with the head small and white, frothy in texture and the lace thin. Nose is dominated by the malt, sweet as is the start, top is ultra thin. Finish is mildly acidic, the hops sparse and the aftertaste dry. The reason even after 4 years was the fact I was helping someone move, and the only beer he had was a six pack of Corona, must admit, it did fend off the heat stroke I was getting from moving several million tones of stuff up a flight and half of stairs in 112 degree heat."
"This is a beer that if offered free, I would drink but if I have to pay, now way! It pours straw yellow with a slight head that fades very quickly. The nose is of grain and a little malt. The flavor is quite unobtrusive with a slight malt background and a crisp bite, but nothing exciting whatsoever. A drinkable beer that could definantly use a lime to help out with the flavor."
"Obviously, Corona is not the best beer in the world, or even close to it. But I don't quite understand all the Corona-bashing from reviewers. Just because something is popular doesn't mean it isn't actually decent."
"Satisfactory if cold on a hot day. Some foam otherwise yellow nothing special, malt,corn sweetener, carbonation whallop on the aggressive side. Just mediocre. Ok with food like veggies or spicy Mexican. Somewhat astringent aftertaste. Slightly better than most other macros."
"Pale yellow with a large white head. I get the normal marco lager smell which is usually not offensive. This is. The tastelessness is accompanied by an off flavor. More, or different, adjuncts than I'm used to? This odd flavor takes away from the drinkability."
"Bought a 24 ounce bottle for 2.50...Pours a fizzy light yellow...very little head...nose is skunky..body is actually a little fuller than I expected...highly carbonated mouthfeel...a little skunkiness on the taste but not bad in that regard...some cooked vegy notes on the tastes....corny sweetness...nothing real appealing to this but it's not the worst beer I've ever had....I'll never pay premium $$ for this but I could see a few of these sliding down ok on the beach...errrr...for 9 bucks a case or something...a below average but not horrible beer that is tremendously overpriced and hyped....I like Carta Blanca, Tecate, Dos Equis and a few others better than this but I'd drink it if offered it for free..I wouldn't order it though"
"I was really expecting this to be a horrible beer based on other reviews and the opinions of most on this site. Actually, Extra wasn't too bad for me, just mediocre. The appearance isn't too bad, better than some similiar macros, but still not too impressive. Smell was a little skanky, but not overly bothersome. Taste was fairly smooth, not complex, but not bad. I wouldn't praise the beer for it's taste, but it compared decently to american macros. The most positive thing I have to say about Extra is that it is easy to drink and that I could easily session it. Overall, Corona Extra is mediocre, I think it would work good as a thirst quencher type beer. Also, a lime spruced up the flavor a little bit."
"Extra horrible! Granted this was given to me at a picnic, I don't know if I could do worse next time. Poured out a piss yellow with some carbonation visible. Smell was not there. There was nothing to smell at. Taste was nada as well. Was that a hop bite? Perhaps not, must of been the water that they use. Heck, people say on a hot summer day this could do well sometimes. No way, give me a cold bottle of water instead. This is as low as it gets folks. Avoid this by all costs. I'll grab a soda next time instead of this stuff."
"I know that I'm supposed to hate this beer, but being in the wasteland of beer at the Jersey shore left me little choice but to try a few. I can stand this beer. It is not impressive appearing, the aroma is almost non-existent, the taste is just passable, but it is refreshing. Since the beer's not that great, I push the lime into it and it is like a limeade. I wouldn't make a steady diet of this, but it is okay on a hot summer day, especially when the alternative is Bud and Bud Lite."
"One of the few beers where the light version is actually better than the regular because the taste is even less. Every time I drink this stuff I swear it will be the last time. To say it is bad is an understatement. this beer tastes like watered down urine. With no disrespect to Mexico, they say don't drink the water there, this beer is brewed there, do you think they import bottled water to brew? the alcohol content is the only think keeping people from dying from food poisoning."
"Considering the price, its probably good that frat boys are using their parents money to buy this stuff, as otherwise it would not sell."
"I ended up at a cookout this evening, and there was nothing available to drink other than four kinds of macro-swill, Corona being one of the imported varieties (along with Kronenbourg 1664). The domestic swills included Budweiser and Yuengling Light. Instead of leaving and embarrasing my family, I took this as an opportunity to try beers I had not had in over two years. I wish I had just left. The Corona poured a distinctly mellow yellow. That was the best of it. The smell and taste were weak--the most distinctive part of it was the bubbles (there were no hops that I could detect). Not worth the time and effort. I poured most of it out."
"Well, I must say that this brew is not very tasty, never has been. Have experienced it with and with out lime and unfortunately I must say that the lime does help it out a bit. The brew pours to a very pale yellow color with a white head that is very bubbly and has no real retention or lacing. The aroma is pretty boring and heading on nasty without the lime. Somewhat skunky smells seem to dominate, others going on as well but not overly that pleasant. The taste is of corn and a sweetness that overall is not that great along with a little hop. Not a very good beer by it self. Now with me bad mouthing is so much I must say that I do not mind it when I have a lime wedge or two in the bottle and it is about 90+ out. Had a few while down in Progreso Mexico on the beach and I am not sure if it was the sun, ocean, relaxing or a combination of all but I actually enjoyed it. Now I would be very hard pressed to have the same experience here in NY!"
"Light yellow and clear. Bottle clear with engraved label, Mexican symbols and stuff. Corn in the nose, medium bubble head, which fades quickly. Minimal flavor, no hops noticable. We all have tried and probably had our thirsts quenched by this stuff. Its better then Bud/Miller/Fosters etc. Crisp and refreshing. good on the beach or on a very warm day."
"It is a bit more golden than many macros, but it is thin, sourish, and gives little hint that it's based on barley (hah!) and hops. However, it's not as ""corny"" as some other macros (which would probably benefit it). Anyway, I didn't even finish my bottle of this, choosing a ginger ale instead! I don't care where, under what situation, how cold, or how cheap this is: not worth your time or effort to even drink!"
"Drinkability? Only if you're looking to improve the appearance of your blind date. After 5 of them, you may not notice anymore (either the flavor or your date's ugliness)."
"Clear gold color. Tiny white head. Olores del maíz y de la mofeta (Smells of corn and skunk). I drank it from a mug. No fruit. A light malty flavor which is overshadowed by the large amounts of skunk. This was packaged in a ""Beers of Summer"" sampler, between an Oberon and a Curve Ball. A very overrated beer with pretty much no conceivable positives I can think of."
"Let me go on the record as saying that my preference in beer is HIGHLY influenced by context. I love Chimay and other Belgian dark beers, BUT if I were on a beach or at the pool, that would be the last beer I would ever consider drinking in that atmosphere. Pairing beer with context is like pairing wine with food. If you have a mismatch (like a light white wine with beef), it is a disaster. That being said, I like Corona on a hot summer day or when I am at the beach. Granted, a lime is necessary (hence the 1.5 smell factor), but this beer tastes like vacation. And it is very drinkable. Limes do prevent scurry, too (ask the pirates). So I am giving this beer a higher rating than many of you have. Viva Summertime!!! Viva Corona!!"
"Drinkable? It is in a flavorless chugable way. I can find 6-7 better beers in Mexico without really trying."
"Like its been stated so many times before. This before should probbaly only be used as a subbstitute for water on hot summer days. It is a light yellow color, and smells skunky. It' taste is watery overall with a very light feel on the tongue and some hints of sourness even with out the lime."
"Corona Extra is awful for a couple of reasons. It is 7 to 8 bucks for a six pack, that is rediculous for a crappy beer. I can't believe this beer does so well. It almost needs two categories with lime and without it. No beer should need a lime to make better, this beer however does. This review is based on no lime. Corona pours a light yellow with no head, little lacing, the aroma is a little skunky and the taste is watery and flat, hints of sourness as well. Feels flat and dull and light in the mouth. The drinkability is a 2 here because on a hot day with lime you can pound these. With a lime the drink may be a 3. Only time you should be drinking this, on a hot beach in mexico, even then casta would be better."
"I never put anything in my beer such as fruit or fruit juice, but might make an exception if Corona Extra was the only thing available. Equal parts beer and lime juice might make it palatable. Or not."
"An ok bar drink,inoffensive, however, when there are many substitutes from europe which beat it hands down it doesnt stand a chance"
"I expected more from this beer, since some of my friends said it was good, but now it's my list of those to avoid. The head comes and goes very quickly, and the smell is that of a skunk that reminds me of driving on the highway. The taste was skunky and watery as well. I tried it with a lime and found it bearable after I had already had a significant amount to drink, and the beer simply tasted watery at that point."
"The finish was slightly dry with no sweetness. Over all a meek, watery beer to quench one's thirst."
"Another nostalgic beer that survives on an exotic image."
"F"
"There really isnt much to say about this beer. The color is yellow with no head or lacing. The smell is not very strong couldnt really detect hops maybe a little malt smell to it. The taste was very plain as well with no mouthfeel, was like drinking water. On the drinkability aspect it was quite easy to drink since it is like water."
"There are so many better, but many worse too."
"whilst out gambling at the suncoast today the cocktail waitress brought me one of these bad boys. pale yellow with a lime shoved down the neck. smells a lil funky and basically like a lame beer. taste? whats up corn flakes! watered down, corny, but yet i found it drinkable. thin in the mouth, maybe it was the fact i was losing at blackjack and it made me feel better but this wasnt the ""worst"" beer ive ever had."
"OK, look, you can truly drink a whole lot of these, especially on a damned hot day with a wedge of lime floating in the ice cold bottle. And I guess on some level there are days I might actually enjoy the feeling of sucking down a citrus flavored alcoholic beverage labeled as beer. But man, I just can't be as gracious as to give this beer anything more than it deserves, which is a rating of sub-mediocre, because where I come from, flavor actually counts for something, and I'm not talking about the slug of fruit I'm jamming down the neck of the bottle!"
"Pours a clear greenish yello under a thin white head with no retention to speak of and no body. The nose reminds me of sour cabbage. The mouth is very light and prickly. The taste is hard to figure, because the carbonation dominates everything. There really isn't much up front. Not even corn. The finish has a surprisingly good, crisp hoppy bite, but mild is the operative word here. There is basically no aftertaste. I've had a lot of more vile Soviet beers, but ultimately this brew deserves its bad rep."
"redeeming qualities were the appearance and mouthful, both more substantial than expected. But when it comes right down to it, If beer looks good but does not taste good, well, then hang it on the wall and call it art. But do not expect me to allow it into my body. Never again."
"doesnt leave much of an impression, as it is just another average pale lager."
"On a positive note: the bottle was not skunked, as I've been warned about."
"Bottle - This one needs to be drink on the beach during hot summer days with lime. I see no other purpose or reason to drink this. Also, ensure it is fresh because the skunky taste will overpower everything else about this beer. I guess this might be a result of using a clear bottle."
"Well, served at a bar so it may have been kept in a carton and not light-struck, since it's not as sucky as I'd expect. It is just a little bit maltier than most American megabrews. So I'll at least rate it a little above the average swill. As you might guess, the was the most exotic import the bar had."
"Pale yellow, with quickly vanishing head, this had no aroma. Flavor was thin, light, and watery. I believe this beer wanted to be skunked, but lacked enough hops to really do so. In its defense, there were no off flavors...but there were no on flavors either. Slightly sweet malt, a metallic twang in the finish, and mucho water. Thank god I didn't pay for this; there's no way it should cost more than the most humble Stroh's or Genny."
"The beer pours a very pale yellow color with a spotty lace head. The smell is weak, but pleasant. There is a faint odor of pale malts. The taste is watery and ordinary. It has that Mexican beer taste to it. I'm not exactly sure how that's acheived. It is a low bodied beer that is easy to drink, just not too enjoyable. As far as commercial imports are concerned; this is one of the better ones."
"it's hard to beleive that,for a while, this was my favorite beer (when I first moved to Florida). It is clearly all image. I poured it into a glass (my first mistake). Very weak appearance. Grainy, corn-like aroma. Taste-wise, nothing. Not bad, just nothing. Refreshing? Maybe, if on the beach (with a lime!?). Otherwise, worse than the ""big three"". No redeeming qualities at all."
"This beer must be evaluated for what it sets out to be...a refreshing hot weather thirst quencher. That said let's start with the aroma, corny yes, skunky no. This smell I find to be one of the charming things about this beer and I NEVER drink it with a lime! The carbonation level is appropriate for a easy drinking lager and drinkability is this beers' strongest point, smooth mouthfeel. I believe that some of the ""unique"" aromas and flavors that emanate from this brew are due to adjuncts, namely corn. But I have always found them pleasant and what gives Corona it's appeal. I've been drinking it it for about 30 years, way before the yuppies discovered it and started shoving limes down it's throat. My advice, don't be bullied by the ale snobs into calling every yellow beer ""flavorless"". Enjoy sublety and loosen up a little."
"Overall this is one of the worst beers in creation. If this was the bottle version I would have given it an even worse review."
"- Correction of beer name: In October 2003, I incorrectly reviewed ""Corona Light"" as ""Corona Extra"". I have since tried Corona Extra, transplanted the previous review to its proper place, and edited this review to cover the correct beer. -"
"Overall: I don't know which is worse, that this is actually considered ""good beer"" by the majority in his country, or that there is actually a Corona LIGHT?!?!? It is a fun summer beer but nothing to speak of cotnained within."
"If you have to put a lime in it to taste good, it has to be bad. I had two of these. One with a lime and one without. First thing is first. Beer should never come in a clear bottle. Someone should tell the fine folks at Corona this. The color of the beer was kind if a neon yellow with no head. Off to a bad start. The smell was that of rice and bad skunk which is what I also got from the taste. I put in a couple lime wedges and they did little to mask the flavor. Ok, it did look cool when the lime was dropped in. it fizzed. I'm sorry, Mexico, your #1 beer failed."
"Poured light yellow with little head retention, ricey small hoppy aroma, very little hoppy taste, just a thirst quencher , seems to go OK when your in a Mexican establishment and your trying to cleanse your mouth for a new taste.Really not worthy of sipping by itself"
"Elsewhere I have stated that many Mexican beers have the same problem that I can describe in two words: SKUNK-Y! Sulfurous fumes emanate from the bottle upon opening. Ye gods! Open a window. IF you can somehow get past the initial ‘bouquet’ the beer isn’t too bad. I prefer Carta Blanca, or Dos Equis or Sol. The only time I would venture here is on a very hot day: I wouldn’t kick it out of the fridge. The mouthfeel is watery and undercarbonated. The finish is a rather poor attempt at sweetness. Unimpressive aftertaste: try a different beer."
"I have had a number of these beers in my less informed days. Yet I have never had one in a glass. I have had them in the bottle with a lime and even in a can with a lime. It is a light golden color with little aroma. Its nothing really special tasting either like most mass produced beers. But Im here to say that given the right situation this is a beer that I could drink. Going out to a Mexican restaurant to eat you almost have to have a corona. Or on the beach a corona is not a bad choice but other then a few situations I would suggest to pass. Must have a lime to drink it. Do not attempt it with out the lime."
"Was at a friends party and his wife chose a fiesta theme. Guess what beer they had. Corona or Corona Light. It had been a while so i figured before i left to buy the host some decent beer id give it a go. Well one can clearly see the colour is a very pale yellow . Aromas were chemical, and astringent. Mouthfeel was brutal due to the carbonation and over all taste. The taste was not that of beer, but of a sweetish water with a metallic bitter aftertaste. I tried this with out the lime, but the lime might help a litte to give it some sort of flavour. Drinkability is low.. I would have to be very drunk to drink one of these again."
"Drinkability: I hate this category. It implies this beer's drinkable. It isn't. Screw the lime, this stuff sucks. Finishing the pint I bought is going to be a chore."
"This beer comes in a clear bottle (wouldn't that cause it to become skunky if exposed to sunlight?). It is a simple yellow beer with little head and no lacing. The aroma is nothing special - smells like any other mass produced beer on the market. The taste is acceptable with a lemon slice in it - slightly better than most other middle-American beers I've had, but still not anywhere near the top of my list."
"Comments  Not much positive to write about on this one. Sorry, but it just wasnt very good. I saw that some Karma Midgets fived it, but only three mugged BAs gave it a three or higher. This one is not on my Christmas list."
"I guess it's pretty much adios now, Corona. I'll stick to beer."
"A friend of mine recently had a birthday party and free Corona's were offered. So I decided to have one without the lime, none were offered. Everyone knows how not good it is so I won't waste our time by repeating it. Let's focus on the positives: It isn't Corona Light, um, that's it."
"Well, it's better than Coors or Buttwiper, that's the only positive. It has no aroma, nor flavor. In fact, you have to put the lime in to make it drinkable."
"Oh Christ, why did they offer me this? Corona. Comes in clear bottles, so you can see the light colour of the brew and possibly get that skunked smell and taste. Pours a very pale, pale yellow and gold colour that you can see through like a pair of contact lenses. No head whatsoever. Add a little salt, you barely get a bubble. Smelled skunky. Every Corona I've had, which isn't very many, had this skunked smell. It is so overpowering that any malt or hop scent is undetectable. Sour tasting. Add a lime, and it's barely tolerable. Mostly because you can taste the lime. The aftertaste is a sour/bitter combination. Perhaps some evidence of hops? Sorry, not enough. Thin, light, watery mouthfeel. I wouldn't want to drink this at all. One of the biggest overhyped and worst beers one can get."
"Light Gold color, small head. Light tasting lager style beer. Light bodied and moderately hoppy. Very carbonated. Mouthfeel is a little light, a little yeasty. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Trendy Swill Best ICE COLD on a HOT DAY.I always have a fit when I see this beer for $7 or $8 buck a six pack in some places. I remember when I could by this stuff for 25 cents a sixer in Baja."
"Notes: We all know this beer's worthless and overhyped; ripping it would be a waste of my time."
"the best choice i had out of a fridge full of bad brews. is this exact same brew as corona light, just in a slightly different bottle? methinks so. looks the same, smells the same, tastes the same. looks like piss, tastes like water. no characteristics whatsoever. add a lime and create lime water, should you desire...i certainly didn't. i hate when people drink this stuff and think they're enjoying a quality brew. that is all."
"I drink this beer for the image alone, and think you should to"
"Mass produced from Mexico.. light yellow color with little flavor if any it's on the bitter end.. flat low carboantion with no lasting Belgian lace.. is not very drinkable either with lime or without it. Mouthfeel is light and no body with not much substance. Smell is weak and non impressive."
"This brew poured a medium head of small to large sized white bubbles that left very little lacing. It has a wheat yellow body with a mild if any aroma. It has an initial bite that lingers slightly into the aftertaste. It has a mild hoppy malt flavor."
"This review covers Corona with the requisite lime and salt. It pours a rather plain yellow, and the smell is quite average as well. The taste, a pleasent bitter and salty combination which occurs for obvious reasons, is fantastic. However, the mouthfeel is not as satisfying. Not a bad beer in all, but there exist better."
"While my wife will strongly disagree with this review (why almost all chicks love this swill is beyond comprehension), I have to be honest and say this is one of the world's worst beers. I guess if your idea of beer is a brew almost devoid of taste, and what taste there is reminds you of cardboard or rotting wood smell, a nasty metallic bitter aftertaste, watery as hell body, and even paler looking in color, then go buy yourself a case of this swill, er, 'beer'. Good luck to you."
"Rating - Listen to the warning bells going off in your head whenever someone tries to squeeze a lemon or lime wedge into your bottle. - It's either flavorless or disgusting. This pale yellow swill with the fast fading white head lager holds a light pasty malt, almost flavorless light hops and a sweet wet corncob aroma and taste. This beer is not disgusting with the lime added, it is however, a poor excuse for a beer."
"Odd how so many fall for marketing over substance."
"Tonight is my 'light' night at the Flying Saucer. After a Coors Light, I had a Corona Extra. It poured a clear yellow but was relatively flat. No head. It had no aroma which could be good since it was not skunked in that clear bottle. The flavor was equally bland. The mouthfeel was similar to water. One of the folks at the table said that Corona makes a great pool beer. Well I was not at the pool so I found it less than desirable. It was not horrible but not even good."
"All of us have been at a swanky party or Mexican restaurant that have pushed us to try a Corona with a lime, lemon or shot of tequila. While I can't speak for everyone this is one beer that I wish that I had not tasted. First off, it is beer in a clear bottle. Which leads to the beer becoming a skunk beer the day it was bottled. When the beer is opened the aroma is strong and smells like wet paper towels that have been sitting in the sun. Taste was lackluster and I have found, like most malt liquors, it was drinkable albeit when it was very very cold. If someone offers you a bottle of this brew run away and throw the lemon or lime at them and grab the shot of tequila."
"Now, I understand that this board is full of people that strongly believe you have to be able to cut your beer with a knofe. Corona isn't a bad beer. Especially for one day a year. (5/5) I would consider it the best of the shit beers, and I wouldn't be ashamed to have it in my fridge. Of course, right now I have a Bent Tree and a Tripel, but hey, it COULD happen!"
"(I wish there were negative points available. One star seems too charitable.)"
"There's something about Corona that makes me feel dirty when I drink it. Don't ask, but it's enough to prevent my from buying it under my own free will."
"Not exactly the biggest fan of Corona. I have to admit, I like drinking it in the summer time outside, maybe when at a Jimmy Buffett concert or something like that. Otherwise, I generally don't drinkt his stuff unless there is absolutely nothing else around . Not recommended."
"The addition of lime masks almost all the foul and not so foul qualities of this beer and in turn make it taste like an alcoholic lime-flavored seltzer water. Can be drinkable on a hot day, especially with the lime. I would still recommend this over some really foul American beers that I've had, but in general I would advise beer drinkers to steer clear."
"Remember, the lime was originally used so that the citric acid would disinfect the top! I may love Jimmy Buffet, but I still don't want to drink this stuff."
"This beer poured a medium head that left a good lacing on the sides of my mug. There was some carbonation to this beer. It had a smooth taste to it. I did not notice any bitterness or any aftertaste with this beer. There was nothing outstanding about this beer as I did not feel that it had any character to it. I definitely will not be drinking this beer again. I am glad I have this rating out of the way."
"a trademark Mexican beer with not much to be proud about. It pours, yet again, your average golden tone, even clearer which would make me guess it was rather watery. especially after the mild foam head faded quickly. and guess what? i was right. this beer has no smell and no taste at all. it is the worst of the light beers. You can throw in a lemon to give it some taste, but you can also do that for a more cheaper edition of ""water"" and have some lemonade. A beer that actually needs help on the taste."
"The color is your typical horse-whiz yellow that we are all familiar with. The head is white, and disappears faster than it took me to type this sentence. The smell is nothing to write home about. If you add lime to it, it becomes the predominant aroma instantly. The taste is not spectacular - full of adjuncts, very grainy in nature (unless you've added enough lime to kill the taste). Mouthfeel is fizzy, but that's about it. Sure, you COULD drink this all day long, but why would you want to?"
"Pours a light yellow. There was a head but quickly faded with zero lace. Aroma was not much. A hint of malt and may be some hops. The taste is very light. Not much of a beer flavor to it. It is a bit watered down if flavor. Sure you can drink this stuff all day long but is it worth it? Is this the yellow fizzy stuff they talk about on the bottle of Arrogant Bastard Ale?"
"Good summertime drink that's all. It has to be ice cold and with a lime wedge to give it some flavor. It is gold in color and clear, little or no head. Some carbonation and easily drinkable. The only time you'll see this in my hand is on a hot summer day or while in Mexico during spring break."
"Sampled in the bottle, classic style with a thin lime wedge, the Corona signature. Initially surprised at how clear in color this beverage is. Smell without the lime is very skunky, with the lime a little citrus and some skunk aroma. This beer has tons of carbonation, and the taste is a tad of corn, finishing a bit watery, a very one-sided beer, for the price in most markets I've been in, this goes for 6-7 dollars a sixer - anyone can do much better. The only plus, is these are awfully smooth, and just a touch drinkable on a hot, hot day."
"Light yellow pour with very little lasting white head. This is a very watery beer that presents little to like or dislike. The sense is of light carbonation with very little smell or taste. Some light citrus sense. A lightweight beer that seems overly popular for what it is which below average in every category. Why waste time with this?"
"I've had it both Mexico and US and it makes little difference...it's bad! The fact that it's over priced adds to the poor impression. Best thing I ever did with the brew was a small blind taste test with a couple of friends ( with notoriously long neck swilling taste ) and it was soundly beated by all of the usual mass produced lites. Only positive note is the lemon that adds some vitamins, otherwise it's a waste of calories. If you look at the Pilsner standards, the color isn't bad but under achieves on aroma, mouth and finish."
"Not a very impressive beer. Standard amber color, with a flat taste not much better than American mass-produced lagers. But, it is acceptable at the shore on a hot day, with a lime for extra flavor. It goes down fairly easy. You can do much better for the price."
"Drinkability: OK in a pinch. I give it an extra half point because I realize this beer is drinkable ice-cold on a hot day."
"Here in Minnesota, Corona seems like an exotic import beer. I still cannot believe a brewer would have the guts to package beer in clear bottles! Maybe that's why I wasn't impressed. Pours with little fanfare, what head exists is very dry and gone quickly. Smell is of rotten veggies/fruit. Taste is, well, bad. Sickly sweet corn abounds. No hop bitterness. The beer was skunky (clear bottles). I really wanted to give this one a fair shake. I do not recommend this. A Hamm's or Schlitz beer is cheaper and better, and that's not saying a lot."
"Well, I was once told that this beer had it's particular time and place. I am guessing that this person is referring to being in Mexico, or on any beach partying. However, while in Ensenada this summer this beer was no where to be seen. You had to specially ask for this beer, and it wasn't on billboards or the television commercials. No the marketing is for those Americans just show them the picture with the lime wedged in the bottle, then we'll see some response from them. Yep, that is basically what happened this beer became popularized with commercials not with a good taste. So, as I pour this beer in WV during early January, I almost know it is a mistake. However, I am giving it a shot. When i poured this golden (as in color of piss) it fizzled like a can of soda, and the head was gone by the time I looked at the screen and back down to my pint glass. At first scent it seems very unpleasant, but when I taste it, this beer contains relatively no flavors. It does have a mild citrusy sweetness, but there is really nothing here. For being so big with the average beer drinker, I wasn't expecting much here. This beer is not one that I plan to drink ever again."
"There is a time and place for this beer and this is not one of them. No taste what so ever comes through for me. Corn and maybe rice are what I taste and smell. Nothing to spectacular and nothing that I would strive for. Good, but not that good. I think that there are some better Mexican beers out there. Hopefully I will find one some day."
"Urine yellow in color. Head disappears in no time. This one has a slight skunky smell that I can't get past. Not much flavor to speak of, maybe that's what the lime is for. It does quench your thirst on a hot day, but it doesn't taste good doing it. They say not to drink the water in Mexico & that's beers #1 ingredient. So just don't drink the Corona."
"This brew was a disappointment...Very light offering in colour, body and taste. The crown is nonexistant and has the mouthfeel of a flat ginger ale. The taste is however fairly well balanced but a little dry...."
"tastes skunky and bitter. it is really light and thin. not much to it except for a lot of carbonation, and a lack of flavor. not to mention that the flavor that is there is just not good at all. i heard that people originally used limes to keep the flies away, and people do it because they think it is a trendy foreign thing to do. whatever the case may be, that little lime is all you will enjoy with this beer"
"it helps!"
"When i tried this beer for the first time i wondered if this was beer or tequilla?? Awfull taste and smell. An important characteristic of the beer is the appearance and i rate it with 1.5/5.... imagine"
"As you can notice, this beer tasted like ""Panther Piss"". One sip and I mean sip and this is the third time in my life that I poured a beer down the drain. How can anyone drink this garbage beer? Luck has it I didn't buy it. I tasted it over at a gathering."
"Overall not a bad taste and texture, but definitely decline if no lime wedge is available. Not impossible to enjoy, texture is ok. Another great choice for the college generation and financially impaired."
"Very yellow in color, and clear. Any head quickly reduced to a ring along the glass. This beer is very carbonated, but I guess there are so few proteins that all the gas just goes away. It smelled like corn sugar and vegetables. It didn't taste too much different. It had a little bit of sweetness, grain, and vegetables and a touch of hops. All of these flavors were bullied around by the intense carbonation, though. Not a particularly good beer. I would much rather have a Negro Modelo or Dos Equis Amber if I had to go for a south of the border lager."
"Sweet, tart, briny maltiness on the nose. Candied apple, aloe, corn husk and mineral flavors predominate. It actually doesn't tasted too f@*%ed with. Its like, they set out to make a cheap beer, and they did it. They didn't try to cover their tracks with chemistry. Decent balance on the finish. What's the water source? I suspect it is a good one."
"Due to the funny looks I get when I start barking out big beers to drink when I visit Vegas, I stick with Corona just to keep things simple when throwing the dice. Anyway, I decided to try this one at home...just to see if it is just a Vegas thing for me. Well, the color is nearly identical going down when it come out and the taste is a bit on the sour side. Not a great beer to sit back and enjoy, but after a frustrating day at work and the unusal sunny skies and hot weather here, this is a decent beer to keep from getting too parched. Don't let this one get anywhere close to getting warm though. Drink it cold and drink it fast."
"Not such a great Beer, Corona Extra has little if any character of an earth shattering Beer. If Modelo would put more money into the Beer instead of the TV ads, every body would be better off."
"Not too many good reviews for this beer (in fact, scathing!), and yet the numbers are OK. Hmmm? Obviously it's not about the beer. Where's it coming from? The painted bottle? Yes. People love it. The image of a ""relaxed, carefree, coastal attitude""? Yes. Trendiness. Yes. Marketing. Yes. The Lime... ... Can we forget about all of the history and just taste the beer? The color is a nice yellow gold with a white head that holds up OK. No lace. There's a distinct, somewhat unique and lightly sweet malty aroma, with maybe a touch of hop lurking in the background. Nothing really off. The body's medium/light with a fine and moderate carbonation level. The flavor is not nearly as sweet as the aroma suggests, but rather, it's accompanied by a dull, earthy bitterness. The finish leaves a lingering bitterness and some light maltiness but no hop flavor. But then again, there are no off-flavors either! Not a real well made beer, but not horrid by any stretch. Now I have something to add to the history... When this beer came on the scene Miller Lite was still big. Dry beers had just passed through town. This offered something more without being hoppy or bitter. Apart from all the marketing... people liked it. Let it go."
"Slightly better than the corona light.  The darker golden color hints at more flavor than the light.  The aroma is bitter, as are most of the mexican beers.  The flavor is bitter also, but at least it exists when compared to the light.  Lime is needed for this beer also, but not bad with mexican food.  However, when eating mexican, my beer of choice is the Dos Equis Amber.  Much more flavor."
"Extra what? I have avoided trying this based on word-of-mouth. I tried someone else's and quickly figured out why it is served with lime. The lime is the only ingredient that gives it any flavor. I wouldn't pay money for this."
"Dont bother with this one, it is not even refreshing."
"A highly underrated summer brew.  Light and refreshing, sans lemon or lime slice.  The aroma is nothing to write home to mother about, and neither is the flavor.  However, the drinkabillity factor is there in the summer time.  Prost!"
"The only way this beer gets even and average taste is using a lime.  Smells terrible and skunky and without the lime I will not drink.  It is a good thirst quencher on a hot day, but so is water.............CHEERS"
"Notes: This is the #1 imported beer in the US though there are numerous others south-of-the-border brews that are worth checking out. As for the lime thing ... you won't see it here. Is it really worth the $20-24 a case? Not to us."
"Aside from being slightly lightstruck, no apparent aroma. Little head, and no distinct malt or hop attribute. Crisp finish and slightly bitter, but also watery."
"Better than Budwieser.   Can swill many of these on a hot summer day.   Watered down hop flavor makes this brew easy to pound.  Definitely a ""chick beer""."
"This is typical of mexican beers. They are meant to cut the dust, and cool you down.  You won't find anyone south of the border drinking a Rogue Shakpespeare Stoudt.  This beer is light in color, taste, and small. Smell is somewhat sour and ricey.  Almost no head when poured.  Can get skunky easlity because of the clear bottle.  Taste is light and watery.  Not bad on a hot day or with tacos. Drinkability is high because it goes down easily.  Alternately try a Negra Modelo."
"For yuppies and girls."
"I feel so dirty admitting this, but I don't mind Corona.  No, I don't drink it all the time, I bet I drink one six of it during the summer.  Its the situation(s) that I will consume of these, i.e. while bbq-ing on a very hot day or after a softball game.  Not much in terms of taste but very drinkable in terms of being able to slap 'em down without thinking.  No, it won't replace a good IPA (or even a poor IPA), but its drinkable.  I'm going back in the closet now..."
"Nice color and head but after that you might as well as stop. The taste is very very bland which imakes this beer good when eating Mexican food. Other than that forget it there are so many better brews out their."
"An excited champange carbonation level, pale straw yellow.  A spicey clover nose, and a sweet clover maltiness on the tongue.  Texture has quite the bite like fizzy soda.  Very straightforward, very simple.  Refreshing."
"really nothing to look at in a glass and no head.  slight skunk and grain (adjunct) aroma.  watery mouthfeel and the weakest hint of hops.  tastes like nothing. i can't believe they make a light version of this.  i do understand why people drink this with a lemon or lime.  it actually improves the beer.  this is worse than any US macroswill."
"No two ways about it:  this is just bad beer.  In our teens, we used to drink it on Mexico road trips because it was about 25 cents a bottle and we didn't know any better.  If I end up at a picnic with all the US macro-lagers and Corona as my only choices in the cooler, I'll pick Bud, Miller, or even Coors over the Corona.  With that said, if you can throw the first one down without barfing, they get a little easier to tolerate.  If you want to drink Mexican beer, almost any other choice is better and no more expensive."
"Although it at times resembles urine, Corona is quite refreshing, provided the lime is in there to mask the taste. There isn't much to the appearance and it goes down like water, which is why I dont mind throwin back a few of these sometimes. Gives me nice memories of my high school days, when I was indifferent to crap beer such as this."
"Looks like ginger ale. No smell and lots of big bubbles.  Zero head and zero retention.  Watery and lacks any real distinct flavors.  Use a lime if there is any around, because it needs something...  Not bad tasting, just boring."
"Just ok. Nothing special, but not undrinkable. In fact it's pretty easy to drink. It's just pretty forgettable, but it is pretty easy to chug."
"See my review for Corona Light. Bigger twitching skunk, bigger corn patch, same damned clown. Somebody at Modelo must be looking at the sales and peeing his pants laughing."
"I try and I try but other than a vague sweetness and carbonation, I can't taste a thing...given the media buzz on this tasteless brew, I'm still waiting for the fuss to die down..."
"Not much taste, but it has its moments on hot summer days, a bit pricey for what you get in the end really."
"Out of the few Mexican beers that I have tasted, I can probably say this is one of worst. Pours a bright clear straw / yellow color with a faint lace. On the nose there isnt much, light cooked veggies. On the palate the flavors of husk, light sweetness, slight bitterness, fairly clean. Just not much going on, still drinkable on a hot day though, but why bother."
"OK, when it's really hot out and you're slaving over the grill cooking up some fajitas, and you're wife gives you one of these -- really cold -- with a wedge of lime to mask the skunkiness, then maybe, just maybe, you drink it. That is, unless there's something better in your fridge."
"Do you believe there's a ""light"" version of this? This is already light, tasteless beer. To call this ""chick beer", as I've heard it referred to as, is an insult to women!"
"Crystal clear pale yellow in color.  Smells and tastes skunky.  Requires a slice of lemon or lime to toloerate.  Not a good beer!  I thought I was cool with it in my high-school days...just a fad thing."
"Sometimes, I must admit that a cold Corona hits the spot on a hot summer day ... or is it the 5 lemon or lime wedges that I pushed into the bottle to mask this lackluster beer? Remove the citrus addition and you've got an adjunct full beer with a very bland character all around. Anything less than ice cold is also undrinkable."
"The hype sells this beer, not the flavor, which it lacks altogether.  Many better Mexican offerings are available, such as Tecate."
