First off, yes, it is better than Corona or Sol. I'd propose that said feat is not difficult to achieve. Secondly, while there is indeed some German lager character present, one has to dig deep to appreciate this feature. A light honey hue with tons of white bubbles, smells vaguely sour and metallic, old wet grain and a skunky vegetal note that for some reason reminds me of cilantro. Perhaps I am smelling some noble hop or noble hop extract. Tastes like fizzy alcoholic water with some faint lemon rind and green apple character ... Actually, the apple isn't all that faint. The skunk spray effect coupled with the fruitiness (presumably acetaldehyde) and a decent dose of cooked corn yield this soapy pungent herbal note that again makes me think cilantro, and by and large this beer remains something I'd drink in Mexico over Tecate or Corona but has previous little else to recommend. The Dos Equis Amber is better without being spectacular, for what's its worth.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 21, 2014"
2.89,5.9,2.75,2.5,3,3.25,3,"There's a whole lot of Mexican American Adjunct Lagers out there and this one actually professes to be the work of a German brewmaster. It holds little German influence but ranks better than most Mexican beers as I was not compelled to throw a lime in it. For the most part the palate is met with a barley grain but hints of rice and a corn sugar sweetness take hold. The feel is very crisp, sugary sweet and a tad thicker than others from south of the border. This is better than some worst than others and right around OK.","KYGunner","Apr 20, 2014"

After spoiling myself with a decade of sampling some of the finest beers in the world today, I didn't expect to care for it nowadays, and I was right. This is just your typical, lousy, run-of-the-mill American adjunct. Piss yellow, almost no head, and an even flatter flavor. This is even worse than Corona. It's basically Rolling Rock with a Mexican themed label. I let my desire for a little nostalgia rob me of $1.49. It won't be happening again.","HarlequinBuckeye","Dec 10, 2013"

In comparison to Budweiser or Coors, I like it quite a bit more, as it doesn't have that extremely skunky corn aroma or flavor. Quite carbonated and lacking flavor (that DAMN metallic taste...), but still a decent choice if you want to get a buzz.","Alextricity","Feb 24, 2013"

It clearly tastes like an adjunct lager, but it's not as carbonated as Bud and the like to at least improve the feel. I would prefer a Bud, because while the flavor isn't as strong, it goes down easier. Realistically, I wouldn't want either, but for those rare times I want cheap beer, I'm not getting XX.","TheRealBigC","Sep 02, 2012"

Can't say much for the smell because...Well why in the hell would you be smelling a beer and not drinking it?. But this stuff is almost like a smoother, Slightly better tasting Labatt Blue.

Light in body, this macro mexican brewed version of a american lager is thin, with the flavor of cooked corn, malted grain and some small amount of hop finish. Better then some Mexican brewed American beers i.e. Corona....but still a sub par, low quality brew. Prost!","GossageBrewery","Mar 07, 2012"

The beer pours a golden straw color with a nice 2 finger white head that has some retention and lacing but not much. The nose is strong in grassy tones but not a lot else to report. The taste is light and crisp that starts off with a sweetness I likened to corn with hints of barely and a mild bitterness. Finishes with a hint of grass and cereal grain. Light bodied and decently carbonated. Overall, I remember loving this beer...in high school. My tastes have changed. I wouldn't refuse another though my any means.","hopfacebrew","Feb 05, 2012"

Malt flavors with a slight hint of lemon or lime, a little sweetness, and a buttery taste in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thin.

It's a tad bit starchy. The dryness is notable. It's definitely not overly sweet like many adjunct lagers, but the taste is disagreeable. I'm not buying this again.

Mouthfeel is light and watery, moderate carbonation, with a very dry aftertaste, its almost as if all the saliva and moisture from the mouth has vanished after a sip of this swill.

This was awesome in those conditions. In a more contemplative, relaxed setting this beer is just another adjunct beer from Mexico. It's refreshing, very light, clear as crystal, yellowy pale, no head, not much lacing. What did you expect. The nose is cooked veggies with the musty cardboard lagery smell that is common with the style. There is a slight maltiness in there too and maybe a slight earthy note as well. The taste is very bland, eminently drinkable, light, light, light. There is very little taste beyond some cooked veggie, some light malts, some adjunct sweetener. There is very little mouthfeel and almost no aftertaste, save for a touch of grassiness. If you're looking for taste, forget it.

Flavor starts with a corn syrup sweetness - almost like sweet corn in liquid form - drying up and maintaining a clean profile through mid-palate and then finishes with slight bitterness and mild grainy finish. Feel starts off a bit heavy on the tongue and then crisps up as high carbonation exploded in the mouth into a light body - very prickly.

I actually don't find Dos XX lager too bad to drink, they also offer the Dos XX in the brown bottle but I have always preferred the lager. I usually drink it from the bottle since I am never offered a glass. For the first time last night they gave me a glass with the beer so I poured it. It does pour extremely light, almost looks like cream soda. What minuscule head existed after my pour quickly dissipated.

The only real real disappointment in this beer was the smell. Perhaps it's allergy season kicking in, but I had real trouble drawing any distinct aroma from either the brew or the empty bottle (usually the bottle will provide aroma even when the beer hasn't). Appearance seemed like the ho-hum average for crystaline lagers. Mouthfeel and drinkability also weren't worthy of top marks, in my book, but they did make the beer more appealing than the lack of smell might suggest. Starts a gentle, almost sweet flavor and settles onto the tongue with a light-bodied yet complex palatte hop, wheat, and oat undertones. Finishes as it begins, and I was glad to find out that it left without the least hint of bitter or sour afterthoughts. No part of this beer stays on the tongue after the brew has been consumed.

2.85,4.4,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"Drinkability/notes: One of the better macro brews from Mexico, one could do far worse. Dos XX goes well with Mexican food, and it can be found any Mexican restaurant in Texas thats worth its salt. Very refreshing in hot summer weather.","Pegasus","May 13, 2003"
2.98,9.2,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Pours a decent enough golden color that is clear with a thin short lived head. The Nose is very sweet malt and mid level hops that are crisp. The flavor is also quite sweet with a mild hop bitterness that adds more of a spicey falvor than a hoppy one. The mouthfeel is decent and soft - not heavy carbonation. The finish is fair as well with a sweet and bitter blend in the aftertaste.","AtrumAnimus","May 03, 2003"
3.65,33.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This was the only beer out my Mexican sampling that had any hop presence, even though here it is still weak. Color is golden pale yellow, trying hard to be dark. Head was white just hovering over 1/4 inch high, some bubble lace. Smells faintly of sweet spiced malt and just a hint of hop. Taste is more of the same, with just a bit more boldness and sharpness in the flavor department. Mostly sweet malt thats got a slight spice to it and has slight noticeable hop nearing the back. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, crisp and clean, a bit sharper then the others. Easy drinker and bit more to it then just water.","tavernjef","Apr 08, 2003"
3.1,13.6,3,3,3,3,3.5,"Like its darker stablemate Amber Lager, this a good beer, if not a top beer. For lagers it is on target and is relatively true to the pale lager style. The mid yellow coloring is good if not strong, but the head is thin and quickly gone. Very little lacing. A grain sense in both the smell and taste. This is not a disappointing brew, but it offers only a limited set of reasons to choose it over others. A good beer where better choices cannot be found.","AtLagerHeads","Mar 22, 2003"
2.2,-19.4,2,2,2,2,3,"A decent beer, taste better than corona. Pours a gold color with little or no head. This like corona is good on a hot mexican summer day. I've had this both here and in Mexico and it did taste better in Mexico but one thing either here or there its watery. There is very little carbonation goes down just like water. Amber is better more flavor.","Running4beer","Mar 21, 2003"
2.6,-4.8,2,2,2.5,4,3,"Drinkability & Notes: For what it is worth this is better than Corona, other than that I’ll pass on this one next time it comes around.","Jason","Feb 15, 2003"
3.59,31.5,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"The Mexican Restaurant I usually go to had this beer on tap and I had never tried it on tap before. The beer poured clear and had a good head which lasted for quite awhile. The aroma was not much. No malt nor hops. The flavor was quite subdued. Its coldness and refreshing quality made a good companion for a great tamale dinner. For a dinner drink it is great. It would make a great summer cooler.","LarryKemp","Jan 17, 2003"
2.8,2.6,2.5,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Not as good as the amber, but still worth a try. Had kind of a malty taste, but not too malty. I like the logo, pretty original. Not as cool as Sol logo, but still cool. Finished smooth, a little watery, but not too bad. I like it with Mexican food or on a hot summer day.","JISurfer","Jan 08, 2003"
2.95,8.1,3,3,3,2.5,3,"Clearish straw color with a better head than some and lacks adjunct qualities. A bit of skunk smell, some sense of a weak hay. Malt is decent, some estery sense and elements of subdued nutiness. Mouthfeel is light and attenuates into a dryishness late. Some senses of raw grain and corn syrup. This brew is fairly mediocre overall, but has more malt goodness than many others from south of the border.","ADR","Jan 02, 2003"
3.84,40.7,3,4,3.5,3,5,"A rarity in that its a lager with some character. Nothing amazing, but the clearly the best mexican pils. It has a decent amber color and medium and lively body. Basic but attractive malt aroma and lovely balanced acidity.","Naerhu","Dec 31, 2002"
3.1,13.6,3,3,3,3,3.5,"The pour a limpid golden straw color, the head masterful and bright white, the lace in fine sheets to coat the glass. Malt makes up the nose with a nice lightly sweet front, and the top skinny, finish is perkily acidic, the hops adequate and the aftertaste dry.","Gusler","Dec 18, 2002"
3.75,37.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear light golden color with a foamy white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma and flavor are a nice balance of sweet malts and bitter hops. Very crisp and refreshing in the mouth. This is one of those beers that a big plate of spicy Tex-Mex cries out for.","Morris729","Dec 02, 2002"
4,46.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Screw Corona, this is the Mexican Beer. Good amber color, light head, light yet a good body. The only beer to drink with Mexican food. Very thirst quenching, so you can eat as many peppers as you like!","bewareOFpenguin","Nov 08, 2002"
3.05,11.7,3,3,3,3.5,3,"Good head, doesn't linger but there is a head.  Nice rich copper color.  I can't exactly spot the aroma but there are hints of bannana and other tropical things. Semi-sweet flavor, but does not reflect exactly the aroma.  Makes the mind think that you are in Mexico.   Good finish, but must have a lime to balance it out.","Jarod","Nov 01, 2002"
2.27,-16.8,4,2,2,2.5,2.5,"Nice fine head. Good rich color. Smells like green bananas, toasted corn flour and corn syrup. A little exotic in a way, but over sweet by far. The flavors are much more dilute than the aromas suggest with repetition of the toasted corn theme. Dry and lightning quick finish, leaving a parched, grainy bitterness. One to avoid.","putnam","Oct 03, 2002"
2.57,-5.9,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"I remember a college buddy raving about this beer.  I don't think I'd had it in about 8 or 9 years when I bought this six pack.  In conclusion, it's nothing worth raving about, but it's not terrible either.  On the whole, Dos Equis is better than the typical macro.  Medium-dark straw color with negligible head.    Cereal grains, grassiness, and a little DMS are some minor distracting flaws.  Nice, clean hop finish.  Has a little more character than I expected.","Suds","Sep 15, 2002"
2.94,7.7,2,3,3,3,3,"just your average lager with a different twist.  a cross breed between euro lager and american adjunct.  not really bad but not really exciting enough to wax poetic.  the graininess in the taste and aroma may turn people off, but with some spicy hot mexican food ...who's gonna know the difference?   actually it's pretty bold for a lager and should be drank with food that is just as bold.","budgood1","Jul 12, 2002"
2.32,-15,2.5,3,2,2.5,2,"No where near as good as the Amber.  The flavor was there and then gone instantly...reminding me of a non-alcoholic beer.  Not worth mentioning any other characteristics except for the lack of flavor.","ryanocerus","Jul 09, 2002"
2.5,-8.4,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"2.5's across the board on this one.  A very average pils.  I guess its appearance at every Mexican restaurant makes it better than other bland offerings.  Face it, when you pair it with spicy food, its not that bad.","proc","Jul 02, 2002"
2.95,8.1,2.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Special lager?!?! no to me. all i kept hearing was better than corona as far as mexican beers go. i dont think so. this had a really funny taste to it. it was not too bad, but when i think special, i think of that excellent brew that just leaves a big smile on your face and some naked women on your lap. they are drinkable, but not enjoyable","ElGuapo","Jul 02, 2002"
2.78,1.8,3,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,"Dark straw / light golden in hue and typically clear.  The head settles into a moderate layer that persists well enough to leave lace.  The overall malt aroma is very mild and consists of light grainy notes and just a hint of cooked corn dimethyl sulfide.  Hop nose is absent.  It's clean, but unenticing aroma - wise.  The overall flavor is balanced, but bland. The mild hop bitterness is balanced by both residual malt and adjunct corn sweetness.  Malt complexity is lacking due to the adjuncts in the grist-- only a light husky flavor from the basemalt contributes flavor.  Hop flavor is virtually absent.  The finish is clean, dry, and leaves much to be desired.  Special Lager is reminiscent of a domestic macrobrew w/ more flavor.  It's definitely not a beer to be appreciated by itself.","marc77","Jun 10, 2002"
3.47,27.1,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This one is runner-up to Bohemia for Mexican beers in my opinion.  It's actually got a bit of hop flavor and lacks the sticky-sweetness of some other Mexican lagers.  It goes well with the likes of carnitas and chile relleno.","mickeymac","Jun 02, 2002"
2.91,6.6,4,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,"This is another one of those beers that I used to enjoy before my pallate evolved.  The amber color of the brew had me feeling hopeful, but the flavor was exceedingly thin.  A little hop, a little sweet.  But mostly... not much.  It was a fine beer to match up with the barbecue I was having that night, but that's about all I can say positive for it.","ebraun","May 21, 2002"
2.65,-2.9,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"You really gotta be desperate to drink alot of this.  Dos Equis is a deep mahogany color, with a big malty molasses flavor and a hop finish. This beer stays reasonably dry throughout. Corny rice filler aftertaste makes this brew a one time experience only for me.","stoutman","May 17, 2002"
3.62,32.6,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Good Continental-Style Lager. Goes well with Mexican dishes or any other spicy food. Good beer if you can get it for a decent price.  Comes in green bottles, so beware the skunks.","EagleTalon","May 12, 2002"
3.48,27.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer was a surprise. I'm not really big on the light colored beers. I usually only drink them when the goal is getting drunk. Dos Equis is similar to Corona in flavor color and most of the other factors, but it's just better tasting and a darker, fuller color. Squeeze in a little lime or not, it's just a great beer to drink with a meal, especially if you're eating mexican.","aracauna","Apr 02, 2002"

2.7,-1.1,2,2,3,3,3,"Notes: European/German brewing influences are apparent with this brew. It's not your typical Mexican lager/pils. And, even though it's essentially a mediocre beer, it's not an entirely bad beer. Pairs nicely with Mexican food or a nice alternative to American Lagers as it has a bit more body and flavour.","Todd","Nov 01, 2001"
