"Yes. I could just have less BUT better beer or no beer at all but during March madness that's not an option. Try it. It's cheap and no worse than a PBR for more ABV."
""
"The skunk mostly rears its head on the very back end.  The look is reasonable, the smell isn't awful, and it's not immediately a regretful decision to drink this beer.  I think the BABros are closer to reasonable than the overall BA score."
"A perfect college beer. Its cheap and in my opinion it tastes really good."
""
""
""
"Pours a translucent yellow with little head. The smell is mostly rice but with some chemical smell, almost metallic. There is very little to the taste. This was made to be drank fast with a slightly above average ABV."
"This beer should be banned."

"awful beer... cheap beer... beer pong type of beer"
"High abv for a college beer that's the only upside"
"Very dirty beer that has never agreed with me well."
""
"It says I have to justify."
"Says I have to justify."
"Tastes like nothing, just water. Goes down easy enough, and if I wasn't curious to see if the taste changed when it warmed (it didn't) I could have tosses the glass back in a blink. Like I said, easy drinking. Now I know why it's a favorite of college students: cheap, inoffensive, and, to quote Dave Chapelle,  ""it'll get you drunk!"""
"For what it is, this is a great beer.  I'm a college student and compared to other domestics, especially cheap ones, this is pretty good.  It doesn't have much flavor to it at all and is very smooth to drink if its cold.  Other cheap domestics like Keystone or Milwaukee's Best have an odd aftertaste to them but not Natty.  If I want something with flavor I would definitely look elsewhere, but if i want a buzz to party or need to unwind after a hard day of studying, Natty is perfect."
"This isn't terrible, is cheap enough, and will make an acceptable tomato beer.  I'm drinking this while watching the Patsies play the Dolts in the AFC championship."
"Calling this a beer is a disgrace. This is some real crap. Most people nailed it by saying it's only good for getting drunk.that is true and its cheap. It's faux beer for people who want to get drunk off of something similar to beer. And some people talk about how it's refreshing and great for relaxing.  Must be crazy to think that. If you have 5$ and want to get drunk you can get 6 pack of 16oz Natties, a couple of 40s which are far worse or a small bottle of very cheep booze. Your call"

"one of and this isnt saying much, the better ice beers around. Actually has some flavor to it. I am comparing this against beers in its class, Namely Keystone Ice Milwaukees best ICE, Bud Ice, and Busch ice. Compared to those  things this seems not bad. Not that it matters. you drink a few bottles of natural ice you forget all about the flavor. Trust me, this stuff will f**k you up. They go down incredibly easy cold anyway. Don't do what i did and accept a wager to drink it hot without puking.  Its pretty awful hot. Then again, what beer isnt? had a Sierra Nevada Pale ale ice cold, beats all of these things ive rated. once it gets warm, its just as bad."

"Overall: The cheapest drinkable beer I can find. Goes down like water and that's a good thing in this case. I wouldn't want to actually taste it."
""
""
"My daily drinker. Not the greatest beer on earth but it's cheap and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"At that rate though, just drink water."
""
""
""
""
"It's nothing fancy or worth being snobby about, but I can snag a 4-pack of tall boys for less than $3 US, and it'll get the job done quick. Keep it cold, though, it tastes a lot worse warm."

""
""

""
""
"Nattie Ice is a hard hitting yet smooth beer. It's not very good, but dang it, it gets the job done. This is the type of cheap beer I buy when I want to get drunk."
""
""
""
""
"Boom."
""
""
""
"5.9% and 18 years old. That is all. Wait, 5$ per 12pack."

"I cracked it open one night and took a few sips. I didn't really taste anything. Well, there might have been some grain there, but it was FAINT. It was not pleasant. I wanted to pour it all out. But you know what? I'm gonna be honest here. I did the thing that I think most normal people do with Natty Ice: I hammered the rest of it home and got a nice, cheap buzz."
""
""
""
""
"Overall : This isn't half bad and for what you pay for it, it's better than a lot of macros out there. I really thought this would be terrible but it's not. It's worth a shot if you're broke and want a tasty lager for the night. Still doesn't beat High Life but pretty close."
""
""
"Possibly the most efficiently drunk off of beer you can get."
""
""
""
"It's not very good, but at least it's cheap as hell. I'd drink this over Bud or that awful PBR garbage 8 days a week. If you want a good beer, leave this alone, but if you want a cheap beer that gets the job done and tastes better than most horrible watery lagers then grab yourself a Natty Ice. Stay away from Natty light."

"If you are drinking this for the flavor there's something seriously wrong with you. Glad brews like this exist, because sometimes you are just trying to get a buzz."

"I guess the lesson is is that somewhere out there is a guy that this beer is the perfect match for. Watery, and flavorless. That's how he likes his beers."

"It does it's job. I may be an considered an alcoholic but my wife and I drink this to get drunk and it works. No bad taste. We drink right out of the can and it is the best bang for your buck. I'm not a beer snob like some on here, so if you're looking to get drunk for cheap this is the beer to drink. We don't get a hangover from it and it doesn't hurt my wallet."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: First time I have ever tried this. I wasn't expecting much, so was surprised that it was not offensive at all. Definitely want to drink this one ice cold."
""
""
"Overall, this get's me loaded when I need it. I've had The younger, Heady Topper, Elder, Zombie Dust, etc etc, eat a $hit beer snobs, sometimes you need to get loaded and this does it. Doesn't taste all that bad either. If spotting bananas are your thing, look no further."

"Natty Ice dominates in the category of 'college-binge-drinking' 30 racks considering it is a hefty 5.9% (for shitty beer) and goes down like water. Not heavy, not tasteful, but gets the job done. At a price point of like $20 or less for 30 cans you can't really go wrong for the college budget. Beats out bud light and miller for bang for your buck."

"Nothing special here, i go to college so i drink it a lot.Its obviously not winning any awards but it gets you drunk. Many people might say its a terrible beer but its better than some other beers on the same level. Great if you want to get drunk because it doesn't taste like much goes down like water. equivalent taste...cold piss"

"Its a good Beer for the Buck only 5.40 a six pack of 16 oz cans where I live in silverbay mn but it is a good beer for a cheap beer better than bush an has a good color an flavor if your not realy into the hoppy beers other wise its head goes to quick other than that its a good beer"

"As much as I consider myself a Beer aficionado, I am thankful that there are brews like Natural Ice, no, you wont be sipping it and admiring it's aroma! Ha! No, instead, when your on a budget and you want 30 cold 5.9 puppies to guzzle, and get an admirable buzz, this brew is for you!"
""
""
"O - If I didn't collect 40 ounce bottles as part of my breweriana collection I probably would pass on this. This is a cheap beer with a sole purpose of introducing alcohol into the body. If this stuff get warm (over about 40F) it becomes intolerable so don't buy a big container unless you are going to share of put it back in the refrigerator between pours."

"I have got to give this beer a 3.5 out of 5, its not the best beer but its a damn good beer for your buck. $13.99 before taxes for a 30 pack. To me it tastes pretty good, got a good color and a pleasing smell and taste for your typical american adjunct lager. So yeah at 5.9% abv ice beer, i would roll with this and I am usually a Icehouse fan!"
""
"I have to say, when I first drank this beer it tasted great. I think it has been downgraded in quality and now tastes not so good. Once was good now sucks. I think that batches differ considerably, compounded by freshness variables. LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE it gets cheaped out after initial success.."

"This was not what I wanted to buy but the store did not have what I wanted so I figures I would try natty ice. Yes I would say its worse than bud light and thats pretty bad, you cant taste any alcohol so I suppose it would be ok for chugging but I like to have a nice tasting beer not water beer, and while coors or miller are certainly not craft beer they do taste like beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is certainly much better served ice cold - it definitely does not get better as it comes up to room temperature. Certainly not offensive but definitely nothing special either - I think I remember this beer as being much worse from my college days."

"This was another one that i feared was in a keg at any college party I went to. It is light amber and it doesn't have a lot of taste. the taste it does have is a sweaty taste. It also goes down pretty rough so it's not even as smooth as water. It is a cheap beer so how much can you expect right?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When one thinks of modern day so-called ""ice"" beers, images of frat boys, beer pong and toga parties likely come to mind. Surprisingly, this beer was pretty decent and not much different from ""premium"" American adjunct lagers. If you are hard up for cash and looking to get drunk, there are definitely worse options out there."

"This beer was not too good but here's the thing, if you're looking for cheap beer that doesn't go down bad, Natural ice is the beer for you. I feel like this is the type of beer that people drink more for the effect and less for the over all experience. For me its 50/50 on a day that I feel like cutting lose, but I can't really see myself drinking this beer for a long time."
""
""
"This beer taste malty then carbonated. Not a strong taste but balanced. Best beer for your money 13.99 a 30 pack here. I'm satisfied and would recommend. Seems like the flavor has changed since inbev and anhueser merged. I drink this in the can clean taste no metallic taste. Light mouth fill and light taste."
""
"Overall, this brew is remarkably flavorless for the near 6% ABV. The carbonation is probably much to blame as you can almost feel it “scrubbing” the flavor off your tongue as you drink it. Over-carbonated “Light beer” type of feel."

"This beer is horrible. Tastes like battery acid. I had this and a miller lite side by side. The miller was miles better than this. This is the worst of the cheap beers, and one can also assume that means it is the worst beer on the market, which it is. Horrible beer which only is sold for high school and college partys. Rest assured though this beer does its job: to get people drunk and laid."
"Overall – Rather average adjunct lager. Nothing to offensive but nothing too great- it gets the job done."
""
""
""
"O - It's an adjunct lager--you know what you're getting. Nothing special, just a fizzy beer with a low price tag and a decent bang in the alcohol department. Not a great brew, but sure hits the spot after a few hours of yard work."

"16 oz can into pint glass,One finger head,minimized to a toothpick head within seconds, toothpick head stays throughout. Minimal lacing,but its there. Sweet,corn,malt,describe the smell.The taste is close to the same. Very drinkable. Crisp and clean finish,and a good buzz quickly established. I really think that for the money you can not find a better beer I have spent over $30 for a 12 pack for beer before, and was not impressed. Natural Ice=Impressed"
""
""
""
""
"ohhh natural ice. had it last night (sigh), our friend got the wrong stuff. The first one wasn't THAT bad, then the 2nd and 3rd were just terrible. I couldn't even drink it, it tasted like skunked beer even though it was ice cold. we just threw the remaining dozen away cause it wasn't tolerable. I feel for anyone who has to consume this."
"Overall:. Drank this beer ice cold , it will not taste bad. I would choose this over Miller High Life, Bud Lite, and coors lite. If I was on budget or for beer pong or dranking game buy it . For cheap beer it is good!"
""
"appearance isnt that great, to dark for a pilsner in my opinion, smell is averege I suppose, taste isnt that great, very metallic, smooth, but I have to force it down, mouthfeel is alright I suppose. But overall this isnt a good beer, even for the price, I would take Icehouse over this anyday of the week, I used to like it, but now that I've had a variety of beers I think this one is rather overated."

"Poured this American Adjunct Lager from a 22 oz can into a pint glass. Poured a pale straw color, produced an average head, retention was poor and it left no lacing on the glass. The aroma was very clean, perhaps some malt and rice. Light in body, this lager has a foundation of corn and rice....all adjuncts here....not much of any malt flavor to speak of- only a small helping of hops. Overall, a poorly made beer. Keep your 1.25 and put a down payment on a real beer."
""
""
"Eric"
""
""
""
"Big head at first then dies quickly. Very nice on the sides of the tongue and then finishes with a good mouthfeel. The alcohol creeps up on you very quickly and then, BAM, you are on your ass! Whoa! Ate pretzels and sardines in mustard sauce to keep the buzz in check. Finally finished with 2 more and went to bed."
""
"Overall, this is an ok beer when it's a hot day out. It's refreshing, but you can really taste the alcohol in it in the initial few sips."
"This is bad. Pours the color of urine after an evening drinking BCBS. Smells like vodka. In my years as a server of cheap beer, I served enough of this to fill the building that you're stitting in. Everytime I made the mistake of drinking it I vomited."
""
""
""
""
"Light body. Highly carbonated. If you drink it, pound it, because if it even warms up a little bit, it tastes like the Devil's taint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is probably one of the worse beers you can buy. Very dull and watered down taste makes it a unwanted beer in my opinion. If you are looking for a cheap beer there are better choices than Natural Ice to choose. The can is unattractive as well. If you are looking for a beer as simple as its name, this is what you are looking for."

"I’ve had this plenty of times, but this was the first time I rated it. It was actually a bit better than I remember it and I still swear by Natty Light for my cheap beer. The ratings, however, didn’t come out to well, even when considering the style. It is funny that I used to think that “ice” beers were so strong."

"This is an average example of a macro lager. It is extremely cheap at $11.25 a case. I found out that my now ex-girlfriend is a dirty lying bitch and I am really poor so I bought a case of this the other night. I was forced to drink garbage. It got me drunk, didn't take away any of my problems, and made me feel like hell the next day. But when you drink all but a handful of the whole case in one sitting, any beer is bound to do that to you. For the price, Natty isn't to shabby."

"Why am I wasting my time with this beer. I'm not in college anymore. I have a job. I have a REAL job where I make REAL money and I have a fridge full of decent-to-excellent craft beer. I'm not standing in front of a table of strategically placed plastic cups and there are no Greek letters anywhere around me. Even for ""magro lagers", there are much better choices than this swill."

"This beer has continued to be my favorite throughout the years. It's one of the cheapest beers I can think of, being $14 for a 30 can case and it continues to get better and better. Yes, the taste isn't extremely lovable but once you get through it, they continue to get better and better, by the third one, it tastes delicious. To me, the taste is somewhat similar to maybe a bud ice or budweiser, though the only discourse I have is about the 153 calories that are found in the 5.9& Natural Ice. This is while Natural Ice with a 4.2% is a less calorie intake beer though takes a bit longer to dirnk."

"I love Natural Ice Beer! I like how it does not have a watered down taste to it. The beer has a bite to it. I also like how strong it is compared to other beers in the same price range which is another reason I love this beer. It is cheap! I don't think a beer has to cost a lot to be a great beer. It seems to have a bad rep around where i live, but I love it!"

"The smell is much better than the taste. Sweetness and hops are present here, but the beer taste fades and you taste alcohol at the end of the sip. I didn't expect to taste much alcohol at 5.9 ABV, buts its very much there. If you want to drink a beer that tastes like it has a shot of cheap vodka in it, get Natural Ice."

"O: Gotta give this one some props. Most of these kinds of beers are really disgusting. This one isn't too offensive and is easily drinkable. I'd choose this over Miller Lite, Bud Lite, Icehouse, etc."
"O: I drink this when watching football and other TV. Fills in when I tire of my collection of crafts!! I often start a session with a good craft like Pliny, Sculpin or HopSlam, then switch over to NI to finish before eating dinner. I like this beer."
"This is one of those reviews that you do based on the type of beer you are reviewing, not necessarily beer in general. This beer does what it is supposed to do, it'll get ya buzzed for dirt cheap while watching the game. I bought a 30 back for the price of a single bomber or other beers i've bought before. Lighter golden color with a small head. Smell is not impressive, smells like corn water. Taste isn't really as bad as one might expect. It is just as bad as any BMC, except it super cheap!. mouthfeel is watery but refreshing. Overall i have reviewed about 400 beers, some the best in the world, but sometimes when budgets are stretched you just gotta make do."
"O - Eh. Not horrible I guess. Ill have not problem knocking back this 24oz can. Not my macro of choice but it was left in my refrigerator by a friend so I can't complain. Don't think I would be able to do more than one can though."
"The can opened with no fizz at all but when it poured a massive 3"" white head erupted, held about one minute, and then totally deflated rapidly. I suspect some alchemy at work there. Body is a clear straw yellow and it appears to have spent all it's bubbles on the head and now is flat. Smell is a weak sour grassiness and the taste is very watery with a little of the same. Ice water would have more appeal."
"Well, it pours a pale straw, malt liquor looking beer, with a giant lose bubbled head that thins to a lace. Has the look of diet apple juice. Smells grainy, sweet boiled corn. Very bland taste, sweet corn, and grains, faint hops, grass. Light on the feel, goes down fast. This is just an average AAL, thats iced brewed. for a buck fifty you cant go wrong."
"Another instance of form over substance - cheap, plentiful, and not all that offensive - if I didn't know any better, I'd be drinking this like water, which I'm sure actually happens all the time. Really, this is pretty innocuous, and not even that saccharine, so much so that I don't even rue the pocket change expended. It is what it is, and for that, I cannot truly find fault."
"Again, take it for what it is: the best of a bad bunch. Cough up your $6, turn off your palette for a second, turn your hat backward, put on a movie that makes you laugh, and enjoy."
"Drank this beer a lot through college and usually was satisfied just because I knew I paid very little and got a pretty good punch of alcohol. Being on a budge should be the only reason to buy this beer, otherwise go for something else. Taste is not too pleasant in the beginning but after a few back to back you will soon think it's water and slam one after the other."
"Finally, I just cracked open a fresh can, and I just think this one tastes better that way: straight outta the can."
"Pours a nice golden color with thick head the thins to a lace. Smells like standard corn adjunct beer. Goes down smooth, but only because there is very little carbonation and no hops. A little extra alcohol notes as standard of and ice beer. Nothing special here, but definitely no the worse thing out there either."
"O/D-One of the worst I have had. Even some malt liquors taste better."
"Overall, avoid this beer if you can although if you are a college student you will very likely end up having these at parties."
"Straw colored with lots of bubbles, no head. Smell is of corn/grain and metal. Taste would be fine, but I hate the metallic flavor that it has. Mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation. Ice beers are not one of my favorites, but this one might be better than bud ice."
"Edit: an hour or so later, it is not sitting well. Overall, I will avoid this in the future.`"
"Overall: Much like most other AALs, it's not a great tasting brew...but it's Natty Ice."
"I like Natty Ice. I know that's an unpopular opinion, but among the cheaper beers, I rate this at the top."
"O: Get drunk"
"Cheers..."
"This is cheap beer to mess you up. This is meant for mass consumption so you can forget how lame the taste was prior to the last one you just had."
"Not a bad beer overall. At 6%, it tastes like 5% and it's probably best drinking it while cutting the grass. Pretty mellow, carbonated taste. I picked up a 12 pack for 10 bucks in Arkansas. I like the flavors that it has...nothin overly done but flavorful enough to keep me interested. Mouthfeel is a little fluffy, not as solid as I would have liked but that's about all I can complain about. Will buy again."
"Natty ICE, 12oz bottle into pint. Pours light straw, 1/2"" white head with no retention. Smells of corn husk, some sort of steamed veg-all, and alcohol. Taste matchs the nose quite well, steamed veggies, corn, and a sweet residual malt character. I'm actually happy to say that a friend that works for AB gave me seven cases, which a few have a couple broken bottles inside. I'll be putting them to good use when the temp reaches 100* here in this hell hole known as Georgia. Overall, this isnt a bad beer and I actually like it alot more than Bud ICE for some odd reason."
"Good only if you're looking for something to get a lot of for dirt cheap. Not something I would ever go out of my way to try again."
"The taste can be ok sometimes. I always felt like some batches tasted better than others, and in comparison to higher priced AB brands it sometimes gave them a run for their money."
"Friend of mine tossed me one of these during Super Bowl XLIV. Wanted to toss it right back but instead I cracked open the can and gave it a whack. Very light on flavor, it wasn't anything to write home about. Half way through I started getting a headache. Not sure if it was from the beer or not, I just found it ironic. I'm happy I at least tried this brew. But I never have to have this again."
"D - The go to party beer in college. Dirt cheap with a pretty terrible taste. Glad I don't drink this too often anymore."
"D: About as flavorful as WonderBread. This isn't doing anything for me. This is the worst brew offered by a brewer that goes out of its way to crush the micro-brew revolution. Avoid..."
"This is not the worst mouthfeel ever, except I just got a little particle lodged in my teeth which came directly from this can of beer. I know they aren't the same style, but after having TREAT by Midnight Sun, I don't know what the hell I am doing having this beer. I have class in the morning. This tastes like really weak cough syrup - which removes the whole point of having anything that tastes like cough syrup. I LIKE cough syrup, yet this one can't pull it off which is frustrating to say the least."
" There are no redeeming qualities here except for rock bottom price to get drunk on the cheap."
"D: One of the mildest macro ice beers out there. If you want to get drunk without flavour go here."
"My room mate filled my taster of this gem the other night. What a guy! Reviewed from notes. Really light clear yellow color with a transparent body with lively carbonation and no real head to speak of. Looks alright, but just kind of boring. Sweet bubble gum aroma. Corn. Overall this smells weak and kind of lame. I can't taste much, but this just isn't good. It's kind of sweet with dry grains to the pallet. Honestly, I've had more flavorful water. This is palletable, but not really pleasant. Simply put, this is light and over carbonated. Not interesting at all but I don't even really notice this one going down. Damn easy to drink."
"Taste is a bit of a letdown however. Rather watery in nature with little as for discernible flavors. Perhaps a light touch of grain and a hint of citrus. Nothing negative per se, just nothing good either. Feel is thin but improves with some exposure though I'd be concerned about letting it warm up for long. OK drinkability if you like the style, in which case I'd go with the Icehouse."
"Bottle into a glass. Immediately regretted not putting into the freezer first. Best served as cold as possible to hide the taste. High alcohol and low cost. Those are the main selling points of this beer to consumers. Pretty much of a disaster of a brew, this one."
"this beer sucks this beer sucks this beer sucks this beer sucks this beer sucks this beer sucks this beer sucks this beer sucks this beer sucks this beer sucks"
"D - Could be better, but for the price I'll drink it."
"D- Drinkable as water with faint hints of rot. Crisp, refreshing, clean and flavorless."
"D: A little flavorful considering the style, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, it's exactly what you would expect from the style, it might not be even an average beer overall, but I've had several other beers in the style that are a lot worse."
"D: I needed the cheapest possible beer to cook chili with, and this lonely can was left over. Not putrid, but definitely insipid. Even if this is your preferred style, grab a High Life or something."
"Has a sweet cinnamon disc-like sweetness that has always turned me away from the light version of this beer. Tropical alcohol and cooked corn are the standout flavors here and neither really want to be the lead pony. One of the least flavorful of the ""ice"" beers out there, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Like a clean malt liquor. I think I can finish my can, but if I want a cold tallboy out of the ice bath at a local convenience store, I'd rather have a Busch."
"There are things on this planet that are what they are, and there's little use trying to qualitatively assess them unless doing so is part of a medical study. Diarrhea, rickets, flesh wounds... these things aren't compared by the merits of their qualities, only in varying degrees of how awful they were to endure, hence systems like the ""pain scale."" Yeah, this is an 8. Not as bad as drinking bad moonshine, but it's easily the worst beer I've ever had. It really does taste worse when poured into a glass (I absolutely will not say it tastes ""better"" from the can). You don't drink this unless you're fourteen and couldn't steal any Smirnoff Ice from the 7-11, or it's in a red plastic cup, you've got a ping pong ball in your hand and you're in a frat. I loathe this substance."
"D: This stuff is probably the worst of the adjunct lagers. At least most of them are not so blatantly offensive."
"It smells like a used diaper filled with indian food. If you have ever heard of jenkem you could probably compare the drinkablitiy to that concoction."
"Save yourself from this beer... must have Dogfish"
"I poured into a pint glass to a large white head. The beer is pale yellow in color. The aroma is alcohol and sweet malt. The taste is sweet malt. I get no hops taste at all. There's not really a whole lot of taste. It's cheap and it goes down like water. It's only suitable for binge drinking."
"Drinkable for those lost in a desert for forty days and/or addicted to bad beer."
"D: this was supposed to be an easily drinkable beer for a quick buzz, but is absolutely sad,even for a macro. i see why people buy the light version, ill go for pabsts"
"Clear gold with a white head which disappears almost immediately. Smells of grain, husks. Very musty. Tastes as bad as it smells. Musty, with some grain flavor. Not much else. Thin, fair carbonation, watery, and not very impressive at all. Not one of the better adjunct lagers to be sure."
"Beware of the natty dreads of this swampass Sswamp thing, just awful...."
"Pours an ultra pale yellow, one of the lightest colored beers I have seen. Completely clear. Thin white head. A virtually non existent aroma; I smell a hint of corn and ethanol. Taste is watery and bland, a hint of corn and ethanol in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is like that of carbonated water, medium carbonation, not good at all. Drinkability is the highest ranked characteristic, even though it is still only a 2. I wouldn't get this again, though I suppose it is a better value than the 'premium' BMC brands with it's lower price."
"The beer when nobody can afford it or legally purchase anything better. I have grown to hate natty ice, with its horrible, indistinguishable taste, terrible smell, and bad feel. Even having it in my mouth makes me uncomfortable. Overall, terrible in every way."
"Some find it hard to drink, I find that it goes down like water, and packs a punch as well. Like Bud Light, but with significantly more ABV. A good beer if you're trying to get drunk. Does a good job for the price as well."
"This beer is garbage. It pours a light yellow and has a horrid smell. The taste is extremely watery and reminds of tonic water. I agree that the only place for this beer is on the far end of a table for beer pong. It's cheap and does the job if you're short on cash."
"D: Wouldnt even drink this if it was free. I dont care about the cheap price and shit load of alcohol content. I will go sober or die of thirst."
"Body and drinkability were both typical for the style. This isn't a style that I seek out, but, due to issue with me running off at the mouth, I have to drink a few examples of the style, I might as well review 'em."
"D- It's made for those looking to get buzzed. Nothing to discern it from others of its type."
"5. Drinkable if Ice cold, Had to force the second half down though."
"Even though I am grading to the style this one is bad."
"Not good, not good at all."
"Final thoughts - This beer was made for a cheap buzz it's very close to Cobra and made for college students and those who just want to get wasted. Not that there is anything wrong with that. However with the variety of other cheap beers on the market you can do better."
"Overall: Like I said, Natty Ice tastes more temperant than Keystone Ice, but smells worse."
"Natural Ice has a crisp clean, slightly sweet taste and the carbonation isn't too light or too heavy. Also, I did a test with Natural Ice by leaving a half of a tall can in the refrigerator for two days, obviously-open. Most beer would be good and flat by then, but not Natural Ice. After the two days open in the fridge, I poured it into a clear glass and it had almost as much head as a freshly opened beer. I drank it and it was still great. Any other beer I would have poured down the drain."
"Cons: weak representation of 'beer'."
"If they were giving these away for free at the beer store, I would drop mine in the box for starving children."
"Drinkability- Nice bang for your buck. Good price/alcohol ratio if that's what floats your boat."
"Pours a light yellow color, nice carbonation, small white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, slight hop note. Light body. Not drinkable, would not buy again."
"Natural ICE brewed  by Anheuser Busch. This ICE Beer has an ABV of 5.9%. This brew pours out a nice amber color with a nice white head. The smell is corn and grains. There is also a hit of hops in this brew. The taste is mild with grains and malts. You can pick up on the 5.9%  This is a good cheap priced ICE beer. The drink ability of this beer is ok. This brew goes down smooth with no bad aftertaste. Not the best but not the worst.  Overall I'm giving Natural ICE a 4.5 out of 5. When I low on cash I go for good old Natty ICE. Natural ICE has more of a kick to it than Natural Light. Great price for a ICE beer. I would buy this brew again."
"RJT"
"Poured from a 24 ounce glass. Yellow, golden color. No head and no carbonation. Corn, butter like smell. Nothing special about the taste, normal corn, rice and some green grass flavors. I am drinking this very cold since it is a Ice beer. Mouthfeel is pretty water like. Do not reach for this brew on purpose."
"Anfriend that was over gave me a tall of this. Normally, I wouldn't even pour this into one of my glasses, but had to. It pours pale yellow with a head that rises and settles just as fast. The smell is almost unbearable. Metallic, faintly malty, with some notes of laundry detergent. The taste is just about the same. Soapy, astringent, and unpleasant. Malt is minimal, with some hints of fresh bread and toffee, but the medicinal, cough syrup notes still overwhelm the palate. Light bodied, and in a bad way, this beer is for those who drink beer for the lone purpose of getting drunk. Not one I would consider when even buying for company."
"It has a pale yellow color that doesn't look as appitizing as it really is. It does have kind of a metallic taste but all around for the price it is a good beer. It is very carbonated but its mouth feel is not that harsh not like a malt liqour and has as much abv% you have a decent drinkability that is quite refreshing."
"D: Very good for hot days but with too much ABV and you can get drunk without realizing it."
"From the 24 fl. oz. can marked 09322-NB43. Sampled on January 3, 2010. I saw this single can sitting in the cooler of my corner store and rolled my eyes. I knew I hadn't reviewed it so after a little hestitation, I bought it. It pours pale yellow with a thin bubbly white head and ongoing carbonation. The aroma is a bit like cereal, grass, alcohol, and a hint of hops. Thin mouthfeel. The taste is more alcohol than anything which is a bit of a turnoff for me in a beer. The aftertaste is a bit annoying. This is not a tremendous beer but it does get you buzzed."
"Appearance has a light golden color with a quick dissipating head. Smell, I had to work at, but it has a very faint rice aroma. Taste of very light rice and hops, probably the cleanest tasting ice beer i've had and for being so clean I don't even taste the alchohol. Mouthfeel is a rich light with good carbonation. Even though there is no complexity to it, for an ice beer it goes down rather smooth and refreshing."
"If you want to get the job done, then drink this. Golden yellow appearance with a big head. Aroma is non existent aside from a tinge or two of malts. Taste is malty, sour rather alcoholic, and more like a malt liquor. Alcoholic flavor is strong even though it is only 5.9. If not tasting, this is a good in between."
"Natural Ice is 100% win."
"The whole Natty family was a major part of my underage drinking and partying years back. I figure I at least owe this beer a review."
"Straight out of a 40. Not much to say about Natural Ice other than that it is cheap. Little taste that I could discern, but nothing abhorrent at that. Maybe some sweetness, a bit more complex than some of its stablemates. Of course, it is highly drinkable, which is the point. Pressed for cash and desirous of a little buzz? You could definitely do worse."
"Poured from a 24 oz. can. Has a very pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some notes of corn. Taste is not so good. Metallic and alcohol with some corn. Feels light in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall there are far better cheap beers than this one."
"D- If you're a fratboy or a bum looking to get drunk as hell, it an A+. However, if you're anything else stay away from this awful brew at all costs."
"Let's face it, this is a ""I want to get obliterated drunk tonight"" beer."
"Serving type: Can"
"D: No please don't"
"24 oz. can at my local grocery for $1.49, why not? Poured into my pilsner glass a slightly dark yellow with a monster of a white head on top. Retention was decent, and it left some spots of lace. Smells very cheap and grainy. Nothing to the nose at all. The mouth was thin and wet. Typical for the style. The flavor was better than some other macros I've tried, but still thin and lacking any substance. Hints of cheap grains, and slight honey-kissed breadiness on the finish. Not much going on. This would be refreshing on a hot day, no doubt, but I will most likely never have this again."
"Barely decent if you're in the mood for a very bland beer that you barely know you are drinking. If you need a beer to absent-mindedly sip while you're watching a game you could do worse, but there's precious else to say for this beer."
"Overall, I am really not liking this beer at all. I can see most regular college guys drinking this because of the abv and the price, but this one is not for me."
"Pours a very pale yellow color with a fizzy head. The smell is of sweet corn grains and rice. The taste is metallic with grains, it is very bitter and skunky. The bitter isn't due to hops, its just bitter. The mouthfeel is slick and highly carbonated. Overall this is a rough beer to drink, you could not have many of them."
"This is a beer that is marketed solely towards college aged people what with their ""naturday"" ads calling thursday (thirsty thursday) the day to drink Natty products. Had it at a party. Not impressed. Really not much to say. Didn't expect it to be good. It wasn't."
"D - Despite it's terrible smell and flavor, or lack-thereof, it would wash wings down easily for a frat-boy in need alcohol in any form. Unfortunately, I'm not a frat-boy. Just awful."
"D-Couldn't afford better beer... xtra in fridge now... prob drink more tom.... add xtra point to drink for that purp but dat it... k... only buy this if ur broke redneck and aren't against domestic violence... haha... seriously.. k..."
"Drinkability: The worst, even for free I could only drink one."
"Honestly, I was expecting something much worse. While Natty Ice is very bad, I would have no problem drinking it."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is Naturally smooth and easy to drink. Mild carbonation feel as the alcohol level taints the tongue with little to offend the mouthfeel. Drinkablity is great for an ice beer in the U.S. I could drink this if offered as a party beer."
"I think the other derogatory remarks come from the good beer cultists. If I'da had this in my younger days I'd be rolling around the floor in stupefied ecstasy, and I would have never touched that fifth of Gallo muscatel. Lighten up, guys. You must be those guys who won't buy a gut bomb from the dollar menu. Only two cans, and it is taking hold, while I sob in nostalgia listening to Ray singing ""Georgia On My Mind."""
"Not that great, but I was impressed with the high alcohol content without the nasty malt liquor end of the can taste."
"D: bought a 30 of this, and it comes in a 30 for a reason. Not a good beer for relaxing with, its for getting drunk. Not bad for a cheap beer its way better then is light conterpart. Not a bad deal for its price"
"I think I would enjoy a nice cold King Cobra instead, around the same price and ABV, but more enjoyable to me. I say give it a try if you don't want to pick up some 40s of Malt Liquor, or you need to conceal your alcoholic beverage."
"So so so very bad...Pleas I beg you stay away from Natty Ice. Natural Light at least has the fact that it has no taste period so you can pound them back. Natty Ice has such a wretched taste that I cannot finish one. To be honest, the god-awful smell of this beer is most comparable to a urinal in a truck stop that someone pissed in three days ago and it hasn't been flushed yet. God, just an awful beer."
"From the smell to the aftertaste it is terrible. It tastes nothing like ""Beer"". It is bottled and cheap...that's about it. I may drink it if there were no anesthetic to take before a surgery...may."
"This beer poured a clear yellow with a two-finger head that didn't last long and some visible carbonation. The smell is sweet adjunct, probably rice or corn. The taste reflects the smell, not a whole lot going on besides what was absolutely needed to produce the alcohol. There may be a tiny bit of hops towards the finish. The mouthfeel is watery and fairly aggressively carbonated. When it's cold it's not too hard to drink, but good luck if you let it warm up. This is a beer engineered to get college kids, rednecks, and the homeless from zero to drunk in as few hours and dollars as possible."
"Literally the worst beer ever. All of my experiences with this horrible thing that calls itself beer have been unquestionably negative. I have nothing nice to say. I can't even get drunk on this beer because I can't finish one. So so bad. I pray to God you never have to drink this pig slop. The only thing that separates it from donkey piss is the fact that Natty Ice can get you drunk. If you can finish one."
"24 ounce ghetto can sans paper bag. Pee yellow with a soapy white head. Resembles pee very much. Smells like metal and old musty hay. It smells like the under side of a bottle cap found behind a 7/11 dumpster. There's an unpleasant corn sludge kind of taste and texture to this swill. Nasty aftertaste. Tough to drink. Not good. You get what you pay for. $1.29 worth of 5.9% last resort. P.U."
"A golden yellow pour,two fingers of fizzy white head. Aroma of cereal grain,cornflakes,and a very faint fruit note.Flavor of corn/rice sweetness, thin body,acceptable mouthfeel,some faint bitterness at the end. spotty lacing.Not as horrible as expected,drinkable and cheep."
"Taste was much like the smell. And as the beer warms up, it gets worse. There's a good bit of carbonation that could almost make this beer, when ice cold, a decent quick summertime buzz at the beach. Otherwise it's okay for the day before payday."
"(rated Aug 14, 2008)"
"This beer doesn't deserve a pour, but it's a light straw color with dissipating head. The smell and taste are both a bit skunky; grains and metal also very present. The only perks of this beer are the fact that it's cheap and has 5.9% alcohol, so it's good for session drinking and/or drinking games. Avoid if looking for anything resembling taste or refreshment."
"This beer should really be labeled simply as brown water. It has a bitter, metallic taste which is overshadowed more than anything else by water. The only thing worse than drinking this beer is the feeling you get the next morning. 5.9% is way too much for a beer like this."
"This beer is embarassing. There is a bitter taste with no rhyme or reason to the substance of the beer or the mouthfeel. With the exception of the piss-yellow color inherent in other beers of similar taste, there is little to like about this beer except to drink it cold and really really quick. Its unfortunate that I decided to drink this after starting with a substantive, light craft brew with a similar color, for this ruined my inclination to try anything from Anheuser-Busch."
"Mouthfeel: Thin and watery."
"In Natural Ice, the keyword is the Ice. Another tool for getting drunk and it's very popular with college student who don't have refined beer tastes. To drink it cold, it is somewhat drinkable but warm is completely intolerable. No good in my opinion. -Dale"
"24 oz. can. Pours a piss yellow with no head. Aroma is straw and a bit of yeasty dough/sweat. Flavor is sweet all the way and finishes extremely alcoholic. A cheap way to get really drunk and sick the next day. Had this the same night as the bud cheladas, possibly skewing my perspective."
"Since this is an ""ice"" beer, I'll stick to the basics. It's cheap ($5.99 per 12, depending on locale) and has a 5.9% alcohol content (= cheap drunk). Considering those are it's selling points, what can you expect from it's other qualities? Well, I didn't notice much of a smell at all coming from the 12 oz. can but taste is harsh if you're not used to it. Fittingly, it has the taste of something you're drinking solely to get drunk. Obviously the more you drink the more you get used to it and buzzed, but why subject yourself to it unless you're desperate? Ice beers serve their purpose, but taste is not their strong suit. The only ice beers I've had that agree with me and that I can consider drinking again are Keystone Ice and Icehouse. Natural Ice is better than Milwaukee's Best Ice sure, but what's that saying? If you're looking for a buzz out of 2 cans and money is tight, ice beers will do the job. Find one you can deal with before committing to a quantity of them. Just please don't think this is what beer is supposed to taste like."
"Dusty, corn, malt, foul taste. This stuff is just harsh. If you're going to go cheap get the Natural Light, at least you may be able to stomach that. Isn't this more expensive than the Light too? Never liked any these Ice beers."
"Pale straw yellow color, aroma of stale malts and alcohol. Decent head and some decent retention too and some lacing. Carbonation fades quickly. Very middle of the road on the palette. Some hops, some metallic malt, medium body, bitter finish. Classic cheap beer. Should have a label that reads 'Warning: To be drunk by frat boys only.'"
"Not recommended, even for a cheap macro..."
"D: At 5.9% abv I didn't detect as much alcohol as I did off flavors. One was more then enough and was pretty rough going down. Not something I would ever care to try again."
"This is disgustingly sweet, though flavor is virtually non-existent. Is this for people who don't want any taste but just the extra bit of alcohol? I'd say so. Insta-headache. I figured - I'll try it how bad can it be? Oh. It numbed my tongue for a bit. PASS."
"D - Eh, this stuff is what it is. For a 5.9% macro, it wouldn't be the roughest thing to drink, and I'll probably be able to finish this can without much problem. Not something I'd every seek out, however. It was packaged in a cool can though."
"Friends don't let Friends drink BUD products..."
"Unless is this the only beer avaliable, stay away. I feel overcharged, and it was a free can."
"12 oz can baby! Might as well be a ratings whore a rate this swill of old times sake. Aroma is not that good at all smells like sweat, corn, and dirt feet. Pours a clear golden with a huge sized white head that sticks around for a while. Taste is grainy, corn, somewhat sweet, and not totally unpleasant. Aftertaste, There really isn't any. Overall, It's a macro malt Licka what else can I say."
"M/D: Dry mouth fee that goes into a slimy feel down the throat. Drinkable but definitely not the best."
"I was giving this beer by a friend, and when he warns you that it is warm and old is not a good start. I decided to pour it into a cup, so if I didn't feel like drinking it. First off there is no carbonation to this beer what so ever, so it fills up quickly. Same golden color as all AB beers are. The smell almost made me choke, it was like water poured out of a metal pipe. The taste is just like the smell but with a mouthfull of alcohol. The mouthfeel is very thin which is a little plus since this beer doesn't stay in your mouth that long. The drinkability is more for people who enjoy ICE beers, but I think even if it was cold it wouldn't help this beer much."
"Notes: Overall it is light and easy to drink with a light price tag. It's not bad for a cheap buzz although it's not a beer I would normally seek out."
"Pours from the 16 oz can the typical macro golden yellow with a somewhat impressive 2 finger head (on an angle-and-straighten pour) that quickly dissolves into a light collar. Macro fizziness abounds. It has an aroma that is reminiscent of moldy straw and cheese. There's an initial hit of sweetness on the first sip, followed by a bitterness that seems more ""chemical"" that a result of hops being added. Mouthfeel is sharp & harsh, with a tingle on the tongue from the fizziness. If consumed both cold enough & fast enough so that it's flavor is undetectable, I suppose one could knock back a few on a hot summer day. The Commercial Description at the top of the page states that this is a ""subpremium-priced ice beer"". They forgot to add that it's a subpremium-quality ice beer as well. Good for one thing and one thing only: getting wasted quickly and inexpensively! Quite simply, this is bottom-of-the-barrel swill, to be consumed only as an act of desperation!"
"This beer is similar to all other ice beers. A yellow pale hay color. This beer has a decent head that fades away fast. Doesn't look appealing by any means. Bad alcohol smell mixed with bad hops. Taste is also heavy in bad alcohols. Not a horrible beer, but not good. The body is light with far too much carbonation. Not very drinkable."
"It started out well, with a solid finger's worth of foamy, bone white head, but it quickly reduced to wispiness, leaving behind an impressive sticky lace. The nose was sickly sweet, like bubble gum (or as a previous reviewer so aptly put it, scented shampoo). Not a good start. The color was a beautiful sunshine yellow with NE-plus quality clarity. In fact, A-B is the standard bearer for the clarity test. Their products are generally so bright that nothing else could possibly measure up. Sadly, I drink for taste and not for looks. Mouthfeel was medium with a mild sweetness on the tongue. The finish, however, was wickedly sweet with that perfume-y/gummy/ scented soapy taste just lingering well past the swallow. Ugh. In some Belgians, this might be satisfactory, but from a glaring example of macro swill? It's one step above a drain pour."
"The taste also has light moldy grain and a hint of bubblebath. Other than that, it's bland, rough, and boring, and tasting more like rough mineral water, it is not as foul tasting as smelling."
"Pass. Just bought it to review it, and I'm quite sure I'll never buy it again."
"Oh yes, I remember you, Natty Ice. Gets a D-, in honor of the memories."
"Notes: This is a sub-premium beer (cheap one) but this beer is not actually that bad. It can be like best of the worst."
"Not very drinkable in my mind. Have had worse, though."
"D - I can pretty much say that I'll never drink this beer again its doesn't have much going for it other than its cheap as hell but tastes horrible"
"D- I will never spend money on this beer probably wouldnt want any if it was offered to me."
"This beer is not good at all. It pours an almost clear/yellow color that turns into a pale yellow in the glass. There is a thin head that disappears quickly into thin lacing. Smells like metal and corn. Funny... the taste is of metal and corn as well, with the sweetness of the heightened alcohol level. Mouthfeel is okay, decent fizz and is fairly drinkable once you get past the first couple of sips."
"Drinkability: It was punishment, but it was never difficult to drink enough to get drunk."
"Alright, I'm the biggest beer snob out there but I bought a 12er of this to get drunk and I have to admit it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. No one buys this stuff for the taste, so for what it is I'll give Naty Ice a thumbs up. It got me drunk on the cheap and that's the purpose of this stuff. There are much worst tasting beers out there that don't get you nearly as hammered. For example, this stuff is 10 times better than Corona and it's half the price."
"Drinkability: An unrewarding, cheapo beer. Its cost matches its quality."
"overall, this is a cheap college beer and not much more"
"A rite of passage."
"Almost no color, flavor or smell whatsoever except alochol. In fact, this brew is pretty much nothing but alcohol and water with some hops (maybe one per can). I can't even believe I used to drink this stuff often during college when I was in a pinch. It does hit you quicker than later, and after a few your tastebuds are decimated and they start to go down w/o a problem. My suggestion is to keep this beer as cold as possible and your mug as cold as possible - freeze out all the ingredients other than water and alcohol."
"Poured from the 12 oz aluminum can into my straight sided glass tumbler. The bright yellow color is topped by a white head that quickly subsides. The raisiny sweet smell is one of high alcohol and very little else. A good hop taste is present with malt to just barely balance. The mouthfeel is quite good, and the drinkability is also good. in my opinion, this is the best Bud brand to drink on a regular basis."
"I remember having this years ago. I have not found a beer this nasty. I know we are not supposed to slam beers here, but I really feel that they were trying to make the nastiest stuff in the history in beer. If this is true, then well done. It is funny that someone said that it is a good beer to have while mowing the lawn. I remember I used to mow the neighbors lawn and he would toss me a can of that afterwards. I don't know how I used to get that beer down."
"Decent swill beer. Leans toward the Malt Liquor realm but has no bad flavors. Easy drinking and of course a great value. Very close to a Cream Ale and has been rated as such. Will have to do a side by side with Genny Cream sometime to see which is best."
"This beer is to get you drunk for as little money as possible. It smells pretty bad, tastes pretty bad, and looks like warm piss. But the reason I gave it a 5 for mouthfeel is because it feels pretty good going down. Will Ferril put it best - ""Once it hits your lips, it tastes so good"". This beer is for just that purpose - to get to that point, and it does it's job very well. Beats Natty Light and anything else in it's category."
"Typical pale yellow macro color with the usaul macro nose.The taste is has a slight steel and alcohol taste to it.You know what your getting when you buy one and for the money I think it's worth it.The perfect beer if playing cards,watching football or just kicking back after a rough day!!"
" At 5.9% ABV this is really not a classic session beer and too be honest if you can get through one of these, your looking to get a buzz not enjoy the beer."
"Popular among college students because of its price alone, at least I hope so"
"D - I find that I enjoy ""ice brewed"" (whatever the hell that means) lagers better than their light or ""premium"" (ha!) brethren, but this is an exception. It's ok when chilled, but nasty as hell when anywhere above freezing cold. Too acrid for sessioning."
"After having Natural Ice, we wait for the conclusion of the College Invtational, which will be happening tomorrow."
"Well natty ice does it again. Very cheap and high in alcohol but not good enough to buy at home. They have it on tap at the local Wingshack for 4 dollars a pitcher, talk about a deal in a college town."
"Pale yellow (nearly urine) color with a head that just fades, fades, fades. Nothing impressive at first. Aroma is bland and corn-ish. Taste is just dull with nothing but corn, corn, corn. High in alcohol and low in ghetto-cred. Trust me, you're better off sticking to something like Steel Reserve if you like your beer cheap and quaffable."
""
"Careful; as other reviews clam thisone is no more than a get drunk brew, ya the 5.9% does hit ya, alittle sooner and stronger than you might think."
"This beer is cheap, gets you drunk quick, and goes down pretty smooth. If youre looking for a review of the quality of the beer, youre looking at the wrong brew, this is not for drinking with a meal or anything, this is for getting drunk cheaply. But, it is greeeeat for that!"
"Pouring the contents from the bottle into a shaker reveals a very light yellow beer with a small, soapy head which fizzes away soon. The aroma has a profile similar to many other American pale lagers in the way of faint corn, light, sweet malts; and very, very faint hop presence. I found the mouthfeel to be very similar to a soda, but perhaps lighter and less coating. The flavor was very light over the palate, suggesting mostly corn and a mordant, rusty character. The combination of these elements did not enhance its drinkability."
"Drinkability- Goes down easy and doesnt fill you up with hoppiness or wheaty flavors. Light and only memorable for its lack of anything but carbonation."
"In conclusion I belive this beer lies in the bottom 10% of all beer, one above LaCrosse Lager and one below Milwaukees Best Ice. It's cheap, but its not undrinkable. After 2 or 3 they do start to taste fine, with 5.9% alcohol it's not the worst I've had. I think it's still better than Bud Light."
"Don't smell this beer. Seriously, don't do it. I don't care how tough you think you are, you won't be able to handle it. Get this beer ice cold in the freezer, then drink it. This has to be the worst smelling beer ever, and I've had alot of bad beers. I have no idea what it looks like because drinking it outside of its ""home"" is just asking for trouble. Based on what I have typed so far, you'll be surprised to know I think it tastes pretty good. I enjoy the high carbonation, but that decreases exponentially as the beer warms. Speaking of warming, you don't want to let that happen. Adjust your drinking speed accordingly. This is a 5.9% mass produced cheap ice beer. You wanna get drunk? Buy alot of this beer and drink it fast."
"The alcohol seems a little high, actually, for the style. Normally watery brews like this would make a good thirst quencher, if it were down in the low-mid ABV 4%s. I guess ice is meant to imply extra rice, for alcohol boost with no flavor added. I STILL THINK THERE IS TOO MUCH ALCOHOL FOR SO LITTLE FLAVOR."
"Fizzy and watery, though also has just a smidge of creaminess. This beer gets old fast. It's really a poor drink, even compared to the standard college-kid fare. This beer was made to get as drunk as possible as fast as possible ... little else."
"Poured a very pale , clear yellow , with some big fizz rising to thin ring of bubbles. Smell is of thin craker malt , slight pink fruity character , adjunct , and a hint of metal. Very light bodied , some slight grain and more hints at a fruity character. Crisp and fairly unobtrusive , i thought it went down rather easy , which is just what i want when i pay 6 dollars for a 12 pack. Nothing to harsh , just not much there besides the slight added alcohol from being ice brewed."
"Ok, here we go, I think we may have hit bottom. I really I had never even had this one before this, but figured I should try the cheapest beer I could find. Poured the palest and clearest yellow imaginable, big fizzy white head faded immediatly to leave just really nothing. Lots of chains of bubbles littered throughout, but this was just soo damn clear. Smell did not exist, at least I couldn't smell one, don't know if that is good or bad in this case, so thats really all I can comment on. Taste again was non existent, maybe a slight taste of corn or grain, but really I was dumbfounded as there was really no taste. Was slick, smooth going down. Tasted like ice cold water and I could see why people drink so much, they are trying to find the taste!"
"Overall: If your MO is a cheap buzz, this one will do it. A four pack of 16 oz cans is essentially 64 oz. of 5.9% swill for 3 bucks. Its not terrible (definitely had much worse), but it really has no redeeming qualities. Avoid."
"Like most beers of this style, refreshing when ice cold, disgusting as they warm."
"Overall, it taste like squeezing the sweat from one's overall's after a long day of manure shoveling."
"Ok beer but not one of my personal favorites. Decent golden color with a white head, rather lacy. Not much of a smell with a strong malty and yet kind of watery taste. Similiar to natural light witha watery feel. Will drink if only one available all for the love of beer."
"cheers to up-and-coming Mug Day champs!"
"Drinkability was ok, good for the style. MK"
"Not bad for a very cheap ""ice"" beer. Maybe being within 3 weeks of the born on date had something to do with it."
"Avoid."
"Poured into a Chimay glass....just kidding. Straight outta the can. I even left it in the poke. This beer reminds me of camping when I was younger. A decent beer when the time is right. Around a campfire this beer hits the spot. At the Taproom, I would need a better beer though. But at a buck 'o nine for a double duece I can live with this. Overall a drinkable beer."
"Natural Ice pours a light straw color with a fluffy white head from a sixteen ounce can. The aroma is very mild, but consists of corn/adjuncts. Tastes fairly nasty, adjunct predominates. Even as far as macros are concerned, this one is fairly bad. Definitely should be avoided."
"D: Not the worst macro I've had, but there are much better beers out there."
"Appearance: Golden clear white quickly dissipating head leaves no lacing left on the glass. Aroma: Cereal grains corn and rice adjunct ridden mass produced beer. Taste: Off adjunct flavor light sweetness no hops evident not real good. Mouthfeel: Light bodied over carbonated fizzy yellow beer. Drinkability: Not the beer I would drink avidly."
"Drinkability - For purpose of taste - undrinkable. I would avoid this for beer pong as well."
"When 24 beers just don't cut it. This is an extremely cheap beer to go along with any college or high school party. When people are just out to get really smashed and care more about the drinking games then the actual taste, then this is a beer to go along with. I don't really want to review the taste becuase thats not what this beer is made for."
"I once got a keg this beer for party. Yea whatever...I'm a poor college student. I guess every dog has its day. Because everyone drinking there probably assumed out of habit it was a light beer, the higher alcohol content really seemed to be catching up on people. It was a rollicking good time until people started dropping like flies. Let's just say that cleaning the floor after everyone left was not a fun job!"
"This beer surprised me that it actually wasn't a completely pale beer. It was a light brown. Minimal head that goes away QUICK. The smell is kinda like malt liqour kinda like crap-beer. KINDA bad. The taste is resembles beer but it's so strange how it swings around from decent to kinda gross. There's this bitter slightly sludgy thing going on. It's still surprisingly drinkable I thought it'd be awful cause it was from the 'Natural' family (no pun intended.) The mouthfeel was sorta sticky and watery. It was ok. This beer is very drinkable if you're in the mood to get f-ed up and is still on the kinda awful side. Definitely better than Natty Light but that's not saying much. PABST all the way - it's cheaper and better."
"This was way better than I anticipated. An interesting flavor and nice mouth feel make this a pretty good beer for the price. However, I dont think Ill actively seek this one out in cans."
"Big bad ass pimp daddy 40oz for $1.75 at Citgo. Poured pale yellow with lots of carbonation and a fuzzy head that disappeared quickly. Smells sweet, flavor is a weak sweet corn flavor that vanishes rapidly. Mouthfeel like water. It's easy to drink in that water is easy to drink too. There really isn't much to this stuff except a bit of a beer buzz. Not impressed but it's what I expected."
"Earning karma the hard way. Still, this wasnt bad."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce aluminum can, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Verdict- Drinkable while it's cold, fear it when it's not."
"This offers a little more than its light brother. Better color and carbonation, it actually resembles beer a bit. Aroma is rice and some residual sugars. Taste has a bit of rice flavor along with a slight corny adjunct. Alcohol creeps in there and finish lingers with a nasty residual sugary sweetness. Drink ice cold and fast, that's the only way to get through it. Seriously, spend the extra dollar or whatever and get a better ice macro if that's what you're in the mood for."
"Drinkability: Theres no reason to drink this swill well unless you were poor and really thirsty since its cheaper than bottled water."
"Thanks again Dad, you can sure pick them out. Drank straight from the can. I'd guess that is it crystal clear, light yellow, has the carbonation of coca-cola along with the fizziness. Aromas are of any type of grain other than barley malt. My guess; rice. Quite astringent and grainy to the taste. Metalic and harshly bittered (old hops?) All flavors are muted except for the bad ones. Alcohol and carbonation basically chokes my toung. It's a typical smash-the-can-on-your-forehead beer. If you are going to drink a bad beer, might as well save a few cents while doing it."
"I give it an A for teens and young adults trying to have a good time but if your a beer conuisser( however you spell that word) You wont enjoy it very much."
"Drinkability - This beer moved up a few notches when I poured it in a pilsner glass. If you are drinking this out of the can, please consider the children. I wouldn't pick this stuff if I had another choice, but it's not undrinkable."
"And as others have said DRINK THIS COLD! or you will be sorry."
"At my local bottleshop, this stuff costs less than $12 for 24 of 'em! A beer at that price could be far, far worse in taste and after-effects. I find, in this price range, a lack of taste is prefered to a strongly offensive ""flavor"". The taste here is quite inoffensive and the 5.9% will get you where you want to go, which is always nice. So I would say if you're on a budget, or saving for something, give it a go. Anyone who thinks this beer is as bad as it gets should drink a case of Milwaukee's Best Ice. Natural Ice is a great beer for someone who's as broke as a ""Bum", but doesn't wish to wake up feeling like one! (See Milwaukee's Best Ice). Take it easy boys and girls!"
"Pale straw color with a small fizzy head. No aroma really just a little bit of grain. Lots of carbonation and thin bodied. Not much of a taste either. Some faint malts and grains. No hops presesnt just a little bit of alcohol. Well this beer is good for only one thing and that is to get drunk cheap. No real big flavor very easy drinking as long as it stays cold."
"May be slightly more drinkable than it's light counterpart. This is good, in terms of both ABV and the ability to slam a lot. This is usually bought for large parties, so it serves it's purpose quite well. It has next to no smell: only alcohol really comes through. More flavor probably comes from the carbonation, if that's possible. Really nothing more to say. Just don't think about it and grab another."
"Tasted: 01/30/05"
"This poor beer has been beaten up so by so many other reviewers i hate to ass insult to injury but this beer deserves a 1. well it deserves a zero but one is the lowest it goes, and 1 does have awful next to it, so it's the best i can do. This beer has a taste and it isnt good. cheap malt and hops combine for a distinct and regretable trip to beer hell. Putred comes to mind, horrable also. But in the words of Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank ""It's bad, it's just bad"" Why drink this??? The only upside to this is that your not paying a lot for your bad beer, like paying $4 for some guy to beat you with a baseball bat; it sucked but at least it was cheap?"
"Looks like I differ from the collective wisdom of the BA community on the relative merits of these two, but at least we (almost) all agree on one thing. Bud Ice and Natural Ice are both bad beer."
"Taste? Paper and corn, but *barely* any of either. This tastes a heck of a lot less offensive than some ""premium"" macros because it doesn't taste much at all. Kudos to AB for brewing something so close to the taste of nothing/water and having 5.9% alcohol at the same time. That must take remarkable skill. Makes me wonder if Natty Light has absolutely no taste whatsoever. I haven't had a Natty Light in so long that I can't remember, but it very well could. I suppose if you want a cheap buzz without tasting anything you should drink some of this. I assure you that your taste buds won't be offended."
"Overall-Natty Ice is brewed for two things, buying cheap and getting wasted quick. In this role it is very good as it is a smooth ice beer that is light on your wallet. On the BA scale one can't expect it to go high though as it is not a beer to rave about drinking, save this for the night out with the frat boys and not for your next home party."
"The beer after its pour from the 12-ounce can sets in the glass a pale gold with a modest frothy white head that leaves a film of lace to cover the glass. Nose is all malt, fresh and crisp, start somewhat sweet and the top thin. Finish is moderately acidic, the hops light and the aftertaste dry."
"Like others before me have stated, the smell is very bad. The unfortunate thing about it is that a lot of Natty Ice drinkers have to endure the smell of it coming back up. The taste is less than desirable, althogh I have personally had much, much worse. The beer is drinkable in the sense that you can drink them at a party with the intention of being drunk. I wouldn't recommend sitting down to enjoy one, especially with a meal. Overall it is good for what it is, a cheap beer that appeals mainly to poor college students looking for a good time."
"I can't help but notice most of the reviews of this beer that are favorable are done by members with less than 10 reviews. Anyhow, just an observation. Pours out to a ""dead head"" with little carbonation. Unique smell reminds me of a steel plant ( ie LOTS of sulfer). The only high point of the beer is the 5.9% alcohol content. I would recommend most anything else, but again, I can't say this is the worst beer i have ever had. I'd rather have a Natty Light. Try it if you dare."
"Well, at least this has 5.9% alcohol. Stone Cold used to drink Natural Light."
"Disclaimer: said reviewer is not responsible for his actions once he purchases a case of this lets get wasted for $9.99 el-potent ""beverage."" When said reviewer purchases this ""beverage", said reviewer is having a mental breakdown in the form of getting fired from a job, failing an exam, car breaking down on Friday in the middle of an intersection during rush hour, etc, etc."
"served in the 22 oz can..""naturally"". The aroma , that which I can make out consisits of corn syrup..and old ice cubes the ones that fall out of the ice box in the freezer and lie under the hamburger for a few months. appearance ..well it isnt the worst looking ""macro""..but its sub par pale yellow pee colour none-the-less. I drank this cold, very cold..but after the quite acceptable first gulp..I can taste all sorts of weird metallic/chemical flavours..this would be horrific at room temp. Its bubbly on the palate. While not THE worst I have tasted it has to be in my bottom 20..avoid."
"all other things being equal...this natty is nasty."
"The color was a pale yellow, not much to look at really. The head was about an average head for a beer of this high calibar. I cought a metalic smell which then lead to a metalic taste. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty smooth. I coundn't pinpoint what exactly else I was tasting, I did get a slight skunk, but there was something else. I didn't like it so much."
"--Joey"
"I just finished my Natty Ice. I'm feeling alright, but left with a nasty taste in my mouth. Not very satisfying. My overall conclusion is that this beer is made for high school kids, poor college students and people looking for a cheap buzz.. Good if you like drinking out of bottles, don't mind a generic crappy flavor, enjoy spending under 4 bucks, and like getting all banged up."
"It's easy to make a beer that lacks redeeming qualities, but making a beer with almost no qualities at all? That takes skill. I'm not even sure I drank this. How would I know? I don't. Kudos, A-B."
"Good old Natty! Whenever I cannot pay the price for my favorite Stone or Rogue beer, or if I'm going to a college party, Natty is the way to go. Over the years of drunken parties and good times, I have aquired a tollerance for Natty. It looks like shit, tastes like shit, and if you drink too many without hydrating yourself afterwards, you'll feel like shit. But in a pinch, it gets the job done and gets it done well."
"Drinkability: When out in the deep, dark woods after a day of hiking, Natural Ice has the high water content your body craves and the high alcohol content your minds needs."
"Ya know, I cant say I was am the biggest fan of Anheuiser Busch products. But lemme tell ya sumthin, the twin sister of Natural Light, that of course being Natural Ice, really ain't too damn bad. Granted a I drank a few of these after a whole bottle of Stoli Vanilla Vodka, and a few Miller Genuine Drafts, but it still wasn't too bad. I give this beer a thumbs up, and the can is pretty too."
"There was nothing absolutely disgusting in the can, so I wouldnt feel right about oneing it. But, this is definitely a beer to put on your piss list."
"One word describes this beer............Awful. This brew can typically be found at frat parties and other young social events where cheap beer with a high alchohol content is required. At fist pour it appears a very light yellow and has a quick fading head with just about no lacing to it. The aroma is quite skunky in my opinion, and as far as flavor goes it was like drinking budweiser on crack. It is clear to me that this beer was produced with college kids in mind. I highly recommend never allowing this beer anywhere near your lips. probably a cheap one to use for beer batter though."
"The head pour was large white and frothy with small-medium bubbles that fully diminished. There was very little carbonation with this beer. The lacing was sparse and the body was clear and the hue was yellow. The flavor was slightly sweet and bitterness was observed. The mouthfeel was light, watery and oily."
"Highly recommended."
"I can't say this is a good beer, but I can't say this is a bad beer, either. I associate it with the days when I was in college and we lived on stuff like this. Would I ever order it anywhere...hell no. Would I innocently slip out of the bar with a 12-pack? Hell yes. The only thing I should warn about is the hangover...this beer can and will kick you in the groin and smash your head between two cymbals. Be careful. Enjoy it...it is a guilty pleasure."
"A crystal clear straw-gold body reveals hundreds of fast-rising standard-sized bubbles racing to support a dwindling head of creamy white foam. It does maintain a thin surface covering, however, and leaves some very slight lace momentarily following each sip. The nose is clean with a light touch of apple. The body is medium/light and it's nicely crisp on the tongue due to its fine, effervescent carbonation. Sweet adjunct-laden malt dominates the flavor; balanced by an underlying bitterness that's accentuated by it's crisp carbonation. It finishes semi-dry with some residual sticky malt about the mouth. Well made, but not very interesting."
"I'm reviewing nat ice based on other ICE beers so score is higher than it would be overall. NI is the cheapest of the beers in the Anheiser busch family. With that said this is a high school beer and that is about it. With 5.9% alcohol and at 9 dollars a case this is a broke mans dream beer. Suprisingly the taste is very comparison to all other ice beers I have tried. Even better than bud ice. The beer is very drinkable compared to all other ICE beers on the market, however if you never try this beer you haven't missed anything. The only time to drink this beer is if you are broke and it is hot outside and you have no other options."
"How can a beer with so much carbonation have no head? Their are bubbles, I can see them, I can even hear them, but their is no head. I don't know what it is, but lately I've been bombarded with AB products. I do not like them. This is sort of a weak ice beer. Poured piss yellow and fizzy, no head. Smelled of cream corn and chemicals. If you sniff hard enough, some malt is detected, but that may be your imagination trying to let you down easy that this is another bad beer. Tasted bland. Something artificially sweet about it. Aspartame? Very carbonated. Reminded me of drinking a soda that has just been shook up, beat up, kicked and dropped. After the one can, my tongue was dead from the overcarbonation. Do not drink. Under any circumstances. If your in the desert and dying from dehydration, you would rather die than drink this."
"If you like getting drunk and have no money and love beer, drink this. If you have no money and like getting drunk but are indiffrent to beer,go for the bankers club or something."
"The only thing this has going for it is that it will get you rocking in a short while, but the next day is going to be rough, so beware of the nasty ice"
"Not a good beer at all. If this site had zeros, this would be getting a lot of them. It still is better than the bull though. I guess it is a little better in the bottle, because it doesn't have that metallic taste to it. Even though the bottle doesn't claim it, this is a light beer. And there is something about a light beer with a higher alcohol content in it that is just way too weird and nasty for me. This tastes just like water, with rubbing alcohol, and a hint of malt. There was no head that I could see, so maybe I got a flat one. Either way, it really shouldn't matter with this one."
"If you are a college kid and you have no money left in your bank account, this is the beer for you. It is only five bucks per twelve pack and it will most definitely get you drunk. The only problem is drinking it. I would suggest chugging it while it is cold, but be careful, because they don't call it ""natty death"" for nothing."
"This is a ""party beer"". Very cheap with lots of alcohol (5.9%). Not bad for an Anheiser Busch macro. Taste is a lot like Bud, a little dryer perhaps, with a twang of alcohol at the end. Burns going down. Not the best, but decent for a cheap beer."
"Friend offer me this beer. The smell was nothing to speak of and the color was a light yellow. The flavor was of flavored water with a sprinkle of hops? What else can I say but it tasted like Wessil Piss, and that's was the end of that friend!"
" Not good!"
"For the love of god, how did I rate this so high?  Pours out to a slightly, darker yellow than the usual suspects in this style.  Taste is slightly sweet, with a graininess that gives way to a slight alcohol taste on the finish.  Yes, I know its Natty Ice, but it was drinkable.  It actually tasted better than most AB products to tell the truth.  While still a watered down beer, it had more taste than a Bud.  Now, where is my Two-Hearted Ale?  I must've sat it down here somewhere..."
"My suggestion?  Stay away, except if you're broke and need a buzz.  BTW, I managed to down this stuff when I poured it into a glass.  Out of the can, this stuff is plain awfulness."
"Drink water or go thirsty before drinking ""Natty Ice""."
"When this ice beer is real fresh and cold, and the plastic taste of the can hasn't had time to migrate into the beer, the smell and taste of this ice beer improves. Not that the taste is still anything to write home about, or how it paints the palate with strokes of delight or rolls around on the tongue... the plastic taste of the can just gets in the way of a rather bland ice beer made from rice. I think that if Natural Ice came in brown glass 40s, there would be more number threes in the review."
"You only need Nattie Ice if you want to get hammered. There is no other reason to drink it. This stuff will make you lose your memory and turn you into a very stupid individual. So if you choose to buy it, you are in for a fun night and a rough morning."
"There are bonus-strength lagers out there that get their character from malt and hops. This is NOT one of them. That fermented corn taste that the pigs down at Walters' farm can't get enough of is here, loud and proud. A beer best served ice cold, and preferably to someone else."
"Notes: Dubbed as A&B’s sub premium ice brew, this brew is aimed for one thing, to get a buzz and quick. Unfortunately they don’t tell you this and then the beer warms up to the point of no return R.I.P. Hey what do you expect for a $1.25 A&B product? Best served ice cold in a frozen mug."
"Another Anheuser-Busch, Inc. piss poor beer.  Malted water with high carbonation and a fairly high alcohol content.  Drink it only because you need a pain killer and not because it taste good."
