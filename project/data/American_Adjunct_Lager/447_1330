Stroh's obviously isn't the greatest beer I've ever had, but as far as cheap adjunct lagers go, you could do worse - far, far worse. This is a serviceable macro brew that will get the job done; I could pound these all night, and - thanks to the relatively clean taste and lack of cloying adjunct notes - never get tired of it. One of 3 or 4 'value brand' lagers available in the Ontario market that I would consider worth re-purchasing. Stroh's floats amongst the rest of the cream of the crap, and I hold it in roughly similar esteem as the likes of PBR, Miller High Life, and other 'upper tier' domestic US macros.

Not much visible carbonation, glass like clarity. Boring looks. Smell is grainy, a faint hops nose, subtle metallic aroma, wet grass.

Granted it's no IPA (I'm no noob, I'm a certified hop head) but I swear to you, there is an essence of hop oil in this beer; certainly more than can be found in High Life. Oddly enough, I find it to be most present when imbibed directly from the can and not so much from the bottle or glass.

I have to say I enjoy the Schlitz better for one reason, after a couple of beers the Stroh's was heavier on the stomach.

The taste is, again, malty with some crisp hops bitterness providing balance but never usurping the malt. Thankfully (and surprisingly) the adjunct flavors which dominate other macroswill are absent here. A great value, I'd choose this over other macroswill in a heartbeat, on a hot day or any other.

In a town where Natty and Bud rule, it's good to finally have a change of pave from the usual swill. It's apperance wasn;t that amazing and neither was the smell.
