Have to give the big brews credit, they know how to make their pseudo-craft brews look. Strongly fruity and rather sweet aroma has a malty undertone. Flavor, though, is quite good - malty, fruity and hoppy, rather toothsome. Body is about average, though there is decent fizz. Coors, you’re not fooling anybody - but your Batch 19 is at least superior to your other stuff. Gotta give the devil his due. ;)","Cyberkedi","Mar 14, 2015"

It pours brilliant gold with a pure white 1” foam cap with masses of tiny bubbles that produce excellent lace. Has a clean, light malt, spicy herbal nose with a hint of earthiness and a light touch of grainy spice. The initial palate suggests light fruit – hints of apple but this soon hides behind rich grain and light malt with a crisp bitter emphasis on the finish with a faint lingering hint of anise from the hops. Medium light body and above average carbonation – seltzery but surprisingly drinkable.","pat61","Jan 05, 2015"

Coors did a good job with this one, and I'm not quite sure what "pre-Prohibition" is completely about, but it's a decent beer nonetheless. Flavor is there, and in spades. Its just not my favorite style of flavor. This is a perfect example of me not liking a beer but respecting it for what it is about and the flavors it presents. This ain't your typical AAL. This is more along the lines of a copper lager or a harsh amber red.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Aug 27, 2014"

The aroma is of different sweet hops and malts. Taste of like a corn sweetness followed up by gentle hops. Overall very enjoyable. If this is what some beer tasted like before Prohibition in 1919, then fire up the ol' DeLorean and lets take a trip 'Back to the Future" to taste some more early-type brews.

The taste also gets more complex as the beer warms.. I recommend drinking this only slightly cold.. or take it out of the fridge and let it set for 10 mins or so...

Within the caveat that everybody likes something, most microbrew stuff is bilge. I like good beer whether it's a global brand or one cooked up in the neighbor's garage. If you're in the camp that says the big brewers can't possibly make great beer, well, as the saying goes, "no man is as blind as one who refuses to see" or taste in this case. The big brewers weren't always big which is still irrelevant. But, prior to prohibition they all had great recipes. Every once in a while they bring'em back and batch 19 is one of them. AB has done it in the past as well. So, if you're open-minded, not quite ready for an IPA but like a complex, hoppy flavored lager that will go great on a hot or cold day, give this a shot.","OregonDuckinTexas","Jan 14, 2014"

Aroma has a lingering citric, grassy hop nose amongst a clean mix of grain perceived sweetness, let the hops shine in this supposed recipe pre-prohibition 1919 lager. Definitely a nice smelling mix of barley, corn husks, cereal grains with hop appreciation showing some love from the bottles label it says strisselspalt and hersbrucker German hops. The alcohol weighs in pretty heavy in the flavor at first but settles into a mix of semi sweet bready grains and bitter green hoppy citrus rind and grassy accents. Not the best American brewed lager lingering flavors that don't work are bitterness from an almost plastic or burnt bread crust carbon flavor that I'm just not appreciating. Overall mouthfeel has ample carbonation but is a bit harsh with those lingering qualities that stick with you between sips, not a beer I'm looking to consume on a regular basis.","WVbeergeek","Apr 19, 2013"

I typically end up ordering a Sam Adams but am not happy with the heaviness and sweetness. Likewise, as a go-to option at home when I want a good beer without things getting complicated, I want something much more than a mainstream pale ale but not something extremely craft. Something complex but mainstream. Batch 19 seems to be the right beer for this niche, as it is probably the most consistent high-quality pour beer out of a mainstream production.

Nose expresses corn adjuncts, a hint of sweetness and a light, skunky/sour mash quality. Taste consistent with nose - malt profile is almost non-existent. There's a slight grassiness to this, as well as some earthy hoppiness, eventually yielding to the skunky/sour mash character towards the back. Mouthfeel is light in body, with an assertive carbonation and a semi-crisp finish. Overall, a pretty solid American Adjunct Lager. I had this on-tap a few months back and thought it was quite tasty (didn't realize it was a Coors product). That said, given the bottle dating, I feel like this beer went a little downhill.

The flavor is of bread with those grassy hops that add some nice bitterness and balance to this beer. I also get some of those citrus hop flavors and not as much corn flavor one would find in regular Coors. This is to be expected because there is much less corn used in this recipe than in regular Coors. There is some caramel sweetness that opens up during consumption as well. The body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. The beer finishes crisp and the drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer. The big boys aren't sitting tight in this market and this throwback recipe is an example of what they are capable of brewing.","acevenom","Jan 09, 2013"

The feel is also nice, as it's smooth and easy drinking. At 5.5% ABV and without any offensive flavors or smells, this is a VERY good choice if you have the option ... especially for the price.

Surprisingly heavy amount of lacing is left down the glass. Aroma of sweet malt and hay/grass- like hop qualities. Nice clean flavor that is just a little too sweet for me. The hops are a little more assertive than todays AALs, but it is not enough to balance the sweetness. The hops give some grassy flavor. Good body and carbonation. Enjoyable lighter beer texture with lively carbonation. Nice that Coors is branching out a bit and offering an interesting lager. Maybe not enough to warrant another purchase from me, but should appeal to other pale lager drinkers.","morimech","Dec 16, 2012"

3.7,11.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Sampled on June 29, 2012 at The Tap Sports Bar and Grill in Belmont, New Hampshire. The pour is golden to pale yellow with a small white fizzy head that settles down. The aroma highlights include pale malts, a slight hop note that is both clean and crisp, but little in the way of adjuncts. The body is light to medium. The taste was of grain malts with moderate bitterness at the end. Compared to other adjuncts this was an improvement. I had to drive a ways to find it in my area. It tasted better than other standard Coors products but was nothing extraordinary.","puboflyons","Jun 29, 2012"

3.06,-8.1,4,3,3,3,3,"The beer pours brilliantly clear deep golden bordering on copper color with a thick white head that diminished to a thin skim yet left bits of lacing. A good looking beer. The aroma is moderate sweet malt, rather grainy, perhaps a hint of grassy hops. The flavor is medium-high grainy malt, a bit of spicy hop flavor and the finish is dry and crisp, with just a bit of sweet malt reemerging. The body is medium-light with medium-high carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer, in the pre-prohibition style I've had better, but worth picking up at least a single.","uwmgdman","Jun 09, 2012"

Aroma is subtle grain - mellow. Taste is malty with a decent hops tinge, and a bit of a peppery overtone. I don't know if they used adjuncts in this beer, I don't taste them but if they did, they were used very well.

Well balanced without a hint of skunk that is so prevalent with the style. Finishes clean and crisp. Good. Lighter bodied but not watered down, nice, easy to drink.

Batch 19 pours a golden-amber with a slim, light off-white head and a decent amount of lacing. A slight, yet malty nose is joined with somewhat surprising citrus hop notes. a semi-sweet malt profile meets the pallet before being balanced out by slightly spicy hop characteristics, all before leading into a crisp, clean finish. The beer is medium body with a lighter amount of carbonation. Thankfully Prohibition didn't last, but we believe Batch 19 will!","phishsihq","Jan 20, 2012"

Served in a standard pint glass. Muted yellow color to the body. Decent amount of carbonation, with a small head at first. Smell was nothing special, sot of like all other macros. Flavor was a bit better than I was expecting. Pretty mellow taste, but it has some nice notes of malt. Plus the mouthfeel was somewhat thicker than other examples from the BMC catalog. Not a bad beer; I'd order one again if the choices were limited. Worth a shot to try once.","morebeergood","Aug 01, 2011"
3.5,5.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Described as a pre-prohibition lager, which I used to think meant "all malt" but now realize means "somewhat hoppy adjunct." And that's exactly what it was: thin pour, full body, dry and lightly bitter American-style lager. Strong cereal grains, almost like eating a bowl of barley, and then some rounded, bitter, east coast hops.","mynie","Jul 29, 2011"

3.43,3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Never thought I'd actually see this brew out by me, but then Serendipity came along and randomly dropped it in my lap at a local watering hole. It pours a clear russet-ish straw (this may have just been the weird light in the bar...) topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises light wheat, light corn (straight from the cob, baby), and mineral water. The taste brings things up a bit, with notes of wheat, caramelized pilsner malts (damn homebrewing...), flowers, light grass, and a twinge of grapefruit peel in the back. The body is a hefty-leaning light, with a light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, I think this is the best Coors product I've had in a long time. I really hope it stays on in the area, so that I can have a nice alternative to the usual BMC nonsense where craft is not abundant. Not all that bad, I gotta tell ya.","TMoney2591","May 15, 2011"
4,20.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a standard one finger head, the head is almost pure white, maybe slightly off white, it is puttering away fairly fast, it's not a bad head though, from what I can tell from the head that has stuck around, it's good, decent lacing. The body is traditionally darker than a standard lager, it's a very unique color, almost a 50/50 mix between golden/yellow, and amber, I've never seen a beer like this before. For the most part this beer is transparent, but it is dark enough that it objects your view just a little bit. Overall....the head went away fast, but it left good foam and lacing, the body is mostly see through, but it's a really unique color, so overall the look is confusing - unique, bad in some areas, good in others, final conclusion - it looks good. Very good aroma, perfect balance between hops and malts, at least in terms of lagers. The malts come through first, and they are very sweet smelling, but not an offensive or overpowering sweet, it smells just right. Then the hops come through the smell a little bit in the second half of the aroma. Overall I would like the smell to be bigger, but I can't ask much more from Coors and an adjunct lager. Considering everything - this smells really good. Maybe a tiny bit of cheap adjuncts, but not really at all, maybe some honey in here in fact, which would be very nice, anyways, I'm ranting, like I said - good smell. The taste is very interesting, the first thing I get is malt, sweet malt, but like I thought on the smell, it's not offensive, it works with the beer very well. Then comes a nice hop bite, very small, but very noticeable as well. I do notice a nice honey flavor appearing in a few different places in this beer. Overall it's a very smooth, drinkable, tasty beer. The flavor isn't huge, but it really shouldn't be for the style. Overall it tastes really good. Mouthfeel is very good for a lager, not too much carbonation, it's just right, and it's not too watery in the mouth. Drinkability is very high, cause it's light and very tasty. Overall there really isn't anything wrong with this beer, is it outstanding? No, but it's very tasty and pretty dang good. I can't believe how high I rated this beer, considering it's made by Coors, but by gosh it deserves it.","MaltsOfGlory","May 13, 2011"
