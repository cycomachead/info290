So I left he last third to warm up. For once I think I was wrong. I think it was actually a good bit better colder. The taste is so strong it doesn't get wiped out by the cold.","BrownNut","Apr 13, 2013"
4.1,6.8,4,4.5,4,3.75,4,"Poured into a pint glass, the beer was a cloudy color with a soft white head. The head dissolved rather quickly to leave a white lacing around the sides of the glass. In the aroma, one immediately notices the juniper, making me think of a gin and tonic. At the same time, the nose also reveals a strong dose of honey that puts a sweet edge on the juniper. This is not like the sahtis I have tasted in the past. On the initial taste, honey and biscuit come to the forefront with the bubbles quickly brushing this away. A mild sense of fruitiness is detectable. As the carbonation mellows the juniper sours the honey in the aftertaste. In the bigger sense, the carbonation might be too aggressive as the sweetness fades too quickly into the sour. At the same time, the sour of the juniper at the end is the best aspect of the taste. I am unable to saw that this is my favorite sahti, but it is among the best.","JohnnyHopps","Jan 27, 2013"

Pours very cloudy reddish orange color with a small 1 finger off white head with good retention, that reduces to a very thin cap. Some light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big honey, grape, pepper, molasses, raisin, herbal, cherry, floral, citrus peel, and yeast spices. Beautiful aromas here with great balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, honey, molasses, pepper, grape, raisin, earth, herbal, floral, citrus peel, banana, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of caramel, molasses, herbal, floral, grape, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a while. Great balance of flavors; with absolutely no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very nice creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel. Alcohol is very well hidden at 11%, with only a warming after the finish noticed; definitely a slow sipper. Overall this is a great sahti! It felt a bit unbalanced at first; but it smoothed out as it reached room temperature. Really well done.","superspak","Apr 24, 2012"

Nose has some honey, cider-y qualities, notes of alcohol as well. Some herbal suggestions likely provided by the Juniper twigs and artemis maritima (not like I know what they actually smell like, although the bottle indicates they were employed in this brew...). Taste has bigger notes of honey, and spcing. Some alcohol, and is less cider-y than the nose suggested. Berries come in midway through the sip, and work with some light grape-y notes as well. Sweet all around with some brown sugar as well. Flavour is what I've been able to identify as suitable to the style, but doesn't feel as 'pungent' as DFH's Sah'tea. Slightly sticky feel, pretty full in the mouth. Some alcohol comes in at the end, but not at a strength like the 11% dictates.","liamt07","Aug 31, 2011"

The smell of the beer has a lot of things going on here. The Juniper is actually picked up on the nose which I like a lot, The other herbs in the mix really work well together to benefits this beer. The taste has a nice sweetness from the honey upfront which is followed up right away by many different herbal flavors. The mouthfeel of this beer is a slick and a little on the heavier side.

The taste also exhibits some nice honey notes up front, followed by a bitter juniper woodiness. The honey comes back and moderates the juniper a bit, but I don't get the feeling that the flavors are all that well integrated. Smooth and a bit waxy in the mouth, this seems a touch too thin to me. A decent Sahti, but I would have liked to have seen a more harmonious whole here.","Georgiabeer","Beers"

Golden yellow with a white head. The smell is crazy--honey, honey, HONEY. I've not had a mead with as much honey aroma as this! No juniper or pine in there as I expected given the description of the style, but no fusel or other alcohol flavors either. At 11% this beer is ridiculously quaffable. The only drawback is the honey sweetness. Not sure I'd want a full bottle to myself, but I enjoyed my sample with some creamy goat cheese, which made the beer all the more enjoyable. I'd recommend this paired with with some rich creamy cheese or other fatty food to play off the sweetness. Interesting in its own right, I'd love to try some other sahtis to see how they compare.","dnrobert24","0"

Yeah, just honey-- really strong. It's quite light bodied and very lively with a very clean, dry finish. It has lots of honey flavor. It's lightly sweet and quite bitter. It tastes estery, like a Belgian ale, and a little soapy. The juniper is pretty strong at the finish. There's a hot alcohol aftertaste.

The brewer uses Belgian yeasts, which are no surprise given the slight prickliness on the tongue, and there is juniper and heather used as well. There is very little hop in this beer and it is a strong and close relative to a Belgian Tripel or Quad. There is a slight tanginess to the beer, maybe a touch of tangerine. It is a very good sipping beer, with lots of complexity. There is some warming ABV on the back end but zero throaty burn and no real aftertaste or aftershock with this one. The rye and wheat add to the pricklishness without detracting from the sweetness. You can taste a hint of some rye dryness on the back end, but it really buried underneath lots of sweeter malts.

Mouthfeel starts round trending toward a bit of astringency, with that herbal/hops mixture lingering in the aftertaste. There's a bit of a gin kind of thing coming up in the burps. The big surprise for me drinking this was the freshness and presence of the honey itself- usually it's been metabolised by the yeast and its contribution to the mix is a bit of alcohol and a lot of white wine style dryness. This isn't for everyone but it is interesting and it does grow on one. Now that hops are a little over and sourness is the next big thing, maybe it'll be weird botanical infusions waiting in the wings.

The taste starts off quite herbal; talcum powder, basil, rye, light juniper and transfers into a more floral/fruity flavor; banana, lavendar/wild flowers, apples and lemon. All of this is wrapped up with a raw honey sweetness. The feel is quite thick but is heavily carbonated so it drinks fine; sweet overall, a touch sticky. A very unique brew. I appreciate the herbal/floral characteristics, quite flavorful. The brew is a tad thick and sticky.

4.07,6,4,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Taste is pretty similar to the smell. Lots of juniper pines and honey, but with a nice touch of dried fruits.","Bananaman","Mar 17, 2009"
2.98,-22.4,4,3.5,3,3,2,"Rich foam, which collapses pretty quickly, At first the smell is much like a Belgian spontaneously fermented beer, but after a while the honey aroma dominates. The taste is rather sweet, again with honey. Reminds me of meed, but even if there is no hops in this beer, there is a slight bitterness, which I guess comes from the juniper berries. Rather interesting beer, and I am an experience richer for trying it. But I'll probably not drink it again.","kittylitter","Mar 16, 2009"
3.99,3.9,3,4,4,4.5,4,"D: This is a not your average kind of beer. It's definitely interesting and to a great extent quite good, so it's a rather successful experiment. It is well composed and nothing seems really out of place. However, I think I would have liked the alcohol to be somewhat less prominent, and perhaps the honey is a little too much in some sips. Also, I think it would have been nice if both the juniper twigs and sea wormwood they used in the brewing were more noticeable. But all in all, quite tasty, and most definitely interesting.","ricke","Dec 02, 2008"

3.45,-10.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"500 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11%. Deep golden colour, slightly hazy / honeyish, with a big off-white head. Very nice aroma of juniper, heather honey and hops. The mouthfeel is rich, warming and alcoholic. The flavour has loads of honey (too much) and malty sweetness. Notes of juniper too, very moderate bitterness. Interesting, but too sweet. A fairly nice sipping beer all the same.","Sigmund","0"
