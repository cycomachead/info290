Smell is sour with malt, grain, earth, Brett, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour malt, fruit, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty, refreshing, and quite sour.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 01, 2014"

4.39,2.8,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"very very neat beer here, unlike anything ive encountered before. apparently fermented in an old hollowed out tree trunk? thats the word, and its very cool if its true. the beer ha cloudy but bright, just darker than golden, with a fluffy and .lasting muted white head. lots going on with the nose, from intense pine tree aromas to softer birch syrup and floral notes, its different, almost ancient or medicinal or for some other healing or ceremonial purpose than beer, it just has that vibe. the flavors are even more alive than the nose, with a spruce or pine complex taking the lead, but an interesting wood profile too that isnt oak, its much more musty and less familiar. the yeast is also unconventional, not sure if its brett or not, but it definitely has some funkiness. massive body and carbonation levels makes this extremely strong beer seem like a session ale. its remarkable how much of an afterthought the booze is for me here, its just so interesting i never notice it there at all, although im not sure its particularly well hidden. i love beer that is new to me, that brings something else to the table. that reinvents what we all think we know beer to taste like. this is one of those beers, once in a life time mix of flavors, what a treat!","StonedTrippin","Apr 03, 2014"

4.52,5.9,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is worldclass. Not sure it is a beer that can tickle anyone's fancy, but the use of spruce, fresh wine barrels, hops, and yeast selection make for an effervescent drinking delight. A nice sourness that can please sour heads, juicy citrus hop character that would appeal to hopheads, and spritzy body that can get the attention of cider and champagne drinkers alike. Beware though, as the spruce is definitely upfront and lends an astringent woodsy character not like oak. That is the one detail that could turn some off.","MarcWP","Feb 21, 2014"
