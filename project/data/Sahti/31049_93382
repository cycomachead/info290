4.14,0,,,,,,"Pours a dark brown color. 1/4 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of spruce, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of a Sahti. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of strong spruce, hint of spice, slight sweet malt, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, and feel. The body is simple, but as I have read the categorical description of Sahti, that is sufficient.","Tone","0"
