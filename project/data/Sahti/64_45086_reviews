"O = This beer defied all my expectations.  Heavily spiced and aromatic, sweet and warming, a perfect beer for Christmas time (there's even a reindeer on the bottle).  Too sweet and heavy to be sessionable (not to mention the 9% abv), more of a dessert beer.  HIGHLY recommended."

"Outstanding complexity. Definitely a trading beer."

"Delicious spiced brew. Artfully brewed with excellently balanced ingredients. Sweet, but not cloying, light, nice aftertaste!"

"Hazy straw color.  The nose is sweet , much like a fruity herbal tea.  The two dominant flavors are sweet maltiness and funkiness on the finish."

"Upon my first smell of this beer, I was hesitant if it was going to taste good or not.  The aroma was very malty and typically, I'm not a fan of malty tasting beers.  But upon my first sip, I was pleasantly surprising.  I definitely taste the chai spices and tea.  I don't get much of the juniper.  This beer also feels lighter on the palate than I expected."
""
""
"This was a draught serving,and it's golden color reminded me of a Belgian wit, but the flavors reminded me of a nice Gin.  If you like gin and weissbier seek this out."
""
""
""
"This is a surprisingly good beer in which the chai and juniper balance and complement each other.  This never tastes like gin and the alcohol is totally hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Interesting. Just when I think I've had my last sip I'm drawn back for another. Impressed and well done Sam."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably my favorite from the ancient ales line from Dogfish. Pours a golden yellow with almost a rose hue to it. The smell was full of spice, mint, sage, as well as a ton of clove. The taste was really nice in my opinion. Starts of mild and herby and seems to grow till there is a bite of mint at the end which made for a much more refreshing beer than I had anticipated. Overall I found it quite the enjoyable find."

"O: Damn good! Liberal in the additives, but carefully meted and balanced by one another. Surely not a typical style, but if you have an open mind you will at least be able to appreciate this one (and if not send it to me!)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy, copper color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong juniper, sweet malt, hint of earthy malt, hint of alcohol, cream, hint of rye. Fits the style of a Sahti. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of juniper, sweet malt, grass, earthy malt, rye, biscuit, slight tea, and alcohol. Overall, an interesting brew, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I appreciate Dogfish immensely for what they do; I often love what they do. Here, I appreciate the concept but am underwhelmed by the execution. It's clearly a well-brewed beer and I appreciate every element they've incorporated. I'd like to access the sahti backbone a bit more-- the combination of resiny juniper and intrinsically-strong sweet spices overwhelms the subtlety and renders the beer too complexly sweet, to put it simply. I do stand impressed by the well-cloaked nature of the high ABV, and if you're looking for a sweet alcoholic carbonated iced chai, look not a drop further than here."

"Food match: Take a bottle of this to your local Renaissance fair or medieval themed restaurant (that does BYO) and you will be thick in the action."
"Good stuff and a nice change of pace."
"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 3/11/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep gold color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big juniper, black tea, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, ginger, black pepper, herbal, grass, light banana, light caramel, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big juniper, black tea, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, clove, herbal, light banana, black pepper, grass, light caramel, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of juniper, black tea, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, clove, light banana, herbal, grass, light caramel, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and bready malt sweetnesss; with an awesome malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Sahti style. All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and bready malt sweetness; and extremely smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted 5/24/2013."
""
""
"O-Not for me. Thankfully a 2 oz. sample goes away quickly."
"O- One of my favorite low alcohol beers on the planet. If you like chai tea you have to try this. I also think it's got a little similar taste to the Noble Rot so if you like that you should at least try this."
""
"I definitely enjoyed this but it's very sweet and flavorful and I imagine it is best shared with friends, perhaps in a snifter on a cold night."

"very interesting stronger beer with big spicy flavors that shroud the booziness somewhat. nice orangy light color and smells boozier with clovey, citrusy sour notes. light balanced mouthfeel but the lingering chai and spice afternotes leave me a bit befuddled. pretty good"

"O- One of my favorite Dogfish beers but I also am a sucker for chai."
""
""
""
"Overall- Great beer, easy to drink with the sweet and spicy characteristics of the chai tea. Deceitful considering the 9% ABV."
"DISCLAIMER: I am a fan of Chai Tea and would enthusiastically encourage all of those who also enjoy that beverage to investigate this beer. However, if you are indifferent or better yet, dislike Chai Tea altogether, you may not necessarily enjoy this offering...but would always welcome those to challenge their palates as you just might surprise yourself!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- An interesting mix of flavors that work pretty well together. Somewhat like an orange with cloves stuck in it, dipped in chai tea with wheat and berries. Not exactly sure what a traditional shati beer tastes like, but this one is complex and interesting, like most Dogfish Head beers."
""
""
"O - Overall, I find this a clean but not entirely great beer. I don't care for the mix of juniper and other spices. Although interesting, I won't be seeking it out again."

"Taste/feel: Tea with a tangy Belgian characteristic. Berries. Somebody mentioned cinnamon, and I got that as well. Not bitter in the slightest. Sort of refreshing, but at the same time, there's a slight warmth of alcohol. Interesting, tasty beer. I believe it was $12 for the bottle, which isn't too bad at all for such a unique tasting brew. It's not for everybody -- it has a good bit of ""funk"" to it in the taste and aroma, but I enjoyed it quite a lot. Worth a pick up."

"This is an interesting one. It has a unique flavor. The chai is prominent in the aroma, but not in the taste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, enjoyed this beer. A nice pairing with some Thai food, but if the food had been spicier selections the beer may have been overpowered. A nice sippin' beer with the right food combination. Interesting flavor combination - complicated and nicely blended flavors worth contemplating again. It would have been easy to push this one over the top, but it is nicely done."
"It's hit or miss for many with beers as daring as this brewer pushes out. Immediate hit in my book. It's very flavorful with the cinnamon and spice noted, I do get that vanilla chai taste, and the flavor just keeps on building and being interesting. I get pumpkin from this too, yet this still comes off as a farmhouse type of effort. It just works. Medicinal, Necco-waferish. My first Sahtea, but at least my second ""ancient recipe"" (the 1st being this brewery's Midas Touch). I much prefer this one."

"O: my Finnish wife spotted this one at our trip to the bottle shop. She suggested it based solely on her heritage. I'm glad she did. I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, I found it full of flavor and very pleasant to drink. I think what I liked most was the spiciness of the beer. I also think that the low carbonation was nice too, but I found that I did get a bit of a headache after the second small glass."
""
""
""
"A rather pleasant tea-infused big Belgian-style beer, which is obviously not the intent here, but hey, it's DFH, so you never really know. The nods to Finnish brewing history are tangential at best, especially after the guest ingredient quickly runs its course. So the best I can say about this is - forget preconditions and premonitions - this is a tasty tea-bagged strong ale, all without the immediate alcohol heat conditions one might readily expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste follows suit for the most part, but citrus is more the main player with the tea bringing up the rear, as well as some banana . Some black pepper and clove spiciness too, and a touch of honey. Not much of the rye to be found. Feel is light, tart, and refreshing. Not sticky, and not boozy. Very good beer if your are looking for something different. Gives you a bunch of great flavors, but it's balanced an d delightful making this just yet another great brew from DFH."

"O: this brew is not in my normal category that I would rate highly. There is a lack of hops dryness that I miss. However, I usually order this for one glass when I am at a DFH."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall-Nice sweet/spiced beer. I will definitely try again."
""
""
""
"Overall – I like this beer, especially as an after dinner/dessert offering. I have not had a traditional sahti, so I'd be interested to see how this compares i.e. if it would be as sweet or if DFH just wanted to compliment the chai tea addition."
"In general, I wonder if other positive reviewers have been seduced by what the brewers indicate they did to create this beer instead of focusing on what has actually been created. There are other things it could and should be, based upon the general description of recipe. But there is little opportunity for juniper and other Scandinavian herbs to contribute as they might, perhaps due to the choice of malts and high dose of alcohol. As a result, even time and warmth don't make it stylistically on target, even if it's curiously drinkable."

""

"Overall- Solid beer. It does exactly what I expected from the style description and the bottle's label. Not an everyday or session beer by any stretch of the imagination but a must try for anyone looking for something different and a bit exotic."

"Awsome brew Loved It!!! Such a rich beautifull beer loved all the flavors that just kept coming with every sip, It cant get much better than this folks . Im a fan flavorfull beers and this one hit a Home Run !!! Its kinda ornagey twang , light sweet floral notes as it warmed up ,this is one you can just keep drinking and drinking and drinking and never get tiered of it ."
""
"This is a very interesting beer, I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Due to the price I probably won't ever drink it again but I did enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
""
"I’ve yet to have a weird concoction like this from Dogfish and this really is quite interesting. Not something I would really need to go back to, but surely worth trying. Definitely recommended for tea lovers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The aroma is bigtime! Acidic fruit, spices, sweet and savory, very aromatic. The flavor follows but doesn't quite live up to the aroma.Very good mix of sweet and salty flavors. Big malt presence with lively yeast esters. Various spices that show up at different times. This would obviously pair excellent with Indian food or other curry dishes."
""
""
""
""
""
""

" overall this beer reminds me of the McKenzie seasonal special apple cider that is brewed with the cinnamon and nutmeg. great summer fall beer!"
""

"Overall: Sah’Tea is the second of the Ancient Ales produced by Dogfish that I’ve had, (the first being Theobroma), and I have to say so far, Dogfish is 2 for 2! I really liked this beer, though not as much as Theobroma, and I’ll certainly get it again. Looking forward to the other editions of the Ancient Ale Series."

"this shatea has a pretty amazing flavor- the juniper berries and black chai really push through this beer. the smell is super packed with the chai smell. it does have chunks in it, and i know that some beers have chunks-but personally im not usually a huge fan, however the flavor of this beer is so exotic and complex that ill take em. this beer is the reason i love dogfish- crazy beers that when they hit the mark are a hug success."

"Taste is bold, spiced, and malty sweet, even almost syrupy. There's a clear-cut chai tea spice finish, with relatively little dryness or heat at all. Very smooth and complex, this is a real treat and very enjoyable. High marks here!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy yellow gold, almost muddy water brown, with a lovely little fourth of a finger’s width head of tight small eggshell-white bubbles. The beer’s body is very hazy and opaque with some chunks floating in it, though the carbonation bubbles can clearly be seen racing to the surface. The lacing on the beer is spotty and thin, leaving haphazard patches across the glass. The smell is tremendous on this beer. It starts with a huge banana bread bouquet, clearly showing the beer’s weizen yeast, but then the smell spices up with peppery notes and a lovely milky herbal-spice from the chai. This beer smells big and complex, there are even hints of souring lactic acids, and maybe even a slight tart cherry fruit leather note. On the tongue, this beer tastes soft, sweet, and spicy. The beer begins with big banana flavors of a weizen beer and, strange enough, the lactic cherry sour flavors of a Flanders Red before it opens into spicy notes, and then hits the palate with light cinnamon, ginger and cloves. The finish is stronger with the chai and herbal notes, while green pepper flavors hint at the tongue. The aftertaste returns to a sweet banana linger alongside the lactic tart cherry while all other flavors fade off the tongue. This beer is dangerously drinkable for its nine percent rating, but you definitely feel it in the face after a glass. On the mouth, the beer feels medium and fluffy in body, with a nice jelling as it washes over the tongue, and a slight cloying nature from the sweetness of the drink. The mouth is left dry on the tongue, but wet on the sides, leaving the mouth confused, but asking for more. Overall, this is a hugely complex beer. I’m actually curious if I got an infected batch or if the beer is supposed to have an almost Flanders Red style taste in its opening and in its smell. The beer is hugely tasty for its high alcohol percentage, and quite complex. A winner for sure!"
"O- Just like everything that Dogfish Head makes--this was unique. Great sipper, was too heavy to drink more than a couple glasses full, so 1 big bottle was absolutely perfect... I would get it again some time.. probably after having a basic sahti to compare it to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another extremely interesting brew from Dogfish Head. Can't say I've really had anything comparable to this one. Really enjoyable stuff. It's not something I would want to drink all the time, but I'll definitely pick this one up again in the future. It would be a great Christmas/Holiday beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – I’m not really sure what a sahti is supposed to be like, but I think this may come close. As a matter of fact, all the stuff that’s listed on the bottle would have brought it farther away from the mark if I could taste or smell them (by that I mean the cinnamon, ginger, and rye). That’s the gripe that I seem to have with most Dogfish Head beers – they list a ton of ingredients and I can only appreciate a few of them. Nevertheless, this was definitely a drinkable beer as the 9% ABV was nowhere to be found. This is an interesting introduction to sahtis, a style that I think I’d like to explore more."
""
""
"Pours a hazy but vibrant gold color. Thick pure white rocky head. Looks alive. Aromas of oranges and alcohol with just a touch of resin. Very inviting clean smell. Starts with a sort of tart orange juice type flavor. Then the alcohol flavor makes itself known finishing with spicy pepper notes. Not really sweet but not bitter at all. No hops flavors, have read that sahti is not traditianally hopped at all. Very smooth and fairly refreshing. Dry finish. Light to medium carbonation. I don't really pick up the juniper which is too bad. I think juniper would be delicious in some beers but I haven't been able to taste it in the beers that advertise it. Enjoyable and interesting for sure."
"O: Nice. Sweet. Tea. Yummy. Very drinkable."
""
""
"O - Man what a beer! It really comes across with a lot of spices."
""
""
""
""
"Pours amber yellow in color with a good amount of sediment in the glass. Head is good at pour but disappates quickly to almost nothing and little to no lacing on the glass. Doesn't impact the mouthfeel which is still quality - a pop of bitter on the front, sweet throughout most of the body to the end and a good amount of carbonation to boot. Taste is sweet with the tea detectable but not over the top. Almost could be classified in a strong witbier category."
""
""
"O. It's an interesting taste. Not for everyone, but I like it in moderation."
""
""
""
"O - An enjoyable, tasty offering from Dogfish Head. I love the combination of spices mixed with the Chai tea and berries. Alcohol is masked well - lending a high drinkability to this brew. This is one of the most memorable, unique and flavorful beers I've had this year."

""

""
""
"Even halfway into the bottle, chunks of visible yeast were getting into my glass. It's a paler orange color with okay head retention and no lace. The nose brings a lot of juniper berries, honey, and even tea. The taste feeds off the aroma, which again is led by juniper berries, tingles of orange, tea, and there's even a slight tartness to the beer. The alcohol is hidden well to this low carbonated, medium bodied beer. A surprise for me, as this sahti is relatively easy to approach."
""
""
"Definitely interesting and rated based on my level of enjoyment. Sometimes these Dogfish Ales are hit or miss but this one is a HIT"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoy this beer. It is simply a great combination of beer and tea. The spices are strong but in no way overpowering. I would like to try it on draft as I have only had the bottles. The color is a rich amber, and the nose is personally my favorite part. If Yankee Candle would make this scent I'd have one in every room."

"O - I would recommend this beer as a special treat to beer drnikers that like orange flavors and citrusy weizens, hefeweizens, and flavorful wheats. A sweet treat, indeed."
""
""
""
""
"O: This brew would be great from spring to fall, hot days, very easy to drink. As one reviewer mentioned if you like chai tea, you need to try this one. Will consume more of these for sure."

"Unique beer, basically an ""avoid"" if you don't like chai tea or a ""must"" if you like it like I do. Another wacky idea Dogfish Head successfully pulls off."
""
""
"Overall this is just not my cup of tea, pun intended. Glad I split it with a buddy because it would have been a chore to try to consume this solo. Flavors are just not what I want in a beer and even for this style the palate seems a bit heavy and muddled."
""
"O-Sah'tea was pretty nice. I paired it with a heavier salad and it proved to highlight the better notes of both the meal and the brew. I would highly recommend this as opposed to drinking it alone as some of the undertones can be easily masked by the alcohol without it. Not bad but may not purchase again."
""
""
""
"Review from notes."
""
""
""
""
"all in all, Sah'tea comes across as a decent Tripel with some gin-like overtones - wouldn't be mistaken for a traditional sahti - perhaps by mellowing the fermentation, taming the alcohol and lowering its octane a couple notches, better balance would be achieved - i'd like to think I've had an example of this from them where all the elements where in more ideal accordance - nice to try at least once, and best on draft"
""
""
"medium body, slightly creamy, moderately carbonated. a refreshing ale with a nice off-beat twist to it. funky at times, sweet and zesty. overall, it's worth a try. i picked this up for the second time, after years of not having it - it's like having it for the first time all over again."
"Overall - very interesting brew, and great to try one of the older styles."

"A really nice beer!"
"O - One of my favorite beers hands down. Simply fantastic. If you have ever had and enjoyed a Chai tea, this is a must try."
"I poured this 22oz bottle into a snifter glass. It has a nice murkey yellow gold color body with no head but a thin lace around the edge. The smell is very inviting of chai and black tea with some malt coming through. The taste is a blast of chai right up front and the juniper flavor come on the back of the tongue. Very well balanced in flavor. Nice mouth feel and overall a really interesting good beer. couldn't drink it all the time but i'm glad i tryed this one."
""
"Review from 7/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a cloudy orange amber. Thin head and no lacing. Spicy sweet malt aroma with pine and Belgian spice elements. A clove spice flavor reminiscent of Belgian ales with a light, sweet malt body. Medium malts and spices. Slight hop and spicy finish with a hint of the tea. Interesting and satisfying. Worth a revisit."
""
"Overall: Quite different; not sure if it's something I would pick up again for the price but it was definitely tasty."
"Well, this is one of those beers to which I really have no comparison to base it on, style-wise. It pours a light gold color, and clear. Like a crystal-weiss, almost. I get juniper and some menthol notes—which does but shouldn’t remind me of menthol cigarettes, since the aroma is nothing like that. More… herbal? Piney? Eucalyptus? More like the smell of evergreens after a spring rainfall. A complex finish that lingers and takes some getting used to. An interesting beer from an interesting brewery. I’ll have to try more sahti and see how this compares."

"Overall: I have heard this one is better bottled. The flavor is full and there are no off putting notes. This one becomes more and more drinkable as it is enjoyed."

"O- I would recommend this beer. The high abv sneaks up on you, so be careful. But it is quite tasty, I will be stocking up."

"O: This beer is mediocre at best. It's too boozy and too spicy all at once. I don't think it's bad, but it's not all that good either."

"O: Another excellent beer from Dogfish Head. Enjoyable for the summertime."

"O: A pretty refreshing brew for a warm July afternoon at the brewpub. The 9% ABV isn't fully detected and the tart fruitiness is a nice reprieve. However, most of these ""ancient ale"" recipes all veer too close to Midas Touch for my taste. It was good but I'm unlikely to get it again."

"After having this and doing some research on Sahti, I've realized that Sam Adams Norse Legend can't even hold a candle to this thing. While not being part of the 19th century, I feel some how brought back by this beer. Very very good."
"Good shiz'."

""
""
"O- This is my first sahtea, and I like it! Definitely a change of pace, especially for an IPA drinker. It might be a sessionable beer for some, but for me, it will remain a change-up pitch. I think this beer would be a great selection in the winter to lighten up from all the heavier winter beers without losing that warming holiday spice. "

"Taste is very sweet pine, but obviously juniper. Hints of spice and citrus as well. Slightly overly sweet, but nice mouthfeel although booze is present. Overall,a very unique brew and something I hope to have again; maybe even aged."

""
"Pours a mild brown, with a slight tan head. Smell has mild malts, with a nice spice backbone. The first sip is mild malt forward, with spice notes and a smooth finish. Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. This beer goes down super easy for a 9% beer. Overall an interesting take on a traditional Finnish Sahti. Definitely worth a try if you've never had it."

"weird one. pours quite hazy orangeish light brown with a short white head that dies off after a few minutes. smells like spices of the far east, ginger, even flowers, very strange, but tempting. flavor has quite a bit of the tea flavor come through, which is smooth and earthy, ancient. interesting malt profile as well, amber malts, rye malts, interesting combination. feel is good, fuller bodied, boozy, and has average carbonation. overall this isnt anywhere my favorite dogfish brew, but it is an example of why they are like no other. what other brewery would attempt something like this, and execute it so well. this belongs in a museam somewhere."
"D: a very unique brew with a lot of aromas and flavors. glad i was able to try this and will seek out more of the ancient ales from DFH."

"Overall, this is not quite like the other more traditional version of the style I've had. in fact, side by side, they seem like 2 very different styles. But I am rating and reviewing what is in the glass, not the tradition. I'd have liked more juniper or nettles. That said, this was still very tasty brew. My wife, who does not drink beer at all, liked the aroma and actually tried this. ""I could drink this"" was her quote. They did something right."

"O: knew I'd love this beer - Dogfish Head makes amazing stuff - their big beers (Burton Baton, Midas Touch, WW Stout, 120m IPA, etc) are all top-notch, and this beer is right there - especially recommended for lovers of Midas Touch. Didn't expect to find this beer - hope I'm equally lucky with others in their Ancient Ales line of beers."

"Overall - Quite tasty, as with dogfish head, alot of flavors. First few sips i wasnt digging it but after i got used to it i started enjoying it. The lemon and banana flavor overpowers this a little, wish there was more berry flavor. Overall good, and different, not sure id buy again but id try on tap for sure."

"Pours a hazed orange color with a bit white head. As with most sahteas, a very herbal aroma. Lots of juniper and maybe some ginger notes. Lots of spices as well, mostly coriander and cardamom. A slight tartness is also noticeable. Strangely, there is a strong flavor of banana to go along with the juniper and spice character. Lightly tart and lemony, which is sort of interesting. Actually pretty enjoyable."

"O: a good beer, overall. Lots of nice spice flavors and aromas without being overwhelming. I don't really know what the standards for the style are, but this is a tasty beer."

"	Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring and the aroma. They were both robust with all the spice, ginger, and berry fruitiness. The body was less than impressive, as it was oddly light and strangely not coating. More hops would have also been nice, but the beer is pleasant overall."
""
""

"Overall a very sweet tasting brew with a lot of the fall spices, very reminiscent of a Pumpkin Ale."

"Poured from 750 bottle into a trusty pilsner glass. Poured a lighter copper color with no head and very little lacing. Not sure of the vintage (have had this awhile down in the cellar) but it still had good carbonation. Aromas of sweet malt is all I picked up on the nose. Taste was quite pleasant: rather sweet malt, definitely chai tea, and a bit of tartness/sourness--from the juniper berries I presume. Glad I had the opportunity to try this. DFH is very much a hit and miss for me a lot of times; this is definitely a hit and I'll seek this out again."

"M: Big and warming, the bigger abv is noticeable. The chai is rich and sweet, highly spiced but at home within the ale. My first chai, chai latte, and chai beer. I'll stick with the beer, thank you."
"I have several sahtis, but this is easily the best as it is flavorful to the tea and beer end of the spectrum. I only wish DFH was still available in Indiana."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Unique taste and brewed about as well as a recipe like this can be done; a little too much for me on the sweet and herbal side, a lot of cotton candy in this one, like Pangea; worth a try, not something I think I would have again though"
""
""
""
""
"O: very good, not my favorite DFH but certainly good. I like the uniqueness and refreshing qualities."
""
""
"O: Most like a lambic in my experience (but this is my first sahti, so I can't say how typical it is of this style). I shared a bottle with a friend on Christmas day, and it was perfect for the occasion of toasting Jesus' birth."
""
""
"Overall. Better than I thought this one would taste from the description, and from the smell. Different and not bad."
""
""
"* Paired with Beer and Stadium Brats on the grill. Went well due to the spices prevalent in both."
""
"O - DFH's Sah'tea is one of my two favorites of their ""Ancient beer"" series (along with Theobroma). It's unique and delicious...well worth your time. I wish this was a regular lineup, in six-packs type of beer; but I'll enjoy my 750mL. Well done!"
""
"A medium gold/light copper colored body with a head that while creamy is thinner than what I would expect from yeast from this region. In the nose is large banana, a little hard alcohol (very little) and a sharp, tangy floral aroma. Taste is a sweet, thin malt backbone followed by some syrupy, earthy pine sap that I associate with juniper branches and goldings hops (or something similar) and a light honey toastiness. Not too bright in the mouth, but sits with a pleasant weight. Tastes good, but is this really Sahti? It tastes just like a Belgian Strong to me, but my experience with traditional sahtis is limited, so... This one gets better with every 4 degrees F that it warms up to so let it sit, if you ask me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a really unique beer based on an ancient style, and it's a fascinating mix of flavors. It's strong and flavorful, but not completely overbearing; there's some subtlety to its richness. Not something I'd drink all the time but definitely interesting and tasty as a change of pace."

The alcohol is well hidden and it is pretty easy to drink. Definitely not my first time having it and kind of wondering why it took me so long to do a proper review... Definitely one I will have again."

" ""9th century Finnish recipe"""
"O - This beer is truly a unique experience. It's a great example of the creativity and diversity you get from Dogfish Head brews. I think one 750ml bottle was enough for me, especially at 9%, but it showcases a very interesting style. I couldn't drink this too often, but I would certainly like to try it again in the future."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It stands out as a very original experience. I recommend it as something very new for most."
"Overall, a pretty decent beer with strong fruit & tea like flavour."
"O - I really enjoyed this beer when it was fresh, IMO the flavor profile is just too delicate and aging does it no favors. Still a cool representation of a crazy style. Like most people, this is the sahti I have tried."
"O: I like this, I wouldn't drink it on occasion, but that's why it's only offered in 750ml bottles, it's definitely made for certain occasions. A sweet beer, but not overly sweet, with a nice complex flavor."
"D: Quite low, but only due to the alcohol; I rather like this beer a lot."
"Well, this is one of those beers to which I really have no comparison to base it on, style-wise. It pours a light gold color, and clear. Like a crystal-weiss, almost. I get juniper and some menthol notes—which does but shouldn’t remind me of menthol cigarettes, since the aroma is nothing like that. More… herbal? Piney? Eucalyptus? More like the smell of evergreens after a spring rainfall. A complex finish that lingers and takes some getting used to. An interesting beer from an interesting brewery. I’ll have to try more sahti and see how this compares."
"Overall - Not what I expected. Reminds me somewhat of Namaste. Definitely is different too. I wouldn't buy it again, but I also didn't hate it. It looked and smelled great, but the taste didn't live up to what I sensed. I really have mixed feelings about this one."
"D: I've been drinking DFH all week and must say Sah'tea is near the top of the list. Chateau Jiahu is great, but has a lot of wine characteristics. Sah'tea falls more on the beer side with some crazy tasting notes that are not over bearing. Surpassed my expectations and then some:)"
"O: Unique and different are the best adjectives I could use to describe this olfactory adventure. Not sure I would seek it out again but I am glad I tried it. Not my cup of tea, shall we say."
"Drinkability- I thought it was very good. I would drink it again and I would recommend it."
"O-A decent beer extremely spicy. It was worth the try but I wont be pulling the trigger on this beer again, wayy to expensive for what you get."
"Overall a beer that really smells great, tastes pretty good, and finishes nicely. I could sit and sniff all night!"
"-JH-"
"And thanks to BA for yet again broadening my palate, while thinning my wallet!"
"This poured out with an attractive looking golden color. The head fizzed up and down pretty quickly leaving just a ring around the glass. The smell of the beer has lots of herbs in it. It's a very interesting smelling brew, It's got some juniper and tea-like aromas to it. The taste doesn't have as much juniper as I was expecting it to have. The mouthfeel has a good thickness to it and is decently carbonated. Overall I liked the brew, I would try it again one day."
"I poured 90% of a 750mL bottle down the drain. I'll try again next year to be sure I wasn't on mescaline or something, because I've liked almost everything else from DFH that I've ever had."
"Delicious! The chai tea works perfectly with all the other components. Another unique beer from Dogfish."
"Poured in a tulip, the beer is a pale, yellow-gold color, slightly hazed, with steady bubbles and a thin, small bubbled head. Very floral and herbal nose, with a gin-like characteristic. Smells a little like potpourri. The taste is actually more reminiscent of peppermint tea, with some darkly sweet fruit overtones. The aftertaste is rich, with a light sweetness and heavy coriander and nutmeg spicing. The finish is slick, and slightly creamy. Very tasty and aromatic brew. Extremely unique and intricate."
"O: Even though I'm not enamored with the flavor, this is very drinkable: nicely crisp and the alcohol is not at all noticeable. Bonus points for the experimental nature."
"The spice in this beer would for me make this a nice winter warmer. The juniper, rye, and chai tea all work together well here. It's a sipper as all the flavors are a little too much to take down quickly. Also not sure how much more I would really want after the 750 mL were gone."
"Aroma is sweet, lots of honey here with really nice touches of herbal and flavor notes dancing around in the background. Smooth, light meadow like touches, heather, lavender, lots of grain, very interesting. even flavor here with it being over 9% is actually quite shocking as none of it really was that noticeable at all. Lots of sweet honey flavors again all over the one and the profile were done quite well. as it finishes it is dry and smooth without much in the way of a kick."
"O: I look forward to the release of this beer every year. It is one of a kind (like a lot of dogfish brews). Overall I'd rate this beer very highly because of its excellent taste, crisp mouthfeel, and uniqueness."
"O: I enjoyed this beer a lot more the last time I had it. It could be that my palate has changed, although I did only drink it four months ago, or simply that the flavors changed with some age. Either way, I will not pick up another. Far too pricey for something I wasn't crazy about."
"But I'm a biased dark beer lover."
"Can't say that I'd drink this again, but I'm thankful DFH gave me the opportunity to try it once."
"Alcohol is hidden quite well. Slight warming effect on the back of the throat. But what an interesting beer. This beer is quite good and drinkable. Hard to rate a beer in a style that is not very popular. This is my first in the style."
"O - A very aromatic beer with an interesting and pleasant taste. IMO, maybe worth drinking a couple of times a year but I prefer other styles."
"O: I liked it. It was interesting and different, although I doubt I will delve much deeper into the style."
"D- So much tea and fruit flavor, but still manages to drink like an ale. A little heavy, but worth it. Definitely not for everyone, but a real experience. Nice alternative to a hefeweizen. A solid girlfriend/wife beer."
"My initial pour (there would be at least a couple from the massive bottle) resulted in two dense fingers of French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention. The beer was a cloudy deep golden-amber with floaties noticeable in the glass. I suppose that if you going for authenticity, filtration and clarity are not priorities. That said, I do not mind unfiltered beer as filtering tends to strip flavors away. The nose smelled like potpourri, woody with herbs, especially a black pepper scent underlain by banana. Wow! Mouthfeel was much creamier than I remember it being on-tap and the initial taste was very much tea, followed by a rye bite. The fin(n)ish (ha ha) brought forth an intense banana flavor that reminded me of a hefeweizen. I consider myself to be adventurous when it comes to beer, but it seems like a little of this is going to go a long way. Frankly, it is the banana flavor that does me in. Otherwise, it is a pleasant, mellow beer, but one best shared with others."
"O - I just loved this beer. The profile was like nothing I've had before. And the qulaity of the beer makes me wonder if all sahti are quite this good. I've wondered if DFH was a bit overhyped and beers like this say otherwise. Just great execution."
"O: delicous brew, though not all that drinkable for some reason. I shared this with a few others. It's so much taste in a small glass. Still, great beer, and I love trying new brews."
"This is an acquired taste. What a unique combination of flavors. The tea, the spices. I couldn't help but hold this in my mouth for a second or two before I swallowed, with each sip. It really leaves you reaching for all that's inside. There's just so much going on. This is a great beer for the heat, but probably even better in the cooler months. I'm not sure how often I'd go out of my way to come back to this, but it was a fun beer. I recommend it to those looking for something out of the ordinary, and even a bit extraordinary."
"O-an interesting beer,but beers with this type of added spicing are not my cup of ""tea"""
"The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a fairly low amount of carbonation. This goes down really easily and makes you want to go back for more. Overall, this is a good brew. Something that goes down great on a hot day and is very enjoyable to drink."
"T: Definitely some hints of juniper along with a little oak and something sweet that tastes like cotton candy. A little rye and honey on the finish. I'm not getting a ton of the tea, but there may be a bit hidden in the front of the taste."
"O: This is an excellent brew and I would recommend to anyone. I always look for this odd release at the local store."
"This one pours a hazy orange-straw color with plenty of floaties. The head is a modest finger worth, but retains well. The aroma is very sweet, with the chai tea coming through very strongly. There's also a strong juniper aspect, along with some mint, cinnamon, cardamom, cumin, ginger, and a bunch more spices I can't quite put my finger on. A very complex and inviting aroma. The taste really follows the nose, with a sweet melange of spices careening across the tongue. It's very complex, but unfortunately doesn't smell quite as good as it tastes. It's still a tasty brew, but probably just a bit too sweet for my liking. The mouthfeel is fairly full-bodied, with a level of carbonation that's just a bit tingly. The drinkability is alright, I split the bottle over two nights, since it's really a ""one and done"" sort of thing. Another enjoyable experiment from DFH."
"A very unique beer. Medium dark amber color with a thin head that fades fairly quickly. Aroma/taste reminds me of bananas and chai tea. Very complex beer that hides the alcohol well. Hard to believe that it is 9% abv when feels more like 7% abv. Very crisp and tasty. I wish it could be added to the year round portfolio. Really nice. If you see it get it."
"Pours a very hazy yellow/orange color. Very little foamy white head erupts, making the appearance reminiscent of an unfiltered hefeweizen with less than normal head. The smell is where it hooks you though. Wow, I everything I own to smell like this! It’s quite complex, with faint mint, tea, random herbs, juniper, floral hops, and light citrus all melding together in the best way possible. Taste is also up to par, with a faint yeast sensation, juniper, lemon, cinnamon, straw/hay, and light berries. Reminds me of a fruity, spicy saison (that was in my notes for some reason, so I included it here). Mouthfeel is smooth, invigorating, and refreshing. Overall, a very unique and delicious beer."
"o - Overall this is one that is dominated by the juniper berries. If you like that smell and taste you'll probably love this one, but it was just way too much of it for me. My brother liked this one a lot more than me. Wouldn't seek it out again."
"O- I really enjoyed this beer...more than I expected. Very unique and different. The cinnamon and chai tea are really the difference makers for me."
"Drinkability/overall- in terms of drinkability for my taste this one was not very high, it just had way to much spice and to me was sort of overwhelming, you add this extreme spice and then weight and alcohol and this wasnt my favorite in drinkability, overall the beers quite unique that much is certain and i give dogfish credit again for pushing the envelope like they always do but for me personally this was a miss"
"Pours a beautiful cloudy dull orange. A quickly dissipating white/yellow head tops the brew. Aroma really stands out as the smell of spices knock you back. Cardamom and juniper dominate the nose with Belgium yeast quite up front. Taste is biting but somehow seems balanced. Mouthfeel rocks but the body is a tad thin. Nicely carbonated."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. This is my first of the style, but I will have to try more now. Would recommend if you want to try something pretty different and also if you like chai lattes"
"My favorite Dogfish beer is Red & White, and I think this comes in second as a sort of exotic cousin. A really enjoyable and unique brew."
"A fascinating pint I'm glad to have tried!"
"O: A very flavorful and balanced beer that hides the alcohol extremely well. Works well for a summer beer, but could be a beer for any season the way that all the ingredients blend so well together"
"- Overall this beer is quite good and worthy of some high marks. It is very unique, and isn't shy on the extra ingredients. Luckily the flavors meld well together, leaving a very flavorful ale which is quite balanced. Certainly one I would say is a must try, and can easily fit in as one of my favorites from the brewer. A brewer in which I have had more beers that I dislike than like. That is slowly changing."
"D/O: Very big beer but slightly flat and has a mild flat feeling to it because of the weight of all the ingredients. Very interesting combination."
"Overall just a great unique tasting drink. Can't really compare it to any other Sahti's would love to, and this is my first one, however, it would be nice to tasty something from the real country. Regardless, I really really enjoy this but it quite different."
"D - Easy drinking but character may be lost with overly spiced food."
"O- Really reminds me of a Belgian beer. Wish I could think of the specific one. Very tasty, and worth checking out. Not for everyone, but I enjoyed it."
"I can't say that this is something I see myself buying again, but it was certainly interesting and worth the try."
"Overall: A very interesting beer and one i would have liked more if it resembled more like the aroma. It mellows as it warms but i find it was a bit too brash."
"D - Very good. This is very light but full of flavor. It has a great finish and is really easy to drink."
"O: Enjoyable beer overall. This was the first time in two years I'd tried it and the first time ever on draft. However, I'd also be happy waiting years before having it again."
"Pours a hazy honey orange color with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a small cap. Random spots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is pure chai tea aromas and the taste is very much the same. I really like chai tea and this beer was very spot on in my opinion. Nice tea, spice, and citrus aromas and flavors come out in this beer. Good carbonation with a smooth yet bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great smelling and tasting beer but I am not too sure I could drink this one very often. I am glad I was able to find a bottle in CA as I had never seen it before."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer on draft. It reminded me of what I remember Poppaskull tasting like, but with no vanilla or cinnamon. I'd definitely buy this in a bomber when it comes out again."
"O- This was a fun brew, I can always count on DFH to do something interesting and different."
"O: I didn't like the flavour. 3"
"Pours a beautiful hazy sunset red rose orange, with a creamy offwhite cap of foam with light lacing in its wake. The nose brings ginger, coconut, spicy clove and cinnamon, as well as pumpkin pie. Tasting the beer the chai spice jumps at you with more clove, cinnamon and nutmeg and almost has a creamy taste/feel to it. There is also a touch more pumpkin pie and spicy coconut. Very refreshing with light sweet malts well balanced by the chai spice and acidity. The DFH beers i always think i will like im quickly disappointed and then this beer along with red and white i end up loving - very odd but happy to drink them. Also as i disclaimer i am a fan of chai tea in general so my review might not be completely objective."
"Pours a hazy goldish orange color with a one finger head and visivle floaties. The head gives way to a little bit around the edges with spots of lace. The aroma is big you can smell right out of the bottle, black tea smell with a sweet smell. Bananas and a bubble gum smell which I assume is the juniper berries. The taste of black tea with a bubble gum almost belgian cabdy yeast tatse and the finish is of earthiness. It is not a hop bite but and deep earthy flavor. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and slightly pricky. Overall I would for sure have this again the smell started me off on wanting it and the flavor didn't disappoint. Nice sweet well balanced flavor."
"An OK beer, but I just can't see myself ordering this again any time soon."
"FASCINATING, WORTH EXPLORING!"
"A woman got in my car not that long ago (restored 66 Mustang coupe) and before I even started the engine she said, ""This is the coolest car I've ever been in"". Well, Sah'tea is the coolest beer I've ever had. Unlike anything I've ever smelled or tasted before, it is completely unique....well, I take that back a little. It reminds me of a Kolsch with perfume. The smell is all over the place, but interestingly enough the taste is more subdued. Complexity out the wazoo, there are all kinds of flavors. Not sure what juniper berries or twigs are supposed to smell like, but if you don't know, then smell and taste this beer. Can't drink too much of it; one tulip at a sitting is plenty, but sit back and savor it. Each sip brings a different experience to your senses. And at 9%, your senses will be dulled by the end of that first glass. Bottle artwork is top notch. Drink early and often."
"Well this beer has its place, and from the yeast used I can conclude that DFH should make a hefeweizen, but then again that just wouldn't be their thing. Pretty good beer."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low. Overall it was a very interesting and unique beer. I'm not sure it was something I'd want to drink often, but they did a good job getting all these flavors to mix together pretty well. Cool beer overall with some unique flavors and was pretty decent overall."
"Overall, very nice! Unique, never tasted anything like it before. I kept thinking throughout consumption how the brew lent to the feminine side of taste, will be buying a few more bottles to split with my girlfriend & at 9% abv, I suggest you do the same."
"O: This is the hot toddy of beers."
"With Dogfish, you never really know what you're going to get. That's part of the fun! This beer was an exceptionally FUN beer to drink. It's a perfect ""2 o'clock in the afternoon"" beer, assuming you have no qualms about drinking early! The juniper berries shine through, along with the various spices, but this beer is not at all overwhelmingly sweet. The brewing processes is rather untraditional, and I think that might contribute to the well balanced nature of this beer. It's warm, light, smooth, and maybe even a bit creamy. It's different to be sure, the juniper does come through. As someone who tends to favor darker, warmer, and richer beers, this is a bit out of my comfort zone. But I'm very happy I tried it."
"O: The label is pretty awesome. "
"O-Very different beer. Interesting mix of spices. I would definitely try this again. Would be good on a hot day. Doesn't drink like 9%"
"O- I really enjoyed this one, a crisp feeling beer with loads of flavor. I enjoyed the orange i got in the nose, and wished it turned up in the taste, but all in all I enjoyed the flavors of this drink..another successfull brew from dfh!"
"As you continue to sip on it you pick up on more flavors that you didn't before. I wish I bought another bottle."
"The excellent bottle artwork coupled with the outstanding nose and taste is another win in my book for the Ancient Ales series. Dogfish Head didn't just replicate an ancient Sahti recipe here, they took it one step further and introduced chai tea leaves which gives this a truly unique layer of flavor."
"A DFH beer that works."
"Lovely odd duck this is. Pours with a small, off white head that mostly fades, and a little lace. Color is a hazy medium amber. Not all that much to look at. Aroma is exquisite - spices, yeast, malt, fruit, herbs, in an exotic blend that is beguiling. So I drank some. Flavor's not as intriguing as the nose, but still pretty good. Reminds me of a good saison. Maybe just a touch too sweet. Anyway, most of the aroma characteristics but muted. Body is decent, perhaps could use a little more carbonation; however, still good. Finish is short to medium in length with a little booziness."
"Terrific beer that was quite the crowd pleaser. It was light yet complex, like a good hefeweizen can be, but so distinctly different from any other class of beer. I like its ability to provide strength and spice effortlessly so it could be both a summer light beer, but also a sipper. Unfortunately, given all the redeeming qualities of this beer, it was $12 for a 750mL bottle. I don't think it was necessarily worth that type of premium considering a bottle of Squall goes for $7.50...."
"m/o: somewhat creamy and medium bodied, with mild carbonation. the alcohol adds a bit of heaviness to it, but it's still pretty darn drinkable, if you like chai flavors in your beer. i do; that being said, this beer is definitely not for everyone. but it's one of the few super experimental dogfishhead brews that i thoroughly enjoy."
"Bottle dated 2010R"
"Bottom line: flat-out, it is not good."
"O/D- Wow. Unique and way enjoyable. Alcohol is hidden well. Ill have another glass if I'm feeling dangerous. This one is a challenge, and I still can't figure it out."
"D/O- My second dabbling into a sahti. This style continues to excited me because it seems that it has a wide range of interpretation as long as the process is similar. I really enjoy the route DFH took on this one. Recommended to anyone who has an open mind to a harder to find style, one that I think could take off someday."
"Overall this beer isn't really my style. I don't really like the autumn spices playing such a large role in the flavor, but it's to be expected. It's interesting to say the least, and I'd recommend it for any chai lover."
"O: This is one DFH brew that I totally look forward to every year. I sampled a spiced beer with ginger yesterday... and this one was 10x better than that!"
"O: Maybe if you're a huge fan of chai."
"Narrative: Papers, TPS reports, zoning regulations: WHO THOUGHT THAT BEING THE PUMPKIN KING WOULD BE SO MUCH WORK. You didn't ask for this, being the dauphin of several regal seasonal bloodlines, but yet here you are, in your ostentacious orange house, your burnt yellow desk, sipping on eggnog wondering where it all went wrong. Well I guess Pumpkinonia could have used more regulation of its chief export, rubber, but who are you to interfere with the Pumpkinonian's laize faire commercial structure? The seed tarrifs, the middle road tolls, cleaning up constant pumpkin guts from the country side was just far more than you bargained for. Then the sweet juniper potion starts to call your name, you are a flawed ruler, to be sure, but who can fault the Pumpkin King for being a raging alcoholic. After all, you smell like a warmed over holiday party 364 days out of the year, but on Flag Day you rest. DING, time to take the PUMPKIN PIE OUT OF THE OVE- BANG!"
"Finish: Medium to short finish, really can't tell, but either way ,this beer lacks the most here and this is where this beer falls apart for me. Most Dogfish beer's end with a flair this one sort of falls flat and looses flavor."
"Sah'tea pours a crystal clear orange, with absolutely no head or lacing to speak of. The nose is very reminiscent of a hefeweizen, big banana notes up front, with a spicy background presence. Unlike a traditional hefe though, that spice isn't straight clove, but a bit more peppery. The flavor is a bit more balanced and complex. Some fruity berry notes join the banana to create a base that supports the spicing. The black pepper definitely comes through clearly, as does a certain herbal quality that I'll attribute to the black tea. The other spices aren't nearly as pronounced, but instead act as a bridge between the tea and pepper. The body is pretty much middle of the road for a beer that's up at about 9%, but the carbonation is just a little bit lacking, a little bit more would make the beer seem a bit more lively. The first of DFH's Ancient Ales line that I tried was Theobroma a while back, and that one kept me from trying another until now, but Sah'tea has made me much more eager to check out the rest. An interesting and tasty brew."
"Overall: Can I drink this back to back? No, but I can't stop drinking it..soooo...um....no idea. Overall, share this with newcomers and experts. DFH wins again."
"O: Very drinkable and very different."
"Edit: Tasting again, the chai is slightly more evident. It's kinda like the spice of a saison meets the body of a wheat doppelbock."
"Overall: I enjoyed it and am interested in trying more variations of a sahti. Next time I’m in Finland I will have to search out some traditional sahti."
"I really enjoyed it, but its not a beer id have on a regular basis. It was too complex and thick to be refreshing. But it was a very good beer."
"Orangy yellow cloudy pour with a foamy white head. Subtle spice and leafy aromas, a little tart on the onset - but a nice full flavor ... interesting spice and definitely some lemon grass. Very good and uniquely flavored and refreshing brew - enjoyed while making my own on a hot Sunday in August"
"Very smooth. The flavor is reminiscent of a lot of pumpkin beers that I have tried. All of those chai spices are present from beginning to end. The juniper comes through in the middle and the finish has a bit of alcohol warmth to accompany the spices. The mouthfeel really is like a heavily creamed chai tea and is almost perfect for this beer."
"A nice mildy spiced, mildy citrus brew infused with chai tea. Very tasty and not too overbearing in any way. Poured hazy copper-brown with a small white head that retained well; some lacing. Fruity sweetness and spice in the nose. Smooth aromatic spice in the taste with the tea hitting you right away, and fruity sugars backing it up. Smoooth. Medium mouthfeel and a bit syrupy. Pleasant, delicious, highly drinkable."
"O: Quite an interesting brew. I was a bit nervous going in since I don't drink tea or chai, but I quite enjoyed this."
"I think that somewhat sums it up, that in coffeeshop terms, this is the chai tea to my ideal chai latte. That said, it still has an exciting and satisfying chai/ginger taste that's really refreshing and rewarding. If you've never had one, grab it and pour it at elevenses."
"O: A very interesting, very drinkable beer. Not dogfish head’s best brew – but definitely worth a taste. My first experience with this stlye, but something I would like revisit in the future."
"Very interesting beer, and I am glad I tried it. Good job."
"Pours a bright tangerine, big foamy, white bubbles for head. Tons of floaties in the body. Nose is real pungent. Hop and chai tea spiciness, full of perfume. Hops offer some citrus underneath, some orange and tangerine. Some pale malt. Juniper adds some 'forest-y' notes. Taste has just as much juniper, and spicy, perfumey hops. Citrus backdrop again, clean and crisp in the mouthfeel. Taste is subtler than the nose, but drinks quite well. First experience with a sahti, and like Steve indicated, this would've been infinitely more refreshing if served a bit cooler than we had it."
"Juniper worked, also positive that not noticeably gingery. Carmel, pecans, cola, carob."
"Pours a very mild hazy orange with a thick yellow head and almost no lacing. Smells of orange peel, banana, yeast, and clove. Tastes of yeasty banana and bread, clove, light tea, and malts and orange. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp with a light carbonation Very light for 9 percent. Overall, I really liked it."
"Pours a hazy, unfiltered orange, with a very tight head. Tiny bubbles. Smells is great, sweet tea and extremely yeasty. Has some floral notes. Tastes like a Farmhouse Saison, yeasty, balanced, smooth, not overbearing. This is a well-brewed beer. Its sweet in the way that it just hints of sweetness before exiting and leaves you wanting another sip. Well done."
"overall, this is a super solid beer - another interesting creation from dogfish that stands out as unique among beers that i've had"
"Overall: One of my favorites."
"Overall: This beer is quite unique. I like it. I would drink it again. Good job Dogfish for making rare styles. Thank you."
"Additional notes: I didn't notice a tremendous difference between the bottled and draught versions of this beer. That said, there's been a gap of more than a month between the two. If anything, the draught version is smoother and cleaner."
"D: Glad to finally have this style. Very interesting. Glad I have another bottle to drink later."
"D - Nicely drinkable, but I doubt I could drink a bottle by myself. Probably the highlight of the night, a very unique and tasty beer."
"Drinkability: I don't think this is a bad beer, and perhaps it isn't my style. I don't know that I would pay for another bottle."
"this beer is honestly like that girl you kiss at the binning of the night and can't stop thinking about!!!"
"D-4 This beer is quite drinkable. I could enjoy several of these pours at a time, or just make the 750mL bottle a good night's work! It's very balanced between the tea, sweets and spices. Another good showing ""off-centered"" ale from the DFH crew."
"D- Very complex beer with a bunch going on in the smell and the taste. Even with all of that going on, it is still rather balanced."
"D: Sweet and easy but sharp and blunt at the same time, Sah'tea is a beer that should contradict itself, but works all the better because so many ingredients seem to compete against each other. It's unique and fun. It's one of those beers where DFH lives up to its motto."
"D: For the amount of alcohol, it's definitely drinkable, more than one in a session. Overall, a great brew!"
"D: I will defiantly be keeping my eye on thee schedule to see when this will hit shelves but don't see myself going great lengths to get it (IE out of state or trading)."
"This is one of the best DFH beers I have had. Well researched and well brewed!"
"When you open this beer, the smell is welcoming and calming. It has the scent of strong chai tea and a certain sweetness on the nose. The taste is very sweet, most likely due to the juniper berries. Hops come through but not at all overwhelming to the tea taste that seems to perfectly compliment the beer itself. With a sweet yet solid after taste and if you can afford it a near perfect drinkability, this beer earns its place among the better beers that i have tried."
"I have never had this style before so it's hard to judge. This could have passed for a wit beer. It is easy going down and the 9% couldn't be less obvious. I could enjoy this warm summer day."
"(D)- A good beer for the summertime. A bit spicy for sessionable consideration in my opinion."
"higher tingly carbonation that makes for a refreshing mouthfeel. unique, but wouldn't drink it every day."
"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a snifter glass. Pours a cloudy antique gold with a thin white head that disappeared after the first sip and left no lace. Pleasant aroma of malt, honey, juniper and coriander. The flavor is quite distinctive and enjoyable with malt, honey, juniper, chai tea, and coriander. I thought it was interesting that the chai tea was quite noticeable in the flavor yet completely absent from the aroma. Mouthfeel was a bit odd; almost slick. Overall, this is a very different beer. I'm not sure it is something I would drink with any regularity, but it was fun to try."
"Tastes incredible. The juniper berries really stand out and it definitely doesn't taste like 9% ABV. I couldn't stop drinking it. It is very drinkable but due to the high price I can't see it becoming a session beer. The smell is also incredible, the juniper berries really come through. Definitely one of my favorite beers."
"Its a beer for spice lovers who want something different."
"NOTES: The beer is a rich, flavorful, creamy, lightly carbonated 9.0% ABV beer that I would drink, more likely than not, as a desert beer. This would be a great end to any meal. There was also a noticeable slurry of yeast at the bottom of the bottle upon completion."
"Thanks cam!"
"Pours a slightly murky orange. A good amount of head with tons of lacing. Smells like chia and more chia! Some slight juniper on the nose as well. Tastes strongly of chia. It's light in most of it's flavors but well carbonated and thick and sweet. Fairly drinkable for the 9%."
"D= this may be the best of the ancient ale series I've had. For a shati its wonderful. Easily worth checking out."
"D - The drinkability is good. It goes down easy and definitely never gets boring. It is a very interesting beer. I think this is a great beer, and I fully support DFH in brewing up these interesting and different beers. I'm very glad I got a chance to pick this one up, and I would definitely try it again."
"D: This is uniquely delicious and complex, certainly better than the other Ancient Ales, and may be the only quaffable 9% beer."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy orange color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sweet malt with notes of juniper and Chai tea is very pleasant. Taste is also dominated by aroma of juniper and nice fresh wheat malt with notes sweet fruity ester. Body is quite full with a nice texture and some good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. A lot better then I had expected based on previous experiment from this brewer."
"Dogfish Head has done it again! Another amazingly crafted, thought out brew, that I found to be, another one of their top notch brews of alluring complexity and Yumtasticness!"
"For as spicy and intensely odd as it is its remarkably drinkable. And, hats off to the person who described this as both Christmas and summer at the same time, which is a perfect description."
"Very pale orange.Not at all what I expected when I saw the bottle. kind of smooth and creamy. very malty and very apparent spices fill your nose. Tastes somewhat the same as the nose, only not nearly as powerful. Very relaxing at the end of a hard day at work."
"Dogfish Head's ancient ales series is always intriguing. And I always seem to rate them around the B+ range for some reason. Sah'tea is no different. I've been wanting to try this for some time, and I was not disappointed. My second favorite Dogfish Head brew, period (next to Chateau Jiahu)."
"This is a very frothy beer, like in the show, Dogfish He...er Brewmasters. I've always wanted to get a super frothy beer like they show, but I've never had a dogfish head beer do so, this does. God I want to stop writing and sit with this beer now. Am I going to say anything in this section that will deter you from drinking this beer or push you over on the edge of ""okay, sure I guess I'll try it now."" If you see this beer on the shelves, freaking buy a bottle. I live in Missouri and I can't get this very easily, by that I mean I can't get it. If you live in a place that can get it and you haven't tried it yet, quit being a jerk and buy a bottle."
"This is definitely ONE of the best beers I've had from Dogfish Head. It's the only Sahti I've tried, so I can't tell you if it's true to style, but I can tell you it's a world-class beer.. go try this now! Those who are unsure, if you like pumpkin ales, you'll love this."
"Juicy, pale, slightly hazy orange with a wispy white head. I was expecting a big spicy zip in the nostrils but instead this is rather shy on the key ingredients. Very faint juniper and even fainter tea combine for a vaguely spicy, kinda gingery aroma with cardamom, clove, lemon, orange, Belgian yeast, and Bavarian hop notes. There is something sage-like about it as well. The flavor is like a cross between a gin and tonic and Delirium Tremens, spicy, dry, and balanced, and somehow Christmassy and summery at the same time. Tea tannins unfold along with ginny juniper, masala spices, and citric hops for a beer for all seasons. Spritzy but smooth, this is a versatile, subtle, and surprising beer that grows more delicious and complex the more you drink."
"Overall impression: deceiving alcohol content with herbal scents and floral taste. enjoyable in good company over the summer."
"Very interesting, very drinkable beer. Nothing to cause palate fatigue. Very enjoyable."
"D: Very ggood for my first taste of a Sahti, different but very tastey"
"Overall a pretty good as a spiced beer, the Sahti charachters were a bit muted though."
"Overall, this beer is full of interesting flavors and subtlety. Extremely spicy, but the fruit notes underneath offer a new experience with every sip."
"Appearance is a brilliant yellow orange. It is a little bit hazy and does have some visible particles. Had a good size yellowish head. The smell is absolutely unique. It has a very herbal nose, after sniffing for a bit, it seemed like a great flavor for a potpourri. One of the best smelling beers i have ever tried. The taste is nice. It gives you a very sweet taste on your tongue, then the herbal notes set in. It has a citrusy finish and is clean similar to a hefenweizen. Mouthfeel is great and has a good bit of carbonation to it. Drinkability is exceptional for a 9% abv."
"It should be noted that quite atypically, this beer seemed to taste better when colder than it did after it was pretty warmed up at the end of the bottle."
"D= Very refreshing would have no problem finishing a 750ml bottle."
"Could easily finish off this 750ml by myself, especially on a warmer day, if I didnt have to work the next day. Wishing for 12oz 4-packs."
"D: Great."
"D: overall i'd say too much juniper, too little chai, but worth a try. It's different then anything I've ever had."
"What can I say, my wife has pretty good taste in beers (I taught her well, she has come a long way from her Coors Light days)..."
"D - Considering its complexity, this is a very drinkable beer"
"I love Dogfish's willingness to try something wild, different and bizarre. And their willingness to put it in front of the general public. I hope they never stop doing this. Sometimes they get hits, sometimes misses. For me, this is one of their greatest misses."
"Taste is very chai tea like, it's got some light pilsner malt flair and no hops at all. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, really unique."
"drinkability; easy to drink and comforting but the alcohol sneaks back to let you know respect is required."
"Recommended Music Pairing: NWA - Straight Outta Compton"
"It's really complex, and the alcohol is so well cloaked it's ridiculous for a 9%'er. Very drinkable. One of the best of the Ancients that DFH has given us."
"medium-plus bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. as for drinkability, here i think its uniqueness works against it; IMO the melange of spices wears on the palate after a while. although i would welcome another at some future point."
"I like this a lot, and will buy it again for certain. It's definitely not an every day beer, but it's just what I need after a larger than I should have eaten turkey dinner."
"I feel as if this is one of Dogfish Head's more successful experiments. I got all of the flavor and complexity that their ingredient list promised. The flavors aren't lost or as subtle as in some of their other beers. And in this case that is a good thing."
"For what it is, it's a success."
"D- Like most of Sam's brews, definitely pushed the envelope and is a very unique and flavorful beer. The one drawback for me was a little too much going on and some confusion on the palette."
"Bottle. Pours hazy orange with a lasting white head. Aroma is of yeast, spices, sweet malt, fruit and berries with hints of tea. Flavors are similar to aroma. Full, smooth body. Very interesting, complex, delicious brew. I went out and bought 3 more bottles after I tried this brew."
"Taste is also a little sweet but definitely finishes with some alcohol. After sipping it and letting it sit on my tongue for a bit I definitely have a light cinnamon aftertaste. I was thrown off because I was thinking it was made with just ""black tea"" not ""black chai tea"" which now makes more sense. Like most beers I've ever had made with juniper, this has no juniper taste at all that I can recognize. It's a lot more smooth than I expected... I was expecting diluted gin of some sort but it's really just a mellow chai-infused beer. I like that better than calling it a Sahti.. although the body certainly lends itself to the flaked oats traiditionally used. Very smooth. At the end of it, though, I'm left reminded of a close to $20 bottle of pumpkin ale without the pumpkin. Wouldn't buy again in a bottle, would definitely try fresh on tap, and was generally worth a try."
"D - A very drinkable beer. Quite easy to finish the whole bomber. I'll be picking up more of these."
"D: Very high. I would order another and will definitely buy again. Strength is the only thing keeping it away from perfect drinkability."
"D - Drinkable and moreso than most saisons I think. This is my first encounter with Sahti, and it's definitely an interesting kind of style. Similar to a saison but definitely unique and unlike anything I've ever tried before. I'm kind of surprised more breweries don't make this style - I think it has a lot of potential. Would probably get Dogfish's again."
"Notes - This is a pretty wild concept, even by Dogfish Head standards. It's not perfect, but it's very much worth trying and enjoying."
"Overall, I was very pleased with this beer. Sometimes Dogfish overdoes it a bit, but this was one of their more enjoyable beers that I have had. This is one that is definitely worth picking up."
"Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is on the lighter side, and the beer is smooth and drinkable. Really good"
"D: Easy to drink, the 9% abv isn't very strong at all. Mildly sweet, mildly spicy, a well-balanced beer. Tasty, but not really my style."
"D: Medium-low. Sah'tea is interesting, innovative, and fun to try, but once the uniqueness wears off, much of the appeal leaves as well. It's certainly not sessionable, either, although it went above and beyond my expectations."
"Definitely a big beer. I'm still in the middle of it, and it is probably one of the more complex beers I have ever tasted. Very nice mouthfeel, which is immediately hit with a taste of the bubblegum yeast, followed up with notes of clove, chai, and maybe some cinnamon. Still trying to decide how I feel about the combination of flavors though. I chilled the bottle in a wine cooler to 57 degrees, which brought out alot of the different tastes. It might not be the best tasting beer ever, but kudos to DFH for having the balls to make a beer this complex. Definitely worth a try."
"D: This beer is (not too surprisingly) rather difficult to score by style, but it most resembles an exciting, flavorful tripel very much in the spirit of the Bruery's basil-infused Tradewinds. Expect this beer to do everything a tripel can, not excluding the potent dose of ethanol in a serving."
"I poured into a nonic glass to three fingers of off white head. It is orange/amber colored. This is a very aromatic beer. I get clove, juniper, cinnamon, and some faint caramel malt. It reminds me of a Christmas ale. The taste is everything I smelled. I get the spices and malt up front with the piny taste lingering a bit on my tongue. It leaves a little bit of a chalky feel on my tongue. I had NO idea what to expect from this beer, but everything about it reminds me of Christmas. I may have to get another bottle for the holidays."
"D- The juniper berry brings a nice sweetness and pine feel. It has a spicy finish that is a bit dry but the orange overtones and the background of of a honey calms things down to a very mellow drink. It doesn't taste like beer. The chai tea is overwhelmingly good. Its like a chai tea with carbonation poured into a very nice medium bodied brew."
"D- This is a really good beer, easy drinking that no way feels like 9%."
"I was pleased to try this beer but was let down a bit by the results. Sahtea is more of a victim of high expectations than poor craftsmanship. Very easy to drink though the taste is not quite what I would have wished for. The flavors make this one to share with your noncraft drinking friends."
"D - This is pretty incredible. I can't think of another beer like this at all. Even the alcohol doesn't come through at all. Thanks Mike!"
"D - a brave, yet successful offering from DFH. i remember having this fresh on tap at one of their brewpubs and thinking it was just a tad too sweet. the year this has sat around has done well for it. paired nicely both during and after some homemade pad thai. dangerous at 9%"
"D: The beer is very drinkable because the alcohol content is well hidden. I would definitely try this beer again because it is very unique."
"This beer had very complex flavor, I thought it was a bit out of balance, at times it was too sweet and others kind of sour. Though it was interesting I'm not sure I'd be interested in this again."
"Think I will pick up a bottle to put away."
"Drinkability.. well done. For a beer of this strength and complexity you have done well!"
"Not very affordable as this bomber puts you negative 15 bones"
"D-mmm i could drink a lot of this. is it really 9% abv?? it goes down so easily!! i love it! good thing it comes in a 750mL bottle!"
"This was definitely an interesting experience (I would expect nothing less from DFH) and I look forward to trying it again soon."
"Pours a hazed dulled gold with minimal to no head. Scent is very wheat beer like with underlying tones of berry and herbal ingredients. Taste brings the notes of berry, mild herbs to the front, while a wheat beer background is still present. A noticeable alcohol quality lingers in the rear. Medium bodied, maybe slightly undercarbonated. A very pleasent suprise of a beer."
"D: This was my first adventure with a Sahti and I enjoyed it. The alcohol is masked nicely which makes having one or two in a sitting feasible."
"M/D: Mouthfeel was good, thats about all I can say about it. I did enjoy this beer, although I have no clue how I should rate such a strange beer. I would like it again, but I would need to wait several months. Perhaps it fills a strange niche in the beer world."
"A refreshing and creative brew that jives with my worldly sensibilities. The hidden ABV is a nice bonus. I wish I encountered it earlier in the summer. DFH is brewing some really interesting stuff and this one will be a summer regular for me."
"Lots of lingering spiced flavors left in the mouth that come across a bit peppery at times. This is a medium bodied brew and moderately carbonated. Fairly drinkable for 9% but gets more complex and enjoyable as it gets slightly warmer."
"This is a very easy drinking and pleasant beer, with the tea characteristics probably better enjoyed on a warm summer day though. I really enjoyed the ability of the flavors to be very unique but still feel quite familiar and at home in a beer."
"Dr. After a couple of tastes, I wasn't looking forward to finishing the bomber; however, the alcohol has worked its magic and it's gone and I feel fine."
"Just watched the video with Sam/Bryan Selders and their crew heating the rocks for the pilot batches. I've been nervous to try this creation because of the heavy chai tea infusion post boil. Pours a pale golden amber honey hue with a bright slightly off white head forming thick with fine lacing. I've only had one Sahti from Tom Baker's heavyweight, never had any of the bottled Finnish versions that make it stateside. Aroma is heavy with fruit and chai tea, really tropical fruit banana and pineapple heavy in the nose with hints of citrus fruits. Flavor, what can I say I had nothing to be scared about the Chai flavor is present but it doesn't overbear the palate it's continuous throughout each sip but not off putting. A caramelized dessert banana with earthy tones juniper/clove/chai tea additions makes for a happy palate. Mouthfeel is heavy with spice finish, carbonation is natural flowing evenly body is medium to full especially with residual spices left behind. Drinkability overall impressively better than I could have imagined go for this beer I guess I'm going for the Nemaste next time I see it, because honestly this is pretty good."
"D: Very very drinkable. I'll definitely have another, if I had one of course. Very very good."
"D - This is an interesting beer. I can't see myself having this very often though."
"MF/D: epic. smooth, bitter, carbonated, dry, sweet... all at once. a symphony on the senses. thank you sir, may i have another?"
"Drinkability: This is easily one of the most unique beers I have ever tasted, quite possibly one of THE most unique. For 9% ABV, this is pretty damn drinkable. Maybe this isn't a true Sahti, but this has definitely made me more interested in a very rare style. Everybody should taste this at least once."
"I opened a bottle dated April 2010. It poured a light pumpkin orange with moderate cloudiness. It kind of looks like a Belgian pale. It smells of spicy, almost minty and has a tea leaf smell to it. I want to say it smells like tannins. The taste is refreshing and crispy, again almost a little minty. The tea flavor does subtly come through. The mouthfeel is perfect. It's sat for almost six months and drinks very smoothly. It is crisp yet doesn't seem overly carbonated. I like it and it was worth trying. I'd been looking for it for awhile and I'm pretty pleased with it. I'm glad to say I finally got to try the style."
"D: This is certainly a unique beer from DFH with lots of interesting flavors going on. Ultimately, I don't think the ingredients translate to being a highly drinkable beer as the sweetness is just a little too overwhelming."
"DFH takes chances and that is a good thing. Black and Blue is horrible (IHMO), Palo Santos Marron is world class (also my opinion). This one is somewhere in the middle."
"Going on memory on this one but I remember it quite well. It had a very spicey nose on it with a huge smell of tea. It had some chunks of whatever in it I guess because I'm pretty sure that its unfiltered. Definitely didn't take away from the beer though just enhanced the taste. No hops to speak of but then again this is one of those ancient brews that Dogfish loves to brew. You can also taste hints of the hot rocks they threw in to boil the wort. Gives it a very smooth smokey like taste which adds to the overall body of the beer. Even though its a weird style I still have to say this is an awesome beer to drink despite its 9 percent alcohol which by the way is very well masked. A great quality to most of the Dogfish Head beers. Thank you Dogfish Head! When this comes around again next year I'll be sure to give it another taste. Biggest downfall is that its hard to find and when you do its in limited quantities. Then again most of their beers go pretty fast in the stores I buy from."
"d- okay, this beer just has so many different things going on, it's just not my thing. it seems right on point with the style, just a bit too flowery for my taste."
"Cheers!"
"This is one very tasty beer. Lots going on here, but it's easy to drink. The spices blend well together. This would be a great beer with a nice spicy Indian dish."
"Overall the drinkability is good. Great aroma, great flavor and mouthfeel. The 9%abv is completely invisible. Hard to tell this is even beer. I really like it though. I wouldn't call it a ""game changer"" but it's definitely a succsessful beer from DFH. I recommend trying this and I would drink again for sure."
"D - I'm not sure what the ABV is on this, but I betcha it's high because of all the fruit and sweetness...and I can hardly taste the alcohol. It is delicious and I love it. However, it is like a party in your mouth, so I'm thinking it will kill your tastebuds after two. I'm going to try and see....it will be definitely worth it!"
"D - Exactly what I had hoped for. This lived up to every expectation I had. Chai, honey, spicy peppery tastes. Considering the abv this is very, very easy to drink."
"D. This paired perfectly with the pork belly I had for dinner. It was sweet and spicy - my second of the style and I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"D- The 9% was absolutely hidden. This is certainly a different beer. It's apparant that Sam took some liberties with the traditional recipe, but DFH produced a very tasty beer, and that's what counts right?"
"This is a great beer for someone looking for something a little different and refreshing. Highly recommended!"
"Medium to full bodied, nicely carbonated, smooth, sticky, and sweet. The alcohol is well hidden. Nicely done."
"Notes- When the rest of the bottle with the yeast was poured in, it was very cloudy as it should be, and the head went up to about an inch, and stayed that way for a while."
"D: I was impressed with this beer and quite happy with it. It was easily drinkable and disappeared all too quickly. I will definitely go and buy another."
"This is a very odd beer. The chi tea gives off a bubble gum flavor, mixing and somewhat hiding the spices and yeast flavors that are in the back. Well worth trying once, but I won't be drinking this again."
"D: I like this one quite a bit but need to share it with a few friends, so drink-ability is kind of average."
"Notes: Time to revisit the bottle, after a memory of an intriguing but just fair brew, which got pushed to the ground when we tried a fresh offering on tap recently. And indeed the bottled version is on par with the great experience we had at the ale house. Funny how the perception of a brew changes... Maybe due to recipe, but more likely due to palate and circumstances."
"Smooth mouthfeel and low carbonation. Very heavy bodied. Almost cumbersome or fatiguing to drink much of it. Nicely throat-warming."
"M/D- the mouthfeel has a bit of thickness to it with plenty of carbonation. Very quaffable in comparison to a Hefeweizen."
"D - Leave it up to Dogfish Head to go back in time and brew this beer...I was expecting something out of the box and that's what I got...at first sip it almost reminded me of a pumpkin ale with those spices...a nice beer to try especially if you're into chai tea"
"D: I'm glad I tried this one. It's definitely different, maybe a little too sweet though. Tastes a lot like black tea or chai with a fruity banana sweetness to it. The spicy aftertaste stick around for a long time. Not a bad brew, but perhaps not something I would want to drink very often."
"this is a tasty, exciting, clever and classy beverage. i might ask for it to be a touch drier. i think this might deliver what are light and lively flavor characteristics"
"D: A very interesting beer, I love the creativity and how they are always pushing the boundaries."
"D - i would say the perfect drinking size is dogfish head's bottle its just a really good sipper"
"Unique for sure."
"Funny how one of DFH's stranger looking beers is, I find, more accessible taste-wise."
"A perfect balance between malt, spice, fruit and floral flavors are magnificently build into this beer. I wish I had more bottles of it to enjoy with food. It was excellent on its own, but I would try Thai or Indian dishes, crab cakes, cheesecake or fruit based deserts with the Sah'Tea."
"Mouthfeel is good for the style. There's bound to be a thicker feel due to the turbid nature of the beer, and the carb is fine. Just nothing that enhances or detracts from the wide range of flavors. This tends to be a ""love it or hate it"" style, mostly based on propensity towards herbal beers with a different bitterness than hops lend. I find this to be a very pleasant experience, and I will continue to enjoy a Sah'tea every year."
"D: the beer actually drank quite well and was pretty complex with lots of flavor and aromas. Sahti beer style is starting to grow on me."
"Beer pours like a dark wheat beer. Slightly straw-like with a bit of dark brown to it. The smell is very sweet with a ton of cinnamon. Lots of spices and sweet malts in the aroma. Smells like Christmas! Taste is very good! I did not expect this, but this could be my 1st or 2nd place DFHead brew. Taste is so tasty. Amazing Chai flavors along with a somewhat saison type style. Very unique and tasty. I could drink this beer every night. Mouthfeel is almost perfect."
"D- not incredibly hard to drink but not one you can just throw down, I thought this was a fantastic beer, Dogfish is alway looking for more unique ways to brew beer and I commend them on another great brew"
"An interesting and enjoyable departure from the norm."
"D- For me, it's difficult to drink. The chai and spices are really overwhelming. I enjoy chai on occasion, but I think the chai + alcohol taste isn't very appealing. Fortunately I shared this with my boyfriend and he loved it. Love Dogfish and applaud them for pushing the boundaries but this one just wasn't for me."
"Drinkability is good; but that is heavily determined by your liking of chai tea and banana. If you don't like either you will hate this."
"D- Sah-tea is a fantastic brew. The style is very drinkable due it's fantastic flavor and hidden alcohol. Quite the summer treat"
"Alcohol was completely hidden in this one, which came across more ""polite"" than many Dogfish offerings. This brew didn't bowl me over with bold flavors, but there were a lot of subtle flavors to enjoy, especially on the finish."
"Overall I found this to be an interesting beer and while it's complex the flavors don't play off of each other terribly well. Still, it's worth a shot."
"It almost seemed that this was a blend between a Belgian Tripel and a German Hefe. Interesting, but not something I'd have on a regular basis."
"Drinkable, but in small doses. I'm happy to have this one, but am glad I'm splitting this with three other people."
"D - This is only the second Sahti that I've had and I'm liking it better than the last one its a pretty east to drink beer it has a good interesting taste worth picking up if you see it around"
"The body is medium-heavy, again not what I expected based on the historical production process, where lots of proteins are left in the mash giving a heavier body. This was a one and done for me, glad to try another style, and glad DFH made the experiment easier to obtain, but not something I'd reach for again soon."
"D: Very good. A tasty brew that can sneak up on you"
"D= very drinkable for a circle of friends, probably great with various desserts, fantastic with most fresh fruits. Would be great as a holiday apertif. Despite the 9% ABV this is very drinkable if it's done as a savored small glass (kolsch-style recommended) for sipping, rather than a guzzling stein."
"Another adventurous beverage from Dogfish Head. I would definitely have another one of these."
"Ultimately this beer is refreshing and different. I think I would prefer it in spring or fall, however, when I am further away from the affront of Belgian beers that bars push during the summer months. All of these other beers cause Sah'tea to lose some of its unique complexity due to the similar yeast/flavor profiles. And while this brew gets points for uniqueness, I found it tough to drink more than my first glass. Can't say for certain if it was the beer, but my stomach was hurting a little after this beer... (which I was unable to finish)."
"Not my favorite from the brewer but still interesting enough. I'm sure I'm not the first to say this about a DFH beer but I found this off target for the style but still mostly an enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability is good. Alcohol is very well-hidden. Very interesting and tasty beer."
"Poured with about a 1 finger head that quickly disappears into lacing; nice golden color. Smells sweet, and reminds me of cinnamon. To me it smells like a spiced Belgian strong pale ale. The first sip, right up front I get a ton of chai flavor. It dominates. There is a little sweetness in the taste as well, moderately balanced by bitterness. I'm having a hard time detecting other flavors because of the strong chai flavor; not that it's bad, but it does make other subtleties hard to pick out. I like this beer enough to try it once a year maybe, it's definitely very unique."
"750mL 2009 bottle into a Duvel tulip pours a hazy orange with a nice amount of floating sediment and a thin off white head that slowly diminishes to nothing. The aroma is juniper berries up front with sweet malts and just a hint of spice. The taste is a decent amount of sweet malts with a nice berry kick to it and mild alcohol. The beer is medium bodied and the alcohol has really cooled off compared to the one I had fresh on draft last spring, which was quite boozy. This is a very unique enjoyable beer, but one I likely wouldn't want without some age on it."
"All-in-all an interesting beer. Would be AWESOME if it were drier on the palate and let the spiciness dominate. Just MO."
"D-Very drinkable and enjoyable brew. I love beers with cardamom....Now that Snowbound is no more, I guess this will have to do...."
"D- This is the second time I have had this and I found much more drinkable this time around. The first time I had was the 2009 batch, it was not fresh, and I just chocked it down. The bottle I just was much better, not sure if it was a change in the brewing or the freshness."
"D - Interesting brew. I think it would be even better if the tea notes were toned down a bit to blend better with the true sahti flavors."
"D- drinkability is good. As I mentioned earlier, its very refreshing...no alcohol flavor at all. Good calming evening drink."
"D: Glad to see another DFH beer in CA. I was disappointed with Red and White, but the Sah'tea clearly exceeded my expectations. Go try this now."
"D - An enjoyable beer. Not as complex as the description indicated but still unique and very good."
"This has an interesting mix of flavors, worth trying but not as amazing as some of the other experimental DFH beers."
"D: I'm enjoying this one but I'm not in love. The spice might be a bit too much for my tastes. It's an interesting beer for sure and I think it would spark up some good conversation among beer friends."
"750ml Bottle. Pours cloudy golden/brassy with a light 1/2 inch white head. Strong Intense chai tea aroma with a hint of wheat and other spices, reminds me of Christmas for some reason. at first taste...strong chai tea spices with wheat. light body with a nice spicy finish that lingers long after. I enjoyed this a lot, def tastes like nothing i have ever had before. once again big ups to Dogfish Head for making unique tasty brews."
"I'm thinking that a nice salty meat, like a sausage or salami, would be great with this."
"d. If it wasn't for the 9% it would be perfect."
"Not refreshing like a saison, so I'll stop the comparison there. Sorry for beating that horse to death. It drinks like a European pale ale (""European"" here should be taken to mean ""not hopped to insane levels like the bloody Yanks do to pale ales""). Still, for what it is, it's pretty darn good. Tasty and historical at the same time."
"D- Great bear, summer's perfect match as it's not too thick"
"D) Interesting brew. I'd have another."
"D - A sample goes down easy but one glass is enough."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, creamy, sugary, chewy, and sticky."
"D: Goes down alright, but it's so sweet it's hard to drink fast."
"Just once, I wanna see a guy in a suit and sash proclaim, ""Hooray Finnish proto-beer!"" Yeah, not much ring to it, but still... Anyway... This guy pours a clear copper-orange with almost a finger of white bubbly foam on top. This is not as soupy as the other sahti I've had, but I think it's a bit of a step-up. The nose is loaded with different elements: cracked pepper, cardamom, coriander, tea leaves (I can't tell different teas apart by their leaves' odors, so don't ask me to try here...though the bottle indicates a black chai tea), spruce, some smoke, and a seemingly random melange of miscellaneous spices and whatnot. Damn, such complexity! The same mixture shows up again in the taste, though the tiny bit of smoke is now compeltely absent, the spruce is lighter, and a note of oak comes through. Clearly the addition of the tea mixture upgraded a (probably) more average flavor profile. The body is medium-level with a lightly moderate carbonation. It all lands very well with me; I wish more brewers would rock such a style so differently, so well."
"This beer is generally tasty, not overly complex, but I do enjoy it. I wouldnt chase around the world to find another bottle but would split one with someone if they offered it to me."
"D- Easy drinking beer, would be well with a nice dinner."
"D-Not too light, easy drinking."
"Dogfish Head Sah'tea poured a golden amber color, and there was almost no head. It had a very complex smell, with many differnt elements present. The taste was very unquie. It was full of all differnet spices, and there was an after taste of tea. It was very easy to drink, and the flavors left in your mouth afterwards were great. Overall a great beer, very differnt certinaly worth a try, even though it may not be everyones taste, and the prices was steep."
"D - Definitely a change of pace with this beer. I really appreciate Dogfish Head's efforts to brew historical styles like this. I am enjoying its uniqueness and the fruity and spicy character. Probably too much spice for me to consume large quantities of this. Much like a chai tea, I'm good after one of these."
"Notes: Actually quite good. This is one of those few beers that I think would work well both as a dead of winter drink, or served cold as a crisp refresher in summer. Definitely different than your standard beer. Keep an open mind if you're going to try this."
"D: Very drinkable, I enjoyed this beer very much, really nice flavors and all around a very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability is definitely high, but I wish I'd had this beer in the winter months. It definitely complements the season better if you think of beers that way."
"I found this remarkably familiar to drinking Chai Tea, which I am a fan of. So much so that I contacted DFH to ask about warming this up to drink in the winter. They told me to try it out and get back to them. We shall see..."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability are ok. Not much carbonation, the overt banana taste kindof prevents any enjoyment for me. Not really my thing, but it's nice to try for such a unique style."
"D/M-Good session brew. Love the flavor and is very unique."
"Easy to consume, and far more interesting the the pint glass I used, Sah'tea could easily fit into a regular line-up, even though it is very unusual. Hopefully other brewers attempt this style, so we have a broader selection to compare. There is plenty to sustain a lengthy conversation about this beer, but it goes well with dinner too."
"Drinkability: It's indeed interesting and quite enjoyable, a beer that was gone well before I had a chance to really explore all it's facets and complexities. So, I ordered a second one!"
"Poured hazy, light tangerine/nearly yellow with a short lived white head. Very floral and hint of deep herbal tones, chamomile tea and white grapes. Tangy, hints of orange, and you actually taste some tea in the finish! Smooth and well carbonated, drinks very well. I'm actually not a fan of tea but this is a very well made beverage."
"Worth repeat visits."
"D: Flavorful, goes down easily, not too filling, very deceptively strong kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you like the herbal kind of flavor."
"Drinkability: it is good enough and interesting enough to keep me going through the bottle, but I don't see myself seeking this one out again. It's just not my cup of tea."
"Creamy, soft, not quite medium bodied feel. Nicely warming - an excellent beer for Winter."
"Definatly not for someone new to craft beer."
"Sah'tea isn't the best brew that Sam has ever released, but it's definitely on the positive side of the ledger. No matter what you think of their brewing flights of fancy, the craft beer world is much better off for having Dogfish Head in it... pushing the envelope one beer at a time."
"Drinkability: Like drinking an alcoholic chai tea, it has got interesting spicing like their Midas Touch. I appreciate their creativity, but this is a bit too sweet for me. It was hard to finish this one."
"Drinkability - very nice, this would be a good beer tasting pick to open up some palates."
"Overall - This is a strange beer, lots of flavors and aromas I'm not used to in beer, I'm not sure if I will drink this again but if I do it will be in the winter. This is for sure not a good beer for summer with all those spices."
"Poured into a Harpoon tulip, formed a 3/4"" eggshell head over the clear dark gold brew. Head slowly dwindles to a small frothy layer, with thick, lasting lace. Aroma is sweet, lightly tart with earthy notes. Taste is sweet tea upfront, a shot of piercing tartness in the middle, closes with earthiness and a lingering shadow of tart. Flavors seem very distinct and separate. Mouthfeel is okay, and drinkability is pretty good as well. Interesting brew."
"Overall this was another unique and interesting beer from DogFish Head. And like many of their such releases, this is a one and done for me. Worth a Look."
"I wasn't a huge fan of this beer, but my wife really was."
"This is an interesting take on the style for DFH (isn't it always?), and I think it actually worked. Not your regular beer, but a damn fine beverage. Cheers to Eric for sharing!"
"Not much carb, pretty thick and silky. Hides the booze well, as I said earlier quite drinkable for what it is. I actually kinda dig it, would get it again."
"Poured a cloudy orange/gold body with minimal head and lacing around the glass. A citric/clovey type aroma with some spiciness and herbal hoppy bitterness. Some sour/tart fruit notes mixed in as well as some sweetness but I can only really pick out some honey although I know there is more. A complex medium-bodied beer that has a tart, sharp citric and spicy flavor up front mixed with some sweetness like cherries, berries, ginger, nutmeg, honey along with some other fruitiness. Finishes crisp and clean and the ABV complements this beer and I find that it leaves a nice mellow aftertase. I enjoyed this bottle very much."
"D - i could barely finish the bottle much less ever want another one."
"I am a chai tea lover and average about one a day so I really was looking forward to trying this beer. It does satisfy me in that the flavor components are there but I was kind of wishing for a more bold tea flavor from something coming from DFH. I am glad I tried it and enjoyed it but would recommend having no more than about 8oz. at a time. After that it becomes too filling and kind of a chore to drink."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed trying this beer but half the bottle was enough for me at one sitting. While I'll not be buying and drinking this on a regular basis, I enjoyed it and I can see serving it at a party to introduce people to the idea that not all beers taste alike. It should be a great conversation starter since it involves a modern twist on an ancient style. Verdict: tasty and drinkable but I'm glad brewing has come a long way since the days when something like this beer would have been the available beverage."
"Dogfish Head really did an impressive job with Sah'tea. This is a very unique style and DFH really got a nice end result with this one. I haven't had many Sahtis, so this is easily the best one I've tried. I really can't complain about much here. Maybe the look's just okay? Bottom line - this is an enjoyable beer. Pick up a bottle if you have the opportunity."
"This is my second Sahti to date. I thought it was a pretty good one. The appearance was a very cloudy straw, with little to no head. Smell was predominately of Chai tea, so I can see where it's used in the brewing. Taste was similar, but also some piney hints on juniper. With a 9% alcohol level, I was expecting some hints of alcohol, but there wasn't any. Def my top Sahti now."
"Very pleasant, but it's too sweet basically, and makes you wish it were more wild and gruff, because that would make it magnificently sexy. It's like making love to Anne Baxter while fantasising about Bette Davis."
"Otherwise, this is a really drinkable and extremely enjoyable brew, cementing Sahti as a style for me to seek out and enjoy. I only hope the style enjoys more of a revival - it really is a tasty and unique category of beer, and this one is a lovely example."
"The beer poured from a 750ml into my pint glass displayed a semi-clear orange color with an average white head. It had a sweet, cider-like aroma with spicy hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. No hops were present in the aroma and the malt was light. The flavor of the beer was not unlike a pumpkin-style beer with a body and slickness somewhere in the medium range. Overall, the beer had a spicy/complex characteristic while still remaining approachable. My only disappointment was the beers lack of a spruce/pine note. It could have been more present without being over assertive."
"Upon tasting, I decided that this was an awesome Biere de garde/mars. The spice character gave it a perfect play of pumpkin pie spice that I associate with NB's biere de mars and LA's Avante Garde. The juniper berry added a pleasant but not over powering sweetness. The mouth feel was light and airy. I could have drank the whole bottle over a lunch of fresh bread, sopressata and tallegio... or maybe just with some homemade vanilla ice cream?"
"D: This is only the second Sahti I've tried, but I'm getting used to them. The Sah'Tea is another drinkable beer from Dogfish Head."
"D: Between both the high ABV and robust tea flavor, this is a sipper for sure. Nonetheless, a good, unique brew that I would probably have again."
"Well, I can tell that no matter how it is interpreted, Sahti is a style that I really dig. I shared this bottle with another, but I could put one away on my own without much trouble. Ultimately, I think I prefer the more crisp, herbal Nogne O Sahti, but not entirely to the exclusion of this. I will drink it again."
"Drinkability? I'm totally mixed in my feelings about the smell and taste but one thing is clear to me. This is a unique brew and in its uniqueness, I can't see myself having this one again but I thank Jeff for giving me a chance to try it."
"I absolutley loved this beer. Had a wheat beer appearence and a amazing taste. I thought at first it may be too sweet of a beer, but it was balanced perfectly and the Juniper Berries also added a great twist. Not as off center as you normally would come to think of a Dogfish Head. Nevertheless the 9.0% abv got the job done."
"Would I buy more of it? - I'd like to have another bottle sometime, hopefully they'll brew it again."
"Drinkability: This beer is insanely drinkable with no evidence of the 9% alcohol. I really wish this beer was a great deal cheaper and in 12 oz bottles, because this beer is just too refreshing not to be drunk often. This seems like an imperial hefeweizen with a big infusion of tea and using juniper berries. It turns out to be a very nice combination."
"Spicy aroma, with juniper standing out and a little bit of yeast similar to a hefeweizen. The chai tea stands out in the flavor. Reminds me of a chai latte or smoothie. Deffinatly has a malty backbone as well that's almost enjoyable. It's complex, and yet also awkward. Not my cup of teas at all."
"Overall a good beer that is hard to see folling up with another, but with little Sahti experience on which to fall back, I take the juniper/gin-like finish along with protien rich body as givens. But it seems like more tartness (lambic) and less forced spice would have made all the difference between great Sahti's and this."
"If you can find a bottle of this beer you must try it."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a thick honey color with a small wispy white head that settled into a very light ring. The aroma is of a light grainy malt, chai, allspice, pepper and honey. Spicy indeed. The taste starts off with a sweet honey flavor, fruity, and a touch of lemon. The spices are more subtle than the aroma. The chai and pepper are there, the allspice seems to fade. Towards the end you can pick up some of the juniper berry. The feel is a bit thick in a syrupy sort of way. There is some tingly carbonation; finishes spicy, sweet, and sticky. I feel that this beer is trying to find its identity. I like most of the spice and herbal notes but the seems to get squashed by the very sweet honey malt. I'd probably prefer to see more of a juniper presence to offset the sweet and spicy."
"Nice mouthfeel though!"
"Pours with a one finger white head that fades slowly and leaves some lace. Almost clear pale amber color. Medium carbonation and medium body. Sweet spicy nose. Flavor is a sweet spices, almost like a pumpkin mousse, but if you focus the juniper comes through. Pricey but worth trying even at $13.00 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, Me"
"D: Quite drinkable. This is definitely one of the more drinkable Dogfish ""experimental"" beers."
"Feel and Drinkability: Finish is dry one this one, which compliments the spice in this brew. Body is light with higher levels of carbonation, large bubbles that don't scrub the palate but add to the feel in a positive way. I really don't think that this one could get any better in terms of feel. I don't see this as working quite as well as it does any other way. This is one that I'll have no problem to finishing and would gladly drink again. It'll just be a while. One bottle goes a long way I'm thinking. This isn't a beer that I'd drink all the time but one that would be nice to return to periodically."
"D- Very drinkable beer that has a complex flavor to think about as you drink. I'm still thinking... Will buy again..."
"D - Better than other DFH traditional ales. This does not get cloying or overspiced."
"Pours an ultra pale golden color, visibly effervescent, with a shallow white head that fades fairly quickly with minimal lacing left behind...looks as if its going to be thin. The smell is complex and aggressive with a strong Chai tea, cinnamon, nutmeg and earthy banana aroma that's quite nice. Full flavored, sweet and spicy, the taste matches the nose pretty well, but instead of banana it tastes more like a meaty pumpkin pie. In that regard, it reminds me somewhat of ST Pumking (this one has more pronounced spice to it). The mouth feel isn't dominated by carbonation. In fact, while on the lighter side of a medium body, it has a creamy smooth texture. The lingering after flavor compliments the feel nicely. This one is a riot to consider and I could easily finish the bottle, but not tonight. The 9% ABV presents a modest warmth on the way down...the affect is a notch or two below distracting. Another successful deviation by Dogfish Head if you ask me."
"Review from notes taken on: 7/17/09 at the Falls Church VA DFH Alehouse."
"D: Overall, this is not like any Finnish Sahti I've ever had. It's not sour enough, and not woody enough, and it's too full bodied and sweet - and to be honest, it tastes more like Chai tea than anything else, but OK, that said, I don't care about any of those references, and I only look at it as-it-is, which is extremely nice. It's a little sticky (not backed by much bitterness), but it balances itself out and doesn't cling to the palate. And it's totally unique. I've never had a beer that's anything like this. And I appreciate that DFH is pushing the boundaries and taking beer where it hasn't gone before. Kudos!"
"The pour reveals very little foam, OK bubbling, and an oaken stained piece piece of wood with lots of copper and amber. Pretty syrupy looking texture too. The aroma is a super chai tea with some pumkin overtones and juniper berries for a punch of spice. The abv. only heightens these aromas. The taste starts off pumkin ale and strong black tea. The middle brings the chai and juniper berries center stage. The finish warms everything up with a warm fuzzy feeling. Nice syrupy palate with lots of spices and herbs. Very unique mid-autumn evening sipper."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a fairly thick but not persistent white head. Aroma, though, is strong and distinctive with a firm overtone of juniper and hints of spices. Flavor is malty and a little sweet with a spicy undertone and more than a hint of tea along with a ribbon of juniper flavor. One might think this would taste terrible, but it doesn't at all - it's not just distinctive, it's quite enjoyable. Texture is silky smooth and just a little tingly. This beer is weird in the best way."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, high in alcohol but very much worth a try. Not worth $27+ a bottle, but decent. I may buy again someday."
"eh. to me this seems more along the lines of a spicy hefeweizen. the yeast is there, but i don't necessarily notice the presence of juniper or the absence of hops. i don't see the big deal."
"Smell was quite different from what I had expected going into this, it consists of cloves, nutmeg, honey, different fragrances that one might expect from a herbal tea, which considering the name of this offering from DFH is actually not too surprising. Moving along to the taste, it has a light and easy going sweetness to it, somewhat medicinal, in a positive nature that is. Mouthfeel is unique and pops with the plethora of ingredients contained in this sahti, which is the first beer in this style that I have sampled. It is easily consumed without the alcohol content being evident, so sip & enjoy all the different characteristics of this beer."
"Poured a golden pumpkin orange with really no head (maybe dirty glass?). Smell was of chai spices, mainly cardamom. Some juniper berries. Very inviting aroma. Taste is very complex. Some sweetness. Notes of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves in front with the juniper throughout. Tastes sort of like chai tea with a splash of gin, but in a good way. A fairly herbal taste. The mouthfeel somewhat viscous, thicker than you'd think looking at it. Good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is very good. Alcohol is well hidden and I have every intention of downing this whole 750."
"I'm glad I was sharing this pint, as I'm not a huge fan of Chai and/or spiced beers. Credit where it's due, this is a fun brew."
"taste - nice balance between the spices, malt and sweetness. This is nice. Thank God for DFH."
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a 1/2"" white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a mild pale malt scent along with a very nice Chai tea and juniper berry aroma. It's dry with an excellent herbal character. The taste is good as well. It has a really smooth taste that boasts of pale malts and herbal tea. It's rich with some floral character as well. The alcohol is well hidden in this one. The mouthfeel is great! It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a unique brew and a style I'm not too familiar with. Two thumbs up to Dogfish Head for this tastey brew!"
"D - I liked this more than I thought I would. This is quite an aromatic brew, and very flavorful as well. Sah'tea is yet another DFH creation that pushes the boundaries of what beer can be."
"On-Tap in a tulip glass. Been waiting to try this one. The appearence has a muddy yellow color or burnt gold if you will. Kind of looks like some fruit juice. Not much of a head just some fizzing bubbles. No lace either. The smell is interesting with alot of spice factor. I'm getting some tea which is apparent and juniper. I got some chai tea from the cabinet later on to compare. There are others I just can't place. The taste is similar, if not mostly resembling the nose. The tea flavor rules while the juniper and additional spices in the back. Just a touch of malt with no hop presence. Doesent taste like beer, which is fine by me. The mouth is smooth with great carb from the tap, this one is not dead, the bottles could be a different story though. I remember hating a theobroma bottle, but loving it on tap. A medium feel. If it was not for the high ABV I would drink alot of this stuff."
"A 750ml bottle purchased at Abe's in Bethlehem for about $10. Uncapped and poured into my Selin's Grove wine glass. Appears a hazed bright straw yellow color with about a finger of bubbly bone white foam. Nose and flavor consist of spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, clove, star anise, ginger, spicy black pepper, sweet pine. Alcohol is well hidden. Slick mouth feel with almost moderate carbonation. But, the high carbonation works quite well here."
"Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a smallish bubbly white head that fades to a cap. Smells of pepper, cold tea, nutmeg, and sweet malt, spicy aroma to be sure. Slight phenolic in the nose as well but not to dominating. Taste is a bit sweet with a spicy rye and pepper tone to it. Reminds me a lot of a Saison only with a spicy sweetness. The phenolic is in the taste as well, but subsides a bit as it warms. Taste is a little on the sweet side but I think that plays real well with the spices. Light carbonation, medium body, slick almost creamy mouthfeel. 9% alcohol is barely noticeable. This is yet another DFH extreme brew and I really enjoyed this one. Thanks Sam for always pushing the boundaries."
"Beer purchased at a local beer store, big 24 ounce bottle, served in a Chimay goblet. Beer is slightly cloudy, light yellow, moderate carbonation, almost no head. Smell is obvious and juniper berries. Nice flavor. Good mouthfeel. The juniper berry was not overwhelming. The chai spices are clear and build as the beer is drank. I don't have a lot to compare this beer to but its really nice. Another good (and odd) beer from DFH. Nice. Go try it."
"M&D - neither smooth nor active on the tongue, spicy and curious, each sip seems to beg for the next, its a ""why does this taste so good"" feeling, unique and flavorful, what else would you expect from DFH"
"With my lack of access to Finnish beers, I doubt I will have anything like this ever again. Given the disgusting mouthfeel, I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing."
"m/d - Big silky body, low in carbonation. A sipper for sure but refreshing and inspiring, definitely pushes the boundaries of beer."
"The appearance is hazy gold with an average head. The aroma is sweet and funky with a bit of a wild fermentation element. It does have enough malt to make it recognizable as a beer and enough juniper to make it a Sahti but the yeast makes it more like a Belgian style Lambic. I don't get much in the way of tea however. The taste is like the aroma with maybe a bit more of the tea that is not detectable in the aroma. The finish is earthy. The palate is smooth. Overall this is a very interesting beer but not one that I want a lot of."
"Eeek. What a syrupy bunch of ""not my thing"". This would be a perfect bottle to share!"
"Very flavorful body, with a golden wheatiness backed by spicy pumpkin pie middle. Ginger is muted, but the herbalness from the black tea is apparent. Slightly syrupy mouthfeel, but nicely carbonated and lighter than expected with the 9% ABV. Goes down easy for the alcohol presence, but otherwise unremarkable. Fun to try, but not something I could imagine having an entire pint of."
"D - Not as obscure as I thought it might be. The ingredients blend together nicely while maintaining their own niche. Sort of reminds me of mead. Interesting & enjoyable, though I'm in no rush to drink it again."
"For tea fans especially, I highly recommend this beer. Though at $14 per 750 mL bottle, it will remain an occasional treat for me."
"Rotation: not available here but this is one and done for me. Not bad but one is enough. No tap."
"Taste great with kettle corn. Would go great with anything sweet and spicy."
"The joy in drinking this beer was that is so damn unique. It is far an away unlike anything I have ever tasted. That alone gives it some bonus points. Plus, the booze was very well hidden and it went down with ease."
"D: A challenging drink to say the least to comprehend. Reminds me a bit of the Fantome Black label Saison and was a wonderful and unique experience that stayed interesting the entire drink. For something different this is a high recommend and something you will just have to taste for yourself."
"The richness of all the spices is kind of overwhelming, alright in moderation but after a while I feel like I've overindulged on Christmas cookies. This is one of Dogfish Head's big experiments that I applaud without really liking the final result all that much. The chai aspect is the innovation, but dominates the character so much that I'm still left scratching my head as to what sahti might taste like. I don't regret trying it, but can't say I'd drop the money on another bottle."
"Fuller end of medium body with a nice yeasty/ bread presence with a huge spice character. Lots of coriander, cardamon, pepper, lemon zest, and tea leaves. The berry presence is quite subtle, possibly because of the strong spice element. Orange and lemon peel with ripe banana and nice caramel malt balance. The alcohol is pretty well hidden considering the high ABv, making this a pretty drinkable beer, especially considering how unique and complex it is."
"This was a refreshing change of pace it had subtle hints of juniper berries and a real heavy chi tea taste almost to much to handle at first then mellowed out after drinking a few sips. I feel this beer lived up to the dogfish name."
"D: Well, its good but wierd. That wierdness factor brings down the drinkability a bit for me. I struggled with not giving this a 3.0 but my enjoyment in the experience knocked it up a bit for me. The flavors are very nostalgic of christmas in Germany for me and that gets bonus points anytime. Nose is there as well. I dig the herbal, spicy, medicinal combinations but I can absolutely see how people are thrown by it. I enjoyed it."
"Wow, this is a sweet beer! By sweet, I don't mean awesome, I mean sugary sweet. I was looking forward to trying a new version of Sahti, even if it wasn't a traditional one. Alas, this doesn't taste anywhere near a Sahti. The juniper is completely buried under an avalanche of sweet chai flavors. Taht's too bad, because its the juniper that makes a Sahti taste like a Sahti. The nose is dominated by those same notes. That's not to say I don't like this beer for what it is- which is a sweet, creamy, nicely spiced dessert beer. Very smooth, with creamy black tea notes and typical chai spices, esoecially cardomom. A little too sweet for me, even if this were just a chai beer, I'd like it less sweet. What I'd really like, though, is to taste the juniper."
"A light-medium body with no notice of alcohol in any aspect. Good carbonation throughout lends to the pleasant spicy finish. If you like Chai tea, I can highly recommend this brew...if not, hold on to your tastebuds as they're about to get rocked!"
"Overall.... I am sooo torn over this one.... certainly one of the most interesting beers I've had in a long time.. and certainly the best ""spiced"" beers I've had in a long time.. that said, I swear if I didn't already like chai.. this would be a drain-pour for me... thanks Jeremy.... truly appreciated.. another beer that I probably never would have tried to trade for but got to enjoy thanks to the good folks over at RB :-)"
"One of DFH's best experiments of all time."
"I want to warm this up and drink it in front of the fire on a cold night. Does anyone drink hot spiced beer?"
"D - If I judge this as a sahti, then I am a bit disappointed, but if I judge it as a chai tea beer then it has some potential. I can detect the chai tea character, and it is nice (it saves the beer really), but there is excessive, sticky sweetness and the juniper is missing in action. I actually kind of like this beer, but it doesn't quite live up to the late-night pun/brainstorming session that likely spawned it."
"This should be a more well known style of brew. I think the masses would like it. I know I did what an interesting, easy drinking, tasty beer."
"M/D: Medium bodied, a bit fuller than expected, slick, maybe a little oily, carbonation helps with a bit of crispness. Drinkability is decent, alcohol and bigger body than than expected makes this more than a sipper but less than a session beer."
"Overall, an interesting beer. It is a bit much on the sweet side."
"Overall I was fairly impressed with the beer. My wife is a huge tea drinker (as obsessed with tea as I am with beer) so I got it for her. I would buy it again for sure...would be interested to see what it tastes like in a year."
"pour is a mild head with a golden color with a soft murky. not as gritty as a would have expected. i could see a bit more earth. there is protein/yeasty residue. spice is nice. chai quality with a fruit both from juniper and hop. decent interaction. a tad syrupy sweet once it got a bit warm... interesting interepreation but a style that is not exactly american scope. hard to say what to detect."
"If you like Chai and juniper, you might enjoy this beer. While I don't mind either of these flavors, it can be just a bit too much at times. This is mostly enjoyable, though there is no way I could finish a pint of this, much less a 750ml bottle of it. Not bad though, and it was certainly worth trying. Ultimately though it serves as another perfect example of why brewers should learn to show restraint when using spices in a beer (I can't believe I said that after the Theobroma I just had where I decry the opposite approach)."
"Drinkability: A perfectly enjoyable and well-crafted beer that manages to hit most of the right notes without hitting any of them out of the park. I'm glad I didn't have to pay $13 for the 750 mL (and, instead, only half that price for about a fifth as much, heh), and could actually see myself having this again - it's decently quaffable and reasonably complex. Another fine ""odd ball"" brew from DFH."
"Flavor left in my mouth after resting a bit is very much apple."
"This is my first sahti-style beer, so I can't compare it at all to a traditional sahti. I would imagine that this tastes quite different since the chai tea flavor is quite strong."
"Can't saw how traditional this is, but like much DFH stuff of this caliber, it's a firm nod to tradition with something off-kilter thrown in (in this case, chai tea). It's a total success, and one I will be picking up again. Again: freaking De-Lish-Us."
"Overall: An A for effort, a Bish for not being great."
"D- For the ABV, this beer is dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is hidden very well behind all the flavors. This is one of the most unique beers that I have tried. I really enjoyed this one, it is a very well crafted beer! Highly recommended! "
"I absolutely love this beer; it's probably my favorite from Dogfish Head. A touch pricey, but completely worth, and will keep buying as long as it's in stock."
"Great stuff from DFH."
"Well, it is unique. Has basic characteristics of a sahti (a ""different"" beer on its own). This has a different twist of chai tea and booze. One of those that I can appreciate for its uniqueness, and was able to finish, but with mixed feelings."
"Drinkability: You must like spices, especially juniper, to enjoy this one. I enjoyed the beer, and wouldn't hesitate to order another one."
"One thing of note: the alcohol disguises itself very well. While the beer is listed as 9% ABV, it tastes more like a 6-7%. Well done, Dogfish Head."
"DFH you have yourself a winner here!"
"Glad I tried it, but not again."
"D: Absolutely a drink for those days where cold weather is prevalent. My first taste of Sahti, american-brewed or not, is definitely not my last"
"Notes: A bit pricey but I think well worth it. I would love to see more from this style out there. Bravo DFH!"
"D- The first glass was rough to get through so I knew there was no way I could get through the giant bottle, and I hate to waste beer. As the rest swirled down the drain the kitchen filled with an herbal Vicks vapor rub aroma. This was to medicinal and there were very little beer qualities to this drink. I brewed a Triple with Chia and it had the same bad qualities so I'm glad to learn that chia spices just turn out this way, and it wasn't my batch."
"Good carbonation, but a bit too syrupy for me. The sweetness is almost too much at times. Another nice brew from a great brewery that is willing to try that experiment most won't touch with a ten foot stir paddle."
"D - Drinkability is decent. All the flavors make this beer interesting and the alcohol is hidden well. However, 750 ml could be a bit much for one person to handle. Don't get me wrong, it's really not bad at all but this beer could be enjoyed much more if the serving size was a little smaller. Splitting a bottle with a couple friends would just about do it. This is my first selection from this particular style and it's good enough to warrant hunting down more examples. Thanks to DFH for brewing another off centered ale for it's slightly off centered customers."
"Slightly hazed, golden color-nice effervescent look to it. No real foam or lacing but a huge bevy of bubbles continuously rising. Nice sweet aroma-mildly gingery and clove like. Some honey notes. Sweet and malty up front. Honey like flavor reminds me of a mead more then anything. Nice spiciness going on. Slight juniper taste-I was expecting more actually. Nice mouthfeel though some might find it syrupy sweet-I quite like it. A decent beer. I have one sahti to compare it to so I am no expert. I like it though the sweetness might become too much for me. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability: What an invigorating, yet well thought out and well balanced beer. I love the inclusion of actual tea, it pairs wonderfully with the nice fruit undertones and that apple pie spiciness. A beer you can session in the summer, and the spiciness can even let this pass as a beer for the fall months. Along with Theobrama, DFH has produced another wonderful concoction that is another winner in my book."
"An okay beer, seems to remind me of a very sweet American Pale Wheat Ale. I'd still like to try a Sahti which is closer to the older style."
"I love DFH for their willingness to explore any style or simply create a new category, but this isn't my favorite of their offerings. Liked the smell better than the taste. Still, always nice to try something unconventional and I hope they keep expanding."
"I poured from a 25 ounce bottle into a snifter. The brew pours a clear, pale, orange with a medium white head. The brew smells really, really sweet. The first thing that hits my tongue is spice, not sure if it is the chai tea or what, but this is a spicy beer. The juniper berries lend a sickly sweetness to this and the finish is sweet. The beer is a medium bodied sipper. This is the first Sahti I have tried and I am not a big fan. IMO this one is too spicy and sweet."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. It almost passes into the realm of viscous on the mouthfeel. The beer is a monster 9%er. Inspite of ABV I think I could drink a bunch of this in a setting. Another fantastic experimental beer from Dogfish Head!..."
"Overall, This is one fine beer. I love the tea flavor and I can easily drink a lot of this. Thanks Brandon for sharing this treat!"
"Nice attempt, could have been better. In a mug the beer was an orange color with a small white head. Sweet malt aroma, tea, juniper. The taste was lacking, all I could get was sweet tea. Where's the rye and juniper? On the bland side. I really like DFH and applaud their outside the box thinking, but this was a miss for me."
"This poured a cloudy dark gold color with a bit of white head. It smelled distinctly like chai tea leaves, with some peach and honey and green banana. It tasted like chai tea and fresh banana, with orange and peach and honey, and a bit of nutty malt and bready yeast and cloves. It was fairly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this was a very interesting and delicate beer with complex flavor. It was quite unique and enjoyable, as a change of pace. It had great body and hid the alcohol very well. So it was definitely easy to drink, but quite worth sipping. I was surprised how the tea character never faded as it warmed, or as I became more accustomed to it."
"Pours a nice-looking hazy straw color with an inch of white head. Smell and taste are really spicy and sweet - similar ginger notes as the Pangea, and the chai is quite prevalent. As everyone else notes - this is quite unique. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side with medium carbonation - a sugar bomb that, coupled with the ABV, should be available in something smaller than a 750 ml bottle. Quite good overall. I appreciate DFH's effort to brew outside the box."
"ABV is very well hidden. Medium to full bodied, a little chewy, but with nicely crisp and prickly carbonation (more than I expected given the lackluster head) keeping things lively."
"This is is just ""not my cup of tea."" (I couldn't resist...sorry)."
"Overall a very interesting beer, and well-worth a try."
"D- A very unique beer that is tasty as hell. I do not think it is worth the $18+ they are charging for a 750ml bottle, but it is worth a try."
"overall a very different beer, strange taste."
"Poured a nice golden orange color with a small white head. Aroma is dominated by chai tea (nutmeg, cinnamon, corrianger) with a hint of juniper and something resembling pumpkin with a bit of alcohol. Taste is similar again being dominated by the chai tea flavor and finishes again with alcohol. Mouthfeel is near perfect as it is very creamy and well rounded with not much carbonation. Drinkability is decent due to the mouthfeel although I am not that fond of this beer."
"Didn't really know what to expect when I poured this one, first Sahti style. I know I should've saved it to share with someone else as the spices got to me after awhile, but meh. Poured the color of an IPA and the head disappeared after a couple minutes. No trace of lacing. The complex smells of honey, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, pine and a healthy dose of ginger. The spice sensory overload continued in the taste, more clove, some apricot, really floral and perfumey. The competing spices were battling each other, too many. The dryness of it bothered me. Lingering spices on the tongue and coating the mouth. Why release in July? This is a Christmas beer, cold weather, and crackling fires. That said, around that time I might just be in the mood to have one."
"Drinkability- Low, novelty-esque beer."
"This one is a far out style, and not a favorite of mine. This beer has orange gold color with a white head. Smell is heavy of chai spices. Taste is strong of chai, ginger and honey and a malt finish. The best way I could describe the feel is like carbonated tea. Nothing about the taste really makes it unpleasant, but it also isn't a taste that pushes me to get another bottle."
"D = I really like this beer, and each sip invites the next. That said a 750ml is a bit much."
"Don't drink and review."
"Eric"
"Split a bottle of this last night. Poured a soft white head which quickly faded, which was expected. Big aroma, can definitely smell the Chai in this beer, but it is not overwhelming. The spices from the Chai give it an almost pumpkin ale-like quality to the smell, but the taste is thinner. The 9% abv is hardly noticed on this, good blend of flavors on this one. I enjoyed this beer thoroughly and will be picking up a few more bottles to share the joy."
"(Enjoyed in Baltimore, MD at Max's on Broadway)"
"CHEERS!!"
"D- Quite sweet and syrupy but not too sticky. This beer is full bodied and pretty heavy."
"This is the second very sweet beer I have had tonight. Odd. Anyway, if you like spiced tea, you will like this."
"Glowing orange-yellow in hue. Berries, sour notes, oranges in the nose. Ginger, floral, citrus, and a sharp turn leading to berry, dull booze toward finish. Light bodied but packs a punch to the palate. Definitely worth trying and it went very well on a hot day. A sweet, fruit-filled treat."
"M + D: Starts with a little sparkling snap of carbonation, giving a rather clean feeling... then it fills out, becoming rather chewy and rich. It is listed as 6% ABV here, but the bottle states 9%. If the latter is the case, it's a well hidden profile. This is a very easy to drink beer, and it makes me more intrigued about the style."
"D: The most drinkable example of the style that I have ever had. Just a great beer. It is hot as hell today and this was totally refreshing."
"A definite must try and very unique."
"Drinkability: drinking this was like a chai tea and a christmas holiday beer got it on. not really something that shouts summer beer, but more of something you would see around the xmas holiday. interesting, different. glad i tried it, but i won't be making special trips to purchase this beer."
"Pours a great golden yellow color with a very minimal head formation. The aroma was actually strong and contained a very floral,spice, and hopyness to it. The flavor reminded me very much of a belgian style pale ale but the brew had allot of floral taste to it with a nice spice kick to it. This was a very interesting brew that contained a medium body with a 6% alcohol to it. This particular brew I will try to pick up again as it hit's the spot on a warm day."
"Cloudy orange colored beer with a slowly fading head.Aroma is citusy.Taste is cinnamon,nutmeg,citrus and many other spices.There is just too much going on with this.Way overspiced and way overpriced for a 750ml bottle.Something that I am sorry I bought but will not make the same mistake again."
"D: Definitely an interesting beer; somewhat like fruit juice mixed with a wild ale and the texture of a Belgian IPA, without the hops in the taste. I found myself sipping more and more just to figure out the complex flavors that pervade this brew, but this definitely isn't something that I'd want to have much of often."
"It pours a light amber/cloudy golden hue, with little-to-no-head to speak of. It's carbonated to the point of soda-like consistency--not a bad thing, but merely descriptive. The boozy aroma is very complex; hints of chai, cinnamon, nutmeg, and honey are front and forward, while black pepper and a quality I can only describe as ""tree bark"" lurk in the background. Taking a sustained whiff of this liquid gives me the same feeling I had as a child breathing in ""laughing gas"" through a plastic mask whilst awaiting a dental procedure. The flavor follows the smell, but with a more pronounced sweet character overall. The chai and sweet honey dominate. I imagined the finish to be sweeter as well, but it is nuttier and with a good deal of spiciness. What a treat! I don't"
"On tap at Sunset Grill. Pours a cloudy gold with no head. Aroma is very spicy with spruce and pepper and lots of other spices I couldn't recognize. Flavor is also nice and spicy with lots of sweet malt and honey. Interesting but the sweetness is a bit wearing."
"Pours a golden brown with a silky tan head. Nose is quite herbal and piney with some nice bready grains, spices and tea. Taste is earthy with a variety of spices, citrus and rich candy malt. Medium body is well carbonated but a little thick in the finish. Would be more drinkable if it had a larger pine presence to balance out the sweet malts. Dogfish can be a bit spotty with their more exotic offerings, but this is a well made ale."
"750ml bottle served in a standard pint glass. Bottled in 2009 indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy orange-gold with a half inch bubbly, off-white head the quickly dissipated into a few pools of foam; no lacing on this one. Nose reveals chai, nutmeg and cinnamon. Taste follows nose; however a citrus quality comes out - maybe a bit of orange peel at the back (not sure what juniper is supposed to taste like). Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation - lively throughout without any burn. A very interesting beer, but not something I'd drink a lot of - a 12oz. would have been sufficient; however, you have to hand it to DFH for always pushing the boundaries."
"The first thing that you experience after you crack open the bottle is the aroma of chai it is that predominant. The nose and the flavors make this brew. The chai eventually followed by some other wonderful spices and then juniper as it warms. Flavors on this brew follow the nose to a ""T" but it is also very complex. Like I said I was glad I split this one It would have been way to much to finish the 750 but I enjoyed every drop of my glass. The mouthfeel is great and there is a light carbonation to this one as well. I will pick up another bottle the next time I see this I was that impressed"
"750 ml bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the Sah'tea pours a hazy gold color with about an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention is good, not much lacing. The aroma is very sweet and spicy with a bit of tartness too. I can smell chai tea, coriander, cloves, ginger, honey and some lemon peel. The taste is similar to the aroma, with chai tea, honey, ginger, bananas, apricot, clove, lemon peel, smoke and ginger all noticable. This brew is full of different flavors. To me it seems like a mix between a Belgian Triple, a Witbier and Chai Tea. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit heavy/rich in the mouth and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and quite enjoyable to drink. The 9% ABV isn't noticable at all in the flavor or aroma. Overall I liked this beer a lot. It's very unique, as a lot of Dogfish products are. It's definitely worth a try, and I know I'll buy this again."
"D: This reminds me of soured orange juice: sweetness, acidity, and spicy flavors that don't seem to belong. If there was less chai flavor, it would be more drinkable."
"Overall, a unique beer that I highly recommend sharing with someone."
"Drinkability is good because it's so unique and light. It's not exceptionally good because the beer is so weird. Though you could certainly wonder about and enjoy this beer all the way thru a serving, I don't think this is one you pound in one sitting to discover (like you might an Abyss or some other complex RIS). It's no doubt another extraordinary DFH concoction worthy of any craft brew collection."
"DFH, your 750s are amazing... I've got a couple stored away and will keep doing so if they keep being this good..."
"A good beer. Like a heavy wit, but heavy in a flavor way. The ginger and some clove remind me of a Christmas ale."
"Very light in color, decent head that didn't hang around too long. Evrything I tasted still comes back to the Chai spice. It's a great flavor. very crisp and easy to drink at 9%. Very glad I got to try it. I don't think I'd always have it in my fridge, but once in a while it would be a nice treat. If you have the chance give it a try."
"It's a very strange and complex beer, but not everyone's cup of tea (pun intended). I liked it and thought it was decent, but it's not an all nighter."
"Pure white microfoam head which diminishes swiftly, thick streaks of lacing slides down quickly. Glowing golden haze in the glass, more orange bronze in the middle, widely dispersed bubbles appear throughout. Juniper, wood smoke, orange peel, persimmon to peach fruit and clove stick forceful in the nose, whereas the individual scents have considerable intensity, you're more impressed by the collective lift into a wet perfumed cloud. Full-bodied, thick foamy carbonation makes it denser and more block-like. So, while there's air pockets present you get more of a totally full sensation cheek-to-cheek. Lemon, grapefruit citrus like meringue pie, the clove and juniper add muskiness to the floral touches. Persimmon, peach, apricot, pear fruit, close to kiwi or papaya without the juiciness. The light smokiness is sweet throughout, the breadiness like a warm waffle. The sour tea leaf comes through, doesn't add much sweetness in turn. The strength in the flavors ensures an extended finish."
"Overall, a unique experience. Fun to try, but not an everyday beer that I would expect many to want on a daily basis."
"Interesting beer with interesting ingredients. Unorthodox but very drinkable. Not sure if I'd buy it again but it was worth a try."
"A: The color of wet straw, minimal head, ever so slightly on the side of opaque - 3.50, S: The juniper berries mentioned on the label dominate the nose, a slight woody aroma, what I perceive as ginger - 4.00, T: There is an unusual sweetness to the beer that I can't pinpoint - similar to pureed raisins though that could very well be the juniper, possibly a little honey in the beer??, I read that the beer was fermented with a weizen yeast and that definitely imparts some clove flavors, a touch of alcohol is evident, also a hint of wood in the beer - 3.50, M: Slightly syrupy - 3.50, D: This is my first Sahti beer so I don't have much to which to compare, but I must say I find it quite enjoyable, at the same time the sweetness factor is a little on the high side which means it has its limits in my book - 3.75"
"D - A slightly creamy/malty example w/ plenty of spiciness of chai and earthy seed like qualities. A very quaffable brew, quite a tasty version of a Sahti - I am glad I got the bottle which I preferred over the draft version."
"D- Did not like this one at all."
"D - For a 9% brew this is super drinkable. None of the taste aspects ever get out of hand (sweetness, medicinal, spice, etc.) and the ABV is incredibly well hidden, which is hit and miss with other DFH brews. While the carbonation is a little burning it never gets bloaty. I think all of us were sad when the bottle was emptied, and I strongly considering walking over the Armanetti's to get another one (until I realized it closes early on Sundays)."
"Cool label, as is expected from DFH. Pours a hazy orange brown color with a large fluffy peach colored head. Nice, lively aroma, chai tea, corriander, clove, honey, banana and a unique bitterness. Very sweet, honey notes again, some low laying smokiness, some spice, slightly bitter and herbal on the late finish, viscous but soft in body with no alcohol heat. Nothing screams Juniper except for that late bitterness, and its more twiggy than fruity. Not sure if this one was worth the hyped up waiting period, but a damn fine beer none the less. Better have friends with you if you're not a fan of sweet beers, more so picture a sweet hefe, with 9% abv."
"Ahh.. after months of waiting, Sah'tea is finally here.. By far one of the most creative, unique (though, of course, something is unique or it isn't, there isn't a gradient of uniqueness), and interesting beers from Dogfish yet.. To the extent that, assuming you've done just a basica level of research into the beer before trying it, the level of anticipation is fairly huge. The pout is a surprisingly vibrant orange with a slight whitish head. Looks sort of like orange soda (moreso than, say, dayquil) with some deeper hues in the center. The aroma is spicy, very complex. The chai has a strong presence. There is a hint of maybe smoke (from the hot rocks?). The flavor is also extremely complex. Strong chai presence (though I don't like chai tea really, and I do like the beer). A bit of fruitiness from the juniper, and a lot of complex spices in it. NOT spice like black pepper in a belgian style, just a strange tea-like spice complexity. Mouth and Drionkability are typical of dogfish ales.. Mouth is on the lighter side of full-bodied and is somewhat reminiscient of a hefeweizen (as is its drinkability). It is very, very easily drinkable. I could see drinking 2 bottles and it hides the abv quite well. All around it isn't mind-blowing but it is very good and extremely interesting. Certainly not like anything else I've ever had"
"Overall, I was slightly disappointed. Dogfish Head is my favorite brewery, but this and the Theobroma, despite the unique ingredients and history behind them, have not had the punch that their other rarer beers have. Sah'tea is definitely worth a try, especially for hefeweizen lovers, but the taste wasn't anything exceptional."
"On-tap at the brewpub, served in a small pilsner glass. Appeared a bright, but hazy, yellow with a white head. I know Sam put a lot of work into this, but to me it really just tastes like an over-spiced wit. There's a hit of sweet, fruity berries and juniper spice plus a not of black pepper, but this beer comes off like a mess and its hard to understand the layers that were put into it. For what it's worth, I'd suggest dialing the recipe back a bit and letting more individual flavors standout."
"D - I can tell this is good. I am not sure if it my stlye but good."
"First Sammy C. digs out the Old Odense Ale in a collaboration with NB. Now this. Nothing like playing old B-sides people haven't heard in a while...or ever! This is a fine offering that drinks quite well - maybe the heft and viscosity make it at least somewhat of a sipper, but it's enjoyable all the way through. Nice job."
"I liked this beer, and it is rather easy to drink. However, at ten bucks a pour it is not easy to afford."
"Light body, creamy but crisp carbonation. Very nice."
"Poured a hazy straw gold with thin bright white head. Good retention and some nice sticky lacing. Smells of fruits, citrus, wheat, honey, yeast, spices, and some musty attic. Tastes of oranges, melon, and pears up front then honey, wheat, yeast, banana, and clove along with some other spices like coriander and ginger. Some funky earth notes make an appearance before some lemon zest finishes off the flavor palate. Medium in body with great carbonation, very light but poppy. Smooth and crisp, very easy to drink, well balanced, and unique."
"Bottle this and put it in the right hands and you've got a great rival to wine for something to drink alongside food."
"PLEASE somebody tell them to put this in a champagne bottle and let us all have some more of what might be the most well-balanced thing to ever flow from our friends at Dogfish Head!"
"This stuff is great! Bartender poured it for me, kind of looked like a weizen at first. Smelled like a weizen, kind of tasted like one. I've never had a saison before. This one is really drinkable, wonderful sweet taste. Drink this one before it's gone, or tell dogfish head to make this the beer that makes it out of the Rehoboth Brewpub into production!"
"I guess I wasn't that far off."
