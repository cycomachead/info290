"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a medium size off-white head with OK retention. Aroma of roasted malt is mostly dominant with some vague spice notes. Taste is dominated by roasted malt notes with light dry caramel and some distant spices notes. Body is light with medium carbonation. I thought this was short on character and not something I would seek again."

"A very pleasant surprise for me. I will search this one out again. Great winter ales."

"This beer looks good and smells great.  Where is let me down was on the taste. While it is a decent beer, it does not taste like any traditional Sahti I have had, and I think that is what I was expecting. My wife is Finnish and every summer I wind up drinking Sahti homebrew. Arctic Circle seems harsh by comparison. Just my two cents worth, it might be a regional thing or local ingredients, but I have not had a Sahti that tastes this bitter."
""
"If this beer sounds different from anything else on the market it's because it is. Arctic Circle Ale is bound to be a true discovery for most people. A real tough one to properly assess without much experience with Sahti, the only opinions I can really share are that I enjoyed it and found it a deeply interesting ale. This one is absolutely worth the adventure and exploration."
""
"Final Grade: 4.07, a solid A-. Huvila Arctic Circle Ale is a stellar herbed beer, though having had no other sahtis I cannot provide much perspective on how it compares to other examples of the style. This brew manages to maintain an ideal balance between syrupy, malty sweetness and the spicy, herbal features imparted by the juniper, English hops and rye malt. Great stuff; worth seeking out if you are at all a fan of traditional herbed beers, gruits, etc."
"Overall - definitely a different experience than my first with a Sahti, but this is delicious, easy drinking and potent enough to warm you up a bit on a cold winters day."

"Pleasant and complex. This is my first Sahti and this is a delightful and well made beer. Interesting combination of caramel malt with a touch of juniper resin and flavour, kept in really nice balance, with some rustic yeast characters and fruitiness, apples and mulled peach, a pleasant herbal finish with a bit of a medicinal quality but artfully balanced with the lingering malt. Well-recommended."
"what a special and unique beer, tastes like some of the ones ive had done with birch syrup, but different from any beer on the market. its a deep ruby to caramel color, clearish until the yeast cake at the bottom of the bottle starts to break up and add some sediment to it, not muc light getting through it, viscous, and not much head even as i try to raise it up. where the lack of carbonation is less appealing in looks, it makes the beer in mouthfeel. love the density of it, carrying the pine notes of the juniper and the sweet malt as long as possible, and its heaviness makes it a perfect winter warmer. i really love the malt in this, its so deep and rich, caramel and toffee and butter cream (in a good way). the juniper is less intense than anticipated, especially in the nose, where it only adds a layer rather than dominating, but it does have a sappy element in the feel, which works. smells and tastes like a traditional english ale yeast, and therefore makes it seem just a little like an english barleywine in style. the aftertaste is amazing, and the more i drink this and let it warm up, the more i like it. my first beer from these guys, and one of my first from finland (if not the very first), i would love to travel here and see whats out there in terms of beer. this is so different from anything else, wonderful!"

"o: an intriguing, flavourful beer. give it a shot"
""
"Overall: great aroma, big flavour, easy drinking, and not overwhelmingly sweet when it could easily have been - could still treat this like a dessert beer though, it gives a delightful sense of sticky toffee pudding"
""
"Coffee coloured under a moderate head that settles to a full cap. Only spotty lace. Nose is all burned caramel malt, comes across as fairly sweet. Whiff of alcohol. And indeed, sweet to taste, with some sort of interesting funky, smoky thing happening. Good that way, but sweetness means this is just a one off. The smoke/funk is what I'm assuming is the juniper and that makes it kind of an interesting brew despite the sweetness. Noticeable alcohol as you go. Worth a try, but be prepared to find your way past the sugar to see what else is in there."

"Very different bitterness on this one, very different ale in general, I guess it’s a Sahti. Rye is nice, very nice mouthfeel, a bit fruity feel to it, quite a bit bitterness, but nicely balanced, and the malt gives very interesting new flavors that I don’t really resemble with ""beer"" or classic malt, but soy, maybe butterscotch, and some leather feel to it, taste is really full..."
""
""
""
"Overall a really tasty, balanced, well made beer, very unique. I'm glad to have tried it. This will never be the most popular of styles but I think it has its place on a cold day when you want something besides a barleywine."
""

"Poured a brownish body, some red tint, with voluminous head and lace and contains an aroma of some sweet malts, pick up a little rye in there, sweetness is caramel/toffee variety, along with touch of citric hops and that floral, spicy juniper smell is noticeable. Light, easy to drink body, as I get some of the rye which helps smooth it out and gives off a touch of bread and there is some sweet caramel and toffee as well. The juniper is noticeable and adds a snap to finish but the balance is there and nothing is overpowering. A very pleasant beer that warmed up ever so slightly as I ""nursed"" it."

"O: I'm definitely glad I tried this, and would suggest you do the same, but I will probably not be seeking it out in the future. Still pretty cool!"
"No head on a murky brown with golden hues body. Aroma of dark fruit, mostly fig, red apple, raisin and plum with some caramel and candy sugar as well. Flavors are a little bittersweet with more dark fruit initially including sour cherry, fig and raisin with a toffee, chocolate and caramel finish which is more bitter and sharp/tart than sweet. The base is bready throughout. Light to moderate carbonation with a relatively thick body that coats the mouth. Nice to try one of this genre from the area for which it is known. Well balanced and becomes more drinkable as its enjoyed."
"D - A big, heavy, malty beer that is bready and rustic in the way that you would expect a sahti to be. Not something I would drink every day, but well worth trying if you come across it."
""
""
"Overall: Although this is different than I expected after reading the description on the bottle, I now see what they meant. The juniper was extremely subtle, but I definitely see why this a ""winter ale"". A malty brew with a fairly light body, this beer delivers what it promises, I just wish the juniper was a bit more pronounced."
""
"500 ml bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch tan head that sticks around a little while. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is rich and malty, the brew smells like caramel malt, dark bread, herbs, and some dark fruit. The herbal and caramel flavors are strong in this brew. It also tastes like nuts, dark bread, and some dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's syrupy and slick with low/moderate carbonation. I think this is a good brew, I liked it! $8.99 a bottle, I think it's worth trying at that price."
"Beer's body is medium-heavy to heavy bodied, with medium-low carbonation, the result being a mouthfeel that is exceptionally smooth and full. Does not close dry, but there is a bit of stickiness across the palate and lips."

"This is alright, the juniper is fairly muted. Had way better & (fresher?) American versions for much cheaper"
"O - pretty good but nothing to fly to Finland for. It is refreshing and simple."
""
""
"Overall? I have zero experience with the style. My first Sahti. I think it is OK as a beer, no real idea how it rates as a sahti."
""
"Medium bodied with medium carbonation but also very smooth. Lingering finish is a little bit sweet and boozy and also a little bitter. Nice beer, very complex, different, and interesting."
"O: Very interesting flavor profile and aroma with so much of the juniper presence. The beer was easy to drink but not really something I would call sessionable."
"Conclusion: This is a pretty awesome beer. Almost all the way through the first glass I wasn't that impressed, but then the unique qualities of it began to shine out. There are flavors and feels in this beer that are seldom found. I recommend this if you are the type that is always searching for new forms and manifestations of beer."
"Drier than the smell lets on, but still very sweet. There's some nice balancing toastiness to the swallow. The aftertaste is surprisingly astringent like Gin with a mild kick of alcohol kicked in. Wonderfully different and remarkably drinkable. Full bodied with a low level of carbonation."
"Poured into a Stone Brewery flute glass. Pours a medium to dark ruddy orange amber, a half finger off-white head the slowly dissipates into a thick ring around the glass, leaving lacing. Nice aroma of caramel malt and dark fruit, reminiscent of a barleywine. Interesting mellow flavor of caramel malt, a light sharp sourness from the rye and a earthy, piney flavor from the juniper. Finishes with resiny juniper bitterness and residual caramel malt. Somewhat subdued flavor, but very pleasant and interesting. Medium to full bodied. A very nice sahti and one I hope to try again."
"Pours out a dark brown color with reddish highlights, and a light tan two finger head that has fairly nice retention and lacing. Smells of a dark fruit mixture on top of a spicy rye malt and some aroma of dry campfire wood. Flavor is gin-like from the juniper twigs at first and morphs into an earthy noble hop-spiced rye note that sweetens up in the finish to more of a standard caramel malt profile (the rye falls away from the barley), albeit with tannic and gin accents throughout. Luscious smooth and heavy mouthfeel, lightly carbonated. Truly an excellent Sahti, remarkable for being so dark and rich compared to other Sahtis I've had. This one is a must-try if you can locate a bottle."
""
"Easy to consume from a pint glass. This worked well as a sipper and equally well with a steak."
"Finish is a bit hot and pepperminty, but not really. Has that herbal spice to it. The juniper cannot be ignored"
"And the reveal is....Arctic Circle Ale by Malmgårdin Panimo. Style is actually a Sahti, not a barleywine...whoops! Very nice beer, and a Want. Definitely reminded me of a barleywine as I got a lot of caramel and toffee, and I didn't get any juniper berries at all (which is a good thing as I normally don't like that in a beer too much). Very cool, thanks Kyle!"
"Pours a one finger white head that vanishes quickly to a trace leaving no lace. Deep brown color. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Sweet juniper nose and flavor has malty sweetness with light, dry juniper finish. $9.00 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
""
"I think this is a nice Sahti-type beer. I'm no huge fan of sahti, so I don't get specially excited from this either. Sahti fans like this probably very much, that I can say."
"Medium body here and this is a mostly still beer. Very light carbonation is noticeable on the finish. A lot going on here. This is also my first of the style. This is enjoyable but I don't see how often I would want to drink something to this nature. Good for a change of pace, and I wouldn't mind sampling some other Sahtis."
""
"Pouring out like a still beer....hmmmm, wondering if there's a problem. No head at all. Got some molasses on the nose, and of all things, Brennivin (the black death national drink of Iceland). yeah, go figure. I like the flavor, but it seems muted. My second Sahti; DFH being the first and that beer was friggin over the top. I'm going to let it warm a bit and see what happens. Well, not alot of change after waiting 10 minutes or so. It's decent, and I'm enjoying it, but if I find yet another Sahti to try, I'll move on. No need to come back to this one."
""
""
"Definitely not as herbal and raw as the other that I have had. Seems more like a wheat old ale. Needs more juniper at a minimum."
"This is my first Sahti style ale but it was quite enjoyable. The flavor profiles described in the style guidelines seem to be all present in this ale. I would have like the juniper to come out a little more but other than that this beer was really good."
"Beer is nice overall. Interesting, sweet up front, a little dry on the back, almost a peat quality to it, earthiness, mild spice. A good little beer, I'd like to try it again some day."
"Poured a fairly-dart brown with a thin light tan head that receded quickly without leaving too much lacing. The nose carried a bit of juniper and darker malts, plus a faint herbal quality. Flavor has a touch of roast and some darkened malt plus juniper and miscellaneous spicing. Not over the top in any direction. Light-medium body with good carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Pretty nice brew."
"D/O- Rated to style. After trying Arctic Circle Ale, it's no wonder it's (currently) the number one rated sahti in the world. This was my only ""want"" on BA for the longest time and I just stumbled upon it at a Binny's last weekend!"
"D - It seems like every ""Sahti"" I have is quite different, and this one is no exception. Quite enjoyable, although the 500ml bottle would probably be best split between two people. If you like rye-wines give this one a shot. I appreciate the delicate touch with the juniper too."
"I'm a fan of juniper, and therefore of Sahti. Not a lot of examples around, so it's nice to find one I haven't tried. This one is billed as having been brewed with juniper branches. Pours a slightly murky brown with a medium head that fades to a thin cap. Smells malty, but with a delicate juniper note. The taste is nice. Very malty, and with a little bit of a vinous, fruity note- perhaps prunes, and a nice note of juniper. Clean and light in the mouth. Not the resinous explosion of juniper I'm looking for, but very pleasant nonetheless, and it is billed as an ""Arctic Ale"" rather than as a traditional Sahti."
"This brew pours out as a redish looking ale with some darker brown shadows in it. The lacing is pretty good. The smell is very herbal, and has a little bit of an earthy booze aroma too. The taste to me seemed a lot more like a barley wine than anything else to me. The mouthfeel was a little thick but not oily. The overall take I have on this is that it really wasn't what I thought it was going to be. Glad I tried it but found it to be a little too much for me."
"The beer pours a dark brown-orange color with a white head. The aroma is heavy on the caramel and toffee malt. I don't get the juniper in the aroma. That being said, the juniper is present in the flavor. I also get some smoked malt and and toffee, as well as a little bit of chocolate. All of the flavors meld well together and make an enjoyable beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Taste is spicy fruits with caramlised rich toast & raisin, woody-spicy bitterness with some balancing sweetness. The Spicy-woody bitterness just dominating the finish and a bit too sharp and lingering. Though fairly full-bodied with some good flavour, it ends up being almost one-dimensional, dominated by a fairly flat caramelised toast character with woody-spicy bitterness. It’s good but not great and is less unique in character than I’d expected."
"If you like rye beers or odd flavors, this one is both intriguing and well made. I'm at a loss for words to describe how odd it is, but thoroughly drinkable. It would be worth comparing with other juniper flavored beers. I definitely want to try this again, and I'll be looking to see if there are any others in this style out there."
"O- A very unique taste. Really cannot compare it to any other beer that I have tried. Might be able to drink two at one sitting."
"Verdict: decent and unique, but a little pricey."
"D: This is a solidly made, drinkable beer."
"D: The beer is very drinkable for the style because the juniper flavors do not overwhelm the palate."
"Pours a creamy brown with a tan head that turns into lace. Rich yeast, herbal aroma. Very close to a Belgian brown ale, sweet, a little gummy. The juniper twigs come through nicely as well. Very pleasant aroma. Pretty full body, very smooth. The juniper twigs really come through in the flavor, but it's definitely not a bad thing. It's almost a nice replacement of the hops, which you can hardly taste. There's a noticeable sour taste, but it comes second to the juniper as if to compliment it, very nice. It almost create its own herbal bitterness. This beer is nice because it's not a Belgian beer, but has elements of one. I definitely like this brew a lot. The Scandinavians definitely have a way with herbal drinks. Very enjoyable."
"If you can find this try it, it is awesome."
"Mouthfeel is much heavier than I was prepared for, but I enjoy that. Especially on a chilly, rainy night such as this. I have seen this before and merely passed by it. I'm very glad I chose to try it out; while definitely strange, I really enjoyed this one!"
"Everything is balanced perfectly for me and it goes down way too smooth considering the 7.9% ABV."
"Yeah, heavy, but it has all the right flavours and in good proportions. An interesting style to which I have no comparison point, but it's a nice beer anyway."
"Very interesting brew. I've not had a dark sahti before, but I can see now that it works. Sahti seems like such an odd style to me, but every time I have one I get more and more enamoured with it."
"Taste: a nice warming maltiness with more juniper flavor then the smell hints. The hoppiness tends to distract from the beer for my personal taste but an overall excellent winter beer, even if it's not quite winter yet."
"D: A bit of a change of pace for me, I haven't had a winter warmer for a while. This one was almost like an imaginary blend of Anchor OSA and the aforementioned Avery Old Jubilation, quite an interesting brew, even in the heat of late September."
"Different than I expected and much different than another juniper beer I've had. This one reminds me of a softer easier chewy porter or stout. Poured with a fine light tan head that settles down to a thin cover and some lace. Color is a a cloudy brown with dark amber highlights. Aroma is very malty with hints of rye fruit roasty and the juniper. Flavor is the same but with lots more going on. Roast comes out more. Very well balanced. Texture is like I said, chewy and full with great carbonation. Nice finish. Session."
"drinkability: good"
"D: Ok drinkability, warming with a wintery booziness and dried sweetness. Ones enough though at any given sitting. The flavor was good enough, but just about every other aspect was barely above par."
"All in all a unique concoction that has elements of some American Amber ales as well as some components of an English Bitter - all filtered through a Finnish prism. Subtle but worth seeking out."
"Dark reddish brown color and a massive dense light tan head that lasts. Light does not pass through this beer. Sweet and peppery smell. Carmel, molasses, rye, and spicey pepper (I would bet from the Juniper) are the most notable scents that I detect. Very smooth texture and nice low carbonation. Great blend of bitter spice to counteract the sweetness. Taste very much reflects the aroma. I've had these types of beers before when they were too sweet and syrupy and this beer does an excellent job of avoiding those characteristics. A little alcohol warmth is present after it goes down the throat. Very good beer. Significantly better than the last Suomi beer I had."
" D- The nice caramel flavor taste like the wort had a long boil with some nice spice finish that is not hoppy but balances the sweetness nicely."
"Unique and delicious, it's a malty winter warmer with a Sahti spicing influence. A great ""sipper"" to have on hand in the winter. Abv shows just enough to give it a warming touch that is welcomed. Look for this one for a winter treat!"
"D: I was honestly a touch disappointed when I first started this. Too fizzy and too subdued in its flavor. As it warmed and breathed; however, it got much better. Overall, it comes across to me as a Sahti/Rye Beer hybrid that's quite unique. A fine winter pickup."
"Arctic Circle Ale is damn good beer and has a Finnish sahti vibe that is irresistible. It's a sad shame that this brewery's lineup isn't more widely available (and less expensive) since they clearly know their way around a mash tun. Recommended."
"Sweet, malty and spicy with a tinge of juniper. I really like juniper and Sahti, so I just wish that there was a stronger juniper character if anything. The beer pours a purplish brown, translucent but quite dark, with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is spicy and malty with notes of hops and juniper. It's more along the lines of an English Strong Ale with a bit of holiday spice. The malt has a really nice flavor, like a good barleywine. There are fruit notes, raspberries and plums, mixed with brown sugar and rum. The juniper is light and woody. The hops (or maybe it's just bitterness from the juniper twigs) are relatively strong. There's a fair bite in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full and round. A very enjoyable little nightcap."
"M + D: A nice, full body... it's even a bit chewy. It has a bit of a thick feel going down, which is slightly exaggerated by a soft warming of alcohol. An interesting brew, though I can't quite place it into a specific style category."
"Drinkability is good here too. Even though this is a 7.3%er, it has a great finish and makes you want more right away."
"D: Very drinkable. If it weren't $11 a bottle, it would be part of my regular rotation."
"way to go, Finland!"
