"Mouthfeel is intersting. Almost thick and oily but balanced with the intense dense carbonation."

"O: Very complex and intriguing, this beer does not disappoint and is well worth the price."

"Pours a murky orange with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, earth, Brett, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour malt, fruit, and acidic flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty, refreshing, and quite sour."

"The high ABV is not detectable at all. I could see this growing on some as they drink it, but this had me from the moment I smelled it. Thank you @BourbonBob for sharing."

"very very neat beer here, unlike anything ive encountered before. apparently fermented in an old hollowed out tree trunk? thats the word, and its very cool if its true. the beer ha cloudy but bright, just darker than golden, with a fluffy and .lasting muted white head. lots going on with the nose, from intense pine tree aromas to softer birch syrup and floral notes, its different, almost ancient or medicinal or for some other healing or ceremonial purpose than beer, it just has that vibe. the flavors are even more alive than the nose, with a spruce or pine complex taking the lead, but an interesting wood profile too that isnt oak, its much more musty and less familiar. the yeast is also unconventional, not sure if its brett or not, but it definitely has some funkiness. massive body and carbonation levels makes this extremely strong beer seem like a session ale. its remarkable how much of an afterthought the booze is for me here, its just so interesting i never notice it there at all, although im not sure its particularly well hidden. i love beer that is new to me, that brings something else to the table. that reinvents what we all think we know beer to taste like. this is one of those beers, once in a life time mix of flavors, what a treat!"

"Overall, this is worldclass. Not sure it is a beer that can tickle anyone's fancy, but the use of spruce, fresh wine barrels, hops, and yeast selection make for an effervescent drinking delight. A nice sourness that can please sour heads, juicy citrus hop character that would appeal to hopheads, and spritzy body that can get the attention of cider and champagne drinkers alike. Beware though, as the spruce is definitely upfront and lends an astringent woodsy character not like oak. That is the one detail that could turn some off."

"This is a light bodied brew with a modest effervescence of carbonation. Initially this was a little hard to stomach with a borderline abrasive pine/solvent nose. But as it warmed up and breathed it really grew on me."
"overall a world class beer. ale apothecary killed it."

"O: Very unique. The flavors are well matched together."

"Overall - Easily one of the most unique beers I've had in a long time. Really good and like nothing I've had before."

"O - A ton of pine flavors form the spruce tips that were used in brewing this. Very refreshing, and even with all of the pine, I would have this one again. I wish I had another bottle to age and see how this one develops."
