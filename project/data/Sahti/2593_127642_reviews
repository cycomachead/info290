"O - My first experience of the style, but based on the flavour profile and mouthfeel, and the BA description (with the exception of ABV), I certainly feel that this brew lives up to the true characteristics of the style.  A pleasure to have had the opportunity to try."
"As mentioned, my first of the style, so have no reference point to compare, but, I did enjoy this one (and therefore has become my personal measuring stick)."

"Overall - For my first go at the Sahti style, this is definitely a refreshing brew with a pleasant juniper berry pepperiness and a spicy hop profile. Good on Wild Rose for expanding their profile."

"From my limited experience with the style (and one of them was from Dogfish Head, which, as much as ya gotta love them, wasn't all that adherent to traditional style, despite their effective marketing to the contrary), it seems like the fictional (?) Albertan Midnight Son did well in dredging up the goods in Suomi. What comes after that is simply a pleasant assembly of the constituent ingredients, and a small ticker's orgasm can now be heard murmuring across Wild Rose's distribution area."

"Gotta give Wildrose props for trying new things and this was an interesting brew that left me a little confused. I'm going to remember this one because I've now tried every style of beer listed on BA, it could be a world class version of a Sahti for all I know."
