4,2.8,,,,,,"O - My first experience of the style, but based on the flavour profile and mouthfeel, and the BA description (with the exception of ABV), I certainly feel that this brew lives up to the true characteristics of the style.  A pleasure to have had the opportunity to try.","andrenaline","Sep 04, 2014"

3.77,-3.1,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall - For my first go at the Sahti style, this is definitely a refreshing brew with a pleasant juniper berry pepperiness and a spicy hop profile. Good on Wild Rose for expanding their profile.","leaddog","Jul 21, 2014"

4.01,3.1,3.75,4,4,3.75,4.25,"From my limited experience with the style (and one of them was from Dogfish Head, which, as much as ya gotta love them, wasn't all that adherent to traditional style, despite their effective marketing to the contrary), it seems like the fictional (?) Albertan Midnight Son did well in dredging up the goods in Suomi. What comes after that is simply a pleasant assembly of the constituent ingredients, and a small ticker's orgasm can now be heard murmuring across Wild Rose's distribution area.","biboergosum","Jul 11, 2014"

I'm going to remember this one because I've now tried every style of beer listed on BA, it could be a world class version of a Sahti for all I know.","wordemupg","0"
