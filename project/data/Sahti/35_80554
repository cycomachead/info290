Taste is malt and tart to start fading to a malty coffee like after taste. Very thick with little carbonation it drinks smooth but leaves a thick chewy feel.

3.4,-3.4,2.75,2,4,3.5,4,"Me and my friend were required to brew a Sahti for a home brew competition we were entering, so we saw this on the shelf and decided to give it a try. I must say I was pleasantly surprised as I thought this beer was going to be awful. It pours in a dark gold murky color that is somewhere in between good and ugly. I really did not like the smell it was funky as hell. Medium-low head which is actually too much head for this style which is supposed to be served flat. Taste was of malty juniper with maybe a little spice from some rye grain. It was surprisingly refreshing and left a clean feeling in your mouth. This beer goes down super easy for something with a 7% ABV. There are some subtle hops detected, i think a noble verity, which I enjoyed and obviously increased the shelf life but again traditionally there is supposed to be no hops and the beer drank within a month after it is brewed, but I realize that would be a money losing endeavor for anywhere outside Finland. Also I think the flavor got better as the beer warmed. Give this beer a try it is totally different and pretty good.","vicg12","Jun 15, 2014"

Deep clear reddish brown with a huge off white head that takes forever to recede. The aroma is spicy, no shit huh? It doesn't strike me as much different from a Belgian strong dark honestly. Dark caramelized and brown sugars with some dark fruit and a virtual spice rack of aromas that range from nutmeg to coriander to mint. Juniper berries perhaps? The flavor is rich and malty with lots of dark sugary flavor. There's an earthy spicy woody component in there that I can only assume comes from juniper somehow. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet light syrups mouthfeel. Not a bad brew, but honestly not my cup of tea.","johnnnniee","Apr 26, 2013"

Creamy medium body, nice carbonation. Overall it's different, but better than expected. I've only had 1 other Sahti to compare this to, so it's a tough style for comparison purposes. As a beer, it's weird but not too bad at all. I've got friends in Finland, so I was very interested in trying this one.

4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; Batch 1, bottled in Spring 2012. Moderately fast gusher upon opening. Pours lightly hazy red copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, juniper, raisin, wood, floral, earth, and herbal. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malt and juniper notes. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, juniper, wood, raisin, floral, earth, grass, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, floral, earth, raisin, wood, juniper, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malty flavors with the juniper notes; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium full bodied; with a very creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice take on the Sahti style! Great malt complexity and balance of juniper flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. I really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Jan 30, 2013"

If I read the Beer Advocate description is has some features of the beer (mouthfeel, juniper) but not others (turbidity in appearance). So let me instead state what I think of this as a beer. The Juniper works well as a hop substitute, although there are times where I think I'm drinking a beer spiked with Gin. Could be I'm not a big fan of Juniper. Nice looking beer, feels good going down....not really great in taste and smell. Interesting yes. A great beer? No. Drinkability - I could not finish off the bomber myself even over 2 hours (corked the bottle and kept it in the fridge while I finished the first glass) and so one big glass is more than enough. I think I would give the style a try again, but with food, and not this particular beer again. A good beer to try, but not good for a repeat.","damndirtyape","Dec 16, 2012"

I'm not saying this is a bad method, because I'm sure it is much more conventional for mass production, but I look forward to trying a more traditional Sahti, someday. I like Norse Legend. It is nothing spectacular, but it is a fine tasting beer.

The nose comprises a spruce-tip sandwich, all white bread, with only a leaf or two of lettuce separating the other ingredients. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the spruce is in resin form as well, the bread is slightly drier, the lettuce is straight iceberg, and what seems like a bunch of juniper berries finds its way in there for good (?) measure. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, this doesn't come off so much as a sahti to me, rather a spruce-flavored amber ale or something.

The peppery sensation lingers in the aftertaste, as does the tartness. The beer is smooth and goes down easy. With a better taste, this could be an easy drinker.

I wrote this review with a C-average in mind, so my final score indicates that this beer is just beneath average– in my mind, not as bad as it may look when compared to its other scores.

The taste is really quite similar to the nose, with the malt and yeast base tasting rather similar to a sweeter Boston Lager, but with a lot of juniper and rye coming in and bashing around the tongue. The finish is a bit rough. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is about average. It's another interesting entry in the Sam Adams small batch series.

3.41,-3.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A medium-bodied beer, it lacks many of the characteristics that are common in Finnish sahtis: the hazy orange or deep yellow color, a slight sour note, a more detectable rye spiciness in the grain bill, and a stronger juniper aroma and flavor. Again, malt sweetness dominates, with a whisper of juniper in the finish, especially as the glass warms. Hallertau Mittelfrueh hops offer a welcome, if atypical orange rind quality to the taste. Well made for sure, but slightly disappointing for lovers of sahti.","Keene","May 24, 2012"

4.06,15.3,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Essentially Norse Legend drinks like a really well-made red ale with some herbal, primarily juniper, elements added it. For those of you in the Boston area, there are some overlapping features with the on-tap-in-Boston-only Boston Brick Red, also from the Boston Beer Company. Norse Legend is a very well-balanced beer that has taken a rarity in the beer world and made it into an immensely drinkable treat. It’s quite enjoyable and would be appreciated by a variety of beer drinkers. This is a beer worth your time.","Eddxii","May 23, 2012"

3.41,-3.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-brown coloring with a frothy, light, low profile, off-white head that slowly settles into a filmy coating. Aromas of roasted caramel and maple sweetness, with some citrus and fruity highlights and a woody, earthy tone throughout. Flavors are rich and malty, with a caramel and chocolatey backbone giving rise to some roasted and earthy characteristics, as well as a bittersweet fruit highlight. Solid, smooth bodied with a roasty and sweet fruit aftertaste. The finish is light, but solid, with some green and earthy character giving a linger on the tastebuds. Interesting brew.","GarthDanielson","May 21, 2012"

The undertones make this beer very refreshing. This would be a great beer in spring or summer and I would definitely go out of your way to try this beer.

3.35,-4.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer is certainly different and it is also reasonably tasty. But it perhaps isn't a great Sahti. Instead of tasting like a juniper-preserved rustic ale, it tastes sorta like a top-notch Amber Ale with significant botanical adjuncts.","Reaper16","May 15, 2012"

Tastes like tea but not as fruity as the aroma but more of an earthy tea flavor. A bit floral. Peppery. Light mouthfeel. I know its not a high ABV but this doesnt really taste all that boozey. Almost tastes like drinking peppery Iced Tea. I like tea so this one is ok by me but it might not be for everyone. Overall, I would drink it every so often but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it.","PicoPapa","May 01, 2012"

I have not had very many authentic examples of this style but it really doesn't taste anything like I think it would. Not very piney at all.","jneiswender","Jan 16, 2012"
