"Body seems rather thick to me, quite smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation and a malt-forward finish. Here's where I get some caramelized rye. Its an interesting brew, to be sure. Wickedly different from Wild Rose's recent take on the style (brewed with weizen yeast for a radically different flavor; insert cross reference here) and I am left wondering if anyone here in this country truly knows what a sahti tastes like. I certainly do not, not with any real degree of certainty. Doesn't really matter, if these attempts enrich our beer scene."

"Pine was immediately apparent, but melded nicely. Looks great,smells great, tastes great.  I don't think I'd call it a Finnish Sahti though...West Coast?"
"Tasty winter brew. Building bitterness. Spicy nose. Malty and Spicy body. Solid beer."
"If juniper infusion (be it berry, twig, or leaf) is what it takes to be a veritable Sahti, then a veritable Sahti this is.  More west-coast IPA or ESB (I know) in its overall bearing, the extra ingredient is like the pea to the storybook princess - not all that detectable at first, but somehow you just can't help noticing it after a strangely short amount of time.  Worthy of checking out, if you're into what native Suomi are all about."

"Sahti was the last style I tried on BA and it took me over 5 years to find my first and only a couple months to find a second, both were from western Canada strangely enough, I'm keeping my eyes out for a classic Finnish version"

"O: Good beer, well-balanced, the juniper really works well with the hop flavor. Not much malt flavor in there which is fine, it seemed a little light for having 7.7% alc."
"Not a typical Sahti , this is a hopped up PNW version of the Finnish style. The higher ABV and the big hops make this taste more like a DIPA. The juniper comes up in the nose and the finish but mostly this a tasty IPA that has some darker undercurrents from the Sahti profile."

"I'm sure it is not to style.  But, the original style is normally infected and brewed with juniper branches.  So, given that, I say this is a well-done beer."
