3.79,0,,,,,,"M + D: A lighter-medium, sparkling body, with a refreshing, semi-dry finish. One of the better offerings I have come across from South Street in recent memory... it's a shame it is a seasonal offering.","Proteus93","Beers"
3.56,0,,,,,,"Drinkability: An interesting beer, very different from what I remember. The juniper is much more pronounced here than it used to be (at least, IIRC), and it's an interesting tasting/smelling combination, if not crazy complex/balanced. Glad I gave it a shot.","CrellMoset","0"
