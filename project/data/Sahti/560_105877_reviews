"Overall - I had to drink this in about 10 minutes so while it wasn't enjoyed to the fullest extent, it was definitely a brew I would purchase again if accessible. I also had no idea what is was when I purchased it, but was intrigued, so this was my first foray into the sahti style."

"O-One of the few commercially available examples of Sahti available outside of Finland, this beer is based on a shared style brewed in Finland, Gotland and the Estonian island of Saaremaa. The name Kodu√µlu mean literally homebrew, which is synonymous in the Baltic and Scandinavia with farmhouse style beers, which showcase bold and funky flavors. Many of these beers incorporate juniper, but not all. This was a pleasant and mild interpretation of the style and very approachable for someone not used to these beers, without being dumbed down to the point of being unrecognizable. Overall an excellent beer and possible Sahti gateway drug. Drinkers will eager to explore this style more!"
