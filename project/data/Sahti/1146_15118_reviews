"o - Overall a pretty solid, interesting beer. I don't think this is my favorite style, but out of the 4 Sahti's I have tried so far this one is probably my favorite; I liked it much better than the DFH one. Lots of sweet fruits and spices, it is an interesting beer worth checking out."

"On-tap at the Clybourn brewpub, although I think it was more of a 6-7 ABV? Clear amber, nice finger of foam, good lacing. Nose is grain and very present juniper, which is also present in the taste--it's like a wonderful gin-rye-beer-sour hybrid. Tart on the finish. Medium carbonation and a slightly slick mouthfeel. I've actually never had this style before, so I don't know quite how to judge, but I would definitely have more Sahtis if I saw them."

"Not enough sahtis out there. Seriously. This one pours a clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, vague wood, and sour rye bread. The taste holds notes of biscuit, rye spice, light mint, juniper berry, and light balsa. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an oily feel. Overall, a very nice sahti, one of the more enjoyable examples I've had in a long time."

"O: I'm always pumped to try a beer in an out-of-the-ordinary, out-of-the-everyday style, but this one illustrates why the Sahti style hasn't caught on. GI should go back to the drawing board and make this brew a big FU to the man: ""You may not like this beer, but your palate will certainly remember how it was wrecked by our draconian spice bomb!"""

"Lightly tart with mild astringency that suggested apple, very crisp with ample carbonation. Vague spice that seems derived more from rye than juniper. Nice and crisp feel, the overall simplicity and easy drinkability begs for warmer weather. It would have been better with more noticeable juniper or some level of herbal presence."
"Overall: A great change of pace."
"To much tea for me to make it drinkable. What some would find refreshing I find as medicinal."
"The feel of this beer is light and goes down smooth. There is a bit of a dry feel to this beer that is an interesting feature but leave my mouth a little flat. This would go well with the properly paired food that might compliment this beer well."
"Pours a kind of clear straw yellow color, a very thin head, leaving almost no lacing on the glass. According to the style description - this isn't very accurate, as far as the clarity goes. But otherwise, just looks like a pale lager or something. I think some kind of spiced ketchup was interfering with my sense of smell, because I was smelling pumpkin pie spice on and off, I think I'll write it off as something in the room because when I tried, I could only smell the beer. I mostly get a kind of herbal smell, with quite a big pilsener malt backbone, but also a bit of caramel smell, or toffee, like little suckers, whichever kind they are - a big sugary if you ask me. Almost not tartness is detected here, which I would expect, and very little juniper, apart from the kind of light herbal, woody, floral smells mentioned. This isn't too spicy in the taste, but I get it as I pull the glass from my lips, a kind of sticky, woody, kind of spicy taste. The malt has a pilsener taste, no hops, no bitterness, just sweetness. There is really nothing exiting about this, and I can only hope that it isn't an accurate representation of the style - I mean, it doesn't need to be exiting, but it shouldn't taste like some kind of an imperial lite beer (which it kind of reminds me of). The mouthfeel is pretty nice, kind of a good balance between thin and full, like a more syrupy verison of some very light adjunct type lager. There's a nice bite of carbonation, which may be about the most interesting part of this. And it drinks kind of refreshing and light, but there is very little of interest in here. I was exited to try a new style, but I highly doubt that this is accurate. I wouldn't try it unless it's your only shot. It's like a summer beer without any wings - not a sahti, according to what I've learned about it, at all."
"a golden yellow color with a mild head of white. an odor of a very large amount of protein. yeast. almost like burn hair but obviously not on that scale... or that displeasing. palate is quite yeasty and a juniper fruit sweet. the beer is also earthy as well. a musky twig quality... something i find quite interesting. but the protein make the earthy seems like biting fingernails. this is a very interesting beer. something i have to drink up on a bit more. the protein doesn't seems to make for a hardier beer but something more biological in this case. i will have this again in a few month in the face of another of this version."
"Light to medium in body, very refreshing and easy to drink, worth a revisit if I have a chance."
"My wife just tried some of this and reminded me that I have had this on tap at Goose Island Clyborne 6 to 7 or so years ago; the juniper character was more fresh then, and there wasn't any real tartness to that beer (if my memory isn't failing me). Still I like the extra tartness in this beer, it is a nice, clean sourness and it goes well with the rest of the beers character. Perhaps not the most complex of beers, but it is certainly tasty enough; this would definitely be a great hot weather beer."
"D - I was hoping this would be a bizzaro brew, but it really isn't. This could be marketed as a light and slightly fruity beer for the masses."
"Sahti is fine. Nothing really bad about it, but its not entirely interesting either. I can't say that I'll be looking for it again, even though there is nothing to complain about."
"D: Very enjoyable and dare I say sessionable? When I first tried this years ago, I remember it being very harsh and prickly. Maybe my palate has evolved, maybe the beer has...more than likely it's a little bit of both. I will revisit this on draft at Clybourn."
"I really enjoyed this beer, it is very drinkable and pretty light, but has a good amount of flavor; enough to make me want more."
"Update: June 2009 - new brew, the nose is still fresh and spicy, with the juniper still there. But the taste of this one is quite sour, not as balanced this time. Lower the taste score by 1/2, some less drinkability as well."
"drinkability is good. there is a solid grouping of flavors and aroms here, which results in a brew bolder than most others this light. cheers!"
"Very drinkable, but I wanted this to be more interesting than it was."
"I got this beer on tap and it came out a translucent, tarnished gold color with a thin white head that didn't really stay. Aromas were piney and yeasty. I thought his was a very interesting brew, but didn't taste much like beer. It tasted much more like white wine to me. I would liken it to a big fat chardonay that has been hopped or otherwise bittered. I definately tasted the juniper, but it didn't really jump out at me. Mouthfeel was a little flat and thin. I sucked this down quickly."
"Drinkability - this is good, but not great, which holds down sesssionability for me, but I'll visit this from time to time."
"D- This beer is unique and interesting but that is what I would expect from a traditional Sahti, not that I have had very many. The pine and juniper flavors had an interesting quality that comes through more in the cask than in the keg. It is possible that the sweet and tart notes were off flavors but I think they gave more depth and interest to this mysterious style and I think they were designed in the beer."
"This incarnation was 6.2%, served in a tulip. Pours a hazy golden, medium white head forms, good retention and some lacing. Smell is sweet, lots of rye and berries, wheat, pretty mild but neat. Taste is nice and malty, rye has a strong presence, grainy, with citrus and juniper berry in the finish, finish is slightly bitter and has a bit of sourness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with medium carbonation, very dry beer. I enjoyed this, on the lighter side tastewise but an interesting and tasty brew, would try again."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for bringing me a growler of this one. Pours a golden color with very little head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is packed with rye notes. Slight juniper aroma as well, but the rye is everywhere on this one. I don't care much for the rye/juniper mix. The flavor was just as the nose described. Lots of rye with hints of juniper. I didn't enjoy this one very much."
"Grabbed a growler of this for clvand0 and he's sharing. The beer pours a very slightly goldened yellow color with minimal head. The nose is full of rye spiceyness and juniper. We made a homebrew over the summer that had juniper in it, so I've been exposed to it. The flavor is definately different from anything I have ever had. Definately a lot of rye flavor going on in there, it has a slight sweetness on the swallow, and the juniper hits on the finish. Hmmm. Interesting. Never having had a Sahti before, I'm not sure what to expect or how this stacks up. The feel is shy of moderate. I think the flavors keep it from being highly drinkable. This would be a good beer served in 10 oz glasses. Definately not a beer if you don't appreciate the rye."
"Pours dark golden with very little head and no lace. Aroma is pale malt, very faint citrus hops notes and a slight hint of the juniper berries. Taste is a bland pale ale with just a hint of the berries. I've had this in past years and it was excellent but the 2003 batch just isn't very tasty. Taste is somewhat dominated by the rye malt used. Very dry finish and low carbonation makes it very dull in the mouth."
