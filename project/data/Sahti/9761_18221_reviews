"This brew poured out as a flat looking amber color with no head on top at all. The smell of the beer was herbal with some other odd aromas coming off of it. The taste is interesting, lots of herbal juniper flavors and other things that I can't honestly say I've tasted before. I can't really describe it. The mouthfeel was flat and rather bland. Overall I think if the carbonation wasn't so low on this one it'd be easier to drink and more enjoyable all around."

"Anyway, good and interesting."
"Served with a large bubble, sudsy head the color of the brew which was a hazy dark amber. Aroma was spice, licorice, malt. Flavor is similar but butterscotch is present also. Plus a bit of tang. Body and carbonation are true to style. Finish is like flavor and quite long. Seems to be what a sahti is all about except for the butterscotch which I’m not a huge fan of."
"On cask at the One Pint Pub. This is a 2 day old cask straight from the Lammin brewery. This beer pours a murky brown with almost no carbonation whatsoever. The owner of the bar (and one of the brewers of the beer) explained that traditional Sahti should have almost no carbonation. The aroma contains quite a bit of banana, caramel and just a slight bit of juniper berries. Also just a tiny tartness is starting to come through on the backside of the aroma. The flavor is a banana bomb. Wow, I always thought that juniper should take the first seat but in this, it’s definitely banana. Juniper comes through with a bit of caramel. The tartness is a bit more pronounced then in the aroma. For as much emphasis as the brewer put in telling me that it is fermented with bakers yeast and not brewers yeast, I really don’t taste that much of a difference. Overall it’s a bit to much banana for me. I wish the juniper was a bit more pronounced but it really is a experience to drink 2 day old cask Sahti"
"O/D - Not a great one by any means. Mouthfeel is weird and too light. Seems like it should be a little syrupy but it comes as watery. Taste is too mild IMO. Wouldn't seek it out at all and probably not a good example of the style."
"Reviewed on 12/31/2009. Bottle from Ginger Man. Pours a brown/amber with no head. Aroma is stewy with chestnut, pepper spices, and sweet apple. Flavor of lots of spices and some light fruits in the background. Rather quaffable. I rather enjoyed my first authentic sahti."
"M - Flat, uninteresting, a little oily."
"D: Not the most drinkable Sahti ever. Lacking in most departments."
"NOTE: Someone mentioned a freshness date in their recent review... I was not aware of such a thing, and unfortunately, my bottle was promptly disposed of at the bar where it was served... but I must assume that the beer I sampled was far-beyond the recommended freshness date."
"Overall this is probably the most authentic sahti I've had (the other being Nogne O's interpretation). It's certainly not a bad beer but it's an obscure style for a reason. Worth a shot for the curious."
"Pepper, juniper, and what I can only describe as pitch dance across your taste buds in the finish, while a pleasant tartness clings to the roof of your mouth long after you've drained your last swig of this rustic brew. A good example of a unique style."
"D-The lack of carbonation takes away from what is a really interesting beer. fun to try."
"11.2 ounce bottle, $4.99 @ DeCicco's in Ardsley NY, they said this only has a shelf life of about 2 weeks and they had received it just a few days ago. Pours murky, darker brown, next to no head, no lace. No carbonation, no bubbles, no nothing. Interesting nose with notes of spruce, mint, bubble gum and white wine. In the mouth the lack of carbonation is quite evident, notes of jam, more spruce, mint, white wine and bubblegum. A distinct sour notes come through loud and clear as it warms up a bit in the glass. Quite dry in the long finish. Interesting to try but I highly doubt I would reach for this one again."
"My first of the style. I was told great lengths were engaged to keep this cold in transit as it goes bad quickly. Guess i have to drink it right away. An interesting look. Like an orangish ice tea. Some bubbles on the top. Quite cloudy. Smell is sweet and bubble gum like with a hefe like wheatiness. Taste is much like a flat hefe with a thicker feel. Banana and clove with a wheaty twang and more bubble gum. Some alcohol as well. There is a light tingly carbonation as it sits on your tongue. Still this has a somewhat syrupy feel to it. Goes down pretty nicely on a cold winter night. Not bad. Not what you think when you hear beer but not bad at all."
"For $6 it was a bit of a novelty and a letdown."
"Dark ruddy, muddy, orange brown. No head to speak of. Looks like darty swamp water in the glass. big ginberry junipero in the aroma. Juniper and spiciness, berries, and almost a suica like alcohol presence. Tasteis similar a bit hot, refreshing, cool, and unique. Twigs, berries, and other interesting flavor hints are there. Mouthfeel is a bit muddled and drinkabilityis decent, but I would not have this style consistently."
"Mouthfeel is quite syrupy. It is very fruity sahti with some traces of bakers yeast. Finish is bit cloying. Still it makes you want to have another sip."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Thanks MABZ!!!"
"...and as such, I rated the mouthfeel and drinkability quite low. The mouthfeel is, as I mentioned earlier, puckery sour. It finishes mildly dry, but the alcohol is not detected, nor is a noticable hop bite (I don't know if this style of beer even uses hops, as a matter of fact). I will probably try to seek this stuff out fresh if I'm ever in Finland, but if not I'll probably have to pass. I am very glad that I was able to endure this fearsome beer, however. It definitely worthy of seeking out for you lambic heads and otherwise exotic beer connoisseurs."
"I have to be honest, I would love to get my hands on this beer fresh as hell. As it was I recieved this from Mentor who tried it in Feb so who knows how old this really is now. That being said underneath all of the funk is a beer that had fresh I am sure it a thing to behold. The color on it is like store bought Ice Tea mixed with a little OJ, no head or lacing and hazy as hell with lots of yeast sediment. It smelled of citrus funk. My first taste was like biting into a fresh pinnaple, it hurt and then smoothed out. I drank this beer slowly and as it got warmer more flavors evolved. I could taste the pineyness mixed with some spice that I have gotten to know as rye, the citrus flavor is like lime and pinnapple and a little tangerine, the funk is all over this beer. It has a solid body despite all the funk and is not overly carbonated. Cold and fresh is probably the way to drink this beer. If I had this not knowing what I was drinking I could be in a world of taste bud hurt."
"Hazy, coppery tawny-gold in hue, the liquid has a lovely tint to it. The head was white and active; at the apex the foam reached a short-lived half finger in height. In a loud moment the head faded to a fairly thick, bubbly collar. Animation was passing which might help explain the head development or lack thereof. The subsequent lacing was very spotty; I can count the residue clumps on one hand. Overall the appearance is admirable. The nose is amazingly rustic. Lammin Kataja Olut smelled nothing like this, I liked the ale yeast better than the bakers yeast, at least in the nose. It starts off raw and pungent with minty with methanol qualities that are very loud. Decayed leaves. Barnyard funk. Grass. Hay. Pine needles. Melon. Juniper. Apple vinegar. There is so much going on here, it is very complex and, frankly, overwhelming. The potency is high. The combination of smells is scary. This beer is some hardcore shit. I cant call the nose inviting. I fear this beer and Im not ashamed to say that. The aromas are so far advanced over anything that ever came out of Belgium. Think of the funkiest, tartest Lambic youve ever smelled, Lammin Sahtia outshines it, hands down. However the bouquet, in the whole, is not put together all that well. The palate is an odd mix of flavors, just like the nose. The acidity is massive and it reaches the belly and starts churning away. Upfront is plenty of sweetness but the puckering tartness, raw juniper twigs, and leaves, decaying fruit/grass/hay, overwhelm this by the middle. Overripe melons. Mint at the finish, methanol and sour cherry candy. And then comes some red apples and cider vinegar with a kiss of citrus at the very end of the sip. The aftertaste is tart and warm with hints of orange peel and horse blanket. If you have grown tired of Lambic and you find even the most adventurous Belgian creates tame now, you must drink this beer. It will blow your mind. I cant solve this beer; it is like staring at a MC Escher drawing. I take a sip and think about it. I detect more feelings that flavors, maybe I can recognize the feelings easier. After I swallow my throat becomes raw and I feel like I have the onset of heartburn. My mouth feels sweet like I was sucking on cheap fruit candy but sour like I had a Sweet Tart. There is acidy like really raw lemonade. And then there are all the organic flavors that baffle my brain because they dont belong, in anyway, to the previously mentioned categories. Im worn out. Medium in body, moderate carbonation, but at no point does that negate any aspect of the mouthfeel (or help either), if fact the mouthfeel seems very sturdy. At this point of my review I like to add a food pairing not for this review. I cant think of anything that could hang with this beer. Funky cheese? Maybe. I didnt find this beer to be drinkable. I respect it thoroughly. I loved Lammin Kataja Olut and I would drink that again in a heartbeat. I cant say the same for this Sahti. Maybe Im not worthy. Maybe I need to try this beer again. I dont know if Im that brave. I purchased this bottle (from a cooler) in Iowa City, IA. It is worth a try, for the novelty of it."
"Unusual and different. It gets better as it warms."
"11.2 oz bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) in Feb 2005 and consumed that same evening. No freshness date, which is a concern because Sahti is suppose to be served fresh (well, that's what the BA article says). Pours thick with noticable sediment flowing into the glass. Cloudy and copper colored, in fact, it looks exactly like fresh pressed apple cider. No head formed, only a small ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Noticable piney, yeasty, and fruity notes eminate from the glass before I even lift it for a sniff. Smells...whoa...FUNKY. Belgian funky (like beire de garde) with citrus and apples. Some alcohol can be detected with searching. There are many many other scents in here, some of which are familiar, but which I can't put my finger on. Incredible depth in the smell...I hope the flavor holds as much character. Tastes sour tart fruity early on. This settles into a slightly less tart citric and cherry and ends with an interesting woody and pine needle character. At this point, a stable (neutral?) yeasty flavor rises up to add a new dimension below the tart and the pine. Very interesting. The aftertaste is yeasty, apples (like cider that's just beginning to harden) and faint pine. Carbonation is low, except for a strong burst of fine and acrid bubbles on the flat of my tongue as I prepare to swallow. Whoa, the sour beer and acrid carbonation make for a potent explosion. While sweet, this beer is quite dry. Later tastes, as the beer warmed, allowed the piney character to be detected earlier and the aftertaste became less pleasant. My mouth is getting tired of this beer...there is no way I can drink the other Sahti I purchased this evening. Imagine a very tart lemonade on a hot summer day. How refreshing that first cool gulp is, but how old that gets in a hurry. The mouthfeel is really thick and I felt small chunks of debris on my tongue, too. I'm glad I had the chance to try this beer and look forward to trying my other Sahti tomorrow (Kataja Olut)."
"Definitely one of the most unique beers to hit my palate, and once you get past the initial shock of something so different, it really does grow on you. And those there's Sahtis brewed outside of Finland, maybe are merely interpretations and not really Sahtis. Fantastic, but not for those without an open mind and palate."
"Drinkability & Notes: Very lambic like, perhaps the oddest beer I have ever tasted. Not sure if I should drink it or to clean my hard wood floors with it. Obviously you have to have an acquired taste to like it ... that is something I don't have for this beer. Worth a try if you are a hardcore Lambic drinker."
"Like Walleye in the review before me, this was purchased at Merchant's Fine Wines in Dearborn, Mi. This was one of the worst tasting beverages I have ever drank. It poured out to a brownish, amber in the glass with a decent head. The aroma was that of sourdough bread, but with a ""off"" characteristic. The taste was wretched. Sour beyond belief and totally undrinkable. The experience was so bad, I feel bad giving the appearance a 3.5, when the beer itself was disgusting enough to be rated 1's throughout. This must've been an off batch for whatever reason. Terrible. One of the few complete, drain pours I have had in a long time."
"bought at merchants in dearborn, was told by the person working the beer section that the beer was going to be sent back not a good batch stupid me I bought a bottle anyway. poured copper with a white head that didnt last long. aroma like the pickled turnips you get at a mid-eastern restaurant had a hard time getting past that, as the nose was pulled away got a hint of sweetness. flavor, not as bad as the aroma, vinegar, sourness, let this sit and warm up to see if flavor would change it didnt"
"The Lammin Sahti is a brilliant example of the style that's a must-try (you might not like it, but you should try it). You should also note that because sahti is microbiologically alive and will not keep long once it reaches its top condition (in less than two weeks), it should be bought cold, kept cold, and consumed shortly thereafter.As they say in Finland, ""Kippis!"""
"I'm glad I bought two bottles. This confused the living hell out of me. Interesting, ponderous stuff."
"I can only guess how thrilling this would be with thin slices of moist, vollkorn rye bread, fermented seafood and beets."
