"O: Some interesting flavours but it could be described as tasting like a cheap version of a JW Lees barley wine, and if it were to be judged as barley wine it would fare very badly. Not bad but not something I'd have again. Especially for 8 stinking Euros."
"O-Really unique beer, the juniper is very subtle, it tastes really fruity and the banana flavor is really at the fore-front. Could use more juniper for balance."
"Overall: Really surprised how sweet this was, I didnâ€™t expect Sahti to be sweet. Quite liked it, nice to try finally a Sahti."
"O: Very interesting; complex but still stale. This is probably a style that you love or hate. If you have the opportunity to sample a Sahti - this one would be a nice choice."
"O/D - Tough call for sure. I like this beer a bit but it would have to grow on me. Very different, interesting and complex but hard to finish. Aromatic as hell, and something like I've never had before, but that doesn't make it good."
