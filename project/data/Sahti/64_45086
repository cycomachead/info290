Too sweet and heavy to be sessionable (not to mention the 9% abv), more of a dessert beer.  HIGHLY recommended.","Das_Reh","Feb 15, 2015"

The taste was really nice in my opinion. Starts of mild and herby and seems to grow till there is a bite of mint at the end which made for a much more refreshing beer than I had anticipated.

It's clearly a well-brewed beer and I appreciate every element they've incorporated. I'd like to access the sahti backbone a bit more-- the combination of resiny juniper and intrinsically-strong sweet spices overwhelms the subtlety and renders the beer too complexly sweet, to put it simply. I do stand impressed by the well-cloaked nature of the high ABV, and if you're looking for a sweet alcoholic carbonated iced chai, look not a drop further than here.","kliner88","Jul 08, 2014"

4.32,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 3/11/2013. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep gold color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big juniper, black tea, cinnamon, cardamom, clove, ginger, black pepper, herbal, grass, light banana, light caramel, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big juniper, black tea, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, clove, herbal, light banana, black pepper, grass, light caramel, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of juniper, black tea, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, clove, light banana, herbal, grass, light caramel, bread, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and bready malt sweetnesss; with an awesome malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Sahti style. All around awesome complexity and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and bready malt sweetness; and extremely smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 28, 2014"

I get pumpkin from this too, yet this still comes off as a farmhouse type of effort. It just works. Medicinal, Necco-waferish.

3.91,0.5,4.75,3,4.25,4,4,"Taste follows suit for the most part, but citrus is more the main player with the tea bringing up the rear, as well as some banana . Some black pepper and clove spiciness too, and a touch of honey. Not much of the rye to be found. Feel is light, tart, and refreshing. Not sticky, and not boozy. Very good beer if your are looking for something different. Gives you a bunch of great flavors, but it's balanced an d delightful making this just yet another great brew from DFH.","Samuel906","Sep 26, 2013"

3.16,-18.8,3.25,3.5,3,3.25,3,"In general, I wonder if other positive reviewers have been seduced by what the brewers indicate they did to create this beer instead of focusing on what has actually been created. There are other things it could and should be, based upon the general description of recipe. But there is little opportunity for juniper and other Scandinavian herbs to contribute as they might, perhaps due to the choice of malts and high dose of alcohol. As a result, even time and warmth don't make it stylistically on target, even if it's curiously drinkable.","1sophrosyne1","Jul 28, 2013"

4.25,9.3,4.25,4.75,4,4,4.25,"The beer pours a hazy yellow gold, almost muddy water brown, with a lovely little fourth of a finger’s width head of tight small eggshell-white bubbles. The beer’s body is very hazy and opaque with some chunks floating in it, though the carbonation bubbles can clearly be seen racing to the surface. The lacing on the beer is spotty and thin, leaving haphazard patches across the glass. The smell is tremendous on this beer. It starts with a huge banana bread bouquet, clearly showing the beer’s weizen yeast, but then the smell spices up with peppery notes and a lovely milky herbal-spice from the chai. This beer smells big and complex, there are even hints of souring lactic acids, and maybe even a slight tart cherry fruit leather note. On the tongue, this beer tastes soft, sweet, and spicy. The beer begins with big banana flavors of a weizen beer and, strange enough, the lactic cherry sour flavors of a Flanders Red before it opens into spicy notes, and then hits the palate with light cinnamon, ginger and cloves. The finish is stronger with the chai and herbal notes, while green pepper flavors hint at the tongue. The aftertaste returns to a sweet banana linger alongside the lactic tart cherry while all other flavors fade off the tongue. This beer is dangerously drinkable for its nine percent rating, but you definitely feel it in the face after a glass. On the mouth, the beer feels medium and fluffy in body, with a nice jelling as it washes over the tongue, and a slight cloying nature from the sweetness of the drink. The mouth is left dry on the tongue, but wet on the sides, leaving the mouth confused, but asking for more. Overall, this is a hugely complex beer. I’m actually curious if I got an infected batch or if the beer is supposed to have an almost Flanders Red style taste in its opening and in its smell. The beer is hugely tasty for its high alcohol percentage, and quite complex. A winner for sure!","Maxwell","Jan 12, 2013"

3.97,2.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O – I’m not really sure what a sahti is supposed to be like, but I think this may come close. As a matter of fact, all the stuff that’s listed on the bottle would have brought it farther away from the mark if I could taste or smell them (by that I mean the cinnamon, ginger, and rye). That’s the gripe that I seem to have with most Dogfish Head beers – they list a ton of ingredients and I can only appreciate a few of them. Nevertheless, this was definitely a drinkable beer as the 9% ABV was nowhere to be found. This is an interesting introduction to sahtis, a style that I think I’d like to explore more.","BlackBelt5112203","Dec 26, 2012"

Starts with a sort of tart orange juice type flavor. Then the alcohol flavor makes itself known finishing with spicy pepper notes. Not really sweet but not bitter at all. No hops flavors, have read that sahti is not traditianally hopped at all. Very smooth and fairly refreshing. Dry finish. Light to medium carbonation. I don't really pick up the juniper which is too bad. I think juniper would be delicious in some beers but I haven't been able to taste it in the beers that advertise it.

Doesn't impact the mouthfeel which is still quality - a pop of bitter on the front, sweet throughout most of the body to the end and a good amount of carbonation to boot.

The nose brings a lot of juniper berries, honey, and even tea. The taste feeds off the aroma, which again is led by juniper berries, tingles of orange, tea, and there's even a slight tartness to the beer. The alcohol is hidden well to this low carbonated, medium bodied beer. A surprise for me, as this sahti is relatively easy to approach.","DoubleJ","Nov 12, 2012"

4.04,3.9,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"all in all, Sah'tea comes across as a decent Tripel with some gin-like overtones - wouldn't be mistaken for a traditional sahti - perhaps by mellowing the fermentation, taming the alcohol and lowering its octane a couple notches, better balance would be achieved - i'd like to think I've had an example of this from them where all the elements where in more ideal accordance - nice to try at least once, and best on draft","Bouleboubier","Aug 21, 2012"

The smell is very inviting of chai and black tea with some malt coming through. The taste is a blast of chai right up front and the juniper flavor come on the back of the tongue. Very well balanced in flavor. Nice mouth feel and overall a really interesting good beer. couldn't drink it all the time but i'm glad i tryed this one.","chefhatt","Aug 06, 2012"

Spicy sweet malt aroma with pine and Belgian spice elements. A clove spice flavor reminiscent of Belgian ales with a light, sweet malt body. Medium malts and spices. Slight hop and spicy finish with a hint of the tea. Interesting and satisfying. Worth a revisit.","LiquidAmber","Aug 02, 2012"

4.24,9,4,5,4,4,4,"Well, this is one of those beers to which I really have no comparison to base it on, style-wise. It pours a light gold color, and clear. Like a crystal-weiss, almost. I get juniper and some menthol notes—which does but shouldn’t remind me of menthol cigarettes, since the aroma is nothing like that. More… herbal? Piney? Eucalyptus? More like the smell of evergreens after a spring rainfall. A complex finish that lingers and takes some getting used to. An interesting beer from an interesting brewery. I’ll have to try more sahti and see how this compares.","WoodBrew","Jul 31, 2012"

Not sure of the vintage (have had this awhile down in the cellar) but it still had good carbonation. Aromas of sweet malt is all I picked up on the nose. Taste was quite pleasant: rather sweet malt, definitely chai tea, and a bit of tartness/sourness--from the juniper berries I presume. Glad I had the opportunity to try this. DFH is very much a hit and miss for me a lot of times; this is definitely a hit and I'll seek this out again.","Schmittymack","Jan 15, 2012"

In the nose is large banana, a little hard alcohol (very little) and a sharp, tangy floral aroma. Taste is a sweet, thin malt backbone followed by some syrupy, earthy pine sap that I associate with juniper branches and goldings hops (or something similar) and a light honey toastiness. Not too bright in the mouth, but sits with a pleasant weight. Tastes good, but is this really Sahti? It tastes just like a Belgian Strong to me, but my experience with traditional sahtis is limited, so... This one gets better with every 4 degrees F that it warms up to so let it sit, if you ask me.","tapman","Dec 19, 2011"

4.15,6.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Well, this is one of those beers to which I really have no comparison to base it on, style-wise. It pours a light gold color, and clear. Like a crystal-weiss, almost. I get juniper and some menthol notes—which does but shouldn’t remind me of menthol cigarettes, since the aroma is nothing like that. More… herbal? Piney? Eucalyptus? More like the smell of evergreens after a spring rainfall. A complex finish that lingers and takes some getting used to. An interesting beer from an interesting brewery. I’ll have to try more sahti and see how this compares.","elNopalero","Sep 29, 2011"

Very floral and herbal nose, with a gin-like characteristic. Smells a little like potpourri. The taste is actually more reminiscent of peppermint tea, with some darkly sweet fruit overtones. The aftertaste is rich, with a light sweetness and heavy coriander and nutmeg spicing. The finish is slick, and slightly creamy. Very tasty and aromatic brew.

4.22,8.5,4,4.5,4,5,4,"My initial pour (there would be at least a couple from the massive bottle) resulted in two dense fingers of French Vanilla-colored head with excellent retention. The beer was a cloudy deep golden-amber with floaties noticeable in the glass. I suppose that if you going for authenticity, filtration and clarity are not priorities. That said, I do not mind unfiltered beer as filtering tends to strip flavors away. The nose smelled like potpourri, woody with herbs, especially a black pepper scent underlain by banana. Wow! Mouthfeel was much creamier than I remember it being on-tap and the initial taste was very much tea, followed by a rye bite. The fin(n)ish (ha ha) brought forth an intense banana flavor that reminded me of a hefeweizen. I consider myself to be adventurous when it comes to beer, but it seems like a little of this is going to go a long way. Frankly, it is the banana flavor that does me in. Otherwise, it is a pleasant, mellow beer, but one best shared with others.","woodychandler","Jul 26, 2011"

It really leaves you reaching for all that's inside. There's just so much going on. This is a great beer for the heat, but probably even better in the cooler months. I'm not sure how often I'd go out of my way to come back to this, but it was a fun beer.

The aroma is very sweet, with the chai tea coming through very strongly. There's also a strong juniper aspect, along with some mint, cinnamon, cardamom, cumin, ginger, and a bunch more spices I can't quite put my finger on. A very complex and inviting aroma. The taste really follows the nose, with a sweet melange of spices careening across the tongue. It's very complex, but unfortunately doesn't smell quite as good as it tastes. It's still a tasty brew, but probably just a bit too sweet for my liking. The mouthfeel is fairly full-bodied, with a level of carbonation that's just a bit tingly. The drinkability is alright, I split the bottle over two nights, since it's really a "one and done" sort of thing. Another enjoyable experiment from DFH.","shand","Jul 19, 2011"

The smell is where it hooks you though. Wow, I everything I own to smell like this! It’s quite complex, with faint mint, tea, random herbs, juniper, floral hops, and light citrus all melding together in the best way possible. Taste is also up to par, with a faint yeast sensation, juniper, lemon, cinnamon, straw/hay, and light berries. Reminds me of a fruity, spicy saison (that was in my notes for some reason, so I included it here). Mouthfeel is smooth, invigorating, and refreshing.

Nice tea, spice, and citrus aromas and flavors come out in this beer. Good carbonation with a smooth yet bubbly mouthfeel.

Tasting the beer the chai spice jumps at you with more clove, cinnamon and nutmeg and almost has a creamy taste/feel to it. There is also a touch more pumpkin pie and spicy coconut. Very refreshing with light sweet malts well balanced by the chai spice and acidity. The DFH beers i always think i will like im quickly disappointed and then this beer along with red and white i end up loving - very odd but happy to drink them.

The aroma is big you can smell right out of the bottle, black tea smell with a sweet smell. Bananas and a bubble gum smell which I assume is the juniper berries. The taste of black tea with a bubble gum almost belgian cabdy yeast tatse and the finish is of earthiness. It is not a hop bite but and deep earthy flavor.

Well, Sah'tea is the coolest beer I've ever had. Unlike anything I've ever smelled or tasted before, it is completely unique....well, I take that back a little. It reminds me of a Kolsch with perfume. The smell is all over the place, but interestingly enough the taste is more subdued. Complexity out the wazoo, there are all kinds of flavors. Not sure what juniper berries or twigs are supposed to smell like, but if you don't know, then smell and taste this beer. Can't drink too much of it; one tulip at a sitting is plenty, but sit back and savor it. Each sip brings a different experience to your senses. And at 9%, your senses will be dulled by the end of that first glass. Bottle artwork is top notch. Drink early and often.","Ralphs66","Jun 14, 2011"

It's a perfect "2 o'clock in the afternoon" beer, assuming you have no qualms about drinking early! The juniper berries shine through, along with the various spices, but this beer is not at all overwhelmingly sweet. The brewing processes is rather untraditional, and I think that might contribute to the well balanced nature of this beer. It's warm, light, smooth, and maybe even a bit creamy.

Aroma is exquisite - spices, yeast, malt, fruit, herbs, in an exotic blend that is beguiling. So I drank some. Flavor's not as intriguing as the nose, but still pretty good. Reminds me of a good saison. Maybe just a touch too sweet. Anyway, most of the aroma characteristics but muted. Body is decent, perhaps could use a little more carbonation; however, still good.

I like its ability to provide strength and spice effortlessly so it could be both a summer light beer, but also a sipper. Unfortunately, given all the redeeming qualities of this beer, it was $12 for a 750mL bottle.

Well I guess Pumpkinonia could have used more regulation of its chief export, rubber, but who are you to interfere with the Pumpkinonian's laize faire commercial structure? The seed tarrifs, the middle road tolls, cleaning up constant pumpkin guts from the country side was just far more than you bargained for. Then the sweet juniper potion starts to call your name, you are a flawed ruler, to be sure, but who can fault the Pumpkin King for being a raging alcoholic.

3.82,-1.8,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Sah'tea pours a crystal clear orange, with absolutely no head or lacing to speak of. The nose is very reminiscent of a hefeweizen, big banana notes up front, with a spicy background presence. Unlike a traditional hefe though, that spice isn't straight clove, but a bit more peppery. The flavor is a bit more balanced and complex. Some fruity berry notes join the banana to create a base that supports the spicing. The black pepper definitely comes through clearly, as does a certain herbal quality that I'll attribute to the black tea. The other spices aren't nearly as pronounced, but instead act as a bridge between the tea and pepper. The body is pretty much middle of the road for a beer that's up at about 9%, but the carbonation is just a little bit lacking, a little bit more would make the beer seem a bit more lively. The first of DFH's Ancient Ales line that I tried was Theobroma a while back, and that one kept me from trying another until now, but Sah'tea has made me much more eager to check out the rest.

Very faint juniper and even fainter tea combine for a vaguely spicy, kinda gingery aroma with cardamom, clove, lemon, orange, Belgian yeast, and Bavarian hop notes. There is something sage-like about it as well. The flavor is like a cross between a gin and tonic and Delirium Tremens, spicy, dry, and balanced, and somehow Christmassy and summery at the same time. Tea tannins unfold along with ginny juniper, masala spices, and citric hops for a beer for all seasons.

After sipping it and letting it sit on my tongue for a bit I definitely have a light cinnamon aftertaste. I was thrown off because I was thinking it was made with just "black tea" not "black chai tea" which now makes more sense. Like most beers I've ever had made with juniper, this has no juniper taste at all that I can recognize. It's a lot more smooth than I expected... I was expecting diluted gin of some sort but it's really just a mellow chai-infused beer. I like that better than calling it a Sahti.. although the body certainly lends itself to the flaked oats traiditionally used. Very smooth. At the end of it, though, I'm left reminded of a close to $20 bottle of pumpkin ale without the pumpkin.

Still trying to decide how I feel about the combination of flavors though. I chilled the bottle in a wine cooler to 57 degrees, which brought out alot of the different tastes.

I've been nervous to try this creation because of the heavy chai tea infusion post boil. Pours a pale golden amber honey hue with a bright slightly off white head forming thick with fine lacing. I've only had one Sahti from Tom Baker's heavyweight, never had any of the bottled Finnish versions that make it stateside. Aroma is heavy with fruit and chai tea, really tropical fruit banana and pineapple heavy in the nose with hints of citrus fruits. Flavor, what can I say I had nothing to be scared about the Chai flavor is present but it doesn't overbear the palate it's continuous throughout each sip but not off putting. A caramelized dessert banana with earthy tones juniper/clove/chai tea additions makes for a happy palate. Mouthfeel is heavy with spice finish, carbonation is natural flowing evenly body is medium to full especially with residual spices left behind. Drinkability overall impressively better than I could have imagined go for this beer I guess I'm going for the Nemaste next time I see it, because honestly this is pretty good.","WVbeergeek","Sep 26, 2010"

It smells of spicy, almost minty and has a tea leaf smell to it. I want to say it smells like tannins. The taste is refreshing and crispy, again almost a little minty. The tea flavor does subtly come through. The mouthfeel is perfect. It's sat for almost six months and drinks very smoothly. It is crisp yet doesn't seem overly carbonated.

It had some chunks of whatever in it I guess because I'm pretty sure that its unfiltered. Definitely didn't take away from the beer though just enhanced the taste. No hops to speak of but then again this is one of those ancient brews that Dogfish loves to brew. You can also taste hints of the hot rocks they threw in to boil the wort. Gives it a very smooth smokey like taste which adds to the overall body of the beer. Even though its a weird style I still have to say this is an awesome beer to drink despite its 9 percent alcohol which by the way is very well masked. A great quality to most of the Dogfish Head beers. Thank you Dogfish Head! When this comes around again next year I'll be sure to give it another taste. Biggest downfall is that its hard to find and when you do its in limited quantities. Then again most of their beers go pretty fast in the stores I buy from.","thebrood1987","Sep 17, 2010"

All of these other beers cause Sah'tea to lose some of its unique complexity due to the similar yeast/flavor profiles.

There is a little sweetness in the taste as well, moderately balanced by bitterness. I'm having a hard time detecting other flavors because of the strong chai flavor; not that it's bad, but it does make other subtleties hard to pick out.

This guy pours a clear copper-orange with almost a finger of white bubbly foam on top. This is not as soupy as the other sahti I've had, but I think it's a bit of a step-up. The nose is loaded with different elements: cracked pepper, cardamom, coriander, tea leaves (I can't tell different teas apart by their leaves' odors, so don't ask me to try here...though the bottle indicates a black chai tea), spruce, some smoke, and a seemingly random melange of miscellaneous spices and whatnot. Damn, such complexity! The same mixture shows up again in the taste, though the tiny bit of smoke is now compeltely absent, the spruce is lighter, and a note of oak comes through. Clearly the addition of the tea mixture upgraded a (probably) more average flavor profile. The body is medium-level with a lightly moderate carbonation.

The spices are more subtle than the aroma. The chai and pepper are there, the allspice seems to fade. Towards the end you can pick up some of the juniper berry. The feel is a bit thick in a syrupy sort of way. There is some tingly carbonation; finishes spicy, sweet, and sticky. I feel that this beer is trying to find its identity.

This is one that I'll have no problem to finishing and would gladly drink again. It'll just be a while. One bottle goes a long way I'm thinking.

The smell is complex and aggressive with a strong Chai tea, cinnamon, nutmeg and earthy banana aroma that's quite nice. Full flavored, sweet and spicy, the taste matches the nose pretty well, but instead of banana it tastes more like a meaty pumpkin pie. In that regard, it reminds me somewhat of ST Pumking (this one has more pronounced spice to it). The mouth feel isn't dominated by carbonation. In fact, while on the lighter side of a medium body, it has a creamy smooth texture. The lingering after flavor compliments the feel nicely. This one is a riot to consider and I could easily finish the bottle, but not tonight. The 9% ABV presents a modest warmth on the way down...the affect is a notch or two below distracting. Another successful deviation by Dogfish Head if you ask me.","jjayjaye","Oct 17, 2009"

It's not sour enough, and not woody enough, and it's too full bodied and sweet - and to be honest, it tastes more like Chai tea than anything else, but OK, that said, I don't care about any of those references, and I only look at it as-it-is, which is extremely nice. It's a little sticky (not backed by much bitterness), but it balances itself out and doesn't cling to the palate. And it's totally unique. I've never had a beer that's anything like this.

The aroma is a super chai tea with some pumkin overtones and juniper berries for a punch of spice. The abv. only heightens these aromas. The taste starts off pumkin ale and strong black tea. The middle brings the chai and juniper berries center stage. The finish warms everything up with a warm fuzzy feeling. Nice syrupy palate with lots of spices and herbs.

Moving along to the taste, it has a light and easy going sweetness to it, somewhat medicinal, in a positive nature that is.

I got some chai tea from the cabinet later on to compare. There are others I just can't place. The taste is similar, if not mostly resembling the nose. The tea flavor rules while the juniper and additional spices in the back. Just a touch of malt with no hop presence. Doesent taste like beer, which is fine by me. The mouth is smooth with great carb from the tap, this one is not dead, the bottles could be a different story though. I remember hating a theobroma bottle, but loving it on tap. A medium feel.

The phenolic is in the taste as well, but subsides a bit as it warms. Taste is a little on the sweet side but I think that plays real well with the spices.

Taht's too bad, because its the juniper that makes a Sahti taste like a Sahti. The nose is dominated by those same notes. That's not to say I don't like this beer for what it is- which is a sweet, creamy, nicely spiced dessert beer. Very smooth, with creamy black tea notes and typical chai spices, esoecially cardomom.

It tasted like chai tea and fresh banana, with orange and peach and honey, and a bit of nutty malt and bready yeast and cloves. It was fairly thick with moderate carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this was a very interesting and delicate beer with complex flavor. It was quite unique and enjoyable, as a change of pace. It had great body and hid the alcohol very well. So it was definitely easy to drink, but quite worth sipping.

Mouthfeel is on the thicker side with medium carbonation - a sugar bomb that, coupled with the ABV, should be available in something smaller than a 750 ml bottle. Quite good overall.

The complex smells of honey, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, pine and a healthy dose of ginger. The spice sensory overload continued in the taste, more clove, some apricot, really floral and perfumey. The competing spices were battling each other, too many. The dryness of it bothered me. Lingering spices on the tongue and coating the mouth. Why release in July?

The boozy aroma is very complex; hints of chai, cinnamon, nutmeg, and honey are front and forward, while black pepper and a quality I can only describe as "tree bark" lurk in the background. Taking a sustained whiff of this liquid gives me the same feeling I had as a child breathing in "laughing gas" through a plastic mask whilst awaiting a dental procedure. The flavor follows the smell, but with a more pronounced sweet character overall. The chai and sweet honey dominate.

Taste follows nose; however a citrus quality comes out - maybe a bit of orange peel at the back (not sure what juniper is supposed to taste like). Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation - lively throughout without any burn. A very interesting beer, but not something I'd drink a lot of - a 12oz. would have been sufficient; however, you have to hand it to DFH for always pushing the boundaries.","Jwale73","Jul 10, 2009"

Like I said I was glad I split this one It would have been way to much to finish the 750 but I enjoyed every drop of my glass.

The taste is similar to the aroma, with chai tea, honey, ginger, bananas, apricot, clove, lemon peel, smoke and ginger all noticable. This brew is full of different flavors. To me it seems like a mix between a Belgian Triple, a Witbier and Chai Tea. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit heavy/rich in the mouth and has good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and quite enjoyable to drink. The 9% ABV isn't noticable at all in the flavor or aroma. Overall I liked this beer a lot.

Glowing golden haze in the glass, more orange bronze in the middle, widely dispersed bubbles appear throughout. Juniper, wood smoke, orange peel, persimmon to peach fruit and clove stick forceful in the nose, whereas the individual scents have considerable intensity, you're more impressed by the collective lift into a wet perfumed cloud. Full-bodied, thick foamy carbonation makes it denser and more block-like. So, while there's air pockets present you get more of a totally full sensation cheek-to-cheek. Lemon, grapefruit citrus like meringue pie, the clove and juniper add muskiness to the floral touches. Persimmon, peach, apricot, pear fruit, close to kiwi or papaya without the juiciness. The light smokiness is sweet throughout, the breadiness like a warm waffle. The sour tea leaf comes through, doesn't add much sweetness in turn. The strength in the flavors ensures an extended finish.","farrago","Jul 05, 2009"

By far one of the most creative, unique (though, of course, something is unique or it isn't, there isn't a gradient of uniqueness), and interesting beers from Dogfish yet.. To the extent that, assuming you've done just a basica level of research into the beer before trying it, the level of anticipation is fairly huge. The pout is a surprisingly vibrant orange with a slight whitish head. Looks sort of like orange soda (moreso than, say, dayquil) with some deeper hues in the center. The aroma is spicy, very complex. The chai has a strong presence. There is a hint of maybe smoke (from the hot rocks?). The flavor is also extremely complex. Strong chai presence (though I don't like chai tea really, and I do like the beer). A bit of fruitiness from the juniper, and a lot of complex spices in it. NOT spice like black pepper in a belgian style, just a strange tea-like spice complexity. Mouth and Drionkability are typical of dogfish ales.. Mouth is on the lighter side of full-bodied and is somewhat reminiscient of a hefeweizen (as is its drinkability). It is very, very easily drinkable. I could see drinking 2 bottles and it hides the abv quite well. All around it isn't mind-blowing but it is very good and extremely interesting.
