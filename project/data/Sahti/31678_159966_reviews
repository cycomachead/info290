"Great label, average beer.  Very drinkable, but unlikely to make it a point to purchase this beer again."

"Taste is a little more on the grainy rye end of the spectrum, with more bubblegum yeast steamrolling in. Not sure where the juniper comes in to be honest, but I trust it's a component in the mix. Medium bodied, lightly sweet at first and finishing dry. Overall worth a try, would have liked more juniper flavor, but a drinkable clean beer nonetheless."

"O.  My first time having a Sahti and I gotta say I like it.  It's a nice change of pace from the IPA's and Stout's that I love so much.  This is a nice chill beer.  I think it would be great with a Ceasar salad or an olive oil based pasta dish.  Speaking of salad would probably make a great vinaigrette.   This is a nice delve into the style and I will look for more."
