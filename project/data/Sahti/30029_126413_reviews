"Overall, it's okayâ€”the sweetness really sticks around when you don't want it to, but there's certainly some interesting stuff going on. At the very least, it's another beer that proves once again (after Divine Manchu last year) that Young Henry's don't do GABS by halves. And that's a great thing."
