"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while if you want something slightly different."
""
"Medium-thick body, Dark, mostly opaque, copper/amber with a lace of off white head. Aroma is of of roasted malt with hints of fruit and toffee . Taste is malt and tart to start fading to a malty coffee like after taste. Very thick with little carbonation it drinks smooth but leaves a thick chewy feel. Taste strengthens greatly as it warms, best at around 60- 65* as it get overwhelming as it continues to warm."
"O- this drinks like a juniper-infused scotch ale, quite interesting"
"Overall:  A very tasty beer.  I really like the flavors of dried stone fruit and molasses and brown sugar-like sweetness.  The herbaceous bitterness as the finish provides a very interesting counterpoint as well."

"Very noticeable hints of juniper. Full body. Medium-dark color. A bit of a boozy after-breath. Delicious beer though. Ive found its best consumed @ > 50 degrees F."

"Sahti is a style I don’t know much about, but if this is a good representation then I may avoid it as I’d much rather be drinking a stout or IPA. The Vikings may have enjoyed it, but with the current craft beer movement I’d rather spend my time on better styles."
""
"Me and my friend were required to brew a Sahti for a home brew competition we were entering, so we saw this on the shelf and decided to give it a try. I must say I was pleasantly surprised as I thought this beer was going to be awful. It pours in a dark gold murky color that is somewhere in between good and ugly. I really did not like the smell it was funky as hell. Medium-low head which is actually too much head for this style which is supposed to be served flat. Taste was of malty juniper with maybe a little spice from some rye grain. It was surprisingly refreshing and left a clean feeling in your mouth. This beer goes down super easy for something with a 7% ABV. There are some subtle hops detected, i think a noble verity, which I enjoyed and obviously increased the shelf life but again traditionally there is supposed to be no hops and the beer drank within a month after it is brewed, but I realize that would be a money losing endeavor for anywhere outside Finland. Also I think the flavor got better as the beer warmed. Give this beer a try it is totally different and pretty good."

"O - Certainly an odd duck of a beer, but I liked it. I'm not sure if I will be buying it again, but I am really glad I tried/reviewed it."

"Overall – This is a tasty mix consisting of a sorta amber ale and oaky gin boozy brew that really warms you even while only at 7 % abv. A very interesting and rather enjoyable brew."
""
""
""
"O - Interesting brew.  Taste is somewhat reminiscent of Utopias.  Wouldn't have this one frequently, but nonetheless would have it again."

"The aroma was mostly sweet malts, with a light spice/pine scent. The taste was nearly identical, but the spiciness seemed a bit more noticeable. The body was nicely full, although a bit sticky. Drinkability was OK, but this would be 1 at a time beer for me, mostly due to the sweetness. Overall, a nice enough example, would probably be a decent introductory brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - It's an okay brew, a bit refreshing on a hot day so glad I chose to enjoy it now. The only other Sahti I've had is DFH's Sah'tea and I definitely liked that one better."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a rather disappointing sampling from Sam Adams. It's the first sahti I've had the opportunity to taste, so I can't completely rate to style, but this seemed to lack the body and the tartness that supposedly comes with this style. Based on my guess at the bottling date, I am over a year late to this beer, so if I found fresh bottle, I might try it fresh to see if it was any better."
""
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice foamy head, and some persistent lacing. Nose is sweet characteristics only with very little malt or grain. Earthy with sweet raisin, bitter licorice and a noteworthy whiskey flavor. Syrupy and thick. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" A bit of woody taste a bit earthy a bit of bite at the end from the citrus and maybe a bit of frozen alcohol since it was frozen. From what I can tell it seems pretty good and I would try it again but maybe next time with one that does not explode in a bath of foam all over the table and computer nearby then I may be able to more faithfully review it...overall glad I bought and tried it and would try again."
""
""
"O: an interesting and solid beer overall. Sahtis are hardly my specialty, so it's difficult to compare it to other examples of the style, but it was an enjoyable beer overall."
""
""
"O - Overall I really enjoyed this beer and will have to include this in the rotation."
""
"The first thing that hits you as you pour it out is the sharp aroma of brandy, strong and sweet with plenty of fruit undertones. Raisins and light breads smells also come through and there is that slight definitive smell of alcohol. It pours out a dark murky brown color and is topped off with a thin head that quickly forms a small ring around the glass. The lacing is thin but very covers every inch of the glass. It taste is rather surprising, it’s light and tart, very refreshing; it bitter around the edges of the mouth and you can pick up some woody flavors, mild berries. This is a very refreshing find and I’ll definitely be buying this one again."

"Bottle opens with a huge crack and bubbles immediately try to escape, luckily my cat like reflexes got the bottle top into the glass before any product was wasted. Deep clear reddish brown with a huge off white head that takes forever to recede. The aroma is spicy, no shit huh? It doesn't strike me as much different from a Belgian strong dark honestly. Dark caramelized and brown sugars with some dark fruit and a virtual spice rack of aromas that range from nutmeg to coriander to mint. Juniper berries perhaps? The flavor is rich and malty with lots of dark sugary flavor. There's an earthy spicy woody component in there that I can only assume comes from juniper somehow. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet light syrups mouthfeel. Not a bad brew, but honestly not my cup of tea."
""
""
""
"This is a rather enjoyable beer and is rather enjoyable in the winter. If you're a dark beer lover or Samuel Adams fan, give this one a shot. You won't be disappointed."

"22oz bottle poured into a 25oz snifter, is light brown and topped with a pillowy, ivory head that holds good retention. Aromas are better than expected, woodsy, earthy, herby, raisin, spice, and what I assume juniper. Tastes are complex and earthy, with peat, juniper, woodsy, bready, caramel, raisin, sour spice, rye, dry white wine, faintly medicinal - all flavors meld better once it warms. Creamy medium body, nice carbonation. Overall it's different, but better than expected. I've only had 1 other Sahti to compare this to, so it's a tough style for comparison purposes. As a beer, it's weird but not too bad at all. I've got friends in Finland, so I was very interested in trying this one. I get what they were going for here, but it definitely isn't authentic as far as ingredients go, but I can look past that."

"O-DFH's was better. Balance needs to be improved but still then nothing in this beer sticks out."
""

"Taste is like a sour version of an Irish red ale, actually very off putting! I was expecting something more Gin-like . This tastes like it WAS dredged up from a thousand year old Viking ship! Caveat to the reader, I never drank a Sahti before so I may not be the best guide to this brew! (But this brew makes me sure not to drink one again!)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: I'm not sure where the Sahti character was, since no juniper was really noticeable. The scent and taste were like a red ale or Oktoberfest. Not unpleasant at all, but way off for the style (and therefore disappointing). Did I just sit on this too long, and all the uniqueness already faded?"
""
""
"It’s an easy drinker with a unique flavor."
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; Batch 1, bottled in Spring 2012. Moderately fast gusher upon opening. Pours lightly hazy red copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, juniper, raisin, wood, floral, earth, and herbal. Damn nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of malt and juniper notes. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, juniper, wood, raisin, floral, earth, grass, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, floral, earth, raisin, wood, juniper, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of malty flavors with the juniper notes; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium full bodied; with a very creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice take on the Sahti style! Great malt complexity and balance of juniper flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on. I really enjoyed this one."

"This beer definitely gets better as it warms. I'm not sure how authentic a sahti it is though. There was zero sediment in my bottle."
""
""
""
"I haven't had a Sahti before that I can remember so I wasn't sure what to expect from the style. I was expecting something more rustic, cloudy and more complex. I'm glad I tried it but I don't really need to have this again."

"Pours a two-fingered white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Medium carbonation and medium body. Crystal clear copper/amber color. Nose is light malt and bready, flavor is malty with a light juniper bite. 22oz bottle $6 Market Basket Concord, NH."
"O - I wasn't quite sure what to expect of my first Sahti, but I think I like it. Would drink again."
""
""
""
"Had some at my parents for the holidays. The drink had a dark brown-amber appearance with a decent head that became thin lacing eventually. Aromas had a solid malt flavor with some vanilla and bread hints. The drink was tasty with a strong butter flavor and a slight cherry aftertaste. Medium body and decently creamy. Overall, pretty good for the holidays."
""
"Well this is a conundrum beer for me...do I rate this as for what the brewer intended or do I rate it as to whether I like the beer. In respect for this website I will rate as brewer intended...but I am not a fan of Sahti style beers. The beer poured clear amber with a thin white head that is lacing nicely. The scent is a very I nice breeze of berries. The Taste is very fruity...perhaps the reason the Vikings averted scurvy??? There is a nice malt base that balances the fruitiness. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall the beer is decent...a little to fruity for me....but solid offering by Sammy A!!!"
""
"A nice start to my 3 day weekend!"
""
""
"O=Nothing special here...reminded me of a reddish amber with a hint of berries in the background. Will only buy again if on sale and then only for aging."
""
""
""
"O - This is certainly not one of the better of the small batch series produced by Boston Beer Company. The absence of other spice components make this fairly basic and 'one-dimensional'. The yeast used here isn't very interesting as well - not enough funkiness."
""
"I don't know. I was expecting more of a juniper and pine character where all I got was a strong malt sweetness overall. Certainly not a bad beer, but something I would look at as more of a Scottish ale or even a wee heavy. Would I drink it again? Sure, it's tasty. Would I consider this a fine example of the sahti style? No, at least based on the style description on BA. I find very little in this beer that fits that profile. Maybe Norse Legend Sahti doesn't meet my expectations of what the beer should be, it's still a nice beverage to kick back with..."
""
"Overall: this is a good beer, although I think I like it more for its novelty than as something I'd want regularly. The juniper creates a good bitterness, but the overall woodiness is a bit much for any kind of session drinking."
"Overall / Drinkability: I've never had a Sahti before so it's hard to rate this one on style. If I read the Beer Advocate description is has some features of the beer (mouthfeel, juniper) but not others (turbidity in appearance). So let me instead state what I think of this as a beer. The Juniper works well as a hop substitute, although there are times where I think I'm drinking a beer spiked with Gin. Could be I'm not a big fan of Juniper. Nice looking beer, feels good going down....not really great in taste and smell. Interesting yes. A great beer? No. Drinkability - I could not finish off the bomber myself even over 2 hours (corked the bottle and kept it in the fridge while I finished the first glass) and so one big glass is more than enough. I think I would give the style a try again, but with food, and not this particular beer again. A good beer to try, but not good for a repeat."
""
""
"Strong ale with juniper, that is all we have here ... no rawness or tart character. Refined and too sweet. I want to cook with this beer a hell of a lot more than I want to drink it."
""
""
""
"It's an interesting beer. I only have one other example of the style to compare to, so it's hard to say whether this is a great sahti or not. However, it's certainly tasty in my glass."
"My first new rating for a Sam Adams in a long time. Big fan of the company and the presentation of the Small Batch Collection pack. Not a bad beer overall, I may have homered it a little bit."
"Beer is medium bodied, with medium-intensity carbonation that results in a slightly prickly at first, but quickly foamy and smooth afterwards. Closes semi-dryly."
"O- I'm glad I was introduced to this style of beer. After doing my research, I learned that Sam Adams did a few things differently in the brewing process than people who have made more traditional Sahti: using juniper berries instead of branches, and hopping the beer. I'm not saying this is a bad method, because I'm sure it is much more conventional for mass production, but I look forward to trying a more traditional Sahti, someday. I like Norse Legend. It is nothing spectacular, but it is a fine tasting beer. It has also reminded me that there is so much out there that I don't even know, and that my beer tasting journey has barely begun."
""
""
""
"O- Overall, not bad but this beer was lacking a little for me."
""
""
"You can't fault the way Boston makes all the elements work, and packages this with nice foam and beery substance. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Liticker's in San Diego."
"Update: Opened a bottle that was six months old from purchase date. This has mellowed quite a bit and the gin-like component is pretty subdued. Still present, but more an afterthought than it was. Sweet and malty flavors, caramel/toffee more forward. Sweet but not sticky-sweet. Still a decent beer to drink in my opinion, but I'd rather have it fresh with the juniper more prominent. More brown in color versus original notes."
"D- Not as awful as it could have been, not as great as it could have been either. I would have liked more juniper and less metallic taste. A bit on the boozy sweet side, so not exactly sessionable."
""
"Overall, not mind blowing, but certainly not terrible. An interesting style and worth a repeat sampling."
""
""

"O - The malt and the juniper remind me of a Christmas beer."
""
""
"O: As above I expected this to be much more in your face, smacked with a tree type of thing. I’m glad it was not. My first sip impression was “not so bad” witch for something off the beaten trail can be an ok impression. (I wish my attempted at a gruit had rated that high) I find this an enjoyable beer. I would not have more than one in a night and I may never grab this again, but I am glad to have tried it and would recommend it to my friends. I would say treat it like a barley wine. A sipper around the fire, split with a friend, cold winter night kind of thing."
""
""
""
"Intensely sugary sweet molasses, brown sugar, figs, ginger and only a modicum of juniper aroma with a nuance of buttermilk and leafy hop aroma on the side. Hmm, I was expecting a lot more juniper wood in the nose than this. The flavor, however, has some of that woody splintery bite that I have come to expect from Sahtis. Unfortunately, it's just too pastry-dough-sweet overall for the herbal and leafy hopping to match for my personal tastes."
""
"And to reiterate: not to style, but a nice stab at making it perhaps more approachable to a less exploratory populace?"

""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into small snifter. Off-white head atop an amber body. Clear lacing, sticky. Aroma includes sweet caramel and brown sugar. Taste is malty sweet and caramel with maybe some toffee. No bitterness to speak of but none expected considering the style. Very easy to drink, no alcohol taste anywhere of note. Very tasty brew, interesting and tasty."
""
"A gose, a gingerbread stout, a sahti...dammit, Sam Adams needs to brew us up a kvass soon... Anyway, this ""sahti"" (quotation marks explained below) pours a clear amber-copper topped by a finger of light khaki foam. The nose comprises a spruce-tip sandwich, all white bread, with only a leaf or two of lettuce separating the other ingredients. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the spruce is in resin form as well, the bread is slightly drier, the lettuce is straight iceberg, and what seems like a bunch of juniper berries finds its way in there for good (?) measure. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly syrupy feel. Overall, this doesn't come off so much as a sahti to me, rather a spruce-flavored amber ale or something. Either way, it ain't that great..."
""
""
""
"Overall an interesting malty beer."
"Honestly, I can’t imagine any reputable Norseman characterizing this beer as ‘legendary.’ It’s just okay in about every respect. Frankly, the flavor needs something to liven it up a bit. If you’re looking to simply try a Sahti, it’s worth grabbing a bottle. There are far better representations of the style though."
""
""
""
"Overall: This brew - my first of this style - is rather peculiar. The taste is almost off-putting at first but as it warms up and I get ""used to"" it, it becomes rather enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is good fare, and a nice addition to the Sam Adams Limited Release series. I did wish for a bit more body and potency in the beer, the 7% ABV and the concomitant lower sugar levels making for less strength and more wateriness than I would have preferred. Still, the flavors here are unique and nicely developed, offering excellent interplay and nuance. Worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I think this beer is one of Sam Adams better beers because it is interesting and I enjoy drinking beers that aren't really ""traditional beers"" in the German sense of the word and it was great to finally get to try it on draft. I remember about five years ago they had it on rotation but I was never able to try it. There are so many other beers out there that I have to try and my regular drinking beers (IPAs mostly) so I'm not sure I'll be drinking it again, but maybe if it goes away I'll miss it and want to try it again next time around."
"O: My first Sahti, and i feel that this may not have done an adequate job of defining the style. It seems a lot more like a belgian double, or a quad, than anything else. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Overall- I am totally unimpressed with this one. The only thing this beer has going for it is the mouthfeel. This is the first beer from Samuel Adams that I wish I wouldn't have bought."
""
""
""
"Overall: Decent brew, glad I tried it, probably will not have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"I tend to think of Sam Adams' beers are generally overrated, but I really enjoyed this one. The beer has something, I'll just call it a 'pleasantness' to it. It's easy to drink and has moderate alcohol. A very good beer."
""
""
""
"Good effort, but the flavors just don't work personally. Glad i got to try it though."
""
""
""
"O- It was a solid beer. Not something I buy over and over, but not a bad beer. It was a good beer for a lazy Sunday afternoon at the house."
""
"I'm not sure what I was expecting going into this beer, but I'm not disappointed. It's very malty and a bit earthy. The berries are there and play nice with the malt bill. I would definitely recommend this. I'll probably buy another bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a chestnut colored brew...slight head. Wood, malt and citrus are present in the aroma. I'm not sure that I discerned juniper, but it does have a resin character. The taste has some toasted malt character and a solid bitterness. Wood and resin in the finish. Not overly hoppy. Full mouthfeel and lingering aftertaste. Nice."
""
"22 ounce bottle, Batch #1. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear reddish/amber color with about an inch off-white head. The head stays around a while, and there's a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, it smells like berries, caramel, bready malt, sweet spices, and some tea and herbs. It tastes like caramel and bready malt, slightly bitter herbs, toffee, berries, and a bit of apple. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit thick and chewy and has moderate carbonation. I liked this brew, it's worth a try."
"But not is all lost- the Boston Beer Company is only inspired by sahti and isn't making an attempt at replicating authentic versions. But the only resemblance to me is a barely noticable juniper character."
""
""
""
"O: ok, so I like this beer (good appearance, good smells, decent taste and a pretty good mouthfeel) but I have nothing to judge it on. I'm pretty sure I'd have it again, but probably next time I'd buy two of them just so I can age one and taste one fairly immediately. In the meantime, I'm most likely going to seek out some other Sahtis just to compare."
""
""
""
"Overall this is an interesting beer in a style unusual to the day. BBC does a respectable job here."
""
""
"Overall: Not too familiar with the sahti style, but this one is alright in my books. It could seem to me a little cleaner and maltier. Still a good brew though."
""
""
""
"Dark amber in color with an off-white head. The nose is herbal with lots of spruce, a touch of juniper, and maybe some pine. A nice fruitiness of apples and berries, but there is a definite rubber and metal aroma that is off-putting. Light notes of smoke on the palate with the same herbal character. Light malt sweetness, hints of fruit, and only a minimal juniper flavor. The metal and rubber is also pronounced, which is what really ruins the beer."
""
""
"O: Overall, an enjoyable beer for sure. The juniper clearly add some interesting and enjoyable features to the beer."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is relatively easy to drink for the style but seems like the taste could use a bit more flavors of juniper berries."
"O: Pretty easy to drink for the style (which is not filled with easy drinking beers) but not the best example. I like the combination of the spice/herbal notes but I likely would not get this one again."
"Pours a beautiful light brown caramel color with a tinge of foam that evaporates very quickly. Aroma is of sweet and sugary grains and hops. Tastes sweet, but not overdone, leaves a nice zip on the tongue as it goes down. A beautifully decorated bottle as well."
""
""
""
"O: It's not a stunning beer, but I'd buy a bomber again for ~$6.50 and would recommend it to friends. You can really feel its potential; perhaps the bottle just needs to be aged a little longer or would be better on draft. At the very least, I think this would be a tremendous baseline for homebrewers who are considering their own sahti, simply because the appearance and mouthfeel are just right on target while there's room for improvement in terms of taste (sweeter and spicier please!)."
"O: I'm actually pretty impressed. I'm a sucker for peppery beers and this one is funky, but it's rubbing my the right way. I'd drink this again, but I'm not going to buying a ton of it at my local bottle shop."
"Drinkability- pretty good, I would probably drink it again."
"Full bodied and lightly carbonated, it leaves a pretty heavy coating on the tongue and palate. I can't say if this is good, bad or just utterly normal for the style."
""
"The beer was a handsome auburn color with a generous white that showed a decent level of retention. The aroma was a pleasant lemony tea scent with a spicy aspect to it. In the initial taste, one picks up the pepper which is followed by a strong sensation of black jelly beans. There is a certain degree of Earthiness to the taste. The peppery sensation lingers in the aftertaste, as does the tartness. The beer is smooth and goes down easy. With a better taste, this could be an easy drinker. I have a had several sahtis which I have greatly enjoyed. I feel such a strong level of dislike for this one because it lacks the expected sweetness. There is not much of a tea flavor, but there is big black jelly bean flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a hazy red-amber color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of toffee and caramel as well as a good dose of juniper. The flavor is similar. I get a good amount of juniper and some the toffee and bread notes. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A pretty good beer, although not as heavy on the juniper and gin-like notes as some other sahtis I have tried."
""
"3.48/5.00"
"Served on tap. Appears deep amber / brown with decent clarity. Nose has an array of spices, primarily cardomom and coriander, relatively mute on the aroma. Taste has some sweet honey component paired with tea leaves and caramel. Mouthfeel is ligh and moderately carbonated. Overall, this has nice balance but is lacking in terms of the style."
"Pours a clear dark coppery brown, almost mahogany, with a thick, fluffy, buff head that sticks around and leaves some generous lacing. Malty aroma has a strong juniper overtone, almost like a menthol cough drop. Don’t get me wrong - I like the smell of menthol cough drops! Malty flavor has a strong juniper note and hints of apple and wood. Firm-bodied texture is smooth, fizz leaves a little to be desired. Overall, though, a distinctive and worthwhile beer."
"Norse Legend has a medium body and medium carbonation. The finish is somewhat dry and a tad bitter. A nice beer for moderate consumption. It's not a sipper, but you want to enjoy it."
"Pours darker reddish amber with some residual foam. Malty smell, plus fruity hints - the juniper I suppose. Taste is an intense fruit. Full rich flavor, like fruit juice trapped inside a beer. Tasty blend of fruit, citrus, malt, and a mild hop close. Good beer."
""
"O: my first santi, I think. Worked well with a steak sandwich."
"Overall and interesting style and I'm glad I tried this one."
""
"O: Oveall a decent level of complexity, flavor is decent, and blends gently together. starchy dry belgium yeastiness."
"22 oz bottle. Pours dark red with a long lasting, off-white head. Aroma is of bready, caramel malt, juniper and hints of grassy hops and dark fruit. Body is full, smooth and creamy. Taste is juniper, dark fruit, bready and caramel malt, spicy, grassy hops. Finish is long and spicy. Interesting, unusual brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On taste, it's not so interesting. Very malty, but there's very little spruce/juniper flavor, not on an Anchor OSA scale, certainly. The yeast character is more in line with a standard ale, slightly fruity but generally pretty clean. What we have is a strong malty beer. If I didn't know it was supposed to be a Finnish sahti, I'd have guessed it as a Scottish Wee Heavy. Actually, judged as a Wee Heavy, I'd probably give it a higher rating."
"An average, if somewhat unusual beer. Worth checking out as long as you don't expect it to knock your socks off."
"O: This is a tasty beer although not as much of the herbs and juniper and twigs and stuff that I think of when I think of a sahti"
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of juniper, slight roasted malt, slight sweet malt,, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Sahti. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of juniper, sweet malt, slight dry hop, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, the juniper was weaker than expected, but still a good beer. Mouth feel and aroma were the strongest aspects of this brew."
"O: To be fair, the sahti style is not the easiest to get right. However, this beer is just too thin to enjoy."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Easily drinkable, but a tad watery. Not bad at all. An enjoyable summer brew that has a lighter taste than its color lets on. Well balanced malt and no sign of bitterness. A bit hard to tell if this a beer or not."
"O: This beer goes down easily enough, but isn't particularly memorable for me. I'll remember it as being mostly sweet with an indiscriminate bitterness on the finish. Nonetheless, it was nice to be able to try this semi-obscure, ancient style. I wrote this review with a C-average in mind, so my final score indicates that this beer is just beneath average– in my mind, not as bad as it may look when compared to its other scores. If this is around in the future, I'll certainly revisit it once I have greater sahti experience to make a better attempt at reviewing to style."
"Poured a half inch opaque Naples yellow/beige head with a relatively short life. The body is a lovely clear amber both in masstone and held to the light. It smells like rich and malty is to come. Taste isn't quite as bold as the smell hints but yes it's still rich, there's still malt, and a fairly long finish. I'd call this similar to a Scotch ale but richer. Nice product."
"O/D-Pretty cool. Sam Aams usually falls short with their more unique and ambitious brews. This one was actually pretty legit. Very unique. Gotta respect taking a shot at this style of beer."
"Overall: Pretty good beer, you will see a few better sahtis out there but this especially for the money is just right, Salud!"
"Overall, an interesting beer, but I anticipated more complexity."
""
"O: im very impressed by this sahti, perhaps it is the fact that it is a more commercial version of the style and thus isnt as aggressive on the juniper which my palate tends to not agree with, quite happy"
"Overall not bad, decent juniper, decent malts, not too bitter and not overpowering with juniper flavor, not not a whole lot going on."
""
"A flavorful sahti. A little too big, too sweet. Nice name for a beer. 3.5"
"Overall, for the 3 of the style I've had, this is not bad. Not quite what it could have been, but not a disappointment either. Worth a try and a decent attempt at the style."
"Overall: a very interesting brew with a lot going on here. I am bad at breaking down this genre which typically is complex as this beer is."
""

""
"Overall: A pretty good brew. The spices and wood are a nice balance to the sweet malts. Nice to see a old style kept alive."
"D - Very drinkable. A pretty good example of the style. Balance is pretty nice. Would have liked a bit more juniper flavor."
"This beer pours out a nice red color with plenty of bubbles and a small head. The aroma is interesting. This one uses the Sam Adams house yeast note found in many of their beers right away, but is boosted up right away by a HUGE hit of juniper and rye. The taste is really quite similar to the nose, with the malt and yeast base tasting rather similar to a sweeter Boston Lager, but with a lot of juniper and rye coming in and bashing around the tongue. The finish is a bit rough. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is about average. It's another interesting entry in the Sam Adams small batch series. I probably wouldn't buy it again, but I don't regret giving it a try."
"Of the few Sahtis I've had, I haven't had any that have really impressed me. This seems like an OK version of the style but is oddly diacetly and astringent."
"O: I really like what the rye does with the juniper in this beer. The berry flavors, although mostly juniper, provide enough sweetness to go great with the spiciness of the malt. Not sure how some reviewers are calling this weak in the smell and taste, it's pretty damned aromatic and flavorful. Solid job by SA on this one"
"O: Really surprised by this one. Definitely the best SA beer I've had. Very nice impulse buy."
""
""
"It is drinkable, and enjoyable, but nothing I'd race back for. The biggest highly for me was probably the aura of the brew being a throwback. I really connect to those ideas and value attempts to honor these more classic styles of various historical cultures, but while this may have been dead on balls accurate, Sam Adams other attempts at this, like Dark Depths, are just more bold and satisfying."
""
"Overall: As others have pointed out, this doesn't much taste like the other Sahtis I have had (though admittedly, the sample size could be counted on one hand); not a bad beer, but a bit too sweet for my palate"
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a lighter wood, spice and a citrus note. In the taste, woody, dry citrus and a mellow spice. A spice like bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry citrus and licorice in the aftertaste. Lots of flavor and quite enjoyable."
""
"O: look, I've only tried 2 sahtis - this one and Dogfish Head's, and both admittedly took some liberties with the traditional formulation - I really liked the bright, light craft of the DFH Sah'tea, and was ready for this to fall short, but it doesn't - it's clearly just a darker take on the same idea, and not-for-nothing, I think this may be more representative of a traditional sahti. I would definitely buy this again, and would love to do a side-by-side."
"Overall: so intriguing... Nothing to compare to. This feels and tastes like something other than beer [although it looks like beer]. My first of this style... Definitely worth a try, I love it for its unusualness and earthy/outdoors taste and feel."
""
""
""
""
"D - not bad, but really lacking in the classic sahti flavors."
""
"First stab at this style and yes I had avoided DFH's. Had this at Peles in Jax, FL on draft. Poured nice and dark with fliffy head. seems of bitter berries and wood dominate. It also has that elderberry type of flavors. Hop profile is low which is great so you can taste the earth and berry flavors. nice job SA for introducing me to this style."
""
""
"Overall: I admit I have not had a lot of shati's to compare this with, but it is damn tasty. Very interesting and complex. One of the better small batch brews Sam Adams has come out with. I wish the bitterness was left off the end, but I would grab this again."
"O: There really isn't much to this ale. Compared to traditional Finnish sahtis, it is lacking in flavor and complexity. Not a great effort."
""
""
"O: Tastes like a Mead and a Scottish Wee Heavy had a baby. Honey sweet and caramel rich with earthy characteristics. The juniper berry flavors aren't quite there but it's interesting none-the-less."
"O: A refreshing and unique taste. This was my first in the style and I'd like to try more."
"M&D - thick and viscous, this flavors of this beer remains on your lips after a sip and you get another burst of flavor when you lick your lips. the viscosity lends a smoothness that makes the unique flavors of this brew easy to drink. One of the better of this unnamed Sam Adams' series."

"O- I enjoyed this beer, I dont feel like there is a whole lot that you can do with this style but I feel like Sam Adams did it well. If anything, this is worth trying just to try out a Sahti."
"It's summer and this thing is making me think it's Christmas. Is this Christmas? Who cares? God Jul! Skol!"
"Overall: This is just odd. I like the taste, but the aroma is a little out of whack. Also, while I have never had a truly traditional Sahti, I am sure this is not it. Shouldn't a Sahti be turgid with some wild yeast characteristics? This just seems like a stronger Amber Ale with some juniper and rye."
""
"Overall: I like it alot, It is the best Sahti I have tasted however I am not sure about how authentic they did it. I Know they did not strain hrough juniper and I have not read anything about usinghot rocks.? Otherwise great beer"
"Norse Legend hits upon the requirements from the style but doesn't venture very far from that. Norse Legend is more Soilwork than Kalmah if you know what I mean."

"Pours a slightly hazy reddish copper color with white edging. There is a slight amount of lace left on the glass. The aroma starts out with a floral hop aroma. As the beer warms the juniper aroma comes out along with a hint of tea at the end of the aroma. The taste follows suit closely. Before the beer warms there is a floral hop taste up front. As the beer warms the floral hop taste gives way to a nice juniper flavor. At the back end there is a black tea taste. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is a solid beer, the beer gets much better as it warms. The flavors come out much more with the warming."
"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours dark amber wtih an eggshell colored head. Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom and the side of the glass. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass during consumption. There are aromas of dark roasted malts, alcohol, juniper, and citrus. There is a solid malty backbone with juniper and hops coming through in the flavor. It's mildly sweet, but also pretty well balanced with citrus, hop bitterness, and the juniper flavor adds nicely to this beer. I can also taste some of the alcohol in this one. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer. It is certainly a quality beer from the Boston Beer Company."
""
"I've had real Sahti before, and this is nothing like it, but it's still a really good, exceptionally well balanced and easy to drink beer. I would definitely buy this on a regular basis if it came in 6 packs. The subtle juniper in the finish makes you come back for more, always wanting more juniper that is, unfortunately, not there."
"Pours a dark brown color, fine clarity, off white pillow fluff head and good lacing. Aroma of sweet malts, pine, juniper and citrus. In the flavor, rich and malty with caramel, toffee and even cocoa notes upfront. There is a nice pine and citrus profile from the use of juniper and possibly a good dose of hops. The level of bitterness was light to moderate. Small alcohol presence and overall this brew was very tasty. Stood up pretty well to a brick oven pizza."
"Overall I am quite pleased. I don't really have anything else to compare it too but the flavors work quite well and add a nice complexity. Something I would definitely have again."
""
"A medium-bodied beer, it lacks many of the characteristics that are common in Finnish sahtis: the hazy orange or deep yellow color, a slight sour note, a more detectable rye spiciness in the grain bill, and a stronger juniper aroma and flavor. Again, malt sweetness dominates, with a whisper of juniper in the finish, especially as the glass warms. Hallertau Mittelfrueh hops offer a welcome, if atypical orange rind quality to the taste. Well made for sure, but slightly disappointing for lovers of sahti."

"I am really liking the Sam Adams Small batches! This one is great and it is great to find new styles of beer. For the amount of alcohol in it.... it is pretty light and fruity.. . it packs a punch."
"Essentially Norse Legend drinks like a really well-made red ale with some herbal, primarily juniper, elements added it. For those of you in the Boston area, there are some overlapping features with the on-tap-in-Boston-only Boston Brick Red, also from the Boston Beer Company. Norse Legend is a very well-balanced beer that has taken a rarity in the beer world and made it into an immensely drinkable treat. It’s quite enjoyable and would be appreciated by a variety of beer drinkers. This is a beer worth your time."
""
"O: Not completely tradtional, especially with what I've had from Finland, but I did quite enjoy it."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, ruby-brown coloring with a frothy, light, low profile, off-white head that slowly settles into a filmy coating. Aromas of roasted caramel and maple sweetness, with some citrus and fruity highlights and a woody, earthy tone throughout. Flavors are rich and malty, with a caramel and chocolatey backbone giving rise to some roasted and earthy characteristics, as well as a bittersweet fruit highlight. Solid, smooth bodied with a roasty and sweet fruit aftertaste. The finish is light, but solid, with some green and earthy character giving a linger on the tastebuds. Interesting brew."
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Pretty light bodied and smooth, but a bit light on carbonation and not too lively. Overall, very interesting but not a favorite. Worth trying though."
""
""
"Drinkability is real nice on this beer. A very nice balance of malt and fruit. The juniper berries have a nice undertone and don't overpower like some fruit beers. The undertones make this beer very refreshing. This would be a great beer in spring or summer and I would definitely go out of your way to try this beer. Like nothing I have ever tried before, Sam Adams never disappoints, well done!"
""
"O- No bad or off putting flavors, but nothing really jumps out at me. I like the fact the Sam Adams is trying different styles and they should keep trying new things with the single batch series. I could see myself buying this again."
"This beer is certainly different and it is also reasonably tasty. But it perhaps isn't a great Sahti. Instead of tasting like a juniper-preserved rustic ale, it tastes sorta like a top-notch Amber Ale with significant botanical adjuncts."
""
"overall, quite a nice beer, though a bit different for my taste. solid beer and worth trying."
"It's a drinkable beer, but nothing too exciting to get worked up about unfortunately."
""
"Overall, this is pretty unique. Worth a shot for sure."
"Once again, great to see BBC experimenting and diving into the weird styles."
"After tasting Dogfish head's Sahti, Norse legend just seems like an attempt at creating another style to flood the market place with. Flavors aren't there and neither is the merit. At it's best it's drinkable with some flavor for 7% ABV"
"Paired with some norwegian goat cheese- excellent."
"On tap. Pours a medium brown color with a half inch of head. Zero lacing. Aromas of berries, tea and cola. Smells somewhat like a fruity tea. Tastes like tea but not as fruity as the aroma but more of an earthy tea flavor. A bit floral. Peppery. Light mouthfeel. I know its not a high ABV but this doesnt really taste all that boozey. Almost tastes like drinking peppery Iced Tea. I like tea so this one is ok by me but it might not be for everyone. Overall, I would drink it every so often but I wouldn't go out of my way to have it."
"4/3/3.5/3.5/3.5"
""
"This poured out as a deep amber color with a cream colored head on top. The smell was a little bit on the floral side with some herbs in the mix. The taste of the beer is good but really becomes interesting in the finish with the herbal notes really come out. The mouthfeel was smooth with a soft carbonation to it. Overall this beer was rather impressive. This is something I'd like to see Sam Adams do more with."
"Beer had slight ring of a head and an amber body. Minty smell not strong resin. Taste was very sweet. slight mouthwash flavor. But the sweetness really pervades this beer. Little carbonation. I can't say I am a real big fan of this beer. I have not had very many authentic examples of this style but it really doesn't taste anything like I think it would. Not very piney at all."
