"Good color and classic smell."
""
""
""
"A lovely straw yellow hue, with a crazy thick head that sticks around for an extended period of time. Lots of little bubbles rising throughout. Smells yeasty and of biscuit. Tastes refreshing, with tons of banana and biscuity flavor, little notes of spice as well. A tremendous, refreshing hefe; one of the pillars of the style, clearly."
""
""
"Wow wow wow it's just right.. Let's compare it to a woman... She goes down smooth and she's the perfect mix of a few of your favorites... Love it!"
""
"Simply the best Hefe I've ever had. The standard by which all others are judged. Enjoyed many times over the years in various glasses. Always a pleasant pour with a frothy head. Rich mouth feel with medium to light carbonation. Notes of banana and spice."
"Bottle of weihenstephaner Hefe weizen drank"
""
""
"It's a great beer. It poured beautifully, had notes of ripen bananas and fruity esters. Very easy to drink and light-bodied. It seems to be missing that subtle peppery bite that I look for in a hefeweizen. It doesn't compare to New Glarus Dancing Man - which has set the bar really high. It might be that this beer is not fresh. Could not find the bottle date and bought this off a shelf at room temp. I have no doubt that drinking this straight from the source or from a fresh bottle would leave this beer tasting much better than now. I will take the next opportunity to try this beer again when I find it refrigerated."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure I understand the fascination with this beer. I'm not a hop snob and appreciate Czech and German pilsners and lagers and enjoy Hefe Weisbiers as well. Who knows ? Maybe the main streamers who put a lemon wedge in this stuff are right. Think it would help."
""
""
""
""
"I can't deny how good this is. They hit it right. Perfect amount of carbonation and perfect amount of banana flavors. The only thing I can say is that the smell gets a 4 but who cares about that. Everything else is a 5. I still enjoy many other hefeweizens but this one truly is that extra bit better than all the others I have had. Fantastic beer."

"Great beer! I'd drink this any day."
""
""
"love wheat beer. This is a great one"
"Rich and spicy clove notes blend with pleasantly balanced fruity esters. Perfect body. Incredibly drinkable and refreshing. Simply the definition of the style."

"Purchased 500 ml bottle from the health food store for about $3 and poured into a tall beer glass.  A very hazy rich golden-yellow color with a fluffy pure white head that slowly fades leaving slight lacing.  Aroma is of bread, yeast and slight citrus.  Taste is really nice with some citrus and bread followed by a muted cinnamon/nutmeg-like spiciness that really makes the beer.  Towards the bottom of the pint, the beer started to have a slight metallic after-taste, maybe due to the trip across the Atlantic.  Goes down really easy, but is not super thin - enough body to keep you from pounding it, but enough carbonation to keep it refreshing.  Overall, a fantastic wheat beer and a great deal for the price."
""
"I love hefeweizens, but I'm not sure I understand the super high rating on this one. I can't really tell this difference between Weihenstephaner, Hacker-Pschorr, Paulaner, or Tucher. They all seem equally delicious. While I love the style, this particular brew does not stand out from the crowd."
"  Overall, a 4.75 for Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier - Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan. Not quite perfect for a 5, but this is up there fellow BA's and also those new to this who'd like something lighter on the palate yet still bursting with great flavor."
"While I am not a fan of wheat beer to begin with, I must say that I had better of this style. Still, drinkable and refreshing."
""
""
""
"Its a different hefeweissen beer"
"Very bready.  Good head.  Fantastic flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I can see why this brewery has been around for so long. All the components of this beer are bold, but well blended. I usually get bored of Hefe’s before finishing 12 onces; this one left me wanting another 16."
""
"about perfect for the style."
""
""
""
"Lots of earthy hay on the nose, grainy malt flavor that is light and crisp.  A standard of thr style."
""
"A solid German Hefeweizen great for a hot summer day. Has to be one of the better beers I have tasted."
"This beer is the standard for Hefe Weissbiers and is world class.  The flavor profile is intense, complex and well balanced.  It begins with a mild tartness that separates into lemon and banana.   As these fade in the middle, clove comes forward over a biscuit background with a hint of spice and dryness.  The finish is crisp, with a mild biscuit fading and leaving clove."

"Very good hefe , I really enjoyed, lots of bananas, IMO I actually prefer the paulaner hefe over this one at the moment but it is very good."
"Tried this on tap! Was VERY good and actually very cheap. I had forgotten my growler or this would have been the beer I bought!!!!!!"
""
""
"- beer lived up to its name for me great summer beer, and german beer example"
""
""
"a great day bier from the original bier maker"

"Simply the best in class."

"I may not be rating this as high as most people on here, but that definitely does not mean I dislike this. Good beer all around."
""
""
""
""

"Pours hazy, light colour with a large white head.  Spicy banana smell.  Mildly sweet spicy taste with mild carbonation. Definite repeat."
""
"Half liter bottle poured into weiss glass. Appearance is cloudy orange, with a towering three finger head that has some stickiness. Aroma is textbook, banana and clove spiciness plus wheat and malted sweetness. Flavor is malty and yeasty with sweetness and spice. Lemon, banana bread, clove, alcohol, and just a fuzz of hop bitterness. Medium bodied, creamy texture, soft but abundant carbonation, drying finish. Perfect for the style and excellent overall."
"O: outstanding;"
""
""
"Cloudy pale golden color with a big white head. Smooth, malty, banana flavored beer. Aromas of must, funk, yeast. Light bodied, refreshing flavors. Mainly fruit with some bitter hoppiness towards the end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely could tell it was an ancient recipe. I loved the look of it - had a nice dark to light gradient, and feel was solid - nice medium body, but the taste and smell was not pleasing to me. Had a weird barley, bacterial taste."

"Exactly what I expect in a German style Hefeweizen."
""
""
"Just a normal hefeweizen beer, I really don't get why people love it."
"This is one of the best Hefe-Weiss beers I've had. High quality and smooth drinking with the absolute perfect balance of spice and malt. This beer would be outstanding had it been a little cooler."
""
""
"Smooth with a nice fruity finish. I would def buy again. Top notch."
""
"Wow. All the garbage that's labeled Hefeweizen in the US does not even come close. Will definitely seek this out again!"
""
"Pours a cloudy orange. Bubbly awesome head. Smells malty and sweet. Maybe banana? Just enough sweet and spice. Beautifully balanced beer. Never had such a pleasant experience with a Hefeweizen."
""
""
""
""
""
"What can I say that isn't already known about this beer. This is the ultimate form (thanks Plato) of the Hefeweissbier. World class for sure."
""
""
""
"Absolute quintessential heffeweisebeer; the creme de la creme of beers.  Flavor, look, body, nose and finish are world class. You simply cannot deny the excellence within the bottle, try as you may."
""
"Perfection in a beer. Recommend"
"A delight to find iin Nigeria.  500ml bottle poured into tulip glass;  a nice 3-finger fluffy white head, very persistent, leaving lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass;  cloudy ambercolor; Big aroma of wheat, cloves, malt, some light citrus and hint of banana; nice sweet malty taste with a little citrus bite; creamy smooth feel on the tongue makes me want another."
""
""
"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier -----4/5."
"I am new to this but wonder if I just got a bad one.  Loved the kristallweiss that I had a couple of days ago but was not as impressed by this one.  Will have to try it again.  Wish I could find some sort of date on the bottle."
""
"Smell and taste of lager flavours, bready wheat, slight citrus/berry with a tinge of earthiness. Smooth, creamy, yeasty, and crisp. This has it all."
""
"My absolute favourite Hefe-Weiss Bier! (Along with their dunkel!)"
"Pretty good beer to tacos"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Will buy again soon, very soon"
""
""
"Deliciously made and well crafted beer with a subtle hint of banana flavor."
"This is the first German beer I have tried and is by far my favorite beer, now I  underatand why they say Germany makes the best beer. I recently turned 21 and started trying different types of beer to find what I like, and well this is a winner."
"Poured cloudy with a orange hue.  Low head and retention...probably not a well-cleaned glass.  I get some of the banana esters I was expecting, but not too much.  Closest smell I can think of is canned corn.  Taste is where this brew moves up a notch.  Full-flavored hefe with better mouthfeel than most.  Nice finish as well.  Pretty much a go-to hefe, and the decision is even easier considering how reasonably priced this usually is."
"This is flat out one of my favorite beers.  I am a huge fan of the style, so I am a little biased.  When it comes to Hefeweizen I feel this is one that others should be compared to.  Great body, aroma, and flavor.  Top of the class!"
""
""
""
""
""
"This tastes like a German Biergraden.  It's top notch and arguably the best of its style.  Plus, relatively easy to find at my local specialty grocer."
""
""
"Overall : One of my top 5 beers now. Seriously amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice hazy appearance.  Not sure how to describe the smell on this one.  Predominant banana flavor.  Nice light body.  Best hef in recent memory.  I will definitely be revisiting this one on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best beer in the world. If I could only drink one brand the rest of my life, this is it."
""
""
""
""
"best weiss beer ever... glad my girl liked it too"
""
""
"Pours beautifully. Murky orange hue with a thick head.  Smells perfectly.  Banana, malt, clove.  Taste...perfect.  Mouthfeel...same.  Enough said?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A quality hefe lacks a bit of the yeast flavor.  The banana comes through.  I would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Absolutely amazing Hefeweiss. Beautiful hazy shade of straw with hints of orange in a classic Weihenstephaner pint glass with a nice layer of creamy head on top. Taste is as good as it gets in my opinion. Creamy, sweet, but not too much, fortunately, and overall just amazing. Drank a few at Prater biergarten while on my trip to Berlin and just the great memories of Weihenstephaner together with some nice Bratwurst make me want to go back."
"Very good beer my favorite by far at the moment"
""
""
"Perfect Weissbeer, couldn't been better"
""
"Nice clove flavor, not over the top. Excellent texture. Light citrus for a refreshing brew."
"The origin of beer!!! Still going strong. One of the best beers I ve had."
""
""
""
""
"This is so drinkable, I feel I could have like three of these in a row! Crisp and refreshing! Will have again and again and again!"
""
""
"My example of the perfect beer! An exceptional balance of Bavarian Hefe flavors and smoothness. This is where the bar is set for Bavarian-style Hefeweizen."
""
"Overall: This is a very good Hefeweizen, not quite as good as a Franziskaner, in my opinion, but definitely up there."
""
"Amazing wheat beer! Probably the best wheat beer I have ever tried"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The gold standard for Hefes....tough to beat this on a hot summer day."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the most balanced and rich hefeweizen. Must try."
""
""
"Possibly my favorite beer. It goes down so easy. Love in a glass."
"Very good beer. Flavourful, not too heavy, good mouthfeel. Overall excellent weissbier"
""
"There's a reason this is the highest rated Hefeweizen. It's amazingly balanced. This is my go to beer, especially in the summer."

"Poured into a half-liter weissbier glass. Produced a nice 3-finger fluffy white head, very persistent, the head lasted a good five minutes and left some very nice lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass.  The beer is a golden yellow color, thick and hazy, just as a good hefeweizen should look. The aroma of this beer is huge, with wheat, cloves, malt, some light citrus and just a hint of banana. The clove flavors really shine in the taste, along with some nice citrusy notes and banana, with a very nice sweet malty backbone.  The mouthfeel is very nice, medium bodied, creamy smooth on the front of the tongue, with the high carbonation adding just  the perfect finish on the back of the palate. This hefe is the standard against which all other hefe's should be measured. A world-class beer at such an outstanding price - I paid about a dollar each - outstanding beer at a super-low price- sign me up!"
""
""
"I honestly can't believe I passed this beer over based on price point for several years (4$ a pint bottle in Washington State). Glorious head that shadows a variable fruit flavored offering. I got green apple, green banana, pink grapefruit/lemon. Champagne bubbly finish. Must try."

"O - I really like the malty finish.  Like most wheats, taste seems slightly on the light side for me, but it still a very pleasant taste."
""
""
""
"O: IMO, the best damn Hefeweizen I EVER had! This stuff is true magic and a great credit to the ""worlds oldest brewing company."" I guess after nearly a thousand years though, it should be expected."
""
""
""
"Traditional and a must for beer fans"
""
""
""
""
"O – Obviously one of the gold standards of the weissbier style, and I would love to drink a lot of this on a warm, sunny spring or summer day.  An easy go-to beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: one of the better wheat beers I have had to date. A good mixture of flavours from the hefe spectrum. A well-rounded beer, and decent for an equivalent of AU$65 for a case of 24 x 330mL. What can I say - the Germans do it best."
"By far my favorite beer."
""
""
"I've ignored the fact that my local chain grocer offers this for years. Now that I've tried it I can't imagine why I put it off for so long. An excellent hefeweizen at an excellent price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden pour with slight haze. Touch of orange in the aroma. Light hops with a creamy orange finish."

"First beer on the native soil of Germany was this delicious delight.  Perfect blends and crisp taste."
""
""
"Overall, this is more than just a standard for a hefeweizen. In my opinion, this is the end all and be all of hefeweizens."
"Overall: After being disappointed by Kellerweiss, I was willing to give Hefeweizens one more shot with what is arguably the benchmark of the style, but sadly ended up getting disappointed once more. I understand that it is intended for the yeasts to give off a flavor similar to this, and that many other people enjoy it, but it is just not for me, and I think it's only fair for my score to reflect my own experience with the beer. I guess I'm one of those people who are too sensitive to the yeasts/phenols for this kind of beer to be enjoyable. For now I will give up on this style, or maybe try a kristalweizen next."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"By far the best beer I've ever had.  The head is thick and lasts for several minutes.  Although it is rather expensive, $17 for a pint on tap or around $13 for a 6-pack, it is well worth the price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drunk loads and loads of these from the barrel, absolutely my favorite all time beer. Never bores, fresh banana like taste. Solid head, just perfect."

"I'm new to beer reviewing, so beer with me, lol. A: Golden Yellow slightly cloudy, with a big white creamy head that offers nice lacing while drinking. N: The aroma is an excellent balance of hops and fruit that leaves your mouth asking for more. T: Wheat malts, tropic fruits, light spices, quite dry and hoppy. P: Doesn't leave much behind on the palate but is nicely carbonated. O: I enjoyed this beer very much. It was refreshing and has become one of my favorite Hefeweizen. It is a very good after dinner beer, due to not being filling or heavy. A must have if you enjoy wheat beers."

"Overall - an outstanding beer that delivers on all fronts and does not disappoint. Easy drinking, complex enough to warrant attention but not so complex as to be confusing.  Except for the banana coming to the front once in a while, I didn't think any flavor was particularly dominant. All of the flavors were balanced and smooth, contributing to the overall flavor without being ""over the top"". Great brew!"

"O - Very refreshing beer.  Reflects the style very nicely.  Would gladly order this beer again, although I think I will try ordering a bottle next time in order to have a better head on the beer.  4/5"

"The only thing you need to know about Weihenstephaner is that it's the most important beer on this planet. This is what all wheat beers will inspire to be until the end of time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Surprisingly complex for a German wheat—others I've had tend to rely more on sweetness and smoothness, while this one punctuates the flavor with peppery and bitter qualities that give it a more mature character. I appreciate that the balance is towards the spicy qualities with fruity sweetness in support, and that the otherwise sour yeastiness is effectively masked."

"Poured from pint bottle into pint glass, pours a dark yellow color with a 3 finger foam head of an off white color, ok lacing. Smells of wheat, clove, and bananas, with hints of lemon and vanilla. Tastes a lot like banana with a slightly vanillaish after taste. Mouth feel is light to medium bodied, with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall it is an excellent beer and one of my favorites that I've had to date!"

"Huge great banana and clove flavor in this one. A little more subdued on the clove than other hefeweizens I've had, but it is still there. Overall the best hefe I've had so far."

"This beer is just so smooth, tasty and drinkable that I found myself polishing it off in no time. I kept sniffing at it and holding it up to the light in between sips and then lingering over the sips, so as to prolong the enjoyment of the sip. I could sit and drink 10 of these and probably still want more. For a hot summer's day, you'll find it difficult to find a better beer (alternating in rounds between this and the Rothaus Pils would probably be close to nirvana)!"
"Actually, I can see a Vitus looking longingly out of the fridge ..."
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O- Good stuff and I haven't revisited this one in years but I also had the Vitus recently and I prefer that Inez's intensity of flavor."

"Would absolutely seek out and purchase again."

"Pours a slightly hazy medium amber with thick head and moderate lacing; smell is of umami, bananas, cloves, fruity pebbles; taste is alternatively umami, like soy sauce and fruity, with bananas and cloves coming through. There is a bready, wheaty backbone that ties the flavors together. Very smooth and low in bitterness, this beer is definitely on the sweet side. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Overall, the archetypal hefeweizen; this is the standard all other wheat beers are to be judged by."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a clearly well crafted and delicious hefeweizen!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: boy is it good ... loads and loads of wheat sweetness with just enough of a tart note to keep it from becoming too sweet; a brew I will revisit over and over and a definite standard I will use to measure other hefeweizens"

"Gold, clear yellow, white long lasting head, thick and tasty. Smells like rum from barrels, vanilla at first and wheat and fruits later. Lots of hops, cigars and tobacco. Sweetness of grains, bitterness of yeast. Cinnamon, barley, avocado, all in finish. Gold medal, and probably best wheat beer in the world."
""
""
""
""
""
"The quintessential German hef. Strong head on the pour due to the intense carbonation; the head levels off nicely after about 5 min. Clear, golden straw color. Intense banana / clove smell that carries over perfectly to the taste. Clean, crisp with a slightly sweet finish. Refreshing. The perfect beer when you are hangin' on the porch on a lazy 85 degree summer afternoon. Truly outstanding."

"One of the great Weissbiers of the world. The import is filtered more than what you would drink in Freising, Germany but it is very smooth and very pleasing. It has more body than Spaten and is more wheaty than Rhineland lagers. This is the beer of Bavaria."

"I'm a little spoiled, since I live in Austin, and we can get Live Oak Hefeweizen on tap in a lot of places here. So, I was a little hesitant to buy this one, but I wanted a hefe, and the guy at Specs said this is the best they have. I still like Live Oak better, but just by a hair. I have seen a number of reviews that rated this beer down a bit, and I would say that something you might do is let it warm up a bit. I started this one at fridge temp, and wasn't really that impressed at first. However, I was called away for a bit, and when I came back the beer had warmed up to probably upper forties, or even higher in temp, and it was AMAZING. It really opened up and a lot of flavor came out."

"I see how this is the standard for a Hefe. Pours pale orange, with moderate head and quickly receding lace patterns. Aroma is truly outstanding! Orange, banana, and great wheat aromas, very well balanced. Taste follows with cloves, grass and slightly sour yeast flavors. Very smooth finish and great after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer poured a hazy straw yellow with a significant fluffy white head that just kept going and going which hinted at bottle conditioning. The aroma was classic hefe with the clove spice and banana yeast. The taste followed with the full bodied banana yeast and spices floating on top of a grainy wheat base. There was practically no perceptible bitterness to be found just Hefe heaven. The mouthfeel had a perfect amount of body and thickness to be a substantial and satisfying drink. Despite the fullness I found the beer to be refreshing while not sacrificing the full flavor of the hefeweizen. The Weihenstephaner really nails the style. A perfect Hefe."
""
""
""
""
""

"refreshing, with flavors that complement any well-seasoned foods. probably the first choice if you are eating thai or indian cuisine. they have succeeded in drawing the most from the wheat base, and flavoring cautiously. tops any U.S. craft wheat beer I have tasted."

""

""

"Pours a nice yellow/orange beer. Has a nice foamy head. Almost no smell, except for yeast and maybe a bit of sweetness. Taste is straightforward, classic, very well executed. It does not need to do anything crazy, it is very well balanced. A classic hefeweizen."
""

"Nice, cloudy and light color, with a wheat aroma and characteristic banana-sweet background. The taste was great, clearly a wheat beer with earthy tones (like cloves), but a prominent banana flavor throughout creating a sense of creaminess and faux full body despite being light and quite drinkable. I enjoy heavier, full beers so the feel was a bit too light and watery to me. Overall, excellent hefeweizen, not too much banana, but a light wheat beer with the enjoyable banana-earthiness from the unique yeast."
""
""
""
""
"o: a classic beer, and rightfully so. loaded with flavour yet very drinkable. i used to not think too much of hefeweizens, but every time i have this one, i love the style more and more. try this if you haven't already"

"Flavor – Banana, right up front, then more banana. Wheat, of course. Very drinkable."

"Unbelievable, amazingly good. The pour is a cloudy yellow with a thick fizzy head that trails the head. The smell is heavy with wheat that brings to mind bananas and really fresh bread. The taste was exceptional, with sweetness in the beginning that turns to the almost minty spice of the wheat. The feel was amazingly refreshing for being thick and just full of flavor. Probably my favorite import and can not recommend it highly enough."

""
""

"The look of this beer is phenomenal. I recommend pouring slowly 2/3's or more of the bottle and then spin the rest of the liquid in the bottle before pouring in the remainder. This will complete the look and taste by adding what some refer to as the crud."

"Overall: When reviewing wheat beers, many of us on here (including myself) mention that it's not our style, but this is one of my very few exceptions. Truly an amazing hefe and you don't even have to seek it out. Therefore, this is the only hefe worth buying in my opinion. Beats others in the style, Bavarian or not, at a competitive price point. This is one of those beers that make you look forward to summer. The ratings say it all. Cheers!"

"O-The best Hefeweizen. A beer in which I can think of no area to improve in. In fact, stop reading as I'll stop reviewing and lets drink us some Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier."
""
""
"Overall, buy it or try it. You will love it. Best Hefe to date. I have had this brew many times and will buy it till I cant buy it no more. The more you try the hefe style it will grow on you. I did not like it at first. But it has a way of calling your name."
"Overall - Not my style, but this drinks nicely. A great go-to beer that can be found everywhere."

"What a wonderful hefeweissen! Lovely, soft citrus aromas. Pours a warm golden with a pillowy head. Tastes like fruit, and bread, and sunshine. I didn't discern any dryness or hoppiness, but the beer tastes very smooth, well-balanced, drinkable and flavorfull. Unlike some other hefeweissens, I wasn't put off by any excessive sweetness or carbonation. All-around great beer."

"We sampled the brewery's Hefe Weissbier (""HW"") in a 500 ml bottle purchased from the LCBO, with a best before date of September 9, 2012. HW was 5.4% alcohol by volume. It poured a naturally cloudy, light orange colour with about 2"" of fluffy, white, long lasting head that left plenty of lacing and spotting down the glass. The aroma was fabulous...bananas, cloves and yeast...and remember that this is a beer that complies with the Bavarian purity law and therefore contains no bananas or cloves. Darn clever, the things those Germans can do with the right strain of yeast! The taste very much followed the aroma, with bananas, cloves, wheat and yeast evident. The amount of carbonation was just right with lots of small bubbles on the tongue, and the mouthfeel was creamy. HW also had the clean finish I look for in my favourite beers. Ladies and gentlemen, if this isn't the epitome of the brewer's art, it has to be close! At $3.05 per 500 ml bottle this beer is a decent value for money as well, and HW now joins my short list of regular purchases."

""

"50cl bottle into a weizen glass. Cloudy pale gold appearance with a thick three finger white head. Sweet banana aroma with yeast. Creamy mouthfeel with a sweet taste of banana and bubblegum. Dry bready aftertaste. Medium body and carbonation. A very good hefeweizen. Would be perfect with bratwurst on a hot summer afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wonderful beer that is my go to wherever I can find it. If you're in Buffalo the Blue Monk on Elmwood actually has a keg for this specifically every night. I didn't know about all the hype before I tasted it, but I think that makes my review more honest. It really is that good."
""
""
"Overall: I've heard nothing but great things about this beer and finally gave it a try. This is truly a perfect beer. Definitely a benchmark for it's style and pretty accessible. A must try."

" Opinion: I feel kind of let down with this. I'd think for the worlds oldest brewery that the recipe would be extraordinary, but this was middle of the road for a hefe. Not a bad beer but I prefer Ayinger to this."
""
""
"No beer is perfect, otherwise every other company would just copy their recipe. This has to be the closest thing to perfect! If you want a nice Bavarian German beer, Weihenstephaner is the way to go! Their Hefeweissbier is incredible, I have definitely not tasted anything close to the quality of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I've not had many European hefeweizens but this one is easily the best so far. Very well balanced and one of the easiest drinking beers I've ever had. I can't believe how many times I looked at this on the shelf before finally trying it. I have a whole new appreciation for the style and this will be a regular in my fridge."
""
""
"Pours a hazy yellow/gold in color with a good 3-finger white head that does settle down to about 1/2 a finger. Lots of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is sweet right up front with wheat and cloves. The taste is real close to that with the slight tangy clove finish. Clean and crisp and goes down very easy. No bitter or harsh after taste at all. Very slightly dry at the end. Overall, really a great brew!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I have always been a fan of wheat type beers, my first experience with Weihenstephaner had me instantly hooked. One sip and I knew ""this is is!"" Bottom line: If you like wheat beer this should be your next purchase, you can't go wrong."

"Pours a hazy yellow/gold color with a large, frothy, pure white head fueled by a continuous stream of bubbles from the base of the glass. Wet patches of bubbles cling to the walls of the tulip. The aroma is of strong clove, banana, wheat, straw, freshly cut grass, and hay. Very floral and refreshing. The taste follow suits, with a strong clove and banana presence amongst a wheat and hay background. Some faint lemon citrus, white pepper, and crisp grape juice sensation round it out. Mouthfeel is delectable; light, crisp, and lively with an effervescent and dry finish. Overall, this is a phenomenal hefeweissbier that I’m always happy to have. The clove in this is very predominant, but masterfully integrated such that it doesn’t seem overpowering."

"Translucent but not transparent this ""hefe weissbier"" or yeast wheat beer pours yellow, yes yellow in color. Unfiltered bursting with carbonation leaving rings on the glass as you drink it is one of the best wheats ever made. Not only is it the best but it 'a the first claiming that it was first brewed in 1040 AD. Fragrant citrus bouquet. Carbonated not bitter citrusy wheat taste on the palate that lingers as a slightly sweet beer. Possibly floral at the finish. The best lingering flavor for a wheat I've ever tasted. True Bavarian (Munich region) beer. Not hard to find but don't underestimate it's greatness."
"O - 4.5 - It's a great beer. World class for sure. This is the best wheat beer I've had, usually they have some off flavors, but this one was so clean and awesome."

"Arguably the best hefeweizen in the world, this beer is readily available and affordable where I live. I would not worry too much about the freshness factor, as this beer ages remarkably well for the style. I have had it on tap both in Germany and the U.S. and have had many bottles in the U.S. Never a let down. The darker and stronger versions are also great, as are the lagers from this masterful brewery."

It's a stark difference from the last hefe I had, which I think was a Widmer almost a year ago - it's just no comparison, they are two totally different beasts. The Weihenstephaner was a flavor bomb and now I wish I had another to drink!"

"Pours a cloudy lemon and straw color with two fingers of off-white head that quickly disappears. There's also a steady stream of carbonation around the edge of the glass. Banana, clove, and peppercorn are most prominent on the nose, and after that, lemon and bready yeast. In the mouth, coriander and other spices come out, along with a big Belgian yeast characteristic, banana flavor, and bubblegum. The body is light with a sweet finish."

"Great wheat beer that goes great with any grilled food, I just wish it was more thick. Also for a top quality import beer the price is not that bad as compareded to how pricey Belgian ales can get. The bottle says keep it around chilled to about 46-52 degrees fahrenheit, but if you have it a few degrees warmer than 52 degrees you can really takes the wheat."

"The Gold standard of a true Hefe-Weiss Bier ! Same score for the other versions as well (Krystal - filtered) and The Dunkel Weiss. Wonderful massive heads, pour slowly! Wonderful classic fragrance, the real deal ... The Bar is high on this why go under ?"

"Overall: A more balanced, malt-forward Hefeweizen which creates, for me, somehow both a rounder and more complex flavor profile. An enjoyable example of a traditional German wheat beer that encompasses both creativity and tradition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hefeweissbier pours a golden color, with a large frothy massive lacing head. The aroma has a lot of cloves and banana notes, a little ester. The taste has a great creamy crisp wheat backbone, with cloves and banana notes, with a nice mellow ester flavor. Very drinkable, very full flavor, perfect carbonation. Overall, WOW."

"Overall: A disappointment. A very pretty beer. Smells great. Feels great. Tastes good, but less than I expected. Still, if I wanted good hefeweizen, I'll acknowledge that I've had none better. I think hefeweizen is just not my thing."
""

"One of the best beers crafted...ever. So smooth, so tasty, ripe bananas, bread/yeast, spices. Delicious. I would rank this my second favorite Hefe beer next to the Ayinger Bräu Weisse. I reviewed that beer already and I think I gave this Weihenstephaner beer a better review, haha, oh well. I just LOVE the really forward banana flavor of the Ayinger and the champagne mouthfeel. Its just a matter of preference. If you handed me either one of these beers I'd give you my first born child. The Weihenstephaner is a better deal though. I can get it for less than $2 a bottle (11.2oz) while the Ayinger is about $3.50 (16oz) a bottle (it has about 5oz more of yummy juice though)."
""

"Overall, a top-shelf hefeweizen that everyone should try. Sessionable, affordable, and delicious, it is an excellent representation of the style."

"Pours a nice hazy light amber with a large amount of white foam. Aroma is strongly fruity, with strong yeast and sweet malt. Tastes like a classic, iconic take on the style, cloves and allspice, banana and perhaps another tropical flavor like subtle mango, more hops than other examples of the style which cut the intense sweetness but not enough to wreck the sweetness or push it too far away, a near perfect balance really. Where Ayinger is weighted towards the fruit, this one leans towards the spice, with a strong clove flavor building as you progress through a bottle. Finish lingers and leaves some yeasty sweetness and a little bitterness. Overall, complex and layered flavors that are light years away from an American wheat made with standard yeast."
""
""
""
"Bottle at The Jones B-Side in Gainesville. Pours a deep murky yellow with a one finger white head. Smells of banana, clove, yeast. Flavor is banana, pears, apples, clove, yeast with a nice crisp bitter hint and plenty of prickly carbonation. Easy drinking and light with plenty of flavor. This is just so right on and perfect for the style. Could drink it all day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden hazy color with a thick off white head. Smell is banana, cloves and spice and yeast. Taste is what you would expect bananas, cloves, spices and citrus. Medium body and prefect amount of carbonation. Great beer. Not a huge fan of wheat beers but this is one I could definitely drink more of."

"Awesome mouth feel; chewy, lots of wheat and and yeast. Slight citrus, with a little banana. Very very smooth and easy to drink but with big deep complex and smooth flavor. I live this beer, on tap and in the bottle. I never really had gotten in to beer until I was 28, then I tried this beer and ill I want to do is drink and did new beers to try. However, I have not found a beer as good as this one."
""
""
"overall. a very good beer, a nice choice for a refreshing beer if you don't want something too summery, and can easily be enjoyed year-round, which is actually probably its best feature. the only reason i didn't score it higher for taste and overall is that it did not stand out much compared to many other good hefeweizens i have had."
"O- Overall great beer I love to keep this one on tap its great in the summer but works in the fall and winter as well. My favorite Hefe!"
""
""
""
"Pour was slightly cloudy, smelled of banana and clove immediately. The mouthful was substantial. It tasted tropical, definitely banana, clove, maybe nutmeg. This beer is considered the standard for the style. It lives up to it's reputation but the mouthful and taste was just a little bit harsher than it's cousin Paulaner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: Its perfect the gold standard what more can you say, drink one period"
""
""
"O- There isn't so much of the banana aspect in this one. I know it's well regarded, and I agree it is good, but I thought this was more mild than my favorite weizens."
""

"Benchmark Hefeweizen that is hard to beat. Bold and not boring given its balanced but not timid bitterness and malts."

"Pours hazy bright gold with a nice healthy two finger white head. Smell is amazing belgian yeasy, banana, grassy, clove, some slight citrus. Taste starts with a smooth grassy hay, sweetness kicks in with banana, spice, some lemon. Mouthfeel is perfect; enough body to give you wheat flavor while still being thin enough to be refreshing. Overall this beer is a gold standard, I love grabbing this one. so accessible that its easy to forget how amazing it is. No beer lover should miss this."

""
"A: Full two fingers of foam, light tight bubbled head that drops to reveal some spotty lacing, light gold to medium yellow in color, some sediment is visible in the beer – 4.50, S: True to the style, the nose has loads of banana and clove with a light and fruity sweetness that reminds me of mountain papaya and bubblegum – 5.00, T: Tastes like lemon and clove, mildly tart and crisp, some yeastiness and biscuits, wheat is obvious and with a touch of spice – 4.25, M: Light and effervescent body – 4.00, D: Extremely drinkable and spot on to the style, nice all around – 4.00"

"O - I'd happily drink this all day. Amazingly balanced. This beer is outstanding."

""

"O - I might be a bit biased since I am a big fan of wheats, especially a sucker for German Hefe's, but this is literally my favorite beer. It is absolutely perfect beer for it's style; where every wheat in the world should be compared to and strives to be. Weihenstephaner has been open since 1040, and it shows from the quality and perfection of this beer."
""
"O- This is the beer that got me into better beers so I'm a bit biased. It still remains one of the best overall beers I've ever tasted."

"O: I have no doubts this is the benchmark of the style for good reason. This one is on my list of ""would purchase by the case"" beers."

"Probably the best hefeweiss I have ever had. The beer had a great balance of banana and clove in both the taste and the smell. The beer was very drinkable and could be sessioned easily. It poured a hazy yellow with nice white head that did not leave much of a lace. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall...EXCELLENT!"

""
""
"After much consideration I have concluded that this is my favorite beer. I love hefes and this is the king. This has officially unseated Delirium Tremens as my favorite beer."
"O: If you are looking for the best wheat beer in the world, I would strongly recommend picking a six pack of these up. It is the best example of a Bavarian Hefe Weissbier out there and you owe yourself the experience that this beer will provide. I am rating this beer as a wheat beer and therefore I'll give it a perfect 5/5 in all categories because this is what other wheat beers want to be. After almost 1,000 years of brewing it makes sense that the flavor and quality of this beer is where it is."

"O: I have to admit, I was as skeptical as you could be on this one... There's a local bar that serves German ales and this one is always the one being praised to no end. My skepticism has been put aside. This brew is every bit phenomenal as you hear. A must try, I must say!"

"WAY too much clove. Good color and head. Aftertaste was all clove as well. Some hints of citrus, very low hops flavor, was better ice cold as opposed to the 46 - 52 the bottle advised. 11.2 oz bottle, the six-pack cost almost ten dollars. I would classify it as a good beer, but certainly not the 98 it is getting here. It tastes like a seasonal, flavored offering to me. Maybe around the holidays with all of the other clove type spices and flavors.??"

"Pours a murky honey yellow with plenty of haze and a cloud like head of foam. In the glass it’s got style and beauty. The nose is bracing and not run away with fruity sweetness. Banana, wheat , earthy yeast, fruits, clove and as it warms a little - some pepper. The palate is immaculate with tall wheat, sweet biscuit and citric hops. It’s clean and civilized. Leaves with a small taste of alcohol and drier and drier as it drinks. A resounding hefe that dares to growl a little in the glass."
""
""
"My favorite Hefeweizen!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Edit: Revisited as part of a blind test against Ayinger. Pour was murky yellow, hazy. Very sweet gum and banana smell. The head was taller and fluffier than Ayinger. Sweet, good carbonation, smooth, clean, and crisp. Overall, still a delicious and prime example of a German Hefe."
"O - This is way more than I expected when I ordered it. The only reason I didn't put up 5's is my lack of experience. This beer is going to be like Heady Topper was for IPA's - it's going to set me out on the hunt for beers like this one. I wonder if I'll find one."

"Best Heff beer I've ever had. Says world's oldest brewery on the bottle and guess what... all that time Brewing has done them some good. Perfectly balanced. Nice nose and mouthfeel. Very smooth. I like banana and this is prevalent in this beer. Although banana is typically in heff beers. I bought my bottle for a little under $3 and it's the best $3 I've ever spent. I've seen other on tap but have not tried and want to. Do not pass this beer up. It's the perfect sunny day brew."
"O - This could easily be a daily Weissbier, if it were more accessible. I really don't have any complaints or suggested improvements; it's just a well-rounded, balanced, sweet beer."
"While Weihenstephan's hefe is very highly regarded, I wasn't really blown away by it, but then I admit to the style not being one of favorites. Still, it's as good as or better than any other hefe I've yet had, and it's something I'll be revisiting during the warm weather months."
""
"Poured into a Weizen glass. Slightly cloudy amber color. Poured with a thick foamy head with a good amount of lacing around the sides of the glass. Citrusy, malty smell. A very hop forward taste with a smooth malty finish. Doesn't leave a bitter taste afterward. It is definitely the cream of the crop when it comes to Hefeweizens. I am more of a hop head and drink mainly IPAs and high IBU pale ales, but I do enjoy a Hefe every once in a while. It was my first love when it came to craft beers after all."
""
""
""
""
"One of the better Hefe Weizen I have had. Needs to be cold with nice foam. Easily availble both in bottles and on tap. In my opinion one of the better standard Weizen available. Standard yes, but still not so standard as the ""big ones"" (Franziskaner, Paulaner, Erdinger etc)"

"My new go-to favorite for spring and summer. Wonderful balance and refreshment, after my beloved quads from the late fall/winter. Glorious pale golden color with just a hint of the wheat haze. Clean and crisp from start to finish, with a bit of banana and freshly-baked bread."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy honey color with a thick cap of fluffy, white foam. Aroma smells cleanly of banana and clove, with perhaps a hint of what smells like coriander. Flavor matches the nose, with banana and clove complementing a refined wheat flavor. The wheat becomes most pronounced in the finish, while the front end remains more juicy. Yeast character lends some nice complexity and texture as well. The mouthfeel is spectacular, with lively, velvety carbonation that caresses the palate and enhances the quintessential flavors of the beer. This is the hefeweizen to which all other hefeweizens are compared. It's supremely balanced, perfectly executed, and possessed of perhaps the most enjoyable mouthfeel of any beer, regardless of style--undoubtedly world class."

"overall: Best Hefeweizen out there, period. For the style, it is absolutely perfect. In order I would say it goes Weihenstephaner, Franziskaner, then Paulaner as the best authentic german hefe's. So well balanced and drinkable, if you hand this to a non beer drinker, they will love it, very accesible."

"This is it. King of the Hefeweizens. It's a beautiful, creamy, cloudy, light orange colored delight. The head quickly goes away, but the thin lace that is left is bigger than most and a chunkiness sticks to the sides of the glass. The taste follows the smell almost exactly the same. It is so balanced. Banana and bubblegum don't overwhelm. The spicy and pepper notes lace the predominant lemon and wheat goodness. I will get this again."

"Pours like a liquid orange. Appears as such, for sure. Intricate lacing on the head. Now to the real draw. I may just as well have a mouth full of caramel. Richness and depth rules the day. I profess being impressed at a beer I hesitate to swallow, o but I do. Citrus, the richest, creamiest citrus in all the land. King among wheats."

"What a wonderful change from my full speed ahead IPA's & DIPA's. Wife saw case and said spring for it and it is quite delightful. Rarely do I spurge on such good beer but I have been dying for something alittle mellow so went for it. Nice rich color with a thick foam head and the smell of cloves and banana's very nice. Great, great desert beer, but still holding that beer geek flag high!!"

"O - I was excited to try this beer. Heck, it's the #1 rated Hefeweizen on the site after withstanding thousands of reviews. I can understand why, for this style, many consider this to be the best of the best: clearly there's an artistry to the elegance of this beer's execution. It's just very unfortunate that I don't find that terribly exciting."

"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Appearance is a cloudy gold with a big creamy white head that lasts well into the beer and leaves nice lacing. Aroma is wonderful, with notes of banana, bread, and other fruity esters. Taste is great with all the wonderful aromas present. While the carbonation is visible in the glass, it doesn't overwhelm the beer and it's thinner mouthfeel. Overall a great weiss beer."

"Overall-probably the best German beer I have ever had. Weihenstephaner claims to be the oldest brewery and I don't doubt it with this brew. This beer tastes like its been perfected over the last couple hundred of years. The price isn't to bad and it should be available in most markets, this is going to be my go to German brew. 4.5"

"I first tried this on tap when I was visiting Berlin, and I seek it out whenever I can. The Weihenstephaner is my favorite wheat beer, with notes of banana and bubblegum, and a smooth, clean finish. No need to add a slice of citrus to this beer, as its full of flavor, and requires nothing more."

"Backlog: This was the first truly craft beer that I had ever tried, and I remember it fondly even though I might not have been able to fully appreciate its aesthetics and complexity at the time. I was also an idiot and drank it straight from the bottle but that didn't stop it from being delicious. Bought a single from Wegmans for about $3. My first impressions likened this beer to fresh banana bread with some clove, and it was very smooth and easy to drink. Had a good combination of bitterness and sweetness that was both subtle and pleasant in character. A definite treat and the best wheat beer I’ve tried to this date."
""
""
""
""
"an outstanding brew, and probably the cheapest highly rated beer here on BA at under 4 bucks a bottle. pours murky orange color, brassy and hard to see through. thicker than a normal hefe, with a huge three inches of lasting bone white head. smells great too, some traditional banana notes, but hardly any of that clove spice yeast aroma. more floral than that, like a dewey spring meadow, clovery, heavy on the malted wheat. flavor also has the springtime essence, slightly floral again, which goes great with the fruity yeast and banana bread malt vibe. finish is a little sweet, a little bitter, a loaded with citrus juice. fuller body for the style is the appeal here, its really soft, but its big for a wheat beer. carbonation is lively, making this an easy drinking beer. honestly one of the best wheat beers I can remember drinking, the yeast is subtle but distinct, and that's what makes it. this is going to become a regular in my fridge for the combination of quality and value. many thanks for this one."

"If you could only have one hefe in your life, make it this one. I had this with a lovely fish dish at a restaurant on Ocracoke Island, and it has changed me. I always have this available in my fridge. Few other hefe's rival this one; most just look upon Weihenstephaner's work and despair."
""
""
""
"This is a nice, refreshing beer with a decent flavor profile. The yeast imparts fantastic banana notes and some underlying bubblegum notes. The spice character is also nicely done. I really enjoyed this beer. It was an easy to drink, flavorful, refreshing offering. I'll definitely have it again."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass at wine country in Shreveport. I ticked the appearance a bit low knowing it would probably look better in a proper glass. Pours a healthy orange with good foamy head. Amazing banana and clove yeasty aromas that follow through into the flavor. A nice punch of citrus in the finish. Its super smooth. This is another perfect example of how a hefe should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a huge bubbly white head that transforms into meringue on top. A steady stream of carbonation bubbly rise from the bottom causing a seemingly endless head. Smells of banana, bubble gum and a hint of pepper, nutmeg and allspice. A lightly sugary sweet malt provides a backdrop for the showcase of yeasty aromas. the flavor is lightly sweet malt with a bready yeasty taste. Medium to thin body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel. This is a really nice beer! I guess if you've been doing this that long you are bound to get it right."
"Overall: My first perfect 5 beer, and one that will always remain a favorite of mine. Nothing quite beats it as an easy drinking all around tasty beer."

"Now, I must admit that I do not like wheat beers. The wheat twang kills it for me. If I were to rate this to my opinion, it would be 5/3/3/3/3, where my 5 would be given to the presentation of the beer. Take that as you will, I suppose."

"O - Pretty solid, but honestly I was expecting better based on reputation. I'd like to try this on draft sometime to see if it's markedly better. A solid hefeweizen that I will definitely drink again, but not the best I've had."
""
""
"The showcase is somewhat nearly immaculate with a hazy yellow amber color and a thick fluffy white head. When the head retention and lacing left are exceptional, the aroma and flavor drive forth so mellow, inviting, fresh yet balance with a big touch of fruity ester, citric/lemony zest and bubblegum that nicely parade with a sweet biscuity malt and clove with a spice while wheat with a twang. The feel is smooth with a velvety body and refreshingly crispness/dryness. No doubt this beer is cult, my veneration to the old Weihenstephan again."

"** Claims to be the oldest brewery in the world - whether it is true or not is irrelevant."
""
""
"The beer tastes richly of bubblegum banana with clove spice notes. The beer begins with bubblegum and spice; just as it is building in flavor a slight yeasty funk can be felt in the taste, but is quickly washed away by the big banana bread flavors that have been building in the mouth. This eventually wanes down into a banana aftertaste with light clove and bubblegum hints at the sides of the tongue. The mouthfeel of this beer is superbly creamy, with light carbonation and a medium to slightly heavy and leaves the mouth with a thick sticky feeling on the tongue while the mouth as a whole feels clean, but slightly coated in candied banana. Overall, this is a superb hefeweizen, as would be expected from the oldest brewery in the world. I hold this up there with Zero Gravities Weizenheimer as the best in the style. A superb beer that epitomizes and optimizes the style beautifully. This beer is a must try."

""

"Pale golden-yellow pour, hazy, with a tall fluffy white head; decent retention and a bit of lacing. Yeasty aroma, bready, banana esters, clovey spice, pretty much exemplary of the style. The taste reflects the nose, pale bready malts, doughy, toasted wheat, classic hefe yeast, banana and clove. Medium body, fairly smooth mouthfeel, soft carbonation. This is where you go for a no-nonsense hefeweizen."
"Overall: These guys have been brewing this one for a while, so I imagine that they have perfected this style. I would tend to agree. For some strange reason, this one is not available in Utah, and that is a shame."
""
""
"The claims they make about this beer aren't false or even exaggerated - this is some truly great stuff, here. One of (if not, THE) best hefe I've had - this is quickly becoming one of my favorite session beers; great flavor, low ABV, goes down smooth. What's not to love?"

"Poured a nice, vibrant amber with a thick white head that diminishes slowly over the course of the 500ml beer. The taste is about what I remember from enjoying this beer frequently while living in Germany, still a nice fruit finish and that wonderful hefe mouthfeel. Overall a great buy, especially for someone looking for a more authentic German experience thanks in large to the 500ml service size. Of all of the wonderful beers I had in Germany, this one seems closest to the real deal as any I've had."

"Pours a hazy, golden-hued liquid into a weissbier glass. Head is perfect as not too much and not too little. Lacing is light. Smell is light citrus, bright cloves and subtle malt. Mouthfeel is light on carbonation and alcohol. Taste is a brilliant explosion of malt, bready yeast, clove/banana and delicate sweetness. Finish is smoother than water off a duck's back. No bitterness at all. While most weissbiers lean one way or the other on the sweetness scale, Weihenstepher nails the balance perfectly. One of the best beers in the world."

"O – This is an absolutely fantastic hefeweizen. It’s easy to see why it’s rated the best. Everything is so nearly perfect for the style that it’s tough to not give this one 5s across the board. The fact that it’s so readily available in the US makes it even better. Without a doubt, this is a must try for all beer-lovers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap pours cloudy with white head. Aroma is clove and banana. High carbonation adds to the tingly mouthfeel. Flavor is a perfect balance of clove and banana and is the best beer to represent this style. Upfront you get the tingly carbonation, then the banana clove hits the middle and finishes semi dry Outstanding."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a fine example of how to brew a wheat beer that is drinkable on a hot summer day without tasting like a watered-down mess. It has more backbone than most wheats without tasting gimmicky."

""
""
""
"So simple man I think works well this this wheat."
""
""
""
""
"500 mL bottle. Pours a murky dark yellow with a decent two-finger white head. Fairly high carbonation. Nose of yeast, bananas, orange peel, lemon zest- standard wheat beer. Taste brings out some cloves and citrus tartness. Fairly light bodied but excellent. Nice dry finish. Inferior to New Glarus hefeweizens. 12/7/2008 7/4/7/4/14=3.6"
"Simply put, one of the world's greatest beers. All the characteristics of weissbier are superbly blended together - the yeast esters produce a fantastically balanced flavour and aroma. An easy-drinking classic; very refreshing and I could happily imagine sinking a few. Add this to your list of must-try beers."

"O: I cannot imagine a better hefeweizen. The challenge is to not give this beer 5's across the boards - but I honestly don't think this recipe can be improved upon or bettered. This is a seemingly perfect beer of the style, but have allowed for personal tastes and such. Certainly a hefe you must have when exploring the style."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. One of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The simplicity of it blows me away. This is one of those beers that should illustrate that yeast doesn't just add fizz and alcohol to a beer, but actually makes the style."
"Overall a fantastic beer and you dont have to be a beer wiz to tell. It Proves that you dont need an overwhelming amount of ingredients/flavors to make an excellent brew."
"After a week or so of devouring stouts and porters, I tried this one at the behest of my girlfriend. As is almost always the case, she was right. This is a good beer. It pours and looks like a typical American lager in some ways, but that is where that comparison ends for me. Right away I was struck but a banana smell and taste. I didn't expect that, for I had never had a banana tasting beer before. I quite liked it. Overall, this is an easy-to-drink refreshing lighter beer that is very satisfying in its splendid and unique taste. Me gusta."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Certainly the best hefe I have tried. This is a style that is hit or miss for me as I lean more towards the banana flavors than the clove flavors. This one is very banana heavy with just a touch of that spicy clove. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a very good wheat beer that is perfect on a hot summer day. While it is not my favorite style of beer it definitely does this category justice. Would buy again."

"Golden yellow in color with a slight unfiltered haze. Poured with a tall, rocky white foam with good staying power. Sweet ripe banana and spicy clove aromas with bready and yeasty hints in the background. Rich, smooth feel with refreshing crisp carbonation. Sweet banana flavors down the middle with clove around the edges. A touch of tangy bitterness toward the end as this finishes crisply and cleanly. An extraordinary summertime ale."
"I get it, this is a really great beer. It's definitely the best German Hefeweizen I've ever had. I just don't think the style is for me. That banana & clove combo just doesn't make it a beer I can fully enjoy. Again, I'll reiterate, this is by far the best beer I've had in this style. I can appreciate one when it's good, even if I don't reach for it voluntarily."
"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a dark golden yellow with two fingers of white foam and lacing. Wonderful aroma of clove, banana and wheat. Dry wheat start and middle with banana and a pleasant, spicy aftertaste of cloves. A nice well integrated, tasty wheat beer, very nice. This beer blew my mind the first time I had tried it, really the first time I had a light colored, relatively low ABV beer that tasted fantastic. One of the world's great beers."

"The color is a beautiful amber. The taste is light with definite citrus. The only place where this beer lost any points in my book was in carbonation. On-tap it didn't seem overly carbonated but when I had a bottle of it my first pour had a lot of head and seemed about right. The second pour I may have been to gentle and the carbonation definitely got in the way of what I would consider the perfect mouthfeel."
""

""
""

""
"O: Excellently crafted, an archetype of the style."

"Taste was great! The smell made me think the taste would tend toward the bitter but here the fruit came more to the front. It wasn't as sweet as some american versions but very palatable with more hops. I picked this up with no expectations or foreknowledge of the brand. I just knew it was a Hefeweizen I hadn't tried yet. My new benchmark!"
""
"Very nice hefeweizen. Never tasted such strong banana notes before in a beer. Great drinkability and magnificent in the summer. This bottle held up very well despite being two and a half months away from the best before date. I am curious to see how much better it is fresh."

""
"O - In my opinon the best of the style. Others try to do what this does but are simply caught short. A truly wonderful brew that any enthusiast should seek."

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy, yeasty golden color with a two finger fluffy white head that receded to a ring of white foam leaving lacing on the glass. An excellent appearance, very true to style. Near flawless. Scents of clove, banana, slight citrus, some wheat malt and a low level of vanilla. A very good aroma profile that hits the style dead-on. Nothing is off, everything is present and it's all fantastic. Very nice. Flavor begins with spicy cloves phenols and a bit of banana esters, moving into more clove phenols but now balanced equally with banana esters and a slight citrus-like sourness. An undertone of cracker-like malt is present throughout the entire sip. Finishes with an equal balance of banana esters and clove phenols, with a slight lemony sourness. Aftertaste is spicy clove phenols and faint banana esters. An excellent flavor profile. The main flavors of the style reveal themselves in full form and several of the optional flavors also come into play. Very well done, balanced and refreshing, perfect. Mouthfeel is light bodied, effervescent with high carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. A very nice, refreshing mouthfeel that is perfectly true to style. Overall this is an amazing hefeweizen. Everything about it is a perfect representation of the style, and this is my number one recommendation to anyone who wants to try a good Bavarian hefeweizen."
"They say there is a drought out there, but I can't believe it as long as I have one of these in my hand!"

"A great beer, maybe I will seek it again after I finish my three other bottles."

"The pour is great! It's a cloudy golden-yellow with lovely thick head. Smell, bananas and clove (as it should be). The taste was light banana, little clove when taken with some of the head. Without taking in the head with a drink, the banana was distinct and complimented well by clove and a wheat-like taste that fills the mouth. It isn't super yeasty. Carbonation and head adds to a splendid mouth-feel."

Very nice fruity/bready flavor that is well-balanced, full of flavor, and very pleasant combined with an insane drinkability you have a very fine beer. Highly recommended, I will probably be picking up more of these."
"Overall: Hands down the best hefeweizen in the world. There is no question about it. One of my favorite all time beers and my go-to for the summer months. The balance and drinkability (aside from the taste) is what sets this beer apart from the other hefeweizens. You can drink your pale ales and IPAs in the summer, I'll take a Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier!!"
"Overall I really like this beer. Very refreshing and see why it's well liked. This will definitely be a part of the rotation during these summer months and may find myself drinking this from time to time year round. Very delicious."

"The perfect hefeweizen? Maybe. I haven't tried enough to say, but it's definitely the best one I've had."
"Pours a hazy gold colour with a big, beautiful white head that leaves lacing on the glass. Smells of yeast, wheat, malt, banana and cloves. Tastes just like it smells. Big wheat and yeast flavour, some spiciness, wheat/malt backbone, with some green apples, banana and a bit of bubblegum. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nicely carbonated, smooth, dry and a bit tart. Overall, a nice beer to have on a hot day."

"Tasted this on tap at Uptown Pub. Only had a sampling but what I tasted was excellent. Would definitely get this in the future, and i look forward to doing a more in depth review. Thick creamy head, rich mouthfeel, banana clove and wheat flavors prominent, extremely smooth. Incredibly balanced and thick mouthfeel, I cannot exclaim that enough. Fantastic brew overall."
"Poured from the bottle into a hefe glass. Pours the color of a fresh orange at first, and then when the yeast is added it turns a dark, hazy coppery orange color. I had to pour this beer, walk away, and then come back to finish the pour; the head was huge, fluffy, like a giant cloud with no lacing left as I drink it. The nose is very bright citrus, orange, coriander, and white bread. The taste is again full of bright citrus notes, with banana and yeasty sweetness. The mouthfeel is very creamy with the a nice touch of carbonation. Very delightful. Overall, this beer is a fantastic hefe that I've been looking forward to trying. It's a great representative of the style and hits all the right points perfectly. I will definitely stock this for the summer."
"This is a relatively simple beer, but it has great strength in its simplicity. The wheaty malt profile and the yeast come together in a remarkable way. The balance works better than any Hefeweizen I've ever tasted. Seriously. I should have had this years ago."

"overall: A fine beer, but it's not my favorite Weiss beer. I didn't find that flavor making this a really special one like some others do. So i find it a bit overrated. I prefer the Konig Ludwig or Paulaner over this one. Also the Wiehenstephaner Vitus is more like how i like it. Still a very nice, refreshing and tasteful beer though."

"Pours exactly as expected; a large, puffy white head and a thick, cloudy body that is yellow-orange. A thin film of white remains after the head dissipates. Smells of bananas and other sweet things. Not the slightest bit of alcohol in the smell or taste. Taste largely mirrors the smell. The mouthfeel is a little off-putting. I feel it is too carbonated for the style and makes an otherwise smooth brew a little spiky. Overall, the beer is a classic. It also makes for a good summer beer, nice and refreshing."
""
"I'm impressed with the overall quality of this beer. The smell is not overpowering, giving off mild hints of Banana but primarily hops, malt, and spices. The appearance was average, but I must say after pouring this beer into a glass it does leave behind a nice head. What I was most impressed with was the mouthfeel and the unique taste. The mouthfeel was very creamy and smooth, with essentially no bitter points whatsoever. The hoppy smell threw me off a little bit, because there are so many other flavors that strike you prior to the slight hop aftertaste. Above else, cloves were the first thing I could taste. Banana was probably the second most pungent flavor, followed by wheat, yeast, malt, a bit of caramel, and hops. Overall a pretty solid beer. Not one of my favorite, but definitely something different and for its class a very good brew. I'd give it a 8/10."

"I picked up another bottle, primarily to compare this one side-by-side with some other German hefes (Schneider-Weisse, Erdinger, and Paulaner). Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier remains one of my favourite wheat beers of all time, and it is easily my favourite hefeweizen - unbelievably drinkable, absurdly smooth and delicious as hell. The only problem with this beer is that it's not as widely-distributed/reliably available as the other three in these parts... but I can't say I'm surprised, as this is a world-class beer that people should be buying by the armful. A must-try."

"12 fl. oz. bottle marked 8461. Sampled on May 20, 2012. When this brewery was founded in 1040 AD, I wonder if the very first brewmaster expected it would still be around nearly 1,000 years later. But with the cloudy, heady pale yellow pour leading up to a tremendous aroma of pale malts, banana, clove, and yeast, I can imagine how an 11th Century beer drinker must have been refreshed on a warm medieval day. The light body is satisfying for the style. There is a slight zing of citrus goodness in the taste with the same flavor sensations that were introduced by way of the nose. It finishes clean and easy. The original is still one of the best in the world."

"Beer pours a gorgeous hazy yellow-orange with a fluffy white head. Maybe it's seeing it in the Weihenstephan glass, but this beer looks fantastic. Smell is awesome as well, perfect hefeweizen aroma of banana and clove. Flavor follows the nose, this pretty much epitomizes what a hefeweizen should be. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is probably the best year-round, easy-to-get hefe in existence. It's a great beer for a hot day, and very refreshing. The only things that hold this back from a higher score are that 1) hefeweizens aren't my favorite style and 2) it's not quite on the level of my two favorite hefes, the Andechs and the Live Oak."

"Pours hazy yellow with a towering white head that dissipates slowly. There is excellent head retention. The aroma is of malt and yeast with banana and citrus. It's a bold and inviting smell. The taste is exactly like the beer smells. It has flavors of wheat and barley malts, yeast, citrus, and banana. There's a mild spiciness in the flavor as well. The flavors are very well balanced. The body is light. This is a very smooth and refreshing beer. The finish is crisp and dry. Overall, this is an excellent beer and a great example of this style."

The epitome of the hefe. Lemon cookies, juicy orange, faint vanilla, banana esters, mild clove, mild hop character background, and smooth vanilla rides it out. Smooth mouthfeel with mild carbonation. A gorgeous display of what an iconic brewery can achieve."

"Finally I found this. I had heard so much about it here and elsewhere as the undisputed champ of hefes. So there it was at the bar out of nowhere and I pounced on it. Hmm. Well, it was fine, but... I don't get all the crazy praise for it. It was good but didn't do much more for me than other hefes, which I'm starting to have my doubts about. I'm wondering if the style is a narrow one, in which the differences between different offerings are small. If you served this to me I'd be happy enough, but rather than buy it again I'd rather explore other untried options. I will say it had a very pretty snowy white head. Seems like a good example of the style but I was let down that it wasn't crazy turbo good like the hype suggested. Or maybe I'm just not a hefe guy."
"I am not a beer master, but I have had my fair share (much more than I have had a chance to review for this site) and the flavor of this beer is phenomenal. I bought it from Atlantic Liquors in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware (funny website, ridiculous store) not knowing what a reputation it had! Very surprised when I first tasted it then I came here to review and saw the scores it had received...what a great beer! A must try, no matter what your likes or experiences in the world of beer."

"A crisp sour sting of carbonation with some light lemony notes hits up front backed by banana notes giving way to an olive smoothness followed by a nutty round mouth feel with wheat notes. Slight fruit notes are detected in some of the bitterness, like the bite of raspberry without any of the sweetness. This is a delightfully complex beer perfect for a warm evening."

"A very good overall Weizen with a good head and taste. The head is produced with very fine bubbles, a mark of a very good brew. A fair amount of hefe but not a lot.

I could drink this all day long, textbook hefe, when I'm in the mood for the style one of these is certainly in order."

"O - Utterly drinkable and quality brew. Truly a remarkable beer."
"Overall - Its all about preference. This has all the characteristics of a great hefeweizen, its still relatively easy-drinking; but its a bit more fuller and bolder in taste, and that makes this great in its own way. You won't be disappointed here."

"Probably the best, purest, most balanced Hefeweizen I have ever had."

"Overall: This got me onto Weissbiers but I've tried loads since then and this is pretty unremarkable compared to a lot of others. In my opinion it's one of the most overrated beers on BA."
"Bought this last night from Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo. Excited about this one because I saw it has the highest ranking for hefes here on BA. DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Poured it into a new Paulaner hefe glass (also purchased at Tanakaya), and enjoyed enjoyed enjoyed! The head on this is ridiculously amazing, delicious and long-lasting, lacing the glass like a frappe. Loved watching all the particles float around in the glass, heightening the smell of orange and wheat and the taste of the same. The only thing I could ask for is a bit thicker of a brew just to give my tongue something else to play with. Other than that, this is the best hefe I have ever had, and especially for the price (relatively cheap), I will be a fan of this for life! GET IT!"

"This pours a cloudy gold color with two finger width of off-white fluffy head that lingers and laces extremely well. Right on top I get clove, banana, and great floral aroma. great taste that just cleans you palate with every drink great subtle hint of all the flavors from the nose then I pick up a great bready flavor along with a wheat taste that comes with every beer in this style. This is medium bodied with medium to high amount of carbonation but nothing out of line with the style. This is the pinnacle of this style all other hefe's get compared to this, this beer is the gold standard of Hefe's."
"Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is a textbook example of a classic Hef that achieves the pinnacle of the style. Poured into a belgian hefeweissbier glass, the beer stands tall with a pure white, soft bubbly foam head that tantalizes you to take a sip. Upon first sip, one instantly recognizes that hearty wheat flavor, combined with a comfortable, relaxed, light body mouth feel that is extremely satisfying. After a few sips one begins to appreciate the subtle complexity of the beer, with orange and light citrus hints as well as the classic German yeasty-malty flavor. Perfect beer with a light meal or on it's own, one never tires of a cold Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier."

"O: its one hell of a beer, quite possibly the best for the style, very highly drinkable and delicious"

"it has a slight lean towards the bitterness of earthy hops and yeast than most, but in my opinion is the epitomy of german weisse bier."
""
""
"Overall: Outstanding Hefeweizen in every single category. This beer, by far, ranks up there at the top of its class. At only 5.4% ABV, this makes for the perfect flavorful all-year-round session beer. I can imagine this being quite the quencher during the summer months but if I’m being totally honest, I’m enjoying the heck out of this in the middle of February. I'm glad I committed to buying a few bottles of this. Well done Weihenstephaner, well done…"

"O: This is another fantastic German Wit. I am biased because this is one of my favorite styles but this is a great drinking beer.

"Hands down the best hefeweizen, the Germans invented the style and they sure do know how to make em. The only American hefe that comes close is SN's Kellerweiss. Light bodied and full of flavor with none of the off tastes that inferior beers of the style so often have. I feel pity for the person who lets blue moon be the beginning and end of their foray into wheat beers. If the head had held up better and the smells had hit harder this would be a perfect beer. I long for the day I can try this one fresh at the brewery."
"O - I can see why this is considered the gold standard for Hefe's. It really is an awesome beer."
"On a side note, it's interesting that this brewer of a wheat beer makes the claim, ""brewed under the purity law of 1516"" when wheat was specifically forbidden by that law (but I guess it sounds better for marketing than saying, ""brewed under the provisional German beer law of 1993"")"

"On the palate, the Weihenstephaner is flavorful and complex, yet so incredible easy to drink!

This is an absolutely delicious brew that I highly recommend for anyone who ever considered those mediocre mass-produced imitations."

"O: The fact that I can get this beer locally for less than $2.50 will lead me to have it more and more often.

"If you want an archetype of the hefeweissen style, this is it. Pours a beautiful deep yellow gold color that leaves a nice two finger white head that slowly recedes and leaves plenty of lacing. Smells of wheat, banana, citrus. Taste is on point for a hefe; nicely balanced wheat, citrus, banana, and a light bitterness at the end. Everything about this beer in the taste department is done brilliantly. Mouthfeel is good, fairly light overall and easy to drink a pint or two. All in all, if you want a good hefe, this is the one to go to."

This looks like a beer should look when poured. hazy straw colored, with a solid 2 finger head that leaves plenty of lacing and carbonation filling the glass. its smells of citrus and funk and makes your mouth water. The wheat flavor is up front with good funk finishing up with a crisp refeshing mouthfeel and a bit floral at the end. This is well done and could stand up nexrt to just about anythings the state try and produce in this wheat variety. Bravo German brew dudes."

"500 ml bottle. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a huge 3 finger dense white head with incredible retention that reduces to a cap that stays for the remainder of the glass. Thick lacing clings around the glass as well, incredible. Aromas of big banana, clove, bubblegum, pepper, lemon, and spicy yeast. Fantastic aromas here with great balance and strength. Taste of big clove, pepper, banana, bubblegum, lemon, bread, and spicy yeast. Light bitterness on the finish that lingers with citrus, pepper, banana, and spices for a bit. Extremely smooth and slightly creamy medium sized body. Fairly lively carbonation that dies down as I make my way through the glass. Extremely well balanced with the flavor profile as well. Overall this is an absolutely incredible wheat beer; and the definition of a hefeweizen in my opinion. I will keep coming back to this one at only $3 for a half liter at the store."
"Wonderful, quite a treat."

"Overall - a great evening beer that should be enjoyed often."
"Overall - Perfect example of the style, very easy to drink, smooth, tasty and light. Perfect for a summer drink, or with some meat feature dishes, this is bout as good as it gets for hefeweizen."

"Pours a hazy, golden/lemon yellow with nice tan head. Head does not last long and lacing is spotty. Aroma is sweet grass and malt. Taste is incredibly smooth and refreshing. Citrusy notes. Amusing aftertaste, tingly carbonation."
