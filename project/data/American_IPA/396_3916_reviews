"Wow, One of the best IPAs I’ve ever had. Not sure why I’ve always passed up on this one. Excellent example of what an IPA should be. Deep golden amber pour. Huge floral aroma. Very flowery beer. Sharp resin bitter taste, followed by hints of floral notes and strong fruity citrus notes."

"The Verdict: Delicious. Well balanced between hops and malts and between sweet and bitter. Great example of what an IPA should be."
"Enjoyed it.  Above average, but I didn't experience anything deserving of high ratings."

"loved this IPA, very complex."

"A rather well balanced IPA...not exactly what I expected from a SD brewery but pleasant nonetheless (although I certainly don't object to hop bombs!). The bready maltiness actually dominates on both the nose and tongue for me. The fruity and bitter elements from the hops are there but pretty subtle when compared to a lot of other west coast IPAs. This is a real quality brew, but, considering the cost, I'm not sure I'll come back to it anytime soon....a couple more bucks will get me a sixer of some other great stuff."
"So smooth for an ipa this is a must try"
""

"(bottle, 22oz) Good at first, but one dimensional (2/8/15)"

"Maple syrup sweet, tangerine, herbal hops. Nice bitter bite, good balance. Good IPA."

"color is a clear copper, pours a finger of white head that retains well and is reinforced by a steady stream of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. In the taste and the aroma there's lots of citrus fruit notes with some apples and pears in there too, with a nice, bready, malt backbone. very crisp and finishes cream, overall a really top notch IPA, Tasty, smooth, balanced, no bitterness."
"Delicious, but needs more balance and a fuller body. Love the color and the smell. Would order again."

"O: Still one of my favorite IPAs. First had it when I was out in San Diego, and have been on the search in NY since. I've come across it a few times since, with only a handful of times being this fresh. Will definitely go back out and pick more up tomorrow. For a 95 rating, this beer is so far under the radar its not even funny. Phenomenal IPA and a great guideline for other IPAs."
""
""
""
"Am I glad I didn't spring for the $12 bomber, or whatever insane it price it sells for. It's an excellent brew. But ""95""? I shake my head in wonder."
""
""
""
"If I dreamt of an ipa this is how it would taste.  Clean and refeshing.  Perfect balance of hop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy look, creamy.  Fantastic citrahop on the front pallet.  Smooth finish."
"I've had it on draft only but will taste it in a bottle when I see it to see if there is any difference. As long it is on draft at the local pub, I'm having one."
""
""
""
"Great ballance between hoppy and malty!"
"An awesome IPA, not too rough, not too sweet, with a really diverse flavor profile. It's so tasty you'd wish you had more."

"More pine and resinous notes as flavours along with some grapefruit and sweet clean malt. Finishes with an assertive, lasting bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. I wasn't expecting what this beer delivered. Should have expected it coming from Alesmith. Citrus notes, great hop bitterness, and solid body make this an exceptional IPA."
""
""
"Overall: Another fantastic San Diego IPA.  Excellent brew from an excellent brewery"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - superb IPA; if you're a fan of the style, then you'll love this beer!"
"Really good initial hoppy taste. Pretty hoppy and just the right amount of maltyness. It's kind of like lagunitas Maximus but with more malts. The only problem is the finish, there is an unpleasant bite on my palette"

"Overall:  A hard find here in the Boston area.  No bottle dating and hard to know how long it has sat on the shelves.  Either way, I'd have to say the beer was somewhat fresh and the hops held up nice.  I'll go back to the same store and get another bottle."

"Bitter grapefruit taste mixes well with medium bodied bready malt. Pine forest flavor is there with mandarin orange. Great texture. Perfect balance of crisp carbonation and smoothness makes it very drinkable."
""

""

"Light copper. Citrusy nose with some pine notes as well. Nice balanced flavor but a little light in the hop department even for a single IPA."

"Fairly balanced IPA at the beginning but what bittering there is takes over the flavor and just leaves a tacky, resinous feel lingering with you."

""
""
""
""
""
"Amazing, grapefruit and tangerine in the beginning and piney hops at the finish.  I love it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a light yellow color with a one finger thick white head.  Smells of pine, pineapple,  mango,  orange peel, the slight burn of alcohol. Taste is grapefruit and a lingering resin bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Creamy medium body with medium high carbonation with a very fine bead."
""
"O: This is a great IPA.  After having it a 2nd time, I've upped my rating from a 4 to a 4.5. I really enjoyed this much better after having it before and now I'm glad that the stores nearby carry it locally."

"o. My scores average out to a 4 - not sure but I will go there. If you are an IPA purist - heavy on the hops taste - you may not like this as much as others. It is an outstanding beer overall."

"O: A very nice IPA. You can tell this recipe has been honed. Balanced, hoppy, and fun. Classic west coast style..."
""
"Great complexity of flavors for an IPA, with lots of citrus and fruit notes accompanied by hop-appropriate herbal and spice notes. The aroma is fantastic and fresh even out of this older bottle. This beer is definitely one that lives up to the hype. It's a bit harder to find and a bit more expensive than I would like but I think it rests in the top 5% of the crowded IPA landscape and thus the elite pricing is deserved."

"Absolute perfect example of an America IPA. Beautiful aromatics and flavors of tropical fruit followed by bright citrus and piney bitterness. Great lacing in a pint glass. It finishes with a welcome bitterness that lingers pleasantly on the palate. This is the IPA that most IPA's want to be when they grow up."

"22 oz bottle. Pours hazy orange with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, tropical fruit and caramel malt. Body is full and tangy. Citrusy and piney hops, alcohol, caramel and bready malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long, dry, and grapefruity. Excellent brew."

"I've heard a lot of good things about Alesmith. As a recent Maryland transplant in California, I was very much eager to try any beer from this brewery. The beer poured a yellowish-amber hybrid with a good head--even if it dissipated relatively quickly. The aroma was a lot maltier than I expected with a distinct resinous hop note. The taste is sublime. The strong hopiness hits the palate first, but it is married with the malt to the point that it becomes one indistinguishable flavor--a very, very good thing. The balance of this IPA is impressive and has become a serious challenger to DFH 90 min for favorite IPA. I feel like I need to run out and get a 4-pack of DFH to compare immediately."

"At $4.99 this is decent brew but one that is reserved for the dipa/malt lover imo."

""
""

"Overall, this is another Alesmith brew that did not meet the hype for me. Good, but not incredible. There is such a large variety of IPAs that I can purchase locally that blow it out of the water hands down. Worth sampling, but a trip to Wisconsin for Alesmith is only worth it for Speedway Stout and Wee Heavy."

"Pours medium dark amber, nice head, nice lacing. Nose is big, lots of pronounced hops and malt. Starts pine and grapefruit, ends up with a nice malty background. Very well balanced with hop bitterness backed up by just the right amount of sweet, toasty, caramel malt. Mouthfeel is good, medium to full bodied for an IPA. Overall I'm a fan. Enjoyed this offering more than their DIPA."

"Ultra-clear orange with a very nice slab of thick, lumpy foam on top. Aromas of tangerine, lemon, and peach alongside pine and light toast. Floral hops and black pepper notes intertwine with the fruit. Classic IPA grapefruit and slight bitter pine resin, lingering citrus oils, floral and slightly leafy, with some fruity, peachy dankness. Medium bodied, crisp, with a tidy bitterness. This was a very enjoyable, classic West Coast IPA that I'm glad to see on the shelves in NC."
""
""
""
"Overall, this was an ok IPA. I was expecting a lot more based on brewery and rep. Dankness was enjoyable and good, but rather one note and somewhat flat in taste profile."

"O- Very great. Smooth, and bitterness isn't the big player. My kind of IPA."
""
""
"Formed a nice creamy head in pint bitters glass, kept lacing and head to the bottom. Seemed to get better as the glass emptied, aroma not great from the start but much better with some warming. Mouthfeel and aftertaste the winner for me, not too much carbination. Overall a wonderful IPA that could, for my taste, also be a session beer. Definitely wanted another after the first!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Bomber poured into willi glass. This is one awesome IPA. A golden orange with just a very slight haze and an ample white head that sticks around and leaves nice lace on the glass. Big hoppy aroma...pine, resin, citrus and some tropical fruit. Tastes amazing..crisp and refreshing with.nicely balanced hops and malty sweetness. A perfect example of a west coast IPA. This one is now very close to the top of my list."

"Outstanding West Coast IPA, definitely one of the best IPA around. Bold but also very clean, crisp and refreshing. Easy to drink, but sure it is not boring for hopheads. It is going towards a DIPA once it warms up. Highly recommendable."

"Light amber hued with incredible clarity. Easily a inch thick of tightly woven white head. Brussels lacing. Incredibly enticing aroma of piney hops. On the front of the palate I get bitter piney hops. I get biscuity malt and then a more subtle pine like hop fade. The mouth is surprisingly light and smooth."

""
""

"Pours a light golden yellow with a thin white head. Smell is citrusy and piney with a hint of sweetness. Taste follows the nose for the most part. Tropical fruit comes through a bit more as well. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Carbonation is what you'd expect from an IPA. Overall this is a great west coast IPA. I kinda wish Alesmith sold 12oz bottles though. I'd imagine Alesmith would be much more popular if they did."

""

"Overall an awesome traditional west coast IPA. If you only like super fruity IPAs this one may not be your favorite but anyone that appreciates IPAs as a diverse style will love it."

""
""

""
""
""
""
"O: This was one of my first IPAs, and I still love it. Nose is better than flavor, but definitely worth a try."
"Overall - This is a good, but not great, IPA. The beer lacks a solid malt foundation to build upon. As a result, the beer has a bitter yet thin feel to it. It lacks the overall balance of a Sierra Nevada or Firestone IPA. I am, however, giving this beer the benefit of the doubt because it hails from San Diego. Also, the bomber bottle is very cool."
""
""
"O-This a great San Diego IPA by Alesmith I need to get more from them"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"22oz serving out of a bottle that pours a clean golden copper color with a healthy two fingers of off-white foam. Big citrus upfront with a bready dank hoppy finish. Taste is a very hop forward citrus blend, with malty middle, and a sweet bitterness in the finish. Over all a terrific, true to form, west coast IPA. A beer that is readily available, consistent, and time in a time out a great go to beer."
"I've been passing over this one for a while now, for no particularly good reason. I'm glad I finally bit the bullet here and tried this- it was awesome."

"Overall/Comments: This was my first AleSmith offering and I was very impressed. This IPA had such a unique flavor profile and was very well done. If you can find this I would recommend trying it! Classified as an American IPA @ 7.25%. Consumed 6/23/2013."

"22oz bomber served in pint glass. Beer is a brilliant, crystal clear golden color, with a fat, foamy white head. Big, floral and Cascadey aroma. Flavor is similarly bright and hoppy, with a really pleasant grapefruit/citrus taste. Very smooth in mouthfeel, like an English IPA, with a creamy, almost oily, finish. No coincidence: lace is already forming on the glass. This is a great Left Coast American IPA. Aggressive and strong, but delicious and pleasant enough to be a standard bearer for the category."
"I am not a hop head at all, though this is really well made. Incredible balance, but at the same time amazing hop flavor. Highly recommended."

"O - Very good citrusy IPA. Easy drinking and highly recommended."
"Alesmith IPA is a great beer, very piney and citrusy with a nice substantial malt to it too. Great head retention, great taste, cool orange-amber color, a very stylish and tasty beverage. A worthwhile beverage any day of the week. However, a 22 of it is $6 compared to $5 for Gigantic Brewery's IPA just down the road, which I much prefer due to notes of orange rather than a mad Pine-Sol aroma, so I've got to give it a 4/5 due to my being a local beer snob."
"From my tasting notes: Another fantastic beer I brought back from my San Diego vacation. Alesmith’s IPA is bottle conditioned which poured a hazy golden copper with a great fruity aroma. What a great hoppy beer flavor without being too extreme. It has some malt in the background to give it a good balance and keeping it easy to drink. I hope it makes its way to Texas soon, as I need another one!"

"This is one of those IPAs that would be considered ""out of this world"" years ago. It still hangs in 2013. They just stick to the basics, which really works. This is a great IPA. Overall, it's simply hitting on all cylinders. It's nothing over the top, just well crafted and a nice example of a west-coast IPA. Recommended."

"The head was phenomenal on the first pour (tulip glass): full, tight, lacy. Excellent and rare aroma of pure piny hops, reminded me of Pliny the Elder. Absolutely first rate. I was surprised by the lack of carbonation thereafter. This is a fantastic IPA that I have wanted to taste for a long time, and finally got the chance after my local store stocked it. The mouthfeel and aftertaste scored lower for me because I expect carbonation, & the bitters at the back of my tongue seemed *just* a little slimy. But these are minor issues for a fantastic drink. And, my opinion is just that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great. Fits the style, very similar to a lot of other IPAs I have had. I love the bitterness at the end and love the citrus hop flavors you get out of it. All comes together really well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very drinkable, very good IPA. Glad the guy at the bottle shop recommended I take one home while I was visiting in California. Would definitely recommend and drink again at the $6 price point, if I had regular access to the beer."
""
"O - By far the most ""orange"" beer I've tasted, good IPA, good balance, lots of flavor, especially if you love orange."
""
""
""

"O - Highly disappointed. Bland bitter black tea was a heavy detractor. I did not enjoy and will not try again."

"It pours a dark copper, very transparent and not murky at all. It tasted extremely refreshing. The bitterness was perfectly blended with some sweet citrusy notes. It smells as good as it tastes, too. This is easily one of the more ""complete"" IPAs that I have had. I don't have a single complaint about it. I think it is very well done and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys IPAs and DIPAs"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall is very drinkable and tasty IPA, thirst quenching."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-While this brew impresses with looks and smell, the taste was a letdown. It is somewhat harsh and disjointed. It is as if the beer has an identity crisis between being a juicy, west-coast IPA and a bitter, pine-forward English IPA. The West Coast style emerges on the nose, but neither style comes out on the palate. I don't know where all the delicious fruit that I smell went when I drank this beer, but I miss it."

"Ale Smith is hands down my favorite IPA though I've only had it bottled. Way easier as a daily drinker than Pliny and has those floral citrus notes right in the head that we all love and then...nothing. No lingering sensations, no major bite at the back. It's all in the front and it's damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent aroma and flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent smell, right off I had my hopes up but the first taste was a bit over the top. I had to settle into this fine beer. Full bodied and then some....This is a slow drinking beer, just slow down and enjoy each taste, relax and let it happen. Perfect for a cold night and a good fire."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. Wish I could get it more, but with other IPAs just as good that this being almost 6 bucks a bomber I will be passing in the future.... ALESMITH you are big enough to make the switch to a more reasonable format!"

"O: I've never comented on how great a mouthfeel something has but I think it makes this beer. There are tons of good IPAs but something about the soft tiny bubbles mixed with moderate carbonation and a dry finish make this thing pop."

"Pours an orange-golden with a big white white head. Aroma is resinous, citrus and its rind, pine, and a slight hit of some bread. Flavor follows suit, finishing nice and dry. Decent amount of bitterness. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, a nice IPA. Glad to see it here in Colorado, will drink again when I see it on tap."

"Had this on Nitro Tap at City Beer in SF. This was my first ever IPA on Nitro. The Nitro made a great beer even better by smoothing out the hoppiness and providing the milky start that nitro lovers love. If you see it on Nitro tap, I highly recommend you pull the trigger."

"Overall, a stellar and balanced example of the style. The near-imperial level of alcohol doesn't even really make itself known with the rest of the bright and enticing flavor profiles leading the show. I could see this being a good hot summer day IPA, in spite of the strength. I'm looking forward to trying more from AleSmith."

"Perhaps a fresher beer would bring out the overwhelming grapefruit taste of San Diego IPAs, and many American IPAs. I would like to try a fresher bottle for comparison. Less grapefruit is probably a result of the Alesmith brewing style and not freshness."

"Poured out of a 22 and split with my Dad (he took a sip, declared it hoppy and watered it down with Coors Light, don't ask). My *undiluted* IPA poured a great gold color with a nice lace that rises above the liquid line slightly. The aroma was awesome: sweet, crisp and bitter cascade hops (those kinds that let you know immediately that you are dealing with California hops) hit the nose, couldn't ask for more in a fragrance. The taste was good too, sweet at first and bitter as it goes down. Leaves a nice bitter aftertaste, it isn't very balanced but the hops are so good I didn't mind much. The mouthfeel is good, very bubbly and overall this beer lived up to its high rating, try a bottle for yourself."

"O - Without a doubt AleSmith IPA is one of the greatest IPAs on the planet. It's explosive aroma transitions wonderfully into flavor without the insane bitterness one might expect from such a hop-forward beer. AleSmith IPa is truly a world-class beer to behold."
""
""
""
""
""
"BTW since the bottling date had apparently been worn off the bottle shoulder, I could not say how old this was."

"Pours a beautiful hazy, sunset orange color with a finger length off white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick lacing around the glass. Nice carbonation which tells me this will be a refreshing ipa. Smells of resinous fruits like grapefruit, tangerine, mango, and pineapple. Also get some pine and like a bubblegum smell from the sweet malts. Taste is very much like it smells. starts with the resinous fruits such as pineapple and tangerine. Then in the middle there is a great balance of malt: get bready flavors as well as a creamy carmel sweetness. Then the finish is an incredible blend of the sweet, carmely malts and the resinous hop qualities. Get a prominent bubblegum flavor, as well as hints of pineapple, pine, grapefruit, and lemon. The bitterness gets more astringent as it goes through the flavor profile; however, the sweet and bready malts also get more prominent on the finish, so there is a nice balance at the end. A nice dry, crisp, clean finish. Medium body with a creamy and crisp mouthfeel. Wish I could get this more often. Just an incredible IPA."

"This IPA is right on target. No characteristic beats the other, but rather meld in harmony. Tremendously tremendous. Truly a leader of a classic in style. Alesmith, if you are reading-would you please come to Chi-town. How come you distribute OVER Chicago to the East coast? Just wondering-I'd buy regularly."

"Pours a deep golden with a two-finger off-white head. Nice retention and lacing. Nice fruity aroma with sweet malt and grass. Strong hop flavors on the front of the tongue balanced by a strong malt backbone. Finishes dry with a lingering hoppy bitterness. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall an extremely well crafted and perfectly balanced west-coast IPA. Very quaffable!"
""
"O - Really nice busy, resinous, refreshing, sweet IPA!"
"Not my favorite SD IPA - but no idea why as I've heard great things about this one. Nevertheless, it is very easy to drink, and paired excellently with zesty buttered fish and pesto ravioli tonight. Just like Sculpin, I will make it my goal to find this as fresh as possible, and then give it another chance."
""
"Overall: Awesome take on the West Coast style. Not a hop bomb by any means, and this just adds to the drinkability. I wish I had more than just this bomber. Will gladly revisit."

"In the end, this is up there for me for IPAs. I have this near Maine Co. Lunch. It’s just an amazing IPA. It’s truly a complete beer with its tropical and pine hops, but then that strong malt. Be sure to have this cold, as this warmed up, it slowly lacked flavor and was a bit malty for me. Having it cold, I noticed more aroma and fruit, and just the complexity that this beer as to offer."

"Probably the best beer I've ever had, this one is as close as I've come to perfection in a beer. Starting with a great tropical fruits and pine hop aroma that matches the taste. The pine hops taste is amazing, coupled with the fact that the beer isn't overly bitter makes this truly outstanding."

"One tasty mother of a west-coast Yankee IPA, hoppy as all get-out, with damned-near every fruit native between the Gold Coast and the PACNW represented. This is not meant to omit the commendable 'balance' achieved here by the plucky malt, as without it, the drinkability would surely suffer. Highly worthy, and genuinely deserving of the hype, this one is."

"Orange color. Fairly clear. In the aroma, tropical fruits stand out, like mango and pineapple. Of course, grapefruit and citrus fruits are there. So is resiny pine. Body is medium, on the lower end for IPA's (about Pliny level) without being thin. The mouthfeel is quite creamy. Long dry finish. This is one of my favorite IPA's."

"This is one of my first beers from AleSmith, and I can't wait to drink more. The Speedway Stout is coming up next, and we also have a bottle of Decadence in the cellar. That beer, along with several others we have stored, will get better with time. We are in no rush to finish the 1001 bottles list, so we will let those sit for a couple of years. If you are a fan of this style, I highly recommend this beer. Just a well balanced, sans the initial shock of carbonation, IPA that leaves a long and delicious aftertaste. Keep it up, AleSmith!"

"Overall I was very impressed with the entire session. This IPA is very well done. The balance of the malt and hops is almost to perfection. A lot of IPA's are leaning on either side but the Alesmith crew schooled the competition in this style. Very refreshing and ABV is well done for enjoying more than one at a session. Bravo."
""
"Pours a cloudy apricot glazed amber with a quickly disappearing head..The aroma was extremely piney and had strong notes of wet freshly cut grass, grapefruit...starts with a nice balanced bitter grapefruit flavor, showing subtle piney notes but remaining quite balanced. I used to think this beer was more over the top, but its surprisingly balanced..maybe a tad bit too much...maybe....Alcohol is completely hidden though...and its not as sticky as some IPAs can be. A really good IPA, one of my favorites."

"Pours a clear shallow gold with minimal carbonation and a finger and a half of foam, pretty good retention. Smells of strong hops, thick citrus and pine with a nice sweet malt. Taste follows the nose well, nice hoppy profile balanced well with a pale citrus malt. Feel is a little light bodied with a nice crisp and bitter bite, good bitter finished. Overall this is balanced too well for my taste, I like my ipas a lot more on the hoppy side, from a balanced point of view it's great"
""
""
""
"Poured out of the bottle and it looks like beer. Its been filtered and looks like any normal beer but one things stands out. The head retention. The fact that it does not look like it is going away says that this is going to be a sticky beer with tons of hop oils in the flavor. Lacing galore all over my glass. Am I wrong? the smell is no different. I get tons of sweet hop juice. Citrus hits the nose strong and it appears there is this sweet malt character as well. Amazing for such a filtered beer to have such a sweet citrus like smell. I know it sounds weird but most of the filtered IPAs I have had are bitter instead of smelling fruit like. Now for the taste. Not as much citrus in the flavor as I thought but its there and there is a hint of bitterness but overall, this is one tasty easy to drink IPA. For a standard IPA, its pretty darn tasty. Nothing mind blowing but this has hops in the west coast tradition. Lost of the m but when it comes to bitterness, it takes a back seat when the malts come in to mellow it out. So for the flavor I would say I get that citrusy earthy flavors most IPAs are known by. I was more intrigued by the smell though. Nevertheless, the mouthfeel for this beer does it justice. Its full bodied. Sticky and carbonated just right. Overall this is a great IPA for people that are not looking for a bitter hop bomb but for one that is looking for some nuances. Well done. Easy to drink and worth the 6 bucks I paid. Is it the best ever? No but for a standard IPA there will be very few this good. Try this out."

"a really citrusy ipa. pours mostly clear copper color with a big tall delicate looking white lacey head that leaves trails after each sip. the nose is all grapefruit, bittersweet. the malt profile is rather unremarkable in both smell and taste, which is okay for me in this one, because it does what it has to while allowing a very unique and attention commanding hop bouquet to shine. again grapefruit is the main taste note, but there also something else acidic in here, maybe lemon, maybe pomelo. i really love the finish of this, which is as fruity as it is bitter, refreshing but dry, and with an alcohol content that cannot be tasted in the slightest. the feel is equally exuberant, with robust carbonation that tickles the tongue on every sip. body is medium to fuller, but the bubbles make it seem lighter than that, and a bomber of this is a joy to drink, wish i had two!"
"O: A fine IPA that I would definitely seek out again, reminiscent of Lake Placid UBU but far less of a potent feel"
""
"O - This one is great!! I think what make this beer so good is the fine line of not over-doing 'it' in any particular area (hops, fruity-flavor, pine/spice, carbonation, and last but not least, alcohol level). VERY refreshing and will get again and...…Goin’ to look for a tap ASAP!!!"

"Pours a clean, transparent light copper/orange with a 1 finger inch pillowy white head that thins to a tight lace around the glass, decent sticking and lacing. Smells of spicy citrus, mango, peach, a touch of earthy onion, and garlic also. BIg juicy hop flavors on the tongue, mangos peaches, orange juice, piny and earthy hops, slightly bitter on the finish. Meduim bodied, sugary sweet, citrus, finishes dry and bitter. Overall; i took a chance on this beer, and i was very impressed, this is a classic West Coast IPA. I just do not understand why there is no bottling date on an IPA that is being shipped across the country, lucky for me, it tastes pretty fresh."

"Had another bottle Nov 2012 from Bear World Watertown NY for 7.99 - Great carbonation and taste, lots of hops. This might be the first time I've had it reasonably fresh. However, the price and no dating still irks me. If this was available in 6 packs and had a bottle date, it might be unstoppable."
""
""

"O: Delicious, but don't buy looking for an overwhelming hop flavor. The hops in this one are buried, and discrete. The first impression isn't particularly strong, but the subtle notes and flavors sneak up on you just at the right moment of enjoyment."

So damn refreshing and easy to drink I'd love to sip this on a hot summer day here in Chicago but it definitely wouldn't hold out until next summer so this was a must have now and I'm glad I got to try this. Very well done!"
""
""
""
"O - Not as powerful in the aroma or taste departments as I remember it from a fresh bottle. Who knows, perhaps my senses have been despoiled by a year of (IPA) living dangerously. For example, Fat Head's Head Hunter is stronger (and better) in the taste and aroma departments. I enjoyed it this time around but wasn't blown away. You'll have this."

""
""
""
""
"O - A very nice example of a hoppy and bitter, yet well balanced IPA. I appreciate the malts that are going on here, though I tend to prefer a little less bitterness and a little more complexity to the hop aroma/flavors - so it doesn't quite reach the status of my all-time favorites. Definitely recommend and would get it again."

"O: Very enjoyable with wonderful hop aromas and flavors without a lot of bitterness. Easy to drink and the alcohol is well-hidden. Great beer that I could enjoy over and over again. Very well balanced between the malts and the hops."
"O: An excellent, well crafted ale. I'm a pretty big fan of ales, and this is up there as far as ales go."
"O- This is pretty darn good IPA, I was hoping to be blown away but it didn't quite take me there. I think its mostly to do with the age of my bottle, as it has has no date and the hops taste older. Will have again"
"O: Excellent. Like a cross between Sculpin IPA and Stone IPA, though maybe not quite as good as either of them. But close."
""
"Check it out. You will not be disappointed."
""
"Overall: quite a good beer, although it doesn't jump out and grab me like the reviews suggested it might. That said, it is highly drinkable for a big IPA like this, and is extremely well balanced. Perhaps overrated in my opinion, but still delicious and wonderfully drinkable."
"Overall (4.0): Thank god. It has been a long time since I’ve smelled a REALLY fresh hop bomb, and I’ve been missing it. It also looks and feels quite nice, but I found the flavor profile to be bit one-note. The malt is what it is, plain and dry, and the hops are mostly bitter and not as much flavor, which I was really looking for after the nose. It does what it does very well, but I was hoping for something more dynamic in the hop character. Still, very well-done."
" There's a little bit each of caramel and bready aromas, and those are met by a floral, sweet orange peel, citrus smell. The malt backbone is pretty much perfect. Again, some bready and some caramel notes. Enough of each to be appreciable, but both still subtle enough that they should, in theory,stay out of the way of the hops. The problem here is that the hops just don't quite deliver. There's a little bit of bitterness, but not the sharp bite I've come to look forward to from an IPA. Similarly, the orange-grapefruit citrusy close is nice, but not bold enough. The body, like the malt flavors, is spot on. There's a tiny bit of sturdiness, but it still definitely falls on the dry side of the spectrum. The carbonation could stand to have a little more life to it though. I've been holding off a while on trying Alesmith IPA due to the lack of bottle dating. I finally found some on draft, and I have to say, I'm a little bit underwhelmed."
""
"Overall: This is one of the best IPAs I've tasted to date. This IPA is a must try to anyone. Whether you're a seasoned, veteran beer connoissuer, or a beginning, new beer drinker. This selection won't be a considered a waste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - On cask, it is a very nice and solid IPA that can hold it's own to Pliney and others. (Like many of this style, I DO wish it were lower in alcohol though.)"
""
"Pours honey with an etched surface and soapy white rim. Notes of grapefruit, honey, biscuit, resin, peach and a bit of grass; relatively malt forward for a CA IPA. Flavor is sweet and honey like. Not particularly bitter, plenty of lemon and tangerine, but nothing particularly assertive. I think the malts are overpowering in this example, and the bitterness needs a bit of help queuing up. Medium bodied with nice, slightly hi and sharp carb and an off dry finish. Decent beer, and I'd suggest it to an IPA newcomer. I wouldn't suggest it to a tried hop-head. Too much malty sweetness is similar to the 90min IPA."
""
""

"O - A solid IPA with a few endearing imperfect edges."

"D: good, just not blown away. i wish this thing had a best before or bottled on date to give me a better idea of freshness. regardless, gotta go off of what i have in the glass and while this is certainly not a bad IPA, just not as great as what i would expect from a san diego brewery."
""
"Overall: Really great IPA that is super drinkable and one of the most balanced IPAs I've had in a while."
""
""
""
""
"O: Revisited this after three years and I am downgrading. My palate is much more refined after the plethora of brews I have consumed. Whole not bad, still not the staple IPA for me. However, it is one clean beer!"
"Overall. A very good ipa. I could, and would drink a ton of this if I could get it around here!"
""
""
"The Rest: A great IPA. Really good balance between the hop bitterness and the stout malt base."
""
"Overall, a good IPA. In my view, not the standout that its scores suggest. Without a freshness date, I guess it is possible that this bottle is a bit old and would be better fresher- though it tastes fine to me."

"O: Not as widely distributed as Racer 5 or Stone IPA. A great California IPA on par with the likes of Sculpin. It you're not from California and you happen to stumble upon this brew at your local shop don't hesitate to give it a try."
"Pours a clear, pale golden color with a soapy antique white head. The head is rather stubborn, which contributes to the sustained attractiveness of the beer. Sticky suds lace the glass as the beer is being drunk. The bouquet consists of pine, grass and lemon zest, with occasional notes of burning peat. It has a soft, wet mouthfeel that yields to a gentle carbonation scrub. A lot of pine flavor from start to finish. Less prominent grapefruit flavor, but the bitterness unique to grapefruit is present. It is well-balanced by the grain, and, thankfully, not overpowered by it. The pleasant mouthfeel rounds out the experience. Nothing to get terribly excited about, but a good IPA."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid IPA, but not one I'd make my go to."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how fresh and earthy everything was. The malts also showed an interesting variety in the nose, with a surprising darkness at times. The beer is ultimately very refreshing and nice to the style, but becomes a bit muddy through the flavoring and not as crisp due to the booziness at the end, which is otherwise well hidden."
"O - Taste and smell are good, but the mouthfeel felt off kind of took away from the quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with just enough carbonation to foam this up pleasantly on the palate, leading to a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Finish is expectedly dry."
""
"O: Another killer IPA out of SoCal, awesome stuff that I wish I had regular access to."
""

"Overall: Really enjoyed this IPA. It's more mellow than a Stone IPA or Ballast Point Sculpin, but you fellow hop heads take note that mellower does not mean poorer! The strong malt sweetness and the velvety-smooth carbonation, combined with the pleasantly bitter hop profile make for one hell of a balanced beer. I'll be coming back to this time and time again, I can tell already. Quite possibly my favorite single IPA so far"

"Overall: Just a great IPA. Fruity hops, well balanced bitterness"

"Overall (4.5/5): AleSmith IPA is a solid, stellar example of a West Coast-style American India Pale Ale. It has what I look for in my favorite style of beer: high levels of grapefruit-like bitterness that resolves in a long and satisfyingly dry finish. Not too complex, just concentrates on delivering lots of hop flavor to satisfy my inner hop head. There is no noticeable alcohol presence and drinkability is high. This beer isn't necessarily what I would call ""accessible", but for any craft beer drinker that's adventurous, doesn't mind high levels of bitterness, and is looking for a legitimately great example of the American IPA style I recommend this beer to them. A benchmark of the West Coast style IPA along with Green Flash WC IPA, Firestone Union Jack, Ballast Pt. Sculpin, and Port Wipeout (oh, and Stone IPA, too). It's in great company. Seek it out!"
""

""

"O: Great example of a west coast/California IPA. Bottle conditioning gives it extra appeal."
""
""
"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly cloudy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice thick cap that lasts. Some good spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge orange, grapefruit, floral, herbal, pine, pineapple, citrus rind, earth, grass, caramel, bread, and other light tropical fruitiness. Fantastic well balanced aromas here with good strength and complexity. Taste of big grapefruit, herbal, orange peel, pine, lemon, grass, earth, floral, citrus rind, pineapple, caramel, bread, and slight pine resin spiciness. Good sized bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, grass, herbal, pine, floral, caramel, bread and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance of bitterness and sweetness; with tons of hop flavor complexity. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly sticky and crisp mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is excellent masked, with hardly any warming noticed at all after the finish. Extremely smooth and easy to drink. Overall this is an incredible IPA as expected. Fantastic hop flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. I wish this was more easily available back in Ohio."
""
"O: This beer is a winner for me, no doubt.  It has a great hop profile and an impressive bitterness.  There are some great IPAs out there, and this is one of them.  Up there with my favorites, although the title still belongs to Sculpin in my book.  Definitely worth seeking this one out."
"O: A very good IPA that anchors the West Coast style in many ways."
""
"Update (5/11/13): Drinking a fresh bottle of this thanks to the fact that Alesmith apparently now distributes to Rhode Island. This is actually my third bottle of this overall, and my suspicions are confirmed: this is one of my top 5 favorite IPAs of all time. Oh snap! Bumped up the score slightly to reflect my growing love."
"A delicious dry piney, skunky IPA. Great lacing, pine and resin. Medium bodied. Hops are aggressive and make your mouth water in anticipation of more. Light alcohol sweetness warms the throat. An overlooked IPA out here. Let the reviews tell you. This is a great one."
"Overall: very well balanced with a huge nose and aggressive pine/citrus hoppiness."
"O: Just an excellent west coast IPA, drinkability is really good for 7.25 abv and its very well hidden, also bottle conditioned which is good. Smells great tastes great. Very hard to find a flaw with this beer other than not having a bottling date which IMO is a big no no. Loved this and will revisit again at some point."
""
"Mouthfeel is very good- medium light body with mild carbonation and a little resin. Most times I prefer a little more bubbles but this is fine by me. An excellent example of the style. Too bad it doesn't come in a 6-pack."
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. The smell and taste were complex and refreshing. But I was disappointed that the taste was not as complex as the smell. It was missing the sweet fruit (peaches, mango) and orange that was present in the nose. This is a very good but not great west coast style IPA. This beer, along with Ballast Point’s Sculpin IPA (which is better in my opinion), have made me a fan of the style."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very nice IPA, I can't believe I've been in the game this long and have always overlooked this beer for some reason, well worth seeking out. Purchased a bomber a few days ago and it's left me with wanting to go back for more. Like I mentioned, the hop intensity is moderate, but a little faded, however, it's still very good. I will revisit my review when I come across a fresher bottle because I can tell this beer has some very good potential."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- hope I am right about the freshness because this is just an ok ipa to me. Hops seem faded."
""
""
"I'm glad this IPA has made it to PA. I'm not the hugest Alesmith fan as I thought their Yulesmith and Speedway were too sweet, but this beer is great. Kudos."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great IPA. Surprisingly balanced in the taste, especially when the nose would lead you to believe otherwise. When you strip it down it's really just a west coast style IPA done very, very well."
""
""
""
""
"A tasty ipa but taste like a lot like every other California ipa"
""
"Pours a clear golden orange. Has that familiar California hop taste. Nice bitterness to match the hop bite. Drinks really smooth and there is no hint of the alcohol content. Not sure when this was bottled, but it feels like the hops are just starting to fade. It's still good overall though."
"O: This is simply the best beer I have ever had and proof positive that San Diego, CA is the IPA capital of the world. Alesmith, Stone, Ballast Point, Green Flash, Alpine ...all in one county. Jesus."
""
""
"O: I liked it a lot. Another great beer from San Diego. Alesmith makes great beers - they should distribute wider."
""
""
""
"22 oz bomber purchased at the brewery pours a medium amber - mostly clear with a few suspended floaties. Fluffy white head with great lacing. Resinous piney hop aroma with surprisingly strong toffee malt promising well-balanced flavor. Great hop profile with pine, floral, and citrus all present in abundance and nice caramel malt backbone to balance things out. Wonderfully carbonated mouthfeel really intensifies the flavor and hangs on the tongue. A great West Coast style IPA!"
""
""
""
""
"O - incredibly balanced. ridiculously refreshing. a great IPA."
"Bright orange in color with a deep yellow hue. Started with a heavy chill haze but clarified as it warmed. Poured with a short white foam that reduced to a sticky, soapy cap. Amazingly fresh aroma: grapefruit, pungent pineapple, ripe orange, and solid sweet caramel malt beneath. Bread and biscuit aromas grew as the temperature warmed. Smooth feel with a lightly tangy and resinous feel as the carbonation rolls through. Flavors are very similar to aromas: fresh, but pungent, citrus hop flavors with a sweet caramel malt backbone. Again, bready, biscuity flavors intensified as things warmed up. A bit of pine hop flavor at the finish that lingered for a while."

""
""
"O: The nose takes this beer someplace the palette can't follow, however I'd still recommend it. Nice IPA."
""
"Pours a mostly clear golden amber, big frothy white head, good sticky lacing. Notes of fruity citrus juices and pine in the scent with a touch of floral notes, little detection of malt here. taste follows suit, big juicy and fruity citrus with touches of bitter pine resin, and nice light floral touch to smooth it out. Little presence of malt in the taste. Medium bodied, moderately high in carbonation, very dry on the palate. A fantastic, juicy IPA that leaves me thirsty for more."
""
"This is a great IPA! Wish I had more access to this beer!"
""
""
"O: Excellent IPA, not really anything I could complain about. The hop profile and malt balance were spot on for the ""west coast"" style, and it is right there in style and polish with the fresh Lagunitas and Stone IPA examples."
""
"pours a cloudy apricot glazed amber with a quickly disappearing head..The aroma was extremely piney and had strong notes of wet freshly cut grass, grapefruit...starts with a nice balanced bitter grapefruit flavor, showing subtle piney notes but remaining quite balanced. I used to think this beer was more over the top, but its surprisingly balanced..maybe a tad bit too much...maybe....Alcohol is completely hidden though...and its not as sticky as some IPAs can be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not expecting an earth-shattering beer here... but I was wrong. This is a top notch IPA, hitting perfectly on all cylinders. Great job, Alesmith!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very balanced, with a real classic IPA bitter. This is my kind of IPA. It values the more bitter, pine and grapefruit over the tropical fruit sweetness. Definitely a great beer!"
"Pours a slightly murky light orange with a tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight malt aromas. Taste is the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good IPA with nice citrusy aromas and flavors."
"Appearance- Pours a 1 finger head that is frothy with good retention. Has a deep copper colored body with a semi-hazy body. Leaves good lacing behind."
""
""
""
"O- A really delicious IPA, insanely drinkable, I just destroyed the entire bomber with total ease, none of the flavors are over the top but work very well together."
""
"O - even with the bitterness and burn from some alcohol this is still amazingly drinkable a truly world class beer."
""
""
"O - Overall, a very nice IPA from AleSmith. First time I've seen this in MA and glad I recognized it as a 4+ IPA. Would buy this again, so enjoyable."
""
"Overall: This beer is downright amazing once it warms up a bit. Loads of depth and a good balance to keep the tongue happy. A firm notch for Alesmith. Falls off pretty quickly, but fresh it's a force."
""
""
"Less malty than the aroma indicated (this bottle might have been a touch old)...reminded me of a less-tropical Sculpin IPA."
""
""
""
"O- a great ipa that is bet well rounded, everything works very well together here, a great beer from a great brewery, It's Pretty Awesome."
"O: The hop profile is a little harsh. Too oily and resiny, not enough of those pleasing citrus flavors are allowed to come through. It didn't do it for me, personally."
"Overall: Hopefully, we'll see more AleSmith IPA here in Philly. Huge citrus notes with just enough balance to make this one a great IPA."
""
""
""
"D- Not a session ale at 7.25% but i could drink 2-3 of these if I had them available. This is very drinkable even though i'm not blown away by the taste. A good American IPA that I prefer out of a fresh bottle."
""
""
"O-a solid IPA, but several I prefer over this one and at a lesser cost as well"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - very nice ipa all around with a modest abv% makes this one a perfect GO TO.. if only it were actually distributed here :("
""
""
""
"o: decent beer, but lacking some of the sweet counter-point to the hop profile."
""
"O: Have to admit I was underwhelmed with this and a bit disappointed stylistically. It's clearly a well crafted beer, but too one dimensionally hoppy and dry for my taste. I prefer Stone or Green Flash for a San Diego IPA fix."
"O - A prototypical west coast ipa. Good if that is what you are into. I still have a regional bias to the midwest ipa's. Sorry left coast. I can think of three Michigan and three Ohio ipa's I like better. Plus I can get them fresher."
""
"Clear amber with a large lasting amber head. Aromas of carmel, pine, a bit of earthiness and some faint citrus notes. Palate was medium bodied and smooth. Flavors of sweet carmel, earthiness and pine with a lingering moderatly bitter finish. A very drinkable and well balanced IPA"
""
""
""

"O - An amazingly tasty, well balanced IPA. This goes up in my top 5. So damn drinkable and the ABV is completely hidden"

"HV"

"Cost: $5.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle"
""
""
"Good, well-balanced IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but a bit disappointing considering the look and smell. I thought about going higher on the sight, which may have led me to give it an overall rating of a 3.5."
"D - A formidable American IPA that deserves it's spot at the table with the other big boys in the category... Not my personal favorite, but there are many exceptional characteristics of this Alesmith offering..."
""
"The balance throughout the drink is something that really shines in a good brewery and a good beer. While the flavor didn't really blow me away I still came up impressed by this brew. Alesmith knows what they are doing, a good value."
"I have always walked past this. I can't believe what I've been missing. Out of bottle into tulip, fat bubbles, lots of fluffly white head. Nose is filled with fresh hops, if I am not mistaken, amarillo hops. Earthyness, and slight citrus. Tastes of fresh amarillo hops, sweet, grapefruit, and grass. Mouthfeel, light and bubbly. Full flavor and refreshing. Overall. . . Holy crap. This beats pliny IMO. Especially for the price. I will definitely be picking this up on a regular basis."
""
""
"Overall: So impressed with this beer. Delicious. Definitely will be buying some more of this."
""
""
""
""
"Transparent golden amber color and about a half a finger head. Large bubbles float to the top. I smell piney and citrus hops. I also pick up the sweetness from the malt. The piney bitterness seems to be well-balanced with the malt backbone. The bitterness lingers after the sip. I can appreciate that though. Mouthfeel is rather light and effervescent. A great extra, I'm glad that I got to try it. I beginning to pick up a difference between midwest IPAs and West Coast IPAs. It's all good!"

"Very nice, crisp IPA. A bit of a floral flavor. Nice mild bitterness. There's a sweet caramel taste in there. Kind of a rye aftertaste."
"Really great IPA and well worth every dime paid!!!"
"One finger off-white head, a bit broken, mostly small bubbles, medium dissipation with above average lacing over clear orange amber body, multiple streams of rising carbonation. Nice nose, citrus grapefruit along with apricot notes, caramel malts. Taste mirrors the nose, a little bit on the sweet side but firmly in the SD IPA category, firm malt backbone leading to mildly bitter pine resin finish. Mouthfeel is medium, very good effervescence, well rounded finish. While to each their own, if I had my choice between Scuplin, West Coast and Mongo, I'll take this every-time. My favorite Cali IPA, absolutely delicious."
""
"Skål!"
"Overall: Easy to drink and not too high on the alcohol content (7.5%). A very good example of what a true IPA should taste like."
""
"It's Pretty Awesome"
""
"Poured a perfectly clear golden orange with a tight white head, some sticky lace and light retention. Nose has bright citrusy notes, tangerine, clementine and is overtly floral. Light sweet caramel and crackery base. Taste is all about the hops, bitter from start to finish. More tangerine, pine and big, juicy fruit notes. Some mango and similar tropical notes, cut by the bitterness - still with the light crackery base. Only a little bit of sweetness. Pretty light body, with a clean and crisp finish. Dangerously drinkable, with only a suggestion of alcohol on the palate. The smell and flavour on this had me pulling this to my mouth more often than I should have for the bomber. Great hop profile, and an exceptional IPA overall."
"This is an unbelievable beer. The epitome of what an IPA should be, pure hoppiness with very little malt interference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is bordering on too acidic for me. I might enjoy this one a few beers into the evening, but with a fresh palate it's too harsh. It's too aggressive on the tongue, lashing you for not bowing to it's hoppy glory. I love hoppy IPAs, but this is just a bit too far. It's very harsh, which isn't a bad thing, it's just not my thing. Color and aroma are very good, the flavor just lacks IMHO. Maybe their other beers have raised the bar too much for me though."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is probably the best IPA I have ever had. The hop complexities and maltiness combine for a very well-balanced brew despite finishing with a pleasant lingering bitterness. The smell and flavor profile are amazing. With a taste this good and an abv of only 7.25 make this an incredibly drinkable beer."
"If this were available here I would buy it on a regular basis."
""
""
""
"Medium body, nice carbonation, lingering and dry on the tongue. Well balanced IPA with explosive hop flavor and tempered alcohol. I'd drink this all the time if it was easier to find around here, or if we got it on tap."
""
""
""
""
"DOA"
""
""
""
""
""
"The Alesmith IPA pours a pretty coppery amber color with a frothy white head that stuck around. Nose is full of apricot, some pine and an earthy essence. Don't get much citrus here. Malts come through on the mid palate, and then the beer finishes with lingering dryness. Very long finish on this one. Not as aggressive as some of its San Diego IPA cousins, this medium to lighter bodied beer (given its size) lacks that big citrus hop explosion I have come to anticipate from West Coast IPAs. Good, but there are others I prefer."

"overall my favorite Regular IPA of all time."

"Drinkability: High. This is a very sessionable beer."
""

"Excellent beer all round."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a clear golden color with a large frothy head. Lacing is in rings. Aroma is top notch, full of fruity tropical notes and bright juicy hop whiffs. Taste is also really tropical and hoppy. Bitterness is there but in a good amount. So nicely balanced. Lightly sweet. Not malty at all, only bright fruity hoppy flavors! Feel is slick and moderate. Super drinkable."

"An excellent beer that was smooth and highly drinkable, a definite session beer for me and a high recommendation. I’m glad I was able to try this, this was quite tasty and not a sensory overload or so hoppy that it was obnoxious. A real nice West Coast IPA, this reminds me a lot of the Cigar City Jai Alai IPA, and it was equally as enjoyable."
"O - Overall this is a beautiful IPA that exhibits everything that an American IPA should be - hoppy, malty, easy to drink, but not overwhelming or pretentious. Pretentiousness has its place in beer, but it is a welcome escape to drink a beer like this one. This is a beer that belongs in six packs -- people should be drinking this on a regular basis. I don't think is the special occasion beer that the bomber format often suggests, and that is exactly why I love it."

"0 - A pretty good brew! Very thankful for the box that brought it!"
"Thumbs up. Easily recommended."
"A nice cali local thanks xraided81. Rapid pour into a snifter yields no head but a decent light amber color. Smells like a pale ale with cascade hops and bread. Taste follows with some peppery cracker malts, beautiful medium hop bitterness, a tad bit of sourness and a faint smokes meat presence. Finishing very clean with some citrus in the after taste. Mouthfeel is great light weight crisp and clean. Overall a good solid IPA but overrated."
"Overall, a very good IPA. Bright hops are the star of the show, but not overwhelming. I'd gladly have this again."
"O: A good IPA. Not great at all but solid. Would buy again...if I could in my area."
"Balance is the name of the game on the flavor. Still it leans toward the hoppy side. Pine is more evident here, some earthy. Fruity zests are still on call. Malt makes a presence and sticks around allowing some sweetness in to play. Hops fade a bit from the aroma, but it's a nice beer nonetheless and not an over the top type hop bomb"
"OVERALL: This is a rich and complex West Coast IPA. Some may argue with that statement given the taste, the traditional big, bitter, West Coast IPA flavor, but when you begin to look at the beer as a whole, with all of the elements involved, it is apparent that this is yet another well-crafted, interesting and complex beer from AleSmith."
"Cheers!!"
"O - A very solid IPA, but nothing really stands out to me."
"Overall: Definitely one of the better IPAs I've had and held up to some of the other bigger IPAs at our tasting."
"Pours a clear dark gold with very nice two finger white head. Smells of mostly piney hops with a sweet malt backbone. Tastes of a supercharge full of hops. Again with the pine, but with some peppery spice, a little citrus as well. Has a delicate floral taste that resonates theoughout. Tastes bitter but not over the top. A great even-keeled, refreshing IPA. This matches my favorite of all time. Sets the standard for an IPA. Go get some!"
"O: Tasty and balanced is the best way to describe this beer. I do feel the malt regulates. This beer has been popular at my store and I now see why. I usually prefer bold hops, but for a regular ipa , this has good presence. I defiantly recommend and wish I got a second bottle."
"Great west coast IPA."
"O: I remember it more fondly at the brewery, but still a well done beer"
"Notes: Glad to try it, won't seek it out again. Lost Overall points for no production dating! Going to stick with the dark monsters that these guys brew so well."
"Alesmith is new to WI so it was time to revisit this beer. Bottled 10/22/13 so less than a month old. My major complaints about my previous experience with this beer have been addressed. Looks good and lively and the texture feels is excellent. I would give it solid 4s for every category."
"O: Solid IPA, not world class in my opinion but good and drinkable none the less."
"Pours a golden orange color with a paper thin head yet remains highly carbonated. Aroma of biting citric hops and a mild malt attempt to balance. Not as powerful as some ipas but easy drinking and very tasty. Mouthfeel o's smooth and keeps you coming back for more!"
"Overall this was not stellar in my opinion. Maybe I just don't like regular IPAs anymore, especially onesnthis bitter. I'm guessing they. Used Chinook in this beer which is a hop I detest because of it's high cat pee centric flavors. I will not be revisiting this one anytime soon."
"this is the second time ive had this beer and i feel fair to review it this time, this beer poured slowly was quite the foamy head gusher, lots of head with even the slowest pour, when i got the glass filled it had about a 2in frothy head. the beer itself is a solid cloudy dark amberish orange, it looks good. now on to my favorite part of this beer, the nose on this is all citrus and fruity. i get some grapefruit some pineapple some orange and some hop juice, not grassy. the flavors were kinda toned down from the nose but still tasty. the mouthfeel is very solid and a little heavier than some may expect. the carbonation isnt as jumpy as i was expecting, i guess it lost some of the zest in the beginning. overall this is a very good beer and i hear its pretty cheap in cali, you guys are so lucky, drinkability is very high, i could drink this all day and like i do stone. get some alesmith ipa its worth it."
"Overall, a good brew and worth a try. Not in the same league as the Alpine Nelson I had last night. Still, tasty and enjoyable."
"Overall a bit of a surprising ipa, good but takes some time to get use to."
"O: a very solid offering from AleSmith. First IPA from them. I want to try another that might be a little fresher."
"Had on vacation in SD. Pours a cloudy amber/orange with a very tall white head that lasts, lasts, lasts, and lasts. Great smelling IPA here. It’s heavy on the pineapple with dry pine resin, a bit of malts. It’s exotic and spicy all around. Okay, here I am being critical, I could use some more hops, but jeez, it is hoppy indeed. Finish is dry with just a hint of juiciness resonating from a grilled pineapple flavor. It’s insanely drinkable. An appealing level of sticky pine is found throughout. This is a damn good beer!"
"This is an exceptionally well-balanced and drinkable west coast IPA. This is not as extreme as some but I really like the flavor and aroma that is packed into this beer. A good balance (despite that fact that you don't necessarily taste the malt), and great bitterness."
"every HOP HEAD and IPA drinker needs to try this one! Excellent."
"Overall I have loved this for years. Ale Smith does not bottle date so I have no idea how old this bottle is. I do know it has been on the shelf at the local bottle shop for at least 2 months. With that being said I loved this. It is a must grab!!"
"Overall: This is one of the most impressive beers I have had in a while!! The fact that this beer is not as hard to get as a beer like Pliny the elder makes me very happy. This is my new go-to IPA!! 10/10."
"poured a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass. The aroma was not overwheliming, faint citrus and a hint of pine I picked up. The color was a nice golden-orange, typical of this style. It's plenty bitter, with the lead taste of sweet caramel malt. The carbonation seems decent and teh small tan head stays around a while. I'd like to know if my bottle was fresh consider some of the ratings on this, as my rating would be a solid IPA, but nothing spectacular."
"Just for IPA day and it pours a hazy golden yellow with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a frothy two finger head that stays and leaves heaps of clingy lacing,the smell is grapefruit,piney resin coated hops,boiled candy and passionfruit,the mouthfeel is sticky and medium bodied with tastes of lychee,citrus zest,piney hops,grapefruit,light tastes of candy and finished with a mouthpuckering grapefruit bitterness and overall i like it it really is true AIPA and very drinkable cheers to IPA day."
"O: Overall, this is everything I wanted from this IPA after trying out their extra pale ale. It's basically a more hoppy, flavorful version of that brew, focusing mainly on the grapefruit and citrus notes. I have been on a bit of a grapefruit hop binge lately and this one totally satisfied. Alesmith continues to impress and I look forward to trying out their other brews. Cheers!"
"O-Average IPA in my opinion, lacking that certain umph...would drink again if offered but would rather grab a pliny for the price..."
"O: Very good showing, certainly backs up their awards and its reputation. I can see myself stocking the fridge with this on a regular basis."
"O What a great IPA! Very well balanced. Highly recommended."
"o - kind of one dimensional. good value. i wouldn't turn this down if offered but with all the amazing ipas out there i guess i just don't get why this is so highly regarded. i guess the masses do really just like a hop bomb? worth a try to get that wonderful ipa smell though. classic smell."
"Very drinkable"
"Overall better than the last alesmith I had, it is nice and hoppy like any san diego beer. But the malty syrupy taste gives it something a little bit off, and not a good off like a double ipa."
"This beer poured out as a clean looking yellow color, the head was pretty good here and left behind a strong lacing. The smell of the beer was hoppy with some tropical fruit aromas and a little pine. The malts are also on the nose a little bit. The taste of the beer was pretty good, I enjoyed the pine and citrus flavors that the hops had in there. I feel that the mouthfeel was pretty good, a little on the light side. Overall this ipa was rather refreshing and it maintained a good flavor and aroma the whole time. This beer was a good one to try, glad I did."
"I picked up a 22 oz bomber at the City Beer Store in San Francisco. I have heard great things about AleSmith so I was very excited to try the IPA. My first thought was this might be a weaker IPA than I typically enjoy because of the soft/clear color and lack of a big nose. The taste was enjoyable, but I didn't pick up any distinctive characteristics. It’s a well-made beer and enjoyable to drink, but it doesn’t compare to other IPA in terms of overall hoppy satisfaction. It actually seemed to have more in common with a good pale ale than an IPA. I would love to try it again off a tap and see how it compares to my first experience."
"Pours a clear, light amber with a one finger beige head. Moderate carbonation. God-like lacing. Big grapefruit aroma with sweet caramel, toffee, flowers, pineapple juice. Taste is very well balanced. Up front lots of pineapple juice and bubbles followed by fresh grapefruit juice, citrus hops, and some sweet caramel malt. Spicy, dry finish. Best IPA in the world? Pretty close but I might take Sierra Nevada Harvest over this one. But damn this is good."
"This is one well-crafted IPA, one that I'd come back to often if it was distributed locally."
"Alesmith IPA is an offering bitter - yet pleasant - enough to redefine your impression of how a beer aught to taste. If you were in the market for a sports car, you wouldn't concern yourself with fuel efficiency; if you're looking for a characterful, full-flavoured IPA be prepared to accept all the bitter, brimming characteristics that come with the territory."
"O- Solid refreshing IPA, all the great characteristics that are involved in a quality IPA are present, would definitely drink again."
"I have been on an IPA kick. Pours a beautiful dark gold, head is tight but leaves soon after the pour. Scent is huge on flowers. Really flowers! Anyway, tastes more of citrus than of pine which may be why i like it so much. Candied grapefruit, lemons and oranges, mint at the end? Mouthfeel is a well-rounded bitterness and dryness. Overall, a new favorite."
"Poured from 22oz bomber into Duvel Tulip... excellent clarity with visible yeasty layer on the bottom of the bottle. Decanted to serve. Aroma is mildly pine and citrus. Taste is very balanced and sweet... almost like sweet mango. Hops are very well used in this brew and blended well. The malts are also well used. Carbonation is outstanding and mouthfeel is superb, brought to you in part by thr honest bottle conditioning. I really like the yeast strain they used in this one. Overall this is a solid contender and excellent for a (1x?) IPA."
"Drinkability: Eases over time, a bit too bitter at first. Also, not terribly refreshing. Not my choice for a summer afternoon."
"Too bad for this beer so many great, I say again GREAT, IPA made in this country now, or this would be the best IPA ever. As it is the list is right, at least ten even more excellent. A must try for lovers of this style!"
"O- reminds me a lot of Sculpin. Freshness dates would be great, as I think this one might not be as fresh as can pop up into stores...but it's damn solid regardless"
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: The beer is very easy to drink because the taste is well balanced and the bitterness is not overpowering."
"D-Superbly drinkable and a very well made, and approachable, yet flavorful . Now I just need to move to Cali so I can make this a daily drinker without going broke!"
"O: This is a very nice IPA that is crisp and a very good representation of the style."
"Overall, this is an amazing IPA. A 4.0 because each area is lacking something to take it to the next level. Thanks Mom for bringing this back from San Diego for me =)"
"O: Solid IPA, probably top 10 for me but nothing really stands out as super amazing. Just solid all the way around."
"Pours a hazy yellow orange. A bit of white head that doesn't disappear. Decent lacing on the glass. Smells pretty solid. light citrus, pine, lots of nice hops. A very solid nose that comes across equally nice on the tongue. Light sweet malts on the background. Overall a fairly thick mouthfeel. Very solid overall. Thanks!!"
"a nice culmination of fruit and zest. this was a light golden pour with a distinctly unique nose that i had never really found in an IPA. very much of its own character. nose of mint, pine interlacing. passionfruit. palate was citrus complex with with a bright and airy finish. lychee, white pear, grapefruit, guava and mango notes. the finish was sweetness clearing but not as effervescent as the nose. the sweetness did linger like a caramel a bit. pineapple rind and bark bitter. great IPA on the fruity side of something like the east coast vermont IPA's. great for early spring."
"Overall - This is just magnificent. Seek this out. And to those of you who have access to this, send me more!"
"Tropical fruit flavors abound - mango, guava and of course grapefruit. Malts are mildly caramel, but mostly grainy and light...just like I like it. Mellow, bitterness takes a backseat to hop flavor. Similar to Sculpin, but not quite as tasty. Biscuity and crisp. Damn fine IPA, thanks Brian for your generosity!"
"Crisp, dry, and deeply bittering, it's a top notch IPA."
"O - Right up there with the best in the style."
"Overall another great west coast ipa."
"D/O: This is an excellent West Coast IPA, as long as it is encountered when fresh. Not only does this beer present focused hop aromatics, it presents them in fine balance with fairly delicate toasted malt that is happy to play a supporting role. Acidity provides brightness, but is felt too intensely at times. Still, under the best of circumstances, this may be the best of the San Diego IPAs that boast year-round availablility."
"Very, very drinkable and hard to fault, although personally I'd prefer a little more tropical hops and a stronger malt presence - admittedly the latter probably make me a heretic."
"cheers"
"Delicious. If A+ means this is the perfect example of what I want in an American IPA, then that's what I'll give it. The description on the back didn't lie. It's pretty awesome."
"Thank you John for this unexpected surprise!"
"O - Incredible beer. One of my all time favorite IPAs. I will definitely be buying another."
"O-> I really enjoyed this beer. It was such an enjoyable, extremely refreshing surprise on the first few pours that were cold. And as it warmed a very subdued spiciness became ever so slightly apparent and that only served to further complement the fruit to pine transition in the middle. This beer really was exceptional and a welcome reprieve (even for this hop head and IPA enthusiast) from some of the harsher hop bombs I have been swigging recently. I will be picking up another bottle or two while these are still around, seeing as I paid less than $7 for this one..."
"Overall/Drinkability-Great, just great; perfect IPA, and one I wish I had regular access to."
"A mostly orangish beer, and rather translucent. Puffy tight white head. Sheets of lacing, yup it has that. The main components of the aroma are citrus and grapefruit, with some pine. The aroma could be more poppy, it lacks slightly. The flavor is very hop forward. Citrusy and fruity, pithy, bitter and clean. The hops are not cloying or otherwise. Some pine flavor is produced and the malt is clean and simple allowing the hops to be the showcase. Nice clean mouthfeel. Slightly bubbly with a scrubing sensation. A good ipa, not my favorite but a real winner."
"Not a super strong IPA, but solid flavor and good mouthfeel. It's drinkability is easy and this IPA could be consumed on a regular basis. Thought I'd enjoy it more, but again, it could be a bit less than fresh."
"Overall: This is a classic IPA and one of my favorite local ipa's from good old Cali. Cali will always be king of the IPA and my eyes. I used to think the midwest put out great IPA's but aside from my favorite brewery -Three Floyds I think Cali has it all over everywhere else in the US in spades when it comes to ipa's. When its hot out this beer goes down like water. Perfect balance to it. When you get this beer fresh its awesome!"
"O: After a beautiful pour and exciting nose, the taste was a bit of a let down. It might just be that this is getting a little old, thus the hop punch dying down, but it would surprise me a little (the store I got this from got this shipment in the day before I bought it and that was less than a week ago). More hop intensity would make this something special. Yet again, it seems like I'll have to get this at the source to get it at it's best."
"Overall, this beer did not live up to the hype for me. The alcohol and the bitterness are kind of abrasive. For a 7% beer, I did not think the alcohol would be so pronounced. Too much sweetness from the malts for my tastes. There is a combination of sweet, soapy, and alcoholic that is not doing it for me."
"O-- Solid and more solid. IPA's make me miss the beer scene in the US most. A beer you can have 2 of and seriously enjoy it."
"I am convinced the guys at AleSmith are perfectionist. Real technicians. They are not trying any gimmicks that is for sure. Just perfection. This brew is so well crafted and the drinkability is just amazing. Very hoppy but not harsh to the palate in any way. Quite enjoyable really."
"Drink: I'd like to try it on tap, but not my favorite IPA. I bet if it were doubled it up it would probably make a real nice DIPA."
"A delicious and nearly perfect IPA. Not a single thing to complain about."
"O - A great west coast IPA that may become a mainstay in my fridge. Good hopping without being overly sweet and a lovely, lingering finish. I'm happy that I live just a few minutes from the brewery."
"Above average IPA, and satisfying, but there's a lot more IPAs that I would choose over this."
"Golden, but with a slight amber hue. Below average head retention but lots of lace. Slight haze. Earthy-citrus aroma. Flavor is similar, with very bitter middle to finish. Some alcohol is noticeable in the middle. Medium to heavy body. Tasted alongside the X. The IPA is richer, more bitter, and was a bit softer on the carbonation. It laced some of the complexity of the X. Both are very good, however."
"A very very good beer."
"O- Another great offering from Alesmith and one of my favorite IPA's. Great juicy hop profile with a slight malt sweetness in the background. If you're into big hoppy IPA's that aren't terribly bitter, this is one of the best."
"Absolutely great."
"o - pretty nice. i dont buy it too often and i think thats just cause it doesnt really wow me all the much. maybe im just spoiled ;)"
"This is a great IPA, and should have wide appeal as well. The bitterness is well balanced with sweet flavors."
"A very hyped up beer and rightfully so.This one was a dousy."
"Overall, this is a very unique flavor for an IPA. It's very sweet with good bitterness but it's not overly malty. It seems like the sweetness is from the hop flavors. Overall good IPA."
"Recommended."
"O: I wonder if this one might be a little past its prime. I'm not getting nearly the citrus aroma or fresh hops flavor that I recall the first time I had this beer. The malt definitely comes through a lot in the flavor, and the hops are more subdued. It's still a good IPA, but I remember it being great, and this one didn't quite rise to that level."
"Overall: This is great stuff. I love the flavor and feel like I could session this during a hot summer day. I wish this was readily available to me! 6 Packs would be cool too as I hate the bomber format especially for IPAs but beggars can't be choosers."
"D - Very easy to drink. This is one of my favorite IPAs, and I have to say I was a little disappointed. Less flavor than previous experiences."
"This is a tremendous IPA; not overpowering but extremely satisfying!"
"O: Again, I thought this may be just a touch past it's prime, but all in all still a very fine ipa. Would really like to get a crack at this fresh. Skal."
"D/O- Oh man, could drink this for days. Doesn't drink its 7.25% at all. Reminded me a lot of Sculpin. First AleSmith offering...come to the Midwest."
"D - Drinkability is high. For an American IPA I'd say this is easily near the top of my rankings, if not for any IPA. Easily rivals the other, better-known competitors and I think this is a dark horse. If I could get this easily, I don't think I'd regularly drink another IPA."
"Picked this one up while I was out in Cali for the Bruery Reserve Society party. Big thanks goes out to womencantsail for shipping this to me after I left. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a one and a half finger bone white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, grapefruit, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, grapefruit, citrus, and grapefruit hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a truly excellent brew. The flavor and aroma on this one were nothing short of excellent. My only gripe was that the carbonation might have been a little too high as it actually burned on my tongue slightly. Really glad I got a chance to pick this up while out in Cali. An absolute must try!"
"D: Such a drinkable, delicious IPA"
"I normally fall in love with the tropical IPAs, but i can't deny that this is a great ipa that defines the Pine centric side of the spectrum."
"Subtle and understated - almost too understated. Pours a hazy golden with a slight head. The aroma is lovely and clean, with a strong lemon, like a great lemony cleanser. The flavor is clean, smooth, malty and deeply lemony, with a woody bitterness and a crisp lemon bitterness on the finish. There is a little carmelly malt in there, but the story is largely lemon. The mouthfeel is very slick with a tingly bitterness on the front of the mouth, which is unusual. The high abv is very well balanced."
"Ridiculously drinkable. Great balance of hops and malt is making this go down fast. Just a great, well-balanced IPA."
"Pours a hazy straw gold, a slight amber hue, with a quick head that leaves a ton of lacing. Aromas are of pale malt and earthy hops, not so inviting. Taste is a rush of hop bitterness, very grassy and earthy, fruit notes, dried apricot and pineapple. It has a nice mouth weight and an excellent drying finish. Overall pretty tasty, not your typical citrus bomb WCIPA."
"I would drink this beer again if I can find it. Not available in Indianapolis, I found it in Cincinnati last year I went to get this year and no luck."
"Just like the label, there are not any tricks to this one, just a big, bitter, hop forward beer, with excellent body and mouthfeel. Not a ton of balance, but in an IPA your not really after that are you?"
"D: No problem posting up on these all night. For as aggressive as the hop is in this brew, it's balanced so well that you can throw em back all night (and I have more then once)."
"Overall: A San Diego classic that I drink far too infrequently. This is a beautiful beer and a joy to drink. Now if only they'd date the bottles I might buy one from time to time."
"M/D: Medium bodied and very smooth. Has a slightly bitter finish. Drinks nicely, with the only drawback was the slightly muted flavor. Good but not amazing."
"Seek this out fresh (as I'm assuming this was) because it is delicious. Wish I could go back for several more."
"Final thought - There are some really nice IPA's that come out of SD, this is one of them"
"D- Good example of the style as it's quite drinkable and could find myself knocking back more than one even with that high ABV"
"Poured a crisp and clear slightly orangish yellow, looks very, very beautiful. Head is ample, finely foamy, and laces exquisitely. Aroma is a floral punch, with citrus notes of grapefruit and a twinge of mango. This guy was floral the moment I opened the bottle, and is really a treat to smell. Taste follows suit, but adds tons of pine, and a great bitter kick. Malt backbone is perfect - the hops never get out of control, and all the hop-associated flavors are allowed to come out smoothly with each sip. Mouthfeel is great, as the carbonation is there just enough to keep everything moving around, but not too much as to get in the way of any of the awesome flavors. Drinkability is also off the charts due to the balance from start to finish. At 6$ a bomber where I got this, this has to be one of the best deals I can think of."
"Drink- Having never had a Alesmith IPA, I am glad I have had the pleasure. A very drinkable IPA with some great flavors."
"D: This is incredibly drinkable for 7.25% ABV. If it was available locally, I'd buy fresh a couple more times. If it was available locally and in six packs, I'd buy it a lot more."
"Flavor wise the brew leans more towards the hops than Malts which is what I expect from a Ca. IPA, but there was some malts so it was not what I consider a hop bomb. It was a good IPA. I don't know what the hype was all about. I had a rather fresh bottle and shipped in the winter so I would think it was a good one. Don't get me wrong I would drink it again I went down great but it was a rather average IPA to me"
"Drinkability: Pretty much a hop bomb exploded on the taste buds. A bottle and I'm ready for a swing in the other direction. Certainly one of the more hoppier beers I've experienced."
"Its high alcohol content may catch you unawares if you're not careful, but it's hard to resist once you've tasted it. 7.25% ABV. Poured from 22oz bomber into dimpled glass - no date on bottle. Pourded a dark golden orange color. Smell consisted of sweet hops and malts accompanying hints of citrus and light pine and/or vanilla. Taste starts off with citrus flavors with a nice malty sweetness. Mouthability was smooth, medium bodied, and well-carbonated along with a nice head and laces that were left throughout. Other than taste, drinkability was the highlight of this beer as it consisted of a smooth nice malt characteristic for an American IPA. My experience with this beer has automatically made my top five IPA to date just sitting below 3F Dreadnaught."
"The CPJ"
"A deep orange color with a medium size head. Aroma is very hoppy, with a strong citrus and some pine as well Flavor as well had a very strong hop presence, mostly citrus and not as well balanced as I would have liked it to be. I'll give this beer another chance but it was not my favorite IPA."
"Appearance is a light golden color with a two finger head, it sits atop the beer for quite some time. Its smell is a citrus blast, along with hops, on the sweet side. Taking a swig of Alesmith IPA for the first time and wow, this beer is delicious. I taste grapefruit, bubble gum, hops, and pleasant bitterness. Nice carbonation and light-medium body. Drinkability is very easy on this IPA. I am really amazed by how close to perfectly balanced it is. At this point, I would put this somewhere in my top 5 IPAs."
"Overall: Two Hearted is still my favorite due to more 'flavor' (more floral, citrusy, slightly wetter, sweeter, less puckering aftertaste), but I would be very happy to discover Alesmith on tap at any bar where Two Hearted isn't (aren't we dreaming now ;)"
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a pint glass. The beer pours a deep copper color, with a light, filmy head. There are aromas of heavy hops, with very green/pine notes. The beer has a heavy hop-forward, front tongue flavor, which is extremely well balanced with sweet, citrus flavor. The beer is round and robust, yet crisp in mouth and with aftertaste. Sweet and robust on the aftertaste, with a crisp, light finish. This beer could be trouble, because it is so tasty, and so easy to drink. Fantastic beer!"
"Very surprised by this one; had it in the fridge for a bit, trying others before it. Was hard to get and now gotta figure out how to get more! Great stuff - get this beer!"
"D= The thin mouth makes me go for sips more often and the flavor doesn't linger long... Great flavor on this one no doubt. A tasty brew indeed. Worth seeking out and is on a totally different end of the spectrum from a bitter bomb so I would prolly buy this regularly if it were avalible to me."
"I don't give a Schlitz about this IPA. In fact, I think I'll go for a Schlitz right now."
"Overall- definitely amongst my favortite IPAs to date! MY top 3 would have to be Sculpin, THIS, and Pliny the Elder (I know it's technically a DIPA)... truly an amazing brew that you should search out if you haven't had one! Delicious and refreshing!"
"D: I don't think this bottle is the freshest, but it's still very drinkable. The hops could be fresher. Put bottle dates on the bottles dammit. I'm going to go ahead a slam the smell and taste categories with the number score, but I'll try another bottle at some point that is hopefully fresher. Sure wish they had bottle dates..."
"D - Great drinkability, I'm having no issues with this bomber. Surprised by the +7% ABV, I'm not detecting it at all."
"Medium syrupy body with just enough carbonation to help deliver the aroma while drinking it. Pretty drinkable, but the finish throws me off a little for this IPA."
"Pours a beautiful golden orangish color with just enough head which quickly dissipates. The smell has a faint citrusy scent, not overpowering but pleasant. There is a nice hops bitterness on first taste but the bitterness doesn't linger as there is the perfect balance of hop bitterness and malt sweetness. This is as balanced of an IPA as I've ever tasted while managing to be not boring. I could drink this beer all day long. It certainly does not taste like a 7.25% beer, it drinks like a much more sessioanble beer."
"D: I do find this enjoyable and easily drinkable. However, knowing to some degree how highly rated this beer is on the IPA list, I found it a little underwhleming/overhyped. Maybe I got a stale one. If so, I'll re-review when I try again."
"D: It drinks real easy. Nothing to complain about at all. Much better than Bud Light."
"Alesmith IPA is a very solid IPA from California that isn't available on the east coast afaik, but I managed to get some in a trade. My first comment was that this beer was a bit too sweet for an IPA and although it didn't make it undrinkable, but does take away from how I like this beer. It has a beautiful hazy orange color with just a light glazing of foam that easily dissipates. The aroma is strongly piney with a bit of fruity sweet note. The beer has great bitterness and hop qualities, that are resinous, pineapple, almost lychee like in it's tropical character. I really enjoyed this beer but just wish that it wasn't so sweet."
"I have a feeling this bottle may be a bit on the old side but I have absolutely no way of knowing since Alesmith doesn't provide a bottled on or best by date (or at least not one I could find). My first time with Alesmith IPA so I cannot compare to other bottles of this since it isn't available here. A good IPA, but would love to try a known fresh bottle someday."
"This is a massively flavorful beer, that is meant to be savored, but it doesn't make me want another after I'm done. It's very satisfying, a hell of a beer for the price."
"D-This is a very fine IPA, but not one I will likely buy often due to price and lack of availability. Unfortunately, it is similar to many other fine IPAs that are more affordable and available. This is to say, AleSmith IPA doesn't rise to the level of Russian River's Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder, which I do go out of the way for."
"Nice and crisp classic american IPA but lacks the in your face finish I love in Dreadnaught (my fav Amer IPA). Still a great beer at a fair price. I drink this one fairly often."
"Not a bad beer on tap, especially fresh in the brewery's warehouse, as this one is rather overpriced in the bomber. Pours a medium golden amber color, with a big, rocky white head. Big citrusy aromas going on (mandarin orange, tangerine grapefruit) as well as a little pine resin. This one is medium bodied, and nicely balanced between all those juicy hops and the sweet malt. Good."
"Smooth, creamy, medium to full bodied, with medium carbonation. This is such an easy beer to drink. This beer is definitely one I want to buy again."
"The most interesting aspect of this beer, besides the length of time that the lacing sticks around, is how the flavor changes as the beer warms up. It being a bomber and me being only one man, albeit thirsty, I took me a good 45 minutes to drink this down. The last 6-8oz at almost room temp came across as a completely different beer. All bitterness mellowed into the smooth caramel that I had smelled up front. Like a melting piece of butterscotch, I let this swish around in my mouth a lot long than my dinner guest would have liked. I have dubbed this beer ""Two-Face", for having two distinct personalities, but not one of them unattractive in any way. I have always admired AleSmith for Speedway Stout, and now they rank in my two favorite categories."
"pours a slightly hazy peach color with an orange glow with a smallish head and a very fresh collar..smell is pine and floral hops.grassy hops in the background..taste is big piney hops,with big floral and citrus hops..a little tropical taste in the back of the mouth is all balanced with some nice malts..mouth feel is all hops with a punch with medium carbonation..highly drinkable west coast style ipa..very good"
"a famous IPA that is very good if you can get it fresh."
"Very drinkable beer, one of my new favorite IPAs."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Zatec fluted glass. Got less than a finger of white foamy head. Bubbles persist, and there's excellent lacing. Color is orange/amber. Smells - pine up front, some citrus, a bit of Mr. Clean (but in a good way.) Some sweet caramely malt as well, but not overpowering. Very clean. Flavors are very piney and lemony. Again, reminiscent of Mr. Clean (though I've never had a sip of it.) Delicious clean finish, not much lingering bitterness. At 7.5 it's pretty bold for a single IPA, but only a gentle warmth lingers. Two 22ozs in one night would not be out of the question."
"This is a tasty IPA. The flavours are good and the malt well hidden to give centre stage to the hops."
"Overall this ranked as my second highest IPA of the night (below Jai Alai). I've always passed this by before, but I'll be picking it up again when I'm looking for an interesting IPA."
"Poured with a nice, large, cream colored, foamy, frothy head that lasts a while and lace. Color is a rich, medium amber with a few bubble trails. Aroma is big hop, pine, citrus, malt and a bit of old leather. Flavor is like nose and richer with just enough sweetness to balance the hops and carbonic acid. Body is very good and so is carbonation; both just right for this beer. Finish is like flavor, slowly tapering with good length and a little alcohol at the end. I would have rated it better but for its grapefruit characeteristics which I'm not all that fond of."
"Full but still light in the mouth. Man, West Coast IPA's are the f-ing bomb. Like all the ones ive had so far, unrealistically drinkable."
"D- For the alcohol content, this drinks rather nicely. Not really my favorite take on the style, but I can see why this is a hit. Was not as impressed as most reviewers. I believe there to be better styles out there"
"Drinkability: This is a well-balanced, full IPA with a great hop bill. I wish I had access to this more often."
"D - Refreshing, clean, easy drinking and delicious. This is a great example of a west-coast IPA. World class for sure."
"Pours a slightly hazy light amber color with a couple fingers of thick and creamy white head after a fairly rambunctious pour. Great hops presence in the nose. It's a mixture of faint pine with floral and fruity notes. There's citrus, but also a bit of mango. You can even smell some caramel malt. The malt is actually pretty abundant in the taste. I don't want to sound as if it's too much; it's just really well balanced. The hops were also pretty balanced. There's a pine, citrus, and floral note, but one doesn't really overpower the other. I really like that it had a hint of stickiness in the feel and carbonation was just right. No real alcohol presence. This is a really good IPA but may be a hair overpriced for what it is."
"D: A very well made, balanced IPA. And while I would classify this as a ""session"" beer, it is very approachable and fits well to style. Easy drinking for any IPA fan."
"Drinkability -- Wow. This was really f*cking good. Far exceeded my high expectations. The hop flavor is so deep and vibrant that one would be forgiven if they mistook this as a highly drinkable IIPA. Top-tier for certain, possibly my favorite American IPA to date."
"D- Without a doubt I would drink this again. It is a starter IPA. It has everything you like about an IPA, and very little of the distracting factors. I'd love to bring this to an 'introductory' craft beer night, but alas I don't have easy access to this beer. The alcohol doesn't detract, the flavors are enjoyable for the most part, and the aroma lacks. Overall, good not great."
"Drinkability - This one is very smooth, almost light. The 7.25 ABV is unnoticable. If you like your IPAs smooth and even (as opposed to hairy and over-the-top) give this one a shot if you can find it."
"Taste also reminds me of nelson a bit, but I think I liked nelson a bit more. Big notes of tropical fruit, citrus, grapefruit, pine, and floral notes. Tiny bready malt base is barely noticeable. Very good. One of my favorite ipas. Extremely drinkable. Prickly carbonation, with a nice medium body."
"Not my style, but from the citrus start to the lingering bitter finish, this one can please any IPA lover."
"Super bubbly head fades slowly, with large puffy lace chunks over the cloudy golden amber brew. Aroma is pine and grapefruit hops. Taste is moderately sweet maltiness upfront, with plenty of hops on the tail end, but nothing overpowering, which is cool. Mouthfeel is somewhat bubbly, but still smooth, and drinking is nice."
"d - this one is a home run. I can get this locally and would drink it anytime I can afford to pick up a bomber."
"As far as the drinkability is concerned with this beer...to steal an Alesmith phrase...Yeah, it's pretty awesome."
"I would definitely seek this beer out if I could buy it locally. I love it!!"
"Drinkabilty - Not bad, wish it had more fruit and malt taste to it. The hops and alcohol come through to much. This 22 oz is more then enough for me."
"(D)- A fantastic IPA that is just a joy to drink. Exactly what one should expect from the style. This would be a regular in my fridge if it were distributed here."
"NOTE AFTER SAMPLING FOR A BIT: Is this thing unfiltered? The foam never stopped throughout my entire session and the glass now looks like it went through a car wash on max setting. Maybe that's part of its charm."
"Pours a very yellow, hazy color with a slight orange tinge and a big eggshell colored head. Fantastic lacing down the glass. The aroma is very acidic with a grapefruit spike upfront and a rotten orange juice type aroma. The flavor is very Citric and bitter. The malt backbone isn't really there to support this style of hopping. Not bad, just not balanced. The mouthfeel is creamy and modestly carbonated. Really dry finish with fruity esters in the forefront. Drinkability is right up there with my favorite ipas. The flavor and intensity makes this stand out from many ipas."
"MF/D: very fine bubbles that do not underscore the taste."
"Overall, a very good and almost sessionable IPA. I wish I could get it around here."
"M & D - Nice crisp and refreshing. Straight foreword but well done. Very refreshing and drinkable. Good balance and good ABV makes this a very drinkable brew."
"D - A very good IPA but didn't meet my expectations. I would like to try this again as I wonder about the freshness of the bottle."
"D- For the alcohol content, this drinks rather nicely. Not really my favorite take on the style, but I can see why this is a hit."
"Overall this is a very good complex IPA that is worth trying."
"This one lives up to its expectations. It's a very well-rounded IPA."
"This huge IPA drinks almost too easily. It's got a great hop combination and the malts prevent it from being overbearingly bitter. This is a fine example of an American IPA."
"D- Very drinkable. An excellent summer beer and one of the best IPA's I've had. I still prefer Furious, maybe even Two Hearted just because of the price. A solid IPA though."
"Drinkability: Ranks up there with some of my favorite IPA's, and maybe my favorite west coast example. I picture drinking this way too often if it was around my part of the country."
"D- Ranks right up there with my favs from Alesmith."
"D= Extremely tasty and super drinkable. This is a great example of an American IPA and it certainly lives up to its hype."
"D- Great Drinkability, awesome West Coast IPA makes me happy to live in San Diego..."
"D- Wonderful IPA. Nothing over spectacular but just gets the job done! The 7.5% abv is hidden well. When I think of an IPA, this is what I think of. Thanks Scott yet again for hooking me up!"
"Pours a light orange, almost clear color with a BIG white head. Smells of piney, citrus hops. Some sweetness with a lot of bitterness. The taste is fairly well balanced with a nice sweet (almost honey-like). Lots of citrus (grapefruit, orange). The mouthfeel is maybe a bit syrupy for a normal IPA...not as crisp as I like them. Kinda has the consistency of a DIPA, but not really. Drinkability is mildly high."
"Clear, really fizzy, bright yellow pour with a nice thick head and great lacing. The nose is typical, big West Coast IPA with tons of citrus and subtle floral notes. The taste is also dominated by citrus with oranges and peaches at the forefront. Perfect balance with enough malty sweetness to complement the grassy hop bitterness. The mouthfeel suffers a bit for me because of the high carbonation. Nice crisp, dry finish. The great balance makes this beer incredibly drinkable. A great beer from one of my favorite breweries."
"One of the best IPAs I've had, and i will buy it if i see it, but unlikely since its not distributed here."
"Notes: Yet another amazing example of an IPA set by a San Diego brewery. Easily on my list of top IPA's - right up there with Sculpin, Big Swell, Blind Pig. The bottle-conditioning makes a huge difference here, giving this IPA a DIPA character, but with a lighter mouthfeel and lower ABV than its Imperial brethren. Living in San Diego I'll be looking forward to many more of these."
"A nice AIPA, but it's not the fifth best in the world...and 99 SEK (~$13) for a 22oz bottle here in sweden? Thats just rediculous"
"It's good. But for being in the top ten IPAs here, well, I guess I expected more in the aroma and more complexity in the hops. Maybe it suffers by comparison or from heightened expectations, but in all honesty and being 100% objective I've had at least a dozen IPAs I enjoyed more. Maybe it's not a super fresh bottle. Without the aid of a bottled on date I'll never know. I suspect the fact that it's something of an IPA+ or a DIPA- might skew things a little high. Meh. Whatever. I try not to think too much about arbitrarily generated letter grades and differing opinions on any given beer--that way lies madness."
"D- this is one fabulous ipa and worked perfectly with my rather spicy steak and melange of cheeses."
"Overall I was coming in to this with high expectation since this is in the top 10 list of IPA. What I would have liked for this beer to have was stronger aromatics of the hops and for the taste as well to be more citrus like. What I got was maybe an old bottle which I hope so because this IPA would not even make my top 20."
"22oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. No freshness dating evident on the bottle. Poured a translucent, golden-copper with a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a solid skim of a cap. Some sheets and strands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Great nose - sweet grapefruit and tropical fruit esters. Taste is a muted version of the nose with some malt character in the mix and a slightly piny/medicinal character that comes out at the back (I'm thinking this may be an older bottle). Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild carbonation and a slightly watery consistency. Not a bad IPA at all; however, I think this was a bottle that was past it's prime. That being said, I think it has held up remarkably well, despite the diminished hops character."
"d-a great ipa. It's Pretty Awesome. It's not pte, but i was very happy with it."
"D-7.25% and no alcohol burn. I could easily consider this a DIPA, but its a regular IPA. I love how much flavor they pack into this bad boy. Overall, an unbelievable brew."
"O: Quite expensive and hyped among my friends and by other reviewers. Quite dissapointed honestly, but wouldn't mind drinking again."
"A great American IPA. Very elegant!"
"D - This is a little more hoppy than I'm used to but it all works out and is a pretty enjoyable beer that I could drink a few of theses in a sitting"
"D - Quite drinkable. The ABV is right where it needs to be to be a great drinking beer. It really is quite impressive for ""just an IPA."" It is quite tasty and could rival some DIPA's."
"Great carbonation, actually on the light side for an IPA. One of the most refreshing I've had, and just awesome drinkability. Dangerous."
"D - Pretty good IPA but doesn't blow me away. I'd drink this one again but wouldn't seek it out. I had high expectations for Alesmith... I'm sure the Speedway will live up to them because this didn't"
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. The balance in the taste (read: ""not a hop bomb""), the thinness of the mouthfeel, and the fact that the alcohol is completely hidden make this a very drinkable beer. I wish I could enjoy this one more often, sadly it's not distributed in my neck of the woods. The best IPA I have had to date. (In the past month I've had Sculpin, Dreadnaught, Abrasive, Hop Rod Rye, Alpine PH, Nelson, Duet, Blind pig, and PtE a few months ago)."
"Drinkability was good. I liked it, and I would have it again, but the one bottle was enough for me. I may buy another and cellar it for 6 months to see if the hops mellow."
"D: Drinkability is remarkable. In case it went unnoticed, the 7.25% ABV keeps this one safely below the DIPA range. (This website and the bottle itself state 7.25%, even though Alesmith's website adds a half point.) I'm amazed by how the flavor is even more impressive than many respectable DIPAs."
"D- Actually drainpoured this one. The soapy sweetness was not vibing with me at all. Not sure if it was an off-bottle, but it was just not enjoyable. This beer looked and smelled so good and was a huge letdown. Perhaps I'll have to get another bottle. My least favorite Alesmith to date."
"Notes: Damn, not quite as amazing as I expected, but really good nonetheless. I've heard very different things. The good news is that I have a few more bombers of this to let sit for a little, and see if the flavor settles down."
"D: A very drinkable IPA. A nice beer with an extra kick."
"D - This just world-class, along the lines of Sculpin IPA, Green Flash West Coast IPA, Just Outstanding IPA; I want more. Now."
"Drinkability - I could drink the bomber of this quite easily but I would probably stop there, it's a great beer but the market would keep me from drinking it all the time, probably along with the price. I could see it being a fairly regular treat though."
"O: This beer has a great nose per style. A very bitter IPA. However I found this beer to be lacking in mouthfeel and taste. Suggest more in the way of malt character that would improve the body and flavor of this beer."
"D: Wow, one of the best IPA's I've ever tried, possibly beaten out only by Sculpin in flavor profile while a hair smoother than Two-Hearted."
"I will definitely be drinking this one again if I get the chance...."
"overall - tasty. easy to drink, especially for 7.25%!"
"Feels light and airy with tons of carbonation. This feel like it could be an ultimate summertime beer--- then the 7% abv would catch up to you! The taste is refreshing too. Very nicely balanced, but leaning towards the hoppier side."
"D- OUTSTANDING! I could drink this for days. I have had DIPAs that have failed to touch this single IPA. I'd say it's probably the best single IPA I have had to date. Well done Alesmith."
"D: Good. I could see this being a regular if I could buy it in GA."
"D - This is a really good American IPA. I'm really glad I was able to finally try this."
"I can't get enough of the in-your-face hops, but the alcohol definitely detracts from both the flavor profile and my ability to drink much of this. When did single IPAs climb over 7%? Bring this down into the 6.5-7.0% range and I'd be all over this one."
"Reviewed 5-25-10 1st review!"
"This is a deliciously drinkable IPA. I completely understand why it gets such great reviews. Just be sure to let it sit for a little bit after uncapping to avoid its instability."
"overall: I can see why this beer gets so much love its a great beer!"
"D: damn good beer in every category and drinks great all the way through. Now I can see why it's in the top 100."
"If you're into American styled IPA this is a great one for you, and getting a big bottle is an extra plus (yes it's even possible to share this bottle)!"
"A beer that is so packed with aroma and taste that it really needs good time to indulge. But worth every minute of it. Possibly a bit too much hops compared to the malt."
"Pretty good IPA overall, the feel was a little off to me and the malt maybe a tad bit too forward, but overall I enjoyed this beer and would definitely give it another go in the future..."
"Very good version of a highly hopped IPA, and quite drinkable."
"D: Nice, very fruity. I usually like a little more balance between hops and malt in my beers. Here it's almost all hops, nice though."
"Pours a lovely medium amber that is orange in the center and golden around the edges. A equally lovely layer of fluffy foam sits on top, slowly melting into the beer and leaving sticky lace. The aroma is full on American northwest hops. Grapefruit, orange and pine. I also detect just a bit of toasted malty sweetness. One sip and I can tell this is definitely a west coast IPA. Tons of hop flavor inundates my tongue. Grapefruit, pine, orange and some dank skunkyness. These hops taste fresh as hell and are delicious. The malt is WAY in the back but does a good job of holding up the hops and keeping this from being too much of a bruiser. Not as bitter as some west coast IPAs, I really am digging what this beer has to offer. The mouthfeel is medium with a very nice amount of carbonation and a clean dry finish. Very drinkable if you are into hops, and one of the finest, if not THE finest IPA I have ever had."
"The mouthfeel here is probably the best thing with this beer, really luxurious and fresh, would really love to try this hyped beer fresh :("
"This definitely lives up to the hype and the malty notes are the star of the show. They bring a profound balance and make this 7.25% brew feel as light as a feather."
"This brew has a little of everything, albeit leaning toward hoppy bitterness. This would be a great warm weather refreshment and I will seek it out again for sure."
"This is a wonderful IPA and a great representative of the west coast style. I'd definitely drink this on a regular basis if I lived in an area with distribution."
"Wonderful...a fantastic IPA, without any doubt. Excuse me while I go soak up some sun and revel in this beauty."
"Poured a beautiful shade of hazy orange into my Delirium Tulip. Smells of an amalgamation of west coast citrus hops. A little bit of juicy tropical flavor shines through while pine and grapefruit dominate. The taste brings the aroma to full light with a biting wet hop mouthfeel and a crisp drinkable easy malt backbone. Perfectly balanced to my hophead tastes with a smell that will reel you in and keep asking for more, even when the 22oz runs dry. I wish this was made into 12oz beers but until then I will drink West Coast IPA. This beer finishes beautifully and any other standard six pack IPA will pale in comparison."
"Wow. This is an amazing beer. This might be the best IPA I have ever had. It's too bad Alesmith isn't more available. Anyone that is a fan of IPAs needs to try this."
"This one lacked a little for me because the nose was so fantastic but the taste did not follow suit. This was my least favorite of the evening."
"D: I'm very impressed. Easy to drink and delicious. I will recommend this to absolutely everyone."
"D- Very drinkable. Finishing a whole bomber would be no problem. I will be buying more of this."
"Na Zdravje!"
"22 oz. bottle courtesy of OneDropSoup. Pours a hazy deep yellow with a thick, bone-white head. Sweet, floral bouquet. Tastes amazingly fresh despite the cross-country voyage; strong hop flavor blends with a subtle yeastiness that one doesn't often find in an IPA. Feels quite nice on the palate, too; this beer disappeared quickly. I don't think I've had an IPA from San Diego that was anything short of excellent."
"Quite enjoyable - Shakeyhands and I approve"
"drinkability - great taste, flavorful, quite drinkable for an ipa, one of my favorites"
"d - Overall I thought this was a great IPA. Lots of hops, citrus, and bitterness to it and a very enjoyable IPA. Alcohol is not noticable. Would highly reccomend and would love to try again."
"D- glad to have tried this one. a good west coast style IPA that due to the pour mouthfeel gets lost in a sea of similar beers for me. still worth a try."
"A gold colored beer with a huge white head that resembled whipped cream. Very sticky, lots of lacing. Aroma of citrus, floral, and sweet malt. The taste was more pine than grapefruit, but both were well-represented. Still a good malt presence. A very nice, well-balanced beer."
"Drinkability: The beer is 7.25 ABV. So drinkability is relative!"
"Taste is straight up clean and full of hoppy goodness. Citrus presence is very fine and the bitterness levels aren't too high or overpowering. Not much to say, except it's pretty much what you would expect in a traditional IPA. Very nice and enjoyable overall. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and fairly carbonated. No complaints here. The drinkability is great - exceptionally easy to drink for the night. Keep to yourself or share with a friend, you can't go wrong with either choice. Excellent Cali IPA from Alesmith."
"Light in the mouth, med carb, extremely drinkable. Just damn tasty."
"Overall impression: Excellent IPA. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: I could drink this one all day and the alcohol is well hidden. This is one of the most floral beers I have had. Not overly balanced but very good."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, almost cask-like, just a touch more carbonated. An easy drinker and a very good IPA."
"medium body, sometimes light, but lots of resins, yet also smooth overall. nearly fizzy carbonation, but as mentioned, lifts the resins off the palate, plus adds a fluffiness."
"D - This is an ipa right here. This ipa isn't on the JV team, it's on Varsity, and it's starting quarterback. Beast of an ipa at an abv where you can have more than a tulip of it. Very well done."
"Great stuff. I really want to have a less-carbonated version sometime, be it on-tap or in the bottle."
"Overall this beer has some carbonation issues, but those don't really stop me from enjoying the good aroma and flavor that come with the copious amounts of hops in Alesmith IPA."
"Overall a spectacular beer. I could drink this one on a daily basis."
"There isn't much I didn't like about this beer. The flavor profile is delicious, albeit a tad tame, and the mouthfeel is pretty damn good. This is a solid beer on all fronts."
"The Alesmeith IPA pours a brilliant orange color and a huge 4 finger head sits atop even after a generous pour. Lots of lacing on the glass and the retention makes this hard to drink without getting a foam mustache. Aromas are mostly grapefruit and orange peels. Some nice hoppy floral scents are also present. Quaff is sweet and floral up front with a very strong hop kick that leaves the palate wanting another sip to ease up the dryness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are pinpoint. The ABV allows for a few to go down easily . Another great west coast IPA, thanks again Jesse."
"D - The hops don't burn out my tastebuds but it is still apparent this is a big beer. I'm really surprised at how dry it is though. I'm drinking it slowly, but enjoying it quite a bit."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and it is a refreshing beer. The drinkability is awesome for a west coast IPA. Smooth with lots of flavor going on. My new favorite IPA."
"D One and done for me and this will be my only beer tonight. 3.5"
"D: it's pretty good, but definitely not the first IPA I'd reach for, though it's a solid choice when there's nothing else"
"Great beer. If you're familiar with Bell's Two Hearted (which I love) you'll find a lot of similarities, except that the Ale Smith is unfiltered."
"Overall it's a good beer and I never see it on tap at the usuall places and if I ever do get some fresh I will re review but it's not worth trading for or purposefully seeking out."
"On a side note there is no way this is just an IPA. This should be a quintuple IPA if ever there was one. I either got one mega fresh or this is one of the highest intensity flavored beers I've ever had."
"D: Pleasant, smooth hopiness makes this a great IPA. Very clean and refreshing"
"D: Very drinkable, this bomber was done in no time. I was amazed at how all the flavors came together, it was excellent."
"Opaque orange pour with a big, loose, white head. Bright citrus aroma with some floralness to it and hints of melon and honey. Loads of grapefruit, mango and melon flavor with a sweet toffee malt body. The mouthfeel is medium, sticky and loaded with cleasnsing carbonation."
"Clear amber orange color with a big rocky white head. Aroma is really attractive, actually it's fantastic. I smell grapefruit, orange, spice... what a wonderful mix. Flavor is almost as good as the aroma. Pine, grapefruit, some pepper, resin, awesome. The body is just about perfect. Fantastic IPA."
"D :: Pronounced sweetness aside, I wouldn't mind enjoying several of these poolside on a balmy summer afternoon. Despite its origin, categorize this beer in the file of generic IPA--not West Coast IPA--and you will certainly enjoy. Uncharacteristic for a San Diego IPA, AleSmith IPA would be a strong contender were it not from a region that produces the likes of Green Flash, Alpine, Port, etc."
"Pours a hazy, golden orange with a huge white head. The aroma is strong citrus and pine hops. The flavor is more of the same, without the bitterness you sometimes get in West Coast IPAs. Even without the bitterness, there is tons of hop flavor. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation."
"As this beer warmed and carbonation mellowed it became a perfect velvety texture and is silky/oily on the tongue. Wonderfull, a really solid IPA. A great pick when looking for a solid IPA."
"Poured from bomber to pint glass. Pours an amber body with a large off-white head with good retention and some webby lacing. Smells strongly of hops with hints of grapefruit and orange with a bit a sweetnenss. Taste is right on with the smell, pretty hoppy with lots of citrus and a nice malt backbone. Very solid beer for a great price. Wish we got it in MN"
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass at Barley and Hops Tavern. The beer is a hazy amber color with two fingers of white, foamy head. Good lacing. Smells of citrus and pine. Really good! First drink confirms the aroma. Loads of pineapple, orange, and piney hops. Malt is there, but is totally overpowered by the hop bitterness. 7.25 ABV is not evident. This is a very drinkable IPA. An excellent example of the west coast style. I have had this beer many times, and it continues to be one of my favorites. Highly recommended!"
"D: Real good. Great beer."
"D - AlesSmith crafts another great one. Very pleasing to drink. An excellent, high-quality west coast IPA for those who love the style."
"I poured from a bomber into my SA perfect pint glass. Light, clear amber in appearance with a big 2 finger white head. The nose is big, clean citrus with sweet pine potpouri mixed in. The flavor follows the nose. The finish lingers with lots of sweet grapefruit. It is medium in body and dangerously drinkable. This beer deserves all the props it gets."
"Clean crisp medium body that is very hop forward with a good balance of sweet citrus and dry pine notes. Pretty bitter and dry at first but with a nice amount of lemon and orange peel, mango and grapefruit and a subtle Graham cracker malt backbone that doesn't interfere with the glorious hoppiness. Lingering dry finish. Delicious dank, oily chewy hopbomb! Highly recommended!"
"I wish AleSmith used a bottling date so I could know how fresh this is. Very good as is, but am I missing out on an even better beer?"
"Why did I only buy one bottle?!? This beer almost makes me think I should knock a 1/2 point off some of the others I have reviewed. Awesome."
"D: Body and nose help but everything about this beer screams too much for me. Too much head, too much lacing, too much hops. Good for what it is which is a hop bomb but completely unbalanced. Worth trying but only once."
"Overall this was a bit of a disappointment, but overall it was a pretty decent American IPA, but it certainly did not live up to the hype. Perhaps this was just a bad bottle, or maybe the hype was too much for me. In the future I'll grab another bottle and compare. Thanks again Jared! Worth a Look."
"Mouthfeel is a medium-full with a a good amount of carbonation."
"Looks like the perfect beer! Has a somewhat hazy dark golden color with a thick foam. The head reminds me of a Belgian beer because it set into an almost solid layer above the beer. Tons of lace left behind on the glass. Smell is hoppy. Peach and apricots. The taste is similar with a crisp finish which adds to the drinkability. The bitterness of the hops lingers a little, but it fades quickly and completely enough to allow exceptional drinkability. The mouthfeel could have just a little more carbonation to allow for a slightly more airy texture. But it was good nonetheless. Exceptional beer. Somewhat reminiscent of Alesmith's Yulesmith winter IPA, but with a little less bite."
"Cheers!"
"D: Highly drinkable, so much so I may move to San Diego so I can get this on a regular basis."
"D - not the best, but a pretty solid west coast IPA with a east coast touch."
"Drinkability: This isn't a terrible beer, although I was really hoping for a bit more. It becomes much, much better as it warms up and some of the carbonation dies off. The hop profile is rather hidden until it warms up. This isn't something I'd pick up again. Much better IPA's are scattered throughout the country."
"Another surprise find at Table & Vine. I had read about the insane head on this beer but I still wasn't prepared, as soon as I opened it carbonation bubbles are clearly seen flying up in the bottle, I pour very slowly and it still reveals 50% towering white head, 50% very light orange beer with numerous carbonation bubbles flying everywhere, and a tiny bit of sediment also. The head slowly dissipates and crumbles into strange beastly shapes, leaves lacing down the glass like cotton candy. A city could be hidden in there. Smell is faint at first but comes out a bit more when the head calms down, smells much like the great tastes - floral hops, citrus/peach, tropical fruit and lemon notes. Tastes get better and more prominent with every sip. Very drinkable, alcohol barely detectable. The last pour (3rd overall) is much more hazy and full of sediment, other than that drinks about the same. Light and a good amount of carbonation. The great thing about this beer is that it has all the traits of your average IPA yet it is so much more than that, much more complex. I don't think it's A+ worthy because it didn't really WOW me, but it's really damn close. A must-try for IPA fans."
"A: Some serious issues on the head, a hard pour with a very cold beer resulted in 8 inches of head to an inch of beer, as the head settles a thick craggy and cottony mound formed and tons of lacing is left on the sides of the glass, noticeable sediment, the color is a dulled gold - 3.50, S: Loads of citrus, there must be some Centennial hops in this beer, smooth tropical fruit sweetness - 4.50, T: Grapefruit and a hint of pine, nice crisp hop bite, caramel malts - 4.50, M: Smooth mouth feel - 4.25, D: One of the better IPAs I've had in some time and another grand success out of San Diego, extremely drinkable - 4.75"
"really hoping that this one would be as great as the reviews cause i sat on it and waited til buds came over."
"The feel is pretty darn great. It has a light mouthfeel that goes down pretty darn easy and it just sweet to the taste buds. A great hop experience."
"D-great mouthfeel and solid taste make it very tasty and it goes down very well. it has a little alcohol metallic taste that take away from it a little, but very nice for a single and quite complex for an ipa!"
"This was a nice American IPA with a prodigious head that was immense. The head never quit, and unless you pour the beer ultra slowly fully tipped, you will have to wait out the foamy thick billowing head from this beer. The beer is a bit cloudy with some fine particulates floating about. I will review this beer with more contemplation at a later time, but for now, the beer has the orange burst of an American IPA. It is not as grapefruity or acerbic or estery and oily from the hop. The hop quality seemed a bit dry and leafy but the nice orange burst was a treat. This review will continue at a later time."
"Huge head made me wait, but well worth it."
"Started pouring this beer and only got about 1/3 of it in my 1/2 L Ayinger willibecker glass. Pours with a ton of head. The aroma hits me from a couple feet away, this is going to be a great IPA. I can smell the hops, grapefruity, floral goodness. The taste punches my tongue and I want it to keep beating me. This is a great beer. Have to say the only downside is that after a couple sips, my taste buds are destroyed. Either I stick with the hops or I will have to go to my backup session beer because this is so flavorful I can't taste anything else. The mouthfeel is what I would expect out of a good IPA, lightly carbonated with a medium body. The drinkability is great, I could drink a couple of these. However I would probably fall down after that because I can definitely feel the alcohol in this one. Great beer!"
"Really delicious, unique IPA. Would try it again if I could find it around here (I can't)."
"Drinkability: this beer is very easy to drink and is just a great quality beer you don't want to put down."
"This beer is explosion. I poured once ounce and it made a four finger head, even when down the side very slowly. Not sure how I am supposed to drink it. This head is a monster, I thought Sculpin was nuts. One hand head that retains like a freakin superhero. No points are deducted from this on appearance, there is nothing wrong here. Smell is good stuff. Large hints of pine, pineapple, citrus fruits like lemon and orange, more hops. This is certainly a hop bomb, the malts are there but no where in sight in the hose. I would give it a 5.0 but Sculpin's scent is a whole level above this. Taste is also a hop bomb, malts in there but it's mostly a nice blend of citrus hops, pineapple is amazing in this beer. Piney hops also present. Mouthfeel is appropriate, nice medium carbonation, moderate body, perfect for a huge IPA. Drinkability is great, the price is a bit much around here but worth it, the hops will get too much after a while. Alesmith continues to impress me."
"Big carbonation for an IPA, but not obtrusive. This is very light and bouncy for such a flavorful brew. Bitterness builds steadily, but in a pleasant, warming way. A unique IPA."
"Respectable but not very impressive by a west coast IPA. Was very excited to see it back on the shelfs after what I was told to be ""distrbution problem"". Freshness is suspect here but really feels like lighting a firecracker and finding out its a dud."
"A true West Coast IPA. This is how it's done bitches! Recognize!"
"Poured a deep gold with a huge chunky head, very inviting on this frigid night. Smell were sweet hops typical of you west coast IPA. Taste was better than I expected, the hops balance nicely with the malty finish. Thehigh ABV was masked bu the balance. This was a better than expected beer and would totaly pick this up again."
"OVERALL: Though the body was a little light, this might be the best IPA I've had yet. Very enjoyable and dangerously drinkable, this is one to watch out for. Its bold flavors and higher ABV put it at the border of DIPA country. A little more juice and it might have to defect. That said, I can certainly see why this is one of the most highly acclaimed IPA's in the land. If you're a fan of the style, you won't be disappointed. I just hope I can find more of these. Recommended."
"All in all, this one is a little overrated in my opinion. Not for me. It's good, but too harsh with the hops."
"D- Alright, but not great for an IPA. I wouldnt have the whole bomber as I shared with kfsv034. Slightly dissapointing brew."
"This IPA from AleSmith was everything I had expected. Hoppy, yet well-balanced and so drinkable. I highly recommend."
"Overall- very good. unique and complex. well crafted."
"Beer is full bodied. Good beer, feels like you are chewing through the hops. Fills my mouth. There is nice palate connectivity. Overall a great experience. Second drink, beer is a little dry. The hop resin completely coats your mouth. Lots of sweet hop flavor and nice back of the mouth bitterness. No real aftertaste. Drinkability high, great mouthfeel, overall a great IPA experience."
"Acidic pineapple and sharp pine aroma. Taste is sharp citrus rind and snappy light cracker malt--extremely biting. I know IPAs arent's supposed to be balanced, and West Coast ones even less so, but the hops are so sharp and the malt is so weak it's just downrght unpleasant I tell you. Tastes like a homebrew gone centennial crazy. Thin, bottle-conditioned smooth mouthfeel."
"Another example of what is probably considered an ""extreme"" IPA but those anywhere but the West Coast. Could drink this all day."
"Overall, this is an essential IPA. So much flavor, great balance between the hops and malt, and really beautiful to look at. Definitely one of my top three IPA's. Would love to try this on cask."
"I like it; worthy of another try. I'm looking forward to more AleSmith."
"O: Has a bit of hop funk, very resinous, lightly rough alc, well done, excellentwest coast IPA, one of the best ipas i've had"
"Very drinkable. I wish we had it here in Maine."
"D: THis is one of those beers where a bomber just barely seems like enough"
"Pours a couple of shades darker than lager with a 4 inch thick bubbly white head that persists forever. Loads of citrus and pine fill my nostrils, slightly spicy/earthy as well. Taste is mostly pine and citrus maybe some bread or caramel if I strain really really hard, but this one really is all about the hops. Long lingering hop bitterness in the finish. Carbonation is high, mouthfeel is sticky/resinous, body is medium. I'm torn, I really wanted to love this one, but I just don't. I find it over carbonated, one dimensional and a little boring. Maybe one day I can revisit this one on tap."
"Drinkability: AleSmith did another excellent job brewing a hoppy IPA that was well balanced at the same time. I don't think many breweries can say that. Like every AleSmith beer, it's not cheap! If you're able to find it, you're going to have to open your wallet wide. And like every AleSmith beer, you'll be glad in the long run that you spent that money on such a great beer. Big thanks to the state of Ohio for carrying such a great IPA!"
"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with a nice frothy white head. Laced nicely down the glass and the head lasted through the glass. Very good looking beer. Aroma is strong with the citrus and grapefruit hops which smell excellant. I love the taste of this beer, the hops are nicely done a lot of the citrus and grapefruit flavors and not extremely bitter. This is right up there with the best IPA's I have ever tried. I would buy this frequently if I could. Very drinkable, enjoying the bomber myself today watching some football."
"The drink is an easy one to swallow, and is fluffy-medium in body with understated carbonation. Highly drinkable and * almost * as good as the Pliny... Thanks, Murch!"
"If AleSmith was distributed in Maine, I could see this being one of my go-to IPA's."
"D - my burps remind me of what a wonderfully crafted beer I am consuming. I cannon get this here in Denver, so I am savoring all 22 ounces for all they are worth!"
"This IPA is one of the best and deserves it's high rating. I wish AleSmith would follow Ballast Point and start sending their beer to Philadelphia. I want more."
"The taste is very smooth nothing overpowering. There is missing a nice hard bitter bite. The hops are present just not overwhelming which hurt on the taste but make this a very crushable ipa."
"For those not accustomed to IPAs, this would be a perfect starting point!"
"Poured a 22oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a tawny orange with just a little bit of ruby highlights when held up to the light. This beer creates a big 3 inch head that leaves some really sticky lacing tight lacing all the way down the sides of the glass. The aroma is very similar to any good west coast American IPA. Hops, hops and citrusy hops. The nose starts out with bright orange, a little lemon, and finished with just a bit of bitter white grapefruit rind. There is also just a light, mild, malty sweetness that lingers in the nostril at the tail of the aroma. The flavor is very similar but Grapefruit really is the dominant flavor. Rind bitterness, orange and just a bit of medical bitterness. I'm actually surprised with how much malt comes through. There is definitely a bit of a backbone to the hops. The mouthfeel is light leaving a great citrusy residue lingering on the palate. This really is a great brew. Glad I finally got the opportunity to try it."
"Drinkability: This one has big flavors and a decent abv but remains fairly drinkabile."
"Final thoughts: For a West Coast IPA this is really the definition. It has a really strong piney and citrus hop presence and hop oils etc, without even hinting at the slightly malt base. Slightly sweet taste to start but very dry to finish. It seems to go overboard on the carbonation too. I'm surprised how well it made the time on the shelf as it still has its great hop tastes, aromas, bitterness, and hasn't malted or sweetened and many beers like this would. It also has a lot of sediment that came from extra bottle conditioning over time, I assume, and probably left behind the ridiculous carbonation. I've had some better IPAs before, both WC and EC, but this one is still a good fallback if you can get it. Would like to see it show up here again with a nice freshness, damn distribution follies!"
"D: One hell of a drinker, only limited by its strength."
"M/D: Oddly very creamy with a nice sweet and bitter taste. Very good beer and under the radar, not noticed as much as it should be. Could drink 2-3 bombers easily."
"D. I knew this was a good beer before I tried it for the first time, but I wasn't expecting one of the best IPA's I have ever had. I haven't had all of the highest rated IPAs, but this is Extremely good."
"This is just an overall good beer. I only wish I could buy it closer to home."
"4.5 D: Great beer overall with no real flaws."
"A classic, excellent West Coast American IPA"
"D- A great brew that I may have built up a little too much in my head. Certainly worth trying but I was hoping for a bit more citrusy hop flavor."
"T/M/D - Because the carbonation was higher it made a nice lighter mouthfeel and bring out all the fruity/citrus flavors from the hops; however, the drinkability was thicker because of the amount of sugary malts used. Overall it is a very good IPA, but still not my favorite because it wasn't as crisp as I'd like."
"I'm on the fence about this beer. There is a sweet grapefruit character in the beer that I really enjoy, but it needs more of a malt backbone. This is the first time I've had this beer. First impression is mediocre, but it's growing on me as I near the end of the 22oz. Could be the 7.25%ABV."
"This is truly a delicious beer and I need to keep one of these in the fridge at all times."
"Excellent IPA, one of the best normal (non-imperial) IPAs I have ever had."
"Drinkability: Really, really high. The flavors are well-pronounced and balanced. It's a big beer without being too big."
"Driniability: Quite high - it's a great tasting IPA, but the price is a bit high. Alesmith really has yet to let me down."
"This has definitely taken over as my personal favorite IPA."
"O: Overall this is a good IPA but not the best. PtE has this beat on all accounts and for Alesmith I think that I prefer a fresh Winter Yulesmith - not sure why this one is rated higher?"
"Cheers!!!"
"This is a very high rated IPA and i can't understand why. Maybe this bottle is too old or something but for me this is just a mediocre brew."
"Bottle pours a syrupy golden hue. When I hold this up to the light it looks like malt extract syrup in my glass with lots of hop particles in it. Has a little alcohol smell with some hops. Taste is very smooth with lots of citrus and lots of lots of thick resin flavors of hops. A very nice IPA."
"Drinkability - A bit bitter at first and a tongue burner but overall a very nice IPA. I still prefer Pliny over this (as of now...I will for sure give this another shot) because I feel the flavors and beer in general is more mellow yet complex. Still, a very good beer."
"D - A balanced and complex beer. I really like this IPA."
"D - Non-abrasive, non-offensive & an all-around fine brew. Very drinkable, this is certainly a choice IPA."
"D - A very good drinking IPA, one of the best w/ intense hop flavor and balanced acidity and bitterness w/ a bit of a pain to pour foaming into four glasses but the quality of the beer is hard to beat, a really great example of the style"
"Overall good IPA, not as bitter as I was expecting however very good balance in flavors. Allowing the beer to warm reveals a good amount for this brew. I'm lucky to have this beer, and Alesmith in my hometown."
"I had this in a bottle on 8/9/09. The appearance is typical American IPA with a caramel color. Excellent head retention and unbelieveable lacing sticks on the side of the glass. The smell starts with a true hop aroma but not over the top. The taste is wonderful. A little citrus but with the extra kick in alcohol (7.25%) it adds a nice malt flavor to balance it out. Mouthfeel is outstanding, with a smooth finish. I enjoyed this better than these great IPA's as well (DogFish Head 90 and Victory Hop Devil Ale)."
"This is a BIG IPA in my opinion, DIPA? This one is a beast among men and drinkable to boot. Out-fucking-standing."
"Very drinkable hop forawrd IPA. excellent flavor and excellent bitterness combine for a solid juicy hoptastic citrus bomb of an IPA."
"The mouth was a bit thinner than I expected. Could use a bit more carbonation play. This was a pretty bitter IPA. Plenty of citrus hop bitterness, but not as balanced out with malt sweetness as I would have liked. Finishes tart and perky. This is a good IPA, and I'm glad I traded for a few of these. Thanks again, Jim."
"A smooth, high-hopped beer. While it is spicy and bitter, there is a solid malt base, almost buttery. Still, this is a story of the hop. The swallow and the aftertaste is biting, like fresh ground pepper. The alcohol is well-hidden and the body is neutral for the style. A deceptively easy beer to drink."
"Pours out as orange/amber with a generous two finger head. In your face orange and grapefruit aroma, very nice. Taste is definitely hoppy citrus with some pine bitterness, not a lot. Also some malty sweetness to balance the hops a bit. Feels good, drinks great. This was my first IPA and still my favorite."
"D - Very drinkable. Could do a whole session. Would love to have easier access to this brew."
"Overall this IPA lived up to the hype. Probably in the top 3-5 IPA's I've had that are available year round. Definitely worth a shot."
"D: A wonderful IPA from AleSmith, good balance (despite that fact that you don't necessarily taste the malt), and great bitterness."
"Pours a slightly hazy honey brown color with a very nice tight white head that is settling extremely slowly. Nice rocky head. The aroma is a nice citrus/grapefruit hop aroma. Very juicy. The taste is of grapefruit hops, a bit of pine and asprin. There is a noticable malt presence but it takes a way backseat to the malt, can't really distinguish it in the flavor. A nice moderate feel with soft to tingley carbonation, which gives the brew a smooth feel. However, the asprin like characteristics lead to a very dry brew, which is a negative in my book. A very nice hoppy IPA. Has some real nice hop flavors but the asprin characteristics kill it for me a bit."
"Overall, an excellent AIPA. High recommend. Would like to try another without the over carbonation. Not available here so not in rotation but might trade/seek another one or two."
"Bomber from possibly 2008. White head with a golden color. Smells like sweet citrus and hops. This beer is incredibly smooth to drink and has no harsh bitter hops flavor. Aftertaste is dry and smooth as well. Alcohol is not detectable for a 7.25% beer. Carbonation is pretty low. This is probably one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Too bad Massachusettes doesn't get much from AleSmith or I would drink this all the time, and I rarely drink IPAs. This beer could easily creep up on you with it's high alcohol so watch out."
"I was able to put this one down fairly easily despite the seven and a quarter percent abv. There's plenty of flavor, the right amount of alcohol, and really hits the spot if you're looking for a notable IPA. Check this one out if you can get ahold of it."
"Poured from a 22oz. bottle into my Brickstone pint glass. Poured a darker blond color in my glass with a very nice three finger head. Aroma was citrus with a hoppy smell right up front. Flavor was a really nice IPA - lots of hop citrus balanced out by the malt that was also present. Mouthfeel was dry and crisp. This was a very tastee treat indeed. This is very drinkable and I would gladly try this one again if the opportunity arises."
"D - Great. Classic example of an IPA. Few are better than this one."
"I bought this bottle at Blacklick Liquor on Broad St in Columbus/Reynoldsburg/Blacklick. I will likely be back for more!"
"(i don't think Ben and I are drinking the same beer)"
"A golden amber color with a giant oatmeal big-bubbled head and plenty of lace. Many giant white floaties. The aroma is a spicey floral hops which quickly gives way to a peaty herbal quality. The flavor brings a pleasantly malty citrus-pine hop kick. It's mid-bodied and evenly carbonated. There's yeasty bread and smooth bitterness. Very nice."
"Edit: I decided to put the yeast on the bottle of the bottle into my last pour to see if it would change the flavor and the only think it did was make the flavor a touch more bready/yeasty. Not much of an affect."
"Overall an amazing beer. Among the best I've had in the style. It had been awhile since I'd tried it and it's even better than I remember. I'm glad it's finally becoming easier to find at a reasonable price in my area. If you love American IPA this is a can't miss."
"D:"
"A great beer that I would love to have once a month if that were possible."
"This is a very good beer, amongst other great beers. Perhaps one the best IPA's I've come across. Drinkability factor is great, if one takes the time to fully appreciate its subtleties. Home run for AleSmith. Next on my list is Decadence."
"Seriously, this is an amazing beer. Now that I've tried it, I'm even sadder that I can't get it in my area. I'm grateful to generous traders like portia99, who threw this bomber in as an extra. I need to find a way to make this a regular in the fridge."
"Drinkability: Pretty solid. I drank the bomber without really thinking about the amount and it was gone pretty quickly. Could drink again, but for a more complex flavor, I'd go for Green Flash or Stone's IPAs."
"This beer is one of the better IPA's I've had the opportunity to try. It's hop presence is right up my alley, and although it has a strong hop aroma, it is strangely balanced in taste. An impressive brew. I wish that I could get this in 6 packs."
"Certainly a top-tier IPA. Deserving of all of its praise. A much better beer warm than cold."
"Everything is there, and this is a very solid IPA. Not my favorite tasting IPA as I prefer a stronger hop presence and more complexity. I do prefer this to a lot of West Coast IPAs like Stone and Bear Republic. This beer might not knock your socks off, but it is well crafted and very nice. Worth a shot."
"Pours clear copper with a thick, frothy, stable head. Aroma is light fruit, citrus, pine, and earthy notes. Flavor brings a bit of a sticky, resiny hop flavor. The hops are slightly overdone, which compromises smoothness, leaving a bit of an astringent aftertaste. Though a tasty beer, this aspect does detract from drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is nicely full, very smooth and goes down like a Geisha. Couldn't drink this every day, but quite nice anyway."
"pored from a bomber, the first half was a mostly clear golden orange, the second a cloudy light amber due to the yeast sediment. creamy white head and lacing. honeyed citrus and floral in the first pour, bready, yeasty, and spicy in the latter pour. sweet doughy bready malts are washed out by the big but not harsh hop grapefruity bitterness. a bit of pepper and spice on the end, esp in the second pour. medium bodied. first half is prickly and frothy, second half is chewy. long drying bitter finish. a good example of a west coast ipa."
"This is no where near my favorite but not my least favorite IPA. I won't go buy it again. Burnt crystal malt is heavy. I'm not sure but I think i'm picking up some hop extract in this one. Whatever it is it is a major turn off. Yeah... San Diego has many more better tasting IPAs than this one. I don't recommend it."
"Pours hazed orangeish, more on the gold side in color with a thick foamy head, andsame lacing down the glass. Amora is strong with pine, grapefruit, citrus, truly what an IPA should smell like. One of the more hoppy IPAs i've had in a while, very bitter, yet balanced, not for the weak. Very piney, citris, and earthy is taste. The mouthfeel was amazing, bitterness hops all over the mouth, creamy and smooth. Very easy drinking for 7.25%. Glad i was finally able to find this beer, def a west coast IPA that stands out"
"A very good IPA, nothing eye-popping, but definitely above average."
"A sharp, but extremely well balanced IPA. Oh, how I love this style, and how the Americans do it. Every time I sample a beer like this, I'm taken back to a wonderful Californian summer. No matter what else the yanks do, they do brew a few fucking awesome beers."
"Pours an orangish brown with a thick beige head. Nice lace. Nose has citrus hops and caramel malts. Taste has bitter hops and sweet malts up front followed by more fruity hops through the finish. Medium body is well carbonated. Good IPA from Alesmith."
"Quite a drinkable IPA."
"After a slight IPA binge, I'd say this beer is not what I expected from the Alesmith hype. While tasty, the Pizza Port Swami's I had earlier was much better. I've had homebrews this good (which IS A GOOD THING!), but I feel it's like any other IPA out there. A bit sweet, not as dry as some and definitely not as hoppy as some others (doesn't taste or smell dry-hopped). While a great beer, it feels less pacific coast IPA and more east coast/british in style. Balanced though. Definitely a good beer. The head is creame and it stays around."
"D: This is a tongue burner of an IPA. It's true to style and flavorful. I would definitely buy this again."
"This is a very satisfying brew that I would buy again to share as an example of the style but among all IPAs I think there are few better."
"A sweet new find at my local super (for anyone in Dutchess county area Fresh Town has a good good selection!). 22 oz. bomber. Appropriately warmed. Poured an extremely clear golden yellow color with a generous white head. Plenty of lacing stuck to the side. The nose is highly potent with pine redolence and notes of grapefruit. The taste is all bittering hops in the fore. During the middle of the blush there is some slight aromatic hop presence, but the finish returns to that super bitter pine flavor. Mouthfeel was slightly scratchy, but plenty of crispness as well. I could probably drink a couple of these, but the hops would pretty much prevent me from enjoying anything else in the same evening. Good stuff."
"D= very drinkable if you enjoy hoppy Pale Ale's."
"Overall: Great IPA, would most definitely would buy again."
"A very good, straightforward IPA. An excellent mouthfeel and crisp hop flavors."
"Drinkibility is good. I actually plowed through the bomber I had. Not my favorite IPA, but it's very well crafted. I'd love to try this on tap."
"Uneven hills of white foam across the surface, crests a little over one finger, islands of big bubbles here and there, lacing displays serious stickiness. Copper orange color with a metallic tinge, dark yellow hued rims, not hazy per se but nowhere close to transparency. Dense citrusy nose of pink and white grapefruit, mandarin orange and lemon citrus chunks, pine, crisply baked scones, the fruit scents tart but in no way over the top in striving for tropicality, nectarine, pineapple, peach, guava, powdery mocha from the malts, a floral musk fills the nostrils before it dissolves, extending presence. Medium-bodied, muscular without trying to take up too much room just for the sake of it. While dry and leaving a tacky residue behind, the grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus can be as sweet as it can be sour. Less pine, more general herbaceousness bitterness. The bready or yeasty component reduced. The florality a bit earthbound, yet, no less pungent. Apricot and peach more present as it warms. Has a ""rough balance"" in that it's not particularly graceful, more like the guy who can outlast the others keeping upright on the rolling log in the lake."
"Got this bomber in a trade from fatboyjim1 as an extra. I have always wanted to try some offerings from AleSmith and I am glad that I have. Even though this IPA does not blow me away it is a solid offering and I hope to try some other stuff from them in the future."
"I really enjoyed this beer, and will seek it out again. Maybe my favorite DIPA/IPA (this thing is definitely testing the limits of mere IPAness) behind the Plinys."
"D - Easily drinkable and very enjoyable, very good IPA."
"D: A great IPA. Perhaps not very complex, but very well balanced and with a beautiful hop character of lemon and grapefruit. It goes down really easy and I would definitely have another if it was offered to me."
"One of my favorite IPAs, this bottle seemed to be lacking a little on the nose. It didn't taste malty, so I don't think it had anything to do with age. Will rereview the next time I have a bottle."
"D--Great beer, no real complaints. Solid across the board and worthy of its reputation"
"Dark honey amber color with a thick white and attractive head. Light fresh fruity hop nose. Nice bitter hop/grapefruit flavors with short fruit undertones. Short and a bit thin in the mouth, on flavor and in the finish. Nice but it ""comes and goes"" very quickly and is not as satisfying as it initially promises."
"Bought this beer at a local liquor store in Encinitas (Royal Liquor) in a 22oz bomber. The head of this beer was not too thick, some lacing on the glass, and the head subsided fairly quickly. The color is not quite see through, light amber. The aromas are of a typical west coast IPA, piney, not much flowery or fruity accents, just hop smells. This beer is pretty carbonated, I like the way that it evens out the beer. The IPA is bitter, has some toasty carmel malt backbone, but the aftertaste is all hops. This is textbook Cali IPA."
"Received this beer as part of a sweet package of West Coast IPAs from raoulduke37, thanks! Pours a nice orange amber color, relatively clear, with pretty good head and lacing. The nose is the most distinct pineapple aroma I've ever got from a beer. IPAs often give off vague fruity type aromas, but this one is very obviously pineapple to me. Wow. Bits of citrus and piney hops combine with the fruity pineapple to give this beer a robust, flavorful hop profile, backed by a nice sweet vanilla type malt bill. Pretty hearty, yet maintains a relatively lively mouthfeel and is quite drinkable. Wonder why we hardly ever get this beer out East while most of Alesmith's other offerings do come in... no matter, I still manage to have some in my fridge. Definitely a(nother) great west coast IPA. Textbook."
"D: Absolutely drinkable. This beer goes down so damned easy its stupid. It also doesn't have that overly bitter and acidic weight that a lot of IPAs and DIPAs tend to have. Sure the flavors could be a bit more but I am not bitching. Everything going on in here is good or better. Mostly better than good. Damned fine IPA and its nice to get these big flavors in ""just"" an IPA rather than a DIPA. It has the big aroma and flavor, but the easy drinkability and mouthfeel of that IPA. Get you some."
"22oz bottle. Clear amber with a sticky lasting head that laces. Big fruity aroma with lots of mango, some grapefruit, pine, and a little caramel. Some toasty, caramel maltiness with lots of hops over it. Almost balanced, but the hops are huge and win out with a bitter finish. Very nicely drinkable, but you can still feel the alcohol. Medium, clean palate with soft carbonation. My one hang up is that there is a slight soapy note in the finish that tastes like a weird play between the hops and alcohol. Hardly distracting, but keeps it from being a perfect IPA for me."
"D: At ~$5 a bomber, it ranges in the quality-to-quantity class of Pliny the Elder, which is my gold standard for the IPA family. I consider this an excellent value to revisit down the line."
"Drinkability: To me it's not the heralded beer folks say it is. I get this all around, honestly. That said, it's great, and I liked it all around."
"D: Here comes summer, but wait...no distribution for Alesmith, shit."
"Tough to compare to something else. Maybe a Ruination with more of a purity of hop purpose. A little less balanced than Ruination but enjoyable as hell. The booziness emerges a little more with warmth but that's OK. This is a well-oiled machine."
"It hops are definately on display but it never feels too bitter. This beer really shows how a perfectly balanced IPA is a dying art. We need more beers like this one!"
"D- Like pretty much every west coast beer I have tasted I would drink the crap out of this if like usual I could get it around here. Thank god I have FFF around here. That kind of makes up for it."
"This poured a hazy gold with white head. It smelled like lemon peel and oranges and sweet honey. It tasted like bitter lemon peel and fresh oranges, with some refined honey. It sweetened to the perfect amount as it warmed a bit. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a super clean beer, that was bitter and delicious. It had great flavor and good body. It hid the alcohol well (high for a standard IPA), and is pretty easy to drink. It's not necessarily a balanced beer, but it shouldn't be. An imperial version of this would be interesting, with possibly more depth. But for the style, this beer is in the upper echelon."
"Overall, just a really well made American IPA. Plenty of citrus hop to keep things interesting."
"Easy to drink, very nice IPA with great fresh hop charachteristics."
"""It's pretty awesome."""
"Top notch, quickly vaults into my elite IPA list."
"Dangerously easy to drink. Absolutely no idea this is 7.25%. Medium body. Somewhat creamy, very smooth. Seemingly light carbonation despite the massive head."
"Pours a golden orange color with a very nice billowy white head with good lacing. Aroma is a light caramel malt backbone with a good bit of pine and citrus hops, also get a bit of grapefruit. Flavor has some fruitiness, a touch of maltiness, and a bunch of hops mainly grapefruit and some resin. Mouthfeel is smooth with a good amount of bitterness at the end, sticks around for a while. Very good IPA and surprisingly the aging didn't deter anything from it."
"Syrupy body, dry and scathing on the tongue. Nice..."
"D: Delicious IPA. Reminds me very much of Bell's Two Hearted."
"This is a solid IPA, but it's not necessarily one of my faves."
"D - Balanced but extremely hoppy. Borders on being a IIPA, but I believe the low ABV holds it back from being so. Great beer, extremely drinkable, but rich as well."
"In my opinion, this is the king of California single IPAs. I have yet to try the famous Masala Mama, but for right now, this one is unmatched."
"Damn near perfect, second only to Masala Mama, imho."
"Serving type: 22 oz bottle."
"The mouthfeel is active, spicy from the hops, jumpy from the bubbles. I'm gonna finish the bomber, but I can feel the moderately high ABV creepin' up on me already & would say that'll have to do it. I like that this is a full IPA that doesn't wreck my palate, with some good good hops going on."
"Hops are present & accounted for. Pretty good, but there's not much of a bite, it's more balanced than I prefer. Huh. I don't have much to say. Pretty good, easy to drink, but not really noteable in any way."
"d: seriously? goes down like water"
"D- This is exactly what an IPA should be. The hops are the show here, knowing that they are damn good so there's no need for them to be pushy they simply do their job perfectly and with no fuss. Near perfect malt balance on this one as well. This is the gold standard for IPAs."
"- Rather strong and warming.. but very drinkable. A good unique and original west coast IPA."
"Would you believe I found this bottle in a 7-11 in Carlsbad right off of Interstate-5? I couldn't believe it either when I saw the bottle sitting in the fridge."
"D/O: Definitely not a session beer, and higher on the ABV scale than most IPAs, but definitely balanced, drinkable and tasty. 22 oz. servings and a bit more ooomph per bottle would probably limit me to one or two per evening before I switched it up."
"D - I could drink this forever."
"Bottle picked up at City Beer Store in San Fran. Pretty amber pour with a large and vibrant white head. Vivid orange and grapefruit nose with perhaps a hint of other fruits as well. Nice orange and malt biscuit flavor, extremely well-balanced and very tasty."
"Another world class offering from AleSmith."
"D: easy to drink, can't discern the alcohol, tastes good"
"Drinkability: Incredibly drinkable. As I'm finding with the West Coast IPAs, they aren't cloyingly bitter. A nicely balanced beer that is very drinkable at a price tag of $4.79. Worth finding and consuming. Pronto!"
"I will give this another shot. I almost hope this bottle was affected somehow that might have dulled the taste."
"Appears a dark amber with a white head and lacing. There's a pungent aroma of citrus punch. The flavor has a slightly soapy (not in a bad way) orange rind and grapefruit that quickly turns into a ripping hop bitterness with dirty pepper and light floral perfume. The aftertaste is long and big with more of the biting rind. Basically, they've crammed the flavor, and to an extent, the feel of a DIPA in an IPA. The bitterness is a little dialed back by comparison, but this is a full, delicious beer."
"Left some nice foam sheeting inside the snifter in which it was served. Classic American IPA."
"9/4/8/4/15 (4.0/5)"
"Combine, price, complexity, availability..for me in CA... drinkability, goes with lots of food, subtle, and so aromatically complex this is a near perfect brew. One of the 1st craft beers to start my path down the real beers being brewed journey. Forgot about this beer and dismissed it for a year or 2, just rediscovered it again recently and have always kept at least 1 in the fridge ready at all times. Stunning!"
"This beer is pretty available for me, ill be visiting it again."
"D - This is a wonderfully balanced West Coast IPA with plenty of flavor to back it up. This is definitely up there with the best of them. Alesmith IPA is dangerously drinkable! I will be searching out more Alesmith brews when I visit California this summer for sure."
"The hops bill in this IPA is fantastic; I just love the citric juiciness of it all. A big, balanced, and solid American IPA. This immediately jumped to my top 10--maybe even top 5--of my favorite IPAs. Good stuff!"
"Alcohol is felt but not enough to ruin the experience. The beer is delicious and enjoyable with a good balance of texture and carbonation. The overall experience of this beer is extremely enjoyable and I would love to sit down and go through a couple of these."
"Memorable Qualities: This is an exceptionally well crated IPA that satisfies my hop cravings in the nose and on the tongue, while not blasting my face off. Definitely in the west coast style, I think this stands with Blind Pig at the top of the style."
"Overall: Very good, nicely balanced between sweetness and bitterness. Different order of things in the flavor, with the sweetness up front and the hop bitterness following. Quite enjoyable!"
"Overall- This is a nice change form the hop bombs that focus on only citrus or only pine notes, this beer has it all pine, floral and citrus plus a good malt backbone."
"This is a fantastic IPA. Great west coast hop profile. I hope I can try this one again soon."
"Drinkability - As usual Alesmith shows everyone how it's done. This is THE Aerican IPA! Don't bother seeking others, just submit to its power."
"Overall this is quite tasty. Alesmith does well in everything they brew and this is truly a west coast treat of an ipa."
"Drinkability, another winner that I can't regularly get. I am moving to California. No problem finishing the bomber."
"Wow. Excellent beer. I was trying to pick a solid beer for my 200th, and I went with an IPA, instead of a fancier style, in order to save something grander for number 250. However, this is a fabulous IPA. The beer looks great, sticky head, perfect amber-gold color for an IPA. The aroma is very clean. Hops are citric, floral and piney. Caramel malt is present and well-articulated. The flavor is exceptional, even in this highly competitive category. Alesmith knows how to use hops. The hop flavor is perfectly clean. There is some bitterness, but it's extremely pleasant and doesn't scald in the least. The malt is strong enough to bring out the flavors of the hops, without being cloying in the least. It's just extremely smooth. The citrus and floral hops balance very, very well with the malt. The mouthfeel is excellent, but there is a tiny bit of alcohol around the edges. The beer is exceptionally easy to drink. Alesmith makes great beer, and this is definitely one of them. My one qualm with this beer is that it is extremely close to being a DIPA rather than an IPA. I like for styles to be loose and allow innovation, but I almost wish that there was a hard and fast line for this division."
"D - This is a very easy drinking beer and tastes like a lower ABV beer than it really is."
"This is perhaps the best-tasting IPA I have come across (and I've had quite a few). An absolutely delicious balance of honey & crystal malts backed by tons of juicy, floral, citric, and resinous hops. The aftertaste lingers for just the right amount of time and packs a potent bitterness level, while the medium body is perfectly carbonated thanks to the bottle conditioning. This has easily become one of my all-time favorite IPA's, and I cannot wait to try it again further down the road."
"Mouthfeel was excellent. Smooth, crisp and hoppy. Same with drinkability. I could drink this one until the abv caught up with me. Very nice, one of the better IPAs out there."
"Shaker pint glass. Large foamy off white head. Almost flat. Slightly hazy amber color. Aroma is citric, hoppy, sweet. Starts with some grapefruit citrus, earthiness. Good maltiness throughout with the aftertaste becoming more bitter. Ethanol is fairly mild."
"D - Definitely noteworty as a session beer...""Keep it comin' all night long."""
"I could drink a bottle or two of this on occasion, not something I would drink night in and night out."
"its got all the hop flavors that I look for in an IPA. Solid hops with a plethora of hoppy flavors that last end coat the palate. smooth, big, balanced, delicious, with a light enough body that makes it go down way to easy."
"I'd love to try this on-tap or closer to the source. It's not in the same class to me as my two favorite Minneapolis IPAs, but that may be because of the freshness factor. I wish Alesmith (and Stone for that matter) would date their bottles."
"D - Man this beer is delicious. This IPA is in my top 3. No way this is 7.25 ABV, I'm going to session this one and we'll see what happens. :)"
"Drinkability: This is decent, but a big disappointment after the shining star that is Alesmith Celebration Ale"
"Well worth your time."
"To me this is a completely different IPA, one with depth. The pours is clear and golden bronze in color. An nice 3 finger white, fluffy head then appears and will stick around with ya until your glass is empty. Each sip you take leaves a nice lace ring along the glass. The smell is of fresh hops that had an incredibley floral smell to them. One of the most unique smelling IPA's I've ever had. A touch of pine and citrus in there as well, for the record. The taste was suprisingly balanced. This isnt a hop-bomb by any means. A wonderful caramel malt backbone with a citric hop kick. Stong flavors of citrus here, espeically pineapple. Overall its pretty mellow for IPA standards but it will leave a nice bitter aftertaste in your mouth, dont be fooled. A medium bodied beer with an oily, bitter aftertaste left behind. Given the higher ABV, which isnt noticeable, I'm giving this a 5 on drinkablitiy. The taste is so well balanced and unique I kept wanting to go back for more. A beer very deserving of its high reviews."
"Finishes dry and quite bitter. Kind of thin in the body but oily on the teeth and toungue. Bitter for the style which I really love. A wonderful example of the style. Simply delectable."
"A classic."
"D: very drinkable brew, and a great example of style. amazingly fresh."
"Another terrific West Coast IPA. Have to put this one right up their with Green Flash. Right now I am kicking myself for only purchasing one of these when I had the chance."
"I'd be happy to have easy access to this beer."
"I could drink this beer all day and was tempted to do just that (expect that Hamilton's had many other things to entice my palate this day). The beer is medium bodied and is about as drinkable as a 7.25% abv. IPA can get. This is great stuff."
"I'm going to spare the editorial on this one, many other reviewers have put it much better than I ever could. Simply put, this beer deserves it's spot on the top 10 for style. The intensity of hop flavor captured in this beer is not something you get to taste every day."
"D: This is another example of an IPA I wish I could get with regularity. Wonderful taste with a double IPA taste in a single IPA."
"Hopefully, they'll distribute in NC soon!"
"i would sit in a bathtub of this if it wasnt a waste of a great beer. i dont know why this isnt higher up on the top 100. i think if it was harder to get (yearly release) this would be on the top ten easily. get it and drink it. you wont be sorry."
"Pours clear gold with a frothy white head. Strong grapefruit in the nose. A slap of resin and grapefruit in the taste, followed by caramel malt and a bit of sweet yeast from the bottom. Very refreshing and sweeter than others in its ilk (Stone, for example). Lively mouthfeel. A reliable, strong IPA."
"The body is a bit sweet for style. Some astringency from the hops. The carbonation is a bit much but adds complexity to the bitterness. Overall a good example of a west cost IPA."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and almost chewy in feel. Very easy drinking. Light crispness."
"Notes: This is a very good interpretation of the style. The brewers at AleSmith definitely know what they're doing. They've managed to craft an IPA that tastes very clean. It's mighty easy to drink, smooth on the palate, throat, and esophagus (not to mention the stomach), and is quite refreshing. Every corner of this flavor profile is nicely hemmed up with clean and tight edges that really work for this particular brew. Very solid! Just not anything that really stands out as being completely unique and mind-blowing to this beer. But, recommended for sure to someone who likes IPA's."
"M/D - quite a beer from an amazing brewery. This is my first IPA and hopefully won't be my last."
"Good complex IPA."
"This beer pours a very light amber, semi cloudy with a 2 fingered white head and tons of lacing. The smell is awesome, nice fruity/citrusy hops, big strong and in your face. The taste is very nicely balanced, it has a nice malt base, and that wonderful hops flavor from the nose. I get some ruby red grapeftuit juice flavor and its all perfectly balanced. The mouthfeel is very nice with a good carbonation level. I wish this was available around here, this would be a daily beer for me."
"D: Lots of bitterness going on here, but a really nice IPA. Drinkability is fairly good, though I'm not sure you'd want to pound these back one after another. This has nothing on Pliny's smoothness IMHO, which has a tad higher ABV."
"Notes from 12/11/04"
"I want to start off by saying that i absolutely love the simplicity and the power of the bottle design. The Alesmith IPA pours a chill hazed orange brown color with a huge white ""donut pillow"" of a white head, im not sure if they planned to have the head cave in but god damn does it intensify the nose! The aroma of tons of fresh semi sweet hops fill the glass. The taste is much the same, smooth and very well balanced lots of strong pungent fresh hops battle in the mouth, good peppery spice esters emanate from the beers flavor as well as a solid biscuity yeast character from the bottle conditioning. Slightly woody with notes of maple syrup and brown sugar. Grapefruit blasts sneak in more and more as the bottle gets lower. Medium bodied and very good drinkability, this beer is an absolute winner!"
"Pours a soft golden yellow color, fizzy. Huge head, very lasting w/big bubbles & good lacing. Very piney aroma, some nuttiness present too. Very sweet smelling, almost like a candy. Soft fizzy mouthfeel. Piney hops & some malt. Bittery good but not too caustic. Warming up, drier, less bitter & hoppy."
"A solid American IPA and bottle conditioned too! Glad I got to try this one."
"I'm torn on drinkability. It's an EXCELLENT IPA. One that I could easily have a few of, but with the semi-high ABV, it would catch up real quick."
"This beer rocks that bitch up and down the coast."
"Overall a very good representative West Coast IPA. If you like hops, you'll like this one. I like this better than the Port IPA/DIPAs. It just tastes cleaner. The hops seem more in balance with the sweetness of the malt. Less palate blowing (although still harsh)"
"D: This is top notch for an aipa. So if thats your style I'm sure you have plenty in the fridge like I do! Cheers Alesmith (how do I join the cult?)"
"oured from the 22 oz bottle into a sam perfect pint. Pours a hazy orange with a huge pillowy head. Smell is a bit faint for what I was expecting. Some pine, but mostly bready malt. I get the feeling this is not the freshest Alesmith IPA. Taste is similar. Lots of caramel type malts, not enough hop slam for my taste. Very drinkable. Still a good beer, but with the recent onslaught of fresh CA ipa's - this one is average for me."
"D- Usually, I don't like to open bombers alone. On a whim, I grabbed this one out of the fridge and I can honestly say this is one of the best IPA's I have ever had. Excellent representation of the style and an easy drinking beer. Kudos to Alesmith for crafting such a wonderful brew. This is now one of my favorites of all time."
"D- With almost no bitterness and well-hidden alcohol, this 7.25% IPA is about as drinkable as it gets."
"Wow. This beer was a pleasure to try. Smooth the whole way through. All I was expecting and then some."
"Overall, I was really impressed. I love IPAs, and this is definitely at the top of my list. Definitely worth the long trip to buy this beer!"
"Overall a very very nice IPA, super sessionable and full of great flavor. Excellently drinkable, and smooth. I would mind thinning this one out a bit, but other than that this is a staple example of what a good west coast IPA should be. Great representation of the style. Good IPA, hopheads will enjoy. Good beer."
"Overall this is a really excellent beer. Up there with the WIPEOUT IPA in my estimation (one of my all-time favs). More or less what an IPA should be."
"This IPA is far and out one of the best that I have ever tasted. So far the only thing that beats this out for me is the Vishnu's Vice IPA from Flossmoor Station. It makes me sad that that was a one-off batch but I am happy that this gem is regular production. Oh wait I'm even more saddened now that I remember I can't get this around here. AleSmith please find your way to Indiana."
"Pours a clear coppery/orange color, sturdy two-finger tan head is very slow to fade, and leaves lots of sticky lacing in the glass. Lots of citrus and pine aromas, with a very sticky sweet caramel malty background. Some juicy grapefruit flavors, sticky piney hops, nice bitterness, and very nicely balanced with the sweet malt. Very active tiny little bubbles on this one, gentle lingering bitterness. Drinkability is outrageous on this one....wish I had greater access to this beer."
"M&D: Goes down smooth and finishes without a harsh alcohol aftertaste despite it's high ABV%."
"Note: Bottle labeled as 7.25% vs. 7.75% shown on kegs and on website? This is a 'different' beer and a rare occasion whereby I would recommend the tap over the bottle."
"Revised ; got to try this again, and it was quite tasty."
"Drinkability: Argh. I kept trying to knock this beer in certain places, but I really, really couldn't. It's just a really great overall IPA. The abv% is a little up there for your traditional American IPA, but that's alright, 'cause it wasn't anywhere to be found, and no American IPA is really going to knock you on your butt. Regardless, this is a world class American IPA, likely the best I've ever had."
"Aroma is hoppy with fresh pine and orange citrus. Pours amber orange with rocky off-white head. Flavor begins with nice citrus/pine and finishes with a nice dry hoppy throat. There is a nice balance between the hops and the malt (for an IPA). Nice finish of toasty and carmel malt. A very good American IPA."
"D-I could and would drink this one all night."
"T: Very nice balance of rich malt body with biting hop presence. Active carbonation with a medium body and a lingering slightly sweet citrus hop taste. Body of the beer is a very strong caramel malt taste with piney and citrus hops that assert themselves immediately, though not a ""hop bomb", at least to me. Very well balanced and very drinkable. Alcohol begins to assert itself as the bottle goes finishes. An excellent IPA, though I still prefer Two Hearted. My feelings for this beer don't seem to exactly mesh with some of the other recent reviews, as far as hop presence and body go, so next time I'm in CA I'd love to try this fresh as this bottle came from Akron, OH and well, Ohio is Ohio (hey, it's the start of college football, I can be antagonistic if I want)"
"Drinkability: This drank very well. I've been wanting to try it again ever since I first laid lips on it over a year ago. This beer did not disappoint, and may be my favorite American IPA. Drinks similar to a mild I2PA and is also quite dry. Very delicious, but not necessarily ""easy""."
"drinkability: high"
"Overall: an absolutely great friggin' beer"
"Mouthfeel is clean and sharp, but goes down smoothly."
"very drinkable for its 7.2 abv, some alcohal is detected but like I said its fun to drink."
"Poured into my Surly pint glass. Pours a light amber, with a gorgeous head that has amazing retention. Smells very nice...malty sweetness, but can definately pick up the hops in there. Tastes delicious...very nice IPA. I usually like my IPAs more hoppy, but this is very good. Has a nice, sticky lacing as well. A very nice offering from Alesmith. I can't wait to get my hands on their other offerings!"
"Overall, AleSmith IPA stands up to just about any other IPA out there. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on a bottle."
"D- A great tasting brew that is so easy to drink."
"Solid bitterness, but no alcohol appearances; it is as good as Dreadnaught, with a little less alcohol, and not even a double IPA. Impressive."
"Pretty darn good beer at a very reasonable rate. I like the amber color and the good sized head produced in the glass. Remnants of the yeast from the bottle conditioning is left in the bottle and some falls into the glass. This beer is hoppy without overdoing it. It is definitely a beer that will go well with food and not be overly filling. I didn't find this to be quite as bitter or floral as other IPA's that I've had, but I don't mean that as a criticism. This beer is definitely approachable and friendly."
"I ended up with yet another bottle of this brew and decided it was time to rate it this time. This IPA is one of the better ones I've had. It pours slightly darker than golden, but with a slight haze (probably because of the bottle-conditioning), and with a minimal head...but one that persists until the last drop. I would call it attractive. The aroma is good with some nice hops, yet there's a bit of something else (slightly tart/almost stinky) I'm not a huge fan of. I've had the same thing in some other beers too, and I don't think it's a flaw. I guess it's just some characteristic from ingredients and/or the brewing process I don't find especially pleasing. I do like the flavor more than the aroma. A clean, malty flavor provides the basic background for the hops to shine. I'm guessing there's a mix of hops used here...quite possibly some various C-hops. The finish is fairly dry with a lingering hop flavor and bitterness. Right now, I'm being reminded of Bear Republic's Racer 5 (which I also like...especially fresh on tap.) In the end, I recommend Alesmith IPA and wish it and the rest of Alesmith's lineup were available back here in the SE."
"Drinkability - This IPA reminds me of many IIPA's I drink although smoother. Very easy going and could even be a session IPA (if you love your hops!). The alcohol was well hidden although it will creep up on you."
"This is tastier than many IIPAs as far as hop character goes. Of any brew that is called a standard IPA, this is my favorite. Is San Diego style IPA an official style yet?"
"A rocky bubbled three finger off white head easily creeps to the top edge of the glass. All kinds of lace is left as it fades. Body is a very nice amber orange in color. The hops on the nose are really big and meaty with tones of pickled beef, pine, and dandilions. With first sip you get a distinct balance of crisp grassy hops and mineral based malt. This beer has a very woodsy feel to it with raw oakey tones. Lengthy bitter feel on the back of the tongue is very piney based. Minerals are spread throughout by the malt. Alchol is nowhere in the taste but it warms the belly well for 7.25%. Mouthfeel is a clean sweet bitter thickness. Very nicely drinkable."
"Overall just another reason to go and visit San Diego. It was more malty that what I am used to but an excellent performance."
"T,M&D: This is one of my favorite IPA's in the workd for smoothness and drinkibility, at 7.25% it is not overly strong but you know the alcohol is there. Steller IPA and I will continue to buy this beer."
"Overall- Great hoppy beer. For those that really enjoy hoppy they'll enjoy this one."
"D - Excellent for a bold hoppy IPA."
"This beer is powerful and strong yet very refreshing and easy to drink. I recomend this beer to any IPA lover."
"In terms of drinkability, at 7.25% this delicious and exceptionally well-made beer is not something you could knock back all night, but that's clearly not the idea. This is an excellent beer to be enjoyed with some spicy Thai food or sipped on its own by those who cherish well-crafted IPAs."
"I can't pick a favorite IPA, it's like picking a favorite kid, but for today this is it. I know I am gushing over this, but it is that good. I would love more of this beer. If I were out west this would be a fridge staple."
"Pours a really deep golden with a fluffy white head. Nose is heavy on pine with a malty backbone. Taste is very good, not quite stone, though. Pretty smooth and refreshing. I little overbittered perhaps, but still a nice and piney/sweet IPA. Top notch!"
"Anyone else want to trade for some of this? Just let me know. This beer was fantastic."
"Drinkability- The other night (a week ago actually) I had a Sculpin IPA and although it was decent, I was expecting a lot more. Turns out what I was expecting was AleSmith IPA. This is a terrific beer that although I wouldn't describe as balanced, it's not over the top and has that terrifically fruity hoppiness that I enjoy. Big thanks to Matt for his generosity!"
"D: A fine drink from AleSmith. The dynamic taste made this drink disappear faster and faster from my glass. A very good IPA overall and would definitely have again."
"The individual components speak to great quality, but it's the seemingly effortless balance it achieves that steps out and wows the senses. It doesn't strive for complexity but rather for blissful blending. The ABV is a non-issue despite a buzz of warmth, because this drinks dreamily as a matter of course. This one will never spend much time in my DBF. I get it, I drink it, I love it. Talk about a simple equation."
"A very nice IPA. not my favorite but on my short list. I would buy more of this if readily available."
"Overall, this might be my favorite IPA."
"This is such a good, well rounded IPA. Highly recommended. I need to try more AleSmith beers now."
"This is a great representation of what San Diego has to offer. A delicious flavor profile mixed with one fantastic drinkable package. I would love for this to be my go to IPA. Great stuff!"
"All in all a fine example of the American IPA. Certainly not a session beer but easy to drink."
"Excellent example of an IPA, I finished the bomber and still could've had more."
"Drinkability is moderate. Relatively high alcohol limits consumption as well as subpar flavors."
"drinkability is great. this is one top notch ipa - and that's saying a lot with the number out there. perfectly balanced. great malt depth. interesting hop presence. it'd be drinking this all the time were it available locally."
"Best IPA in the world or at least the best that I've ever had.."
"Notes: Huge thanks to urwatuh8 for including this in a recent trade as an extra. I've been on an IPA kick lately and this one really hit the spot. If it were available to me I'd pick this up a lot."
"D: a very unique IPA in my opinion, strong and complex, but still totally drinkable"
"D: One of the more drinkable IPAs out there and a solid example of a West Coast IPA. This is about as big as you can get without getting into DIPA territory. Another great beer from the folks at AleSmith who rarely disappoint."
"Dark gold with a almost off-white head. Aromas of citrus and melons and a little sweet malt. Tastes like tangerine and cantaloupe with a little children's chewable aspirin. Full body. Flowery, fruity hops overall. Finishes with some bitter hop. Totally pushes the IPA into Imperial IPA territory, but it's all relative I suppose. Big Ups to Tim Drhuhggs and his sister for making this beer happen for me. Totally worthy."
"In summary, simply one of the best American IPA,s out there"
"A nice american IPA- I may have preferred a slight more aggressive hop AND malt profile, but that's kinda overkill I suppose for the style. The long bittering, but not overpowering, hop finish is really enjoyable, and definitely highlights the flavors present."
"Deep golden/copper in color this poured a big head of small bubbles that stayed tight. The nose was filled with grapefruit followed by some piney hops and a bit of caramel coated malt balls. In the mouth these flavors continued into a balanced midpalate of medium density. The finish showed off the bitterness though through the midpalate it was well-balanced with sweet malt."
"A little to carbonated for my taste, and I'd recommendend not to serve this one to cold."
"Shared the 22 oz., but could easily enjoy one or two at a time. That will be a personal goal of mine, an afternoon with Alesmith IPA..."
"Overall, this is a very impressive brew. Very, very drinkable. Nicely balanced and tremendous flavor."
"D: One of the best IPAs out there ... great work alesmith!"
"great great great ipa. being an east coast native, i expected this one to be overly hopped and unbalanced, following the stereotype of west coast ipa. boy, was i wrong. georgeous dark golden color with a frothy white head that wouldn't go away. nose and taste exhibited extremely well balanced hop profile riding on a nice malt backbone with just enough bitter in the finish. medium full body that just begged to be enjoyed again and again and again. these guys make me want to give up and move as close as possible to the alesmith brewery so i can do nothing but be an alesmith lab rat. much respect to the alesmith team."
"This is a very good beer!!!! One of my favorite IPA's. The appearance was a very gold/copper color and clean for the most part. The smell was very hoppy, sooo good!!! The taste was also extremely awesome, leaving me with a citrus like taste. Mouthfeel was also very clean. Easy to drink...I highly recommend this beer."
"Great IPA, and probably in my top ten for the style. To have a screaming fresh pitcher would be bliss."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a Sam Adams pint glass. Poured a light copper color, with a good sized white head that stuck around for a while and left a good coating on the glass. The smell was caramel, apricots and flowery hops. The taste was caramel balanced by a wonderful flowery, citrusy hop flavor balancing it out wonderfully. This is one of my favorite IPAs, if not my favorite. A beer I would highly recommend."
"D: Excellent. I'd never be able to tell this one had any alcohol in it. I'd drink it all night long."
"Amber pour with a huge white meringue like sticky and lasting head. Smell is sweet fruity hops at first, with some citrusy notes and then hops turn more earthy. Taste is a quite sharp hoppy bitterness and flavor. Some light sweetness, but I personally would like to see just a touch more to balance out the big hops. After pouring the end of the bomber, it clouds up and is a nice hazy amber, and the body seemed to thicken up a bit. The alcohol is well hidden, and although this isn't one of my top 2 or 3 favorite IPAs it's still quite good, strong in hop flavor, and one worth trying."
"D- sweet times"
"What can you say, it is a very nice, floral beer. Not balanced, but maybe unintended to be that way. Great looking beer and is very sticky on the nose. Hops dominate the beer, and unsure, but I would say it's pushing or over 100 IBU's. A little rough on the edges going down, very sharp hoppy bitterness. A very good brew, but there are others out there, as good, if not better, that are not $9 a bomber. Good to try to say I had it once, but I'll stick with Stone."
"A very full IPA, well balanced in flavor and feel. Overall character leaves me satisfied without needing to drink a lot more, although, I definitely could drink this a lot."
"d-- not over the top -- well balanced and refined."
"For shame on me for not getting some for such a long time. It's truly worth the effort to get it *any* way you can because this IPA, imo, is a world class example of the style."
"Pours a clear amber with a nice creme head that leaves a fair amount of lace on the way down. Nose is citrus, perfume and pine. It's nothing crazy, but is is extremely well balanced. Flavor is almost unnecessary to elaborate on. Nice pine levels with a tangy fruit tone. I mean this really just can't go anywhere else. Just frickin' smooth. Slightly noticeable tone of alcohol kicks it down just ever so slightly when it's at the wrong temperature. Just has to be chilled ever so properly. Leaves a nice burn in my chest as I sip. Consider it more of a warm fuzzy feeling. Feel has a very good liquid touch and the carbonation is nice as well. This is an IPA and a masterful piece of work that should be sought out by all. Truly amazing."
"D - This really is a great beer, I see no reason why I couldn't keep drinking it. It's a nice, strong, balanced IPA."
"This one really deserves the ratings. Outstanding beer experience."
"Medium bodied with a bitter but sweet aftertaste that keeps me coming back for more. An excellent and well balanced brew, which will be a staple for me from now on."
"Floral hop aroma with lots of malt and rich crystal malt notes. Golden/orange color with lasting rocky off-white head. Floral/citric hops are main flavor component with good malt balance and slight daicetyl detectable. Creamy mouthfeel. Somewhat sticky finish with a lingering bitter/hoppy aftertaste. Excellent."
"The body was thin and carbonated which goes along with what I've been saying. It was drinkable but in the sense that you have one while your watching football or grilling in the back yard."
"I did not like the AleSmith Speedway Stout, although I respected it. I was worried that this would be similar. It was similarly interesting, but unsimilarly approachable. This beer wins."
"D- My favorite IPA"
"Thanks again to srroos, for hooking me up with a great beer I cannot get here in Texas."
"D - Alcohol will certainly creep up, so don't forget about that. Would love to see this in 12 oz bottles - it would be much more drinkable in the smaller size. Overall though, wonderful."
"Really nice mouthfeel and really good finish. Very easy to drink. Really good beer. I'm glad I listened to the bar tender on this one."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, good kick, very good representation of style. This is a very good beer to drink over the course of an evening. I could see myself polishing off a 2-3 bombers of this beer and enjoying them the whole time."
" not the most distinctive IPA, but relatively drinkable, probably wouldn't buy again"
"This isn't a bad IPA, but it's over rated if you ask me."
"Taste was the same pink grapefruit from the aroma. Quite zesty in the mouth with a bitter hop finish. Hops were definitely there but not overpowering. Very enjoyable and classic example of a San Diego IPA."
"One of the best examples of an American IPA."
"Prosit, MK"
"D- Very nice. Got this beer on my last trip to SD and wish that I could have it more often. The beer has a good rep and it is easy to see why."
"This is a must try and Ill be packing a few of these for the flight back. In terms of a single IPA, this one is right there with the two hearted in my opinion as versions that I cant get back home but would love to have on a daily basis."
"Truly one of the best IPAs on the market. This is an excellent benchmark IPA by which to judge others."
"Wonderful aroma with a hoppy, yet complex and balanced taste and oh so smooth...This is one of the best IPA's I've had, if not the best! Awesome hop profile and usage."
"D: Awesome. I am a huge fan of Alesmith."
"Great IPA. Not sure I would go so far as to say it's an Imperial/Double as it is very drinkable and doesn't kill your palate. A MUST for anyone who likes IPA's and Hops. Not as piney as Stone IPA, but definitely a quality competitor if not better than my favorite (former favorite?) ."
"D- This is a monumentally drinkable IPA. I shared the bomber with my dad but could have easily had the whole thing to myself."
"An above average West Coast IPA. Drinkability is sickly easy for such a bitter hop bomb...be carefull! HA!"
"Well this is just as I remember it from a month ago. I guess my biggest mistake was only bringing back 1 bottle for myself and giving away the rest. I'm sure my friends are appreciative of such a fantastic gift though."
"Mouthfeel is big and creamy for an IPA. Luckily a plethora of flavors abound to make use of the malty medium. An outstanding IPA all the way around."
"Props to rye726 for letting me split a liqourama order with him. Between the abv & the grapefruit profile, I doubt I could stay on this all night, but wouldn't mind giving it a shot!"
"Great West Coast IPA. Pours a dark golden orange with a healthy tight head and some decent lacing. Aromas of citrus and spicy hops. Great grapefruit presence in the nose. The taste is beautifully balanced with nice citrusy hops and spicy notes and a long grapeffruit bitterness in the finish. Subtle malt underpins it all. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth. Just an all around pleasure to drink. This would be a staple if it were available in my area."
"M/D: Smooth and velvety, just like the bottle says. A light to medium body. Carbonation is a tad high, but the beer so damn near perfect. Drinkability is almost perfect as well. The 7.25% isn't that high and I could see my self drinking this all night. This is almost certainly the best AIPA I have every had."
"This beer is nothing short of amazing. Find it, and hoard it."
"Not my favorite IPA, but that's because I like a lot of grapefruity flavor. Certainly a top notch IPA though."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a golden orange color with an inch frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. Aroma is mainly citrusy (grapefruit) hops, along with some lemon peel, caramel malt and pine. Taste is mainly citrus and piney hops, and there's some caramel malt noticable too. Hoppy bitter finish lingers around for a little while. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, and a bit sticky. Carbonation is between moderate and high (but closer to moderate), it has a nice zippy feeling. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and enjoyable to drink. Overall I think this is a pretty good IPA."
"Now this is an IPA. Pours a deep gold color, with a one finger head and lacing all the way down. Smells of citrus, grapefruit, hops, yum. Tastes of citrus and hops, but not as overwhelming as a strong IIPA like Ruination. A bit more bitterness than citrus, not exactly the ratio I'd prefer. A pretty strong amount of carbonation with a bitter finish. This goes down easy. First rate!"
"D - Not bad but would like to have a west coast IPA with more of a hop forward profile and not malt forward....maybe the bottle was not treated well?"
"An exceptional looking IPA. Steady carbonation, a deep amber that gets murky on the second pour. Huge head with great retention and lacing all down the glass. Quite a looker. Smell is very fresh and inviting, not quite like the Yulesmith but pretty close. Sweet grapefruit and hints of tangerine with some piney hops also present. A light caramel malt background rounds it out. Taste is also pretty citrus fruit oriented. Grapefruit is the main culprit and there is less of a malt background here. Not a stand out but solid for sure. Mouthfeel is nice and bitter, almost resinous. Bigger than most IPA's with lively carbonation on the tongue and a slightly dry finish. Overall good drinkability. I truly enjoyed this beer and owe thanks to flexabull for the trade."
"Overall- Very good, albeit fruity as hell!"
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ copper color with an off white head. Aromas of citrusy/ grapefruity hops. As well as in the taste, big grapefrutiy hops. A full bodied, bitter mouthfeel, with a clean, small hop presence in the aftertaste. Big hops all aroung, and a clean aftertaste, probably of the better IPAs I have ever had."
"this one...clear and a much lighter color with less lacing. good smell but less intense. same with the flavor...much less after taste."
"Thanks a bunch to Ryan for the chance to sample this beauty."
"Been looking forward to this one for a while, so I was naturally thrilled when I finally received a bottle in trade. Waiting around for a while but finally had to crack it open last night. Poured a very nice hazy amber with a nice thick and sticky three inches or more of head on top. The retention was fantastic and even when it finally did calm down some it still left behind lace that was so thick you could not even see the contents of the glass. Lots of carbonation was visible inside from the very beginning and the also a lot of sediment residing inside both the bottle and the glass. Smell was obnoxiously hopped with huge floral aromas of pine, orange, and grapefruit. A slightly sweet base was apparent, but totally overwhelmed by the hops. The taste was just absurd, such a good thick IPA.. Huge floral hop taste that was just sticky it tasted so fresh. A really huge hop presence with a ton of pine flavors and lots of sweet orange mixed in. Great medium body with a huge bitter dry and sticky finish. Great carbonation through out never let you down. This was just awesome and the bottle went in no time. No hint of the ABV at all which was very nice. Overall this was one of the best IPAs I have had, with definitely a west coast flavor to it. This is definitely a brew to be reckoned with and came off more of a double to me then anything else. But none the less it was fantastic and really a great experience. I will definitely be looking for more of this, and you should be too."
"22 oz bottle, lots of yeast left in the bottle. Pours a orange, light amber. Lots of head, 2 cm at a time, white to slightly off white, long lasting. Aroma is sweet and strong with citrus, hint of pine. Initial taste is mostly overwhelmed by the sweetness, turning citrusy, then very dry from all the hops. There might be other components in there, but honestly when you dump that much hop-action in there, forget it. Aftertaste is very hoppy and long lasting. Light to medium body, very light carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden and drinkable. For the price I'd prefer something else, but maybe worth another drink down the line."
"Mouthfeel is really quite fantastic, there is a velvetly smooth texure to this beer, finishes with some creamy rosins. Highly drinkable IPA that is near the top of my short list for IPAs currently."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, ALL foam. We're talking some serious wait time for bubble fade. Super bubbly head fades slowly, with large puffy lace chunks over the cloudy golden amber brew. Aroma is pine and grapefruit hops. Taste is moderately sweet maltiness upfront, with plenty of hops on the tail end, but nothing overpowering, which is cool. Mouthfeel is somewhat bubbly, but still smooth, and drinking is nice. Wish this was more accessible around here."
"Final Note: I think this is a pretty close to perfect beer."
"Slick mouth coating syrupy mouthfeel but then finishes a bit dry. A very interesting IPA."
"D: Very complex IPA that drinks easily. There are other cheaper and readily available IPAs in the area so I probably won't get this again unless I'm further out west. Good nonetheless."
"D: A fantastic IPA. If this beer existed in a cheaper, less alcoholic form, I doubt I would drink much else."
"D- This is a great IPA. Drinkable and good all around. Something I will have again. ABV is undetectable in this brew. Though the bitterness is definitely present it is kept in balance with the hop flavor-which is what this IPA is all about. I look forward to trying other offerings from AleSmith."
"One of my favorite IPAs."
"Growler filled at the brewery. The first pour is great, and the pint just as delicious as it is straight from the tap. This beer kept well over the 2 days it lasted, perhaps a little better than the growler of Speedway kept. The malt was a little understated for the last pour but that signature delicious tropical smell and quintessential hop smack were alive and well."
"A golden color with touches of amber along the sides of the glass, with a two inch off white colored head sits atop. A strong floral, earthy, and citrusy scent overwhelms the nose, then a slight mild scentof malt comes through. The taste starts with citrus and grassy flavors encircles the palate from front to back, surrounding a mild malty flavor in the middle. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy at the front the front, then thins out at the back. This beer is a hopheads delight, strong hoppy aroma and flavor, though more malt in the flavor and a more even mouthfeel would make this more drinkable."
"Would definitely have again"
"This beer pours a golden color, with a thick white frothy pale head. The hops are intense with a beautiful floral component. The flavor of carapils and pale malts nearly offsets the hop bitterness, but instead creates a foundation for a truely great flavor. I wish that I could create the high alpha acid aroma that this brewer has perfected in this bottle. It's awesome. It goes down so damn smooth. This is near perfect as an IPA is concerned. The mouthfeel is great. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a kick ass IPA. It's got malt complexity. It's got hop character. This is a highly drinkable beer period."
"Very good, recommended"
"Overall I can see myself knocking back a few of these."
"Nice having it from a growler; it's a very enjoyable beer, maybe a bit on the sweet side a bit too much (taste-wise), but nevertheless a nice offering from AleSmith. I prefer their Summer YuleSmith Double IPA, but this will have to do during the rest of the year."
"Very drinkable and nicely done."
"**edit - after letting the beer warm a bit - much better**"
"What a damn fine IPA. Poured darker amber with a great billowing sticky head. Settled down and the aromas were flowing- great earthy hops and cool, almost roasted malts. The complex flavors were abundant and very satisfying- big, in your face hop bitterness with a lot of piney, but not resinous flavor. Malts were surprisingly well represented and gave the brew a nice smooth sweetness and kept the hops at bay. The finish was the best part by far- huge hop flavor without the IBU explosion and lasting bitterness. Reminds me of a more refined Brooklyn IPA, and very well done- highly recommended."
"Pours a cloudy copper with a gynormous frothy head that lasts forever. Laces throughout the entire beer and looks delicious. Smells are abundant. Hoppy but not a slap in the face. Sweet malt, caramel, fruit, rind, pine. Tastes exactly as it smells, exquisite and complex, all covered in hops. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with low carbonation. A session beer for sure. Love how this is an obvious IPA but is so complex and different at the same time. A classic."
"If this is what AleSmith has to offer I can't wait to try the other 3 have in the cellar. I just with they were easier to get around here."
"D: Drinkability is lowered due to the high alcohol effect. Not a bad beer, I've had this beer several times and it just hasn't impressed me. Which is weird since I've loved the other offerings from Alesmith that I have had, most notably Yulesmith (Both Summer and Winter), and Speedway. The first couple of times that I had had it were bad batches, with almost no carbonation, so I discounted my opinion, and would try again. I've had it about 3 other times since then, including the review beer, and aside from the appearance, it just doesn't do it for me. Go figure, though I recommend, however, that any IPA fan try it, if they can get it, it is certainly well made, just not for me."
"Carbonation is high and very enjoyable."
"Bravo AleSmith.... this one ranks right up there with your Speedway and YuleSmith and is deserving of its TOP 100 ranking. I can't wait to try more AleSmith brews... BAers bring on the trades."
"Although I appreciated many of the more ""extreme"" aspects of this beer, I wish there was a bit more balance to counteract the intense bitterness."
"D=Excellent. Very balanced, with a nice full maltiness that balances the hoppy nature of this beer."
"Medium to full in body, with a dry full finish of lingering bitterness. Alcohol makes its first appearance here, although it could be argued that the spicy bitterness betrays a higher alcohol content than many/most Am. IPAs. Either way, it lets you know you're drinking a powerhouse, an incredibly tasty IPA that, even if not quite 'balanced', steps right up to the line of a double IPA - maybe sticks a toe over - but remains very drinkable and delicious (and dangerous) not matter what the style."
"Mouthfeel was rounded yet zippy. Medium in body."
"Drinkability: Incredibly easy to drink thanks to its perfectly balanced flavor and texture."
"Bottle. Pours a murky amber color with lots of floating sediment (love the sediment!) and a thick off-white head. Aroma is hoppy with a strong pine nose to it. Flavor is nice and hoppy, with hints of grapefruit and a bitter pine finish to it. Another top-notch offering from Alesmith."
"A solid IPA from AleSmith. Perfect example of a left coast IPA. My first foray into AleSmith beers and it definately wont be my last. I just need to figure out how to get more."
"D-This is a very drinkable IPA, right up there with my favorite ones."
"D - The deeper I get in this beer the more I like it. It gets better as it warms up. Excellent Beer."
"Taste is lead by the hops obviously. Flavors abroad from pine, grapefruit you name it... Slightly oily, resinous mouthfeel. Not too brash, but malts do little to bring balance to the hop bitterness. An exceptional IPA."
"This is a very good beer. 22oz bomber. Pours a very cloudy dark gold with a massive head that grows. Aroma is sweet citrus with big grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Taste is carmely malts followed by crisp citrus and pine hops that wash it all down. Very mild, perfectly light bitterness. Feels great in the mouth and goes down fast. Excellent beer, one of my favorites."
"I poured the beer into my standard Duvel tulip glass. It gave me a clear, deep golden color with a modestly thick tan head that was quite fluffy. The aroma was very pleasing - citrus notes, piney and bit sweet as well. At first the taste was not overly hoppy which I liked. I was expected a large west coat IPA bur rather got an excellent balance of the hop bitterness and the malty sweetness. I savored every drop of this one. Although the hops are very present, the balance that I got from this was very enjoyable and made for a darn drinkable beer that is very smooth."
"Very faithful to style. I would love to drink this again, and would probably drink too many of them. An excellent beer, which I enjoy more than the cask version and the Yules."
"I cant wait to get some more of this when in Ohio in two weeks. Hopefully Ill be able to stock up."
"D- Wow this beer has a great hops flavor with a wonderful support of sweet and dry toasted malt. The hops are big, juicy and complex yet the malt is big and helps balance the hops nicely. This is great as a session beer but I see the surprising 7.25% ABV could be dangerous."
"My first Alesmith brew, it's about time! This one pours a nice light copper hue with a generous fluffy off-white head that sticks to the glass all the way through to the end. Smell is such a sweet pine with one of the cleanest citrus hop odors I have ever smelled. Not a bitter odor at all, sadly I would wear this as cologne but I bet I wouldn't be the only one. Taste is top notch. Hardly any bitterness on the tounge except towards the end. Big sweet citrus flavor with enough malt to balance this one out just right. I hardly detect any alcohol in this one which is shocking because 7.2% abv for an IPA is pretty high. Mouthfeel is light/medium with a fair amount of carbonation. Very fresh and crisp. Probably the most enjoyable IPA's I've had to date. I look forward the the Yule Smith I have awaiting."
"Thanks to Talisker for the trade! Poured a slightly hazy copper with a decent head that left great lacing. The aroma was very fragrant with pine and citrus hops. The taste was a wonderful hop blend against a great malt backbone. This beer was great even following a growler of Pliny the Elder. The beer was light and crisp with well hidden alcohol. This is a great IPA."
"Obtained from Julio's Liquors in Massachusetts."
","
"Words cant really explain how well this is melded together and how smooth of a IPA it is. If you have access to this beer, definitely pick it up. I know Ill be frequenting this beer often."
"Careful when pouring this one, the head is like a hefe, very sensative. The head is pretty retentive too with a great lacing. The color is a gorgeous light copper/golden. The smell is wonderfully hoppy with grassy hops that aren't harsh at all, just right. The flavor is very good too, with a hoppiness that is flavorful, but not overdone. Just right, the perfect IPA that's still very very hoppy. The mouthfeel is nice, carbonated well, but the bubbles just fall to the back of your throat. It's got a good body too!! Not light or too heavy. Overall I would like to buy this by the case it is sooo good."
"Pours a slightly hazed copper/orange, nice thick off white head, superb lacing, great retention, really sticky and resiny. Smell is amazing, I can smell it from 2 feet away. Wonderfully piney, citrus, grapefruit, some nice caramel and bready malts, nice balance, smells very inviting. Taste is wow too, very grapefruity, floral, caramel, very syrupy in the mouth, sweet finish, then bitterness, very nice balance, fruity hoppiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, coats the mouth, low carbonation, nice spicy alcohol warming, although found this to be a little bit much, but amazing, perfect balance. Thanks for hooking me up Nate!"
"This is an outstandingly crafted IPA. Now I just need to get another bottle and rerate."
"As my first foray into AleSmith's brews I can't wait to snatch up more. Wonderful beer that, were I nearer its provenance, I am sure would always have a spot in my fridge."
"Poured into the bottle a hazy dark orange (with visible yeast)--even almost brown. Pretty dark and cloudy for an IPA. Head was thin and very short lived. Aroma was very nice: spicy and hoppy. The taste was very good, with a more complex malt profile than is normal for IPAs, I think. Many IPAs seem a bit one-dimensional to me. This one was very balanced. Certainly, fans of strong hops will be happy with it, but that's not all there is to this brew. Perhaps it was the salty food I was eating with it, but this beer seemed rather sweet--more so than any IPA I have tried previously. By no means is that a complaint, however. This was a very good beer. I paired it with a variety of rich, salty, fried appetizers and it was definitely up to the task--cutting through the other flavors and holding its own."
"This bottle was extremely drinkable, but I found myself tiring of the aftertaste. I'll drink it again, and probably often, but I think unless my opinion of the lingering bitterness changes it'll be easy to limit myself to one bomber. Let's not get carried away though - I doubt I'd ever share something this good!"
"D: A very tasty IPA, hoppy without going overboard, certainly among the tops I've had the pleasure of trying. Fortunately this one has been available around Portland in recent months; I'll definitely look for more and would recommend this unabashedly. Another excellent AleSmith brew."
"Poured a clear copper color with a dense rocky head that lasts to the bottom of the glass. Excellent citrus/pine aroma and taste, reminds me alot of Two Hearted. I poured too cold so had to wait until it warmed a bit. Could use a tad more malt flavor but still in my top three IPA's. I don't want to rate too high since I am just beginning to enjoy IPA's and haven't tried alot of them."
"drinkability; great; this beer has wonderful balance. the ideal IPA."
"A great, great beer."
"A very good IPA if not a bit much. I think you can go too far on the hops, this one is close. The finish feels like you just sucked on a bunch of hops which I actually do like. But still I prefer a slightly more balance and malty IPA with a strong hop flavor like Victory Hop Devil. Low mark on drinkability for an IPA cause I could not drink too many of these."
"The drinkablity of this one is pretty high as well. It's not so bitter to beat up your palate, and overall is really nice and easy drinking. Wish I'd gotten a second bomber, because this first one went down like butter. But, only having had two glasses, worth, I can't really be sure."
"D: This beer hits the style right on. A great American west-coast IPA, one of the better ones that I've sampled. Very well balanced with the appropriate amount of hops with the sweetness of the malts. It's a little hard to find up here in NorCal but I would definitely be drinking it often if I could."
"D- could definitely have a couple of these, would love to try this on tap sometime"
"D- Very nice IPA. I would like a bit more fruity flavors and a little bit more carbonation. Other than that this is a great IPA. Takes a nice spot up in some of my favorite beers."
"Notes: Whoa! Very well balanced (by west coast standards), with plenty of sweet and bitter flavors to offer. They may be less famous than Stone among San Diego brewers, but this offering is exceptional."
"I was turned onto craft beer by the Stone line of ales while living in Arizona, but I think that Alesmith IPA has quickly become one of my personal favorites and my top-ranked IPA. I have dreamt about the smooth citrus hops (no joke), and am very pleased to have moved so close to the Alesmith brewery here in San Diego. Any fan of west coast IPAs would be remiss in not trying this amazingly balanced and refreshing ale."
"paired well with my attempts at homemade japanese food."
"Drinkability is way up there. Yet another well crafted beer from San Diego... quite enjoyable."
"2nd bottle consumed may have been a little fresher. Notes of orange were in the aroma and pine needles and candy were in the flavor. Yummy stuff."
"D - Amazingly drinkable. One of my favorite IPA's to date. The balance is the reason I attribute it to an DIPA. The almost perfect balance of ingredients is something I'm going to have to get used to from AleSmith."
"Very good beer overall, but not the top notch IPA I expected. Much more like a DIPA to me. Different from other SoCal IPAs I've tried. The intense sweetness was a little too much for me. That said, my expectations were artificially high and I'd certainly like to have this available to me regularly."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkabililty: This is a very smooth IPA. I could drink quite a bit of this. It's just so damn good and so easy to drink. Overall, it's my favorite IPA on the market and I highly recommend it to all."
"This beer really impressed me from start to finish and will become a regular of mine. If you like this try Stone Brewery's Ruination IPA a liquid poem to the glory of the hop."
"D: A very nice IPA from the west coast. Definitely one that needs to be had if you can find it. Glad I got the chance to try this offering."
"Now for an IPA this is a very good ""west coast"" IPA. (let see how many people I piss of with that one) The is a very deep gold beer with a white fluffy head that makes it almost to pretty to drink. Almost that is. On the first waft of the aroma I get a lot of that trade mark West side citrusy hop aromas. Bu there is more to this beer than just that. As I delve deeper there-in lies alot of things going on here. There is a slight toasty caramel flavor to it. But as it warms up it turns to a bready flavor that blends the malt sweetness together with the hops. Very pleasant. The aromas transfer nicely to make up the body of the beer. Bready, caramelly sweet. Nice blend, very well balanced. there also seems to be some passion fruit to it that comes out. Very nice. The mouth feel is very true to the style. Light and slick. But not a bad slick, dries out on the end, leaves your mouth knowing you had a good beer in there. Overall a very good IPA. I will definitely look for this again."
"Thanks to metallitone1 for sending this fine IPA my way. Poured into a shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a hazy, golden copper color with a huge three fingers of fluffy off white head that leaves decent lacing on the glass with each sip. Smells of sweet malt and tropical fruit such as mango. Tastes of pineapple, tangerine, yeasty bread and alcohol. Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. My bomber was empty in a short time. I'm glad I have another to savor in the future and will try to procure this again. Recommended."
"D---An average IPA in my opinion. I'm happy I got a chance to try it but it did not live up to the hype."
"Poured into AleSmith pint glass just for the occassion. Poured the deepest amber color and almost brownish. Large off-whit head laces the glass well ans really sustains even though the rising bead isn't overwhelming. Smells of orange peel and floral hops jump out with a toasted malt smell also. Resiny hop taste that follows the nose too. Malts almost taste darker to me like between toasted and roasty. Medium bodied and decent carbonatiare on in mouthfeel that isn't overdone. Bitterness in mouthfeel is really felt on rear sides of tongue. Drinkability is very good eventhough availability is not for me. Alcohol is decently masked for the strength. Will try for more bottles of this in the future."
"I would love to drink a lot of these so I am rating it high on the drinkability scale."
"I've been leaning toward stouts and barleywines lately. This one could bring me back to the hoppy side again."
"I've been wanting to try this for a while and finally got my hands on it. I wasn't disappointed. A fantastic IPA that is among the best, with glowing, fresh hops. Can't wait to try the Alesmith Speedway Stout."
"Drinkability: One of my favorite IPA's without a doubt, very drinkable and refreshing, the hops are huge but mix with the rest of the beer like a great food + beer combo. Balanced."
"Pours a nice murky burnt orange to copper color, nice and cloudy with a good sized off white light tan head. Nice citrusy hop aroma, grapefruit with a little lemony tanginess, tangerine and a little trpoical mango aroma there as well. Citrusy hoppiness comes thru well in the taste with a soft candy like malty sweetness behind balancing it. A hint of warming alcohol becomes evident as the beer approaches room temp. Light to medium in body with a bite of alcohol and hoppiness in the finish, a delayed dryness on the tongue. Good solid IPA, may not be the best I've had but definitely a fine example."
"This beer is a nice orange with a thick white head. There is some lacing. The smell is sweet and citrusy. The taste is bitter and sweet. A good ipa. The mouthfeel is smooth and the abv is not evident at all. The drinkability is good as I am finishing the bomber with ease. I may try to obtain more of this in the future."
"Cheers!"
"This beer poured a slight cloudy amber color and formed a very nice foamy white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops, citrus, pine and a hint of caramel. The flavor was of hops, citrus and a hint of pepper. The body was fairly light and finish was a bit astrigent, yet sweet. A great beer."
"Alesmith IPA pours a very slightly hazy orange with an off white head. Smell is very fruity with a lot of citrus, orange, grapefruit, as well as a slight piney aroma. The taste is more sweet citrus, lots of orange flavor with a hint of bitter grapefruit. The sweet maltiness kicks in just enough to balence the solid hop bitterness. This beer is so balenced, it hides its strength very well. I brought this bottle back from CA, hopefully it makes its way out the the East Coast soon."
"Notes: Special thanks to KingG for the sample."
"D: What a superb and balanced AIPA this is. This could easily give any of Stone's IPA's a run for their money. It's big and refreshing and so good it's scary. Here's to hoping that someday they distribute their beer in IL, IN, MI, or WI."
" There is no malice intended in this review at all. I seriously wanted to love this beer, but I ended up being disappointed. This isn't a bad beer by any means, but stack it up against other IPAs in a BLIND tasting and I'd bet the reviews are way lower."
"D:Outstanding drinkability! Perfectly balanced and scary good! Alcohol is wel hidden. A hop head's brew indeed!"
"D- very enjoyable and very complex, really a work of art. awesome balance, not a sessionable brew, highly recommended, leaves you tasting hops for a while. i wish the alcohol was more hidden though"
"D: So superb. I'm seriously ready for Alesmith to make another double IPA as well as Yulesmith, guaranteed instant classic. Peter might as well change his name to Midas. My favorite every day IPA by far."
"Poured from 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Body is a brilliant, slightly cloudy golden orange topped by an inch of creamy bright white head. Excellent creamy lacing gets left all around the glass. Understated aroma of piney hops, with a whiff of grapefruit and some light sweet malt. Palate is damn near perfect - nice, citrusy hops meld with a tasty light and caramel malt profile. Finish is dry, lightly fruity, and sweet. Mouthfeel is wonderful - not too thick or syrupy, especially for such a strong beer. Dry finish is very nice. I could drink this every day."
"Even though this is a big beer, its so damned tasty that I cant not want to have 10 more. Easy to knock back too many of these."
"D - Perhaps the best IPA I've ever had (which is saying alot considering I heart this style). I will plan on acquiring as much of this as possible in the future."
"Drinkability: Very tasty; great example of a West Coast IPA"
"West Coast in a bottle. Exemplary of American IPAs and certainly among the top 5 I've ever had."
"This was recommended to me by an employee at BevMo, and I was quite pleased. It has a somewhat milky nature for an IPA, but the smell and taste are quite wonderful. Smooth and dense, it's has a hearty taste and a good moderate finish, not too dry and not too bitter."
"This is a remarkable beer, but Im not sure Id want to drink the whole bomber in one sitting."
"I love the taste of these and stone hops, but they can be a little harsher on the bitterness and a little harder to drink."
"Outstandingly drinkable. Why, oh why did I wait this long to try this beer?"
"Real character. The best IPA I have ever tried."
"Poured into an English pint, light amber, slight dry hop haze with a billowing white head that lasted the entire time I was drinking this beer. Im getting all facets of hop aroma here. Citurs, spice, earth, and flowers are all in line. Some nice honey aroma works its way through to represent the malt. Again a quality blend of hop flavor takes over as I drink also. Stong bitterness is sure to get your attention. Very resinous, and stinky from the lips to the tonsils. Reminds me of a wannabe Racer 5. Almost as good, but falls just short."
"Undoubtably one of the easiest drinking big beers I've ever tasted. (Frankly, one of the BEST beers I've ever tasted.) Bravo!"
"Good job Alesmith."
"Drinkability: I had problems with undercarbonation, but it was fixed. I tried a newer bottle of the IPA, and quite frankly if you can find a better IPA, I would like to know. The beer was aweeesome. You could taste the hops, and the malt was so crisp. If you haven't tried it, your definitely missing out."
"What else can I say? It meets the hype for me and would without a doubt be a staple in my fridge if it was available anywhere within 100 miles of me."
"A very good IPA, that should be a standard for any one wanting to try a high quality IPA. Give it a try!"
"Overall a good IPA barring the slightly unpleasant stale/peanut-buttery flavor. I'm just going to assume that it isn't supposed to have that. The hops flavors were quite good and it was overall quite refreshing with a good mouthfeel. Wort a try with that stale flavor, recommended without."
"The mouth feel is medium and coats the mouth with hop oil. The over-carbonation comes back in a negative way for me in the mouth feel. Overall, this is a very good IPA, but to me it has a bit of harshness to it. I am not sure if it is the rush of carbonation or the bitterness. I would definitely drink this regularly if it were available to me, but it is not in my top 5 IPAs."
"It's a good IPA, though not one of my favorites. I would pick one of my local midwestern IPA's, such as Alpha King, any day."
"I would have to say at this moment in time, AleSmith is my favorite IPA."
"This one is complex and strong enough for special occasions but quaffable enough for the casual drink. Refined and well crafted. A very impressive IPA."
"Once you get past the ridiculous dense mouse laden head you are left with a big bold extra hoppy supper bitter IPA. The first sip assaults the palette with a sharp biting tingle of tart hoppy goodness. On second approach I am drawn to the underlying ""pale ale"" characteristics reminding not to forget the PA in IPA. Mmmmm, kind of tasty...Faint citrus notes, other than that nothing to fragrant, no flowers, caramels or toffees to speak of just a nice clean finish, sharp biting hops, solid carbonation and excellent mouth feel. Good Stuff!"
"Mouthfeel is full, with moderate carbonation, finishes crisp. Very drinkable."
" A great IPA here."
"Outstanding IPA, highly recommended!"
"This is a pretty good IPA. Many thanks to Zorro for this one."
"This beer pours a rusty gold with a frothy white head that laces nicely and leaves fluffy foam the whole way down the glass. The smell has the subtle sweetness donated by the pale malt but is dominated by the citrusy hops. There seems to be some cascade or centennial but there is more to it perhaps even some amarillo. The mouthfeel is very creamy but not too thick. The carbonation is nice from the bottle conditioning. For a single IPA, this has a mouthfeel that really shows off. Overall, a great IPA. I just really love a well done IPA, and this is certaily up there with the best of them."
"Very nicely carbonated and rather clean and oh so easy to drink. My fridge will always have several bottles of this!!! Yours should too!"
"I enjoyed several samples of this tasty brew at the Bluezapalooza beer fest @ Mammoth Mtn, in the Sierra, reviewed from notes (yeah I was that guy at the fest taking notes.) A treat for this East coaster to try this fine brew on tap for my first Alesmith IPA experience. This one pours a typical medium shade of almond amber, with a fairly dull tan head and leaving splattered lacing upon a gentle swirl. the excitement starts with the crisp hoppy nose and the resiny hops that carry this brew across the tongue and taste buds. Fine AIPA. smooth, clean and pleasantly hoppy. Haven't had anything from Alesmith yet that was not top notch."
"D: An incredibly easy drinking IPA. Alesmith really outdid themselves this time."
"go get yourself some of this right now."
"Body is a luscious dirty golden color topped by a pristine white inch thick head. Decent amount of lacing is left behind after each sip. Nose is kind of unimpressive. I get some brief pine halted almost instantly by lots of caramel malt. What gives? Taste is dominated by citrus, grapefruit, lemon, and orange. Sadly none of these reach out and grab the dominant role. Malt is also very heavy, bordering something of an amber. It tastes good but honestly you probably have an IPA brewed in your backyard that does this as well. Mouth is smooth and nice. This is a good IPA I could drink a lot of .... however, it isn't too remarkable. I can't put my finger on what it is but something is missing."
"D: The ale is quite good. Even with the almost 8% abv, this beer is hoppy, vibrant and delicious. Thanks to Boolshot for an excellent trade."
"Drinkability/notes: An excellent, slightly over-the-top IPA, well worth a try."
"One way to drinking the BA top 10 IPA I can immediately see why this one is high up on the list. Appearance is a cloudy golden honey color with a white head. Smell gets a 5, the incredible piney hops want me to eat this beer rather than drink it. Taste is hoppy sweet but smooth with a great malt finish. Mouthfeel is light with some oil resin present which makes this one drinkable IPA. Kick ass beer and cannot express my gratitude to westsidethreat for getting me this one in a trade."
"This is a most excellent IPA. I give it my very highest recommendation. This is one you should do what ever you have to do to obtain and try it."
"All in all, a great beer from Alesmith. Dark copper in color, with a manageable pillow of head that leaves it's snail trail down the sides of my glass. Very sweet and crisp smelling, some nice citrus notes to be found. Hop flavor is quickly bitter, but not in an overpowering, face puckering way. Just a quick kick to the taste buds before sliding into malty sweet territory. Drinks like a dream. This may just be the best bottled IPA in San Diego county."
"On tap at Lucky Baldwin's again. Had tried a bottled version a handful of months ago as well. I didn't enjoy either of these that much. The body is just too malty in my opinion and has a sweetness that doesn't blend well with the hops."
"Aroma was a strong piney, citrusy hop attack. Taste was more of the same with the hops very up front and just a little of the malty sweetness coming through. Mouthfeel was good. Finish was very dry. Another excellent offering from Alesmith, very easy to put back but with the high ABV, I was feeling it by the end."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber color ale with a huge foamy head with standard retention. Aroma of citrus hops is quite powerful and dominate. Taste is also overpowered by citrus hops with a metallic aftertaste. There is some caramel malt that is discernable though very faint. Im not sure I see why this is rated so highly. Overall, this beer is one-dimensional and not properly balance."
"A hearty cheers to BRoss242 for the pleasure."
"Nice honey hue with slight cloudiness and a nice bubbly head, almost too much head. It wasnt a creamy head, but light and fluffy. The smell was of hops and wintergreen pine and some other spices hiding in the background. First swig was a bit too hoppy and full for me, but as it warmed up towards the end of the large bottle the taste mellowed and didnt have a lot of bite like the first taste. Mouthfeel was not bad, a bit bubbly and spicey aftertaste. Overall a drinkable IPA, but I just got into this style so I am still doing a lot of tasting of them, however this is the mellowest so far of them and the one I would prefer to drink again."
"Wow! This IPA is nearly perfect. It has the strong grapefruity west-coast hop bite that I was expecting, that was balanced by a mild, honey sweetness. The alcohol was almost completely hidden. I really could drink it all night, and implore Alesmith to send more of it our way."
"Pours a nice, clear copper with an inch or so of head. Smells of grapefruit and floral scents with some doughy malt as well. The taste balanced well with hops being the main act after the malty opening. Mostly citrus and floral flavors from the hops and some sweet bread at the beginning from the malts. Nice, bubbly mouthfeel. Bitter,dry finish but not much hint of the abv with this one."
"The beer is very easy to drink and there is no hint of the ABV. Quite a nice, not over the top hoppy, IPA."
"Nice copper color, good head retention. Pours two fingers and retains it well. Bottle conditioned so it has a nice creamy carbonation. Great hop aroma, very citrusy. Taste is very nice and smooth with that characteristic bite. Textbook example of an American IPA executed very well."
"Drinkability: One of the finest in the style, this beer gets all the laud it receives, in the top 5 of the style."
"Poured from a large (1pt 6oz) Alesmith bottle. The beer was dark orange and clear, with a nice sticky head. There was a strong hops aroma but not too one-dimensional. The flavor was pretty much the same, a hops bomb but balanced with some smooth malt flavor. Really really good. Alesmith IPA isn't marketed in OH that I've seen, which is too bad. Their more expensive beers (Horny Devil, Grand Cru, Speedway Stout) are available but too expensive to drink too often."
"Cheers2Beers"
"D: This is a ""prince""ly IPA. Not quite imperial but more than a normal IPA. 1 1/2? Drinks well for a 1.5, a little heavy for a single. I love it, but couldn't drink too many. I feel like I could session some IPAs, but not this guy. I could drink this every night though."
"Medium-full body, moderately carbonated. Alcohol is well hidden in this one. The milder than expected finish makes this a pretty smooth IPA, and I can see having quite a few of these in a sitting."
"This isn't my favorite IPA, but it is definitely one I would purchase again and possibly let sit a bit longer to see how it changes."
"D - A hoppy but well balanced IPA. There are no signs of the 7.25% ABV. A very enjoyable IPA that I wish made its way to the Midwest."
"Good carbonation, medium body and a hop oily mouthfeel, this is what an IPA is all about (with extra hops). With an above average ABV, this stuff still goes down very easily, try some! Cheers to you hopheads!"
"Looks a non-transparent orangish color with a head that just won't quit. When it finally does it leaves a sticky lacing down the sides of the glass. Very inviting looking beer. Near perfection. Smells like a citrisy/piney IPA. Good, but nothing that is all that unusual in terms of West Coast hop monsters. Taste is great. Initial grapefruit hop bite followed by a nutty/toasted malt backing. Not as sweet as some IPAs, but different and very good. Finishes like orange juice does. Full and citrisy. Drinkability is very good. I'd love to be able to get this beer on a regular basis."
"I could drink this beer all night. And all day. And again tomorrow. And the next day, etc. Nothing is overdone in the beer, but done just right. Alesmith nailed it with this one. I wish I could get it here in Florida. Two thumbs WAYYY UP. Worthy of its ranking. Beautiful."
"Highly recommended, easy to find on the west coast, a bit harder elsewhere it seems."
"It's hard to imagine getting tired of this one, a challenge to the current ""staple."""
"D - This beer has immediately become one of the house staples. A VERY drinkable beer and you don't necessarily have to be a hop head to enjoy - but it doesn't hurt I'm sure. It's not over the top imo because of the great malt balance. Thanks for making my evening AleSmith Brew Co.!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a medium body. The beer has a very creamy mouthfeel. The carbonation perfectly assist the smell and taste of the beer. The beer is a very execellent example of an IPA. The drinkability is high. The alcohol never plays much of a factor in the taste and smell. This may be the finest IPA I have ever partaken of."
"I speculate that it will be on tap at my wedding."
"Well on first taste all you can really say is balanced. Extremely balanced fruit, hop, alcohol. Same fruits as in the nose. Very attractive hops not to tannic yet not to subtle. Type of IPA you can just sit around and drink, and drink, and drink, and drink, and finally pass out. MMM Delicious."
"Drinkability: This is a mighty fine beer, not quite sessionable due to the slightly higher ABV, but definitely goes down easy. Recommended."
"A very drinkable IPA-- one I will revisit again! Alesmith should bottle this in 12 oz, six packs. I would make it my ""session"" IPA if so!"
"The aroma has a great piney, earthy and light caramel/toast bouquet. The appearance was copper with a slight chill haze. I know it's bottle conditioned but even the first four ounces out of the bomber were hazy. The head has small bubbles, lasts forever and is merenque-esque. The flavor is great, a full mouth of centennial (I think) hop flavor and bitterness nicely held up by a pedestal of malt sweetness and some mild alcohol warmth. The mod low carbonation makes for a smooth mouthfeel and keeps the hops from bowling over the rest of the flavors. This was a higly drinkable IPA. I wish I could get it in Alaska."
"Hazy golden amber with swirling, steady carbonation and a rocky, meringue-like off-white head. Intoxicating (yes, of course!) aromas of grapefruit juice, spruce sap, and sugared limes. Sweet candied lemons, grapefruit pulp mashed with sugar, fresh pine cone burps. Some malt is there; it's gotta be there, because the hop levels in this IPA are so strong that it could easily cross the ""too much"" line...but it doesn't! Credit due to the implied, understated, yet fully functional malt presence. Juicy, smooth mouthfeel; dry yet sweet; my tongue buzzes from hop astringency. Lovely. Just insanely drinkable. This has to be as near to perfect as an IPA can get. It's great to have in-laws in AZ so I can get this from time to time. Absolutely stellar."
"Bottle Pours a hazy amber with a good off white frothy head. Good lasting with excellent lacing. Aroma is hoppy spruce with hints of leaves and molasses. Just about the perfect carbonation that a beer could be. Very smooth with a slight oily texture. Has a great duration with an excellent aftertaste. This has great blending. A wonderful IPA. It makes me want to move to California so I can get more of it. The only negative to this beer is that I cant get it easily in Pennsylvania. Just awesome."
"Blasts out of the growler spilling hops flavors and white foamy suds The body is a dirty dark yellow color with tons of bubbles ripping through this thing. Hop flavor everywhere! Nose is standard hop bliss, lots of freshness and some sweet caramel ta boot. Taste is where it kicks up. Very dry, even. I am big fan of having hops in my mouth I soon find out. Some notes of citrus fruit, a very subtle maltiness, VERY subtle though it is there. So much hops and dryness it even begs for more. has a very bitter finish and leaves the mouth craving another."
"I really cant say enough good things about this beer. I send to my friends on the East Coast  who, unfortunately cannot get it there. I dream about when I sleep. Seriously, just go out and get yourself one, if you can."
"D - Absolutely delicious. This beer alone makes me want to move back to california."
"Lightly cloudy, the color is copper-orange, head is short and fizzles out speedily. Carbonation appears nice. Aroma is a pleasant mix of lightly sweet malt and strong tangy hops. The flavor is sweet for a second, followed by more hoppiness, finishing with a nice moderate bitterness. Flavor is dry overall, strong but not overpowering. Alcohol is kept in check. Has a nice medium thickness, and decent carbonation. Well-balanced IPA, they didn't try to overdo it, they made it just right. Quite drinkable..."
"Is this a good session beer? That is a tough question to answer. I really enjoy this beer. However, the alcohol content is a little high. Also, the flavor, while not overbearing to me, might be a bit much for some."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and a bit creamy. The mellow carbonation makes it so easy to consume and the bomber empties all too soon. An awesome brew that I'd drink way more often if it was available. Count yourself lucky if you can get Alesmith at your local! Thanks to blitheringidiot for hookin me up with another great beer."
"Overall: A smooth, nice balanced IPA with an excellent finish. Time was taken to craft this interesting beer, definitely worth a tryor three. Great beer!"
"Notes: I haven't been into IPAs in some time, but this one reminded me of how good they can be (in moderation), just SOLID. I enjoyed with some pepperoni and Dubliner cheddah."
"flavor needs a bit more nuance to make this one a top-notch ipa. appearance and aromas are great, but drinkability hurt by the lingering harsh bitterness."
"Sampled from a 22oz bottle. Pours a hazy, deep copper hue and makes a thick creamy white head that slowly diminishes into a thin layer of tiny dense bubbles which never fades. Dense Belgian lacing clings to the sides of my glass. Some pine and citrus aromas appear from a quick swirl of the glass, there's a hint of sweet malts as well. Flavor hits the tongue hard with a mouth-puckering strong bitterness and then the sweet malted backbone rushes in to bring a wonderful balance. Massive herbal and grassy hop flavors mixed with tart grapefruit citrus and pine with just the right ammount of caramel malt balance to make this one taste as good as a west coast IPA can taste. Bottle conditioning gives this a nice creamy texture on the palate and then closes with an astringent dry finish. A really well done IPA in the west coast style, I enjoy AleSmith IPA often."
"very easy to put back, but knowing there are a few other ipas i enjoy more, i feel like i could do better with something else. a fine beer, but not exceptional."
"This is, simply, a big American IPA with no flaws. Exceptional balance and drinkability. I know this one is highly rated, but I don't think Alesmith gets enough credit for the brews, like this one, that they consistently produce. This brew is as ""worthy"" as any American IPA I've had the pleasure of sampling."
"A very drinkable double IPA can be a session beer for those who can handle the hops."
"Taste equally good; The hops flood the palate with crisp, spicy, bitter flavors that are balanced very well by the sweetness of the malt. I'm not a hop head, but appreciate this style of beer and think that this is an extremely well-rounded, full-bodied example of an IPA. The 7.25 alcohol content doesn't make an appearance in flavors, instead by way of cheerful warmth. I've run into a few IPAs that are simply too spicy and astringent; This one is full and smooth on the palate."
"The hazy peach to orange color looks especially cool with my laptop screen providing backlight in my dark room. Fabulous head retention. The nose is big and complex: lots of pine, complimented by orange sherbet, caramel malts, and pepper. It starts out with assertive grapefruity hops, but as this warms up floral and hops come through alone with silky smooth sweet malts. Oh fucking hell- the second pour is even better. It now dons a big frothy head that's not going anywhere and the yeast is in the glass now which is fine by me. The alcohol is slightly noticeable, but it doesn't interfere with the drinkability. This is pretty awesome."
"Hazy copper color topped by a thick, fluffy off-white head that lasted for days. Tons of bright citrus in the nose. Tangerine and mandarin orange dominate the aroma. Wonderful drape of lace on the side of the glass as I pause to drink. Mouth wakening bitterness. There is a lot of grapefruit in the front of the flavor. Mild caramel and just a hint of Jolly Rancher orange candy on the finish. Loads of Chinook hop in this beer. The bitterness is pronounced, but not harsh. The mouth feel is lick, mildly oily. Great drinkability as the alcohol is well hidden."
"Has a nice mouth coating medium mouthfeel. Flavor lingers for a while. Drinkability is superb. Crisp and refreshing that comes with a nicely balanced flavor."
"Thanks again to Kmpitz2 for sharing. Looks IPAish with a copper-orange hue and a little haze. Has incredible head retention. Smells very citrusy and pine-ey with an almost balanced barley malt base, allowing the hops to dominate the nose. Flavors are sweet of malt and hop flavored all at once. The hop flavor shows more of a citrus (grapefruit, oranges, lemon rinds) with the pine-ey, grass-ey flavors showing more in the back of the throat and a little more subtle in strength. All hop flavors and aromas swirl around a solid, but not overbearing, malt base. Very smooth and silky to the mouth. A joy to drink. I can see why it's one of BA's top beers."
"Bomber provided by nvsblman and shared with absolutesites on T-Day, 2005. Thanks for the opportunity! Pours a one finger nearly white head over a very cloudy light apricot colored liquid. Smells potently of grapefuit. Pithy, some pine, and a kind of driftwood dryness. Flavor is biting hop grapefruit with too much crystal malt. Disjointed. I don't know if age could bring the hops and sweet together. I think the hops would fall apart before the crystal malt settles. Well, shucks, I'm focusing on trash-talk when I've actually got a quality beer in my hand. It's enjoyable. Just not the soothing beverage I was hoping would add to the lull in my turkey-infused body. The hops leave the medium mouthfeel dry and the carbonation is medium."
"Medium mouthfeel with a slight alcohol burn. A bit of a dry finish. The hops are still very nice and make this a very easy beer to drink."
"Drinkability: Lovely in every sense of the word. I like the balance of rich flavors without selling anything short. Smooth and tasty. The malt is toasty and hop flavors are bitter and complex. It doesn't get much better than this."
"Pours slightly hazed peach/orange with a persistant creamy head. Aroma as dominate and pleasing as your going to find. Hop candy! On a par with 3F's Dreadnaught. Flavor is huge pine and citrus hops perfectly balanced by a massive and complex malt base that offers no turn offs. Alcohol is well hidden and offsets the sweet malts to offer drying as the bitterness lingers. I can't think of a way to improve this and expect the haze was a simple matter of a rough ride before the pour."
"Cheers!"
"22 bottle. Medium copper color with a nearly white, chunky head. Smells of grapefruit rind and pine. The nose is grapefruity with a slight pale malt sweetness that gets sweeter as it warms up. Mid palate it has a fairly full mouthfeel and a nice balance of citrusy hops and mild sweetness that comes through as sort of ripe orangey, almost juicy. Finishes cleanly though, not exactly crisp but clean enough, and it has a faint malt aftertaste. Outstanding hop flavors and nicely balanced, but could be a touch crisper."
"Pours a deep gold color, huge head. Lacing/head stayed thru out the whole time. Very hoppy/citrus scents. Hoppy/sweet taste with a nice bite at the end. Medium body. This is one helleva brew, awesome taste and quite strong for a IPA, a couple of these and you will be feeling pretty good."
"This is a very drinkable brew and I'm happy to discover it's available locally. No surprise that it's one of the top rated IPAs and frankly, it could easily stand up to all but the very finest double IPAs."
"Last swigs: The highlight of this bottle was the LAST pour with loads of flavor and gooey lip smackin hop smack. Hop heroin. I wish they all could be California IPAs! It might be their yeast strand that really allows those hops to shine. This IPA is such a blast of crisp hops, that doesnt get muddled in a malt mud. That is why it is so good. This might be my best example of a true Am IPA. I flew back from Portland with about 20 bomber bottles of varied beers. They should have been all Alesmith IPAs. Why this isnt cosidered a 2IPA is beyond me. Its been a long time since a beer really excited me."
"I'd drink these all day, and get used to the slightly off mouthfeel....lol!"
"Ah, they say Alesmith may make it's way to MA soon...I believe I could get used to having this one around."
"Not for the IPA beginner, this beer is closer to 2IPA then most 2IPAs. Very hoppy, very potent, very alluring. If you get the chance, get some."
"Poured a hazy copper, orange color with a small sticky off white head that diminished to a small film but still left nice lacing. Amazing citrus and pine hop aroma. Sweet malts, bitter hops, perfect mouthfeel, perfect balance. It doesn't taste bitter enough to be an Imperial, but the balance is superb... YUM! Thanks Marc"
"Amazing IPA. I hope Alesmith's brews stick around here, and that we receive a wider variety in the future -- the only other Alesmith brew I saw at the store is the pale ale."
"Thanks to garagekegger for sharing his bomber with me,poured a slightly hazy light amber with a nice one finger head,aromas of course are intensly hoppy very piney and citrusy.This is a bold tasting IPA very resiny and piney along with lemon rind but there is a firm somewhat nutty malt backbone that is very noticable.A damn fine IPA loaded with flavor damn I want more!"
"One of the best IPA's that i've sampled. This beer leans towards a DIPA but thats not the point. The point is ""how does this beer score?"" and it scores well regardless of style."
"Drinkability- A definite top level IPA. One I would readily buy often if it was easily available here. Definite must try for anyone who loves IPA's."
"The is very drinkable, but at it's strength, vould be pretty ""warming"". To me, it was right on the verge of a DIPA, but not quite there. It is definitely in my top two for the style, I love this beer, but that's not surprising, as it's AleSmith!!!"
"The smell is strong and nice, if somewhat plain. The taste is very good, bringing hops through and through. There's no question what the star is in this bottle. The mouthfeel is very appealing while drinkability takes a small hit for the respectable strength."
"This ale is a bit overpowering to make it a regular treat, but it is very well done."
"This is a highly drinkable IPA, give me this or Stone and you would hear no complaints. Alesmith IPA is right on! A bad mutha!!"
"I can understand the appeal of this beer  it delivers a lot of both malt and hops. And yet this is neither a traditional IPA (English or American), nor an especially satisfying innovation, at least not to me. Frankly, this is hop candy, not a functional representation of an India pale ale."
"Finger licking good."
"Drinkability - I just can't find anything to complain about here, except that I didn't drink this sooner and ask Drew to bring me 5 more, lol. Maybe that'll change, I've been seeing more Alesmith around the area lately, this one's a keeper. Thanks Drew!!!"
"This a well crafted IPA. While not one of my favorite genres, this one was very nice. Its not overly hopped, and the crisp, clean quality is very nice. One of the better IPA's I have had and I would definitely drink this again."
"Easily one of my top IPAs. Extremely well balanced, intense hop character and wondefully drinkable. Pours a hazy, copper orange colour, with a gorgeous white head. Strong piney, citrus, fruity aroma. Rich, complex taste - fruit, maltiness, slight alcohol. It makes your mouth water. Extremely fresh."
"Earthy spice aroma and some peaches in the nose. The taste is lots of earth and pine with some citrus, but mostly this great sharp herbal hop taste, like biting into a nice piece of wood but without that oaky taste. At some point I could also swear I tasted chocolate malt or some kind of dark roasty malt, but I've since learned that they use ""honey malt"" in this one. Hop character is very agressive, but malt balance is very clean, leaving very little sweetness in the mouth. Mouthfeel is excellent and flavor makes drinkability a no-brainer. Quaff this one heartily. Oh, and if anyone you know is visiting from San Diego, have them grab you a bomber or two of this one. I have to thank my beloved mom for hand-carrying this one over!"
"Thanks Weedchugger!"
"Started a little disappointing, I must admit. But as I drank, and as it warmed, it became apparant that this is an exceptional IPA. Very smooth, with a hearty and solid mouthfeel, this is a piney affair from nose to mouth. Left a ragged lace with some floaties. ""it's piney, but mellow"" as my wife put it. As it goes down, I wonder, is this the perfect IPA?"
"Overall, an exceptional IPA. I can't believe that I've never had this before, but I'm certainly glad that I have. Fantastic."
"Alcohol is not as apparent as I thought it would be, overall a very filling and delicious brew. Most likely THE perfect IPA. Amazing."
"Slightly hazy golden amber colour topped by a generous, fluffy, white head. Superb head retention with foam rings on the glass showing the size of each sip. Hop aroma of citrus and spice, nearly perfumy. Some maltiness comes through as well, but is more restrained. Bitterness is a little restrained to start, but is balanced very well by a biscuity, malty base, plenty of orange/citrus hop flavour. A bit of alcohol warmth shows up in the finish, where the bitterness really shines. Creamy, moderate carbonation and medium/full body. Easily one of the best west coast IPAs I've had the pleasure to sample. You BAs in San Diego are a lucky bunch!"
"Notes: While this is a very tasty brew, one bomber will do for now."
"Drinkability - It has a higher abv than many IPAs and it comes in a big bottle, but man does it go down easy. The only hindrance to me is that I live on the east coast where Alesmith is a rarity, very glad I picked this up when I saw it, one of the two or three best of the style in my opinion"
"Alesmith continues to impress. This beer proves you dont have to ""Imperialize"" something to make it good. Pours a lightly hazy orange amber color with a thick and creamy off-white head. Thick patches of lacing in the glass. Big citrus and floral hops in the nose. Medium body with loads of hops, spice and citrus and a nice malt undercurrent. The finish is hoppy with noticeable pine and lingers well. Great work here."
"Picked this up at Bevmo in T.O. two weeks ago. Pours a caramel color with a nice creamy foam sitting on top. This is my kind of beer. Bottle says to let yeast sit in the bottle, but I say live and let them be free and drink those suckers up. Citrusy smell that I love to get from a quality American IPA. Nice sweet malty flavors followed by a bitterness that a fine IPA should have. Fine example of a awesome American IPA. Once beers warms a bit with glass, no lacing is left on the glass. Would buy again and again and again, if available in my area."
"Overall: Beautifully aromatic on cask. Wonderfully malty in the bottle. I MUST re-taste the tap version. I bet I'll get the best of both worlds..."
"22 oz bomber, don't know the bottling date. Today has been one of those crap-tastic days where I just need something good and hoppy to slip into and forget about the day (aside from Paul Hackett resigning from the Jets...woo hoo!). This light sunset brew should do the trick, with a spicy hop aroma and some citrus and gummy bear in the nose as well. The flavor of this brew surprises me; so much malt! Granted, it's balanced well with the resinous sticky bitterness of the hops, but I would file this in the malty American IPA category, a list with few names. This rounds out to be a bitter brew, starting with the chalky, toasted maltiness at the start, to the slightly charred sweet citrus fruits in the middle, to the bitter hoppy finish. Still, the malt can be tasted throughout. Burps reveal the hops. Mmmm. Mouthfeel shows hardly any carbonation, and the thin lace on top died quickly...what's up with that? An interesting one to say the least, and it's great to get some AleSmith here in the East. Wee Heavy and YuleSmith are next..."
"I enjoy this brew, and it is one of the better Alesmith offerings, but I prefer some others to this brew."
"22oz bomber. This beer poured a golden color with a small white head that didn't stick around too often but left a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was very hoppy - citrus mostly. Slight caramel backbone, but it's all about the hops. The flavor was very hoppy as well. Lots of grapefruit flavors all around. Nice caramel malt in the back that balances things out really well. Very well made IPA."
"Thanks to clvand0 for bringing this beer to our tasting. The beer poured a golden color with one finger of head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was full on grapefruit hop, with some caramel sweetness in the background. Nice nice nice. The flavor was full of nice sweet hops, grapefruit and a touch of caramel. The feel was thick, just what I want for this beer. Drinkability was huge. I wished I had more of it to drink. What a smooth, easy drinking beer."
"22oz. bomber poured into a snifter. It pours a slightly hazy orange color with two fingers of head. A good amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is bursting with citrusy hops. It really leaps out at you and fills the nostrils easily. The taste is all hops baby. Lots of fresh juicy hops with great grapefruit flavor and nice bitterness. The body is creamy and thick. The drinkability is great, I would have never guessed this to be 7.25%. A flippin' fantastic IPA. Thanks to clvand0 for bringing this to our tasting!"
"Overall this is a solid beer that was probably better then most in its class when first sampled 6 years ago. It is not quite as tasty as offerings recently sampled from other breweries - 4.0. Definitely still recommend this brew if you get a chance."
" At first taste, a big bitter hop bite assails your tongue and throat right away before downshifting into a smooth and sweet malty middleground. Biscuity dry malt flavor is very pronounced and balances perfectly with the nice citrusy hops. There is a very slight alcohol warmth noticeable in the finish, along with a tantalizing lingering bitterness to lead you into the next sip. Medium body and quite smooth, not overly sweet, and quite dangerously drinkable. I did not suspect that this was a 7.5% brew. Nice lacing clung artfully to the glass until the last drop. More than delicious and heartily hoppy, another excellent Alesmith offering."
"Hoppy and very bitter fresh bottle thanks to xlperro. While very good IPA, its not significantly superior to many other good American IPAs I have had. Full mouthfeel with citrus and dough. Somewhat overcarbonated that with bitterness and pine and tad grassiness, set off my mouth. Good accompanyment to dinner however."
"The taste of this is a different story. A baeutiful burnt, bitter orange flavor opens up into pine and rosemary hops juice. There is just enough malt in here to keep the beer in check, but the hops are in charge, and they let you know it with a looong, lingering bitter finish. The hop burps are happenin' here. A smooth drinking brew with at 7%, and one that rivals the best IPAs I've had."
"But now I look at this review and I feel that I'm being overly harsh. Make no mistake, this is a pretty good beer. There are better examples of the style out there, however."
"220z. bomber: This lovely brew pours a hazy, darker golden color. Some head to it. The aroma is hops, and all hops, but not overpowering. Piney, citrus, floral and grassy. The taste is quite good. The taste is quite hoppy, but only somewhat bitter. The tastes are very well balanced. Some fruits in the aftertaste and the hopiness lingers nicely in your mouth. An excellent brew."
"Cloudy amber-orange, bottle-conditionned, smallish off-white head. Piney christmas tree aroma feels very green. Big coniferous seeds in the forms of C-hops make the malt appear very subdued. Taste is fresh and rather complex for the style. Orange skin, earth, and piney bitterness. Finish is long, hoppy, very dry, green, but perhaps a bit too alcoholic for its relatively low strenght. Hoppy all the way through, no mistakes about it. Medium to full body, moderate fitting carbonation. Id just have loved to see more of the alesmiths fabulous malt manipulations."
"Sampled from a 22 oz bottle provided courtesy of drewbage - many thanks! In the glass this is amber with a long lasting tan head. Relatively subdued, but extremely pleasant aroma of citrus & spicy hops - a nice blend between grapefruit & pepper in the hop aroma with some sweetness in the background. Hop resins aplenty in the mouth as this one continues on the same path as the nose indicated building on a sweet toasted caramel malt base with a blend of piney, floral, & citrusy hops. Moderately bitter & very well balanced. Medium to full bodied with a nice smooth creaminess in the mouth. A well-balanced & well-crafted IPA."
"IMO Not as good as Stone IPA but still very good."
"Wyll-"
"22oz brown bomber with a plain silk screen lettering of Alesmith IPA nothing fancy. This one pours a hazy darker orange color with an off white head. Descent retention and lacing as I drank this. Very hoppy aroma with notes of citrus and pine coming through but not overly hoppy. This one is surprisingly balanced considering the hopped up nose on it. Flavor starts with a citrus hoppiness with some piney notes and finishes with the hop bitterness. It has a definite spicy kick to it with a slight sweet malt in there as well. Very nice flavor to it, complex and lots to sort out. This has about a medium body with good carbonation and a creamy smooth mouthfeel. This one was a joy to drink too bad this stuff isnt regularly available around this parts or I would drink it all the time. Another great from Alesmith."
"Drinkability is awesome. It reminded me of Draednaught as it did someone else due to complexity and dominance of hop but it had just a bit more sharpness to it. Excellent beer deserving of all the praise it is getting."
"Hazy orange in colour. Off white, almost tan head. Thick and creamy. Hops, Hops and more hops on the nose. Hops explode onto my tongue. This hop rollercoaster quickly pulls in to superb balance. I let the yeast into the second classful and I would say it added welcome flavors to the brew. My first Alesmith, I am impressed."
"Quality, quality, quality. AleSmith IPA is neck-and-neck with my favorite IPA/DIPAs so that any differences in score are trivial at best. It isn't available in this state, but it is available on-line so that I have a ready supply if I so choose. And believe me, I choose in a big way. If you love IPAs and haven't yet had AleSmith's inspired version, it's worth whatever effort and expense that is required."
"Drinkability is questionable. This is a hop monster brew."
"A deep amber body was topped by an immense pillowy head. Scattered lacing adorned the glass. Nice hoppy aroma was not overpowering, just right. Very hoppy taste profile was at the same time quite smooth. Bittering was just right, bottle conditioning shined brightly on this one. Nice smooth mouthfeel reminded one of cask. Pretty powerful, but nice and drinkable nontheless. Good beer. Thanks to Rkhaze, a great guy who works at the Whole Foods I shop at. I'm glad he thought of me when in San Diego recently."
"This seemed to be on the verge being an Imperial IPA. Went great with the pastami and swiss on light rye from the local Italian deli."
"In all, this beer isnt bad to have 1, and I did rate it higher than I was originally thinking, but that is because I am thinking that bottle must have been a bit off. I would like to try this again and adjust my review. Said that, as of now, it was way too bitter and grapefruit tasting to want to drink many."
"The white grapefruit got to me after the first half of the bomber and while I would have this again, I might pick something else instead."
"The beer was shipped to me in a handsome bomber by eyedrinkale. When poured into my usual pint glass, it had an orange amber colored body with a 2-inch thick beige head and a lively natural carbonation. Head retention was excellent and there was a ton of lace left all around as the beer went down. Aroma was assertive with floral hops dominating the bouquet. The taste was a bit brash with a strong alcohol presence, which was not quite hidden under the hops as it should be. There were notes of citrus on the palette, but these were quite subdued. The hop bitterness was also relatively low; however they added a good deal of spicy character to the mix. The mouthfeel was appropriately dry and creamy for the style. Alcohol burn detracts a bit from drinkability. A nice solid IPA to be had here."
"Drinkability - yeah, it's incredibly quaffable! Lush, possessing a damn near perfect balance of malt and hops, it just doesn't get much, if any, better than this, IMO. I have the feeling it's going to be a long search for me to find a more enjoyable IPA than that brewed by Alesmith. Nectar in a bottle!"
"Extremely easy to drink and refreshing. Light bodied and tasty. Nice."
"A simply fantastic IPA from the folks at Alesmith. Though I feared my taste for hops was starting to wane a bit, this certainly brought my hop taste back, and hopefully I'll get a chance to enjoy this one again!"
"Drinkability: A very nice session beer."
"A slightly hazy amber body reveals golden highlights beneath a densely creamy head of ivory foam. The retention is good and it holds well before dropping to a wide collar and whispy surface covering. Wide rings and thin splashes of lace add to its appearance. The nose delivers bright piney, floral, and subtly citrusy hops atop a caramel-accented maltiness. The body is medium and its very fine, natural carbonation caresses the tongue before fading smoothly away. The flavor offers a brilliant balance of rich, sweet caramelish malt; subtle yeasty fruitiness; piney and citrusy hops; and a solid bitterness. It's alcohol never makes an appearance on the palate; and it finishes quite dry with it's bitterness lingering long after it's maltiness has subsided. Overall, an exceptionally well-balanced and drinkable west coast IPA."
"Thanks again to Eyechartbrew."
"Pleasantly flavorful. Peaches, grapefruit and lemons. This is hop juice. Great IPA."
"Pine, lime, and orange peel with a touch of celantro in the nose. Amber in color with a persistant white creamy head. Searing hop dominance with apricot fruit and pine and a tinge of grapefruit. Frothy and smooth in the mouth. Simply a wonderful IPA.. Big cheers to Boilermaker88 for making my Superbowl sunday."
"Drinkability: A super brew from Alesmith. Would love to add this one to my regular selections. Try this one whenever you can."
"Appearance: Copper orange amber tone with a large thicket of cream colored head lacing is thick and even beautiful appearance says you know you want some just take a sip. Aroma: Wants you get a sniff of this hypnotizing beer your ready for more and more piney hops earthy tones and floral scents that send you into a hop frenzy best of all very well balanced brew with a ton of malt exposure as well caramel malts layer on their effect to the overall scent. Taste: Simply amazing splendid blend of flavor the caramel malts give a butterscotch like sweetness blending only the ripest grapefruit citrus hops and floral nosed earthy tasting hops with the pine cone finish setting it off feels so nice going down this is my favorite IPA on the market I have tasted which says volumes about the quality of this product. Mouhtfeel: Medium to full in body excellent oily resined texture full of hop juices nice carbonation sends tickles to the back of the throat, awesome. Drinkability: As complex as this IPA stands it adds to the craving I have for each bottle to reach my lips pure sweet mixture of hoppy liquid equals a balanced uncannied by any other IPA I have sampled this one takes the cake on the realm of the master IPA."
"The King recommends drinking this beer with a quarter-cut slice of hot pepper beef."
"Nicely lingering finish, fully flavored, unstoppably delcious...seriously, this is one IPA you can sit down and get familiar with."
"I used to go back and forth between AleSmith, Marin and Racer 5 (Bear Republic) in deciding on my favorite bottled IPA. Now I'm convinced this is the best on the planet. I will gladly drive the 30 miles to purchase this product and have it in my refrigerator to entertain friends who appreciate a great IPA. AleSmith has the perfect balance of hops (especially hops), fruitiness, and malt character to make this the most sought after IPA around."
"Nice Tan head, carbonation is medium. The beer itself is a hazy amber color. The aroma definitely tells you that this beer is going to focus on the hops, I get notes of apricot and a pungent hoppiness. The apricot is the strongest aroma component, I like it. The apricot translates to the taste of the beer, it adds a bit of a fruity backdrop that interacts with the fruitiness from the ale yeast. A nice hop bit in the finish, followed by a clinging bitterness as a reminder of the beer that was just on my tongue. This is a nice IPA, not as extreme as some but I really like the flavor and aroma that is packed into this beer."
"Some Bighuge props going out to the LongBeachBum for serving up this one to me."
"What a great looking beer! This poured a very nice burnt orange color with a huge frothy white head that left nice spider web like lace down the whole glass. The smell was very strong on hops as expected, but they were a bit more pine like than I was expecting. There was also a nice toasty malt character peaking through as well. The taste was great, with a wonderful piney hop profile and just enough malt character to balance it out. The bottle-conditioning gave the mouthfeel a very smoothe character and not overly carbonated at all. If I had to compare this to any other IPA, it would be Stone IPA. This one leans more on the side of the pine flavors and is not quite as dry tasting as the Stone. Between these two, I think one would have an IPA for every occation."
"Note: A huge BA.com thanks to hopjack13 for this bottle."
"A bold IPA. Not heavy but not weak. An excellent mouthfeel. It is just supurb. It's drinkability is easy and this IPA could be consumed on a regular basis. Enjoy."
"Big thanks to Gusler who provided the bomber."
"Drinkability  This one is very smooth, almost light. The 7.25 ABV is unnoticable. If you like your IPAs smooth and even (as opposed to hairy and over-the-top) give this one a shot if you can find it."
"Brilliant copper colored beer, topped by a vanilla colored head that lasts an exceptionally long time. After the head fades to a thick rocky layer of foam, a sweet floral aroma becomes more evident. Very nice aroma. Wow, the taste is truly phenomenal, with a combination of malty sweetness, and hops so strong they seem to be both sweet and bitter all at once. Then comes the finish. The flavors seem to completely vanish, but then a slight piney bitterness is noticed lurking around, dragging a wisp of sweetness around with it. Mouthfeel is very solid, and this beer seems to just slide down the throat. Drinkability is also exceptional, as a bomber of this feels like much too small a serving. I opened this beer with high expectations, which is usually a recipe for disappointment. But this time, my expectations were exceeded, save for the length of time I thought I'd be spending drinking this wonderful IPA. I'm grateful to have gotten a bottle of this. Do what you must to get one of your own. It will be worth the effort. Wow."
"Pours a deep golden/copper with a small off-white head. Very fragrant; lotsa malts, lotsa hops. Taste is slightly sweet (but not like Hop Ottin') toffee malts and some hops up front, and then soon turning to all resiny hops that lead to a bitter finishes with lingering notes of cookie malts. Amazingly balanced and a big beer that doesn't feel like 7.25% until the bomber's gone and you stand up to dance around the lawn like a giddy little school girl. Cool bottle by the way too. It's Pretty Awesome (I get it, IPA!)."
"My first brew from the Alesmith line, and I like what I see so far. A good clear copper amber with nice head, the alesmith has been working hard. Oh, the aroma is ga-good. I detect the floral hops wonderfully, but a good presence of the malts, hints of caramel. Mercy, a good flavor as well, perhaps I should start my training as an alesmith. The hop bite is balanced so well by the malt presence and those tiny little bubbles that you read about on the bottle. Those little bubbles make the beer feel great in your mouth. I will be getting this again."
"After trying this beer from a bottle, I couldn't imagine it could be any better on draught. I was wrong. The amazing smell and taste are still there, with hops, biscuit, and a host of other goodies swimming around. However, the mouthfeel on tap is simply amazing. Don't pass it up, whether it's in the bottle, on tap, or spilled on the floor by the person at the table next to you."
"Medium brown color. Medium head. Aroma is hops, juicy, grapefruity and floral. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are nutty and sweet. But this is a hopfest of a beer: piney and resiny, citrusy and grapefruity, floral and spicy. Hoppy without being too bitter. Nicely balanced. Very smooth. Hides the 7.25% alcohol very well. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter."
"The taste doesn't disappoint. Sharp hop bite starts things out and coats my whole mouth. This is not a one dimensional brew though as the sweetness of the malts come into play to lend some balance. Pouring the rest of the bottle with the dregs makes for a much milder 2nd glass, but no less tasty. Finishes strong, dry & well balanced. Nice smooth body make for a highly drinkable beer. If I were to ever move to the west coast, this would easily become part of my regular rotation. Thanks to EyeChartBrew for this excellent offering from AleSmith. Cheers!"
"My favorite IPA. Great balance. Despite a significant hop presence, not bitter or dry. Alesmith is a wonderful ale. The smell and flavor are outstanding. Citrus leaps out of the bottle, both in smell and in flavor. Pours a deep golden color, large foamy head - good retention and plenty of lacing. I would strongly recommend this to any fan of micro IPA's. I've had stronger tasting IPA's, but this one hits it just right."
"Originally sampled 19 July 2002. Alesmith's IPA is hazy golden colored with a creamy white head. It has a nice up front hoppy taste w/ a clean finish. Once again, Alesmith has produced a very good brew. Alesmith's IPA has the taste & quality that's right up there w/ the best of them"

"This is an outstanding IPA! The freshness of this ale knocked me off my feet as if I were drinking it at the brewery right out of the tank. A beautiful coppery color body and a beige colored head looked beautiful resting in my glass. The aroma of a piney hoppiness hit my nose as soon as I raised my glass. And the flavor was unbelievable. I can only remember one other time I had such an outstandig ale and that was in a brewpub in Boston many years ago. Wow I can't wait to have another!!!"

"Words don't do it justice. If you haven't tried this one, get ahold of some right now. Somehow, the flavor profile is laidback and huge at the same time. Well done Alesmith!"
"Pours golden with a light, fluffy head. Tremendous hop (fruity) aroma. This beer is beautifully, lightly malted with a huge hop flavor that keeps going. As a complete hophead, I really enjoy the complex hopping of this beer. Light to medium bodied mouthfeel is crisp and quite appropriate for an IPA. Although this beer is not quite balanced (malt to hops) enough for a non-hophead to drink all night, if your into the hops you'll want more than just one of these. A truly flavorfull beer!"
"Golden-orange hued brew topped with a massive head that stays quite well. Impressive. The aroma is of ultra-piney hops with an underlying sweetness of malt and a little vanilla. Again, impressive. Oh, the taste! What perfection! Very hoppy with the piney and bitter hops, but so malty smooth at the same time! Sweet cereal-with-sugar type maltiness, and vanilla once again. Malty smoothness is mostly in front, the hoppiness shows up best in the middle, and in the finish it goes back to the malt. Hops are a little leafy and resiny in the aftertaste, quite pleasant. Wow, I've been waiting for a very long time to sample AleSmith's beers, and it was well worth the wait. This is one of the very best IPAs out there. If it's available to you, get it! If it's not in your area, try the AleSmith site. Mmm... can't wait to get more!"
"Pours a slightly chill hazed copper, with a huge pillowy white head. The persistent head leaves rings of lace all the way down the glass. Aroma is resiny, with grapefruit and pine dominating. Flavor is not at all what I was expecting based off of the aroma... begins with a clean malty sweetness, that quickly gives way to a hefty dose of grapefruit, then finishes with a spicy herbal bitterness. Mouthfeel is rough and oily, with a medium body. I think this one could use a little more malt balance, but nonetheless, it's a good IPA."
"Sunset orange in color, mostly clear, with a big two-finger head that leaves a massive amount of lace down the glass. Very fresh, citric hop aroma. The flavor is undergirded by a very lightly sweet malt, with both caramel and biscuit-like flavors. The hops in this beer are incredible. Citric and piney, they are at once aggressive and understated. Just perfectly well-integrated into the beer. Exceptionally well-balanced, with a medium body, a luxuriously silky texture, and a dry finish. Bravo!"
"Pours a great looking deep golden/light copper color with a perfect looking 1/2"" sticky white head that slowly sinks but never falls below a thick meringue-ish film that completely coats the inside of the glass. Big piney hoppiness is all over the aroma in this one. Almost resiny/hoppy aromas make me want to tip this glass up as soon as possible. Initial tingly hoppiness hits the tongue before a quick biscuity malt burst that drowns all else out for a moment. The creamy biscuity malt becomes more and more apparent as the brew gets warmer. Excellently balanced brew with a great piney and citrusy hoppy flavors through the finish with some light, just right, lingering bitterness. Smooth with a great crispness. The medium bodied smoothness really comes out once the brew hits about 60° or so. Absolutely excellent brew, I could drink this stuff all day and probably will do so if I ever get out to their brewpub. A huge thanks to the LongBeachBum for sending this sample along."
"Vintage 2002: The pour a somewhat murky deep amber to burnished copper color with a bright white monster of a head that as it depletes, leaves a thick and clinging sheet of fine lace. Quite floral with a crisp lemon like tone that also is slightly sweet, also nice malt tones, a complex and pleasing nose to be sure. Could that be actual hops floating around in suspension? Ambrosial front with lots of malt and the top middling in mouth feel. Finish is devilishly hopped, satanically carbonated and dry as Hells kitchen. This is an ""IPA Lovers IPA", and not meant for the ""Palate Challenged"". Trust me on this one if your a ""Hop Head", this is a must try, the hops just keeps coming back and back."
"Citrus-pine aroma, man this is one for the hopheads, amber-yellow color with alot of yeast floating around, very hoppy yet balanced as well, man this is one hell of an IPA, so for I really like this brewery."
"NOTE to Self:-  STOP Judging Beers by the Bottle Design!!!!!!!"
"This beer can't get top honors in appearance. While the cloudy amber body is excellent, the head is slow to form and fades rather quickly. For the style, I've come to expect big, lasting heads. The thin bitter hops are truly balanced by the nice big biscuity malt. Some IPAs have a complex hop flavor where they're more than just bitter, but the profile on this one leans more towards the bitter with subtle piney and malty citric notes. The pine gets stronger as the beer warms. I also picked up a nice organge fruit flavor as well that made this a pretty good beer."
