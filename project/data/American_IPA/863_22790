Taste follows with a touch of honey like sweetness and big grapefruit flavor.  Simple but very good profile.  Nice bright carbonation and a dry finish.

Not as refreshing as Pliny but very quality. Pours a clear dark orange with bright white head and lacing. Smells of pine and fresh mountain foliage with a hint of citrus hiding. Very refreshing but if given the choice I'd give the nod to Pliny.","dutesanch","Jan 18, 2015"

4,-8.5,,,,,,"Fresh aromas of tropical, fruity hops, peach, orange and mango, along with honeyed pine and smooth caramel - finely nuanced with hints of citrus peel. Fresh, fruity hops are hovering above a sweet, honeyed malt backbone, while hints of lime acidity becomes detectable underneath. Hops sting the palate in a refreshing, dry fashion, without ever getting too aggressive. Honeyed, piny, malts wrap up the hops in a well balanced way, along with wisps of whitebread and grass, still, this beer is huge on the bitterness. The taste results in a smooth, dry ending, which is very bitter and hop driven, as malts tend to vanish. Finishes with hops lingering on the palate for a long time, developing a fascinating pleasant depth, as they turn from being fruity to a more bitter, dry impression. A classic IPA, focused on the bitterness, fantastic balanced.","aleigator","Oct 29, 2014"

The flavor is juicy grapefruit, peaches and bitter citrus rind, supported by a malty, bready backbone. The mouthfeel is sticky and resiny with a slick finish. Overall, this is addictively good stuff that you dream about, much like other Russian River offerings.","Antnego","Jul 29, 2014"

Great clarity, great carbonation, great taste, less filling, where do I stop? This is what all breweries should strive to brew. Once you have one every other beer in the workd is at least a little disappointing. No joke. I am ruined. Until I can get back to Santa Rosa that is.","Spordy","Jul 19, 2014"

Perhaps it had more punch when it was just-out-of-the-brewery fresh. May have to wait until my next trip to Cali to find out. Still and all and as is, exceptional for mouthfeel, balance and refreshment value, worthy of its current #101 spot on the BA top 250 brews.","scotorum","Mar 07, 2014"

Pours to my wine glass a mostly clear golden copper color with a very creamy one finger white head on top. Classic grapefruit and pine aroma, some mango and pineapple, more pine and grass. Flavor is sweet tropical fruits behind massive pine bitterness. Resinous mouthfeel, medium carbonation, and extremely smooth. I do see why this is so loved, and it is quite a fantastic IPA with a lot of heft despite the lowish ABV. Good stuff.","BMMillsy","Mar 04, 2014"

Thin white collar remained throughout. Medium bubbles and carbonation. Color was light orange amber, but mostly clear. What swept me off my feet here was the lovely nose -- perhaps the best citrusy, piney grapefruit nose I've ever experienced, with subtle hints of orange, mango, and papaya. On the palate -- pine, pine, pine and sweet bitter grapefruit. Just fabulous! A textbook IPA in structure, with voluptuous sexy flavor profile. Hops are strong, but not overpowering, and alcohol is totally masked/subdued. Mouthfeel is good & chewy. Overall impression is as impressive as any IPA or DIPA I've ever tasted. If you don't absolutely love this, then you've obviously got your head up your ass.","JohnParadee","Feb 17, 2014"

4.05,-7.3,4.75,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a clean, crisp golden color with orange tinges. It forms a head of eggshell white bubbles of a medium size, which sit nicely above the beer at about a half finger’s width. In body, the beer is clean and clear with just a touch of haze. On the nose, the beer smells of big orangey pine. Smooth caramel malt blends over the rich hop aroma, giving a sweet kick to the citrus nose. Touches of grapefruit and citrus rind also make their way into the nose to suggest the more bitter qualities of the beer. The smell is not overly pungent, but is nice and nuanced. On the tongue, the beer tastes nicely bitter with a smooth sweet backbone that brings rich balance to the beer. In terms of Pliny, I feel the bitters more in Blind Pig but I know there are less bitters overall than there were in Pliny… Citric acidity is also found in the taste, and is light and playful on the sides of the cheeks. In flavor, the beer begins as aspirin bitters and then opens into rich, bitter grapefruit and orange. Wisps of toast and caramel dance on the sides of the palate, but this beer is all about the bitters, which are strong yet balanced. The finish is of fresh orange juice with a touch of bitter aspirin and grass. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium with a gently prickly, higher carbonation and a crisp, snappy mouthfeel. It leaves the mouth dry with a light bitter resin and some saliva in the cheeks. Overall, Blind Pig is a great, classic IPA. It is all about the citric bitters, which I really enjoy. Terrific balance is seen here, similarly to Pliny, but in a way that seems to accentuate the bitters more. Head to head with Pliny, I think I liked Pliny more, this is a solid beer with great flavors, but doesn’t really wow me in any way. It drinks like a classic IPA, which it is.","Maxwell","Dec 24, 2013"

The beer is an orange and golden amber that is clear and filtered. Even though the head quickly dissipates, the beer still has some creamy covering. The beer smell has citrus and orange hoppy notes. However, the smell has a bit of lightly roasted malt as its backbone and a hint of pepper as well. The beer taste is very different from the beer smell. The lightly roasted malt backbone is more prominent with a grapefruit hop taste as well as hints of pepper and other mineral taste. The beer has a medium body with clean smooth feel as well as a clean aftertaste feeling. The beer has biting carbonation. A pretty good and unique IPA that I would like to have again.","HattedClassic","Nov 18, 2013"

Lots of retention and lacing. The aroma is incredibly intense. Unbelievable. Makes me wonder what I have been drinking all these years that called itself and IPA. I get some pine (Simcoe?) and citrus on the nose. Slight floral accent is there, too. The wonderful thing about this beer is it does not taste like so many hop bombs I have had lately. I would describe the bitterness as medium and just toward the low end for the style. Finish is long and smooth. No harshness, just lingering bitterness. A pleasantly light sweetness balances the bitterness perfectly. The texture of the beer is creamy like the head. Medium body and mouthfeel is lightly tingly. Unlike some beers this beer does not improve as it warms. It is best drank in the first 25 minutes. Overall, a terrific beer. I intended to knock this beer down, because I am sick of all the hype surrounding the brewery. I came away from this beer with incredible respect.","chickenflea","Oct 20, 2013"

Thick rings of lace. Looking good. Nose is thick orange peel, rich citrus, melon character. Approaching an 8 for nose. Taste is sharp, bitter, lots of citrus rind. Nice stuff, could use some extra butterscotch thickness. Perhaps a little dry with nice hints of kumquat and meaty jackfruit. Nice refreshing, lighter mouthfeel. 3.7 is about right.

I wouldn't hesitate trading for this again and I like the fact it's bottled in pint bottles. The price would put a halt to buying as much as I'd like but it is a delicious IPA.

The nose presents potent notes of caramelized sugars, malt, fresh citrusy hops and subtle grapefruit. It's definitely more reserved than I'd expected; more aromatic hops would have elevated it to my expectations, without significantly altering its status as an AIPA. I think it drinks very well, distinctly malty with fresh hops lingering on the palate. It's drinkability and mouthfeel are really where this beer excels (in my opinion) presenting a rich, clean malty sweetness, layered citrus hops, and a mild, lingering bitterness that coats the palate. No grapefruit rind aftertaste, good effervescence, and a touch of caramel. Great beer that I'd soon consume again if bottles were available my way.","ThePorterSorter","May 26, 2013"

4.38,0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall: Pliny's big brother (being that this is Vinnie's original IPA) does not disappoint. It's a nice sweet but not cloyingly sweet IPA that is very hoppy yet is not overwhelmingly bitter- it all comes together very well to make for an interesting, easy drinking experience that is truly refreshing- it doesn't feel watered down at all. It just exchanges excess, unnecessary (IMO) bitterness for more hop flavour (not that much different than Pliny vs super bitter DIPAs) and apparently that's what I prefer on any given day.

4.52,3.4,4.25,4,4.5,5,5,"OVERALL: Blind Pig is a beautiful IPA. It's easy on the stomach, has great head, and is very juicy, but not overbearing. This is what IPA's were like before the ""Hop Bomb"" era. Thin, balanced, and drinkable with a perfect amount of citrus spiceness and all of the tonal flavors you'd expect from a West Coast IPA and the IPA style in general.

A hint of sweetness that balances it out. The taste is refined. The hops are in balance but certainly center stage. No strong malt notes or sweetness in the taste. You get light pine and some citrus rind. There is enough bitterness to let you know you're drinking an IPA. Well made beer, and certainly worth seeking out.","PHBoiler","Apr 12, 2013"

Light to medium bodied and easy going down the hatch, the hops are dominant and have a great earthy, citrusy and grapefruit taste along with minimal fruit sweetness. Beer is balanced by sweet and dry malty backbones, and finishes not bitter but dry and crisp and makes you want to have another drink. Skirts the edge between overly hoppy/DIPA and just a right balance for an IPA between hops and malts and is an excellent brew.","clayrock81","Apr 06, 2013"

4.13,-5.5,4.25,4.25,4,4,4.25,"It's a really nice looking beer, pours a largely clear yellow-orange with a medium fluffy white head. It's got a really nice sweet citrusy hop aroma with bit of biscuity malt lurking as well. The flavor isn't quite as citrusy as the smell would indicate. A semi-sweet biscuity malt hits first which transitions nicely into a nice hop bitterness. The flavor doesn't blow me away, but it's nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall this is a well-crafted IPA that is rather on the bitter side, it's not too sweet or citrusy, but comes together nicely.","starrdogg","Jan 25, 2013"

Smells like citrus and fruity hops, sweet grapefruit, fresh cut grass. The taste mirrors the smell with fruity citrus up front and finishes w/ grassy, earthy hops and lemon rind. The taste is a little weaker than I would have expected. The body is light and slightly watery, very little carbonation to speak of. I enjoy the flavor of this beer, just wish there was more of it. A little too thin in my opinion but still leaps and bounds better than most normal-strength IPA's out there. Glad I got to try it.","mattsdenney","Jan 20, 2013"

4.72,8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a deep gold with mild carbonation. A finger of foam with good retention, nice thick even lacing. Fantastic looking beer. Smells of strong hop and grapefruit, pine, citrus, tropical fruits mesh together well with a modest malty backbone. Very pungent and rich, very reminiscent of Pliny, all the smells a good ipa should have and then some. Tastes of strong hops, pine, citrus with a sweet bready malt coming through. Flavors meld together nicely, nothing over powering anything else- very nice balance in this beer. Mouth is also consistent, medium body with a mild carbonation tingle. Resins coat the mouth with a strong bitter dry finish. Overall one of the best ipas made on the west coast, really glad I was able to get a few bottles of this. The freshness no doubt playing a role, but this would still be great even after a few months. The things I'd do to have regular access to Russian River beers!","lordofstarside","Dec 14, 2012"

Hops, citrus; hoppy finish. Somewhat muted, like a watered down Pliny the Elder. OK, but don't see the point. I'm not getting the same positive experience as other reviewers.

The beer poured out as a nice golden color with a brilliant white head on top. The lacing is nice a sticky on this one. The smell of the beer is piney and full of citrusy hop aromas. It smells so refreshing. The taste of the beer is also very nice, hopped up like crazy with a clean malt backbone. The mouthfeel is very sharp and crisp with a strong carbonation to it.

Brew has big hops, crisp start, pineapple, corriander, some slick oil in the finish. Real good crisp finish that has some tart bitterness. Very drinkable brew here, a standout .

A finger's worth of bone colored foam caps the beer and displays both good head retention and lacing. The nose is one note, but intense. The aroma of straight pungent, bright grapefruit creeps from the glass and reaches my nose well before the glass does. Every sip greets me with a touch of candy sweetness, before a robust, perfectly dialed in bitter bite comes in mid palate. There's plenty of grapefruit, as promised by the aroma, on the back end, and it's joined by a secondary orange flavor. The mouthfeel is picture perfect. The body is light and lean, with just enough heft to support the bit of malt flavor that's present. The carbonation is bubbly and expressive, aiding in the massive impact the hops have. Blind Pig doesn't get as much attention as the other IPAs in Russian River's portfolio, and that's shame, because it's a hell of a beer in its own right.","axeman9182","Apr 28, 2012"

Regardless of my review or comparison to Pliny, this is a must try. Thanks to Tucson25 for this extra.","azdback","Dec 18, 2011"

The taste is rich in tropical hops. Pineapple most notable here. RR makes some of the best beers on the planet. They have an uncanny ability to make great hop forward beers that actually have some balance, not just dumping a bucket of hops in and calling it an IPA. Wonderfully carbonated and light to medium body. If I lived in CA, this would be a regular for sure at 3.99$ a bottle.","Koufax21","Dec 03, 2011"

4.38,0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a yellow-amber-orange color, very effervescent, with about a half fingers worth of white head. The head slows into a nice layer on top of the brew, lasting the whole way down. It also leaves gorgeous rings of lace down the entire glass. The dominating scent i am detecting is citrus. To be more exact, peach, orange, and lemon rind. There is also a nice hoppy bitterness to it. Taste follows the nose, citrusy up front, but a sharp hop bitterness keeping it in check. It is followed by a slightly malty flavor that keeps everything balanced. This is very carbonated, but not overly-carbonated, just how i like my IPA's to feel. You can feel the bubbles dancing on your tongue. This is another solid brew by Russian River that I am glad to say that I can find just about anytime that I want.","BrewtifulMind","Nov 05, 2011"

3.65,-16.5,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Dr: Very drinkable and of nice quality. Thought it's my least favourite style, I'd readily have it again - especially if it were offered on draught. It's not as special as other beers from Russian River, but it's wonderfully hoppy and pleasant. It will satisfy true fans of the style; this is an IPA done right, not the ""dump as many hops in as possible and call it good"" school of brewing.","kojevergas","Oct 22, 2011"

4.38,0.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: I always remember Blind Pig being a good IPA, but perhaps it never got the attention it deserves from me due to it's elder. This really is just a fantastic American IPA, and I could totally see myself grabbing this as a session starter. This does minimal damage to the palate, and you still get to enjoy all the joys of a fantastic IPA. If you want all the flavor of a great beer, and still be able to taste later offerings, then grab a Blind Pig. However, it doesn't quite have the punch that others achieve in style. That said, this has that trademark Russian River balance that so many of us applaud.","Cavery","Sep 04, 2011"
4.2,-3.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"poured from bottle into RR tulip. This was bottled 18 days before consumption. Pours a pale golden yellow with ever present lacing and a 1/4 inch head. The smell of hops is the first thing that hit me. A very enjoyable beer. The taste of piney hops with just a titch of malt sweetness. A little dry, but very enjoyable. I will continue to search out this beer and will trade for it often.","biglobo8971","Sep 04, 2011"
3.61,-17.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"O: This is a good IPA but not outstanding. I was expecting more from the hype that surrounds it. Maybe that is the problem though. I had too high of expectations. But it is worth giving a try and I definitely wouldn't turn it down.","Msquared2","Sep 04, 2011"
4.08,-6.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Certainly not my favorite IPA that RR makes however it's still a very flavorful and balanced one at that. Bright, clean, bitter and balanced, this is yet another beer that reminds me exactly why I love the style so much.","ShanePB","Sep 03, 2011"
4.15,-5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O) Drank my first bottle of this last weekend, after enjoying my first bottle of Pliny. I'm glad I had another bottle of Blind Pig, and that I held off on the review.

4.11,-5.9,5,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall this is a fantastic IPA. I would drink this all the time if it were readily available in PA.

4.13,-5.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"O: While not as perfect as PtE or PtY, this is in it’s own right a little brother of both of these and is a great IPA. I got nothing else to say other than it’s not PtE/PtY. Must...drink...MOAR! 4.5","julian","Aug 29, 2011"
3.51,-19.7,3,4.5,3.5,2.5,3,"Thin, weak body and not enough carbonation. I'll be generous and give a 3 for drinkability despite pouring most of my glass back into my brother's. If you like single IPAs, you will probably love Blind Pig.","brystmar","Aug 28, 2011"
3.92,-10.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O- Good IPA. Not sure if it's A good, but still a solid ipa. Could definitely drink more of this. Thanks Duff27!","kawilliams81","Aug 27, 2011"

4.02,-8,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"D - Close to the quintessential IPA. Delicious citrus flavors with a huge hop bite. Great aftertaste and excellent drinkability. The alcohol is well masked. I wish I could find this in bottles, it could become one of my favorite IPAs.","mooseo","Aug 22, 2011"

4.33,-0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Tasted this at a beer festival at the Tustin Brewery in Tustin, CA. It was a fantastic festival and Blind Pig was tapped out very quickly.

4,-8.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall a solid but straightforward IPA I think, not that blown away by this however. Good beer no complaints but feels like a one trick pony. But I will get on this ride anytime.","smakawhat","Aug 17, 2011"
4.19,-4.1,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall - Definitely my kind of IPA. Lots of citrus and a nice clean and refreshing taste. It is along the lines of one of my favourites: Bells Two Hearted - but with a touch less sweetness. It has a fantastic balance and its very drinkable. If only I could get this stuff all the time.","spinrsx","Aug 17, 2011"
3.97,-9.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Found in at Clems bottle house in a 500ml bottled just 10 days after the bottling date, how is the for fresh AB. Poured into a tulip glass since no pints available. Poured with minimal off white head that did not stick around and had little to no lacing during drinking. Smell provided great floral herby notes right from the outset that struck around nicely. The taste was another solid ipa from Russian River, not over powering but a great hop character with good malt balance. Think I may like this as much as some of my favorite west coast brews for a warm summer day. Mouthfeel was full but not viscus with a clean finish.","jnezda","Aug 14, 2011"
3.85,-11.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Definitely a tasty one. Came across as a bit on the light side (aroma & flavor), but that can be expected when drinking Blind Pig side-by-side w/ PtE. A pretty tasty IPA to enjoy earlier on in a session!","mdvatab","Aug 13, 2011"
4.34,-0.7,4,5,4,4,4.5,"Had a pint at the Monk's Tavern in Philadelphia. Fantastic nose of bug, citrusy, piney hops. Some tropical fruit and caramel malt as well. Nice appearance. Off-white head with good lacing. Flavor is similarly hoppy and delicious. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a fantastic IPA and one I would certainly enjoy having again.","AaronHomoya","Aug 11, 2011"
4.52,3.4,3.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"OVERALL: My notes say ""Good lord, this is an excellent beer."" I had tried it once before, but I was distracted and not paying attention to the excellent aroma and mouthfeel and certainly not appreciating the complexity of flavor. Of course, I'm not completely sure until I do a side-by-side, but I may like this a touch better than Pliny. Either way, it's a buck cheaper a pint and a little easier to track down.","StoneTSR","Aug 09, 2011"
4.25,-2.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Great beer, but I miss the potent, yet smooth blast of pine. I would also like this beer to be more dry. The extreme fruitiness elevates the sensation of sweetness as it is.","aficionado","Aug 05, 2011"
4.05,-7.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"taste - still a good blast of pine on the hops, the citrus almost dissappears and is replaced with more grassy/earthy notes. really nice mouthfeel, good clean finish leaves you wanting more.","robbrandes","Aug 04, 2011"

4.07,-6.9,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"On tap at the Mayor, this is one of the classics in my opinion. Smells of piney aromatics, little citrus and hardly any malt. One of my favorite parts about this beer is the malt bill seems so simple. Vinnie lets the hops run the show. After drinking about half my glass my palate gets used to the bitterness, I am enjoying all of the hop complexity. Really loving the lacing as the glass continues to drain. A true classic IPA. Can't wait to drink another...","pkeigs","Aug 02, 2011"
3.71,-15.1,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O: Tastes good, is well constructed, a nice refreshing summer beer, but not a stand out. This seems more like a pale ale or bitter, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Just that I was expecting more of a hop parade.","pmarlowe","Aug 01, 2011"
4.48,2.5,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall- I know I probably shouldn’t be comparing this to a pliny, but it being from the same brewery I don’t really know what else to compare it to. Definitely not in the same league as a pliny but definitely does come close, a little more bitter and more resin and pine flavours coming through and not as well balanced as its cousin I found. It does hit every typical IPA note but that’s what separates this from its big cousin the pliny, whereas the latter has such a nice balance and some added unexpected flavours, this one just comes through with the typical IPA flavours, and punches you in the taste buds with them, very bitter beer all the way till finish. Very happy I got the chance to try this though and I would definitely drink this one again in a heartbeat!","Roke87","Jul 30, 2011"
3.2,-26.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Pours a strangely-light clear straw with a quickly receding head. Not the burst of hops I expected. Really subdued. A bit watery in the mouth, with a strange, harsh finish. Some nice characteristics, certainly drinkable, but absolutely below-average. I’ve had a dozen better IPAs in the last week. I have really enjoyed Russian River, but this is a strange offering.","JAXSON","Jul 30, 2011"
4.28,-2.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Enjoying my first pint at Capone's. Very nice. Smoooh IPA. Virtually no head, but lots of lacing. A very light, refreshing beer. Would recommend, especially to thee that are typically adverse to IPA's. First of several IPA's to review today.","Retail1LO","Jul 30, 2011"

4.12,-5.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Appearance is a pleasant golden color with a one finger head. It smells of pine, hops, and orange peel. While the taste has some of those components continued, there is also some caramel, grapefruit, resin coming through. The body is pleasant and easy with some bitterness in the finish. BP is a very good IPA and worth checking out.","mltobin","Jul 24, 2011"
4.37,0,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This one was bottled 4 days ago. Nice! Pours a clear, pale, golden color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is very hoppy with some lovely pine needle notes. A bit more of a malt aroma than I remember from past bottles I've had. Taste is Initially really clean hop flavor. Nice bitter pine flavor with some tasty citrus notes. Some nice grapefruit. Finishes with crisp bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with some crispiness. Drinkability is very high.

Loads of fruit, a bit of a caramel-sugar cookie sweetness and a bitter pine finish. Smooth and bitter feel, with an immense drinkability.

He appeared overdressed at each of his assignments and, being blind, was hardly the pig for the job, yet somehow his panache and particular sense of aplomb put parents at ease. “I know you tire of little kid stuff, here’s flatulence jokes in this movie Grown Ups!” The children two stepped in syncopation loving their blind caretaker and tugging at the tails of his tuxedo lovingly.","SubpoenaDeuces","Jun 22, 2011"

Nose was typical of a solid ipa/borderline apa, piney hoppy bitter notes, citrus was mostly lemon and a nice bready note. Taste was very refreshing and easy drinking pretty much following the nose. The hops brought a slight floral character along with a touch of grapefruit and a pleasant forest note with a good malt backbone. Very well done i just find that pliny and blind pig are both very good beers i was just hoping for more complexity out of them. Blind pig to me really tasted similar to pliny with just a different malt bill.","Trilogy31","Apr 30, 2011"

Initial taste has a hint of sweetness going into strong pine hops with a bit of grapefruit. A little bit of orange as well.

Perfect balance of toasted caramel malts giving it just the right amount of sweetness. The sweet caramel and hints of honey, along with the perfect amount of bitterness coming from the hops was just was like a symphony on the tongue and an overture for the nose.

The flavor is riddled with pine cones with a slightly sweet and bitter grapefruit aftertaste. It's definitely a solid IPA.

Again, I'm picking up hits of mango and pineapple as well and grapefruit and citrus peel. Slight earthy resinous hops balance out the sweetness and their is just a touch of pale malt to balance out the bitterness. The ABV is extremely well masked makng this delicious beer dangerously drinkable. Highly recommended!","corby112","Dec 29, 2010"

This is a wonderful hop bomb without the sugary sweetness that usually accompanies this level of hops. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but not at all unpleasant.

I love the spiel about the blind pig, I never caught the connection with the namesake of this white whale. Aromatics are amazing the highlight of this fine single IPA super grapefruit, floral aggressive West Coast hop additions. There's also a touch of vegetal/onion notes but not overbearing this stuff is nice. This stuff is fresh from a shipment from South Bay Drugs, bottled 9/29/10. It doesn't get much fresher, I just ordered the Pliny they just got in as well. Flavor is excellent bitter dry finish up front hints of cracker semi sweet malt tones wrapped with fresh bursting hops. The hop flavors provide herbal, dry grassy, citrus in this case grapefruit, and a touch of floral veggie notes. Super dry bitter finish this stuff is ideal for drinkability. Medium bodied slightly slick with hop oils, mild easy going carbonation with a bone dry finish. Drinkability overall is killer a beer I could buy a keg of and introduce mainstream beer drinkers to hops, but why waste this nectar on newbies.

On the palate this is a bit aspirin-y, a nice, medium body and a finish that's almost crackling with resin. If I have any complaint it's that the dryness is almost a touch much on top of the resin, leading to a bit of an empty mid-palate. This is quibbling. I love it. Less than Pliny the Elder, and it's far superior to their standard IPA (""far"" being relative, that's a solid beer as well).

The aroma on this is absolutely amazing, like fresh-baked pineapple upside cake wafting from an open window on a hawaiian ranch. The taste at first is wonderful, just a flood of flavor with a feel of almost impossible balance of water and creaminess, facilitated by the beautiful bead on the bubbles.

The hops come out early straight to your nose with the first wiff. A nice piney citrus smell with a tropical twist. The taste is what I love most about this brew. That same citrus and pine that hit my nose comes through in flavor. The hops come in right away with this one with that nice citrusy taste upfront and a long finish. Not too overwhelming but enough on the palate to keep me coming back for more. Good feel on the mouth, a bit thin but a great crispness to it.

Minimal retension with slight patchy lacing effect. The nose of this brew is both herbal and slightly citrusy. The flavor has both citrus an herbal bitterness as hinted by the aroma. The malt backing is a very clean grainy character that imparts minimal sweetness. A lingering flavor of the grain and hop bitterness is left in the mouth that increasingly gets more herbal as the brew warms. Medium feel with a modest level of carbonation.","stakem","Aug 02, 2010"

It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this is a very nice IPA. Another one from Russian River that I wish it were available in my area.

Nose is loaded with hops and some other items, some sweet pear and maybe some vanilla..Pretty nice and very robust aromas. Flavor is like the nose - very robust and hoppy. This is a very ""Crisp"" tasting IPA. Flavors are forward yet not overpowering. Like biting into a pear flavored apple, if that makes any sense. Beautiful hop character to this. Evolves from one hop bite to another seamlessly. This is really good beer, but VERY hop forward, like many West Coast ales. Finish is long and bitter in a good way. Great beer, but at $4.29/pint+9 oz. it's not what you might call inexpensive...worth it though","SolomonGrundy","Jul 27, 2010"

The nose is resiny and herbal with hints of pine, grapefruit, tangerine, and orange peel.  The taste is all West Coast with huge piney, resiny hops up front, balanced out nicely with a solid malt backbone.  Hints of bitter orange peel, grapefruit, tangerine, caramel, and grass.  The mouthfeel is crisp and tingly with incredible balance and a nice bitter, dry finish.  Overall, this was fresher than my first taste, and it definitely made a difference.

Appearance is nearly perfect, a radiant, clear golden copper color with active carbonation supporting an thick off white bubbly head that coats the glass in rings of sticky lacing and has great retention. Aroma is bitter and hoppy, with mild citrus sweetness, but dominated by citrus rind and earthy bitterness. The pale malt backbone provides a sturdy, yet unobtrusive balance to all of the hops. Mouthfeel is also perfect for an IPA, creamy, medium thick, well carbonated and smooth. One of the best examples of an American IPA, loads of bitter hops that are infinitely drinkable.","yourefragile","Jul 08, 2010"

Hugely aromatic, very fresh grapefruit and vine aromas--hops rule here. Taste is equally dominated by the grapefruit citrus hops, giving it a crisp edge.

A very tasty beer, brings you all over the hop map, good parts at least. Worthy of the hype, or better than the lack thereof at least. Not quite as good as Pliny though.","jlindros","Apr 22, 2010"

The latest batch seemed a bit harsh on the back of the tongue, a bit of a surprise to the usual smoothness and dryness in the finish. The smell is really the best feature. Beautiful.

3.99,-8.7,3.5,4.5,4,3,4,"Pours a nice golden/orange color, with a massive head, 2+ cm, even with a gingerly pour. Looks loose and billowy. A cloud of haze descends on the beer, perhaps leaving a little bit of chunky yeast in suspension. Overall, nice looking. Also leaves some very sticky lacing. The smell is that floral, citrus hoppiness. Lemon rinds, grapefruit rinds, some leaves and pollen, resins. Pretty good. The taste starts out with a little citrus bitterness, then follows with a kind of powdery sweetness. There is some malt here! But the hops are definitely winning, comes on like citrus rind, then you start to get the fruitiness, and a bit of pine and resin. Definitely a West Coast IPA, without question. Finshes dry and a bit grassy, but not overly so on either account. A nice beer. My biggest complaint would be the thin body. It is surprisingly thin bodied, not like watery, but there's no real stickiness to it, just a nice kind of denser than water feeling. The carbonation is lively, quite so, but doesn't sting too much. The beer is very good, one that would probably become a staple of my fridge if I were just a few thousand miles closer to the brewery. I found myself coming back to it, over and over, to have a little more. If only I could get it a week old, instead of a month old, though life could be much worse.","taylorhamrick","Apr 16, 2010"

Pours orange with a nice, rocky white head. Eventually reduces down to a cap and leaves some decent lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles and a little bit of sediment on the first pour, lots of it on the 2nd. The smell is excellent, very tropical and hoppy. Hops, citrus, pineapple, mango. Definitely reminds me of Sculpin, maybe even more potent. The taste doesn't quite live up to the nose but this is still a very good IPA. There is still some tropical-ness there but it seems to be mainly citrus and grapefruit. The balance of the hops and malts is perfect. A caramel/bread aftertaste starts to show towards the end. The mouthfeel is very good as well, light but creamy, no alcohol taste, great carbonation level, very easy drinking and enjoyable. This is what I expected and maybe a bit more.

Nothing from the malt. The flavor is likewise one dimensional. Citrus hops do shine however in this hop display. Fresh citrus and pine flavors. I would of liked some malt to balance this out a little. The body is on the lighter side but has very good carbonation that gives this beer a nice texture.

Fluffy, white head, good retention and lacing, golden and pretty clear. Smell is strong of citric and pineapple hops, a weird deep spruce smell too (if that makes any sense). Very floral. Taste was good but not as bitter as I expected. Nice balance of citric hops, a piney bitterness on the back of my throat. Slightly dry and bitter aftertaste.

Raw, leafy hop cones cross the palate with some citrus & spice before a solid, caramel malt sweetness balances it all out. A slightly stale biscuit note mingles with some wood on the finish, possibly a side effect of the 3 month old bottle's ""age"". Still, the mouthfeel is one of the highlights. Russian River knows how to craft an IPA that finishes effortlessly clean and crisp, with just a hint of lingering bitterness. The medium-thin body is very refreshing and drinkable because of that.

Aroma has faded a bit, bit I pick up the piney, grassy hop aroma. The taste follows that piney/grassy hop profile, and has luckily held up well. Unfortunately, I there is not enough malt to balance it out, and if I am going to be overwhelmed by hops, I prefer the citrusy route. Very dry in your mouth, crisp, as well. A little less dry, and maybe earthy, and this would be a bit smoother drinking. Obviously a well built beer, but I prefer a different route on my IPA hop selection.

There's a toasty crispness to the nose, the white and pink grapefruit accents penetrate but not violently, retains some honeyed bread crust and cereal aspects, light guava, pineapple, nectarine fruit scents, the malty smoothness is sneaky and mostly before it all dissolves, mainly milk chocolate powder. Medium-bodied, a touch lighter than expected given the expressiveness of the nose, the carbonation more broad than fine, lifts things like an air balloon rather than hang glider. The grapefruit, tangerine, lemon citrus sweeter here and, by the same token, the malts more present and soothing. More grass and grain than bread or cereal, a measured rawness to it.

The thing I am most struck about is how divine this is on tap compared to its bottled brethren, even when the bottle is relatively fresh-I saw RR products at John's Marketplace that had been bottled within the last 10 days. I did a comparison later with the bottle version, and the keg won hands down. The best comparator I can think of is Bridgeport's IPA, which is high praise.

Overall this was super clean and tasty, with a fresh hops flavor reminiscent of HopSlam. Not overly bitter, and great body, so it was pretty easy to drink.

Bitter feel does develop more as you drink but it is more of a mouthfeel as each additional sip douses the bitter. Mouthfeel is only a soft bitter hue.

The bitterness is actually pretty scathing for an IPA. Jagged and rough. Hop flavors are more in the background, with some lemon rind and grassiness coming to mind. Malt load could use a little boost to add a little more balance, a little more body and a little more flavor. This is decent. Although Smelling the beer was the climax of this experience.

The piss and vinegar is still there but it is beautifully mellowed with a sweet melon and apple accent over a very mild malt base. This really becomes highly drinkable after the first few swallows.

There is a malty backbone that lets it have some balance. This pig is medium bodied with decent carbonation. It goes down very nice. Probably the best IPA I have had, it is a DIPA with a lower ABV.","bonkers","Dec 28, 2008"

A side by side comparison of this versus the Pliney the Elder revealed that this beer had much better hop flavor, a preferred balance, and superb drinkability. The beer showcases the hop flavor and aroma beautifully with a delicate, strong balance of fresh grapefruit, orange zest, lemongrass, pine, and a clean resin-ey bitterness. This is all woven into a very malty, but lightly flavored caramel-barley malt base. The body supports the hops and sweetness well and doesn't interfere with the hop flavor at all. Finishes very clean, light, and with a long lingering hop flavor. Bitterness is somewhat light, but lends to great drinkability.

It is a bit one-sided with hops...could use a bit more malt backbone for balance. There is a lingering bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied.

Personally I think Furious is a better beer. The bitterness is about the same but Furious has a better overall flavor to me.

Many many thanks to my big sister, Christian for tracking it down during her stay in San Diego. Poured in to a snifter so as to hopefully rouse some of the aroma. Beer was served just above room temperature, chilled is a good way of putting it. Appearance is a cool gold, and heading is about one finger. The head quickly fades in to a thin white lacing with good retention. Oily hops come to mind first in the aroma, then come citrus fruits such as pineapple and tangerine. Mild earth smells also show themselves to an extent. Taste is composed of grassy hop resins, bit of tobacco, cream and orange jump in at times. Mouthfeel is intense in its bitterness. It leaves the tongue feeling a little numb. Malt presence could possibly be lifted a bit to balance the hops, but overall this is still hardly a problem. Blind Pig strikes me a being a session IPA for people who really bitter, hoppy brews, I wish I had a few more bottles. Final thoughts: This is a very solid India Pale. I wasn't exactly blown away, but that is fine. Instead, I am left feeling very satisfied and refreshed.

Just like the nose, the taste lets you know there's hops in here. Bitter hops prevail with notes of pine needles, lemon, grapefruit, lime and orange peel followed by a nice mildly toasted caramel malt backbone. Slightly oily on the tongue with medium carbonation and body. Wow, this went down rather quickly.

Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and tangy with hop presence. The piny character lingers nicely. A real easy drinker. The 6% ABV is well integrated and quite sessionable. Wow!

Each element is fairly restrained, for example compared to the Russian River IPA, where the grapefruit tends to dominate all, and the hops are nicely complemented by the sweet, raisiny-fruity character of the malt and alcohol. In sum, it has a lot of character and a lot of flavour, with the rich range more than making up for the relatively restrained nature of each element, a wonderful trait all too rare for IPAs. It's highly drinkable and great with food or alone.","Offa","Sep 15, 2008"

4.47,2.3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Hazy dark gold with a two finger cap of light beige foam off the pour. About a finger's worth stuck around for a long time, producing some slightly chunky lacing. Lots of pine in the aroma, a bit powdery too, with notes of pineapple and various citrus fruits (grapefruit and lemon mostly). A little malt sweetness made itself known up front, but this was quickly joined by hops, citrus and tropical fruits, then gave way to a solid grapefruit bitterness that lingered long into the finish. Quite a depth of hop flavour, wave after wave hits the palate yet doesn't seem to dull the tongue. Medium bodied with a rich texture, plenty of carbonation that leaned towards some creaminess, sort of dry too. Great stuff. This is the type of balance I like in an AIPA, hop flavour and bitterness front and center, but with a malt backbone that doesn't wither under the lupulin onslaught.","DrJay","Sep 13, 2008"

Drinkability is second to none here, as this one is chuggable as hell. Overall a very very good IPA that I would love to have available locally.

The taste is hops galore with grapefruit stinging the tongue with bitterness up front and pine resins lingering on the palate at the finish. There is a hint of the bready hop background, but the hops steal the show here. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and sticky with hop oils.

Taste is very strong fresh cut grass and pine with a dry peppery malt taste and grapefruit rind bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium body with a creamy carbonation level. The hops and mouthfeel makes this an IPA you can get addicted to. Diffently a border line double IPA with the amount of hops and high IBU taste but not with the big malt content and alcohol alot of doubles have. AS an american IPA for sure the hoppiest out there with great balance and flavor to boot.","sfoley333","Aug 01, 2008"

Aroma is a nice sweet citrus aroma of grapefruit, tangerines and mangoes. A softer sweetness of cotton candy accentuates this and a strong grassiness in the aroma as well. Taste follows with a good amount of lemon, grapefruit, and citrusy hops as well as a large dose of grassiness that cresendoes towards a good sized bitterness that is also slightly peppery. Mouthfeel is light to medium, prickly hops and carbonation on the tongue up front transisition to a peppery bite at the back and a drying finish.

Very well balanced at first, perfect hop flavor, lots of grapefruit, lemon, orange and pepper notes. The after taste is of sweet hops balanced by light malts.

Flavor hoppiness and bitterness is very bold and impressive, and lingers in the finish very well. The hops are raw, pure, well utilized and again, they linger well after the swallow. Flavor hops are similar to the nose and can best be described as very woodsy. A minor critique, it doesn't have a lot of body, but the finish makes up for it.

The hops are very well balanced by some malt that leads to a beer with a bitterness/dryness but also a touch of sweetness.

Super hoppy beer, with lots of sticky resin. Big pine taste with some lesser citrus notes, especially orange, for balance. Much hoppier than most other ipas I've had and absolutely delicious. Long, lingering bitterness. I wouldn't exactly call this balanced, but it does have some malt backbone for support. Its just that the hop attack is so relentless that the malt gets a little overwhelmed. Who cares, its great. Mouthfeel is perfect as well. Good body, perfect level of carbonation, and ends with a spicy creaminess. Love this beer, but it definitely burns the tastebuds out a bit. Use in moderation.

4.17,-4.6,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"In the flavour, the balance definitely leans towards the hops. Grapefruit citric acidity becomes extremely piney with a lot of aniseed and fennel backed up by a light crackery malt and just a little bit of vanilla as well. This beer bites real hard.

Big piney and grapefruit hops waft from the glass, so you know what youre in for. The hops take over your first sip and really show no mercy to the malt in the background. A bit unbalanced. This is straight up, O.G. West Coast IPA style. Lots of grapefruit and pinestraw. Good body with a clean, crisp and pretty dry finish. IPAs have come a long way since Vinnie first brewed this in the mid-90s, but this still holds court with the better ones of today. Cheers to a legend.","alohaC","Apr 06, 2007"

4.77,9.2,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"I had this one on tap at RR on Saturday and actually preferred it to the Russian River IPA and Pliny the Elder. Drank from a pint. Appearance is similar to their other IPA's, hazy yellow amber with some gold and some darker reddish hues. No head thanks to the Neanderthal behind the bar. Smells of cascade and a bouquet of floral and piney hops. Taste was excellent. A wonderfully rich combination of bitter pine, fruity hop, and some mouth-watering candy sweetness. It was similar to Pliny but had a rich backbone of fruity syrup that made it stand out. Mouthfeel and drinkability were excellent as with all RR beers. This was definitely one of the best IPA's I've tried lately.","uberabr","Feb 20, 2007"

As good as it smelled, I had no idea the flavor would come across as exceptional as it did. In fact, this beer would be, far and away, my top session IPA were it not so freaking rare in my area. It's so clean that having another is an animal instinct. I almost never have two of the same when I'm at Monk's, but this specimen became one of the rare exceptions. Should I ever get near this again, I really doubt I'll drink anything but Blind Pig. Until it's gone, or I'm gone.","Foxman","Feb 12, 2007"

I had a few beers and blind pig was the my third favorite behind Perdition and Damnation. Blind Pig was an easy beer to drink. I thought it was smooth and full of flavor.Though I am new at being a beer nerd, my taste is more for a seasoned vet. I never enjoyed y yellow macro brews but still drank the more popular dark beers everyone had. Russian River is by far my favorite brewery and they don't have a beer I don't dislike.

Hops are, of course, also the key players in the taste with notes of fresh pine, juicy citrus, and grapefruit rind. Definitely on the bitter side, but there is some sweet malt to help provide some balance. A must-try for the hop-heads.","Morris729","Sep 15, 2006"

4.54,3.9,4,5,4.5,5,4,"On tap at Toronado. Tasted side-by-side a pint of the Elder. My first impression is shock that this IPA has considerably more about juniper/pine than the 2xIPA from the same brewer. This beers aroma is intense, painful even. My tongue is freaking out as if I were about to dip it into a vat of citric acid. The juniper in this aroma is just plain ferocious. Inhaling Blind Pig is like having a bully grind your face into a juniper bush on the playground. My eyes are starting to water. Taste is more about sensation then flavor. It stings, it burns, it pricks, it bites, it kicks, and it growls. Beyond that and the thick pine oils I can taste pineapple and apricot but thats about it (I dont mind one but. This rocks). Finish is light, dry, and citric. Body is on the lighter side of medium. Appearance is similar to Plinny the Elder, just a tad lighter shade of golden amber leaning toward yellow with a thinner, shorter lived white head. Outstanding IPA, not for the faint of heart or hops. Just damned adventurous.","DaPeculierDane","May 22, 2006"

I was pleasantly surprised how light in color this beer was. Big hop nose, grapefruit pine a little floral hop. You cant really detect the malt in the aroma. Taste has a lot of the grapefruit rind. The pine and hop flower, I caught in the aroma were present as well. This beer really presents all of the hop characters well. It has a light sweetness that lingers throughout.

4.72,8,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Hand filled 22 oz bomber using counter pressure filler. The beer pours a nice orange color with copper highlites. Clarity is awesome. A light slightly off-white head sits over top, with a very nice cascade of bubbles keeping things solid over top. Aroma on this one is great. Very solid chunky candied grapefruity sweet hop with a moderate caramel and light spun sugar sweetness in there. Everything about it is sweet. Flavor is nice as well. Hop flavors are dominant, with the same sweet grapefruity citrus, with a light touch of pepperyness over a soild sweet caramel malt base. A few moments after swallowing the beer, a very clean bitterness hangs on the side of my tougue. This one is very much like a baby brother to the PtY. It has all the flavors and aromas of the big boy, but just to a lesser degree. Very tasty and very well balanced between sweet malt, hop flavor, and hop bitterness. The feel is a solid moderate with a very solid carbonation of fine bubbles to keep it from being too thick. As far as I'm concerned, this is another home run. All the flavors play very well with each other, the nose is really full and enticing. This 22 oz bottle is not going to last very long and is going to get me one step closer to planning that trip to California. Awesome.","kmpitz2","Mar 21, 2006"

Flavor is what the nose indicated, lots of hops, but just enough malt to take the edge off, with a nice cuttingly bitter aftertaste.

The aroma was much milder than I had anticipated, with a floral-citric hop smell vaguely reminiscent of Mangos. The taste was citric, sugary, and a little soapy. Body was light and airy, and the hops faded quickly after each sip. Like the rest of Russian River IPAs, this was lighter in body than the strength on the label suggested. Unlike the bigger beers, the lightness of the body had a slightly detrimental effect on the single IPA, where more character is usually better than less. An easy to drink beer, that left me wishing it was a little less simple.","rajendra82","Feb 26, 2006"

The taste is hoppy and spicy with some lovely bready notes, and some great piney spiciness from the hops is there as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit fuller than that of the regular IPA and the drinkability is damn good as well. This and the regular RR IPA are twins and they are 4.5 twins as well.

While most of their IPAs (Beerocracy, Parking Violation, RR IPA) seem to be related to Pliny the Elder with strong grapefruit citrusy notes, this brew appears to be more closely related to the ambrosia-like Pliny the Younger with a sweet note complimenting a more subdued citrus flavor.
