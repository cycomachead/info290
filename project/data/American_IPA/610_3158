Taste is similar with light malt sweetness followed by a wave of high hop bitterness and some rye spice on the finish. Individual flavors that I enjoy, but the combination in these proportions seems off. Medium-full bodied, creamy and sticky, soft carbonation, bitter finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 14, 2015"

Achieves such a fine balance of malt and hops to the point where you can almost pick one or the other to focus on, but both are still respectfully present.

4.86,14.9,4.5,4.75,5,5,4.75,"I'm in love with this great brew and need to get more ASAP! Pours a dark copper with a modest head and a small ring like lace that retains throughout. It seems that this one is unfiltered as you can see some sediment. No problem, as it does not affect it negatively. The aroma is malty sweet with hints of caramel, chocolate, syrup, toasted bread and a tiny bit of alcohol towards the end. The taste is a malt lover's dream. A firm malt backbone with toasty bread flavors and caramel. Yet, this sweetness is never at risk of being cloying. Make no mistake about it, this one is also a bit of a hop bomb. This is evident in the finish and aftertaste which is a perfect marriage of dry, bitter and sweet. There are also elements of spice coming from the rye. I like my IPAs to have a good balance between hops and malts and I'm so impressed by the perfect balance this one has achieved. What a feel! It is full bodied and chewy yet so drinkable. I just finished it and I'm sad because I wish I had more. Reminds me a lot of dogfish head IPA 90.","Gajo74","Jan 26, 2015"

Resinous and dankiness from the hops counteract some of the sweetness. I'm really digging the soft bitterness from early addition hops.  For how sweet the beer starts out it finishes somewhat dry possibly because of the rye in the grist. Some nice subtle spiciness is detected in the finish combined with some cereal grain finish. Nice beer, a little sweet for me. Medium body w/ perfect carbonation allows all the flavors to shine and lends very well to the drinkability of this brew. If your going BR, give me a Red Rocket Ale or Racer 5 please. Good brew non-the-less.","mac31","Oct 01, 2014"

The micro sediment is barely noticeable in its nice amber tone. And even though I was the dumbass who sniffed this one too close and got a nostril full of head to bring some water to my eyes, I am not judging the "smell" because of this. The scent is light, semi-sweet, and gives but a hint of what the flavor really can bring. For the price and the availability, the Hop Rod Rye is definitely worth its merit. . . Just don't snort the damn thing. . .","Valley_Town_Sipper","Apr 15, 2014"

5,18.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Not going to give the same ole type of review for Bear Republic's Hop Rod Rye. No way! This is my most favorite beer in all the lands. From the opening aromas of rye and hops gently wafting into the air, to the wonderful dark pour and oh so wonderful rocky, creamy, off white head that stays with you like a best friend, and leaving the most wonderful lace, to the malty/bready/caramel rye flavor and truly perfect balance of hops and carbonation, to the finish that begs you to take another sip, this beer is king. Bear Republic is a brewer that has never let me down. Hop Rod Rye is hoppy rye heaven in a bottle!","TonyC","Apr 05, 2014"

This offering pours a rich caramel brown with a very generous thick beige head that lasts throughout the pour. The aroma is malty and spicy. Definite rye notes, toffee, pepper, spice, floral citrus, and light coffee notes. This beer is chewy and coating in the mouth. The flavor is what really sets it apart. Rich and malty, spicy and bitter, sweet and deep. It hits all the right notes. If this is a kin to all of Bear Republic's offerings then I greatly look forward to a long and enjoyable relationship.","lochef81","Jan 19, 2014"

It smells very rich for lack of a better term. The beer is initially sweet and a little fruity up front, less carbonated than most IPAs, and then the real profile starts to set in. The rye is very rich and malty but the hops really define the aftertaste. Very dry and very bitter finish. A little flat and syrupy but a really nice balance of the rye and the hops definitely would purchase this one again.","BearslikeBeers","Jan 07, 2014"

If you like hoppy beers, however, you will probably like this beer.","silverblaze540","Dec 22, 2013"

I had a bomber of it previously and was disappointed, mostly because I was wanting more of an imperial marzen, but I’m finding this is actually closer to that than I'd previously experienced...just with tons of hoppiness. Pours a rusty brown with some cloud to it – I love how Bear Republic’s IPA and now this have some cloud. I’d like to try more of their stuff but those two are all I’ve found in CO. Decent head that breaks down in a couple minutes and laces the glass. Smells hoppy and sweet, with citrus and pineapple to it. The flavor is where the rye comes in, giving it some heartier grain and malt, cherry and light spice, along with the hop bitters. Has a medium mouthfeel, leaning heavy, and the alcohol is present but not offensive, especially for being as up there as it is. Works well with the flavors. Overall, really glad I tried this again. I think the first time I was so affronted by the hops that I couldn’t get past it to enjoy the rye aspects, but this time around, definitely enjoying the combo. Will definitely get this again.","BeerWizard","Nov 10, 2013"

4.31,1.9,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"Overall, the best thing about this beer was the incredible showcasing of rye grain, with its unexpected smoke and hidden darkness to it in the taste. The grain is so prominent that you actually forget about everything else, especially the hops. That is not to say that the hoppy side is missing, because if you stop and think about it, they are as strong and forward as ever!! This just speaks to how deep and intoxicating the grain bill is here, as it really will take you by surprise if you let it. This is due, in part, to the rich and sweet fruity inclusions that meld so well with the grain bill. In evaluating the hops, they do show an excellent oiliness and variety across the spectrum of flavor, with great dimensionality. In the end, this guy may be a bit booze heavy for some, but it is an undeniable classic that we’ve ignored for far too long, and one of Bear Republic’s best.","TheBrewo","Nov 04, 2013"

Pours lightly hazy deep ruby copper color with a 1 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, orange zest, lemon zest, orange rind, caramel, bread, spicy rye, floral, pine, grass, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, pine, caramel, bread, spicy rye, floral, grass, and floral earthiness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pine, caramel, bread, rye, floral, grass, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Awesome balance and complexity of hop flavors with moderate rye presence; with a fair amount of malt balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent rye IPA! All around great balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2013"

4.42,4.5,3,4,5,4.25,4.25,"poured a dark amber in color. The mouth feel of this beer is slightly chewy in texture but is very refreshing on the pallet. Has a medium to high hoppy flavour to it with good hints of fruity and citrus tastes. The rye added to this beer gives a very unique taste and aroma. The aroma itself has a slightly heavy quality to it and in the pour it had very little head to it. Due to the taste and aroma however I give this brew a two thumbs up and would recommend this to any drinker who wants to experience a good beer that isn't too harsh, it is a very kind and rewarding drink.","AleEnthusiastSorensen","Sep 18, 2013"

A nicely balanced beer between the hop profile of the Racer 5 and the sweet rye malts. It was very delicately balanced and a nice drinking brew. If you are a fan of the Racer 5, be sure to check out the Hop Rod Rye Ale.","brurevu","Sep 17, 2013"

It's just a matter of finding a way of getting it here where I live. Easily 1 of the 10 best tasting brews for me personally I've ever had. It has a bit of everything for it and I'm extremely glad I picked it up. Bear Republic is becoming one of my favorite breweries and I can't even get their brews here. They are definitely pumping out some of the world's best tasting brews and I look forward to getting my hands on more Hop Rod Rye.","BradtheGreat7","Sep 16, 2013"

The taste brings in more of the same, with the pine coming through a tad sharper. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.

4.21,-0.5,5,4,4.25,4,4.25,"American IPA or DIPA or rye IPA?!?! Who the hell knows? So judgement based primarily on not pinning it down to a specific style. Great spicy bitterness from the rye and amazing hop presence throughout. Not much balance so I can see why many would not identify it in the DIPA category as a strong malt backbone is required by some to qualify as a good IPA. I can't pin down the style and can easily identify it as all the 3 I mentioned as well as dare I say an American strong ale to boot. Good solid beer my only qualm and it is a small one is I tried this in a 22oz bomber and the mouthfeel and flavor seemed to dissipate on the last 1/2 of the bomber. Not sure if this is available in 12oz bottles but if so I would like to re-visit it in that format. Nonetheless no matter the "identity" of this beer it is a very satisfying experience. Couldn't taste the alcohol at all but after finishing it and typing this up it is slightly sneaking up on me. Excellent job Bear Republic!","Jekyll","Jul 12, 2013"

The hops and rye are the highlights of this show, but they are balanced by a nice base and the flavors, while aggressive, are not out-of-whack or ridiculously showy.

While Racer 5 is my personal favorite, this may be, objectively speaking, the best thing I've had from these guys. None of these flavors conflict with each other, and the rye provides a spicy, rustic flavor that is a breath of fresh air for the style. Extremely well crafted, and world class in the realm of hoppy rye beers. I'd love to have this on tap or fresh one of these days. This is a charm to drink any day of the year on any occasion.

I'm excited to smell the rye in the forefront; even though it's an IPA, I'm really getting into rye beers lately. Taste is deliciously subdued; this isn't a hop bomb, but it has a nice hoppy flavor at first, melding into rye flavors and then finishing into smooth, caramelized malts with a bitter hop pinch at the very end of the aftertaste. Alcohol is well-hidden for 8%; drinkable and delicious.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 20, 2013"

I have no idea how old my brew is, but I'd venture to guess it's been sitting for a bit because that bitterness didn't quite seem to reach the level that everyone else is boasting.

Nose is typical IPA, pleasant grapefruit, but slightly bready from the unique malts used. First sip is surprisingly mild. The rye malts come through strongly in the middle and the hops aren't as pronounced. In fact this is one of the sweetest IPA's I've had in recent memory. As such the alcohol is almost undetectable. Not a hint of metal or lingering bitterness form the hops, just a really clean finish. Almost ESB-like in its smoothness and balance. Nice hefty body too. An instant favorite, I think!

Taste is a bit spicy hop and rye, but quickly mellows out to a really nice brown sugary malt with a great almost sweet hop balance. Some citrus and more pine notes, but mostly sweet sugary malt. Really nice finish and mouthfeel. It smells very aggrestive and "hot" but it actually is very well balanced and finishes nice.

Taste is very smooth, bitter throughout, some grapefruit and nice sweetness in the background on the back end. Insanely drinkable for a high abv, no alcohol anywhere in the tasting.

The taste is just about tailor made for me - it's got a huge hop kick along with a massive amount of rye spiciness. There's a bit more of a pine flavor in the hops than the nose let on, which works excellently with the rye. This is a big and brash beer, which is perfect for me. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and has that hop dryness that can only come from a massive amount of hops. The drinkability is superb. Overall, Hop Rod Rye is really a beer that's just about tailor-made for me. I love rye beers and huge IPAs.

4.33,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"been meaning to get on this one for awhile. this is a monster beer. hands down one of the most hoppy and most complex rye beers ive had. it pours a deep indian brown color with just a bit of haze. looks pretty dense, with some light coming through, but not much. theres about a one inch off white head on it, but it recedes pretty quickly. the nose is very very hoppy. sticky sweet dank hops, oily and aggressive. theres also some spice from the rye, bready and pungent, as well as a darker sweeter malt profile than i expected when i bought it. the flavor is unreal. so much going on. at first sip its a hop trip, high alpha and mean, but that gets interrupted fairly quickly by a really distinct and different peppery rye flavor that comes out of nowhere and lasts the rest of the time. sweeter malt kicks up at the end, and the bitter aspect of the hops finally comes back. the finish is long and complex. this is a gem as far as flavor journey goes, more rye heavy than any ive had i think. mouthfeel is good, big and thick on the body, with enough carbonation to make it dangerously drinkable. there is some hop resin left in the mouth though that is a love it or hate it kind of thing. i think it makes the beer come across a bit heavy, but thats just me. this is a perfect cold weather beer, with all the necessary elements. high abv, big hop, lots of body, and stick to your guts malt. this is worth the hype for sure.","StonedTrippin","Oct 09, 2012"

Finish is quite nice with dry graininess and a light minty grapefruit. Feel is lightly syrupy and chewy with a nice smooth carbonation. A great robust beer that rewards sipping but begs you to keep it up so seductively that the glass is empty before you know it. Very drinkable and no real notice of the abv so watch out.

Flavor is actually pretty complex with both toasted and caramel malts, rye breads, orange peel, red apples, candied fruits, earthy hops and a mild pine presence. Medium body and moderate carbonation. I like the Fruitness which isn't too sweet with and excellent base malt and rye character.","kylehay2004","Sep 11, 2012"

Smell is sweet rye with faint hops. Taste - first thing that struck me was a definate note of buckwheat honey. This is probably the mix of the sweet malt and darker rye malt but if you've ever had buckwheat honey, it has a very distinct flavor that is what this beer reminds me of. Also notes of toffee and very nicely balanced hops. Mouthfeel is slick and coating, goes down smooth. Rated the best Rye beer for a reason. Wide distribution and reasonable price point makes this one that I think will be a constant in the cooler.","plumcrazyfx","Jul 05, 2012"

Hops dominate the smell, with citrus and pine. The taste is more balanced - caramel sweetness from malts, spiciness from rye, bitterness from hops all combine for an interesting flavor profile. Piney hops are more noticeable than other flavors. Mouthfeel is prickly on the tongue. Very enjoyable, and one of the better rye beers I've had.","DeltaGolfSierra","May 14, 2012"

This is mirrored in the taste, although there is some resin flavor in the finish. The nouthfeel is sticky sweet, but I would've liked a little more carbonation, which was on the lower end of the spectrum. Overall an enjoyable beer. I was expecting more obvious rye, and a little bit more hops to counter the heavy malt charter. I also would have liked a little bit more carbonagion. I was underwhelmed with this one at firdt.

The malt profile plays a prominent role in the taste - sweet toffee, bready, and spicy flavors are all present. The big malt body is balanced by a fair amount of piney/citric bitterness which seems to hit hard at first then mesh nicely with the malt leading to a long, pleasant balanced finish. The rye is detectable and lends a nice layer of spicy earthy complexity to the malt profile but doesn't overwhelm the beer. This full-flavored ale is also moderate to full-bodied with a slightly creamy and oily mouthfeel. I fear this may have spent a bit of time on the store shelf before I picked it up, but it still proved to be a great rye beer.","MattyV","Mar 06, 2012"

The smell of the beer was more hoppy than anything else I could pick up on the nose. The taste of the beer was also quite hoppy, I was hoping to pick up on some more Rye than anything else but I continue to struggle with picking up the Rye in most beers. The aftertaste is bitter and yet sweet almost all at once. The mouthfeel of this beer was pretty nice, well carbonated, stings the tongue a bit, leave a bitterness on the sides of the mouth.

A great hop profile of an IPA, perfect balance of caramel malt base for a pale ale, rye used as a spotlight spice, and the sweet tones laced within a bitter back end make this one of the best you can ask for. This is my fallback rye, and a bit of a standard for measurement.","paperbackfoster","Oct 28, 2011"
4.5,6.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Wow, what took me so long to try this. Pours a nice two inch head into my chalice, brown sugar colored foam and rich dark brown body. Smell the malty richness with pine needle accents. Taste is very complex for this rich IPA. Malty carmel not any rye bread taste, thankfully, but bread like as far as the body of this beer goes. A wonderful hop sandwich with a suntan. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodies, better than a stout. Overall one of my favorite American IPA and certaijnly challenges Arrogant Bastard for best in show. WIll be seeking this one out for future mini sessions.","jhtipton","Oct 28, 2011"

The beer does have a big ABV, and while that is not obvious, after a few of these, and an 8% ABV, you will feel them when you stand up. With a label like that, I wanted more. Not upset, just wanted more. Either way, wherever you are tonight, bottoms up!","rickyleepotts","Oct 24, 2011"

Depending on what you were looking for, though, this might not be your perfect "American IPA." That might sound like a strange comment, but hey, just trying to put this beer in context. It reminds in some ways of Hop Czar from Bridgeport, but with a tastier malt/rye background. I like this beer a lot and would recommend it. It's not one that I will usually pick over others, but I get why this is so popular. Try it!","olfolxholme","Oct 11, 2011"

American IPAs are one of my favorite styles, and although this isn’t the best one I’ve had (my top 2 being Sculpin and Stone) it is very good in its own right and certainly worth a try. I recently had Bear Republic’s Racer 5 IPA, and I think this one is far superior. Definitely worth checking out.","zac16125","Oct 06, 2011"

4.38,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This one poured a lot darker than I was expecting. It has an unfiltered haze to it along with a nice big, tan head. The nose is most notably sugary, but the hops and the grains come through as well. I haven’t had many ryes, so I am still figuring them out. I do feel a difference in the body. For an 8% beer, it seems like this beer should be much heavier; somehow the rye has a less oppressive presence than a heavy malt version. The beer is very caramely, but then bitter hops to follow to round this one out. I cannot get over the clean feeling this beer has in the aftertaste. This brew boasts a great aroma, crisp yet complex flavor, and a clean bite finish…easy drinker considering. Note: This beer only contains 18% rye, so it isn’t a dominant flavor.","beerdown77","Sep 26, 2011"
4.05,-4.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a very nice ruby red with a bit of a purplish hue in there as well. Slight off-white head. Aroma of pine hops, hints of citrus and big bready and caramel notes. Flavor beings with bittering pine hops before moving to to sweeter grapefruit notes. Huge, thick caramel malt comes next and stays until the finish. Hints of black cherry and raisin as well add to this really big malt that battles with, but complements this well-hopped brew. Spiciness and more bittering pine hops finish this one out with some rye shining through late and more as it warms. Really thick, substantial, yet drying mouthfeel.","uustal","Sep 26, 2011"

4.62,9.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: What a ride! I would have never guessed that this beer would have fit my exact taste profile so perfectly, but it most certainly did. Hoppy yet sweet, roasty yet fruity; this really should be a more powerful force in the beer world. Hop Rod Rye is destined to go down as one of my “desert island beers,” and that is not something I take lightly. Keep ‘em coming, Bear Republic.","BarryMFBurton","Sep 22, 2011"
4.33,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The taste starts with a lot of sweet caramel malt, and a lot of rye grains, some brown sugar, into some nice hops, probably some Zeus hops along with the more common west coast varieties. Nice citrus, grapefruit, floral and bittering elements. Medium bodied and wet.","Tballz420","Sep 18, 2011"
4.41,4.3,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"22 oz bomber poured into Sam Adams glass. Pours a deep amber with tightly bubbled 3/4 inch head. This beer is beautiful to watch as rivulets of lacing cascade down after each sip. Caramel aroma with citrus hops. Very well balanced malt profile hides the 8% alcohol nicely with fantastic pine/citrus hop blend. Really like the way this dances lightly on the front of the tongue but finished off rather thick. Overall I'm a big fan of this beer and Bear Republic. At 8%, I'm not sure why this isn't considered an Imperial IPA. Maybe the most impressive aspect of this beer is the price - a world class Imperial IPA at $4.99 a bomber!","coldriver","Sep 18, 2011"
4.33,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall this is a very good and intriguing beer. To me it tastes like a good American Strong Ale with a shot of bourbon thrown in for good measure.

Taste is all that, a little subdued, but good. Easy drinking for it's abv, wish I new the age of this beer. I think it may be on the older side, for a hop head like myself. Nice body, would like a little more life in it. This is solid, but wanted more out of it. Will definitely get some again.","SawDog505","Sep 18, 2011"
4.39,3.8,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: really interesting twist on the American IPA style. Pretty abv for the style, and fairly well masked. And for 2.59 it was a steal for a custom six pack.","minterro","Sep 17, 2011"

4.47,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A slightly chilled bottle is split between two pint glasses. Big brown head tops a dark copper liquid. Some visible carbonation. There's a very pleasing aroma of citrus hops and rye. Very good flavor! Bitter throughout, but never too strong. I'd describe the hops as having citrus and pine characteristics. Rye is tasted and gives a good kick. Despite the higher ABV, there is any taste of alcohol. It goes down very easily without much coating. What is left behind has some rye spiciness that I like.

4.25,0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours a nice reddish color with a big off white head that lasts a while, laces the glass as it recedes and leaves a cap on the beer. the smell is definitely hoppy up front pine and fruit notes, followed by the rye malt aroma. the flavor follows suit lots of hop flavor and rye malt with a nice bitter finish and a little bit of fullness form the malt. mouthfeel is definitely a little more than i was expecting but it works. overall a very very good beer.","rowingbrewer","Sep 13, 2011"

4.95,17,5,5,5,4.5,5,"O: This is a keeper!! Abundantly available here, even in the groceries, It is reasonably priced and a real hop-hog. I like this beer to no end!! At 8% ABV, almost a DIPA and a sessionable on at that!! To the bear I say: RRROOOAAARRR!!!","Emerson1310","Sep 06, 2011"

Don't remember it being this boozy smelling. Definitely can taste the alcohol as well. Bitterness comes first then the malt, bringing some caramel and booze, followed by citrus hop finish with a twist of rye. Surprisingly alcoholic. I guess I didn't know it was 8% before..Those crazy Californians. Probably won't get another bottle of this til I know it's a different batch.

It had a nice refined taste to it of barley malts and hops on the front end followed by more hops and a hint of citrus. There was a fair amount of lace left on the glass when i was finished.

4.25,0.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a deep red, with some nice mahogany hues. An offwhite head of a couple fingers forms, leaving some nice lacing and moderate retention. Nose holds rye, tropical fruits and some grapefruit. A beautiful malt profile, holding rich caramel, rye bread and graham cracker notes. Taste has again some nice rye and caramel character, bitter grapefruit and orange again. Strong lingering bitterness. Good full mouthfeel, light to moderate alcohol notes and exceptional drinkability, a sort of IPA+ due to the ABV. Quite excellent and I can only imagine this being divine on tap, as I believe freshness may have detracted from the fulll experience here.","liamt07","Aug 15, 2011"
3.23,-23.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"The feel is a little sticky with decent carbonation. A little heavier than I would like. Overall not to bad here. Nothing really exciting. The rye is good but the other flavors are simply underwhelming.","Bendurgin","Aug 14, 2011"
4.05,-4.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O: Good beer although I was surprised to see this in the IPA category. I would have pegged this as a hopped up red ale. At any rate, this is a very tasty beer that I'd be happy to drink again.","titosupertramp","Aug 12, 2011"
4.03,-4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This is an exceptionally hoppy beer. I have yet to try any other bear republic beers, but this is certainly a good start. Strong and hoppy, it fits the standards I set for a beer well, and has an attractive dark color. I have had smoother beers, but overall it goes down relatively smooth with a hint of carbonation (but not so much as to make my stomach bubble). I have had better beers, but this is certainly fairly high on my list.","fastd03","Aug 12, 2011"

Taking a sip from my pint glass and I am hit with some malts and hops, first off. From there, there is a sweetness from citrus and maybe some caramel. More malt and some bitterness also hits the palate. MF is med-heavy. Alcohol content on this one can easily sneak up on you, it is well hidden.","mltobin","Aug 09, 2011"

4.92,16.3,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and has been made by someone who truly appreciates the craft of craft brewing. It's not a beer for everyone, though, as evidenced by, if nothing else, the fact that the liquid is so bitter and tart--75+ IBUs, and that doesn't include the effects of the rye--that when left in the mouth for several seconds (as it is when, for instance, the drinker is writing a review of it) the tongue numbs and tingles. But enthusiasts who don't mind a good bit of bitterness should give this one a try.","jondeelee","Aug 01, 2011"
4.47,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O- Brilliant marriage of hop bitterness, malt sweetness, and rye spice. All the mouthfeel, color, and sweetness of a brown ale; with a bright hop flavor.

3.66,-13.5,4,3,4,4,3.5,"Tastes of heavy hearty rye pumpernickel bread at first, joined up by the bittering wave of a standard hop bomb of boiled pine sap and grapefruit pith. I've not had a beer like this in quite some time which wears its "Rye-ness" on it's sleeve so proudly. I would even call it -educational- for providing an easily identifiable textbook example of what Rye malt should taste like. Spicey, earthy goodness all around with a heavy wallop of bittering. I'm OK with this.","WastingFreetime","Jul 25, 2011"

3.73,-11.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a deep amber, a finger of light stone colored foam. Nice retention and solid sheets of lacing. Smells like spicy rye, malt, piney hops, and lemon. Taste is a bready rye with some lemon, finishing moderately bitter. I don't know if the hops are supposed to be this restrained, or if this is just an older bottle. In any case, I was expecting more hop presence. Mouthfeel is creamy, with a medium-full body and medium carbonation. Overall, this was pretty good, but a heftier dose of hops would take this to another level.","pmarlowe","Jul 15, 2011"

4.17,-1.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Notes - Just a solid beer, one of the best offerings from Bear Republic, which is an extremely solid brewery. The IPA characteristics from racer 5, but with some of the malt backbone of red rocket.","scotvega18","Jul 13, 2011"
4,-5.4,4,4,4,4,4,"It's a good beer - flavorful and fairly drinkable. I do have to warn you that this is on the malty side of IPA's (I guess 1.020), and many, including me, prefer to stay on the dry side of the spectrum. It just makes things more drinkable and refreshing. But if you enjoy something sweet on occasions, this would be a good ipa one to try.","jibbyvonjibb","Jul 11, 2011"
4.61,9,5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"O - A tasty IPA from Bear Republic that falls outside the mainstream California IPAs, but doesn't disappoint. Thoroughly enjoyable and easy to consume. A must for all IPA and Bear Republic fans.","Hatzilla","Jul 10, 2011"
4.05,-4.3,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O - Overall, I was really looking forward to this one and I wasn't disappointed. However, I just based my ranking on how much I enjoyed it, not to the style because I believe it has been wrongly categorized. This is at least a DIPA, and you could make the case that it should be a barleywine. I found it to be VERY similar to Terrapin's Rye Squared. This is another good one from Bear Republic, looking forward to the other bottle I received!","Janderson91","Jul 06, 2011"

Very Tasty beer.","dcook11","Jul 02, 2011"

4.03,-4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O: A delicious IPA with rye notes. I'm not a huge fan of rye beers and I know that this is technically not a rye, rather an IPA but it has wonderful rye spice that adds to the delicious IPA that lies underneath.","suspect","Jun 29, 2011"

4.18,-1.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall, very enjoyable and easy to sip throughout an evening, with the unique scent of rye replacing what would be hops in any other ale. Thinner than a stout, without any sense of "soy-maltiness" or "guinness dryness" this is a gorgeous brown ale. Try it! My only complaint was that the label didn't quite do the beer justice; they should rework it. lol.","katybee","Jun 28, 2011"
4.32,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall a real good beer. I think this might be my first rye style, who knows I've forgotten more beers that I've had than many people Have had. If it isn't, it's definitely the best rye I've had.","MrVonzipper","Jun 27, 2011"
4.85,14.7,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"My slow, gentle pour still got me a finger of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity, thanks to my pour. I will stir up the lees at the end to see what I get. Nose was grapefruit and black pepper, owing to both the copious hops and all of the rye. Man, but the mouthfeel was full, with a spicy intensity that makes me want to remind you to be sitting down when drinking this beer! That was a Public Service Announcement, courtesy of yours truly. Stone likes to think that we are "not worthy", but even as a self-avowed hophead, I may not be worthy of this one. It just exploded in my mouth with citrus and black pepper and swallowing did not help, since it was so dry that I immediately gasped and reached for the water. Oh my! To say that this was good would be an understatement. Put another way - it may not be for everyone, but if you like American IPAs and you appreciate what rye can do for a beer, you should try this beer, if you haven't already. I have a feeling that this review at this stage is either a) gilding the lily or b) preaching to the choir or c) some of both.","woodychandler","Jun 26, 2011"

4.47,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Very satisfying and clever brew. The rye provides just enough spunk without detracting from the hop profile, which is magnificent in its own right. Definitely the best use of rye in a heavily hopped ale I've come across.","spicelab","Jun 24, 2011"
4.21,-0.5,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Libation: 8% ABV might be enough to push this into DIPA range, but this is quite drinkable. One of the very first rye IPAs to become distributed, and is stil one of the very best.","OttoBomb","Jun 23, 2011"
4.12,-2.6,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good, balanced and complex IPA. This brew was heavy on the citrus hops but the excellent caramel malt and spicy rye base of this beer helped balance out all those hops ans made for a pretty complex brew. I liked the aroma the most with the flavor just falling a little short and it had really good drinkability for an IPA, I could for sure go for another one if I had one. I could see buying a six pack of this when I am in the mood for IPA, the balance and complexity were awesome. I recommend this beer to anyone who likes IPA's, it's doesn't hit you over the head with hops, but it wins you over with its balance and complexity. This beer made for a good first impression of Bear Republic and I am looking forward to trying some of their other brews.","StoutHunter","Jun 23, 2011"
4.35,2.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the dryness of this Ale. IMO so many beers are becoming more and more sweet, especially if they have a high ABV. I have not been overly impressed with the offerings from the Bear Republic Brewing Co., but I have to say this is a very good brew. I would definitely by another case. This is one of the few beers that I find more flavorful on the colder side, that being said I drank this at between 50-55 degrees. Just right!","JTSbeerislife","Jun 16, 2011"

4.63,9.5,4.5,4,5,5,4.5,"Appearance was of sweet brewed tea that was a bit cloudy but that's my fault. I love yeast sediment. Toffee colored head with decent retention considering it's abv. Sticky powdered malt like lacing coats the glass. Nose is boozie and packed with earthy floral hops. A slight tinge of grapefruit is present as well. As it warms more caramel and toffee are present in the entire beer and has a awesome hop presence and the buiscuity mouthfeel is not outdone. The rye being 18 percent of the grist defiantly gives this beer a crisp sharp dry finish. I love the hop bitterness and malty backbone. This is such a well balanced beer to sip on.

4.8,13.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Overall: Just about perfect in every way. The only things for me that could have made it better would have been a heftier head retention and maybe ONE more scent in the nose...but I'm just splitting hairs at this point, a truly good beer.","Lauthaha","Jun 04, 2011"
4.28,1.2,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,"Verdict: This is a really phenomenal IPA, the rye spicing adds a nice subtle touch that adds a lot to the beer. It’s really easy to drink and very approachable without compromising the quality and complexity of the beer.","kevanb","Jun 02, 2011"

4.34,2.6,3,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Overall/notes - Well, I like the Racer 5, but this just ran right over it (pun not intended). Much more potent than I generally expect out of an IPA, and with great balance, too! Never would have thought the rye could go such a long way, but Bear Republic apparently was on to something. Well-done.","bbkd3b","May 31, 2011"

3.97,-6.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall the medium bodied brew is a solid IPA, and a solid offering for rye lovers that's available in half the bodegas in New York City. That's a feat to accomplish, and although my rating may be slightly affected by my anti-rye bias, I should still salute Bear Republic for this hot rod of a beer.","afksports","May 24, 2011"
4.38,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Whoa, first sip's reaction is "now that's an interesting and unique take on an IPA". Certainly very hoppy and robustly bitter on the back side of the taste, but also pleasantly balanced out by a certain heartiness that becomes this beer's character. The ultra-crisp mouthfeel and dry finish also help to balance out any and all flavors within. Virtually no alcohol taste at all at 8% ABV. While I can only imagine that the 18% rye malt is giving this beer its uniqueness, it doesn't take away from the overall balance of the beer. That is why this beer shines. It's unique and delicious and will be sure to please any hophead, but it's so delicately balanced that most people would be able to appreciate it. Just one of these has turned it into one of my favorite IPA's, or specialty ales, whatever it is, and it has peaked my interest for some other rye beers. Great beer, congrats and thanks to Bear Republic.","chodinheaven","May 24, 2011"
4.38,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Deep cherry tinted chestnut brown with a creamy mocha head that leaves thick rings of sparkling lace on the glass. Citrusy hops, pine sap and caramel rye malt aromas. Big resinous hop flavor with rich caramel maltiness to balance the hop oily bitterness. The rye adds a nice spicy kick to round out the flavors. Medium bodied with perfect cleansing carbonation. Bear Republic makes some fine ales, Hop Rod Rye may be the best one.","biggred1","May 22, 2011"
4.3,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O: Great rye pale ale. Crisp, malted with a kick of rye and hops in the background but noticeable. Will always grab another when Racer 5 isnt biting enough. This is its bad bro.","legalpete19340","May 21, 2011"

4.42,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours very dark, cloudy, amber, with a near two finger head. A fair amount of lacing as the beer is consumed. There is a very lovely hops aroma. The taste is both sweet and bitter (I’d say bitter sweet, but that implies that some part of this beer is not good). The beer starts off very sweet and then the hops kick in. The hops bite is very good, but not over the top. This is a very balanced rye beer. The mouthfeel is very good too, not to heavy, not too thin. This is a very drinkable IPA, almost dangerously drinkable given the 8% ABV. Too bad I need to travel out of state to get this one.","pjs234","May 17, 2011"
4.43,4.7,4.5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Beer pours out to a mahogany body with a thin tan head that maintains some superb lacing and retention. It has a nice aroma of pine and grapefruit along with some sweet caramel. The taste is rye, caramel and a load of hops which the bitterness just bites the tongue and balances out the sweetness. This beer has got to be one of the smoothest, creamiest and best mouth feel I have ever experienced with a beer. A very good beer and just like the other two Bear Republic beers that I have reviewed this also is a must try.","DannyDan","May 16, 2011"
3.99,-5.7,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"This is a great amber colored beer with a light foam. An aggressive pour released a great nose. The smells were Apple, citrus, and papaya. I thought that it might be too sweet for me but upon tasting it I was surprised to find a deep complex piny IPA with strong notes of simcoe hops. This is a very well rounded beer that has a lot of hop characteristic. with just enough malt to balance it out.","soughtbygod","May 14, 2011"

4.21,-0.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O-- Grows on me as I drink on with this. Quite interesting and different but very good. Keeps alot of the essence of what an IPA is but the rye adds a new dimension to this with the sweetness and richness of it","mulder1010","May 13, 2011"

4.54,7.3,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"I'm finding out that the more I drink beers labeled "IPA" or "Double IPA" that it will cause me to shift and jostle my top ten list of beers to try and make room for it. This "HOP ROD RYE Specialty Ale" was my first BEAR REPUBLIC experience and the CA location made me automatically knock off critical bias points. EVEN STILL, it fizzed and finessed its way into my top ten. The last Belgian style ale has now been knocked off my top ten list - now leaving only inhabitiants of porters, IPA's and stouts. HOT ROD RYE ALE has a very nice cap pop aroma of hops - though less than my other IPA's on the list. I felt the aroma predicted "hop-slap" was missing in the flavor but the aftertaste lingered appreciably. A nice beer - if I were to rate it - I would say this is a perfect introductory IPA for the novice beer style drinker.","GoldHorde","Apr 29, 2011"
3.91,-7.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"A darkish earthy flavor mixed with hops. Must be some malts in here balancing out the hops quite well. A balanced beer - there is no one characteristic that stands out. There is slight hop bitterness but also a little malty sweetness. I do think you get a rye flavor though, or at least it reminds me little of the flavor in rye whiskey. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. A very good session beer, especially for having 8% ABV.","jar2574","Apr 29, 2011"

4.26,0.7,5,4,4,5,4.5,"22oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. No freshness info. Pours a deep reddish brown. Very uncharacteristic color. One finger of frothy foam and lots of carbonation. Nice lacing. Nose has a lot going on. Sweet and roasted malt with light and fresh hop and rye scents underlying. The darker than usual roasted malt brings out a lot more rich, robust smells. I can even detect a little cocoa. Mouthfeel is great. Good carbonation and supple without being heavy. Almost creamy texture. Interesting palate as well. The rye gives it more of a grassy taste but the bitterness from the hops rounds this out quite well. Finishes rather clean. The hops still provide some resiny bitterness but the rye makes it more crisp and the roasted malt keeps too much sweetness from creeping in. Definitely not your classic DIPA but a welcome interpretation and an impressive effort. I would almost call it a brown IPA.","hoppyhampy","Apr 18, 2011"

Finishes with some nice bitterness. No sign of booziness or alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is full bodied, rich, complex, and finishes smooth. Drinkability is very high...scary for how high the ABV is.

Good presence of malt in there too. Taste has the distinct rye flavour, malt body with some bitterhops and a quick finish ending dry. Medium to heavy mouthfeel. Pretty great tasting beer and unique IPA. No idea how fresh this bottle is but I imagine the Hop Rod Rye really fresh is amazing.

It's unfiltered so you can't see through to the other side since there is a cloud of sediment in your way. When I smell I get hops and another element, perhaps that's the rye since the bottle says it's brewed with 18% rye. Tastes like an IPA and even the after-taste tastes like an IPA but to me it's a mellow IPA. No hop bombs here. Nice job Bear Republic. Another winner.","BigB415","Feb 20, 2011"

A little bit of haze in the coloring, and lots of sediment throughout the beer, which they do a good job of warning you about on the label. Smells are heavy on the hops, with a little malty sweet balance. The beer is bitter-sweet, with hops and caramel sweetness. Also a smokey-toasted malt flavor throughout, which keeps the hop flavors nice and smooth. The beer is a bit dry and smooth in mouth. The sediment really issn't overly bothersome. Quick on the finish, with a lingering hoppy and sour aftertaste. The beer leaves alot of flavor on the back of the tongue, while puckering the front tongue and lips a bit.

Bitter earthy pine needle is countered by sweet tropical and citrus fruit notes as well as the sweet rye and malt backbone. Hints of pineapple, grapefruit and citrus peel counter the dry bitter character and are complimented excellently by the sweet rye and malt profile. There's also a creamy presence mid-palate that adds to the complexity and mouthfeel. Excellently balanced with a well masked ABV resulting in an extremely quaffable hop bomb.

Aroma is of mostly floral hops, with grapefruit and some bready malt. Good but not a departure from many other IPA's out there. Tastes of bitter hops, with the bitterness especially coming out in the end. Some bready malt balances very well with the hops, and the rye adds a wonderful spicy taste. Very well balanced.

Even small details, like acidity, are executed in such a way as to make this beer more than the sum of its parts. While Bear Republic dabbles with other DIPA recipes (Racer X, for example) there is little point in trying to outshine this beer as it is when served from the bottle. In fact, this is one of those beers that seems to benefit from a little time spent in the bottle. Hop Rod was my draft selection during my sole visit to the company brewpub in Healdsburg and I found it to be be overly spicy--a sensory mix of capsaicin and volatile herbs--due either, or perhaps jointly, to the rye or the eye-watering freshness of the hops.

Aroma is fantastic, it has a big hoppy nose like an IPA but with that wonderful rye sharpness. Taste is bitter and sharp...if this wasn't such an incredible beer, I would be tempted to say the hops overbalance the malt, this beer is hoppier than most IPAs and as hoppy as many DIPAs.

Definitely has a more intense hop flavor than I hoped for (My fault for not seeing the Rye IPA part when I bought this on a whim). Pretty highly hopped beer so it was difficult to ascertain the impact of the 18% rye vs say 10%.

Buckets of intense piney resinous hops gives a rough and ready aroma that leads to a tongue tearing mouth feel. Flavour and character in spades. Finish is loooong and sublime. One tasty mofo.

I didn't notice any alcohol on the finish---the abv is 8%, not exactly a lightweight. The brew is very well made, but I found myself not getting past the rye spice flavors. So, not my style and something I couldn't see having more than one of occasionally. I bet it's a nice beer with Asian food or maybe Indian. Its def one to try for yourself---you may love it.

Aroma is sweet malts, rye(of course), dark fruits, and a hint of resinous, pine-y hops. Not very hop forward so this may be a touch aged. Tastes like a rye ale with a biting bitter back end. Bit of grapefruit and floral-ness lingers on the back of my tongue. Mouthfeel is great.

It kinda smelled like a typical IPA, but the rye in the taste makes it stand apart. I'm not sure exactly how to describe it but I've already purchased another Rye IPA to try (Founders).

This is only the second "rye" IPA that I have tried and they have both been excellent. I like this version better than the typical west coast IPA.","buschbeer","Aug 24, 2010"
4.2,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The palate opens with a blend of caramel-like flavors - brown sugar, toffee and caramel - but not cloying on the palate. Along with it is a rather strong pine and candied grapefruit hop character with moderate bitterness and plenty of flavor. The rye comes in on the mid-palate with a pronounced spiciness that lingers into the finish. Moderately drying on the finish, this beer has a wonderful blend of toffee, rye and pine hops. The mouthfeel is quite sublime with a medium-light body and a soft carbonation, a level which really accentuates the good qualities of this beer. Excellent stuff, I'd drink a lot of this - if only I could find a bottled on date. Despite the moderately high ABV, this goes down very easily, and I will pick this up on a more regular basis.","DefenCorps","Aug 23, 2010"

To their credit, it is a balanced beer and quite drinkable, but I was hoping for more Rye. I live in california for christ' sake.

Hop Rod Rye has the great grapefruit and floral hop aromas of American IPA's, but is made with rye, is darker than the standard, with a fuller mouthfeel and slightly higher alcohol content. The aroma is a very enticing combination of orange flower and grapefruit zest. The beer is a very nice juxtaposition of piney citrusy west coast hops with spicy rye The beer is thick, luxuriously coating the tongue with each swallow.

Nothing exciting going on, some interesting notes once again just with the rye, but an otherwise average beer.

4.03,-4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a hazy, reddish-copper with a dense, one inch off-white head that settles into a thin, fairly consistent cap. Broken sheets of lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent retention. Nose starts off as sweet and malty with toffee notes, followed by a citrus hops presence that follows closely behind; a faint metallic quality also comes out towards the back. Taste follows nose - some piny hops in the mix and just a very light bitterness reveals itself at the back and the metallic quality disappers. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and just the slightest viscosity and a little residual alcohol heat. This is a very tasty brew that has a big malt profile and falls a little closer to an IIPA than a standard IPA. Very tasty and complex, but not something I would drink more than one or two of in a sitting.","Jwale73","May 24, 2010"

4.2,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Hop Rod Rye pours fairly deep amber with a copper hue. If this beer was wood, I would make a nice desk out of it. The head is parchment and minimal, but it has staying power and leaves nice lace. The aroma is of rye, sweet malt and pine. It also has a very estery fruitiness to it that I find quit unique. The flavor is a mix of pine, grapefruit, caramel malt and a touch of rye. Together they combine to create some interesting flavors that are very berry like. This is definitely a take no prisoners sort of beer, and while I am defiantly picking up what it's laying down, I wish there was more rye. A paltry complaint, but what can I say, I'm a rye whore. Also, the alcohol really shows through in the flavor, though the more I sip the more I think this just enhances the overall experience. The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium and is well balanced with a nice spiky carbonation that works well in the overall package. Pretty drinkable for style (this is def a double IPA, not a single as indicated) and another fine offering from bear republic.

4.48,5.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured into a thistle glass. Vigorous head, light tan, not very long-lasting, but ok. Slightly hazy, deep garnet color. Aroma of some pine and lemon, with faint rye notes. Slight lactic odor, but I don't think it really detracts from the enjoyment. This beer has a HUGE nose to it, even cold. Alcohol slightly noticeable in aroma and taste. Full body and moderately carbonated. Rye is strongly present in the taste (18% rye had better be) without dominating. Hops and rye blend very well in this beer. This bottle has been in my basement for a while, so the hoppiness has probably dropped. I like beers that age well, and this beer can age very nicely without losing its appeal. I'll certainly drink this again. If one of you can send me some... Beer trade, anyone?","compass40204","Apr 27, 2010"

Taste features a good dose of caramel malt up front balanced by the rye, not too sweet, with an even hoppy finish, noble bitterness. Good dose of rye and roast for balance. Mouthfeel is medium, given cask condition fairly smooth. Drinkability has the ABV well hidden, farily drinkable once you get used to the rye malt.

I like the rye aspect, but when it comes to IPAs I much prefer ones that are less induced with it, and have less of a sour and heavy feel. I can see why it is as highly rated as it is, and I will return again, but it is not among my favorites.","jminsc76","Mar 10, 2010"
4.32,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Deep reddish-amber, slight haze, with a dense, sticky tan head. Juicy ripe citrus hops in the nose, along with a bit of spicy malt. Similar in flavor: intensely citric hops overshadow a substantially spicy malt base. Hops quickly permeate the palate with strong grapefruit rind bitterness. Spicy, slightly grainy malt profile provides some ripe fruit undertones to the citrus flavors. Finishes fairly dry and bitter with hints of spicy malt/rye grain and citrus rind. An intense, delicious beer. One of the best easy-to-find beers.","bcm119","Mar 09, 2010"

4.46,5.4,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"Strong and pleasing aroma of sweet and spicy malt with citrus hops. Very American in both malt and hops. I'm guessing the pineapple and pine aroma comes from the same Columbus and Cascade hops that's featured in their Racer 5 IPA. The rye makes the beer slightly spicy and considerably darker than the IPA. It pours a deep reddish orange with a big fluffy off-white head that lasts long beyond the final drop. The taste is a fine balance between the sweet malt, spicy rye, and citrus hops. No component outshines the other. It's full bodied with a smooth texture and a lingering bittersweet finish. This beer is full and satisfying with a delicately balanced character that allows you to fully enjoy each drop which is remarkable for a style in which so many others punch you in the face with just one element. This is definitely my new favorite Double IPA. Highly recommended.","exparte","Mar 07, 2010"
4.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"12 oz bottle to a pint glass. Pours dark red, very dark for an IPA. Sediment floating about. Small creamy off-white head with brown spots, leaves nice walls of lacing. The smell is very malty, dark fruit/cherry, pine. Bitter hops and smooth malts are balanced here excellently. Pine, caramel, rye, and dark cherry all take turns dancing on the tongue. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. This drinks almost like a mini-strong ale. Alcohol is very-well hidden, a tiny bit shows through at the end. Long ago when I first tried this I didn't think much of it and thought it was one of the most overrated beers in the top 100. Now I can safely say it deserves its place. Well done Bear Republic.","Chico1985","Mar 05, 2010"

Such a complex array of flavors, lead the way to a bitter finish. Crisp taste, medium body and carbonation. Just the right balance between rich and smoooth feel.

4.08,-3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Deep, burgundy color with a thick, frothy head. The aroma is certainly hop-filled, with notes of pine and citrus, but it is also much sweeter than I would have expected with a big caramel sweetness. The flavor is bigger and bolder than the aroma suggested, with an earthy, grapefruit hop bitterness that is solidly balanced against an underlying caramel malt sweetness. In contrast to this balance, the bitter hops are dominant in the aftertaste, which effectively masks any hint of the 8% alcohol. This "specialty ale" is medium-bodied and nicely (but not overly) carbonated, but despite this solid mouthfeel and largely balanced flavor, it's the overwhelming bitterness in the aftertaste rather than the higher alcohol that makes this one almost more of a sipper than a session beer. That said, I still happily plowed through this bomber in no time.","devilben02","Nov 09, 2009"

4.03,-4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into my New Belgium globe. Pours a dark brick color, great clarity. Has a nice off white head that sticks around and leaves nice lace, this beer looks like a Dubbel, but one whiff and you will not be mistaken, it is a beautifully smelling IPA. The nice pine and floral notes that Racer 5 has are a bit more subdued in this American IPA from Bear Republic, it has more of a malt presence. Once you taste it, wow it makes it's hop prescence known. The taste is the aroma times a hundred. At first the piney hops take over, but then blend beautifully with a malt character that creeps to the front of the palate as the hops bring their bitter to the sides. Some of the grapefruit I expected is on the backend as the brew leaves the palate with a crisp but lingering bitterness. This is a medium to full bodied beer with a bit of a slick oily mouthfeel. As I continue to drink it, that head still stays, making this a very nice beer to stare at up until the very last drop. The aesthetic enjoyment of this beer is right on pace with the taste. As the beer warms a bit the hops become toned down and the malt is more present, and as it unfolds, it remains a very complex beer. This beer is delicious enough to keep drinking, but I feel this is best suited as a single to be paired with a chicken or meat dinner, it will most certainly add to the sensory experience especially as it develops over the course of the meal. Perhaps grab the 22 oz. bomber and split it with someone over dinner, definitely a good choice for a BYOB spot.","Lldeegan","Nov 04, 2009"
4.08,-3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Mouthfeel is extremely creamy. Just about medium-bodied with fairly low carbonation. Very smooth drinking for an IPA. Not much of a crispness to the brew at all, but more like a porter. Admirable in mouthfeel for sure. Drinkability is deserving in that this is a classic template IPA with the pine, malt, citrus and subtle spice. Evenly balanced and each component shines very well in presentation with nothing being too overpowering. I'd recommend this to someone who is trying to get into IPA's. A great West Coast IPA.","infi","Nov 03, 2009"

Toasty rye dominates the finish with a foreground of restrained hoppiness. The slightly sourness of the Rye comes in great play with the mountain of hops in here. The citrus and spicy herbalness is kept in healthy check. Its very drinkable.","allboutbierge","Sep 27, 2009"

By far the best looking IPA I've ever had and one of the best looking beers in general I've ever tried. The smell is good, floral hints and citrus and pine hops, smells good. The taste is very good as well. Not quite as strong as I expected but very, very good. It tastes clean and pure, if that makes sense. The mouthfeel is good, pretty well balanced, a bit lighter than I expected but incredibly clean refreshing.

Pours a very dark, almost opaque reddish brown with a creamy one finger head that retains quite well. Spotty lacing is left on most of my glass with some good blankets in some spots. Smells of hops, sweets, a bit of alcohol and more piney/woody hop characteristic. The taste is also of HUGE hops, tons of pine/wood, malts, some alcohol and some good sweetness but not too much. Mouthfeel is medium with a good hoppy aftertaste coating left on the tongue, alcohol brings in a good warming effect. Drinkability is good but not great, alcohol might become too much and the piney/woody hops will definitely overcome the palate after one or two of these, still a great IPA and a unique experience.

Taste begins with citrus sweetness balanced with a bready malt flavor, then transitioning into a strong grassy bitterness that continued into the finish. Mouthfeel was smooth with a medium body.

Taste reveals loads of rye up-front which immediately tingles the tongue with a peppery effect. Caramel flavors are also present. Citrus notes are present as well with a large dose of pine on the finish. Mouth-feel is medium bodied with a nice oily resin towards the finish. Balance is tremendous here and really channels all the flavors across the palate. Although complex, it comes across simple, which aids its drinkability. Alcohol is well concealed.

4.18,-1.2,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The Hop Rod Rye is a magnificent beer, but also characterizes both the strengths and weaknesses of the Bear Republic brewing company. These folks make make strong, distinctive beers that are highly individualistic and uncompromising. They also, often have a lack of polish to them that you've probably come to expect from a lot of other beers. The Hop Rod Rye is probably an 'acquired taste', but given time, this one has more to offer than just about any other beer in its price range ($4).","cmoon","Jul 11, 2009"

Surprised by the amount of malt in the aroma. Some citrus hops is also detected. I found it well balanced with a solid caramel malt base. Citrus and pine lets you know there is a healthy hop bill. The rye is detected in the finish with an exotic spiciness. No hint of the 8% ABV. Found it dry overall. Chewy texture, medium body, good carbonation, and all seemed well matched. This beer manages to balance three distinct qualities between malt, hops, and they rye. Bitterness as well as ABV is high so that limits drinkability.","morimech","Jun 30, 2009"

The aroma is somewhat subdued. There is noticeable caramel, but I can't find the hops. The hops are definitely there in the first taste. A nice balance of caramelized malt and hoppy bitterness.

4.15,-1.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep amber/red with a thin off-white head. Smell is very herbal. Taste has abundance of hop flavor, you can really taste the raw, pungent, piney hops. There is maybe a hint of citrus, but this beer is all about the pine. There is a nice sweet malt backbone to match up with the hops. Dry IPA this is not. There is just a hint of spicy rye, rounds things out nicely. The finish is nice and bitter, hop oils coat your tongue. Mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth, very nice low carbonation levels. Drinkability is fantastic, a 22oz bottle is great for an entire evening. I usually like the dryer IPA's but Hop Rod Rye is an excellent choice for a well rounded beer. I will definitely buy again.","tronester","Apr 01, 2009"

The hops definitely have a west coast feel, and the flavoring hops might outshine the bittering. A dangerously drinkable IPA that is bold, yet not palate fatiguing. Only issue I have is a bit too much carbonation. The spicy nature of the rye adds a nice element to the overall complexity of the beer. I have yet to be disappointed by a Bear Republic brew.","twiggamortis420","Mar 30, 2009"

A floral hop and grapefruit aroma that was really nice. There was a smooth grapefruit hop flavor with a nice bitter kick in the finish. The malts flavors in this are also very good. The hops do get a little "spicy" with the higher carbonation. I couldn't tell if there was a rye flavor as I haven't had to many beers with rye in it.

A thick, sticky lacing is left on the inside of my glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells and tastes of grapefruit, lemon, pine, caramelized malts, spicy rye malt, bread and more grapefruit. Very little alcohol presence for an 8% ABV beer. Just about the perfect balance of malt and hops for my tastes. Somewhere between medium and full bodied with medium carbonation.

A crisp, pine & grapefruit hop aroma is contrasted by the sweet rye. Nothing overpowering, but a tasty blended smell indeed. Lovin' this taste, I swear hops are not the first thing you taste, it the sweet carmel malt upfront, but very quickly the hops hit you, and hit you strong, providing that bitterness, and citrus character, that contrasts the sweetness very well. The alcohol warms in the aftertaste. I a little tart in your mouth, but incredibly drinkable. I definitely will be seeking this out again soon","bhalter8","Mar 19, 2009"

4.04,-4.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours out a reddish color, deep amber, almost brown. And it looks perfectly clear, with a massive off-white head. It looks very sticky and stays around, though it leaves minimal lacing. I don't mind, it's a beautiful beer, though not American IPA look (possibly a bad classification, but there isn't really a good one). The smell is crisp and hoppy. Pungent smell, possibly some C-hops and very resinous high AA% hops in this beer. There's also a noticable sweetness underneath, with the spicy rye. The taste is really nice. There is a definite IPA hop taste, a bit fruity, very resinous, a tiny bit of citrus, not a huge kick of bitterness, which is nice, balanced with nice malt backbone. The rye is noticable, but I'd be interested in just a little bit more there. The alcohol is noticable, lends a bit of a burn. The beer clings to the mouth, leaving a feeling of hops after you swallow, which I prefer, but the alcohol kind of lightens it up, but not too badly. This one is kind of a chore, not for the flavor, but because of the 8% ABV. A good beer, definitely worth trying.","taylorhamrick","Mar 15, 2009"
4.18,-1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Bottle at The Local. Poured a clear copper color with large frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy complex citrus hoppy aroma with a rye tone.

4.33,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A nice-sized bubbly tan head grows quickly above a big blast of carbonation bubbles, then slowly fades, leaving a chunky, spider-webbed lacing all around. Color is a clear amber with some slight reddish hues. Smells of bright, citrusy hops with a malty sweetness lurking behind. Tastes of more big citrusy hops with the sweet malts becoming more aparent on the palate than to the nose. In my opinion, complexity of aroma and taste is not as sought after as is perfection in the hops vs. malts profile when you're speaking of IPAs. This one is ideal, with the sweet malts backing up the hops, but not getting in the way. A sort of malts as Bonnie to hops as Clyde duo; all outlawish and sexy. Goes down nicely and doesn't put the weigh-down on too much, despite its medium body. Possibly the best IPA i've ever had, and I'm completely stoked that it's now readily available here in my neck of the woods.","stephens101","Mar 13, 2009"

However, the more I poured and the more the coppery taste dwindled, the more amazing this beer got. Half way down and the Hop Rod Rye became one of the better beers I've had in a couple months.

Taste is hoppy and sweet - seductive as it warms up - just keeps getting better with every sip. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with plenty of foam.

A sharp hop nose that has an underlying earthiness. The expected hop flavors are present but with addition of rye they have a little something extra to hold onto, which in turn allows the hops to better express themselves. The blend of barley and rye gives this beer a distinctive, pleasant and satisfying flavor. The body is full and satisfying, something missing in most IPAs. As with most IPAs, this beer will burn your tastebuds, but unlike most IPAs, there is more flavor to be had. You will be feeling the effects if you have several, but this is as drinkable as an IPA can get. I highly recommend this beer, worth a lot of effort to get.","beertunes","Feb 28, 2009"

3.93,-7.1,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Gave this brew a try last evening as it was a brew that I have been passing by for a long time. Based on the reviews I figured I just had to give it a try as it seems that I was missing something. I know why I have passed this brew up as I am not a big hophead though I do like hoppy brews, just not a steady diet of them. This brew poured to a somewhat cloudy dull amber color with a huge bubbly light tan head that had incredible retention leaving thick chunky lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma's for this brew are really dominated with a huge hop presence, it hits you hard from the time you open the bottle and make the pour. The hop aroma i catch is more pine than citrus/grapefruit. Caramel like malt aroma is there as well but takes a clear back seat, besides that it is hard for me to pick up other scents. The flavor is nice, resin like hop flavors seem to hit right from the start and just linger at the back of the mouth for a good period of time. I have had brews that have seemed more hoppy before but this one is pretty heavy in the hop area, also not sure the age of this bottle so they could have even mellowed a bit. I think I am getting some malt (Rye?) base as well in the flavor but it does seem hard to find anything under the layer of hops. Quite drinkable (though I was getting hopped out, lead to a lower drinkability but that i just my take), finishes a little dry, nice carbonation. Not a brew I would continually look for but one I would clearly recommend!","Stimack","Jan 20, 2009"

4.2,-0.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer pours a hazy dark copper brown with an abundance of foamy, frothy white head, that takes its sweet time going away. The smell is grapefruit citrus hops, and sweet caramel malt, with a bit of grainy spiciness. The taste is a wallop of citrus and pine hops, balanced by a decent sweet malt backbone. The grainy spiciness of the rye is quite evident, and a nice addition to the usual suspects. The carbonation is on the moderate side, and there is only a mild warming from the alcohol. This finishes off-dry, with a nice tangy bitterness from some leafy green hoppiness. Once my palate reset itself to Hops, Straight Ahead!, this became very drinkable. Would that i could have this as the base for a session...","biboergosum","Jan 17, 2009"

4.32,2.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Frothy head composed of lively tiny bubbles, very slow to dissolve, cloudy amber-brown color with a pleasing glow to it, mostly opaque. Aggressive nose of hops and bitters, mixes in pine resin, white grapefruit pith and field flowers, any fruit is like dried apricot pits, compactness in its punch may inhibit breadth of scents. Lots of foam in the mouth during attack, more full-bodied than medium as it sits very solidly on the palate. Hoppy as a hyper rabbit, less bitter than nose might suggest due to the sweeter grapefruit, tangerine citrus and more present apricot, peach fruit. The rye flavors there but not a huge aspect, blends into accents of hay, straw, fallen pine needles and spices. It expands in the mouth until you have to make a concerted effort to swallow. Stays relatively balanced in spite of its outsized desire to impress.","farrago","Jan 17, 2009"

As I was pouring it, the words, "damn, now that is a glass of beer" popped in to my head. Rye, grapefruit, pine, brown bread, alcohol and something very herbal/spicy all come through beautifully in the smell. Rye and hops dominate the taste, but there is also a very juicy fruity aspect to it. Slight alcohol burn, with some bitterness as well. Malt and hops combine nicely to make this a bigger IPA than most. The body actually feels bigger than the amount of alcohol present. The slight alcohol burn and bitterness that this one only mildly difficult to drink; in other words I cleared the bomber off without a problem. Rye infused India Pale Ales are some of the best out there IMO, and this one is no exception. In fact this one ranks for me as one of the best IPAs available anywhere.

4.34,2.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This pint was pulled during a Bear Republic Tasting in NYC. The first surprise was how different the draft felt, more bitter and more carbonated. The aroma starts with the malt and some low levels of hops. The appearance is a lovely auburn, where red turns to brown. There was no head but a great deal of good carbonation, which felt like a plus. The flavor starts with a malt with rye spiciness floating through. Next is a bitterness with some rye left over. It finishes bitter with a sweet aftertaste. The bitterness is not citrusy as the usual IPA style and borders on astringent. The mouthfeel is medium with a lot of carbonation which cuts the overall body down a bit.

The hops was right up front with the rye but there was a bit of a funkiness with it. Maybe I'll get another and see. Drinkability was low due to the taste. This doesn't compare to other IPA's at all.

As it warmed the 18% rye became more noticeable in the nose. I could sniff this stuff all night. Medium body and smooth as it coats the palate with hops all over the place. Pine, lemon, orange, floral, and bitter hops assault the taste buds into submission. But there is balance. Solid toasted malt provides the rail for this hop-dump to ride in on. And ride it does, like the green flamed road racer on the bottle. Hop Rod exits dry, but leaves a tingly sensation reminding you of the pleasure you have just experienced. This is a great beer. I love the surfeit of hops, the balance provided by the malt and the way it all goes together. And as I drain the glass, the vestiges of foam cling to its sides, slowly succumbing to gravity, as if weeping that it is all gone.","BeardedBoffin","Nov 24, 2008"

Heavy hop flavor up front with a nice malty balance. I taste a trace of copper which is the only downside to this one. The feel was smooth and quite drinkable for an 8% APV.

Aroma has a sharp, fresh hop nose of pine, citrus, and woods. Flavor is absolutely amazing. Lots of fresh hops up front with a complex malt backbone of toasted grains and the spiciness of rye. Moderate hop bitterness but not harsh at all. Full mouthfeel but very smooth and velvety makes this brew extremely drinkable. Watch out for this smooth beer sneaks up at an impressive 8% ABV.

The nose is super hoppy,packed full of citrus,and pine sap aromas. This has some of the freshest,heaviest,and smoothest hop bouquets I have yet to appreciate.

The nose shows that this is a hop bomb as it warms and settles(yes, an IPA), and the taste hides the ABV almost too well. Is it the rye? Not sure about the rye component but I find this beer very enjoyable and it offers a certain coarseness of texture and pepper spice that makes it quite drinkable.

The taste is hoppy yet smooth. The hops are citrussy with grapefruit notes predominating, although I taste a hint of pine. There is a dry note(from the rye?), as well as a smooth malty backing.

Tropical, notes of orange peel, piney resin, mint, and a bit of rye breadiness. Tastes wonderful. Begins with a wonderfully bitter hop presence full of pine, touches of lemon juice, floral citrus notes. Then a brilliantly balanced malt marches through full of bready, great rye notes give a hint of a whiskey finish, touches of red apple and caramel. Finishes bitter, dry and clean.

The scent has the sharp, pepper aroma of rye, that is followed by citrus(grapefruit), grass, and pine, with a touch of malty sweetness at the end. The mild taste of malt at the start, that blends with the tasty pepperness of rye. The hop onslaught then takes over. A grapefruit, pine, and earthy flavors dominate till the end. A slightly foamy feel of carbonation at the start, outside of that it is a thin feel, that gains weight as it crosses the palate. This is a very drinkable IPA, with the an inviting aroma, intense flavor, a little bit of a faulter on the feel. Plus, the rye does not shy away from the hops in flavor and the aroma.

4.02,-5,4,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Had a pint glass of this and received a leathery brown with rubish tints that gave off a rocky yet quickly receeding three-finger head with a lace ring. A mix of both intense tropical citrus notes such as banana and orange, coupled with some roasted, toffee and caramel malts - must've been the rye kicking in. A thick, almost full-bodied beer with a very dry backbite. A great hop bite with citric, earthy hops pounding the tongue and a stoutish, caramel aided roasted malt taste follows. Unfortunately, a slight alcohol burn derides some of the tastiness. I guess the rye can be thanked for both (the mix of tastes and the burn).

Aroma was very hoppy with a little bit of spice from the rye malt evident as well. Taste was quite sweet and caramelly with a swift kick of hops mixed in. The spicy rye flavor comes in toward the finish and complements the hop bitterness perfectly. Very nice balance and very drinkable as the 22oz bomber in front of me emptied rather quickly. I hope NC picks this up soon.","rodrot","Jul 10, 2008"

Superior bitterness after the citrus up front and a rye ending for sure. I wouldn't say that the malts ballance this baby but they are definitaly there.

It has a beautiful 1/4" thick creamy head that doesn't go away, which adds to this amazing creamy, malty flavor with every sip. It finishes so smooth, going down nice & easy without any bite to it at all. There's an incredibly pleasant, mildly bitter aftertaste along with that creamyness that's still hanging in there.

Taste follows the same- very strong- bitter, makes your mouth tingle. I did like it- just I felt I could not drink another one of these- even though I shared this bottle. I was looking foward to the rye, and I think the tang that cane with each sip was different, and probably due to the rye.

A very subdued grainy side on the back of the nose. Sweet licorice, nuanced oatmeal and the hops really only playing the background in this beer. I really do like it, and a very interesting way of doing this beer. The hops really only play a slight citric role, but completely overshadowed by the intensity of the malts (which are very approachable).

A fairly dark IPA, nice deep amber with plenty of carbonation and a sudsy head. Smell gets your attention. Piney grapefruit hits hard, accompanied bya grainy alcohol edge. Taste is exceptional. The grapefruit and pine aspects overwhelm the palate. A spicy hot aspect is there too. A hint of caramel malt tries to balance this brew out, but fails, this is a hopheads dream.

Nose is nice and strong, lots of spicy malt and then piney hops. One very minor complaint is that the nose is not particularly complex. Taste is wonderful, all over the place. In no particular order: piney hops, caramel and then toffee malt, light roasted malt, a touch of citrus, very mild dried fruit. Excellent flavor. Feel is full bodied with perfect carbonation.

There was a subtle rye aroma in the back of the nose if you took a deep whiff in the glass. The taste was excellent. There was a distinct hop hit up front but it faded nicely and left no poor aftertaste. The rye was mostly hidden by the hops, however, a bit of a letdown since it is difficult to find a good rye. I did not let this deter me long as this beer was exceptional. The mouthfeel was robust and well rounded but did not make me fool or cringe from the high IBUs.

The taste is equally as impressive. Some lightly roasted, biscuity malts, and a big, fresh, fruity hops presence. Wonderful finish. Big and hoppy without becoming very cloying at all.

This looks like a perfect power beer. Light rye-bread tones on the nose. Wafting bitterness expected for the style isn't hindered by excess carbonation. Honestly, I expected a little more here but the aroma is pleasant. I really need to let my beers open and breathe and get a little warm prior to pour...almost like you do with wine when talking about something powerful like this. Nice, hearty, bready structure - the rye almost feigns the tingle of carbonation here. Hops take a back seat in the first few sips but come back after about 20 minutes in force. A little earthy taste in the end. Well blended stuff with tangy finish. At first, it feels slightly sour but this evolves over time into more prevalent hop goodness. While it doesn't quite measure up to the look of one of the most eye-catching pours I've seen in a while I could definitely enjoy a few of these.

Overall a great beer but one really needs to be in the hoppy mood for it which thankfully I was!","Beerbuddha","Dec 16, 2007"

The flavor is a bit unique with a combination of bitter, earthy hops and sweet licorice malt. A bready base in a very full bodied and evenly carbonated ale. Not a typical IPA but quite good, not quite as much of that rye quality as I was hoping for, but an excellent ale just the same.

Good strong and pleasant hops smell but it can't do justice to the taste experience. The taste begins with crisp, sharp hops. Bitter but pleasant and rich tasting, more pine than citrus. As the beer warms up, the hops do not give way, but there is a strong caramel malt taste as an undercurrent. The mouthfeel is incredibly rich, not as oily / resinous as Celebration Ale...more crisp.

Pours a beautiful burgandy brown with a considerable fluffy head. Pungent floral hops abound along with a good deal of pine and just a tad of citrus. A hop explosion in the taste. Floral and citrus-y hops mainly with lots of caramel sweetness. But make no mistake, this is a hop loaded brew. The alcohol doesn't make itself known in the taste even at 8%.

The rye shows up very nicely. and a bit of citrusy hop flavor comes thru shortly thereafter. Mouthfeel is very smooth, some resiny texture towards the finish, nice and moist.

My mouth is watering already. Rye and bitter hoppy feel battle as they hit the tongue. Mineral bitter is long and persistant throughout the palate.

Little carbonation activity in a still glass, but swirling produces many tiny bubbles that ascend in streams from the side and bottom of the glass. Aromas of pungent rye spiciness and malt sweetness. The hop aroma is on a level with the rye spice and seems hidden but reveals itself with a mild raw cone smell. Taste is explosive. I love rye beer and this is a tasty one. There is a hazelnut nuttiness that's pretty subtle. The malt is not hidden and is the beer's source of sweetness. Bitter and dry-hopped flavors are of grapefruit. Mouthfeel is very smooth to creamy. With so many positive flavors and textures the result is a complex and delicious brew. Everything just comes together for a solid aroma/flavor profile. Bear Republic is above average and consistent with it's quality. Decant this beer to keep the yeast sediment in the bottle.","mshallah","Aug 29, 2007"

The aroma is very strong hops, along with a light smell of sweet malt and caramel. The flavor is absolutely wonderful! A good balance of the hops and malts. Citrusy hops dominate the front, followed closely by the malt, and finishing with a sweet caramel flavor. Very complex and full. Medium mouthfeel. Extreme flavor and higher than usual abv. keep this from being an all-night drinker, but still exceptionally drinkable for an IPA. Overall, I was very impressed with this ale.

The rye is a nice addition to this brew. Mouthfeel is medium, slick, creamy and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good too, the alcohol is well hidden and it's good and tasty.

4.68,10.6,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Pours out a rusty hazelnut with plenty of carbonation present in the body. Head is thick, creamy, and beige, and holds up extremely well. There are some dimples atop the foam and with each sip there is left some lacing that reminds me of the residue left by the steamed milk on a cappuccino. The aroma is of citrus, vanilla custard, toffee, caramel, cane syrup, and a little hint of rye. Alcohol merely peaks out from this, but is well subdued considering the strength. In the flavor, malts start off sweet, bready and with dried fruits and caramel. The hops start to push into the middle then come into the forefront by the finish. Flavor is mostly citric but there are undertones of pine, earth, and strong herbs such as rosemary. A very understated rye makes itself known amongst the hops, which I think works well, but I would rather the rye to be a little more present. The bitterness does not overstep the sweet malts in the end, rather they create a balance. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, moderate to full, and the carbonation is extremely mellow. It's rare to find a beer of this strength as being this drinkable, but you don't notice it while you drink. Amazing beer.","goochpunch","May 31, 2007"

I can't tell that rye has been used but for damn sure know that this is for the hopheads. Citrus, fruity hops and a malty balance that makes this one mouth watering. Not quite thirst quenching but for sure mouth watering on the tongue. Silky smooth and just utterly great. Very drinkable beer here, although I do like the more standard IPAs as well.

The appearance was a dark amber with a slight ruby shine, also held a beige two finger head. Left an excellent amount of sticky and salty lacing (lip smacking). Darkest AIPA I've seen to date. The smell was phemon. A blast of grapefruit citrus upfront with a some piney in the middle. Also experienced a hint of caramel, nutty malt and toffee. The taste began slightly sweet plum that was well balanced with the hoppy blast toward the end. Somewhere in the middle this southern biscuit shine through. This brew felt middle to full, bold, slightly oily and crisp with a dry ending. The only down fall was, with a long drive ahead of us, we could only have one drink.

There was an exceptionally fluffy white head. There is a lot of rye and hops in the aroma. It has a good malt profile as a backbone though. The flavor is very complex. Initially there is a good sweet maltiness followed by a equal amount of hop bitterness over the sweetness. It finishes very balanced, maybe even a bit on the sweet side.

The hops are definitely the star of the show, dominant but not overbearing, a biscutty, caramel malt doing it job balancing thing out and the mouth only magnifies the beauty, its velvety smoothness, well tempered carbonation, and coating, full body making this a fantastic beer to drink. In other words, I continue to be impressed with the beers Bear Republic puts out, and would dare to say they are massively underrated, or at least much under-hyped.

The aroma is spicy and piney/floral with a bit of malty sweetness and rye poking through. The initial flavour is of malt and rye, if only for about .05 seconds, before the hop onslaught displays the back of its hand and gives me a proper pimp-slap. That lasts for a good long while until the malt backbone of this beer regains its footing and melds with the hops for a nice complex finish. Green piney hops with floral notes, toffeeish and rye malt, bread-yeast, bitter orange rind, almond-hazelnut, and a smidge of bittersweet chocolate.

Aroma of piney hops reaches out and grabs the olfactory senses, leaving room for little else to be considered. Palate is more balanced - lots of piney hops up front, tempered by a blend of sweet caramel malt and rye after it sits on the tongue for a second. Finish is both sweet and dry - a product of the rye, I suppose. Body is rather creamy, a nice and rare character for an IPA. Very drinkable, and not much betrays the fact that this clocks in at 8%.

It has nice aromas of grapefruit and citrus. Taste is a great balance of sweet raisiny malts and bitter citrusy hops.

Since trying this beer I have found myself buying more rye bread for sandwiches as I have discovered I really enjoy it.

Just guessing but seems to have a boatload of Cascade and Amarillo hops. It is a huge beer, to say the least. Considering the quality of this beer and the respectable price per bomber, Ill definitely be coming back to this one again. My first Bear Republic offering after always seeing them for years.

It's flavorful...bitter and hoppy with a nice creamy, bready taste underneath. The bitterness on this beer isn't super strong at first but it grows and then holds steady throughout the drinking period. I do like it very much indeed.

Thick lacing along the sides of the glass. Classic west coast hoppy aroma loaded with freshly cut grapefruit and pine needles. Mouthfeel is quite full and round with just the right amount of carbonation for this style. Immediate flavors of spicey rye, orange, grapefruit and some lightly roasted malts make their presence. Although of course the hops dominate there is a notable background malt sweetness which balances it all out nicely. Finish is long, crisp and moderately bitter.

Initial aroma is mainly a nice sweet orange smell, there is also a little grassiness that works in as it warms. There is also some sugary sprite like sweetness with a yeasty bread aroma. Taste is a nice balance between the sweet and bitter with a nice zip and a slight tanginess as well. There is a nice spice to the finish and a slight dryness. The alcohol is well balanced, I don't really notice it until the very end as it is pretty much at room temp. Easy to drink.","hoppymeal","Aug 27, 2006"

A nice, dark amber/almost brownish body with a wafty tan head. Smell was of bittering hops and bready, toasty malt. A nice combination.

Pours a traditional brown-red color, with a very interesting wavy cascade effect and lacing that seems to last for the life of the beer. Smell is strong, and is a nice mixture of hops and malt together. There is also a big chewy smell that is very enticing. Boy, does the taste sure deliver! The first quarter is heavy on the malt with the sweetness hitting immidiatly and playing on our tongue. The next big taste has the malt and hops together, and they create a synergistic effect that leaves you craving more. There is also a taste that is foreign to me, but I will say its Rye, as its a main ingredient in the beer. As this beer goes down it lingers for a while with a pleasant sweetness of the malts, and even at 8% there is no appearance of alcohol. Truely a special beer!","Toddv29424","Aug 20, 2006"

4.5,6.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Rye grains in any other beer style doesn't work for me. But in an IPA, I think it adds character and an intense bittering. An otherwise, great IPA has been improved with some serious hopping and a rye grain flavor / astringency than any malt base cannot compete with. Sweet, of course, but quickly dominated with hop citrus, pine, grass, and dirty flavors. Rye contributes a deep molassas bitter-sweetness and a grain husk bittering. Perhaps too astringent to make it easy drinking. Otherwise malty sweet with a dark toasted grain flavor. Bitter til the end with a shadowing sweetness, muskiness, and earthiness.

Taste was very hoppy like most IPA's but with a different background, again probably the rye, excellent flavor but not the regular sweet malt flavor you get in most IPA's.

3.77,-10.9,5,3,4,3.5,4,"Bottle from Hogtownharry: Poured a dark amber color ale with huge foamy off-white heat with great retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus hops with good malt backbone is very interesting. Taste is a mix between semi-sweet caramel malt with some c-hops that provide a bitter finish. Rye is quite hard to distinguish and doesnt seem to provide that much in the overall mix. Body is slightly above average and alcohol is well hidden. Very well done overall but definitely not a style (American strong ale) that really excite me.","Phyl21ca","Jun 19, 2006"

The smell is robust and full piney floral hops, a definite rye tinge and even some woody notes, very herbal. The taste is nice, more roasted malt than I had expected...and almost perfectly balanced....wow again.

The taste is somewhat more balanced than what the smell would have you believe. Citrusy hops from the start that are replaced with bready malts in the middle before the hops smack you again.

Nose is oat and bread malts with wonderful fruit esters, pine, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is massages the tongue like the older girl who taught you how to kiss in high school.

Spicy and bitter but not overdone. Caramel and bready flavors balance it out. Bitterness wins but the malts add another element of flavor. A slight alcohol burn lends a hand towards the finish. Rye seems to be there but really brings out a spicy, sweet finish with some hop flavor melded together. Slick body with the right amount of spicyness and pricklyness.

Aroma -citrus, and diacetyl malt. Taste - the citrus hops, of course and slight diacetyl, somewhat less than aroma had me expecting, which is good because I rather dislike the diacetyl taste, instead the malt had a small somewhat doughy taste upfront, which I suspect is due to the rye, but then diacetyl aftertaste made unusally bitter by the citrusy hops. The mouth was fairly smooth owing to the hops, and somewhat more carbonated than I expect or want for an IPA, leaving a slightly thick, and bitter coating. Diacetyl usaully ruins a brew for me and this is the case here- Hop Rod was an okay ride- but one I think will let pass me by when hitchhiking the HopHead Highway.","ultralarry2006","Mar 30, 2006"

The bouquet includes mango, some rye tang, pineapple, mandarin oranges, ruby red grapefruit, pine, and some alcohol. Smells wonderful. It tastes similar to the aroma with the addition of caramel/buttery malts, biscuits, and a healthy bitterness on top of a big, creamy, chewy body. This is quite drinkable and a nice take on an IPA. I like the rye kick, as it blends well with the other flavors and doesn't overpower them. Delicious.","mmmbeer","Mar 28, 2006"

Appearance is a dark amber similar to what I would expect from a winter warmer, head is creamy similar to a Guiness. This beer explodes with aromas of pine and citrus,more than I've ever experienced in an IPA. Taste is similar to smell with pine and citrus as the predominant flavors with a strong bite at first taste. Mouthfeel is smooth after the initial carbonation bite, the 8% alcohol is hidden pretty well. After drinking for a while I notice quite the build up in my mouth of hops. Drinkability, I would put simply as I would have no problem downing a bomber but as with most strong IPA's I'd better be home if I wanted to have another.

Thin tan head on top that wasn't sticking around for the whole ride. The nose was of big, citrusy hops, very little pine in this one, lots of citrus, also a heavy nose of rye. The taste is sweet malt that is dominated by the rye flavor that doesn't overwhelm, but doesn't hide either. Thick citrus flavor sticks to your mouth while drinking this amazing beer. I made the comment that I almost wanted to drop some saurkraut and swiss cheese in it. I would definiately pair this with a lighter flavored cheese, or a reuben sandwich.

The nose is a perfect balance of muted hops, rye and toasty caramel malts with a slight burnt aspect. Based on other reviewers, I really think there's quite a bit of bottle age on this one. I venture at least a year, perhaps more. Flavor upfront is wide and expansive toasty, rye, very slightly sweet. Muted by underlying bitterness, but that seems very muted as well like the hop flavor. There's some definite age to this. This could almost fit into the old ale category, not IPA. That said, the balance is spectacular. Very slow evolving flavor, and ponderous as slight hops ebb in and out between substantial malt and alcohol/rye spice. At this stage the rye is very evident. Very full in the mouth with light carbonation, perfectly creamy. Very drinkable, but due to the age, ponderous. I like it this way, though, i am sure, a completely different animal than when fresh. Shouldn't even be considered the same beer. That said, anyone with ready access to this should try aging it a bit.","numenor1","Feb 27, 2006"

4.88,15.4,5,4.5,5,5,5,"Ok, let's be honest here, this beer pours so damn dark, if it were just a few shades darker, it'd be black. Dark brown with ruby edges and a nice velvety dense head that fires off aroma at you. Hitting you from every angle ... pine, followed by grapefruit and then smooth caramel malt. A sip treats the tongue to initial bitterness followed by a whallop of pine and grapefruit. The malt smoothes things out followed by fleeting grain and an citrusy orange taste. Mouthfeel is big, which is just what I want in a brew like this. Your tongue will say yes to more and more of this but beware, with an 8% ABV, respect is in order. The only Double IPA I've had that can even try to stand up to this is Hercules by Great Divide. Even then though, I wouldn't be shocked to see the mighty Hercules fall.

The aftertaste is nicely bittered, but not a whole lot of malt to balance. The mouthfeel is a little thin for a beer this big, but the drinkability is stellar.

4.3,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"If Bear Republic was available to me locally, it would quickly become my favority brewery Hop Rod Rye strenthens this sentiment as everything about this wonderful beer smacks of it being extremely well made. This starts with its beautiful appearance, the color of which is very dark amber. A huge tan head forms that never really completely disappears. Instead, it just gets rockier and rockier unitl it looks like a snow covered mountain top. The lacing is so thick, you can't see through it. The aroma is very strong full of a gloriously resinous hoppiness, obviously from the Pacific Northwest. The taste picks this up and a beautiful, but never harsh, hoppiness asserts itself. This is supported by a very nice malt base that keeps it from becoming too harsh. The rye begins to come through towards the finish and gives this beer a unique character when compared to other IPAs. The mouthfeel is great, nice and thick and chewy. The drinkability is dangerous at 8%. As I've already said, this is a superb beer that packs a punch from start to finish. It reeks of class.","Hagbard","Dec 05, 2005"

The aroma is strong pine hops but the dry smell is definately the rye. The rye isn't that strong but i like it. Same goes for the taste. Pine trees and rye. To me this tastes very similar to racer 5 when it comes to bitterness, maybe even less flavor. But it seems more well rounded and interesting. A coarse tasting beer that is still pleasant. Very drinkable.","kbnooshay","Dec 04, 2005"

Taste starts off with a hearty pine-hop kick but as it warms transitions into caramel malt, sweet pineapple, apricot and citrus. A faint rye bitterness can be detected but I wouldn't have guessed there was rye in it without the name. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. This is a highly drinkable DIPA, the alcohol is well-hidden.

I stick a finger into the densely honeycombed bubbles, and they actually ooze upwards along my finger... not the kind of behavior you expect from a beer operating under the normal constraints of physical law. Beer is very dark in color--almost mahogany--with highlights of glowing auburn, copiously streaked through by steady-rising lines of carbonation. From the bottle I smell fresh papaya, but out of the glass this just reeks of hops. Nosefeel is fragrant and arid, with a framework of dried-out hops; dry leaves and berries; and piney, aromatic, sage-like herbs. The flavors seem almost entirely free of sweetness. Pumpernickel bread and cedar blend with an array of dried spices, everything held together by spicy seed-oils. Hop bitterness penetrates deeply but melts away with perfect timing, dissolving into a finish of beeswax and clover that absolutely fills the mouth. The rye element has just made things so, soooo smooth. Drinkability is off the fucking hook. I've had three bombers of this in my life, and I'm pretty sure not one of them has lasted much longer than ten minutes. Yum.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Sep 25, 2005"

The hops clear my sinuses. I taste mellow bitter hops and rye spiciness. Full body, rich smooth and spicy mouthfeel. Finish is long, bitter and dry, and very tasty. I just can't get enough. So full and rich. An extremely drinkable beer. I just can't get enough. I've only ever had two rye beers but judging from these two, I like rye in my beer a great deal.

The first sip: wow! didn't expect malt like that. There's an incredible balance here with the hops bringing up the back end, but that malt sweetness is right there up front. And mind you, it's not an out-of-place sweetness. The hops are definitely there, but I'm a bit surprised that they're not beating my palate up and down the block as the name and label description led me to believe. This is not a bad thing, though. If I can't quite accept the characterization of this beer as a hoppy monster, that still doesn't prevent me from enjoying it immensely. In the mouth this one is nice and chewy, with a full, creamy body. Damn if that 8% abv is not hidden better than those magical Iraqi wmds.

Bigass pungent hop aroma that lets you know exactly what you are getting into. Hop character here is totally off the hook. "Dual overhead hop injection" indeed. Extremely floral, piney, citric, and bitter, with the rye significantly adding to the spicy kick and only minimal sweetness from the malts. Rye and hop aftertaste lasts seemingly forever.

The true heart of this beer is like any other IPA and DIPA its in the hop flavor and bitterness. This is amazingly hopped up but yet still has enough malt character to keep it somewhat in check. Apricot comes to mind, citrusy and plenty of hop oils to slicken things up. Surprisingly it finishes fairly clean although it was a bit oily. Every drink was enjoyable.

Tan in color over a crystal clear brown liquid with ruby and blood red notes. Smells mild and clean citrus hoppy. Grapefruit pith and tangerine. Toasted grains. Tastes, whoa...gentle to start. Sweet with strong apricot and malt over a rising hop flavor and bitter. Lupulin is stronger than co-humulone for the hops and it's really mouthfeel creamy smooth. Caramel is found deep beneath, but there is also a malty zing that fights the hoppy grapefruit pith. Mouthfeel is md-thick and carbonation is mild (but stingy).

Taste is a citrusy hop paradise that cools off at the last moment into a easy drinking sweetness.

This brew is very hoppy, with rye and a wee bit of malt (sweet toffee/caramel flavors are in here they're just a little shy and intimidated by the hops) to make this so complex.

I could smell hops as soon as I started pouring the beer. Plenty of citrus and floral hop aroma, to the point of being perfumy due to quantity. Malt is in there as well, a little bready, with an almost gingerbread quality that also shows up in the flavour. Complex hop flavours that are in balance with each other and are absolutely amazing. Grapefruit hop flavour is present all the way through, with a bit of pine resin, some hop spice, and orange. Maltiness is slightly grainy and quite drying. Assertive bitterness, just short of aggressive, that balances very well with the malt. Long, dry, bitter finish. Full bodied with medium carbonation and a rich, creamy texture. This is really, really good beer. The combination of rye with the high hopping rate works very well.","DrJay","May 25, 2005"

Hints of holly. Incredibly dry, hoppy and citrusy. The usage of rye really accompanies the dryness imparted by the high alpha hops.

The rye aroma really stuck out and gave a different nose to the prominent hops. The taste was started out with a little sweetness followed by the crucial hop bitterness. The finish brought back almost and orange sweetness followed by a dry ending. The hops suck out every drop of saliva you have left in your mouth.

Mouthfeel was enjoyably creamy for a hop monster, and the thick mouth-drying experience was interestingly combined with refreshing and sweet notes of grain, in a slightly sticky syrupy way.

Taste is mostly about the hops (see Aroma, above), but there is a body and smoothness over the tongue that defies you to just pigeonhole it as another bottle of hops.

Slightly minty flavors, closest to spearmint, acidic with scouring resiny hops. The malts are interesting, combine with the hops to give a wood sense, but aromatic and biting, almost like cedar.

An amber on the darker side pours a brownish tawny red color with the foamy off-white head retaing for quite a while. Smells bitter and hoppy, with a sweetness rarely found in a west coast IPA. That's a good sign. It's east enough to get excited about the overly hopped west coast IPA monsters but I think the real gems are the ones that are more complex and balanced. This is one of those beers. The hops are bitter, not too in your face, all though fully a main asset to this beer. At the same time, it's not all this beer has to offer. The bitterness comes in waves and is accented my sweet mellow malts and a light bready character. As the beer warms it tends to get more spicy, bready, and herbal. Definate complexity in this beer. Such a refreshing beer from the west coast. Disconfirms my previously growing opinions that every brewery from the west coast is going to hop the shit out of beers and that's it. Much more attention here paid to detail and a great dry yet somehow creamy texture. I'll definately go back to this one. Hella sweet or something. Wicked. Whatever....","twelvsies","Jan 31, 2005"

The flavor has the rye nuttiness up front followed quickly by the hop flower. Explosions of pine accented my the rye. I think this may be more interesting in this bottle form than it is on tap.

The underlying malt was broken up a bit by the aroma of rye.

The high alcohol content is masked extremely well by a wonderful blend of rye, sweet malts, and a ton of hops. My tounge feels totally alive as a result of a more than generous share of hops.

This came in the usual 22ozer from BR with a hop rod car on the label. This poured out a nice dark amber color with a good sized rocky beige head. Nice rings of lacing were left around the glass as I drank this. Aroma is full of hops as the name would suggest as well as a bready malt presence. I could also smell the rye distinctly after a few sips as it warmed which added nicely to the aroma. The taste opens up with light malt sweetness and hints of rye before the hop rod drives through your palette and deliver a good does of earthy hops and a nice bitter rye aftertaste. This beer is perfectly balanced, not overpowering in any aspect but not weak in any either. This has a nice medium mouthfeel with good carbonation.

Its resinous, pine-like, peppery, sticky, medium bodied, and very bitter. The bitterness runs throughout the entire taste, and creeps from the back of your tongue to fill your entire mouth. I have trouble discerning the ryetheres a bready, grain-like backbone, but its not as intense as a lot of rye beers. The finish is hoppy, peppery, and bitter.

The "in your face" nose had a firm and grainy malt profile, with a super-charged volatile hop bouquet I imagined distorting the air above the glass. The taste reflected the nose, starting with a robust dry nutty roasted malt backbone wrapped up in a superbly monstrous bitter finish that got the blood pumping. A touch a sweetness at the end rounded out this finely tuned package, and left me captivated and completely satisfied. The full and muscular body matched the full flavor spot on.

The taste is an intense slap of that trademark west-coast hoppiness, with a malt sweetness that gives way to a dry hop aftertaste that lingers, with a bone-dry finish that feels as though the rye had come to lay the hopped wasteland of my tastebuds out to dry.

Taste is very highly hopped, but the rye and roasted grain flavors blend exceptionally well. This is really an extraordinary beverage! The rye bread flavor is a very hardy backbone for the orangerind and pine hop flavors that weave in and out, and all around this flavorful brew. Very chewy, and tastes like liquid food at times. Floral and fruity notes jump around the flavor profile as well. This is one of the finest ales I've sampled in quite some time. Complex and full of flavor, this is one kickass beer. A beautiful work of art that satisfies in all respects. Highly recommended!","merlin48","Feb 15, 2004"

First the Hop Rod Rye, which poured a luscious deep and clear mahogony from the 22 oz. bomber, bearing (pardon the pun) a quintessential Healdsburg hot rod on the label. To top it off there was a thick pearl-white head that receded slowly into a lovely and sticky lace. The folks in Sonoma are not prevaricating--the hops are front and center in the aroma, but still balanced with an overlay of malts (is this the rye?). Yes, I think so, and perhaps that's the reason for the slight smoky tinge in the taste. Oh, the hops are still most evident, but the Bear Republic brewers manage to get in a coal or two somewhere in the process (though not as prevalent here as in the Red Rocket).

A reddish mahogany beer with a whitish head. Lots of lace is left on the sides of the glass. The aroma features generous "west coast" hopping of a pine cone character and also more than a hint of citrus. Rye is noticeable along with the malt in the backbone. Smooth in the mouth, even a bit creamy. Maltiness at the very front of a rye grain character, followed very soon by a big piney hop bite, and then filled out with a big backbone of rye character. Hints of citrus all around. Bitterness comes out on top at the end for a crisp, dry finish. Excellent beer, my favorite from this brewery, although I actually prefer the bottled version of this one.

Not sure how much of this could be the rye, though. Only the drinkability suffers as a result. Finishes with long lasting hoppy goodness, but a little too dry.

Nice malt backbone, strong bitterness, and sweetness from the malt, alcohol, and a little bit of resiny hop sweetness. Then that rye aftertaste blends very well with the residual hop bitterness.

Wild malt (6 row?) and edgy rye flavors are completely separate from sharp grapefruit, zesty orange peel, light lemon and a hint of metallic tanginess. A touch of toffee sweetness does little to counter sharp flavors, but that's ok. All of these sharp edged flavors are accompanied by a constantly noticeable alcohol kick.

Aroma: The combonation of piney and floral hops blended with the rye are such a great combonation here, this is one of those classic beers buttery hops in your face but not over done what a great scent I would buy soap that smells like this if it was available. Taste: So much hop flavor yet not too much bitterness it's like they added hop extract or something to make the perfect blend of pine, this isn't all hops the malts make an appearance here they act as sweetened butter coated on lucious steamed hop buds with the rye here to accent all of the flavors this is by far the best rye beer I have ever tasted b/c they didn't try to make the rye the dominant flavor. Mouthfeel is medium in body but the smoothness of this beer going down is impeccable perfect amount of carbonation so easy drinking this one deserves awarded across the board. There is no hype behind this beer and by the quality and great flavor of this beer I am sure that the rest of the Bear Republic lineup in my fridge is going to be just as prosperous.

I am ignoring the rye ingredient. Very strong hops some malt slips through. Leaves a velvetty mouth feel. Alcohol is not noticable until you drink this 22 oz bottle.

As for the rye, maybe there is a certain fullness/ silkiness fro the rye, but it is not all that evident, the hops overpower any taste that one might get from the rye character as well.

If you're expecting a wildly different brew you might be disappointed. At its heart, HRR is an IPA...albeit one with a twist. It pours a deep mahogany with a sticky beige head that lasts throughout consumption. I can't help but draw comparisons, and this brew is reminiscent of yet another outstanding beer...Great Divide's Hibernation Ale. Citric, piney hops are assertive in the taste yet there is a mountain of dark crystal malt providing balance. There is a slight spicy-sweet crackle in the finish...again, like sweet gingerbread.

Significant rings of lace, which stick firmly to glass. Great citrus aroma, the taste is there, but a little overpowered by the hop bitterness. This one ranks similar to the Rogue IPA in that regard.

Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Hop Rod Rye goes down so easily. The taste is a complex and layered offering. Again, hops dominate the initial impression with flavors of pine and citrus combining for a pleasant bitterness. Typical Northwest hop flavor pulls through in the profile.

3.55,-16.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Ive only had 3 or 4 other rye beers, and none were brewed to this gravity, so its hard for me to comprehend if the harshness is being contributed by the rye, or if this beer is simply assertively hopped. Heres the bottom line: it tastes to me like Hop Rod Rye had a single addition of LOTS of American hops at the beginning of a 90 minute boil, and there they sat: losing most their flavor and aroma, while the whole time, more and more bitterness was extracted. At the same time, the liberal use of crystal malts created an interplay that I frequently find in big, American ales: harsh bitter. Im just guessing, so I dont know what really happened. I know Im wrong about the hopping schedule, because theres a good shot of citrus in the nose and I know I can taste some flowery hops underneath the other flavors. Plus, my burps reveal a wonderful hop character that I missed going down. This beer just exhibits a character that I taste too often in American, specifically west coast (Rogue and SN to be really specific) hyper-hopped beer: harsh bitterness. Having tasted 90 Minute IPA and Ruination, I know its possible to make a beer with over 100 IBUs taste extraordinarily hoppy and not be painfully bitter. In fact, those beers are two of my favorite all time brews. Oh well, they cant all get 4.5+ scores. Id rather have MANY other beers over this one. I guess Im kinda bored with tasting hyper-hopped beers that are extraordinarily bitter, but display very little hop flavor. Onward and upward","TXHops","Apr 02, 2003"

There are some suspended particles of yeast & hop, but it's only slightly hazy beyond that. The aroma offers a light fruitiness, a gently sweet maltiness, and some sweetly citrusy/lightly piney hops. The body is full, oily, and quite creamy as it warms in the mouth, supported by a moderate and very fine carbonation from bottle conditioning. But the flavor is what really caught my attention! Richly malty with a toffee-ish sweetness, boldy fruity, lightly spicy, and well-infused with bold hop flavor and a firm, but balanced, bracing bitterness. It's quite unique. Although there's only a small percentage used, I guess it's the rye that really helps to give it its distinct character. There's certainly some caramel malt going on, but it also has a spicy edge to it. It finishes dry with a short burst of malt sweetness up-front, and then a long lasting mild piney hop flavor and bitterness. A really flavorful and complex beer that pulls no punches and has exceptional drinkability. Absolutely worth seeking out.","NeroFiddled","Nov 15, 2002"
4.57,8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a dark amber with a thin white head,  Tastes great.  I love hops, and I love a new tasting beer with alot of hops.  This beer has a taste of its own.  Along with having a great hop aroma, mouthfeel, and aftertaste, it has a refreshing rye malt flavor to it.  I love it!  Thanks Xlperro!","jtw5877","Oct 30, 2002"

4.89,15.6,4,5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a great looking dark amber color with a creamy tan head that holds tight and rings the glass very nicely.  Wonderful fruity/piney hoppiness as well as some nice sweet malt.  The first thing to hit my tongue was the insane hoppiness of this brew.  As the hops begin to back off there are some great fruity esters that give this beer a very nice complexity that is perfect for a fall/winter seasonal.  The finish sees the return of the hops as they jump into the foreground again and stick around on the tongue for quite some time.  Very creamy and crisp with the awesome hoppiness providing a light and refreshing quality to this brew that makes it extremely drinkable.  This is just one awesome beer and I can't wait tot ry some more of Bear Republic's brews.","Murph","Oct 11, 2002"

4.38,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Deep dark color nearly resembles the bottle in which it came out of. Nice looking head that seems to want to hug the sides of my glass. The taste reminds me of Stone's Arogant Bastard, but not as bastardly. The aroma is decent and warns you of what's about to pass your lips and invade the mouth. This is the second beer I've had from Bear Republic and, once again, I am not disappointed. These guys put out a great beer here.","sinistersteve","Aug 20, 2002"
5,18.2,5,5,5,5,5,"Good god.  Hop Rod Rye is royalty in peasants clothing.  Assertive and mature hop/rye characteristics.  A tricky trilateral balance between the three key ingrediants.  Somehow this brew is able to maintain an equilibrium.  The hops is undoubtedly seated top of the pyramid, but a keen sense can easily distinguish the awesome barley/rye essenses.  Silky and lubricating mouthfeel.  Notes of toasted barley, wood, resinous hop cones, and of course... rye.  A prost to Bear Republic, undesputed brewery of the west coast.","Jordan","Aug 11, 2002"
4.64,9.7,4,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Hazt, tawny, dark bronze hue, topped by an off - white head comprised of heterogenously sized bubbles.  Excellent Belgian lace is left down the glass.  Piney, grapefruity, resiny in your face Pacific Northwest hop 4 C hop nose (seemingly dominated by Chinook) hits the nose upfront, but dark caramel and toffee are discernible-- there's only a hint of rye spiciness towards the end of the aroma.  Hop bitterness dominates as expected, but although very assertive, is quite clean & manages to allow spicy rye and the rich, toffeeish malt profile to surface.  Meduim bodied, w/ a slick, proteinaceous, coating mouthfeel from the rye.  Pine hop flavor.  Finishes w/ a puckering bitterness that leaves me craving more, while seemingly out of nowhere biscuit malt eeks its way in.  Hop Rod Rye is tremendously flavorful and rich-- it's not unlike Red Rocket Ale minus the roasted barley notes.  Delicious.","marc77","Jul 23, 2002"
4.7,11.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"It's bourbon color with a nice lasting head.  The smell is the familiar northwest-style knock-out hops.  I've never had a rye beer before, but it definitely has a unique and satisfying taste.  This beer's a bit sweet with a distinctive flavor that balances out the sweetness.  For a beer of its abv, it's eminently drinkable.  It's good to see such nice beers coming out of the Golden State.","mickeymac","Jun 02, 2002"
4.59,8.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"An amber-/brown mix in the color.  A frothy head that clings on the glass.  A beautiful hop aroma.  Very bitter.  Nice bite. I like it.  The rye is ever so subtle, but nice.  A big beer.  I'm really catching the NW hop varieties in this one.","Bighuge","Mar 27, 2002"
