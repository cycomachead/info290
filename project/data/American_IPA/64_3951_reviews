"This was an okay beer. I was hoping for more apricot. I'm only a little disappointed, as it was still a decent beer, but as I said above, I won't be getting again."
""
"Amazing aroma and the flavor is not too fruity.  Great balance malt with subtle hints of apricot."
""
"didn't even finish it but I can see where people like it.   Good for the style but not my thing"
""
""
"Apricots and hops shouldn't jive, but they do."

"Total (32/50) – Very Good – Generally within style parameters, some minor flaws"

"Very hoppy beer, not as fruity as I would like it to be. Pretty golden color and nice head, a nicely crafted IPA even though I don't love IPAs"
""
""
""
""
"smells like adjunct. cheap aroma (sorry), taste is okay, decent IPA, but a little novelty. okay brew, great ""reaching out", but just not great.... i'm okay with it."
"O: The beer is very well balanced and provides an interesting interplay between the yeast driven flavors, the hop flavors, the malts and the added apricots."
""
"Avg IPA - not bad, but not worthy of a 6pack either"
""
"I usually don't like any extra ingredients in an IPA, but this is an exception.  Shares a similar flavor profile with DFH 60 and 90 Minute IPA, but with enough sweetness to round the edges off and make it extremely drinkable.  I wouldn't have probably called apricot if I hadn't known, but it's a good fit; there's a definite fruity hop flavor but its not overpowering.  There are many IPAs where the hops alone are more citrus tasting than this, but this is a perfect balance.  Looks and smells great as well.  Another amazing beer from one of the truly best, most original breweries in a crowded field."
""
""
""
"I wasn’t expecting anything special (especially hearing about this beers track record), but it really surprised me. It is incredibly well-balanced. Not overly bitter or sweet, with a nice citrus presence. As normally with a DFH beer, the pairings are endless. I could see it pairing well with roasted pork, bacon brussel sprouts, and an apricot and pineapple chutney. It gets a 86/100 from me."
""
"Would be a great ipa if they had some hops to back up the apricot."
"Poured from a bottle into a 16 oz pint glass, nice rich amber color with a soapy white head. Smells of malt, alcohol, and hint of apricot. The taste is a pleasant balance of malt, hop, and slightly tart fruit with some apparent booziness and a dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pleasant and light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours amber, orange with a medium white head.  Mild fruit smells.  Mild fruit taste, the apricot taste is not evident.  Mild carbonation, but kind of flat.  Overall kind of underwhelming."
""
""
""
"Definitely not what I was expecting. Tastes like a watered down IPA with a slightly sweet finish. I do not taste any apricot."
"This was an okay beer in my mind.  As an IPA it was an okay beer, but I was expecting and wanting something more refreshing and citrusy.  I thought it actually lacked apricot flavor.   Don't get me wrong, I wasn't looking for a juicy type beer, but just didn't taste the apricot as much as I wanted to.  It was a nice beer, but I thought it was very average."
""
"I was looking for a little more apricot in this one. Kinda dry without the bite that other DF beers offer"
""
""
""
""
"I've enjoyed this in the past, but this was just malty, old hops with no apricot to be found."
"A very good brew. Check it out."
""
"O - 3 - Underwhelming as hell. As a specialty beer, this is boring. As your everyday, readily available, average IPA, it's OK at best."
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is a good beer.  I was impressed in the color and taste and was very happy with these.  I was a little disappointed by the smell but the overall feel and taste of this beer more than makes up for it.  I would definitely buy this again.  This is a unique beer that I had high expectations for especially since I like apricots and like most of Dogfish Head's offerings.  I would not necessarily consider this an IPA so much as a pale ale with the lacking hops I've come to expect with an IPA.  (I could be biased expecting something closer to a double IPA but who know.)  I know this is listed as a seasonal offering but when/if you find this I would recommend giving it a shot.  I would love to try this fresh out of a keg!!!"

"Pours a deep clear amber with a nice thick white head. The head has moderate retention and leaves some nice small sticky lacing. The aroma is pretty minimal, with just light mild hints of malt. The taste is not much more distinct, with only a faint hint of fruit. The apricot is hard to be found. The body has a nice easy drinking weight to it, smooth throughout. I've had this before on draft and it was much more noticeably apricot and IPA."
""
"Aprihop at first had a mild hop taste with a background of the apricot. It tasted great but as I moved through the bottle the taste was overwhelmed by the carbonation. So from the middle to the end of the bottle, I wasn't sure what I was drinking. Dogfish is my favorite brewery so I going to open another one and reevaluate."

"O- a well balanced fruit beer that's not too fruity"
""
"O: Tough call on this one. Was expecting a little more bitterness and apricot, instead it's quite floral with even a little roasty quality to it and very faint apricot. Still drinkable, but not my favorite."
"I like apricot beers like magic hat 9.  This is so much better.  It had a very nice citrusy nose that made a nice ipa out of this.  Highly recommended"
""
"I really liked this beer. This is a great refreshing IPA from sweet undertones."
""
""
""
"One of my favorite seasonal dogfish head beers. Period the end!"
""
""
"no apricot flavor whatsoever...taste like regular ipa with a tad less bitterness...unremarkable"
"Smelled ok I guess, but was REALLY turned off by the tart apricot taste. Was bitter (not in a good way)  and dank tasting. Aftertaste like rancid fruit. I only bought two thankfully and ended up giving the other one away to a buddy who didn't like it either. Not sure where they went wrong with this one really. Just a really bad taste combination with too much hops to go well with the bitter apricots. Nearly a drainpour, and the most disappointing beer I've ever had from DFH."
"Smell of apricot and citrus taste the same goes down smooth"
"D: No surprises here in flavor. It tastes just like it smells with a mixture of classic Dogfish Head IPA hoppy kick."
""
"I get fruit, just not apricot"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Delicious and perfectly balanced, has a fruit touch and tastes great for something a little different."
""
"Nothing great but not bad"
"Very good. The strength of the beer is well masked by the flavor. During a blind tasting I guessed 5%. Fruit foward and the hops were skillfully incorporated."
""
""
"Very nice, bright hoppy flavor with a back end of sweet fruity flavor."
""
"Thought it would have a apricot taste, but it was very light. After you taste the light fruit it goes back to a regular beer taste. This beer has a IPA color almost red in color, with a nice smooth feel and flavor."
"Mouth feel not too bubbly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Instant favorite.  Apricot is very understated which I like"
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle poured into a shaker pint. Clear amber with off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Aroma is citrus and floral hops, some grainy malt, and a touch of apricot. Taste is initially sweet malt but turns to citrus peel hoppy bitterness and closes with apricot flesh on the swallow. Medium body, moderate carbonation, texture is on the slick side, fruity dry finish."
""
"One of my favorite specialty IPA."

"O: not a typical IPA, pretty low on the grassy bitterness, still hoppy and fruity.  I think it would be good for someone who isn't quite into IPAs but tends to be a more of a lager fan or an inbetweener.  Not really my style but I would drink it if someone gave me one."

"Pours a clear, copper color.  1/4 inch head of an off-white color.  Decent retention and slight lacing.  Smells of citrus hops, slight sweet malt, hint of alcohol, hint of pine, and a hint of citrus.  Fits the style of an American IPA.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of citrus, sweet malt, slight caramel malt, slight pine, and slight hops.  Overall, weak appearance, simple aroma, simple body, and hard to distinguish any apricots."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours red orange with very little head. Smells of pine hops and sweet fruit, apricots of course. Tastes of fruit with slight earthy hops. Beer is nicely carbonated finishes nicely. Overall a very good beer."

"O: I'm from Ithaca, NY, where Ithaca Beer Company's Apricot Wheat is famous. This beer trounces that beer. Different styles, for sure, but also a completely different paradigm. Dogfish Head has created a brew that combines fruit beer and IPA into a beautiful harmony. If you know someone who's a little weak-hearted and not a bit IPA fan, this is the kind of brew that could broaden their horizons."
""

"O - This hybrid beer promises fruit, but though I think it is a decent IPA - nothing special, mind, but fairly clean and thoroughly hopped - the fruit is mostly lost. The only hint to its presence is a certain sweetness in the middle. Supporting role, indeed."

"O - quite a let down, more like a fruit beer than an IPA. Taste is medium weight which does not help cause. As it warms it gets more like a stale IPA with a truck load of apricot purée added."
""
""
""
""
""
"For a supposedly decent beer, this is entirely too fizzy, sort of like drinking a flavored club soda. The alleged apricot flavor is completely lost in the fizziness. Not good."

"O:  Refreshing summertime brew.  The apricot flavors add a unique twist to a fairly straight forward IPA."

"Again, like the nose, the roasted malts and mildly bitter hops express themselves in the flavor as they would in a decent amber ale. Then those refreshing apricots tear up the rear. A very nice beer."

"Overall, I love DFH beers but this one was a real disappointment to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark gold/amber with a white head that dissipates leaving a little lacing. The nose is consists of citrus, tropical notes, and some sweetness. The flavor is hoppy and bitter with some citrus flavor. It tastes very much like a regular IPA but with the addition of some slightly bitter juice. The mouthfeel leans towards syrupy and thick. Overall, this is a good IPA but its not great. I prefer 60 minute to this, but wouldn't turn one down if it was given to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think they missed the mark on this one. Lacks the apricot and citrus flavor I expected and replaced it with a pungent earth quality. Overall, it's ok, just not what I expected."

"O: i was a little disappointed. I had this on tap and really liked it (but didn't rate it). This is a bottle review. The bottle born on date says ""2014E 1139"" - I have no idea what the hell that means. Maybe this is a bit faded. It tasted bland to me. There was a slight ""buttery"" taste on the finish, that was interesting, but that was about it."

"Overall- A great and different beer that lives up to its name. Many flavors come together to show off complexity. Definitely can tell the apricots are in there. I liked the sweet malt and hop prescence also. Definitely a creation from DFH that you should try if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Aprihop poured a deep copper amber with a full white head that lingered with good lacing. The aroma was full of citrus and tropical fruit hops which was directly in IPA territory. I detected a slight hint of Apricot but it could have been my mind telling me I should as it was almost imperceptible. The taste was an excellent ride that began with the citrus and tropical fruit hops that melded into sweet apricot and ended with a palate coating bitter pine finish. The sweet apricot expressed itself more as it warmed and help tame the bitter pine finish. Although I was expecting more apricot flavor, the Aprihop stayed true to an IPA with plenty of hop punch, which was a good thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Good to really good beer. Some might think of Dogfish Head as a gimmick brewery but if the gimmicks work, what does it matter? Definitely worth a try, especially since it isn't one of DFH's big and rather expensive, experimental beers."
""
"I'm not an IPA guy. This is an IPA. It is, however, an IPA which is does not suffer the problem of being too hoppy like some are prone to. The low IBU and apricot flavor come together to make this an altogether refreshing and quite tasty beer which has just the right amount of hop flavor that is complemented by the fruit. It also looks pretty damn good. Having had it as part of a tasting at a Total Wine (from a bottle) and on tap at a Dogfish Head restaurant, I can say that this is definitely one of the standouts of theirs that I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy-drinking beer, but the flavor doesn't quite work for me and it's certainly not what I search for in an American IPA. Kudos to DFH for always being so experimental, but why make a mildly-hopped IPA (or American Pale Ale if you want to call it that) with apricots? Why not just make a fruit beer?"

"I was excited to try another of dogfish heads twists on the ipa style and this did not dissappoint. The ale pours a beautiful copper amber hue with a long lasting Off white head and lacing. The nose is the typical dfh blend of citrus and pine hops plus the addition of fresh spring apricots. The mouthfeel is sticky and pleasant coating the palate with an abundance of fresh flavors. The flavor is subtler than the nose in regards to the apricot presence. It is still present but far behind the hops and the malt. This is another great variation on such an overused style, but refreshingly different from a brewery that is almost always refreshingly different."
""
"This is a great Dogfish Head India Pale Ale, but it leaves me wondering what happened to the apricot flavor that I was excited to experience blended with an IPA. You can taste a decent alcohol flavor from this brew ands it boasts a lot of hops, grapefruit, and pine... But just wishing the apricot shined through more. But if you like IPAs and trying new things I would give it a go!"
"Pours a dark but translucent amber. Seems to retain a thin layer of head in this glass which will forever produce carbonation. Smell is very floral and fruity with some definite apricot present. Taste is certainly crisp with some apricot present. Alcohol is certainly not known here as it is hidden quite well. Fairly clean and refreshing. A nice spring/summer release for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I decided to try this rabbit-themed, spring seasonal on Easter Sunday -- What better way to celebrate the Lord's resurrection? An interesting, and very tasty, twist on the traditional American IPA. The bottom line is that it was really easy to drink, and gone before I'd really explored all its depth. I'm afraid I'll need to drink a few more to fully appreciate this one!"
"O: A very enjoyable spring seasonal beer."
"O- I enjoyed this beer. The smell is what I'll remember most, but all the parts were pretty good. The apricot definitely added a nice twist."
"Overall: A pretty solid twist on a IPA. Good juicy apricot taste with a solid caramel malt balance."
"Overall I Liked it but felt it was lacking in the nose and even the pallet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A sweeter IPA that delivers what it promises on the label. Apricot flavour isn't artificial at all, you even get a little bit of the fruit funkiness. This is an underrated IPA that I really enjoyed drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured into a pint glass... Smallish head about a finger maybe a little less. Amber translucent body... Smell is Hops galore and Apricot follows strongly. Taste is also hoppy and fruity... A nice light summer beer. A little sticky after feel... But still good. And I like the art work on the bottle this year..."
""
""
"O. I was really hoping for more apricot in the taste, additionally the body felt a bit thin. Alcohol is well hidden and the 7% can creep up on you"
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer. Copperish color with a half finger head. Really not much of a smell. The taste more of the IPA than the apricots but thats ok. Great relaxing beer for a great relaxing day or a great relaxing beer after a major stressful day. Poured this beer into my trusty pint glass as usual"

"12 ounce bottle into signature tulip glass, 2014 bottling. Pours fairly crystal clear deep orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, apricot, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Awesome aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops, apricot, and moderate malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of grapefruit, apricot, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, caramel, bread, floral, grass, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, apricot, orange peel, lemon zest, caramel, bread, floral, grass, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Very nice flavor balance of citrus hops, apricot, and moderate malt sweetness; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent fruited IPA. All around great balance and complexity of hop, apricot, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"And not that it matters but...the artwork for this beer is KILLER. By far the best beer artwork I have seen, and I have seen some good ones. It's never right to judge a beer by ""it's cover", but it's always really nice when a solid beer has an AWESOME cover. Sam Calagione, I love what you're doing, I just wish I didn't have to trek across the Mississippi to buy in ;)"

"I recently tasted this against ""Loose Cannon", ""Raging Bitch", & ""HopSlam"". Each have their place and Dogfish stood out as a great spring IPA. Great beer for kicking it on the balcony or in the backyard. I'm not typically an abstract IPA flavor person, but this sampling definitely opened my eyes."

"Taste is rich with plenty of fruity apricot and tropical notes that only serve to enhance the hoppy IPA foundation. The citrus and floral hops are prominent, but wed themselves smoothly to the fruit. It's a smooth and absolutely delicious experience, and a unique one. I am a fan and will pick this beer up again, yes."

"This beer pours almost copper it's so dark. A tan head of creamy foam sits on top and won't fall. It just won't. The nose is tart with apricot and floral with hops. The malt whispers a bit of sugar in your ear and a soft bit of bread. Taste is juicy and sweet. It's a very sweet malt that gives a wonderful medium full mouthfeel. The beer is sticky and leaves behind a bit of that apricot to linger in the aftertaste. I want to say that I also taste some orange and some orange peel. The bitter is well done in this. It's just enough to leave you with a nice IPA feeling from this decadently fruity beer."

"O: An interesting, enjoyable offering from Dogfish Head, for sure, but this lacks the qualities for a revisit. The mouthfeel was a little weak compared to some of their year-round brews and the flavors are nice, but just not exactly my cup o'tea. Might grab another pint of this next season, but I think I've had my fill of apricots for now."
""
""

"o. good to very good, will tilt to very good - can I give a 3.625?"
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O) I really enjoyed this beer. It's an excellent Spring seasonal. Definitely worth picking up."
""
""
""
"O: Awesome I love this beer so much I tried to replicate it as an extract. The IPA portion was tasty but it was ruined when I added the apricot. I need a new approach but back to the beer. I look forward to the release of this beer every year I was fortunate enough to have experienced this run with randall off the tap and it was phenomenal. Not too fruity an IPA lover wouldn't like it but not too hoppy a fruit beer lover wouldn't want it again. Quite a treat from dogfish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent mouthfeel. Fresh and clean, but still with plenty of body. Leaves you with a long lingering hoppy and fruity finish but no stickyness or excessive thickness. I would seriously consider drinking this beer regardless of taste based just on mouthfeel!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Wholeheartedly an IPA, Aprihop's apricot additions play well with the hop's tropical fruit nuances but the beer finishes out pretty earthy and malty with great overall balance!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is great. It has a richer than usual malt character, a smaller hop profile and that fruit thang. It is extremely well balanced. The aftertaste is also very nice. It is an AIPA you drink with your pinky in the air."
""
""
""
""
"O: if it weren't for the slightly overpowering opening of the apricot additions, I might go overall better than I did."

"I really like this one, best I have had in my very limited DFH experience. I really think this nails the spring season well. I do not understand why it is in 4 packs and not 6 packs but oh well that will just limit my purchasing of this beer."

"O- Its nice to have an American IPA that isn't overpowered by hops. Very good and tasty beer overall, would try again."
""
"O - I really wanted to like this one a whole lot more, but it's pretty boring and certainly not what I would call an IPA. It does go down smooth, however. The apricot for me was a bit too hidden. Not something I would seek out again."

""
""
""
"A solid little beer. Nothing about this seems cheap, and certainly not uninspired. But ultimately, I can't help but feel it could have been better (I'm thinking higher, finer carbonation would make things both feel and taste more fresh). Still, I'd keep drinking them if I could get them here! An off-centered beer if ever there was one."

"O - This is a solid IPA. The apricot is nicely balanced and dosen't dominate. Very quaffable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very particular IPA, but an excellent one, nonetheless. The apricot isn't like eating the fruit itself, but it creates a very distinct and unique flavor. Like every DFH IPA I've ever had, it's eminently drinkable, very flavorful, and very, very good. It may not be for everyone, but it is absolutely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like the smell and the taste, and I love what the apricots do, but the feel brings it down a pretty big notch. A beer like this needs carbonation! Otherwise I'd consider it outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting creation. Too malty / dark sweetness, alongside lingering apricot bitterness for me to really enjoy. It certainly needs food to relieve the mouth of its lingering drying effect. But certainly worthy of a try!"
"There's some complexity here, but not enough to garner a label of much more than ""okay"" across the board."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: good stuff. if you're looking for a bitter hop bomb, this isn't for you. i enjoy the sweeter/maltier ipa's, so this is right up my alley. it has a nice balance of juicy fruit and a mellowed bitterness that makes for a well-harmonized, refreshing beer. the addition of apricots is nicely done - not over the top, but you can taste it."

"O: This is a very pleasant IPA, one that I feel is far better and more complex than it is sometimes made out to be. I appreciate the fact that the apricot aroma and flavor does not detract from the balance of sweet malt and piney, fruity hops. A very good ale with a lot of personality and poise, I highly recommend this one to fans of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep, dark amber color with thin white head. Lot of pine and fruit in the nose. This beer drinks very smooth. The amarillo hops help pull out subtle apricot notes. Certainly only faint apricot notes. It's an interesting take on the traditional DFH IPAs and one that scores high on all points for me. Very drinkable at 7% ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured light amber color. Small foamy head with mild lacing on the side of the glass. Has a citrusy, hoppy, sweet smell. There is a hop forward, grassy taste initially. The hop bitterness continues throughout the entire drink, but you get a apricot maltiness with a sweeter taste at the end. Perfect combination of bitterness and sweet. One of my favorites for sure. I wish this was a year round beer."
"Taste starts with malt and dark fruit, with an apricot and slighty hoppy finish. Has a medium mouthfeel with high carbonation - that goes very well with the apricots."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: A respectable beer all around. The crystal malts on Aprihop are the perfect malt for the job, because they get that ""sharp"" sweetness and pretty subtle flavor overall that works well with the apricots. The taste of this beer is pretty much what I expected, even if I do find it to be a touch TOO sweet, though the mouthfeel is excellent. The apricots aren't overwhelming, and the grassy/earthy/piney hops work with it very nicely. This is a very good seasonal."

"A real winner from DFH, and my favorite IPA from them other than 75 Minute."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this is no ordinary IPA, given the fruit infusion, but it has enough complexity from the hops to cut through the fruit and make for a refreshing, tasty beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a decent seasonal IPA but nothing special. Good drinkability, the alcohol is masked well. The apricot was a bit too hidden."
""
""

"Overall: I can see where some might not enjoy this but I must say it is good. Different but I like different and well what else to expect from Dogfish Head?"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Aprihop is a very good IPA. I thought it would be much different tasting since apricots were used in the brewing process but this was not the case. It was different than your everyday IPA, but thats what I was looking for. The beer didnt disappoint. I would definately recommend letting the beer sit a few minutes before enjoying it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It’s a lovely IPA. And I do recommend it for someone trying to get into IPAs. The fruit hint and sweetness really carries this beer well, so to hide the bitterness of IPAs as well."
""
""
"Overall - Good, fairly enjoyable IPA. It's not gonna wow you on complexity, but its got nice approachability and, despite the huge apricot influence, doesn't get cloyingly sweet. Nice job, Dogfish."
""
""
""
"Overall a good beer. Definitely a nice spring beer. Seems to be a little less IPA and a little more belgian but definitely worth a try on a warm spring day."
""
""
""
""
"Oh Dogfish Head...maybe you are cursed with fans setting the bar to high. So many special beers, some of which I've loved and others not, but all were drank with an appreciation of what you were trying to accomplish. Aprihop? Its a good beer, dont' get me wrong. If someone handed it to me in a blind taste test, I'd say it was a damn fine beer. Beautiful color actually, which certainly must come from the apricots. As an IPA or as a fruit beer, however, it fell a bit short on both accounts for me. Based on how you typically do business, I'd guess you used a ton of real apricot for this brew. Unfortunately, it doesn't really come through. As an IPA, the great qualities of our other IPAs don't come through either. It's kinda both, but neither. As a whole, it is a good but undescript mash where the fruit and hops cancel each other out rather than building to something special, although there is a very nice mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a great beer for this time of year. This may be one of my favorite seasonals from DFH next to the Punkin. Check this out and enjoy the Spring!"
""
""
""
"O: This is a pretty solid fruit fusion IPA. A little predictable, but refreshing and has a great prickly mouthfeel that I appreciate and enjoy. If I drank this blind I don't think I could have been able to tell you that this was brewed with apricots, but it's still very solid. Would have liked to have drank the rest of this bottle...but alas...I only bought a single and spilled the rest of it. Bah."
""
"Overall this is a good fruity summer beer to drink when the weather is warmer. It's different but I'd highly recommend giving this one a try!"
""
""
""
"This is a great IPA. It's coloring is similar to caramel, it is dark and rich. The apricot aroma breaks though that of the hops. The flavor was overwhelming to me and I did not like it as much as other Pale Ales that I have tried. It has a long aftertaste which also to me was unappealing."
"O - A flavorful IPA with a more fruity and malty presence than what is considered standard for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really easy-going beer, certainly doesn't demand too much of your attention, nor does it challenge your pallet."
""
""
"Overall: It's been years since I last had a glass of Aprihop and decided to give this beer some respect. Good beer, is it worth drinking over and over again that's up to you. Not a lot of fruit infused IPAs out there, and what I like most is that this is less fruit more IPA. Salud!"
""
"So typically I'm anti fruit beer novelty acts but since it was a Dogfish Head I gave it a shot. Pours light brown which was a surprise to me for some reason. The smell actually hits you with hops right out of the gate then apricots appear too. Te taste is way better than I was expecting. I guess cause this really is a true craft that hits you with a nice malty hoppy taste then follows with a hint of apricot. They did not go overboard with the fruit which is the key to the success of this beer. It's a great summer refreshing beer that I'll have from time to time on some nice hot days. Very nice effort once again from Dogfish Head."
""
"O-very well balanced ipa and apricot characteristic. The characteristics are a bit muddied, but overall a very enjoyable brew"
"Great for the warmer days comin up. A definite summer time choice."
""
"Beautifully colored IPA. Dark, rich caramel hue is beautiful and very inviting. The apricots break through the hop aroma. Flavor maybe a little overwhelming for those who Indian Pale Ales are not their first or second choice for beer styles. The mouthfeel is medium, with a long lasting after taste. Overall not too strong after the whole experience is taken in. A beer that I would drink again, but only once in awhile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's not a terrible beer but I'll just stick with 60 or 90 minutes."
"O - overall this is a solid IPA, and I like how the apricot is not overpowering. It is very balanced, which is always a good thing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Obviously I didn't come in expecting a normal IPA but this just didn't do it for me. Will not drink again and at the IPA tasting I did this was the least favorite of the five."
""
""
""
"O- I really love this beer, its an IPA that stands out due to its fruitiness. It combines the two elements really well and one doesn't really overpower the other."
""
"Overall - A decent seasonal pickup that I wouldn't mind purchasing a few packs through the season's length. It's a refreshing IPA that doesn't stray far from the style and adds a little more fruit character than is typically found. This is the first year I've tried it and I will be picking it up again, probably before the release is over."

"Fairly earthy hop flavors, herbal aromas, with apricots stealing the show. Not overly bitter, with good malt support. But apricot is slightly overpowering for my liking."
""
"O- I hate to do the whole ""I remember when this beer used to be so much better"" thing, but something has changed about this over the years. I used to experience a much more aggressive bite and flavor from the hop/apricot combo. Maybe my palate has changed, I don't know. It's still a very good beer all the same, I just had a more intense experience in the past."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was expecting a little more from this, although in the past, I've been kind of let down by DFH's fruit-infused beers. Apricots must hard to pull off in beers of the ""non-sour"" variety, as many of them contain that same medicinal, chalky flavor in the finish. Surprisingly enough, that wasn't my biggest complain here. What was up with that dirty aroma? All in all, something I put down quite easily, but probably wouldn't have again."
""
""
"Want to try more to explore the ranges of flavor ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a good Spring offering from Dogfish Head. Very refreshing and easy to drink when the weather starts to warm up a bit. Adds some good fruit character without tasting artificial. Doesn't do anything amazing, but it's a sold beer. Should be easy to find if Dogfish Head is available in your area. Runs at about $9.99 per 4-pack (in this area), so the price will not set you back too much. Definitely worth a try."

"Overall: A fruit beer for hopheads. Dogfish did a wonderful job using REAL apricots(not flavorings or concentrate) that give off a strong presence of the essence of apricot in the nose, while still allowing the hops and malt shine in the flavor profile. The creamy mouthfeel is very seductive and overall the beer isn't too sweet or cloying. In my eyes, this is a must have spring beer for any hophead with a curious palate."

"O: This beer is easy to drink with the pleasant apricot notes in addition to the more traditional IPA flavors and the well hidden ABV. This is a very appropriate spring seasonal and is a refreshing drink on a very warm spring afternoon/evening while waiting to watch the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship game."
"This is very different from most IPAs. I think that is why I like it... it is always good to shake things up!"
""
""
"overall, i really like this...its like a tastier version of the 60 minute ipa in my humble opinion. i could session this, perfect for a spring afternoon."
"Overall a decent brew. Kudos to DFH for trying something different."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Middle of the road - I wish DFH really incorporated the apricots better. Tastes like a standard pine-forward IPA with a hint of fruit."

"O - I drank this out of a snifter hoping that it would concentrate the smell better than the last 3 bottles I had. I wish the apricot notes were more pronounced, but still a great hoppy ale that I'd buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It was a bit of a let down for me because I've come to expect so much from DFH. With that being said, STILL a good brew that I'll probably revisit when the season comes. I was just hoping for a bit more of the apricot to justify the name. Otherwise, a very good IPA."
"not as hoppy as its billed, but a nice fruit beer that's not an immediate write off for me. the pour is a nice brassy color with an orange tint, and a finger or two of fading white head. the nose is hoppy, but its more oily and sweet than bitter, more like a 90 minute than a 60, if you follow. the fruit doesn't manifest itself too boldly in the nose, maybe a little jammy sweetness, but in the taste they really come out. its almost like they take the place of the sweetness that usually comes from the malt, its juicy and a little tart too. then the hops kick in, robust and fresh, and give this beer a particular crispness hard to find in fruit beers. overall this leans more toward an ipa than a fruit beer, which makes it a winner for me, but its not as well refined as some of the other dogfish brews. could also stand a little more carbonation to brighten up the feel, it comes across a little heavy to me. still, an interesting and delicious beer that's just right in early spring. drink this cold though, it gets weird as it warms."
""
""
"O: Not for hop heads, Aprihop has pleasant fruit, some bitterness, and a fine bit of malt. Pretty balanced and subtle rather than in your face, it may seem too sweet for those that prefer bitter beers."
""
""
"Overall. Fine, I suppose, but I'd prefer an apricot weizen and a solid IPA over two bottles of this. Not something I'll seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: A nice fruit forward IPA from Dogfish Head, albeit very sweet. Despite that, I always looks forward to this beer every spring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Easy drinking brew worth the pocket change."
"The malt makes more of a presence in the taste providing some breadiness. Medium bitterness that pops in the beginning and hangs around for a bit. The apricot is there, but not too prevalent. Citrus, pine, and earthy hop flavors."
""
"O: Overall, good but not great. Its something Id drink again, but no where near my favorite IPA or my favorite DFH offerings."
""
""
""
"Not bad but not outstanding. With so many other great IPAs available I don't think this is one I'll be revisiting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, for me this was a great offering for an apricot ipa. Other comparable styles haven't stacked up."
"Purchased at Top Foods. Poured a copper ruby color with a pure white head. Nice potent aroma. Very hoppy and citrusy. Didn't really get the apricot but perhaps a touch. Flavor surprised me. I definately get the apricot in the flavor. The hops are kind of light and more of an aftertaste. Body is good but a bit flat. This is enjoyable but I think my expectations may have been too high."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a real good beer. The apricot flavor really isn't too noticeable when the beer is cold though, it definitely needs to warm up to get the full flavor profile. I've been drinking them at room temperature."
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: on tap (Falls Church, VA location)"
""
""
"O: I didn't expect much from this beer, I expected it to be one sided but that was not the case at all. The hops paired with the apricots quite well and was a well balanced beer for my palate. I'd definitely buy some again if not for me but something that may convert my girlfriend into craft beers."
"A respectable brew which is certainly highlighted by the apricot which is quite tasty and refreshing but I would like to see slightly more citrus hops for more of a bite to offset the tart."

"I first must comment on the well apricot nature of the brew- the color reminds me of apricots, however I suppose many IPAs do. As far as the smell is concerned, the apricots are not overbearing at all, rather the apricots and hops blend nicely for a damn good nose job. I would consider the hops to be citrusy, but more mild as compared to some other IPAs. The taste is remarkably similar to the smell, more or less perfectly balanced citrusy hop profile and a smooth apricot flavor. I would not at all consider this to be a ""fruity"" beer like some others I have tried (UFO raspberry or a blue moon orange- nasty shit)- it certainly retains its IPA qualities with citrusy hops however not too bitter on the whole (but I think the bitterness is perfect for balancing out the sweet apricot). The apricot is well incorporated and doesnt take away from the IPA qualities. The malty character did add some sweetness, but not to the point of taking away from the hops characteristics. I cant say I noticed much of a boozy taste what so ever although the ABV clocks in at 7%. On the whole the apricot is there to back up the hops not the other way around and for this reason I would certainly pick up this brew again even though I generally always prefer my IPAs in true form."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a creative approach on an American IPA. The apricot works well with the hops and although I personally am not much of an apricot fan this one is tasty."
""
""
""
"Always weird and yet I still buy it every year. I guess it's sort of interesting..."
"O: Second time having this beer, first time reviewing. Quite liked it this time around whereas the first time was a little lackluster. Really refreshing and pretty drinkable but I'm left wanting just a bit more apricot flavor. Maybe thats because the amount that I got was so damned good! 3.75"
"O: I'm a fan of this offering, the apricot lends nicely to the base IPA. A little too pricey to enjoy frequently but I'm happy to drink it whenever offered to me."
""
""
""
""
"Interesting but just feels unbalanced. The apricot is just too sweet, the hops just too bitter. Really nice independently, but together it's like a flavor disagreement in your mouth. I always want to like this more..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Very solid IPA with a sharp hop profile that bites just enough. A definite must get and I could session this brew."

"Overall, I thought this was kind of a mess. Overly bitter hops arguing with the syrupy sweetness of the apricot, and the apricot shows up very late in the profile. The taste seems almost segmented. To my taste buds, it was exactly the opposite of the description - way overly hoppy first, then apricot heavy afterwards. Think it could benefit from a less is more approach.I would not purchase this again, and can't say I would recommend it. Disappointing offering from DFH in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Enjoyable because of the apricots. The base IPA is not what I'm looking for, though."
""
"Overall, a nice spring beer from DFH but I find it a little too sweet to be real quaffable. Nonetheless it is a nice change-up from wheat beers as far as spring seasonals are concerned."

"Dogfish have gone and done the awesome yet again. Go get this beer and drink it. You don't like IPA you say? GO GET THIS BEER AND DRINK IT! Straight outta the bottle into my mouth it's smooth, slightly sweet, not bitter, not cloying, not sticky, not overly hoppy. It's sessionable yet dangerous at a 7% ABV. It's easy to drink. It's lovely, wonderful, amazing, and beautiful. Please never stop making this. It could be a flagship brew for the entire company. I want this year round. My new favorite beer."
"This is really a nice beer. I was apprehensive at first wondering if the apricot would be over powering or too sweet. I was wrong. A nice amber color. A nice smell of citrus and the pleasant smell of the apricot. A nice smooth taste. You taste the bitter hops at first, which I like, then the subtle taste of the apricot comes in to smooth it down. Really a unique and refreshing combination of flavor. I recommend this one. Especially those who still like a strong hoppy beer."

"Pours amber and a shade dark and a white mild head. Smell is citrus, floral, apricot. The taste is citrus, hops, grapefruit, the apricot is the center of the beer and its done well. Finish has sweet malts and a bit of bitterness. Smooth mouth and a good twist on the IPA."
""
"Nice color. Full of hops, although I was expecting to taste mor apricots. Hops seems to overpower the taste. Slightly tart aftertaste. Would have like to have smelled more o the apricot in its aroma. Slightly imbalanced but not too much. A pretty good choice for a spring brew."

"Serving type- 12oz bottle poured into my DFH IPA glass. Thanks for reading."
"Hmm... I gotta say right off the bat this is a dissapointment, BUT, I find it hard to blame on Dogfish Head. They try some wacky stuff, and it's simply the odds that they aren't all going to be home runs. Pours clear, medium high carbonation. Smell is pretty good, and the apricot really compliments the piney hops. If only the flavor could have matched... Taste is reminiscent of the 60 minute IPA but surprisingly small amounts of apricot flavor. Light to medium bodied. Here's how I feel about it: If your're going to do something off the norm like making an Apricot American IPA, then go for it full bore with all aspects of the beer. Dogfish Head knows how to do this and they have pulled off some bizzare combinations on multiple occasions. People are going to buying ""APRIHOP"" because they are wanting something different and unique and are expecting APRICOTS and HOPS. Don't be subtle with crazy brews."

"O - Very aromatic but, in my opinion, was missing an hoppy punch for the style. Having said that, this beer is great and well though out. Drinkability is excellent and, as for many DFH's brews, 12oz bottles look far too small! Recommended even if some hoppy heads might be disappointed."

"O - This has typical Dogfish style. Taking a certain fruit and mixing some hops calls for a good beer. The quality Dogfish have lets them pull this beer style off. Nothing too special here. Just a great brewery making a good IPA using unique fruit flavors."
""
"Reddish-brown pour is darker than expected from an apricot flavored beer. Nice quality head with decent retention. Aroma reveals definite hops offset with malt. Great balance on flavors - apricot sweetness up front and in the end to sweeten the hop flavor. Bitterness almost disappears with the apricot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Not convinced this should be classified as an IPA because the hop profile is not quite bold enough. That said, the hoppines did get stronger as I drank this baby down. Whatever you consider it, it is rather tasty."

"Mouthfeel: A little on the thick side as far as I'm concerned. Carbonation is average. The finish is a light lingering bitterness that reminds you that is in fact an IPA. The apricot addition does add a bit of a twist to an other wise ordinary beer. I usually drink a few of these as spring/summer rolls around every year. It's a nice sessionable beer and As far as I can remember, this is the first DFH beer I ever tried."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: I prefer an India Pale Ale to be dry, heavily hopped, yet possessing a complexity in its hop character that keeps my taste buds alert and excited. Too many times, I have encountered an IPA that is very one note in the hop department and there is not malt complexity to bring a unique experience into play. Aprihop is an exciting beer. Fleshy fruit notes mixed with some more traditional citrus flavors and a good malt backbone. Simple, yet enjoyable. A perfect hot weather beer."

"Big apricot flavor up front, then the hop bitterness dances around the palate = very lively, nice carbonation. Goes back and forth with sweet and bitter, finishes dry with syrupy body that is both sweet and bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a mellow, golden brown with a two finger white head. Smells of pine, citrus and light stone fruits. Tastes like a standard IPA with light, mild sweetness. Very hop forward, with a nice malt backbone. Medium bodies with decent carbonation. Overall, a decent IPA with an interesting twist."
""
"B"
"O- this is a decent brew but not my favorite. I wish fresh DFH beers were easier to find here in California. It was hard to review this beer without a bottled on date. I am also not used to a malt heavy ipa and prefer a little malt like most West coast IPA's"
"O: A fresh hit of fruit really kept this beer fresh and interesting; it’s not usually a complicated style, but it’s nice to get this kind of balancing flavor. If I had access to this, I’d definitely buy it again."
"O: A great IPA I would buy anyday again. The apricots does a really good job in this one."
"I poured this one into a pint glass. It has a nice dark golden color body with a nice 2 finger white head. The smell is very aromatic of hops. The taste is very hop up front and i get the balance of the malts on the back of the tongue. I'm not picking up any apricot taste. The mouth feel is great and overall this is a really good ipa, which i love."

"O - Not impressed. I'd choose a lot of regular or even BMC fruit beers over this."

""
"Overall, I liked this, but it is still more IPA than Apricot brew."
"A pleasant surprise and definitely a beer I'd highly recommend."
"A ruby amber with a large lasting creamy beige head on the pour with very good head retention lacing to the end. Aroma of caramel malt, yeast, fruity esters, apricots with citrus floral hops. Taste is caramel malt, yeast, fruity notes and some nice apricots flavor with some citrus floral hops. Palate is a medium body, creamy mouth feel with good carbonation. Finishes with caramel malt, some yeast, fruity and some good apricot notes followed by some citrus and floral hops for balance. Aroma and flavor of apricots come through more as it warms up, has a good malty background. Overall a very good, tasty and well balanced brew, I would recommend this and drink again, very nice."

"12 oz bottle from Samp01. Pours reddish amber with a short- lived white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of citrus hops followed by caramel malt and some fruit. Body is medium and crisp. A lot of citrusy hops, caramel and ripe fruit combine on the palate. The finish is long, dry, and grapefruity. Delicious IPA, it was perfect with Moroccan stew."

"Pours a darker golden amber with a fluffy three finger clean white head with beautiful lacing. The smell of grassy hops and apricot on the nose. Opens with some grassy hops transitions to lightly sweet malt then apricots and a touch of pine and bitterness that is quickly balanced by slightly sweet malt. The mouthfeel of this beer is remarkable. Creamy, smooth, and refreshing. Aprihop is exceptionally balanced, never too sweet, never too bitter, just the right amount of apricot flavor, and exceptional mouthfeel. Highly recommended!"

"O- This was another quality IPA from DFH. Although not my favorite offering from DFH, Aprihop was still definitely an interesting beer. The balance between the apricots and bitterness of the IPA definitely made for an unique and great tasting beer. Definitely not the best IPA I've had, I usually like them a little bit sweeter but it was definitely an enjoyable beer. Recommended to at least try."
"I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would; sweet an hoppy, with a very fresh look, smell and taste, this is a brew that it totally worth a try."
""
""
"It's definitely worth a try if you like IPA's and a refreshing snap of apricots. Cheers!"
"A beer that goes down easy but still packs the flavor to keep you coming back for more. There are beers that overdue fruit and some that play it reserved, so much so that it makes searching for it a chore. This finds a nice balance between the two."

""
"Refreshing and unique. I would love to drink this again."
"This beer is very good..don't let the other reviews guide you elsewhere. The one and only problem with this beer is that it is not much different than a typical IPA. I expected a cross between Magic Hat #9 and Dogfish 60minute but what I came across was just a heavier version of the 60minute...maybe something in between the 60 and the 90minute. Either way it is an excellent beer...just don't expect something new and mind-blowing, rather just a very good IPA."

"Overall - Another well crafted and better than most of the competition beer from DFH. Enjoy."

"O - Overall this is a fantastic fruit IPA. I will definitely purchase this one again. Cheers Dogfish Head!"
""
""
"A good enjoyable IPA, very good in fact, and I would definitely have this again. That said, I can't help but feel like the apricot is underused. I would have liked to see more evidence of it in the taste and nose. Otherwise, this is just a very good IPA, but there are other very good IPAs."
""
""
"O- The more I sample, the more I enjoy this brew. Highly drinkable and full of flavor. Like 75 Minute IPA, I would welcome Aprihop as a year-round offering."
"O - Really enjoyed this beer. Would definitely buy or order again. Hopefully I can get down to the brewery to see what this stuff tastes like fresh & on tap. I'm wishing right now I had a burger to pair it with as I keep sipping!"

"Two finger head with good retention on a clear nice amber body. Little lacing. Aroma is fairly hoppy with mostly orange peel. Apricot is tough to draw out. Flavor is fairly complex with a nice malt profile and mix of hops including musty, grapefruit and floral notes. Again the apricot is tough to draw out. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall a good beer but the apricot was well hidden from my senses."
"Im a big fan of DFH and this one doesnt disappoint. Would have probably passed on once I saw apricot if it was from any other brewery. Would buy again..."
""
""
"Overall a very good beer with some fruit notes but it doesn't take over."
"This is a decent beer. It's a very nicely balanced take on a fruit beer and an IPA. It has just enough of both to keep fans of both styles happy. I also appreciate how DFH doesn't go with a lighter, wheat-based beer for the spring. It's unique and intriguing. It's worth trying."

"i was skeptical of the aprihop. mixing fruit and ipa isn't my favorite concept, but dogfish is known for this style. aprihop turned out ok - very subtle hints of the apricot with a nice balance. poured a dark amber/orange color with an off white head that left considerable lacing. i noticed some fruitiness but it was well tempered by citrus and earthy hop qualities. down the hatch you do taste some stone fruit, but not in a sweet, cloying way. less apricot-like than magic hat no. 9. don't notice the 7% at all. i'd rather drink the 90 or 60 minute, but the aprihop is a worthy beverage for at least one pint."
"Sampled from a sniffer."
""
"I tried this beer a few years ago for the first time and remember thinking that this wasn't extreme enough for me or something along those lines. Since then, I think my palate has turned to more balanced brews with a healthy dose of hops. This one just seems to hit the spot for me, and I'm glad I gave it another shot because I'm definitely going to buy some more before the season is over."
""
"Overall I though that this was an ok beer and a slightly above average American IPA. It had all the aspects of a American IPA, but it didn't have that extra wow factor to make it live up it's name as Aprihop. This beer had ok drinkability, it went down very smooth, but I think the thickness would start to get to me after one or two, but it seems like a glass of this would be nice on a hot day. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both good and were the highlights of this beer. What I liked least about this beer was the body and that all those great things that I liked about the aroma were pretty toned down when it got to the taste, if it was a little lighter and had a more assertive apricot taste this would bee a great beer. I don't think I would buy this again mainly because it is pretty expensive for what you get, but I still recommend giving it a try to an IPA fan. In the end if that taste matched the aroma, was lighter bodied, and had more apricot flavor it would be a pretty good beer, but as it stands now it's just slightly above average, I guess I was expecting to get more assertive flavors that can be found in most other Dogfish Head beers, a descent beer, but it failed to really impress me, not every beer can be a work of art."

"O- This is a good IPA, I have never been too impressed with 60 and 90 minute but this beer lands in the middle, and with a better flavor."

"This beer had so many rave reviews that maybe my hopes got a little too high. I was expecting to be blown away by this beer, and it turned out to be just alright. Nice bitter hop taste, but I don't know if it's the apricot or what, but something kinda throws the taste of this IPA off a bit. I was expecting just a hint of citrus sweetness, but turned out to be a bit of a funk instead. For me at least."
"o: Being a fruit IPA I had low expectations going in, but DFH did well here. Apricot presence is well balanced - not overdone nor underdone. I don't think I'd drink more of a 4 pack of this however as it might start to wear a bit. It's definitely worth trying. Good choice for a spring seasonal."

"Drinkability/overall- this was decently good ipa but i did feel that the overall flavor was somewhat of disappointment from the nose in terms the fruit is not even noticeable in the beer, in terms of just being a nice ipa this is decent but in terms being called a apricot ipa fell a little flat"
"O - a very refreshing ipa with a well balanced flavor, and a generous abv% - wish this was a year round brew, would take this over 90 any day"
""
""
""
""
"O- Great sipping beer for the spring. A great IPA that is not overwhelmed by the fruit presence."
"O - Another great beer from DFH. Adding fruit to beer isn't always a good thing, but they have successfully kept this beer an IPA at its heart and used the apricot as a compliment. The complex blend of tropical fruits, citrus, and bitter flowery hops work well. The only negative I could find is that the malt may make it a bit chewy and give it a slightly bready character. However, it is one of my favorite DFH beers and I look forward to it appearing on the shelves each March. I wish this was around through the summer because it is a great warm weather beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Tasty, but not of typical DFH caliber IPA. Seems like it would appeal more to a non-IPA drinker than a hoplover."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, orange-copper coloring with a slight filmy covering on the surface. Aromas are light and subtle, with a strong balance of wet hops and spices along with the fruit sweetness. Flavors are smooth to start, with a transition towards a sharper feel from the carbonation and light body. Subtle apricot sweetness builds the backbone to support the green, wet, spicy hops character. The spicing of pepper and basil clean the palate for a short-lived, mildly sweet aftertaste. Clean finish, allowing the tastebuds to recover in between sips. Very easy to drink, and the lighter flavorings would make for a good summer beer."
""
""
""
"M- Luscious. Not at all watery- the malts work well to move the hops around. A nice small sticky leave, with apricot in the aftertaste."
"It leaves a slightly metallic feeling, with the some dry grains in there somewhere. The hops are nowhere near what I expected, but its still very drinkable. The level of fruit flavor reminds me a bit of Festina Peche (in the background but still noticeable). As a matter of fact, this makes me want a Festina Peche!"
""
""
""
"O-a nice blend of anIPA and a fruit beer. A nice change of pace, but not something I would drink on a regular basis"

"Not only as good an IPA as you'll find, just about as good a beer you'll find. I bought a sixer, and now I wish I'd bought several."
"Stellar brew as a fruit beer and an ipa. Another winner from dogfish."
"O- Not too many fruit IPAs. I think this is a pretty solid attempt. Seek it out."

"O: Great execution. The apricot is more assertive in the aroma than in the flavor, but it's well-done and tasty in both. Very nice."
"O - Overall, I find its VERY hard to find a good stone fruit based beer, that isnt a sour. As it warms the apricot comes out a bit more. Its not that bad of an IPA, could use a bit more apricot though."
""
"Pours orange amber, clear with frothy head. Smells a bit funky, must be the apricot, with light pine bitterness. Tastes like a mediocre ipa, pine bitter, funky aftertaste. The apricot comes out a bit but makes it taste stale. Medium mouthfeel, slightly dry, with high carbonation. Was disappointed, though not a terrible beer. Will stick to DFH's other ipas."
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a lovely red-orange amber with ruby tones. Half finger white head that dissipates slowly to a solid film. Great apricot aroma that almost masks a light malt and hop component. Very unusual flavor, starts with apricot and fruit, sweet malt and mild hops and then transitions into an intense citrus flavor of grapefruit and orange with and herbal hop finish. A grapefruit sourness in the finish. An unusual and pleasant flavor progression. Mouth feel is mediium with a bit of creaminess like a high quality apricot juice. Another unusual Dogfish Head experiment that worked out quite nicely."
"M: It's kinda creamy, light, drinkable, and freshing. Has a linger."

"O- I was impressed with this one, more flavor and higher alcohol added together for a refreshingly fruity beer, two things that usually don't go together."

"PS - If you want full idea of the mood, pint glass was a Goose Island 'Brewpub' pint and the tune jamming at the moment was Pearl Jam, 'Nothingman'."

"O:One of my favorite seasonal beers."
""
"O - A good beer but not as much flavor as I remember. The last bottle I had was around September and it definitely had more apricot flavor going on. I may sit on a bottle to see it the hops fade back and leave more apricot."
""
"o: best DFH seasonal (sorry Festina Peche I love you too!) my only gripe is that it doesn't come in six packs!"
"A great spring seasonal. Something that Dogfish Head does legit, for sure. An experiment gone right. Don't even think of drinking it if it's not fresh, however. This fruit IPA comes with a short ticker. Beat the clock. Have an Aprihop, and soon! Recommended."

"It is wonderful, and I am not a hop head. I wish this beer where available throughout the warmer months."

""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass, bottled in 2012. This pours a brownish color with a decent off white head which leaves a lacing. The smells are of hops, caramel and apricots. The feel is medium plus. The taste is most of bitter hops, some caramel and apricot is present on the tongue. Good beer."
""
""
""
"O: Though apricot isn't that great to me, DFH really pulled it off with this beer. It is easy to drink and great for a war spring day."

"This beer completely lacks any body at all and comes across as a malt beverage with apricot flavor. (The apricot flavor isn't even that good, to tart and ""lonely"". The fruit characteristic doesn't come across as integrated into the beer but rather added.#9 had a great marriage of beer and fruit before they changed the recipe."
""

"It appeared yellow-orange in color, with a small white head. It smelled of aromatic hops and obviously apricots. It tasted of flavor hops, residual sugar, some aromatic apricots on the finish. Mouthfeel is a light to medium bodied beer, very spring like. Overall it tasted like a 90 minute ipa with an apricot."

"O: Very good IPA from DFH. Nice use of featured ingredient, not overshadowing the fact that the beer is an IPA. Hops do a good job of countering some of the sweetness and tartness from the apricot. I would drink this beer again."

"I'm so glad I aged this beer. Way better this time around, due to my apprehension toward beers where hop is king. A great learning experience, and a whole new world of aged IPAs I want to explore!"
"GOOD STUFF, WORTH TRYING!"
"D - Drinks like a maltier-than-normal IPA. I don't get the apricots--they must be indistinguishable from the hops to me. A good beer, but not my favorite from DFH."
"O: Great bear overall with a unique take on the apricot flavor. The tangy citric flavors of the hops accent the sweetness of the apricot and make for a very easy drinking, yet flavorful, brew! Will definitely by again when next spring rolls around."
"The feel of this beer is a medium bodied spring seasoned beer. It has some mellow push to it and is quite inviting. It goes down smooth and is refreshing but flavorful as well."
"O: I generally don't like fruit beers, but this is exceptional. Strong offering from Dogfish Head. Highly recommended, will drink again."
"O: Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. Just as the reviews say, it has such nice layers of flavors throughout. When it was fresh I recalled it being a bit on the hoppy side. Now that the hoppiness has weakened, it's incredibly well balanced and really makes for a pleasurable drink. Bottle drank was from 04/2011."
"O- taste is very drinkable but has high alcohol for me to be a session. a 4 pack is a nice split for 2 people :) also this beer is great cold but to me even better warm so if you like to nurse a drink it can handle some warming."
"Overall, I do like this beer. :)"
"Overall: Good carbonation and flavor profile, but a bit too hoppy for my tastes."
"For me, then, this is a rare miss from the brewery--in fact, the first of their brews I've ever had that I probably won't purchase again."
"Pours a rusty/copper color with little head to it and a little lacing. Scent is strong in bitter hops and apricots. Taste is bold and hits the taste buds with a punch. Bitter hops are the most noticeable taste. There is also a certain sweetness from the apricot that helps balance the bitterness. Has a nice after taste and texture to it. The volume to the beer is definitely one of its best attributes. A great find on vacation since Dogfish Head pulled out of the state of Wisconsin in early 2011."
"The CPJ"
"What an awesome beer. Most apricot inspired beers I've had have either been wheat beers, or ales. This is the first apricot IPA I've had, and it's a winner through and through. The apricot doesn't dominate the scene here, and that's refreshing for a fruit inspired beer. The apricot has a fabulous smell, then disappears until after you've swallowed...allowing the hops to make their presence known. I wish this was available year round. I only bought a case, and now I won't be able to have more for almost a year. :( Can't wait until next spring."
"I have always hated Magic Hat #9. I think it's gross so I was worried I wouldn't like Aprihop. While I don't absolutely love this beer, it's a huge step up from #9. The rich creaminess and high quality is exactly what you'd expect from Dogfish Head, but the style/flavor isn't my favorite. I recommend you try for yourself."
"Taste is like a 90-minute mixed with just enough apricots to shine through. The fruit taste didn't reveal itself until the beer was swallowed and once the beer warmed. The bitterness was just enough as it was not too bitter to kill the fruit taste. Very refreshing and I could definitely see myself buying this in 6 packs if it were available in Louisiana. Refreshing summer beer."
"Cheers"
"O: Nice fruity IPA. The apricot is not as strong as I thought it was going to be."
"The brew pours a slightly ruddy orange-amber hue, and is capped by a filmy white wisp. The nose shows very little fruit, which is not a bad thing; it does not seem adulterated. The hop bouquet is instead tropically fruity with light cannabis notes atop a slightly sweet malt. The flavor reinforces the suggestions of the nose. Initial impressions are of light sugar cookie malt, fruity dank cannabis, and a slight spiciness, and it really doesn't show apricot until the very finish. The feel is light-bodied, refreshing and hides a fairly high ABV. Very good stuff, overall."
"Would buy again...neat IPA...just a little different...which is a good thing."
"Flavor of this brew gets better as the beer warms and the fruit characteristics begin to shine through. Despite being an IPA it really highlights the novelty ingredient above the hops. Malt gives everything a touch of sweetness and warmth. Good brew if you like the novelty ingredient and worth picking up a sixer in the spring."
"O- Pretty much a malt bomb. I was hoping for more hops and more apricot to provide a refreshing crisp brew. Perhaps hops have faded, don't know what the date code stands for, (6A- June?). The smell is more on point, as well as the body feel would have been a great canvas to showcase some fruity hops and apricot. Barely holds onto being an IPA. Easy to drink."
"I'd say this is a nice, but rather forgettable beer. On the first sip it simply tastes like a standard Dogfish IPA (perhaps less creamy than a 60 minute). The hoppy flavor is neither over- nor under-whelming. It's a bit stronger than a 60 minutes, a bit weaker than a 90 minute. The Apricot flavor doesn't really shine through until the after taste (though my bottle was a bit warm when I drank it). This final apricot-y flavor does give the beer a bit more personality (in a good way) than your average IPA, but like I said, it's not anything ground breaking. It's worth picking up simply because Dogfish always has something interesting to offer."
"This beer pours a nice clear orange color with a trace of white foamy head that doesn't lace or have very good retention. The aroma is sweet of apricot and also of citrusy hops. The taste is very sweet and kind of sour, with a citrusy hop bitter finish. The mouthfeel is a little overcarbonated, but overall it is a unique beer."
"The best part of this brew is the way the apricot transitions to the hops. Very nicely balanced. I would rec best served cold as a thirst quencher."
"O-really good, a great warm-weather treat...."
"O - A great single IPA. Any time I have it I think of summer, and that is never a bad thing."
"O: I was pretty hesitant to try this, however I'm glad I did. This was a very interesting balancing act of flavor as apricot and hop flavor mingle in a subtle way. This was an extremely enjoyable beer."
"O - Overall it is hotter than expected at 7% ABV."
"Overall: would prefer a bit more apricot in the flavor but overall this beer is a great spring/summer beer as it's refreshing and clean. nothing overpowers this beer and they all meld together nicely."
"Cheers !"
"D-Overall i loved this brew. It had a perfect balance. Can't believe this beer doesn't get more hype. Will order this anytime i see it. Loved it"
"I have liked this beer for a long time but haven't tasted recently. Seems sharper and harsher than I remember. Still it's an interesting standby and a style more good brewers should try (New Belgium take note)."
"Overall I am real happy with this beer. Having always been a fan of #9, this ""beefed up"" version is right up my ally and always welcome within the confines of my fridge. All I can say is that I hope DFH brings it back next year."
"Overall, this was an enjoyable beer. I'm not sure that I would get a whole liter of it again. But, it is enjoyable by the pint."
"The beer is aggressively hoppy like a good IPA should be, but the finish is smoother and fruitier for my money. Nicely carbonated, and it's good; very good. Recommended."
"A nice dose of apricot and malt sweetness come through, balanced with hop bitterness. Excellent mouthfeel, fantastic for a 7%. Your ideal apricot IPA!"
"D – Pretty drinkable brew, not overly sweet so this to me is pretty easy to have more than one of. A little rubbing alcohol aftertaste but doesn’t last too long. I still recommend trying the brew"
"Sampled from a bottle, with a 2011 ""bottled on"" date. Deep orange copper in color with a reddish hue. Poured with a light foamy head that reduced quickly to a wispy off-white cap. Tropical citrus and floral hop aromas with an underlying caramel maltiness beneath. The apricot aromas stand out toward the end. On the thicker side of medium bodied. A bit oily and viscous at the front end, assertive carbonation through the middle, and a resinous feel at the finish. Tropical citrus hop flavors up front that lead to floral notes thru the middle and lighlty bitter hop finish. Nice sweet malty flavor beneath fromm beginning to end. I was skeptical of a beer made with apricots, but this was awesome."
"Cheers!"
"This bottle says it was bottled in 2011. Don’t know which month, but I wonder if the hops faded a bit. I just expect all IPAs from DFH to be hop forward, and this had a prominent malt profile. The thing is, although it was more malt forward than I expected, I really enjoyed it and recommend it. It’s like a better version of Magic Hat #9."
"Overall: I would expect nothing less than weirdness from this brewery, but this is a great beer. It would be too easy to dismiss it as merely a ""fruit beer," but this definitely shows itself as an IPA with a big twist to it. Glad that I got to have this brew; its weirdness will hold a place in my heart."
"O - ok this bottle has a few months on it, and when i had it fresh i thought to myself this is one of the worst beers i've had but it isn't, ill save that for John John Dead Guy Ale. Anyway the reason this beer is not that great is its lack in complexity, although the scope is outside the box the execution is rather simple and unsatisfactory. Not sure when ill have the remaining bottle"
"The beer pours a dark orange color with a white head. The aroma is full of apricots, bready malt and some catty hops. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of bitter apricots with some grass and bready malt. A very hoppy, apricot-heavy fruit beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice and a beer I look forward too each year."
"This is one crazy ass IPA. Poured a deep orange-hued brown. Big frothy head sits on top and slowly recedes to a thin film that sticks all the way down. The smell is a strong hop aroma, very dominant. Cascade is the dominant hop in the flavor with other pine-y and citrus flavors blended in. It's got a dry malt taste, like something English, but balances the hops nonetheless. The apricot is a small note on the palate and nasal passage after the beer has gone down, and is very subtle. A great bodied beer with a little booziness mingled in there for good measure. Great beer, particularly refreshing to have one bedside after sex."
"Overall: Wow. This beer is fantastic. Dogifsh Head once again proves that it can make experimental and ""off-centered"" beers that are also accessible and delicious. Major kudos to them for this one!"
"Pours a transparent dark orange, almost a light amber hue. The one finger head slowly dissipates to a ring in my glass with a patch of film in the middle shaped like Antarctica. Smell Izmir apricots, it's a nice light citrus smell, not overpowering, but enticing. Taste starts with a slight bitterness them you get the apricot and citrus sweetness, toasted the ending there are some subtle malts present, they are the unsung heroes of this beer, then before the palate clears there is a residual bitterness. As this beer warms the apricots become more present in the taste. The mouthfeel is great for a citrus IPA, the carbonation is visible and I can feel a slight presence on my tongue as I drink this. As somebody who appreciates west coast citrus hop bombs, I really appreciate this beer. It has a cool balance between hops and subtle malt. The apricot flavor also adds some citrus flavor. If this were more readily available and cheaper here on the west coast, I'd buy this quite often."
"When I opened this bottle, I was expecting a sweet hopped up beer. What I got was an IPA that had the tart elements of an apricot. It wasn't bad, Just not what I expected. For me, if I want an IPA, I'll have an IPA. If I want something sweeter, I'll grab something sweeter. This one just doesn't really have a place for me. I'll gladly drink my remaining 3, but won't be clamoring to obtain more."
"O - This beer didn't quite meet my expectations. It is certainly an IPA and as far as IPAs go, its a good one. However, I was expecting more of an apricot fruity flavor based on the name. Instead, this beer just comes off as a heavily hopped IPA with nothing that really sets it apart. I would have again as an IPA, but not as a fruit beer."
"Cheers!"
"An early spring seasonal. A tremendous blast of fruity flavor that wasn't disgusting, and still unmistakably a beer. I think they have mellowed out on the obvious apricot taste in recent batches. Pours a slightly hazy copper with a thin head that sticks around for a while. Sweet fruit and citrus hops in the aroma. Bitter hops up front in the taste, followed by a distinct blast of apricot. Medium mouthfeel. Crisp and drinkable."
"O: Pretty good, edited because it was too cold at first masking some flavors."
"overall this is not a world class beer IPA. however it is super drinkable, very tasty, and perfect for spring - in fact i'd go a step further and say it would be just the brew for a warm summer evening."
"D/O: Very crisp and drinkable with a good carbonation. Very much a beer you can enjoy with dinner that really accentuates the meal while adding some fruity sweetness to the mix."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about it was how fresh the aroma was, and how we didn’t get gypped on the promised apricot in the flavoring. The blend of hops in the nose, with floral and citric singing nicely together gets you quite excited for the taste, but once you lay into it, the flavors (other than the apricot) are a bit of a letdown. Don’t get us wrong, this is a tasty beer, but it just didn’t have the punch that was expected from such a consistent brewery."
"O- Great seasonal beer from DFH. This is a good one to have when the weather starts to warm up. Definitely a thirst quencher. The 7% ABV could sneak up on you if you're not careful. I guess that's why it comes in a 4 pack!"
"O - this is a really good beer. IPAs seem to be quite overdone here lately since everybody is trying their hand at them, but this is a great offering from the guys at dogfish that doesn't disappoint. definitely worth a try."
"D - could have mutliples but I think the apricots would wear on me."
"Overall, this beer is okay but the apricots just take up too much of the frequency spectrum for me. It would have been better with a little more citric bitterness as a compliment. Not a bad beer, but probably not one I'll look into very often."
"Overall. Nice spring beer that isn't all wheaty and too fruity. Enjoyed, but that funny smell threw me off a bit."
"Pretty much average for me. Nothing really stands out besides the soapy/oily character. I can't say it is an IPA, and I can't say it is a fruit beer because nothing wants to stand out. Overall, decent. Nothing more or less."
"O - This was my first time trying ApriHop and I found it to be decent...the apricots aren't overpowering but how could they muscle up against all the hops...this was a good IPA with little fruit, and a sweet finish"
"Its taste caught me off guard, I was worried it would be too much fruit but it definitely was not. This is a good IPA with a layer of apricot on the back end, but it never overpowers. Good solid hop citrus flavors in this IPA. No complaints."
"Overall - This is quickly becoming a favorite IPA. I didn't know what to expect but I'm glad that I had it today. I'll definitely be picking up more of this before it's gone for the season!"
"*Paired with our favorite Chinese take-out"
"Overall I enjoyed the beer, though it's not one I have to have every spring. I'm planning to enjoy the rest of the 4 pack with friends and family over Easter brunch, and am looking forward to taking it more slowly then."
"622"
"O - Overall this is a great spring beer that you can count on because it stays true to its name. It is pretty much a better #9...especially for the hopheads out there! With a fruit beer you don't really want too much at a time, so the 4-pk is perfect."
"O: I was excited to try this beer because I hadn't heard of it and it sounded great. It was good, but I think the apricots and overpowered the hops enough that they seemed like an afterthought, it is an IPA afterall. Definately enjoyable, and worth a try, but I wont be getting it again at the price I paid."
"A very nice , very drinkable beer, great for the season."
"- Overall this beer just simply is not that good. I actually haven't yet had a beer from Dogfish Head that has blown me away, or is even really that great. Sad I know.. but talk about a way over hyped brewer."
"Not the worst thing I've ever had but I would hesitate to call it 'good'. The apricot takeover does subside a bit with warmth, but this beer feels weak and messy, especially in the hop department."
"D- 4 I could definitely enjoy a few of these in a sitting. It is clean and refreshing and has just enough of the apricot present to make it the twist of an IPA that it is. I wish it were a little stronger in that regard, but it is tasty anyway. This is worth a shot if you can get it in season and enjoy IPAs in general."
"Looks like a typical IPA. Also, doesn't feel like anything special in the mouth. Has a good smell though-of a nice strong IPA. The apricots add a little more sourness to the taste as it mixes with the standard grape fruit taste that I get from most IPAs. A decent amount of hops come through as well to give it a nice bitterness. I actually really like this offering from Dogfish Head."
"Aprihop pours a surprisingly dark amber, as dark if not darker than any other IPA I've ever had. The slightly off white head comes right to the top of the glass, passing three fingers in height. Head retention is above average, and gobs of lacing are left around the glass. The nose is a bit more citrus centric than the 90 Minute IPA I had last night, but pine is still present as well. There's also a little bit of caramel sweetness present, and just a touch of apricot. The aroma is a bit weak though. Aprihop's flavor just doesn't quite pass muster. The caramel malt flourish upfront is way too pronounced, and after a brief cutting bitterness an entirely too tame citrus and apricot finish. Not nearly enough hop flavor to justify calling it an IPA. This may in part be due to an entirely lackluster carbonation. The bubbles just seem to die halfway through each sip, before they can help bring out the hops. As a result the body comes across as way too heavy, and everything here's just out of whack for an IPA. I probably enjoyed Aprihop a little bit more than the score indicates as just a beer, but for being billed as an IPA with apricot it just falls short."
"Poured a dark amber almost brown color with a small amount of head and fairly good lacing on it. Smell is sweet from the apricots, not a ton of hop smell coming through. Taste is good, well balanced. Can taste the malt and sweetness throughout with a light bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel is pretty light and the beer went down nice and smooth. Overall a pretty good beer. It's nice that it's a little different than your typical IPA but not sure if it's worth the price."
"overall this is a great spin on their ipa....love it!"
"Overall - interesting idea, but in the end I don't think yielded anything more interesting to taste than any other IPA. Not bad tasting though. Good brew in general."
"O- I'm not sure what it is about this that leaves me wanting something slightly different, I think the after taste is much more mellow than the hoppiness up front."
"O I really like this IPA. Though it is not as good as the 90min IPA it is still a favorite. I have been drinking as much of this as I can get my hands on while I can. As it is a seasonal release it won't be around all that long. If you haven't tried it give it a whirl its a unique experience."
"I give a Schlitz about this odd but enticing IPA, once anyway."
"Notes: This beer is not what it used to be. Past batches have been more hop forward and IPA-like. This seems more like a hoppy amber ale with apricots. There is a big malt presence here that forces the hops into submission. Decent, but past iterations have been much better."
"O - A solid offering from DFH, something different for the spring, and not as fruit forward as I would have thought."
"Overall this was interesting, but not earthshaking experience. In comparison to something like Punkin it’s much more subtle; don’t expect an apricot blow-out!"
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium light and the fish is full. This a good beer that has lost of flavor and very well balanced."
"D - Good drink and great for the summer time; I dig it and would recommend to others who like a nice fruit based IPA"
"O=Great IPA overall and the apricot adds a distinctive flair to the beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of apricots and hops. Taste is good, hops are present up front, a good bit of apricot without being sweet. Very flavorful throughout. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer worth seeking out."
"Overall I like this beer,Nicely balenced IPA when you kind of get tired from the extreme hop bombs.Should give this a try."
"O - A interesting take on an IPA and a solid spring seasonal. The one four pack I picked up this year will probably be good enough for me but I will be buying another one next year for sure."
"I'd give the 2010 version of Aprihop much higher scores."
"D: An interesting IPA with the addition of the apricots. Overall a decent IPA, but nothing I would sit down and have 2 or 3 of."
"(On draught at papago scottsdale). Pours a deep amber color with off-white head. Lots of carbonation. Aroma is apricot, some citrus and bread. Taste is sweet malt backbone accentuated by subtle apricot, but nothing is overdone. Medium bodied with slick texture. Alcohol is well hidden in this."
"O: The apricot flavor of this beer is pretty sweet, but is thankfully not overpowering. It has a fine IPA as a backbone."
"This seasonal from Dogfish pours a really nice dark brown with two fingers of head, nice retention, and sticky lacing. I was expecting something overly peachy and fruity, but this beer is so much better. There is some mild apricot on the nose, mixed with hops. The taste is a very smooth IPA, with a great balance of bitterness, citrus hops, and a mild apricot aftertaste. I am picking up a little more apricot flavor as it warms, but the bitter bite and good carbonation are keeping this from being a sweet, syrupy beer. I had no problem blowing through this beer and could have another. It is medium bodied and fairly refreshing."
"O: Overall I would say that it's a bit below average. It seems to be unbalanced in favor of hops (even for an IPA) and the alcohol flavor needs to be under control. I've had other standard IPAs that are better, and really the apricot doesn't stand out as much as I'd expect. I give it a 2.5 here because it's not as good as the average IPA (even from DFH) but it's better than a 2.0. I wouldn't drink it again given the opportunity."
"Overall: a very nice offering, being neither to fruity nor too hopped. At 7% you'll warm quickly but not lack stamina for another. I deem it an excellent back-porch-BBQ candidate when the weather complies."
"Taste included a Apricot and hops....WOW WHAT A SURPRISE!!!! The mouthfeel was ok...would go crazy on this....as the beer warmed the flavor became more sour. Absolutely worth a try!!!"
"If you want a SUPER apricot flavored beer, then look elsewhere."
"Overall: This beer is good but not great. I would like a bit more hoppy bitterness to balance out the sweetness."
"D: This is a nice refreshing springtime sort of IPA. The hops and the sweetness work together quite well. A good seasonal offering from DFH."
"DFH ApriHop looks great in the glass. It has an orange colour and a good 5 mm head that lasts for quite awhile. The smell is fresh and hoppy with a hint of sweet apricot. The flavour starts with a bang of hops and tangy apricot and fades to a smooth aftertaste. Delicous, if not overly complex. The texture is foamy and reasonably thick. Overall, a delicious fruit IPA."
"O: I can't complain, but nothing earth shattering. I do like that the fruit component is actually noticeable while still maintaining its underlying IPA characteristics. Many similar beers I've had recently have the additional component completely buried."
"o - Wanted to tick so I did. Didnt blow me away but maybe I needed it fresh at the brewery."
"O-I'm very suprised how good this beer is. The balance is outstanding with the apricot and hop flavor and malt. If dogfish weren't leaving Wisconsin I'd plan to drink this beer every spring."
"o - glad i tried it, but not gonna go crazy for it."
"ApriHop is an enjoyable Spring seasonal with a twist. A four pack split between two people is a great way to spend a Spring afternoon, maybe even on a picnic. It's not nearly session-able as it's kind of heavy on the palate."
"O - A big, bitter, gorgeous looking IPA with a great aroma. The IBU's are a bit harsh, but if that's your bag then you'll absolutely love this beer."
"o: Overall this is a standard IPA. With the apricots buried under lupulin, it's pleasing, but not stand out."
"Overall, a very good beer, and certainly unique in the combination of fruit and an IPA. This would make a good summer beer if it were still around in the summer."
"From a bottle this brew isn't as good as it is from the tap. Got a sample of this at the brewery last summer and it was far better than what the bottle had offered. This is most definitely an IPA from the great hoppy aroma it gives off. The flavors it gives off are quite good too, Big time hops mixed with a wonderful hint of Apricot. It's a really nice combo here. The bitterness of the hops go really well with the slight tartness of the Apricots. Also the Sweetness in the beer compliments the sweetness of the fruit. I feel that this beer is really nice when on tap. The really good flavors it has kind of disappear once it's bottled. Not sure why, but if you see it on tap, try it!"
"Serving type: 16 ounce Pint on draft"
"O--I like this IPA. I think opinions will be divided on it, though. For those who prefer dry, earthy, pine-tasting IPAs, you should probably avoid this one. But if you enjoy citrusy IPAs, definitely give this one a chance."
"Overall: While not my favorite, I do seek this out every year and will continue to. It is good if you are looking to change things up from the normal routine. Certainly can be seen as an amazing gateway IPA as the fruit flavor lets you get the malt flavors and some light hops while the apricot takes away some of what can be seen as harshness."
"In my opinion, this beer is absolutely delicious. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in balance and bold flavor. I highly recommend this one."
"The name sums up the smell of this beer a strong apricot and hops. Taste is lacking, you can taste the hops and apricot like you would expect but they are not outstanding or explosive. Mouthfeel was clean and smooth. Overall i do not regret buying a 4 pack and i will drink them all but i will not buy again. This is the first Dogfish that i did not really care for."
"O- awesome IPA with a light apricot flavor that makes it an individual"
"Overall I'm somewhat mixed on this beer. Looks great, smells great, but the taste is somewhat average. Would like more apricot in this"
"Overall - A very enjoyable beer, but with only 4pks I'd reach for the 90min. That being said its a great switch for the introduction of spring and the upcomming summer beers. I would encourage everyone to give it a try. Very well done!"
"Overall- Throw the style out the window on this one. It doesn't have the bitterness of your typical IPA, but the apricot is very present and tasty. Again an extremely juicy full flavored beer. Arguably my favorite beer from DFH. I look forward to this release as much as any other beer throughout the year."
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I'm not a fan of IPAs but I think Dogfish Head does a very good job with this one. Most beers that mix in fruit with their beer have the fruit dominate the palate but end up either ignoring the rest or just going crazy (I'm looking at you Wild Berry Lager.). Aprihop manages to mix the two without either problem. The only minor complaint is that the fruit taste more like generic fruit rather than Apricot but that's minor detail in my opinion. Too bad it's just a seasonal. I'd love to have a cold one of these during the summer."
"A delicious beer, I just wish it was amped up a bit more with apricot flavor. Apricot is a welcome addition to the citrus hop profile and I wish DFH went further with it. Altogether though, a very good beer."
"o: Not your typical IPA, but the apricots make it unique while not making it into a fruit beer. The combination of hops and the apricot are blended well. Signs of spring are upon us and this beer matches the season well."
"Mouthfeel is quite slick with hop resin coating your palate along with a decent amount of apricot. Finish is sweet, almost too sweet. This is really the only downside of the beer. Carbonation is good, with a medium body. Maybe a bit heavy and flavorful for the average persons idea of a spring seasonal, but beer geeks will enjoy."
"I would say this beer is quite unique and very refreshing. I could drink a bunch of these on a hot summer day. Another solid effort by Dogfish Head."
"drinkable - yep."
"Overall, I did not like this beer. This reminds me a lot of the 90 min which I did not like at all. The alcohol is not well integrated-the ethanol aroma and flavor is way too strong.It feels a lot like I am drinking a stronger beer. There is also way too much malt sweetness for me and I dont like the mouthfeel."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a snifter glass. The beer came out a nice dark orange color with an inch head that disappeared quickly. There was a fruity & hoppy aroma that was welcoming. The taste was greeted with the hops & grapefruit first that quickly gives away to the hint of apricot. I thought the apricot was done just right and not too noticeable. Overall I enjoyed the beer and would defiantly pick a 4 pack once a season when it comes out."
"Overall a different take on an ipa. The alcohol steals away from some of the flavor But I like it overall and makes for a great drinker."
"A little stronger apricot flavor would been preferred. All in all, not bad, but not as good as the hype led me to believe."
"O-Overall it's a decent beer, but I don't find myself eagerly anticipating another sip. At the end of the day you have to ask yourself ""would I buy this again."" For me, the answer is ""no."""
"Overall, its great seasonal brew. It captures Spring well. Over here in Chicago, it's still cold and gloomy but while my pint is still filled with this, it feels like Spring."
"This is my first bottle of anything Dogfish Head. Shot out to my boy the St. Charles Whisker Biscuit for picking this up for me. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This ale poured a hazy amber color and produced a nice 2 plus finger white creamy head. The aroma of the beer is dominated by bitter piney hops, grapefruit and apricot. Carbonation of this beer is perfect. It leaves a generous amount of lacing. The taste....the very first thing that I notice is that it reminds me a lot of a beer I had and reviewed the other day...Magic Hat #9. Only BETTER! This beer has a lot of hop bitterness and a nice apricot flavor. It's Magic Hat on ROIDS. While this beer might not be here to talk about the future...I say the future is bright for this crazy mix of IPA and fruit. Highly recommended!"
"Not super complex with just a few prominant flavors, but a very well made odd-ball, and that's just what you expect from DFH."
"O: Overall a pretty decent IPA. Not the IPA, but still good. The apricots blend surprisingly well with the hop characters."
"Overall, I want to drink this outside next time on a some spring day because this is tasty"
"I'm a fan of almost everything Dogfish does and this is no exception. I'm not crazy about it but it's pretty tasty. Well done guys."
"Overall: I was very, very pleasantly surprised, even overjoyed! Very refreshing. Here is a pretty little beer style seemingly perfected. One of my DFH faves. No more #9 for this beer Homer."
"O: one of my favorite seasonal brews and my favorite overall to take on a hike."
"Overall: Very good IPA overall. Another solid offering from Dogfish Head. I like that they're pushing the boundaries of what is expected of a particular style of beer. This is definitely worth a try."
"Good elements, though, so it lives on to fight another day."
"Pours a dark brown amber with a nice frothy head. Holds a nice finger of head midway through drinking the beer. Nose has some pine needles, alcohol esters, some sweet bread and sour citrus notes. Taste is bitter citrus hops and pine, along with some stone fruit, (cant really pick it out to be apricots) as well as some sweet malt and alcohol - not hot just noticeable. Finish is somewhat nice yet astrigent. Not a bad beer but drinking it after a red and white which i love. I know this really isnt ment to age but i am sitting on a few in hope that the alcohol and hops mellow and the fruit can come through a bit more."
"Overall, a solid seasonal brewski."
"O- This is a nice and refreshing beer. The IPA tag is more exciting on the label than in the taste. I would like to say add more hops, but I am sure some complexity would be lost in the interesting fruit notes. I will drink it again if more comes around, or possibly next year."
"Overall this is a very good brew - I may have subtracted 1/2 point only because no matter how much I enjoyed it, this wasn't the beer that I was expecting."
"O - Not a ton different than many IPA's, but different enough. I really enjoyed how subtle the apricot flavor was. Perhaps wrongly, I went into it expecting my experiences with pumpkin beers...while I enjoy them, I only enjoy them sparingly. Aprihop I could definitely see having more than one in a sitting. What I expect from a good IPA, but with a twist of Apricot. Good job DFH."
"Overall - I thought it was pretty good. But as good as it smelled, I felt the taste and mouthfeel didn't live up to what I had expected. In my opinion, it could have gone with more apricot, it was almost too subtle. The mouthfeel left a lot to be desired. But overall, a solid beer from DFH."
"D - I can't imagine drinking more than one of these. It was worthy the buy, but it wasn't smooth enough to make it a session beer."
"Rock n' Roll"
"Although this was a decent beer, I was a little disappointed in that it was much lighter than the average IPA and there was hardly any apricot presence."
"O- The aroma stood out for this brew. Taste didn't live up to the aroma but overall a solid bear."
"Overall - A light easy to drink beer. A standard ipa with some extra fruit and a little warm kick. Would be a great summer beer for a cookout or such."
"O: Didnt care for it but worth the experince"
"Scores: Appearance 4.5/5; Aroma 3/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4.5/5; Overall 4.5/5"
"Overall I was impressed with my first go-round of aprihop. really a solid beer all around and very drinkable."
"O- Overall, this is great, much better than i recalled from last year. Very thankful i decided to give it another shot this year. This beer is awesome."
"I'm excited to try this for the first time! Into a DFH glass this pours a clear and dark reddish-copper color under a sparse but thin well-sustained head. Aroma is an appealing nose of sweet syrup nectar citrus hops (perhaps Apricot noted...?) There's a smooth and delicious punch of hops here that's harmonized wonderfully with the toasted malt and complementary apricot. Cheers to an East Coast IPA Giant!"
"The mouthfeel is good, very silky smooth with sharp but not fizzy carbonation. The finish is slightly sweet but mostly dry. It took me a sip or two, but this is a great beer."
"overall- I enjoy this brew it reminds me that spring is on it's way. I purchase a fair amount of it every year and am never dissapointed"
"Great beer - I will buy again"
"Overall, it's nice. The fruity balance of it makes it a nice vacation from the typical IIPAs I drink when I go that route. The fruitiness definitely makes this a nice drink that I would dig while sitting on my porch with temperatures in the high 70s. Haha."
"Overall this is a pretty interesting fruit IPA, and I would definitely pick up a four pack of this instead of a single tester bottle next time."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. For me, this doesn't have nearly enough apricots and it seems to be caught in no-man's land for IPAs. There are much better citrusy IPAs out there, and although there's some pine in here as well, it's not exactly committed to that either."
"Overall: Not as much apricot as I would have liked, but this is a pretty young bottle. I'm going to commit IPA heresy and put a couple of bottles away for the apricot flavour to come through. Still, its very tasty and extremely smooth."
"D- easy to finish and one of the better ipas with integrated fruit that ive had. they do a good job with the delicate flavor of the apricot."
"O (D) - I like this beer. I think it's pretty unique, at least in my experience. The more I drink it, the more it grows on me. It's drinkable and tasty. I will buy more of this."
"Serving type: bottle"
"It's a good beer, but I was thinking like a hopped up #9."
"O - not a bad IPA, not a great IPA. Drinks pretty easily, doesn't destroy the palate, but I'm just not drawn to this beer. I'm going to miss Dogfish Head but I don't think I'm going to miss this beer too much"
"ApriHop surprised me quite a bit. It definitely delivered on the fruits, but it also managed to come out as a very, very good IPA as well. Definitely a great beer to quaff as the spring season rolls around. Bravo, DFH."
"Overall: a fairly decent beer that exceeded my expectations. I expected something in the vain of Magic Hat #9, but this beer luckily does not forget that it is an IPA first and foremost and has a good balance between hoppiness and the apricots. Worth a try. Cheers!"
"Don't totally know what to say. It comes off as a good IPA that tries to be more."
"Seasonal- Spring/Summer"
"Not sure about this one. It's drinkable and nice enough, but I was expecting more. DFH tries hard with this one, but I suspect it doesn't quite equal the sum of its parts."
"Rant through, it's a decent drink nonetheless. Looks pretty with a dense creamy off-white head that sticks well and retains a full cap over its hazy peach/iced-tea color. An overall super-malty, tropical bouquet and super-fruity, medium-thick, almost silky, quite bold malt foundation. Best enjoyed at cellar temp. It would be worlds better drier."
"M - Maybe a little thin but doesn't bring the beer down in my mind. Hopefully this is a good sign that spring is finally here!"
"O- A beer I would gladly drink if available to me on a regular basis. It is a better version of Magic Hat #9. While I am not normally a fan of fruited IPAs, this one is balanced enough even with its subdued flavors, to be well worth drinking on a warm summer day."
"Not your standard IPA, and with that said there certainly are much better IPA's out there. But as an IPA with fruit added, I believe that this one is a wonderful example."
"O: As it warms, the bitter of the apricot comes through more so than at the beginning. It begins to make for slmost too bitter of a beer but overall, it's a solid offering from DFH. Duh."
"It was a deep copper color with a thick, filmy, buttermilk colored head that clung to the glass. The smell is mainly apricot with a faint hint of citrusy hops. Overall the smell is mostly tropical. The beer bites at the back of the tongue, there are some sour, lemony flavors then the sweet apricot takes over and there is a bitter, resinous aftertaste. It feels pretty light, the carbonation really attacks the mouth but it has a pleasant finish. This is by far the best fruit beer I've ever had (unless you count Ommegang Three Philosophers) I thought the apricot went well with the other hop flavors."
"D-Nice refreshing brew all around apricot really compliments the IPA. One of my favorites from DFH."
"Serving type: bottle"
"DB- Not a bad beer to sit back and drink but for some reason I was expecting a lot out of apricot + IPA. It really doesn't blend all that well for me in the end. Not bad, not something I will get again."
"O - Highly drinkable, with a reasonable enough ABV. A brew I look forward to every year."
"Drink- New tradition for the coming years. Grab an aprihop to compare. This was my 1st year to be able to buy a single bottle and not have a sixer go to waste if I didn't like it."
"D- I can go through two of these before I wreck my pallete. A unique twist that I havent seen yet in this category thats worth exploring"
"D - Like I said, this is a great Spring-day beer, and I can see myself having many before it disappears from the shelves."
"Overall good drinkability and I can see my self having a couple if it were on tap near me. Good solid beer from DFH."
"D - Could easily drink some of these on a brisk day or even on the beach. A very nice brew."
"2010 is another good year for Aprihop. Hop/apricot nose after a lacy copper colored pour. Nice head retention, and the aroma makes it to your nose before you pick up the glass. Tart, dry fruit on the first sip. Hops are blended well and can be picked out easily after repeated sips. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Not much bitter in the finish, and at no time does it strike me as sweet."
"I find this very drinkable at 7%. It is a mouth-full, but it also finishes dry. I'll have to keep this one in mind for spring BBQs."
"d: Very nice flavor to it, though with the plentiful hop flavor and bitterness, I don't need more than one. The flavor is well balanced enough for me to easily enjoy this glass and move to the next afterwards. Great drinkability for the type of brew."
"2011 vintage. Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a slight off-white, medium head that diminishes quickly. Scent is nice and hoppy with some pine and apricot... a lot more ""west-coastish"" than 90 and 60 minute. Taste is rather hoppy as well. Not nearly as much malt as Dogfish Head is known for in their IPAs...which suits my mood nice right now. There are lovely pine notes as well as hints of citrus and apricot...not nearly as much apricot as I remember last year. Mouthfeel is rather creamy and crisp at the same time. Drinkability is high."
"D - I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Its very drinkable, more so than many other beers from this, in my opinion, overrated brewery. My only wish it that the apricot was more prominent in the flavor profile. I will buy this beer again."
"D: Easy to drink although not necessarily a session beer. For Dogfish Head's more fruity side of beers I'd definitely prefer a Festina Peche than this Aprihop, although worth trying I probably wouldn't buy again."
"pours a gorgeous amber color with offwhite head. very strong lacing. Very clean look to this one. decent hop aroma, but also getting a bit of malt presence. no real fruit or apricot presence in the smell. however, upon tasting, the apricot does come through. although they don't clash, the fruit and hops don't seem to ""blend"" together entirely and it's as if someone poured an IPA into my #9. Decent, but not sure why this doesn't come together exactly. mouthfeel is nice, and a little creamy from the head. drinkability is good. it's a nice alternative to the normal spring offerings."
"Dogfish really nails the tastes of their beers and when they say thats how it will taste thats how it will definitely taste in a balanced manner. There are so many other flavors than just the apricot in this that it just makes it an awesome complex beer that anybody can enjoy."
"Pours a really beautiful copper color with a small white head. I get some piny hops and fruit on the nose. Tastes like a solid IPA. I really don't get much apricot in this. I would have scored it higher if the apricot was bolder. Still a good IPA. Worth seeking out."
"The taste is more of the herbal hop flavor, which dominates the fruit and sweet caramel malt. Still good. Light and refreshing. Crisp. But the flavors don't perfectly blend."
"D: Good drinkability. Not much of a fruit flavor, so I could have at least two before getting sick of them. A good early spring beer."
"D - Glad I tried it, but not sure if I would buy again. Was an interesting pairing with the fruit in an IPA. Would love to try it fresh from a tap."
"D - This has good drinkability. it goes down easy and the flavor is really nice. This is a very interesting twist on the style. I really like how the apricot is not at all overpowering, but it still comes through nicely. It is quite nicely balanced as well. I like this beer, and I will be having more for sure."
"Mouthfeel is bubbly and fizzy at times, but mostly crisp and clean. Drinkability is helped by the nice finish, but hurt by the imbalance in flavors for the middle of the beer. I like this, but definitely am a bit disappointed, as the label had me pretty excited."
"Still enjoyable, but I would've preferred the hops to be ramped up a little bit."
"Pours a clear copper with a medium white head that fades fast and leaves sea foam lace. The smell is hoppy and fruity. Citrus, lemon and apricot with a bready background. The taste follows the nose. The hops puts the apricot in the back seat. Lemon, green apple, grapefruit, and pine followed by a sweet touch of apricot and bready notes. Medium bodied and smooth. Very nice IPA."
"Love this beer. Appears like it might be made with hops and apricots. Smells like hops and apricots. Tastes like hops and apricots. Mouthfeel is of hops and apricots. I can drink many of these since they taste like hops and apricots. Love this beer. Boom, reviewed."
"Drinkability: Pretty darn high, even if you're not a hophead."
"An interesting brew from Dogfish Head. I won't say that this is one of their best, but it is worth a try. Don't think I would go out of my way to get another one, but at the same time I am glad I tried one."
"Drinks fabulous. Typically delicious as is expected from DFH."
"Drinkability is not too bad...goes down easy, no real alcohol detection, but this is just not the beer for me."
"Mouthfeel / Taste - As stated, quite plain and watery. I don't see what the big hype for this beer is. It's just average and slightly fruity and sour. A big letdown from Dogfish Head."
"Drinkability: This beer would be absolutely fantastic in the summer time -- very refreshing, sweet, but not cloyingly so; ABV may kick in just a bit after a couple, but I would happy to sip on this all summer long."
"The taste is good an ipa but perhaps a little more sweet up front. The flavor is sweet malt to start it quickly becomes fruity and citrus. the taste lingers and finishes leaving nearly no taste at the end very interesting."
"D: Won't be picking this one back up; offers little in comparison to the wealth of other IPAs out there."
"Great classic IPA look to it. The smell- sweet hops and a bit of fruit. Not overwhelming. The taste was an average IPA with very mild fruit. I expected more sweetness from DFH to be honest, but glad this was reserved. Maybe too reserved though. I thought the taste was very mild and would rather stick with a solid IPA or IIPA instead of a fruity limited release like this. I can recognize it as an above average beer... one that was not too sweet and I could drink several of, however I would not go out of my way to buy a pack. One was enough- on to the next one..."
"D - this is definitely worth the money, would recommend as a stepping stone for someone who wasn't sure about IPA. this would probably go great with some jerk chicken"
"D- Really cant see anything stopping me from drinking a couple four packs. Good stuff."
"The mouthfeel is lighter for an IPA, but absolutely works here, and the drinkability is off the charts. A superbly excellent brew from Dogfish, I'm not quite sure why they get all the hype for their ""extreme"" beers when their lower ABV brews tend to be their best. Absolutely love this."
"D: super drinkable. if you like what dogfish does with their hops then go seek some out."
"So, popped it open excited for the apricot, but curious how it would come. First surprise was the body. It's not very heavy at all - pretty smooth and creamy. Smelled the apricot off the bat, nice aroma and appearance, and on tasting, it pretty hard to resist guzzling it down. Nice bitterness and a little bit of woodiness in the mix. Can't wait to find a six pack of this stuff for a better price."
"D- Great session beer. I'm excited to be able to drink a bunch of these at a summer BBQ. Cheers Sam! Great beer !"
"The carbonation is a bit sharp on this but It's got a nice body. This is one I look forward to every year."
"Remarkably refreshing and easy to drink for a beer that leaves such a bitter residue in your mouth. I was planning on trying a different beer tonight, but I may just open another one of these."
"Drinkability: A very unique and highly enjoyable IPA. This beer combines the more delicate characteristics of Magic Hat #9 with the assertive hoppy flavor of Dogfish Head's other IPAs- it is a marriage that should not work, but everything falls in place beautifully. A wonderful beer and another gem from Dogfish."
"Poured from the tap a nice coppery amber color with a tight off white head that left some spoty lacing through the beer. Smell is hop forward, citrus and floral hop notes with a hint of sweet malt, and maybe a bit of apricot in the background. Taste is like a normal American IPA good floral citrus hop profile with a nice sweet malt backbone with just enough apricot in the middle to let you know why they call it aprihop. Mouthfeel is nice and balanced not to heavy or syrupy good balance of carbonation to bring forward the cirtus hop. Drinkability is great on this beer, very nice beer when the weather warms and you want a nice citrus/floral IPA not to dry or sweet good balance."
"D: I wish the ABV was lower as this would be a killer crossover session summer beer. It is good but it would be a much better fruit beer than IPA. Always grab a 4 pack every year though."
"I buy a case every year. If you're a straight up hophead or DIPA fan... don't get this. It isn't for you. What this is is a nice plain old American IPA with just another layer to peek the interest... some apricot."
"D: This is a delicious beer and perfect for springtime."
"D: Uncertain how to answer this. I had a 4oz pour which I really enjoyed. Its got apricots and high bitterness (yay) but I don't know how I'd feel drinking 12 oz all at once."
"A beautiful golden amber color with a decent white head and similar lacing. The aroma is a brisk citrus hop with a sweet bread support. Very nice. The flavor is a strong citrus orange with an apricot-pear sweetness and thick biscuit. It's solidly mid-bodied with modest carbonation. It's near syrupy in feel but plenty drinkable. This is a quality hop beer with the added enjoyment of the fruit theme. A high quality concoction that I recommend to any hop lover or curious fruit fan."
"Taste starts off hoppy and then you get the apricots at the back end to sweeten the deal. It is very easy to drink a few of these without realizing it. The 7% isn't that bad, but it can sneak up on you pretty easily. Definitely one of my favorite offerings from Dogfish."
"Another Dogfish Head masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. This is truly one of my favorite beers."
"A nice IPA, not really overly hoppy, and fairly sweet. I wish the hops and apricots were more pronounced, though."
"D-very drinkable, if you didn't tell me it was brewed with apricots I would never know. Solid ipa"
"Rivals the Punkin Ale as my favorite DFH seasonal. Great beer."
"Drinking great now though!"
"I am surprised by the success of the hop profile's combination with fruit. The grassy/piney character of the hops work (in my imagination) against fruit flavors, but here they are united relatively successfully. The beer is very much so an IPA and is overall very similar to DFH's 60 minute IPA, with the apricots being a twist, not the focus, of this beer."
"D: A nice spring beer, especially with the apricots. 60 minute alone is definitely a spring-y beer because of the floral hops, and the fruit just adds to it. A 4-pack is perfect for an evening outside"
"D : pretty good, although I wouldn't be drinking more than a couple."
"I could drink this beer quite often. There is nothing overbearing about this beer to give me a reason not to. Its a nice one, but a 6pk of 60 minute is the same price as this 4pk, and I like it as much if not more."
"D: This one is easy to drink, but has a weak taste and palate."
"A easy drinking beer that wont challenge your senses, nor is it boring. I would enjoy it more on a hot summer night."
"Picked up a couple of bottles of this one the other day on a whim. Poured into a stemmed glass. Nice medium copper with a finger of white foam. Nice hoppy aromas lead to a medium bodied beer. Good hoppy flavors, orange, citrus and caramel. Not a whole lot of apricot on either the nose or palate, but still an enjoyable IPA."
"D: I've always found it odd which beers DFH decides to put in 4-packs as opposed to 6ers. I think this is one that should be given the 6 pack treatment. Highly drinkable!"
"I usually dont like fruit added to beer but the apricot in this adds so much unique complexity to the hops and it works out so well. Amazing drinkability."
"D-An Interesting take on the fruit beer meets IPA, however at the end of the day too fruity sweet for an IPA. A valiant effort but maybe fruit beer and IPA should avoid having offspring."
"Pours a wonderful amber. Almost a reddish tone with a minimal foam head. Smells very fruity. Hints of apricot (obviously) as well as some pineapple crossed with flowery / piney hops. Great mouthfeel. Very smooth yet still brings a slight fruity tang to it. A nice bite of grassy hops really finishes off nicely. Tasty beer here, will drink again."
"-Cheers"
"Copper color. Okay head with a little lacing down the glass. Pine and apricot hops. Probably simcoe and either palisade. The apricot flavor adds a nice floral scent. Good hop taste with apricots -- kind of like a Magic Hat #9. Good carbonation and a nice body on this. I would not have guessed a 7% abv. So the alcohol was hidden. I am probably going to pick this up again. Nice summer type fruit alternative IPA."
"D - I like this, is a more erudite Magic Hat #9. Can definitely have a couple of these at one sitting."
"D- A well balanced beer that hides its alcohol well. I dug it and could happily drink another."
"Really a good seasonable here, and without a doubt the best of the few apricot-flavored beers I've had."
"A really tasty beer that I highly recommend to drink fresh. Delicious."
"Drinkability: It's not smooth enough to put away a lot of these or make this any kind of a sessionable beer. Maybe this needs a little age to mellow out."
"Drank it all and I loved it"
"D/N - Very drinkable. Not as complex as I thought it would be but I do think the apricots gave this beer a cleaner mouth feel. The lemony after taste work well with the level of carbonation."
"D: very drinkable beer and tasty too. Very glad I got the chance to try this one out fresh. Good lookin out my brotha joe."
"D - This brew drinks moderately easy. At 7% there is not trace of alcohol nor should there be for a good IPA."
"Pretty beer - deep amber base with a puffy white head. Good retention, less lacing. Smell is candied apricots, hops, and some nice biscuity malts. Good flavor, thinner than 90 min but not quite as light as 60 min. I remember the taste and mouthfeel having more apricot last year. Also picking up a lingering metallic taste this year. Overall a decent brew, but I prefer 2010 vintage."
"D - This is a really good IPA on it's own. The apricot just adds another dimension of complexity to the taste. I can't wait to try one of these on a warm summer day."
"D - Not my cup of tea. It's not objectionable, but it's kinda all over the place. Good if you like a mini adventure in your beer, but I tend to gravitate elsewhere. With that said, I can appreciate what they were shooting for. Just kind of misses the mark for me."
"Pours a deep copper amber with off white foamy head. Nose is citrus and grapefruit hops, apricots, floral. Taste is sweet fruits, bitter at first and slightly sour. Very fresh tasting with a nice hop profile. Light bodied mouthfeel. Overall this is a wicked spring seasonal beer that Dogfish Head does so well, one of the reasons they're one of my top breweries. Perhaps a little thin bodied, I got a couple 4 packs to enjoy this spring and note any apricot and hop flavour changes. Wonderful."
"Fun for a spring seasonal bit too heavy in the body but still so good wish it was out for more than 3 months in the year."
"I keep finding myself just wanting more and more, I could easily drink all four of these in a couple hours. Just not tonight, gotta work in the morning. Sure glad I picked up 2 4-packs!"
"I've always loved Aprihop. At the end of the day, it's an outstanding IPA. It feels like an IPA, the apricots aren't a gimmick. Very creative beer.. highly recommended."
"drinkability - found this to be a great beer, really fresh as well, if i would have known, i would have bought the whole case before he opened it! I like a more pine based IPA, but this fruity style was very impressive."
"This is a cool take on the IPA style. I can definitely get the apricots, although this is more of an IPA than a Fruit Beer. The main problem to me is that its too dry and most of the flavor I got was from the beginning of the sip, leaving the end really empty. It is still a nice beer but I would probably have a quality regular IPA instead."
"I've had this before in the past many times and I still can not get into it. It's neither noticeably fruity, or particularly a fond IPA that I would want to have. Glad to review it again, but like always I will pass on this every-time it comes out. Not liking apricots to begin with probably explains part of it as well."
"Overall, a good beer this year. Not overly fruity. They got back to the IPA base they were seeking. Nice little seasonal from DFH."
"Drink - The bottle I had was really fresh and I was surprised at how much I liked this beer. I prefer the more fruity types of IPA's and this one fit the bill perfectly. I'll be sure to seek it out again."
"Lighter medium body, super smooth feel. Drinks great, super refreshing, and the alcohol is invisible. This is one of my favorites from DFH and I'm glad to see it back."
"On tap at DFH poured into pint glass. Pours clear orange with a big foamy white head. Moderate lacing. Fresh apricots mixed with slightly piney hops and light caramel. Light, medium-carbonated mouthfeel. Fresh citrus and mild pine hops up front complimented nicely with the apricots which burst through in the middle. The malt is much lighter than expected, and lets the apricot taste come through without making it too sweet or sticky. Earthy, fruity finish that's not too long. Very refreshing."
"Notes: Looks like this beer being bottled 11 months ago was not a problem at all. It has me thinking of picking up a fresh Aprihop, a really good beer!"
"D: Very refreshing beer, great for a summers day."
"D-before i realized it, my glass was empty. i couldn't believe it, i inhaled this drink. I could drink the entire 4 pack tonight if i didn't want to save it. this is one of the easiest drinking beers i've ever had. 7%..? i don't know how. i'd guess 4%"
"The first time I had this i was not impressed. I was however the second time. Pours a inviting clear golden, well apricot color. Almost no head. Smells hoppy and sharp, can smell the alcohol. Tastes super tart and is not overwhelmed by the apricots. I liked this better when served cold. Clean mouthfeel and I believe this beer to be drinkable. If it wasn't for the 7% abv, might be a good session beer."
"The aroma, gave off an almost mildy sweet smell, with hints of apricot. The taste was heavier than I would have thought for a spring time beer, but it drank smoothly. It definitely left a fruity taste in my mouth, that was not unpleasant."
"I was slightly disappointed in the overall taste of this beer. The apricot flavors are pronounced, but it was slightly too malty for my taste. It could be improved with better balance to allow the apricot flavor to come though better. Otherwise, the mouth feel and aroma were ok."
"D - nice summer time beer. Nicely balanced."
"Copper pour with a 2 finger, white head. Apricot and citrus aroma with a little candi sugar and some faint caramel malt. The flavor is mostly citrus upfront with a strong, lingering candied apricot note. The malt is caramel and some subtle nuts. It a bit on the cloying side. Sticky, medium body with soft carbonation."
"Wow I didnt expect much out of this beer and I could see the sweetness easily be too much for a lot of beer drinkers but I love it. Cant wait to get more!"
"D: Very drinkable - split the 6-pack with a friend of mine in one sitting. The sweetness was starting to get to both of us by the end of it though. I'd definitely drink this one again."
"I am not always the biggest fan of IPA's, because I find many of them very imbalanced and too powerful. However, this could be a favorite of mine due to the tart fruit, decent balance, and the fact it isn't a ""punch you in the face"" IPA."
"M- This beer was good and I would have a couple but a 4 pack is a little too much for me. I like this beer don't get me wrong but only a couple for me please."
"Cheers!"
"D= For me this is a nice change went down nice. The flavor works for me it would be but I wouldn't drink a whole bunch of these in one night."
"D: A nice idea from DFH, but the apricot is a little too much for me in the middle, but it is a nice beer, worthy of a try."
"(D)- An interesting and engaging take on the style. The apricot fruit fits well into the style that creates an interesting dynamic play with the light pine and malt. Tasty, even with a few months of age on it."
"Haven't been disappointed by this brewery yet. I'm always sad when spring brings the new season boring wheat beers and lagers for the hot east TN summer to come, so I was excited about a real beer ment for spring/summer drinking. Apperance- nice color, head, seemed thin enough for hot weather. Really wish it was bottle conditioned. Aroma- lots of US hops. Can't discern the real fruit from the hop ""fruit"". A little yummy bread and malt underneath. Taste- real hard to taste the apricot, so overwhelmmed buy hops. Oh wait there it is in the aftertaste. Right after you taste the bready toasty malt there is the apricot. Not to much bitterness. Mouthfeel- as expected full enough to feel, light enough to enjoy on a picnic. Drinkable- quite yes. A great blend of styles, needs more fruit and a little yeast sitting in the bottom."
"I wouldn't mind drinking a few more of these while they're in season. It makes a good spring beer and they didn't let it get too overwhelming with the fruit they added. Kudos dogfish, I will drink your girly-man drink...and enjoy it."
"IPA or fruit beer? Enjoyed at Beer Bistro. Hoppy aroma. Cloudy grapefruit with a small yet significant thick layer, maybe 1/4 inch of off-white head. Pleasant lace left afterwards in my glass. The mouthfeel is a tad above average, and a drying finish. I am getting some fruity essence in the beer, but closer to an IPA in taste, significantly hoppy. Drinkability is average."
"D-If this beer hits your tongue the right way it is pretty drinkable. I wouldn't try it again but I do find that it was easy to drink."
"(Reviewed from notes)"
"The beer is a light golden brown color, with a dense medium-sized white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass. The aroma is of just what the name implies, hops and apricots, along with some caramelized malts. The tart flavor of apricots hits hard up front followed by a quick burst of hops bitterness. The two together seem rather harsh. There's a hearty malt character and a touch of caramel sweetness, but they're not enough to provide the balance that is sorely needed in this beer; although it does get a little better as it warms. The after-taste is bitter. Crisp but not too smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean. It's flavorful but I didn't find it too tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, Unlike many fruit beers, this one doesn't use the fruit flavor to try covering up the fact that it is still a beer, but this is definitely not a beer that I would want to drink again."
"If you have had this before and wish that there was more hop flavor, give this another try. I know that it's later into the year for this seasonal, but I have seen these marked down in several locations, which makes it much more appealing to try."
"Drinkability - I can't escape the odd aftertaste of the apricots. I credit DFH for making an attempt to pair a different flavor with hops but apricot isn't working for me. This is one worth trying at least once, but Apricots just don't seem to work in a beer."
"D - Very smooth and refreshing, great for the spring and summer months. This is a perfect beer after a long day of sweating you ass off doing yard work and then sitting back on the back porch with the evening breeze drinking an ApriHop out of a glass."
"Just no balance in this beer for me. If it was free, I don't think I would partake. Maybe better on tap, who knows..."
"-overall, it is an okay summer beer, but i am not crazy about the cot/hop mix as stated in the taste. considering it is an IPA, its probably not even in my top 100 for the style"
"Bottle pours a clear, dark amber/brown colour. Tastes of nice bitter hops with some apricot lingering in the finish with a nice malt backbone. This was quite decent overall and I didn't find myself disappointed with this. Alc % is well hidden and this drinks very smooth. Very interesting take on a ipa."
"Very drinkable overall, and perhaps the lack of overt apricot flavors works to this brew's advantage. Very nicely balanced."
"D - I don't know. I'll let you know when I have another one...or three"
"Dogfish Head Aprihop is a slightly hazy amber ale with a thick, fluffy, yellowish head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a hoppy, fruity aroma-- yum!-- with grassy, floral hops and apricot. It's medium bodied and pretty smooth with a dry, slightly chalky finish. There's lots of apricot in the flavor. It tastes semi-dry and quite bitter; grassy and a bit resiny. It's clearly an IPA, but the apricot is present throughout. This is a very refreshing and exciting beer!"
"Pours a brownish amber with a one finger cream head. Decent lacing. Apricot and citrus aroma. Taste starts off with a little citrus hops and then the apricot sweetness kicks in all the way until finish. A very sweet apricot malt, definitely lives up to the namesake. Low carbonation and a very creamy mouthfeel. Average drinkability, perhaps a little too sweet."
"D: Goes down easy, but the sweetness limits its drinkability to a certain extent."
"D: A very refreshing IPA; perfect with spicy food on a hot, humid day"
"Verdict: At the end of the day, Aprihop isn't an IPA with lots of apricot character, but instead just a solid and tasty IPA. I'm not sure if they have adjusted the recipe recently, but this is a much more enjoyable proposition than the last time I tried the beer."
"Drinkability: the apricot addition does indeed help here. It keeps the beer interesting, and helps prevent the hop flavor onslaught from wearing the palate. Good stuff."
"Pours a hazy copper to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, piney hops and a small hint of apricot sweetness. In the taste, piney hops but smoothed out with a fruity sweetness. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel with a sweet hoppy aftertaste. Kind of like 60 minute with a fruity hint."
"D: Quite nice, I'm feeling the alcohol. Easy to drink"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with good carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, and I would love to try it a bit more fresh, as I found it quite enjoyable, but would like to see if the flavors were more upfront. I did really enjoy the notes of apricot flavors as well."
"Beer is medium body and has an odd sweetness on the front palate. its interesting for sure. There is some nice pine flavors in the midpalate and then some mlid bitterness at the back. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is fine. Its not too carbonated on the tongue. Overall its pretty good. I would make it slightly less sweet and more dry. May bring out the fruit better."
"Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith Imperial pint. Pours red orange with a one finger off-white head that slowly subsides to minimal. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of hops, fruit, and sweet malt. The flavor is of malt, hops, fruit, and apricot (surprise). It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this is a very nice twist on the traditional IPA. The apricot touch adds a bit of sweet to the usual bitter variety. If you are a hop fan and want to try something different this is worth a shot."
"This may be my favorite Dogfish Head offering in the IPA department. The apricot flavor is milder than expected, and I think that the warmth that it provides greatly enhances this classic IPA profile. I'm not sure that I'd be able to pinpoint the apricot flavor if I wasn't already aware of it as it complements this style so nicely."
"http://i-like-cold-beverages.blogspot.com/2010/06/new-weekly-column-what-im-drinking.html"
"Pours deep golden amber, nice fine, sticky head. Smell is of the apricots and nice bubblegum hops. Taste is smooth, fruity (apricots & grapefruit) and pleasantly hoppy. Decent malt body too. Feel is good for a fruit-added brew. Finishes with that lucid, pithy, moderately oily feel of the apricot. Darn tasty."
"Dogfish Head rarely lets me down, I will definitely have this again."
"D - Easy to drink, and a nice change of pace, but not my favorite offering from DFH. Probably could use more apricot to justify the name."
"O: This beer has alot of drinkability. Great Spring time/summertime drinking. My recommendation would be to kick up the apricots to previous years. I really enjoyed the tartness from before. Granted I know, it's not for the masses, but it was a welcome addition IMO ;) As to style this beer fits well within parameters."
"D: Nothing beats it after a long, hot day and the sausages are grilling and you're thirsty for something a little different."
"D: I could session this beer anytime if it was not for the price, $10/4 pack. Being an IPA fan, this does not satisfy my hops addiction. But is a good beer non-the-less."
"D: My brain is telling me that this would be a phenomenal summer IPA. The choice of fruit works quite well with the hop dosage of an IPA, and I will be having this again on a hot summer day. This is a crisp and refreshing American IPA."
"D: Easy to drink, an interesting and well crafted beer"
"Taste was a pleasant surprise. It definitely taste like an india pale ale but with the added touch of the apricot. Very nicely balanced with good carbonation and very drinkable."
"D: The alcohol is well hidden, making the beer very easy to drink."
"took a final today and have been looking forward to this all day. poured a dark amber color. it is and IPA with apricots and had a sweet citrus smell and taste. the head on the beer was a light to medium tan color. very smooth taste, with dogfish's IPA style complimented with the sweet apricots. good stuff. give it a try"
"Overall this beer was a pleasant surprise up until the first sip. Dogfish Head (Sam) make some really quality beers but this one doesn't impress as much. Still, it was worth a try."
"Balanced and drinkable, far from being either a gimmick or your average fruit beer."
"I was afraid that the apricot flavor might overwhelm things here, but it was really well balanced and incorporated into the overall flavor. This would be definitely enjoyable to IPA fans in general, and might be a good intro to IPAs (or even craft beers) for the uninitiated. Would hardly be my everyday IPA, but definitely a nice little treat."
"Overall, nothing special or terrible about this brew. It won't kill you to try it, but it won't thrill you either."
"D: Though the apricot is apparent in both the nose and the flavor, this is not much different from your average IPA. Good citrus nose with a taste that is... dare I say a bit too complex and muddled? I like my IPA's clean and balanced and single-minded and there's a bit much going on here. Still, worth trying if you want something that's a bit out there but is still in touch with its stylistic roots."
"this is a very drinkable beer. the 7% abv is slightly noticeable and the one thing to keep this one from being too drinkable (is there such a thing?). I could definitely enjoy a couple of pints of this ipa with no problem"
"D - Very easy drinking, balanced beer."
"drinkability - the apricot is a nice touch, big flavors here, wish the hops were more prevailing for an IPA"
" Overall I enjoy this beer and would buy it again, however it is a tad too sweet to be something I would drink regularly. I'd say a great Spring seasonal."
"This is a great fruit beer, an IPA that would be delicious in itself with a great apricot addition."
"Have now had this from bottle, tap, and cask and enjoy it everytime. A really good ""fruit"" beer, even though its more of an IPA/fruit beer mix, which isn't surprising coming from DFH."
"I have had this beer a few times luckily because this time is yet one more testament to the importance of freshness. This bottle was clearly stamped with 2-19-10 so it is my own fault that this was clearly past its time. While some beers will keep, this one clearly does not, without a toll. My review will thus be based some on my memory of FRESH Aprilhop. Beer pours a dark hazy amber. One-finger head settles quickly to a white coating which remains until the end. Nose is earthy hops and fruit, some grapefruit-like and some which may indeed be apricot-like. Medium body and carbonation is evident but not heavy. Taste starts as an IPA might, but the malt backbone and sweet apricot-like fruits balance this pretty well. There is some movement to dry and bitter finish but never overly so. I will absolutely try this again but watch the ""brewed on"" VERY carefully. I suggest you do as well."
"I generally disdain fruit beers, but I like this one. A lot. That being said, I really am having trouble calling it a fruit beer. There is something sweet in there toning down the hops, but it's not distinctively fruity, much less definitively apricot. Overall recommended though."
"Surprisingly good to drink from the bottle, and I didn't feel like I was missing out too much by not pouring into a glass."
"This beer is a very refreshing IPA with a not to much fruit back but just enough to make it refreshing."
"Nice carbonation and mouthfeel. Definitely drinkable if I'm ever in the mood for fruit-flavored beers."
"Well carbonated, medium bodied, and easy to drink. A nice drinkable beer."
"I first tried this in 2009 and did not like it at all. I tried it the day it first came in and it was far too bitter. I tried it this year and gave it about a month and a half to sit. The taste was much better than I remembered it and even more so the more time allowed. I'd recommend it for anyone who like's IPAs and is willing to try a different take on the IPA."
"Another good beer from DFH."
"This is not an IPA I'd reach for with regularity but it's perfect as a spring seasonal. The apricots give it a refreshing quality but it still has some heft to it. I never picked this up before but I'm wishing I had. I'll definitely grab another 4 pack next spring."
"As an IPA, the subdued hop flavors leave a little to be desired. As a summer beer however, Aprihop performs admirably, delivering refreshing tartness to balance a balmy day."
"D: Very drinkable at 7%, could easily down a few of these with ease. A solid all around IPA with a unique fruit flavoring. Recommended for a great summer time brew"
"D: very easy due to it similarity to 60 min and the added slight apricot."
"D: Fruit and floral character an interesting blend. Not sure I'd be a fan, but well worth trying. Personally, too much fruity flavor in beer fills me up."
"A clear golden/amber color pour with a lasting foamy offwhite head , medium carbonation , lots of spotty lacing . Aroma of citrus hops, apricots , light nutty toasty caramel malt with just a hint of alcohol . Flavor is of piny and citrus hops wraping around a small amount of apricot , a nice toasty nutral malt flavor coming through at the end , finishes dry and hoppy . Full body with a crisp dry mouthfeel. Very drinkable and sessionable . The apricots mix very well with the whole IPA thing , very nice."
"Pours from the 12oz bottle a crystal clear, tawny copper with a two finger bone white head. Retention dies down to a ring, leaving blobs of lace on the glass. Aroma is dominated by citrus notes and apricot; there's a touch of pine accompanied by caramel malt sweetness, too. Taste is tropical fruit hop-like and apricot - it's a nice blend of flavors. There's also a smidge of pine resin accompanied by a strong malt backbone. Mouthfeel seems a little oily, yet at the same time, a little thin. Drinkability is up there - this is refreshing stuff... hopefully it'll still be around in the summer."
"Notes: I like this. There are only a few fruit beers I go for but this one's pretty good. I saw Sam Caligione's (sp??) video where he said for a while DFH let the apricots come through too much in this one and they've recently reigned it in to get back to a real deal American IPA with apricots used for a unique touch. Seems like they're heading back that way, and I actually think the apricots could be scaled back even more and would still show their character and make this a remarkable IPA. As is it is definitely good and derfinitely unique."
"D: Nice change of pace IPA, somewhat drinkable at 7% ABV, but has good fruit flavors making it a nice spring/summer seasonal brew."
"D: Nice IPA with some boosted floral and fruity notes. This was tasted fresh, which I think helps as the hops really come through nicely. Not sure this would rate nearly as well a couple months from now."
"Another tasty off-centered ale from Dogfish Head. Exactly what I'd expect."
"Overall, a great springtime hoppy/fruity beer. Will be drinking this again for sure."
"D: Extremely drinkable. The bitter aftertaste really balances the sweet floral notes, and really dries the palate enough to warrant another sip...and another, and so on."
"This is one tasty beer...basically 60 Minute with an added touch. I was apprehensive given my last apricot beer was the terribly mediocre offering by Pyramid in the early 1990s, but Aprihop shatters all preconceptions and makes for one dangerously drinkable IPA."
"This beer pours a lovely deep amber with a reddish hue and nice slightly off-white head that sticks around and sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is perfume-esque with plenty of apricot, pine and floral notes. The taste is surprising and quite nice. It seems to have more citrus and pine hops than apricot, but the apricot is definitely still present. The combination of hops and fruit gives it a really nice floral flavor. Bitterness is impressive, but not overbearing. A lot more malt presence can be picked up in the taste, and it is a very toasty malt character at that. Medium bodied with a nice dry finish and good carbonation. Very drinkable, and with the recipe update for this season Aprihop is back to being a superb spring seasonal."
"D: Pretty good beer. Don't normally love fruit beers but this one was thought through and well done. it was a highlight of fruit on an already good beer."
"D: first sip is incredible with nice intense fresh fruit flavors but the sweetness gets a little much"
"A pretty unique and tasty brew! I would love to have this on cask or wine barrel aged!"
"I would highly suggest this beer even if you don't like fruity ones. It seems like everything that comes out of Dogfish Head is top notch."
"D- This is a great beer for the warmer spring and summer monthes. It is very refreshing and goes down easy. I wish that DFH would put it out both spring and summer this way I would not have to stock up so much in the spring."
"I feel a little bad reviewing this beer 2 months old, but what can you do? It's not out of code or anything, it's just a little too old for an IPA. Anyway, I can't rave about this beer, but it's good. If you like apricot (i do), this is sort of a good-but-unremarkable vehicle for a really nice apricot taste. It has some aspects that suggest a great IPA, but it doesn't really get there for me. If I try this again fresh and it blows my mind, I'll rereview. As is, I'd still recommend it to friends looking for a solid and refreshing beer within the next month or two."
" The stem of the glass is a purdy gold, while the bulb when held to the light shines a brilliant amber. Tiny bubbles of a less than white head fades quickly into a resilient cap. The aromas from Aprihop are dominant IPA. That being said the faint existence of a light fruity apricot slide through almost undetected. The prior knowledge of their presence may be the only reason I can pick them out. Citric grapefruit, orange and a smidgen of lemon take the main stage. Very dry in the nose with very little grain in the aroma, uncharacteristic of a Dogfish IPA. The first taste hits the tongue with a balanced hop bitterness and sweetness from malt and fruit. The dry and hoppy ale leave very little aftertaste. The bitterness is easily over come my the carbonation and apricot. I believe I can pick out some bread, caramel and yeasty blends that quickly fade. The ale was built for warm weather drinking and I find it to be refreshing for the hot spring days. Aprihop has inspired me to hop a Hefe blended with apricot. I will be writing the recipe for it with another Aprihop in hand."
"This seems to be a marriage between the taste of the 60 min with the 90 min and apricots thrown in to boot. Everything balances out nicely, the apricots are not overwhelming, and even the barley gives it a nice added dimension."
"D: This is a good beer! I think its alittle to pricey for a four pack. I think that for most of DFH brews. But they are worth it. I would only drink 2 of these in one sitting, and leave the other 2 for another time. I would consider this as a 4-pack per year beer."
"A nice coppery-amber beer with a floral hops smell, and a taste that nicely combines hops and apricot - I am usually skeptical of apricot beers, but this was a very nice and subtle fruit flavor. A nice medium-carbonated mouthfeel, and very high drinkability for a fruit-flavored beer. This is a highly drinkable IPA first, and an apricot beer second."
"Drinkability was great. No alcohol taste and the balance between sweet and bittier was very nice. I've been wanting to try this for some time and I'm glad I got to have it on tap."
"D-Light and easy drinking yet very flavorful and enjoyable especially since I'm not the biggest apricot fan."
"I am having an enjoyable time drinking this and feel I could continue through several and still be entertained."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. I like pairing the apricots with the hops. I think that IPAs could be paired more with other tastes like this."
"An interesting but flawed beer that is worth trying for the aroma. I'd like to try it with an English cheese if I get the chance, but I probably won't be seeking this one out."
"F: A bitterness washes over that's not as pleasant as the first bitterness. Not really sure what it is, perhaps the drying fruit flavor. The fruit is there as well but not as much. Its pretty dry too that goes along with thi bitterness. The hops are a spicy and dry astringent taste, perhaps thats the unpleasant part."
"Easy drinking."
"character that the nose led on. Light feel and low amount of carbonation. Very drinkable but the alcohol was a bit more pronounced than expected. The apricot addition is an interesting swing to the style. Regardless it blends well with a mix of alcohol and hop character which leaves an interesting mix of flavors left clinging on the tongue."
"Libation: I don't have a real opinion of apricots one way or another, so as a beer addition I'm kind of neutral. I liked the nose better than the flavor, but to me this is only a slightly above average beer. My only complaints is that bit too much of the apricot bitterness finds it's way into the aftertaste and that the alcohol is evident despite the relatively low ABV. A good beer, especially if you like apricots, but not a go-to IPA."
"D/O- Another tasty IPA from the guys at DFH. The apricot doesn't overpower any of the other aspects of this IPA. I could easily enjoy 2-3 of these beers before the alcohol became a problem. I will definitely purchase and drink this brew again. Cheers."
"D: This is a surprisingly good IPA. The underlying hops are not lost by the addition of the apricot, nor are the sweet fruit flavors overpowered by the bitter hops. A highly drinkable beer and another fine example of DFH's creative abilities."
"Yep, apricots. In the flavor profile the apricot flavor seems to rest in the malt, allowing a really nice flowery and fruity hop edge to come through and share the palate. Overall a nice aspect on a great style IMO. The apricots a little overdone but as far as a lot of fruit beers go, this is good."
"Overall, this is a tasty beer. Good, not great. I wouldn't buy these for myself, but I'll drink one when the GF picks them up."
"D: One of my favorites from DFH. Easy to drink for a 7%. More of an Apricot flavored Imperial Pale Ale IMO, When I think IPA I think Lots of Hops. Really pleasant though especially this time of year (late april)."
"D: Insanely drinkable. Definitely a beer you could drink a few of and not feel like you'd had a meal, but substantial enough @ 7.0 ABV to give you pause. Beware: friends wanting a sip might steal it from you!"
"Drinkability was great considering the pretty big 7% abv. I would have gotten another 22oz draft if I wasn't so stuffed from my huge burrito! Another fantastic make from Dogfish Head!"
"D-not creative and unique, they aren't pushing the envelope like they normally do; this is appricot in taste and a nice hoppy IPA. Smooth and easy drinking with enough bitterness to keep it an IPA and not a fruit beer"
"Overall: Very drinkable, and for a beer that's 7.0ABV, you'd never know that it packs a bit of a punch."
"Poured this one into a pint glass. I was not expecting much because I am not much of a fruit beer person. DFH converted me or at least made a damn good beer. The aroma has a strong apricot smell. I immediately was not happy. I tasted the beer next and it made up for everything. There was an incredible fresh hop taste. The apricot flavor was a accent to the overall great hop flavor. This beer is incredibly balanced. It is hard to place it into a category, but I must say it is a great IPA."
"Good spring/summer beer when you're looking for a change of pace. Not sure about some of the criticism of the apricot flavor (supposedly artificial), as it's pretty spot-on. I would rate this as slightly better than the Pyramid apricot brew."
"Drinkability: Pleasant taste, but not spectacular. An interesting experiment, and something I would have as a change of pace. The biggest problem is that DFH has better choices in the same category."
"D: Would this get a repeat attempt from me? Perhaps. But again, it reminds me a bit too much like a #9 IPA; slightly cloying. Not as much so as #9, but it's close."
"Dogfish head, this is very borderline."
"Honestly, my expectations were kind of low with this one, as I'm usually not impressed with experimental-type beers. I have to say, however, that this was one of the best beers I've had recently."
"D: Drinkable, but not the greatest thing DFH has ever produced."
"This is a little too thick and a little undercarbonated for me. I'm glad I got to try this, but I probably won't buy it again. I'll save my $ for other DFH brews!"
"Feel/Drink: Smooth, crisp and refreshing! This is a great beer with great drinkablity."
"D - Very tasty take on an IPA. Good beer for the Spring/Summer months."
"Overall, a very good beer by Dogfish Head. They've never disappointed me with any of their beers, and this is no exception."
"D: At 7%, I can't really call it a session beer, but the flavor definitely calls for another. Don't mind if I do."
"Also, I noticed that Gullifty's, where I often get various craft beers, seriously overdoes their glass disinfection. It added a chlorine tinge to everything I drank that night. This review submitted after trying at home."
"This is crisp and refreshing. Pretty easy to drink for the style and a unique take on a traditional IPA. This guy does everything good, but nothing great."
"Overall I went into this session expecting more from this. I was waiting for the apricots to shine through but unfortunately I wasn't finding much. It is still a nice IPA, but I was just a little disappointed in this brew."
"I would drink this again, although it doesn't blow me away."
"I will have again and I definated recomend this one."
"Overall, I really need to drink this beer again. My girlfriend's fridge is messed up, so this beer got way too cold. I may be editing or reviewing this again once I get around to drinking another of these. Not that this was bad, but I feel like it could/should be better. Of the DFH beers I've had, this may be my least favorite yet, but I don't think these guys can do wrong..."
"Pours a clear amber to copper. Nice head. Nice hop aroma. Spicy & floral notes. Tastes like a very good IPA but the apricot flavor appears to be missing. This is definitely a different recipe from last year as that batch seemed to have too much apricot and too little hops. Perhaps next year they can work on finding some middle ground? Even still, this is still a very solid IPA that I enjoy nonetheless. Could drink a bunch of these but I was expecting a lighter more fruity ale."
"Leaves hops on the tongue, nice beer, apricot flavor doesn't really make it any better than a normal ipa."
"A: Thick layer of heavy head, peach skin to copper in color, slight lacing visible on the side of the glass - 4.00, S: Strong apricot aroma mixed with a hearty dose of honeysuckle, pitted fruit sweetness and some solid citrus are also evident on the nose - 4.00, T: Hefty hop bite for a beer with only 30 IBUs, interesting mix of apricot and grapefruit, some caramel sweetness and pale malts - 4.00, M: Mildly velvety mouth feel - 4.25, D: A generally successful blend of IPA and fruit in a beer that I by and large enjoyed - 3.75"
"I'm not a fan of fruit beers or IPA's but for some reason this works together really well. It had a nice balance with a nice crisp bite. I picked up a four pack on a whim, with the plan to try one and probably not like and give the other three away. Those other three have found a spot in my frig and I'm not sharing."
"(d) Pretty good drinkability. I would recommend trying it paired with food."
"Another decent DFH beer that, while not a knockout has enough flavor and a high level of drinkability to warrant a repeat purchase."
"D: Wow. Very impressed with this brew. I'm having a hard time not drinking it (trying to cut down on beer consumption lately). Too bad it's not available in New Orleans or I'd be all over it."
"Pours a nice deep red color - nice and clear, you can tell there's fruit involved because no grain gets this color - hues of purple even. The head is huge and white, about 1 inch high, and leaves alright lacing. Looks good. The smell is nice, mostly fruit, the apricot - also some berry notes, like raspberries, but not a lot of hop. Actually, I'd venture to say that I don't really have an easy time smelling hops at all. Still, I guess it more or less smells like what it has in it. The taste is primarily sweet fruitiness mixed in with bitterness. It's really hard to detect anything else. I mean, the fruit is nice, but the bitterness sort of makes it unpleasant. You don't know which you prefer, and you end up wanting to ignore one or the other. Almost no hop flavor to speak of, maybe some tart lemony hops, maybe some leafiness, but you'd be stretching out the taste buds to find it. It also has the soda-y taste that fruit beers often have. The body is nice and medium, with decent lively carbonation. Not bad. Overall, a decent beer, but honestly, I would almost rather see a fruit beer alone, or an IPA alone. I don't think the bitterness and fruitiness complement each other well at all - for the most part, tasting bitter and fruit (other than citrus fruit really) together means that it's not quite ripe yet, and this brings to mind that very feeling you get when you bite into an underripe fleshy fruit. Doubt I would go back for more in the same night, but would maybe drink again, if given the opportunity."
"D-Drinks nice and easy, not the biggest fan of the apricot, but would definitely drink another one if seen on tap somewhere and I'm in the right mood."
"Drinkability: Refreshing and complex, two things that dont necessarily go well together but it works here. Big beer with refreshing summer/spring qualities that i am looking for."
"I don't know what to think of this beer really, I really don't"
"D- A larger improvement from years past when it was a thin weak mess with an odd sweetness. Now it is a solid ipa with hints of apricots and fruit. Much better. Thumbs up to Dogfish Head for listening to customer complaints and fixing the problem."
"Drinkability: One went down fine and it is a good spring seasonal, but for extended drinking it may be a tad cloying."
"This is without question the best apricot beer I've ever had. World class beer. DFH have found the perfect complimentary balance between the hops, malts, yeasts, and apricots. Poured with a good sized light tan foamy frothy head and good lace. Color is medium amber. Aroma is this crazy mix of hop and apricot that unify into a synthesis of a perfect flavor meld. Shazzam. Cant believe I said that. anyway, Flavor's the same but much larger. Body's great, ditto carbonation. Finish is medium in length with just a nod to the alcohol. Kudos to the maestro."
"On tap at Plan B. I had this in a bottle a while ago and it was disgusting. There was no date on the bottle but I assumed it was old. I was right!!! This was awesome on tap. Super Hoppy. Just a slight hint of apricot. This is like a magic hat number 9 on hop roids. Awesome beer. Really well balanced. I destroyed this pint and didn't even notice the alcohol. What a great beer."
"Pours orangey amber. Full white head stays . Fruity fuzzy peachy flower fragrance smell . Some fresh hops, mouthfeel mild smooth . Apricots of course are present ."
"Dr. Yep."
"Overall, this is one of the best fruit beers i've ever had. It is well balanced and not overly fruity, but the apricots add a good touch to a very good ipa. This is another good beer by Dogfish Head."
"ps please get this better distributed in Syracuse! I would load up the basement for sure"
"Availability: seasonal (March - May)"
"M/D: Good Mouth feel, very clean. This is a solid beer, but from DFH Id rather drink the 90 or 120."
"Quite a drinkable IPA, though the apricots don't really seem to show through on the palate or the nose, which is a bit disappointing though it really takes nothing away from the overall quality of the beer itself. Very good."
"D - Unique beer, definitely worth a try, but the apricot taste becomes a bit too strong for me towards the end of the drink. Not something that I will particularly seek out in the future."
"D: Very drinkable, not too strong the mouthfeel is good. I could put a few of these back."
"D: I get the sense this beer has a bad rap, and I'm not sure why. It's a tasty, easy drinking, different-without-being-insane IPA. Good job as usual, DFH."
"D- Very drinkable on a warm spring day. No alcohol flavor at all. Wonderfully hoppy and refreshing"
"D - One and done for me. This is the first Aprihop I've had in a couple of years, and now I remember why. This is an interesting, complex IPA, but Dogfish Head makes several others which I'd rather spend my $ on. It's certainly worth trying if you're a hophead; you very well may love it."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A very enjoyable spring Ipa. Will most likely purchase a 4-pack every year. It may not be an elite Ipa, but it's a darn good one."
"Overall= All in all I feel this beer, yet maybe not worth the high price, but it is a nice enjoyable beer to drink while sitting in the sun."
"D - was good to see this one re-done to the old recipe, as last year's was a complete mess. i am not a fan of fruit in beer, and apricots in general, so this isnt up my alley but pulled off well enough to make it decent in my eyes."
"D - Very drinkable. This is definitely a new favorite spring beer. Something to look forward to on a bright spring afternoon. The taste and aroma are appealing and pleasing."
" tonight I drink the bottle version and it is as good- great great spring beer, love the DFH IPAs and the seasonal spins therein- for me PUNK in the fall and now Aprihop in the spring. this beer says spring to me with a bite, bitterness, and body though great effervescne and great amber color make this truly spring in a glass with a hint of summer thrown in. A true winner again from Dogfish- If your're like me and stuck in your ways give this retooled beer another round and be enjoyably suprised. Great beer"
"Great seasonable brew. Perfect fruity IPA for the spring. This will be something to look forward to during the winter months."
"It's a pretty good beer. Not too malty, for sure. Definitely something different, but not just a science experiment. I like fruity IPAs, so this is sort of a natural progression of the fruity hops one sometimes gets from hops. This DFH is a winner."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"It is worth the time to try."
"I really didn't want to like this beer, but it is delicious. Pours a handsome copper with a decent fluffy head. The aroma is rich and fruity, musky and hoppy. The flavor is fruity but not sweet - musky, apricoty, with strong piny hops. There is a satisfying deep bitterness with a ripe fruit finish and a slight burn down the throat, like a good liqueur or brandy. The mouthfeel is smooth."
"d- very good hoppy and fruity ipa from dfh but the $12 4 pack price doesnt warrant an everyday beer for me."
"D- Definitely a beer I could drink many of, very refreshing and very drinkable."
"Perfect for April. Another wonderful DFH."
"wooowww. this beer is F@#$ing fantastic. pours a clear amber-copper color, the aroma of apricots and hops is fantasticly overwhelming. Not sure i'm going to find a beer i'll enjoy much more than this one. perfect for a sunny spring/summer day, but i could enjoy this beer year round no question about it. if you have never had the pleasure of enjoying this beer. i suggest you do so asap."
"Overall - I must admit I had a little trepidation going into this one. I couldn't envision the apricots joining together well with my idea of an IPA, but DFH pulled it off nicely. A very good, near perfect, spring beer; great for those first BBQs of the year."
"Yum thanks for the IPA!"
"D- a very light beer that I could drink a lot of, however, I don't believe I would choose to."
"D - At 7% abv, this one goes down nice and easy. Very drinkable spring/time and warmer weather beer!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice hoppy easy drinking beer with a twist. It was the perfect beer to sit outside with and enjoy the warm spring weather."
"Very nice when extremely fresh. Try it now!"
"D: Alcohol is well hidden and flavor is balanced, would be easy to go through a few pints of this in a sitting."
"Now this is a nice take on a fruit beer. Start out with a really nice IPA then add real fruit and everything balances out real well. Pours a nice light copper with a good white head. Aroma of hops and a hint of the apricots. Taste follows with a nice piney citrus hops, then at the end there is a nice hint of the sweet apricots. Its not a sicky sweet, just a kick of sweet to level out the bite of the hops. There is no indication of the 7%ABV so watch out as this is a super easy IPA to drink. A GREAT warm weather offering"
"Feel is pleasant and smooth, slightly sweet yet not too viscous. Fruity and light, the hops never find balance however. More of a Fruit Beer with a solid base than an IPA, and even more so on tap. Easy drinking nonetheless due to the aforementioned, yet not something to seek out."
"I can definitely see this being a session beer. At 7% it might catch up to you a lot faster than most other session beer."
"I try to review a product within the style. Aprihop is listed as an IPA. That being said, they also claim this has apricots in it. The head on this was apricot colored and that was the only indication of apricots I got. I will not seek out again and would advise against this one. There are better IPA's out there."
"D-Balanced and a nice change of pace. This is a good beer and if you haven't had it I would recommend it."
"D-very refreshing spring time beer that would probably be nice and sweet during the months of august and september, but for the march and april months it has a slight fruit sweetness with a bitter bite to balance it out"
"D: This beer wasn't quite as bad as I was expecting. While it was too sweet, it still had a fair amount of balance."
"D - Very clean flavors and goes down pretty easy. Recommended but hopefully they will up the Apricot flavors in the future."
"Taste - This definitely is an IPA with its hop bitterness being present but the sweet fruity apricot notes really helps to balance this beer. I was also surprised how smooth the overall flavor profile was."
"D- Overall a very interesting take on an IPA (although I would expect no less from DFH). I would definitely try this again."
"Decent drinkability. Unique and solid all around. I'll have another one or two of these."
"pours a copper color with a beige ring and some good sticky lacing it looked really fresh and was bottled about 3 weeks ago..the smell was musty earthy and malty..the taste however was much better i get a nice hop blast with a with a smooth malt presence there is some bread grain taste and just the right amount of apricot/fruit in the background..DFH does a nice job of balancing fruit hops malt in this one ..a little pricey but i enjoy this one from time 2 time in the spring..recommended"
"Nothing special."
"D- Good to have some signs of spring, one of them being this beer. I am one of the few dudes that will openly admit I enjoy fruit beers (non sours that is). I think this is an especially good beer to bust out for ""non-beer drinkers"" or ""I don't like bitter beer"" peeps. For me, I enjoy the hoppiness and the subtle, but unmistakeable fruitiness. PS I have never been a wine cooler guy, in case anyone was wondering."
"D- Smooth, with no trace of the alcohol. I am not sure how to classify this. It isn't really something I would drink when in the mood for an IPA. The other apricot beer I have tried is Pyramid's Apricotweizen which I think I prefer over the Dogfish only because the apricot pairs so well with the wheat in the Pyramid brew. This was a good beer, though. I will enjoy the rest of the 4 pack, but probably won't go back for another."
"For a fruit beer this is pretty good, although it is a style I haven't really explored much. As an IPA, on the other hand, it is going to rate lower."
" Mouthfeel is really full, little bubbles on your tongue and an almost instant beer foam feeling. It's a little more carbonated than I prefer, but good."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. Not a bad IPA for both the price and flavor. Granted it is no PtE nor other D/IPA's I really enjoy such as Nelson, but a great change up nonetheless. I'm glad I picked this up today and will for sure pick up a four pack of this every year from now on."
"Better than I was thinking with this. The apricot really balances out the sharp hops."
"Dogfish Aprihop poured a amber color, witht he perfect head, an absoulte picture perfect looking beer, it had a strong hoppy and apricot smell to it, however the taste was horrible, the apricot was just wayyy too overpowerfully, and it just did not mix in well with the hops, and it is a hoppy beer, I found it really hard to drink one, a rare disapointment from Dogfish Head."
"Really glad I picked this up for a try again. Very nice and one I'll visit again. Strange, but I really like it."
"I've had this before in the past, and I've always thought it's a solid brew from DFH. If you like an IPA with a good balance of hops and malts, this is a fine example. The apricots add just enough without making this beer too sweet or cloying."
"I would prefer a #9 over this which is only fair in comparison sake due to the presence of apricot."
"D- I like this beer and definately want to grab another as the glass winds down. I suspect that many would not buy this beer because there is fruit in the name, but don't pass it by- the hops balance out any sweetness from the fruit and marry very well to create a unique IPA."
"Great light syrupy feel with crisp hop/fruit/citrus flavor make it extremely easy to drink."
"Bottled 2/19/10."
"12oz. bottle served in a SA perfect pint glass. Poured a brilliant clear amber with a finger of off white head. Citrusy hop aroma along with the apricot. Lighter sided of medium bodied. More citrus and apricot in the flavor. Not as bitter as the aroma would suggest. Hops are a little ""green"" for my taste. Kind of piney. Fairly dry finish."
"D: Very drinkable -- not your typical fruit beer"
"This is another enjoyable and unusual offering from the good folks at Dogfish Head."
"Drinkability: very drinkable, good refreshing beer, diffidently worth trying. I will be getting more of this one."
"The fruit doesn't take over, but it only adds to the hops to make a well-crafted, highly drinkable, yet bitter beer. Not your ""introductory"" fruity beer, but much, much better. Much better than I remember from last year (don't know if its the recipe or my palate, but I would assume the latter.)"
"Drinkability: Dangerously so. At 7% ABV this is not beer for chugging, but it goes down very easily, . Made me sad I had no blue cheese in the house!"
"Pours a great, well, apricot color, good thick head great lacing. Noticeable aroma, just the right fruit amount in the taste and nose. Good hop profile too. So much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Mouthfeel, sticks with it down to the end of the bottle. Drinkable, but like all DFH, its pricey."
"2010 bottling! I'm so glad they went back to the old recipe on this one. I enjoyed these tremendously in the previous years but the 09 version was a mess. Hard pour produces burnt orange with an off white 1"" head. There is a fair amount of lacing remaining along with some thick carbonation bubbles resting on the top. From my wide duvel snifter, I detect sweeet toffee, light malt and a sugary fruity hop presence. I would not have known this was apricot, but some fruit apparent. This tastes very smooth, sweet and mellow up front with a medium heavy slightly silky mouthfeel. The bitter hops and alcohol are both pronounced in the finish. This is like welcoming back an old friend and I will be seeking out another 4 pack or two for the spring!"
"This is quite an interesting beer. This one is pretty drinkable stuff."
"D - I would have another.. if someone had this at their summer picnic i'd be in heaven probably. it is not my first choice. i think it is a good beer.. very easy to drink and great for a summer day but there are so many good ipa's out there i'm sorry this one falls more around a B+ for me..."
"Overall it's a well-rounded, well-constructed American IPA but I would love to see an imperial version of this - maybe more malt, more apricot. Regardless, Dogfish keeps true to the IPA form while throwing in a little something extra with this brew. Props to Sam for successfully pulling off another off-centered creation!"
"Drinkability: While this will not become my regular IPA I did enjoy it and could have a second without much arm twisting. Each sip led naturally into the next and there was nothing forced in drinking this one."
"Notes: 60 Minute meets Festina Peche? Not really, although there is some of that here. All in all it is nice but not particularly remarkable. Good IPA with a subtle touch of peach. In that gentle profile it works pretty well but I wonder if the peaches were lacking in flavor this season..."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a finger of foamy ecru head that leaves almost no lacing behind at all. The nose is loaded with hoppy citrus, apricots, and...well, that's pretty much it. The taste generally follows, with those hops coming through strongly, the apricots a bit more subtlely, and the addition of some greenery and peaches. The body is firmly moderate, with appropriately moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish, leading to a pretty high drinkability when all is said 'n' done."
"Overall, a very enjoyable and exciting beer, as it combines fruit beers with extremely hoppy IPAs. Definitely a very ambitious brew."
"drinkability: I can easily drink this brew since it is a laid back IPA. Another Dogfish Head with a subtle 7%. My kind of IPA. I was glad to find this on draft and I will be grabbing 4 packs when I see them."
"Salud!"
"Dark red topped with off white head. Aroma of fresh hops, greens, grapes, light fruit. Tastes of hops, apricot, fruit, peaches. A medium-heavy bodied brew that is has some refreshingly light flavors. A good take on the IPA style and a great balance of hops and fruit notes."
"D- Not the best DFH but a solid, refreshing beer for sure. This has me ready for summer beers."
"Feel is just thick enough to balance the hops."
"D - Overall, this is one of the best AIPA's that i've had to date. i really like the apricot thing. it's a great spring/early summer beer. very balanced, and quite drinkable. complex enough to milk it, but balanced enough to have a couple rounds."
"d - Overall this was an interesting IPA. I was eager to try it after hearing good things, even though apricots aren't one of my favorite fruits. I thought they captured the apricot smell and taste very well, but halfway through a pint I felt I had had enough. If you like apricots I would definitely check this out, but if you aren't crazy about them, I might give this a pass."
"This beer is insanely drinkable. I rarely spend a night drinking the same thing throughout, but this one just might make the cut. 12 ounces isn't going to be enough. The 4-pack in my fridge should probably fear for its life."
"D - I think the apricots sweet/tart qualities blend very nicely with the hop flavors in this brew. Maintains a solid balance and is very drinkable for the 7% abv. A good beer for the transition to spring and warmer weather."
"Light body and an airy, crisp feel. Very clean flavors makes for a very drinkable beer. Great balance of flavor; it's not overly fruity, hoppy, or bitter."
"The mouthfeel is light to medium, the flavors are crisp and the beer is well carbonated. The beer is not hoppy or bitter enough to be an IPA, too much malt and fruit flavor."
"I personally would pay this one the complement of ""unique and drinkable"" more than the typical ""extreme"" experiment from Rhode Island."
"Overall, this is a very confusing bland IPA that I would not suggest."
"Dogfish Head has some of my favorite brews so I am somewhat biased towards any of their offerings. I had to give this one a try, since it was out there with the apricots -hops mix. To me it had an unusual taste and I could not pick up on an apricot smell or flavor. The hops apricot mix seemed to work against each other. It has this odd aftertaste that reminds me a bit of drinking a Bud Lime, or the taste of sweet tarts candy. Anyway Kudos to Dogfish for giving it a whirl. I wouldn't turn one down, but believe if I'm buying I'll stick to some of their other offerings."
"very high drinkability! kind of reminded me of Magic Hat's #9"
"Amber body, white head. Hops and apricots all in one place! A good balance on the aroma of both. Taste is apricots and hops with a nice bitter-sweet finish. Sweetness in the finish seems a little unbalanced compared to the rest of the beer. Overall good."
"Pours a nice orangish copper color with some hints of red in it. There is very little for a head maybe one finger which settles quickly and gives way to minimal lacing. The aroma has a caramel malt backbone to it, which is covered by the apricot smell and maybe some other light fruits. The taste is of a caramel backbone with a nice ripe apricot taste over the top and a slightly bitter earth hop bite. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation and is crisp. The drinkability is very high on this, it is a very drinkable beer, crisp smooth and refreshing."
"D- A very drinkable beer allowing for a unique fruit/hop experience. This would be great as a meat dinner paring."
"When I picked this up I wasn't expecting a Pyramid Apricot, but I was expecting something sweet, this was something unexpected. This is a good IPA but with a sour tinge. Color was a deep amber, I didn't get much of a smell. The taste and mouthfeel is where this beer set's itself apart. It has an overpowering sour flavor with a malty finish. The mouthfeel is a tart finish. This is a solid beer, but I couldn't have a 4-pack back to back. A very complex beer showing DogFish's skill at coming up with something out of the ordinary."
"O: Good beer. This is my first Dogfish Head brew and I am impressed. I picked this up because it sounded ""out-there"" but I was pleasantly surprised by how well it drank."
"When I first cracked this fine brew open I noticed it poured a slightly darker color than an average IPA. Not much of a head and no lacing down the sides at all. As far as taste goes, it's a little no heavy on the apricots. I realize it is an apricot beer but the taste was syrupy. Really sweet and it kinda keeps the hops hidden. I appreciate Dogfish Heads ventures into the new and unexplored but this one just wasn't for me. Very glad i got to try it though."
"I will pass on it if I see it agin."
"The whole thing is rather slick on the tongue, felt like there was lots of carbonation on the back of my tongue."
"D- Fairly drinkable the only thing that bugs me is the metallic (for lack of a better word) taste."
"Crisp sweet light fruit with a caramel malt backbone and a nice bitter earthy hop balance. Pretty sweet with lots of apricot, apple and pear. Very crisp but slightly watered down with a dry piny earthy hop finish."
"D: Refreshing."
"D- A fruity spritzer of a beer. Not bad but not something I could drink a whole lot of. More of a fruit beer not ipa, but by all means worth a try."
"It's a bit dry for my liking but drinks brilliantly anyway. I'm sure I'll be drinking this one through the many summers to come."
"Beer #2 in my week of DFH. Poured a clear, golden yellow with 1 finger of creamy head. This beer has a very unique smell that I'm having trouble placing, but the apricot isn't overpowering, which is a plus. The uniqueness continues upon tasting. There is a hit of bitterness quickly followed by sweetness, no doubt from the apricot and then the two tastes mix in your mouth. The body is a bit thin and watery the sweetness wins out in the finish. This is an interesting take on an IPA with a unique play on flavor, but I don't really care for it. Doubt I would have it again."
"Drinkability: At 7% ABV, this beer definitely hides the alcohol well. This will definitely be a beer to consider for future summers (provided DFH increases their distribution circles). The stickiness could be off-putting, but it is balanced very well by the sweetness and the slight bitterness of the hops, and it rounds this beer out nicely."
"d: this is like the 60 min but better. I want this all year round. can't wait for next spring!"
"Poured a dark amber with a modest head that quickly evaporated to nothing. The aroma was a little sweetish. The taste was sour fruits, could not find any sweetness promised by the aroma. The feed was medium bodied with a small amount of carbonation. Drinkability depends a lot on your own opinion of a sour beer. Mine is just ""OK""."
"Drinkability: I would have this again and surprisingly enough the alcohol isn't that apparent."
"A very balanced and well made fruit-infused beer. I'd have another if I could."
"D- sadly, i expected more from this one. 'a fruit beer for hop heads' does not really apply. it's just a mild pale ale with apricots in it. it's decent, but all in all, i won't be chasing after another one."
"D - Interesting, but not a session for me."
"Mood, I guess. The sweet apricot and citrus backbone of this IPA are interesting together. I'd like to try this one when it's really fresh."
"O - This a very approachable experimental beer. The apricot flavor could have been a bit stronger but all around it's a good beer."
"Very enjoyable and easy to drink. Balanced through out with no one characteristic becoming too dominate. Very good beer."
"Overall, I feel this is a very good brew. I am thoroughly impressed. This is one of the better brews I've drank recently."
"Interesting concept, but ultimately I'd rather have most of the other DFH beers instead."
"Pours a brilliant, orange copper with a small white head that lasts to the last of the glass. It smells awesome. The apricots mix nicely with the hops. I was skeptical at first, but it was well thought out and balances nicely. Taste is as you'd expect from the aroma. It's on the sweet side for sure, but tastes great. The point where this beer falls apart is in the drinkability. Maybe if it were a little drier, then I'd see myself having a few glasses, but as it is I couldn't even finish one bottle. It's a splitter, but well worth a taste."
"Just like the Festina Peche, Aprihop is an interesting twist on a style, but not for everyone. Nice to try, but not one I would drink on a regular basis."
"Perhaps I set the bar low or was just blown away but I really enjoyed this beer. I still prefer the 90-minute but I would buy this again."
"The appearance is a light amber color with a one finger head. It looks good enough to drink. The smell has notes of apricot, hops, some sugar. After taking a sip, I would say that the taste of fruit is not overwhelming by any means, the hops are there, some maltiness, a nice taste, really. Mouthfeel is of apricots, hops, some sweetness, but a refreshing feeling overall left on your palate. Drinkability is above average, this is a great ""fruit beer"". DFH has a lot of very good and interesting beers and this is one of them, check this one out if you have not already done so."
"D: Easy to drink but not a great value. It tastes a bit too much like Magic Hat #9 to recommend it -- Aprihop is much more substantially malted for certain, but the overall effect is not much different."
"Pours a very light straw yellow with a thick creamy white frothy head. The smell is yeasty up front with some apricot and hop smell, neither over powering, and suprisingly not as heavy as I thought. Taste is very similar to the smell, starts very yeasty and doughy, with the not very sweet apricot flavor following with a hop finish followed with a hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and light, refreshing and perfect for the summer. This one is very drinkable, but disappointing in the hop department, not IPA material. Yet the fruit isn't too sweet or overpowering, the hops do not dominate, a nicely balanced beer. Worth checking out."
"D: Not enough apricot for an apricot beer, not enough hops for an IPA"
"Pours a beautiful golden amber with very nice but modest foam. Nose is big on apricot, a bit of citrus, and some caramelly malts. Medium bodied, the beer is very well carbonated, even a bit more than I would have expected. Taste is pretty bittersweet with apricot up front, almost a bit tart. The fruit comes through very strongly but the character of the beer hasn't been lost. It is a bit tough to tell that this is an IPA at heart, but the bitterness is there in the finish. With that said, I think I would lean toward categorizing this more as a hefty fruit beer than an American IPA. This beer is very easy to drink especially for a fairly high alcohol content, although I think I'll definitely need to be in the mood for it. A great achievement in brewing, but not for all occasions in my mind."
"On the 4 pack carrier it's stated perfectly: ""A fruit beer for hop heads..."""
"Pours dark amber with a smallish off-white head. Little lacing, decent retention. Aroma is very fruity, lots of citrus and tropical fruits with the obvious apricot note. Flavor is pale and caramel malt with cloying apricot jam and a dry, grassy finish. Slight caraway accent? Nice standard IPA palate with a light bitterness. Too sweet for me."
"I love IPA's and even like fruit beers more than the average bear.. but I just couldn't dig this one at all. One of the first DFH beers I had trouble finishing, as I really like a lot of their other stuff. Just way too bitter and sweet for me.. its like as you drink it a sour apple lollipop is jammed into your throat and it just makes you pucker up. Very light bodied too so it kind of just slides right over the tongue without much time to appreciate any other flavor.. all your left with is sourness. Thought I'd enjoy this a lot.. I was wrong, but hey we can't be pleased all the time, DFH lost me on this one!"
"CHEERS!"
"12 oz bottle Pours a hazy golden color with a big creamy off white head that lasts very well. Aroma has good points of malt and the appricot isn't too strong. Also get alittle cookies and pine. Has a creamy texture and a full body. Light on carbonation. Has a sweet alcohol finish. This one is a touch on the heavy side. A little differnt but a good fun beer. I probally wouldn't drink it every day but its a nice change of pace."
"One of the better fruit beers i've had. The light malts and hops went well with the apricots. I feel like it could've been pushed further. But it was very drinkable and refreshing."
"D- Nothing special as the dry finish and strange taste kind of takes it away from me."
"We had this at the Hopleaf in Chicago. I am not sure what to make of this beer. I was anxious to try it out but cannot really say what it is or isn't. It wasn't bad, just not in the taste range I like. It was not overly sweet - more like a tart apple perhaps. Good body and you could taste the hops but the fruitiness reigned. May have to try it again."
"This beer is pretty blah, weird at best. Don't know what to really make of it. No characteristics and tastes like a good beer gone bad. I love Dogfish beers, but this one didn't do it for me or my friends. We really just expected more from this beer."
"Didn't get it. Too complex for me? Probably b/c this just didn't add up. Appearance - nice amber, copper color. Head dies a bit quickly but still strings of carbonation piercing through. Like the looks going in. Smell - smells great...wow! Caramel, brown sugar, granny smith apples, raisins, maybe a bit of lemon...all over the place...interesting. Taste - wow was right...buzz kill. Fast taste then vanishes. Bitter crab apple aftertaste. None of the richness that thought would get from the nose is there. Sorry, but dissappointing."
"Quick review: Aromas of sour apricots, sour peach and pilsner-like funky hops. Palate is crisp with tart acidity and flavors of sour white peach, sour apricot and some hop oil. There's some of that sweet-tart sugar content there, and a little biscuit-esque malt character trying to sneak in underneath the quick drying out of the hop leaves. Solid. Better interpretation of apricot beer than that ""other"" one (i.e. real fruit)."
"Overall, this beer is fairly drinkable but the taste is a significant hindrance. The tartness just overwhelmed the flavor and made it difficult. My wife did not like a brief tasting, at all and did not want to taste anymore."
"D: Highly drinkable beer, one of the more approachable offerings from Dogfish Head. I'm usually not a big fan of fruit beers, but this one is packed with flavor. I look forward to this one every year."
"Well-crafted, yet enigmatic."
"I actually liked this, despite the fact it was a fruity beer. There's enough IPA-ness to make it drinkable for my tastes. Dogfish Head always does a nice job and this beer is no exception."
"Taste is just great, starts off with a pretty classic dogfish head IPA, good ammount of hops and really drinkable but once it's down you can taste all the lingering fruit and let me say, the burp on this thing is where the apricot comes in, because while its drinking it tends to exude much more oranges and peach than its namesake but that post-bottle belch just forces the ""shit that was a lot of apricot"" it's probably not gonna be your ""go to beer"" but one or two (or three) when it's hot out, great choice. There's a little bit of tartness that builds up as the glass empties so i'd say its both a great characteristic and a flaw beause it can be ""too"" much, but all in all, a great selection from an off-centered ale"
"In all, it's something you must try if you get the chance... just to see for yourself. Look for it at ACBF, apparently."
"First thing you notice is a sourness, followed by warming alcohol, turning into a dry bitterness on your tongue."
"D- Surprisngly I liked it. I felt it was a bit under hopped to be considered an IPA, but I wonder if adding more hops would have overpowered the apricot flavor. I did the the light hoppiness and apricots went together quite nicely. Check this beer out it sure is interesting."
"Drinks very smooth, a nice IPA/fruit combo."
"I guess I'm not really sure where the guys at Dogfish Head were going with this one. I have heard that it has become less and less hoppy every year....at this point I don't believe ApriHop is an appropriate name, the hops are no longer, there is some decent fresh sour apricot...but no hops to speak of. The appearance and the mouthfeel may be this beer's saving graces, but this is no IPA...I'm not impressed at all, but I appreciate the creativity."
"Aroma is, well, apricots. Gentle sweetness. Nice malts. Then we sip this beer of high renoun... what is this? Unripe fruit? Weeds gathered up and thrown in for fun? Organic (yeasty) funk? It's obviously got the fruit flavor, spot on there, but it really seems like the fruit and the hops are just fighting each other for my palate's attention. And my palate is the loser of the battle. Can't get my arms (or lips, or tongue for that matter) around this one. I appreciate creativity, but I'll give this one a miss."
"Pours a clear deep golden color reddish/orange hues, with a thinnish off white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of apricots, sulfur, hay or grass, not very remarkable. Taste is a little sweet, tart and fruity, but not much IPA here. Leaves a tart fruity almost caramel taste on my tongue. Medium high level of carbonation, slick/sticky mouthfeel, medium body. 7% alcohol is well hidden. Nothing offensive here, but it doesn't work for me. Maybe apricots aren't my favorite fruit, but I was reeled in with the serious IPA pitch, and IPA this ain't."
"Would definitely drink again, but will not hoard it or go out of my way to find it."
"D: Not too impressed with this one. The tartness of the apricot seemingly kills any hop flavor or aroma. Disappointing since it is advertised as a serious IPA. Glad that I tried it, but now I have 3 more to give away..."
"Pours a clear bronze with two fingers of off white foam. Fizzy head drops quickly to a thin sheet. Nose has some apricot and metal, hints of earthiness and and grassy hop. Very acidic up front, middle is chalky and quite dry, and finished with a mild bitterness. Apricot flavour is subdued and the hops are overwhelmed by the tartness. This one isn't working for me."
"Yet another beer with fruit added to it that I do not enjoy."
"A very drinkable brew. Undoubtedly odd, but assuredly enjoyable."
"Something very different and quite refreshing, if you see this around, pick up a 4-pack on a nice hot day."
"Extremely carbonated. Apricots really come through. Too fruity for my taste. Kind of upset my stomach."
"I have always been a big #9 fan, as I like beers with interesting flavors and twists on more common styles, but in all honestly, this blows it out of the water. Compared to #9, this is a heavier, more substantive beer (aprihop is truer to the IPA style). Highly recommended."
"The base beer needs some real work. :|"
"D- Overall a good beer to have but more than 2 and the sourness would get to a person and it might hinder from drinking a sixer on the weekend."
"[1x]"
"With that said, I would drink it again, but i wount go out of my way for it, and 'it' being this years batch. I keep reading that the flavor profile of this beer has been changing from year to year and I look forward to next years batch to see if there are any changes."
"D: I was surprised by this and rathe enjoyed it. I don't usually like fruity beers, but for some reason I enjoy ones with apricot flavor. Good refreshing beer."
"This IPA is very impressive and i am astounded that the bitterness is so apparent but then so immediately diffused. Truly a medium between bitter and sweet for beer drinkers to embark on into the journey of IPA world. Thank you dogfish head."
"Pours a light copper color that has a light orange glow towards the bottom of the glass with a one inch white head. The beer has an obvious apricot aroma with some other citrus flavors and just a hint of caramel malt. Apricots dominate the flavor as well. Its soft upfront and leaves a bitterness in the end. I noticed some lemon zest bitterness in the middle as well. Its a light-medium bodied beer that is a bit slick but definitely easy to drink. I actually found this beer to be pretty enjoyable. Its not overly fruity which I was worried about."
"D: It's a decent and unique IPA. I would pass this on to my roommate who is obsessed with them. He wouldn't be disappointed with this. I would only have a couple because I'm sure the 7.00% ABV would catch up to me eventually."
"Easy to drink, but wouldnt want too too many. Although this is not a sweet beer, the slight apricot taste may wear on me."
"This isn't an IPA, unless tart is the ""new"" bitter. I like it as it is... but it ain't an IPA. If I rated completely to style this beer would bomb... but I still think it's interesting and worth a go so I didn't rate any category lower than 3. It would do better as a fruit beer. And then it would do even better if the apricot was more obvious."
"D: This was a solid beer. Nothing really jumped out at me, but at the same time it wasn't bad. I really would have liked a bit more hop character and maybe a tad more apricot. Also the beer was a little too light bodied for me. I understand that this year wasn't represenative for this beer. I'll definitely try it again, but I'm waiting until next year."
"The taste is pretty much bad. There is weird sourness and a cloying metal taste. There is practically no hop presence at all. Also there is absolutely no lacing and no hops! What kind of an ipa is this supposed to be. A bad excuse for a beer."
"Aroma is a very pleasant hoppy ale smell, citrus and pine hop notes, with a strong dose of apricot. Nice smell. Reading older reviews of this beer I wonder if they have ramped up the apricot over the years...this is a very pleasant IPA but I think the sour apricot is just a touch too much, tipping the balance towards a fruit-gimmick at the expense of the solidly good beer at the base. I like it, but would choose a 60-minute IPA rather than goback to this. Mouthfeel is good, drinkability OK."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a really nice copper color with a one finger head that quickly goes away. Surprisingly some lacing but not much. The smell is citrus and fruity, not very hoppy. The taste is sour, citrusy, and fruity. Once again not very hoppy which is strange for an IPA. I'm not huge on the taste but appreciating the style and what they're trying to accomplish it's good, apricot just isn't my thing I guess. I shared this with a few other people and they seemed to like it so I guess it's not for me. Overall it's not bad, I can drink it no problem and it actually goes down pretty smooth. But as an IPA fan I'll be sticking to Dogfish Head's other IPAs."
"Drink is not to good for me,a little overdone for my tastes,I almost pulled a drainpour with this one."
"What a great beer this would be for a summer afternoon. Light, crisp and refreshing. This is what I would like to be stocked up on for my 'lawnmower beer'."
"D: strong apricot takes away from drinkability."
"Tart again, but hides the 7% ABV pretty well for such a thin beer. Finish is weak and racing to be crisp."
"Excellent on a hot summer day!"
"12 oz bottle purchased at the Beer Stop for $1.75. Poured into my shaker glass and appears a clear bright amber color with about a finger of cream colored foam. Very fresh aroma with notes of fruity apricots, faint grassy hops, and bread. Tastes of tart dried apricots, sourdough bread, toasted, sweet malt, mild bitter hops. The hops seem rather subdued for an IPA and the apricot flavor is not at all overpowering. Medium in both body and carbonation. This beer does not drink like it is 7%, so a few of them could sneak up on you."
"D. Interesting beer. Not what I was expecting. Bares little resemblance to any kind of IPA. Not the best or worst fruit beer I have had."
"D - I really liked this beer, very drinkable and refreshing, something different in the world of highly hopped IPAs, which are good, but a different take on the style, for me, is always welcome"
"I would love to have had this in previous years cause it seems like it has done very well in them. I noticed the grades are way down this year."
"Mouth is medium and slightly oily. I really don't see myself getting anymore. just a sub-par beer."
"12oz. Poured a tangerine orange color with a thin off-white head that left a slight lacing on the glass. Aroma was mainly apricot with trace floral hops - I expected more. Taste was odd at first - apricot, alcohol, sour notes, slight malt character, slight hop bitterness. I am still not too sure what to think of this one. Maybe it needed to age a little bit - too fresh? It seemed like something was off and the flavors were lacking. I expected better from Dogfish Head."
"Final Note: Let me finish by saying that I really want to love this beer. I truly respect Sam and his crew and I will continue to buy up their great beers but I can't say I truly love this one. I know some people will love this beer, but I'll stick to 90 minute, 120 minute, and Black and Blue!"
"I need another one that's fresher to fairly evaluate this one."
"Pours a nice bronze color. Somewhat thin head surprisingly leaves some nice lacing. Smells slightly of apricots, with a sweet malty aroma that is sort of unusual but nice. I thought it tasted delicious. Had a hint of apricots in every sip but never overdid it. The balance of the hops found in just about every Dogfish Head beer worked very well with the apricots. Has a bit more carbonation than I would prefer, but not so much that it put me off. I had one of these and would probably drink one or two more before I would rather move on to something else. If you're having just one, this is one I'll choose fairly often."
"Cheers!!!"
"not drinkable imo - but i bought a four pack and the 1st to the last now it has not changed - glad i tried it but never again"
"Overall, I like it for what it is. Will i buy a half rack tomorrow? no. Would i drink six of them if asked to? yes. Not my favorite beer ever, but ive got to respect how well they've balanced the IPA and fruit profiles of this beer. Not an easy task and it is pretty well done with this one. If ""melding"" were a category, this one would get a 4.5 in said category. Give it a shot, a unique and interesing beer."
"D: The 7% alcohol is hidden very well, but I just didn't like the taste. I'm happy that I only bought a single 12 oz. because I doubt I will ever buy this again."
"EDIT: Is this brew supposed to be sour???"
"D- An interesting brew that goes down easy and really refreshing."
"Overall very unimpressed. It may be just that it's old-bottled 2/27/08, a year ago. I'll have to give a fresh one a go."
"M/D - decent carbonation and mouthfeel, it goes down pretty smoothly and quickly, but the taste is leaving me not wanting another for awhile."
"D- I only bought a single bottle, however I could see myself drinking many of these beers. Its not too strong and has good taste."
"DFH is a wonderful brewery, because although they sometimes swing and miss, they are constantly taking creative chances. Aprihop is the one-and-only fruit beer I've enjoyed, and that's because at its heart, it's an IPA. I drank this beer at one of my favorite places and it ensured that there was nowhere else I would rather have been."
"The aroma on this one is a slight stank from the hops and the fruityness of apricots. The flavor is not very bitter, but bitter enough to be an IPA. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. The finish is clean. Very carbonated, very foamy. But not horrible."
"Tastes like a Magic Hat #9 gone awry."
"uh, I understand the pitch here. they have succeeded in making a fruit beer. fruit first. but, as a beer, as an ipa as they say on the bottle, it fails. very little actual hop, malt, complexity etc. and that's okay if you are looking for a wine cooler. but I was looking for a beer."
"Drinkability is okay. The beer is fairly refreshing, but it yearns for identity--is it an IPA or a fruit beer? I've read about the recent recipe change (and talk of going back to the original), so this is literally a beverage without a definite identity. This one's fresh--bottled in 2/09--but I'd agree that this recipe needs some tweaking."
"Poured a clear copper/amber color. Head was about a finger and a half, but quickly became just a thin covering over the brew. I got a scent of dried apricots covering citrusy hops. This was accompanied by a hint of sweet malts. The smells seemed pretty restrained. Apricot and hops are the first tastes, but I found them to be a little weaker than I was hoping for. I really dug the sour apricot taste that finished each drink. I've heard some people complain about this, but I actually found it to be a highlight. I can't comment on this season being different from that, as this is the first time I've had this beer. Overall, I thought found this to be a pretty solid beer."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch of creamy head. I took a big whiff and got the floral aroma of hops with a hint of the apricot. The apricot taste is sneaky. I didn't get it at first but it slowly worked its way onto my tastebuds. It is subtle. It tastes a bit sour. Overall, not bad but I do not see myself sitting around drinking it all day. It's worth a try."
"Poured bright red into a stein, the only glassware available during the kitchen renovation. Initially has a thick eggshell-colored head, but slowly dissipates to a thin cap, with wispy lacing throughout the drink. Aroma is... well I am not quite sure what apricot smells like, but if I had to guess this would be it. Fruit, some spiciness, and of course some citrusy hop aroma. Mouthfeel is standard, medium-light body with some refreshing carbonation. Taste took me aback, and initially I did not know what to think - not unlike my first tasting of Festina Peche. Sour, orangey, with what I perceive to be an unrecognizable fruit flavor which I will take as apricot. Whatever it is, I like it. I find it quite sour in the middle. Finish dry with a tinge of hop bitterness and lingering sourness. Drinkability is very high, as the 7% ABV is completely covered up by the sweet and sour flavor. Overall, this is a great brew, although unusual. I knew what I was getting in to."
"Until you're 3 in the hole of course."
"D- I think I could easily drink a few of these. The first thing I thought of after my first sip was Magic Hat #9 only bigger."
"Overall: A good beer for the girlfriend. I liked it but 10 bucks a four-pack is a rip-off."
"Fruit beers are generally not my thing and this beer is no exception. However, this is still a well made beer."
"The nose is full of apricots and spicy citrus hops, and the taste is even more of both, in a very very good way--moving from a little toasted malt through the apricot juice and finishing with the spicy hops. It's got a nice carbonation and tastes clean and crisp, and I thought it was highly drinkable--would absolutely buy again."
"Reddish orange with a mousse like head of cream colored foam that leaves fine lace on the glass. Smells of apricot and steely hops and faintly of roasted malt. Much bigger flavors than the nose suggests, Bitter fruity hops with malt struggling to get through to balance. Definately apricot heavy. Medium slippery mouthfeel with crisp carbonation that adds to the drinkability."
"Future outlook: Interesting drink. I like apricots, and this captured their essence in beer form fairly well. I would think that if you don't care for apricots, don't bother. Not any sort of a craver or go-to seasonal, but I can see getting another single of this at some point, or looking to find some food pairings."
"not really huge on this. a very noble attempt with this but i dont think that my palate is ready for this. but definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: It's a beer worth trying, but I don't think I'd pick it up again unless I went to one of their ale houses on the east coast."
"I have to say, compared to other Dogfishhead beers I was very underwhelmed. I was expecting more from this beer, especially in terms of body. Worth trying, but I won't be buying another for some time."
"First time with the fruit/IPA. Pours clear orange with a big foamy white head. Moderate lacing. Fresh apricots mixed with slightly piney hops and light caramel in the nose. Light, medium-carbonated mouthfeel. Fresh citrus and mild pine hops up front complimented nicely with the apricots which burst through in the middle. The malt is much lighter than expected, and lets the apricot taste come through without making it too sweet or sticky. Earthy, fruity finish that's not too long. Very refreshing."
"D - alcohol is masked completely, as a beer with fruit additions it certainly stands out in having a good 2 or 3 abv more than the average fruit beer, however it is also multidimensional in its taste and therefore could be enjoyed one after another"
"Dogfish hop's Aprihop, in bottle. A clear dark amber brew with a wispy head that managed to leave respectable lacing. Lots of fruit in the nose, apricots that is, along with some hops and caramel. Medium on the palate and bursting with apricot flavor. Toasted malt is discernible upfront. It is followed by a big juicy apricot flavor in the center. The hops see this thing out with a little spice. Not a bad brew....if you like apricots."
"D- Very drinkable by itself or with a wide selection of food, like most pale ale"
"D - So so, I guess if I had other bad things to choose from I'd go for this, but would rather have a 90minute."
"D - A tart and refreshing take on the American IPA. I wouldn't consider it a go-to beer, but it's very nice for a warm spring day."
"D: I don't get this beer. I just don't see it being considered a APA as it is noticeably devoid of hops, but, there is little in the way of malts either. Really just a lot of lemon essence and sour twanginess. If I wasn't in a bar and hadn't just paid $6 for it, I most likely would have been pouring this one down the drain. I wonder if this batch was bad, or the keg near empty or something, anything to explain this beer."
"D: A tasty and easy to drink brew. I would probably classify this one in the fruit beer category rather than IPA but we all know that DFH beers are impossible to place in a category."
"This beer isn't all that hoppy or apricoty."
"M/D - Too fizzy and thin. The sweetness helped to make it seem a little thicker, but the overall sweet/sour apricot taste just made it hard to stomach. Not a terrible beer, but I definitely won't be spending any more money on this."
"Creamy and bold feel. A little gruff and ashy. Substantial. It's #9 with an extra hop character. A noble failure."
"D: Its drinkable. The beer is exactly as advertised, though it still bewilders me that they call this an IPA. I cant seem to pick up the hops, though I know full well they're there. This beer reminds me a lot of that one song written by John Lennon. Good spring time brew, so kudos to DF for there impeccable timing."
"Appreciate the experiment, but this one just isn't for me."
"Overall: Unique beer from a unique brewer. It is good, and if I see it again, I will get it."
"Dont really want to drink anymore of these may have one more just to confirm or disprove the first one but that is about it. If you are looking for a nice ipa with a something a little different to it look elsewhere this is not it a nice try but just not that good."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Interesting beer, what I expected and what I tasted were quite different. Pungent hoppy sweet smell with a very light body and mouth feel, hops not really present in taste, overpowered by the tangy sourness of the beer. I liked the uniqueness of this bee, though it wasn't what I was expecting of this style."
"Overall, a good experiment with good results. The IPA and the apricot flavor compliment each other well enough for the beer to work."
"Pours an amber hue. Has a very faint aroma of dried fruit(guess which one is prominent). Has a nice balance of hops and suttle apricot notes. I would probably not buy too much more, but was still satisfied with the balance that that the apricot provided."
"Avoid at all costs until next year, when hopefully they'll see this beer's ratings dropping like mad and return to the recipe from 2006."
"Notes: DFH is my favorite brewery, but they just dont tickle me with their fruit beers. the raisons are out of this world good, but the peche and this one make me cringe"
"D--This is terrible, I'm going to drain pour the last half of the glass. I have never had this before this year and I can't believe that it has always tasted like this otherwise the rating should be much lower. Gross."
"D: Very drinkable, and like I said very well balanced, especially for Dogfish Head. Does not seem like 7%, and on a hot day or evening that could be dangerous."
"Final: I would have expected something more convincing from DFH. I'm glad to have tasted it, but won't buy it again unless nothing more interesting is available."
"pretty medium body with medium carbonation. i would never buy this again, it tastes like a wine that has gone bad. i wouldnt recommend this to anyone, unless you really love apricots."
"this is a very nice fruit beer, nice orange color pristinely clear. the head is white fluffy about 2cm. the aroma is pronounced apricot with little to no hops. taste is all tart refreshing apricot balance with a nice body of 2row and a little crystal. i get almost no hops, if they are there they are hidden under the apricot very well. buying the bottle i was intrigued by the marry of fruit and hops i really enjoyed the beer, but its not really much of an ipa. very nice spring seasonal."
"I dont mind fruit in my beer at all, but apricots seem a bit of an odd choice...not to mention pairing them with an IPA! I get some, but not an overload of hoppy bitterness as the semi-sour nature of apricots provide most of the flavor. Malts seem to be kept to a bare minimum and the body is pretty light. To me, this beer seems like it is as good of an apricot beer as one would ever find, but I dont really think apricot flavors are well suited for beer...for my palate anyway."
"I was really looking forward to this one and was let down a bit, not much of an IPA, too much apricot presence, 60 or 90 Minute and this cannot even be mentioned in the same sentence in my opinion, might drink again but I am in no hurry, still worth trying for its uniqueness"
"This is definitely a little different and hard to call an IPA. Not something I really enjoy, but not bad."
"D - this beer is light and refreshing enough to session, and the taste is so light and crisp, that it makes it highly drinkable."
"This stuff is a great spring/summer beer. Swig it down on a hot day, goes down super smooth! This is a apricot beer for the conesiour or hop head. Anyone who thinks Magic Hat #9 is too sweet or wussy should give this a try. Appearance is very pretty, dark coppery color that is see through with a light head. Super smooth drinking. So sweet to drink, yet you get the wonderful hop finish (and a good hop belch if you drink it quick!) This beer is fantastic, look forward to it this time of year!"
"D - Not bad. Not sure I would order this again. Bold marriage between the flavors of an IPA and an apricot."
"Overall, not too bad, but probably not something I will buy a four pack of. It just doesn't really do it for me."
"A descent beer but a bit of disappointment."
"Overall: Its drinkability is not too great since the flavor is not very good. I would not classify this as and AIPA since I can't even taste the hops. It is too sweet with a slight tart/bittersweet flavor. On the positive side the alcohol is hardly noticeable for 7%"
"Would be interesting to drink this side by side with a 60 or 90 minute IPA."
"Served in DFH glass at Brick Store Pub. Clearish copper in appearance with a tidy finger of off-white head. Sweet apricot fruity up front. Hoppy DFH hoppiness in the middle, but very sweet this year. Tastes and looks like the 60 but dosed with fruit."
"D - Overall pretty drinkable."
"D: I really had high hopes for this beer and maybe it tastes like a fresh apricot, but to me and what I'm familiar with and what I've come to understand from apricots, this beer just doesn't deliver and on top of that it doesn't taste like much of an IPA either. Disappointing to say the least."
"Drinkability: Tastes fine, and does a good job of covering up the relatively higher ABV. I'd recommend this, but I've had better from Dogfish Head"
"D - Worth trying. An interesting and different beer at that. While not really grabbing me with the hops its different enough that it is enjoyable."
"D- A sweet, tart East coast experience. Not really my bag. I will give DFH credit for actually having apricot flavor though. One is enough."
"D= Pretty good. Tastes interesting and I actually look forward to tasting more but I dunno if I would buy it regularly ever."
"D - It's an enjoyable beer to drink, but I see no reason to go crazy over it. I will very happily finish this beer, but I won't be actively seeking out another anytime soon."
"They did a good job with the flavors in this beer."
"Beer poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass. 2 finger head is formed and dies quickly. Plenty of nice bubbles and carbonation rise to the top of the beer. Burnt orange color. Smell is mainly hops with some citrus notes. Beer is smooth with a nice hop bite, not too overpowering, well balanced. Alcohol is hidden extremely well. Apricots are there in the finish and the carbonation holds well as you drink it. A pretty good beer."
"Drinkability is good. Its like maltier, hoppier, sour, more complex version of #9; very similar to that in it's smell and flavor. I prefer it to #9 because it's more flavorful."
"I think I would have liked this beer even more if it was a bit lighter in mouthfeel. However, it was still good, and fun to have seasonally."
"This beer is definitely and acquired taste, but those that enjoy a sweeter beer with upfront fruit flavors will probably enjoy it."
"Hot day and a 4 pack of this no problem. I don't see the fruitiness building to become cloying here, it seems to ride that perfect line. I wouldn't always be in the mood for this but then again that is why they make it a seasonal beer."
"Overall I fail to see how anyone can enjoy this beer. The sugary sweetness is just overwhelming with no balance at all. DFH, sorry I love most of your beers, but this one I just don't get."
"The mouthfeel is good at least. Thankfully I only bought a single of this. No way I could make it through a fourpack."
"Sorry DH - you guys are great but you can't win them all."
"Drinkability: One was enough. I don't really know what this was, but this was not an IPA. It tasted like really highly carbonated fruit juice. It was easy to drink, I guess. I've heard this year's batch isn't nearly as good as previous years, but this year's is all I have to go on - and I was not a fan."
"I think I like it more than I did last year when I tried it but it's not that great of a beer. For a fruit beer though it's quite good."
"Overall - I'm glad I tasted it, but I think I'll wait until next year before considering it again. apparently this year's batch has been subpar compared to previous Aprihop releases. Still, it was pretty good."
"Taste is of tart apples, some hints of sweetness, and a nice hop kick in the finish. Bitterness is where I'd like it. Nothing really about the taste tells me this is an IPA though. More like a fruit beer. Decent, but I wouldn't drink more than 1 at a time."
"I've heard from other people that this year's batch isn't as good as past years. Whether that's true or not, I don't know. But I have a feeling the high marks that have already been given for the current batch and the high marks that will surely follow are just because of the Dogfish Head name and the respect/love they have for the brewery. I have a feeling that if most people had to rate this blind, it would be no better than a C. If this were a BMC, it would have an F with reviews of ""tastes like crap."" But it's not, and I think people will describe it's uniqueness and inventiveness when they really don't like it. But, those are just my 2 cents. I've had some beers from Dogfish Head that I really enjoyed (60 Minute, Palo Santo), but this one just doesn't do it for me."
"D-Good. Does not taste at all like it's 7%, which means ther's a nice alcohol/flavor balance."
"Overall: Just imagine 60 minute IPA with an Apricot twist, and there birth Aprihop. Enjoy a 4, you wont regret it."
"I did not enjoy this beer. I'm not against adding fruit to beers, but this doesn't work for me. The blend of hops and apricot smells and flavors is off-putting. I don't want to rag on this beer, but the flavor is almost a yogurty, lactic sour, and there just isn't a nice way to say that. I dearly love DFH's IPAs, but this one is just wrong. For my money, these are not complementary flavors and really shouldn't be used together. I don't get some fruit beers. DFH clearly knows how to make good beer, but making a good fruit beer is a tall order for anyone. The fruit flavors aren't bad, per se. It doesn't taste artificial. My problem solely lies in the combination of these particular hop and apricot flavors. I appreciate the experimentation. It tempts me to give the beer a higher score, but I just don't enjoy it."
"Take a cheap, oversweetened fruit juice concentrate, then add it to a dull, hoppy beer with an annoying alcoholic bite. A bland, poorly balanced beer."
"really flavorful. the apricot is very apparent and its very hoppy as well. perfect for outside drinking. usually cheaper than most other dogfish head beers. my only main beef is with the packaging. it has some review by playboy and its really over the top. also it looks the same as all other dogfish beers. good beer. lame packaging."
"drinkability: I actually could of used more apricot. Because now it just tastes like an avg IPA. Still major improvement over last year's disaster."
"Final Thoughts - I really was glad I got to try this one. Fun creation that provides a good alternative from the standard IPA. Drink on!"
"where's the hops?"
"I normally enjoy this beer A LOT, but for some reason it is different this year. It's a lot more sour/tart tasting than in previous years. I would have liked to taste more of the hops and fruit...kinda weird, guess I'll have to wait out until next year."
"Thin body, sour bitter aftertaste. What a really bad beer. I'd rather drink apricot nyquil."
"Do better."
"Still, I commend them on the try. It's good to see different things."
"D: Drinkable for a glass only. I don't believe that I could have more than one of these in a sitting, even in the summer. The fruit flavor is a little overpowering, in my opinion."
"Light amber honey-like color with a thin light-tan head. Aroma is fruity - apricots and a little touch of sour. Flavor is also a bit sour, with a good apricot presence, but not as predominant as the aroma. Behind that is a lightly bitter IPA-style beer. Decent, but not a favorite beer for me. They make a lot of beers that I appreciate far more."
"D- This has to be the best summer beer. Light, fruity, & refreshing. I could easily drink the four pack at the beach or a picnic. Delicious."
"Drinkablity is good - the tarness of the apricot element might deter some, but I find it pleasant. Glad this comes in a 4 pack, however. The alcohol is hidden very well, although it does not really have the feel of an IPA. Good brew, though, definitely worth a shot. Definitely unique. Dogfish continues to surprise me."
"Drinkable sure, but not a session beer at almost $10 per 4-pack"
"Overall, this is a decent spring/summer beer, but I was expecting more flavor out of this."
"The intial aroma is interesting: a complex mix of the sweetness of the apricot competing with the subtle bitterness of the hops. On the tongue the fruity sweetness overpowers with a slight pine flavor on top. The finish is an intense sour (citrus) and alcohol taste which refuses to leave your mouth, leaving a lot of tongue smacking. Thin but smoothe body making it quite drinkable on a nice spring day (if you are looking for fruity and sour)."
"Drinkability: I would almost classify this as a fruit beer. It hides the alcohol well. Not too hoppy, not too fruity or sweet. I think this would make an excellent spring beer..I will look for this again"
"D- I managed to finish my glass but I won't be going for this again. I can see this being a hit with the ladies though with the fruity essence. Need to try in a bottle to compare though. I remember this being better in the past."
"D - I enjoyed this and I'll be glad to have another, but I have no desire to drink more than one at a sitting. Still, it's an interesting beer, though not an IPA by any stretch of the imagination."
"D - Quite refreshing and drinkable. Despite the strong fruit character and the significant sweetness, the hops keep the beer balanced and drinkable. As one would expect the apricot flavors blend nicely with the hops and the fruit lingers on the palate in a very pleasing manner. Not a daily drinker, but well balanced and enjoyable."
"I find the finish to be an artificial fruit sweetness that I don't find very appealing. It's on the syrupy side of things and tastes more like a medicine then a quality beer. I love Dogfish and their creative brewing but this one falls into the novelty beer section of my life. To me the potential of this beer falls way short of the mark."
"Nice fruit beer that doesn't taste artificial."
"as mentioned earlier, yes, as it warms, it opens up, reveals a bit more including it's exponential mystery...not a quaffer...but don't sip it like wine. make the leap and enjoy! it's quite worthy."
"M + D: Medium-heavier body. A sting of carbonation gives it an appreciated bite. Not a bad beer. Not my favourite beer, by all means, but another intriguing beer from DFH. This one seems to do a little better as it warms more, so I wouldn't suggest getting it TOO frigid."
"Not impressed at all, especially from such an esteemed brewer."
"Nothing pervasive in the nose. Color is darker than last year's. Ruby color? The retention is average. The mouthfeel is hefty which is a switch for this beer from years past. I get a distinct nuttiness and meatiness. It's nothing like an IPA. The hops are very muted and barely noticeable. The apricot is very present though and spins off serious sourness which isn't unpleasant but...I'm not impressed. Dogfish Head typically doesn't disappoint but the Aprihop this year leaves some things to be desired for. I'd probably have one of these at a senior cititzens' ballet recital."
"D - it went down very easy but it was a small sample. I think I could handle a pint or two."
"D - Overall this was an ok beer not the best beer from DFH would have been better if I was outside on a warm day rather than a bar drinking it worth trying if you like fruit beers"
"I wasn't overly impressed with this beer. I usually don't like fruit flavored beers, but I thought because it was an IPA it would be pretty good, and I was wrong. This is all based on my particular taste, and is by no means saying that other people won't enjoy this brew. I just personally didn't enjoy it. It's too much apricot and is unbalanced from my perspective. Tastes too much like a Magic Hat."
"D: Overall a surprising beer. Good, but not something I would drink a lot of..."
"Bottle. Pour was a medium amber color, head was small and off-white, didn't stick around long. Aroma was appealing, ripe aprocots, slight citrus. Flavor did not deliver what the aroma promised. Could barely taste the apricots, slight hoppiness was there. They need to pump up the apricot flavor profile on this one, could be a winner if they did."
"D: Mmmm, a great winter thaw beer."
"Poured a slightly hazy orange gold with a short lived white head. Aroma is sweet and fruity. The apricot flavor isn't overpowering so you can smell the hops in there. Wow! This is like number 9 but without the light wheat flavor and more hops. Flavor is slightly bready and light on the malt. Feel is kinda tingly from the carbonation but is light. I could drink these all night. Forget number #9, this could be a real gateway beer for good beer newbies."
"D - At first I didn't think this beer was too drinkable, since the apricots and the sweetness of the beer were a bit too overwhelming for an IPA. However, the dry finish and the balancing of the sweet with the tartness of the fruits and bitterness of the hops has be going back for more."
"A bit more sour than I would like but still a decent beer. Heck, some folks even like sour beers. ;)"
"Orange/brown in color, light head. Aroma of fruits with some light floral hops smell. Mediumly carbonated, sweet, medium bodied, and really just sweet...I don't get much more than the fruit/apricot and slight hoppyness. Really not standout in flavor. I'll stick to DFH's other offerings..."
"6/4/7/4/15 (3.6/5)"
"Overall a very solid little beer that definitely does not come close to the seven percent that was advertised. Still, an awesome beer I would love to get ahold of again this spring."
"Pours a clear amber with a thin film white head. Aroma is lightly sweet fruit with just a hint of grain and some dough. Flavor is initially acidic then light malt and hops and then more acid only with a fruit undertone this time. Light to medium body, somewhat thin texture. Finishes bitter and fruity."
"Pours a very cloudy red/medium brown color, medium sized head, white, diminishing. Aroma of hops, apricots. Light aroma. Light taste, light apricots, not strong hops, sweet aftertaste. Not too dry. Not very hoppy for an IPA, not too sweet."
"D: Good drinkability for what it is. A nice floral hopping and toned down apricot flavor makes this easy to enjoy like a fruity pale ale. One you could possible have a few of in one sitting on a hot summer day."
"aprihop is pretty interesting because it really walks a fineline between an IPA and a fruit beer. Niether the sweet/tart apricot nor the hops really steal the show away from the other and so it's a nice harmony. In many ways it is similar to a 60 min with a bit of the hopiness replaced with a hint of fruity sweetness, in both flavor and aroma. The mouthfeel seems a little more viscous or thicker than 60 min, closer to dogfish's Midas touch. In all, it's very drinkable and you could easily enjoy an entire pack on a hot day."
"Drinkability - Not being a big fan of fruity beers I can't believe I enjoyed ApriHop as much as I did. I've even recommended it to others. I would definitely buy this beer again - especially on grass-mowing day."
"While I could not drink this all night it is a nice change from more traditional beers"
"Drinkability: This is a good one to try, I tend to veer away from fruit flavored beers but this one may just be an exception."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe glass. The beer pours a deep honey amber with nice 2 finger head that melted away into just a thin layer on the beer leaving just a speckling of lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very up front. Apriocots. Then some candied apricot with just a hint of piney hops. Also with a prolonged wiff, I noticed some buttery notes but that could have also been a result of the apricots. The tasted is dehydrated apricots. Almost a concentrated apricot flavor. The mouthfeel is sticky sweet, with apricot sticking to the roof of your mouth, and staying around for a while, almost the same way a hop bite will linger on your tastebuds. This would be a wonderful desert, paired with a peach pie or something along those lines but definitly to sweet for a daily drinker. As a side note, I wonder if I recieved an older bottle and thats the reason for the noticble lack of hop characteristics."
"A nice mix of flavors, the alcohol is hidden well. Even though it smells like an IPA the apricot flavor shines through in the taste, but is never too overwhelming. A good balance of flavors."
"Drinkability: great flavors of malt, fresh fruits and hop bitterness abound. Refreshing and easily drinkable. I always look forward to buying this every year."
"D: Definitely, unlike other fruit beers the fruitiness doesn't overwhelm in any way so this is sessionable."
"M & D - A good drinkable IPA which holds to the tongue well with it's thicker almost bread like underbelly. It leaves you reaching for another, too bad for you when you are all out. Impressive at 7% is not overbearing in the least. Very enjoyable with the sunshine and heat and pairs well with a good quality hamburger right off the grill."
"Mouthfeel is medium and carbonated almost like a fruity soda. (Reminds me of Peach Nehi, if anyone out there knows what that is.) Drinkability is decent but is hindered somewhat by the sweetness that eventually becomes a bit cloying."
"D: ApriHop goes down really quickly. That balanced, sweet, and delicious fruity flavor is so refreshing and palatable. I drank 3 of these in an hour at the beach a few weeks ago, and now I'm regretting that I don't have more..."
"Taste is extremely good, it does not taste like an IPA at all, it is extremely well balanced with hops at the start and fruity sweetness throughout. Moderate carbonation makes for a very enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"I'm a bit disappointed with this one. I was expecting a nice IPA, such as their 60 minute with a touch of fruit added to it. Instead I got a fruit beer that hardly resembled a ""strong IPA"" or even any sort of IPA. It poured a bronze color and was topped with no head at all. As soon as I opened the bottle there was a rush of apricots and I never really got much past that in the aroma. This beer reminds me A LOT like Magic Hat #9, perhaps a little stronger alcohol presence. After drinking it a while there was some sort of flavor that resembled spicy hops but it's too sweet and definitely overshadowed by apricots. I've got 3 more (purchased 4 pack) so I'll give it another shot but unless something really changes I probably won't get it again. Update -- as promised I had it again and nope, it's just not very good. I can see it being alright if you're in the right mood and want something fruity and a bit different. Just don't expect a lot of hops. View it as a fruit beer, not an IPA."
"Pours a nice orangey brown with a thinly dissipating creamy, light, irregular brown head and light carbonation. Smells really nice and roasty- similar to their Indian Brown Ale which surprised me that it would have such a darker beer character. Also has a nice sweetness in the aroma as well that isn't as present in the Brown Ale. The taste is a mix between the fruit juice character of the apricots and the otherwise ""beeryness"" of the hops and malt. Personally, I find it confusing. You get a really heavy mouthfeel from the juice aspect which competes with the other side. I think I would have enjoyed it if they blended the two and by making it a darker beer, allowing the fruity and sweet aspect of the beer to be accented by some roastyness from the malt and some more noticeable alcohol content. It's a good take on fruit beers because it's not just a wheat beer and some syrup thrown in there but I'm not 100% sure it works for me. That being said, I only had one bottle and would probably buy it again just to make sure."
"Not much head at all and it dissipates quickly to a thin ring. Clear orange/amber color with reddish hints; delicious apricot-nectar aromas! A little light in the mouth but smooth and clean, partly due to the mild carbonation. An intriguing highbred. Not very hoppy for an IPA, not very fruity for a fruit beer. Instead, it is a well balanced blend of both styles. Medium bodied and refreshing. Tasty but just a little tangy/sour at the end."
"Served in a standard pint. Poured a translucent amber with a half inch tight off-white cap; excellent retention, but no lacing. Light nose-apricot, citrus and hops. Characteristics of the nose are amplified in the mouth, with the addition of a slightly floral character. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and effervescent with a pleasant tingle and a mild citrus pucker towards the middle. Easy drinking brew. Alcohol is well-hidden and apricot flavors are not overly intense (like in another well-know apricot beer). Very balanced and refreshing and even better on tap."
"D, notes: I didn't particularly like this beer or found it to be drinkable. Lactic sourness without the mouth puckering bitterness doesn't make for a very drinkable beer."
"This was a decent beer. I am a big fan of dogfish head beer. I went to 3 states looking for this beer before I found it. The aroma is slightly hoppy and sweet. A hint of apricots. The color was a rich dark copper. The taste has a nice sweet IPA taste with a malty finish. I was a little disappointed that the taste didnt have much apricot to it. But overall, it was a good beer."
"D: Above average drinkability, but not a fan of the style."
"Not bad. The clean finish makes this a fairly drinkable beer."
"The taste is super bitter initially and finishes malty with the apricot overtones. The finish of the fruity ipa is quite puckering. It is highly carbonated and the bubbles never stop rising. Overall an interesting drink but I probably wouldn't but it again."
"drinkability: very refreshing on a hot night, could easily have 3 or 4 of these."
"Recommended. I'll have this again."
"A good beer to try once, but not something I will revisit."
"the apricot taste is very mild, and sort of seems like more of a general light sweetness than a specific flavor. the sweetness is floating on top of the thicker hop taste, they are rich and full, sort of reminding me of an amber. medium body with lots of carbonation, moderately drinkable."
"D - An interesting style but I'm unlikely to seek this out again, unless it's on tap at a DFH pub. Guess I'm just not a fan of this style."
"This beer wasn't that bad, it's just not my style or something I'd purchase often."
"Pours a light yellow in color with only minimal head. Smell is slight hops and just a hint of tart fruit. Taste is much the same with just a slight sublety of apricots. The apricots work well in this beer, but they could have been a little more pronounced. Non-cloying and very refreshing. Could drink a few of these easily."
"D: Aside the price, this could have the potential to be a session...very easy to drink"
"D: Glad I got to try this reasonably fresh. This one's nice!"
"Drinkability here is average. An interesting style but I won't be doing it again."
"Notes: This one just was a chore to finish. I may not favor fruit beers,but I did not like the balance and I felt the fruits were not sweet or balanced. Sour after taste just not for me."
"Dogfishhead Aprihop pours a very slightly hazy light amber with a nice small but thick head. The aroma is dominated by apricots, sweet and fragrant. There is some hint of hop aroma as well. Bitterness from the hops comes through first in the flavor, followed by apricot flavor that kind of masks the hops. The apricot flavor makes the beer seem dryer with no sweetness to back it up. This is defintely better than your average fruit beer, but I'll take 60/90/120 min any day."
"Though terrific as a change of pace, I likely wouldn't want more than one of these fruity little gems in a sitting. Fruity, crisp and refreshing, but did I say, ""fruity""?"
"Drinkability is OK, more bad then good, definitely not as exciting as the fruited IPA experiment sounds, though not a total dud either. It goes down pretty easily at first, but the booze tires, and by the end, I'm pretty much sick of it. I've only had this once before, and it's been at least 2-3 years...I liked it more then, although at the time I was expecting it to be overly fruity, which it's not. I recall more hops though...perhaps my tastes have changed living on the west coast, perhaps it's just a function of this bottle being 3 months old. Either way, I don't see myself ever buying another one of these."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug. The beer poured a clear copper, with hints of orange, color with a thick white head that dissolved slowly. The aroma was pretty true to an IPA, some hops with a slight touch of sweetness. The taste was not particularly appealing to me. The sweetness of the fruit was the first thing that I tasted and I could not really get past it. I tasted the fruit at the beginning, got the hops in the middle and then back with the fruit. Overall, this was not what I was expecting at all. I expected more IPA with a hint of the apricot, but it seemed for me to be the other way around. The carbonation was right for the beer, but I could not drink more than one. I will probably not buy/order again."
"D - This is a good beer and nice for the warm weather. It's not my style but I would certainly have it again."
"On tap at Toronado SD. Still the same, grainy pale ale. Not my favorite, ratings adjusted."
"Could've just been the glass I had, which was a temporary on-tap at a local beer bar. Still, a medium-bodied beer that went down smooth and I'll have another."
"D: Nicely done my Dogfish, as usual, and is very drinkable. I would limit it to two or three per sitting. Nice fathers day present from Jess."
"D: For an IPA this is very accessible. My girlfriend can't stomach IPAs but she drank a whole bottle of this. The bitterness is very well balanced with the perfect fruit to do the job in my opinion. Great brew."
"Pours a clear amber/orange with little head that dissipates quickly. A very transparent beer that I thought would have been a little cloudy being an IPA. The smellleave a little to be desired but a nice, subtle hop presence is there with an ever-so-slight whiff of fruit. Taste is pretty good. Hop spiciness up front and the apricot is a little more pronounced than the aroma letson. A little pine/citrus is there from the IPA portion. Mouthfeel is a light smooth one. This is a very easily drinkable beer on a hot summer night."
"This is one I think I could easily get used too, smooth, goes down easily and has a taste you remember. I can see looking forward to having this seasonal every year when it rolls around."
"I love DFH - and I'm glad I tried this one, regardless of any criticisms."
"Notes: Thanks dyan, this one is the first of many."
"In the glass aprihop looks very nice, bright coppery orange, slightly hazy with a thick tight white head that dissipates to a ring of bubbles. The smell is of subtle IPA you still get the caramel malt and buttery grain with citrus/pine hops but everything is subdued a bit and rounded by a bit of sweet apricot. The taste is again a decent IPA, nothing over the top by any means, but the IPA base is there with sweet apricot layered on top. The hoppiness is cut a bit so as not to fight with the fruit while the fruit isn't cloyingly sweet or way overdone, overall the balance spot on. The finish is sweet and dry and well it tastes like apricots quite pleasant actually. Drinkability too is good the beer has enough balance to make it quite quaffable despite weighing in at 7%, the alcohol is really well hidden. I was skeptical of this pairing and admittedly slow to give this beer a try but I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised. DFH did a really good job of pairing the right fruit with this style, very enjoyable."
"D - One of the better summer brews I've had. Could have a few if not for price, and the sourness start showing after a bit."
"True, the comparisons to Magic Hat #9 would hold strong, but this brew has that patented Dogfish Head IPA flavor behind it. The lavish hop aroma and resinous flavor break the mold of other apricot fruit beers, making this one quite unique and one to seek out."
"Apricot isn't overdone and tastes ""real"" -- hops could be a bit stronger. Fairly tasty and easy to drink."
"This is an excellent fruit beer. Not too sweet, the apricot flavor doesn't taste artificial as many fruit beers do. My only complaint is the lack of hops, I expect more from dfh."
"Very apricot, very refreshing. It's more like a beer flavored apricot than vice versa. Quite tasty."
"I've loved this beer from previous batches - but this year I didnt think as much of it. I'm normally a fan of ""hoppy"" Dogfish Head beers, but this batch seemed to have less of a hop flavor than I remembered of years past. Still not bad and worth a try."
"Overall-Magic Hat's #9 with more hops. I like this beer better, but not by alot. If you are in the mood for an apricot beer either is a good choice with #9 being more economical"
"Good beer, did not dissapoint."
"A fun beer to sit down and ponder. This is part of what makes craft beer so fun. I'm not enamored with the overall flavor but as is usually the case with Dogfish Head, this is superbly crafted and a professional brew by all measures. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and in doing so delivers above expectation."
"Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol isn't too terribly high, and flavor is ok but more than a bottle in a sitting is just annoying."
"A very good, balanced beer. If available locally, I'd try all the time. Thanks Bgramer!"
"Wow, much more apricot taste then #9. Suprsingly dark for an ipa with a cream colored head. You get a strong taste of apricots with this brew. This taste backs up the a crisp hoppy finish. Smell also is also noticeably apricots. Slick oily feel with a crisp finish. Drinkablity is good, particularly if you like apricots. This brew lives up to its name being that its stongests characteristics are hops and apricots."
"Dogfish Head has pulled one off with this. Not overly fruity by any means, this is one I'd sooner characterize as a fine, unique IPA than a fruit beer. Plenty of fruit, yes, but much more."
"D - Not bad as far as fruit ales go, but I have enjoyed other DFH fruit beers more and DFH ales better in general. A very tasty beer that is better than average drinkability wise. Just another very good Dogfish head beer that happens to have apricot in the ingredient list."
"Poured into a DFN glass a nice hazy dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, very nice two finger creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is sweet, malty, nice tones of apricot, spices, and caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, a touch of apricot/spices, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, not an IPA for sure, but tasty and would drink again."
"Overall, it was another successful creation from Dogfish. I want to try this again during a barbecue, during warm weather, where it will most likely serve it's thirst quenching potential more effectively."
"Well, it's not as sweet as a fruit beer, yet not as bitter as a typical IPA. The 7% ABV is somewhat high for a fruit beer, yet appropriate for an IPA. It is difficult to find the right hole for this uniquely shaped peg."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into standard pint glass. Heavy handed pour resulted in a sub one finger head that dissipates very rapidly with no lacing to speak of. Beer poured an ocher off amber color. Smells of sticky apricot sweetness with slight yeast and hop undertones. Taste s of sticky apricot syrup with slight hop bitterness. Rather refreshing initially however the novelty fades as the beer warms. Spring-esq packaging and fruit clearly represent the target audience. Finish is long and of cloying apricot with slight hop presence. Could not drink more then 2 in a sitting."
"Aprihop is certainly tasty and a unique and great idea for a beer; however, it all fell short for me and my expectations from this inventive brewery. I found it to be an overall pretty mild ale."
"Pours a nice golden amber, nice head with tightly packed bubbles and some lacing down the glass. Something about it looks ""thicker"" than your typical IPA. Smell is very earthy and fresh but I'm not sure what it is as it doesn't resemble hops really. A light whiff of apricots rises up. Kind of musky. Taste has a little too much sweetness up front and also at times is tart though it seems fairly seemless at first. A little woodsy, earthy hop flavor in there and all is going pretty well. Then, about half way through, alcohol begins to creep out. More and more every time I take a sip. Mouthfeel is slightly bitter and a little slick on the tongue without enough carbonation. Not my cup of tea. Interesting, as many brews from DFH are, but not that great to me."
"overall extremely drinkable, a nice job from dogfish head at mastering an apricot based beer"
"D - Pretty high drinkability. Very easy drinking for a 7% abv brew. Definitely an interesting beer."
"Darn right drinkable in a bottle not so much on tap."
"This was a polarizing beer, getting a bunch of fives and twos overall on the ratings sheet. It is hoppy and with a robust apricot aroma, pours darker than you might expect, and then has a combination of strong apricot sweetness and hop spiciness. Some of the hop heads were disappointed, and some of the anti-hop people loved it."
"Poured with no head and minimal lacing. A few medium-sized bubbles make their way from the bottom of the glass, through the semi-cloudy, orange-brown beer, to the top of the glass. Aroma... apricot! and hops! But it's not as hoppy as I expected. It's most noticable in the aftertaste.This beer is best very cold."
"D: very drinkable. I'm not a big fan of apricot so I was a bit wary trying this. I should have known DFH wouldn't let me down."
"cheers"
"Aprihop is a wonderful springtime or summmer ale. As I pour from the bottle the subtle apricot aromas fill the air. The appearance of the beer is a very nice mellow orange and very clear. When i smelled the beer I got a good mix of hop aroma and apricot, which was what I was expecting at the name. First taste was slightly tart but well balanced, mouthfeel was light crisp and refreshing for an IPA. I could drink a ton of these its such a nice balance of fruit and beer. I do enjoy the fact that Aprihop holds true to the taste of an IPA while incorperating fruit at the same time."
"M/D - Smooth, creamy feel. A little too sweet for me but definitely an interesting beer."
"Decent, but probably not something I'll get again."
"Cute novelty, not one I'd buy more of."
"Cheers."
"Final Thought: Great effort for a fruit and vegetable beer, despite it being heavy at times."
"This one was quite enjoyable. It poured a darker, clear copper with just the slight hint of a white head and seemed pretty bubbly. It said it was an apricot IPA, but the hops seemed to be almost entirely masked by the apricots. Even though I'm a hophead, I didn't mind the lack of the hops because the apricot flavor was really good. It finished pretty tart and the strong apricot flavor lingered. It was definitely drinkable and I'd highly recommend this spring one."
"D: A good session beer with an ABV of 7%. Would buy again. Cheers."
"It's a pretty easy beer to put down but I was a bit let down with the lack of hops. I am not sure if I would pick it up again but would not turn it down either."
"D- A decent beer but not one I'd drink often. I would like to drink it colder and on a hot summer day."
"Definitely a crowd pleaser and I would order again."
"A good fruit beer that works with dinner or dessert."
"This is amazingly drinkable for a fruit beer. Worth a try if you can find it."
"d - Most good beers with high alcohol contents disappoint me because I can't drink too many of them. This beer on the other hand is ok because I don't want to drink enough of it for the 7% to have any affect on me. It tastes kind of like apricot syrup mixed with a stale boston lager."
"Notes: It's crazy how much your tastebuds can change in a year... It seriously steps all over Magic Hat #9"
"Overall, this beer is quite drinkable. I wish it was a late spring, early summer release as it's refreshing qualities make me feel it would be awesome on a hot summer day. This is a perfect blend of fruit and hops."
"Brown bottle reads, ""An India Pale Ale brewed with real apricots."" Pours an orange-amber color, with an approaching crown of dense, fluffy, and creamy suds. A nose of apricot, slight pineapple, and pine oiled hops. Middling apricot taste that has dashed tartness and a hoppy bitterness that settles in the middle then balances with subtle malt character. Finishes with a medium mouthfeel that is crisp, quite dry, and a good bite expected for an India Pale Ale."
"A very well done fruity IPA with the apricots complimenting the hops, this is one tasty, easy drinking, and refreshing beer. I look forward to it's release each Spring."
"Highly refreshing and highly drinkable. A unique twist to a style (IPA) that is too easy to make generically. I will definitely remember this beer once the hot Milwaukee summers roll around."
"D: The apricots get to be a bit overwhelming after a second glass."
"12 oz bottle, pours hazy amber with a cream colored head. Aroma of dried apricots, very pleasant, followed with a hint of sweetness. The taste and mouthfeel were a bit of a suprise compared to other apricot beers I have tried. This one has much more backbone, and there is a nice play between malt and apricot flavors. I don't really notice much hop flavor, unless its just meshing really well with the fruitiness. There is a nice bitterness that compliments the apricot nicely. Moutfeel again is much more full bodied than I expected, even given the IPA base. Nice sticky lacing left on the glass. This one suprised me, and in a good way. Very tasty."
"While I'm not usually a fan of fruity beers, I am a huge believer in truth in advertising. Something named Aprihops should taste at least a little like apricots. Old reliable Dogfish has infused this offering with a nice undertone of apricot, or some sweet citrusy fruit. The key here is that it doesn't overwhelm the base hoppiness of the brew. A very nice, light-tasting selection from Dogfish."
"D: Kind of fruity but still very drinkable. The best fruit beer I've ever tried."
"Eric"
"T: Lighter body with medium carbonation. Strong malt backbone with a strong fruit/apricot flavor, slightly tart and sour. Not quite as much hop flavor as expected, but there are some floral notes here. Not much bitterness or alcohol. Overall, a very good beer in a style that seems to be awful more than its not, but I'm still not crazy about it. Reminds of the Trader Joe's Apricot Wheat (which was not very good) with similar flavors and honestly, if I wanted this flavor profile again (minus the hops) I would just buy that for half as much. Basically, I'm saying I really have no desire to drink this again and will stick with the festina peche from dfh as a summer beer."
"M&D: Very light, almost water in texture but this isn't necessarily bad as it goes pretty well with the fruit. The carbonation is very light but seemed persistent throughout the experience. The first few pulls seem relatively smooth but it seems to gather on the tongue over the course of the drink. It's interesting, even tastes refreshing at first, but I really did get sort of tired of it quickly. Definitely worth a try as it isn't bad. But one was enough for me."
"D-Interesting but not something that I would drink alot of. Never would have thought of an IPA and apricot. I don't really think that two assertive flavors balance well."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a clear deep orange with 2 cm of foamy off white head that is ends up as a thin film by the end. Aroma of fruit dominates, mostly apricot, some floral hops and a hint of alcohol. Initial flavor is very fruity. End flavors are less fruity and has a hint of the hops. Aftertaste is when the hops really show up and become pretty strong. Some lacing, light to moderate carbonation, light bodied, and some alcohol noted. Drinkability is limited for me personally because of how sweet it is, but a great beer nonetheless."
"Taste is malt and some apricot upfront which then transitions to the hop profile, not too bitter but earthy nevertheless."
"D: This is among the best fruit/vegie beer I have experienced. The balance and complexity was an added plus to the major feature the well managed apricot flavor."
"D- Again I could drink this beer all day, until you feel the 7%ABV kick in."
"D - I wish this one was brewed year round, I love it. I could sit here and rant on about how yummy it is, but what's the use? I've got my stock, get yours before I buy it all."
"D: One is enough, and that is pushing it. I would love more complexity in smell and flavor. Too much apricot is overwhelming."
"Cheers"
"Maybe tap lines need a cleaning?? I will have to give another try again just to be sure. If it wasn't the tap lines, this is a disappointment from DFH."
"Drinkability - A nice drinking beer for something that is 7% ABV. Did not notice the alcohol at all. Enjoyable enough for me to pick up a four-pack at the local Green's on Buford Highway before heading back to Columbia."
"This beer is not bad for a fruit beer and its pretty hopped-up, but ends up being too out-of-balance with the building sweetness on the finish."
"12oz brown bottle bottled 2-27-08 purchased at The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a clear amber-golden body with a half inch of off-white head. Smells strongly of caramel and biscuit malt with hints of apricot and hops. Caramel and biscuit malts share the flavor with American hops with apricot on the finish. Surprisingly balanced and tasty, but not as strongly hoppy or fruity as the name would imply I think. Medium-bodied with ample carbonation to help clean the palate. Very very drinkable considering the ABV (alcohol is not noticeable). Good stuff."
"Overall a nice quenching beer , although a little high in the ABV's, I could drink a few."
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber color with an average head that dissapates into a slight ring. The aroma is of sweet, tart, and tangy apricots; not much in the way of hops detected. The taste starts off with a sweet apricot flavor which is followed by a slightly bready malt. Again, not much in the way hops detected. The feel is light but not watery, has very fizzy carbonation; finishes with a twangy apricot flavor. An average fruit beer and from what I remember; very similar to Magic Hat #9. Still not sure why the call it ApriHOP. I don't really detect a strong (or slight) hop presence."
"D - Adventurous and tasty, but not a serious session beer in my estimation..."
"The flavor is generally pleasant; it's not my favorite but it strikes a nice balance between being sweet and fruity and more serious with the citric hopping. I thought it got a little cloying as it warmed, and the mouthfeel could be a bit chewier, but a pretty impressive fruit beer."
"I think this beer STILL needs a few more weeks to fully reach its 'ripeness' in the bottle, for everyone who disliked the 2008 Aprihop i ask that you revisit this one."
"Bought a single bottle because I wasn't sure of this beer, and it turned out to be a wise decision. This beer was an interesting experiment (fruit into an IPA) but not something I enjoyed too much. At first glance it looks like a normal IPA, clear and light golden orange colored, but the aroma packs some apricot-peachy foulness on top of the hops. The taste was not very complementary to the hops in my opinion. That said, DFH has great brewing skills and creativity. I appreciate the thought behind the beer, it's just not a creation I enjoyed."
"This was a good, solid IPA. Drunk straight from the bottle, I don't have specific notes on the appearance, but it smelled great. The taste had decent bitterness that was well blended with malt flavoring. It had a slight hint of apricot in the flavor that made it unique, but that was barely distinguishable. Overall, it was a moderately enjoyable beer."
"D = This is a pretty interesting IPA. I would recommend trying it but as a normal IPA to drink from DFH, I would probably suggest 60-minute over this one."
"I am somewhat disappointed by this brew. It just taste like the fruit, not much else. I may re-review in a few weeks, but this isn't what I expected from DFH. I was really expecting more, but it isn't a bad brew, just not what I was expecting from this beer."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, carbonation is high but appropriate. Drinkability is pretty good on this one. No sign of the 7% and very easy to go down. Pretty solid beer. Apricot character is subtle at times which really allows this one to cling to it's IPA roots."
"D - pretty solid drinkability despite the tartness. I could probably do 2 of these in a row, but I think more than that would certainly be overkill. Still, enjoyable overall."
"D: It's not too sweet and it's got a good hop character - pretty drinkable."
"The pour was a nice orange/copper body with a one finger tan head. Right off the bat the smell of apricots and hops wack you in the face. The taste was good. A nice balance or the fruity flavor and hops with a little wheat mixed in. IT was very refreshing and crisp. Sweet on the palate and very easy to drink. Easily a session beer."
"Crisp and upbeat with a slight velvety consistency and a smooth finish. Refreshing and fruity. A tasty warm-weather brew. My only issue would be that its possibly a bit too sweet initially for me, besides that its very enjoyable."
"$2.75 single from Lush on Halsted in Chicago."
"Drinkability is extremely high. A great seasonal and a great beer all around. Perfect for the ladies as well."
"Wow this poured a crystal clear light amber color. I could look down through the glass and easily see details of the table it was sitting on. Some suds at first but quickly dissipated and didn't see any lacing on side of glass. I know it's brewed with apricots but smelled like welch's white grape juice to me. I did detect a mild fruity flavor to it but I wish the apricot flavor was more pronounced. The hops weren't too overpowering and it when down easy. Not quite what I expected and not a bad beer but wouldn't go out of my way to try this one again."
"Pours a golden amber color with a short and medium bodied white colored head that laces the glass a little on the way down. The aroma is of spicey citrisy hops and apricot flavoring. The taste is really good as the apricot flavor and the hoppy flavor actually mix very well together for a very interestingly fruity beer. The mouthfeel is also very good with a crisp and clean feel that is really enjoyable and makes the beer very drinkable. Well worth a try even if fruity beers and hoppy beers aren't your thing."
"This is a well executed fruit beer. Bright and thirst quenching. However, I am not sure if I could drink more than one these just because the fruit gets a little tiresome. Otherwise a good beer."
"Very, very interesting stuff. I envision this beer as a gateway drug of sorts to the world of IPAs. It's strange, unique, and was pleasantly engaging. That being said, it's strange and unique in that way that doesn't make it an instant go-to beer, and more a conversation starter or - as I mentioned earlier - a gateway drug for hesitant beergoers."
"D:While I'm not sure if calling this beer an IPA is the most correct label, I do think that it is incredibly good. The apricot tastes great in it and the bitterness compliments it very well. I would love to buy it again and could drink them very easily."
"D_This basically is what Magic Hat #9 should taste like. A pretty good apricot ale, one I was expecting to have more hops yet good nonetheless."
"D: For me, it's more of a novelty than something I'd reach for on a daily basis."
"Pours a clear dark brownish amber with not much head. Aroma has a sharp bite and a definite fruit smell, rather like a cider. Flavor is malty and fruity, and has a noticeable apricot component, as well as some hoppy bitterness. Finish is lively and has a good edgy feel."
"Definitely worth a shot..."
"Interesting...not worth the high price tag though. Not bad, it just doesn't completely come together."
"It's better than #9 by a nose."
"D: Very drinkable, I like this one and look forward to many over the spring. Its like a jacked up #9, which I do like. Un-DFHlike but a really good drinker. Does leave me hoping for a bit more hops, not really an IPA but again, delicious."
"Sam and his boyz don't always knock 'em out of the park, but as long as they keep swinging for the fences I'll keep buying their product. Aprihop is a solid RBI double."
"Poured from bottle into Dogfish Head pint glass. Bottle date is 2/22/08, so this one took a couple weeks to get to CO. Golden orange in color with a slight head. Apricott smell and taste is not over powering which is nice. This is a very easy beer to drink. I would put this toward the top of my list for lighter beers, but I do like apricott. Dogfish Head is one of my top 5 favorite brewereies and they have a winner here."
"Nice fruit beer, so much better than most."
"Drinkability is mid-range. I don't know if I'd have more than two or three."
"Poured a clear copper orange color with a one finger white head that dissipated quickly and left a thin ring with some decent lacing. Smells of sweet malts with some hints of apricot. There is not much hop presence left. Not being a hophead I like this beer more now. I had a bottle of this fresh but it was a little too bitter than with hardly any fruit sweetness. The taste is definitely apricot. there is some malt presence but hardly any hops. The mouthfeel is a little thin but decent. The overall drinkability is better after some aging. I like this one after 8 to 10 months in the fridge."
"This wound up being a drainpour for me..."
"Nice rich slight cloudy amber pour, but transluscent still with a big frothy offwhite almost peachy head. Smell is mild hops, sweet malt and light apricot. Bottle isn't very new, so perhaps the smells have faded a bit. Taste is mildly hopped, slight bit of alcohol present, with a sweet apricot syrupy taste present too. Slightly more IPA like than pure fruit beer, which is a nice change. Mouthfeel is rich and has more body than expected. Overall a great fruit beer, a good IPA and one I'd like to definitely try again very fresh. One of my favorites from DFH."
"Caramel, light honey color with an off-white head. Smell was--go figure apricot heavy. Taste was creamy and apricot forward, but it was also awash in other sweet fruits. Noticeable alcohol. Creamy mouth feel with low apparent carbonation. Drinkability, for me, was through the roof, although the alcohol content might slow one down."
"O: It’s flavorful but I didn’t find it too tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, Unlike many fruit beers, this one doesn’t use the fruit flavor to try covering up the fact that it is still a beer, but this is definitely not a beer that I would want to drink again."
"D - A nice balance of flavors add to the beers drinkability. Overall this beer is enjoyable and a great spring offering."
"D- It is good just not really my thing. Glad I got to try it and will probably leave it at that."
"Pours a clear but darker amber with a half inch white head that falls fast. Nose is apricot yes, but not powerfully so. It is rather gentle but firm. Flavor is hoppy, but seems interfered with by something. I have to wonder if hops and apricots make a viable chemical mix. Feel is nice. When it first hit my tongue I thought...this one feels good. Nice level of bubble. I have to say I was a bit let down on trying this one. I dont think I had any over the top expectations for this one, but I dont feel like it really delivered anything serious. Nice to try, but never again."
"Thanks again, Deniz, for throwing this one in. DFH has again defied the odds. ;^)"
"Drinkability: I like the color, the smell was pretty good, but I just didn't care for it. I didn't care to drink this during the winter season and I still wouldn't care to drink this fresh during the spring season. One was more than enough for me."
"Drinkability: This is a very pleasant IPA with a twist. I really admire Dogfish Head for their innovation, even if I dont always like the results. However, this one I can definitely see drinking again."
"D - The apricot flavor works quite well with the fruity/flowery hops and sweet, bready malts. Looked great in the glass. Nose was a little lacking, but still some nice, fruity aroma was present. Very tasty with a good balance of hops, malts and the apricots. I think beer drinkers who are typically not into IPAs can even appreciate this brew."
"While bummed on the nose, the taste and mouth-feel came thru. It was surprisingly complex and very well balanced with mouth-feel an important factor. I enjoyed this very much and would definitely recommend making a point of annually enjoying this release. I know I will."
"The beer poured with a nice, red brown color with a brownish-white head. It's smell is really strong: heavy citrus. It tastes like a strange combo of a fruit menagerie with tons of hops. This actually makes it very balanced: nothing so overpowering you want to turn it away. But at the same time it is not light either. Overall, this can be a hard beer to get into at first. But it definitely grows on you after the first few strange sips."
"Note: My tasting took place at the Dogfish Head Alehouse in Gaithersburg, which is not a brewery, so the freshness may have a little off - have been here many times and the issue never arose, anyway. A wonderful if not unique quaff."
"reason. Awesome."
"Not a bad ale. Lack of any type of noticeable malt is personaly hampering for this brew to me, but I also get that that's not the point of this beer. Decent brew worthy of respect."
"Drinkability: A tasty beer that works well at the end of a hot summer day. Wouldn't really drink this during the winter or colder season...but good for a desert like beer. Basically I couldn't see myself having more than 1 a night"
"Interesting beer from DFH. IPA and apricots. I will be likely to grab an IPA before another aprihop, but given that this is seasonal I think it is a nice change of pace during the year. A beer you should definitely try."
"12 ounce bottle- had in fridge since mid April. Figured good time to quaff last one. Nice looking beer- orange/red amber and good clarity. No head to speak of and minimal lacing. The apricots really show up in the nose of the beer. Taste- the fruit is well blended with the IPA. Very balanced and quite tasty. I think the fruit is showing up more now than when I first purchased it. Nice level of hops, and not too much that could interfere with the apricot flavour. Malts are well done here as well. Drinkability suffers some due to it being 7%. Its a dangerous 7% beer- comes off more like a session ale. One of the better DFH offerings I've tried to date."
"D - I could drink two or three of these. I think it's a little too hoppy for me to drink several, but I was actually surprised how good it was after remembering how it tasted straight from the bottle."
"D: A smooth, tasty beer, would be an excellent summer quencher, even with the high ABV, another tasty and great beer from Dogfish Head."
"Drinkability was kind of diminished I think due to the everstrengthening apricot taste. I would probably not go past 2 or 3 of these in a session before moving onto something different."
"Let me preface this review by stating that I felt this to be a very strange beer. It poured up very nicely, with a copper bronze coloured body and a big, thick, fluffly white head that lasted several minutes. Smell was rather perfumey with a moderate level of hop aroma and a subtle, but noticeable level of apricot. Taste was very ""busy"" with quite alot going on simultaneously. First, comes the hop bitterness, which is pleasant. The, before the hops subside, comes the sweetness and tartness of the apricot. It almost tastes like what I would imagine eating grapefruit and apricot together would taste like. It's rather bizarre, indeed. Then during and after the finish, there is a sensation that almost reminds me of spraying cologne and getting some mist in my mouth. Strangely, inspite of my description, it isn't really unpleasant, just odd. I didn't find this beer offensive, but it certainly is novel to say the least. I'm still trying to decide exactly how I stand with it..."
"D: I could have a couple of these beers. Theyre fruity, but they dont leave a sicky-sweet fruit flavoring in the mouth afterwards."
"not a huge apricot fan but my only other experience comes from magic hat #9 so not a whole lot to go from. i do however love ipa's. looks really nice with great head retention. smells slightly sweet, definitly hop prescence, not overloaded but typicaly dogfish head. very well rounded taste, quite smooth. caramel notes were suprising to me. the apricot flavor wasn't intense but complemented the flavors well. not my favorite ipa but better than quite a few others. i'd pick up a sixer of this."
"It drinks similar to a Magic Hat #9, though I find the ApriHop to be tastier. Much better mouthfeel and body. Despite the 7% ABV, it drinks easy, and you could definitely enjoy a few of these in a night."
"D: I could go through a few and be quite happy."
"Not bad!"
"drinkability - Interesting beer, not bad.If you like hoppy bears and not to crazy about the fruit stuff. This is for you."
"Pours a clear brown/red, thick white head, nice lacing, good retention, settles to a nice layer. Smell is sweet, very malty, caramel, lots of apricots, citrus and floral hops, some alcohol, nice integration with the fruit and hops. Taste is similar, very malty up front, bit of sour apricot, floral, some alcohol, caramel, tart finish, quite bitter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. High bitterness doesn't work so well with the apricots for me, but still a nice drink."
"D- very high, the clean finish with the apricots lends it a high drinkability"
"Pours an orangy amber color with a thinnish off-white head. Nose is hoppy, with some sweet malt thrown in. Slightly floral. Where is the apricot? Palate is less of an American style IPA base and more of an English style. Quite sweet up front, then yielding to a nice hop bitterness, Again, am I missing something? Where is the apricot? There is a slight fruitiness here, but I couldn't identify it as apricot if I had to. Mouthfeel is the strongest aspect of this beer - rich, smooth and pleasingly acidic. Very full mouthfeel for an IPA, regardless of what it's infused with. Let me say I really dig what the boys at Dogfish Head do - I love the ""risky"" beers. Sometimes it's a roaring success (90 & 120 Minute IPAs) and sometimes it's just ... well ... interesting. This one didn't quite live up to expectations for me, but it's a damn decent English style IPA none the less."
"D - This is one of my favorites; a delicious IPA with just enough apricot and fruit flavors to give you a nice spring refresher"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Fairly light bodied in the mouth with just the right levels of carbonation. In my opinion the mouthfeel compliments the rest of the brew quite nicely. This is a brew I'll definitely buy again, a very unique IPA, nicely crafted and easy to drink."
"Scott"
"Overall: I love a lot of fruit beers, especially apricot beers, and I love IPAs, so don't trust my opinion on this one, I was destined to love it."
"D: Overall a really decent beer that doesn't disappoint and defiantly worth a try. Went well on a nice day by the lake."
"D- This is quite drinkable. A great fruit beer for IPA lovers. It was also interesting to taste something fruity other than a wheat beer."
"While not a bad flavor, this is not something I could drink one after the other."
"Overall, this beer lacks the hop character to be called an IPA, but stands very well on its own. It's the kind of thing DFH does very well, unique."
"D- fruit brew thats very well balanced, very drinkable, abv to high to session, not amazing for an IPA, but one hell of a blend. worth a try"
"D: This is a decent summer beer that we found to be quite refreshing. Not convinced to return to it for further testing, though."
"Drinkability: I like this, but I don't know if I'd want to drink it all night. There's a little too much going on."
"Great fruit beer (to me) but not sure if it really fits the characterization of IPA also."
"This beer and 90-minute justify every other beer dogfish head has ever produced."
"but this had a muddled balance.."
"Drinkability is exceptional. This is just real easy to drink. You could put away 3 of these with some good pub fare, no problem. All in all, another fine, nuanced, damn-near-sessionable beer from the Delaware crew."
"This a tasty, not overpowering beer. Good hop character, as expected from DFH, and present, but not cloying, apricot taste as well. Malts meld very well with the rest of the beer. Very easy drinking beer with lots of flavor. My wife's new favorite summer time sipping beer. Would go well nice w/ grilled chicken or burgers off the Weber."
"Overall this brew is okay, but nothing Id strive to drink again. This brew is about as boring as this review."
"One of the best fruit beers i've ever tasted. A must try beer in my book."
"Another very good and unique beer from Dogfish Head. Some of their experimental beers are hit or miss but Aprihop is definately a winner."
"D- Interesting enough flavors but not at all strong. Alcohol is unnoticable."
"A lot of people have been comparing this beer to Magic Hat #9, and it is similar, only hoppier and with less diacetyl. I definitely like it better. It wasn't as hoppy as I was expecting, but good nonetheless. Recommended."
"The Aprihop pours a clear amber with a bit of a head and a little lacing. It smells very good, mostly featuring the apricot and the biscuity malts, but there is some tart hops going on as well (actually, it was hard for me to tell if the hops smelled bitter or fruity because of the apricot, so I'm sticking with tart). Tasted similar, with the malts up front and the hops bringing up the rear. Wish that it left the mouth a bit drier as it is a touch syrupy, but it goes down easy on a warm day as well as warming you up on a chilly night. A well made apricot ale by our friends at DFH (was there any doubt?)."
"D - This was a remarkably ok beer. I was really hoping for something here, but didnt get it."
"Beer pours a light copper color with a thick, frothy head. The aroma is hoppy and full of the apricot essence. The taste gives away a wonderful hoppiness balanced with some sweetness from the apricots. It leaves a smooth mouthfeel and does not come off as too bitter or too sweet. Well balanced beer and certainly a better example than the other beer of this style that I sampled."
"Mouthfeel was quite smooth and pleasent. This is a very different brew, and quite an enjoyable experience. I think it might be an occasional though."
"Pours a nice amber color, not too light, not too dark, with a small amount of head. Aroma is sweet with apricot, but you can definitely tell the hops are there. Tastes fruity up front, but the fruit leaves and up comes the malt and hops, but doesnt leave you with a dry mouth like some IPAs do. Its a great beer on a summer day, so long as you arent sitting in the sun, this one can definitely sneak up on you."
"Totally clear, amber color, very small head, no lacing. Nose is just as advertised, lots of apricot and some hops. Very sweet and fruity, but not too complex. Flavor is a little more interesting - lots of apricot up front again, like a Magic Hat #9. Gets s little beerier...fairly even malt and hops, although hops have a slight edge. Feel is solid, good carbonation, medium body. I thought was sessionable until I checked the ABV, so I guess it did a good job of hiding its kick. Very tasty and unique brew."
"Scored points where it counts, the taste. Will buy again."
"pours a luscious amber/peach color with nice clarity, soft head, and good lacing. bouqet consists of apricot, sweet bready malts, and flowers. unique and quite nice aroma. taste is medium sweet upfront mixed w/medium hop bitterness. finish is dominated by sour notes from the apricots, leaving you puckering a bit. as a unique beer worth a try but not something you would session."
"D: This will be a great summertime beer. It has some decent fruit characteristic which I imagine will be stronger in a fresh beer. The nice thing about this beer is that it isn't sickly sweet like other fruity beers. The hops cut the sweetness and provide a nice balance."
"While watching "" My Beloved Glasgow Celtic "" win the SPL title on a great free kick from SPL player of the year Shunsuke Nakamura . When poured into my pint glass the amber color is beautiful . I'm am not a fan of apricots so I was a bit on the fence with this brew . I was just back from Myrtle Beach , playing golf , and I was all out of Dale's Pale Ale . Aroma of apricot and some hops . The apricot smell is not overwhelming . The taste is pleasant and there is apricot flavor on the end . This was a joy . Even better with Naka's 90 min sweet left peg . This was also in my glass for the Red Sox kicking the shite out of the Yankees . 4 bombs in a row . Will it be Torre's last the season ? George must be pissed . This beer is just as sweet/bubbly as the Sox sweep and will be in the fridge throughout the spring ."
"Bottled dated 3/12/2007, Poured into a pint glass, pours a amazing amber with a fluffy pinkish head that stays the entire drink and leavs thick heavy lace. Smell is very citrusy with hints of fruit, not overwhelming with fruit but its there, I remeber last years version had a deeper fruit scent. Taste was a bit mild with sweetness then a bit of a hop bitterness, this to me was a bit better than last years. Anyway you look at it its one fine damn brew from a awesome brewary."
"Thick, but not overly so. Hops and malt balance nicely. Yet another good beer from DFH and the most drinkable fruit beer I've had to date."
"D- average drinkability. I'd much rather other dogfish brews. I enjoyed it while I had it but I don't know if I'll go out looking for it again."
"Drinkability: Flavorful, but a little sweet."
"A very drinkable beer and a pleasing combination of fruit and an IPA."
"This beer was stellar. Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug and this beer was fairly impressive from the get-go. The head was fairly thick and had very good retention. A nice, orange-amber body with an orange-tinted head. The smell was very sweet; the presence of apricots was prevalent. The taste did not disappoint and was very interesting and pleasant. The presence of the apricots were very strong and the subtlety of the hops was excellent in serving to balance off the apricot taste. The mouthfeel was very full-bodied; fairly thick. This beer is definitely very drinkable. The hops provide a spiciness to it that would draw most hopheads but the apricot and hop tastes are so complimentary that even maltier beer drinkers would find this beer enjoyable. A nice tasting, smooth brew that is definitely a good call."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a clear copper amber color. Two good fingers of tight bubbly off-white head formed. Head quickly faded into a thin ring of lace in the glass. Smell: Strong apricot aromas jumped from the glass, followed by a nice malty character, and some smooth fragrant hops. No alcohol in the nose. Taste: The flavor of this beer was dominated by the apricot. Small bursts of bitter hops and nice malt flavors. Little carbonation noted, with no noticeable alcohol. Very clean taste to it. Seems very sweet from what I can remember from the last time I had this. Nice dry finish with a little yeast flavor in the aftertaste. Medium bodied, smooth, easy drinking beer. Pretty well balanced. The apricot really stands out and is really quite pleasant."
"you might try this one once"
"Drank alright, started to grow on me, once thehops asserted themselves. Nota great IPA, but a damn good fruit beer!"
"D- I enjoyed this beer and have had it fresh at the brewpub and in bottles for several years. I would recommend this beer over other apricot beers because it lacks that sweet butter aftertaste that I feel ruins this style."
"Drinkability - I might make this a sessioner. Light refreshing and tasty."
"I love Dogfish Head brews, but for some reason, I'm not really impressed when it comes to their fruit beers. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a deep copper, forming a very thin head, that left medium rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is very full. Lots of hop aroma, followed by an extremely strong aroma of apricots. The taste is, IMO, overpowered by the apricot flavor. A good amount of hops, and a light alcohol presence, but mostly dominated by the apricots. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, I was a little disappointed with this one. Not at all like I expected. Where their Punkin Ale was lacking in flavor, this one is overpowering in flavor. Not a bad beer by any means, but I'm definitely doubting myself if I could have more than one of these in a night."
"O - Wow. I always expect something unique and different from DFH, but they still caught me off guard with this -- a lightly-flavored refreshing beer. In that vein, they did a stupendous job. This beer is yum and drinkable as hell."
"Very tasty, but thin. No apricots to detect at all. Pine/grass and a pucker on the first couple of mouthfulls. I was chewing, sucking, swirling, waiting - anything, to pick up other flavors. A very drinkable brew, but far what I have grown to expect from DFH. Nothing too unusual to mention, other than it's a well balanced run-of-the-mill IPA or hopped up amber thats great for deck drinking."
"Overall this is an outstanding beer from DFH, and even though it is a bit 'fruity' and out of the ordinary, I'd recommend it to anyone. Unique and delicious."
"Not an easy one to describe - nice though. Don't know if it's one I would grab with any regularity, but it does a nice job of throwing an apricot into an IPA."
"Taste is of fruity peach and apple notes with a noticable ""signature DH"" hop note. A nice alcoholic bite hits the back of the palate, and the mouthfeel is refreshing, light, and crisp. All in all, this is a tasty, fruity, fun beer. I suggest having one while watching a spring sunset (cliched? yes, but still not to be missed...alot like the beer)."
"I saw this today when I was picking some beer up for someone. I was in the mood for a hoppy beer and a fruit beer, so I had one. It's really nicely balanced. Not that bitter really. IPA with apricots? Not crazy bitter like an IPA. Nice bitterness with an apricot balance. Veyr nice and easy to drink. Quite a treat. Definetly a beer that is welcome in my fridge any time."
"Pours a copper color with a cream white head which disappeared quickly. Smell is what you would expect for this beer, apricots with hops. Hops are more in the aroma than the flavor which is more malt accented than I would have expected. As the beer warms a bit the fruit and hops get more involved. Not a beer I would buy all the time, but a nice change of pace especially for spring and summer. another interesting beer from one of my favorite brewers."
"Poured a nice crisp orange with a thin head that diminished to a ring. The aroma was of apricots and earthy hops, but somewhat weak. The taste was well balanced for an IPA, the apricots and malts provided a nice sweetness and the hops balanced them somewhat nicely, just a tad heavy on the malts for an IPA if you ask me. The beer is light on the palate and easy to drink, just not what I look for in an IPA."
"I poured this one into my favorite Chimay goblet. It's a wonderful looking, crystal clear auburn color with a frothy and tenacious head. Smell is apricots! How cool! The fruit rules the party, but there's a nice, thick malty background, too. I don't notice much in the way of hops because they're blending in with the fruityness of the apricots. The taste is sweet at first, a touch of a bitter and alcohol bite, and then... apricots! What a neat beer. I don't think I'd drink these daily, but it's a fun beer to keep around. This thing's like a conversation piece."
"12oz bottle dated 03/02/07 poured into a pint glass. The aroma is loaded with apricots, sweet malt, a little bit of caramel and a touch hops. The taste begins with a sweet fruitiness and some toasted malt with a nice dose of hops in the finish. Overall, this is another unique and exciting brew from DFH. It is always a treat to try these weird brews from DFH for something different every once in a while for a change. Recommended!"
"D- sweet but not too sweet, bitter but not too bitter, if it was more readily available and was a bit more reasonably priced, i would be drinking it fairly often"
"I could probably drink these all day. A little sweet but overall a good twist on the ipa style. Noteworthy that although the apricots are present they never really overwhelm or distract."
"Appearance is a transparent amber with a light fluffy two one and a half finger head that eventually falls to a skim on top of the beer. This is not a sticky beer, almost no lacing apparent and what is there quickly falls. Strong scents of apricot and other citrus show through at the front of this beer and it has a nice hoppy finish. Tastes of apricot and citrus and malt...this is definitely an IPA based beer as the hops, though tame in IPA standards have a strong appearence for it being a flavored beer...which, makes me a very happy camper...mouthfeel is slightly thick and surprisingly full bodied as well which also made me quite happy. All in all, this is a great summertime brew to savor through the heat...DFH does it again."
"Recommended"
"Drinkability: Oh, this is a warm weather beer, all right. Bright flavors and smooth delivery. No notice of the 7% ABV."
"Poured a nice two inch head with good lacing. A good smooth fruity richness first hits, then a zip of hops balances out the malty sweetness. The fruit and malt give this beer a great mouthfeel. a creamy texture with a soft finish. I paid $7.99 for a four pk. which at 7% abv. is not to shabby!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It tastes a little thick and it definitely lies on the sweet side for me. That limits its drinkability. But, I could still have two or three in a sitting. Overall, it's a good beer. It won't be a regular in my fridge. But, it's unique and worth a try."
"I've had a number of ""fruit"" beers over the past few years but most of them leave much to be desired. I think the beers, like the Aprihop, that use actual fruit instead of a fruit syrup derivative achieve a better quality product. Try the Aprihop and you'll know what I mean."
"Pours amber with decent head and sticky lacing. Aroma is typical IPA with a citrusy kick. Taste is bready malt followed by a sweet hops kick. Very interesting -- reminds me of DFH 90 minute with less alcohol bite. Apricots sweeten the mix but are subtle considering the name. Mouthfeel is excellent. Not syrupy, but very full bodied. Very drinkable; each sip invites another and it goes down fast. Perfect spring seasonal."
"Pours a very clear rusted orange color with a dense, off-white two finger head. Good retention that leaves big patches of sticky lace. Mild nose of tropical fruit, Crystal malt and background casacde hop aroma. Light caramel and mellow apricot flavors in the first sip. Fruit becomes more apparent in the aftertaste- the malt sweetness and gentle apricot flavor are delicately balanced by subdued american citrus hop flavor and even bitterness. Medium mouthfeel has dextrinous texture(possibly from fruit proteins?) and medium carbonation. This is a restrained fruit beer, and not an IPA + apricots as the label claims. The fruit character is evident, but less commanding as in most other fruit beers; the typical fruit blast is here replaced with a solid American Pale Ale base and simply accented with apricot. Finishes with minimal pale malt and caramel sweetness-lingering apricot tatse, and stubborn but muted hop bitterness. A highly drinkable beer that demonstrates what can happen when you don't screw a fruit beer up."
"This is a rather cloying sweet aroma beer. Either it is not cold enough or it needs to sit. Either way it pours a nice orangeish amber with and off white head that leaves lace. The aroma is of strong fruits, but I couldn't tell if it was actually apricots simply because it smells like it just came from a bourbon barrel. They almost have that same phenolic/ fruity smell. The taste on the other hand bring out that rather distinct flavor of apricots. It melds nicely with the taste and aromas of the hops. All around it is a very fruity beer. The mouthfeel starts off rather smooth , then turns to a rather thick creamy feel. It is followed up by a slight hop bite that dries out the end of it. Leaves a very nice after taste. Very easy to drink. Should be made available for the summer months."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these during the summer heat, but the apricot flavors might become overwhelming. Overall, worth trying. I will revisit again next year, or when fresh batches hit stores."
"Though not something I would reach for often, I find nothing wrong with its execution. The texture of it is wonderful and the interplay of flavors makes it quite a treat. The apricot isn't as pronouced as I might have expected. To have originated from an IPA, I am somewhat surprised by the lack of hop bitterness. Its fairly well-balanced, but I expected a bit more of that snappy punch. Quite refreshing and enjoyable. Love the fact that brewers are walking out on the skinny limb to make something like this. An interesting brew that's certainly worth a try."
"Not quite the apricot flavor I was expecting, but a solid offering just the same. I think the beer would benefit from a slightly alter hop profile to offer something more citrusy to go with the fruit. All in all, not bad. I'm glad I've got the rest of the 4-pack to enjoy."
"This one is more of a fruit beer than an IPA. The hops are only found in the background. Still, it's a novel beer and one that can be enjoyed."
"Aprihop pours a sort of boring orange color, with a decent enough white head. Smell showed signs of oxidation in its sort of stale, peppery, almost carbonated smell. Whatever apricot that was in this beer seems to have completely vanished. All that is left are some weak hops, and a bit of grain. Body was medium, perhaps bordering on light. One was way more then enough for me. Im cursing the fact that I spent eight bucks for four of these. Sorry, but for dfh, this beer is sort of a disaster. Maybe I got a poor sample."
"D - This is OK. I may try it again at some point."
"Drinkability: I am impressed. DFH sometimes seems to focus too much on being on the cutting edge of what you can put into beer and less on making creative yet drinkable beers. This one is a good mix of ""different"" ingrediants and drinkability. I would like to try and egt some that is a little fresher to see how it compares."
"I don't know if the hops have dropped out at all, but this is a choice brew. I really like it now. The last time I had it, when it was first released, I was kinda ""meh"" about it. Still fresh after 6 months or so."
"Drinkability- This beer really grew on me. It was a bit strange at first, but it got better and better. Surprisingly malty- a character akin to the 90 minute IPA. Very much enjoyable and quaffable once you get used to it."
"Overall not bad. Nice carbonation, medium bodied. Comes in a four pack and that is perfect as six would be too many. I will drink the others and be happy."
"Unique says it all...apricot and hops, a combination I can't help but love even though I'm sure many would disagree. This pours a foggy orange hue with a nice foamy head. Smell is clearly fruity with apricot/peach/lemon present. At first you would expect the apricot flavor to be present, but it actually doesn't appear until the beer reaches room temp. First sip is more aggressive with hops than apricot. Towards the end the hops and apricot mix to make it a nice soft mouthfeel. A nice twist on a fruit beer."
"A funny combination of fruit and hop, which is well done, but not what I expected from an IPA."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Overall, quite spotty. I expected a little better."
"Kind of watery mouthfeel and very lightly carbonated. This is more like a wine spritzer than a fruit beer. Not my style."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a light amber-brown with a soapy looking two-finger head. Smell is of apricots and hops... go figure. Taste is initially slightly sweet and finishes pretty bitter with hops. There is a definite lingering aftertaste of apricots. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall I would say that this beer is drinkable, but not too much so."
"Props to MuenchenerKindl for providing this one."
"Drinkability: My friends love this beer, but it's not my favorite Dogfish Head. I've had it on tap in Gaithersburg and it was much better than in the bottle. I may need to review this again when I drink it on tap."
"Uncharacteristically friendly DFH brew (even my bitterness-averse girlfriend liked it), but an excellent one nonetheless."
"This isn't one of Dogfish Head's better beers, but it was still really good. The taste wasn't very apricotty, but the mouthfeel was. The smell was rather bland, and I was a little worried that this was seasonal, and my getting it in November spicked my curiosity (Is it seasonal?). Don't drink and review."
"This one definitely improved as it warmed."
"D - Abv is too high to be sessionable, but it is a pleasant beer. Good with food. A quality brew from dogfishhead. Personally, I think it would gain a lot if it weren't so heavily filtered."
"I am always excited to sample a new IPA when the chance arises. This one from Dogfish Head is another good offering. Not the cream of the crop for IPA's but a good brew nevertheless. Pours a nice clear orange color with a mild head. Smelled like sweet malt and some spice, also some orange peel maybe, might be the apricot though. Tastes like sweet malt, with hints of apricot, even though they were weak they were noticable. The hops were light in this brew (for an IPA) with the yeast coming through in the end and in the aftertaste. Very drinkable for an IPA, was craving another as soon as the first one went down."
"The color strikes me as being a malty orange color. Smell is a mixture of hops, yeast and apricot. I'm not sure if I like this combination for some odd reason. Taste is similar to an IPA with a touch of apricot sweetness on the back of the tongue but there is to much of a yeasty aftertase. I don't think the apricot flavor and the hop flavor mix well here. Certainly not there best offering."
"D: This is probably one of my least favorites from DFH. Could be a lot better."
"Another good offering from Dogfish Head. It could have had a stronger apricot flavor but overall it is a tasty beer."
"d - alcohol begins to come through nicely as it warms, i think this is a great spring transition beer and another good offering from DFH."
"Thanks nflmvp for another wonderful brew to try."
"Pour a bit hazy, but that's fine by me. Has a nice white head and retention. Smells of roasted caramel malts with a hint of apricots. The fruit comes out a little more in the flavor, and while its nice with the malt and hops, I still find it a bit odd. Definitely worth a try, but not my favorite."
"Not bad, but not my thing."
"This is a pretty interesting brew. I really disliked it at first - the mix of apricots and hops just didn't work for my taste buds - but it's grown on me. Don't let the bottle fool you, this doesn't really taste like an IPA with some apricots thrown in, it's much less hoppy than any reasonable IPA would be. This is a good thing, as it makes for a well-balanced beer, although a bit on the hoppy side when you compare it to, say, Magic Hat #9. Whether you like it or not will probably depend mostly on how much you like the taste of apricots and hops put together. Regardless, DFH have tried something different and managed to make a beer that, IMO, really balances its elements pretty well."
"drinability: 7% is nothing to notice in a beer, and this keeps my thoughts true, a true chugger, nice smooth and easy, if it were not for a SMALL hop build up on back to back chugs i would put this score higher"
"The beer poured a copper color with an off white head that left little lacing. The body was clear and no carbonation present. The aroma had a citrusy hops aroma with a back up of apricots that came in slightly. The taste of the beer followed suit but it wasn't a big of an IPA that the label made it seemed. It was rather lacking on the hops flavor. It had a hops front but the taste was rather weak. So was the apricot flavors. Maybe I had a bad bottle. The mouthfeel was bubble and semidry finish. The beer had a slight alcohol tingle in the mouth. The drinkability of this beer was alright but not impressive at all."
"Very big mouthfeel, an absolutely fantastic beer, one of DFH's finest."
"	Excellent blend to compliment the style also."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- maybe"
"very nice amber color pours with a one inch head that does not last very long. nice mouthfeel slight hoppy taste but the apricot flavor comes right through. slightly sweet sugar taste. very enjoyable beer would definitely buy again and often even though the price is a little high."
"D - It's drinkable enough, but too bland for me to buy it for the novelty. To me, a rare miss for DFH. But a great effort."
"Apricots dominate this delicious IPA giving it a semi sweet finish. Great for just sitting back and sipping. Another one of Dogfish Head's excellent, hand crafted brews. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love this brewery and their unique beer styles."
"Apricot = a fruit bearing tree native to China and a relative to the plum."
"This is a beer that I would serve to all my friends then make them pay for the next one."
"12oz. bottle. Poured a gold-amber in color with a little haze. Large light tan head formed. Aroma was hops, pine & grapefruit variety, and molasses. Taste was similar, with hops coming first, followed by some malt/sweetness in the middle. Hops were citrus at start and floral at the finish. Apricots never made an appearance in either the aroma or the taste. Body was medium, as was the carbonation. This beer was OK, but nothing special. Many better IPA's in my opinion."
"This is a smooth exciting beer. It's a crazy step in a weird direction but I like it. It works for me. Thank you Sam and all of the DFH people."
"D: Mmmm Im done and am going to get another one right now. This is an addictive beer. Being a football Sat, I will finish the four pack tonight for sure..."
"Pours a lovely carmel amber, with golden highlights through out. Decent head not too aggressive, but present. The smell is of mild bitter hops, carmel, apricots and a hint of cinnamon. The taste is exceptional, clean, refreshing and tasty. The fruit presence is behind the IPA flavor. It is no wimpy fruit beer. Honestly it's thus far my favorite fruit beer. The bitter hops and spices are present as well as notes of carmel and apricot. This is a excellent sessional beer, super great for summer Thanks Dog fishhead."
"How could I not try this one? Being such a Dogfish Head fan, I was impressed to find this in Chicago, on tap no less. Just went with a taster (for only a dollar!). This one did not do it for me. Although the apricots were apparent in the smell, it was very flat tasting and nothing to be impressed about. I like the effort and I'll probably try this again, but I even had trouble drinking the whole 4 ounces this past time."
"The color is unmistakably amber with a rocky white head. Scents of fruit and floral hops eminate from the glass. At first sip I notice its full body and fruity malt character. As it washes down the back of my throat the hops grab the sides of my mouth and tongue. All the while the apricots provide a nice refreshing balance. Not very bitter but still good brew. Refreshing and complex."
"I have to admit that I avoided this beer for a while. I frankly had little interest in an apricots and beer. But this is an excellent IPA. If there are apricots in this brew, it is subtle and blends nicely with the hops. Pours a beautiful orange-amber. The smell is a nice floral and fruity hop aroma with malt sweetness - apricots are there, but nicely so. The taste is also good, with more complexity, if a little flat. Ends with a dry finish. Good mouthfeel, and drinkable for sure. This is a very solid and refreshing IPA, and I would enjoy it more often if it weren't for the high price."
"Pours deep amber with an real nice off-white head. Smell is exactly as expected, apricots and hops. Taste is pretty much the same, nice medium hop with a touch of apricots. In truth I think the taste could be bolder, but as is drinkability is prety high. Actually, as it warms, the apricot flavor does become more prominant. Mouthfeel is slighly watery, but somehow a little chewy at the same time. Overall, I'm not a huge IPA fan, but I really liked this one."
"This beer pours an orange amber with a frothy white head that holds nicely with little lacing. The smell is as expected fruity and hoppy. It is quite interesting. The taste is a mirror of the smell with the fruity apricot flavor coming out more as it warms. The mouthfeel is good, as expected for what it is. Overall, a good beer, one I wouldnt say no to again."
"Drinkability: Creative idea, but this one didn't really grab me. I simply found it to be a bit wanting in both categories: IPA bitterness and apricots."
"Remarkably balanced and thirst-quencing! This is a fantastic beer, probably my favorite regular offering from Dogfish Head."
"This is a very refreshing drink on a hot summer day, and a very tasty treat. This would make a good session beer on a hot and humid summer day or night. Ill be drinking many more of these if i get my way."
"Couldn't identify the apricots but did notice a sweetness (fruity?) to go along with the malt flavor. This one poured a clear amber color with a medium sized white head that faded fast. Left good lacing on the glass. Nothing definite in the aroma other than malt. The taste was pretty good, sweetness, malty and balanced with a little bitterness. Tastes like more like an English Pale Ale. Mouthfeel is rich. I was not totally impressed with this beer. It is good, but nothing I would seek out, especially with 7% ABV. Anything that strong should be more memorable. 7% is a bit much to make this a session beer."
"Overall Impression: I mean, I wouldn't say IPA. A little sweeter than I was expecting it to have been. A little surprised, but I actually enjoyed this beer. A great concept, wonderful complexity and very enjoyable. Defiantly had the ""Dogfish Head"" flavor."
"Poured darker amber,almost reddish with white head. Smells like hops, malt and apricot fruitiness. Taste is malty sweetness and fruit with quite a bit of hop bitterness. This is medium bodied and very drinkable. I was expecting more of the apricot, but the blend works. This is worth a try."
"Poured a cloudy orange color with a semi-thick head. Certainly smells like an IPA, but with a sidekick of apricot and spice. Goes down surprisingly smooth, considering the somewhat higher 7%. I was anticipating this to taste somewhat like Magic Hat 9; I would say the 9 is easier to drink, but this definitely hits the spot. I enjoy sipping this much more."
"Overall: My only real beef with this beer was the label proclaiming ""India Pale Ale"". This is without a doubt closer to an American Amber than an IPA. I think too much hop character would definitely ruin the apricot flavor, so that was a good call, but then why not call it an amber ale? Still good beer, one of the best non-lambic fruit beers I have had."
"Decently drinkable, but I like to savor the flavors with one at a time, but that's just me."
"The sight of this beer is a good sign that it is nearly summertime again. The beer poured a orange, almost red color with a nice off white head and good lacing on the glass. The body is nicely carbonated with little bubbles running to the top to get air. The nose gives you some sweet malt tones and a touch of fruit aroma along with some hop character as well. The taste does not provide an overly hoppy character but rather a sweet malt taste that gives you a touch of apricot flavor and other fruit and spice notes. The body is medium and I find this to be a very drinkable beer."
"A faint hint of a metallic taste keeps me from placing this beer among my favorites, but I'll definately be buying a bit more."
"Got this as a sample. It pours a nice tan colour with a thick 3 finger head that settles down to a nice lace. On the nose is a hoppiness balaced by a sweet apricot in the background. The taste is a wonderful mingling of apricots, hops and malt in almost perfect balance. The finish however veers off into a more pungent hop bitterness. I would have to say this was one of the better brews I've tasted in a long time. It has anexcellent balance and an almost wine like characteristic. The only drawback is cost, however this is beer to be enjoyed not swilled."
"recommended in 2006."
"I got this in a 4-pack of bottles and have had it a couple of times. Pours quite a bit darker than your standard IPA with a gigantic head. Once a few sips the head all but disappears. Apricot flavor is amazing, much better than Magic Had #9 (one of my first craft brews) and finishes with a crisp kick of hops. Even though the alcohol percentage is high at 7%, I could easily drink the entire four pack in one sitting. It's good - I'm going to miss this seasonal once the summer is over."
"This beer pours with a darker than average IPA color. Dark amber with a tiny head. Nose and taste are pretty much the same. Both remind me far too much of baby asprin with mild hops. This is a chore to drink. I applaude DFH for trying this but the mixture just is not good. I can't help but think of children's tylenol. It really ruins my beer."
"D: There is a decent amount of alcohol in this beer, but you wouldnt know it. Decent overall, but somewhat dull. Could be very refreshing on a hot day."
"Notes: Guess the easy comparison is a Magic Hat #9. I think this one is more intensely-flavored than the latter. Regardless, an interesting brew and a nice choice in the hot weather."
"nice hop bitterness. would be a solid IPA on its own, but then has the added flavor of the apricots which is nice and dry. if you have stayed away from fruit beers because they are too sweet, then this is a good one to try. I really like the fact that this fruit beer is very understated and you arent blown away by apricots."
"A very drinkable but complex brew. Has a faint but noticeable nose of apricots and hops. Pours golden with a nice but not overwhelming head. Has an intriguing taste of Apricot fruit followed by bitter almond/apricot pit that immediately transitions into a medium hop bitterness. The transition from fruit to the melded bitterness of pit and hops is what makes this beer sublime."
"For anyone who has thought about trying this, don't be put off by the idea of apricots in this beer. If you like a good IPA and don't mind a mild (make that very mild) fruitiness to your beer, then pick one up when you have a chance. By way of comparison, I'd love to try one of these on draft."
"This beer poured a dark gold color with a 1 finger head that left good lacing on the side of the glass. Aroma was flowery and hoppy with a faint whiff of peaches/apricots in the nose. Taste was a good blending of maltiness and spicy hops with the fruitiness of apricots. As the beer warmed the taste of apricot became more evident. For a medium bodied beer, the mouthfeel was pretty smooth. This is a nice beer for summertime drinking, not too extreme and not boring at the same time. Less of an IPA(as the label states)and more of a fruit beer. Could be a session beer except for the fairly high ABV."
"Pours a clear amber with no head. Slight, sugary apricot aroma in the nose, but nothing as fruit forward as I expected. The nose gives off an expectation of creaminess. On the palate, hop bitterness crops up first, followed by fruity smoothness and a mild flavor. The finish is a bit apricoty and sticky, but overall this beer does not have a very big apricot component -- it's much less than the fruit component in some other DFH beers. I was surprised by this one -- it's less a fruit beer than a fruity IPA. Very flavorful, very smooth and creamy a la the DFH house style, and pretty well balanced."
"D: Very average beer, I don't think the brewer really accomplished what they were aiming for in this brew. I might try it again, but don't count on it..."
"Clear copper with slow, steady carbonation rising up to a fluffy, peach-tinged off-white head. Somewhat weak aromas: apricot, of course, with some subdued floral/piney hops, and something sort of phenolic as well. The taste only barely hints at the presence of apricots. Overall, it's something of a clash of flavors: assertive pine-flavored hops are being smothered by some tart fruit flavors that, finally in the aftertaste, reveal themselves to be apricot. There's also a damn near cloying sweetness that seems to be coming from a heavy malt presence, not the fruit. The mouthfeel is likewise heavier than I'd prefer -- there doesn't seem to be much reason for this beer to be boozed up to 7% abv, but I'm not a brewer, so what do I know. Anyway, happy I tried it, but I think I'll pass next time."
"Mouthfeel- A good mix between fruity sweet and bitter."
"The tase is surprising. Don't go in expecting a fruit beer. This beer benefits from the slight apricot flavors and the goodness of a dogfish ipa. Taste of fruit, sweet malt, and hops. As with all other dogfish brews, this one is well balanced. A step above the 30-minute and better in my opion. If you like the 90 minute, you'll probably enjoy this one as well."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a bubbly head, good retention and nice lacing. Aroma is biscuity, hoppy, spicy and a hint of dried apricots. Flavor is like a fruit sweetened Fat Tire with the biscuit malt predominating. Hops provide a nice bitterness, though nothing like an IPA. Fruit is subdued, and finishes sweet. This is a very complex beer, enjoyable, easy to drink. Carbonation is appropriate, mouthfeel is smooth. I would like to see a bit more sweetness for a fruit beer, but otherwise it's quite nice."
"Overall, not my style, but I knew that going into it, which is why I only bought one. As far as apricot beers are concerned, this one was the best I have had. To me these types of beers remind me of, you guessed it, Magic Hat #9, even though recently I was told by some dudes form Magic Hat that they do not use apricots in #9, or any fruit at all, hard to believe."
"A citrusy and of course, apricot aroma. Tastes of apricots, obviously. Smooth and a bit oily, just way to soda pop sweet for any real drinkablity. Seems to be too much of a gimic brew. I wouldnt turn one down if offered for free, but Im not buying anymore, either."
"Aprihop pours a copper color with a fluffy white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is very hoppy, I'm not sure I can pick up any apricot in the smell. Not exactly what I was expecting taste wise. The hops seem tamer than I expected. You can taste the apricot in the finish, but it does not overwhelm. Actually quite good, but I was expecting hoppier. This is a nicely balanced beer, which I find very appealing. Recommended."
"D - high, again the best fruit beer i have ever had, very drinkable and very easy down, a non-craft drinker would love this as well"
"The Aprihop pours a copper color, very clear with about a 1/2 inch off-white head. A decent amount of lace remains on the glass after drinking it. The smell is mainly of apricots, with some bread, malt and hops in there too. A lot of flavor hit me at once with this beer. There was the initial apricot taste, then a sour/bitter grapefruit hoppy taste soon after, with a bit of sweetness after the bitterness. Very surprising, in a good way. The mouthfeel is creamy, light/medium and slightly oily. It goes down relatively easy, it's a well balanced beer. In my opinion it's another good beer from DFH. I'd recommend it to others, and I would drink it again."
"I could stand to have a few of these, but I don't think I could spend an evening with a few of these like I could with a hellesbock or pilsner."
"I could drink a few of these, but will be spending my $$$ on other DFH offerings (60,90,120-yum!) instead."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: Kudos for effort, but for me this one falls really short. The baked apricot flavors are too over the top and over take the hop bitterness too much. A fruit IPA? I'd like a little more IPA and this would be good."
"I was a little skeptical of an apricot beer because of my past disappointments with fruit beers, but DFH has a winner here, the combination of sweetness from the apricots and the bitterness of the hops is very nicely balanced. This is a great beer for mixing things up every once in a while."
"I think this is one of the better fruit beers I've had. I think it's because it has more hop flavor than the others I've tried. I'd have it again, it's a pretty good beer."
"A creamy mouthfeel helps bring this sweet, fruity, unsual IPA on home. It's not the kind of left-of-center I usually appreciate from DFH, but it's different enough to drink when the regular IPAs, no matter how good, start tasting the same."
"Pours amber. One finger head,with very good retention,and lacing.Smell is of hops and fruit. Very nice. Body is fairly light,with some carbionation.Taste is unique. Smooth,with a hops start,and a fruit finish.Very intresting little bottle. Recommended!"
"Bottom line: looking for a 90 Minute that you can have more than one of? This is your brew."
"The label described this as an IPA with apricots and this is exactly what it smelled and tasted like. Crisp, clean with nice apricot flavors not hidden or sublte but not over the top like a New Glarus. Long dry, almost oakey, aftertaste. As it warmed the flavors came together very well which speaks to the quality of this beer. Yum. Part of my XBIF box of goodies."
"Over all, I enjoyed this beer. I had it after a long day of work on a warm spring day, and it was the way to end the night!!"
"The apricot is really understated considering the beers name, but it is tasty none the less. Also, the dryness of this beer was prominent, but it didnt get carried away. Over all, this was just really easy to drink."
"A very nice and drinkable beer. Good with a light meal."
"Overall, I wasn't that impressed with this beer. I was expecting more of an apricot flavor, and a bit sweeter beer. I wasn't bad, but it was disappointing. I'll pass on this the next time."
"I'm impressed all the way around with this one. Good beer and very drinkable. I'm really starting to love this beer you call DFH."
"This beer poured a clear copper with a 1/2"" white head and very active carbonation. The smell has apricots, some other citrus hops and a nice malty background. The taste is dominated by the biscuity malt with a good hop bite and not as much of the apricots as the smell would indicate. It has a medium light mouthfeel, and is refreshing. Not one flavor stands out they all work together, I think I would like a bit more apricot in the taste."
"Randallized, this was not my favorite beer ever. It was a pretty rusty color with nice head and lacing, reminding me of the bottled version. However, the nose and taste were... bland. Now, I know there were apricots in with the beer, so maybe they sucked in all the flavor and left the beer kind of boring? I don't know, but it was definitely lacking, and not that apricot-y! There was a bit of a biscuity thing and fruity thing going on, but it was dull. Mouthfeel was watery and felt pretty flat. All that being said, I could have a couple of these, but not too many- it's just not what the bottle is."
"Nice copper color with a steady stream of carb. Head drops to a thin film quickly. No lacing. Smell of appricot but I think that is only due to anticipating it due to the name. Really very subtle. Taste is sweet malt up front followed by the appricot. After that a nice hops bite comes through. Just a hint of alcohol comes though in the finish. This is a nice beer and better than I was expecting."
"D: Very drinkable."
"I think this is a pretty drinkable beer."
"This poured a pink-gold with a large white foamy head. It left good lacing and had good retention. The aroma was unmistakable; apricot, obviously. But other sweet fruits were present, maybe strawberry? Malts and mild hop presence. Much of the same in the taste. Apricot and sweet fruits, citrus, malts and alcohol follow. Maybe some wheat, biscuit and caramel. It had an overall mouthfeel that I enjoyed, and I'm not a big fruit beer kinda guy. It was sweet but not syrupy, hoppy but not bitter. Almost buttery aftertaste, lingering on the tongue. Very well balanced which I think is key in making this style. Too often a mild inbalance in flavor and feel makes the difference between a drinkable fruit beer and one you toss out. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability is way above the competition. Thumbs up! MK"
"Bottled on 2/22/06:Pours a slightly cloudy orangish-amber, with thin beige head that dissapates quickly (i messed up the pour so ill give this beer the benefit of the doubt. The aroma is initially very fruity with a freshly picked apricot nose, as well as some citrus and piney hops, caramel sweetness, fruity esters and a touch of alcohol. The flavor also starts out with a fresh apricot note, along with some orange and lemon, citrusy and piney hops, honey, toasted bread and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium and not too thick like some IPAs, and drinkability is very good. A good beer, unfortunately it's been sitting in my cellar a couple months and the hops have diminished and this beer has lost some of it's character."
"I generaly dont like fruit beers, but i dug this one. definitely will buy again."
"Otherwise, belly up!"
"Drinkability: DFH never ceases to amaze me. I'm usually not a big fan of fruity beers, but Aprihop is the exception. A big, hoppy and fruity ale. Plenty of hop bitterness that is offset with the big apricot sweetness. An easy drinker, with well hidden alcohol, howeve, not a session type beer. Seek out and enjoy another fine beer from DFH."
"Overall- nice! Good! I drank this down quickly. A definite summer 6er! Could be considered a girlie beer but it is sitting at 7%."
"Overall: A nice alternative take on the IPA, well balanced and definitely recommended."
"Pours clear, mahogany-copper color. great head to it. Up front aroma of apricot upon pouring. After a minute or two, the aroma is lost. At first sip, there is a hint of apricot but like the smell, fades away. Cream texture and good mouthfeel. Good clean hop finish but for being billed as an apricot beer, a bit disappointing. Good beer none-the-less. Just not what I expected."
"Overall, a good experience...another fine stretch for Dogfish Head.b"
"I wouldn't call this a ""serious India Pale Ale"" at all. Definitely more like a serious fruit beer."
"D: Man, it sure is an interesting beer. Very intense on the palate for a fruit beer. Its not the fruit beer that I would give to a newbie, but maybe a more sophisticated advocate could enjoy. Would I buy it again? Maybe, but not if there is a Burton Baton or 60 Minute sitting next to it."
"Sampled through dnrobert24 and 2MBBIF."
"Aprihop is an interesting experience, one that I would recommend anyone try at least once. Pours a deep amber/orange color from the bottle into a pint glass - small head, which dissipates quickly leaving a bit of lacing. Smells like fruity alcohol, but not necessarily apricot. Taste beings with a floral hoppiness and segues into an apricot finish that is just awesome. As it warms, the apricot becomes even more pronounced. Great stuff."
"Could easily drink a few of these but not sure I would choose too. Would like to try next year's batch too see how it differs. This was an '06"
"12 oz bottle, poured into a Dogfish pint glass, a nice clear copper with a finger of off-white head,scant retention but moderate lacing. Nose is a very light apricot fruitiness along with some herbal hops. Taste is nice apricot infused malt, subtle on the fruit and not at all cloying, with a gentle hop finish. Slight fruitiness lingers on the aftertaste, leaving you wanting more. Mouthfeel is medium with a creamy feel. Overall, this is an excellent fruit beer, a solid pale ale with a nice amount of apricot added, good for a hot sunny day."
"I usually down these too quickly, because they're so yummy, but there's decent complexity here, and the taste lingers long on the tongue."
"Hadn'een this before, so I guess it's a seasonal release. I guess it's worth a try if you've never had it, but not a beer I'd take seriously. It's an orange color with a small head. It has a sweet, fruity (yes, apricot) odor, and a fruity (apricot again) taste. There's also a fair amount of hoppiness. It's somewhat robust, although not in a pleasant way. Try it, but don't make it a steady date."
"Very drinkable with the proper alcohol by volume and not-overdone flavors. It's a good IPA to have many of. I actually think I'd buy it again if I were looking for a six pack to knock down in one night or to introduce to new drinkers."
"Overall, this is a great, highly drinkable spring/summer release. This would be perfect for relaxing on a hot muggy evening. Aprihop is what early Friday evening in summer tastes like."
"Thanks to wingnutter for another great trade."
"Man what a drinkable beer, if it weren't for the price of these bad boys and the fact that they come in a 4 pack I could just keep putting em back"
"I loved this beer last year; last year's batch seemed slightly thicker, hoppier and way lighter in color. This year's batch tastes really bad to me. Its darker and way too sweet, like maple syrup sweet. It appeared more watery too. The apricot taste is still there but the sickly sweetness of the maple flavor overpowers the slight tart taste of the apricot, and overpowers the hops, which are barely noticable. I will try it again out of a bottle, maybe it was a bad keg."
"Entirely inoffensive, and a potential quaffer... not too shabby for a 7% brew. DFH constantly impresses me with their innovativeness, but I think this one was a touch off mark, although still pretty solid."
"a great spring offering. Its fresh and fruity taste with its super clear orangish hue just make me think of spring, why is Maibock a spring offering, I'm sure someone will chime in. For a fruity beer the smells are not overdone at all, the apricot taste is evident but you must let the carbonation dissipate and the beer to warm to really have a large explosion of apricots. Hops are detectable but not the most prominent flavor of this one."
"Bottled on 2/20/06, as printed on the neck"
"As usual for Dogfish the nose screams of hops. A little piney and very fruitey. The apricots jump out and are well balanced with other aromas. Very smoothe tasting with a nice finish. This just feels pleasant going down and could be a nice session beer. It gets my thumbs up."
"Lovely clear orange body with a thick, lasting, creamy, and luscious talcum head. Strong almost juniper like pine sap aroma. Apricot is light and subtle in the nose. Taste is quite neat. This beer manages to be extremely hoppy without being bitter in any way. The apricot is hardly noticeable for me. I almost dont consider this a fruit beer. Finish is acidic and spicy but hardly bitter. Could be a touch more dry. Overall I find this very reminiscent of a good English India Pale Ale."
"Mouthfeel is fairly full. Starts out quite smooth until it carbonation and hop bitterness shows up. This is a pleasant, interesting, tasty beer perfect for the Springtime. Drinkable, but the 7% is felt (not tasted, though). Nothing mind-blowing but definitely recommended. This was about $8 for a 4-pack."
"This was worth a try once, but I would certainly not let anyone unaccustomed to a fruit beer start off with this. I think apricot would go better with a wheat ale/hefeweizen style of beer if I had to put the two characteristics together. I'll still try Dogfish Head's other offerings in the future, but sadly, they missed the mark with this one..."
"M & D: Good mouthfeel. Smooth and silky--goes down quite easily. Definately a drinkable beer, but more for the summer than the winter as it could be very refreshing on a hot day. Nice change of pace from DFH, but it wouldn't be my first choice."
"I tend to think of this kind of ale as a dessert beer. But this one is the tops IMHO."
"D - Disappointing. One of the few Dogfish Head products that completely misses the mark. Far too much alcohol for what should be a light fruit beer. Completely lacking what all fruit beers should have - a good scent! Overcarbonated. And an overall taste that doesn't know where it's headed. Not something that I would drink again."
"Taste is clearly led by the hops, but not overly so as previous reviews had made me believe. Begins with a sweet hop character followed with a dry finish that brings in that apricot hint I was waiting for. This mildly carbonated brew has left almost no lacing on the glass, and has a watery mouthfeel that helps it go down easy. This distinct apricot finish is unlike any other beer I've had. Interesting offering here by one of my favorite breweries, give it a try."
"A nice and drinkable beer with a fruity twist on the IPA."
"Mouthfeel/drinkablility: This beer had a great mouth feel wonderful balance between fruit and hops, ample carbonation, and these things made the mouthfeel almost perfect. Because of the combination this fruit beer is much more drinkable than most. I did not quite see that this was a ""fruit beer for hop heads"" as dogfish boasts...it definitely had more hops than most, but it was a little deceiving."
"D - A little hoppy for an easy drinking beer, but I would have this beer again."
"drinkability: very drinkable, abv well disguised"
"I had this on-tap at both the brewery and the brewpub in Rehoboth. Pours a deep orange with with about a fingers worth of off white head that leaves very little lacing. The smell is quite fruity at first but after a couple of hearty inhales the hops come through. Fruity, flowery hops. The taste wasn't as strong as you may have expected. Yes, you do taste the apricots but it complements the hops instead of overpowering them. A nicely balanced brew. Fruit beer for us that enjoy hops."
"This beer reminds me of a lager. The color is a nice deep orangish golden. The head was minimal. The smell is somewhat hoppy with hints of fruit. The taste is slightly bitter with a small amount of bite left over. The mouthfeel is smooth at first and then gets a little too bitter at the end. There is a bitter aftertaste that stays for a while. The drinkability would be fair. I could drink these again but it is not a beer I would go out of my way for. Possibly this is just the style though."
"Sam and the gang at DFH have scored an unconventional and unexpected hit with Aprihop."
"On tap at Logan's Alley...This beer was a bit darker than I had expected. It was nearly brown but dark copper will do it justice. The head was small. Lacing was minimal. The nose was a mostly fruity one. I mean fuity in the way of apricots, not hop citrus bouquet. I myself was a bit disappointed that this thing was seemingly light in the hops category. If you put hops in the name it should be hopped up. False advertising. It was basically just a fruit juice smellin beer. Strange and unique. The nose had me excited to taste the beer, but the flavour was just lacking any kind of balls. It was just like a beer with some fruit addiitives in it. A bit weak at that. The hop profile again was none too intense in the flavour. One thing I can say to this brew's credit is that it never approached even an idea of being cloying or over sweet. The fruity flavours were perhaps done just richly enough to avoid any possible offense. Mouthfeel was light and the drinkability was actually alright for the style. Just not much going on, or not as much as I had expected. Worth a try. I will be picking up a bottle to dissect a bit more. The pub is generally not where I do my best work."
"Poured an attractive orange tinted copper color with very little white head that left light white lacing. Smells richly of citrus and floral hops, apricots (hence the name), slightly spicy. Taste is more subdued than the aromas, which is suprising, expected much more apricot/citrus flavors. Mainly consists of balanced malt and hop flavors with earthy undertones of fruit and citrus. Lighter bodied with lighter carbonation, a little rough on the tongue, leaves a slight grapefruit bitter aftertaste. Very light and drinkable, refreshing brew. Would purchase again, would be very good in the summer."
"Even with a very rugged pour the head is next to nothing. The beer is a golden brown that smells of sharp apricots and hops. Strong hop flavor with the apricots hiding beneath. The apricots start to come out from hiding after a few sips. Unlike other fruit beers, this one is not overpowering. The high alcohol content is masked by the hops and apricot flavors. A little bit of raisin in there too. A very enjoyable beer but I paid 14 dollars for just a 4 pack. While this is a good beer I don't think I will be picking it up again."
"My pour had a high carbonation level which lead to a tall head. This turned out to be good as it gave me a good chance to take in the aromas. I was hoping for more apricot in the aroma, but that fell a little short. The first few drinks didn't detect any apricot flavors. However, after the 3rd sip, the flavors really started to come through. The apricot is not in your face and is nicely balanced with the citrusy hops. It is very drinkable even at 7% alcohol. This is a great beer if one assumes the goal was to add a slight hint of fruit to an IPA."
"Golden copper in color with very little head. Slightly citric aroma with hints of apricot and a little yeasty spiciness. The flavor has some hoppy bitterness, with traces of apricot that mostly showed up in the aftertaste. Both came out more as it warmed. Medium bodied and well carbonated. This would make a really refreshing beer for a hot summer day."
"this was enjoyed straight outta the bottle on a hot as anything july afternoon. so as far as appearance goes, i can only assume it looked good. hence my rating. i wanna be fair. smell was surprisingly not as apricot as one would expect by the name. the hops smell was very dominant. the taste was awesome. a very balanced blend of apricot, hops, and alcohol. very refreshing. mouthfeel was pretty nice. crisp, refreshing and had me wanting more. the drinkablity was pretty high. i mean i had 2 four packs of it, so need i say more?"
"Overall. great beer. I'm not sure i will have many cravings for this one, but it is definetly a treat to have."
"This pours a dark coppery color with a large creamy head that leaves nice lacing.The aroma is a floral typical IPA scent with some hops and citrus,I could not tell if this was apricots.The taste is OK,but it's not too hoppy,and it's not really all that fruity.If this wasn't called ""Aprihop"" I wouldn't be able to tell if it had any citrus flavor in it.I'm a little disappionted in this.The m/f is medium with a nice well balanced feel.This is a good beer,but its not really the way it's advertised,I expected a little more hops and citrus flavor.But it is worth trying."
"Basically: this isn't a bad IPA, but it didn't deliver enough apricots to impress me."
"It is worth a try, do not be scared off by the word apricot, as they are not overpowering."
"Good mouthfeel, nothing lingering, definitely not thin. Just solid. Very drinkable. I'll get this again."
"Taste; initially citrusy hops, followed by the apricots, and finished with a solid malt backbone. I'm not a real big fan of ""fruit"" beers, so I was pleased that the apricots were not overwhelming. I'm an IPA fan, and this one was very interesting. I'm glad I picked up a four pack of this while in Maryland."
"12 oz. with no freshness date. An IPA brewed with real apricots. Pours a coppery/rusty color with a thin head that leaves a collar throughout. Smells of bready malts, apricots, grapefruit hops, and a big sweetness. Grapefruit hops in the flavor leave a medium bitterness that gradually intensifies, and the bready/dark malts contribute just as much sweetness and a bit of molasses. The apricots hide in the back the whole time and on occasion I can taste the alcohol. By the end of the glass the sweetness is almost cloying, but that is the only real complaint here. It has a medium body that becomes very smooth. An interesting beer. The fruits aren't overpowering - it tastes more like a malty IPA than anything. I would probably drink this again."
"DFH does it again."
"The color is somewhere between copper and amber with a thick head of average height. The aroma has a strong fruity aroma of apricot with a touch of hoppy zest. The flavor is a full-bodied mixture of dark malts and apricot flavor. Very interesting for a beer and definently something that every beer fan needs to try. A bit of citrus twang lurks within the bolder malt and apricot flavors. I definently see this as a fruit beer because there isn't much of an IPA flavor here. As for drinkability, I'd definently drink this again, but I don't think I'd want more that a few in a session."
"It's only comes in a four pack so you can't drink too many unless you get two but that could be a bit pricey."
"The body is moderate but the sweetness lingers and gives it a bit more perception. Overall limited apricot and hops but very drinkable."
"The bitterness is at the perfect level for an IPA. Enough to let you know they are there and gives a good hit of bitterness, but doesn't make your tongue curl up whilst covering up other flavors. The finish is a bit dry with a great apricot and hop... errrm, apri-hop flavor in the finish. One of my favorite offerings from DFH so far."
"Fantastic beer and one I'll surely recommend to others. I was reluctant going in as I'm not one to actively seek out IPAs and I've been disappointed in the past by another apricot beer (by Pyramid). I sure was scared for nothing because this is, even w/out the novelty of the apricot, a beastly IPA. 7% ABV not such a bad bonus. If the price tag wasn't so high, I'd buy it more often. This went very well with a big bowl of red beans, rice and sausage."
"This beer is very, very good but I'd only buy one, they sell it in 4 packs, but I wouldn't get it unless you were sharing with a group. I implore you to try this beer if you haven't"
"Pours an attractive amber/golden color with a finger of khaki head, no real lacing to speak of. Nose is quite strong, floral, piney hops and sweeter fruit. Flavor picks up with the nose, bitter piney hops, the faintest malt and a sweet apricot note at the end to even it out a bit. As an IPA it obviously leans toward the hops, the apricot is much more subtle than I would have guessed, but I'm glad as I can tell my beer palate has matured and I can handle the hoppiness better than I used to. Nice substantial body, good carbonation. Pretty drinkable for a fruit IPA. I might be a little more open-minded toward the pale stuff. Another quality brew from DFH."
"This brew poured a deep golden color, with an orange huge to it. Off white head, thick and creamy left a thin lace to the end. Aroma is of citrus, malty bread notes and the sweet hint of the apricot. Taste is a bitter citrus hop rush with the malt joining in the middle mixed with a slight sweetness of the fruit and a bitter hops finish. Nothing to over the top. I was expecting more of a fruit rush but it turned out to be another good IPA from DFH. It is well balanced, medium body and good drinkability."
"overall: i love how dogfish head experiments and pushes the envelope for new and exciting beers and styles. however, this beer missed the boat a little in my opinion. i may just have a problem with fruit beers and others may love this try, but i am happy to have tried this once. not bad, but not great."
"Very clear, orange/amber with a thin stand of dark cream coloured head. Some lacing and good retention. Plenty of aroma, with caramel malt, fruity apricots, floral and spicy hops, along with a bit of alcohol. Full, slightly viscous body with carbonation that's well integrated, leaving you with very fine bubbles and no harshness. Caramel malt sweetness throughout, with mellow apricot and moderate bitterness rounding things out at the end. Some pine hop flavour part-way through. Dryish hop finish with lingering apricot and a bit of alcohol warmth. A fruit beer that's definitely above average. I really liked how the apricots only form part of the character, rather than overpowering everything. Nicely balanced!"
"A moderate body and delicate carbonation. Smooth and tasty brew, but I wouldn't be able to drink more than one"
"A very good fruit beer, one I'd gladly have again, but I'd hold off on the ""Fruit IPA"" label. Not from the brewery that gave us 60, 90, 120 Minute IPAs. It's more hoppy fruit beer than fruit ipa, at least with DFH standards."
"Pours a copper-golden hue with a vibrant, half-inch white head. Nice aroma of rich, roasted caramel malt, some brown sugar, a touch of hops, and a whiff of apricot. Palate is malty and sweet up front, developing a mild hoppiness towards the back of the mouth. Undertones of apricot and brown sugar throughout. Mouthfeel is rich, smooth, and creamy. Not quite as excellent as I was perhaps expecting, but it is still very pleasant."
"I'm not usually a big fan of fruit flavoured beer, but this is one that was definitely done right. The strong bitterness of the hops helps balance out the sweetnet of the fruit flavours. A good mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. I found it to be a great refreshing beer."
"Pours an orange color with not much head that is leaving minimal lacing. Nose is slightly puctuated with the apricot, not much else notable from there. Taste is very interesting as it starts slightly malty, then the light apricot flavor hits, followed by a blast of hops at the finish. The mouthfeel is beautifully creamy and full. Overall drinkability is near perfect. This is a great experiment that I will try again!"
"A fabulous beer, fruit beer or not. Dogfish just does it right. This beer promises greatness leaping from the bottle, sparkling and a copper orange. Good head retention and lacing. It smell boldly of an IPA and that subtle apricot fruit smell. I get more pears and peaches out of this than expected. It' s as spicy and hoppy in flavor and bitter as you'd expect from an IPA with a thin delicate sweetness from the fruits. A slight metalic mouthfeel keeps this beer from perfection. A terrific blend of agressivness in the hops and a delicacy from the fruits. I could drink this all day."
"Overall, a rather one dimensional beer lacking in even the gimmicky fruit addition. Not recommended."
"Exceptionally drinkable. I could drop one of these any time, any place. I wanted a second one as soon as I had finished the first. I really have to recommend this beer as a great summertime addition to anyone's beerfridge. Don't pass this one up if you see it in the cooler."
"Pours dark-orange color with little carbonation and very little head that's just on the edge of the glass. Smell is that of apricots and malts. Mouthfeel is great, with perfection carbonation and is very smooth, almost creamy. Taste is close to perfect for an IPA with fruit flavor. The fruit and bitterness is perfectly balanced. Drinkability is above average and anyone that enjoys IPA's and fruit beers will enjoy this. I'd still pick Pyramid Apricot Ale over this, but I still think this is quality beer."
"Pours a clear orange-amber color with a foamy white head that has a pretty nice retention. Ripe apricots are present in the aroma (as one would expect) along with scents of fresh pine. Lots of sweet malt in the taste both initially and in the middle along with an apricot fruitiness followed by some citrusy notes and bitter oily hop resins. Its not often you find a really good fruit beer, but thats exactly whats to be had here."
"Taste is very much like a traditional IPA, just a hint of apricot flavor mixed in with the hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Another solid IPA offering from Dogfish Head."
"Overall: Aprihop is one of my top 10 favorite beers, ever. This is very strange because I generally don't enjoy fruit beers. However, while most fruit beers (and many IPA's) are exercises in excess, Aprihop is an ode to balance. The apricots lend this beer such a gentle and distinctive taste, nestling in between the malt and hops beautifully. To me, it is as close to the perfect IPA as I have found, and one of the few beers that I find myself coming back to again and again."
"This was a very drinkable beer, very balanced. The aroma alone was worth it."
"The beer pours as an amber beer with good clarity. The smell was almost pure IPA, with nice floral notes and some grain, but the apricots were just barely noticeable. Very nice. The taste is a lot more fruity than I was expecting, and there is a pleasing apricot note there, but, like the smell, the apricot seems to be applied with a moderate hand, and doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the beer, and the hops and grain are still very strong. Mouthfeel is a bit dry, moreso than I'd like in a sweet beer, but still very good. The result is a very pleasant drinking beer, along the lines of the other apricot beer I regularly get exposed to (Magic Hat #9), but, honestly, much better executed. Alas, like #9, I wouldn't call this a session beer---after one beer I'm ready to try something else."
"Overall: not all that drinkable, IMO. Seems to wander aimlessly and not straddles the fence between an IPA and a fruit beer, doing neither very well. I tried it on-tap at the ABF and was similarly unimpressed. However, I didn't let that cloud my judgement this time. Nothing I'm going to hurry back to."
"Orange-yellow-bronzed, near crystalline, frothy white head that 1/2-faded but laced well. Fruity smell but not what I'd call apricot, more like orange zest and bread, quite nice though. Very little bitterness on the tongue with a light apricot and mellon taste to it. Finish was a bit hoppy and pleasant. Very light feeling drink with regard to the taste but solid feel on the tongue. Very drinkable."
"This is surprisingly bitter and hoppy but also sweet from the apricots. Not a huge fan of fruit in my beer but they used it to good affect. The natural sweetness of the apricots is in perfect balance with the hops. Neither dominates at any time. It is so well balanced sometimes it is difficult to tell where one flavor begins and the other ends. Mouth is medium bodied and lightly crisp in the finish, mild hoppiness lingers. Tasty. They done got this right."
"D- I was expecting a fruit beer with some IPA notes but this is a solid IPA with some fruit notes. Very nice balance and if I didn't know it had apricots I would think it was the newest hybrid hops. Very nice twist on a classic."
"12 oz bottle thanks to Foolcircle as part of BIF20. Pours a one-finger light tan head over a crystal clear orange/light rust liquid. Smells coho hoppy, caramel malty, and gently apricot. Initial taste is grassy hop that turns to oranges. Then the apricot steps in. Not a flavor blast, like I was expecting, just a pleasant fruity. At the very end of the taste, the hop has a orange pith tang that's not very pleasing. Wow what a great aftertaste. Malty caramel with a toffee that rises and fades. Medium bodied and moderate to mod-heavy carbonation."
"As soon as I popped the cap, I got a whiff of apricots Was relieved when I put my nose to the glass that it was not as overpowering as it seemed at first. Actually, kind of a chocolate covered fruit type of smell? Where did that come from. Not what I expected, but nice. Thick head of medium tan bubbles. Beautiful copper/gold color. First sip goes in smoothly. Great mouth feel on this one. Average ale flavor with a hint of apricot in the background. No hops or bitterness present at first, but bitter in the finish. This beer looks and smells better than it tastes. Looks great in the glass, but very non-committal on the flavor. The flavor does not quite know what direction to go in. I can see with a tweak in the recipe, this being a stellar brew. Not yet."
"Pours a medium copper color with some moderate carbonation as well as some lacing. Smell consists of lightly toasted hops along with mild apricots. Taste is pretty punchy with flowery hops. I was expecting more apricot flavor, but it did not taste too out of place. It wasn't too fake of a flavor either. Hops were crisp. Mouthfeel was good, reminiscent of the 60 min IPA, but not as strong. Not too filling, rather refreshing."
"Drinkability: Very tasty and all around a pleasure to enjoy. Well balanced and well crafted."
"Finger licking good."
"The taste is excellent with a perfect balance of hops in my opinion. There is the mild grapefruit flavor and not an over abundance of bitterness in the aftertaste. This is a very good beer."
"-UF"
"My first brew from the much lauded brwery (and my first from the state, if that makes any difference). Pours a nice copper color, nice and dark, changes color in the light. You can sure smell the apricots in this one, and it is quite nice. The hops also shine through, making this a very fruity and aromatic beer. Taste is good and hoppy, but there isn't as much apricot in the flavor as I expected. There is an axtra fruitiness to this one from the apricots, but just the eseence, notihng overpowering or detracting from the hophiesta going on in this beer. Mouthfeel is slick and appropriately carbonated. Good beer, very good actually. This is one of the better ""fruit"" beers I have had."
"Drinkability: Pleasantly drinkable, particularly in the warmer weather"
"Overall this is a decent IPA that happens to have a bit of apricot in it. If you are looking for an apricot kick, try Magic Hat No. 9 first."
"Pours orange amber in hue with pretty good clarity. Aromatic white head crops up, leaving some sticky lacing. The apricots are immediately apparent in the nose. Sweet apricots balance the herbal and citrous hops. Not much malt present in the flavor, except a wisp of toastiness. Hints of other fruits seem to be present, but it could be just the apricots. Mouthfeel is quite creamy and full. Finish is slighty dry and acidic, but includes sweet fruit and pine. Interesting take on an IPA. DFH always seems to come up with some interesting brews."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy especially during the summer heat. An interesting twist on an otherwise slightly above average IPA. Glad I tried it but probably won't be seeking this out again."
"Cold bottle poured into a pint glass produces a small amount of light head...the head dissapates to a thin light ring around the glass. Appearance-wise it has a nice orange amber color....very pretty little beer. The first taste is very refreshing on a humid June night. Hoppy, sweet fairly strong apricot flavor...the bitterness of the hops is slightly quelled by the sweetness of the fruit. Much more apricot than Magic Hat #9. In the mouth, it is carbonated, but not overly so. Overall, I enjoy this beer, nothing mind boggling, but a nice beer for a warm summer day/night."
"Overall = Another great tasting beer from Dogfish. Can these guys do anything wrong?"
"This is a pretty average beer. An average amber color, less than average head, and a pretty non-descript scent of maybe some hops and yeasty malt. Tastes like your standard run of the mill American pale ale to me. I can barely note the apircots, and what I can detect isn't really that appealing. This reminds me of Burton Baton in a way... very different beers, but they both share this odd taste, sort of like carborad? that I don't like at all. Don't know what it is, but it's in both beers. Don't bother with this one unless you are destined to try every Dogfish beer known to man..."
"Clear copper fused strawberry color with a slight white ehad that was nothing more than slick on top within seconds of pour. The nose was dominated by the apricot as well as other fruity smells i.e. passion fruit, strawberry. The taste was more of the apricot with just a hint of the hops that the purported IPA possesed. There was a nice finish that was clean, fruity and refreshing. Very decent fruit beer, but nothing more. Something of a hopped up version of #9."
"Apricot dominates just a bit too much, making it more of a fruit beer and not enough of an IPA. An interesting offering, though the least compelling of Dogfish Head's, as adventurous as it is. Good thing it's just a 4-pack, since I don't think I could enjoy more than that in a season."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. I would recommend this as a fine example of the Fruit / Vegetable Beer style, though it slightly crosses over into IPA territory."
"At 7%, it is way too strong to be considered a Summer seasonal which any apricot beer would have to be. Seems like it would be a great one for the peanut butter combo that is so good with hoppy IPAs"
"Who would've ever thought apricots and an IPA could work together? But they do! The Aprihop pours a clear orange-copper body beneath a frothy head of off-white foam that holds quite well and leaves thin craggy rings about the glass. The nose is lightly malty with a delicate touch of pine and some unclear fruitiness (guess that's from the apricots, huh?). It's slightly elevated carbonation bristles the tongue at first, but it becomes much more airy as it warms and its dextrinous medium body becomes clear. The flavor is a bit sweeter than the maltiness found in the nose might suggest, and it actually does have an apricot flavor to it! It's not as bitter as might be expected, but it's absolutely balanced; and the hop flavors blend in quite well with their leafy, woody, citrusy (? - and that might just be from the apricots as well), and mildly pine-like flavors. It finishes dry with a kick of bitterness and some residual dried-apricot flavor that sticks in the mouth. It's surprisingly good; well-balanced; not overly fruity; very enjoyable; and drinkable to boot (except that it's 7%abv.)!"
"Drinkable, definitely. You have a delicate blended IPA on your hands here that would go excellently with fish, or served to some non beer geek ladies who usually go for Chardonney."
"Overall, an intriguing IPA. I like it, but it's probably a bit too expensive for me to get too often ($8 a 4 pack)."
"All in all, an interesting brew that comes on a bit too strong, but gets more drinkable as you go on. Definitely a different twist on a fruit beer, and it has grown on me. But between the assertive hops and the 7% ABV, it's not one I'd keep drinking all night long."
"This beer is plenty drinkable and I really do like it but there isnt much that stands out about it. Odd, I know. The aftertaste is long and I could really see this beer going great with cheddar cheese or some kind of fruit-butter on toast. Damn that sounds great! This beer was very tasty. I really liked it. Thank you shippos! This 12-ounce bottle was a great addition to the Secret Bunny Exchange!"
"Last swigs: Tastes a bit like a dehydrated apricot. Not really like an IPA at all. Just ale and a curious beer for the not so curious. 7 % ABV is hidden, kinda like apricot hard candy with a husky grain."
"I'll definitely be buying this again. A great IPA experiment, and I would certainly like to see more, as I'm a huge fan of the 60 and 90 minute. They know their IPAs."
"Light orange color with a nice, fairly-carbonated head. The smell is rather subtle. Slight fruity aroma and slightly hoppy, but not a whole lot going on. The taste was more of the same. It is well-balanced, but I was expecting more fruit and more hops. Easy drinking and easy on the palate. I think the fact that I had this on-tap may have dulled it down a bit. I'd love to try it out of a bottle someday."
"1"" of yellowy-tan, bumpy, dense head. Clear, copper-amber beer. Faint, sweet apricots in the nose. A little tangy. Nice. Light fruit up front. Slick, malty-caramel and quite full through the middle. Roasty, bitter and quite strong at last. It seems like a nice, darkish IPA with just a hint of fruit. I was expecting more fruit, but this is quite tasty. And I should be the last one to complain that there's not enough fruit in my beer, after complaining too often that there's too much."
"Drinkability- This one hit the spot on the hottest day of the yeart so far. My computer room is roasting and this does the trick to keep the sweat at bay. Good deal. Yummy brew."
"Considering I do not normally gravitate to this style, I found this to be quite good and it could easily be a go-to choice for me."
"I like this and I'm enjoying it, but I'm not sure that I'd want to drink it for an extended period of time. It's a good taster and would do well with food; perhaps some hot n' spicy southern BBQ."
"Clear orange pour with a head that stuck around for quite a while. Smell is floral hops and apricot with a bit of grass as well. Taste is more hop than apricot, but the apricot fruitness and sweetness is there at the base. There's also a bit of a faint vanilla flavor that's very intriguing. I'm a big fan of Magic Hat #9 as an occasional brew, but this one is a lot better. It's less cloyingly sweet, and the apricot takes a back seat to the hop flavor, which is a good thing. It also has more of a medium-bodied mouthfeel compared to the #9, which I feel is a bit thin. Overally, quite a nice spring beer."
"Thanks to Pegasus for the bottle."
"Drinkability and Overall: Not bad, but not great. It's not an IPA, not really an apricot beer. But not bad. It's very creamy, but the malt and apricot aftertaste really starts to get old, which hurts the drinkability."
"I really loved this take on an IPA. It's about perfect balance. It's hoppier than an average IPA, not as hoppy as 90 minute IPA, but the (sweetness?) of the apricots balances the harshness of the hops and makes for a crisp but very smooth glass of beer and the fullest flavor and highest ABV of anything I can honestly say was ""gone in 60 seconds"". It went down like a light pisner or lager on a 90 degree day but felt like a full bodied beer in my mouth. I really can't imagine changing a thing."
"-Oelergud"
"Taste: Carbonation is quite vivacious, middle is fruity, but a sour, tart kind of fruity. Then blamo, that Dogfish head hop salvo finishes it off, but not before giving your tastebuds a good beating. Finishing off my 4 pack was no difficulty at all."
"A good beer. I would have liked more apricot flavor."
"I was a bit apprehensive about this one, but picked up a four-pack because the SO requested it. Surprisingly really good. Poured amber in color, without any head and only slight carbonation. The apricots are fairly strong in the aroma. So are the hops. The flavor is very much apricot. Very Magic Hat #9, but better overall. I think that is because the hop kick ad the subsequent bitterness is that much nicer. Very crisp finish."
"Sampled at the Southside Beer Expo, Frankfort, IL. Hmmm, yes. Hoppy, hoppy, hoppy! Apricot taste is evident, indeed, but it's not overpowering as in other fruit beers. Here, the fruit just supports the citrusy IPA hop chracter. The DFH take on a fruit beer."
"Pours a deep orange with a nice big fluffy head that leaves a nice amount of lace behind,aromas of sweet apricot and zesty,piney hop very nice mingling of aromas.Apricot notes hit the taste buds up front but a dry,piney hop presence makes it self known pretty quickly but once again stays well balanced with apricot flavor.I really like the concept and flavors of this beer and its dangerously drinkable at 7% I will get again for sure sometime."
"Drinkability: I love IPA's and this one is top notch. I could drink a million of these. So top notch and satisfying."
"Good show from the fellas at Dogfish."
"Strange... somehow this balances out well."
"Taste/Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A bit rough in the mouth, the carbonation is sensational. Not my favorite fruit beer; I would choose Abita's Purple Haze or Magic Hat #9 for a more drinkable example of this style, however I commend DFH for a good beer nonetheless. I am looking forward to sampling this on-tap at Brewtopia in NY on April 16."
"Comments - As others have observed, this beer is sort of like the 90 Minute IPA on low volume. I think the apicot flavor could be ramped up a little without making the beer too similar to a malternative."
"Mouthfeel is medium, crisp and clean. If you imagine the familiar grapefruity taste of a traditional IPA as turning to the right, this IPA turns just to the left. An interesting curiosity but I'm ambivalent about the hybridized style."
"I've had this on-tap, but failed to review it in that serving style. So, when the four packs hit the shelves, I picked one up. What a great spring beer. This pours a clear ruddy orange, small head that falls quickly. Smell is mellow fruity and hoppy. The taste starts out as a rather weak IPA because the fruit immediately follows. They blend together so that neither overpowers, the definition of balance. This is an excellent fruit beer. The mouthfeel was medium with the fruitiness adding some depth. Finish is hoppy and crisp. At 7% ABV this is so simple to drink that I recommend it for home consumption only. It is sessionable. I can see me having this with a stack of grilled beef and pineapple kabobs. Hey, the wife likes it too. The best thing for IPA lovers out there is to treat this for the fruit beer that it is, otherwise you'll be somewhat disappointed. Another winner from DFH."
"12oz brown bottle-2004 btl date, tasted 9/14/04"
"Tasted: 03/10/05"
"reasonable session IPA and a pretty good brew. am i likely to buy a sixer of it over the other DFH IPAs? probably not, but i did like being able to buy a single"
"Overall Impression: This is one of the best fruit beers I have tried - the apricot actually compliments the beer instead of taking it over. A nice twist on an IPA."
"Its good to revisit this beer. Thanks to Chris for this one. The beer pours a nice golden color with a finger of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is really nice, with a sweet apircot that is rather prevalent, but also with a nice citrusy hop in the background. Woo, this smells nice. The flavor is upfront with the grapefruity hop, with the sweetness from the apircot dancing in the background. Nice sweet and hoppy combination. I like it. The feel is moderate, with a light to moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer is very refreshing and crisp. I'm really looking forward to seeing this on tap around here in early april."
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, especially for a fruit beer...even though this is kind of in limbo between a fruit beer and an IPA. Would make a good conversion beer for people on the lunatic fringe.. Several non-craft-beer drinkers that have sampled this have really liked it. A little mild for me, but a solid beer from DFH nonetheless."
"All and all a very good, but strange offering from DFH. I still enjoy their creativity and uniqueness. This was well worth a try and I'd love to have it again."
"This beer poured an orange/golden color that was crystal clear and well carbonated even after the time sitting around in the bottle since May. The head that was produced was off white in color, not very dense, fairly thin after a decent foam after the pour, after settling down it fell to just a simple ring on the edges, but it created a lace that was fairly sheety in nature. The aromas that came from the glass were of piney/fruity hops (not over-powering) some light malt tones, fresh herbs, and some light fruits all throughout (apples and apricots). The flavors were dominated with a nice smooth and creamy hop flavor (citrus and pine), not overpowering, but always present, caramels and malts were present in the beginning and in the middle along with herb and spice tones along with mild apricot flavors, as the swallow was nearing the end there was mostly pine trees, fruit and alcohol esters. There was a cocoa powder that hit the back of the throat as it slid down, but giving way to hops as an aftertaste. The body was light to medium, but the aftertaste was kind of thick. Smooth and creamy and seemed to hold up well over the months. A decent IPA, not overly hopped but it may have mellowed over time. My opinion it needs a tad more apricots in the aroma and taste, but not much or it will become overpowering. I did notice that afterwards I did burp hops  which are a good sign. I liked it."
"Pours an even copper tone with a light white head and leaves a thick lacing down my glass. Aromatics are sweet barley malt, caramel, tons of hops and some fruity apricot esters. Flavor carries mild bitterness, sweet caramel, citrus hop flavors and an even apricot coating from start to finish. Medium bodied palate with a light syrupy finish. Experimental for the style and quite good, shame that I cannot have access to more of this in my area."
"poured a copper color with nice foamy head. aroma hops . citrus like not so sweet oranges hints of apricots. flavor weak grapefruit, green apples and after letting it warm up in my mouth the apricot came out a nice bitterness bite to it. not to bad will drink again"
"Poured up a huge rocky head. The beer is a bit more carbonated that most and that only plays to its advantage. The color was a golden orange, almost like a bright new penny. Aroma wise, I have to admit, I had a hard time picking up the apricot. That is where I was expecting it the most. I got definite fruity notes and hoppy notes with some pine and of course citrus but it kind of all blended together. If I hadn't known about the apricot I don't think I would have found it. That said, the beer was great, very well made and a nice blend of hop bitterness, flavor and malt. Alcohol strength was not evident so it could sneak up on you. As far as the apricot goes, when I had a Magic Hat #9 several years ago I didn't pick up on the apricot immediately either - I thought it was more like a strange hop. This was similar, thus this may be the most appropriately named beer I've ever had. Recommended."
"Poured a nice golden color with decent, lasting head. Smell is fruity. Taste - where's the apricot? I expected a much stronger flavor to this beer; in fact I couldn't taste the apricot at all. Just a bland, generic-tasting IPA. Dogfish Head has many offerings that are much better than this."
"Bottle (Obtained from my Knoxville SS December 2004): Poured an amber color ale with a huge thick bubbly head with better then average retention. Aroma is quite hoppy with some subtle traces of sweetness. Taste is very similar to an IPA but with added sweetness which really balanced the whole thing out. I wonder if my bottle was aged a bit since the apricot taste was quite subtle as opposed to some description of past rating. Anyway, I still very much enjoyed this beer and very much appreciate all the beers that Im discovering from this fine brewery."
"On draft at Delaneys (New haven, CT), leftover from a DFH dinner. Pours hazy straw yellow with dense white head. Magnificent juicy apricot aromas mingled with soft malts, and a distinctly clean floral/pine hop note. Tastes MUCH better than its bottled counterpart. Fuzzy apricot, bready malt, and a crisp, piney, well-hopped finish. Perfect mouthfeel, too easy to drink. Someone said it reminded them of Magic Hat#9. I bitchslapped him back into the corner where he belonged!!!"
"Great beer, best ""Apricot"" flavored beer I have ever had. Blow #9 away and shames Pryamid. With its amberish body and light white head it looks good. It smells of juiced-up hops, but the taste is truly great. It blends the malt into the big hops that give it a citrus tart taste underlined with the tang of Apricots. Unlike some fruit tainted beers this is easy drinking for an IPA lover."
"The apricot flavor in this beer is understated, which I wasnt expecting. Hops and malt are definitely the dominant flavors. This is one hoppy beer, I also found it much drier than the 90 minute. The mouthfeel is thick and textured, very nice. This is one hell of an IPA, apricots or not."
"A very good brew that I'd definitely like to have more of."
"Foam came out of the bottle as soon as I opened it. (I shipped lots of beers this way, and have opened at least a dozen. This is the only one that had this reaction.) A careful pour nevertheless yielded one finger of liquid under foam covering the rest of the glass. It took a full 13 minutes for me to get the entire 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Way too much head. Once we got the contents in, we had hazy slightly orange copper liquid under a voluminous beige head with the body of whipped cream. The head fades slowly, leaving excellent lace - so after the initial disaster, the appearance is really quite good. The nose is a pleasant combination of flowery hops and sweet apricot. As it warmed, the apricot came to dominate the hops. The mouth is fairly well carbonated, but pretty heavy, somewhat like fruit juice. The taste? Well, better than I expected, as I feared the apricot would dominate. Instead, there is sweet apricot flavor, but it is clearly imposed on a fairly hoppy IPA background. The hops are smooth and flowery at first, but move towards an espresso bitter impression in the finish and aftertaste. The apricot fades much more quickly, allowing a beer lover to actually enjoy this odd brew combination. After a very bad start, the overall impression is really not bad at all."
"It was really clean in feel, light in body w/ some nice carbonation and little alcohol burn. This was a nicely crafted brew that left me craving more form Dogfish!"
"Creamy and dry mouthfeel with a sticky sweet aftertaste. Very drinkable for such an experimental beer."
"Mouthfeel is good, a tad bit thin but that just makes it go down that much easier. Drinkability is very good here to....forget the 4 pack..put this in sixers! A tasty treat anytime...but I think this would be even better on a nice summer day."
"Dogfish is one of my favorite breweries, so this was a definate must try. Pours a light amber color with a large white head that stays around for a while and leaves a nice bit of lacing on the glass. Nose is hoppy - pine and grassy, but also sweet and has a nice fruit presence. So, smells like an IPA with fruits in it - imagine that. The flavor is sweet and hoppy, but has a definate apricot taste. The fruit comes through extremely well in this brew. Very nice flavor and drinkability. The body is a little thin, but it's an IPA, so I didn't expect it to be very thick. Wonderful beer and another great one from Dogfish."
"Reminds me of a smaller, more drinkable version of Immort ale. Pretty good."
"I could drink several of these without any problem. Tasty and very enjoyable."
"Good, and different enough to stand aside from the pack. Unique, apricot taste. Looks like a typical IPA, but the smell and taste are definitely not the norm for the style. Body is right on, and the 7% is very well hidden. Nothing about this brew makes it a classic, but (especially in micro-starved southwest Florida), it's definitely worth buying. 100% so far with Dogfish head."
"Pours a very clear and vibrant orangy copper. Good sized tan head with good head retention. Nose has a lot of hops. Sprucy, piney, and grassy hop aroma, with a very faint hint of apricot. The hops really overpower the apricot aroma. Moderate carbonation. First taste is hops and bitterness, but as soon as it touches your tongue, you can tell there is apricots in this brew. The taste of apricots is present, but matches well in the background. As the sip progresses the hop bitterness is very present. It is kind of an odd sensation, you really aren't tasting the apricots on the tongue, but rather in all other areas of the mouth. Very full bodied. The 7% ABV in this beer becomes known when this beer warms up. Probably could have used more apricots flavor. All in all it is a good and interesting beer."
"An amazing beer! I cannot think of a single beer that would go better with my hawaiin pizza right now, give it a try."
"Pretty dang good beer, feels alot like a Belgian dark ale, especially in the nose and and mouthfeel. Sweet and syrup, cinnamon and cloves. Taste is lined with light hops that give the thickness and bitter black cherry sweetness a nice bitter edge. Thick evenness, with only a little massaging of soft carbonation, which seems to grow in intensity as it develops. Taste, too rolls through thickly, big til the end. Big drymouth of raisins and bitter hops."
"Picked up for under a dollar per bottle. Not a bad deal at all if you ask me. Poured a bright orange shade that should be renamed to IPA orange. The 2 finger white head lasted a decent amount of time. Nose had a little bit of piney hop notes and a bread like malt aroma. I picked up no apricots at all. Taste was initially hoppy before fading into a strong malty taste, much like an English IPA. I'm still really struggling to pick up any apricot flavors. Some subtle fruitiness comes out as the beer warms, but it's definetely not an overwhelming flavor. Nothing too spectacular about this offering, but not bad either."
"Drinkability - tastes fine, but given the abv and cost, and my overall disappointment/missed expectation, ApriHop doesn't measure up."
"This brew pours an amberish orange color with a large bubbly white head that just sticks around for what seems an eternity and leaves a nice lace. Aromas for this brew are pretty funky from what I pick up, showing off some earthy tones, mixed with a floral hop, a bit of apricot, and a bit of caramel.. There's also some other funky aroma, but I just can't put my finger on it. Flavors to this brew start off initially malty with a bit of caramel and biscuit like flavors which quickly progress to a citrusy hop flavor and a mix of apricots. This brew is fairly creamy in body, and has a toffee flavor throughout mixed with a oaky like flavor. The finish to this brew is only slightly bitter, with a juicy piney flavor from the hops that lets you know its trying to be an IPA of sorts. The body to this brew is somewhere located on the middle to light side, but has a nice feel to it on the pallate. Overall this brew is decent and nice to try for something different, but I won't go hunting for this one."
"I taste more malt and fruit than hops. If I tasted this blind, I don't think I'd identify it as an IPA. (I'm not even sure it technically is an IPA; however, I guess I'm too lazy and/or tired to research this.) It has some hoppy bite, but the apricot flavor takes over fast. Which is not to say it's overly sweet; actually, I'd say that it's a very well balanced beer. However, well... it's obviously a beer brewed with apricots. Excellent for what it is- a novelty beer- but I wouldn't drink more than one or two in a session."
"Drinkability  This is a great beer from a great brewery. The beer came across very strong and fibrous."
"Saw this beer and thought an apricot IPA would be a very interesting tasting beer. However, there doesn't seem to be too much to write home with this one. No real big sense of apricots off the nose or taste from the mouth. Apperance is a bit more reddish compared to most IPA's, which is what the bottle describes the beer as even though BA has this listed as a fruit beer. Perhaps I'll stick with the X-minute IPA's instead of the fruity IPA's from DFH."
"Copper in color with a large, frothy white head that sticks around and leaves nice lace. The aroma of apricot hits you front he moment the bottle is opened, and slowly subsides until it is in the backround. Toasted malt and floral hops are also in the nose. Apricot does not assert itself in the flavor, it is there in the backround providing a sweetness, bit does not get in the way of this IPA. Nice toasted malt sweetness and floral-citrus hop flavors. Well rounded IPA that does not get dry like others do. There is a juiciness to it, possibly from the apricot. Smooth and juicy, medium-full in body, great drinkablilty. Very nice."
"Pours a three-fingered off-white head that fades slowly leaving a ton of lace. Cloudy amber color. Hoppy nose with hints of apricot. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts and finishes with a different hoppy/apricot flavor. The hops are much less than Dogfish's 60 minute IPA. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"appearence of aprihop is a nice amber with a off-white head that falls slowly to a thin sheet. smell is terrific. citrusy hops with a definitive sweet apricot right in back. taste is better than expected. apricots are only a subltle influence on this ipa. there is only a wisp of sweetness and apricot flavor. the rest is a mild ipa with bold hop flavor with a dry, slightly bitter finish. mouthfeel is light and slightly oily. smooth. overall an easy drinker with a name that will make any boone's farm swiggin' beotch wanna try it. if they do, they will find a baddass ipa that'll make their toes curl."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, paired very, very well with that barbacoa burrito from chipotle."
"This is a decent beer. I really like the look and mouthfeel, though the fusels hamper it's enjoyment. Tastes like an IPA with a wisp of pear or peach nectar. One of DFH's more enjoyable brews, though it doesn't really excite me."
"This beer poured an almost perfect head. A nice mixture of champagne and some larger bubbles. The lace stayed on the glass as I admired the color. The color is a deep copper, almost brown. The nose is hops up front, the citrus does come forward some (I think assisted by the apricots). Definitely more malty/sweetness than most IPAs I try. A nice balance throughout the tasting experience. It has a medium body, very nice balance. I think Ill have another! This has a lot less hops than most IPAs, but its a very drinkable beer. I admire their work in attempting something a little different. I agree with other reviews. This is an IPA first. The apricots add to the experience, they don't dominate."
"This is an IPA first, fruit beer second. Which is how fruit beers should be imo. The hops are subdued by the apricots and it makes for an interesting but satisfying combo. The finish, like the body, is very clean, almost too clean for my liking. A very nice beer all in all."
"Deep golden copper with a thick light tan, quite sticky head. Mild nose of hop citrus and a bit of fruitiness from the apricops. Wonderful IPA flavors. Hops dominate with a good malty richness and a slightly sweet finish. Good mouthfeel; flavorful but not heavy. Very nice. A wonderful drinking IPA. Not as hoppy as the other IPAs from DFH, but still very pleasant. Highly recommended. Well worth trying when you find it."
"This fruit does more for the hop than any double IPA ever could."
"The beer after its emancipation from the 12-ounce brown bottle pours somewhat muzzy deep amber to copper color; the head is mountainous and frothy in texture, the color a nice light tan. Nose is sweet with the malt and Apricots, also a tad of hops, crisp, fresh with the start sweet and nicely malted, top is middling in its feel to the palate, Finish has an authoritarian acidity, the hops personable in their spiciness, sweetly and dry aftertaste, a bit light weight, but drinkable none-the-less"
"This is a hophead's delight with an interesting, rich, honeyed foundation."
"Drinkability: the apricot here seems toned down making this, for the most part, an IPA. not sure if the combo is doing it for me. i'd rather have an IPA or an Apricot Wheat. having said that, it's an above average brew of solid quality."
"I was expecting a little more excitement out of this beer. The head was a frothy off white color, of average size. The lacing on the glass was good too. The body looked hazy brown, lightly cloudy. The overall apricot flavor was small but noticeable, the hops and alcohol flavors overpower it I think. These is some saltiness in the beginning too. The smell was potent hop flowers and a little grapefruit. The mouthfeel was good, medium body, kind of sticky, and a bitter finish. Overall not a bad beer. I think the apricot theme works better in the magic hat #9 because the apricot flavor is less hidden due to weaker hops."
"As one who doesn't particularly like apricots, I wasn't sure how well I would like Aprihop. DFH has come up with a good beer though by keeping the hops up front and the apricot in a supporting role. I'll stick to my unadulterated IPAs, but this was good for something different. Nice effort."
"But it's not a horrible beer.. should be drier."
"Drinkability: I'll reiterate my response to a message board post a while back... this is truly drinkable for a beer with a higher-than-average ABV. I think it's around 7 or 8 percent, and it's barely detectable. Incredibly smooth. Refreshing enough on a summer day, but since it's better near room temperature, I would more likely opt for it on a cool spring or autumn night. Absolutely delicious and highly underrated, I think."
"A very unique and interesting beer to try, but I do have a bit of a problem with it: an IPA? I just don't taste the amount of hops that a standard IPA has. Nevertheless, a very flavorful and unique tasting beer."
"Nice color-almost orange.Slight head-good carbonation level.Somewhat spicy aroma.Malt and hops.Very slight aroma of fruit.Nice big malty flavor.The apricots are there but do not overwhelm.Good balance between the fruit,hops and malt.Nice smooth and full mouthfeel.A very drinkable beer-the fruit is really in the backround which is a nice change.Refreshing on a hot day-alcohol might catch up on you."
"Sticky and chewy which left a thin veil anticipating more."
"Drinkability: I bought a 4 pack of this ($9!). Tastewise, I could easily drink the whole thing in one sitting."
"The Aprihop beer pours orange with a faint red hue much like the color of its namesake the apricot. This beer is slightly cloudy when first poured but clears as it warms. The nose is of alcohol, subtle fruit, and hops that meld in their aroma's. The mouthfeel is very soft, flowing to the coarse hop taste that is probably of the citrusy Northwest varities then followed an apricot fruit taste. Aprihop finishes like an IPA with a crisp dryness from the hops. I would definitely say this is more like an IPA than a fruit beer, but of course it is a hybrid. Very unique and worth a try if you like other Dogfishhead products or are looking for a twist on a traditional IPA."
"Lightly hazed deep amber hue. Thin, but well retained foam collar yields dense sheets of lace. Combination of ripe, pungent apricot and medium lovibond caramel lends an upfront nectar like sweetness in aroma. Vague tangerine like hop bouquet. In flavor, pervasive are rather juicy apricot flesh tones, although hop bitterness assuages fruit sweetness. Hop flavor is expectedly orange like and rather complementary, but discernibly secondary to apricot. As the beer warms, lightly sugared biscuit notes arise and add depth to both fruit overtones and residual sweetness. Full bodied and agreeably viscous in mouthfeel, not unlike peach syrup. Finishes with a thick caramel and dextrin malt wash yielding to a continuation of whole apricot, skin included. A unique, well executed brew. Well balanced in terms of fruit flavor, hop bitterness and malt backbone. Rather heavy on the palate eventually, but is a welcome change of pace from fruit brews with vapid character. A touch more assertive hop flavor would've completed this one."
"I really like this brewery and this is another exaple of why...pushing the envelope at all times...nice tasty English Style IPA...the Apricot is very subtle on both the nose and the taste...the slight Apricot flavor actually seems to blend nicely with the hops they selected...Not a super hopped up beer but a nice hop flavor and tight dry finish...worth trying and solid all the way around...firm body...big creamy head...nice beer"
"Another must-have in an ever-growing list of wonderful summer brews, ApriHop would be outstanding at any time of the year. I'm a big fan."
"Okay, I'm not generally keen on fruit beers (save your occasional lambic). This beer is an exception. It's forceful, full of flavor, genuine, and not at all artificial tasting. Perhaps most of all, it's interesting AND drinkable. It pours a clear, deep coper ocolor with an impressive head. The smell is like a dominated by floral, piney hops. There is, mingled with the hops, the aroma of apricot. The taste is an excellent balance of maltiness, hops, and a touch of apricot. The fruit doesn't seem at all misplaced or off-center. Instead, it fits right into the sweet fortaste, and provides an evenness to a wonderful hop finish. This beer won over a critic. If all fruit beers tasted like this, I'd be a huge fan."
"have been craving a hoppy beer and this being the only one I have in my current stash, I was looking forward to trying it. Its a solid IPA, but the apricot is very reserved. Ive had similar peach/apricot aromas from other IPAs (I think its a combination of yeasty fruitiness and certain types of hops) and Im not sure that I wasnt looking for it that Id notice apricots in this. Its more apparent in the aroma with a bit of dried apricot lurking under the slightly peppery hops. The flavor is mostly hops, but not overpowering, with a nice strong bitterness in the finish. The color is a dark amber on the red side of the category and the head is small and eggshell white."
"I did not review this beer on my first bottle, since I was disappointed and wanted to have a second sample to be more objective in my expectations. Not that the first bottle was bad, but when the label made a big deal about being brewed with apricots, I was ready for an apricot-infused flavor, like Pyramid's apricot ale. On the first bottle, I really did not get any apricot notes, other than a general, fruity hops profile. Unusually malty and dense for the style, and the big abv is surpising. On the second sample, I was able to pick out some apricot flavor from the rather loaded hops profile. Overall, this did not strike me as a fruit flavored beer - it is more like an old ale or strong ale that happens to have some fruit flavors. It was not bad at all, just not what I had in mind."
"Poured a nice amber with a creamy head, nice to look at. A very nice aroma of malt and bitter hops, with some faint fruitiness that could be resolved as apricot after a little while. It was quite bitter, but very smooth, and the fruitiness helped. Overall quite drinkable, but a little too strong on the hop aroma for my tastes."
"I absolutely enjoyed this beer and thought it was an interesting twist on the IPA. My hats off to Dogfish Head for such a great beer."
"Like a bad Magic Hat #9. Way too hoppy for my taste with an abundance of apricot flavor lurking. This is rather unpleasant, and not something I would revisit (only fruit beer out of DFH that has been any good has been Punkin AleAu Courant was a let down as well)."
"The palate is full of buttery and caramel malt notes. The apricots provide tropical fruit, apricot and a nice fruit essense all around. The hops are herbal, sharp and pungent and give notes of pine, flowers and lemon. It's balanced very well but the bitterness just isn't there. Nonetheless, it's still pretty tasty."
"Had this on tap at Dr. Dremo's on dogfish head appreciation night. This one pours a nice golden orange color with a slightly off white head. The head disappeared rather quickly leaving a great looking lacing about the glass. Smells are dominated by hops, mainly citrus and there is a slight sweet malt smell about the beer. Not an overpowering aroma but a pleasing smelling beer. Expecting a big apricot taste with hops to come from this brew, and that was half met. There was definatly a great hoppy flavor present but the apricot was a bit more subdued than expected but still added nicely to the overall flavor . With the malt present the balance definatly was there,more so than DFH's other IPAs. A full bodied brew that goes down easy, too bad its a little pricey. A nice fruity IPA that definatly deserve a try if you come across it."
"'08 UPDATE: DIDNT SEEM TO BE WHAT IT USED TO- LACKING FLAVOR IN GENERAL, MORE SOUR APRICOT TASTE& VERY LITTLE HOP NOTES COME THROUGH. WAS A LITTLE DISSAPPOINTED IN THIS ONE THIS YEAR."
"This beer is excellant! I was a bit affraid that the apricot might be too much but I think it was the perfect amount. The aroma is simoply a preview of the powerful hop flavor that I would expect from Sam Calagione these days. The flavor is crisp and almost chewy with hops. The apricot come as an after taste that you need to wait on just a little. The color scheme for the label is on target as well. A nice seasonal from Dogfish. Might I add that the flavor of this beer made my wife cringe which usually makes for a good beer."
"Slightly murky golden orange color, with a good head and some intermittent lace, receding to a light foamy top relatively quickly. The smell is (surprise) apricots, but its more than just apricots. There is a bready smell too, with some small hint of hops somewhere hidden within. The taste is basically the Dogfish 60 with apricots, which (surprise again) is what you might expect before drinking this. The apricot taste seemed a bit too strong on the first sip, but it really seems to fit pretty well once you give it a few sips. A good beer, both as an experimental recipie, and in the general sense."
"Tantalizing crisp IPA mouthfeel though, I'm not usually one for ApricotPeach beers but this one was muted enough that I have to admit that despite the above-average taste it was still surprisingly drinkable."
"Good looking amber brew with off white head that falls to 1/3 inch cap that lasts as long as the beer with great lacing all the way down the glass, looks wonderful. Smells mostly of citrus hops, some carmelized malt and a light fruit smell but overall aroma is subdued. Taste like a good IPA, starts with slight sweetness to start followed by grapefruit flavored hops with bitterness but not overly so good tasting. Didn't notice much in way of apricots in this brew at all wouldn't really classify as fruit beer more like a good IPA. Mouthfeel is medium well balanced and extremely drinkable brew. Will be buying more of these."
"Side Note: The lacing of this beer is encredible. As I write this review, I've been done for 20 minutes, and my glass is still covered from top to bottom with a beautiful, sticky white lacing."
"A slightly golden amber pour with a decent head that breaks down into a nice layer of clingy lace. Very slight haze and some active carbonation. Smell is characterized by a nice balance between hops and sweetness. If I didn't know there was apricot, I wouldn't have detected it by smell--pineapple perhaps, but not apricot. The taste, however, is distinctly hoppy--very appropriate for the style. Nevertheless, sweet malts and warmth are present as well, balancing the taste much like the smell. Not as astringent as many IPAs but also not unduly clingy--a pleasant softness in the mouthfeel before the warmth shows up. While I would be hard pressed to identify the apricot in a blind taste test, this is a good beer by any measure and an uncommonly good fruit beer."
"D&N: Is this a far-out fruit beer or an awesomely done freaky IPA? I don't know but this brewery did it just right. I don't know how Dogfish Head makes their hops taste the way they do, but I'm now a big fan of theirs. If you haven't tried this one yet, what are you waiting for?"
"I found this one at my local bottle store and was a little skeptical at first. Nevertheless, I bit the bullet, and tried it. I was not disappointed in any way. This is a fine brew and will stock it as part of my regular selection in my fridge (for as long as I can find it anyways)."
"This pours out with a clear amber body with a big fluffy one and a half finger head that dissipates to very nice all-covering blanket of foam. Nice sporadic spots and steaks of lace down the edges of the glass. The aroma is sweet with a somewhat earthy undertone, perhaps clay. Also a little grassy and faint hint of cloche. The taste has a slight bitterness from the Warrior hops and a great hops presence that makes this ale. The sweetness from the apricot there, but in the background, which in my opinion is a good thing. It also has a peculiar woodiness to it, almost like it was aged in wood, but it's not. This ends very dry on the tongue, bitter, and a little oily. Great IPA, very fresh and very crisp..."
"I ponied up and got a four pack of the Apri-Hop figuring that it would just make me mad to see Dogfish Head IPA be abused by addition of apricots; however, this beer is really a well-crafted piece of work. It pours slightly lighter in color than the other dogfish head ipa's and immediately smells both of hops and of apricots. There is a small, lightly colored head at the top of each glass but the taste is what sells me on the beer (as it should). IPA hop-style beer apparently just blends perfectly with the apricot taste, this beers is very light on the tounge and is exceptionally smooth (with a strong hop flavor). The apricot taste doesn't overpower the beer and it seems that a balance is found between the two tastes. I love this and will get some more before it goes out of season to keep around for the fall harvest season."
"Medium amber, slightly cloudy look. Glistening, almost greasy, head -- sticks in big circles on a festival glass. Hops give a citrus tang to a fruity aroma. Confusing flavor in many ways -- without a lot of malt or a heavier mouthfeel to anchor the beer in a fixed place, it strays into astringency and then seems more about apple peel and grape skins. To me, this wasn't a bad beer but it was overly thin and without a backbone other than wandering bitters. Just didn't strike me as a very well-composed experiment."
"one gets the feeling that this is what magic hat's # 9 should be. a very good beer, but i think it may be better suited as an autumn seasonal rather than spring/summer. it's not heavy but a bit on the heavy side for the season."
"The fruity taste does not last and leaves behind a find of flat, soda-pop sweetness. Why would anyone want to do this to an otherwise excellent IPA?"
"While this beer is not one I am a huge fan of, its a sturdy clutch-hitter for the home team. Like those fruit-wheat beers you loathe but secretly have a heart for, ApriHop isn't designed for beer geeks per se, but the pure ability for this beer to enchance laypersons' appreciation for beer deserves a place in any batting order."
"The mouthfeel is medium with a prickly carbonation which feels like it's injected, not naturally occuring. It's carbonated almost like a coke or pepsi. It's not that bubbly but it's noticably bubbly. I'd drink more but I'm looking for a good food to pair with it. The bitterness is nearly a distraction. This beer might taste better with a year of bottle age."
"I have a blossoming love affair with the occasionally rough hops used in Dogfish Head IPA's, and this ale is another fine example of their well constructed IPA's. For some reason, my bottle simply was lacking the apricot presence, in taste and aroma, that I was expecting."
"Floral hop and apricot aroma. Orange hued cream colored head was thick and solid leaving a bit of scattered lace. Slightly hazy orangish amber colored beer. Body is on the light side of moderate. Smooth mouthfeel, a bit cream and bubbly, very nice. Lightly bitter IPA with a very mellow apricot flavor, a bit of light cereal malt, with a citrus punch at the end. A nice refreshing fruit beer."
"The smell scared me a bit because the first scent was that of the 60 minute(i havent reviewed it yet but will). I got a hint of the apricot but it seemed i got mostly grassy hops, not pleasing to me. then i tasted it, wow. great balance, the apricots hit with a nice sticky sweetness and it goes down with a well balanced hoppiness that I coud enjoy, the mouthfeel is a bit sticky but also a littel fizzy at the same time. I found it to be a very refreshing brew and it was just what i was looking for on the 80 degree day that I drank it on..."
"A somewhat cloudy apricot/amber with a thin white head, this brew has a nicely balanced apricot/hop aroma -- just as the name implies. Unfortunately, as well as these two blend in the aroma, they don't compliment each other as nicely in the taste. It's not that its bad, its just that if I wanted the hop flavor, there are about a hundred brews I'd pick over this -- and if its apricots I'm looking for, give me a Pyramid Apricot Ale. The mouth feel was full and syrupy -- nice for a fruit beer -- but I gave it a lower drinkablity because, why have another?"
"As such, its somewhat syrupy, which doesn't lead to drinking much. I split the 12oz with my wife (really), and that was an appropriate serving. Despite the beauty of the pour, it didn't stack up to what I'd hoped."
"I'm generally not a huge fan of beers with fruit, so I was a little apprehensive going in. The smell was just like the name - intensely fantastic piney hops & loads of apricot. OK I'll admit it, the flavor was excellent...loads of citrus & hops balanced beautifully with sweet apricot which unfortunately got a touch syrupy at times. Never had anything like this before, but would definitely drink it again (and again)."
"I had the privelage of having this beer on tap at Dogfish Head recently. When the beer first arrived it had a very nice presentation, light copper color with a wonderful head. It was great beer, a light citrisy flavor, the hops and the apricots complimented each other wonderfully. Nice fruity aroma, very refreshing aftertaste and left you wanting more. It makes me almost want to drive 4 hours to have a few more on tap."
"DogFish Head Aprihop: Reddish amber color, beautiful thick and creamy head, very dense. Leaves very nice rings down the side of the glass. Mild sweet aroma, equal parts apricots and hops, nicely balanced. The taste is terrific, the apricot flavor is present, but nowhere near overwhelming, as I had feared, in fact the taste is really exceptional. Nicely hopped, nicely malt base, and the fruit flavors adding an accent, rather than providing the dominant flavor of this brew. Light mouthfeel. Easily the best fruit beer Ive ever had."
"a deep copper/amber color with very little head and no lacing. the aroma is nice with hints of apricots and hops. The aroma also has a nice underlying malty smell. The taste is sweet with a lot of apricot flavor that takes over from the start. it does finish with a slightly bitter hop profile. the aftertaste left in the mouth has a good bitterness to it. Lots of contrast troughout the drink from sweet to bitter. Overall and ok beer to be injoyed during the summer months. Can't drink to many cause of the sweetness."
"A rich copper color. A small unsustained head: I poured for maximum head affect and there wasn't much there, and what was there didn't last long. Smells nice and fruity, which is to be expected. Taste was alright but not impressive: starts out sweet and ends up bitter on the tongue. Nothing spectacular here. Worth maybe picking up a single bottle. I am stuck with the remaining three bottles of the 4 pack, which I am not really looking forward to drinking. To many other fine beers out there."
"Well, I've always been a fan of DFH and their mad genius, and this is an example. Though I couldn't drink this one all day, for one beer or two this was an interesting experiment, to mix fruit beer and IPA, and I'm sure I'll have this one again."
"I loved it! DFH never ceases to amaze, do they? To start off, it is a golden amber colour, clear with a white fluffy head. Smells maybe a bit apricoty, a bit citrusy, I guess from the hops, but mostly malty actually. I had a few bottles of it and I still am not getting the apricots, and there's not any extreme hoppiness that would warrant a name with HOP in it. Besides all that though, I truly enjoyed this beer and if I could I'd make it my 'regular.' Mouthfeel is very smooth and just the right thickness. Not very thick but I couldn't call it thin. Basically it's not extreme in any way,. but it is so well blended that I think I'll be buying bottles for as long as supplies last!"
"OK, I'm not usually one for fruit beers, even though I live in blueberry territory in Maine every summer, but I had to try this IPA tinted with real apricots (I love apricots by the way, and I'm a big fan of the Dogfish Head IPA too). It poured a rich, bubbly, and very clear amber with a soft, sparkling tan head. I must say, the apricot aroma is evident, but nicely understated, as are the white pine esters, and together they seem to be a good match for the hops, at least in the smell. The taste, alas, is not quite as satisfying. The start is dull--a bit grassy, but neither the hops nor the apricots seem very full-bodied. There's a nice bready moment in the middle, but the finish is weak as well--not quite enough hoppy bitterness for my taste. But, the fruitiness is good--not cloying or intrusive."
"Hmm...clearish orangey apricot color, how fitting, just under a finger high head of dirty cream colored foam, some thinnly etched strings of lace stick. Smell has a nice herbal/grassy hop with a solid toasted malt backing, some detectable notes of fresh apricots and slight pine lay underneath, very fresh smelling with a raw grassy hop edge. Taste has a toasty frontage blending quickly with herbal grassy fresh hops that has a mild bite ending with a mix of pine wood, citrus fruits and just a peppering of the apricot can be detected nearer the finish where it tappers off with a toasty malt flake and bake twinge and a grab of hop bittering thats favorabley mild. Feel is about medium, nice and crisp with a light drying quality with just the right amount of bite and balance making for a good drinking IPA fruity treat. Its not as Aprihopped as I hoped it would be but its quite good non-the-less. Borderline sessionable with the 6.6% - drinkable all the same. I could easily put a few of these away and be a happy camper. Thanks to drweizen for the bottles!"
"Another good one from DFH. A dark golden/orange brew with a tight head of white foam. Aromas are apricot essence, metallic/herbal hops, citrus notes, and some pine. The taste is hoppy up front with a big fruity blast in the middle and a nice piney/herbal finish that lasts, giving you fruity hop burps. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, but that is good for a summer refresher like this, and the drinkability is damn good as well....nice stuff"
"Tastes sweet at 1st hit. Nice malty flavor mixes nicely with the apricot flavor on the way down. It is still an IPA, through and through, however. I mean you cannot mistake the typical hop charecters and what not usually present, however, you just tend to notiuce the malt/fruit mix 1st. It blends together rather well, and is very enjoyable. good job"
"Pours a deep golden with hints of orange.. Gee kinda like the colour of an apricot. Nice fluffy white head. It is a pretty beer in the glass. Smell is crisp with just a hint of fruitiness. Taste is quite yummy. A bit of malt up front with just a hint of the Apricots, followed by a nice but balanced hoppiness that dries out the brew and keeps the fruitness in check.. The mouthfeel is very nice as well.. Well carbonated and silky smooth.. Drinkability is high.. Not to high in ABV, one could sit and drink quite a few of these i do believe.. A very good offering from DFH,, They can certainly do IPA's well"
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a seep reddish-copper color with 2 fingers of head. There is good lacing left on the glass. The smell is very hoppy, just the slightest hint of apricot. Some fruity aromas come through as well. The taste is malty and fruity at first, some of the apricot making itself noticed. The finish is hoppy and dry, very nice. The mouthfeel is thick and heavy for an IPA, yet smooth. The drinkability is very nice too. A sweet and hoppy treat."
"The appearance of this fruit IPA was good. Amber, clear, medium white head. Decent lace retention. To me the smell was hoppy yet did not seem to have any hints of apricot. Not at all displeasing though as I love hops. The taste was good as well. Much stronger hop bitterness than a #9. The apricot flavor became more apparent as the beer got warmer. Also a hint of that weird Dogfish Head taste that in my other DFH reviews I call ""canned pineapple syrup."" I have yet to understand what this flavor is, but I have encountered it in the 90 min IPA and the 120 MIn IPA as well. Mouthfeel was crisp and refreshing. I also thought the drinkability was good. I'm not a fruit beer fan, and while this doesn't come close to my favorite fruit beer (St. Peters Grapefruit), it does in my opinion offer a better taste than the other apricot fruit beers I've tasted. A good solid offering, worth a taste."
"Compliments a steak of tuna on the grill VERY nicely. Mmmm !"
"Overall this is a very interesting beer with a great hop aroma but its a little too rich and sweet for my taste which kills the drinkability after my stomach starts to hurt."
"Excellent looking deep golden clear brew, with a massive off white head that seems to stand still. Light bubbles rise up to the head. Good citrousy hop aroma, with a slight hint of the labelsake's apricots. Taste is hoppy , yet refined. Nice citrous flavors with the slight taste of apricot keeping things smooth. Grainy tastes and a decent maltiness hold it together nicely.Great hop flavor, with a mild bitterness finishing things. This beer tastes like the perfect summer IPA. Medium bodied, with a slick, starts wet/finishes dry mouthfeel.Dry aftertaste, but great lingering hop flavors. Drinkability is top notch, I could drink this to no end. Excellent."
"Poured a clear amber color, with lots of cracklin' and fizzin' head. No lace. Tough to pick out any aromas with this one. There was some notes of fruit (presumably apricots) but not much else. Flavor was different. Hoppy, but with a good balancing act by the malts. Finishes sorta funky, with a ""wooden"" aftertaste. A different beer and one that I'd suggest trying just to experience it."
"12 oz bottle, ""packaged in"" date of 04. pours reddish copper, with an off- white head, I cant get much of a nose. Dry grainyness of hops dominate the flavor. Bottle says its an IPA but, not really a nice big punch of hops. Not too impressed with this one, seems to have an identity crisis. Fruit beer/IPA doesnt cut it for either style."
"average mouthfeel that's a little juicy apricot taste. dry hoppy aftertaste, not bitter definetly hoppy. couldn't detect any hints of alcohol, nicely hidden. intesting but I probably won't get this again."
"Aprihop was served from a 12 oz. bottle with a ""packaged in 2004"" notch. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was a lovely and brilliant red-orange-amber hue, and was topped by a weak white head that quickly disapated into a ring form. The nose was quite appetizing, serving up a rich and full hop bouquet that was completely melded with juicy undertones of mango and dried apricot. The taste was suprisingly understated considering the powerful nose. An immediate orangey-bittered maltiness hits the palate with an apricot flavor slowly increasing in intensity all the way through the moderately bittered finish, which left excellent lingering bittered flavors of apricot and mandarin orange. Very good flavors and finishing intensity, but lacking in flow. The body and carbonation were good for the flavors and personality of the brew. I found it to be very drinkable, due to a balanced ratio of sweetness to bitterness, excellent flavor, and my fondness of dried apricots. This beer seems related to the 90 minute in respect to its hop bouquet and body."
"Thanks Ryan."
"Medium body and great drinkability, punch up the aroma and this would be a real winner."
"Pours a deep copper clear liquid with a white foamy, almost creamy head. Nice lace present on the glass as the liquid disappears. Smells of citrus, with a touch of vanilla. Also smells a tad smoky and musty. Taste is slight toasty and astringent. A real dry middle, some bitterness and a touch of apricot in the end. Seems somewhat grainy also. Feels medium bodied with the proper amount of carbonation. Drinkability is decent, doesn't really seem to be a session beer but one would probably be enough for me. Overall I would say an interesting beer. I wasn't really impressed, but not overly disappointed. I would say that many people slam Dogfish, but I can appreciate their creativity. As long as they continue to develop new beers, I will continue to seek them out."
"Hmm, I think I like this better on tap...anyway, Chill haze has worn off, and I can see a clear strong ceylon tea color. Head was as frothy as I could get it when pouring, it has since died down, although I have a thin layer of tan froth and some sheet lacing in the glass. I can smell the beer at least 7 inches away, and as I get closer, I am getting some alcohol covered apricots in the nose. Taste is almost full, with a smooth slippery apricot flavor that finishes with some tannic hoppiness. Not bad, but again, I think more enjoyable on tap, there's a bit more lightness there. This bottle version wasn't heavy, but it was a bit filling."
"A tasty beer, more like an IPA with a touch of fruit than a lambic with extra hops. Not too sweet or syrupy, hops tang more pronounced as it warms. Yum!"
"It feels a little oily in the mouth, perhaps from the sugars present. This is a little too sweet for me to consider it a highly drinkable beer."
"Thank you, ngandhi for this deliciousness."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer, but that's an understatement with this brewery. I like the concept, and it can work quite well, but they aren't quite there yet for me. These hop tastes aren't working with the malts and fruit all that well. Don't know what hop varietals or used, and which ones I'd recommend in their stead."
"The beer pours a reddish/amber color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a really nice balance between malts, hops, and fruit. It has a slight caramel scent that is blended with a slight apricot smell and hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a fine malt complex along side a mild apricot and hop flavor; very nice. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a really cool concept brew. It drinks well."
"Rather remarkable and unique concept behind a beer. Poured an amberish hue with a thinner beige head. Smells of grassy hops and subdued fuzzy apricots. Inviting. Sipping reveals a duality behind it. Initially malty and fruity sweet then turning dry and hoppy in the middle and a melding of the two completes the finish. Impressive, could be a standalone IPA even without the apricots. Overall, it's a bit of the sweeter side which cuts on its drinkability, however a seasonal worth checking out."
"I really enjoyed the beer, but the apricots should shine through...this could be marketed as an IPA and be rated just as good."
"pours an absolutely clear rusty color with an eggshell colored foamy head. little patches of lace stick to the glass. inviting aroma of dried apricots and earthy hops. restrained carbonation, sturdy medium bodied and quite chewy. complex malt and fruit flavors dominate, hops are there but not as assertive as i would have thought. earthy hop whole leaf flavor in the finish. quite smooth and balanced, this is an interesting brew that DFH has pulled off quite well. definitely worth trying."
"ng"
"This beer is a dark amber in color and has an off white head that leaves a little lace. A very big hop boquet with a slight hint of apricot in the aroma. You get a little of the apricot fruitiness as the beer hits your mouth. But it is quickly overpowered by the hops at the middle and end. I was afraid this was going to taste like Magic Hats #9. My fears were ill founded. This is a good hoppy beer. Although I'm sure some severe hop heads might not like that hint of apricot."
"Beer poured with a deep gold color with an orange/red ish hue. Up front this beer comes with the scaled down version of the hoppy bitterness of DFH's IPAs. Once it hits the back of the tongue and goes down the throat, this beer really gives way to the apricots. I can taste them for a minute or two after taking a sip. The apricot flavor really lingers in a subtle way. Similar to sundried turkish apricots. It all finishes up with a snappy, tongue-dry mouthfeel. I wouldn't say this beer hides its 7%abv, but it fits right in with the flavor. I was skeptical about how these flavors would balance (hops, apricots) but it was done, and done well. Heck of an IPAish thing they crafted. Heck of a thing."
"very much reminded me of a magic hat #9 juiced up on hops. pours a nice orange/amber colour with a medium siezed, light tan head which was fairly pillowy and hung around for a while. the smell is mainly of hop and earth, but a touch of apricot is definitely present in the back, but is subtle in a nice way. the taste here is moreso like a full on ipa than i expected, but no complaints. the hops all around are quite nice, and after a few sips the sweet fruit flavour of the apricots kicks in in the back of the flavour as well as in the burps that this one brings about. this is certainly an easy drinking brew and a nice variation on an ipa from the folks at dfh."
"Haha, I definetely like the previous reviewer's description - #9 on drugs - well put. Poured an orange color with a small head that dissapated almost immediately. Aroma is great, apricots and citrusy hops melding together perfectly. The mouthfeel is low in carbonation, very smooth and medium bodied. At first sip, the apricot is not very noticable - it starts of sharp and bitter, goes to a sweet, dry IPA finish and the apricots jump out a second or two after swallowing. Very good characteristics with this brew."
"This is a hit for sure. This would be perfect to finish off the day on a nice summer night. If you see it, grab it."
"This is a very good IPA but the promised fruit seems to be missing. Although I am rating this beer highly, it is not what I expected."
"Drinkability - I would say very drinkable. This is a great back-porch-on-a-warm-spring-evening beer. I will be buying a case of this when it comes available in our area. I will enjoy them often. This is a good drinkin' brew."
"Drinkable, though in small doses, I'd guess."
"Very pretty in the glass. Not much of an apricot taste, though evident in the smell. Good hop character balanced with the malt. All in all a decent IPA except... there was an underlying cleanser/astringency that was tough to overlook. I'll not be buying it again."
" The flavor is pretty good. You start with a decently hopped IPA, and throw in some real apricots, and you end up with a pretty interesting brew. The apricot flavor is not as strong as in some other fruit beers, but the fact that this one has a very noticable hop character as many fruit beers do not really helps it. It is crisp and very drinkable. This is a nice warm weather drinker with a bit more character than most of its challengers. An interesting idea that really can hit the spot."
"Pours golden with slightly amber hue. Less than a one finger head that is very light and airy. Smell is wonderful with hops and apricot present. Duh! Wow, first sip reveals a pale ale with fruity taste but not a typical grapefruit taste as other pale ales or IPA's. No bitter taste. Everything is done very subtly here no sickly sweet fruit taste but a nice balance. Very drinkable and I could see having more than one. No strong aftertaste - a very slight fresh hops taste lingers with every so slight bitterness on edges of the tongue. All in all a nicely balanced brew. Maybe not a top 50 beer but I would drink again."
"Wow, very nice fruit/IPA? This is very similar to the DFH 60 minute in hop level, creaminess, bite and character but with the apricot twist. This is not one of those sickly sweet fruit beers (ala #9) but a very solid IPA with some really faint, clean, citrus and apricot notes that make it even a little more drinkable on a warm day. I had two, could of had another couple as well which is more than I can say for most fruit beers. This really should please IPA lover's AND those of us who look for new, cool seasonal offerings from great brewers. I hope this is a standard seasonal for DFH --- I will have this again throughout April and hope to have it for years to come. A pleasant surprise to find this at a local store which rarely carries anything beyond macro's and SNPA."
"Nice medium body that is just sooo creamy and smooth, all the bubbles just melt over your tongue. Very well built. This would be a great IPA to sit down with on a hot summer day. It's hard to stop at just one....so damn tasty."
"This was very easy to drink, and I'm fairly impressed, especially since so many unique/interesting-sounding beers from DFH have disappointed me as of late."
"Hazy deep copper color with a nice foamy off white head that leaves sticky lacing in my glass. Fruity, citrus aromas, sharp citrus flavors, medium body with a good creamy mouthfeel I get the sweet, mild apricot flavor in the finish. A very well done IPA."
"This has always been a beer that I have wanted to homebrew since I heard about this beer. I am glad that I have had the opportunity to taste it, and this beer has renewed my interest in brewing an example of my own. I especially like the idea to throw norms to the wind & use an extra hoppy style as the base for a fruit beer. Props to Dogfish Head for another creative/ innovative beer."
"Poured into a pint glass, formed a big ol' inch tall light tan head which had some staying power. An orangey amber in color, with serious foamy lacing. Slightly fruity aroma, but more dominated by hops and a tinge of malt. Flavor not really as hoppy as I would have expected for an IPA, and the fruit doesn't seem to be present in the taste at all, almost as if they cancelled each other out on my taste buds or something. The hops does seem to turn it up a notch in the latter part of the mouthfeel. For all I've said the beer remains totally drinkable, and a serious session possibility. Just would have liked the flavor to agree with its name a bit more."
"I was a little sketchy upon first seeing this beer, but I was pleasantly suprised. Dogfish does it again."
"Pours a brilliant copper and sports a thin creamy white head and shows off an elegant/delicate lace pattern throughout. Aromas are rich with hop and sweet malt. The apricot is way off in the distance. In the mouth the beer slides accross the palate-wonderful slick texture! Flavors offer as much sweet malt and bread-like grain flavors as they do snappy hop. The apricot lingers so far in the background that it adds to the beers complexity without defining it-as an apricot beer. Boy this is good! It is almost sweet, but at the same time so very crisp and clean! My friend had this with a duckbreast sandwich, and said it paired with alacrity! Highly recommended!!!"
"Appearance: Pleasant copper hue with a nice frothy cream hued head leaves nice even bands of lacing around my glass. Aroma: A nice toasted malt profile wrapped in an orgy of hop aromatics very nice with a touch apricots making it's mark on the aroma. Taste: Hoppy pine tones with moderately roasted malts creating some woody and caramel tones nice flow to it, with just enough presence of the apricot great tasting mild but still packs a decent unnoticeable shot of alcohol weighing in at 7% abv. Mouthfeel: Medium body silky texture with a creamy edge, nice. Drinkability: Excellent session brew I would partake in a sixer of this without much thought put behind it."
"The mouthfeel is smooth. Medium bodied. This is a quite nice drinking beer for a fruit flavored beer. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability is good but over sweetness of the fruit doesn't mix well with the basic IPA that is there."
"Taste: This one tastes like the apricot seed at first. The first taste is the apricot pit. I dont know if it is the combination of hops and apricot being too similar, but it tastes like the pit of the apricot(not bad). It is hoppy right at the begining and nicely mellows out. The end is a nice IPA aftertaste."
"It is a deep copper color. The aroma has plenty of sweet fruit and some hops in it. It is malty with apricot notes in the background. I like how the apricot taste is there, but it is not at the forefront. It finishes with a big dry bitterness. The apricot really lingers in the aftertaste. A good beer that melds together a very hoppy IPA and some great fruit."
"This brew kicks the wimpy Magic Hat #9's ass!"
"Overall I was very impressed with this new brew. I was apprehensive to try it as I'm not really a fan of #9, but other reviews convinced me I should give it a shot. Glad I did, I believe this will be the perfect summer session brew."
"I must say I approached this one with hesitation, which is why I begged for a single to test out first before committing to a 4 pack. It pourd a fairly dark amber color and formed a huge foamy white head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of malt, hops and some floral elements with maybe only a slight hint of apricot. The flavor was of malt, hops and apricot. The malt in my opinion seemed to hold more sway than it should over the hops. The hops were present, but more apparent in the bitterness of the finish. I just could get into the flavor of this one. Not a bad beer, but didn't impress me, either."
"Malty sweet, a touch beady. Apricot flavour is clear, but not overpowering. A hint of apple hides in the background. The hops then take over and drive it home. A little bit orangey, a little bit woodsy, & a pretty damn dry finish. Medium body, relaxed carbonation. Looking forward to some summertime BBQ with this."
"I'll admit, with DFH's general reputation preceding the beer, I was expecting #9 on steriods, but it is indeed more than just that. The fruit itself was predictable, but the interplay with the malt and hops offered up a surprisingly bright and refreshing effect. The aroma intrigues nicely, and the flavor gives it credence. Despite still not being the world's biggest fruit beer fan, the cool combination makes it pleasurably drinkable. So it seems, toss some earthy fruit into a good IPA, and you end up with something fun and feisty. Leave it to DFH to figure that out."
"Extremely nice blend of hops and fruity flavor Very decent head wuth nice lacing afterward. Smell was definitely a blend of hops and apricot. Likewise taste was the same blend , but with a nice balance bewteen the fruit and hops. An intriguing an d well-rounded taste. Mouthfeel was medium with a nice hoppy zest at the finish. Very drinkable for 6.6 abv. Would definitely have another."
"Indeed, an interesting brew. There have already been comparisons to Magic Hat #9, and rightfully so, though this is more experimental, has more hops, and is just better. Golden orange in color, has a wonderful sweet nose of apricot, spice, and hops. The apricots are the most noticeable aroma. Flavor blends the hops and fruit very very well, with the apricot flavor adding a nice sweet touch to the bittering agent of the hops. Alcohol is hardly detectable, and at 6.6% really shouldn't be too noticeable anyway. Apricots = good, hops = good...this is a very nice beer. Bottle this one boys!"
"Had this on tap at Andy's Corner Bar. Really enjoyed it. I like apricots and there are definitely apricots in here. Really smooth in flavor. Not too high in alcohol. Really clean in flavor. Orange in color. Very fruity beer. Hoppy and malty. Aroma is clean. Good beer."
"Nice golden yellow color with a white head. Hoppy fruity smell with a hint of sweet malt. Initial fruit (apricot) taste with a sharpish hoppy bite that balences the brew well. A little sweetness is left on the tip of the tongue. Smooth medium mouth with a dry tongued finish. Solid and refreshingly drinkable."
"I ran into Aprihop at our October, 2003 Beer Barons of Milwaukee officers meeting. I had no idea what I was ordering, but being a Dogfish Head creation I was sure to be different. The glass I received had a nice half inch thick head sitting upon a slightly cloudy straw colored beer. When I raised it to my nose I detected the aroma of Cascade hops. I thought to myself that this was just another American Pale Ale. Upon tasting it, I couldn't have been more wrong. I have to tell you that I'm not a fan of fruit beers, but THIS fruit beer made me a convert. Very complex. That's how I would describe my initial reaction. I couldn't decide what I enjoyed more: the APA bitterness, the subtle sweetness which no doubt was due to the apricots, the almost subliminal taste of the apricots themselves, or the perfect carbonation which only enhanced everything else. All in all a fantastic beer. Being a homebrewer, I'm already planning to duplicate this beer."
"The beer pour a bit of an orange-ish color. There was a light tan head. A bit of apricot to the nose, with a hint of hops in the background. The beer was medium-bodied, with a light taste of apricots. There was a good balance of malts and hops backing it up. This was quite excellent."
"A very interesting and unique beer to say the least. It's hoppy, it's apricot, it's aprihop. Very few beers live up to their name so well."
"One of the funkiest beers I've ever had .. don't know the lavender flavor with the hops is a good combination but the beer taste DRY like it leaves you wanting something to quench your thirst. Very flowery and dry in the nose and taste with low malt balance in this beer.. not one I'd seek but worth a try at a beer fest."
"This ale poured a hazy, light brown-amber color with white foam that settled but coated the glass and left some lace. The smell was hoppy (floral hops) and malty, but not really much apricot, if any, could be detected. The taste was sweet malt and mild apricot with a good dose of hops, floral and bitter and fruity. Nicely balanced and the apricot did not dominate. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and carbonation. There was a sweet, lightly fruity aftertaste. The drinkability was good; a very nice fruit beer."
"Pours no head. No lacing. A few medium-sized bubbles make their way from the bottom of the glass, through the semi-cloudy, orange-brown beer, to the top of the glass. Aroma... apricot! and hops! But it's not as hoppy as I expected. It's most noticable in the aftertaste. Poppy, bubble-gum mouthfeel. This beer is best very cold."
"This is the prime example of a fruit-flavored English-style beer. Ignoring the Belgian-inspired creations, this is exactly what a fruit beer should be. An orange-ish, salmon colored brew with some definite haze. Huge apricot nose envelopes any more subtle aromas that might be creeping up. The sensation carries through the palate and into the aftertaste mixing briefly with some bitter hop and fruit salad notes at the finish. A very well-crafted beer."
"Had this beer at the Grey Lodges firkinteenth event and was surprised that it was served in a 16 oz. plastic cup. I thought I was at a high school kegger! Despite that, the beer poured a very cloudy and dull orange-brown. It looked like apple cider. The small white head faded quick. I had been excited to try this beer and was not disappointed. It was almost like a high quality IPA (60 minute?) blended together with a sweet apricot cider. Hops were floral and still very detectable. Fruit sweetness was not overwhelming but blended in perfectly. Very drinkable and an excellent fruit beer."
"Had this last night at Bukowski's. Very intersting stuff. Kind of like Magic Hat # 9, but doubled and with much more hops. It had a huge apricot and hop nose, very light & creamy on the palate, very falvourful and very drinkable. An IPA that meets a fruit beer. Hmm? I like it."
"On tap at Redbones this evening...I'd never even heard of this before tonight. Dogfish's website says this is an IPA brewed with apricots; I didn't really pick up any apricot flavor, but there are certainly plenty of hops up front that end up very well balanced by maltier flavors. Mostly hops in the nose, though not too strongly so. If I see this again I'll be asking for it."
"Tasted like a big fat Magic Hat #9 (Magic Hat Brewing, Vermont). IPA  ? Huh? This is an experimental beer regardless of what the brewery says. An IPA with fruit added is experimental, flowing smoothness and almost reminiscent of some new Belgian upstarts that throw fruit and excessive hops into a delicate brew. Madness that I like."
