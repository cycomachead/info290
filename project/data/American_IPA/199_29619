This beer has a huge citrus aroma, hops a-plenty yet still so smooth and balanced. As the glass goes down and the beer opens up a bit it just gets better and better. Had from a can today with the code 15050, so I think it means it was canned on the 50th day of 2015, so late February. Taste was superb, can't really find fault with Sculpin. This was my first IPA a bunch of years back when my buddy gave me a bomber, now it's a regular!","Jwburns75","Apr 04, 2015"

However, one sip and it was clear that this is a world class beer worthy of its awards.  Ballast Point recently came to WI, and I was excited to try their beers.  Tried it on draft, and it was supremely balanced and well-crafted in every capacity.  Not the most extreme IPA, but certainly not plain either.  Plenty of citrus and pine hoppiness, but also fresh tasting; substantial without ever seeming too heavy.  One of those IPAs that is just clearly above 95% of a very crowded market.","milwaukee512","Mar 29, 2015"

Just a hint of astringent bitterness on the back of the palate but overall nice balanced mouthfeel.  This has been in my regular rotation since I first tasted it.  Very disappointed when I get an old bottle or a low turnover draft (I know, how could a keg of this last too long?).  Lives up to the hype.","KidDoc","Feb 15, 2015"

This beer is great, but I think it would be even better if the bittering hops were toned down a touch. This would allow the citrus and tropical fruits to linger rather than a more bitter linger. I still want IPA status bitterness, but just a touch less. This beer would go nicely with a a shrimp ceviche and a mango salsa. I give it a 94.5/100.","DaverCS","Feb 08, 2015"

Strong flavors never jump out at you, but settle very nicely in the mouth. Had the grapefruit and habanero recently (both ok), but it's nice to get back to the original. While I really like this beer, I'm surprised by the bro's score of 100. It certainly ranks as one of the top IPAs, though.  Definitely worth whatever you can get your hands on if you are a hopheads.","hotpauko","Feb 01, 2015"

Smell is a combination of bready malt and dank, weedy hops. Very nice. Tastes of malt, hop oils, pine, earth and a hint of citrus. Lingers quite long on the palate. Mouth feel is spot as is the carbonation. Overall I like this beer but am not blown away by it.

4.6,4.3,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"For a "west coast" IPA, Sculpin is about as good as it gets. Pricey as it gets, too! Poured into a snifter, its a beautiful, clear orange/gold in appearance, with a moderate white head that leaves thick lacing on the glass while maintaining a ring around the edges and a sizeable island in the middle. The nose, for me, is largely citrus and tropical fruit over a whiff of biscuity malt. Taste is where it really shines--the citrusy hops are balaced with a piney bitterness (though not too bitter) over a very tastey malt backbone of bread and bisquit, low on caramel. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light on first impression, but leans to medium in the middle and thickens in the aftertaste, which is moderately bitter, in a really good fashion. Carbonation is perfect for the style--meaning high enough to balance and accentuate the hop and malt flavors.Overall, it's my favorite IPA--after Bell's Two-Hearted and Surly Furious. Is it worth the price? On occassion, or at least when I'm feeling flush.","Jim_Benz","Jan 22, 2015"

4.41,0,4.5,4.75,4.25,4,4.5,"Sculpin has a pleasant honey color with a surprising degree of clarity. A bit lighter and brighter than I expected. Quite a vivacious brew. So much so that I had to pour the can in to an IPA glass in stages, to prevent the foam from spilling over the top. The dense, white frothy head stood at least 3 fingers tall, cresting over the top of the glass by a good margin. Great soapy retention that lingered while gradually revealing pretty lacing. Big sweet citrus hops in the nose. As soon as the can popped open there was a burst of perfume fragrance. A subtle pine cone aroma underlies the zesty citrus. The flavors marry lightly toasted malts with a potent hop character. Despite the enormous hop profile, the bitterness is restrained. They're more of the tropical mango variety with a sweet grapefruit zest. There's a little alcohol warmth, without being distracting. A surprisingly clean finish with only some enduring tropical hop flavor. With a medium mouthfeel and corresponding carbonation this is quite easy to drink. That came as a bit of a surprise given the ABV and bold hop qualities. This is a well-balanced IPA that highlights hops in such a fashion as to give them center stage, but without overwhelming the senses. Big and balanced. I tend to prefer more pine and relish the intense hop bitterness, but this stands out to me for its supreme drinkability. This is an IPA that is accessible to both hop heads and neophytes alike.","JohnnyI","Jan 11, 2015"

Very enjoyable right off the bat; for me it's strong points are in the nose and head. The aromas shine through and the head makes this an enjoyable downer or sipper. All in all, I probably will pass on this again. Mainly because in 2015 I feel this is an outdated beer and there are better, unique ones out there. Definitely a must have though if you've not had it.","santomark","Dec 19, 2014"

4.66,5.7,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,"I first drank this lovely at Stone in Escondido in 2007. At the time I was blown away by the citrus forward aspect of this beer. A couple of years later I toured the brewery just before this beer blew up in the national sense. We had a personal tour and were told they were putting 7 varieties of hops in each batch. The expen$e to make this ale was considerable.  Thus the addiction began. I believe that, with my uncle, we put this beer on the map on the East coast because we were drinking at least a pallet/year. I have a set of garage doors nailed with thousands of caps to prove our consumption!! But what happened? As they grew this brew dropped off. I remember that on our West coast visit they were expanding tankage to outside fermenters. I believe this and hop shortages/prices changed this beer. Pliny on tap on the East coast, at least at Monk's, is close to what you taste in Santa Rosa. I can't say the same for Sculpin. Like a first love, she always fades with time. Thus the toying with grapefruit, kiwi, habaneros, etc to cover up the loss of what made this beer unique.  Ballast boys- get back to the basics and make less so that we have "more"!","Riggsby","Dec 17, 2014"

Having consumed these top IPA's numerous times and side by side, I have come to the conclusion that Sculpin tops them all. A rare combination of all that hoppiness has to offer in a very drinkable brew. Many may consider this a very hop forward beer but in the spectrum of what is out there these days, Sculpin offers a hop experience that is flavorful and very smooth. Best of the class.","NorCalBrewBuff","Nov 07, 2014"

I don't know if that is how it is intended to be or if they have faded over time.  I did enjoy this, but I definitely doesn't live up to the hype.  since there is no bottle date I will be reluctant to try it again unless i know it is fresh.","Zetcha7x","Nov 06, 2014"

Basically impossible to tell it is fresh with no clear bottled on date. I'll give you all a tip who haven't had it before, it should be very pleasant citrus flavors, but not overpowering. If there is a metallic smell or taste of any kind, it is not fresh and take it back to your retailer.","daveg36","Nov 04, 2014"

I'm sure it was good, but cmon, get a freshness date clearly marked on your bottle so I don't have to fuck around.  Second, it's way overpriced compared to Bell's Two Hearted Ale, and the Noda Hop, Drop & Roll, which are IPA staples,  and competing for my business for that style in my area.. Third, when you have other fresh beers that are very good, and this one isn't fresh, your taste buds begin to tell you that the other's are better, even if they may not be all things being equal fresh Sculpin vs. fresh Two Hearted vs. fresh Hop Drop. You guys need to fix this. I already complained about this, and received free beer, but the issue has still not been rectified.","DaveHopSculp","Oct 18, 2014"

I had it at some random sports bar with a mixed crowd and velvet couches, but I was happy to get lost in my active enjoyment of the beer over gorgeous flatscreens showing two super exciting, MAJOR, college football upsets at the bar - it was easy too.  Many people have rated this meticulously and eruditiously on the quality of it's various elements, but let me tell you, this beer is all "emotion and feel;" no need to quantify the greatness of this beer.","ASirahSyrah","Oct 01, 2014"

Taste is sweet caramel malt followed by some good citrus hops with some very good grapefruit tangy notes. A medium bodied brew has a smooth mouth feel and moderate carbonation, easy on the palate and taste buds.

I know its probably common on the West Coast, and even in specialty shops all over the US, but I was thrilled to find it in Asheville, NC.

Lots of citrus and pine flavors, a little more sweetness to counter balance the hop bitterness, which is nice. Overall, smooth, beautifully balanced, and packs just the right amount of bite, while still incredibly drinkable and refreshing. I will buy this again and again and again!!!","ddukes3","Aug 19, 2014"

Taste is strong citrus hops, fruity sweetness and a bitter bite at the finish. There is an undercurrent of bready malt. Mouthfeel is moderately thick and definitely sticky with hop resin. This is an excellent substitute for Pliny the Elder when it's not available. The two beers are on par with one another.","Antnego","Aug 13, 2014"

5,13.4,5,5,5,5,5,"Just about my all time favorite IPA. What can I say to start it off... Its juicy, floral, fresh and crisp. Ballast Point truly made a world class beer. The nose has pleasant notes of lemon, tangerine, peach and pine. It is floral and light with fresh hints of melon, honey, and many citrus flavors that all come together with a crisp bite and a dry, yet juicy finish. I always look for that special beer which hits me as a masterpiece keeps me coming back to get more and more. Sculpin IPA truly fills that title. To me, its perfect. It is a testament to what creativity and experimentation can produce. Give it a try.","AyeMito","Aug 13, 2014"

The bitterness is balanced extraordinarily well with the hop aroma and comes on slowly in the finish. It has a nice Malty backbone and a pleasant and very evident citrusy, lemon quality that survives through the finish. This is a well crafted IPA. The hops are the star but the malt isn't pushed aside. It has it's own little identity. Truly one of my favorite IPA's... ever.","slusk","Jul 27, 2014"

3.03,-31.3,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Ballast Point Sculpin is listed by many as a great beer. I am often times leery of mass approval of anything, with that in mind I gave this IPA a try. it was poured into a pint glass and did have a very pleasing light color for an IPA. The aroma was strong but not overpowering and when I took the first sip, I realized many voters are just towing the party line. I like IPAs but I get the since many of these brews are made the "drier" the better and to me that takes away from savoring the flavor. I would drink it again but I don't consider this a fantastic brew. I prefer Ballast Point's Wahoo White which I consider to be an excellent brew. But for the craft beer aficionado this beer would be well worth a sample beer or two to see if it is your cup of tea (so to speak)","ordybill","Jul 15, 2014"

If someone wanted me to suggest an IPA, I think this is the perfect blueprint of the type. It's not overpowering and too bitter like some heavy IPAs or doubles, the alcohol level is high but reasonable, the flavors mingle perfectly and it has a wonderful balance of carbonation, sweetness, bitterness and virtually no unpleasant aftertastes. Big big props to Ballast Point on this award winner.","jsausley","Jul 10, 2014"

4.55,3.2,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from can into willy glass. A slightly hazy golden-copper color with a thin head that persists. Aroma is a blast of floral, dank, piney hops...it's wonderful. Taste is also dank and floral mixed with some caramel and butterscotch. The bitterness lingers offsetting the fairly malty backbone. Mouthfeel is great....carbonation that lasts and a silky smooth texture throughout. Overall, this is a great IPA, worth picking up even considering the $15/6-pack.","FFreak","Jul 01, 2014"

Either way, Sculpin is an exceptional IPA and a fine example of the work that Ballast Point is doing. The taste is full of fruit flavors (mainly peach, lemon, and grapefruit), complemented by a piney hop finish. The flavor is intense, but the malt keeps it from being overpowering. Additionally, It's listed as 7.0% abv, but you'd never guess it. The only downside is that it is a little on the pricey side--I guess you get what you pay for.","thomda11","Jun 08, 2014"

Not overly bitter and I think rather than trying to pack as much hops into the can as they could, Ballast was more focused on creating a solid drinkable IPA. Mission accomplished.

I've had it old and fresh this being a fresh review. Like any other IPA an older bottle will lose a lot. That being said, this is a winner and one that holds a candle up to some of the more world class IPAs that cannot be found in 6 packs.

The fresh Sculpin was the best ipa I have ever had. It was crisp and clean with the perfect notes and bitterness. West coast IPAs- fanfreakingtastic.","tmbgnicu","May 21, 2014"

I will say that I've had other IPA's that have a fresher smell and flavor from the bottle. That's the main thing keeping me from rating it a perfect. I'm drinking it 51 days after it was bottled, and I purchased it from a store that uses refrigerated storage, so it should be fairly fresh. Keeping that in mind I would buy other beers that I know I can get fresher. I don't want to make any of this sound negative, it's just something I wanted to add for my own future reference.

Big citrus, mostly grapefruit notes, accentuated by peach and apricot giving this a largely fruity nose. Taste delivers, with some nice grapefruit bite, peach and mango all tied together with a sweet almost graham cracker malt bill. It finishes slightly bitter, but not nearly as much as expected. Very pleasing clean finish. Medium mouthfeel that's just spot on with carbonation. Great IPA that deserves its place toward the top.","HopBomb515","Apr 05, 2014"

It's actually a really good, really smooth, really flavorful beer. Until about 5-10 seconds after it goes down. Then that aweful, bitterness overcomes the mouth and has you cringing, waiting for it to pass until the next sip. But the bitterness just never leaves. It's a beer that COULD be amazing, but the bitter after-taste is completely off-putting. I love a super hoppy ale...but Im not a bitter fan. Give me fresh, springy, whole cone hops in abundance. But the ale better be complete with a fresh, crisp finish. This beer doesnt fit my bill. If you're a fan of bitter IPAs, then this beer is for you. But in my opinion, theres nothing world class about it - at all. Mye I've got used to the more malty backbones of DIPAs like Dirt Wolf, 90 minute IPA, etc. Although I'd even rank Southern Tier's IPA well ahead of this. Because its springy and hoppy, without being bitter and hard to finish. I might rate this offering slightly higher if at had a little more abv, at least I could start to feel good while choking it down. But I don't see what the hype is. It's an okay beer, but if you never had it, you wouldn't be missing much.","sobuf","Mar 15, 2014"

The nose is a complex blend of grapefruit, mango and other sweet tropicals against a subtle spruce. Light medium body with a smooth texture. The carbonation level is a touch above normal. The outstanding flavor profile is expertly complex and follows the nose. Grapefruit leads then flows into the sweeter hop flavors. In the middle the biscuit malt comes through against a subtle spruce flavor. The finish effervesces into a grapefruit bitter tartness over a caramel sweetness.

Also, the beer had a mushy, medium-sized head with patchy lacing on the side. Very rich aromas mixed with citrus flavors, like grapefruit, and plant tastes like pine and herbs. These aromas were quite good in the sense that were balanced: nothing too strong, but very noticeable. Good taste of citrus, like lemon and orange, as well as malts and hops. Loved that lingering bitterness that came with every sip. Great, crisp mouthfeel that makes this beer refreshing, while not being a watered down drink.

The taste followed suite with some nice malty sweetness at first but quickly transitioning to spicy, floral hops with hints of pine and citrus rind. The finish is very dry and smacks of American bittering hops. Medium carbonation and body fit for style and keep the beer light and refreshing.

Hop character was weak and grassy, no citrusy/tropical fruit flavors. Draft has been inconsistent too - sometimes boozy and thin, sometimes decently hoppy, sometimes malty. What the heck happened to that juicy hop bomb like when it first came to the boston area in bombers? I think I'm about done with this beer as I am with GF WC IPA - two beers ruined by increased production.","Longstaff","Feb 13, 2014"

The aroma is of grapefruit and orange with a fresh pine punch. Some grass, herbs, and wet earth fill out the middle with a lemony zest towards the end. It tastes similar, with some large citrus notes up front that readily fade to a muddled, earthy center. Bitter hops give way to a soapy aftertaste on the finish, especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is thinner than anticipated, but well carbonated. Refreshing throughout with a dry finish. Overall, a solid IPA that I thoroughly enjoy. While there are plenty of new options available today, this one remains a staple and a great example of the style.","eclipse54","Feb 11, 2014"

The aroma is captivating with scents of citrus and hops and slight spice at the back of the nose. While the aroma is captivating the taste is addictive, a magnificent blend of bitter hops, citrus, bready malts, and a earthy over tone make for a fantastic beer. The beer has just the right mix of medium body and carbonation to enjoy from beginning to end.

Head in moderation, carbonation delicate. Aroma like slicing a grapefruit in half- fresh, clean,inticing. Mouth feel- the Sculpin is break dancing on my palette. Of course grapefruit, tangerine,floral oils, but not nearly as fluent as Big Eye. This beer is bold yet exquisite what ever that means in beer,I guess in your face good.

Taste was spicy, piney, bitter, and out-freaking-standing. Just exactly what a juicy IPA should be. Medium body and a slippery mouthfeel fit the style perfectly. A bit of sugary sweetness in the finish to complement the bitterness. Drinkable beyond words, Can I have another please.","rajendra82","Jan 18, 2014"

That sums up why Scuplin is one of my favorites. There are plenty of IPAs with hop additions and grains that are similar to Scuplin, but never quite hit the bullseye like Scuplin. It really nice West Coast style ale, but gives the grapefruit hop aromas just the right finish, so as not to underwhelm or have that one note hop taste. Fantastic beer and highly recommended.","Fcip78","Jan 15, 2014"

I stumbled upon it at some tiny little craft beer/DIY brewing store in Port Jefferson NY. I wish I remembered the name because it was a great little store with a great selection and good help. Anyway, the beer caught my eye, and I said "Finally!!" Snagged it off the shelf and back to my hotel room I go! Fantastic taste and mouthfeel. I had it around room temperature so I could really get a feel of this beer. And it delivered! Since then I've purchased it several times as well as had it on tap. I think I prefer it from the bottle to a glass myself. But either way, get on this beer if you already haven't!","MarkAvery","Dec 23, 2013"

Not much malt going on. 7% ABV isn't too hot either. Good mouthfeel as the bitterness doesn't scorch the tongue or palate. A very solid IPA. Not the best you can find in San Diego or even SoCal for that matter but a solid choice nonetheless. I was very glad to find it at Brewforia in Meridian, Idaho. So thanks to them for getting it fresh to a relatively small market. Cheers Ballast Point!","TheFlern","Sep 15, 2013"

For a beer classified as an IPA this is a lesson and perfect example of artisan craftsmanship and deliberately imparting these flavours into a beer with the hops (Does anyone else feel a good amount of IPAs are just packed with hops without any rhyme or reason these days? Particularly double IPAs?) . Great work and if I wound up with another one of these in my lifetime, I'd call it KARMA!","alucardswordlol","Sep 12, 2013"

4.61,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.75,4.75,"Due to the shop I purchased this fine beer at I'm very inclined to believe it's fresh. Gazing upon this glass I see the picture of perfection when it comes to the proper appearance for an IPA. There's effervescence, flawless clarity, a foamy white head of some size, and the hue of a golden sun. The aroma is fresh and alluring, like fresh flowers and ripe citrus fruit. There's a notable presence of tropical fruits as well, such as pineapple and mango. It seems very juicy and zesty! Just like my favorite beers should, I am pleasantly surprised by the flavor due to its complexity. It is merely kissed by those fruity aspects of the aroma, because it's true heart is chock full of resinous, earthy bitterness. There must be an inclusion of Simcoe hops, because that type of "fine cigar" reminiscence is unmistakable. I absolutely love how the more coarse bitterness pulls on the palate while the lighter flavors dance in and out with each sip. There's just a tiny bit of breadiness from the malts, which is just right for this mix. The brewers at Ballast Point came up with a fantastic recipe here, that is a rare treat. It sticks and coats to the mouth too, just how I like the mouthfeel to be. The finish is dry, but not too dry. I also like how the ABV is not off the charts so I can drink a few of them. Overall, this is definitely one of the finest IPAs on the market.","Neorebel","Sep 08, 2013"

Had it tonight and nothing I would change about my August review except this time it might not have been quite as powerfully hoppy due to the two months the bottle had on it. Still no hop bitterness slouch though by a long shot. Drank from a Sierra Nevada IPA glass this time and the heavy surface pile of white foam really stood out to the end, as did a full pattern of lacing. Refreshing despite the fact it is now only 52 degrees outside. UPDATE2 10/26/13 another from the sixpack and same deal, but no complaints about the hop bite being less than at first. Still going very strong. Drank this one from an Innis & Gunn stemmed flute. Loads of lacing at the end again too.","scotorum","Aug 05, 2013"

Bringing much more pine and resin flavor than citrus, the sculpin sits a little heavier on the palate, making it a great dinner or afternoon sipping beer rather than a great six-packer or multiple quaff. Hop forward but not overly so, it's biscuit and caramel malt character ground it well.","dwren89","Aug 01, 2013"

Sculpin is a clean IPA similar to various offerings from Lagunitas, but less punchy than Founders. It's not as sweet as it smells, but hoppier than the nose suggests. It's also cleaner than a double IPA, while carrying some DIPA characteristics that I enjoy. The finish is dry and leaves your palette in a position to try something radically different without the side effects of stronger/wilder IPAs. This is a great everyday IPA, and I'd rate it higher if it were priced more reasonably. I don't think it's worth as much as it costs, but that's subjective.","Bauzen","Jul 03, 2013"

I don't know how fresh this is, but I was expecting a bit more out of this one. The bitter is there, I just wanted more floral or citrus presence. It's there, don't get me wrong, I just expected more given all the hype I've heard.

Golden orange in color, somewhat hazy but mostly clear. Rapidly thinning cream-colored head. Appealing thick, sticky lacing. Aromas of pine, candied grapefruit, lemon rind. Slight malt sweetness at first, but a sturdy bitterness quickly takes over and sustains throughout the finish. A caramel-sweet base carries massive citrus rind and pine sap flavors. Some soft apricot and mango notes appear throughout. Nice and light on the palate with a smooth, dry finish. Must-try for IPA aficionados, although somewhat pricey at $9 a bottle.","orfeu","Jun 21, 2013"

My local guy will only procure an amount he can sell fresh and then it is a wait till the distributor reloads. One of my favorites.","surfcaster","Jun 21, 2013"

After trying HT I've now placed Sculpin at #2 on my IPA list... Sad story but nonetheless an awesome beer. Clear gold/amber color and citrus fruit on the nose. Mouth feel is good, very dry after it goes down with some bitterness. GREAT BEER. $$$","SDbrewerJake","Jun 20, 2013"

3.69,-16.3,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Pours out a clear brassy gold. Thin head. Some piney/citrus hops in the nose with a pale maltiness that's fairly prevalent. Touch of booze in the nose. Taste is fairly balanced overall. Quite a bit of maltiness and sweetness up front. Dries out in the finish a touch. Doesn't beat you over the head with hop flavor but has a pretty punchy bitterness in the finish. Bitterness lingers. I enjoy the bitterness, but I'd prefer a touch more hop flavor. Mouthfeel isn't thick and syrupy, which is a very good thing, but it could use a bit more body. Carbonation could be a little more assertive for my tastes. Overall this is a pretty solid IPA with nothing really "off" about it. I really just don't understand the $15 price tag for the 6 though. Give me a Stone IPA over this in flavor and price, but I can't really hate on this either. Again, this is solid, but I just don't understand the hype.","goochpunch","Jun 16, 2013"

Reminiscent of its English ancestors, it dissipates quickly but still manages to leave nice sticky lacing. The aroma is big and bold, with nice tropical fruit notes. The taste is equally delicious and the numerous hops additions are apparent. The body is actually a little thinner than I would've thought for such a hopped up beer but it doesn't detract in any way. It's an incredible IPA.","delta490","Jun 13, 2013"

I don't know but it seems that the majority of IPA's I drink with some kind of fish, fisherman, etc are kickass and this one is no different. This one was recommended to me by someone at the local bottle shop as I was browsing. At first I was hesitant to purchase an 22oz IPA for $7.99... I mean a DIPA maybe but an IPA??? He assured me it would be worth it so I took the bait(no pun intended with the fishing analogies). Well I'll be hooked(hey another fishing analogy) but he was right... this is one killer IPA. A perfect balance between hops and malt and everything in between. Amazing! Reminds me of another IPA with a fish on it from the great lakes... very nice. I know I shouldn't base part of my score off of price but I'm gonna have to slightly lower the overall by .25 simply due to it is overpriced for a 22oz bomber IMHO though I assume not the brewery's fault... if i could find this in a 6pk in my area it just may be a go-to.

Smells of floral hops with tropical fruit; pineapple and mango are noticeable. Taste is less hoppy than the smell; sweet and clear up front with hops coming in at the end, quite a bitter finish though. A great drinkable IPA though; if the hop flavor had been all throughout, it would have been more of a sipper.","BurgeoningBrewhead","May 17, 2013"

And definitely don't age this beer. But when fresh it is pretty much flawless. It is closer in style to a Founders then a Three Floyds as it does not have all the citrus on the nose like a Floyds or even in the taste but it is a great beer. I would never say no to a Sculpin in fact I would hunt it out. It is worth the money.","vinny21bal","May 09, 2013"

Pours a nice copper color and the carbonation and head of the beer stayed consistent throughout the glass. As you get the initial smell, you know they banged out a perfect IPA.

4.3,-2.5,5,5,3.75,4.5,4.25,"I don't think I've ever poured a beer with such beautiful rich hearty golden color. The light fruity smell, in my opinion, is absolutely perfect. Let me say, I am still trying to become an IPA fan but I still struggle with the bitterness. As far as IPA's go though, this one is quite tasty although that may be that I am a fan of grapefruit and Sculpin tastes ALOT like grapefruit. Very thin and light in the mouth, that I really like, with a very light and fluffy head, that I also I like. I was drinking this one with some chips and salsa and for me, I don't think IPAs and salty foods go that well together. I think it really accentuates the bitterness of the IPA. Seems like it would have gone a lot better with a nice medium rare piece of beef. Next time....","faulkster4","Apr 27, 2013"

4.48,1.6,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.75,"Finally, at long last, I got the chance to enjoy a sculpin. actually, I enjoyed three of them! the setting was the strip house steak joint in the planet Hollywood casino in las vegas, Nevada. I sat down with my hockey teammates, who all ordered a fancy cabernet, but I asked to glance at the beer list, and there it was, sculpin ipa. it poured a beautiful cloudy grassy pale golden color, with an inch or so of off white head that lasts forever, leaves excellent lacing, and is easily reinvigorated with a swirl the wine glass I asked the server to bring me. the nose on it is long and hoppy, but not in that dank oily sweet fruity way that some of these are, but more subtle, not more simple, but more in focus, more sure of its identity. there are notes of fresh pineapple and spruce, but this is neither bitter nor sweet. its got an impressive degree of malt balance, as well as a yeast character that reminds me of some of the European ipa offerings. the flavor is standalone. its got a gorgeous hop bouquet, with some floral notes in there too, but I cannot quite place any of the specific varietals. less citrus and more pine than I expected, and a forever finish that's both refreshing and filling to a degree. the alcohol is impossible to pick out. feel is also lovely, with effervescently bright carbonation that tickles the tongue without being invasive, and a medium body that doesn't stand in the way of the flavor. this was the absolutely perfect complement to a 20 ounce bone in ribeye, dry aged, rare. I had three of these with my steak, and would have had more if they weren't 12 bucks a go. what a glorious ipa this is, distinct from the crowd, and worth every word of the hype. really sensational brew.","StonedTrippin","Apr 23, 2013"

It started off promising with a great appearance and a bold fruity/yeasty aroma but the flavor was so overly harsh and unbalanced. After reading other rave reviews I wondered if I had an old bottle but there's an "enjoy by" date right on the label that read 07/13/13 so I have to assume this is relatively fresh. The lively hop aroma certainly attested to that. Its unfortunate the flavor didn't live up to the smell. I really wanted to love this and while its by no means a bad beer, it is unbalanced and excessively bitter in my opinion.","WolfsbaneBloom","Mar 21, 2013"

I get a fair amount of juicy orange, which I like, but it doesn’t have the biggest bite and there’s a funky aftertaste I can’t quite place.

A bit sour with a very small hint of sweetness. Mostly floral, hardly any citrus in the aroma at all. Taste is a little better, but not by much. Still no citrus. Just some bitter hops. Thin body, not much mouthfeel. Has sort of a "tea-like" flavor to it that throws me off. The finish is clean, doesn't leave much of an aftertaste -- I guess that's the best part of the beer. This is $13.99 in my area and it's actually worth about HALF of that. A big disappointment for me.","DrewV","Feb 17, 2013"

Bottle date enjoy by 7-28-13. This beer pours a nice golden amber with a finger of head. The first thing that really stands out is the aroma of fresh tropical fruits and citrus with a small hint of alcohol. The taste is outstanding, piney, citrus hop bite with a hint of malt. Outstanding job by Ballast Point on their flagship brew, deserves all the hype it gets! A staple in my fridge as long as they keep churning it out!","Qwest_35","Feb 11, 2013"

Taste is malty for an IPA but has a nice hop presence too. This was a little less hoppy than I prefer. It is extremely balanced and easy drinking but it didn't hit me at a 100.

This is one of the prettiest IPAs I have seen. Smell is divine, with floral grapefruit, pine, apricot, and mango. Smells sweet but not overly so. Best smelling for a non-double ipa for me.

Flavor follows the nose - it's awesomely citrusy and juicy with a nice bitterness and a only minor malt character. Very light and easy to drink. It's medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is an awesome IPA that's packed with the flavor of a DIPA but with a lower ABV that makes it dangerously drinkable. I'm so happy that Ballast Point now distributes to DC as this may very well replace Bell's Two Hearted as my go-to IPA.","starrdogg","Nov 28, 2012"

I chose the Sculpin IPA after reading reviews here for it. I picked up a bomber at my grocer. The taste was very smooth and the IPA bitterness was right where it should be in my opinion. The hops are obvious but so well balanced that it won't turn you off even if you are a non IPA fan this is a good beer. ABV is appropriate and this could easily be a session IPA. Sculpin lives up to its name and does not dissapoint.","SquidRavioli","Nov 01, 2012"

4.48,1.6,4,4.75,4.5,4,4.5,"22oz bottle shared with a friend. Pours a hazed golden-tangerine color with a white head that holds decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are juicy, tropical and citric with pineapple, mango, and mandarin with biscuity malt. Tastes are biscuity malt up front with a touch of light caramel followed quickly by pungent & piny hops balanced wonderfully with tropical mango and juicy pineapple notes. Mouth-feel is medium and fairly resinous; finishes semi-dry & bitter, but incredibly balanced with sweet and bitter. Overall, this is one of my favorite American IPAs, but I don't buy it very often because it's quite overpriced in comparison to other solid IPAs in an oversaturated IPA market.","barnzy78","Oct 29, 2012"

The head is massively rocky, leaves massive lace. But its superlative nose of mango peel, peaches, apricots is let down by a mostly voiding body, little butterscotch, very little creamy mouthfeel. More dry, seltzery, bitter. Still excellent, but it seems that Alpine Duet is more consistent with creating that butterscotch and peaches n cream/pineapple ice cream type flavor that Sculpin is just not delivering anymore. A shame.","tarheels86","Oct 02, 2012"

Sculpin lets you know she’s not your everyday IPA as soon as you wash up on the shore. She flashes her delicate pineapples and you finally wrap your tongue around her sweet mangoes for the first time. You see little difference between the celestial bodies as both the sun and her white gold complexion refresh your soul and tingle your libido. Her hops playfully nibble and bite, but never lose sight of why you came. She wants to satisfy but she doesn’t want you to leave. Each sip is a tease that both surprisingly exceeds legend and leaves you yearning for more. You want her again and again. Her siren song calls you and you only. This is why you’re lost, sailor. It’s because you want to be.","JuniperJesus","Sep 29, 2012"

I'd recommend trying this if you like fruity IPAs, if you don't like beers that finish fairly bitter I'd probably stay away though.","jaasen64","Sep 04, 2012"

I don't want to call this too hyped up, since it is very good, but man, you expect a lot from a beer like this -- something I've been hearing about for at least three years -- and it just didn't fit the bill for the expected transcendence in the end.

There is some light malty flavor, but the big taste comes from the hops. The bitterness simply grows into a hoppy crescendo. Frankly, I would consider this more like a DIPA than a straight-up IPA since the tongue tingles even after the last sip of this offering is gone.","57md","Aug 20, 2012"

Taste begins with a huge apricot blast, followed by a caramel and fresh bread middle. After that is a raw, resinous piney hop flavor that obliterates your palate. Mouthfeel is rich. Carbonation is a tiny bit high. Overall an amazing IPA. I wouldn't say this is my favorite IPA of all time, but its not hard to see why its ranked #1 IPA on BA.","tronester","Aug 19, 2012"

A slightly sweet, well hopped IPA with good malt balance. Medium bodied. A quite nice IPA, worth revisiting.","LiquidAmber","Jul 07, 2012"

3.83,-13.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pretty standard IPA here; not really sure why it's rated so extraordinarily high on BA, but oh well. Bright golden body, almost completely opaque with haze, and capped with a creamy off-white head that retained well and left nice lacing on the glass. Nose is hop-dominant as would be expected, but not too aromatic, grass, citrus, subtle traces of ammonia well within tolerance. More of the same in the taste: citrus and pine hops, quite bitter, almost to the point of being a palate wrecker, biscuity malts in the background, lasting bitter aftertaste. Medium body, a bit harsh...not quite as smooth as some of the country's better-made IPAs, but still good quality and drinkable overall if you're in the mood for the style.","Rifugium","Jun 29, 2012"

There are many, many other breweries putting out Imperial and Double IPAs on the same tier of quality, but this single IPA is extremely drinkable at 7.0% and is probably my overall favorite. It's really finely done, from start to finish, with my only real complaint being that my palate is perhaps a little to wrecked from the dryness (a ridiculous complaint given the subject). Overall this beer sets out to do exactly what it and all its peers set out to do: showcase the glory of the hop in a wildly delicious, balanced, super enjoyable pint. Get your hands on some and try it for yourself!","Sunhunters","Jun 27, 2012"

Aromas of huge grapefruit, mango, orange, pine, honey, tropical fruit, and light herbal spiciness. Fantastic aromas here with good strength and balance. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, lemon, orange zest, herbal spiciness, honey, and light biscuit. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon, pine, orange, honey, and herbal on the finish for a while. Fantastic flavor balance and smoothness. Medium carbonation and body; with a fantastic creamy, crisp, and extremely smooth mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is extremely well hidden; with almost no warming noticed on the finish.

But I decoded the freshness dating and it's a month before its best-before date, so I guess this is how it's supposed to be. I'm not an IPA guy but keep attempting to appreciate the style. If they were all like this, I wouldn't have a problem with the style, and in fact this satisfied the nascent hop craving I've started having. Maybe my palate is finally coming around. This is a tastefully restrained and classy brew. I might even like for it to get just a bit more rambunctious. I would recommend this to anyone who has been put off by the bitter beasts of the style and wants to venture out again.","BrownNut","Apr 09, 2012"

Surprising because of the aggressive head but not so much so when I feel the hop oils on my teeth. All of this leads to a smooth, extmely drinkable character with a sharp bite. This IPA was a pleasant surprise and one I will continue to buy. If you see it, get it. I put it on almost the same level as the Majaraja by Avery, which is one of my favorites and a double IPA.

4.42,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle, stamp on bottle says best by 070612. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly pine and citrusy (mango, grapefruit) hops, along with some caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like pine, citrusy (mango, grapefruit, lemon peel) and spicy hops, and some bready malt. There's a nice lingering bitter/fruity finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit slick and has good carbonation. This is a very good brew. But at $14.99 a 6-pack here in Ohio, I can get either Columbus IPA or White Rajah at a much better price. With that being said, Sculpin is definitely worth trying, I wouldn't turn one down!","bluejacket74","Mar 23, 2012"

The color is a nice golden orange color, that reminds me very much of the Sculpin fish that this is named after. The aroma is rich with many different, smells, the strong is that of citrus fruits with orange and grapefruit being some of the strongest. A very hopy taste with with a nice balance of flavors, the cirutus flavors are balanced nicely with that of the malted hops. Over all a great IPA","ProfessorX","Feb 15, 2012"

I tried another IPA from ballast point, big eye IPA it was ok but when I opened the Sculpin the aroma was awesome. Tropical fruit filled my nose and a peach , apricot, mango and citrus flavor hit my taste buds and then a nice dry bitter finish. I live in Indianapolis and I can not get this beer but I drive an hour and a half to Champaign, IL to get it. Sculpin is ten bucks for a bomber and I will not spend that much very often on a beer. I have bought 2 cases of bombers so far. It is the best IPA I have had. It is also the best beer I have had. It is a fruit hop foward beer that I could drink everyday. I tend to like all the fruit hop foward beers but many are only good to have 1 or 2 before your taste buds are over saturated, this beer is exceptional","notalagerlugger","Feb 14, 2012"

A.B.V is subtle and actually hidden by the sweetness that stays on the tounge. a great beer good balance. i enjoyed this very much, and could definatly see this stocked in my fridge.","12owls","Feb 10, 2012"

The smell is other-worldly, with citrus hop scents assaulting the senses - mango, pineapple, and orange. Huge hop flavors continue into the taste as well. Delicious grapefruit bitterness builds through a crescendo that peaks with a tangy bite in the finish. Hop oils coat the tongue, and put a smile on my face. Perfect carbonation. If you love beer with a big citrus hop taste like me, you must try this one. It's one of the best. I don't see anything that can be improved.","DeltaGolfSierra","Jan 27, 2012"

Perhaps this is a different beast when fresh, but right now it strikes me as just that -- a beast, and a bitter one at that. If you're looking for extreme bitterness in your brews, then by all means, this is sure to hit the spot. But if you seek nuance or big, bold flavor, look elsewhere.","superdedooperboy","Jan 20, 2012"

I've been looking for this beer for about 3 years and finally found it at a beer store on long island. After so long you would think the beer would be a let down but infact it lived up to the hype. An outstanding ipa! Very hoppy but not harsh. So easy to drink for the style. Another highlight is the crystal clear orange hued body which is a little different. This is some beer alright. If you havent had it yet, look for it. Hopefully it doesnt take you three years to find.","palma","Jan 04, 2012"

The only thing keeping me from giving higher ratings is the price, $10.99 for 22 ounces brings this down a lot especially when Hop Stoopid can be had for $4.99 for a 22 ounce and Double Jack for $7.99 for 22 ounces. I won't buy this again due to the price.","keanex","Jan 04, 2012"

The taste was balanced up front with some nice malty flavors and finished off with a refreshingly bitter flavor that lingers on the toungue. The body was appropriate to the style. It wasn't a hopbomb like I expected like most highly sought after IPAs are, but this was overall just a very well done beer. Nothing is overdone or overly assertive; it's just an above average IPA and an almost perfect example of the style.","jonvan04","Jan 02, 2012"

4.15,-5.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a really nice looking hazy orange honey type of color. It has about an inch of eggshell colored head, which fades into a small layer of foam that lasts throughout the whole glass. It leaves some nice rings of lace throughout. The nose on this one is citrus forward. I'm getting peach, orange peel, grapefruit, and lemon. Really nice. Taste is also dominated by citrus. I'm getting pineapple, peach, orange peel, and lemon. There's a sharp hoppy bitterness on the back end, paired with a malty sweetness. Really well balanced. Mouthfeel is good, its thin and easy drinking with a nice effervescencee to it. Overall, Sculpin is one of the better selections, one of my favorite IPA's, definitely one I will grab whenever its around.","BrewtifulMind","Nov 13, 2011"
3.67,-16.8,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"O: Decent. A good one but doesn't stand out to me and for the price ($9), I'd much rather have a blind pig or a hop stoopid.","sfprint","Nov 08, 2011"
4.33,-1.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from a bomber into a weizen glass. Beautiful looking golden cloudy pour with a 2 finger off white pillow head. Great lacing throughout and good retention. Smell was of citrus and apricots. A note of grapefruit on the end. Not an overpowering smell, but adequate. Taste followed the nose with was a good fit of citrus malts and adequate hops. Very much on the fruit end which was a surprise. Complex but not too tart. Hides the 7%ABV very well. Feel is full with a lot of carbonation. Not watery at all. Overall- A very solid IPA which is not really my style. Enjoyed the fruit tones with a good amount of hoppiness. Reminded me of citrus bubblegum which is a compliment to it's full flavor. Notes of cloves added to the complexity. A great sipper that I will be having several more of in the future. Very tasty-","TheDinger","Nov 06, 2011"

Scents of some kind of a peachy, grapefruit hit the nose. Possible warrior hops? Exploding creamy malt fired back by a buckling generosity of mean, kick assed hops. Very bitter, but the bitterness fades back as the malt catches up. Extremely refreshing. Super beer for year round consumption. Website says 70 IBU but I say this tastes to me as if it is in the 90's. If you are a hophead or an IPA fanatic, this is one for you!

3.92,-11.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Very refreshing and easy to drink. The hops are definitely here, just not intense. The nice balanced malt finishes this ale off, making for a very nice drink, definitely a session ale. The 7% ABV is not noticeable at all. OK this is not a “killer” IPA, but it is a very balanced and easy to drink ale. Definitely worth a test drive.","JTSbeerislife","Oct 02, 2011"
4.73,7.3,4.75,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.75,"Pale gold in color. Moderate carbonation leaves a decent head that settles to a ring of lace. Thick lacing remains.

Overall a great dry IPA. Up there with Lagunitas and Stone IPAs.","ILiveOffHops","Oct 01, 2011"
4.22,-4.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"This is definitely a beer worth trying. It's got deliciously ripe citrus in its nose and a puckering bitterness in its aftertaste.

Very tasty and I may pursue this in future trades!","ThePorterSorter","Sep 30, 2011"

This is the most favored American IPA on BA, but I have definitely enjoyed Stone, Smutty, and 90 minute more than this.","CheezyBlaster","Sep 24, 2011"
5,13.4,5,5,5,5,5,"This pours cloudy golden with nice head and juice resin lacing. The smell is floral and mildly fruity. The flavor starts with a crisp bite but turns smooth with a subtle amount of fruit and punch-in-the-face hops. The flavor works through bitterness but it does not take over. I can taste some pleasant grassiness…but not overpowering. The whole feel is pretty much here and gone, but I would not classify it as “rounded” because of the lack of sweet malt. I love this west coast style, and would easily put this beer in my top ten. If you are looking for a rounded IPA with malt and hops at war, this is not it. If you are looking for awesome hop bomb that is easy to drink, this is a must try. Delicious.","beerdown77","Sep 24, 2011"

It reminded me a little bit of a Firestone Union Jack that meets a Bells Two Hearted. It got a great fruity taste and the perfect amount of hop bitterness.

4.2,-4.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer pours a super clear gold color with a high frothy white head that stuck around for awhile. Lacing is clumpy and random. Aroma is fairly piney and citrus-like but not as pungent as i would have liked. While the taste is very good i think i expected more of the fruity and tropical flavors that we all love. Lacking was the super fresh and juicy hop character i was hoping for. Feel is moderate to light making it quite drinkable. Slightly sticky with nice carbonation. Nice pale malt flavor is there but not dominating which is how i like it. I expected more out of the hop character but I will see if the next bottle I can get is fresher!","kbnooshay","Sep 12, 2011"

Flavors of grapefruit, mangos, pine resin, tea-leaf tannins and fresh grassy hops intermingle in a perfect balance. Although complex, each pull provides an easy quaff and a light-round mouthfeel.

This one brought Avery’s IPA to mind, just a little more balanced and a bit lighter on the palate. This is refreshing for the style with plenty of grapefruit and juicier citrus flavor.

4.24,-3.9,4,5,4,4,4,"O: I still really like this beer, just not as much on draft mainly due to the grassy, planty flavors (as well as the hefty price tag of $10.50 for 20oz). Still it's a great beer and I'll go back to it plenty of times.","argock","Aug 06, 2011"
4.75,7.7,4.5,4.5,5,5,4.5,"Bronze in color with a thick, sticky, lasting head. Lot's of sticky lacing. This is what IPA's are supposed to look like. From the moment I pop the cap mango feels my olefactory senses. Other citrus fruits are noticable as well as sugar cane. Flavor follows the aroma with a huge hop bill that doesn't tear your mouth apart. Sculpin has perfected the balance. Again mango is what I notice first with other citrus fruits. Grapefruit, lemon and a touch of sweetness for balance. It appears they only used pale malts in this one. Thank goodness as that let's the hops shine. Mouthfeel is medium and both sharp and oily. Great beer by Ballast Point and I was lucky to find it while vacationing in Myrtle Beach.","wcudwight","Aug 05, 2011"

3.7,-16.1,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Ok, to start this off, it poured a nice clean goldenrod with a thick frothy 2 finger head that is coating ever bit of glass it touches. this is a very clear beer completely transparent with lots of lively bubbles partially in thanks to the laser etching in the glass. the smell is a little pungent with a slight grapefruit/citrus with some banana and bready notes. the malts stand out at the end of the nose with a certain sweetness i dont mind. I get more citrus than grapefruit in the taste but you definitely get the bready taste more the end of the sip than the beginning with a solid pronounced malt backbone the whole sip. This has some lively carbonation that i enjoyed, lots of tingling from start to almost finish, with a slightly dry finish that makes you want another sip. overall this beer never really amazes me especially with it sitting at the top of the ipa list, dont get me wrong this is a good beer and has lots of balance to it but i dont think i get the freshest bottles because its no in distro in my area. so one day i may change my mind but this beer is worth getting at least once to try.","kaips1","Jul 29, 2011"

Soon all were pulling record “catches” and consuming huge game accordingly. What they did not know that the time was that the evolution of the punnet square had out evolved even gregor mendel himself. Put simply, this breed of fish had learned to feed on wild hop beds in the beds of nearly any algae, and offer itself up to sacrifice. The intense neurotoxins within the hypothalamus of the fish made the consumer feel as though they had done something exceptional.

I can't tell you how much I enjoy the nose of Sculpin. The taste follows the nose. Plenty of tropical flavors that consist of pineapple,orange,tangerine and some mango. It is bitter on the finish but has that slight biscuit quality to take out some of the bitterness. I wish there was a way they could put this nitro in a bottle because the creaminess that comes from nitro has to be experienced to believe. Nitro adds a whole new level of mouthfeel to what I already think is a amazing beer and my top ipa. Overall I love this beer and hope to have it again. I wish the nitro version was a little fresher which would be my only complaint and therefore I enjoyed the regular version better.

Sculpin pours out as a pleasing golden color with a nice soapy looking white head. The head settles and leave a white bubbly film over the beer that leaves a pretty damn good lacing down the glass. The smell of this beer is very inviting. It's got hops in there along with Grapefruit, lemon, orange, and a faint aroma of peach. The taste is very good as well it's gives off a really nice sweetness upfront followed but a cotton mouth bitter dryness in the back end. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation to it. Overall it's a very pleasing IPA, once of the best that isn't an Imperial in my opinion. The more you have the better they get.

Not quite as aromatic as the bottled version. Taste does not suffer. Lip-smacking citrusy hops and a perfectly-balanced body hold this brew down. Taste is smooth and bitter. A rare treat on tap or in any version. Fantastic brew that everyone must have.","saintwarrick","May 30, 2011"
4.14,-6.1,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Average pour gets it foaming up close to half the pint glass, settles for a bit in the three finger range and then down from there, slightly off white, hard to imagine more whipped up froth and airiness, very good retention as well as gluey stickiness to the thick lacing streaks. Deep golden hue to the liquid, slightly metallic looking, consistent throughout, curiously for all the foam virtually no visible bubbles. Sour, zesty orange and grapefruit citrus sets the tone early in the nose, pepper and salt, fresh green grass, pine cone, pressed rose petals, wild yeasts, way in the back row you may find a few chocolate and coffee notes. Full-bodied, here the huge foaminess brings a creamy texture to balance against the bitter invasiveness of the hops. Grains, grasses, snap peas, pepper, coarse country breads, pine, coal tar, no doubt your tongue tingles and feels alive. The sour grapefruit, orange citrus leaves some room for the apricot, peach fruit to vaguely soften things. As in the nose, the cocoa, malt and coffee accents are super-subtle, more present at warmer temps. Given its high energy level is not over the top and pretty close to true stylistic form. Hard not to feel refreshed after a few sips, doesn’t need to be mixed with Red Bull.","farrago","May 28, 2011"

The nose is excellent, lots of piney hoppiness coming through, very fresh smelling. The taste is more of the same, but with a deeper level from the malts that balances the hop flavors quite well, almost giving it a woody character. There's also a bit of citrus flavor at the end.

There's a bit of malt sweetness, but hard to be more specific while enduring the hop assault. Taste is also a big hop blend, with some apricot and peach fruitiness, finished with a sharp hop finish. The malt comes through in the slightly sweet mouthfeel, but not much in the taste. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium-bodied, and somewhat fizzy.

If it were available in reasonably priced 6 packs, it would be a near perfect beer for a barbeque on a hot day, except maybe a little high ABV; it's not overpowering, the body is light, but it still has good interesting flavor.

That isn't necessarily a bad thing though. This could really hit the spot when there's a hop craving, but for the most part I'd rather have at least some malt quality.

In the background is a clean, pilsnery malt that proves the perfect vehicle to carry the hops, which are the stars of the parade, with just a little whiff of breadiness and light caramel.

The colors are brighter than the Big Eye IPA that Ballast produces. The beer was slightly hazy, but more orange-toned to the amber coloring. The beer had no head to speak of. Heavy aromas of cedar and citrus hit the nose, with a very strong, hoppy background. Grapefruit sweet and tart on the tongue, with mild, peppery, green hops to balance.

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, citrus, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, citrus, pine hop, citrus hop, and subtle grapefruit. It had a medium feel (almost resiny) on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew as I'm sure you are all well aware. I had this awhile back in the bottle and it was quite heavenly. If I'm honest I MUCH preferred it out of the bottle as compared to the tap. It still had a nice flavor but it just wasn't as balanced. The pine aspect really overpowered in the tap version. It improved slightly upon warming up a bit but still lacked that heavenly aspect. Still a definite must try!","thagr81us","Apr 05, 2011"

Mango, grapefruit, floral hops, bit of apricot and more awesome tropical fruit. Light, crisp and extremely well integrated hop flavors. Mango up front along with a hint of apricot and yes, peach, as advertised. The sweeter hops give way to grapefruit and lemon flavors in the middle portion of the beer. A bit of semi-bitter pine resin and floral hops follow before some of the tropical sweetness from the beginning of the beer comes full circle on the close.

This leaps from the glass with a mélange of bright juicy sweet tropical fruit notes, yellow grapefruit, guava, canned fruit salad in syrup, cherries, pears, peaches. Perfectly balanced on the palate, this attacks with boldly bitter hops, a cashmere-like mouthfeel and a nice balanced lightness that makes this immenently drinkable.

Taste starts out with the same fruity taste as the aroma, almost entirely hops with a touch of malt. While the flavor is great, the finish is bitter and the hop flavors feel sour towards the end. Too much hop bitterness without enough malt/yeast sweetness to balance it out, while the beer is good, this is disappointing. Mouthfeel starts out smooth with medium-strong carbonation, ends more sour/bitter. Still quite drinkable, but the hop bitterness becomes overwhelming as I finish the beer.","Zodijackyl","Mar 08, 2011"

4.63,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"IPA's are not supposed to get much better than this: fresh Sculpin served on draft at the perfect temperature in a big Duvel tulip. The beer is extremely hazy, it's as if I can see hop oils swirling around in the chill haze. The soft orange glow of the beer is highlighted with a fluffy white cap of foam that carries the aroma with it. There's really no other way to describe the beer other than tropical--it smells like fresh cut mangos, papaya, and tangerines covered in orange blossom honey. There is a little pine aroma but the fruit dominates the nose. The taste is a lot the same, juicy fruit, sticky pine grounded by sweet lightly toasted malt that provides a nice roundness of flavor and mouthfeel. The bitterness really comes in at the end but there is enough residual sweetness and mango flavor for good balance. The carbonation is spot on with just enough prickliness to dance on you tongue without drowning out the hops. It's hard to imagine a better IPA but perhaps I would like one that's a little earthier with more herbal woody hop flavors and less papaya (a fruit that tastes like meat to me). Otherwise this is an excellent beer and a great experience on draft","Soonami","Feb 17, 2011"

I have even seen 6-packs these days. Maybe because I have had some not so good Sculpin experiences at local establishments as well or that there are so many competetive hoppy beers in SD these days.

4.73,7.3,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Poured a beautiful clementine orange, brilliantly clear, with a 1.5" white, dense head that left large chunks and bands of lace on the Gulden Draak tulip. Very good retention. The nose is a bit lacking in intensity. Quite muted, but the aromas are discernible: a fresh blend of grapefruit rind, grass, mango, and peach. Oh my this is delightful. I only wish it was more pronounced. However, there is no shortage of flavor! A nice, juicy, citrusy start with sweet honey that immediately gives way to the fruit basket of pomelo, tangerines, hint of pears, and peaches. There is a low lying bitterness throughout the experience that presents more prominently in the finish along with a touch of spruce and pine resin. There's a bit of lightly caramelized sugar too, that, along with honey, carries the malt to the finish. A very smooth and unfizzy carbonation makes for a velvety texture for this medium bodied beer. All of this forms a monolith of excellence in the quest for a great IPA. This is one of the best I've ever tasted. I will note, too, that by the time I've reached this point in the review, the beer has warmed a bit and the aromas are now MUCH more pronounced than before, which begs to raise the smell rating from a 3.5 to a 4.0. Truly an exceptional beer that I am grateful to have sampled for the second time and hopefully for many more times to come.

It poured a rich and beautiful gold in color with a two finger, whispy off white head that laced the glass. The aromas are very wet, bitter, and full of pine. It features very citrusy and sweet hops. There is so much going on here for an IPA! I love the variation. The taste of is of pine and honey. I'd say that this is somwhere in between Hopslam and 90 Minute. It's excellent and a must try.

Thats high to me for a 7% ABV but its worth it. You can easily drink a 22oz of this and move onto something else(unless you had another bomber which I'd be tempted to open) Really was the best IPA I've had, can't imagine drinking a better one.","tigernipples","Jan 27, 2011"

The hop characteristics aren't too strong, perhaps this is due to it not being as fresh as it could be. There is a caramel note and some mild spices in the background that I solely attribute to the grain bill of this particular beer. Not a bad IPA for the dollar.","Vdubb86","Jan 22, 2011"

Some nice lacing after 10 minutes as the head disapated to about 1/8 inch. The smell was as expected from the track record of this brew - a nice grapefruity aroma that I have seldom experienced. The taste was very well balanced...smooth and full of grapefruit and citrus notes. I tasted this one side by side with another highly rated IPA and the Sculpin was more balanced and did not have as much bite/ bitterness as the other. This is one great IPA. I could drink several of these . An exceptional brew!","turfy","Jan 22, 2011"

The hops have a nice bit of fresh grapefruit flavor that tastes as fresh as anything I've had. Very smooth and drinkable for a 7%er, and while the beer is nicely bitter, it is definitely not too harsh to keep going back for more. Will seek out again.","dgfair","Jan 21, 2011"

4.13,-6.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Sculpin, huh? One of those sought-after gems on BA here. Hey, it's good, yeah. Not unique. Just real orange on the spectrum of looks and, in a skewed way, flavor. A lot of citrus/tropical elements to the brew. First off, it sports a lovely smooth, Orange-Julius-foamy head that holds tight and lasts awhile atop the misty-dank sunny-orange corpus cervezus - very attractive on a seaside holiday frozen-cocktail tip. Brightly-pulsating waves of melon/custard/pineapple/coconut/ project feet from the glass - quite enticing, yet almost pedestrian. From here, I lose sense of the whole "IPA" tag and tune in to a citrus-zest-fest-injection. Not screaming beer/ale with the sip... Fruity, smooth, and thick. Refreshing, but leaving some citric-slick smear behind. Nectary to an extent. Complex collage of tropic fruit dominates, surfing a wave of bold, creamy, dextriny malt - apropos considering this mix or balance of the hops - couldn't imagine this with a snappy, dry feel... It's good - not representative(?) of the (moderate) degree of hype I've been attuned to. Happy to have met with it this one time.","Bouleboubier","Jan 15, 2011"

One inch of frothy foam slowly dissipates leaving good lacing. Little carbonation. Beautiful nose! Mango, pineapple, and fresh, piny hops. A hint of rich malt sweetness can be detected under it all. Medium-light bodied but also flat. Not syrupy at all though. Goes down smooth without destroying the palate. Bight and playful hops have only light resiny character. Citrus, orange blossom, and pine on the palate with almost no trace of malty heaviness. Just the way I like it! This is probably the best non imperial IPA I have ever had.

Orange peel dominates followed by a slight hint of biscuity malt. Taste follows the nose. An explosion of orange, tangerine, and mango hits my pallet at first quaff. This is the juiciest IPA I've ever had! The hop bill sports seven different varieties yet the beer is perfectly balanced with a easing bitterness and subtle malt backbone. Finish is juicy, bitter and sweet all at the same time. Feel is medium bodied and carbonation is spot on. Drinkability is dangerously high due to the delicious taste and completely hidden ABV.

Smelled of grapefruit peel, lime, apple, and menthol. The taste was very nicely balanced; apple, grapefruit, menthol, and a slight grassy character dissolving to a bitter peel finish with slight dryness, and a good lingering but not overpowering bitter aftertaste. Very modestly carbonated and smooth, with the head retention aiding a slightly creamy feel.

With no freshness date on the bottle, I can't conclude that it's merely a freshness issue. In fact, I've had experiences at bars with fresh kegs that I still haven't been impressed with. So I am choosing to drop drinkability from a 5 to a 4. Sometimes this beer is so great it's nearly a religious experience, but equally often this beer disappoints me, and shows itself to be anything but exceptional.

These bottles didn't disappoint with the freshest, hoppiest tasting iteration I've ever had of this not on tap.

Pours a bright pale/light orange color with nice head and foever lacing. Smells wonderful---fresh hops, pine, fruit, etc. Taste follows suit with a creamy bitterness and dry finish. Very different than BP's Big Eye IPA which is much more malt dominated. The malt in Sculpin seems very minimal or light. Easily one of the best IPA's I've had the pleasure of drinking.

4.37,-0.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"M + D: This went beyond my expectations, and I'm very pleased to have local access to such a stellar IPA. Medium bodied, with a carbonation that's pretty much spot-on... sparkling, and giving way to just a little chewiness at the very end. The higher-than-average alcohol content is masked remarkably well and can go down perhaps a little too easily. A nice brew, and I look forward to having more regular access to it on the East Coast.

It has a great warm hop aroma, full of citrus and spruce. The taste has some sweet malts and lots of hops. I can pick out a distinct grapefruit citrus flavor. The bitterness is tingly and impressive.

The aroma pops with citrus first, then comes faint spice as well as the smell of fresh flowers. Alright, time to take a sip...the taste contains grapefruit, hops of course. The hop content seems to be just the right amount for an IPA in my opinion. And it finishes dry, but not overly so. Carbonation level is good as well.

The aroma is full of tropical fruit. The label claims apricot, peach, mango, and lemon. I definately pick out the mango but the other hop aromas meld together in a fruity punch. The flavor is 95% hops. More tropical fruit flavor with just a hint of dryness in the finish. Bitterness is moderate which surprised me a little thinking this was going to be a palate shredder after taking a whiff. The body is a little light but is pleasantly carbonated.

Smell is exceptionally fruity with mango, apricot, tangerine and pineapple all intermingling with each other with pine undertones throughout. Taste is initially perfectly balanced with hops, bitterness fruitiness and sweetness, but just a smidge, and I mean a smidge too bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth up front with a prickliness at the back. The only hit this one had for me was its very very slightly too bitter finish but it was much closer to a 5 than a 4.5.

4.42,0.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured into a fluted tulip, it's quick to generate a fluffy head of sticky foam. Instant resiny aroma packed with floral/herbal hops and tropical fruit. Color is a light high-clarity orange with tiny rising bubbles. Lacing forms in sudsy sheets, and sticks around for awhile. Concentrated citrusy hop flavors of pink grapefruit and bitter orange pith. Residual leafiness and a juicy mango aftertaste. Pale malt is relegated to the back of the bus, but provides a slight tip to the balance scale. Moderate and creamy carbonation with the obligatory hop bite to it. Slightly dry in the end with a fairly long finish.","Anthony1","Aug 10, 2010"

The citrus hop aromas hit my nose the second I opened the cap. Tons of sweetness and citrus with a nice piney edge as well. Smell is reminiscent of Pliny the Elder. Taste however differs (which is expected considering Pliny is a DIPA). The taste is still DAMN good though. Initially I get some nice hop bitterness, immediately followed followed by some fresh pine with grapefruit, mango, and orange flavors. It end with a very crisp bitterness. The mouthfeel is very dry and crisp. Very "west-coastish"...a great example if you ask me. The drinkability is quite high. Could probably drink 3 bombers of this stuff.","DovaliHops","Aug 06, 2010"

Full of tangerine, grapefruit, pine and resiny, fresh wet hops with a touch of peaches. The balance of this beer is absolutely perfect. Great bitter hop bite, but a nice sweet, malty backbone to make this probably the most drinkable beer I've ever had. The mouthfeel is great, crisp and dry and just a tad resiny and chewy at the same time. I've had this beer once before when I was in San Diego on business, and it blew me away then.

There's some citrus in there, but not enough to overpower like a west coast hopbomb is known to do. Big bold hoppy bitterness creeps in from the back and actually takes me by surprise about halfway through the pint. Thick mouthfeel for an IPA, and lower carbonation.

The hops, though, remain rather powerful throughout. The body is a light medium, with moderate carbonation and a very smooth feel.

The flavor is also nice, but a bit of a letdown from the appearance/aroma...notes of citrus and piney hops initially, a little mint, biscuit, herbs, caramel, orange marmalade, alcohol and a slight hint of funk.

Don't know why, and IPAs are my favorite, I'm always reminded of cat urine when I smell them (but, oddly enough, not in a bad way). Maybe too much time with my head over the litter box. Probably says too much about myself already. Piney and bitter up front. Smooth. Cask makes anything better. A tad of sweetness in the middle and on the back end. Smooth as silk.

4.42,0.2,4.5,5,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured into my Duvel tulip, Sculpin is a lovely light orange color. A good sized (~ 2 finger) creamy white head forms and leaves behind plenty of lace (though a little more would have garnered a 5). Sculpin smells incredible, a mega blast of peaches and juicy grapefruits. The first sips then are a little bit of a disappointment, as there's a little bit of an unwelcome bitter undertone to the citrusy flavors, that when combined with the clean hop bitterness is just too much.This issue fades as the beer warms though, so a bump up to a 4 is warranted. The medium carbonation is very fine, to the beer's credit, and the body is, for a beer with no appreciable malt presence, surprisingly full. Sculpin was a bit of a mini roller coaster ride for me, thrilled with the appearance and nose and initially underwhelmed with the taste, only to have the beer recover beautifully. As one would hope, there's no heat at all from this 7% ABV beer, a fantastic example of a hop forward IPA","axeman9182","May 28, 2010"

4.83,9.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Medium bodied but on the lighter end with a slightly chewy hop forward presence that lingers over the subtle malt backbone into a sweet yet dry finish. Again, the flavor of this beer is dominated by insanely fresh delicious hops that give off a slight dry bitterness and a huge tropical/citrus fruit notes. Lots of mango, pineapple, orange and lemon peel and grapefruit. There's also a slightly lactic creaminess that adds to the beer's complexity and makes it incredibly smooth and quaffable. The malt backbone is subtle and slightly toasty with hints of caramel, biscuit and graham cracker. Perfectly balanced with sweet fruit, dry bitter hop and subtle malt flavors bouncing off of each other. I can't say enough about this beer.

Poured a light golden amber with an ample two-finger head which dissapted into a white covering fairly quickly. Lacing was on the lighter side but lasted. Nose is a wonderful collection of orange and mango, some pine and floral hops. Taste starts with a some sweetness and citrus and then quickly folds into a pleasantly dry and mildly bitterness. There is some alcohol warming at the end as well. Feel is medium to light and oily. This is a very refreshing beer you must try - IF it's fresh.

I actually have remarkably little to say about Sculpin, considering how highly it has been rated. It's a very drinkable, mild IPA, beyond that I don't see how this ended up where it is.

Awesome representation of a sweet looking fish on the label. Bomber pour into a pint glass and I am met with a yellow gold hazy brew with a nice big white foamy head. The aroma is amazing. Peaches, pears, grapefruit and lemon zest aroma. Taste is kick ass. Not as much grapefruit as I thought which was nice. Hoppy, bitter on the initial sip and tangy bite on the swallow followed by the drying of the buds until the next sip.

This beer is light bodied. I feel like a lot of breweries will have a huge hop bomb backed by some malt, but not this one (those beers are also usually 9% and up, this is under 8%, this note is probably referring to the fact that I drink more DIPAs than IPAs). The taste is pretty good. This seems similar with it intentions as beers like Hop Juice: all about the hops, not the malt. The flavor leans more towards the citrus notes than anything, leaving a slight grapefruit taste in your mouth. The pine notes are there to balance it out, but not too much. This beer is has a bunch of flavor is not in your face. There's no direct attack from the hops, but they don't go unnoticed. Start to finish your getting a bouqet of flavors. I think as the beer warms up a tad some sweet flavors some out. Notes of grapefruit are really starting to show. I think for me to really enjoy that I'd like more malt, but it's a minor complaint.","100floods","Mar 08, 2010"

Appears a pale copper hue with a bubbling bright white head, forms intricate fine lacing down the sides of my glass as it dwindles. Aromatics have a full blown hop garden going on with bountiful citrusy graperfruit and tropical fruit tones, raw floral and herbal qualities as well, with some mild sweetness making it's way from the pale malts. Flavor was brazenly bitter full on assault of bitter orange peel pith, floral herbal hops, and again tropical fruit juiciness. Pale malts gave enough bread and biscuit components just to balance out the huge hop profile. Killer experience I can't wait to try more from these guys, mouthfeel was oily resinous medium bodied ale. Soft mellow carbonation made this one lubricatingly smooth experience, drinkable as all hell. I'm 100% sold and I'm glad I found this brew that I have been trying to track down for over 5 yrs now, a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh beer scene.","WVbeergeek","Mar 06, 2010"

Aromas are pleasantly hops with lot of fruits including apricots, lemons and grapefruit. Quaff is dominated with hops. Also some of the same citrus fruits from the aroma and also pine flavors. No alcohol is noted in the quaff but wow the hops in this are amazing. A hop heads dream come true. Mouthfeel is crispy and full bodied. Drinkability is unbelievable...

Wow, the aroma of this beer is insane. Citrus, pineapple and other tropical fruits. I am also getting some peach and other crazy fruity smells. I am detecting sweetness as well, but it really could just be from the amazing fruity hop bouquet. They need to make air fresheners that smell like this. The taste is like a hop punch to the tongue. I have heard beers described as tongue bruisers, and this one is a prime example. Hops, hops, hops. Pineapple, peach, citrus, pine... it is pretty amazing how intense the hop flavor is. Adding to this is a pretty high amount of bitterness. The bready malt is there, but really does not add much to the beer. It is basically just playing the role of a wingman to the hop goodness. My critical side keeps telling me that it is way unbalanced, but my hop loving side could care less. The more I drink this the more I like it. I would say this beer is fairly light bodied for the style, and the mouthfeel is not necessarily the best. A little bit too sticky dry from all the hops. Quite drinkable, but I find this beer is better to savor and enjoy the great aroma.","zoso1967","Feb 12, 2010"

The smell is great, citrus notes stand out of grapefruit, but probably more on the tangerine side, piney, spicey herbs also come through, very nice. The taste is also very citrus-y with a complex hoppy bitterness taste, some caramel sweetness in the finish, with a lingering hop finish. Not a heavy IPA, easy drinking, well rounded, what I look for a great IPA, not too malty, just enough malt to keep the hops balanced, love the citrus in this one. Hardly can detect the alcohol.

There was a ton of citrus and pine from the hops as well as a slight hint of other fruits such as pineapple. The taste is very clean and well-balanced which is perfect for an IPA. The citrus and pine hop notes were incredible and the malt and sweetness balanced out the bitterness. There is a lot going on with all the different tastes but it all works together beautifully. The mouthfeel was creamy and silky with a slight tang from the hops. Not too much bitterness. The drinkability is high on this one for all the right reasons.

Smell is heavenly: so much citrus and even moderate pine notes. Big juicy ripe pink grapefruit, pineapple slices, vanilla cake batter and tangerine wedges. Very similar in the taste with a sharp pineapple cake flavor, fresh citrus salad (sweet lemon, mandarin oranges and pink grapefruit). Pine in the background, amazing mouthfeel, unlike any mouthfeel I've every experienced before in this style. Bubbles are ample but not sharp, silky and sudsy coating everything. Very refreshing and extremely drinkable, I will be a happy camper when I move to the San Diego area this year.","natelocc787","Jan 08, 2010"

Overall this is definitely one of the best IPAs out there. Delicious tropical hops flavors that few other beers can match. There was an herbal hops character in the aftertaste that was reminiscent of Ruination, which I wasn't a huge fan of, and I thought it could have used a hint more body.

Nice floral hop aroma with tropical fruit. Smells as if somebody just squeezed some hop juice in this sucker. Big fresh hop flavor with a blend of grapefruit and orange, floral, a touch of asprin in the end. Very nice hop flavor profile without any of the over the top bitterness or sweet malt. Moderate body with enough carbonation to help offset the hop flavor, thus more drinkable. Finishes only slightly bitter, which is surprising with the amount of hop flavor.

The smell is quite intense for the size of the beer. The flavor is dry and hoppy. I particularly like a good dry IPA. The hops are different, but it reminds me of Pliny the Elder in that respect. I was inspired to try them side by side and they're quite similar beers, both magnificent. Sculpin is clean and strong. The mouthfeel is quite dry with lots of pleasant bitterness and no alcohol.

Nice thick head that has some fight in it, lacing is moderate, carbonation fueled the head immediately and is not visible in the body. Smell is phenomenal: lemon, mango, orange, apricot. This has got to be the best smelling beer I've come across. The taste follows the nose quite strictly. The hop explosion it produces is amazing. I could use a little bit more of the fruit from the nose but then again that might cause an imbalance so this is a tough call. It's an extremely well balanced beer, a little on the hoppier side of the IPA style. The mouthfeel is nice and full (for an IPA), with a dry finish that leaves you salivating and thirsty for more. This beer has exceeded my expectations of what an IPA can be. Ballast Point wins with this one.","atremains","Sep 19, 2009"
5,13.4,5,5,5,5,5,"The elusive Sculpin has been caught. I would have saved this for #100 but it's an IPA and I wanted to drink it as fresh as possible. Grabbed this one at Table and Vine in W. Springfield today, they had 3 cases, I snagged the last two on the shelf (maybe more in the back). Pours a very golden color with a hint of orange, has a very bubbly two finger head that retains very well for an IPA, the carbonation on the pour is extreme, pour it carefully. Thick lacing is left on my pint glass as I drink this bad boy. Smell here is probably the best beer smell I have ever put my hands on. So much great things going on, a huge fruity aspect to the beer (mangos, peach, apricot, lemon), the sweeter fruits perfectly balanced by floral and piney hops, greatness. Taste is a bit different than the smell, less of a fruit characteristic but still enough to be very noticeable, a huge aggressive hop blast comes onto the tongue but backs off as you swallow to allow a very good sweet fruity taste to come through with an eventual delicious hop after taste. A very complex smelling and tasting beer. Mouthfeel is very well carbonated, medium bodied and a bit oily, maybe a TINY bit of alcohol warming but no alcohol taste = a very well balanced mouthfeel, I hate to give all 5s but its starting to look that way. Drinkability is great, the taste is enough for me to drink this all day long, its not filling, the price ($10) was worth it any day of the week, no bad flavors to ruin this one over time, and I would buy this one again over and over and over.","cbutova","Sep 19, 2009"

By the time I finish my second of two bombers of Sculpin my mind may be changed. Sculpin is much less floral than Two Hearted, but much more pronounced in fruit characteristics. Also, if you've read my Two Hearted review then you know that I love Two Hearted so much partly because of its odd artwork. I have lovingly nicknamed it "Fish Beer." Well, Sculpin is named after a fish and features the sculpin fish on its label. So this is also "Fish Beer." Maybe this will end up tying Two Hearted as my favorite beer. That I spent a paragraph comparing Ballast Point Sculpin to my favorite beer -- asserting that it might be my new favorite -- is proof enough for me that this beer is brilliant and rightfully deserving of its accolades.","Reaper16","Sep 12, 2009"

I'm picking up a hint of sweet pale malt lingering in background. Taste almost of good as it smells. Again lots of citrus flavors oranges, lemon, and I'm thinking a touch of pineapple as well.

Seven or eight different hops varieties, depending on the batch, four kinds of malt and a Cali yeast strain combine to create the Tropical IPA flavor that trips my trigger each and every time. Coarse filtration to remove the dry-hopping solids resulted in a deep golden-yellow color with NE-quality clarity. BTW, Cuz Colby was forthcoming with some info and asked that his assistance be recognized. Mouthfeel was medium with a uniquely tart/fruity flavor that reminded me of popping an entire roll of Tropical Friut Life Savers (papaya, mango, apricot, peach) in my mouth.

4.49,1.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a very pale straw color - nice and clear. Kind of a light orange. With a vigorous pour, you get quite a head, a less vigorous pour will yield a nice dense little pad of carbonation. It leaves just a bit of lacing, and has decent retention. A little lighter than I'd expect, but very nice looking. Upfront, the nose is very leafy and grassy. Just like fresh hops. But then you start to smell some grapefruit, some peach and mango, a little lemon, then just pure powdery, polleny resins. A brilliant hop profile. If you can smell any malt, it's light and powdery. The taste follows suit pretty well. Comes up with some sticky, resinous hops at first. You move from grassy and floral, kind of herbal, actually very herbal for a moment, then to a bit of citrus, then really leafy and resinous in the finish. Nice hop profile. The malt is a little sticky, but overall, this is a very dry beer. There isn't much breadiness, but there is a slight crackery taste. The malt profile is a bit tough to judge when this one is fresh, but I kind of like it like that. Very nice body. About medium, with the perfect level of dryness. Not quite puckering, but definitely no sweetness to block out the hops. Pretty good. A bit thinner than a really great IPA though, and it's a little sticky feeling. It actually was kind of slow starting, I just wanted to relax and savor every little sip, and I really did. I loved it. Overall, one of the best IPAs out there. It almost borders on DIPA, but its still a bit different. A great beer, and if you can find it, but it immediately.","taylorhamrick","Jul 22, 2009"

Reminds me in terms of quality of the pint of Town Hall Masala Mama I had last week. The hops jump out of the glass once the beer is poured - I love when that happens. The hops are a mix of spicy citrus that are juicy, but dry and drinkable. There are also tasty notes of apricot, white grape, and orange peel.The aftertaste just doesn't go away.

4.72,7,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a rather pale orange color, with a huge two finger, white head. Just some stray carbonation in the brew; excellent clarity. Heads sticks around a while, and leaves a little lacing. Great work on the aroma hop additions, as this may be one of the most delicious smelling IPAs. There must be some combination of Cascade, Amarillo, Simcoe and the like, as it is an excellent citrus hop aroma (my personal favorite). There is a mix of sweet mango and tart grapefruit, I just love it. Taste is not as pronounced as the aroma, but is certainly an excellent IPA. A slightly more earthy hop flavor is in the taste, but still retains the citrus characteristics I love. Near perfectly balanced, as the hop flavor is there, prominent, without being overwhelming. Light and crisp in your mouth, and just a little hop slickness left in your mouth after a sip. The balanced hop profile makes this quite an easy sipper, no rough edges at all. I love some "hop bombs," and this IPA certainly has hops, but you have to appreciate the balance coming from a beer with this amount of hop aroma and flavor.","bhalter8","Jul 21, 2009"

Cookie-ish malt follows, but soon gets overshadowed by big grapefruit, orange, and pineapple hop flavor. Nicely acidic, and tongue-numbingly bitter. Some fruity malt gets lost in the hops; I would definitely not call this balanced! More citrus into the finish with a strong herbal, resinous aftertaste. Delicious. Medium-bodied, with a slightly lively feel. Dry finish. An excellent very hop-forward citrus bomb!","alexgash","Jul 17, 2009"

Pine, peach, apricot, and mango are just HUGE in the nose. The flavor has the same gigantic juicey hops but a relatively low bitterness that perfectly balances the bone dry malt. Speaking of malt flavor, you'd struggle to pick out much if anything through the hop juice. Medium, almost light bodied with medium carbonation. This is really a hop paradise on tap. I had a bottle a couple days after sampling it on tap, and while excellent, it didn't quite live up to sucking this nectar right out of the brewery's tap.

Bright pine needles creep in when held in the mouth for a few seconds. Juicy, oily, floral and obviously very well made.

Nose and flavor consist of both ruby red and white grapefruit juice, peel, and pith, bitter essential citrus oils, medium toasted bready grains, lemon, pungent hops akin to skunk weed, mild notes of resinous pine, a touch of tropical fruits such as pineapple and mango with some sweet malt coming in towards the end to shoelace it all together.

4.57,3.6,4.5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Huge thanks go out to IBUnit63 for this long awaited brew! Pours a pale golden orange color with a huge three finger billowy head that had great retention and left some thick rings of lacing down the glass. My goodness, I could smell the hops from 5 feet away. Enough grapefruit and citrus aroma that this seems like the cure for the common cold. A nice piney aroma is also present and almost zero maltiness in the nose. Sometimes I just love these IPAs that are practically absent of caramel malts and let the hops shine, but it's not often. This is lovely, though. Very nice bitter, hoppy flavor, mostly consisting of grapefruit, orange and possibly some lemon zest, rounded out by a light piney flavor and some cracker like toasty malts giving a somewhat solid backbone. Body on this one is the only that it's lacking, being on the low side of medium, but it really is the only less than desirable quality. Incredibly tasty and very easy to drink. This really is a great IPA. Thanks again, Larry!","KeefD","May 20, 2009"

Flavor is resiny hops, light fruit, with a nice bitterness and a perfume aftertaste. The hops are really put on front stage here and make for a delightful beer and one of the best examples of the style (a slight nit: the taste was not quite as strong as the aroma predicted). With a crisp, wet feel it makes for a refreshing summer (or anytime) beer. Highly recommended.","gyllstromk","May 20, 2009"

While I haven't been wowed so far by other Ballast Point offerings, the Sculpin is totally solid across the board. Pours very light, crisp clear and golden, with a gleaming white head, excellent lacing. The nose is deep pungent grapefruit juice and lemon, piney leafy hops, and a bit reminiscent of another popular controlled substance... The flavors in this one all meld together in beautiful hoppy unison, but the main thing I'm getting here is still the grapefruit juice, and a nice bitter citrus rind, along with slick, resiny hops. The most grapefruity beer I can ever recall having. Somehow this extremely flavorful beer remains light and lively on the palate with a dry bitter finish, and very refreshing and drinkable. At one point I was thinking of this beer as a double IPA, and then the light airyness of this beer reminded me that it is just a standard IPA really pushing the out limits of the flavor envelope. Definitely a top-tier, world class IPA, wish it was more readily available.","twelvsies","May 15, 2009"

When you take a sip, you get a load of simcoe and amarillo hops in your mouth. The citrus taste is just amazing. This is all assisted by the fact that Ballast Point went for one of the cleanest malt bases I have ever experienced. Honestly, I just drank most of a growler by myself.

Taste was a bit of a letdown - I was expecting HopSlam, and didn't get it. Extremely hoppy and spicy, no sweetness here. Lots of bitterness, citrus, lemon zest.

Some jagged slashes of lacing are revealed as the brew recedes. Nose is sweet grapefruit. Taste is bitter piney up front, followed by apricot and sweet grapefruit in the middle and a lingering bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel fell between light- and medium-bodied (but closer to light), with a consistent background effervescence without being overly prickly. Easy drinking and refreshing. Bitterness was intensified because it was initially served a little too cold; however, the true flavor and complexity is revealed as it warms.

Pour in to a tulip glass reveals a clear golden coloration, and a white lacing of white head. Very potent hop profile in the nose, my mom equated it to my old smelly hockey bag. I definitely get the mango and peach smells alluded to on the blurb on the side of the bottle. Faint garlic and onion can be detected to from the hops. Taste is very pleasant, and not nearly as extreme as the smell as far as the hops are concerned. At the same time, the dominating flavor is hops, it is like hop juice with hints of fruit here and there. Mouthfeel is somewhere between light and medium, and surprisingly the malt can be felt despite all the hop dominance. Drinking this will be a delight for any hophead. Well executed beer we have here from Ballast Point. Very complex, and I am sure I am only scratching the surface of what is happening with this one. If only this was distributed here.

The smell is amazing; aggressive and complex...from the bottle neck, peach-apricot (as suggested on the label) and from the glass a more prominent citrus and piny resin. Full flavored, a hophead's dream! Grapefruit and piny resin tastes explode and linger well into the aftertaste...that's what I'm talk'in about!! The mouth is hugely hoppy and tangy yet light in texture and carbonation. I'm seriously tempted to crack open another bomber...but that would be borderline gluttony [Wikipedia...(disambiguation) derived from the Latin gluttire, meaning to gulp down or swallow, gluttony is the over-indulgence and over-consumption of food, drink, or intoxicants to the point of waste.].

Just ideal for an IPA. The malt profile keeps me wondering even now. That strange fruity kind of dank sweetness is calling to me, but i cannot answer it. It is very mysterious.

I think mango is the strongest scent followed by passion fruit, peaches, lemon and orange zest, floral hops, and a slight pine bitterness as well. The smell on this beer is leaping from my glass, and it never left for the entire beer how strong the aromatics were. The flavor profile is loaded with citrus fruits with grapefruit and tangerines being very dominant followed up with only a slight touch of caramel malt. The malt is only barely noticable, but somehow supports the hops beautifually. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation that left a very dry finish on the back of my palate.

A very good aromatic IPA that leaves the door open to the next endeavor.","roadraper","Mar 20, 2008"
4.67,5.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"This is a very good IPA. I don't really taste the vegetal I got last time, just fruity, dank IPA. This is much better than Dorado or Big Eye. Friends said it was like Green Flash westcoast meets odell IPA. Awesome.","ArrogantB","Mar 19, 2008"
4.65,5.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Pours a crystal clear light copper hue with a fluffy two finger off-white head. Thin lacing left on the sides as the puffy cloud of bubbles slowly dies down to a thin layer. Smell is one of a kind. Fresh grapefruit, subtle evergreen, mandarin oranges, floral aromas, and pear. There is a faint scent of grass as well. By far the sweetest smelling IPA I've ever encountered. Taste begins with a sharp pine bite followed by an interesting creamy citrus flavor. Sour pink grapefruit sprinkled with sugar midway thorugh. Dry floral aftertaste with a lemon zest. Light to medium body with a pillow like feel. Very pleasant carbonation from start to finish. You don't see these IPA's brewed in the east. Such an amazing west coast IPA. Clean, refreshing, and goes down so easy. I really wish this one was avaialble in CNY. One of the best IPA's out there by far.","BeerTruth","Mar 19, 2008"
4.15,-5.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. Orangish color with a large head that dissipates quickly into a smaller one. Aroma of citrus and flowers thanks to the hops. Maybe a touch of sweet malts underneath. Taste is bitter and resiny hops, that fade into a floral and slight malty sweetness. Overall the flavor is all about hops like it should be. Medium-bodied with nice carbonation. This a very tasty beer that I could see myself drinking frequently. In fact, I had this on-cask the other night at Hamilton's and I drank quite a bit of it.","throwitallaway","Mar 18, 2008"

4.26,-3.4,5,4,4,5,4.5,"The Dorado Double had a unique richness and aroma and was strong enough to keep you a bit in check... this goes down so easily, I can imagine blowing a wad on this before you know it. Hopefully I stumble across it on draft...","errantnight","Mar 11, 2008"
5,13.4,5,5,5,5,5,"Dammmmn, what a beer this is. It's not as intense as some IPAs, or even the Dorado DIPA made by Ballast Point. This is a light, subtle, fruity, exquisite IPA that you should make every effort to taste. Appearance is a rich orange color with fluffy white foam. Smell is an intense peach and apricot flavor. The taste, as I mentioned, is not as intense as say a Stone or Dorado, but is unique among the IPAs I've tasted. Peach, apricot, lemon, grapefruit, plus the bitterness you'd expect. Really incredible mix of flavors which hint more than overwhelm. Carbonation is just right. I don't know what more I can say, except that this is a very special beer.","PhxHorn","Mar 10, 2008"
4.6,4.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Poured from 22oz bottle into PP 7th ann. Real Als Fest english pint glass. Poured a golden orange honey color with thick foamy white head. Smell is a mixture of citrus, malt, and floral hop notes. Taste is like eating a grapefruit with a slight grassy bitterness followed by semi sweet malt profile. The alcohol is well masked in the flavors with a crisp mouthfeel and medium to light body. Carbonation was in great balance with the taste retaining a creamy feel. This is one of he best tasting IPA's on the market right now with just the right alcohol level and great balance still with an upfront grapefruit taste.","sfoley333","Mar 10, 2008"

4.32,-2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a semi-hazy medium amber color with a thick off-white head that slowly dissipates. Citrusy hops dominate the nose with notes of fresh grapefruit and pine. There is some sugary sweetness up front along with a light citrusy fruitiness followed by a strong bitterness of grapefruit rind and pine oil. A thoroughly enjoyable IPA here.","Morris729","Sep 14, 2006"
4.33,-1.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Medium body with the alcohol well burried, I'd have to guess it's around 7%ABV, very high drinkability and hop-head friendly...one of the best IPA's I've ever tasted!","scottoale","Aug 19, 2006"
