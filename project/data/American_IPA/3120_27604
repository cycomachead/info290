Had this beer in Los Angeles and was surprised how much it dissapointed me in the aroma and taste department.  The floral and grassy notes were too flowery in a Sauvingon Blanc kind of way and irritatingly grassy.  The taste was more astringent than bitter to my palette.  I thought that maybe it was a bad keg or wasn't fresh so I had it again at Toronado and it was exactly the same.  I guess I'm missing something about this IPA because I'm one of the few that doesn't particularly like it.","ELS","Apr 03, 2015"

4.29,-2.5,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Overall, this was a really fun beer to review.  There is so much going on between these two hop varietals, and it is great to see them paired up here.  They come from essentially opposites sides of the hop wheel, so to speak, with the Simcoes being highly piney and earthy, while the Amarillos are lighter, sweeter, and more citric.  The “lighter” aspect of the latter really hits home here, as they are greatly overshadowed by the piney dominance of the Simcoes.  This is most apparent though the flavoring, the bitterness of which becomes ingrained within your taste buds and palate.  The aroma shows this same preference, but there is greater unity.  None of this is to the beer’s detriment, but rather just interesting discussions points between the two of us.  As with Nelson, this is a great beer, and showcases some of the more serious, refined, and mature products coming off of the west coast.","TheBrewo","Feb 23, 2015"

4.4,0,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,"On tap. Another long awaited "Want" cut into the bedpost. Pours a slightly hazy, dark orange color with a soft head. Mild lacing. Aroma is deep and resiny. West Coast all up in this nose. Amarill and Simcoe pull zero punches. Pine, grass, grapefruit, and some other fruit/hop elements. Malt? We don't need no malt here. The flavor hits my tongue and detonates. Heavy bursts of that pine and fruit I found in the nose. Earth hops. Some tropical fruits as well. A barely-noticeable sweet and neutral malt cloak. This feels and tastes like a big Double IPA. 7% feels and tastes like 10% but without the added alcohol. A West Coast uppercut of bitterness floors my palate. Lingering, long, formiddable bitterness. Has a fuller body. Is beer was quite a good time. Alpine in Massachusetts is a good thing for this dude.","VelvetExtract","Feb 21, 2015"

Bright fruity notes with some pine and just the right amount of bitterness. Maybe a little oniony too.  Sweet malts complement the fruity hops really well. Really clean finish. Mouthfeel is spot on. Really easy drinking and super low IBU for an IPA. Overall one of my favorites, edged out just a bit by Nelson. Just a really great, clean IPA.","MisSigsFan","Jan 25, 2015"

The tropical fruits, orange and lime, get enforced by a slick, long staying dry bitterness, maintaining its rich juicy character. The brews pure fruitiness gets well supported by heavy, bready malts, which let stand out its sunny, sweeter qualities. This gets countered in the finish, when the hops get a dry, lemony punch to them, still in balance with the malts, but certainly quite bitter, while at the same time bing easy drinkable. Ends with a huge load of enriching bitter hops, which remain on the palate for a long while, with a distinct fruitiness still being noteable.","aleigator","Jan 07, 2015"

Aroma is citrus forward. Super citrus- grapefruit, tangerine, some tropical fruitiness, mild pine and grain. Taste follows the nose with a wonderful citrus burst and a piney, mildly bitter finish. Malt bill is very minimal and really highlights the hops although it detracts from the mouthfeel a bit. A little lighter bodied  than I would prefer for an IPA, which makes it feel like you could drink it all day, and sometimes I do. Overall this is a world class IPA and one of my favorites.","FiremanChris","Sep 16, 2014"

Huge pineapple sweetness up front followed by bitter pine and grapefruit, some grass, and big lingering citrus notes throughout the palate. Super light bodied, easy going, and medium plus carbonation. I wish I could have this every day.","BMMillsy","May 16, 2014"

Appearance is a lighter golden clean beer. Smell was very fruity and citrusy. Little bits of mango and pineapple come through as well as some grapefruit but the big smell is orange. Taste was similar to the smell. Lots of orange citrus flavor shines. Tasted like someone dropped an orange in my glass. Mouthfeel was smooth and perfectly carbonated. Very good drinkable beer that had me asking for another bomber.","ozzman54","Dec 07, 2013"

4.41,0.2,5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"22oz courtesy of peteinSD. Then many other tap pints. Pours a clear light amber/orange with a super rocky, tan head that leaves lacing all over the place. Aroma is outstanding: dank West coast IPA with butterscotch, pineapple, orange juice, orange blossom, mango, lavender/hibiscus. Lots of floral hops. Taste is nicely balanced: super bitterness in the back of the tongue is put in check by butter and tropical fruits up front. Almost soapy, flower pedal, piney/sappy hops all over the place with lots of caramel and butterscotch to balance. This is world-class IPA without a doubt. One of my favorites. When it is fresh, it is unbeatable.","tarheels86","Sep 23, 2013"

I was traveling in CA and stopped at Stearn's Liquor mart and picked up a bottle of this. This is one of the smoothest IPA's I've ever had, yet bitter and a outstanding IPA... if you ever get a chance to get a hold of this IPA I'd advise you to buy it. Only issue with it is that I live in Kentucky and this stuff is made in CA... I need to find a way to get a hold of this stuff here locally.","isheltoe","Aug 28, 2013"

This one's not quite as "juicy" as Nelson, and I think I prefer it slightly less, but that's like saying I couldn't go to Harvard and "settled" for Yale. Drinking beers like this make me sad I can't readily get them in the Midwest, because this is another truly fantastic and drinkable IPA.","tectactoe","Aug 19, 2013"

4.32,-1.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but should be very fresh. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, peach, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, honey, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with big tropical/citrus hop complexity with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of lemon zest, tangerine, orange zest, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, floral, grass, honey, bread, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, mango, pineapple, peach, floral, honey, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity of citrus/tropical hops; with a good malt balance that doesn’t overpower the hops; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic IPA! Tons of big hop complexity and a moderate malt balance; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 25, 2013"

It poured beautifully, had a nice color and head, wonderful floral and citrus aromas; unfortunately though, I didn't find it exceptionally balanced, and the resiny finish lingered on my tongue for longer than I prefer.","ALBuff","Jan 26, 2013"
4.45,1.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Beer pours a slightly hazy gold with a fluffy white head. It's got a really aromatic aroma that has both big floral and citrus notes with a light biscuity malt aroma backing it up. The flavor here is really excellent both the floral and citrus aspects of the nose come through very nice into the flavor, and the malt backbone is just enough to balance the flavor, but very minimal. It's got a little bit of sweetness up front and then has a nice bitter (but not too bitter) hoppy finish. This beer is exceptionally easy drinking! Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a really nice carbonation and something almost sticky about it - impressive. Overall, this is a damn good IPA from Alpine and one of the best single IPAs out there right now. It had been a while since I'd had it last and I'd forgotten just how good it was.","starrdogg","Jan 26, 2013"

4.87,10.7,4.5,5,5,4,5,"Pours translucent honey-golden orange with minimal head that dissipates rapidly. Nose is full of hoppy fruitiness - grapefruit, peach, etc. I want a car air freshener with this scent. Flavor is spot on in terms of the nose. The citrus elements yield to a floral pinkness which is lovely. Little bit of alcohol on the back end which helps to keep the sweetness down. Not an off flavor to be found. Only nitpicking issue found which keeps this from being a perfect IPA is in the mouthfeel - perhaps a bit on the light side. Overall a fantastic West Coast IPA that vies for archetypal status in regards to this style.","COYS1984","Nov 03, 2012"

Some definite grapefruit and tropical fruits up front with just a touch of pine behind it. I was expecting more pine from the simcoe hops but this one is very well balanced. The fruitiness really opens up on the nose as the beer warms up, I start to get some peaches and apricots after a while. The taste is more of the same with tons of oily citrus fruits balanced with just enough malt for a dry bitterness and a smooth mouthfeel.

5,13.6,5,5,5,5,5,"From my haul last week at Alpine. Super fresh having just been bottled. Pours a beautiful yellow orange with a nice one inch thick pale white thick head that clings to my glass leaving intricate lacing as I sip down. The nose is a tropical fruit salad in a glass, mango and pineapple and lemon lead the way before being chased down by the super intensity of the Simcoe and Amarillo hop explosion, just amazing nose. Flavors of tangerine, mango, grapefruit and lemon peel attack the tongue with a balancing act from the malt to deliver an amazingly balanced brew. The mouth is crisp, refreshing and lively from the perfect carbonation, it begs to be gulped, but don't, nurturing this brew brings out a plethora of Flavors and complexities for those who sip. I am an unabashed Alpine head and am in San Diego on a weekly basis on business so I am fortunate to drop in for lunch and refills and get to try a lot of Alpine beer. This along with Nelson, Pure Hoppiness and Exponential Hoppiness are world class ales that I hope all BA folks get a chance to drink at least once.","OTB","Feb 15, 2012"

Taste is harmony for sure. Great showcase of two lovely hops. Bitter grapefruit is the lead role, and it reminds me how amazing it is that these flavors come from hops and barley. Doesn't seem out of balance. Medium light body that finishes a little oily. Looks like a lot of other reviewers find it thin, but I think it is quite nice. Very very nice ipa from alpine.","timtim","Nov 27, 2011"

And like all of their beers I've had the pleasure of quaffing, Duet is simply beautiful. This is a one of the best AIPA's around, and something I hope all of you BA's get a chance to encounter firsthand. It's amazing what a few good folks can do with water, grains, hops and yeast.","Rhettroactive","Oct 23, 2011"
4.17,-5.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Alpine Duet pours a crystal clear orange, with plentiful tangerine highlights. The white foam that serves as a crown to the beer draws itself up to about three fingers in height. Head retention and lacing are both solid, bu neither one is impressive at all. The nose is a good blend of pineapple/mango tropical fruit flavors and a big of citrusy grapefruit. Amarillo is definitely in the lead here, and the Simcoe hops, which I don't always get along with, manage to play a nice supporting role. The flavor has just a bit of malty caramel sweetness up front to keep things intereting. There's a solid bit of bitterness mid palate, which segues into the grapefruit aspect of the hop flavor profile. There's a big wave of tropical fruit next, before a subtle orange flavor sneak in on the close. The mouthfeel is solid, dry bodied and with a bubbly carbonation. Duet is a very good IPA, and it speaks volumes to Alpine's prodigious talent at brewing hoppy beers that this is only my third favorite such beer from them.","axeman9182","Beers"

As the head crawls back into the beer a thick ring of lace coats the sides of the glass. Smell mellow citrus hops and bread from the malts. Taste is very malty with a bitter back bone that stings the tongue a bit. This has a great crisp finish and is an easy drinker. Perfect levels of carbonation.

4.62,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall this is a GREAT IPA and a very good beer. If I were to give some newbie an IPA, this would be it. I think that's because it's not as dry and bitter as some IPAs can be. This is a sweeter IPA. The hop profile is one of my favorites thus far. If Duet is a true representation of Simcoe and Amarillo hops, than those are varieties I will be on the look out for. Great brew. Cheers!","Humulus85","Sep 06, 2011"

4.17,-5.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a crystal clear golden amber with two fluffy fingers of white head that left a nice sticky lacing. Nose is full of tropical and citrus scented hops - pineapple, grapefruit and orange. Moderate bitterness with tons of sweet, citrus, almost dank hop flavor. A light, sweet cracker type flavor comes through from the malt when you look for it. It really is all about the hops though, as the dominate the beginning, middle and end of each sip in a supremely pleasant way. No major ups and downs, just a nice solid bitterness and strong hop flavor all throughout. A low to moderate carbonation complements a slightly less than medium body with a nice sticky, dry finish. This beer drinks incredibly easily. If I lived closer this one would be a staple in the fridge. Thanks Dane!","charliedvrs","Aug 28, 2011"

The taste is beautiful flowery and pine on the back end, and again sweetish red orange and caramel malt. This tastes amazing. Medium body, and the light carbonation is spot on.

The hoppiness in the nose is just so distinct with a hint of burnt malt. Taste just explodes with clean and fresh hop flavors with a solid malt backbone. Not enough to make this any short of an amazing west-coast style IPA, but just enough to know it's there. The tropical fruits really come out in the Simcoe and Amarillo hops used. Finishes with bittering hops and melon flavors. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied...creamy yet refreshing. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer is awesome.

4.58,4.1,5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Pours a golden straw color with about two inches of bubbly, white head with a frothy appearance to the superior surface. Monstrous quantities of wet, gob-like lacing is left in it's wake. This is how an IPA should look. It smells of honey, grapefruit, piney hops, lemon, some orange, and a bit of straw. Great nose! The taste certainly keeps up with this already tremendous brew, consisting of piney hops in the front, lemon, orange, and some grapefruit citrus in the middle, and a bit of honey and caramel in the rear. Very well done. The mouth is superior; a bit of a bitter finish, but an otherwise smooth, velvety texture from perfect carbonation. The finish is flawless, not leaving a sticky film in my mouth or frantically searching for my next glass of water; just a very content palatal sensation. A phenomenal IPA that I will actively search for again.","eclipse54","Jul 28, 2011"

4.41,0.2,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: This is a tricky one to do. The flavors are all so familiar (if not even a bit cliche), but they are just so well done. Many beers taste like sun kissed citrus, but few connote the depth of sun drying and natural honeys. The flavors are soft, and this never approaches being a juice bomb. However, the balance is really something to behold. Not only is this balanced, but the point at which all the elements intersect is the land of magic. This one could be overlooked because of the familiar flavors, but this is a rare treat. Furthermore, the sessionability of this brew is beyond reason. This one is addictive, and will disappear from your glass while you try to figure out its more subtle notes.","Cavery","Jul 06, 2011"

I've had a lot of IPAs/DIPAs since then, and I'll still say that Duet is probably the best single IPA I've ever had, though it's likely tied with Nelson. This beer is delicious, but I'm no longer so sure it deserves to be very near or on top of things like Kern 5th or Pliny. Regardless, easily one of the top 5 IPAs/DIPAs I've had. This beer is amazingly refreshing, enamoring, and delicious. A delight to drink and a tragedy to finish- you must try it!","Klym","Jul 03, 2011"

Grapefruit, mango and mandarin oranges present themselves. Pale malt hovers in the background and a bit of pine can be detected as well. Taste is an explosion of fruity, citrus hops backed by sugar cookie malt. Pine enters mid palate with a medium level of hoppy bitterness. Finish is dry with a mild, lingering bitterness. Feel is medium wih a great level of carbonation making this very easy drinking and refreshing. Overall Alpine hits another one out of the park with this one!

3.67,-16.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"With a solid pour you get about a finger of just off white foam, majority medium to larger bubbles with below average retention, runs down to the surface quickly, the lacing sticks in random splotches more than streaks. The liquid has a zinc orange metallic look to it, much closer to yellow than any red, no cloudiness, a few trace bubbles here or there, consistent down to the glass bottom. Hop-driven nose of pretzel dough, salt, pine cone, herbaceous matter and earth, gets right up in there and starts scrubbing, plenty of brawn in the grapefruit to blood orange scents too, not a lot of fruit, mixed white pit fruit, thin dusting of cocoa powder accounts for the presence of malts. Close to full-bodied with a noticeably firm mouth feel, the carbonation has the grit of semi-fine sandpaper, persistent from mouth entry through finish. The tangy white grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus zings your tongue alongside the pine, iron flecks, pepper and salt bits. Were the total experience more “wet” the peach, nectarine, apple fruit might appear more tropical. Cocoa, mocha accents dry themselves, offers some yeast to multigrain bread dough. About as “chewy” as a regular IPA can get, not really an easy sipper but deserves attention for achieving personality.","farrago","Apr 22, 2011"

The 7% abv hits hard in this brew, it provides a spicy, lightly burning fusel incorporation to the flavor and a solid amount of warmth all the way down the throat. For an IPA that only includes 2 hop varieties, this brew is deep and complex with hop flavoring and aromas. It is a testament to brewers that you don't have to go crazy with ridiculously complex variations of multiple hops to produce a deeply complex and enjoyable layering of flavors and aromas.

Moderate malt and hop aromas of light bread and caramel, flowers, spruce, grapefruit, orange, light yeast, and perhaps a background note of sour milk on the last pour. Flavor starts lightly sweet and moderately acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and lightly to moderately bitter. Palate is medium, oily with a lively carbonation and lightly astringent and dry finish.

Grapefruit, herbal mint, floral tones on the palate. only on the west coast good a grop of people adjust to hoppy delicious beer like this. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, slick hop oils caue this to guide across the palate, medium bodied soft even carbonation.

Bright and expressive mouth, more tropical fruits than citrus, light pine needles, floral. Nose is amazing on this. Soft. Not highly bitter, which I like, with some nice sugar interplay there. White grapefruit that doesn't become abrasive at all, mangoes, wonderful combination there. This is a pretty elite IPA, but if I must nitpick there's an odd discordant flavor that hangs around on the back palate, as an odd bitterness. Very nice stuff.","JAXSON","Oct 13, 2010"

I generally really like Alpine's brews, and this one is no exception, in fact I thought this was fantastic. Pours a dark golden with a medium head that is pure white and leaves some great lacing. Not bad from a growler. The smell is a clean burst of pine- like walking into a pine forest after a spring rain. There is just enough clean, sweet, honeyed malt to balance the beautiful pine aromas. Perfect for me in the flavor department. Beautifully balanced with a blast of sweet pine and a hint of citrus. The mouthfeel is clean, sweet, and slightly spicy. Classic beer, really, really drinkable- I could drink these all night. Wonderful!

4.24,-3.6,4,5,4,4,4,"IT pours a deep copper, almost amber, slightly dark ,but nice clarity, beautiful 1 inch head that's dense and sticky. Moderate lacing, decent retention. The smell is grapefruit, pine, and mango upfront. I think the simcoes dominate the smell. Notes of floral resins, and grassy, piney hops are nice, and the juicy fruit comes through as well. Also, as it warms, a nice distinct, raw graininess comes up as well. The taste is interesting. It starts out bitter, then the pine and grass come in, with a nice sweet finish, with the melon and orange notes coming in. As it warms, I think the Amarillo start to dominate the taste - with heavy orange and grass notes - flavors that I think are very prominent in the Amarillo hops. You start to taste the alcohol too, but mostly it just lends a nice pleasant burn to the drink. The malts also start to peek their head out as it warms, and you end up with this very bready, sweet, bitter orange peel kind of taste for the last leg of the drink. A good tasting IPA. I think that the taste of the alcohol is all to prominent in this though - perhaps if it were subdued, this could go to the next level. The body is nice and medium, fairly full with malt, with a good sticky resinous feeling. The carbonation is mild, and lends a slight sting. I would say overall, at about 45-50F, this beer is absolutely amazing, as the grassiness starts to subside, the grain starts to come forward a bit, and the fruity hop flavor dominates. A very nice beer that I really enjoyed drinking.","taylorhamrick","Apr 02, 2010"
4.39,-0.2,4,5,4.5,3.5,4,"The beer is a clear bright golden glow with a thick slightly off white head supported by a steady stream of tiny bubbles of carbonation. Lots of thin streaks of lacing as well. The aroma is the highlight of this, exploding with sweet tropical and citrus fruits, particularly pineapple was my first thought. Flavor follows the nose with an initially sweet citric and tropic hop flavor but though out the body and into the finish the malt backbone and a slight graininess start to balance out the sweet. Mouthfeel is medium thick, with soft carbonation, resulting in a not particularly clean or crisp taste and finish. The finish almost tastes watery at times. Overall reminds me of Sculpin and has the aroma and flavor of an exceptional IPA, but the body leaves something to be desired for me.","yourefragile","Apr 02, 2010"

This is not a shy beer. It smells like a truckload of tangerine rinds and pine needles were mixed with fairy dust and dumped in a meadow of flowers. A big whiff of this beer is like aromatherapy for a hophead. As Ninkasi doubtlessly intended, this IPA is all about showcasing the hops. The flavor is light and dry with lots of hop bitterness, but there's just enough malt sweetness to keep it from paint thinner territory. The mouthfeel is oily with hop residue but just a bit thin. However, I think that I'm only noticing that because the hops are so big that my palate is assuming it's in DIPA territory. For a dry 7% abv beer, Alpine probably couldn't do any better in this regard. This is a phenomenal beer. I can't wait to try the rest of the Alpine bottles that I bought.","popery","Beers"

Very good clarity through the pour and solid lacing. Aromas are dominated with floral and hoppy scents. Also hints of grapefruit and pines. Quaff is fairly sweet with plenty of citrus fruits. A nice malty caramel taste comes forth with the warming of the brew. And of course, hops finish off the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is crisp and bitter with a full body. Drinkability is great. Another great example of west coast hops. Thanks again Jesse.","abrand","0"

3.74,-15,3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Very earthy up front with a lot of dry pine bitterness which lingers throughout into a very dry finish. The citrus character from the aroma is there but very less prominent than I expected or hoped for. Hints of lemon peel and grapefruit along with some pineapple notes. Subtle malt backbone with hints of graham cracker and biscuit. There's also some strong sweet alcohol evident mid palate and the high ABv is not very well masked. Overall this beer is a bit to dry and bitter for my liking with too strong of an alcohol presence and not enough balance. The balance that I speak of is not a lack of malt, just a lack of the flavors blending with each other. Not nearly enough citrus, sweet flavor for my taste.

Alpine brewing did a great job here and Mauerhan did a great job sending this one my way. More BAs need to try this!","Bitterbill","Oct 06, 2009"
4.42,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Upper light bodied with a dry and sticky mouthfeel. As I noted with the bottle of Nelson that I tried earlier tonight, carbonation could be kicked up a notch. It's at a pretty low level for an IPA and not as carbonated as the draft incarnation. Great stuff. A light and flavorful IPA, though I definitely prefer the draft version to this bottled batch.","HopHead84","Sep 24, 2009"
4.37,-0.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"D - Very high. Overall this is another awesome IPA from Alpine.","nickd717","Sep 21, 2009"
4.27,-3,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"D: Superb. I absolutely loved this one. Had at the same time as Nelson Rye and this one was definitely better. (Also had Exponential Hoppiness at O'Brien's that evening, and this one was definitely better in my book.)","Thorpe429","Sep 21, 2009"
4.72,7.3,4,4.5,5,4,5,"This was poured from a growler purchased at Alpine and I also had a glass on tap at O'Brien's the day before. Bright orange color with a white head that really laced the glass. The smell was a little pine but mostly bright fresh citrus fruit, excellent. The flavor was like nectarines and oranges, so juicy and hoppy, fantastic. This beer really impressed the hell out of me and I hope I can get my hands on a couple bottles if they release them.","ArrogantB","Sep 01, 2009"

4.62,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D: An exceptional IPA right up there with Sculpin, Blind Pig, AleSmith IPA, Masala Mama and Furious as the tops in the category. This is an easy drinking brew that does not skimp on flavor and aroma.","callmemickey","Aug 30, 2009"
4.52,2.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Drinkability: Delicious. I will be back. And soon. I wish this was more widely available, but I will be having it again soon. Watch it rise up the board, it deserves it.","nomomentwasted","Aug 23, 2009"

4.5,2.3,4,4,4.5,5,5,"Growler from the brewery on release day, consumed the next day. Hazy gold-light orange with a sticky white head. Ripe apricot, sweet grapefruit and lots of tangy nectarine in the aroma. Like a tangy hop-fruit salad. Almost no malt in the flavor, just pure fruity and spicy hop flavor. More bitterness in the finish than Nelson, though still not strongly bitter. Medium-light body with a dry finish. More of a classic fruit hop profile than the grapey nelson, but very tasty. One of the most drinkable IPAs that I've ever had. Alpine is owning the IPA segment right now with a handful of amazing examples that all have their own flare.","bulletrain76","May 03, 2009"
4.77,8.4,4,4.5,5,4.5,5,"D: One of the best IPAs I've ever had, a must try again if I ever see it on tap. This beer is beautiful, my new favourite IPA I think, just wish it was more available.","Halcyondays","May 02, 2009"
4.57,3.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I really liked this beer as it has tons of hops and plenty of bitterness but remains extraordinarily drinkable...like, "I could drink the whole growler" drinkable. A great beer.","gford217","Apr 27, 2009"
4.55,3.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"D - My criticisms of the mouthfeel actually contribute to the incredible drinkability of this brew. It's like chugging hop-flavored water. Absolutely the quickest drinking single IPA I've ever tasted - dangerous stuff.","MasterSki","Apr 26, 2009"
4.08,-7.3,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Solid beer. Nice the Alc is "only" 6.75%. Not as aromatic as I thought it might be. A bit more IIPA feel, big rich body. Pine hops, nice drinkability. Has more weight to it than other IPA's. Richness and a nice finish. Though the richness adds to heavyness which 1 pint of this was plenty. Nice and fresh at Toro SD today.","paytoplay","Apr 22, 2009"
4.62,5,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Overall this was easily one of the most sessionable IPAs I have ever run across and really one of the best tasting. I am glad I got this and it was worth the wait.","mikesgroove","Apr 17, 2009"
4.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability is off the chats. What a great IPA, lots of great flavors, but not too heavy at all. I could knock down quite a few of these in one sitting...","flexabull","Apr 07, 2009"

4.68,6.4,5,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Notes: I shared this with a friend and he commented that it had an English ale character to it, only with massive American hops. That's a good way to describe it; it's distinctly different than the Blind Pig we followed it up with. Softer, lighter, perhaps not as crisp and crackery as most West Coast IPAs, strangely cask-like. Wonderful stuff in any case, nearly perfect for the style.","largadeer","0"
4.5,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"More hops on the taste buds initially with some moderate malts participating. Finish is lingering and brings back hints of orange peel. Offers a nice medium body and a well balanced carbonation, which remains quite constant through the finish. Very drinkable for an IPA; ABV is kept in check as are malts, present and accounted for but not rich and cloying. Hop bitterness remains low as well. Nice balance, nice beer.","HalfFull","Nov 16, 2008"
3.9,-11.4,4,4,4,3,4,"Tap at Pizza Port, Carlsbad. Clear yellow pour with a average-sized white head. Perfumy hops with grass and pine. Smooth hop-and-malt balance that takes nothing away from the bite. More resin than grapefruit, but the citrus is definietly noticeable. Thick, but not as syrupy as other borderline IIPA/IPA's. Very good.","magictrokini","Nov 10, 2008"
4.22,-4.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,5,"D: Duet is an amazing west coast IPA. I'm happy to have access to it when it is brewed. A testament to its drinkability is how I am sitting here finishing the whole growler without hesitation.","d0ggnate","Oct 26, 2008"

4.33,-1.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Highly recommended. This was a standout for me at the fair. Wouldn't have minded having a full pint of this one. Hope to see it at one of the SD bars in the near future.","rallison","Jun 09, 2007"
3.64,-17.3,3,4,3.5,3,4,"I love some of Alpine's ales more than life itself, but I was disappointed in this one. It has a nice floral bouquet, but it lacked body and sufficient flavor to really wow me. Very little complexity. Maybe I was hoping for too much since the pub I was in had just run out of pure hoppiness and the barmaid said this would be a reasonable substitute. There really are very few substitutes for pure hoppiness.","nohead02","Jun 02, 2007"
4.24,-3.6,4,5,4,4,4,"D: Seriously quaffable and easy to drink. The growler really didnt stand a chance. It wasnt the most complex beer but it has a really nice flavor with long lingering flavor.","Westsidethreat","Jan 31, 2007"

4.8,9.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Light white cakey foam head. Strong scent of grapefruit rind and something not quite piney but very hoppy. I'm being greedy when I say I wish there were an even bigger aroma. Flavor is just like it smells. Medium strong hop bite plants this firmly in the IPA range. I tried sniffing for orange but didn't get it. Malt kicks in about 5 seconds later. Clean, hoppy, malty, tons of flavor. Virtually perfect. This is what I strive for in my homebrew!","oggg","Dec 30, 2005"
4.97,13,4.5,5,5,5,5,"West Coast style IPA made with Simcoe and Amarillo hops. Sampled this one at the brewery, then on tap at O'Brien's and again at the Liar's Club. Could not get enough of it. Light bronze, big sticky foam head. Huge, unique hop explosion of an aroma. Reminded me of sticking my head into a big bag of leaf hops before tossing them in the boil. Flavor follows suit, grapefruity citrus blended with dirty spiced pine. An astounding blend of hop flavor. Hints of mandarin orange & fresh cut grass. Not a harshly bitter beer, but it certainly lingers on the tongue. Medium bodied. Biscuit and light caramel round this out beautifully. Delightful medley of flavors showcasing the hops uniquely. Best IPA I've had to date.","garthwaite","Beers"
