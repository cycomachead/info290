"Tasting notes: Light colored, fizzy, thin-bodied. Some currant/gooseberry, peach, green grass, catty flavor notes. Sweet and recalls ginger soda, much like its ESB stablemate. Dry, crisp, moderately bitter finish. An old school American hop flavor but with the volume knob turned way down. I agree that its drinkable but could get cloying and dull rather quickly."

"Had it on draft.. Was not blown away by it. But it was the only ipa they had lol"
""
""
"Yellow/golden in color.  Somewhat of an orange aroma.  Smooth and not overly hoppy with a noticeable aftertaste."
"Gold pour with loose white head which disappeared quickly. A little grass nose. Slightly sour lemon grass taste. Lite mouthfeel. Ok overall."
"Dry and nothing special. Very bitter with strong citrus flavors"
""
"Probably will not seek out or purchase again, but would drink again."
""
""
"Rich with well-balanced hops. One of my favorite IPAs"
""
"I've had this beer many times, and while I enjoyed it initially I have since moved on. In the PNW there are just too many excellent IPAs to enjoy, and I no longer find this to be one of them."

"Not into IPA's too much. This beer didn't make me change my mind."

"Dry and hoppy. That's it. It doesn't pretend to be anything else."
""
""
"Weak IPA. Would'nt reccemend! Very Disappointed"
""
"If you want a beer to go with any food without complimenting or overpowering it, this should be it.  I would go with a hopped farmhouse."
"Crisp and refreshing, drinkable....but why? It has some of the bitterness I expect from an IPA, but very little of the Hoppiness and fruit profile that I've come to require from world class IPAs. Next."
"Easy to drink. Opens up in a glass. The fragrance has more bite than the taste."

"Long Hammer IPA is an above average beer. The finish on this IPA is sometimes musky to me, however, it is a very dependable ale."

"Light and easy on the palate.  Would drink again but prefer others."
""
""
"And actually, to me, that's part of the appeal of this beer. It's just a perfect go-to IPA. Quality flavor, but not too hoppy, and super drinkable. Great all year round."
""
""

""
"Nice depth of flavor.... You can taste the extra dry hopping added. Really nice IPA"
""
"Flavorful & on the hoppier end of the style."

"Its an IPA, nothing good to say and nothing bad to say."
""
"This was an IPA. This was not a bad IPA. I would not seek out this IPA again but would drink it happily if it materialized in front of my facehole."
""
"Never been a huge fan of Ipa's but this one was ok. I'd have it again. It came bottled. Poured in a cold glass.  Good color and head retention. Decent flavor."
""
"O:  Ok beer.  Probably won't have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not bad had on draft. Regardless of rating I would try again"
""
"A lot of hate on these review threads for this, but I did not mind it. Not really hoppy for an IPA, that's for sure. Crisp mouthfeel with good carbonation. You could do worse but certainly can do better as well"

""
"I used to buy this when it was 1.99 at my local store. The price went up to about 3 bucks and I wish I remembered how much I dislike it, maybe the recipe changed but im just not digging the taste or the after-burn. Reminds me of drinking natty-ice at the softball field when i was younger"

"12 oz bottle sampled St. Stephen's day in Offaly Ireland.  Did have any hop kick for me. Disappointed."
"Overall- a really good beer from Red Hook, I would drink this again."
""
""
"Not very hoppy, which is okay with me, but hop heads will be very disappointed."
""
""
"Very light yellow gold color(almost seems too light for a IPA. Head is weak, lacing is pretty decent. I like Redhook, but it seems that most of the reviews I give them ate similar. Although, the hops bitterness, pine and citrus comes through, overall, everything seems weak and watered down. A little disappointing."

"Citrusy hops, mild flavor, and easy to drink. Great beer for a 6.2% at less than $15 for a 12 pack but don't expect anything amazing."
"Bottled 02 Jun 2014. Thanks, Shri. A clear light orange with a dense white head that falls off leaving no lacing, this looks OK. The nose is dominated by cascade hops,grapefruity, chalky, pithy and with some candied citrus. Bitterness is noticeable. A little bit of crystal malt and cotton candy are present. The palate opens with a surprising bitterness, pungent, clean, resiny with grapefruit, pine, orange peel and a little floral character. The mid palate has a mild honey sweetness, a little cotton candy and a little dough. Drying and bitter on the finish, this beer is medium light in body and crisply carbonated. Quite decent."

"I laugh when I read ""beginners beer"". Maybe a beginning of the night beer. This beer is a staple beer. No nonsense just good beer.  No need for the thinking cap and big adjectives to describe this pale ale. Two row barley, cascade hops, yeast, and done. Simplicity is a beautiful thing, however difficult for many so called experts to comprehend."

"Long hammer is a great beginners IPA. Mellow piney citrus hop. A bit more bite than a session beer. Easy to drink for the masses. Well built beer in the northwest with good ingredients. Now only if the would mass produce Big Ballard Imperial. That is a wonderful imperial IPA."

"This is my first IPA and I have to say, not a great impression has been made on me. I like the look and it had a hearty smell too it, like others said sort of a piney-ness to it. The taste however was very bitter, I don't feel that I'm experienced enough in the IPA category to properly judge, HOWEVER, the bitterness and aftertaste for me was not something I thoroughly enjoyed. I'll continue trying out various ipa's and rewrite a review if I feel I didn't do this one justice but I will say they put enough of a alcohol percentage in to it so that I didn't completely waste my money away!"

"LongHammer is a disappointing IPA. The taste is simple and bland, with misplaced bitterness and a poor finish. It is drinkable if it is the only craft available (and it often is, due to their distribution network), but this is one that needs to be completely re-done."

"There's nothing to rave about, but this is a solid beer perhaps more suited to the tastes of those who prefer an ordinary pale ale to an IPA. However, I think this bomber cost around 4 bucks- for about a buck less, I could buy a 24 ounce bottle of Sierra Nevada pale ale, which may be a little lower in ABV but has about the same or better hop profile and has a superior taste overall. Still, I give this beer above average marks."

"I really enjoyed the offering from Red Hook, the first one of theirs that I have had. Great dark amber, almost caramel color that was appealing day and night. The smell was awesome, by far the best smelling IPA I've had - very fruity. The taste was great as well, strong flavors of citrus and spices. The only downer was the mouthfeel,to much bitter aftertaste for my liking. Otherwise a great beer. I'm looking forward to some more tonight."
"This beer begins and finishes smooth. Strong citrus and pine flavor that has the perfect balance. No bitter or sour notes. Extremely drinkable."

"For an IPA this is a poor beer. My scale is different in that I don't consider anything made with rice or corn a beer. So the really crappy stuff claiming to be beer isn't on my scale skewing the results. (e.g. Bud, Miller , Coors all have missing values - alternative would be negative numbers)"

"This ipa advertises itself as ""bold;"" perhaps they are referring to the fact that it is an ipa, it is not dark, and it does have a 6.2 abv. It advertises itself as heavily dry hopped, but that is simply not apparent in the front taste; in fact, the front taste is curiously absent. On the backside, you get your dryness and your hops, but not the satisfying bitter back a good hopped ipa will give you. On the other hand, despite the abv, this strikes me as a good session beer, where it's lack of full character is an advantage; it's really not so very bold. A decent value for the price, but not a beer that someone, looking for a new beer respect ""wow"" will savor without the question: ""Where's the beer?"""

"12 oz into tulip glass. Pretty fresh, bottled a month to the day before consumption by me. Not sure why most folks dont like it, other than maybe its a subtler IPA than were used to. In any event, I like this beer, since it was pretty cheap for a single bottle ($1.30), and is something I could drink while skateboarding or at a party. Nicely done Redhook."

"overall there's not much to say about this one. I am sucker for a good IPA and this is not one. better than most mainstream mass produced brews,but that is not saying much."

"Pours a very light gold with a minimal bubbly head. Smells of pine and grass, but not a big aroma. Taste is similar with a bit of lemon. Sweet with just a touch of bitterness. Light mouth with some carbonation. It's not bad, but somewhat unremarkable."

"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, resulting in a foamy (3/4) and otherwise smooth (1/4) mouthfeel that at first borders on being fizzy. The beer comes across as a bit thin for the style, though it . Closes dry, with medium-high stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

"I love the taste of a hoppy beer. With that being said this beer for me is a go to when I want a strong IPA with a mild finish and a full body. It has a bit of an aftertaste that is a pine type finish. It is a solid beer that I think is underrated. The smell is clean and the hops really jump out. Overall a great beer that should be tried."

"I keep hoping for something daring from Redhook, but this is definitely not it. One suspects that Long Hammer was invented because Redhook feared that they were perceived as lacking imagination. ""I know - let's make an IPA"" they said at a brainstorming session. But they came up with something as inoffensive as Fat Tire in an effort to attract exactly the same consumers. In this, I believe they have succeeded."

"Clear gold with a fluffy eggshell cap, a bit sticky on the glass with fair head retention. Not much aroma, a bit of mild citrus and malt. Thin flavour that fell away in the finish. Light malt, hint of citrus, biscuit and marshmallow. Light bodied, average carbonation. A bit disappointing overall."

"The scores I gave this beer are based on it being an IPA. There is nothing about this beer that represents an IPA. This beer tastes a lot like Labatt Blue to me(which I enjoy when I want a generic lager/ale.) It barely has any flavor, and the flavor it does have isn't hops. Overall, I am very disappointed with this beer. I wont be buying it again."

"Tried this beer out of desperation for hop flavor at my small town liquor store. I was mildly surprised. Don't really know or care how it looks in a glass. It does smell excellent. The taste is fair and balanced. Not really over the top hops but you do taste it some. The aftertaste stays with you, which I love. A little bland for an IPA, has very little malt sweetness. In the mouth its very refreshing no burn or bite. Overall, I enjoyed this blind purchase. I would by it again but the price is a factor in that. I give major points to year long availability, which this is. There are better and there are worse. Give it a try, you will not be let down."
""
"This IPA has a classic appearance, somewhat cloudy and amber. You can definitely smell the hops from the dry hopping of the brew, however I was very disappointed with the mouth feel and the taste. There was very little carbonation it the beer I had and it felt flat. The taste was average and had a slightly strange bitterness to it. Overall, I was not very happy with it and I am stuck with 5 more bottles. Maybe I'll try another one for the heck of it..."

"O - Not my favorite but not as bad as I had thought from the initial look at the ratings. I'm surprised that people call it a weak IPA as it has a fairly strong bite. Easy to drink and will pair well with some strong foods. In this class of IPA I prefer the Loose Cannon from Heavy Seas, but this will get drunk in short order."
""
"I’m giving this beer a solid 3.5, mainly because it holds a special place in my home and heart. It’s nothing particularly noteworthy, with a so-so appearance, a decent piney-citrusy aroma, and a taste that lacks the depth and character of a higher-caliber IPA. However, since I can get it readily at my local Rite-Aid for about a buck a bottle, it’s usually in my fridge - and I’m a-ok with that."

"Drank directly from the can so no comment on appearance. Scent was pine resin and generic citrus. Standard IPA scent with nothing special, complex or stand out. Taste followed the nose, pine resin, citrus rind, grapefruit rind and a very slight grainy malt. Hop forward, but not in a complex way, it didn't seem to blend well. All the normal IPA flavors were there but in an almost abrasive way when combined with the malt. Mouthfeel was light bodied with moderate carbonation and an odd, almost creamy mouthfeel. A bit light for an IPA, on with the carbonation, but the creaminess was bizarre. It didn't make it difficult to drink or unpleasant in any way, but it was different. Overall this is a standard IPA, one that is maybe a bit too course and crude in it's flavor to really be considered a good IPA. All the right elements are present but they don't seem to mesh all that well. There are certainly better options in West Coast IPAs available."
"I like IPAs so I enjoyed this more than my circa 3.6 review would seem to suggest. It is, however, when compared to other IPAs, boring, routine, and dull. There was almost no head to speak of, but that could be just due to improper pouring by my waitress. Smell was grassy and hoppy. Taste was obviously hoppy but bland for an IPA. Worth having, but boring."

"Taste: Like a beer, being my first post the only difference I've noticed between Long Hammer IPA and PBR is that the Long Hammer is heavy regardless of a light color which startled me at the first sip. It tastes hoppy, but it could just be love. As the Long Hammer gets warm it begins to sit in your mouth longer and longer between sips. Rain trickles down the window, I take another sip and reflect over what type of malt that went into the barrel and settle on a mixture of orange and lemon. There's ash in my beer."

"I can see the appeal of this as an intro IPA. It's inoffensive with a very mild hop profile. No frills, but it feels a little off overall. It's never going to be a staple in my conversion sixer, I'll leave that to Harpoon or the like."

"Longhammer IPA is Red Hook's offering in the crowded IPA market, and a product they've been making for a few years now. Very pleasant and pedestrian in every way; nice copper color, faintly hoppy bouquet that underwhelmes, and a flavor that is sweet and malty with a light taste of citrus and pine hops without being too bitter or assertive. More of an APA than an IPA, in fact I would argue that this is easier to drink than the more assertive APA's like Deschutes Mirror Pond or Widmir Alchemy Pale Ale. The problem here is that people go to an IPA to be slapped upside the face with hop flavor, a trait that this brew does not do."

"Well brewed beer but the flavors were thin for the ABV creating a typical and average IPA. I did like the piney hops which seems hard to find these days amongst all the citrus and floral varieties. Good price for a 12 pack."

" The flavor is somewhat bitter citrus up front with slight tangy yeast and becomes sweeter toward the middle with some caramel malt backing and light hint of pine from the hops near the finish but balanced more than bitter with the impression of a dry hopped pale ale in general. The overall impression is not that this is that bad, however for the style it seems a little tame. I would drink it again but don't recommend this if you are looking for a true American IPA with more bitterness than your average pale ale."

"O: This is a very smooth beer. It goes down fairly smooth. I would't consider this an IPA. More of a Pale Ale, a very good one at that. Only reason I don't consider it an IPA is because I like it more bitter… with aggressive hops."
"Overall: An alright IPA, better than the rating may indicate, especially for the price, but nothing I would seek out. It was about $2.50, otherwise I would not have given it much look. Not to be biased or discriminate, as before I knew Red Hook was owned by Anheuser-Busch/InBev, I thought I tasted a hint of corn taste. I bet this was even better before they sold out, but i'm not gonna go there."

"O - This isn't a bad beer by any means, but it's not a particularly great example of the A-IPA style. Maybe it was when it came out; I can't say. For its price point and drinkability, it definitely ranks higher than your standard BMC/AAL, but if I'm grabbing an IPA, this isn't my first choice. Still, it wins points for favoring a little complexity and sweetness over simply emphasizing massive amounts of hops for their own sake."

"O - A decent brew, though pretty mild for an IPA. Was hoping for that bold, hoppy aroma and flavor."
"O: Not a BAD beer, certainly one that helped me get into the flavors of hops along with Sierra Nevada's Pale, but as I get into bigger, better beers this one seems more and more just slightly above average. Not talking down about this beer though, I still enjoy drinking it, I'm just out of the honeymoon phase about it."

"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, nice full head developed. Lasted and laced well with a nice creamy look and feel. Appearance was golden to amber and cloudy. Aroma was malty with a hint of caramel, hop on the back. Taste had a nice malt / hop balance with caramel and slight citrus notes. Mouthfeel was creamy and full with a lingering, yet dry aftertaste of grain."
""
""

"O - Overall, this has quickly become my favorite everyday beer. It's cheap enough to sit around and drink a few without hitting your pocket, but tastes comparable to much more expensive beers. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's a fan of creative pale ales."
""
"O; Easy drinking looks good tastes good drinks smooth. Low bitterness for an IPA. 6% nicely hidden. A quality brew for a bargain price. Would definitely drink again."
"Almost more like overstrength, dry-hopped hopped English blonde. Nice for summer, and there are some hops (though I miss the Willamette berry). Just don't believe the label."

"Overall - Once upon a time this was one of my favorite IPA's... Oh how things have changed. Fairly weak in the hops department, in fact it's almost probably a touch more malty than it is hoppy. Red Hook might wanna consider rebranding this beer as a dry-hopped pale ale, because it doesn't cut it anymore in today's hop-heavy IPA world... then again, without that 'IPA' moniker, it might not sell as well."

"O- I liked this beer. Personally I would not go as far as considering it an IPA but more of a pale ale. However labeling aside This is very drinkable and I would consider it the easy drinking lawnmower beer of IPA's very refreshing smooth. Great easy drinker and crossover beer for those new to the IPA style."

"Color is a dull amber, almost lagerish. Smells a bit sour, not a good sign. Ugh, there's no hops. Totally devoid of soul. Thin mouthfeel to boot. Not impressed. I usually rate beers on the high side, this one is especially bad, so below average it goes."

"O - flavor could be better. while living out in seattle i did drink a bunch of these. when a particular beer isn't doing well, redhook slaps a new name on that particular beer recipe. so the brew i sip today probably isn't the same recipe i had back in 2008. any rate - its descent. good $4 beer."

"well, it's a clear golden brew with a white head that dissappears almost as fast as you can pour it. Pine, citrus, and malt notes fight for dominance on the nose, although there is no clear victor. Malt definitely strikes me as the most prevelant flavor, although citrus is a close second, with the pine only becoming apparent in the finish. The finish is bittersweet. The carbonation is over the top, but it is counter-acted by a beautiful oily mouthfeel. I feel like I am becoming more scrupulous in my reviews, but maybe that is a good thing. This used to be one of my favorite brews, but now it's okay at best."
""
"Pours a very clear yellow. Smells like a regular beer that is well crafted. Doesn't invite a strong hop presence, and any note that is hop like is not very interesting. Taste is clean and sweetish with an only slight hop bitterness, and not as hop forward as an IPA should be. Not hardly a bitter sustain Mouthfeel is nice and a bit dry and carbonation is way high adding to an overall creaminess. This is like a regular old beer, and tastes like it should, but this isn't an IPA."

"Pours with a good head that stays, minimal lace. Yellow to amber color. Smells of orange and grain. Mouth is thin, with slight bitter and foam. Orange profile with a bit of juicy fruit at the end. Not very hoppy, not real bitter, in fact, more like a pale ale than a IPA. Overall, okay, but more like a BMC style ""IPA"" than a real IPA."
""
"Pours a clear golden orange with a thin white head. A hint of pine in the aroma. Taste is dry bready flavor up front, followed by some citrus and pine. A bit watery for its alcohol content. Overall a pretty good tasting, but somewhat light version of an IPA."

"Hammer IPA pours a clear yellow color with a nice size white head. There is a weak floral aroma. The taste has a nice floral taste, but finishes a bit watery, and on a malty backbone. The taste is almost full, a bit watery, but very drinkable. Overall its a decent IPA."

"Another beer from the infamous woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of piney hops, a touch of citrus. Taste is kind of mild, some bitterness, a bit of pine and a touch of malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is easy drinking but kind of light for the style."
""
""
""
""
"as far as smell and taste this beer is great, however - everything else is very sub-par at best, which makes this ipa a poor contender considering the thousand others i could be drinking. my first red hook beer and i have to say, aside from the nice bottle design, i'm not impressed at all."
"This beer did pair with my dinner very nicely because it had enough flavor to through the pork chops but didn't overpower anything. I believe that as a food pairing beer this is actually and excellent choice."
""
"O: Overall a good drinkable beer with a little something extra for the effort. not an everyday drinker but wouldn't it be great to have every day."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear straw yellow with ample white head, but poor retention. Aroma is floral and citrus hop, but more on par with a pale ale rather than an IPA. Taste follows with clean bitterness and floral and citrus hop. Mouthfeel is thin, but crisp and clean. Good drinker, perfect for washing down a bag of chips or something like that, but not something I would drink if I wanted to experience an IPA, because this is more like a slightly hoppy blond ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This was the first IPA I drank-a few years back-and it's what made me fall in love with this particular style, but for some reason I remember it being 6.7% ABV, and it had a stronger hop flavor. It's very drinkable, but I'm disappointed."

""
"O: Fairly middle-of-the-road, and not something I seek out, but it's pleasant enough and good in a bind. The cans make it a bit more versatile and make the aroma much more indulgent than I've ever experienced with Long Hammer on-tap or from a bottle."
"Very average IPA that is more like a regular pale with some additional hopping. Not very impressive but good for the price. Cheaper than most other IPAs."

"I - A decent IPA that is nicely balanced and easily sessioned, but could certainly use a boost to kick it into the next level."

"Everything about this beer is light. The appearance, smell, taste... like I said, it's not a bad beer or anything, but it sure isn't much of an IPA. If you're used to BMC's, you'll probably like this one, as it doesn't have much taste to speak of. I wouldn't be opposed to drinking another one of these, but I probably won't seek it out again."

"It has potential, but the faint skunkiness is definitely a negative. I'm not sure how it could be skunked from light exposure, as the six pack carrier covers almost the entire bottle, but I suppose anything is possible. Would like to give it another shot to see if I did get a light struck bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I like the new bottles, and the line on the label ""A big fan of dry hopping, which sounds much dirtier than it is."" was worth a chuckle. Reasonably priced at $6.50/six pack as well. Not terrible, but leave it in the bottle and enjoy on a hot day with a burger or something. Not really worth drinking on its own."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a light orange color with a large bubbly head that dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves nice lacing. Has a nice floral aroma, very inviting. Tastes of earthy hops, not much else. Light bodied beer seems a little overcarbonated, but seems good otherwise, goes down great. Overall, an above average beer."
"I love the color, the sturdy brilliant white head, and the mouthfeel of this brew. It's a very tasty IPA and it stands out from many other IPAs I've had over the years. This seems like a more substantial or serious IPA than others (Saranac, for instance). I'll buy this one again, and I might even look into getting this on-keg! Well done, Red Hook!"
""
""
""
"The Crack was a total surprise as it was a) brimful and b) foamy as all get-out. This was a fresh CAN that had been refrigerated up until I bought it and directly after I got home following the two-hour trip. Upon settling, I employed the inverted Glug which netted me two fingers of tawny head with good retention. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden-yellow. Nose smelled of minty, grassy hops and my mouth was watering in anticipation. Mouthfeel was slightly thin, but the taste was purely hops in the mouth. It had a mostly peppermint taste, but there was a nice grassiness, also. Finish was dry and tasty with the hops lingering well after the swallow. I would definitely give this some cooler space, either at the beach or on Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually)."

"I can't say this beer was that great to me. It was extremely drinkable and I would definitely prefer this over a macro-lager of course. Other than that, not real impressive."
""
"Overall this was fair at best. Probably won't buy this again."
"I'm not gonna slam this one, even though I'm not sure IPA status is correct. It doesn't taste horrible...but it certainly doesn't taste like an IPA. Try again Long Hammer...I'll give you another shot."
""
""
""
""
"The flavor was much like the smell. Quite earthy with more pine than citrus in the way of hops. Decently impressed with the hop/malt balance but it is all a little bit underdone. This really tastes like a light pale ale, definitely not an IPA. Overall, very underwhelming."
""
"O: This beer is rather easy to drink and has an interesting aroma/taste but doesn’t really deliver a hop punch compared to other IPAs. It’s like an APA with a bit more hops."
""
""
""
"12oz stubby bottle, pours golden in color with a nice frothy white head, good retention and excellent lace. Doesn't appear to be an IPA. My initial thoughts are that it's mislabeled, but given color isn't everything and it looks good, it gets the 4. Aromas are herbal hops, biscuit, faint citrus. Tastes are biscuity, herbal hops, grassy, sharply astringent, sharp cheddar cheese perhaps. This really tastes more like a pilsner than an IPA to me; and for a pilsner it's pretty good. For an IPA it's lacking some qualities I'd expect for the style. Mouth-feel is thin-to-medium, smooth and dry. Overall, kind of watered down or bland compared to its counterparts in the IPA category."

"It brought me way back to a time in my life when I drank beer fast and tried not to taste it as it went down, i.e. the cheapest 40 oz.er an allowance could afford.

"Pours what appears to be a rich brownish red (the restaurant was dark) with a light tan head that laces exceptionally well up and down the glass the entire pour. Fairly strong hop presence on the nose with citrus being prominent. Nice nutty malt backbone that compliments the hops and crisp bitterness. A very enjoyable and quaffable pint."
""
""
""
""

"This beer is a beautiful gold colour with an aroma of fruitiness, probably citrusy but more orange than lemon. It has a very light bitterness but as hoppy as any good India Pale Ale. Very refreshing and day with nice sunny weather. This beer's got good character."
""
""
""
"I gave it a pretty high overall score due to the fact that it isn't a bad beer at all, just not the typical American IPA. Seems like an IPA light beer, if there is such a thing. It's a good beer, but doesn't represent the style very well at all. Also, not a great beer to just sit and drink, would probably be a bit better paired with some food."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours pale golden with an abundant, slowly dissipating white head. There are abundant tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Some lacing is left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. There are aromas of sweet malts and citrusy and piney hops. It's not a strong aroma, but it is a pleasing and inviting aroma. The taste follows the nose. There are sweet, bready malts accompanied by mild citrus and pine hop flavors. There's a mild bitter aftertaste, but this clears up relatively quickly. The body is medium with adequate carbonation. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer. While there are better IPAs on the market, this one is certainly worth a try if you're exploring the style."
"O A good sweet IPA with enough bitterness for the style but with a sweetness and creaminess that makes it unique. Very drinkable. This beer gets surprisingly poor reviews and I think it's due to it being on the light side hop wise for the style. I understand that criticism but it has solid bitterness and it's creaminess and drinkability make it unique. It's the opposite of a Stone selection but has it's place in the beer pantheon as a lighter hopped, smoother IPA. Underrated in my opinion."

"M: Medium carbonation works well with hoppy bitterness and spice notes, higher ABV leaves a slight dry feeling for a crisp clean taste."

"Overall: Long Hammer offers no surprises, but manages to get everything right for an eminently drinkable IPA. The DMS in the aroma was a bit of a surprise, but it was only barely detectable on the first sniff. The diacetyl, however, is a bit of a concern. While it doesn't bother me personally (and may even add a bit of smoothness to an otherwise resinous and (over?) carbonated beer), it's definitely out-of-type, and most would find it objectionable, even in its very minimal presence."

"A good go to beer at the Tavern on R street in Dc. Compared to the Dogfish ipa 60, I prefer this beer. No major noticeable aftertaste like the ipa 60. Just a smooth drinking cheap hop beer! The label is different from the one listed. It's in a different bottle too. A fatty bottle with small top. Has mountains on it and the sky is green and a guy with a hammer in on top of a mt with a hammer advertising RED HOOK in red."

"Poured from bottle to pint glass the beer arrives a clear golden straw color with a small 1 finger white head, some retention and lacing but not really much to comment on. Similarly the nose is weak with hints of pine hop character and biscuit malt character. This carries into the taste, which again is weak. Not much character at all. Toasted biscuit malt, mild bitterness, hint of pine in the hop. Finishes crisp and clean. Lighter bodied. Overall, forgettable."

"Pours a golden wheat color with a an antique white head. Barely any head retention at all. Some lacing on glass. Biscuit malt aromas and sweet fruit bouquet. Decent mouthfeel adds to the overall pleasant experience. Sweet citrus and pine flavors that blend well to make a very good beer. I think Red Hook has changed their recipe on this beer. It used to be more harshly bitter. Excellent IPA."

"Pretty much clear, dark yellow with not much head but enough lacing to at least rate average. Smelled grainy and not very IPAish. No real pine or hops smell that I could detect. not that hoppy or piney like I would expect from an IPA. Some citrus and grainy flavors. A bit of malt. Still, it’s not overly bitter so I’ll rate it average. Somewhat watery and not especially bitey like I like my IPAs. Average at best."

"Red Hook IPA is a good example of an American IPA. It’s golden straw in colour, nicely carbonated, but lacking a little in head and lacing. However, the smell is great, with strong citrus (grapefruit) hops aromas and fair bit of pine as well. The taste is almost completely towards the bitter end of the spectrum with very little balance, but honestly that’s a quality that I like in IPAs. It’s very bitter. It’s also very dry. Overall, this is a pretty good American IPA. I would definitely buy this again."

"o Not the hops I was expecting for an IPA. It is the main flavor of the beer, but not the star I would expect for an IPA. A hoppy bud light."

""
"I had this back in early 2008 and I thought the hop profile was terrible. Three years later, I'm somehow less negative. It's so mild that I find it hard to really complain about. This is about as average as it gets (but ""average"" should not imply ""garbage""). It's decent."
""
"Taste follows through with some grass, grapefruit and metal. The sweetness of the malt is a bit much, and I'm surprised by it considering how dry it looks, can't judge a book by its cover I guess. All in all pretty simple flavor, a beer I would sick on somebody interested in IPA's, then I would hand them something better."
"Nice drinkable beer, but not necessarily the best representative of an IPA."
"Two finger thick head on a clear dark golden body. Nice lacing. Very nice woody, pine and wet sock hop like aroma. The flavor is a bit of a let down. Initially it is piney hop heavy but it waters down quickly in the finish. A nice coriander and floral note though. Moderate carbonation and medium body. Overall this one is an average beer and a below average IPA. More like an IPA of the masses or a weak APA."

""
""
""
""
"O: This beer gets graded a bit too harshly, in my opinion. It's not amazing, but it isn't bad. I guess people grade this harshly because it isn't a hop-bomb? If you're after a marijuana taste in an IPA, this one would suffice."
"O-Overall this is a good beer. Definitely not the Best IPA I have had but still a good beer. With all the better IPAs out there I will not likely buy this one again though."
"O: Better than harpoon IMO, less malt. Could use more hops. Nothing worth seeking out but i'll take one if offered. I dig the stubby bottles."
"Not overly hoppy like most American IPAs are these days. More smooth like a traditional IPA with just the correct amount of hops. Different bottle seemed a bit awkward at first, but it really didn't matter to the taste and feel of the smokey amber liquid. Overall a very nice beer that I was surprised to find in Tampa. I'll search this one out again or just wait until my next trip to Seattle. I recommend it. I feel the previous reviews are too harsh by those who think more hops are better to no end. Simply not true. It is a great American fallacy."

"Overall, seems to lack a bit on the hops to be called an IPA. Not the best I've had."
""
""
"O - Nothing special here. There are better IPA's out there by far."
"I want to like this beer, it being from my area and all (and, admittedly, the cool bottle). But it's really nothing special. There's no reason to buy it when you can buy Smuttynose Finest Kind instead. I used the rest of the sixer to steam crab legs and they were awesome."

"For $5.99, you could do far worse with your beer dollar."

"Nothing special, though not at all terrible. Average."
""
"I do feel like this beer is a bit more of a pale ale then it is an IPA... but that being said, it's pretty much average across the board. Look and smell are nothing of note, the taste is average, although a little more sweet then you would experience from the normal IPA. The taste is a bit fruity, which is kind of odd. This really is a pale ale with more hops. All that being said, I could see this maybe being a good beer for the more commercial beer drinker to get into, and expand their palate and taste from there. I do think something like a Fat Tire may be better in that sense though."

"O- Im generally surprised this beer doesn't have a higher rating then it does. Then again the batch I tried was fresh and on tap. I will be buying again."
"Overall - decent ipa. Would make a good session. Unchallenging and mild but not boring."
""
""
"Additionally, the mouthfeel is a little too spritzy and over-carbonated, with a body on the thin side. Can't really recommend this one, as it fails to deliver much and needs a ton of amplification of subtler characteristics. Bland bitterness comes to the top, coupled with excessive carbonation, making for a pretty mediocre IPA. This was a pretty fresh bottle but it had to sit and arm for a while before the more interesting but weakly represented aspects of its flavor and taste emerged. I enjoyed the tangerine aspect of the flavor but I really had to strain to discern it."

"This beer pours a really clear golden amber color. It has about of a finger of pure white head resting on top. The head has okay retention, and it leaves behind no signs of lace on the glass. The nose is a bit faint, but it has a bit of caramel malt in the front. There is a nice piney hop aroma here as well. Also, I am getting some scents of orange peel and grapefruit. The taste starts off with a decent maltiness. There is a decent hop flavor/bitterness here as well. Also, I am getting some citrus flavor. The finish leaves some lingering piney hop bitterness on the palate. This has a body that is on the lighter side of medium, and it has decent carbonation, it goes down easy and has a pretty smooth feel to it. There is a pretty good bitter bite that accompanies this. There is decent drinkability here. It goes down easy, but it is a bit on the light side and the flavor is lacking a bit. It just kind of seems like a enteric version of an IPA. It isn't bad, but it isn't that good either. I'd drink this one again, but I wouldn't pay for it."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours a light golden straw color with a nice 1 1/2"" of whispy white foam. The head quickly disappears. The smell is mild in all aspects. Light citrus. Light pine. Light malt, somewhat bready. Just not much on the taste. Falls flat on all aspects. Didn't Redhook used to be a solid brewery? Man totally disappointed here. Not bad, just disappointed. Light bodied, plent of carbonation. Really, I'd much rather have the esb. Crazy, but I think it's more balanced. For 7.99, not mad, but here in NM, I'd rather buy some Happy Camper."

"03-24-2012 update - somehow I ended up with another bottle of this. A fresh one, dated March 7. The aroma nice, floral, intriguing, so I'd up my score on that. Quite inoffensive. Quite sprightly, like tonic water."

"Overall- Long Hammer hints at some nice hop profiles, but they are not nearly as big as they should be. The malt back bone is a nice start, but now Red Hook has to seal the deal by giving this one some hop character and upping the creamy factor of the mouth feel."

"The mouth is moderately full. Crisp as it needs to be. Good slick finish. The flavors are a little disjointed. There's some hops there, of the peppery sort. No sweetness present to balance this out. It's not scalding at all, but it is somewhat bitter. The hops just aren't that juicy or flavorful. Pretty basic beer here. I wouldn't visit this one often, but I wouldn't turn it down either."
""
"i drink this one when it is on sale and nothing else is striking my fancy. staggeringly average IPA with a lighter than normal yellowish hue. slight piney hop nose, but at least it doesn't have the damp cardboard stink that some of the other budget IPAs have (Double Take or the Fresh n Easy contract brew come to mind). mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for a beer of this style, and the bitterness feels restrained. short finish leaves me wanting more. at less than a dollar per bottle it's not a bad choice, but for a couple of bucks more you could do much better."
"a fairly standard american ipa, with an obvious attempt to hop the crap out of it, balance and body were neglected to some extent. pours a flatish looking light brass color with minimal head. great nose though, big mean hops and an alcoholy dryness. really alluring. taste is well hoppy, but not as well rounded as some others, missing that malty middle to fill it out. pleasant finish, medium body. not perfect but a reasonable ipa"
"Slightly cloudy, heavily carbonated, light amber color. Decent head, great lacing around the glass. It has a grassy, slightly piney nose, very inviting for an IPA fan. The hops come through first, with an almost too strong piney flavor that left me with a slight citrus, bitter finish. The beer was thin, almost watery. Overall I enjoyed this IPA and would recommend trying it but as a bar manager I'm not sold that I would save a tap for it."
"O - As a beer Long Hammer is just not very good. As an IPA it's terrible."
"Some of the other varieties Redhook offers were delicious, but sadly, this IPA goes into my ""forgettable"" pile."
"Not sure when they changed the bottle, but the new one is cool. I haven't had an IPA in awhile because I thought they were too bitter... not this one! First taste was on tap; that's when I decided to look for it at my Thrifty Beverage. I recommend this beer."
"Overall, one of the more drinkable IPA's in terms of quantity, there just wasn't a lot of complexity in the taste profile."
"Pours a clear apple juice color with a 1 inch puffy white head that fades to a film. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and herbal and pine hops. Taste is of sweet malt up front with an herbal and pine hop flavor that comes in on the finish. Mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good basic IPA. Nothing too great but not too bad either."
"O - This seemed to be a generic IPA that doesn't really have any kind of Wow factor. I wouldn't get this again."
"Overall I was unimpressed. The pros are that it is an approachable IPA for beginners, the price was not terrible, and for an IPA it was rather sessionable. The con was that they sacraficed a lot of possible flavor for the sake of drinkability."
"Overall: Not the best IPA I've had, but a decent brew."
"Not a great IPA. Hardly fits the style at all. Weak on the hops and just a mess all around. There are better examples out there."
"I really don’t know what I was expecting, but this was pretty average for an IPA. The smell gives hope, but that was killed after the first taste."
"O - Its an IPA, but not an exciting one"
"Clear and golden, a nice dollop of white foam that recedes to thin cap of swamp bubbles. Herbal with some pine and faint citrus coming forth. Hops become a bit leafy as it warms. Mild caramel softens the grassiness a bit before a fairly clean and dry finish. Not bad, but there are others in this price range that do more for me. I actually really like the malt side of things; clean, simple, but firm enough to hold up to some IBUs. The hopping is what needs work in this beer. More citrus, more pine, less grass and green assault. And what's with the 44 IBUs? Was it meant for a Frenchman?"
"0- Smooth, balanced and refreshing, but not what I've come to expect from the modern IPA. Not bad, not at all, just nothing special. I enjoyed it, but I certainly wouldn't seek it out."
"Given the paltry hop aroma I'm pleasantly suprised to find my glass filled with a prickly and lively IPA! More bitterness than flavor, which is again grapefruit and pine. Biscuit and butter finish."
"Cheers!"
"I think a salty dish would work well, which is not something I often envision for most brews. I'd fancy some boiled peanuts myself."
"D - Good, light hop flavored beer; nice for a beginners in the craft; not to heavy but good"
"I remember when this was one of the only IPAs you might find in a chain restaurant or even a local bar. I bought it for old time sake and am not surprised at why they have recently done an overhaul of the branding at Redhook. It is a decent beer that is of obvious quality, but it is pretty tame and lacks soul. I am fairly certain that in this day and age I could do much better, even at a chain."
"O: I would have a very tough time believing that this was an IPA if someone handed me an unmarked glass. It's more like a bigger-bodied pilsner."
"Overall: It's ok but not bright fresh and clean like I prefer IPA's but it is worth a try"
"Overall, while drinkable, I do not find Long Hammer IPA overly enjoyable though I suppose the flavor profile might grow on you with time."
"O: Not a good IPA at all, glad I only got one bottle. The best part about this beer is the bottle cap."
"Interesting taste, floral and citrusy in front, harshly bitter in the back. It's sort of an odd bitter, somewhat medicinal maybe, close to unpleasant. That medicinal bitterness tends to linger for a while in the aftertaste. A little salty as well, making for a weird mouthfeel. Some nice floral and citrus hop tastes hidden in there, but maybe there was a little too much dry-hopping or something because all of these seemed to be drowned out for the most part by the bitterness. I'm all about more hops in beer, but these seem a bit strong and odd for a regular IPA and a flavor or two are definitely off."
"O- To me Killian's Irish Red tastes much better, it's similar but less offensive. If it didn't have that aftertaste I would enjoy it."
"Overall - At 44 IBU's, there's not alot of bitterness here. BUT, with the flavors being out of balance, the bitterness comes as a ""punch"" at the end of the sip. This has 4 distinct parts - floral-citrus, semi-sweet citrus juice, a semi-dry bitterness, then alcohol. There's really not any complexity, and almost no harmony of these 4 pieces - they all happen separately, and are felt individually. It's okay and will quench your thirst, and I would probly take this over a macro, although this almost makes me think of a macro ""flavored with hops and amped alcohol"". I will finish the 6xer, but I will not purchase this again."
"O- I don't think I would get this one again."
"This one was ok...not good and wont look for it again"
"Not a bad beer, but uninspiring for an IPA."
"i like most of redhooks beers but this is sort of a dissapointment."
" ~ The look and feel are solid while the scent and taste leave a bit to be desired. I wouldn't really recommend it to a friend. But, I would like to try it on tap in it's home state just to see if the bottle and travel halfway across the county has had an adverse affect."
"o: A weak, all around IPA. I've had Pale ales with more hop punch than this. It's a nice drinkable beer, maybe as a gateway IPA, just not what I expect from an IPA."
"Redhook IPA isn't going to win over lager drinkers any more than it will hop heads. It's an IPA that lacks the character typical of the style yet has enough hoppiness to turn away the average Joe. The $2 I paid for this bottle is a fair price but it does not represent good value for money. If you're in the North-West, there are much better options available to you."
"The beer pours a murky orange-yellow color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of orange and papaya with a little bit of pine and bready malt mixed in. The flavor is pineapple and orange citrus with bread and caramel malt. The bitterness is fairly low and the beer is easy to drink. Thin to medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Another lost review found randomly during cleaning today. This was imbibed in late April, 2010. It pours a clear straw topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit rind, cantaloupe, sweet caramel, and cucumber. The taste holds notes of orange peel, light caramel, grass, grapefruit rind, and lemon peel. A strident bitterness pervades the finish something fierce. Balance be damned, apparently. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a rather dry finish. Overall, an okay IPA, but not one I'd wanna drink again, really. It seems like they tried to make this a hop-bomb, but only managed to make it too bitter."
"Overall a pretty simple beer that lacks character of any kind. Not bad, just really ordinary."
"O: Well, this is not at all what I expected when I made the purchase and I definitely feel the ""IPA"" label of this beer is misleading. This is an APA, at best, and there are plenty of APA's that have more hops than this. That said, there is nothing wrong with this beer, per se, but it certainly lacks complexity or depth. It is quite drinkable, however, and would make a great refreshing brew for a hot day, or a good session brew (the 6.5% alcohol is masked very well). So I guess how much you enjoy it will depend on what you're after."
"Notes: Was a bit more like an APA than an IPA. Not enough hops and what was there was not great. A beer I would probably pass on in the future as I'm sure there will be better choices."
"This is a refreshing IPA and not all that bitter. This could be the IPA people can use as a gateway IPA if they have never tried one. Tasty and certainly not boring."
"Overall: As far as IPA's go this is in a catagory of its own. It is much smoother/ lighter than any IPA I have had, but that being said it did have some different flavors that interested me. This is a beer that I thnk if I drank a few more I might increase my score. It was very easy to drink and the new bottle and lable are very cool."
"Overall: A great drink. A very under-appreciated beer. If you're looking to be blown away by hops then this beer isn't for you. If you want balance and great taste then this is your beer. I could drink this everyday."
"Cheers."
"This brew pours a brilliant golden color with huge carbonation and a tiny head. A bit of lacing, poor retention. The aroma is nice, it's got a nice dry hopping that lends some nice piney characters. The taste here is pretty nice, it's got huge zesty citrus up front, then a subtle amount of piney hops come in. It's all backed by an assertive caramel malt backbone. The mouthfeel is briskly carbonated and lighter-bodied, and the drinkability is quite good. Overall, this is an alright brew, I'd probably consider it more of an APA, but it's still pretty tasty."
"There is a nice aftertaste that keeps me interested and lingering bitterness that is just the right amount of flavor. There is a smooth warming feel that is hot but silky. This beer is highly drinkable and goes down pretty easy."
"The beer has minimal lacing and almost no foam. Nice gold color, but the entire appearance looks like your average Canadian lager. The smell is sweet and crisp and not much else. The taste scores some points for great hops, kind of pine-like, that taste great from the start and finish with a sublime bitter aftertaste. However, there's no balance. The malt balance is gone and the beer is way too damn thin."
"M - Thin-to-medium body. Decent carbonation. Dry, yet thick and syrupy finish."
"O- It's a decent, easy drinking IPA, but there is not much character to it."
"Low carbonation and a very thin mouthfeel. Weak, slightly sweet caramel malt up front with lemon and a trace of pine. Watery and just a hint of bitterness. Not impressed."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight earthy malt, citrus hops, hint of alcohol, hint of grain, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong citrus hops, sweet malt, slight earthy malt, hint of dry hop, and hint of pale malt. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body."
"Overall this is actually a pretty decent IPA in my opinion. I would definitely purchase this if I needed an affordable IPA"
"Poured on-tap and served in a pint glass, the beer is a bright yellow-orange coloring with a thin, filmy head that clings strongly to the glass. Lemon and orange aromas, effervescent in feel. The taste is light, sweet citrus tinged malt with a blast of peppery dry hops shortly after. Green and bitter throughout, with a rustic, peppered, and bitter aftertaste. The finish is dry and peppered, leaving the tongue slightly puckered."
"This IPA pours out as a nice looking copperish gold color, the head is pretty good looking. The lacing is nice and thick for a typical ipa. The smell is hoppy and has a good malt aroma too. The taste has a pretty good bitterness to it. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Overall the beer has pretty good quality from start to finish. I enjoyed this."
"Overall, this is a nice, moderately priced, beer. I would absolutely buy it again. It's a good 95-degrees-out beer, and a great sharing beer."
"Overall (4.0): I have to agree with the Bros’ assessment that this isn’t really an IPA (I’d say it’s generally closer to an APA), which lowers its score a bit. But, if we’re just grading for enjoyment, this is a nice session beer, and very quaffable—the kind of thing I’d want during the summer. Can’t hate it for that."
"Wow. This is really a poor ipa. I will not be buying this ever again."
"Cheers!"
"Do not seek this out."
"Overall this is mediocre ipa. There is nothing special about this one but at least it is not terrible."
"The mouthfeel is pretty sharp with carbonation, but not in a bad way. It goes well with the light body. If we still scored beers on ""Drinkability"" than this beer would get a good score in that category. Instead, we're scoring for overall impressions. And this beer's overall impression is not a positive one. Avoid. I'm only scoring it as a 2.5 because this beer would make for a nice APA."
"Poured into a pint glass an orange-yellow with a small wisp of white bubbles for a head. Mild citrus in the aroma and some pale malt evidence. Light malt sweetness in the taste, with citrus zest and, light grassy hops. Hmm. Decent, but not great. Light-medium mouthfeel, and somewhat drinkable, but certainly not exemplary of the style."
"This is a good IPA - certainly not great, but one I don't mind having every so often."
"Overall: Sessionable drinking, good for certain foods? Absolutely. But not what I would call a good fit for the American IPA style bump up both the malt and hops, and have the flavors chase one target, and this would be an okay beer. This will be my first and last sixer of this brew."
"Overall, not very good. Reasonably fresh for a Redhook IPA, but that doesn't apparently make it any more redeeming."
"D: a good beer, definitely not great. more of an APA due to the slightly muted characteristics."
"This would be a good first IPA for someone who is just getting into hoppy beers (ie. Non BMC offerings). But in the craft brew arena this doesn't quite cut it."
"Straw colored brew that produces a quick-falling head with a stern pour. Smells grassy with a touch of pine. Taste is clean and mild with plenty of bitterness. A bit of floral hop flavor but there is a real lack of depth in the palate. Light bodied with a fluid mouthfeel. This is a drinkable blond ale that appeals to a broad spectrum of consumers. That's not a bad thing, especially if it leads people to better beer. The issue I have is, it appears that they took a mild ale, did a little dry hopping and changed the name to cash in on the IPA bandwagon. When the marketing is more of a focus than the product, I tend to steer clear."
"Overall- Enjoyable but nothing special. Very dulled down and doesn't have as many hops as I thought it had in the past. I'm hoping to have again and maybe my outlook will be different. While enjoy so many great IPA's lately, its tough to rate these average ones."
"Over all this beer is just ok, I would drink it if it was at a buddys house but I do not think I will be buying this again, alot better beers for less money."
"VERY BITTER!! There is no real flavor profile to back up the intensity of the bitterness. No real malt to back up."
"The look is a pleasing clear light copper with bright yellow highlights and a generous white creamy head. The nose is on the subtle side but good with some citrus, light malt and a touch of vanilla. The taste is pretty much the same. Nothing stands out and there is only a mild dry bitternes on the finish with a bit of oily grapefruit peel. More of a Northwest Pale Ale but very easy to drink and a refreshing brew. A solid good."
"O - Lots of distaste for this it seems, but it wasn't altogether too bad. Good for a casual beer pick up from time to time when the selection isn't great."
"O: This was an ok beer. Nothing special. Average, but better than anything else offered at the Hard Rock."
"I would say this is more of an APA, but not a bad one. It just doesn't have the vigor of a good IPA (after all, it does claim only 44 IBUs). The flavors are respectable, it just needs to turn the volume up and throw in some more body. Perhaps Big Ballard will be on my agenda later."
"O-I would give this a 3.25. Another nondescript IPA I won't bother with again. About the only thing positive I can comment on is this might be a good introduction to the IPA style for someone only accustomed to BMC swill."
"Taste is again, hops, with a hint of orange. Rather serious IPA at 6.5 ABV, but worth it. I enjoyed. And recommend."
"Overall good if there is not much selection where you might be."
"Overall not a bad beer I was just left wanting some more flavor from it."
"C- (2.58)"
"Overall- eh. Slightly better than average."
"{Not just a new bottle? -- Revisited in August 2011, with a suspicion that Red Hook has improved the formulation of this IPA; the packaging and listed ABV (6.5%) has changed. ... 2012 sample seems to split the difference.}"
"The Longhammer was a breath of fresh air compared to the other beers on tap at the Redhook Brewery. I say this because the ESB, Golden, Mudslinger, and Copper ales all seemed to taste similiar. The longhammmer was a clear golder beer with pining/citrus nose. The taste is dominated by pine, not a whole lot of citrus. The mouthfeel is good and I could do a session with this beer."
"Draught. Pours deep golden with a white head and a lot of lacing. Aroma is of biscuit malt and citrus hops. Body is light and not too crisp for IPA. Taste is mostly citrus hops with some sweet, malty notes. Long, hoppy finish. Pleasant, easy drinking IPA."
"O- Good IPA but not my favorite. This is an easy drinker but nothing fantastic. Ill get this beer again because i love IPA's and i love cheap IPA's ;) Sometimes... Its good when you see it at the Circle K for 9. 85! im sold!!!"
"The feel isn't bad. The body is light and there is good carbonation. Nothing offensive there. Overall, this is lame. There are a lot of beers I would drink before this. Still trying to figure out why I grabbed it."
"Red Hook Ale Brewery, Inc.--Long Hammer IPA Is A Big Fan Of Dry Hopping, Which Sounds Much Dirtier Than It Is--2011 New Graphic Retro Stubby 12 oz. Bottle. 6.50% ABV. 44 IBU's. (3.5 / 5.0) Nice mild lace lasting 1/2 inch off white head. Clear thin bright gold color. Delicate floral Cascade hopp front. Crisp mellow mildly cloying sweet smooth light caramel malty doughy fruit hint rich Pale Ale body. Clean mild refreshing light crisp hop spice balanced smooth end. Well made mellow hop Session IPA. Soft rather than sharp hops. Sampled 3/22/2011. Purchased 6-Pack for $7.99 at Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle on 3/22/2011."
"Overall good but far from excellent."
"I am a big ipa fan and have tried many india pale ales brewed by numerous breweries. Long Hammer is not impressive at all. The smell was bordering on sour, and the taste wasn't any better....no citrus notes like most good india pale ales. Perhaps I got an outdated specimen...if not ....Long Hammer isn't very impressive."
"Not bad, a drinkable IPA with a sweet and sourness going on in the hops."
"D: Tastes are subdued, but still good, I could definitely go through a couple of these, but 6.5% abv would make me think twice. Good beer, just not great."
"A solid and tasty sessionable IPA. Not outstanding but worthy nonetheless."
"D: Overall, it was a decent drink, but not exactly what I'm looking for in an IPA. I probably wouldn't purchase this again if I'm in the mood for an IPA."
"Light body with little carbonation. Relatively drinkable IPA."
"Poured into pint glass has a good head, nice carbination and a light goldish yellow in color. Floral smell with tones of pine. Very light beer not heavy at all. Does not have that strong bitter smack to it. Very easy to drink. No bite. Taste like a light IPA beer if there is such a thing. Overall I like my IPA with more bite. Maybe Seattle should stick to coffee."
"It is your basic IPA"
"This beer has a different kind of biterness, I thought it was pretty good."
"DRINKABILITY: A good drinkable IPA. Although I pre judged this beer early, I was over all satified. I ordered two more after that. There just wasn't a whole lot to write home about."
"Had both 12oz bottles and draught into a pint glass. Pours a medium-to-thick, off-white, foamy head and a cloudy, orange appearance, with fuzzy, white particulate matter floating everywhere. Carbonation is moderate and a good amount of lacing rings are left down the glass. Aroma is all citrus hops, and the taste is likewise hop heavy, although a breadiness is detected in the middle, and all of this is pretty mild. Mouth-feel is even bodied, and Redhook Long Hammer IPA finishes wet and spicy. Overall, this is an interesting and mild ale."
"I would recommend this IPA to a light lager drinker as an introduction because it is not overpowering. After that, I would ""move up"" to the more distinctive taste of other IPA's."
"Pours a clear golden color with a nice two finger white head which gives way to some good lacing on the glass. The aroma is faint, what is there is a floral and citrus hop smell. The tatse is pretty subdued for an ipa, no big hop bite, a small floral hop is blended with a weak grainy malt. The taste is a standard ipa taste nothing to blow you away. The mouthfeel is moderatley carbonated. The drinkability is okay, it isn't a hard drink, its mellow and smooth. There isn't though a big hop presence that an ipa drinker wants, not enough to keep me interested."
"I like this brew and although it isn't one of my favorites, I will be buying it again."
"Feels solid in the mouth, and drinkability is good, although at 6.5% you might want to moderately pace yourself."
"Good initial taste and mouthfeel. Not overly hoppy. Have since found out the reason that it's not overly hoppy is because it's not really an IPA! IPA fans steer clear. Initial aftertaste is OK, but it lingers and tasted like a bad American lite beer and grossed me out. Compare that aftertaste with a true IPA where it's a nice blend of hops and fruits. Not impressed with this beer especially when compared to real IPAs."
"First off, I drink my beer from an authentic German bierkrug with a pewter lid. Seems people don't like this beer, but I cannot find anything wrong with it. I bought it due to limit choices but was not disappointed. The aroma was amazing when I would open the lid. People also say its not an IPA and I disagree. I guess they use Columbus hops, which are very strong, bitter, and big...but whatever they are I think they get the job done. Nice alcohol content and the taste is very balanced. So yeah, it doesn't punch you in the face like some IPAs, but it's very hoppy and balanced. I wouldn't choose this over many other IPAs, but if it were you're only choice, it's good. Cheers!"
"Beer is medium bodied with almost no hop flavor and all hop bitterness. it is mildly malt -- I'm really disappointed. I haven't had this beer in years and I remember liking it...oh wait that's Redhock IPA, nevermind, this beer sucks."
"Overall, this is a solid IPA; I'm not certain why others haven't cared for the taste, since it catches my fancy."
"Redhook is a brewery that is not trendy to like. But it is solid, simple, and reliable, and it is a great cheap alternative if you just want a frew beers to kick back and relax with without having to devote too much thought to what is in your glass."
"RJT"
"Check it out next time you want something cheap and light to drink in mass quantities."
"If you have heartburn...and a man with balls, drink this. But after awhile...the taste will roll flat...And thats why I suggest the Ranger."
"Opt for the much better, all-around Smuttynose IPA."
"Highly drinkable, this goes down easy with ease and is very tasty. Compared to other IPA's this is on the weak side, but still a good one to drink all night."
"Drink- I'm not a fan of their starter IPA. A big let down for me."
"Drinks easy for an ipa, could drink a few with non-ipa enthusiasts, maybe a good ipa beginner ale."
"I don't really get all the hate for this beer, I really didn't find it bad. Not great, but definitely not bad. Paired fine with a simple sandwich and veggies."
"Drink-ability: A perfect summer beer, or a beer to pair with spicy food. I like it a lot, and it won't be the last time I down a few."
"Longhammer IPA is a very average and basic IPA."
"I can see how Longhammer is so popular with the masses, as it's definitely an approachable IPA. But for this beer drinker, big flavors and hops that smack you in the mouth are more important than approachability. Longhammer is decent, but nothing more."
"D- Very refreshing and drinkable. Perfect for a chugger after mowing the grass."
"D-hmm i actually like this a lot....i'm very confused by the other peoples' reviews...the taste isn't too complex but its otherwise a great drink. i could have many glasses of this with complete satisfaction"
"The beer is a light orange / yellow color and appears clear with mild effervescence. The aroma is rather weak, with a light dose of hops and citrus. The flavor is average, and could be bolder. The hop presence is pretty subdued and tame. The finish has a subtle odd note with a hint of alcohol. Overall, a mediocre example of the style. I won't order this again."
"D: Not really my favorite IPA, but it's not as terrible as some of the ratings indicate. But it is about as average as its score here."
"Drinkability- Goes down rather easily but just lacks the IPA quenchness."
"D: Before I really got into craft beer, this was my go-to IPA (by its former name of course). However, tastes change and people change, and this one just doesn't have the same appeal it once did for me."
"This is not an IPA in the true sense, nor is it a brew for hop heads. However, it is very drinkable and packs a punch more than the ABV: 6.50% would indicate. I had a bunch of $3 off coupons on 12 packs and was only paying $7.99, so it became my every day beer of choice. In that price range it beats most everything out there thus allowing me to savor the real IPA's."
"Yellow-orange in color with lots of floaties and a thick haze. Poured with a thin white head that leaves a nice cap and lots of wet lacings. Light floral hop aroma with lemon and orange aromas and an earthy grassy undertone. Medium bodied with nice carbonation, but a little watery at the finish. Appears to be a fuller bodied beer than it actually is. A mix of malt flavors with orange and lemon hop flavors right up front, banana in the middle and light pine hop finish that leaves a lingering bitter aftertaste. Quite different than most IPAs that are available. A complex flavor profile that lacks the hop intensity that I've come to expect from an IPA."
"some of the hatred for this beer is a bit over-the top, and I think the frustration really lies in the idea that this beer is not really half bad, but it could be so much more. it's not really an IPA that challenges the palate, but rather, is fairly representative of the style and another IPA in the hop-filled market at the moment. although it was likely fairly groundbreaking to the American market when originally released by Red Hook, Long Hammer has become a sort of also-ran in the IPA market. A solid brew, without a doubt (imagine if this was in 30 packs for cheap?!?!!) but hard for me to pull off the shelf when there are so many other brews available at a similar price point. I would recommend trying this if it's part of a Red Hook sampler pack or the like, but I wouldn't trudge through the forests of Siberia to find this fairly average IPA."
"This is your standard utility American IPA, nothing too crazy or in-your-face, but just a solid IPA in the regional brewery genre--perhaps more of a Pale Ale by today's standards. Satay ginger chicken with a spicy peanut dipping sauce did very well with this beer."
"I don't get all the hate for this beer. I tend to enjoy it on occasion. Living in a land where the better stores close at 7pm and getting off at 8, being able to find this in a gas station is quite good. Sure it isn't the best around, but it is not meant to be either. For what it is, I will take it and gladly."
"This beer was not one of the greatest IPA'S I have had. Its appearance and smell was not something to talk about. The beer itself was barely drinkable. I did not enjoy the mouthfeel of the beer it did not give a great filling taste like some other IPA'S I have had. The taste itself was somewhat citrusy with some flowery taste at the end. The drinkability of this beer for me is not good, it is not a beer I would like to try again."
"Pours a moderate copper color with a white head. The nose brings faint hints of citrus and pine with a pretty hefty dose of generic doughy bread in place of actual hop characteristics. The taste is the same way; this is just a generic base with a mild sprinkle of hops. Medium feel with no appreciable bitterness levels. Drinks fine, but there's no reason to want to drink more of this."
"Overall, this ia a reasonable beer, but nothing really stands out, nor makes it exceptionally bad."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied, fairly smooth with decent carbonation. Fairly drinkable IPA, but probably not one I'd go out of my way to try again."
"Drinks not too easily, could not have more than maybe two."
"I'm pretty sure this costs over $8 at most grocery stores here in New Orleans which makes it a lot less attractive relative to more complex beers that might be equally priced (I'm guessing they are cheaper in the Northwest?). In fact, I wouldn't have bought it if it wasn't on sale. Still, I wouldn't mind drinking several of these at a time; in fact, I'd enjoy it."
"D> Surprisingly this beer is very drinkable - good aroma, decent (although lacking) flavor. This seems like a good beer for BBQs, parties, etc. The totally tame taste and high ABV seems like this would be a good ""everyman"" beer"
"D- It is not as smooth as it cohuld be, it still good though."
"d- decent beer by all means but not something i think ill try again"
"D-Very drinkable, and a great intro to American IPAs for the beginner."
"Feel wise it is a little thin and watery. A decent bbqing beer, but not much soul to this one."
"If you want good beer, spend another buck or two and you can have GOOD beerrr"
"This seems more like an APA than a true IPA."
"IMPORTANT NOTE: I have a hard time believing that this beer is in fact an IPA; nay, it is more of an American Pale Ale. For that reason, (and I blame RedHook for this,) lots of reviewers will underscore it, as well they should since it is lacking in the IPA world. Why not change the name? Probably because IPA's are so hot right now."
"Overall: It's an IPA. Solid, but not outstanding in the field."
"Very Average IPA but the price is good so I may have this again!"
"Got a 12 pack of this beer for a steal. Not a bad beer to have around the house for a kick back or bbq. Certainly not complex, but well balanced and sessionable. The type of beer you want when you dont want to think too much about the subtl nuiances of the beer but just want something boozy and pleasent."
"Serving type: 12oz. Bottle poured into chilled 16oz. glass."
"This beer is very generic for the style. It is a mellow taste. It was a beginner IPA for me and tasting it now I can see why it is rated so low but its not as bad as its ratings in my opinion. Worth a try if you're new to the game...if not spend your money on something else."
"Not very drinkable, I'm probably not going to buy another sixer of this stuff. Acceptable for a cool day of yard work if someone else is buying."
"A nice, basic American style IPA with no real flaws, but the one dimensional hoppiness and lack of interesting malt body keep it from being that interesting."
"Drinkability: This should only be given to a macro drinker as an introduction to the IPA style. For anyone used to the style, this is a disappointment."
"D: The citrus adds to the drinkability of this IMO, not the most complex IPA but a good bbq beer."
"12 ounce bottle. You know, I'm not sure when they did it, but I like Red Hook's ""split"" front label. It's unique and not something I've seen by any other brewery. Pours a dark gold with a nice bubbling head with some decent retention. Much larger bubbles than I've seen in other beers. Aroma is of straw with some light citrus in the background. Some biscuit type cereal notes that are more characteristic of a lager than something billing itself as an IPA. The mouthfeel is disappointing. It's very flat and almost watery. There's little carbonation to the beer. Not a lot going when you taste the beer either - it's almost nondescript. There's light hop character of orange peel up front and mild cereal malt finishes. Some tulip style floral notes open up the more you drink it. Think of it as a very sessionable IPA, though it lacks the straight ahead hop profile characteristics I like in my IPAs. Honestly it's more like a lager at than anything else. Easy to drink, easy to forget."
"Just a note: If you are looking for an IPA, don't go for this. I'm not a huge fan of IPAs and I only have them every once in a while. This is probably why my rating is higher than others."
"And for those who doubt the veracity of my review on this bottle, I'm now drinking a nice (and recent standard stock of mine) Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA. I actually found more malts and complexity in this Long Hammer. But I still have 4 more bottles and plan to buy more, and I will sure as hell down-rate this Long Hammer if I have one less-impressionable experience."
"D - Lawnmower beer! Not a bad thing."
"D - Moderate drinkability. Flavors are a bit all over the place, but not overbearing. ABV is manageable. Tongue stickiness is a bit high, somewhat ruining sessioning."
"I paid way to much for this 6 pack. I gues you could say it resembles an IPA...kind of. Its like brown ale/pale ale hybrid. When I taste it what comes to mind is taking a Fat Tire and mixing it 50-50 with a Sierra Nevada pale ale. Its not terrible, just not an IPA. I don't think I will ever drink this again."
"Overall, I thought it was forgettable. I didn't think it was a good example of an IPA - too weak in flavor and aroma. This might be good for someone who wants to get introduced to IPA's. It was worth a try but there was nothing in this beer that made me want to reach for another. You could live your whole life and not feel jipped if you did not have this one."
"D - Well no I don't want to have it again and really am tired of average IPA's. They are just not good and this beer seemed to sneak up on me with high hopes of tasting good but leaving me slightly disappointed."
"This is a beer that missed the mark. Where are the lemony spicy hops. Where is the lingering aftertaste? What happened? The smell was not like and IPA. It did not have a crisp citrus smell with a caremel malt. It was kinda sweet and tinny. The taste was too malty and not bitter. No I will pass on having another."
"D- Nothing really special here and just plain average. Easy to drink and I think I'd consider this one a beginner IPA."
"I wouldnt really recommend this to any of my friends. BUT if I were in NH and this was on tap I could think of quite a few beers I would have Long hammer over."
"This one appears with just over a finger of head above more golden-than-red body. It has a ""typical IPA"" smell but weaker and is about just as lacking in the taste department. It's light-bodied and prickly, by the end I just don't like the taste. Should be labeled ""Light IPA."""
"A very restrained, but still acceptable version of the style, most likely best served as an introduction to those unfamiliar with it, as I was, once. Easy to drink, and unassuming, something to kill when your taste buds and/or palate have already been."
"If I was an IPA drinker, I'd probably have another. It's not all that bad and worth a try for someone new to the style."
"Pours a nice golden color from the bottle but doesn't leave much head or any lacing down the glass at all. Only a light lemon scent to speak of as far as smells go. I was more expecting a huge hop aroma on this one. While I like the initial bite of this beer the aftertaste dies away quickly and is a bit of a disappointment. Not one of my favorite IPA's but a decent brew to at least give a shot."
"The only real negative is an apparent inconsistency in the quality. Never swillish, but some times far better than others."
"Nope! I couldn't drink the rest of the beer. Aftertaste is just nasty as hell. Gives me a headache everytime I take a sip."
"Overall, a good beer to use as an introduction to the style. It would give someone an idea of what to expect and provide a good baseline for judging other IPA's. In other words, a training wheel IPA."
"I've had Longhammer many times and if it's hot outside and the sun is still in the sky it can be very enjoyable and actually quite refreshing. At times though, the palate, it just doesn't work for me."
"D-I'd pick this over most taps of the garbage that's in my area in most pubs, but I sure wouldn't tell a hophead that it's an IPA to even mention."
"Very drinkable. Even though ABV is a little high it is a good session beer. One of my favorite summer ales."
"This is all my neighbor really drinks and every now a then we tip a couple back. Mild IPA. Orange citrus and caramel in the nose. Caramel sweetness and fuity hops in the flavour followed by a balanced bitterness. Very quaffable and not bad, wouldnt hesitate to drink again but not something I would seek out."
"D: As an IPA, it's on the weaker side. It is still a decent beer, though."
"d - very easy to drink. could throw back several, though not quite a session beer with the slightly higher alcohol level. would definitely have another, although id choose many others before this one."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with about a finger of head. Upon first sip, it is sweet with a very mild hop presence. It lingers on the roof of my mouth and the finish is long and slow. It is smooth but does not provide that bite I was expecting or yearning for. This would make a great beginners IPA."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly flat for how carbonated the beer appears. Neither thick nor heavy. While not an impressive beer, it's not bad. Drinkable, sessionable, however you want to call it."
"Overall an ok beer, I wont seek it out again, but I wouldn't say no to a free one."
"If you want an IPA, look elsewhere, my friend."
"Drinkability - No thanks this is not a true IPA in anyway. Gives me a bitter beer face."
"I would suggest this beer to anyone delving the great world of IPAs as a starter beer."
"Drinkability: A pretty sub-par IPA. Not nearly hoppy enough and extremely artifical tasting. Look elsewhere..."
"d - If it weren't for the taste, this would be a pretty good beer. Unfortunately, the taste is the most important part, and this one drops the ball in that area."
"D- average says it best, seeing as they're more concerned with pushing product than giving us something to savor"
"D- Drinkability is pretty high for this. Being over 6% alcohol the did a nice job, but in my opinion it i pretty mild tasting for an IPA. I would recommend it if you like pale ales more so than IPA's. Not bad, its just that there are better IPA's out there."
"Overall, this beer is ok, but nothing special. It is a regular in my fridge for the sole reason that I live in a rural area and my local grocer carries a limited selection so I've tried everything they have. If you have the choice of this and something else, try something else first, but make sure to try this sometime."
"Drain pour."
"Drinkability: very easy to drink lots of these"
"Overall this is a very mellow IPA - seems more like an APA, really. If I was grading more to style, the scores would be lower. Uncomplicated, unexceptional, no flaws. Easy drinking and good for situations, like some parties, when you know you're not going to be paying enough attention to what's in your glass to break out the real good stuff, but you want something that tastes good. Unoffensive - could be a good intro to better beer for the uninitiated palate. Good for parties where you don't want to offend your guests' palates, but you refuse to offend your own at the same time. Good for what it is and the price point."
"D- Surprising that the 6.5% is masked so well, I guess if tossing back beer with nearly lifeless qualities is your thing you could do this one all night."
"Pretty easy to drink, but the flavor profile isn't overwhelming enough to keep me happy glass after glass."
"Generally, when I'm in the mood for an IPA it's because I want something that packs a powerful hoppy punch. This is not that beer. Now that's not to say this isn't a great beer...in fact, I thought it was quite good! It's just not what I'm looking for in an IPA. I'll definitely drink Long Hammer in the future, but it will more than likely show up as a standard daily drink-with-dinner brew as opposed to a hops fix."
"I know it's fashionable to put these guys down, but this beer surprised me. Nothing wrong with this at all, and I'd happily order it again."
"I could drink a few of these...but dont really want to. The best thing about this beer is that it was quite cheap for an IPA."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is full and rich, drinkability is average with heavy hops when you gulp but nothing unexpected."
"D: Drinks alright except for the carbonation - burns a lot going down. Easy to put down since it's so light."
"D- Easy to drink, but wouldn't do it again unless I had to."
"D: Price-wise, very good. But you get what you pay for. Hopheads like me will not be left 100% satisfied, but those just getting into IPA's, it's a very good start. I bought a 12 pack for the Superbowl and even my non-IPA-loving friends liked it. So I'd buy it again for the same crowd and drink a few myself. However, it wouldn't be my first choice for myself...needs a little more umph."
"Like I said...it's an ok beer."
"if you like IPAs, don't trust the horrible reviews on this guy. go out and try it for yourself. you may be pleasantly surprised like i was."
"Edit: Just poured a not-very-fresh Bell's Two-Hearted to go up against this. Even the slightly stale Two-Hearted blew it away."
"This used to be a decent beer."
"Get it, got it? good."
"This was my first IPA so it does hold some sort of sentimental value to me seeing as it's what got me hooked on them. Pretty thin feeling mf which does kinda lend to its drinkability. Smells like most IPA's in my opinion only in a very weak sense. The hops are also there but not enough to satisfy a real hop head though. Overall, a great beer if you want to start trying IPA's without getting carried away on hops."
"looks reasonable, orangey color, the normal casky head that slowly dissipates. actually in this case, very slowly. smells kinda like the fields of yakima. only if you're in your car with the ac on and the windows up. little citrus/grapefruit thing, little pine, little grassiness. the taste is underwhelming but not bad. little malt body to hold this beer up. maybe they are more worried about counting calories? the hops are there but a bit too light. it honestly feels like an unbalanced ipa that's trying to straddle it all and just comes out a little bland. very thin tasting. as much crap as i'm giving them, though, not a bad beer, and i know the path they put us down in the pac nw."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Decent drinkability, mostly due to it's under par flavor, and knowing there is much better out there. The price was certainly right though, I paid 14bucks for a 12pack of this beer, which was definitely worth it. This beer offers traditional IPA flavors/aromas on a budget, with some decent bitterness in the flavor which I really liked, decent hop fix when low on cash, otherwise Id look elsewhere."
"Taste follows with light citrus and grain. No real hop spice/bite here. Feel is easy but watery to a degree. Bitterness is minimal even though there is little sense of much residual sugars. Seems highly attenuated for an IPA, and especially from Redhook. Drinkability is OK by way of its very nonchalance. It doesn't push me away, but there won't be a second date either."
"This is the beer that might make me like IPA. The beer has a hoppy flowery aroma which seems to be characteristic all across IPAs, and vaguely like grass. Taste is very hoppy and bitter, but it isn't too overwhelming which made me go for another since it came in a mixed 12."
"Drinkaility - I would definitely have another in a pinch, but probably wouldn't buy it at the store with so many other good IPA options out there."
"Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. Would love to make a session beer out of this one. But at 6.5 ABV you would have to be carefull."
"How is this considered an IPA? I was working on an IPA gift basket and there was definately one that didn't quite fit. Thin head, not much lacing. Understated floral citrus and pine smell. This doesn't really taste bad, but It's not an IPA by any understanding I have of the deffinition. A regular APA is much more hoppy and full bodied than this. I'm not sure what category it falls into, but they put the wrong label on the bottle."
"Pours a nice mid-copper color with a bit of nice initial head, but no lacing to speak of. Nice floral scent, but a bit weak, and nothing beyond that. Very floral/slight citrusy hoppy flavor, but no real malt body to back it up, not even at a 6.5% ABV; just rather weak bodied, like hop water. Goes down smooth, but so does water."
"drinkability - very easy drinking - this is a pounder session ipa"
"Still however, if you can appreciate an IPA, give this a try. Who knows you might enjoy it. Always try a beer once IMO!"
"D: There are so many other IPAs that deserve a drink before this one. Good to try, but I wouldn't become a frequent drinker of Long Hammer."
"Redhook is a member of the Craft Brewer's Alliance which is close to becoming a major brewing conglomerate. Perhaps this explains why they'd have a kiosk at the stadium. In any case I was glad to have decent ale to drink at the game."
"D - Ok drinkability, I thought the strength of this brew was it's mouthfeel. For the hopheads out there, probably not the best brew, but for those exploring the realm of IPA's this is a good place to start."
"I poured this out to reveal a golden and rather boring color, think macro lager. The aromas were not there, and neither was the head. Just a hint of pine could be detected. The flavor was, ""This is the most boring IPA I have ever had."" That was all I could think about while I drank this. Sure it was bitter, but even that wasn't interesting. It even tasted rather watered down. The hops were very unrefined. I would not consider this an IPA. Redhook has been an incredible disappointment. Given its bland and unremarkable nature, it is easy to chug, which is laughable for an IPA."
"D- Drinkable as any beer on tap but... it an ipa!"
"I'm a college kid. In an ideal world for me, this beer would replace natural light in beer pong games. Not as much complexity or hoppiness as I would prefer, but light enough to slam about a million of them. Kind of like a good beer for drinking games."
"Other than the times in which the harshness substitutes for flavor I don't have a lot of problems with this beer. Drinks well and holds several appealing flavors."
"D. Not much smell or flavor. Not a bad IPA for what is acutally there. An ok beer."
"Got this one in a bar hoping it would be a pleasant surprise, but alas: it poured a pale yellow color, no head, no lacing. Smelled lightly of hops, and tasted lightly of hops, sort of on the border between pale ale and IPA. Would have made for a nice pale ale, actually, but not much happening in the hops department. Drinkable but not too impressive."
"D- Being fairly light this is a beer that I could easily have many of with no problem. Overall I came into this expecting it to be not nearly as good as some other IPAs and that was the case, but this is a fairly inexpensive beer at 8 dollars a 6 pack or ~1.33 a bottle so for being a inexpensive IPA, I don't mind drinking it as a casual beer. Plus the local brewery is really cool and their food is awesome."
"Pours a pale amber color with frothy white head, decent retention and lacing. Extremely pale scent, reminicent of a macro adjunct with only a hint of hops. Taste is somewhat dirty, like stale earthy hops, only a faint hint of pine resin, big bitter bite. Unusually sweet and somewhat buttery cracker taste on the back end. Thin, under carbonated, lasting bitter aftertaste. Mediocre IPA without much hop presence and some off notes."
"c+"
"Taste is bitter, hoppy and sweet. Very smooth and drinkable but not too complex for an ipa. decent beer and better on draft than a bottle."
"Libation: I think this would be a good ""gateway"" IPA for people moving from adjunct lagers to craft beers. Good for the price, and better that expected, very drinkable for a beer, but not my favorite IPA out there."
"I just believe this is one of those beers that is trying to be a hop bomb. But, like all wanna be circle hangers, imitation merely masks the fact that there is no depth beyond that superficial commonality."
"drinkability: overall a below avg IPA"
"The color is very glassy and pale amber. The head is decent with a bit of lacing. The aroma is light with hops and a little banana. But not much citrus and certainly no bread. Upfront there is a moderate amount of bitterness. There is a bit of sweetness under it all. In the back is more generic hops. Again, no real citrus or bread. There is nothing wrong with this brew, but also very little is right. A decent session IPA."
"Nonetheless, try this when you get a chance--alongside some other IPAs it'll likely make their good qualities shine through. Long Hammer is a relatively mundane West Coast IPA that I'll probably end up trying again sometime....like when the rest of the beers in my fridge disappear."
"Drinkability: I think this is a perfectly decent sessionable IPA and wouldn't mind having a few."
"Personally: I will put it to you like this, I was at a ACDC concert recently and my choices were Amstel Light, Heineken, Miller Lite and this. Good IPA that certainly tastes much better than macro-pilsners."
"This is your standard ""generic"" IPA that can be bought at any local grocery store. Treat it as such, and don't expect anything amazing."
"Light pale malt aroma with a faint lemony hop zing. Starts off grainy, with light hop bitterness. Hops are more tangy than citrusy, but a wisp of lemon comes through, mostly from the aroma. Grainy flavor lasts through the finish, which has a hint of alcohol. Pale malt tastes husky and unrefined. Mouthfeel is fairly thin with prickly carbonation. Pretty disappointing, even at a cheap price."
"D: A super drinkable IPA to me, but I'm not a hop head. But still, I like it a lot."
"D- This could be a drinkable beer if I were to get something else in my system first. This is a terrible try at a style that has already enough bad versions of it. I would pass on this again if I had the chance!"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle from the Portsmouth NH brewery marked 051909. Sampled on September 25, 2009. It pours more orange-amber than anything else with a slight haze and a nice foamy white head. The aroma is uniquely floral more than hoppy. Maybe there is a vague yeast scent in there too. The mouthfeel is about medium. The hops are way more evident in the taste than in the aroma, which makes it kind of nice."
"D - Pretty decent session beer but this should be labeled a Pale Ale vs. a traditional IPA"
"Only reason i'm giving this a 4.0 drinkability is it went down easy, and could be a good transition beer for the macro drinkers. Got me buzzed... but made me crave a real IPA!"
"This is not a true IPA"
"Poured a dark yellow with a one finger head that quickly dissipated to a splotchy skin. The aroma was slightly citrus. The taste was mildly citrus too. The feel was light bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. Not bad, definitely not overstated. A respectable effort from Red Hook."
"You can quaff this easily because of its light character."
"D - This is definitely not my favorite IPA...it wouldn't be too bad if there was some balance to the beer...if I needed hops I would go back...but only if I had to"
"Drinkability is fine, but it drinks like a high(er) ABV APA. This beer seems a little confused."
"Drinkability: This is one of those beers that I prefer in the bottle, simply because I expect less that way. When subjected to scrutiny of any kind, this doesnt hold up. However, for drinking at a cookout or something, this stuff is fine, plus its pretty cheap."
"Overall, I would drink this stuff again but I would probably not but it unless I found it at a place that I didnt expect to find any decent brews (i.e. gas station or small town grocery store)."
"Although this is a pretty standard tasting and bodied ipa I find myself liking it as its departs from the high heady flavors of strong ipas and gives you a sort of easy drinking taste that makes it a good beer for a hot day or just a thirsty one. Good drinkability and light flavor make this a good starter ipa. Not a bad beer or a great one, but good enough."
"Basically, imagine the ESB with more hops. The pine smell/taste is just about all they impart. They add bitterness and standard aroma, but little complexity and few other flavors. This is a drinkable beer and nice on a hot day, but nothing to go out of one's way for. Many other better IPAs exist, and at equal or lesser prices as well. However, it could be a good introduction to the style for those accustomed to less hoppy beers."
"Taste was basically an IPA light. Mouthfeel was also similar. Drinkability would be ""higher"" to people who don't really go for IPA's, I guess...its just an IPA starter. Try it out, it isn't bad..but not the greatest IPA"
"Fairly lightweight IPA. You could call it a good intro to the style. Not bad, I've just had better."
"D-Weak IPA, drinkable but not memorable."
"This beer is a big disapointmet. I was hoping to really like it and give it a great score, i really was. I root for the underdog what cn i say, and i love it when i like a beer that gets bagged on. But this one sucks. Its not horrible tasting, its just bland."
"Mouthfeel: Did I just drink air? Way too thin of a mouthfeel."
"On tap at Rockafella's in Salem center. Served in a standard pint glass. Yellow color with a hint of amber, minimal head. Average looking. Smelled hoppy and a the taste was certainly full of hops. Not overly hopped, but just enough to make its presence known. If you are looking for a full fledged IPA, this may be a bit boring. I found it mild enough to be enjoyable. Didn't want more than one, but had no problem enjoying one on a warm afternoon on a bar patio."
"This is a quaffable beer, light and average in the American IPA style. A good session beer!"
"Less than what I expect from an IPA."
"D - It might take me a while to finish this beer off since the bitterness keeps slapping me in the face but its a mediocre IPA. A better offering from Red Hook than the Sunrye at least."
"D- Worth trying, but not worth buying. Doesn't hold up against the big boys."
"Drinkability -- Also very nice. Although it falls short as an IPA, it is still a nice beer to drink. Very smooth and refreshing, along with a decent ABV. To an IPA devote', I expect it would be a disappointment. However, it could be a nice ""transition"" beer for one looking to move away from BMC offerings in small steps."
"Drinkability: You'd probably have to pay me to drink this again. I would not say this is even worth a try, especially if you really like IPAs -- it'll just ruin your impressions of the style."
"There is really nothing I like about this beer. It's not the worst in the world but i really wouldn't call it an ipa. Maybe more of an apa but even at that it's not worth getting. Any craft beer in the pale or amber category would be preferable over this. Appearance and smell is fine, just doesn't stand out in any other way."
"D: Sure, you can drink it... it goes down easy. But it doesn't have a whole lot in taste or anything else, either. As drinkable as water is not something I'm looking for in a beer, let alone an IPA. More of an IPA experience than, say, Alexander Keith's... but not much."
"This beer is not an IPA by any means, at least the bottle I got. Rogue bad bottle or old beer maybe, but I'm just reporting what was in my glass. It would be generous to even call this beer a pale ale. It is more along the lines of a blonde ale if anything. It is possible I had a bad bottle, but from what I have been hearing that is probably not the case. This beer needs more of everything. It needs more malt, a lot more malt, and tons more hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness to qualify for an IPA in my eyes. I am not impressed at all. Although the beer is drinkable and does not taste bad. It just lets you down if your a hop head seeking out a good IPA."
"Appearance is light amber and generously carbonated. Lots of floral hops in the nose. Taste is clean and crisp with a pretty good dose of hops. Decent mouthfeel, without any alcohol burn. Very drinkable. I prefer DIPA, but this is my guilty pleasure, fairly mass-produced IPA. Especially yummy in the summer."
"D: A decent mouthfeel and taste combo makes the beer easy to drink. I was hoping for a bit more hop presence to really balance out the sweeter malts. Still, pretty good beer overall."
"Dissapointing for the style, but not bad I guess for a $9 12 pack."
"D- The good part of this beer is that it is drinkable. It's not overpowering and is a good beer to have if you feel like drinking a few."
"In all, it was good to try once try but not exactly what I'd expect from an IPA."
"I haven't had it lately, but I remember it being a step up from most IPAs"
"This beer pours a clear straw yellow, a one finger white head to it. Not much head retention or lacing to speak of. Nose is rather muted, there are some mild citrus hops mixed with a touch of graininess in the nose. Taste was more than I expected. Citrus hops up front, mostly of grapfruit with some mild malts mixed in, a touch of breadiness mutes the hops. Lighter bodied, medium carbonation. This beer goes down very easily, not a great representation of it's style - definitely won't stand up for those looking for a hop burst, but a nice alternative to typical bar BMC offerings."
"One way to characterize this beer is as a food-friendly IPA. For this alone I give it a very approving nod. My guess is when the big-hops fad has quelled a bit, this type of beer will stand out as an example (though not the exemplar) of a beer that pairs well with actual food people would eat at a meal. The usual line about a big IPA ""going well with spicy food"" is just plain dumb; a big IPA can really only stand alone -- pairing it with loud food only gives your mouth too much to deal with. But Long Hammer would even be great in a Welsh rarebit -- the cheddar would shine right through it."
"Overall, I was not at all impressed with this beer. It is very simple, well, boring."
"I had been pleasantly surprised to see any IPA on tap at a real craphole of a bar, so for these very specific circumstances, it sufficed."
"Although it did not cost a lot, Im still upset I wasted money on this since its very watery. I would definitely skip on this one if I were you."
"Hop lovers steer clear."
"Long Hammer missed it's mark."
"This may not be an exceptional beer, but it's such a good beer that I don't think it receives enough credit. It's not particularly hoppy, but is has a tingly bitterness and enough mouthfeel to be a reliable standby that compliments most food and makes a wonderful summer ale. It's a fine stepping-stone into the IPA world, better out of the tap but solid out of the bottle."
"I have had this brew quite a few times now, always after it was on sale at the liquor store ... deep down I like to think that this IPA would be dramatically tastier if it was in a keg and recently tapped or just fresher in general out of the bottle after having been sent right from the brewery; however, that said, I have yet to be let down by this always delicious beer. From what I can tell, it may true that this is a muted version of an IPA but it has been a proven performer well worth it's price in my book."
"It is nothing exciting or complex and it is really quite sweet, but it is overall a decent beer with some fairly good flavour and I enjoy it but it is hardly great beer."
"Cheers!"
"Picked this up at a local grocery store to try while grilling out. It poured a light amber, a lighter color than I have seen from most IPAs. I got a decent hop smell. It poured with a nice head and left solid lacing on the glass. My first taste I got a strong hop flavor but after that it seemed to fizzle out as I drank it. It seemed to get more watery. Not a bad beer and it was a good choice to have with food, but it almost seems like a lighter version of an IPA."
"Sure, the head isn't fantastic and the smell won't blow your socks off, but the taste is there, mouthfeel is good and drinkability is a quaffer. When I drink this brew, it just reminds me of a slightly stronger aroma hopped version of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale... which certainly isn't a bad thing. I think the only thing that's holding this beer's ratings back (aside from beer snobbery) is that it represents itself as an IPA instead of an APA. Put this in the APA catagory and there won't be many that outrank it."
"Drinkability: Its drinakble but this one wont make the list of my go to IPA's. maybe I was just a bit spoiled by IPA's like Stone,Southern Tier Brewery, and things like Hop Devil from Victory,Smuttynose,Rogue,etc...I guess thats just what I expect to be comparing other IPA's to. This was just not anywhere near that league.."
"D - High, only because it's really thin body and light IPA flavor. Way overpriced at $5 a draft at the Elbo Room (Albany, NY) by the way."
"I'd drink it again, but it would have to be on special and the only IPA available."
"D- I don't want to finish this one.... I don't know what this beer is but it sure ain't an IPA."
"It's an IPA lite, but cranking up the hops on this one and giving it a little more time and you could potentially have something really interesting."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Shows a nice amber in color, with a thick head and decent lacing and retention. Smell is of citrus like elements, a bit grassy and reserved, with a bit of malt spice. Up front, this beer has balancing issues. Too much malt like breadiness takes the hop profile and shoves it aside, I would have liked more zing from the hops but I was dissapointed. Mouthfeel is carbonated and slick, again, bitterness is low due to more malt being present. Overall, I would consider this more of a Pale then an IPA, IPA's should be balanced but still have a decadent like hop profile, and this one falls way short of that. I like Red Hook but hopefully they tweak this to show more of the hops and less of the weak malt flavoring that completely throws this brew out of sync."
"not gonna drink this again, enjoyed trying it but wasn't worth $4.50 a glass or $1.50 for that matter, oh well now i know"
"This is fine if you want something better than some big name American brews, but don't be fooled. Pass this up if you're looking for an actual IPA."
"Drinkablility: I could drink many of these. A good hop presence for an IPA that isn't too dominating. Nice tasty hops without being too extravagant."
"D: Easy on the eyes and easy on the palate this beer is quite nice for the style. It's one of my favorites from Redhook. I am not a huge hophead so a hardcore hop fan would be dissapointed with this IPA."
"D - One of the cleaner IPAs. This would be a good beer to introduce someone who is turned off by more assertive IPAs to the style."
"Not a bad beer, drinkable, but about as mediocre a brew as I have ever tried. The only thing that rose above average was the smell, which was pretty good. Otherwise, middle-of-the-road all 'round. A beer to look for in wastelands of good taste."
"I've also drunk bottled Long Hammer and found it to be among the more palatable of the inexpensive, widely distributed IPAs. The abundance of low reviews here is puzzling, as this is a perfectly fine ale. In addition, it's available everywhere, often at favorable prices."
"Anyway, I'm a little dismayed that it's in the C's, but really, most of us are quite honest, and on this site, C+ is 'ok'. 'B' is Good, and A is outstanding. I heard some people recently lumping red hook in with the coors/bud thing. Well anything Anheuser-Busch. Anheuser-Busch owns 25% of redhook... probably more as an investment, diversification and a 'toe in' to what they probably knew was going to be a big area. And they don't have any say. Redhook is one of the pioneers in the craft brew movement, and they should be respected for that. They've been a successful pioneer because they're still accessible. They're like a Sam Adams in that sense. Red Hook was the first beer I had where I went, 'wow, I like this, why doesn't all beer taste this good'. So perhaps I'm a little biased ;-)"
"12oz. bottled served in a willibecker. Bottled on 02/09/09 stamped on the label. Poured a golden orange with excellent clarity and a one inch frothy, bright white cap. Head eventually recedes into a thin slick with tiny ringlets and a band around the edges of the glass. Copious tiny bubbles evident in solution. Nose reveals piny hops and some citrus qualities. Taste is consistent with nose, but is much more subdued than suggested by the aromas and finish is a little too clean for the style - not much hops presence lingers, but a bit of wheat comes out at the back. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and mildly effervescent. Somewhat bland for the style, fairly easy drinking, but a little too under-hopped."
"Not bad but more like a rubber mallet than a hammer."
"Had this one at Marbar in Philly. Probably stale, with a very metallic smell. Not too much head though what was of it stuck around. The taste was pretty dry and not as bitter as I like my IPA's. Pretty weak taste overall, even watery. Probably trying to appeal to people who really shouldn't be drinking an IPA. Not for anyone who can handle the strength of Dogfish 90min. Not awful, just not for the serious."
"D - If they would have billed this as something other than an IPA, I would have been more receptive, but as an IPA, this is not a good representation of the style"
"This beer is below average for the style. I pours a deep golden color and is strikingly clear with a persistent white head. There is a heavy bit of carbonation that pushes the ""C" hops to the nose. At this point the beer seems like its going to be a nice IPA. Then you taste it. It hits the tongue with a carbonic bite falling to a flat maltiness and finally finishes with a slightly astringent note. Overrall not really worth buying when considering the other IPA's available."
"Drinkability: As a beer over allI would probably give this a C+, B-. This is way too light for an American IPA. With an American IPA, I expect some bite--not neccessarily a hop bomb, but some hops. I would drink this beer as a lawnmower beer, but just not if I am looking for an IPA"
"nonetheless, from this bottle, i have to say, nice, good, a notch above average for sure, recommended if you want a certain, american take on the IPA. remember, i dream of hop-creatures in mosh pits. this isn't a punk, but rather an edgey new waver...;)"
"Wow, this was one of the few beers that I've had where I think the cask conditioning actually hurt it. It was just WAY too light in mouth and the flavors at times barely got this out of Pale Ale territory. Not a very good IPA."
"Overall- one of the worst IPAs I've had, Red Hook's other beers have been alright but this one needs to be reformulated. Not worth your time or money."
"Pours Golden color. 1 finger head, that dissipated quickly. Smells wonderfully hoppy and clean. Has a good medium mouthfeel. Has a pretty clean taste too it and has some bitterness, but really not all that bitter, i expected a bit more out of an IPA. I like it, but then again im just now getting into IPAs and im still not loving overly hopped beers. Even with that I thought i would be getting a bit more out of this one...but still has a good flavor, just not too much going on here. I am abit suprised to see the abv on this is 6.5% though, feels much less."
"Drinkability: As an India Pale Ale, it's very basic, very average, but not very memorable."
"Verdict: Shallow, bland, and watery, Long Hammer disappoints at every turn. This would be weak even for a Pale Ale, let alone a full-blown IPA. Shame on Redhook for misusing the IPA label so badly."
"D: Nice, balanced IPA. Good session beer, not overwhelming."
"D- Well, if the price were right I could have had quite a few more even though I was not overly impressed. Will go for another one again somewhere else if I come across it."
"D - I could drink this one, but it wouldn't be something I would buy again. Needs a more distinct flavor, hard to tel where they were going with it."
"D - No thanks. Missing out on the bold hop flavors that define the style. Would not buy this beer again and if you're a potential trading partner, please don't include it as an extra ;-)"
"Weak sauce. Tastes like a good IPA that got diluted by a lot of water- like a light beer that tried to be hoppy. The only redeemable quality is the nose, but that's quickly forgotten about because the aftertaste stays with you for a long time, and it's gross. It will take me quite a while to work my way through the six. Overall, its an embarrassment to the style."
"M/D: Carbonation was average. The beer was light and had a average dry bitter aftertaste to it. Overall, the beer is decent. I would not call it one of my go to beers, but I will probably pick it up again or order it when I am out, but not my first choice."
"I didn't really want to finish my first one of these, and wouldn't get another one."
"This one is simply weak. Not awful. Nothing bad. Nothing funky. but nothing good. Really doesn't fit superbly into the IPA category (hence some of the low rating)... it feels stuck somewhere between an APA and an ESB... which can be a depressing place if you think you're an IPA."
"Drinkability: A nice introduction to IPA to the BMC folks, but there are much better examples of the style out there."
"Overall the taste is nice but isn't any hoppier than many american pale ales like SNPA. Redhook really nailed the winter warmer and ESB and I'd rather go with them on those styles and pick up a better representation of IPA from another brewer."
"Very drinkable beer. Very light, very crisp, very pleasant to drink."
"D-A fine IPA. Certainly nothing near the best, but since this brew seems to be widely available at many restaurants and bars, at least one can have a shot at something moderately hoppy."
"This is a pretty bad beer, it tastes like what BMC would do if they made an IPA, oh wait... that's what it is."
"Good mouthfeel and definitely good marks for drinkability. I am enjoying IPA's more and more, and Redhook is one that I definitely want more of."
"D: Smooth, but more of a watered-down IPA than anything... like IPA for beginners to the style, to ease them in. I prefer mine more intense."
"This IPA has a nice bite to it; real quality IPA. It also has a hint of fruit to it. To be honest, nothing really stands out about it, but just really solid."
"The mouthfeel was thin and watery. Drinkable, if you can handle the sweetness."
"Lightly colored, arguably more yellow than orange, easily transparent, thin white head disappears almost as soon as it's poured. Orange citrus, sweet spices, non-aggressive hops and honey driven nose, has good lift in the nostrils but lack of clear palette of scents makes it appear too airy, smells like ""beer."" Medium-bodied, on the sweet side yet inoffensively so, steadily dries out towards the finish. Malty with that same touch of honey, glazed orange and lemon citrus. At times tastes more like a sweeter pilsner than IPA. Pretty damn smooth, no problem gliding through the mouth. Carbonation too high for the overall mouth weight, disperses things. Inoffensive."
"Very big head, off-white(yellowish) frothy, big bubbles, good lacing. Clearish yellowish appearance-very clear. Very bitter aroma. Bitter taste, but not too much. Smooth, acidic bitter aftertaste."
"Very light in color; more of a yellow than a gold. Nice citrusy smell. Seems like it has a fairly wide distribution so I'm glad about that, because although it's not a great IPA, it's far superior to the buds and coors typical of most bars in the USA. The taste is nice, and as my boy SwiftyMcBeer stated, it's a nice introduction for people that are used to drinking the mass-produced water-like beer. It is extremely drinkable and I was surprised by the alcohol content."
"D - Solid, drinkable IPA. The orangey flavour is interesting, giving a nice, clean but fruity flavour."
"Pours a clear gold with a medium white head that settles into a soapy film. Smells of orangey and piney hops with a honeyish sweetness in the background. Taste is completely unexpected: none of the hoppy kapow I was anticipating. Oh there are hops, to be sure, but Long Hammer has more of simple sweetness than anything else, but not in a terribly complicated or interesting way. Hops finally come out to express themselves on the finish but I wish they'd made a stronger showing on the palate. Body is fine; drinkability is so-so an account of its taste not living up to the style."
"Good flavor, good atmosphere. Hops are really sharp, so this may not be a favorite if you're not a hophead. I am, and this is a pretty decent quaff."
"Golden color with a thin head. This smells a little weak and that carries over into the taste. It's like someone took a hop-bomb and cut it with Miller lite or something. That isn't doing this beer justice though, because it isn't miller lite, it's better then that, just not by a ton. It is an extremely drinkable IPA and you could do a lot worse on a summers day out by the lake. A good value beer and maybe a way to introduce some swill drinkers to something with a touch more care put into it."
"D- Decent IPA, very drinkable. In no way is this a hop-bomb."
"M + D: Body is fine... carbonation is pretty good, body is a standard medium. Unfortunately, it falls a bit short both in style and in general. Drinkability isn't a huge issue... more of a matter of why."
"taste is a tad watery, light grapefruit, some caramel, a little pine, and hops, ends bitter and a tad sweet, becomes more watery as it warms."
"Drinkability: Being that it isn't that big I guess you could pound a bunch of em but who wants to do that anyways. Can't say that I dislike it as much as a lot of other people so I would say give it a shot it might be a good intro beer."
"Very drinkable, good session ale."
"I know it seems strange, but I love the Belgian qualities I get in this. It took me a while to put my finger on it, but it gets more pronounced every sip I take. I really like this one. I'm a fan!"
"No head at all with little to no lacing. But it is very drinkable and has just the right amount of carbonation for my taste. A very good standard and basic west coast Ale.. whether a pale, or IPA... call it what you will... or what they do anyway."
"Fairly drinkable."
"M&D- Sorta slick and oily but overall pretty resfreshing and easy to drink for 6.5%ABV"
"D: I like the on-tap version far more than the bottle -- especially when it is poured to 16oz mark. It went very well with piping hot sausage pizza."
"Looks like about an IPA should, maybe a bit darker than to be expected, but good color. Foamy white head with a light lacing. Smells citrusy ,a bit of hops, but not a real strong smelling beer. Tastes similar, citrus with some hops bitterness to finish. A bit thin in my opinion, and that seems to be the norm for Red Hook beers. Overall this isnt a bad IPA, if it can be called that. Its one of the first IPA's I have had so I can't really compare it to much. I may re-review this after some further 'research' into IPA's."
"Conclusion: It's not a terrible brew, but it's not fantastic either."
"At first pouring very disappointed. Weak frosting and watery apperance. Aroma not full with light fullness, not expected from an IPA. The Pale Ale I had previously presented much better. But don't sell this ale short. Has good drinkability with a nice bitter hop and refreshing feel on the tongue. This guy is much better than its rating."
"(rated Aug 17, 2008)"
"Pours a clear, golden/pale tea color with a lingering, slightly off-white head that leaves some light lacing. The aroma and flavor indicate a fresh, floral, grapefruit, and light pine hop presence. There is also a bit of toasty caramel malt in the flavor. The bitterness level is mild to moderate; just enough to make this beer interesting. The only downsides are that the body seems a bit thin and watery from time to time and there is also a tinge of a metallic edge in the finish sometimes. Pretty good,suprised it was rated so low"
"A blandly bitter IPA. There are some citric-pine hops in the aroma, but very little hop richness comes through in the flavor. The beer looks alright, golden with a rocky off-white head. The aroma is long on hops but you can tell that things are out of whack. Malt contributes very little to the nose. This beer is in dire need of stronger, richer malt flavors. I don't know if it's the lack of malt or a problem with the hops, but the hops also lack richness and depth. They have some bitter citric flavor, but the bitterness overwhelms their richer qualities. This is not to say that there is no sweetness. In fact, there is some syrupy sweetness but it only makes the feel somewhat cloying rather than adding depth to the beer. The mouthfeel is somewhat astringent. I like a strongly bitter hop kick, but it needs hop richness to balance it out. This beer overemphasizes this bitterness with far too little balancing sweetness. Not a horrible IPA, but not a good one."
"What happened to the old Redhook IPA that was actually good? I know this site says this is just a pseudonym for ""Redhook IPA."" I've had the ""Redhook IPA"" and this is not ""Redhook IPA," sir."
"This IPA isn't particularly remarkable, but it certainly stands up as a strong session IPA. It could be a little more balanced, but it's easy to drink and still quite enjoyable."
"This is a beer that the brewmaster fogot ingredients too. Could be very good, but needs more HOPS. The flavor would be a great balance, just isn't getting that opportunity."
"Pours a golden orange with a tall head of bleach white bubbles,nothing special. The nose is citrusy and floral,understated. Flavors are subtle grapefruit and a touch of pine,needs another heaping pile of hops thrown in to be something better than average,which it is, barely. Light bodied and fizzy,it really lacks that creamy feel that you get from a quality IPA. I'm probably being a little too critical, just an average beer."
"Had this beer for the 1st time tonight. Bought a sixer on sale. After the pour into a pint glass, produced a descent, orange amber color, nothing to write home about with a 1"" rocky head that left heavy sheets of lacing as I drink. Smell was the best asset of this beer. Citrusy and hoppy. Very good smelling. Taste was very dissapointing. Wasn't quite what it smelled like. A little dull for an IPA. You can taste the pine, but the crispness wasn't there. Mouthfeel was right up there with taste. Well I guess it was down there. Just average. This is a pretty good session beer. It goes down pretty good."
"D= pretty respectable if you are working your way up to some more full flavored beers. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that the flavor was so muted for an ipa..."
"Long Hammer is by no means a bad beer, in fact it is quite the opposite. The reason for the low score is in the fact that Red Hook decided to name it an IPA. Call it a Pale and it would get way higher reviews..."
"o:a good entry ipa. i know that redhook is trying to get cross-over customers so i cant fault them with the low bittering hops. i can see this kind of beer getting people hooked on hop aroma and flavor without the initial shock of the bitterness. i wouldnt buy this beer except, like today, when im eating and its the only non-macro on tap."
"Do yourself a favor get something else with your $7.50. I would even call the Budweiser American Ale better than this."
"Pours clear gold with a smallish head. Nice lacing though. Not much aroma- just some herbal hops. Taste is pretty average. A bit of malt sweetness and character. Not a lot of hop flavor complexity. Medium to perhaps a bit light bodied. Moderately carbonated. Pretty drinkable. Not bad overall just unexciting."
"It has a light bronze almost brass colored body. It ahs a little bit of off white head and nice lace. It has a very floral bitter grassy aroma with fruity and herbal tones. It crisp and bitter but not sour as some mass produced IPA's tend to be. It has some fruity sweetness. It is not a hopheads dream but I thought it was alright. Light with some bite to it."
"D -- Not easy to drink. Took a lot to swallow this beer. Won't be indulging again."
"I've had this in a bottle numerous times because I have friends who find humor in the name. I was never impressed to tell the truth. I had it on draft for the first time recently, and while better than the bottled product, I still found it to lacking the essential hops presence even the most minimal IPA should carry. The aroma and flavor were muted rather than explosive. I didn't get much hops in any of it, so boo."
"Overall: I could easily see myself going through 6 of these. True, I don't know why they stamped IPA on the bottle but altogether this was a thoroughly enjoyable brew"
"Again, I don't see the complaint here. It's not a home run, but it does get the guy to first."
"This beer deserves more respect than it gets."
"D: Nothing wrong this one if your not looking for a hop bomb or a clear IPA. A mellow quiet fellow to have and the ABV you very difficult to detect if at all. I would chalk this up to a new recipe perhaps or a more delicate and nuanced version of a IPA."
"The taste is not overly complex but it is good. There is a hoppy bitterness, a creaminess, a bready malt backbone, and some citrus notes in the mid section to make it a passable and decent IPA. This is a bit too full bodied to be anything but an IPA, and there is a lingering hop bitterness beyond the finish that seals the deal for me. It is a bit drying in the finish, a pretty sweetish malty beer in the middle, a fairly carbonated beer as well. There is a mouth puckering chewiness in the finish as well. This is a decent beer that I would have again, although this is not a stellar IPA."
"Average mouthfeel."
"The beer flowed from the bottle a yellow-golden color with virtually no foam. The aroma is grainy with a little bit of piny hops. A little thin on the palate. Flavors are mild and malty. It finishes with some pine and citrus hops. Overall not that impressive."
"Kind of an average beer all around. Doesn't really taste totally like an IPA but parts of it do making this just an odd beer overall. It's a pretty high ABV and it does go down smooth for sure. But balance wise and style wise the lines are a little bit blurred and make it hard to judge this beer."
"New label (green and blue), probably new recipe after merger with Widmer - much better than previous bottling. Drank it out of the bottle, so can't comment on appearance. Good hops. Slightly flinty, metallic taste, with a bit of pine, touch of citrus. Some bitterness. Very refreshing. Enjoyable to drink alone or with seafood dinner."
"D: Ones enough, basically an underachiever by style and not 6 pack worthy."
"pretty darn good. probably the best beer at my local bar, next to anchor liberty ale. basically, a very very mild ipa... (very) would not consider it to be ipa, which makes sense because the price is too good to be true. i recommend the beer in general, though if your in the mood for a good ipa, i do not recommend getting this beer."
"I'll say it again: this is a pretty tame IPA. There's certainly some pleasant flavours to it, but it's not the type of IPA I've come to expect - balanced way too much towards sweetness. Hey, it's not a bad beer... But it's not a good IPA either."
"Infact... got an idea for you RedHook!!! Label this a LITE IPA!!! Boom, instant hit in the mass market."
"Tried this beer for the first time not expecting much and thats exactly what I found. Nice hop aroma and even starts off decent (bittering hops). After that there was nothing. No complexity or balance. There are too many good IPAs out there to bother with this subpar brew."
"Overall, not a beer I would recommend nor try again if I had the chance."
"D- not bad to drink. A decent beer for relaxing with but i wouldnt recommend a sixer of it."
"Grabbed a sixer back in Santa Fe. Out of the bottle this one was a golden color with copper highlights. One finger of bone white head, mediocre retention and lacing. The nose was herbal hops, slightly malted and a sweetness like raisins. The flavors were quite average however. Piney hops dominate adding a bitter resin character to the beer. Doesn't have the malt backbone to offset this nor can much be tasted beyond the gradations of hops. The mouthfeel was ok but in general I was sorry I didn't have five more of something else..."
"Pours a nice, bone, one finger head that slinks down to a nice film of foam. Only a scant bubble or two in this very pale light copper with some dark pilsner highlights. The arom is a nice, clean citric splash with some soft toasted malt. Simple yet pretty pleasing. The taste slowly rolls the toasted, faintly biscuit malts over the front of the tongue. The midle begins to show the evolving hop flavors. First bitter flowers in the middle that slowly move to rindy orange peels that linger for a bit after each sip. Not a bad tasting IPA made for some long sea fairng shoe drinking sessions."
"Not bad overall, but certainly wouldn't be my first pick unless there were only BMC available."
"Overall I love IPA's and I used to think this was one of my favs, as I have had a chance to expand my beers I would have to say that this falls a little short..."
"Pours clear gold with a smallish head. Nice lacing though. Not much aroma- just some herbal hops. Taste is pretty average. A bit of malt sweetness and character but mostly dominated by a rather harsh bitterness throughout. Not a lot of hop flavor complexity. Medium to perhaps a bit light bodied. Moderately carbonated. Pretty drinkable. Not bad overall just unexciting."
"D-I dont see me doing much over finishing this one, if i get there."
"Wouldnt buy a 6pk, but would have on with a friend and then go on to tell them how a real IPA should bite me in the ass."
"D. Another very easy drinker from RedHook. High ABV a bit dangerous since this is so easily downed. Paired nice with spicey fried rice."
"Pours gold and turns orange as it settles. Not much head. The smell upon opening the bottle is somewhat promising with an assurance of strong bitterness, which I prefer in an IPA. However the bitterness of this beer overpowers any other intended flavor, and leaves such an unappealing after-taste that I found it difficult to finish."
"Mouth is medium crisp but the taste bothers the finish, I bought a six and will probably let them sit for a while before I finish it off, just a pathetic IPA really."
"1.5	D 6.5 abv a bit excessive for this particular beer. developed severe headache within an hour after finishing-coincidence? it was just one beer!"
"D: This beer did nothing for me. It really didn't seem like an IPA - mainly due to that grassy taste. There are many better examples of this style."
"I enjoyed this brew a lot. I will definitely be picking up more in the near future, despite the fact that the alcohol content and apparent bitterness might stop you from drinking too many in a single sitting."
"Overall, drink a Heineken!"
"Overall: Drinkable but not an AIPA. This has been either a bad day for beers or my memory is rapidly diminishing. I had remembered this as a pretty decent IPA. I was ""in the mood"" for some IPA's today and bought a few singles of ones I had thought to be good in the past. This was strike 2 out of 3. Let's hope the next doesn't let me down..."
"Nothing groundbreaking in terms of an IPA; if not for its fairly elevated hoppiness, I'd almost call it an English IPA or an APA."
"Overall, it is rather drinkable but none too exciting. A little harsh for me, but OK."
"overall, a very drinkable beer, not the best ever but I think better than the reputation it gets here."
"A reddish-orange pour is topped with an off-white head. Retention is adequate. The usual citrus and hop aromas are present, as well as some orange peel and a slightly earthy acidicy. Tastes spicy, malty and lemony with a decent mix of orange and hops throughout. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and it goes down pretty smooth. A tasty yet not overpowering IPA."
"Purchased 12 pack. This is quite good. I was pleasantly surprised. It's got a nice crisp hoppy bite to it but not overpowering so perhaps it could use a touch more flavor. Very smooth. A nice entry level IPA. The gentle sweet bitter hoppiness makes it extremely easy to drink. A good summer selection."
"D: The thinness of this beer betrays the higher than average ABV so it's easy not to think about this when glugging this beer. But this softness on the palate also makes for a very drinkable beer that isn't overpowering and tiring"
"Like other Redhook offerings, this beer is average in all regards. I don't need to describe it in detail. It is the Chevrolet of IPA's. Cheers!"
"It's no Alpha King or Stone, but a drinkable and reasonably priced IPA that is really pretty darn good. At 6.5 % a 6 pk will do, trust me. Overall I think it's really not that bad of a beer. Give it a go when you need to save some cash but still want that IPA flavor, somewhat muted however it's still not that bad."
"Not a bad brew, just slightly better than your average beer and slightly worse than your average IPA."
"This may be a good gateway beer for someone who only drinks light beer (i.e. Bud Light), but I'm not sure this would really appeal to the craft beer drinker. Not a drain pour, but won't be seeking this out again. Glad I only bought one bottle of this."
"An enjoyable brew, and probably my favorite from Red Hook. But the marketing/branding is a slap in the face to beer drinkers."
"APA maybe, IPA...I think not. An ok beer, just not a good example of the style. This one did sit in my beer fridge for 2 months, I remember it being a tad tastier fresh."
"btw, it is hard not to like beer in the middle of an oppressive gulf-coast Louisiana summer."
"I guess these can go down ok, if you are thirsty. Not worth trying again. Fair at best."
"A pretty average IPA, not too hoppy or too malty. Seems like it could be a stepping stone beer for the step from pale ales to higher hop levels."
"This was a great beer for the bargain. My friend lbkornlb14 and I went into our local watering hole to get a snootfull. We are big hopheads and saw long hammer IPA. The kicker was it wasnt popular so the bartender set the price at $1 a PINT. My friend and I went bananas. The color was golden. The aroma was full of nice rich hop smell. The flavor was chock full of bittering hops on the front, smooth on the finish. The mouth feel was great. I dont remember how many we put down that night, but I am glad we went that night."
"I would love to find this beer in a bottle to taste it again. I think the ballpark atmosphere kind of threw me off as I wasn't prepared to make notes of a tasting."
"Drinkability: Good safe beer.... nothing extreme for the hop heads. At $7.99 a sixer it's average in every respect."
"Clean finish, nice hops, would buy again."
"www.theviceblog.com"
"Last time I tried this beer was in 2004 and I was not impressed with the hop levels but I had it again recently on tap and lo and behold the hops were there and I enjoyed the pint. Did the recipe change or is the draft that much better? I will order this again as it is a well made hoppy IPA that is easy to find and well priced."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice pretty golden color but much like any other regular beer. The head was nice anf fluffy and held on pretty well. The lacing was good and held up pretty well also. The taste was a little harsh a little pineapply. I just did not like the taste and will not buy again as this is like the third try."
"Drinkability: Not one of the best, but definitely drinkable. Could it be more of an APA instead of an IPA?"
"Light bodied. Watery."
"Don't drink and review."
"Smooth, somewhat creamy. Nice carbonation, light to medium body. Easy one to drink. Would be a nice session beer on a sunny afternoon."
"D: Being a bit heavy will hurt the drinkability some, as well as (IMO) being at least a little bit outside of the style. 6.5% is decently well hidden."
"The aroma was citrusy and had a hint of pine. The taste was very light for an IPA. Not much malt background and the hop presence was virtually absent. Not very bitter at all. IBU must be low for this one. In the mouth it was thin and didn't leave much of a mark. Overall a very middle of the road IPA."
"Steve"
"Hey, it's a fairly drinkable beer that's just about average for its style. Nothing wrong here, but nothing amazing."
"but it is good"
"i picked up a growler and took it out on the disk golf course, this was reel good when your hot and it had a punch, 6.5 %, i dident know going into the round, by the 15th hole this beer took a hold on me and i couldent throug strate to save my life, on anouther note the flaver was ok, but the middle was just a bit off, maby a little to bitter to fast then nuthing all and all i liked it though"
"Simply put this was O.K."
"It was very drinkable and would have had a second or third but had to move on."
"Drinkability: for an IPA it goes down smooth. Not a whole lot of flavor from any one part of it, but not a bad beer to sip on during the summer months, not what I would consider a true IPA, but it does have a good taste if you're not looking for that big hop flavor."
"If your set on a traditional IPA then pass, otherwise its refreshing and easy to drink."
"Overall this is a below average IPA. Considering nearly anywhere I can get this I could get goose island's IPA I can't imagine ever trying it again or recommending it to anyone. It would be a nice option if it were on tap somewhere with nothing else."
"D: Ship this one. There are likely dozens of better IPA's available in the craft beer market than this one."
"Mouthfeel was grainy, zesty. Some alcohol sizzle in the finish."
"Overall I'd rate this IPA as average, ho-hum. If there was another IPA to choose from for an encore Red Hook wouldn't follow Red Hook. Still I've tasted numerous less satisfying beers than this one."
"This straw-colored brew is probably the lightest IPA I've ever seen, only a shade darker than a BudMilCoors. There's a wave of piney fresh hops in the nose, some grain, but also a hint of butteriness that doesn't belong. Fortunately that faint off-smell is overwhelmed by the bitter hops in the taste. The taste is pleasantly bitter and dominated by the piney hops but it finishes too cleanly and it seems a bit lacking in the malt department. There are better and bigger IPAs but this one's not bad if you're looking for something bitter to pair with food or you want one that won't fill you up."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer, but it's not one that I would say is exceptional. In any case I am surprised at the overall rating it has on here. It has a good flavor, but it is lacking in certain spots. Perhaps it might be better suited to be called an American Pale Ale rather than an IPA. It just doesn't have that over the top aroma and juicy hop flavor that is characteristic of a great IPA. My ratings don't necessarily reflect it compared to other IPAs, because there are certainly many better ones, but moreso as a beer by itself."
"Many, Many better IPA choices in this world that are readily available."
"Pretty easy-drinking... for a non-hophead like me probably easier than your typical ""to-style"" IPA. Pretty mild all the way around."
"D - Not a bad brew, but the watery-ness drops this to average. The taste would keep me coming back, but the mouthfeel is a bit much to overlook."
"This comes out of the tap a pretty transparent golden with a fairly thick, fine-bubbled white head. Aroma is hoppy and slightly fruity. Flavor is strong and quite hoppy, not all that bitter. Texture has something of an edge, but it is not overly rough. Not the best IPA I have had, but worth a try."
"D-Not great but definately drinkable, more APA than IPA to my tastes but still a decent brew."
"Pours a clear golden color with nice amount of foam and long trails of lacing down the glass. Aroma is moderately hoppy for an IPA, with backgrounds of pale malts. Taste is good, but somewhat lacking in depth. Definite hop character, but nothing overly exciting. Good malt backbone, but really wish this one had some stronger hop bitterness to bring it through. Slightly piney, slight tropical fruitiness, but again, nothing exciting. Good mouthfeel, nice carbonation and very easy to drink. An average IPA."
"A bottle left at my house after a poker game, so now it is mine and I'm drinking it. The beer is slightly hazy and yellow-orange colored, thin wispy head. The smell is hops, go figure, not too strong but nice anyway. The taste is good, hops bitterness but not enough lasting hops flavors, it felt kind of 1-dimensional in terms of hops component. Overall not bad, OK with dinner, but not interesting enough to drink by itself in the future."
"Flavor was citrus and pine hops with very little malt to back it up. Dry clean finish. Body is very light, beer is very drinkable. This beer is not really to style and is more like a pale ale than an IPA. A drinkable beer, but very middle of the road for an IPA."
"All and all, not a bad brew to enjoy and relax with."
"pours a slightly cloudy med. gold w/ a decent white head that settles a bit quick leaving a moderate lacing in my nonic ; a moderate smell, some citrus/cattish hops, maybe a hint of cereal grain ; flavor's a bit on the thin side, a moderate hop bite and somewhat metallic up front, a bit of piney hops and minerals come out about midway , finish is dry and a bit metallic ; a med.-light body and moderatly carbonated ; a decent drinking beer, just an avg. Am. IPA though..."
"Overall-a good IPA, I would definitely buy this again"
"Average brown color with a white to light tan head. The nose has some fresh fruity hops, but not much of a malt backbone. The taste is even less complex. Some bitter hops and very pale malt. The body is light and has good carbonation. Drinkable, but not an impressive example of the style."
"That's pretty much what the profile of this is all around with more bittering hops than average.... or like a hoppy cream ale. My scoring pretty much reflects style points. This just doesn't quite fly as an IPA but it's a decent beer."
"This is an okay IPA. Maybe it's just my personal preference but there was something slightly off with the flavor of this one. Oh well, see for yourself."
"Light-bodied, crisp and refreshing. Very drinkable. Go ahead, put the Hammer down. More akin to a traditional APA-style. Nevertheless, considered a decent ""gateway"" IPA."
"There's a dry quick finish to it that leaves the taste of caramel and dry grain husk. I could drink these all day."
"Thin mouthfeel and a touch overcarbonated, this is a drinkable beer, I just wouldn't pick it up again."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean. Seems more of an APA than an IPA. This is a no frills ale. Drinkable, but not very interesting."
"This is an OK beer. IMO"
"Pretty mediocore..."
"This is not the best IPA I've ever had, but as an easily accessible IPA I love it. The color is a golden brown with a very floral nose. As for the taste, it has a very sharp hop bite that finish very cleanly, no questionable after taste. I enjoy it with a meal or on it's own."
"This is my ""can't get to the beer store, so I went to the grocer"" beer - it's quite drinkable, but is really a slightly higher gravity APA at best... enjoy it but realize it's not very indicative of the American IPA style."
"This is a VERY drinkable IPA. There's a bit of pine and the hops will get your attention, but overall a great beer to introduce lawn mover beer lovers to the real world of beer. A great beer that should be found everywhere. Don't get me wrong....if you're not in an ""everywhere"" type O' place, then don't pick this beer. It is not world class, but one of the best that I've found in my big box retailer. Recommend - for sure give this beer a drink. You'll enjoy it as will your friends. Surprising crisp taste. Cheers!"
"I had this on a Redhook Brewery Tour, they were giving the nitro tap a try to see how it took. I had never had a nitro tap IPA before now. The nitro made a sharper tasting beer smooth and creamy. I would say that over all it was a good beer, creamy head, good over all taste and nice finish. I want to go back and give it another sample."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer, and I look forward to this beer in the summer. At 6.5%, this beer will go down very smoothly in the warm weather."
"pours a slightly hazy golden color, quarter in off white head with a hard pour but did leave some lasting lace. strong bitter hops in the nose. slightly oily on the tongue with that hop bitterness and not much else there. good carbonation and mouthfeel but nothing to go with it. not something i would buy again."
"Drinkability - Nope, not again. Had the makings of a nice hoppy offering, but failed to maintain any depth that might have been contributed by the least bit of malt to provide balance. Exceedingly out of balance, at least for my taste."
"D - Very solid brew IMO. I could easily drink a few in a sitting. Recommended."
"The sour finish almost had me dump this one near the end but I perciveered and finished it. I will not be having it again."
"It was a refreshing beer. If your looking for a Hop Bomb, this is not your beer, if you want a fair representation of a Midlle of the road American IPA , well here ya go..."
"D - the drinkibility on this beer is amazing. Its bitter, however not too bitter making it a very good session beer. It is extremely refreshing as well. With the summer months coming this is one to crack while lying on the beach or a hammuk under a shade tree. I highly reccomend this for people just getting into the IPA style."
"Drinkability: Overall not bad. I could have a few pints of this. Easy-going and went well with a Reuben."
"12oz bottle dated 12-11-07 poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear orangish copper color with a white head. The aroma is extremely faint for an IPA, with just a touch of malt and citrusy hops. The taste is a touch of sweet malt up front, with a little more hops appearing in the finish compared to the aroma, but it is still subdued for an IPA. Overall, this is more of a pale ale than an IPA, not bad, but it does not stand up against most of the other IPAs out there."
"Mouthfeel is average, body is thinnish."
"This is better than I remember it being. It's not great, but good."
"Pretty much your average American IPA. Poured a nice golden body with a half-inch head. Smell was of grain, hops, sugar, and straw. Tasted like a nice, well-balanced IPA with a lot of nice, juicy, hop flavor. Carbonation was average. I'm surprised at such a nice quality of beer from a large producer, and it's a good quality for being available alongside the BCM at the supermarket. This is my go-to beer when I can't get to a specialty beer store."
"D: Very easy to drink. A good beer, perhaps just miscategorized."
"This poured a clear pale amber with a little white head. It smelled like a mix of strong citrus and pine hops with some malt. It tasted mostly typical with nice mostly pine hops flavor and some malt. It was surprisingly thick with little carbonation and a sweet/bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a good clean beer, better than I expected."
"Some people might be taken back by the absence of the bitterness in this IPA. It is too strong and bitter to be a pale ale. But, if you are looking for balance... look no further."
"Overall I could drink a million of these. Very drinkable. For what this is, a session IPA for less money than most others, it succeeds remarkably."
"Verdict: A smooth, hoppy IPA that is simple in nature but satisfying. Could be a bit more balance but still very drinkable."
"Not one I would try again. With all the good IPAs out there, it makes you wonder why a place would feature this as their only IPA."
"I have two more of these left and will enjoy them. Not the best IPA I've ever had, but it was nice to ty a new one."
"Had a nice orangish golden hue with a decent head that retained itself quite well. A very light hop presence in the smell, but I think I detected some earth tones and some mild citrus. A rather light hoppy taste, at that, with some barely noticeable citric notes. Medium bodied at best, there really isn't much in here, yet alone would I consider this an IPA. It made for a nice beer to try, and I'm not saying it is bad, but if you want a real IPA you shouldn't bother trying this."
"D - Good drinkability...not too shabby."
"D - Good here. Very sessionable beer with nice rounded taste. ABV at 6.5% is not noticable, very nice and flavorful."
"A nice amber in appearance, no cloudiness, having a thick head with good lace. Smell is hoppy, citrusy, but light in aroma. Taste has the hops, grapefruit and a light sweetness in the malt, which also seems on the light side. Mouthfeel is smooth, but light for an IPA with crisp carbonation. Certianly nothing to get excited over for true IPA lovers."
"Drinkability is fair, this feels more like a lightly hopped pale ale than an IPA, some decent balance and easy-drinking, but nothing too exciting going on here"
"Drinkability - will pass on this next time, nothing special, hops seemed to go bad in the middle of the tasting from ripe to rotten"
"Tastes citrus hoppy and supporting malt sweet. Hops are more grassy than bitter, but both are present. Pith, oranges, and piney. Touch of sour or acid sting which combines with the carbonic sting. Nice enjoyable. Not a stunninglyu complex beer, but well done. Md-light body and md-heavy carbonation."
"Had a few of these a friend gave to me and I drank straight from the bottle so not much I can say about appearance. Smell was somewhat off, had a skunky/ bad hop smell, if that is possible. Taste is ok, really didnt mind it somewhat malty, good amount of hops. A nice bitterness to it. It is somewhat watery, carbonation is fine but a very light mouthfeel. Overall not a bad beer, not great. Other than the smell I'd say I'd recommend it, just dont expect too much."
"Overall a disappointing IPA for sure."
"D- Ehhh, if you are in a pinch its drinkable otherwise steer clear of this sad attempt at an IPA"
"This beer does not taste like an IPA at all, more like a lager I would say. There was one six on the shelf on a recent trip to FLA giving the impression that it might be in demand. I love IPAs and that is really all I want to drink but this beer is awful for an IPA. The people at Red Hook are drunk on something better or don't know what an IPA is. Even calling this an Impotent Pale Ale would give it too much credit. I could not taste any hops no matter how I tried. The appearance is the only half decent characteristic of this brew."
"I'd avoid this beer if you truly enjoy IPAs"
"D: A strange interpretation of an ipa to be sure, maybe the worst beer that considers itself an IPA I've ever had, but it is still drinkable though not that enjoyable."
"Not terrible, but nothing to see here. Move along."
"If you are a major hop head you are probably not going to be real pleased with this one. Although I like hoppy ales, I really liked this too. Long Hammer seems to have a bit more balance and isn't necessarily all about the hops. It's refreshing and smooth and still highlights the hops without over doing it. Nice job."
"This beer pours a clear golden-bronze color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into nice lacing. The aroma is of citrus and pine. The taste is of citrus with a hint of pine. It is a nice flavor, but it is fairly mild. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a decent IPA. I could drink it again, but would like it more if the flavor were stronger, and the bitterness were higher."
"Looking for the bright side of things I start to blame the bar for this average beer. Maybe they have the carbonation to high, maybe the lines are dirty, etc. I will have to find this in bottles and give the brewer another shot."
"On tap at the Outriger Canoe Club, Honolulu, Hawaii after a long morning of surfing. Nice and refreshing. Pours a deep clear gold with a white head with very good lacing. Flavor is a nice refreshing bitter IPA style bite you would expect. I would buy another."
"Pours a clean golden yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, small citrus, big piney hops. In the taste, small citrus hops, and a bit watery. A mellow bitterness and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry and hoppy aftertaste. A quite mellow IPA, great nose, yet light in the taste. Simple and OK."
"Got this one without a lot of options at a local non-craft brew bar in DC. Poured your standard looking copper color, some bubbles, but fairly weak head. Nose is hops, some light fruitiness. Taste is likewise, although a little bit maltier than I expected. It's actually not nearly as bad as I guessed. Feel is pretty weak, though. Too carbonated, kind of just ""fizzy," rather than full. Overall, a very mediocre IPA, although not nearly as bad as I guessed. I only had one though."
"D - Not an enjoyable selection; this isn't the first I've tried, so I don't believe freshness is in question."
"not a great deal of carbonation. medium bodied. no lace. ok ipa. left me wanting more hops. possible session beer. there are other ipas out there i would turn to before purchasing this beer again. follow pretty close to style."
"D - To be honest, I'm upset that I bought six of these. I might just drink all of them tonight and get it over with."
"Not an overwhelming IPA, so I can imagine this would be a good transition beer for those trying to get into the style."
"D - I thought that this is a pretty good IPA others say its weak but its just a regular IPA its not a double or supper hopped up IPA so for just a standard IPA its a good beer and worth trying"
"Really a good beer, almost balanced, I have had a lot of this brew and will probably have a lot more."
"A golden/amber color, with a quater inch white colored head that forms. It dissolves away quickly, leaving a film on top. The fragrance is hops at the front citrus and pine, but ir almost seems stale in the scent. The malt finishes out the aroma, but very feintly. The malt starts the flavor out, and is very dominant at the front. Then strong flavors of citrus, pine, and earthy flavors come out, but it tastes like the don't belong together for some reason. It tastes like something is just off. The is medium as one would expect, thins out a bit, and then miraculously gains weight at the end, very inconsistant. The only redeeming characteristic of the feel is the dry palate it leaves behind. A hopeful attempt at an IPA, the hops just seemed out of place."
"I'm not a big Red Hook fan, but I enjoyed this brew. Poured a light golden color with a thumbnail of head that disappeared quickly. There wasn't an overly present hoppy scent, but I think it had a light floral or citrusy scent. The taste was of a traditional IPA but a little malt flavor. Not too impressed with the mouthfeel, as there was a light/watery feel, but it went down easy. I don't think I could drink more than two in a sitting. Overall, better than other Red Hooks, but could be better."
"Pours a hazy straw orange, decent head retention, not too thick, less than a finger. A small bit of lace on the glass. Smell is thin, hint of citrus hop, floral. Taste mimics aroma, decent oily hop flavor, pine. A little astringent, and pretty weak on the malt side. But the hop flavor is there to satisfy any craving. Mouthfeel is not bad, slick. Drinkable, but the lack of balance left me wanting. Not something Id go back to too often."
"Drinkability: Any more than a few and I am left craving a little something different. The strong taste makes this a good before dinner brew, which is true for most Indian Pale Ales. I consider this my 'backyard IPA' because it seems to go well with grilled foods. Good price, good flavor."
"Nice bitter lingering aftertaste."
"Drinkability: This beer was not a Slam Dunk...or should I say a Slam Drunk! I had to pass and say no thank you to seconds. It was not what I was expecting from an IPA. However, not Stephon Marbury Horrible...more like Charles smith...it's not what it's supposed to be but it can be adequate if the right pieces are in place. Drinking this with a meal will turn up the appeal of the flavor, but without it is not something I would like to savor."
"D- You could drink these socially... but not if you were in the mood for an IPA"
"Eventhough some people gave this a mediocre rating I thought it was a good IPA. Being from Washington and NOT a RED HOOK fan I tasted this on tap in Solvang, CA and liked it, ALOT. It came to me a orange-yellow, small head, smelled of citrus and floral scents and tasted like it smells. Plenty of hops ot back it up. Eventhough I do not like Red Hook I like Long Hammer."
"I would suggest a try, but would recommend the standard redhook IPA first."
"drinkability - Not a bad beer,was ok. Anheuser-Busch bought Redhook some time ago."
"I have to say that overall I was surprised by this beer. Coming from such a larger brewery, I didnt think that it would be able to deliver the flavor profile it did. To me this is a typical, though slightly tame, IPA. If your bottle is going to be like the one I got, its worth trying."
"Poured a dark yellow color with a small amount of head that disappeared quickly -- a little hazy, but nothing to set it apart from others. Smelled of yeast, a little citrus/floral, and a small amout of hops. The taste was fairly disappointing. I expected to have a predominant amount of hop and yeast flavor, but was surprised with a fairly bland beer. Mouthfeel and drinkability were okay, but this beer left me questioning why I bought it."
"Appearance was a pleasant golden color with a nice head from the pour. Smell is citrus and floral, much what I'd expect from an IPA. The taste however is lighter and less hopped than I'd expect, making this seem to me to be more like an APA than an IPA. Hop bitterness is on par with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for example. Pleasant moutfeel and malt flavor. I generally don't like IPAs but I liked this one, which, unfortunately, probably means this isn't very true to style."
"Pours a dark golden color with white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Lacing on glass was pretty nice. Aroma was of citrus hops and kind of grassy. Taste is also citrusy with grapefruit flavors definitely evident. Mouthfeel was good. This might not be the most complex IPA, but it is good IMO, I enjoyed it, and I would buy again."
"The brewmaster told me that the Long Hammer IPA is the old recipe from Ballard Brewing in Seattle called 'Ballard Bitter"".. Somehow, I remember Ballard Bitter being much better that this. Not impressed. Looking for hops ? Dogfish 60min IPA is your answer.."
"This was all topped off with a nice, semi-dry, bitter finish. Surprisingly good."
"A very enjoyable and drinkable IPA, it just seemed to fall off in the nose."
"Cloudy pale gold in color with modest to inadequate head. Aroma is weak for an IPA I have to almost get my nose wet to smell anything, granted I am not the best detector of subtle aromas, but IPAs are not subtle. They are bold. They preach the gospel of hoppiness into your nosal receptors. Taste is very underhopped for an IPA. I would call the taste unremarkable. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full but a little undercarbonated. With so many great IPAs available coast to coast my reaction to this one is Why bother. It is at best a footnote to the style IPA. With the name Long Hammer, it gave me visions of enhanced sexual performance. Alas, this too was a disappointment."
"Drinkability; This beers downfall for sure. Way too drinkable. Dangerously drinkable."
"The body is thin. Fairly crackling carbonation, but somehow it still seems a bit soft. The bitterness is there, but it doesn't really jump out at you. Overall, it's very easy to drink, and not unpleasant at all. Just a good IPA, nothing more, nothing less."
"I guess if I was jonesing for an IPA in the land of lame, watery ales and lagers, I would take this as a blessing. But I don't live in such a land, and likely never will. It looks nice, but it trends downward from there. The bitterness is gratuitous and utterly unbalanced, and that's not because of excessive IBU's, but because it doesn't seem so much brewed as tossed together. Live and learn, I say, so this one shall remain forever unbought."
" I've had pale ales that blew this selection away. Weak in every aspect. Glad that this was part of a variety 12er and i didn't buy a 12er of just this, then again , the 4 varieties in this 12er were at least consistent- underachieving. Sorry."
"Expirey date was a couple of months ago, but it was sold to me past that date."
"Drinkability: It's basically just another decent affordable not over the top IPA that can be missed. It could have been worse, but it could have been better. For me, I done with Long Hammer and I don't want another one."
"D: Not too tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, I didn’t really like this one too much. There are many other IPA’s that I would pick first."
"Clear deep brassy body with a small, ringy, off-white head. Juicy Fruit malt backbone with floral, very citrusy hop aromas. Herbal and citrus hop bitterness up front. Sugary fruit malt follows. Juicy citrus and light pine hop bitterness into the finish. Moderate body with a mildly creamy feel. Not bad, but not remarkable."
"Drinkability is very high because of the lack of bitterness. But it is a decieving beer being at 6.5%. A good session beer but not a real IPA in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel is quite good really. There is a nicely done feel to this beer, silky almost like there are quite a few late hops adds to it. Overall drinkability is also quite good for the style. A good session IPA for hop heads IMHO."
"At first I thought this was actually a decent IPA with a big of hops. Maybe on par with Flying Dog's IPA. As it warmed up a bit, the hops fade to an unpleasantly low level where they're just a bitter herb-like taste. Meh, here I thought Redhook might have made a decent IPA. Alas. I guess I'd call this an extra pale ale based on other XPA's I've had like Summit's out of MN."
"D: Refreshing and quaffable. What a great style example!"
"An average choice. Good to wash down a burger of hot dog. Nothing to go hunting for on the shelves. Weak offering in a field of much better choices."
"the smell is a light hoppy aroma, not over powerful at all. The look is just of your average beer...nothing different. The tase is pretty good, kind of weak for an IPA, which I do not prefer but may be a selling point for this beer. I find that some people do not enjoy the bitterness of most IPAs. I prefer the really bitter beers. Since it is not that bitter, it makes it a very easy beer to drink. I recommend this beer for anyone who wants a nice intro into an IPA."
"This brew is a clear copper/amber color with a medium thin off-white head that dissapears pretty quickly. Stringy lacing. The aroma is muted hops, pine and malt. Medium-bodied and rather smooth with floral hops and earthy malt flavors. On the whole the flavor profile is kind of vacuous. The finish is mildly bitter and short. Nothing offensive, but nothing going on that makes it stand out among the other grocery store IPAs."
"Golden amber color with a nice white head that sticks to the sides of the glass like a good IPA. The smell was excellent of a fresh hoppy aroma. The taste is very nice with a fresh hoppy flavoring. The aftertaste is also very clean. It has good carbonation and a very good mouthfeel. The only problem is how light the beer poured when it was out of the bottle. I would have expected a beer like this IPA to be darker. Other than that it's a pretty decent IPA."
"Overall, not a bad IPA, nor a great one. As American IPAs go, however, this is one that would probably prove more reliable than others in terms of consistent taste and delivery. Perhaps too generic for some, but a decent IPA for Redhook."
"Pours a light brownish-orange with a significant amount of clarity. Little head that drops quickly. Moderate amount of lacing. Smell is hoppy, with hints of pine needles and citrus. Taste follows suit with a citric and piney taste. Mouthfeel is a light cream that coats the mouth for a moment. I enjoy this beer. Perhaps it is part of my bias towards Washington and Oregon brewers, perhaps it is my ability to get beers this fresh. This beer is one of my session beverages of choice (along with Broken Halo IPA) I recommend it to anyone who wants a good beer for a decent price. Although, it may be more expensive elsewhere. Also, I have not tried this version that is brewed out east. People say that is even better."
"Pours to a pale yellow. Smell is hoppy and honey sweet. Light lacy head. Mouthfeel has good carbonation, not too much but enough. Taste is hops and hops and more hops. Tastes like cascades throughout. Good IPA Standard and flavorful. I've heard alot of people knock this beer due to is production size but if this is the ""macro"" of IPA's, I would still drink it anytime, anywhere."
"This is a easy drinking IPA. Good color, clarity, aroma, body, flavor, and finish. Nothing exceptional though. Orangish, golden color with some copper tones. Fresh scent. Very easy drinking, perhaps even a session beer. Decent finish. Very well balanced, especially for an IPA."
"Poured out a slightly hazy gold brew with a one finger head.Has a very nice ""raw"" hop scent to it,,nice. Taste of a dry brew with some hop flavor but much less then i expected. A decent brew actually,,i kinda like most of the redhook stuff i try. Decent mouthfeel to it. Drinkability is high,, its not gona blow you away but it doesnt seem ""tiresome""."
"This beer poured a light amber with very little head. The smell reminded me of yeast with just a touch of floral hops. The taste was smooth and a little sweet with a hops taste that are very present but without any real bitterness. The mouthfeel was pretty average but I'd say the beer is very drinkable. I wouldn't put it high on my list of IPAs, but I can see myself picking up a six-pack to keep in the fridge if I can find it for cheap enough."
"On tap at Fat Bob's Smokehouse in Buffalo,came to the table in a standard pint glass a lighter golden with thin formed soapy-like head that stuck around for most of the pint being drank.Very light hop aromas for an IPA faint pine and citrus with some dry bready malt showing through as well,at first swallow you get a touch of hop quality a little pine resin but it fades out quick and becomes a little bland I was hoping to get some nice hop to cut through the bbq but it really didnt hit home.A pretty average beer that with some pretty average bbq last night."
"Bottle: Poured a light orangey color ale with a small foamy head with average retention. Aroma of citrusy hops is quite pleasant. Taste is also dominated by some citrusy hops with some very subtle notes of malt. Body is slightly thin with some medium to low carbonation. Interesting and better then expected."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. very clear golden amber color with a 1 1/2 finger head, rings of lace all the way down the glass. Not a good beer, not an IPA. no hop bitterness, not much flavor or smell to speak of. I might be able to drink more of this but there are much better beers in my fridge to try and luckily I only bought a single of this."
"i thought this was going to be a hit from the aroma, but the taste doesn't deliver, a little bit of a one trick pony in that department as well, the hops, namely the bitterness dominates (for lack of a better term)."
"That considered it's still quite quaffable, the first lawnmower beer of the IPA style that I've come across. Not my first pick to reach for within the style, nor anywhere's near the top half, but I'd buy another 6 to barbeque with on a hot day (or mow the lawn)."
"I can drink it, buts very boring and bland, and is definitly lacks the hops of a real IPA."
"D: The nice dry finish is good and I'd gladly belly up to a few more bottles."
"Overall, I still like this beer, it's just not at the top of my list anymore. I'm glad a solid beer like this is this good and this easy to obtain for a reasonable price point."
"Medium body, too unbalanced, no clear definition to this beer and the end bitterness is way over the top for the lack of malt."
"It's a decent IPA and I'll have one anytime but I don't see myself going crazy over it."
"D - Highly drinkable and easy to enjoy, it was my gateway beer and due to it's availability and popularity I can see it doing the same for many more. I'd definitely recommend it to someone trying to break from the standard water-lagers."
"This was a very underwhelming IPA. Perhaps it is dumbed down to please the BMC masses. Redhook's ESB incomparison has much more character. Redhook should reclassify this as an American Pale Ale."
"The aroma after the pour seemed to be fairly strong on the hop side. I detect a good amount of pine and grapefruit, as well as leaning toward the leafy, flowery scent. The taste is mild to medium hoppy with very little malt blended in. This is a fairly decent ipa, but not one to rave about."
"Overall a decent choice."
"I still appreciate the gift of brew, from my good friend Ross. Thanks buddy."
"an ok beer but nothing great. color was a little light as well was the head. tasted a little less hoppy than i would expect for an IPA with just a tuch of citrus.body felt a little thin drinkability was ok though. all in all I would'nt pick this one unless choices were limited."
"The body may be the strongest aspect of the beer. Solid body, no hop oiliness, even -handed carbonation. An average to below average IPA but drinkable nonetheless. I could see snagging a 6 pack of this if I were in a convenience store stocked only with macros. Otherwise, I'm keeping my distance."
"This beer pours a clear gold with a head that rose and faded quickly. Looks a lot more like a lager than an IPA... There is some wispy retention on the glass. Smells appetizing -- I get mango from the esters and citrusy hops. Mmm... fruit salad. I like the way the fruit aromas mix with the graininess of this beer in the nose, but less so on the tongue. I agree with the reviewer who described the taste as soapy -- I especially get that in the weakly bitter finish. So, it doesn't quite live up to our expectations for IPA's -- in Redhook's defense, it's a moderately tasty beer that has become very affordable at the local supermarket (thanks to A-B), and is remarkably sessionable for a 6.5% pale ale. As a grad student on a budget, I'll continue to buy it as long as it's on sale, though I should really just make 10 gallons of true IPA and stop supporting mediocre ""craft"" brewing..."
"12oz bottle. Pours an uninspired clear gold with some carbonation. Decent lacing. The aroma doesn't bring much more to the table and is noticeably lacking. The flavour profile is pretty nicely hoppy, although it's just missing a little fullness to make it a really good beer."
"Overall, pretty pathetic. I'd have to say that the best thing about this beer is the moderate amount of lace that sticks to the glass... Yeah, that's the best thing about a beer for me too... Don't even bother with this one."
"Overall, a decent IPA. Nothing I would go out of my way for, but not something I would turn down, either."
"A (maybe) rhetorical question: does beer taste better in cask? This certainly does. I've had it in bottles and on tap, but it's so much better in cask. A golden color with a thick white, very sticky head. Floral aroma, and a citrus (grapefruit) taste. Very smooth and drinkable. It held up well with jerk chicken wings and Hungarian peppers."
"D - Overall a very inoffensive offering...I thought it was good with my dinner and worked well but it's nothing special. If you're out somewhere and this is one of the more ""premium"" picks it's worth a shot"
"D - Easyly sessionable beer. Has a reasonable amount of hop character, but the aroma is lackluster and the haze is quite bad and surprising from a fairly large craft brewery. Overal it is an ok beer."
"Notes: Not sure this rises to the level of an IPA, but on the other hand, I'm not sure what you'd call it otherwise. I'll pass on this in the future, though at least it is a lighter beer with some bitter hop flavors that works OK in the summer."
"Overall: Probably the best of the Redhook products Ive tried, and a cut above their regular IPA. Definitely worth a few tries."
"Overall, a decent brew, but not the IPA I prefer."
"Pours a bright, clear straw color with a one-finger white head that broke up into a thin, holey collar that left a little bit of lacing. Aroma isn't too strong and is of piney hops with a bready body. The taste is much of the same, with bread up front and bitter citrus rind in the finish. There's not a ton of flavor to be honest. It's medium bodied and quite fizzy. I bought this at the supermarket because it said IPA. Not a bad beer, but not anything special. Would be good for a cookout."
"appearance is a hazy yellow color with a nice head that dissipates quickly. smell is lightly hoppy, pretty weak aroma for an ipa. taste is about the same. this beer is medium bodied and is pretty smooth but it is a boring beer especially when you were hoping for an ipa."
"Good IPA. Dark gold with a medium white head. The smell of the hop flower is abundant. Hint of pine. Tastes good. I'm not a huge fan of super hoppy IPAs but this one has a pleasant taste. Not overpowering. Nice warm feeling from the alcohol. I like that. Good beer."
"I had this last night and i thought it was a pretty solid IPA, it had a solid bitterness and hop kick, however it gets a low session rating because something about it, maybe the aftertaste bothered me by the end of the 6 pack that made me not want to drink much more of it. I highly nejoyed the first one, but it dropped off"
"What a poor excuse for an IPA. Not quite an instant drain pour, but I'll never drink this again. They have no business selling this with all of the quality IPA options available. Save your money and buy something else."
"this was a hazy yellow in color with decent lacing. bouqet was very subtle, mainly got a bit of sweet malt and fruitiness. taste was moderately sweet with an almost medium bitterness on the back end. for an ipa, the hops don't really show themselves in this one. medium in body with a decent mouthfeel. this beer lacks complexity and at 6.5% i would expect more flavor and aroma."
"A fairly pale orange-yellow color with a modest but favorable looking head that does die down to a very thin cover. Lacing is pretty decent. The aroma is not huge but is tastey enough with that familiar blend of hops and citrus, a little sweet suggested. The first taste is mild, and pleasant of malt, hops and crackers with a lemon touch. It's has a good presence of very fine carbonation but is still a bit acqueous, but not enough to hurt in my view. Makes it very drinkable. I could drink lots of these. Refreshing, tastey. A small tang at the tongue and a subtle dry finish, not much bitterness, just enough to fulfill the ipa experience. Well done, a good middle of the road offering. Shouldn't hurt anybody's feelings and suits me just fine! Defintely try this one out."
"It's pretty boring and not IPA-like at all. It's very yellow. It tastes yellow even, whatever that tastes like. It doesn't taste like an IPA that is for sure."
"Easily the best Red Hook beer I've ever had and probably the best commercial non seasonal IPA I've ever had. I'm glad I know this beer is decent because given its availability this will make for a nice go-to beer. It won't wow you but it's worth a shot."
"This was served in a pint glass, showing a light straw-colored body with a thin yet very sticky head that left spider-web lacing on the glass. The nose was strong and powerful (in comparison to the taste) with a strong shot of grapefruit up front and a good compliment of grassy undertones smelling certainly well-hopped. The taste was fair and a bit disappointing because while pleasant, it was weak and watery in comparison to what you would expect by what the smell is offering. The watery texture takes away from the taste and mouthfeel but lends itself to slightly increasing the drinkability."
"Drinkability: This has become one of my favorites. Reason one, it is very affordable compared to what else is available locally. The second reason, it has become available now in my area on a consistent basis. And third, it is a well crafted beer with a wonderful flavor and taste, A great beer for everyday drinking or special occassions."
"Mouthfeel- some malty sweetness, plenty of hop flavor but no boldness to it. A little floral with soem citrus flavors barely seeping through. This beer tastes good. I wish RH would have been a little more aggressive with the hops. Not a disappointment, just middle of the road for an IPA."
"Drinkability: Great, this is one of those IPAs you go to when there isn't a big selection at a bar. Also, if they are trying to pass this off as a micro brew, you might feel inclined to buy it. Try it. I did."
"Flavor is not much better. At only 6.5% the alcohol is surprisingly noticeable. Very one dimensional hop profile, with no real complexity. I would honestly hesitate to even call this an IPA, as I've had pale ales with more hops."
"This one is weak. It seems caught between APA and IPA (an APA with higher alcohol, which to its credit is pretty well hidden)? Whatever...with so many solid IPA's out there, why bother ..."
"Overall- Not bad. An easy 1 to throw back. A good IPA that you could chug on the golf course on a hot summer day."
"D: More of a pale ale than an IPA - they really should rename it, but it's quite quaffable no matter what they call it."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, golden yellow-orange color with a glistening white head comprised of many minute bubbles. The smell isn't too intense but it is pretty well balanced with a slightly sweet malt nose that is complemented well by the underlying hop smell. The taste is not quite as balanced; obviously since this is an IPA the beer steers towards bitter. The initial taste is of light malt, immediately followed by a bitter hoppiness that lingers through the rest of the taste. However after a few drinks, the bitterness is barely discernable. There is a slight graininess about the beer, but the alcohol is pretty well covered by the hop bite. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sudsy carbonation. Overall, a drinkable beer and pretty good; not my favorite IPA ever but it's solid."
"Definitely a beer that is not worth having at all unless you have it fresh, and preferably on draft. Had that way it is a pleasant enough ipa even if it is nowhere near tops in in its class. Pours golden with little head but decent lacing. The smell is of light citrusy hops and with a light graininess. The taste starts with lemon and grapefruit and some developing bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is a little light and spritzy. In the right conditions a pleasant drinker. I have to say that I don't often have Redhook beers anymore. I never thought they were the best beers on the planet, but I feel they have lost a great deal of what charm they once had. The real problem with this beer is that I probably had it in peak condition, and it was just decent. Most people will have it on its way to staleness in the bottle, and the experience just won't be as good."
"Light body, hops dries out the tongue. Aftertaste is hops, pine/resin. While it may fit in with the style, I was not impressed with this Redhook offering. Absolutely no depth here at all."
"Flavor is lightly malty, lightly hoppy. Touch of sugar in the finish. Weak, bland, boring. This is supposed to be an IPA? Nice try bud."
"Overall: It is what it is and for 12 bucks a 12 pack its damn good. My go to beer when i dont wanna break the bank, good combination of flavor, a/c and price."
"I was duped into thinking this was something new, and not just their old horrible IPA repackaged as a new horrible IPA. Mine didn't even have that neato split label. Fuckers."
"D- It wasn't difficult to drink, but it wasn't a great beer. I'll finish the two I have in the fridge and I'd have one if offered at a party or something, but it doesn't make me want to drink more."
"drinkability is not as good overall due to the high concentration of hops, but lovers of this style (myself included) will have no problem tipping a few of these back in a night. cheers!"
"Easy to drink...maybe a little too easy. Enjoyable IPA if you're not looking for bolder, wilder flavors. And perhaps the perfect gateway beer for any macro lager drinker looking for something better."
"This is a good ( though rather mild) American IPA. Nicely bitter and hoppy onset, with this bitterness predominating throughout. Struck me as a toned-down version of Stone's highly regarded Ruination. Doesn't have the more complex citrusy flavors of some single-hopped IPA's, but a winner just the same."
"i'd have this one again, but only if it were the only ipa available. still no hop devil, double simcoe or white hawk... but drinkable. It seems that all redhook beers fall into that category of being better than your run of the mill american beer, but nothing to write home about either"
"D: I bought this one on a whim and probably will not again. The taste just doesn't do it for me, but if friends had this and that was all they had, I would drink it (not a ringing endorsement by any means)."
" Overall tis was ok. It just came off as a bit too light for me and thats why it doesnt get a better score. I would put it right above average, only because it is not bad, however needs to be juiced up a bit to have some of those flavors start to come out. Really should have a bit more of a pop to it. Not a bad session beer, and the light profile really allows you to throw it down in quantity."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Light clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Flavor actually fairly balanced for an IPA some sweetness with very slight bitter finish. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Found this beer on tap, looking for a little pep. Well, unfortunately this brew didn't deliver entirely. It looks like an IPA (perhaps a bit too filtered...), it smells nice, with floral and citrus hop, but the taste just isn't there. There's almost no hop bite at all! Faint, fleeting floral and herbal hop notes start out, but the the rest of it is a bit too watery and bland. There's not even a real big malt profile here. To be honest it's not a bad beer, it tasted ok and all, but it's not an IPA. And I had no real desire to have another."
"Tastes almost exactly like it smells. Very well balanced and easy drinking in spite of its high level of flavor."
"Jessica is a dork!"
"Drinkability is pretty good."
"I dunno about this beer, seems like the flavor is out of whack- that roasted/burnt flavor doesn't sit well with me."
"My only taste of this beer at a bar that may not practice good tap line maintenance, etc., so i will gladly edit this review if I ever have the chance to taste this beer again."
"D: Drinkable beer, nothing objectionable, just a little to pallid compared to what I look for in an IPA."
"D - A little too phenolic. Came as no surprise when I noticed that this was affiliated with Busch, I've had a few Red Hooks that I like but this is definitely not one of them."
"Pours a clear, light caramel color; quite light for an IPA... Nice half inch head formed, but needed a heavy handed pour (perhaps just too cold). Aroma is heavy in the floral, herby hops, not any citrus noted. Quite a bit of sweet crystal malts in the nose... this one seems to be more malt forward in the nose than hops, also not boding well for style. On the palate, it's an awkward amalgamation of bitter, flavorless hops, an awfully thin body and a biting finish. There's so much lacking in this IPA that I think it's perhaps the worst I've ever had. It's very harsh and abrasive with a very fusel like finish showing its 6.5% abv closer to 11%. I don't think I'll be finishing this bottle, a big dissapointment."
"Drinkability of this beer is pretty good if your looking to cool down, the high ABV's keep it from being sessionable ."
"Drinkability - I'm not an expert, but it doesn't seem true to style. It's not altogether offensive. The 6.5% ABV is hidden well."
"I'll just cut to the taste. Lots of grapefruit and pine needle taste, and some unexpected buttery sweetness, and not much else. 15 minutes later, it's still there on my tongue and it's not good. The hops is there, and I'm a fan of the hops, but the hops taste lacks some complexity that makes a good IPA. In the ""cheap"" beer category of $6 a six-pack, there are much better IPA choices."
"Nice enough to drink every once in a while but an IPA that has lots of room for improvement."
"Pours a clear, golden to light amber with 1/2"" bubbly, foamy head that is just offwhite and leaves a nice foamy lace all the way up the glass. Moderate piney hop smell with a hint of citrus. Pretty mild smell for an IPA. The taste is clean and crisp with a slighly piney, mild initial hop bitterness. Pretty nice balance between hops and malt, but a little light flavored for an IPA. Light to medium, refreshing mouthfeel. In terms of drinkability, it is light enough for a session beer, but just interesting enough to taste. I would probably buy it again."
"Long Hammer IPA pours a light gold, clear with no real head. Aroma is raw hops, kind of grassy. Taste is dry and bitter, some hop flavor but not very clean. The bitterness is there, but there's no malt backbone. There is some sweet malt flavor, but its just too light. The beer is thin, especially for its strength. It certainly goes down easy enough, but not very enjoyable."
"A medium sweetness is balanced by a clean, slightly herbaceous bitterness, both of which linger on in the finish. Dulled, yet still noticeable, bergamot flavors mix with notes of pine and even a note of menthol which creeps into the finish from time to time. An interesting mix of hop flavors are noticeable in this beer. This beer is certainly a bit muted by today's more hops until it hurts standards, but this is a very well balanced, easily drinkable IPA."
"Quick review... nothing real exciting. Looks almost like a Budweiser when poured. Minimal head possibly due to being a bit to cold. Aroma is very light of citrus with a touch of hops. Could be more. Taste is very light for the style. Smooth and crisp. The hops aren't really there until the end. I am getting some of the fruit in the taste also, pears or green apples maybe? Finishes nice and for 6.5 quite drinkable. It was enjoyable but I think the Redhook IPA is better. Nice to enjoy this one while it's here though. Good."
"This is one to sneak into a blind taste test to see if removal of megabrewer bias effects score..."
"This beer strikes me as being brewed to be innoffensive for the mainstream beer consumer, of which I doubt there are many on this site. Redhook ESB is a fine beer...and this one is not."
"Pours a slightly darker shade of gold with a good 3/4 inch head of foam. Aroma is floral and citrusy. I can definitely pick up the smell of Cascade hops in this one. Taste was hoppy, grapefruity and piney. The malt flavor was more evident as the beer warmed to room temp. Mouthfeel was fairly light. This is a very sessionable IPA, lighter in body than most, but deceptive in that it is over 6% alcohol. The price wasn't bad either, 4.99 at one of my local grocery stores. I could easily down a sixer of this in an afternoon. Not an over the top beer, but solid none the less."
"Drinkability is just fine. This is the Coors Light of IPAs I guess, a great example of the California XPA style. Well, there are two styles of XPA, high gravity and low gravity (and I love 'em both)--this is the latter. The polar opposite of syrupy, gooey, barleywine-like IPAs. I like it and wish I'd bought two--I'd have the second right now. If it came in a can, I'd buy a 30 pack to take to the beach. Highly recommended."
"A decent IPA, but it doesn't really make much of an impression -- either good or bad (except in the initial smell). It feels... lethargic. I'd rather spend my money on Sierra Nevada or Stone."
"Best thing about this crap? Cheap."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thick head of large off white bubbles. Aroma is pine and citrus. A bit perfume like. Instantly creamy perception upon sipping. Interesting. Flavor is not as intense as the aroma, minus the perfume quality, but follows suit. Mild bitterness brings up the rear. Not a rip your face off IPA. Just a nice, enjoyable hoppy IPA. On the cheep side too by comparison."
"Good thickness, creamy and a tad bouncy but not too bubbly. A really nice pale, woody IPA. And a good value."
"Like most Red Hook offerings, this is worth your time and money."
"On tap at AK's bar & grill in Fairview TX. Terrible pour from the girl working the bar. No head at all. Medium gold color and mostly clear. I thought about sending it back but just drank it. The smell had some hops to it. Taste was ok. Not as flavorful as some but but not bad. Had a little buttery taste. The more I drank the more I actually liked it. When faced with one of these vs. bud or miller there is no contest."
"D- Wow, a Redhook beer I actually like! Most of their beers Ive found to be average at best, but this one is ok. Nothing special, but decent."
"Poured a crisp light amber with a thin quickly diminishing head. The aroma was of some hops, but barely present. The taste was off-balance with an overly bitter hop presence that overpowers the malt and just leaves everything tasting off. The beer is crisp and the 6.5% is well hidden, but that does not make up for the taste. I must say I was thoroughly unimpressed by this beer, and felt obliged to follow it up with a Two Hearted to make things up to myself."
"D: Pretty boring IPA. Most brewers would call this a pale ale. Lacks sweetness for balance."
"Perhaps I had lowered expectations for this beer because of its score, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Paired with a spicey jambalaya, it did the trick."
"very drinkable. I thought this was a good representation of style, and a tasty well balanced IPA."
"Light bodied blonde in appearance, its head is thin, but leaves some good lacing on the glass. Hoppiness is less powerful in the smell as other IPA's I've had, mixed in with a cooked veggie scent. The taste seems to be more bitter than hoppy, with little action in the malt department. Its easier to drink per se than others, but nothing too encouraging for me to have another of. If you want a tasty IPA, cross this off your wish list."
"A firm pour into a half-liter mug offers up a voluminous pale tan head of very good duration and lacing. Pale golden in color and brilliant, no yeasty beasties here. Nose is positively delicate, with flowery hops affecting notes of white pepper, and light golden fruit implied by the biscuity, pale malt. A lightly crisp, tingling hop bite is my first sip impression, and it's a gentle one at that. It blends well with the malt, but isn't as spicey as the Pacific Northwest hop-bombs I'm accustomed to in the style, so color me surprised. Lighter in body and fairly light on the mouthfeel, too. I appreciated a mild sweetness here, but almost would've preferred a bit more body/sweetness/booze (and at 6.5% this beer is rather dangerously drinkable*). Pleasing floral hop aromatics and bitterness linger more in the manner of a Yankee rendition of a British IPA, which I also find interesting and worth noting. Very mild fruit and vegetal notes also impress themselves as this warms, and the dryness in the finish is definitely worth noting, but ultimately I'm left with the impression that this needs ""more of something"" in order to convince me. Don't get me wrong, as this is a stylistic departure from Ballard Bitter (or what used to be, anyway), but it's getting to the point where I need to be convinced by Redhook these days (am I the only person who feels that Copperhook and Sunrye just don't cut it?) I'm also left with the impression that if they ramped up the malts and hops on Long Hammer it could make for the basis of a well-balanced Imperial IPA, and in that sense I think they're on to something with this recipe. But you see where I say it's ""dangerously drinkable"" up above? ( * ) The main problem with this beer as it stands is I wouldn't want to have more than one in a sitting: it's almost like ""an American IPA for folks that *don't like* American IPAs", hence my impression of being unconvinced. In other words, this is BudHook at its finest."
"Nice moderate hop assault with pine and some backing citrus Nothing outstanding, but utilitarian aand definitely drinkable. Mouthfeel is broad and a touch of oil to the texture makes the aftertaste a treat. Not a great IPA but ok for a macro and better than I expected."
"Pours pretty light for an ipa, not much head or lacing present. smells of floral hops and some citrus tones. Tastes ok, hop taste is good but not strong enough compared to other ipa's still a good beer, but not as strong. floral hops are there, but could use some more bitterness. Mouthfeel is wam and full, has the potential to be better."
"D: The alcohol flavour is a little too much for me to session."
"Overall, an enjoyable one down here because, frankly, ipas are quite rare on tap around here. But it isnt one i would think would win any awards. I'd say the hops are on the milder side (not a bad thing), but there isnt anything in it really to want me to really seek it out. But worth trying."
"D- rather enjoyable and very sessionable, not a hop heads delight but a nicely balanced IPA with good flavor, leans toward English style IMO, I'll by back to this"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle bought at a local grocery store, no date. Minimal Head with minimal lacing. Maybe it was a bad pour, but I'd like a little more head. Smell is slightly of hops with some big stinky malt scents. Smells better than it tastes. This is seriously oxidized. Tastes like wet cardboard with a little bit of hops added for good measuere. A little sweetness as the beer fades on the tounge with lingering hops. Mouthfeel suffers from the lack of carbonation, but otherwise alright. Drinkability is good, despite the other flaws it hides the 6.5% alcohol well. Maybe I got a bad batch or something, but I wasn't impressed at all, in fact I had a hard time getting in to this one at all. It improves a bit as it warms, but still not great. Very disappointed."
"Nicely drinkable with a medium-light body and good finish. Goes well with food. Reminded me a lot of the standard Redhook IPA."
"DA: 6.5% is not exactly a session beer but it's pretty easy to drink. Overall, this a nice IPA nothin' fancy but pretty standard."
"If it wasn't the early hours of the day, I might have ordered a few of these out of simply excitement that I wasn't forced to drink your typical bullsh*t; especially at a ballgame."
"12 ouncer , with bottled on dating (04 03 07) etched onto the front label, Pours very clear, light honey amber, with a near white head, leaves long sliding strands of lacing. On the nose I pick up respectable wiffs of leafy fresh hops. Easy drinking and fairly enjoyable ale. Hops moderatly evident, resiny. A wee bit thin in the middle, watery, I would say. This one is missing the complexity, and malt backbone + hop crunch of higher scoring exemplars of the style. A decent sessioner or ""in a pinch IPA"" but I will always try to find a true ""craft beer"" if available. Support the little guys, I say...""Eat the Rich"""
"This beer poured a light golden color with very little head even with an aggressive pour. Little to no lacing, however the pour brought out some good smell from the beer, I could smell the grassy and citrus odor pretty strongly. The taste was piney hops but kind of on the light side. An easy drinking beer, but would have liked more hops and some more bitter bite to it."
"Not my favorite IPA by any stretch. Could benefit from some balancing and palate-broadening."
"Blurs the line between American pale and an IPA. Tasty either way, but nothing to write home about."
"While this might be a good choice to ease a newbie into 'bigger beers', it needs some real work on the malt bill to be taken seriously by IPA enthusiasts."
"This is a very drinkable IPA. Almost too drinkable and too light. I would consider this to be more of a pale ale than an IPA. Maybe it'll be my IPA for the summer heat."
"Good IPA, but not the best at the price. Easy to drink though."
"Drinkability: good, at 6.5% ABV you probably cant have too many but this is a good example of style. Very clean and refreshing."
"the taste was slightly bitter with hop flavor like a toned down ipa. it was better than a normal offering might be and helped wash downt he spicey food i was enjoying, but i could have done better with a bit stronger ipa it was smooth and drinkable until it began to warm and it became more harsh in the mouth. a good beer but maybe not a great beer"
"Memories are drawn out whenever I see redhook offerings. Awww the post college days when I thought I was drinking liquid gold in redhook. While not serving terrible brews they generally tend to be fairly bland."
"This is a nice crystal-clear, copper-colored beer with a thin, stay-put, white head and good, sticky lacing. Smell is good and fresh, no frills classic cascade citrus and pine. It is clean and fresh. Taste is very simple. Bracing bitter upfront barely qualifies this for IPA status. Sweetness underneath and a soapy off-flavor comes out if you let it sit on the tounge too long. This sits very light on the palate. I would've liked this beer more as a pale I think, but as an IPA its got no oomph."
"Orange / amber color with a large fluffy white head. Foam leaves some lacing, but it quickly disappears to nothing. Lots of floral hops, grapefruit. citrus aromas. Taste was typical American IPA with lots of hops: pine, citrus, grass, bitterness. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Drinkability is good for one but that was it. Lots of hoppiness, but not really balanced with any malt."
"And the finish fades to quickly. A very good effort for a AB. beer."
"Pale amber color-decent head though seems flat in the glass actually. Fairly hoppy aroma. Hoppy flavor-fair amount of hops and a citrus quality thats almost lemony. Could use more malt body and flavor. Decent level of bitterness. Finish is a bit astringent. Ok body. Overall a notch above average."
"Drinkability: A beer I would probably not seek out again at least in the near future. There are just so many American IPAs out there that are more complex and just plain taste better that this offering kind of gets lost in the mix."
"Drinkability- Ehhh, will pass on this one again if seen. Not anything special here. But, is was an IPA, so if I see a new one, I have to try it."
"BIA (Buy It Again?): Absolutely...especially at the $2.99/six pack that I got it for this time! It may be ""old"" (3 whole months), but it's an IPA! (Don't tell the liquor stores our dirty little secret!)"
"Drinkability: I'm a hop-head, and even I didn't care for it. Not that the hops were to much, but the malt was to little. Stick with Redhooks IPA. It's much better."
"Taste is lively with the hops dominating the palate to be sure. Piney, resiny, oily, slightly citric hops. Anise is in evidence, and although the character of the brew definitely leans towards the bitter, there is a heathy dose of crackery malt in the finish especially. Light caramel sweetness comes in a the beer warms a little. My only real complaint is that it's a little bit raw for my taste and could stand to have a little more malty body to balance it out a bit. Finish is quite dry and very bitter, but like I said, the biscuity malt shines through in the aftertaste. Carbonation is a little numbing than I'd prefer, but that's a mild quibble. This is a solidly drinkable and refreshing IPA, but one that's still just a litle bit unfinished for my palate."
"12 oz. bottle- color of clear amber, with a small off white head - nose of honey , hard floral hopps , and citrus hoppyness  taste of resin , hopps , lemon lime citrus , malts , and grapefruit- body is watery , and  aftertaste of hopps , malt , and slight metallic"
"This beer poured a very clear golden color with a thin head which quickly dissipated. The smell is of hops  fresh and citrus like. The taste is bitter, but not strong. This is a mild tasting IPA. The mouthfeel compliments it well  somewhat thin. This is an easy beer to drink and I find it quite refreshing."
"Taste -hops mildly hit you upfront with rthe aforementioned pine. Malty breadness finishes it off and lingers as the aftertaste. This is an ipa? The hops do not come to the forefront and the aftertaste is sweet rather than dry. Pale ale is more like it"
"D - An okay IPA. Not the best in the world."
"Better than expected and far better than this companies mediocre at best IPA. Not going to make me forget DFH 60 minute but good none the less."
"Drinkable, but there's better out there. A macro-brew trying to be a micro-brew is what I think of. There's worse, but there's so many better examples out there. A good beginner IPA for the newbie."
"Drinkability: Before this beer, the guys at Redhook seemed to be firmly entrenched in ""play it safe"" mode- making boring examples of accessible styles, but they did a pretty good job with this one. As good as this is, I'm going to be leaving it on the shelf in favor of any one of the big handful of better tasting micro-brewed IPA's in the future."
"Copper coloured with a nice enough large rocky/frothy off white head. Nice aroma, nothing spectacular slighly hoppy with a lager like malt presence. Quite sweet and malty for your typical IPA, though hops do appear at the back of the taste. Thinnish mouthfeel, slick but at least the after taste is nice. Overall a lightweight IPA, rather like the original Redhook IPA..a pale ale basically. But it hides the 6.5% alcohol very well and you could get drunk before you know it. OK for a summer camping/boating trip."
"Overall: Not as in your face as Stone IPA, not as meager as the Sierra IPA has become (it ain't the same as it was 10 years ago, don't even kid yourself). Much better than the old Redhook IPA (which was just a PA). Good effort from a mass production micro brew."
"Bottom line: A better product than their original and it has the potential to be a good cross over beer but, for me, it's not very exciting and not something I'd buy very often."
"Drinkable but uninteresting IPA. Another Redhook beer that is session worthy, but pretty pedestrian."
"This will definately woo over someone who is an IPA nonbeliever."
"Dinkability was diminished by the total ordinariness of this, the overall lack of flavor intensity. Went down OK, but it's almost a case of why bother to drink the stuff? I will pass on this one in future, w/ great disappointment."
"The mouth is solid and a bit oily. I think the IBUs are low enough to make this sessionable."
"Overall impression: Very drinkable IPA. Nothing outstanding, but a solid example of the style."
"Drinks well, nothing too strong or weak."
"D: Overall, not worth the 8 bucks I paid for a six pack. I could have a few of these while watching the game, but I'm not convinced that this is an award winner."
"This is a very drinkable beer, but an unremarkable one. It's not as full-flavored as many other IPAs in the same price range, and lacks a lot of character. Still it's a light drinkable brew, good on a hot day, a nice ""macro crossover"" perhaps, but there are better IPAs."
"A fairly decent I.P.A., if a little boring. On the plus side, it gives you the familiar taste of an I.P.A., with some pine notes. Unfortunately, it lacks body & character, leaving a rather unremarkable impression. Still, it's better than average, and offers enough to be worth trying. It might appeal to those overwhelmed by complexity and/or bitterness of traditional I.P.A.s."
"Has a nice botte with a design of greenery embossed on the bottle. Pours a nice golden yellow color with a thick rich head of small bubbles. Leaves a ring along the top of the glass where the head started. Has a heavy hop aroma with what smells like cascade or willamette (still getting my hops down.) Starts out smooth and then nails you with a nice hop bite at the back of your palate that lingers for a while. If you like hoppy beers then you will like Long Hammer!!!"
"One inch of light tan head lasts only a couple of minutes from a strong pour. Body is a rich golden tone, very vibrant. Nose is a honey sweet hoppy mix. Even hosts hints of citrus and mellon. Subdued bitter quickly balances with silky hints of vanilla and subtle sweetness. Bitter feel all around is soft and even. Maybe to soft to truely represent my opinion of a IPA in general. Relatively thin mouthfeel. Easy to drink."
"If this is in fact 6.5 ABV its well hidden. Drinks pretty darn easy, but seems to be a bit too timid style-wise an an AIPA. This ins't a bad one to go with if you are limited in choice. I have fond memories of supping Ballard's Bitter at the Dragon Hill Lodge in Seoul, a oasis in a sea of crap American & Korean beer, so this will always have a soft spot in my heart. I'll take this over the esb, which has lost all its character IMO. A good training wheels IPA IMO. This 12 pack will get consumed within the next 72 hours, loads of football this weekend!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Pale yellow with a bit of cloudiness. The head is about a finger thick, frothy with decent lacing. The hops are piny and bitter at the end. Well balanced, flavorful and just the right strength makes this a good beer. Wonder why it isn't rated better?"
"This beer was a good beer and I will look to try another one."
"It pours with a nice orange to amber color with a light creamy head. However, the use of the IPA label is only that. Its aroma and taste were small on the hops let alone close to the expectations one would have for a beer labeled as an IPA. It tasted more like a typical mainstream pale ale."
"This IPA is a little above average but not much more. It has all the components but nothing exceptional in any area. Everything seemed to be on the ""light"" side. Maybe it is brewed that way in order to not offend the casual micro drinker who buys it. It's a good beer but nothing special."
"Bought at locate liquor store by a friend who left a couple over at my house, so I thought I'd give it a try. Poured harshly to create head, but to no real avail, the head rose and fell fast and now is lingering in patches around surface of the beer. Lacing is present, how ever it seems to be a little inferior. The body appears to be a light, thinnish golden hay color. It smells of mild pine, but lacking the complexity I like in my IPA. Its as if there is a bridge made from the hops to the malt and with most the bridge is complete, but with this from the hops to the malt there are a couple holes (sorry for the shitty analogue). There are also some grapefruit, citrus hints to be smelled, but nothing too inspiring or exciting. The flavor is decent, some carbonation is present with relaxed bitterness and easy drinkability, but nothing that really excites me. The after taste is too wimpy, to kick my taste buds around and when I drink this I feel like I can taste the steel vats it was fermented in. Honestly I've had a lot worse, but I've had better. If selection is limited give it a try, but if not reach for something else."
"GET MY BUZZ ON-m"
"Cheers!"
"Notes: A good beer to introduce macro-lovers to when looking to explain and provide an example of how hops affect flavor."
"As far as I can tell, there is nothing bad with this brew; it is a nice, drinkable IPA. However, nothing really separates it from the pack as a brew. I liked it, but not enough to keep me from giving another IPA a shot the next time I go shopping."
"Nothing memorable....nothing bad either. Just unimpressively average."
"I like this one for it's extremely high drinkablility and refreshing qualities. Nothing really grabbing my attention, but I would definitly pick up a sixer! Good, but not outstanding."
"Overall, it tastes like a good IPA, but offers nothing out of the ordinary."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a bottled on date. Had a big three finger head and good lacing. Was a golden/honey color with some carb. Smell was heavy on hops with the dishwashing soap smell. Decent mouthfeel. I'm hit or miss on American IPA's and this one missed. Wasn't overly hoppy like some others but just wasn't well balanced for me. Worth trying just to mark off list. (2, RB/NA, ML, O)"
"This brew doesn't quite fit the profile of an IPA. Where's the hops? I would avoid this one in the future."
"Good IPA. It certainly does not compare to the greats like Stone or Dogfish Head, but it is nevertheless an excellent brew. While the taste isn't going to wow you with in complexity or intriguing subtleties, Red Hook does achieve a very good balance between hops and fruit. This IPA also has a lingering thickness that makes the mouthfeel enjoyable. Very drinkable. Overall, a pretty good beer that I would buy again."
"If you're looking for a good IPA, keep walking - it could use some more flavor to back up the bitterness. This is, however, a pretty good candidate for a sessionable pale ale, and its not a bad beer at all by any means."
"There definitely could be a boatload more hops here, and I would appreciate some malts that hold up a bit better too."
" Wavz"
"I was disappointed in this beer personally. The pint I was poured was a very cloudy yellowish amber color with a white head. I normally wouldn't think of an IPA being cloudy, especially from a brewery the size of Redhook. The aroma was pretty nice, definitely a strong hop presence. Flavor was somewhat unremarkable. Hops had a hint of citrus, but overall seemed a little bland and uninspired. Somewhat thin mouthfeel, and pretty easy drinking. This could be more of a session beer then most of the other IPAs I have drank in my time. Not horrible, not great. Just an average IPA, but if it was the only option available for this style at a bar, I would definitely order it again. I would not go out of my way for it."
"Is this the Ballard Bitter repackaged? It's been several years since I had the classic old Ballard, but I don't recall it having any of the delicious hop character that this beer displays. Very nice."
"This is a good, solid hoppy beer that's not too expensive and is widely available. If you're looking for hops and don't want to drop a lot of dough, I would recommend this brew. If you haven't tried it in a while, give it another chance."
"Probably wouldn't pick this up again, an ok but not great representation of the style"
"D-I can drink a ton of this with the right food. Not my normal style for a regular sit-down at my favortie pub but it will do the trick for a one-hitter-quitter before I go home. Step 2 after APA on that Ladder to Hop-heaven."
"This IPA pours a golden red color with minimal head but leaves very good sticky lace. Smell is of Sweet malt with a hint of italian herbs. Taste is of herbs and a slight bitterness from the hops. This beer I drank pretty quickly it went well with some chicken I was eating and it went down smooth and quickly, this would be a good quick party beer."
"D- This beer has the taste of an average lager with some hop character. I would like to see a bit of depth in the malt or some ale fruitiness to give the hops some support."
"Tasted: 06/20/06"
"Compares quite similarly in the bottle as it did on tap. Still as pine-ey and citrusy in the nose as in the keg with a very mild malt character. I usually like my standard IPA's to have a lighter body to let the hops show cleaner, but this is a bit too thin in the malt flavor and the body. Expectedly over-attenuated to increase the alcohol, but sacrificing the flavor and body. The malt seem a bit strained, allowing a grainy-bite to occur and the hops show a mild metalic flavor under a lacking sweetness and creaminess. It's not bad beer, I've just gotten used to drinking better."
"Overall: Not that bad, but not that good."
"Nice head, creamy, that at least stays a 1/4 inch all the way down, with a fairly thick lace. Nose is rather malty, low to non-existent hop aroma. Flavor isn't too bad, a ""lesser"" IPA than I'm used to, but if I'm going to have to purchase something affiliated with A-B, this will do.... some nice bitter aftertaste. Maybe not recommended, but not my last choice of IPA's."
"Drinkability: Perhaps the recipe has changed or perhaps we just have a case of piling on A-B, but this beer is better than other reviews attest; my beer was bottled within the last 40 days, and that may be positively affecting my view as well"
"If you are looking for a little bit of hops but are afraid of the bite, this is a good choice."
"Okay mouthfeel. The carbonation is good, but the blandness of taste makes it seem just too fizzy. Drinkable, but so is water...why drink it when you can get something more exciting?"
"Not the best IPA in my life, but decent and tasty. Worth a try!"
"Poured a clear light amber beer with 1/4"" head that dissipates after a couple sips and a several minutes. The smell is light to moderate hoppiness (pine and citrus). The taste is pretty good with the hops coming a bit stronger than the smell let on. Mouthfeel is lighter than most. I could go for this again if lack of choice forced me to (as it did last night). Nothing stands out about this beer, just a normal ipa a bit lighter on the hops."
"The clear brownish/red color and fairly lively mouthfeel are what you would expect for a west coast IPA, but the taste left a little to be desired. The hops gave a lot of bitterness without a lot of the hop flavor, if that makes sense. Probably not one of the better IPA's out there, but not one of the worst either."
"Well, after reading some of the reviews here for Redhook IPA, I'm pretty convinced I'm drinking a different beer. This Redhook IPA pours a clear blonde hue, with a good deal of carbonation that settles to a think layer of bubbles. The appearance is okay. There's a decent amount of ""piney"" hops in the aroma; which is pleasant. The flavor is pleasant and hoppy enough for me, certainly for a Sunday afternoon. The finish is quite bitter but in a very tasty way.A slight toasted malt flavor keeps this beer from being to boring. Overall, this is a light-bodied IPA that IMO has a good enough hop signature that I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"The taste wasn't particularly potent or quite as hoppy as I'd hoped for, but it was still a good beer. It wasn't your typical pack-a-punch IPA, it was a bit of a milder IPA, but still had a bit of hop presence, and that nice tangy zesty piney lemony thing going on. Tastes like a good, refreshing summer beer that goes down real easy, and it was a buck or two less than most six-packs, so why not? Well, I mean, other than the fact that you'd be supporting Anheuser-Busch..."
"M & D: Like above, this beer has a pleasant mouthfeel. It is not lingering. Its a clean crisp IPA without being overly bitter. Malt is present but is just a transport mechanism for the hops. Very drinkable."
"Pours a bright gold color with a small white head that appears to leave some nice lacing. The first smell that rushes to my olfactory is oranges, its followed by pine, hops and a faint smell of malt. The initial taste is once again is a citrus and stays until its followed by 2 other flavor stages. The first one is sort of a hop and malt type flavor then its followed by a bitter hop flavor and ends with a nice citrus flavor. Definitely a very surprisingly nice beer, not exactly full of the type of hops Ive come to expect from IPAs"
"Redhook IPA poured a golden yellow with a small white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Smell is okay, not really hoppy. I like the taste, but it is not to style. I find the taste fairly enjoyable, a little sweet toward the end, some citrus, hoppy bitterness definitely present. I wouldn't drink it everyday, but I don't think it's bad."
"Somewhat languid showing on the palate. Taste is of tonic water and grassy hops - a somewhat out-of-balance concoction. Giving respect where respect is due the slick mouthfeel makes this brew quite drinkable, especially cconsidering the abv. Not at all bad, just an average IPA that won't roundhouse you in the face, which is sometimes preferable."
"O: Buy this beer and you'll be sorry. With the new Bel-Air in town dealing 22-oz pounders of Hop Ottin', and Lagunitas IPA readily available, Sacramento-Natomas IPA folks should wisely stow their Safeway Club Card and pony up for a real IPA. I'll be saving the other 11 of my 12-pack for the VERY latter stages of a party."
"Overall, I thought this was a solid offering. Probably not something that is going to blow away the veteran beeradvocate, but it is a nice drinking beer. Something that could introduce the macro drinker to hops and lead them on the path of righteousness."
"This is a nice and balanced IPA that will certainly satisfy all but the greediest of hopologists."
"had this in fl. one of the very few half way decent beers I could find in the stores before I went to total winefrom the bottle. poured a golden orange with a small white head. aroma hops, citrus, leang towards orange and not much going on after that. flavor hops, citrus no leaning to grapefruit. for a inexpenive beer not to bad."
"Overall = AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
"Overall not a very good IPA but worth trying anything in cask."
"Flavor is very mild, this is a very ""easy"" drinking IPA. This would be a great introductory beer for somebody just getting into IPA's. but for me, I'll grab it if it's on a good sale and I need a session beer for a Sunday afternoon."
"Mouthfeel is a little on the sweet side, and not as carbonated as I'd prefer. Long, bitter finish."
"Dnot a bad IPA. I will enjoy the 6er I bought.probably 3 at a time."
"Drinkability: Not a terrible beer, just not a very good IPA in my book. I knew it would not be great but I like the ESB so I thought I'd give this a try. I was disappointed, even though I only paid 4.99. There are much better beers available for just a few $$ more."
"I'm surprised to see the reviews on this are as low as they are. I had this on tap at Five Spot on Euclid Ave. in Atlanta. Was a nice golden colour with a snow white head. A little cloudy. Had nice lacing. Big citrus hoppy smell. Lots of grapefruit / hops in the taste and a nice malty finish. I thought it was quite refreshing and very sessionable."
"Pours an orange to light golden color with a finger of white head that falls to a very light, but full coat over top. Clarity is excellent and just a few bubbles from the bottom are present. There is more lacing left as the head recedes than I wold expect. Nose is very fresh, with a wet hop character to it. Behind this, there is a moderate caramel and toasty bread character with a hint of orangey and peppery hop. Smells nice, just not as bold as I want my AIPA's to be. Flavor starts as a very solid melanoidan infused toastyness, moving to more caramel sweetness with a light citrusy hop that transitions to a peppery hop, finishing with a moderate, but clean, bitterness. A slight metallic bite hits, but doesn't stay on too long. The feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Good balance and feels about right. I'd still like to see a bit more brilliance from the hops. Its just lacking some of the pop that I like in American IPA's. Its not bad, just could become a better IPA with a different hop profile."
"Body is almost medium, heavily carbonated and coarse. Overall, a very plain IPA that is suitable for quaffing when on a $5.50/6-pack budget."
"This beer is pale, pale copper in color, crystal clear, with a low head. The nose shows bright, fresh, floral, and fruity PNW hops. I think ""bouquet"" is an appropriate word. That being said, it is a rather subdued bouquet. The aroma is fine-- I'd just like a little more of it. On the palate a sharp bitterness is followed up by sweet citrus hops and a nice, juicy (again, if kinda light) malt profile. The descent into the medium finish is smooth and easy, kinda like how this beer drinks. As others have pointed out, this is at the low end of what is to be considered an IPA, but I still found it to be perfectly drinkable."
"D - a decent, tasty brew. Something to have at a bar when you don't find more adventerous micros. But this beer is missing something as far as malt body goes. Basically an 'above average' beer, which is why I gave it a lot of 3.5's."
"Overall I couldn't have been dissappointed more. I typically drink a Stone IPA or a Victory HopDevil, as these two IPAs are IMO delicious and are available in my area regularly. The RedHook IPA was the only thing called an IPA in the store so I grabbed it hoping to get a hop fix and my lord it was everything but a fix, I needed a hop fix even more after drinking it, good thing I had a Hop Wallup in the fridge. Not recommended by me."
"This is what happens when you are in a beer bar and you let a""friend"" order for you while you hit the head. The bartender was in on it with him and it was served in a pilsner glass. Odd I thought that looks way to dark to be a pilsner, they wouldn't tell me what it was. So I smelled and it was citrusy with a lot of biscuit maltyness, IPA thought I and they laugh at me. I had a few sips and found it not too bad but the flavor was what you would expect from a middle of the road IPA and when I said that it was ok but only so-so they told me what i was dirnking. I have had this many times before but it was not and has never been bad, just so-so. And so it remains easy to drink IPA with nothing remarkable about it."
"A mediocre IPA, not as bad as some reviews make it out to be. It sort of tastes like an decently hopped piney IPA made with a slightly bigger BMC malt base. The bottle shows 6.5% ABV, so obviously it seems they've been working on this beer since the old version. It's drinkable, but again, pretty mediocre."
"Most redeeming quality of this beer is that it is quite enjoyable as I sit on my back deck on this 72 degree day here in NC."
"Nose is midly hoppy. Not nearly as strong as other IPAs. Taste is also quite mild for an IPA. Hops are present, but not very notable. A very mild IPA. This lends slightly to its drinkability since your mouth won't be overly hopped after a couple. Overall, not a good example of the style."
"Bottled on 01/04/06"
"I guess I'd prefer to drink a good pale ale over this faint-hearted IPA."
"O: This is NOT an IPA. This is a poor interpretation of an American Pale Ale. Thanks BudHook for further confusing the beer drinking public. Now those beer neophytes will think this is what real beer tastes like."
"nothing too wild compared to the other ipas around."
"As an aside, I often buy Redhook products when I need bottles for my homebrew, as the simple single label on the unembossed bottles will virtually float off with immersion in warm water."
"~No. Do not drink this beer. I usually don't slam beers,but unless you mean to punish yourself...."
"Pours a bright golden hue topped by a wispy, creamy white head. Aroma is mainly that of lightly sweet malt, a touch of honey, and a very light hint of hops. Palate balances light sweet malt and mild fruity hops, with a vague sour character on the finish. Medium body is adequate and holds the flavor well. I'll just put it out there: there is nothing special about this beer."
"A very light,too light for my taste,gold color with a very,very,small head.The is very hoppy.The taste,like the smell,is very hoppy and ends with a bitter taste that's almost bitter.The m/f is light and a little watery.Not a bad brew,but there's room for improvement."
"Poured a hazy gold with a small head. The head covered the top of the glass all the way down and left some nice lacing. Some hops smell, The taste was good, but not great. Some bitterness, but not the hop flavor I have come to expect with Harpoon or Hop Hog. The beer had a nice feel to it , not too watery and no unpleasant aftertaste. I guess you could call it balanced, but I was expecting more hops flavor. Drinkability was good, if this was the available beer, I would have no problem with having several more. Given the choice, there are a few APA's and IPA's I would choose over this one."
"This is not a stand out IPA, but a good one that goes down way too easy."
"There are *much* better IPAs out there. This is almost all hops, and they're not even good hops. As a standby when you need a dose of bitter, I suppose it's decent enough, but beer geeks can almost always do better."
"Not bad: a brew with a nice hop bite that is quite drinakble. A rich mouthfeel and good aroma, though the finish could be a bit better. Recommended."
"According to the bottle: Bottled 20 Jun 05, 6.5%ABV. Pours a nice clear golden color, small head dissapates quickly, some carbonation, some light lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, citrusy. The taste is not bad, hoppy with a little bite at the end, not as good as others for sure, but not bad. Medium body. This is drinkable, but there are other IPAs way better, but maybe for an intro into the style it would be good."
"Drinkability-Considering how bitter this crap is it went down suprisingly easy. However, at the time at had this, I had just gotten done with a nice long bike ride and was shooting the shit with my riding buddy, so anything would have tasted good if it was beer. So, not so bad, but this is not that good. Don't get it if you think it is IPA. Redhook is full of crap on this one."
"My friend gave this to me after thinking he ordered a Red Oak amber ale, so I already give it high marks for its value. This one was unfortunately the best choice on draft last night but after the second one, I was tired of it (hence the lower score for drinkability). Too light in color for the style, average and not overwhleming hoppiness, a bit on the heavy side. Only $2.75 a pint once I had to pay for one."
"Pale golden/amber witha good creamy two-finger head and lots of active rising bubbles, laces decent. This is the best part of the beer, it looks like a Two-Hearted! Just a small hop smell. Weak watery malt under a not so great hop profile. If this had a decent amount of malt, it wouldn't be hopppy enough for an IPA. The only reason it is is because of the hop/malt ratio. Light, lackluster body. Quaffable, but definitely sub-par."
"Pours a pure golden hue, with excellent clarity. Foamy two finger head with good retention and plenty of sticky lacing. Herbal hop aroma is strong and hides a sweet adjunct malt scent. Massive hop leaf flavor that balances an estery sweet malt base and leaves a bitter and dry aftertaste. The even carbonation prevents the coarse alpha acid bite from becoming cloying, but the body is somewhat thin and the alcohol is percieved. A well presented IPA, just a little harsh towards the end."
"I really like IPA's like this. Gold, grassy, bitter, nice head...It's an all day beer. Great burps!"
"the aromas from this beer are very nice. it has subtle scents that are fruity while the hops are very present. while pouring it gave average sized head that left a silky layer on the glass edge. they dont call this beer that ballard bitter for nothing, either. it is definitely a bittery taste but not in a bad way at all. very strong hop flavor that goes well with what seemed to be a sweeter malt taste. i enjoyed this beer very much and would certainly get it again."
"Interesting beer."
"A few months back I tried the Redhook Amber and I was disappointed. By contrast, this beer has promise. Pours a bit cloudy and the one I just sampled does look like an IPA; however, I do agree with previous reviewers. The sweet smell smell and lack of hops make me wonder, wheres the IPA. Not something Id come back to but better than Redhooks Amber."
"My friend had a party this weekend and he bought this instead of the Bridgeport IPA I had advised. I'm sorry he did. I couldn't believe how much my tastes had changed. This is not a stellar example of an IPA and I will most likely not be drinking it again any time soon."
"If I had this in a blind tasting without knowing anything about it, I would say this is a pretty decent beer. After finding out it's labeled an IPA, I would start to wonder why. It's several shades lighter than most IPAs, and appears thinner as well. Nothing wrong with how it tastes, although it is very simple. So simple in fact, I'm bored trying to think of words to describe it. I would say it's an average, very drinkable pale ale; a good stepping-stone into the world of great IPAs like Bridgeport and Stone."
"Had a few pints of this over at the Barking Dog in Bethesda. It's a mild IPA with an orange hue (almost like orange soda watered down with sprite). It gives off a pleasent smell with hops and a bit of malt. I detect a bit of sugar as well as some fruit undertones. The taste is good, dry and crisp just as the style dictates. After a sip, my mouth is left wanting more and that's always a good thing. It quenches my thirst and goes well with light fare. A few of these are easy to handle. Overall, a good beer for it's style and readily available in the DC area."
"Still, worse beers out there, though with as much as I paid for this at the supermarket, you could probably do better if you looked around. In a pinch though, this might do."
"Overall an ok beer, not so good as an IPA. Flavors are well balanced and there is some decent quality product used to make this beer, but I am disappointed in the amount of hop flavor and bitterness. They could push it further."
"poured a medium amber-golden color with moderate white head that quickly fell to a thin ring.Smell is strong of piney hops and mild citrus. Taste is distinctively hoppy with siome lenoy notes. Finish is dry and bitter. A ggod beer, buth nothing that sticks out from the crowd."
"The beer dispenses from the brown 12-ounce bottle a luminous gold with a portly bright white frothy head that slowly degrades leaving a solid coating of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt with a light but pleasing aroma of hops, start is sweet with a satisfactory grain presence and the top light to moderate in feel. Finish pleasantly acidic, the hops adequate in their spiciness, dry lingering aftertaste, a drinkable IPA, maybe one could classify it as an IPA for beginners or people not into hops."
"Overall, a pretty solid Americanized IPA with kick that one could enjoy several of. I had one with a chipotle chicken pizza and another just sittin and talkin."
"Looked good, smelt fine. Taste was average, mouthfeel, about average, but the bite of this beer was a bit harsh for me. This beer has a taste it just isnt good. depth is there but is's bad. They got all hyped about having a taste and forgot to make it good. Extreamly bitter, harsh on the way dawn, want to be sweet. This wasnt the worst beer i ahve ever had, but far from the best and this beer is NOT AN IPA!"
"Doesn't stand out, but a pleasant quaff. We takes what we can get here in deprived Alabama."
"Overall: Not great, but certainly not awful. It's not exactly the definition of a nuanced IPA, but it's solid enough to drink for four bucks a pint at a show. I thought this one was significantly better than their ESB."
"Drinkability: very good if you aren't a hophead, but an IPA needs more hops than this no matter what the Brits do to their IPAs."
"Drinkability: awesomly drinkable--an okay mower beer or hot day beer."
"A solid American IPA from Redhook. One of their better beers."
"Ok beer, got it for cheap so I won't complain."
"Orange-hazy color and a small white head. Stick a little to the glass. The smell is way to sweet for an IPA. A little bitterness from the hops can be detected. The taste is nothing like an IPA. An almost artificial sweetness seems to dominate up front. A hint of fruit from the hops but not much else. Has a light malty aftertaste. This is not an IPA. None of the flavors that I look for in an American IPA are present."
"Redhook beer has yet to make a favorable impression on me (I did like the Winter Ale come to think of it). This IPA doesn't measure up. It lacks most of the qualities that I look for in beer of this style. The mustachioed dude on the label says ""Ya sure, Ya betcha"". My reply is ""Uh no, no thank you""."
"Redhook must have changed their recipe since I last tasted this brew. The time previous to this one was about three years ago. I must say, I was definately not impressed with the beer at that time. This time, on the other hand, I was impressed by the subtle yet hoppy taste of this beer. This is one smooth drinking brew and the 6.5 abv doesn't hurt either. I would definately recomment this one. Not the hoppiest of IPA's but not too hoppy."
"Bottled on 04/04/05. Pours a hazy golden amber color with a decent head. Very hoppy aroma with a faint touch of caramel malt. Piney/citrusy hops dominate the taste profile of this ale. While this IPA is certainly not the best IPA I have ever had, it is not the worst either. Craft beers are slim pickings in my neck of the woods and this one, while not a top choice, it is a good fall back beer"
"Drinkability: Easy going down and definitely hits the spot but it's nothing out of the ordinary. Enough hops to satisfy but probably will leave most wanting some more complexity."
"I guess I would drink this one again without much complaint if the choices were slim. As it is I don't think I'll be getting it again- pretty average in every way."
"Drinkability: This bloke is undoubtedly consumable. Nothing offensive here, just a mild mannered brew you could drink copious amounts of while enjoying a good meal."
"PS-- I love how the packaging half covers up that this beer used to be Ballards Bitter"
"This isn't the best IPA to be sure, but I didn't find it as bad as reviews indicate. Redhook IPA is light copper in color with an average head. The aroma is west coast hoppy, not as intense or of as high quality as possible for the style. The taste if of citrusy hops with some floral hop action mixed in. Mild maltiness is also in the mix, especially noted in the finish. Bitterness is present, but not enough to totally ravage the palate. Drinkability is very good, probably because the bitterness isn't incredably high. Either the recipe has changed or this beer is underated, because this is tasty enough to deserve better than a 3.04 average."
"Overall, this is a really nice simple IPA. Highly drinkable. The grassiness reminds me of summer, and this would be a really nice beer for just that...I'll have to try it next on a hot summer afternoon."
"The most enjoyable beer during my visit to the brewpub. Pour when pulled was a lovely golden color, topped with a frothy and creamery head. Aromawise, I liked the light grassy/haylike notes. Medium mouthfeel. This beer was pleasant and easy to drink. The aroma was duplicated in the taste, and the grassy hops were the most notable and delicious element."
"Do not file under typical Northwestern IPA."
"I hadn't tried this beer in awhile. It seems like it's gone through a few changes over the years and I thought I'd give it another taste. The bottle I had tasted better than I remember it. Nice and brilliant with a straw color. Decent body and head retention. Fairly dry aftertaste. I noticed a nice hop bouquet on the nose which suggests it was dry-hopped. Maybe it wasn't, perhaps just really fresh as the beer had a born on date suggesting the beer was less than two weeks old. I thought it was a good beer that I will sample again in the near future."
"RedHook IPA pours a transparent bronze shade and leaves a very minimal amount of head retention. The smells are nice, some hops and faint fruity notes. The first taste is good yet not very bold. There is a strong hop-bitterness in the aftertaste and I also seem to sense some type of bread, which I did not expect. The mouthfeel and drinkability are slightly over-par, it has a really nice warming affect after you take a drink. You would almost think it had a higher alcohol content, even though 6.51 is still very nice."
"This is one of my favorite tasting ales that I've ever had on draft. It definitely has a flare of a spicy Belgian Ale. It has almost a brass like color, and in reality though, it tastes just like a true English style Bitter-Beer. Another great feature is that its 6.5% alcohol per volume."
"If you travel the globe drinking craft IPAs, chances are that you won't be a big fan. But this is an excellent IPA-style beer for the aspiring IPA connoisseur. And it's not bad for the rest of us."
"Overall this is not a bad beer, pretty easy drinker for an IPA - free at that - 3.5."
"Redhook IPA is an enjoyable beer...just don't be any under pretenses that this is an IPA. Still, it's a clean, simple beer that makes a good stepping-stone to hoppier, more complex beers...like an American IPA."
"Goes diown smooth with a bit of dryness. Not a bad IPA, just not much more than average."
"Very light in color for an IPA, just a tinge darker than a pilsner. Not a very strong hop aroma here which is another downer. Flavor-wise this beer is close to the style with a decent hop kick, but nothing that will bowl you over. I'd stick with Redhook's ESB which is a better brew overall."
"The head dissipates quickly and the lacing is minimal. I do not get the impression that this is a ""craft"" beer at all. I'm disappointed. No wonder Red Hook's finances are looking pretty weak."
"I'm all about trying beers for the first time. There won't be a second chance for this beer from me. I am most unforgiving when my beer drinking time is wasted."
"this is by no means a bad beer, its just not a very good beer. I like IPA's a lot and i enjoy the taste, but this is fairly lacking as far as taste goes. I couldn't believe that it had 6.5% alcohol, i couldn't taste, though i could certainly feel it after a few. So I guess this could go both ways, if you like the taste of IPA's stay away, but if you like to get drunk quick on a easily drinkable but tasteless beer, buy buy buy!"
" This tastes like a bar of soap being rubbed in the grass as it warms up. Drink it very cold to mask the soapyness and only taste a subtle kick of mystery-hop. At least that's what I do when it's on sale, I don't have much money, and want a buzz + slight hop fix."
"Excellent drinkability, for my palate, as this one is very fresh(if the bottling date is correct). A very nice, if not exceptional, American version of the British pale ale style. Hops aren't very assertive, but this has some nice pink grapefruit flavors that combine well with the caramel taste of the malt. This would make an excellent session ale."
"Refreshing yet nothing special going on here at all. Very drinkable, but I wouldn't have another one. I'm one of the many who feel that this beer has been mislabeled. I like my IPA's very hoppy, but I'm still able to recognize the weaker ones. This one was just bland for the style. If given the chance, pass on this one."
"Overall the malt and hops are fairly balanced, but nothing to get excited about. Although I wouldnt necessarily say this beer is horrible, it doesnt do anything for me, and I can't rate it high in any particular category when it is claiming to be someting it clearly isn't. Maybe if they called it a pale ale or something more close to what it really is, I wouldnt have been so disappointed."
"Pours out a semi-cloudy copper color with a smallish head (fairly benign pour). Little to no lacing on the glass as the head quickly settles. Seems to me I had a much larger head on this one the other day... but with a more aggressive pour. Aroma is pretty tame, but seems to contain a certain yeasty hint to it. Maybe a tiny touch of citrus as well... but very faint across the board. Taste is rather bland. Hops seem to dominate the flavor characteristics (as you would expect on an IPA), but it lacks the balance and complexity of the better beers in this class. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, but perhaps slightly overcarbonated. This seemed to give it a little bit of a mouthfeel that is too thin. Still highly drinkable, I'd rate this beer as perhaps a gateway drink for the macro-going-micro crowd. Certainly not an ""A" list offering, but still has some merits here or there."
"Big, cream-colored, dense foam head has a pillowy collapse. The color of the beer is a clear, peachy gold. Fine carbonation. Spots and lines of lacing. There's a faint citrus aroma with a little sour milk. Sweet milk in front with a touch of citrus hops. The middle is sweet, tangy fruit, milk and caramel. A lightly bitter finish shows a little light alcohol. It's a decent, light, fresh beer. Not much intensity."
"Heavy on the hops, as an IPA should be, but with enough malt to make this an enjoyable beer."
"taste was about the same but seemed to ba tad too bitter for my taste. mouthfeel was good but slightly watery and thin. its quite drinkable but in my opinion not worth the 7 bucks a 6 I paid for it."
"Pours out a very clear, thin yellowish-orange with a decent amount of head. Very fruity aroma. Lots of apples and citrus scents present. The taste is not exciting at all. A somewhat dry, chalky feeling on the inside of my mouth that is not reminiscent of the fruity aroma. A very mediocre IPA. Sort of dull and not exciting, but it is drinkable."
"The mouthfeel was a little thin... and it would be a more drinkable beer were it not for the appearance. That distracted somewhat from the taste experience."
"My review of this beer might suffer due to proximity to red seal ale, which I was drinking at the same time. I found that this IPA had less of a hop character than I had hoped for. The hops didn't fit very well with the rest of the beer. The brew was nice and bitter, which was a plus, but in terms of reviewing based on style, this IPA could have been done better. I have not been impressed with redhook offerings so far."
"I finished the bottle but gave the rest of the twelve pack away."
"Just found this in my girlfriends parents fridge with a date of 5/15/04, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It pours the standard deep orange golden color of most IPAs with a slight head that left the scene quickly. The smell was not what I would have expected detecting just about no hops only a slight sweetness. This tastes slightly bitter with a mild citruses taste from the few hops that are present. Not bad tasting overall but not great. Mouthfeel was average and it had average drinkability. Not the best but definatly not the worst, it will work in a pinch."
"Formerly known as the Ballard Bitter, and was no doubt once enjoyed in great abundance in Seattles Ballard District."
"Thought I would give this IPA a try as I saw it Olivers and you would get a free pint glass. Well I think I got bamboozled! This brew pours to a golden yellow with a nice fluffy white head that sticks around for the majority of the experience leaving nice lacing through the brew. The scent is ok, nothing spectacular sweet floral with an alcohol aroma that seems strong. The taste is a little bitter with some weird things going on but would expect a more hoppy bite! I dont really think that this should be classified as a IPA. It is an ok brew, but next time that I see a free glass I will remember this one and will not get bamboozled again!"
"The fairly off taste makes it harder to drink than it should be."
"--Joey"
"12 oz bottle. Light pale yellow color, nearly fizzy, but not really. Some golden undertones to it. Clumpy white head, faded quickly. Hop bubbles not present. Crispy bitter smell, but seem contrived not hop filled and fresh. Taste was super bitter, biting and harsh. Overly bitter, and nearly metallic. Not hop bitterness though, more like a big contrived bitter flavor. No malty balance underneath. Flavors get watery and muddled. Thin watery finish. Wierd version of an IPA. Drinkable, but not puckering and bitter, doesn't tease you taste buds into another drink, but feels like something you have to do, to finish it. I haven't read Venom's review, but I would guess he would call it ""insipid""."
"Cheers to what once was, and to my next, better beer. (hmm, there's a growler of Masala Mama in the fridge, calling my name...)"
"Not a bad beer by comparison to others, although this is a let-down when categorized as an IPA. This beer reminds me more of an ESB or something. A passable beer, but probably the least favorite IPA Ive tried to far."
"Light golden color with a white head that doesn't stay long, but leaves a sticky film around the inside of the glass. Aroma of sweet honey and orange peel. Hop flavor is bright and citrusy, with some pine notes as well. Not an overly complex flavor, but very refreshing and enjoyable."
"Cloudy gold pour with an orangish tint, distinct but not very stong hop aroma, nice light hop taste, with a sweetness making its presence known in the aftertaste. This might be a nice IPA to introduce someone to the style, also an IPA you could drink all night."
"Suprisingly slightly better out of the bottle. Tastes more like pale still, reminds me alot of a bass. Since this is supposed to be IPA scores suffer."
"Pours a golden liquid that is almost crystal clear. The head is white and foamy. The head stayed around for quite some time, which is impressive. There was a fair to good amount of lacing on the glass. The smell was a little bit of cirtus, combined with what was almost spicy. The taste was rather sweet, with a hint of citrus and again the spice. Are we sure this is an IPA? I can taste the hops, but only slightly. Seems like it is rather balanced. The hops are not winning. Not an IPA, not even an APA. Not sure what this is, but rather disappointing. Mouthfeel was ok, and it was pretty drinkable, but I am not sure why you would want to drink much of this. Seems as though this beer has been labeled incorrectly."
"Bottle dated 122203 poured clear orange yellow color and left a small white head that left a little lace in its wake but didnt stick around for long. For an IPA I was disappointed in the low hop aroma. Some bitterness with a little malt backbone but not all that much. Mild carbination helped the hops out a bit too. The mouthfeel was on the lean side while the drinkability was better than average."
"Not the most complex IPA out there, and truth be told more of a pale ale (not even really an English IPA). Nicely bitter, smooth, medium bodied, good drinking beer. Twice the beer on cask as it is from the bottle or tap."
"This poured out a slightly hazed pale golden color. Topped with a perfectly normal head of white foam. The aroma tends to be floral and sweet with lemony grains and even a hint of a musty sourness. The taste is estery, bittersweet and creamy. Theres an evident bitter alcohol tang in the aftertaste. Not harsh, but a tad astringent. Overall a pretty smooth and flavorful beer with a decent malt body and a nice underlying sweetness. Finely balanced, very drinkable."
"Copper red crystal clear appearance with a two finger sized head and lively carbonation. Good head retention and decent lacing. The smell is grassy, musty, and indistinct with a hint of roasted malt, and is is way too faint for an IPA. Taste is also leaning a bit too heavily towards malt. It is nutty, biscuit like, mildly sour with only a medium helping of hops. The hops that are there are also aromatic, citric types, with not much bitterness. Not too shabby for a pale ale or a bitter, but not really in on par with most beers in the American IPA style. Mouthfeel is medium thick with a decent strength. This is a balanced English style pale ale, that makes a good session beer, but lacks that certain oomph to push it over the edge of mediocrity."
"A boring, iffy IPA. More hops would be nice. Get this only if it is the only IPA available."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The beer pours a rich looking golden color. The head was there but quickly went away. The smell was very floral but the taste was lacking compared to the aroma. It wasnt as bitter as I thought it would be. A bit of a dissapointment. The taste was good but not as asserative as I would expect from an IPA. Mouthfeel was very heavy and full bodied. Doesnt stack up to other IPAs."
"Served from the bottle, at an Old Chicaogo. I like inclusion of the phrase ""Ya Sure, You Betcha"" on the label, being from Minnesota. The beer was a very solid IPA, good hops bitterness, even though I could've used more. I know, I'm a confessed Hophead. This is a good beer that I'd galdly get again."
"The beer feels good in the mouth, but the flavour and smell are bad. This beer does not rate for me in the IPA style and makes me feel that the brewer simple took a cheap beer and added some more hops."
"The beer pours a light gold color with thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malt scent with floral hop notes. The taste is fine. It is dry and hoppy. There is a good balance of malts and hops here; a pleasant tasting ale. The mouthfeel is outstanding. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good IPA. I would buy this one again."
"Not an IPA I look for, but still a solid offering."
"."
"The color is a pale tan and the head is not substantive but basically average, certainly acceptable. Too much carbonation that dissipates too quickly! The malt flavor is also perhaps too light to really taste satisfying. The alcohol is right for an IPA, but the hopping is weak, in terms of bitterness and aroma. I hear that this is much improved on draft and even better if you can find it served real-ale style, cask conditioned. Not as good as their ESB!"
"-Oelergud"
"Overall Impression: drinkability isn’t bad, but it lacks some character and depth. One dimensional, more like a pale ale than an IPA."
"It has been years since I had this beer. I really can't remember if I liked it back in the day, but I do know I had a Ballard Bitter T-shirt. Therefore, I must have at least thought that it didn't suck. That is my assessment now as well: This beer is not great, but it definitely doesn't suck. A good session beer, in my opinion."
"Head quickly fell after pouring. I really could not detect much of anything in the aroma, perhaps a smidge of malt and hops in the background, but not what I expect in an IPA. Flavor is not very hoppy and very evenly balanced between malt and hops. The bitterness is low, but present. The mouthfeel is good and the drinkability due to the low hopping is good as well."
"When poured, the head was small sized, ivory with small sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The body was clear with carbonation observed and the hue was orange. The nose was malty, hoppy and sweet with a hoppy and bitter flavor to it. The mouthfeel was very tingly and medium bodied. This beer left a good lacing on the sides of my glass."
"It smells a little better than I noted in my review but otherwise this basically sucks. Its grainy, clumsily hopped, and has some really cheap carbonation. With the recent move of Bear Creek Brewing, Redhook is actually the closest brewery to my house. How sad. Im raising the Smell by 0.5 and promising myself never to drink this again."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 13SEP03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"10-03: Had a nice treat. They had a cask version at the brewery. They even served it at the proper temperature. Dark golden with little carbonation. A little clear for a cask beer. Fairly decent hop (grapefruity) signature in the nose and taste. Good malty backbone. Not the most kick I've had in an IPA, but not bad nevertheless."
"The beer poured a light gold color with a thin head. Very weakly carbonated. The aroma was average, as I noticed a slight bit of malt and a minimal floral nose. The IPA tasted weak, and was unbalanced with more maltiness than hops. The malt dominated the initial taste, but was quickly subdued by a slight bitterness which lingered on the tongue. This seemed way too sweet for this style, and clearly the expected IPA bitterness was not strong enough."
"A watery quality to the mouthfeel at first. Then if felt as if my mouth was about to dry up. I am not impressed. A clean crispness adds to drinkability but I can think of many other IPA's I would rather drink than this one. I am glad I only bought a single bottle."
"Really thin and grainy malts, with some citric hop bitterness at the end, didn't really see too much standing out, very boring watery mouthfeel, and for a cask ale this was extremely below average, this beer is making it really hard for me to meet the minimum character limit for my rating (Cask- GBBF 03')"
"It has been a while since I have visited the brews of Redhook. I figured it was about time to dive back in to a college staple. Pours a hazy straw color with a heavy foam head. THe aroma is lightly of citrus with a toffee malt sweetness. A huge sharp bitterness is teh first impression on the palate with undertones of sweet, sharp cotton candy-like malt character. A moderate citrusy spiceflows through a lingering bitter finish."
"Stunningly clear light amber body that has a small off-white head. Very little lacing noted. The aroma on this brew is primarily of a caramel malt base with nominal hop notes. The flavor is below even my normal desire for a more lightly hopped IPA. This is quite average and not impressive. Certainly not of the quality of Redhook ESB. The feel is medium and lacks crispness in the finish. Oddly flat tasting."
"Medium gold color, slightly cloudy, medium head. Medium malts and hops. A medium hopped IPA, somewhat bitter with some malt sweetness, Smooth mouthfeel, with full flavor. Hoppy without being too bitter, nice balance. Finish is smooth and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"I have one word for this, ""Why"""
"I was fairly disappointed with this beer--I hadn't read the other reviews and was expecting to find an above average beer. Pours a light golden with a very persistent foamy white head. The aroma and taste are both fairly mild and only slightly hoppy (not at all what I was expecting). Fairly smooth and drinkable but nothing to get very excited about. This was not too bad as a beer (very average as my scores reflect), but was definitely bad for an IPA. I'm fairly confident I won't bother having this again."
"Had this on tap at Forecaster's pub in Woodinville, WA. Aroma of hops was quite strong especially for such a mass produced beer. Slight sweetness came through the pine and citrus hops quite nicely. Flavor was dominated by hops with enough sweet malt character to keep everything in check. This one really surprised me at the brewery as I am so used to mediocre ESB."
"With so many Outstanding IPA's out there, why do breweries continue to turn out mediocre ones? The folks at Redhook need to take a look at what Stone, Bell's, Victory, DFH and even Diamond Knot (in their own backyard) do with their IPA's and re-think Redhook's version."
"Redhook makes a great IPA. Had it on tap when I visited the brewery up in Portsmouth, NH, also have had from the bottle many times. It has a clear light amber appearance with a clean look. The aroma of hops is very apparant and it provides that necessary crispness and all around hoppy mouth feel. Its a very refreshing beer and will leave you asking for another before you reach the last sip."
"Comments: A poor example of an IPA, but by no means a bad beer. To be sure, a rather respectable APA. I wouldn't go out of my way for this, but would happily drink it again."
"Not much superlative to say about this beer, a below average IPA from the Pacific Northwest. Pours amber with a medium white head that leaves a trace of lacing. Aroma is sweet, grainy and with just a touch of citrus hops. Flavor is also sweet with only a slight hop bitterness. With a watery body, this IPA has been bested by other brewers in the region."
"I am not a big fan of IPA's but I am trying to be. This is a great starter IPA, not huge hop flavor but enought to let you know what style it is. It has great flavor. The apperance was average. Nothing Redhook should brag about but the taste is good. I definitely enjoyed it. I probably won't buy it again, at least soon, I would like to try a more heavy duty IPA."
"IPA? The only IPA characteristic was the lingering bitterness that was not overly pleasant. Aroma was faint with little suggestion of hoppiness. Taste was just adequate, with a less than pleasant moutfeel (oily?). Drinkability was just avearage. I wouldn't hoist down too many at a sitting. Unfortunately, I was taken in by the fact that this was a Washington State Brewery and I had good luck with Northwest offerings previously. This twelve pack will go a long way."
"Appears copper amber hue with an off white cream colored head that leaves even solid rings of lacing throughout the pour. Aroma contains faint citrus pince hop aroma with a slight buttery touch of malt to it, the aroma overall seems a bit toned down for an IPA. Taste has some off metallic along with a lot of bitterness only with minimal malt sweetness detected to balance the bitter flvor, in my opinion this beer just didn't taste good. Mouthfeel is thin a bit watery in fact, not impressed but I don't expect much from Redhook these days. Drinkability from this mass produced IPA is I will pass and go for a classic representation like a Hop Devil."
"Pours crystal clear light amber, medium white head quickly diminishes, leaving small spots of lacing. Aroma is sweet & malty, with some graininess and hints of hops. Flavor starts sweet, middle and end have mild bits of hops. Palate seems a bit thin and watery to me. I remember this being much better before, but it my just be my tastes changing...and entirely average IPA."
"This pours a perfect clear 18 Karat Gold color that has tinges of orange to it. The head is a lofty off white color that is about the consistency of shaving cream. The nose is a sweet malt with hops that reminds me of a pine forest after a rain. The contrast between palate and nose is remarkable and well balanced. Red Hook knows hops. There is a very pleasant effervescent and dry malt flavor followed by an explosion of delicately balanced and aggressive hops. The hop flavor rolls in like the tide to leave a pleasant bitter aftertaste."
"I could hardly detect a smell, maybe a slight citrus-sour smell, and I ended up with a wet nose trying to find that. The taste was ok, definitely better than its buddies on tap, with kind of buttery or even oily feel. I couldn't detect too much bitterness, except a little at the finish. It was very light and almost watery tasting, without too much flavor. The lightness of the beer allowed for a high drinkability, as I could see myself downing a few, very cold, on a hot day."
"The beer has a fruity palate with overripe red dessert apples and a grassy hop over a dead thin buttery body."
"Quite disappointing in the mouth. Comes across as thin, with very little malt presence, and nowhere near the expected smack of hops. Slight hint of the alcohol as the pint warms. Waste of a really nice smelling beer."
"Drinkability: Not as bad as expected. It not a beer to drink when you want something to think about. More of a ""grab-n-go"" beer when the the mind is in neutral and a beer is all you want."
"Ultimately, this a beer that I would enjoy pretty cold to chase a long bout of gardening or other hot work or play. When it begins to warm, there is not much to recommend it as repeatable in other situations."
"I'll note that it was very easy to drink, and somewhat refreshing on what was getting to be a warm day."
"The taste is nice, not very complex. Lightly toasted malt and easy cascades make up the bulk of the flavors, with a bit of butterscotch rounding thing out. The citrus bite is there, but very subdued. The body of this beer is on the thin side but actually compliments the overall beer fairly well. The biggest problem with this ale is the HUGE letters I. P. A emblazoned on the label. It has already been noted in other reviews, but I will continue to beat a dead horse by saying this is not nearly a big enough a beer to truly be called an IPA. That is the problem. I bet this beer would get better reviews if it had its original name ""Ballard Bitter"". For me, if you don't hold it to it's misplaced stye category, it's actually quite a nice, easy drinking beer, and I think fits the bill fairly well if called simply a bitter, because that is what it is, a nice American bitter. I have no problems with this beer other then the name."
"It pours out to a pale lagerish yellow/amber color with a one inch fluffy head. There's not much of an aroma, more butter than hops. Hmmm, this is a half decent american pale ale maybe, but definitely not an IPA. It's kind of buttery diacetyl again, definitely not a welcome taste to me when enjoying an IPA. The hops show up in the finish with some crisp bitterness. So yeah, an average pale ale to say the least, not an IPA."
"Really doesn't taste like an IPA to me at all....the nose is sweet and perfume like...the taste is ""buttery"" and slick...now I don't mind some of that in an English Pale Ale, but a West Coast IPA should have some citrus hops in it and this has none of that....It does have some faint bitterness on the long finish but it's not a good bitterness...body is on the thin-side of medium...I'd never buy this beer again....one of the worst IPA's I've tried..."
"Pours a deep gold with a thin white head. The head fades to a thin lace. The aroma is hops, maybe a slight hint of citrus. A nice balance with the malt. Nothing overpowering. The taste is a mild malt start with a rush of hops in the end. Again it seems to be balanced. This is a bit above average IPA. A good IPA for someone to start trying this type of brew. It is very drinkable. Your taste buds dont get hammered as much as some of the other hopper IPAs on the market."
"Pale amber gold, slightly hazy with a sprawling thin head of little duration and little lacing, as well. Aroma is slightly orange and with a sense of a greasy corny butteriness. Flavor is pretty subdued for an IPA, not hop infused and the malts have an over ripe pear and pollen like sense early. A better sense of bitter at the close. Decent balance but not much of an impression on either side of the hops or malt aisle. Not an awful beer but not one I would pick up if there's much of any choice at all."
"There is a thin white head that dissapates quickly. A nice color though which is a robust golden color without any redness. Distinct cascade hops flavor with just enough malt to balance. Mouthfeel is dense enough let you taste the hops without being as heavy as an average stout. Leaves a bitter aftertaste for a few seconds to finish with an average cleanness. A mediocre I.P.A. that displays the flavor of Cascade hops yet i believe it needs work on the yeast and the water profile as i do not think that these two ingredients are the best choice for an I.P.A."
"Pours a very small head and looks very light. Almost like a Foster's. Surprisingly rich aroma. Smells primarily of vanilla. Also smells of hops. Tastes ok. A little metallic. Pretty bitter. A little too much going on here. Nothing consistent. Fairly drinkable. Tastes ok and is not too heavy, but the aftertaste is neither offensive nor appealing."
"Light amber with a slight haze partially from the copious suspended particulates. Well retained vanilla white head leaves sparse lace. Faint citric hops in aroma are overrun by buttery, movie popcorn like diacetyl. A metallic twang manages to burst through the fake butter, lending a Genesee Cream Ale meets an old Boddingtons ""The Cream of Manchester"" impression. Offputting in aroma. Nearly as pronounced as the aroma suggests, diacetyl carries through into flavor and dominates, overriding most malt presence with the exception of token biscuit character. Hop bitterness is thankfully left unhindered, but itself is too understated to provide much balance. Lightly bodied, with a butter influenced mouthfeel that is perceptibly oily. Diacetyl stresses and weighs heavily on the palate. Subdued non descript citrusy hop flavor. Suggestion of margarine and citrus zest emerge late. Finishes agreeably abrupt. Would you like some beer with your butter? Although the diacetyl manages to integrate well in their ESB, it is overbearing in Redhook IPA. Would pair well with salty movie popcorn, but on its own tastes like Sierra Nevada meets I Can't Believe It's Not Butter. Almost foul. Bottled on 12/23/02."
"looks like straw - makes me scared of what is to come. smell is nice enough, citrusy. taste is just plain bad. way too attenuated - any malt flavor quickly disappears and leaves a bad bad flavor on the tongue that I have a tough time describing, perhaps a little bit of old hops with some tannins? feel is wicked thin. It will be a while before I give this beer another chance."
"This beer is typical of other Redhook offerings Ive had--not bad, just nothing to rant and rave about."
"Update 3/6/08: Pours out clear with a slight chill haze, forming a tall rocky white head with very good retention and solid whipped sheets of lacing. Suggestion of English style hops with that ruddy mustiness, now finishes with a distinct rotten apple/rotten grape flavor, like something you would spit out if in were in a fruit cocktail. Drier than most other IPA's. Ratings remain the same."
"I am usually a fan of IPAs, but this seems a bit weak to me. Not much of the hoppy character I love my IPAs to hold. In fact I'd go so far as to say this isn't an IPA at all. Another run of the mill pale ale. Average on all acounts. I'm generally a fan of Red Hook brews, but this one does not hold up."
"I've heard so much bad about this IPA that I have never tried it before. There were a few slipped in with a 6 pack I bought of porter to make beer bread. If my truck didn't burn more gas than Saddam during a war, I would have drove back down and returned them for a real beer. This beer pours a white head and a real pale color. This beer has almost no malt taste and no hop taste, just bitterness. Come on, most IPAs have some hop flavor like citrus or something but this beer has nothing. It's like drinking bitter water. Oh well, it's better than the beast but that is pretty bad when you're a microbrew."
"I've had much worse from much more respected labels."
"It was fine to wash down some steak tips and sides but not a beer I’d drink alone just for the sake of drinking beer."
"Blindfold BAs and ask them what style this beer is and IPA will be low on the list. Some beers defy style yet make for a damn good beer. This isn't one of those. Whether classified as an IPA, ESB, or Pale Ale, this is just north of macro quality. It looks decent but light for an IPA, a yellow-gold with a white head that fades and leaves no trace on the glass. Although the bottle proudly announces that it's ""extra hoppy," it doesn't hold up well in the hop department when compared to IPAs from Stone, Alesmith, or a host of other breweries. An unexpected trace of butterscotch is present in the taste, but overall it's on the bland side. The mouthfeel is light, but it's the kind of beer you could probably drink all day if nothing else was around."
"Pours a hazy deep golden color with a creamy and bubbly white head that fades into a patchy and sticky lace. Nose is sweet and quite floral with notes of fresh malts and honey. Taste is almost too sweet at first followed by some bitter hops notes, however, more hops are needed. Fairly light in body with a crisp and dry finish. A decent beer, but there are many superior IPAs to be had."
"Above average carbonation. Pleasant bitterness and a background of sweet malt and graininess. There are certainly better beers around, but this ones pleasantly drinkable."
"beer is a clear orange and looks flat. The only hint that this is not yesterday's dead soldier is the slight lace around the top of the glass.Smell is mostly floral hops with slight matliness that is not detected in the taste. Taste is all hops(but not that strong), with no other flavors really jumping out at me. I guess that's why it's an IPA. Not quite as hoppy as I'd expect. This is an average IPA"
"If one pretends this is a pale ale then it's O.K., but this was a very weak interpertation of the style. Pale color, head and lacing decent. Very weak aroma and taste for the style, mouthfeel is rich and full and it went down easy, but... The original name is Ballard Bitter, if it had remained that I would have ranked it higher, as would many other advocates."
"Hop bitterness that finishes out a smooth mouthfeel is really the only characteristic to distinguish this from beer that really isn't good. Slight acidic/metallic aftertaste as well. Drinkable, but IPA's are usually much better and I expected more from this."
"Brilliantly floral hops and savage, yet invigorating bitterness and acidity. Stunningly light body, with amazing length. This beer needed a larger, maltier frame to support the bitterness and the aroma, something was missing. All that being said, I liked it and is my chocie for a ""light beer"". The most bitter beer I have yet found being sold in Japan."
"This beer poured reddish gold color and formed a white head that left trace lace. A light aroma of malt and hops. A flavor of malt, hops and a little carmel. A slight bitter, yet astrigent finish to this beer. There is just nothing terribly impressive about this beer."
"Clear light copper with a quickly dissipating head that leaves some lace on the glass. Aroma and flavor of caramel and toasted malts, grassy herbs, and a fair amount of bitterness. Quite acidic. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but a little thin, however. More of an English IPA in my opinion, and a good, if unspectacular example."
"Pours clear pale golden color, with a small white head. Musty flowery and weak citrus aroma, light grapefruit and sour apple flavor, crisp but has a watery and thin mouthfeel, a very mild hop bite, not very flavorful but I have to admit it is very drinkable."
"Hazy golden appearance.  (The tone of gold you'd expect in a helles lager.)  Not much of a head to speak of.  Very little on the nose.  Some slight perfumey hop aromas and also a staleness.  There's not a lot of hop tastes to note, but it is interesting to note that the beer doesn't have a big enough malt load to balance effectively.  The taste is perfumey.  Also raw pine needles (not the good pine effect that some IPAs have.)  Malt profile is really lacking to say the least.  There's a lingering bitterness, but not an enjoyable one.  Don't care much for this beer.  Below average.  It won't be dumped however."
"clear dark golden color with a few noticeable flecks floating around.  minimal head and no lace.  aroma of some hoppiness, but not the nose burner that one likes in an IPA...some pale malt too.  nice enough smelling.  mouthfeel is all over the place....first creamy then bitter then crisp but not necesarily a totally pleasant aftertaste.  tastes like a blonde ale with some extra hops, or a pale ale without enough hops.   just something wrong here...it says IPA on the label but it's not even close.   whatever style this really is, it's not that great.  probably better to use this beer as a compliment to some spicy food or pizza, and not as a brew to drink by itself."
"Pours a nice golden color with a thick white head.  Tastes nice with a good amount of hop bitterness.  a pleasant IPA.  this stuff just came out of nowhere and now it is on every grocwery store's shelves in my town.  Not a bad beer"
"Pours without a huge head, but enough to entice the lips to join it. Some, but not a signifigant amount of lace stains the internal edges of the glass. Nice copper color with a scent that's hard to distinguish. Sort of hoppy, yet not real hoppy. Maybe a little bit of citrus, but not too citrusy. This beer had an unoverbearing flavor of hops in the taste also. This is one IPA that will play well in the minor leauges, but doesn't stand a chance with the big boy IPA's such as Bridgeport, Terminal Gravity, or Stone's Ruination."
"This Redhook product has a problem.  It is not as good as a quality micro or craft beer.  It is unquestionably better than a macro.  So when should I drink it?  When do you ever want a second rate beer?  I guess that is why I hardly ever drink Redhook IPA."
"Presentation: Packaged in a stubby twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Re-review / 1 June 2007: The new double label is very nice; and it remains a ""delicate", really well-balanced and drinkable IPA. The head retention was much better, and it left a wide ring of lace at the outset of the glass. There's still a nice hit of citrusy in the nose, and I'm also picking up a bit of spiciness, and more citrus rind in the flavor. Very nicely done."
" I reviewed this beer when the ABV was listed at 7.2%. I see now that it is listed at 5.11%. That is a drastic change."
"Pours a very clear light yellow with a 2 finger head that dissipates into lumpy leftovers and is in the midde of the road as far as the head lasting.  It has a smell of beer aged in wood barrels although I'm not sure this is what happens with this brew.  It has a mild hop bitterness on the nose that tastes similar to maybe the cascade hops used in some of Sierra Nevada's own brews. It finishes slightly dry as far as taste and mouthfeel towards the finish of each swallow.  Not a bad brew but not great.  Cheers!"
"Pours very clear with fleeting head.  Muted aromas and relatively lack of body.  First notes are sweet, then moving to bitter.  Reasonably drinkable but a tad oily."
"Some floral fragrance, some sweet notes along with a nice bitter, makes for a rather refreshing brew. The top neck band label on my bottle has alcohol 6% by volume and poured out a fair amber with a somewhat thin head. Looks aside, I found the brew refreshing, tasty, and satisfying."
"Musty hoppy nose. pale in color with a nice white head and lace. Nice hop bitterness in the taste with a bitter finish.. it does lack body.  The mouth feels a little thin, overall this is an average IPA..."
"If it's an IPA it's a weak one. Definatly hoppy but in a Fisher-Price my first IPA sort of way. And there was an oily residue that was more noticeable than the taste."
"Not a bad IPA, but not a distinguishable one either.  Pours a clear, filtered golden, looking like a macro lager.  Hops are present from start to finish, but don't blow you away.  A very average IPA.  IPA's are a style that most micros seem to do a good job on, so choose this if its the only thing around."
"From the bottle. Fresh and exceptionally clear. Chemical in its undertaste and body. A decent lemony attack, but a bland profile in all. My understanding is that they originally had a bitter called Ballard Bitter - which actually wasn't all that bitter, keeping in the tradition of British bitters. Then they dumped some hops in it and called it IPA. It's most likely been simplified in recent years. Not recommended since there are better American IPAs (and bitters, for that matter), and Redhook is capable of making superior brews (the well-known ESB, or the nourishing Rye, a personal favorite). I like my ales on the warmer side, but I think this one needs to be served very cold. It has that garbage-y ""beer"" smell - you know the one I mean; think of your apartment the morning after a big party."
"Clear yellow, slightly ambered.  Highly carbonated.  Head dissipates quickly.  Fruity on the nose.  Conflicting flavors of sweet malt, sharp bitterness, and something sour.  On one hand I want to give high marks on such a unique flavor, but on the other it seems like there isn't a 'flow' of flavor moving from one sensation to the next.  It's more like a scattered/random/jumbled mix of flavors.  Worthy of a taste test none the less."
"Beer drinkers of the world ... this is not an IPA, and it's a pretty crappy beer to boot."
"Weak IPA."
"Pretty much a middle-of-the-road IPA.  Substantial body with a crisp, hoppy middle, but the finish seemed blunt with no particular character to the hops.  Perhaps I'm getting too used to ""American"" IPA's and more distinctive hops."
"I never really liked this beer.  I like IPAs but this one gives me Bitter Beer Face (ala Keystone Light commercials) due to its imbalance."
