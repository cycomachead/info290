There was no trace of maple syrup in this, and no malty goodness like you get from 90 Minute either. The finish was somewhat tart, too, which was unexpected. Unsure if this was an outlier given previous reviews, but it was not enjoyable and, I hate to say, went unfinished.","LouZ","Mar 24, 2015"

Pours a nice clear amber with a fairly thick pale wheat head. Hoppy, lively flavor is more fruity than bitter and has a subtle maple syrup note but is not too sweet. Smooth texture has good body and fizz. Love the label on this version! Another winner from Dogfish Head.","Cyberkedi","Mar 23, 2015"

Good malt to hop transition but more on the malty side for my tastes.  Can definitely taste the maple syrup bitterness at the end.  Good beer.

4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"750ml bottle served in a shaker pint.  Pours an orange-gold hue with a dense, three inch, off-white head.  Head eventually settles into a lumpy, half inch froth, leaving thick textured clusters and clumps of lacing as the beer recedes.  Nose is malty sweet with some notes of citrus zest and a hint of something floral/herbal in the back.  Taste follows nose - malty sweetness attributable to the maple syrup coalesces nicely with the hops profile.  Citrus notes are bright and juicy on a toasted malt backbone.  It almost comes off as an American Barleywine with a slightly lighter body.  Mouthfeel is light-medium with a balanced, even carbonation.  Texture is slightly oily.  Overall, a very interesting beer - nice complexity and I'd be curious to see what a little time in the cellar does.","Jwale73","Mar 02, 2015"

Aroma is of yeast, bread, crackers, some citrus and herbs/flowers.   Taste is somewhat malty - crackers and biscuit, combined with a little bit of citrus and very little bitterness.  Mouth feel is dry, refreshing, nicely carbed, with just enough body to give it substance.  Overall, a pleasing beer that really does convey the feel of being a blend of 90 minute and 60 minute.

Taste is definitely hoppy with lots of grapefruit and grapefruit rind. The maple is very subtle but adds just the right amount of sweetness to balance the hops quite well.

3.76,-9,4,3.5,3.75,4.25,3.75,"O:  I'll say this, 75min is an exercise in compromise, and while it is a solid IPA, I'm not sure it is necessarily better than it's component parts.  90min is one of my higher rated IPAs (admittedly, a style category that I'm not the most fond of) and one common knock against it that I often hear is that it is too sweet (I personally don't mind the sweetness).  On the other hand, 60min is a solid IPA, but without the same intensity or complexity of the 90min.  75min splits the middle - hop forward, not to sweet, but with enough balance between the two.  Unfortunately, the addition of maple syrup seems to fall flat - it didn't have the kind of impact on the palate that I was expecting, and there wasn't any real noticeable maple flavor at all.  The bottle conditioning, however, was a nice twist, and the mouthfeel was one of the better aspects of this beer.  Worth a try, sure, DFH's quality at least earns my money for one bottle, but I'm not sure I would reach for this again over the 90min.","Buschyfor3","Dec 31, 2014"

Slightly cloudy, golden hue, slight reddish tinge.  Big burst of maple, roasted malt, caramel and citrus and grass hops in the nose.   A bit of apple and dragon fruit.  A sweet beer in general, with some bitterness in the center of palate.  Well-carbonated, smooth, fairly full-bodied for an IPA, with a long fairly bitter finish.  You gotta love DH...they really make it work.","PacNWDad","Dec 18, 2014"

It has more malt than I personally prefer. Others may like that it's balanced out. Over all, the maple is rather subdued and not featured as much a I expected. At least not for me. Overall, has all the other redundant IPA characteristics. 'Bitter, citrus, earthiness.... Etc' None jump out. Was ok, but left me with a flat impression~","BrewUSA","Nov 08, 2014"

4,-3.1,,,,,,"Appearance is a darker shade of amber with a vintage white, inch high fluff of a head. Aroma is sweet, a bit reminiscent of brown sugar, along with the obvious citrus hops coming through. The flavor itself is intensely bitter and coarse, much more so than expected, and carries that 'resinous' characteristic. The maple syrup aspect is perceived to my tastebuds more like a molasses flavoring, and the finish comes with some heat. Recommended for major hop heads only!","Neorebel","Sep 10, 2014"

Just finished a 90 minute before trying this, and 75 minute is definitely smoother. Lots of citrus flavor. Maybe some smoothness from the maple, but not much maple taste. Overall, this is better then 90 minute.","kkleu357","Sep 08, 2014"

The maple really smooths out the flavor of the IPA giving it a much weaker hoppy flavor than I expected. Very interesting and a must try as with any Dogfish head beer.","Lemke10","Aug 19, 2014"

I just have to rely on others that say this is due to the bottle conditioning (because I'm not smart enough to know that). I don't necessarily agree with the comps on the side as this is just not all that hoppy. You can feel the 7.5%, but it doesn't overwhelm. I did pour it gently into an IPA glass and the head was enormous. I thought I messed up the first pour, but the second was just the same. Not sure if it was the glass or the beer causing this. However, after calming down, it was a pure treat to drink. I shared this one with the wife and the other will be shared with my drinking buddies. Well done, DFH!","stuckeyj64","Jul 08, 2014"

4.18,1.2,4.25,4.25,4,4.5,4.25,"Overall: I got home and realized this bottle was 8 months old. However, unlike west coast hop bombs with the same age, this held up very well in my opinion. I may be getting more malt than when fresh, but since it's apparently malty in the first place, age isn't a huge setback. I still think that if youre going to pay $10 or more for a bomber or 750 ml, the beer should be relatively fresh, or discounted otherwise. I would love to try a fresh batch and will definitely check the dates from now on before purchasing. Still a well made beer and recommended!","Bone53","Jun 29, 2014"
4.03,-2.4,4,4,4,4.25,4,"O-Enjoy this beer much more than 60 or 90 minute now. BUT blending both 60 and 90 worked out very well and the maple syrup used to carbonate the beer naturally adds a distinct flavor that helps to balance out the beer and create a entirely new beer in and of its self.","mikem0487","Jun 29, 2014"

There's the brightness from the 60 minute hops, but then the malt profile i associate with 90 minute. The syrup doesn't add a ton in the way of flavor, but it adds a little, and it makes for a great, unique sort of mouthfeel. I'd like to try this beer a bit fresher (my bottle is over four months old), but it's still tasting pretty good regardless. I'm not too sure it's worth $14 a bottle, but it's still a beer worth experiencing. I'd try it again if I saw it on tap or in a fresher bottle.","Alextricity","Jun 25, 2014"

The appearence looked pleasing. A golden orange color with a nice cloud to it. Many bubbles flowing to the top of the glass. It has a thick milky head that grew larger even 20 seconds after I stopped pouring. Not too much of a smell for what I had expected. I think the 60 min might smell more hoppy. No trace of the maple. Mouth feel and taste are average. No tongue numbness. And little carbonation feel. I feel as if I can taste more malt then hops. And no hints of maple anywhere. Not a bad beer in anyway, shape, or form. It not a great one either. Stick with 60min or 90min. Both great choices.","adami212","Apr 29, 2014"

The nose is typical dogfish ipa hops and malt with the pleasant presence of late autumn maple syrup. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy especially given the style. Almost wish it was a little fuller bodied so I could savor the taste longer. The flavor is everything the nose predicted, a perfect blend of hops, malt, and the earthy sweetness of maple syrup. I wish this was available more often; I'd drink it every day.","lochef81","Apr 22, 2014"

The appearance is a dark gold in color with a smell of maple and floral notes through out. The taste was very impressive with good floral and grapefruit in the beginning, with the sweetness from the maple coming in the end to give a nice sweet finish that was actually very clean. As the bottle warmed back up I felt you got more of the maple notes through out. If you are giving this as a gift or drinking it yourself, please, keep it at room temperature till your ready to drink and only slightly chill it. Still a great buy!","WhiteHillsStore","Apr 17, 2014"

To me it has a smokey flavor, malts, and with a hint of the normal Dogfish Head citrus arrangement. You can smell the citrus more than you can taste it.

Every once in a while the stars align, and it happened for us. 75 Min was born to be served via cask. Started off our night, and It was outstanding. All the special flavors characteristic of the 75 min blend just exploded in a sensual creamy decadent sipper.

4.1,-0.7,4,4,4.25,4,4,"75 minute IPA a beautiful experience thus far after my first pour, paired with one of my favorite all time cigars CLE cuarenta which is a beautiful diadema tapered at each end tailored for Christian Eirora's 40th birthday. Overall a great experience between the roasted tobacco notes and black pepper I'm getting from the cigar, along with a perfume like spice note this is complex tobacco. The beer looks super cloudy amber ruby hued with a light khaki tan head forming fine lace in my chalice glass. Aroma has citrus with a complex sugar layer full of hops and maple syrup partially fermented out. Barrel aging can't be ruled out this is a refined IPA less hop machismo than either 60 minute IPA or 90 minute IPA. Flavors collide nicely with oak barrel aging and hops on the horizon, super complex malts and sugars blend it all into a balanced beast of an IPA. Mouthfeel has bitter aspects with alcohol soothing the backend it doesn't finish hot but the alcohol is definitely noticeable wow, what a beer. Overall the perfect beer to pair with a complex cigar don't think you have to have a scotch or bourbon to pair with your cigar when there is ale out there this complex.","WVbeergeek","Sep 11, 2013"

What it really does is round out the flavors and add a balance to the bitterness as well as a floral/earthy note. It tastes as if they used a lighter grade of syrup, which was wise in this case. It's definitely become quite a different experience than a normal IPA, but one that is crave worthy- for me at least.","Georgiabeer","Sep 02, 2013"

The bottled stuff is made with added maple that adds an underlying sugar thats supplements the malt with a notable effect. ""Pub made"" 75 is a draw from 60 and a draw fron 90, and you get what the barkeep, not the brewer, measures by eye. Take it for what it is. Its not what they botle, but an in-between made up ib thy fly. Naturally in, consistent, its still a good bar option when you are in the pub.

It's juicy and then bitter, with the citrus dominating and, to my pleasant surprise, the maple syrup takes a muted back seat to the hops. Whatever role the syrup plays I like the end whole result, as an IPA flavored like maple syrup appeals to me in no way whatsoever. It comes off to me as a unique IPA with citrus zest. Of all other DFH IPA's I've tried, the citrus profile of this one reminds me most of the retired Squall. I least favor the 60 minute, but for a blend of the 60/90, this works. There's a puckering tart in the finish, yet doesn't come off overly dry. Nicely balanced, and with medium carbonation, and a lighter body makes for smooth sipping. Would like to see 6-packs.

The addition of maple syrup do what's intended in creating a smooth easy going ipa while still getting big unique DFH flavor across to the drinker. The balance and smoothness really go from how it sits in the glass to the last drink. I'm going on a hunt for more of this before its gone. I wish breweries would read these reviews because this needs to be in consideration for a year round spot. Put it in the same odd ball bottles, I'm not asking for a 6 pack of 12 oz bottles. I'm just asking that this particular 75 minute ipa is available more throughout the year. My favorite Dogfish ipa? Without question. My favorite Dogfish offering of any kind? It's close.

Light hop bitterness with lots of flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel.

A good IPA is not a concept that can be easily encapsulated by numbers but hand it to whoever thought to split the difference between the 60 and 90 Minute IPAs - I would take one of these over both of those.","biegaman","Apr 01, 2013"

4.68,13.3,3.75,4.5,5,4.25,4.75,"Poured entire bottle (1 pt 9.4oz) into a 34oz mug; cloudy bright orange-yellow with lively carbonation and a thick head from even a careful pour. For a bit, even in the huge mug there was almost equal parts head to beer. Smell is classic IPA; hoppy and floral, with a bit of sugary sweetness hiding in there somewhere. Taste is very much classic IPA. Clean and sweet up front, hoppy and bitter to finish. This one is quite tame compared to some of the hop-bombs being produced nowadays, very drinkable. The maple syrup isn't really detectable as far as I can tell, although that could be the source of some of the extra sweetness in the beginning. Mouthfeel is fuller and a bit fizzy, but clean. Big chunky lacing is left on the mug as it's drunk, a very pretty beer. Overall this is a great happy medium from DFH; it has the clean drinkability and hoppiness of the 60 minute, plus some of the body and alcohol of the 90 minute.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Mar 31, 2013"

Cloudy bright orange to yellow hued liquid, no bubbles visible. The nose is soft and actually unassuming, emphasizes sweet orange, grapefruit citrus, maple of course, pine sap and cocoa, smells like a bowl of fresh fruit with melon, grape, peach and apple scents, fresh and floral with nary a trace of bitterness and no booziness either. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied with a light fluffiness from the broad spreading carbonation. Has a drying texture underneath which sucks out the excess sweetness from the pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime citrus and peach, apricot, pineapple fruit. Here too leans on more agreeable pine, flowers and malted milk balls than hoppy bite, this causing the effect of a more easy drinking style but leaves you wanting in the complexity department. Sweet orange pekoe tea. The maple is there yet not really a major factor, could just as easily be called honey or caramelized brown sugar, just a thread in the weave. At times could be a sweetened oatmeal breakfast with a slice of grapefruit on the side. While quite nice, not something you’d especially remember even if you’d be happy if someone handed you a glass of it.","farrago","Mar 05, 2013"

The bottle version is a different brew- mixing the recipes for 60 and 90, but not actually blending the beer, then bottle conditioning with maple syrup. The cask version is excellent, the maple is a bit more pronounced, and the mouthfeel is dynamite, soft and lightly carbonated.

But as stated above, it follows the naming convention well, and finds a happy medium between DFH's two flagship IPAs. A well rounded brew, the 75 minute will not dissapoint in any category, but it will not blow your mind either. While it is a nice crossover from light and heavy IPA, I think it is rare that that is what people will be desiring, and I doubt they will want to pay the considerable price tag when 90 minutes are far cheaper. If you like DFH, try it once, but don't be expecting a new favorite.","Samuel906","Jan 27, 2013"

However, the bottled version while still very good is a distant cry from the cask version served at the DFH brewpub which I consider to be epic... The appearance and aroma aren't too far off, but the flavor and mouthfeel are a bit of a let down... Forgetting about the cask version for a moment, this is still a nice beer, but given the value proposition I'm not sure i wouldn't opt for a sixer of 60-minute or a four pack of 90-minute if presented the option in the future...","philbe311","Dec 07, 2012"

A slow lead in of bready malt and caramel leads to grapefruit, lemon rind, orange peel, peppery hops with a hint of floral hops and black pepper mixed in. A touch of tropical sweetness hiding in the background. Maybe the barest trace of maple on the finish.

4.28,3.6,5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, 2012 bottling. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 3 finger dense off white head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Very nice dense soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, pine, lemon, herbal, floral, grass, caramel, bread, light maple, and light piney spiciness. Excellent aromas with great balance and hop complexity. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, pine, lemon zest, caramel, bread, herbal, floral, grass, earth, toast, maple, and piney spiciness. Good amount of piney bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, caramel, bread, toast, herbal, floral, grass, earth, maple, and spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice hops flavor complexity and balance; awesome malt/hop bitterness balance; zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, slick, sticky, and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent IPA! Great hop complexity and malt flavor balance with the maple syrup; extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering as I expected.","superspak","Nov 27, 2012"

3.61,-12.6,4,3,3.5,4.5,4,"750ml bottle found at BevMo in Valencia, CA. Pours a highly carbonated, cloudy, golden-orange color. The head is fluffy, white, and slow-going down. Scent is nothing like I thought it would be. When I saw that this beer was brewed with maple syrup...I was expecting it to be the most malty of 60 and 90 minute. However, both 90 and 60 minute are more malty than 75. Weird. Scent is a bit underwhelming with mellow hops...and hints of honey. Struggling to pick up the maple syrup. Taste is...still no maple syrup. I think I enjoyed Squall much more than this. Hops...but lack of depth. Doesn't have that malt profile that 60 and 90 minute have...yet, doesn't have that hoppiness I love as a California craft beer drinker. Mouthfeel is great with the smooth, creaminess. Not too harsh on the bitterness. Overall, I would drink this one over 60 and 90 minute any day. However, I need to review this to the style. It makes no sense for an IPA that claims to be in the middle of the two maltiest IPAs I've ever had...to be not that malty at all. Again, weird. Tasty beer overall.","DovaliHops","Nov 25, 2012"

When I poured this into the glass there was a good amount of white head, but this did not fade fast. There were plenty of hops and malt to go along. The pine and citrus came through nicely.

Aroma of tropical fruits and light citrus, bready malt. Flavor is strong citrus hops with sweet pineapple, mango and citrus rind. Sweet bready malt with a resinous character that must be the maple, but does not distinctly taste like maple syrup. Finishes with citrus hops and a light syrupy sweetness. Well integrated and unique flavors. Medium bodied with active sparkling carbonation. A definite repeat on the rare occasions that I can find a bottle of this.

Aroma is solid. Lots of citrus. Big grapefruit note. Some tropical flavors in the mix - pineapple, mango. Some raspberries. Warm caramel tone in the background. More hop forward than I expected. Pleasant yeastiness. I'm a bit less positive about the taste. It's just a bit of a letdown. A little too subdued. The hop bitterness is a tad bland. The maple syrup-tinted malt plays a larger role than in the aroma. Medium sweet for an IPA. Not quite as much yeast presence. Mouthfeel is harsh and odd. Bubbles are too big and strong. The beer doesn't puff up all that much in the pour, so this came as a bit of a surprise. The finish is also kinda sticky. It doesn't ruin the beer, but I think I'd strongly prefer this one out of a cask. Just doesn't quite translate to the bottle. Still, it's a fun beer, and as someone who isn't a big fan of 90 min or 60 min (I did quite like Squall) , I rather enjoyed this beer.","popery","Nov 06, 2012"

Overall it is a great beer, another great brew from DHB and a buy again. Still preferable to the 90 minute but a great beer nonetheless.","ChrisH1024","Nov 01, 2012"

4.15,0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"This IPA had a nice soft citrus taste. It was not extremely hoppy, but the presence of the cascade hops is definitely noticeable. I had Dogfish 60, 90 & 120 minute IPA's and I favor this one the most. Unfortunately, it is very limited. If you enjoy an IPA that is not extremely powerful (ex. imperial IPA), I would recommend drinking this. It's 7.5% ABV. The appearance has a nice golden/orange hue. I was expecting to taste more maple syrup because Dogfish uniquely use this ingredient when they blend the 60 & 90 minute together. However, I did notice a slight sweetness to the beer that I find enjoyable. This beer is limited and I suggest you try tasting it before it is gone.

As a “special” beer that is rarely available we were expecting more of a punch, but it is hard to say from where. For such a renowned beer we thought the maple syrup might have a larger role here, or that the malt profile would be denser, to back up a massive hoppiness. These things were hard to find, and while it may have been in our minds, we are having trouble seeing what all the fuss is about. That being said, it is a tasty beer for the style, and something we would be happy to slurp on the regular.","TheBrewo","Sep 06, 2012"

Both hops and malt are noticeable in aroma and flavor. The maple comes out at the very end where there is a tad of acidity. Body is medium, perhaps on the light-medium side. Despite the claim, mouthfeel is soft, but not soft as other bottle conditioned beers. A great compromise between West coast and East coast.","LittleDon","May 30, 2012"
3.78,-8.5,4,3.5,4,3,4,"O: Overall it takes a few sips to truly reveal the complexity of this beer, the first few I saw nothing special but as the drink progresses the sweet maple syrup and sweetly toasted grain lends support and balance coming though nicely and the hops become brighter. Drinkability becomes easier, smoother and more enjoyable. Reluctantly to say I don’t entirely agree with the “sometimes 60 is not enough and 90 is to much” bottle labeling. As with most instances of hybrids you lose the best part of the spectrum with the blending of the two. The 60 a much more crisper summer time treat, the 90 a more wine body and complexity with alcohol warmth, both I wouldn’t compromise for this.","beerthulhu","May 30, 2012"

Pretty active carbonation. Smell is full of tropical fruitiness and hops. A maple undercurrent flows through and carries with it the bits of malt, bread, and faint alcohol that get me going. Taste has an intense complexity. A mild biscuit malt front that is not huge but at the same time big enough to balance the huge amount of hops in this beer. Quite a feat as the carmel and crystal malt flavors come out nicely. The hops are superb. Tropical fruitiness, (mangos, pineapples guava) from the yeast and malt serve up a platform that showcases the dry hopping and wonderful primary hops. They have the lovely effect of being pronounced and balanced at the same time. There is a bit of melon juiciness. The maple gives a sophisticated kind of smokey sweetness. Finish is dry and somewhat long with lots of hops, oil, resin, and tropical grapefruit. A light biscuit and toasted bread linger. Feel is superb with a crispness that is wrapped in a velvety carbonation. A truly wonderful beer overall as it is delightfully drinkable and intensely flavored with a complex array of IPA staples. I'm getting more to enjoy now and cellar for a year or two as the bottle conditioning allows for that.","scootny","May 11, 2012"

4.23,2.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Got really excited to find a bottle of this recently. Poured in a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy, steadily carbonated yellow-orange coloring with a tall, frothy, light, big bubbled, white head that slowly settles into an uneven, chunky topping. Aromas of dry, peppery hops, subtle sugary sweetness, maple and caramel backbones, and a hint of citrus. Flavors are even more complex, with a hop forward presence followed closely by a roasted maple and slightly smokey characteristic. The backbone is a subtle caramel flavor, giving rise to hints of grapefruit and orange zest. The body is light, and added to the steady carbonation this gives the hops bitterness a slightly sharp feel, keeping the beer light and providing a clean finish. The aftertaste is a sweet and bitter balancing act, with the citrus and syrup holding down the fort alongside the mouthful of hops. The aftertaste is smooth, with a roasted sweetness that lingers just the right amount. This beer is delicious.","GarthDanielson","Apr 22, 2012"

I do pick up some woody notes, which I assume is the maple syrup. It has a slight, what I'm picking up as, an off-putting vinegar smell. The taste is nicely balanced between hop bitterness and malt backbone, however, I do pick up some small green apple notes. I pick up the maple syrup at the end of the sip, which I think is well done. Not too much to overpower the sweetness. Mouthfeel is on point and well-carbonated. Overall, a good IPA, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it.

I assumed that the maple was going to make a huge influence on this brew, alas I'm only really noticing it in the finish, The beer poured cloudy yellow, it has a taste very much like 60 minutes, a tiny bit hoppier but not excessively, you'd never notice the maplw syrup unless you were looking for it.

There is an alcohol tinge with piney note and slight woody maple in the last sips.

The flavor improves on a disappointing nose in that the hop character is brighter and more vibrant with a more fuller citrus and pine and earthy quality. Smooth in character, what I'd expect in the nose. The maple flavor is a little subdued but provides a gentle layer that is pleasing. Finishes with a lingering caramel sweetness and mild bitterness. Creamy and smooth throughout. Overall, a treat to try, I wish the nose was a little more pronounced, aside from that a good brew!","hopfacebrew","Apr 05, 2012"

The flavors are interesting as well. It's smooth and mellow. It's malt forward first with slight maple. The hops are there in almost an English style manner, very subtle. Despite not being ""IPA esque"" I still really like it. It's different and drinks exceptionally smooth. This beer is really approachable, and somewhere in pale ale territory with interesting treatments. The light and smooth mouthfeel make drinking the bottle by yourself a pleasure.

This is NOT a hop bomb, but a pleasant and remarkably well-balanced IPA, and it is more than just a combination of 60 and 90- minute. I like both but might like this even better than either.

The maple syrup really rounds out the taste, hiding any sharp edges that the hops might have otherwise presented. Very balanced. The mouthfeel is fantastic, it's got a relatively heavy body, but has the perfect level of carbonation to make it go down smoothly. The drinkability is also very good.

Aroma is nice, it smells like citrusy (orange peel, tropical fruit, grapefruit) and pine hops, and caramel and sweet malt. It tastes just like the aroma, like citrusy and pine hops, caramel and sweet malt. I didn't notice any maple when I first started drinking this brew but once I let the beer settle for a while, the maple did become noticeable in both the aroma and flavor (but it wasn't strong at all). Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy and slick with high but soft carbonation. I think this is a good overall beer. I have another bottle that I'm going to age for a while to see how it changes.

Even a gentle pour down the side of the glass generated a solid 3-4"" crown of foam that took a while to recede. Lacing is spotty at best, but no matter, this looks great. The nose caught me off guard. I guess when I read it was bottle conditioned with maple syrup added, the syrup was the first thing I looked for. I figured this would be malty and sweet smelling. Au contraire. This is a lovely citrus forward IPA indeed but but the slightest hint of maple. If you weren't looking for the smell, I dare say you wouldn't find it. The taste is awesome. The maple is a tad more apparent here, as is the malt. Still, the citrus on this is awesome, with a touch of pine. The mouth is unreal for an IPA.

Mild, weak aroma of trace maple and light pine; mildly soapy and and boozy. Flavor is less horrible than the aroma with hops taking a more dominant role and maple only adding a mild sweetness to the finish and slick texture to the body. Dry throughout the body, with pine hops and light bready malt body hiding behind the bitterness. More of an amped up 60 Min than a watered down 90 Min. Maple is a failure on the aroma, but subtlety in the flavor adds an unexpected pleasant balance and depth to the flavor.

The cask conditioning really smoothed out the edges here, and left a quite approachable IPA in my glass. Mouthfeel was on the thin side but still very drinkable.

Out of all the beers I've had at the alehouse, this has been the most surprising and enjoyable. The beer is incredibly smooth and the hop and fresh grain/bread flavors are clean. Great if you need a break from the bigger hoppy beers (but still want those hops!), and capable of displaying the awesome flavors of fresh ingredients that will keep people drinking. Definitely would have again (and again)!","chadmoe1","Oct 01, 2011"
3.82,-7.5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"O: Out of their very large and often zany line-up 75 Minute certainly stands out from the rest. I'd say its one of their best and most grounded ales they make.

3.88,-6.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Had this at the brewpub in Rehoboth. I was excited to give this one a try, as it was probably my only chance to have it. Looks a little cloudy compared to the 60 minute and 90 minute. Not a strong smell coming off of this one. Taste is good. Slight citrus bitterness with some sweet malt from the 90 minute, I'm guessing. The mouthfeel is where the real difference is. Very creamy. This one went down pretty quickly. Solid, but I like both the 60 and 90 minutes better seperately.","DrStiffington","Aug 25, 2011"
3.58,-13.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: As a mix between the 60 and 90 minute IPA's, this demonstrates characteristics of both. Since I enjoy 90 minute and think 60 minute is just so-so, this falls somewhere in between.","KickInTheChalice","Aug 24, 2011"
4.1,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"must say that it poured rather pungent for a cask brew. had a very long and deep finish of a well bitter IPA with a bit more definition. something about the abv was slightly off... a bit boozy. would have figured that would have smoothened out in the cask. pour was orange with a nice big head. very sticky. nose of orange citrus and flowers... brisk and fruit palate and a nice deep bitter. makes the 60 seem rather lean when set side by side.","rtepiak","Aug 19, 2011"
4.2,1.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Intensely bitter where it needs to be, meaning throughout the whole taste. It truly is like a slightly jacked up version of 60 minute or a toned down version of 90 minute, which of course makes sense. Strong bitterness comes from pine and citrus hops that balance out perfectly with the light maltiness. No resin, so its clean and refreshing, with a clean mouthfeel. Finishes fairly dry, and slightly gritty, adding to the overall intensity. If you like 60 and 90 then be sure to make it down to one of their restaurants and check it out.","chodinheaven","Aug 03, 2011"

4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"A rare brew when I first had it in 2009, with DFH only sending out a few firkins locally. Tentatively nicknamed ""Johnny Cask."" It's a blend of the 60 and 90 Minute IPAs, and cask-aged with a touch of maple syrup. Hazy copper pour with a moderate white head. Solid hop aroma consistent with the 60&90 Minute profiles. Tasty for sure, citrus hops, caramel malt backbone, but if there was maple syrup in it, I couldn't taste it at all...probably just gets lost in the mix with the malts. All in all, it really just tasted very similar to the 90 Min. Which is still a good thing, but I feel it lacks in uniqueness. Medium body, and easily drinkable much like its constituents. Very good brew overall.","Rifugium","May 01, 2011"
4.27,3.4,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it was an excellent beer. It was a great balance between the 60 and 90 and is my favorite out of them. Great middle ground between the two beers and it fits my tastes better than each of them individually. A very nice beer to start out the meal with.","billab914","Apr 13, 2011"
3.7,-10.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Had at the Washington Street Alehouse in Wilmington, poured from a beer engine and served at cask temperature. Aromas muted due to the low level of carbonation (light malt/hop). Hazy dark yellow with a medium head that faded. Hop flavor muted, malt backbone prominent, for an IPA it was balanced (serving from cask really muted the hop character). Perfectly good beer, but not the best for serving on cask IMHO.","schoolcb","Apr 12, 2011"

4.07,-1.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Johnny Cask, I was dying to try this at the brew pub and I had finally got my chance. This brew is a 7.5abv blend of the 90 and 60 minute IPA. The beer has a really soft quality to it. A pretty good foamy head that laces the glass fairly well. The color is a foggy copper tone. The aroma is a great it just spews hops. It's a really great IPA that's cask aged. Little Carbonation in it but it's got enough of a bitterness that it doesn't really need the bubbles.","Knapp85","Apr 02, 2011"
4.13,0,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"O - As stated in some other reviews if you like the 60 Min IPA and enjoy the 90 Min IPA but often steer clear of the 90, this one is perfect for you. This one has all the developed IPA flavors but without the punch of alcohol or heft on the palate. This is a good session-able IPA for me. Though, I have a feeling that this too would sneak up on me even at 7.5%. I'd order again whenever I'm at the Alehouse or at the Rehoboth brew pub.","tbrown4","Mar 28, 2011"
4.1,-0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"o - Overall another nice IPA from DFH; if you like 60 and 90 minute, you'll like this one. I liked it more than 60 minute and about on par with 90 minute. Some nice pine hops jump out the most in the smell, and the taste wasn't too bitter. Would certainly order it again and wish they bottled it.","mdfb79","Mar 28, 2011"
3.52,-14.8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I like the effort here (and would even try this again on draft) but the maple syrup addition just puts the sweetness of this over the top for me. This was just a bit too cloying for my taste but I could see how some others might like it.","Kegatron","Mar 24, 2011"
3.36,-18.6,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"O - I enjoyed this more than the 90 Min., but it still ends up being cloyingly sweet, with a huge malt presence that the hops cannot balance.","garuda","Mar 23, 2011"

A slight bit of oak as well. Taste is a light grapefruit hoppiness along with some warming alcohol flavor. Some oakiness along with maple syrup. Somewhat bitter. Very creamy mouthfeel.

This doesn't disappoint! It can be real tough to find a well-excecuted cask beer (it takes a great brewery, great handling, and a great bar). This was done right. Not cold, but certainly not warm. Not fizzy, but not flat. Makes for incredible drinkability and mouthfeel.","zadams1","Mar 08, 2011"

I'm not going to say that they are the best IPAs in the world because I know there are better but the 75 minute IPA is better than both the 60 and the 90 minute individually. I commented to my wife that it was rather stupid that they don't bottle this one. It's medium to light in body and pretty hoppy on the finish but without an aftertaste, the midpalate is populated with grapefruit and mild pine flavors. I really enjoyed it and would do it again. I wonder if the home version is as good. I should set up a tasting of 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 minute IPA to see what is the best blend.","drabmuh","Feb 28, 2011"

Brew is poured from the cask at near room temperature and is very smooth. The bitters are more subtle and smooth than its 90 minute bretheren. You get notes of the roasty caramel malts in this brew as well. Very good. I would put this a pinch above 90, and close but short of Squall.

Taste has a fantastic balance between apricots and hops. No maple syrup was noticeable, but certainly added a sweetness to the beer that brings out the flavor of apricots. Medium-bodied and mouthy feel. This beer was a delight to drink. Compared to 60-minute, it was sweeter, and the hop flavor was not as prominent. I really enjoyed the lack of carbonation on this beer. I think my rating on this beer was a little high, as it is a unique beer and tough to find on tap.","ToAzwethinkweizm","Oct 18, 2010"

However this leads to a very pleasantly drinkable beer. It has a very soft and creamy mouthfeel, has a larger head and better lacing than the 60 minute. Still very flavorful and flowery. The hop flavor comes forward more than the bitter citrus notes that are prevalent in the 90 minute. Additionally, this beer is sweeter in a floral sort of way over the 60 or 90 minute.","Spider889","Mar 24, 2010"

First taste if of the citrusy, piney and bitter hops, moving into a mellow sweet carmel molasses like taste... hints of raosted nuts as the big flavors clear. Heavy body, yet smooth cask beer feel on the palate, little sweet and bitter aftertastes. Decent beer, worth a try but nothing earth shattering.","rfgetz","Mar 15, 2010"

Heavy in body with great warming characteristics. This is my favorite DFH offering, an experience you have to take part in.","JRed","Mar 14, 2010"

Aroma is of citrusy American hops and caramel malt with a touch of earthiness. Mmm, I love 60, I love 90 and I love cask beer. This is a match made in heaven. Grapefruit, floral hops and nice biscuit malt combine with caramel and brown sugar notes in a super smooth glass of IPA heaven. It is really interesting how the two beers combined create something totally different. Maltier than 60, but seemingly has more hop presence than 90. Superbly balanced.

The aroma is of caramel malts with some brown sugar as well as a little citrus and earthy hops. The taste is fantastic it starts off with a caramel malt and sweet malt taste with hints of brown sugar sweetness. After the malt taste a nice citrus and earthy hop taste takes over. It is like a perfect combination of the 90 min and the 60 min. The mouthfeel is medium bodied. The drinkability is also fantastic you could easily drink these all night and continue to want more. There is more than enough flavor to keep you interested with nothing to dislike.","goblue3509","Mar 06, 2010"
4,-3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an clear amber straw with about a finger-and-a-half of creamy white head that laces quite well. The aroma is full of hops, mostly piny but with a nice bit of citrus and bitterness lying underneath. The taste follows, with those hops providing a boost of pine, bitterness and citrus (in descending order). A slight honey-like sweetness is subtly perceptible. The body is fairly moderate and runs quite smoothly, allowing for a pretty drinkable brew (especially if you're into hops...).","TMoney2591","Feb 19, 2010"

Luckily, this past weekend I had 2 pints of this elixir and it was quite amazing.. Pour has an amazing cascading fall in the glass and it is amazing.. almost like when you see nitro stout like guinness fall.. its really incredible and foams into a huge frothy head. Aroma is hoppy and sweet though kind of light. Flavor has an interesting mix between the floral hoppiness of 60 minute with the sweet, sugary backbone of 90 minute. Cream soda-like. Quite interestingly complex. Mouth is silky and velvety.. very smooth and creamy. Amazing. All around it is absolutely delicious and the mouthfeel is exceptional. Could be a bit tough to drink more than one as it feels a bit heavy when sipping. A must try.","BirdFlu","Aug 17, 2009"

Aroma is full of subtle hops. It doesn't overpower, but it is still quite strong. The taste is great. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be, but the hops are still there. You can also certainly taste the maple syrup that was added to the cask. As expected, there is low carbonation; also has a light body. This is incredibly drinkable. You could keep ordering these all night long. Very enjoyable. If a cask is tapped in your area, it is worth seeking out.","ToasterChef","Aug 04, 2009"
4.56,10.4,5,4,5,4,4.5,"It came with two thick, foamy fingers of eggnog colored head with fantastic retention. Color was a slightly deeper amber than the 60", but still with a fantastic NE-quality clarity. Nose was floral, piney, more in line with what I like in an IPA. Mouthfeel was slightly fuller than the 60"" and more malty at the same time. Actually, it felt like there was a power struggle going on atop my palate betwixt the malt and the hops with neither gaining the upper hand. It was on the finish that the hops became truly assertive. I got a spearmint flavor that lingered. It was not Life Savers or chewing gum prevalent, but it was definitely spearmint. It triggered a memory but I could not quite dredge it up - I used to know which hops strain imparts that flavor, but it simply eluded me. An excellent beer, highly recommended, especially on cask!","woodychandler","Jul 31, 2009"
4.5,9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is one of my favorite IPAs. I tasted this a while back and it was unbelievably good. I will skip the look of the beer and focus on the hop to malt to maple syrup ratio. Sweet, floral, spicy, and rounded out by the maple - it is really something! Citrus hops with floral characteristics meet the toasted malts and are enveloped by maple. Need I say more? The maple syrup is from Sam's father's farm in Mass.","DawnL","Jul 15, 2009"

4.15,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"On-cask at the brewpub. Mmm. Delicious. This is certainly my favorite of DFH's IPA series. And while it's just a mix of the 60 and 90 minute, I don't think it really tastes like either. It lacked the dry biscuit malt of the 60 and had much softer fruitier hops than the 90. The flavor started with a mild earthy note followed by a long-lasting taste of apricot, then lemon rind, and pepper with grapefruit and a vague citrus punch in the background. The aroma was a bit more floral with a hint of that biscuit aroma. Overall it was very tasty and very drinkable. Check this out.","tempest","Jun 25, 2009"

Nice and hoppy without the sweetness that normally starts to get to me when I drink a few of the 90 Minutes. Solid mouthfeel. Nice oily coating on my tongue. Very, very easy to drink.

Hints of citrus, floral and of course some piney hops. Taste packed a punch and made up for any lack of scent. Very citrusy with grapefruit rind and a nice bite from hops. Nothing overpowers on its own but all the flavors present themself at once making for strength in numbers flavor. Finishes a tad dry and bitter, perfect carbonation and deliciously crisp, much to my delight. Drinkability is scary.

It pours a light amber reddish color with a white head. It has a very strong piney aroma and the flavor matches. The hop bitterness is balanced by the strong residual sweetness of the 90 minute.
