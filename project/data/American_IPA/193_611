I like the full-bodied malt, though it's a bit too caramelly for my taste. Hops are indistinct--a little pine, a bit of floral character, not much citrus or spiciness. All in all, kind of a mish mash. The soapiness probably derives from the floral hops. Mouthfeel benefits from the oats, but I think that contributes to the soapiness too. I imagine my impression is in the minority, and maybe influenced by the fact that I just finished a Dogfish Head 60 Minute before pouring this Hop Ottin' IPA, but I don't think it's all that great overall.

4.08,2.3,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Bitter from the beginning, bready malts bind the hops to a pleasant first impression. Carbonation is lively, supports the straigh, dry but very refreshing character of the beer. Pine, malts and hints of honey add complexity to this hop fixated IPA. Hop is very citraic, bitter from the first split-second, gets mixed up well with the other ingedients, creating a very hoppy but balanced beer. Mouthfeel is dry, chewy, hop punches the tastebuds. Fantastic long hoppy aftertaste, with lime still being present. Still some sweetness prevails for a long time, adding a syrupy note, which creates a great support for the hops.","aleigator","Feb 12, 2015"

4.21,5.5,3,4.5,4.5,4,3.75,"Purchased as a single can from Total Wine, Tampa. Pours a semiopaque amber with white, pillowing head. Smells of tree-fruit, fig, berry, strawberry, and pine. Tastes like a berry IPA; lots of sweet, blueberry syrupyness followed by malts and caramel. Hints of dried apple and plantain throughout with ""Belgian spice"" (coriander/ginger/clove/etc.) and hops on the tail-end. A velvety body permeates sweetness throughout while the prickly carbonation that follows punctuates the hops and spice. The more I sip this beer, 2 things come to mind: First, that it feels like an American IPA & Belgium Triple hybrid and two, that it would go great with a bowl of strawberry cough.","CraigS119","Jan 30, 2015"

Taste is mellow toasty carmel malt upfront. A little underlying malt sweetness throughout. Finishes with an herbal hop bitterness. Heavy creamy mouthfeel. This is a very rich tasting IPA. And by that I mean it has a fantastic maltiness behind the hops and even challenging the hops for center stage here. Also the heavy mouthfeel. Maybe the drinkability suffers a bit, but this is a great, and unique, IPA.","burnstar","Jul 17, 2014"

Lots more malty, lighter on the hops, etc. I'll have to try this again if I can find it fresh, but with no date on the bottle it'll be hard. Maybe if I ever find a draft version.","jlindros","Jul 05, 2014"

Have had in both bottle and glass. Taste great high flavorful hops. Not your average citrus brew, though It still has flavorful of citrus, it also has a high range of nuts brewed and you can definitely taste. Overall this brew from Anderson valley is perfect and its really not available as much as I thought it would be as a la resident. So get your hands on a bottle","DavidLosAngeles323","Jun 03, 2014"

4.39,10,4.5,3,5,4.5,4.75,"I don't mention lacing or head when reviewing IPA's because I'm a firm believer that pouring these beers actually decreases the flavor and sometimes the brewer's purpose for the beer. Sure, you release aroma this way, but with this release comes the release of essential oils that the brewer intended to remain within the beer. Seeing that hops are the dominant flavor of most IPA's, I think every bit of the components of hops should remain in the beer, not get released into the atmosphere. Just my opinion.","arc0042","Feb 21, 2014"

I wonder if my bottle was older and/or had lost a little of its hoppiness, because I got a fair amount of caramel? Anyway, the looks and feel are pretty solid, and with a bit more complexity in the hops, I think this would make for a world-class IPA. As it was, however, I give it merely above-average.","spoony","Sep 15, 2013"

Beautiful looking beer. Smells of floral hops, sweet malts and I get a big waft of caramel. Taste is not your average hoppy IPA. I get huge amounts of caramel, dominated the whole mouthfeel and pallet. Mild carbonation and drowned out hoppy aftertaste. This brew is so amazingly drinkable and sweet. Such a great take on an IPA. I could almost session this beer it's so drinkable. ABV is well hidden. Overall, I'm extremely impressed. This shoots close to the top of my IPA list. I see mixed reviews but I find it hard to believe. The bros hit it on the head, it's world class in my opinion.","rjp217","May 15, 2013"

The hoppy smell is not up to par with a Dogfish 90 minute choke hold but super IPAs can get old and expensive when you drink often. Did I say 7.0 ABV - 6 pack cans for a lot less.

The nose presented with definite pine hops with a bit of malt and citrus on the background. On the first sip, I got definite pine to it, but it was quickly followed up with caramel malt with some toffee notes. The pine especially came through at the end with some citrus as well. The body of the brew was medium thickness and the carbonation was well matched. I was surprised that the 80 IBUs were so balanced by the malt. The alcohol on this was dangerously hidden.

The flavors are subtle and balanced, but it's really that bitterness that makes itself known as an IPA. I was expecting a bit more from the flavors. Although I think the malt and hops were balanced, I think they were both lacking a little bit and find myself wishing there was a bit more.","JaredKent","Aug 01, 2012"

It's got some caramel, bread and toffee flavors which somehow work OK with the hop power. The hops and a little pine come through in the nose and it's interesting how they lay pretty mellow upon sipping. Really great beer.","TheRealBigC","Jul 30, 2012"

4.5,12.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Had this as a session. Here's my simplified review of the canned offering; Super hot poolside gathering, 104 or more degrees easy. This beer went down effortlessly out of the can. Although not a most primary candidate to drink as a summer quencher, this went down smooth. I figure any beer released in a canned version is somehow worthy to be sipped as so. The bitter biting aftertaste worked well against the well-balanced malt sweetness. I need to try this in a glass for comparison. But based on drinkabity out of the can alone, I'm sure I'd enjoy it equally in a glass. Like others may tell you, this really is a great beer with which to introduce someone into the IPA style. Which means this is not as hop-head aggressive as it is refined and smooth. That said, there is a satisfying linger of bitterness. Nice.","TBoneJones","Jul 28, 2012"

In my opinion this is a really, really good IPA with a piney/pithy/cheesy hop profile and a nice English IPA like malt profile. Anderson Valley has really done a superb job of mixing both of these qualities, walking the thin red line that is balancing an IPA. A strong, sweet malt that somehow knows not to get in the way of the true star, the wonderful hops. In the end this beer just feels like the brewers stuffed it with wonderful malts and hops. Every aspect of this beer speaks to it's quality and the passion of the brewers. This is not my favorite IPA but it's a damn good beer and truly worthy of being called craft beer.","alexrichman","Jul 15, 2012"

This turns out to be the strong part of the beer. The malt is slightly sweet but firm, creating a smooth mouthfeel and swallow. The hops wrap around the malt, enhancing it but not overpowering. Tastes great and finishes extremely smooth, a great balanced IPAED, especially in these days as overhopped and overhyped IPAS seem to be the norm. A smooth, well balanced, and tasty IPA, great even if you're not in a hop mood(I wasn't). This is what IPAs should be, prominent flavor profiles that are still easily quafable.","djrn2","May 22, 2012"

3.88,-2.8,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Overall I liked this beer and I thought it was a solid American IPA. It wasn't as hoppy as some but it still had the right amount of bitterness and it was surprisingly balanced. This beer has Ok drinkability, I could have another one but after that I think I would be ready to move on. What I liked most about this beer the appearance and the mouthfeel, they were both pretty spot on. What I liked least about this beer was that the great citrus aromas didn't make their way to the taste. I wouldn't turn this beer down but I don't see my self buying it often, I can think of more then a few local IPA's I would much rather have, but the price was good and for some reason it was was cheaper then the Oatmeal stout that is 2% percent lower. This is worth a try for any IPA fan but I think the hop heads will be disappointed in the hop profile in the taste. This beer was pretty solid just like the other two I have from this brewery, I am starting to like this brewery, it seems like almost all the IPA's I try from Cali are nothing less then solid. You can be sure that when more of their brews make it my area that I will be checking them out, and I like the fact that the brewery is solar powered. Another solid brew from what I am now referring to as a solid brewery, good job guys.","StoutHunter","Mar 12, 2012"

3.59,-10,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5," Overall, a good IPA, but too hoppy to buy a sixer of and was the last of the Anderson mixer I had left to try. In fact this is my 2nd attempt as the 1st one ended up being shared with the drain as I was NOT ready for the hops the first go round. Glad I gave it another shot, I have a very fine line with this style as far as what I find balanced and palatable and what is a choke down/drain pour. As a rule I let IPA's breathe in a dimpled mug as opposed to the pint or shaker glass and I have this IPA to thank for that, much better the 2nd time.","Blueribbon666","Mar 11, 2012"

Smell is of malt and herbal and citrus zest hops. Taste is of bready malt and hops that lean toward the herbal side of the spectrum. A slightly metallic flavor comes out as well.

Color was a deep, shiny copper like the handful of pennies that I recently got in change. I have had many redheaded girlfriends, but the one with this color of hair was the one that got away. There's a tear in my beer 'cause I'm cryin' for ya, dear! A good whiff of minty hops brings me right back to my senses and this delivered. Forget Smelling Salts, I'm going to market Smelling Hops for the hophead who may be asleep at the bar. Ask for it on any street corner where the finer drugs are peddled. Ah, the old Iron Fist Wrapped In Velvet Routine! Eighth time I've fallen for it this week. I was initially like Mowgli in ""The Jungle Book", listening to Kaa hiss ""Trust in Me"" when suddenly, I took a bullet between the eyes! It initially enveloped my tongue in a sweet caress, gently working back and forth until WHAM! hops out the ying-yang and I was on my back on the floor wondering how I got there. 7% indeed. Hops and malt in a stunning interaction and looking at the dense lacing that remained, I wondered how I did not see it coming. I was distracted by thinking about that dame, I suppose. Finish left me satiated for the moment, but that feeling never lasts and I'm going to have to score again real soon, I just know it. Why, oh why, did I ever get hooked in the first place? BECAUSE I LOOOOVE HOPS, that's why and if you are awaiting real regret, hold your breath! I crave hops and this delivered.

4.25,6.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a beautifully clear copper color with a mountainous three finger head. Aroma is big dank hops. I get tons of resiny goodness and citrus on the nose. The taste is exactly like the smell. Tons of hop flavor and medium bitterness balanced by a nice buscuity malt. Mouthfeel is nice with moderate carbonation. Overall, a solid IPA. Nothing spectacular, yet nothing wrong with it. This might be my new go-to IPA. Stellar stuff.","hmf05","Nov 17, 2011"

Some fairly thick lacing sticks to the glass as you drink. Aromas of big citrus, orange peel, pine, caramel, spice, breadiness, and a bit of tropical fruits. Some nice aromas with decent strength as well. Taste of huge orange, pine, caramel, and spices. Big caramel sweetness on the front with a nice amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers for a while with pine, spice, and citrus flavors. Very nice balance of bitterness and sweetness in this as well. Medium carbonation and body with a very smooth and slightly creamy mouthfeel. No alcohol noticed in the taste or finish, very drinkable as well. Overall, a fantastic IPA with great balance, flavor, and drinkability.","superspak","Aug 19, 2011"

4.04,1.3,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Lookin' for a new source o' hops recently, and my local TJ's provided me this li'l ditty. It pours a clear copper topped by nearly a finger of dusty cream foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, honeydew, cantaloupe, mild caramel, and a pinch of cinnamon. I'm not sure why, but I find this aroma to be extremely inviting. The taste holds notes of grapefruit, orange rind, lemon peel, light cantaloupe, light watermelon, light caramel, very light greens, and that same tiny shaving of cinnamon. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation, and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very nice IPA, something I could easily see drinking pretty often.","TMoney2591","Jul 20, 2011"

3.79,-5,4.5,3,4,4,4,"The brew pours an exceptionally lustrous hue of bronze-amber and is capped with long-lived antique-white froth, depositing spotty lace. The nose is quite understated and offers little more than vague cannabis and evergreen notes; it is pleasant, but perhaps overly mild. The flavor is more well-rounded, featuring catty and woody hop notes atop a caramelized but unsweet malt. The bitterness increases on the finish. Feel-wise, the brew is just about medium-bodied and has a texture that is eminently drinkable; I've crushed my glass in no-time-flat. Overall, a decent and easy drinking IPA.","ktrillionaire","Jul 14, 2011"
4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured out with a bright hazy yellow color. The head with thick and white. The smell of hops flooded my nose with ease. The other aromas are citrusy and perhaps a touch of pine. The taste of the beer is good, The tropical citrus aromas carry over to the flavor nicely leaving a nice sweet and bitter finish to the beer. The mouthfeel has just a little bit of a bite to it. Overall I think this beer is pretty good and worth trying.

Doesn't seem like this one will have a lot of bitterness. Hmmm. Hard to describe the taste. I can say that it follows the nose. Very balanced. I really like this one.

4.17,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"( 39/50, 7% alc/vol, Home, relaxing after a hard day) When careful not to pour the lie, the drinker's eye is treated to a slightly hazed brass color. Its head is rocky and frothy, lacing and limming down to naught but a tiny disc at the center of the glass. Creamy, light orange-lemon aromas. Smells like a crème brûlée. Blueberry muffins. Nice alcoholic nose. Damn, reminds me of something… but what? A little light, but gets better every minute. I cant get blueberry muffin out of my nose. Delicious malted grain abundant in the palate. Slightly metallic acidity brings with it poignant bitterness of floral, dandelions and grapefruit, quite strongly. Very lasting and complex flavours. Second flavours shows a tad more sweets once the mouth is used to the powerful bite of hops. The hops reminds me of Alesmith and Stone californian hops: a little sea salt in there. The mouth is treadted to a nice fresh hops, strong and acidic, enough to warrant some Tums. The experience is calmed down by a much-stronger-feeling alcohol. Good, but not great. Tends to overstay it's welcome. One of the hoppiest IPAs I have had the pleasure of drinking. Tries to balance things out with what I call barleywinesque sugars, but ultimately, the hoppiness, although being it's main attraction, is overly present and tends to detract from the overall enjoyment of the drink.","iguenard","May 07, 2011"

The malt nose was also absent with only a subtle amount extremely pale/almost adjunct aroma. Taste was a quick amount of surprisingly tasty citrus hops but quickly changes to a let down of a backing body by the malt (a sweet water flavor) and a very dry and pungent lemon/orange rind bitterness.

This beer really gives Green Flashes West Coast IPA some competition. It starts with hop fruitiness from the cascade hop then has a long piney and sharp citrus bitter finish. It's so rich and thick with potent hops that it digs deep into your taste buds. It also gives a peppery resinous hop flavor and finish as well. The malt backing which tastes like toffee and honey brown bread is quite amazing. A lot better than most IPA's where they almost forget about how crucial it is to have a good malt flavor in an IPA.

The thick head is at least two fingers and seems to be melting down the side of my pint glass. It has a strange but good peppery nose with an earthy grass note. When I took the first sip all I could think about was some very bitter hops. Then the pepper from the nose followed with some citrus. Finally a warm felling of alcohol. What a wonderful trip through the taste buds.

I'm getting lots of citrus notes...mainly orange and lemon, followed by a sweet malt scent blended with melon. A very nice balance to this. The taste is not quite as good as it smells though. Initially you get sweet malts and sugars, but it's not really followed by all the citrus I get in the nose. The hops are more bittering than fruity and citrusy. As it warms up you get a bit more of the citrus notes and the beer begins to taste more well balanced (the bitterness mellows out). The alcohol is very well hidden.

The lacing really sticks to the glass. Loads of floral and pine hops in the nose with some caramel lurking in the background. Enticing smell. Taste is sweet, and really well balanced for an IPA. Crisp finish. As you drink it you get a pretty strong caramel malt presence in the body of the beer, though it never gets syrupy. The beer leaves you with a nice bitterness thanks to the hops at the end, if you're in to that sort of thing. Pretty solid mouthfeel with a nice level of carbonation.

The beer has a caramel and raisiny hint or two, has a bready grain in the background. The acerbic spicey bite is the deal breaker for me. The beer is medium bodied, sweetened slightly by some orange rind and orange burst, but the beer dries by the finish. The aftertaste lingers on too long.

The nose presents an excellent interplay between the hops and malts, never excessively sweet nor bitter (yes, neither is an apt descriptor for scents), honey, beeswax, sweet lemon tea, tree sap, graham cracker, wheat all intermingle peaceably. Full-bodied, same level of harmony in the mouth, the hops poke and jab but then dance backward to allow the mixed white citrus and hard caramel candy to come out. Yeast, resin and bitters with an herbaceous streak act to return the pendulum in the other direction. Carbonation level allows for crests and troughs.

The aroma was a blast of hops, grapefruit in particular with some other semi-sour citrus in there (kumquat?) as well as hints of pine and sap. The flavors were similar, but complex. At first I got the big, bitter hoppiness dominated by citrus. This was followed by some slightly sweet malt that offered nice balance as well as hints of vanilla. As the beer warmed up I began to taste what at first struck me as confusing but was unmistakable - hops famous cousin - marijuana. Kids, don't do drugs, but I'm no kid and I have. That was the aftertaste; I call it like I see it. The mouthfeel was a little watery and the body light but the carbonation perfectly smooth.

This beer is solidly bitter with a full hop flavor (mostly pine with a bit of citrus/floral) and a surprisingly strong caramel maltyness. This beer is relatively full bodied for and IPA but isn't terribly sweet. Carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is pretty good. I typically like my IPAs to be drier, with less body, a bit more hop aroma and flavor, and with a more subdued malt presence. That being said I still enjoyed this IPA and was glad that I was able to try it.","mnj21655","Oct 26, 2008"

Looks nice - a deep copper color with a solid head that leaves minimal lacing as it drains. Nose is hoppy, tons of fruity flavors floating around, as well as some light candy and brown sugar. Maybe a touch of cedar? Flavor's excellent. Hoppy as hell, but somehow stays balanced with just a few malty hints in there. Still - it's hoppy up front, hoppy on that tail end (with a solid aftertaste on there). Feel is nice and full, with carbonation highlighting that hoppiness. A very good beer, one I'll definitely be having again.","soupyman10","Sep 28, 2008"

Great hop taste here... floral and piney with a touch of citrus. Well rounded with perhaps a malted barley influence? Moderately carbonated with a resinous feel in the mouth.

Has quite a powerful aroma of rich and hearty hops that is offset just a little too much by waves of malt. The hops certainly have a large presence in the taste as well, but again are muffled by the malt character to the overall detriment of the taste. Alcohol plays too large of a role as well. I've tried this IPA on multiple occasions to make sure I wasn't crazy, and each time I ended up struggling to finish the simple 12 oz. A decent beer, just probably not one I will pick up again.

A strong citrus, wet hop aroma. I was not expecting such a strong smell. For some reason I thought Anderson Valley's beers were more subdued. Smells strong anyway. And the flavor was the same thing.

Delicious, potent hops surprised me since they werent nearly as up front in the smell. The malt and some grapefruit make an appearance and compliment the hops nicely. Bitter and dry from the hops.

Upfront hop presence offering tones of citruis, well balanced by a strong bready malt base. The alcohol started showed up in the picture fairly soon in, before the beer even warmed too much. Hops impart a good deal of bitterness, seems slightly out of balance actually. The flavour seemed to offer only the malt, becoming overly bready after little time. The hops seemed absent from the taste, while still imparting an almost unpleasant of bitterness to the mouthfeel.

Mouthfeel is maybe a little over carbonated and slightly acidic, but otherwise good. Very drinkable.

Definitely more of a pine flavored IPA with a bit of a chewy bread-like background to it. Aftertaste is somewhat nutty. Carbonation remains constant throughout.

What a pretty beer. The aroma here is nice and hoppy as one might expect, but otherwise not all that exciting. I'm not getting much else out of it besides the hops, and maybe some pine scent. It's nice, like I said, but not remarkable. But the taste is where it all begins to come together. The citrus in this beer hits you hard up front, under the tongue, and almost immediately. Very nice touch in my opinion. A very pleasant balance with the malt here is also noticeable. Finishes with the classic IPA kick in the back of the mouth and down the throat. I get notes of orange, lemon, and pine. I can also detect a noticeable alcohol presence here, but not so much that it detracts from the rest of the beer. This is a very nice tasting IPA.

The flavor reveals notes of sweet apricot, mango, citric/piney hops, a medium bitterness, toasted malts, and faint notes of caramel, chocolate, and honey. It has a medium body with very fine carbonation and, although it doesn't say it's conditioned, it feels like it is and there's sediment on the bottom of the bottle.

Hops hit up front, but don't knock you on your ass like I was expecting. The malt is there and stays a little longer than I normally like from an IPA. Hoppy finish.

A bit of light English malt emerges mid-palate to provide some balance, leading to a strongly bitter, slightly peppery finish. Body is a little thin for all the flavor that's present here.

The taste is definitely a hop-a-thon with the first wave being tingly biting pine needles which are followed with a bit of mellowness as the malt makes a half-hearted effort to balance things out....the finish is bone dry with a puckering bitterness. I have to go contrary to what others have said on this one, I feel the hops here are not especially well done but rather overly aggressive and dominant at the expense of much discernable flavor. Perhaps the variety of hops used doesn't agree with me but I prefer to get easily detectable citrus and herbal flavors from my IPA's rather than simply over-the-top harsh bitterness.","masikon","Feb 16, 2006"

The Smell was piney, and grapefruity, with a little peppery bite. The aroma was not quite as fat I was thinking it was going to be. The taste was quintessential West Coast IPA., with an abundance of pine resin and grapefruit, and more than a smattering of caramel malt. Very juicy and tart taste, and a quenching yet dry mouthfeel made this a very quaffable beer. The alcohol at 7% was a bit high for a single IPA, but it only showed up in moderate number of fumy intervals. Before I knew it, the whole bomber was a goner.","rajendra82","Jan 25, 2006"

4,0.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours reddish copper with a big off-white frothy cap of a head. Smells of floral and citric hops mixed with banana and fruity esters and a sort of biscuity malt aroma. The first flavor sensation is bitter piney hops mingling with some grapefruit and a nice spicy quality. Very hop forward with just enough malty sweetness to attempt a semblance of balance. Medium to full body, some carbonation tickle. Seems to be your run of the mill IPA. I am a true hophead but this leaves me a little wanting in the complexity department. Style points for all those hops.","gimmehead","Aug 06, 2005"

The aromas of this brew are mostly of floral and citrus hops, the floral seem to be more dominant but I am able to pick up both. Able to sense some malt in the nose but definitely takes a back seat. The taste is nice, I am able to pick up the malt even though it seems to show up and then disappear just a quick as the hops taste takes over and you can notice a slight alcohol taste.

Pours a clear ruby gold color, plenty of carbonation bubbles taking their time as the float to the top. I can't wait to taste this. I've just been admiring its appearance and smell for about 5 minutes now and the head is still rich and thick. Here goes the sip. This IPA is an extra bitter boy. It would be incorrect to say that the sweetness balances the bitterness of this brew, but after such a floral, hoppy smell and such a hoppy taste, my senses zero in on an underlying sweet citrus. Medium to full bodied, not very smooth. Kinda sticky and oily all at once. Beautiful clumpy lacing left all over the glass.

Immediately the floral aroma wafted to my nose, and I knew this would be a good find. The hops are evident, as is the piney untertone. The taste is delightful: wicked potent hops with a subtle sweetness that is hard to pinpoint. Nevertheless, it offsets the essential bitterness, but not in a cloying way. There's even some palpable breadiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium, with abover average carbonation. A very worthy choice for the IPA lover.","longpondbeerman","Dec 18, 2004"

4.13,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Tawny-coppery in hue with a bit of bronze-gold influence as well, the appearance of the liquid is attractive but basically standard for an IPA though. The head was off-white in color; at the apex it was almost two fingers in height. The foam faded to a tight cap after a few moments and lacing began immediately, in other words the collapsed head left a residue. This feature is always bonus eye-candy. Once I started quaffing the lacing bloomed, wow, was it webby and prevalent. Beautiful! The nose is hoppy; it is an IPA after all! Aromas from the hops consist of pine needles, spruce, citrusy lemon zest, grapefruit flesh, and just a hint of wild flowers. I could find, beneath the hops, the malt, which was caramely sweet with some pleasant toastiness as well. The potency is solid and the nose is inviting. It says all the right things but it doesnt say anything Ive never heard before. Am I jaded? Maybe but I still dig the nose, it is very pleasant. Kudos to the brewers for allowing a hoppy beer to show its malt backbone, nice! The palate has plenty of good things going for it. Hop bitterness is fairly strong, appropriately raw. I always appreciate an IPA with a malt backbone; this one offers a solid toasty yet caramel taste with just a bit of sweetness. Obviously the hops are the star with pine needles, spruce, grapefruit finds, and a healthy dose of wild flowers, especially in the finish. From beginning to end the palate offers one continuous taste, thus complexity is limited but it is still delicious. I mean there are no complaints about the flavor. It is an IPA and a good one at that. Medium in body, if not a tickle fuller, low but natural carbonation helps create a lovely mouthfeel. I found this to be a very drinkable beer, it is big and tasty but it didnt murder my palate or melt my brain with alcohol. Id love to sit back and enjoy a six-pack; maybe someday I can do it again (as it is not found in Nebraska but about everywhere else it seems?). I purchased a six-pack in Milwaukee, WI and Im enjoying every bottle (aside from the ones my girlfriend gobbled down). Worth trying.","bditty187","Oct 12, 2004"

I'm picking up on a lot of pine needle and sap tastes, as well as that IPA grapefruity taste, which I generally am not a huge fan of, but this one is pretty well balanced for being as overly hoppy as it is.

Hell there is even the head in the bottom of the glass after the beer is gone and I drank it fairly slow. Aroma is full of citrus hops kicking about and a bit of a sweet malt balancing out all the hop ottin going on in the nose. Up front in the taste is the sweet caramel flavor of malt before the grapefruit and orange citrus hop flavors come through. These hops defiantly dominate after showing up on the palette and dont relent until minutes after youve swallowed. A nice dry bitter after taste is present that is a bit citrus in nature. Excellent mouthfeel with a creamy coating flavor and good carbonation. This is defiantly a sessionable beer as I could easily sit and drink the 6 I have and want more afterwards. Very good IPA that I recommend to all and especially the hopheads, maybe I will figure out the antler bear after a few more.","meathookjones","Jul 10, 2004"

The mouth is very prickly and quite heavy or thick. The taste is one dimensional - strong espresso bitter from the beginning, dry and almost harsh. There's a touch of floral sweetness, but it is much too weak to provide a counter to the almost choking harshness. This brew is too sharp, unpolished, unbalanced. The aftertaste is long, but too bitter, rather like chewing on coffee grinds. There are much better.","Globetrotter","Jun 21, 2004"

Aroma is quite fruity and floral with hops, mildly so, determined yet subtle with malty fruitiness closing in on some melon and apple. Taste is fruity with apply notions and pear, floral herbs much like a tea are fairly dominant. Bittering is in check by alot due to the overwhelming amount of sweetness that actually isn't overwhelming. This has a unique balance, but the flavors stay fruity throughout.

I have yet to find an ipa with such a strong hop precense yet be backed up with a good dose of maltiness. This beer had a clear orange color to it with a luxurious creamy head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is of a fruity hoppiness, mostly grapefruit but also some sweeter fruits as well. The taste is strong on the hop flavor, esp. up front. Grapefruitness provides a lip smacking bitterness. Floral hops are strong as well and a sweeter element also takes place. Honey maltlike sweetness comes in the middle. I notice some nuttiness in the base. The honey and nut flavor never comes to the fore front but provides a nice mixture with the floral hoppy flavors. The finish has a definite alcohol tone to it combined with the hops and it leaves a dry, spicy finish. The finish lingers. Body is medium thick. I could drink this beer all night.","granger10","May 06, 2004"

This beer offers a full mouthfeel and makes its prescence known with a residual sweetness. Taste a complex creation of caramal malts and hops with a balanced sweetness and controlled bitterness. This beer had me thinking of an amber ale in style with some distinct hop character. Not a typical american IPA in my opinion as it reminded me of some very good English ales. A thoroughly enjoyable beer that offers strong prescence and flavor.","sublimesipping","Apr 27, 2004"

Lots of biscuity maly flavor is there to help balance it out as well. I'd describe the body as medium heavy for an IPA, mouthfeel is comfortably smooth with a little bitter bite at the end.

I don't want to stop sniffing, but I guess at some point I need to taste. Once in the mouth this isn't quite as hoppy as the nose would indicate, but it is damn tasty. There is a subtle malt sweetness & a bit of alcohol (it is 7% abv), but mostly just good old columbus. Beautifully bitter & and absolutely a top tier IPA in my book.

YOu can taste the honey-soaked malts in there in the middle, giving way to the hops in the end. sort of a bitter, sweet, bittersweet coalescence. This is a great interesting, intense, hoppy IPA.

Tasted slightly toasted, somewhat grassy and herbal with a flowery finish. It was somewhat dry, and some alcohol presence was noticed.

The taste, as the smell predicted was pure hoppy goodness. There were some slight traces of malt, but the hops dominate this one. Mouthfeel was solid. The alcohol is well hidden, I had no idea it was 7% until I looked at the bottle a little more carefully. Not the easiest brew in the world to drink, I would say one or two of these is plenty.

While this type of beer may be appealing to some, I found it to be just too one-sided. It had a very pleasant grassy-citrusy aroma, and the hop flavor itself was not unpleasant.

4.22,5.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Fine example of a well balanced IPA without going overboard i.e. Dreadnaught. Hop Ottin' poured a foggy dark amber with a sizable, fluffy, off-white head with many vallys and crags and delicate lace. The head retention itself was very long lasting. The smell was ridden grapefruit competing with a syrup/honey malt flavor, which was interesting considering the style. The taste was very bitter in the front with plenty of hops(my guess is a little bit of Chinook and plenty of Cascade, perhaps visa versa), There was also a little bit of malts(The smell being the place where the most malts appear), but this beer really showcases a very well rounded hop character. The mouthfeel was full and creamy without too much carbonation. Nothing from the beer could have indicated that this was 7% ABV until it had reached almost the bottom where some serious alcohol flavors kicked in, which is both nice and dangerous. Wonderful effort from Anderson Vally, too bad its so expensive.","GreatPondBrewer","Jun 29, 2003"
3.4,-14.8,4,4,3,3,3.5,"A very clear amber orange brew with an off-white head that is about 1/4"" thick. A floral hoppy aroma is welcoming along with hints of lemon and honey. Boy, this is a hoppy beer, not that I have a problem with that, it's just that it is more bitter than I care for. Leaves a metallic finish and so far, no showing of the honeysoaked malts as mentioned on the bottle. There is some lemon zing, it just feels like lemon juice squeezed from those little plastic lemons. I guess I want more malt flavor to balance the hop flavor a little. The floral hops dominate, just not the hop flavor I am used to, I guess. Not bad, but I prefer Stone's IPA. The bite does mellow a little further along.","BigHead","Jun 26, 2003"

This one was poured with a nice head, and it appeared with the same amber copper tone as the Hop Devil. After cleansing with some water, I began to test the aroma of the beer. Seemed mild, but as the beer warmed up the floral hops seemed to have a sweeter scent of hops. Great flavor that fulfills any hop heads desires and dreams.

The initial taste hits you heavily with hops, leaving a decidedly citrus/grapefruit taste behind.  After overcoming the blast of hops during the initial few sips, the malt of the beer can be discerned, although the hops still dominate the flavor.  As the beer warms (or my tastebuds numb from the hops) the malt becomes more evident and the citrus notes are more subdued.  Don't drink this one too cold!  The overall carbonation of the beer seems slightly lower than normal, which gives it a slightly silky mouthfeel that coats the tongue.   Due to the high hop levels I don't consider this to be an easy drinking beer, but it is definitely a good IPA and a great beer for ""hopheads"".","aaronh","Oct 18, 2002"
