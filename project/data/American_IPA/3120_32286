4.29,-4.2,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Love me some Nelson! And it's cool to see it with rye, in this instance mellow, but an often rather harsh malt. So much hype, rad to finally have one at back country in boulder. Pour is a really light pale golden color with an opaque orange lowlight and a lasting inch of airy white bubbles. Smells like Nelson alright, although somewhat less pungent and fresh than anticipated, and especially mellow for a top 250 IPA. The flavor is more dynamic than the nose, but also underwhelming. As good as it is, and it is real good, I wanted more from the hops. The rye is a real nice twist and can be both tasted and felt, but this lends credence to my theory that it's near impossible to make a bad beer with this hop. It just doesn't pip pineapple like others, and with such a no bull name, I thought this would be the loudest Nelson statement of all time, and it's not. It's freakishly dry though, so hops and rye do stand out, and there isn't much of a yeast profile happening at all. Carbonation is really lively, and I don't mean to belittle this because it is amazing, and a real nice use of one of my favorite hops, but it just doesn't stand out far enough from the heard to be labeled one if the best IPAs ever, at least in my opinion.","StonedTrippin","Tuesday at 09:51 AM"

While I'm not on a bender destined to succumb myself in alcohol poisoning, each sip of this magnificent beer has me calling out for a nurse. I'm worried my neighbors may think I've gone mad. I don't even know where to begin, it's so unbelievable. First off, the pour on Nelson is beyond reproach; only rivaled by Heady Topper. Brilliant orange, super cloudy, spotty lacing. Very excellent head retention. The nose has hints of white wine from the use of Nelson Sauvin hops, and is backed by tons of citrus. Taste follows with grapefruit and pineapple. So freaking balanced I can barely stand it, as if that isn't an oxymoron in itself. The mouthfeel is creamy as ever, and I can't stop smacking my lips. I never thought I would enjoy a rye IPA so much. This is a world-class, must try beer, especially for people like me, who primarily drink IPAs. Those who have access to this on a regular basis should consider themselves extremely lucky. Hard to find a flaw. JUST WOW!","weiserr","Apr 04, 2015"

A really enjoyable IPA that doesn't fit the norm and has a little bit of everything.","clayrock81","Feb 23, 2015"

4.51,0.7,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.75,5,"Overall, what makes this beer special is how well everything comes together.  That’s the thing with a lot of these high-profile brews; it isn’t necessarily one thing that stands out about it, but rather it is just how incredibly well the thing stands as a whole and from a distance.  The balance is amazing, with the fruitiness of the Nelsons bonding with the extended, lingering bitterness of the rye grain inclusions.  Again, nothing really stands out here, except for everything all at once…if that makes sense.  If we had to point out something surprising or particularly exciting about Nelson, it would have to be his feel.  It is soft, full, creamy, froth, and slurpy, pulling the mouth in every conceivable direction you would want it to.  What a happy experience this has been, making us desperately hope that the rumors about Alpine expanding to our local market are indeed true.","TheBrewo","Feb 21, 2015"

Nose is dominated by slightly tart citrus notes and pine with biscuity malt backing.

4.08,-8.9,4.25,4.25,4,4,4,"Overall - This beer reminded me, a little, of Deschutes Fresh Squeezed (similar citrus hop flavor). The Deschutes beer is superior, however, because it possesses more of a toasty malt flavor to balance out the hops. Also, I assumed that this beer would have a sweet malty English taste due to the name (Lord Nelson?). The beer has neither the color nor the malt foundation of an English bitter/pale ale. For these reasons, this is a good beer but not a great beer.","T100Mark","Dec 14, 2014"

Taste is a notch below the small, but still a high quality IPA, wasn't wowed by it based on Alpine hype.  Would happily drink this again, but don't plan to seek it out.","2dogbrew","Dec 06, 2014"

Super well balanced with huge hop flavor. Earthy, fruity, citrusy, and dank. Some grape in there as well, which is to be expected from Nelson Sauvin. Bitterness is right where it should be. Mouthfeel is unbelievable. The addition of rye makes this beer drink like milk. Really creamy and definitely a unique experience. Overall a fantastic IPA worthy of a 100 score on BA. I can't think of a better single IPA than this.","MisSigsFan","Nov 24, 2014"

Malty, rye with great hop flavor.  Not lingering, not overly bitter.  Quintessential drinking ipa.  Wish I could get this every day.","MLDucky","Sep 04, 2014"

This Rye IPA has a very unique hazy and golden color, not typical of other Rye IPAs I've had (Hop Rod, Ruthless). The smell is on point, I can't think of a better nose to a beer that I've ever had (Pliny is up there though). This sets you up for an unbelievable palate pleaser. Very very drinkable (got me into some fun last night) and not something you can burn out on. If you can get your hands on this, it's an unforgettable beer. A top 5 IPA for sure.","DannyBigs","Jul 26, 2014"

Amazing nose full of nelson grapefruit and nice carbonated bite with a very unique slightly diesely oily overtaste. Hops are the star of the show here with just enough malt to smooth it out. One of my new favorites. We hope to go to the brewery soon and try it off the tap. *** Highly recommended","hoppyhour","Jul 05, 2014"

Beautiful representation of nelson and it's earthy, fruity, dank hop character. The taste is where the rye comes in subtly but enough and provides an incredible companion for the so iciness of nelson hops. Such a balanced easy drinking but full flavored brew.

A slightly hazy liquid, orange-copper in color, topped with a finger of foamy white head; nice retention and lacing. In the nose, floral notes, some dank citrus, slightly composted rind, wet grass, some hints of toasted rye malt. The flavor was similar, oily citrus, with a zesty bitterness, grassy and floral, somewhat herbal, sweaty, some toasted rye bread, with a residual malt sweetness. Medium body, maybe even medium-full, but still retained a nice IPA crispness, which made it an easy drinker. Almost came off more like a DIPA than a regular IPA.

4.53,1.1,4,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Surprisingly light yellow/orange color (thought it might be more cloudy & orange, based on smell). Relatively thin fluffy white head, which dissipated somewhat quickly. Lots of tiny bubbles, and good/sticky/even lacing throughout the quaff. On the nose, strong pine dominates over grapefruit/orange citrus notes. There is a distinct dankiness to the nose, which becomes all the more prominent upon first sip. As the beer settles and warms, the beer becomes more hoppy/piney/dank and less floral/citrusy on the palette, which is fine by me (that's how I like them, although a little more balance would be preferred here). Mouthfeel is full and coating. Alcohol burn is subdued until final points of the finish. All in all, I liked this very much. A very good example of West Coast style (reminds me a little of Sucks in that regard). Duet is better, but Nelson is a close second. Nice work, Alpine!","JohnParadee","Feb 24, 2014"

Very accessible IPA.","artoolemomo","Dec 14, 2013"

Taste was like the smell but lacking a little on the citrus flavors, nice and bitter with good carbonation. Mouthfeel was smooth but not something that left me craving more with each swig. After drinking this side by side with Duet, I felt like this was a bit lacking. All in all, great beer from Alpine and will likely try it again if I get the chance.","ozzman54","Dec 08, 2013"

Massive aromatics coming from this, with grapefruits, sweet honey, flowers, more citrus, some creamy sweet wine like aroma as well. Not like anything I have smelled. Flavor begins with a light sweetness on the tongue, and explodes into raw hops, grassy, grapefruit, honey, melons. A nice bitter pine on the way down. The flavor has a pleasant creamy mouthfeel, with sweet honey and big juicy hops. So light on the palate, with medium high carbonation. Up there with the best of them, especially in the single IPA category.","BMMillsy","Beers"

4.42,-1.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Got in a trade with TopsecretWaffle. 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was traded fresh. Pours moderately hazy bright golden amber color with a 2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big mango, passion-fruit, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, grass, light pine, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of tropical/citrus hop notes with a fair amount of malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big mango, passion-fruit, peach, pineapple, tangerine, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of mango, passion-fruit, peach, pineapple, lemon zest, tangerine, floral, grass, light honey, bread, light rye, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible balance and complexity of bright tropical/citrus hop notes with light-moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible IPA! Fantastic balance and complexity of tropical and bright citrus hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jul 23, 2013"

The taste is balanced with bitterness and sweetness with a little bitter bite and a light spice from the rye. The carb is great for the flavors and the mouthfeel is just slick enough without being oily. Really well made and a great highlight of Nelson Sauvin hops.","PHBoiler","Jul 08, 2013"

The taste followed the nose almost perfectly, perhaps I've found my new favorite hop. The balance was near perfect with just the right amount of lingering bitterness. Part of me wants to say that I'd have liked a bit less sweetness, but another part of me thinks this beer needs it! Overall the aroma was the winner for me with this one--will definitely seek it out again.","dlello2","Feb 16, 2013"

Nose has a really bright citrus quality, Nelson Sauvin is obviously prominent, tangerine, mango and perhaps a bit of white wine character I've always heard to be characteristic of the hop. A kiss of rye spice. Taste has more vibrant citrus qualities, mango, white wine, and again only a wee bit of rye, but just enough to be identifiable. Light body, lower medium carbonation and dries out super quick once the hops have made their appearance. An awesome Rye IPA - had this next to a FFF Rye'd the Lightning - two completely different rye beers, but each awesome in their own regard.","liamt07","Beers"

Big tropical lush citrus with another note which jumped right to peppermint in my brain, but I can't really place aside from that association. Maybe some spicy and crisp. An IPA second only to masala mama in aroma. Appearance is average. Mildly cloudy orange color with a short white head that dissipates to a thin film. Very sparse lacing, almost none. Flavor is very tropical fruity as well. Lush and full, but does not quite live up to the world class aroma of this beer. There is a similar unique characteristic in the flavor which I cannot pinpoint, perhaps earthy, or maybe herbal, but not in an english way. Very balanced with a nice, but definitely not overwhelming, caramel quality. Mouthfeel is medium light and is lacking a bit of carbonation, but it is not so bad at all.","Agold","Apr 24, 2012"

5,11.6,5,5,5,5,5,"Picked up a couple cases of various IPA 's at Alpine on Friday including a bunch of Nelson. This beer is a golden with a beautiful dense one inch cap that has amazing retention and leaves behind serious lacing as I sip down. The nose, like all Alpine brews is a work of art. Sweet tropical fruit, Nelson Sauvign hops and malty biscuit round out the package. The flavor profile follows the nose down the road, gorgeous rye, pine, sweet dank hoppiness all balanced by a minimal malt backbone. I cannot say enough about the uniqueness of this work of art, it is simply one of the best IPA's I have ever had, and Alpine may be the little giant that continues to craft ultra uber cult status beers according to their own rules.","OTB","Jan 06, 2012"

I was worried when I saw that the only one left on the shelf was a Rye IPA, but Alpine really balanced the rye flavors well. A bit tangy due to the rye and hop oil, it was surprisingly smooth. I drank the bomber by myself and only noticed the acidity halfway through. It was never a problem though, more of an enduring characteristic. I would love to try this on tap!","Philousa","Jan 03, 2012"

If I had to choose only one beer to drink for the rest of my life, Alpine Nelson would be seriously considered. There is just simply not much negative to say about this beer (except I can't easily get it). I love the delicate, yet complex hop profile, that plays so beautifully with the Rye addition. Recommended to all, every BA should try this beer. Cheers!","Humulus85","Jan 02, 2012"

This one is beyond sensational, the nose is fruity, not quite as sharp as grapefruit, and the taste follows. Fruity, kinds peachy, a little sharp like sucking on the peach pit, is the best I can relate to. You think this would be a typical CA IPA, but it's not... it's so much better. Definitely not sweet, well balanced, but still very bold, a little xtra malt, drinks like a DIPA. . Must be the different hops is all I can add.

As the head pulls back into the beer a thick ring of lace is left all over the sides of the glass. Smell notes of piney hops, tropical fruits, and a slight hint of malt. A mellow bitterness from the hops jumps out with each drink and is well balanced with a crisp malt flavor profile. A great piney linger is left on the pallet with each drink that makes you want to hurry back for more. This beer is an easy drinker with a great finish. Carbonation is spot on. This is a great example of how an IPA should be brewed. Every Alpine offering I have had the pleasure of drinking has left me disappointed because I don't know when I'll be able to drink my next. Great brew Alpine!","brian44556","Oct 24, 2011"

It's really nice. The flavors are a combination of clean piny hops, soap, light citrus, and it has a light yet bitter finish. Still very solid. It drinks very light and smooth and has nice flavors that're both appealing and easy to come back to. This is a very approachable IPA. I'd put this in the Blind Pig ballpark.

I'm missing a little complexity from multiple strains of hops, I think? The rye is a nice touch, faintly spicy. But where the rye shines is helping create a dry clean finish.

4.28,-4.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"D/O: At the first glance, Alpine's beer line-up may seem needlessly crowded with IPAs. A careful exploration of each will allow the taster to appreciate just how much variability is possible within the style: O'Brien's delivers the greatest balance, fulfilling the role of general-purpose IPA that does not disappoint; Duet is a showcase of Simcoe qualities (and a great substitute for Sculpin); and Nelson is the grapefruit bomb of the three. As advertised, it delivers grapefruit that is laser-focused and juicy, with an intensity that even challenges grapefruit-focused DIPAs such as Russian River's Pliny the Elder. If any criticism is required, its qualities have an obsessive simplicity about them--but after all, Nelson is a specialist whose companion brews pick up the slack nicely.","beagle75","May 15, 2011"

Thin rings of lace around the glass on the drink down. Smells of citrus zest hops, pine tree, and some spiciness from the rye. Tastes of spicy rye, malt, and citrus zest/pine hops, but overall the beer has a muted taste in my opinion. Beer is slightly carbonated and seems a bit flat. Smooth but creamy in the mouth.

Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured a hazy golden yellow-orange with a massively fluffy four finger off-white head that subside to one finger stupidly slow. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, citrus, orange, citrus hop, and pot. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine resin, citrus, orange zest, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew completely wowed me. There is really a lot going right for this one overall. One thing to note is the head on this one. HOLY CRAP! It basically formed a pillow over the beer and was borderline solid. You could actually take a bite of it and chew it. It remained this way throughout the entire glass which was awesome. If you noticed that I mentioned getting pot in the aroma, well usually this is out of place, but it seemed to work great with the other aromas going on in this one. The flavor itself was very complex and extremely well balanced. Very nice feel on the palate as well. I would honestly have to say that this might be the best American IPA I have yet to have. Really nice job on this one Alpine!","thagr81us","Apr 01, 2011"

Without the interesting hops I think this a pretty typical IPA, in fact it reminds a lot of hill farmstead citra which I thought was pretty good but Nelson really has it going on. The bitterness in this beer is slightly subdued but i like that because it helps you really taste and smell the Nelson Sauvin.

4.41,-1.6,3,4.5,5,3.5,4,"Nelson pours a murky tangerine. it's completely opaque, and not a particularly pleasant hue. The vigorous initial pour yields a creamy bone colored cap of about two fingers in height. Head retention is decent, but lacing is a little underwhelming. The nose is delicious, and pungent as all hell. It's a massive grapefruit bomb, with a subtle white wine presence in the background. One of the best smelling beers I've had in a while. The flavor manages to improve the beer still. A faint suggestion of bready malts kicks things off, before an exceptionally smooth wave of bitterness rolls into town. The end is a perfect blend of grapefruit rind, white wine (maybe chardonnay), and some spice from the rye. The combination of the unusual Nelson Sauvin hops and some rye in the grain bill has resulted in one of the most unique, and flavorful IPAs I've ever had. The body is surprisingly full for a beer that's as restrained on malty flavors as Nelson is. There's also a certain smoothness that I don't always find in the style. Unfortunately, the carbonation is a little bit lacking/dull, and this leads to the beer starting to hint at a syrupy mouthfeel. As much as I love the flavor of this beer, the lack of carbonation keeps jumping out at me and keeps Nelson from being as quaffable as it could be. All in all though, an excellent brew from Alpine.","axeman9182","Nov 09, 2010"

Looks a pretty dark orange. smell is awesome, with a huge presence of typical fresh hops, citrus smell of orange and grapefruit, and as i smell it, a building presence of mango (hayes says rubber...weird!). This is great! there is also some spiciness that i can't place (not our first beer haha), but adds a nice complexity. Taste follows the smell, but just a hint disappointing. it's decently bitter, and fresh grapefruit is there for sure (comes out a lot more as it warms). the mango and spiciness in the smell, however, didn't come out in the taste. it ended up being just a little odd, but not a terrible one. This one feels pretty good in the mouth, again not incredible. The taste is odd/different enough (to me) that i probably wouldn't want a ton of this one, but definitely worth a try!","ridglens","Jul 30, 2010"

Bright, vibrant orange citrus fruits with a bitter backing in the nose and more in the taste blended with rye. I like this nelson hop variety.

The smell just reeks of pungent, floral, resinous hops. Almost skunky, but redeemed by a sweet fragrant, almost fruity, citrus peel smell. Really a lovely and complex hop these Nelsons are. I can get grapefruit and fresh grass clippings as well. It's like Centennial, but more pungent, I like this. The flavor continues with the smell, with grassy, piney, resinous hoppiness. The fruitiness is more apparent in the taste, with a kind of grassy mango taste, a tiny bit of sweet cantaloupe, and some bitter grapefruit as well. The malt is nice (as I've noticed with most of these Alpine beers), just to the right level to complement the hops, and very sticky, with nice yeast charcter. The beer finishes pretty dry with a slight leafy fruit taste. And the rye, well, you don't exactly taste it, as much as experience it. It add a huge, nice feeling to the body. The carbonation is lively, and makes the flavors burst very nicely as it sort of stings your mouth. And the alcohol lends a slight burn. This IPA strikes that perfect West Coast IPA balance (and I don't mean a 50-50 kind of balance, but a sort of established - in my mind - ratio of what to expect from a very hoppy IPA). My only complaint is that you can't drink as much of it as you would like, as the 7.1% starts to push it towards DIPA territory.","taylorhamrick","Apr 04, 2010"

Grapefruit, mango and mild pine hops dominate the aroma with some light caramel malt and rye balance, nicely balanced but not overly impressive. I really enjoy the flavor and balance of this beer. The front of the palate picks up grapefruit, citrus resin, pine, and mango. Moving back the palate the mild malt body is present with some slightly spicy rye. Mouthfeel is medium thick and smooth with fine, sharp carbonation that slowly asserts itself.

Whereas Duet was a nearly perfect version of what I look for in an IPA, Nelson is unexpected but also world class. This isn't my first encounter with Nelson Sauvin hops, but it's definitely the best use of them that I've tried. The beer smells of orange rinds, wild lilacs, honeysuckle and sweet white grape juice. The flavor is dry, bitter and spicy with rye. The whole package works extremely well. I have no real qualms with this beer, but I wouldn't mind if the rye was a bit stronger. I'd love to try an imperial version of this beer, so get on that Alpine. The mouthfeel has a nice hop oiliness surrounding the duel between hop bite and rye spice. It's an incredibly drinkable beer despite its unusual flavor profile.

Plenty of hops make up the taste but there is also some piny notes. Not much citrus in the mouth. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and medium bodied. Plenty of hops bounce around on the tongue.

Once again, the nelson hops have a certain uniqueness to them, I've only had them in one other beer (Karl Strauss Big Barrel but the hop makes its presence felt.)The beer is very smooth, clean and crisp.

The rye pairs masterfully with the unique elements of the Nelson Sauvin hop, making for a full-bodied, flavorful and aromatic brew that's drinkable not only by virtue of its reasonable abv% but also because of the aforementioned ""what am I tasting?"" effect. I keep getting new things out of this one, and that's really one of my favorite aspects of drinking and reviewing beer - that with four simple ingredients, a masterful brewer can evoke ten, fifteen, twenty, sometimes more identifiable flavors. Nelson - despite not being a perfect brew - is a perfect example of why I love reviewing beer, and in my mind, that makes it as drinkable as any beer I've ever had.","CrellMoset","Feb 13, 2010"

There was some malt backbone that showed through towards the finish and a bit of rye spiciness as well. Quite refreshing. Just under medium bodied with smooth, fine carbonation.

Crisp rye flavor comes out up front, followed by grapefruit sweetness in the middle and finishing with a light, cleansing residual bitterness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation that drops off towards the end of the quaff. This is really delicious. The rye really give it an extra dimension.

Peach syrup, tangerines, passionfruit, grapefruit, pineapple; I really can't stop smelling this. The taste is, thankfully, pretty much identical to the aroma, so much so that it was hard to tell when I had stopped inhaling and started imbibing. Fruit salad with a great resinous medium bitterness. Oh and I was so fixated on the fruitiness that I almost didn't notice the rye, which works to spice up (pun intended) the malt base, which would otherwise be imperceivable.

Neither overpowers the other. Bitterness is fairly clean and refreshing. Flavor brings a lot of citrus and a little pine too. Not quite as bright and juicy as the aroma led me to believe, but rather, a little rough around the edges, which isn't all bad in an IPA.

4.54,1.3,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a cloudy light golden color with a nice loose foamy white head that fades slowly leaving a good amount of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is off the charts!!! Really enjoyable aggressive fruity grapefruit orange resin character. Full flavored, the grapefruit taste bursts out and pretty much hides the rye-factor. However, I do sense that the rye is adding to the mouth feel and seems to extend the impact of the resin aftertaste. This is one heck of a nice drinker. Very enjoyable; reminds me some of Pliny. Huge thanks to radshoesbro for the opportunity.","jjayjaye","Oct 18, 2009"

4.22,-5.8,4.5,5,4,3.5,4,"Notes: I have a feeling that this bottle isn't doing the beer justice when compared to the draught version. It seems like the flavor might be able to match the nose, and the amount of carbonation would be improved to give it that slightly creamy feel that I love in my IPA's. Seeing as how Alpine just starting bottling these beers, I wonder if they are still fine-tuning the bottling line because the carbonation seemed a bit off. This doesn't replace Hop Rod Rye as my favorite rye beer, but it will become a staple in my beer diet, for sure. Quite nice!","sweetbrew82","Sep 24, 2009"
4.54,1.3,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer is upper light bodied with a sticky mouthfeel. To be honest the bottle could have used a bit more carbonation, but maybe it's just me as I typically prefer higher carbonation on IPAs. This is a fantastic beer. As of now I prefer this beer on tap.","HopHead84","Sep 21, 2009"

4.6,2.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Had this on-tap at the Toronado San Francisco anniversary fest. I really, really liked this beer. I've been an Alpine fan for a while, and I think they do a great job with their hoppy beers. I love the zingy, bitter hop onslaught on this one coupled with the spicy rye, it just really works for me. Poured golden with a wispy head, but very nice continuous lacing. Very fresh tasting herbal hops in the nose, quite a bit of dill aroma that I get from the Nelson Sauvin hops sometime, and a bit spicy in the finish as well. I just love the taste of this beer. Lots of herbal hops followed by lots of pine, pretty much my favorite hop situation. Long, tangy, spicy, piney, and herbal. Beautiful interplay between the spicy, slightly sour rye and the hops. Very bitter and long in the mouth with quite an austere malt profile. This is a delicious beer, but its a mouthful.","Georgiabeer","Sep 19, 2009"

4.42,-1.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I finally got to try an Alpine IPA that is not Pure Hoppiness and I was left impressed. The combination of the Nelson hops and the rye gives this a unqiue flavor that still fits in perfectly in the IPA family.","mjl21","Aug 10, 2009"
4.59,2.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"UPDATE: I had a bottle of the a recent batch of Nelson. The bottled version is vastly inferior to the tap version, IMO. Overwhelming rye and none of the tropical flavor. If you've had it in the bottle and were not impressed, try the tap. Not changing the review because I believe the tap version is a great beer and a number of reviewers are picking up those tropical flavors in the bottle - maybe I just had a bad bottle.","kbm","Aug 10, 2009"
4.57,2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Growler from the brewery on release day. Gold with a lasting white head. Super green, dank, spicy, grape, and mango hop aroma. Awesome. Smells like no other IPA that I've had, yet is unquestionably one of the best hop aromas that I've ever come across. The flavor has a similar light toasty malt to their other IPAs, but with just a touch of rye spice. The hop flavor is all there, but is not too bitter at all, just very dank, fruity, and juicy. The body is on the light some with smooth carbonation. I know that this is at the peak of freshness, but damn this is amazing. Unique and just awesome all around.","bulletrain76","Aug 01, 2009"

4.32,-3.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Perhaps the ultimate Southern California IPA. Had on tap at Downtown Johnny Brown's in San Diego. Poured a light yellow color, almost the color of a lager, but plenty of lacing and sheeting action on the glass. Strong piney and floral aroma. A decent amount of malt, with a little detectable sweetness, but all the piney and slightly floral hop goodness was definately center stage. Excellent crispness to the hop bitterness. Just a joy to drink and right level of carbonation.","RunDWP","Mar 15, 2009"

Mouthfeel is light with smooth carbonation level. Drinkability is high with my first pint gone in 60 seconds, dont taste the alcohol and I could drink this beer everyday for years. The best APA I have tried but I really think it is almost more of an IPA mixed with APA mixed with the color and body of a hefe.

Very interesting, and very tasty, I definitely could do with more of this beer. I have a feeling though that these flavors would get old if I encountered them at such levels on a more regular basis. The hop character (both the aroma & flavor) is so musky; it is makes me think of the essential oils of a mix of herbs. I am not sure if it quite works in the IPA format, but could definitely see using it in some of the lighter colored Belgian-styled beers. Definitely well worth it though, and I am still quite exited to use this hop in my own brewing.","Gueuzedude","Sep 02, 2006"
