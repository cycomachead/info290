"(Draft; revisited) at Main St. Brewery in Pleasanton. Not as good as back in December (4ish). Getting a tad stale but not bad overall."
"Had it on tap a couple times. Maybe I just don't get it? Didn't love it."
""
""
""
""
"Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2014 bottle. Wow. By far the best winter seasonal I tried. Love the head and mouth feel. Found the last sixer at local beer store . Do not want to miss this one"
""
"I am not going to do the traditional review on this ale as it happens to be the best seasonal beer that I've ever had...if you enjoy fresh hops, this is the beer for you! It is crisp like a cold and snowy winter night and yet the hops will warm your senses like the wood that's burning in the fire place...there is nothing that is so close to a perfect seasonal as this one! Sierra found a way to put the joy of winter in a bottle!"
"Bravo !"
""
"Decently balanced. Hops are fairly strong but no stand-out flavors here. Quite drinkable though. The bottle talks about ""pine and citrus hop aromas"" and I get some of the pine but not so much the citrus."
"nice, but too bitter for my tastes"
""
""
""
"O - An interesting but fairly good IPA , slightly too tangy and bitter for my liking but offset slightly by the sweet malt. Overall pretty good and worth a try but not as good as the Torpedo."
""
"The Best Christmas Beer period!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic Rich deep copper IPA. I look forward to this every year. Classic!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I prefer this over Torpedo"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As a staunch SN supporter, I am glad they are putting out quality like this..."
"Dark amber color, very aromatic, roses, yellow grapefruit, nutmeg, bitterness is on the point, smooth on the palate, this is very charming one, very fresh and dry style, medium bodied, well-balanced, delicious."
""
""
"decent winter brew, not my favorite, but drinkable..."
""
""
"Very lingering hop presence. Overall about a 4/5"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a great IPA, I was very surprised as I don't like most IPAs, and like fresh hop IPAs even less. But this was good."
""
""
""
"Great look, smell and taste. Outstanding !"
"Normally would make a list, but I just wasn't a huge fan of this beer."
""
""
""
"Mainstream taste and overall just an average beer in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""

"overall: delicou s ipa"
"I believe it's the best winter seasonal I've had."

"2014 Celebration. Beautiful dark gold color with a with a decent head. Dominating hoppy smell.  Good hop and light citrus taste on the front end. Hops take over at the back of the tongue.  The taste was slightly hop dominant for me and I would've liked a little bit more citrus. Very drinkable and not too heavy.  One of the better IPA's I've had, just not one of my go to holiday beers."

"A greeat beer year after year. 2014 is no different. A lot of hops and flavor, citrus but not sweet, spice but not peppery, bitter but not dry. A great combination worth coming back to year after year."
""
"Fresh hops, but not too bitter"
""
"I'm generally a big fan of Sierra Nevada, too.   So I'm a little perplexed by how much I differ from the crowd on this beer."
""
"Once again a world class ale from Sierra Nevada.  The best beer that I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome beer, one of my favorites"
""
""
""
""
"This was the beer that hooked me on IPAs. There may be some emotional bias, but I still think it may be my favorite IPA. I can't wait to pick up a six pack of these every winter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mostly citrus hops, but not stinging in its bitterness or hop profile...not particularly interesting or unique but fairly well balanced and medium bodied enough to be a good ipa option in the winter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Didn't care for this one."
"Didn't really care for this one"
""
""
""
"A lovely, deep amber. Aroma is mild, of hops: citrus and pine. Tastes and feels great, with upfront hops ending on a real piquant note. A little maltiness backing it all up. Quickly warming with high alcohol. Would make a great beer to have around for day-to-day consumption during these winter months."
"Gave it a 4, maybe I'll change my mind next season."
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer for a Christmas Eve night by the fire."
"I'm not a big IPA fan but I found a lot to like about this.  There was a ton of aroma and flavor from the hops, not just bitter.  Some christmas tree-like pine notes made this a great holiday selection."
""
"Great balanced beer. Very drinkable and smooth. Makes me miss the holidays already."
""
""
"Inviting clear amber color; healthy head (a bit more than I would have expected); lacing present; I smelled more toasted grain than hops but overall lacked any prominent aromatics; balanced, but I found the hops to yield too much to an earthy maltiness. Overall: good but not great and nothing that made the flavor stand out to me. I recalled enjoying it more in years past. I will revisit next season. (8.5)"
""
""
""
"Was a bit underwhelmed by this beer - I remember liking the 2013 and 2012 versions more, which is strange as I've seen the opposite from many reviewers of the 2014 version (which I what convinced me to buy it again). Balanced, but I was hoping for slightly more hop."
"Very nice IPA but don't get the fuss."
""
""
""
"I think 2012 and 2013 were better than 2014, just based on how much I bought.  That's not saying it isn't quite good, just that opinions vary."
""
""
"My first winter trying Celebration, I now have something to look forward to after the fall season."
""
"I look forward to Winter every year so i can stock up on some Celebration!"
"Nearly perfect beer.  Only drawback is that it is a seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great IPA this year, Celebration 2014."
""
"I have it on draft right now. it is so good this year."
""
"O: A very enjoyable brew, another great IPA from Sierra Nevada and well worth a try."
""
""
"Picked up a sixer as I felt this was a popular seasonal that I had yet to enjoy. Bottle pours a deep copper with good carbonation and a deep white head. The lacing here is fantastic. Clings satisfyingly to the glass. A really well balanced fresh hop IPA. The amount of balance between the hops and caramel malts along with a bitter back end is remarkable. Lots to celebrate here."
"Solid offering from a great brewery, but I don't get the hype. would much rather have a Torpedo or Pale Ale."
""
"Sorry I only found it one time.  Loved it out of the bottle but had one disappointment on tap.  Nice IPA for the holidays.  Sierra is a beer snob bargain at Costco in Northern CA.  My brother in law labeled me a beer snob."
"O- More bitter than I like, and I think I'd still like to drink this one in warmer weather, but nevertheless, a really great beer. Looks great and the hop aroma is fantastic."

"What better way to ring in the New Year than with a 2014 Celebration Ale? Cheers! Oops... In my zeal to enjoy this one, perhaps I got a little carried away. My aggressive pour created a towering 4-finger head that overwhelmed my IPA glass and cascaded down to the countertop. Sweet precious ale, what have I done?! After squeezing the last ounce in the glass, I was left with an ice cream float-like head. Ample lacing crowned the deep, hazy, nectar colored liquid. I took a few moments to admire the robust and beautiful garnet-amber hue before diving in to the nose. It didn't take long for the potent scents to waft upward. Spruce pine and juniper mingled with a sweet grapefruit citrus and hints of pineapple. Reminiscent of the fresh bed of pine straw that falls in my yard each Autumn, with a zesty citrus flare. There's an underlying bread crust in the nose that struggles to compete with the floral and perfume-like hops.  The flavor was a vibrant hop explosion. Earthy, herbal and fresh. Ruby red grapefruit. The caramel malt backbone also stands tall but struggles to support the alpha acids. To call this balanced would be a lie, but the malts are noteworthy and serve to further illustrate how incredible the star of the show really is. All of this is delivered with a rich, chewy mouthfeel and creamy carbonation. I've run out of adjectives. It's simply delicious and represents the high-water mark for American IPA's. Sierra Nevada continues to impress with their admirable ales and the West Coast sure shows us how it's done. Happy New Year Beer Advocates. Welcome to 2015!!!"
""
""
"Got a growler and have to say this is pretty good stuff.  Very tasty and not overly hoppy.  First time I've tried it and I will certainly be getting some more soon."
""
"Nice pour, color, and head retention...tastes good, hoppy but not overly so. Slight aftertaste, not unpleasant but noticeable. Would like go try it on draught but doubt if it is offered that way since it is a seasonal. Will buy again..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not a big IPA guy, but I still like them. Didn't expect what I got with this one. Very good!"
"12/29/2014 with 2-14 vintage. Getting a little long in the tooth it seems. Dark golden coloe with good off white foam. At fridge temp not a lot of nose. Nice mouth feel, good carbonation. Strong bitterness on finish. Malts come through through and sort of a grapefruit pith taste. It's a'right, wish I'd had it fresher. Unlike some others I'd prefer the Pale ale."
""
"Been drinking this one since mid 1990's.  Tasted quite a bit of change with the scale up and hop crisis/competition. Much grassier these days (""fresh hops"") as are more and more ales these days. 2014 better than 2013 and so on back to 2010, the worst year by far. ""Economies of scale"" evidenced in the brewery that weaned me from Sam Adams when i lived in SoCal.  Still a ""GoTo"" (pun intended) ale this time of year- optimally on tap."
""
""
"Very consistent. Very good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I personally remember this being better last year. It seemed to have more malt balancing out the bitterness. I got an astringent character that i havent noticed in the past. Maybe my tastebuds are off, or perhaps my palate is more mature. Its still a solid winter offering with the pine and alcohol presence. Will revisit next year"
""
"I would probably prefer this to the pale ale. A really delicious ale with nice piney and citrus hop notes, with some solid earthiness and robust caramel malt. Delicious with a subtle sweetness that shows some nice hop flavour development. Lovely beer with a great complexity and also great drinkability."
""
"O - delicious.a must have every year. Cheers!"
"I've enjoyed and always looked forward to the Celebration offering come Winter.  But for some reason, I'm finding the 2014 batch to be less appealing than I remember.  Very hoppy without as much balancing malt as years past.  Is it just me or are others picking up on this?"
""
""
"It was just hoppy. I wanted a little more."
""

"Love this beer each and every year. Perfect balance of hops and malt and should be considered a household favorite of beer drinkers throughout the holiday season."
""
""
"Decent beer. Not quite worthy of the reverence it receives, in my opinion. Nice and hoppy but has a bit of a metallic flavor that I find in most SN beers. It's good, but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful beer. Foamy head, excellent hoppy smell, not too bitter-hoppy, yet smooth taste. My favorite Christmas beer gets a 5 this Christmas Eve."
""
""
""
"a staple for christmas beers and for good reason.  while I am not a HUGE christmas ale person this is up there for the style."
""
""
""
""
"A fizzy Torpedo....not a bad thing.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very hoppy without being overwhelming.   Refreshing to drink.  Good job this year."
"It's a good beer, perhaps a great beer, but it's not what I want in a winter seasonal. It's about what you'd expect from Sierra Nevada in terms of taste and aroma. It shows off the hop harvest well, so I guess it's mission accomplished on that part. If I'm judging it on it just on taste, it's a probably 8/10, but as a seasonal I'm giving it 7/10."
""
"Sampled out of 12 oz. bottle poured into a glass. Very good pour with tall, lasting, light golden colored head. Deep copper color with good range of color depth depending upon light angle. Nose is pinier and/or more citrusy than some lighter or more flowery hopped IPA's. Broad range of malt sweetness on the front end and finishes with a sweet yet hoppy, lingering finish. Very balanced. Mouth feel is somewhat effervescent. Not something to be expected from a festive seasonal ale but a nice twist on the typical IPA that really brings the holidays home."
""
""
"Sampled on tap.  Mahogany brown with slight head that diminished quickly into a Lacey ring.  Nose was nutty and piney with a bit of nutmeg.  Flavor was hoppier than the subtle nose but well balanced by a brown sugar sweetness."
""
""
"Wanted to like this more but it did not push over the top. I'll try a bottle next time."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really a great holiday beer especially a twist that it is brewed as a holiday offering IPA"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- An impressive IPA bursting with flavor. The use of fresh hops as advertised is apparent in the taste. If you're a hop fan, you need to try this Winter offering."
""
""
""
"An intense Hop BOMB. Very bitter and resinous, a hop-heads delight...but not so much for rest of us! To me it is unnecessarily bitter with a lack of the myriad fruity flavors of the hops from a GOOD IPA/DIPA, not to mention a complete lack of even the faintest hint of balance! Not SN's best effort, I'm rather disappointed..."
"A high quality IPA for the Holidays. A bit high on the IBU scale for my taste but still a great seasonal brew"
"It was a good beer, smooth, good for winter"
"Really hoppy, but very easy to drink."
""
"Looks amazing, but taste like a Belgian."
""
"Very derivative. Hops. High malt."
""
""
""
""
""
"I will look for it again at my local"
""
"O: A solid winter IPA that is reasonably priced and very well balanced. Good piney/citrus hop notes without being too overpowering. I could happily drink this all winter!"
"This is a nice amber colored beer. The first thing I noticed was when I smelled it was the hops, I think I also smelled a slight citrus odor. I usually read the labels on the beer to see if their description lines up with what I notice while tasting. The description on this label was spot on. They describe it is a complex, robust ale layered in pine, citrus and hops."

"Did a little Holiday beer tasting with my wife. This is a great beer. I really enjoy the subtle hoppy smell that goes along with this beer. It has just enough bite to it too without being bitter. A very balanced and enjoyable brew. Another solid one from Sierra Nevada."
"I always look forward to this one when the holidays roll around. A little bit more of everything than Sierra's Pale Ale, and a little bit less than Torpedo. Highly drinkable with a nice hop character,  but not particularly aggressive. (I would have said differently when I first tried this one ages ago, since at the time it was one of the hoppiest beers I had ever tasted.) This is another one that will sneak up on you."
""
"Best seasonal ever.  For real."
""
""
""
""
"Sierra set the bar for me years ago, but this Celebration is heavy and not that hoppy to me now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Boldly hoppy and bitter while still very drinkable. A favorite year after year - definitely a desert island pick."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I don't get what's ""Christmas""-ish about this beer, but it is a fine IPA. Had it with some BBQ tofu, mashed sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. Good ""with dinner"" beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I always keep a case on hand throughout the winter."
"Aroma is of orange peel and pine. Piured from a bottle...nice quarter inch of tan head. Robust grapefruit and resin taste is balanced with medium toast malt (caramel). Fresh lingering aftertaste in the back. mouthfeel is substantial but not thick. This beer is a Christmastime treat! (especially for hop heads)"

"*pairs well with sharp ched"
"terrific ipa  !   lost in all the flavors.  rings the palate like a glockenspiel!  hums the hops . smooth and wet.  drinkability deluxe.   i found another favorite. and i hesitate to say its almost amazing.  almost..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Merry Christmas!"
"This is a pretty crisp, piney IPA.  I like Sierra Nevada and I like this Celebration.  It has lovely color and aroma, and although I would argue with its world-class rating, it is definitely a solid offering from SN.  Would get it again in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
""
""

"A: [3.50] If I was handed this glass and asked to say what was in it I would guess a nice craft lager.  It has all of the qualities of a really nice lager.  I am really enjoying it.  I am guessing there has been hop fade since bottling (around 70 days ago).  Still this is a pleasant beer I would drink again"
"Pours a nice burnt orange and gold color with a little cloudiness and a nice off-white head.  Smell is exactly as noted above. Very intense citrus and pine hops. Tastes  of citrus and fairly hoppy, but not overbearing, perfect for all night drinking. Light mouthfeel that goes down smooth and almost creamy. A very yummy brew!"

"Pours a nice copper color with a white head that trails the glass. The smell is bright with a lot of citrus from the hops. There is also some toasted malt. The taste was very nice with a burst of hops up front and then mellowing to a nice malty finish. Very interesting take on a christmas beer."

"T: nicely balanced;"

"Lovely copper, amber color with an off whit head that persists.  Aroma is citrusy hops, with some caramel notes.  Taste is hop forward with some citrus and malt sweetness just enough to balance but not overtake the hops.  Mouthfeel is medium to light.  I love this beer every year and this is no different.  A unique winter ale that is top class."

"Nice fresh hop bitterness without the aromas unfortunately. Tastes mildly sweet, a nice beer to sip on"
"First of all, I live in that hut on the label and I also love this beer. Being the first of my reviews i say YAY, Not nay, for there is a difference in this beer compared to the rest.. Freshness, its unbelievable, the hops literally jump on my tongue like last year's Christmas poon tang. In order to contain them I make sure to drink the entire bottle. With a 6.8 % abl. its priceless. Believe in yourself, believe that you will, pick this beer up for the Christmas time, you will my friends, enjoy!"

"So I go to Costco to get stuff, and would like to find a case of Torpedo but no they don't carry that. I see Celebration IPA in a case. Its an IPA and i love most other Sierra Nevada beers so I think, it should be something special. After all it is a ""Celebration"" seasonal been and should be something special. I get it home, eager to try, pop one in the freezer hoping I haven't just bought a case of duds. Well, on my first try I am underwhelmed, in fact disappointed. The copy on the side of the case says ""fresh hopped"". I think that means at the very least a Hoppy experience like Torpedo (which I love and maybe that's the problem). It also says hints of citrus and PINE?!, Well if it were me I wouldn't use the word pine in copy about beer. Save it for the Potpourri at thanksgiving and Christmas.. and sure as hell leave it out of beer. The first taste in your mouth isn't bad.... then you get the after taste. If you want to say pine.. id say more like turpentine. Its not heavy its sort of a thin processed alcohol taste that's bitter, but not the good bitter an IPA should have but worse. If you are going to say Fresh hopped make it taste hoppy.. I'm so sad I bought a case of it. Xmas beer anyone?"

"From a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours a slightly hazy copper with a rocky tan one-finger head. This ale has nice carbonation and is bottle conditioned with bubbles rising and particulates settled at the bottom of the glass. The aroma is light and grassy with fresh pine notes, lemon, and honeysuckle. First drink is fresh and slightly grassy with plenty of pine and grapefruit hops. The hops blend perfectly with an earthy note into toasted caramel malt. The finish retains plenty of piney citrus bitterness and freshness. Definitely not a dry finish. Excellent! Near perfect."

"O: This beer is average it was average last year it was average this year it's just Sierra Nevada has one taste to their hoppy beers you either like it or you don't and I've never liked it.  This beer is no exception."

"Overall: An incredible beer, and one that I intend on drinking much more of before the holiday season is up. World class. Highly recommended."
""

""

"Poured into the Spiegelau... 3 fingers of pure white head (might be the glass), big chunky bubbles, deep amber (almost like a cider). Big and bitter on the nose... bit of pine. So drinkable, nice pine and balanced bitterness. Good malt backbone, too. Clean, medium mouthfeel... not the 'conventional' SN mouthfeel. This is a damn nice treat, and departure from the norm. Looking forward to trying more fresh hop styles."
"overall a great ale as in past years, just surprised it's a bit weak up front."
""
"Beer is okay. Nothing great like it says on here. Mediocre at best"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottled early Oct, drinking mid Nov... Passed on the early Sept bottles.... Yeah, sadly, missing the fresh hop aroma. Very faint nose. Taste is somewhat muddled... No distinct pine; malty; darker than I recall last year's... Ha always been a hallmark of the season... Perhaps my taste buds have been alpha oil assaulted and I just can't go home again?"

"Overall - This is a good beer. Nothing to write home about, it won't blow your hair back, but it is good. Condor recommended and approved, if for no other reason than it is Sierra Nevada and it is an IPA that isn't insanely hopped."
""
"This rating may have been influenced by the fact that when I cracked the beer the bottleneck cracked with it slicing the crap out of my finger"
"Outstanding. Favorite in the Sierra Nevada line up. Winter style but with great hops. It's hard describe but it is really good."

"This beer is epic. For the price you cant beat it. Amber in color. Nice sweet malts up front with a head that hardly fades.  On my third right now and what a blast to drink. Nice stench from the head. Cascade hops are becoming a standard for the nose. Easily evident and fresh which is a nice bonus. Need to find more before winters end. Nose to glass feels like I am in a abundant forest with lots of trees and herbs meandering about. Hats off on this one. Love the sticky  lacing  on the glass which promotes its drinkable assets. Outstanding IPA..."

"Overall: 4.25 - This is a treat for hopheads, a delicious offering that's strong but not overpowering. It's not the most complex IPA in the world, but for what it is, it's beautiful."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Solid."
""
""

""
""
"Overall: I'm glad I tried it, it's a stronger beer so maybe only two, but I could see me drinking this regularly... if it wasn't seasonal. (4/5)"
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish amber rust. With a tall foamy opaque cap. Huge sheets of sticky lace. Smells mostly malty with light citrus notes, light on aromas overall. Sweet malts and bread crust flavor underscores a full pallet of hop bitterness mostly pine with subtle citrus notes. Light dryness on the tongue with a strong hoppy aftertaste that is welcomed. Great seasonal that is always enjoyed."

"Poured from my kegerator into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Kicked up a nice thick and fluffy off-white two fingers of foam that receded to a thin film after about five minutes, but left very nice lacing. Color is dark amber to brown and very clear. Aroma is piney, grassy and spicy with a bit of sweet malty notes. The flavor has a lot of pine, some grassy flavors and a very nice roasty malt backbone, very well balanced. The mouthfeel is medium, but silky smooth with a nice bitter aftertaste and a bit of carbonation bite that makes you want to have another taste. Overall, this is the one holiday seasonal beer I look forward to all year, even though it's really not a traditional ""Christmas"" beer. Simply outstanding- I think I'm becoming a Sierra Nevada ""homer""!"
""
""
"A darker shade of Torpedo with a Christmas mouthfeel and a slightly lower ABV. Lacing all the way down. Head, too, at least in a Spiegelau IPA glass.. This is a classic seasonal IPA, and it's just not the holidays without it."
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep ruddy orange, slightly clouded with a big beige head. The head slowly settles down and leaves small sticky lacing. The aroma isn't bad, but there isn't much to it, with just barely there and nondescript hops. The taste is pretty bland, as well. The most prominent flavor note is bitter hops, but without anything specific. Just...bitter. The body has a nice weight and feel to it. I've had this in the past and this year's edition is just not as good."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 10/2/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/amber color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, pine, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/brady malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wet hop IPA. All around great complexity and balance of juicy citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
"Overall: Celebration is a wonderful seasonal IPA and I don't even care if it isn't balanced."
""
""
"Had on tap. Flat, oily, with a mild hop flavor at best. I look at all these other reviews and wonder if the keg I drank from didn't have an issue."
"Maybe it's because I've had 2 Space Dust IPAs before trying this, but I don't get the hype. A very average IPA, good but not something I would seek out."
""
"If one was looking for an ipa that fits in with the winter/ holiday season, with straight-forward and not overdone hops, and a nicely toasted backbone, this brew will do it. I could see this drinking well from the bottle. Bitter, yet well-rounded overall. Enter winter."

"12 oz. bottle obtained at a blind Better Beer Authority tasting, don't recall exact bottling date but mid-10/14, poured into a BBA large bottom snifter glass, drank over 30 minutes"

"I Almost feel like a spokesman for ""Sierra Nevada Brewery"" man...I can not help it though, IMHO~`it is between them and ""Ballast Point"" for the single best Brewery in America,I live on the East Coast,[about 5 miles from ""Dogfish Head "" Brewery] and while we have some very good to almost gr8 Beers here on the east coast,there is something VERY Amazing and almost supernatural about a lot of these West Coast Breweries~we cant touch em with a ten foot cattle prod man...they just kick our ass every way including sideways,it has to be the soil and local grown Hops,the freshness,the taste,the flavor of their IPA's/APA's are just fucking CRAZY! [ya..they kick our ass in weed too..big fucking time!] and @ about 15 bucks a 12ver for almost all their brews....SHIT! how in the hell can they be that fucking good?....[but I am soooo very glad they are!..hehe] cheers!"

"Overall, I dig this brew. It was well worth the opportunity to buy for the price, one can't beat it."
"This is my first time having this seasonal selection with an enhanced palate. Last year I tried this and thought hmmm... What's all the hype about? But now I get it. This beer is dangerously drinkable for an IPA that clocks in at 6.8%. It's perfectly balanced with malt and hops. I mainly get pine in the taste but it's very pleasant and lingers on the tongue. I think it's the wet hops that keeps your mouth watering and wanting more. This beer is great and I will definitely look forward to it for years to come."

"Just had my first 2014 edition, bottled 10-08. This was my first true craft beer many moons ago. Have to say still it's damn good. I hate to say less hoppy than I recall but it's def not a malt bomb either. Call it more subtle and balanced. Real nice cinnamon piney note at the finish. Time for another."

Its worth seeking out, its cheap for what you get and its seasonal. It would be a great hoppy ale for those gateway drinkers. I am going to test this one on some of my friends who only drink macro lagers."

"I have to say I enjoyed Lagunitas's Fresh Hop Bomb 'Born Yesterday' more than this year's Celebration just from the hop flavor profile alone. However, celebration does feature a more balanced and richer mouthfeel in comparison making it a better overall choice as a go to 'Winter IPA'."

"Just finished my first bottle of SN Celebration.I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm going to make it my go to winter IPA."
""
""
"I am not a professional reviewer, and do not really know how to express how something tastes like so many of the excellent reviewers here.  I will say once you savor the pour, the smell and that first taste you will know you are embarking on something special.  The body is full, but not too full,  the hop characteristics reek of freshness but the beer is also balanced.  It is a big beer...meaning after about 3-4 it is time to move on.  But, man oh man, this is good stuff.   The best beer Sierra makes.  I love it."
""
""
""
"Overall:  This.  This is such a classic and I personally find it to be the prototypical American style IPA that does everything right.  There is plenty of hop flavor and fresh aroma but is well balanced by the malt bill.  It still stands up well to all the new beers since its first release.  Combined with its availability and price point, this is an amazing IPA.  A great alternative to all the spiced beers this time of the year."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very pleasantly surprised, my favorite fresh hop beer I've had  so far this season!"

"o: this beer is a real treat.  its such a well balanced American IPA to me.  its got sweet, bitter, and fruit all harmonizing perfectly in the glass.  its not too bitter, and not too sweet, it just tastes clean crisp and delicious"

"A truly great beer from one of the big guys in the business.  For me, it is the hop/malt balance that makes this beer so special.  Even with all the other excellent IPAs on the market, I look forward to Celebration every year."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent look, taste, and feel, but the smell let me down. Considering the fuss about fresh-hopped, I thought the aroma would be more intense (even if it's not as fresh as wet-hopped)."

"When you have something to celebrate (frequently, if  if you like beer) a Celebration Ale sounds better then say Voices in My Head Insane Hops or suchlike. Good claim stake to a name  - Celebration Ale - and a tough one to live up to.  Been waiting for this favorite IPA  of mine and here it comes on Nov 2 (package date 9/30/14). Amazing consistency and flavor for a mass-produced beer. If a small craft brewery made this it would make its fortune; from Sierra Nevada, it's as if Ford mass-produced the GT40 for the price of a Toyota. Cheers."

"Fantastic beer! It's one of my favorites. Great hoppy bitterness, but not too overwhelming. When I first had this a few years ago I hated it, but only because I didn't have a developed palate for bitterness, and I couldn't handle it. Now IPA's are my favorite type of beer, and this has to be one of my favorites (hopslam probably being my favorite if only I could find it again). This beer is perfect for the holidays, although I wish it was around for longer. this is a must buy for hop heads!"

"Excellent balance of malt and hops.....not too heavy and very drinkable. Perfect for the chill in the fall New England air!"
"bottled 10/9/14 and tasted like it. Celebration is brewed using the first of the hops received and it tastes great. I do think its funny a number of reviewer's have said they have drank the brew made in NC. The only brew you can be sure was brewed here was Raincheck the stout they used to condition the system, otherwise they have purposefully labeled all bottles with both brewery sites."
"I think I'll have another now. Cheers!"

"Overall - A truly hoppy IPA, fairly bitter and strong, yet manages to feel extremely well balanced. The fresh hops (not wet hops...freshly dried hops) really pop in this beer with a lot of complexity, yet the smooth malty backbone provides just enough sweetness to balance while letting the hoppy star of the show shine. An outstanding beer, and a classic."

"The thing I'm curious about, and perhaps someone could help me out here, is that for the past several years they've been referring to the Celebration Ale as an IPA, but I'm all but convinced that ages ago their Celebration did not always fall into the IPA category. I wish I could go back in time and crack a bottle in 1990 to see for sure. There's a lot of other things I'd like to do if I could go back to 1990, but that's a story for a different website. Regardless, This is a delicious holiday beer from one of the best breweries on Planet Earth."
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish brown with a one and a half finger head. The smell is pretty evenly balanced between the citrus hops and the toffee malt. the flavor is milder than I remember. Nice hop presence but still a good amount of malt. It's good. Quite tasty, but slightly timid."

"Deep amber color with one finger of white foam that clings to the glass throughout. Citrusy hop aroma with heavy pine . Less citrus in the taste but the pine remains with a great deal of floral taste as well. The floral quality reminds me of why I fell in love with IPAS. Definitely the perfect winter IPA with a very rich mouthfeel, low to moderate carbonation."

"It pours golden copper, but turns a vibrant golden color, and has average head, with decent carbonation and little lacings. It has a lasting aroma of hops that hangs in the air after the pour, the taste is of hops, citrus, and rye, with notes of caramel. It has nice bitter taste, light body, has a hoppy after taste, and feels good on the tongue. Fantastic beer..."

"Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium goblet. Nice off-white head and lovely lacing. The color is unfiltered medium amber. The aroma is really wonderful--citrusy hops predominate. The flavor is rich, delightful, strong hops balanced with malt. Mouthfeel is medium thick, with fairly strong carbonation. Overall this is an outstanding ale, different than Torpedo in character, but defines truly from the same family. TMZL below does a much better description of this ale. I just love it!"

"O- While the smell is somewhat underwhelming, the taste is much more intense and pleasing in my opinion. For 65 IBUs, very drinkable. If you aren't keen on IPAs, this one probably won't change your mind, but it's a really solid offering and it should be a must try for all those that do go for IPAs. Great beer."

"Poured into pint glass from 6 pack purchased at Distellers Outlet in Poway CA. Every year I look forward to this brew and it never dissapoints. A beefed up Pale Ale from the folks who make quite possibly the best PA around. The smell on this beer is amazing, hops, fruits, pinecone/pine needle(did I mention piney) type smell. The head on this beer is like a fluffy marshmellow cloud, one of the best heads on a IPA I have ever come across, really superb. Lots of hops, this brew has its bitter side but it is matched in equal with malts and whatever else they are using...fruit, spices, crisp on the palate with a warming alcohol lingering towards the end. If this is on the shelfs it means the weather is colder outside, and this is the perfect beer to warm you up on a chilly night."

"Overall, this is a solid and fantastic beer. I hope that someday I can brew something that matches the caliber of this masterpiece. If you dig hops like me, and you havent had this beer, then you need to try it. Its only 8 bucks for a 6er where I live and it cannot be beat(unless you grab Torpedo at the same price :)"

"O - A fantastic IPA. Deserves all the hype it gets. A true holiday classic."
"O - So this is what all the noise is about. An exciting seasonal that gets deep into what an IPA should be. Perhaps a bit surprised that the citrus is not more forward, since that would seem a natural given the season, but this brew manages to impress without overwhelming. It is a powerful, drinkable brew that I'll be looking for next season."
"DATE TASTED: December 29, 2013... GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint...OCCASION: last day of 2013 for Browns fans... APPEARANCE: beautiful amber brown body with a creamy white head that sits resiliently; lacing is total and impressively cumulus... AROMA: cinnamon, nutmeg, and cascade hops; hints if honey assuage the pinecone explosion... PALATE: active, medium-to-full bodied presence; at 6.8% ABV, packs a palatable punch...TASTE: nice malty presence; the balance is impeccable-- ""whole cone"" aptly describes this IPA impact... OVERALL: among the many holiday brews I've tasted, this one continues to consistently provide a warm, welcoming friendship at an un-Scroogelike pricetag--sessionable despite its weight and strength..."

"This is a very balanced and hence easy drinking IPA. It makes a nice sipping-session beer, which I am enjoying on the final weekend of the NFL regular season. This beer complimented very well with hot wings and a variety of other foods."

"Overall- Easily one of my favorite Ipas, which is kind of weird because I'm not usually a fan of pine forward ipas.  However, there is just enough citrus/orange fruit flavor and caramel malt to balance the pine, which is really evident as the beer warms up a tad.  Very glad I bought a case of this, but I doubt it will last the winter as planned.  (95/100)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Have this on tap right now, and good enough not to get tired of. Very nice citrus hop, but I don't get as much of the Christmas beer taste as others do. I'd drink this long before I'd drink most other Christmas brews. It's a tastier version (sweeter, heavier, etc.) than the SN pale ale, which is amazing in itself. Try it, you'll like it."
""
""
""
"It has wonderful citrus notes on the nose. A solid malt backbone, with light lacing on the glass. With gingerbread and nostalgia intact, this beer is a Christmas favorite. If only I could find a substitute for my Christmas Ales."

"A very nice sessionable ale from Sierra Nevada."

"Overall: Very good, I feel like this is a classic example of what an American IPA is. I feel like this is as much of a gold standard as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is. I can see why people go nuts over this every year, it is quite the treat."
"I am drinking this beer out of a duvel chalice alongside tostadas. The tostadas are slightly spicy, as I used salsa verde sauce on them. The beer is a deep amber, light head. the white foam looks like it could be formed by soap. perhaps my roommate didn't wash the chalice properly. It's flavor is good. Very smooth. This was recommended to me by a coworker. He knows more about beer than I but I have a girlfriend so maybe it all evens out. It's a good beer, try it if you like good beer."

"This brew pours into a beautiful red amber color with a major white head. Once it settles, there is a lot of lacing and the white top remains. You can smell the hops and grapefruit pretty clearly with a significant pine smell coming through as well. Celebration feels a lot lighter-bodied than I expected with average carbonation. Finally, the taste is overwhelmingly grapefruit with some hops and caramel coming through as well. The bitterness of the hops really comes through at the end (honestly, it was a little more strongly than I would have liked). I can see why hopheads love this one but it's just a tad much for me. All in all, I like it but it's nothing particularly special when it comes to IPAs."

"Mouthfeel is full and soft, yet a little prickly with carbonation. Nearly perfect."
""
""
"Yet another awesome brew from the folks at Sierra Nevada. It pours a beautiful clear orange color with a nice inch or so of head that has nice retention and lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass. The nose is a wonderful bouquet of hops, pine, and some sweet fruitiness. The taste is nice and hoppy the way I like it with plenty of pine and citrus notes and a great maltyness to bring the whole thing together. Mouth feel is medium light with strong carbonation and the taste lingers in your mouth for a while like a good ipa should. Overall this brew was a delight. You can find it at any decent liquor store and its pretty cheap so there's no reason not to try some before.its gone."

"Yep!"
"Overall, another solid beer, and another solid IPA from Sierra Nevada. It's a quality beer that isn't full of itself, unassuming and delicious, as SN always is."
"This is my fourth Sierra Nevada, had it poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Legit winter beer. Usually the winter beers are full of sugar and spice, but this one is just crisp and refreshing. You can smell the forest when you stick your nose in the glass, it's glorious. Lots of head just piles up as the glass fills. Pick up a case of these every Christmas just like decorating the tree or buying presents. Love it."

"O - While I'll agree nothing really screams ""holiday"" from this beer I find it to be a welcomed change of pace from the spiced beers of the season."
""
""
""
""
"Serious carbonation going on here. I've got an inch thick head of off white foam. Good lacing. Copper brown in color and I can see it is unfiltered due to microscopic sediment within the beer. I get a whiff of pine like hops and light grains. I get a prominent pine like hop and citrus hop flavor at the front of the palate followed by a cereal grain backbone. The hops dominate and it is different to have the citrus and pine hops blended. The mouthfeel is a bit chalky and seems to pair well with the long fading bitterness."

""
"Definitely more Cohumulone than many modern AIPAs, with a longer, more bitter aftertaste. Spicy herbal notes being more predominate. Undoubtedly inspired Surly Furious, Town Hall's Masala Mama, and Green Flash's West Coast IPA. I can never have enough 12 packs of this stuff."

"Always in my rotation around the holidays. Just a solid IPA. Nice color in the glass and smells of fresh picked hops. Readily available and super cheap too (paid around $7.99 for a six pack). Would recommend if you are on the fence about it. What to you have to lose?"

"A Classic IPA. This years batch is very good. It can be a little cloudy, but that's fine. The hops have great character, very citrusy flavor. I find this beer is best drank around 45 to 48 degrees. Any colder and the hop flavor seems to get masked a little bit. This is a beer I look forward to every year and it never disappoints"
""

""
""
""
""

"O: Great example of American IPA. Classic American piney hops, good medium roasted malts and nice body. Look forward to it yearly and make sure I get some of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice, seasonal IPA that does its job on a cold day. The highlight for me was the fresh, hoppy nose that evoked images of handfuls of hops. However, I was surprised by some of the heat that came through despite the 6.8% abv. In short a hoppy, slightly boozy and malty IPA that’ll warm you up."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ruby-colored beer, fairly translucent, with a thick head that feels great when it hits your mouth. Aroma is basically all hops, mostly pine/grapefruit with some floral notes. The malts just serve as a sort of chalkboard for the hops--something in the background to hold them up. Intense grapefruit flavor, strong bitterness. Foamy carbonation, thick & sudsy with a bitter finish. A better-than-average IPA for sure."
"O: An excellent and well-priced IPA if you are looking for hops in the cooler months."

"I had heard many rumors of folks holding onto these for years and aging them, so I decided to try it myself. Poured a deep copper color with an offwhite head or a finger. Smells of pine hops and sweet Christmas bread. I was rather surprised at the smell of hops with a brew that was 4 years old. The taste starts with some light hop bitterness, followed by the Christmas bread, honey, and dried fruits. Light hop flavor melds into sweetness on the finish. OK, but I prefer this one fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O-With every element of what makes a great beer great standing out, this is probably the best winter drink easily. Look, smell, taste and feel all embrace one another in harmony. Standout trait is the appearance. Looks better than most dark brown/deep red brews I've seen. The head is the literal ""Crowning Achievement"". At first sits high and mighty atop the maroon brew. With time flattens, but never leaves. An hour later, my finished glass still had a puddle of foam relaxing on the bottom. The lacing didn't stick to said glass, it would cascade down in a smooth waterfall-foaming fashion and collect downwards. If you're like me I drink every drip if I can. That's the sign of a great beer. One should celebrate Celebration."
""
"Overall: It is great that this is a celebration of the 2013 hop harvest and that the freshness of the beer should be enjoyed before and during the holidays. Enjoyed aim years past and many more times in the future. Such a great beer that I enjoy every year and happy to see that they carry it at the Garden when I go to Celtics games."

"Pours a slightly murky, gorgeous amber color with a good sized off white foamy head. Good retention and lacing. Aroma is of super fresh, bursting citrus led by grapefruit, followed by a bit of pineapple and mango. Followed by pine resin and light notes of sweet caramel malt. Taste starts very hop-forward. The citrus is now mostly absent. The pine notes are strong, and the caramel malts are more present than they were in the aroma. As it warms, the citrus does reappear a bit, dominated by grapefruit and not much else. Although the hops dominate this brew, the rest of the flavors are very well balanced. Medium bodied. Good amount of carbonation. Incredibly easy to drink. I could down quite a few of these. Overall, a very solid IPA. Every aspect was solid, but I was hoping for a little bit more of an in your face result from the taste, instead of the balanced taste that it has. Not a fault, however, still a very good beer."
""
""
""
"Beer with a bold flavor, but nothing excessive. A traditional and well balanced American IPA. Not sure if fresher would radically modify this, once it is available during winter (thus last year) and for some freaking reason most US producer hides this info."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I used to not like this in years past, but this year I'm good with it, the aroma is really good, and considering how long this beer has been around, its earned its keep. Though I think it is a tad over-hyped, and the bread malt could use a few notches back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great alternative to the porters that are usually favoured around the holidays, by far my favorite seasonal beer. Sierra Nevada might be a behemoth but you can't fault them for turning out stuff like this"
""
"An outstanding seasonal beer. Pours to two fingers tan head with nice retention and a dark amber hue. Powerful aromas of pine, citrus and malted hops. Creamy in the mouth. Tastes of pine, citrus, even mint maybe and malted hops. Little bitter. Goes down with a little fight. Finishes with pine, citrus and those powerful malted hops with a bitter aftertaste. Great winter beer. Goes well with holiday appetizers. Mix in a water here and there to avoid the hophead hangover."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very balanced/drinkable as IPAs go and an incredible value. Similar to Torpedo in many respects, though I definitely prefer Celebration... perhaps the ""specialness"" of the holiday release tilts my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know if I'm seduced by the best label I've ever seen, but this beer reminds me of winter. Cozy, warm, and exclusive. Fresh hop? I don't know. Reminds me a lot of, well...every other Sierra offering. Malts are (thankfully) present, and well-balanced. You can taste the alcohol, but don't be scared. Strong hop bitterness only warms the mild alcohol presence. In my mind, celebration's achievement is in balance. This isn't a hop bomb. While the hops greet you initially, the malty smoothness leaves a strong residual sweetness. Taste. Warmth. Happiness. Friends and family, that's what the holiday season is -and should be- all about."
"Solid take on the style, enjoyable piney pucker, nothing earth shattering but another quality beer from Sierra Nevada."

"This is a very quaffable beer, one that I look forward to each year from Sierra Nevada, and usually consume several six packs worth. But once it's gone, I don't miss it much, there are too many other good IIPA's out there that are available year around!"
""
"Overall: This is really a simple IPA. Nothing is over the top and the hop profile dominates. This is what makes this beer so great in my opinion. Plus it is dirt cheap for an outstanding beer. Only 7-8 bucks a 6 pack. For someone that likes hops being the highlight, pick this up!"
""
"O: A classic that I look forward to every year. This year's batch does not disappoint!"
""
""
""
""
""
"A fantastic beer that I look forward to every year. Like most beers from Sierra Nevada it's all about balance and craftsmanship which is very evident. A welcome relief from all the over spiced holiday beers. Well done!"
""
""
"lots of hop aroma, but kind of bland in smell from this mason jar. lots of hop taste. easy to drink, very smooth, medium bitterness. clingy suds on the side of the glass. generic, but decent; sessionable (?) if you're a hop drinker. otherwise, another notch on the BA list, but worthy of decent marks regardless of commerciality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I love this beer. This year is the first I have had it and I hear 2012 was one of the best. I plan to stock up on this beer to see how it evolves. If you have not had it, get some, its great for the holidays and colder weather and different than many of the darker stout type beers often presented during this season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Complex; this year I'm getting an abundance of spices, even hot pepper. Last year I more remember a sour grapefruit note dominating. So its an ever changing beer, but the backbone has always been solid, the malt creates even a milky sweetness underneath the complexity of the hops."
""
""
""
"Just a note... I tried the 2013 bottle. I highly recommend this one!"
"Been drinking celebration for years now. Never reviewed than again up didn't start officially reviewing until early this year(2013). While Sierra Nevada claims the recipe is the same year after year it is simply the freshest hops of the season that differentiate it there are subtle differences in the years. In my opinion of the past 8 years give or take, the 2012 edition is by far the best. This is however the 2013 edition and it is a solid brew. Pretty much outstanding across the board. No weaknesses and nothing that stands out. Just a solid example of what a fresh hop IPA is all about. The thing that amazes me and is rarely mentioned is the consistency of this brewery seeing as how celebration( to the best of my knowledge) is in all 50 states(57 if u are an Obama supporter) and for the brewery to maintain that awesome of a consistency with that volume of production speaks wonders. Amazing brew nuff said !"
""
"O- A great IPA and reminded my very much of 3Floyds Broo Doo but I prefer this one. This is also very cost effective for the beer your getting. Getting a sixer for under 10 bucks is a mighty big holiday gift for sure. Definitely my preferred Sierra Nevada IPA so far."
""
""
"O: Solid IPA, I enjoy that this style is a winter special for SN"
""
"O - Only slight flaw is the nose, but that is inherent in fresh hop ales. Taste is spot on with a nice balance between hops and malt. Not a hop forward west coast IPA, but a tasty one."
""
""
"O - Sierra does it again. This is one of THE measuring sticks for American IPA. With all the extreme examples that have followed it's always nice to revisit the original."
""
""
""
"O - I wonder what I would have thought of this beer had I never heard of it? It's not my favorite hop profile, but it is clearly very enjoyable, and I could certainly drink several in a sitting. It separates itself enough from other IPAs that I will clearly be making this a regular winter-time purchase. Cheers!"

"Pours dark amber/red color with a 2 finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are decent.  Has a nice piney aroma. Hints of citrus.   Nice smooth piney hop with good transition from the preceding sweet malty taste.  Very fresh taste.  Bitter, fruity taste at the end with a good bitter, soapy aftertaste.  Seems a little different from last year's version, but I like it even better.  Tastes like it may have just come out of the brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid hop profile with some maltyness to keep it interesting and the signiture grapefruit/pine flavor that SN does like know other."
"This beer provides a very nice head. At times, depending on the glass, the head is a bit too thick. But the smell, the smell is superb. It is by far my favorite. The taste has a fine hop bite without being overpowered with the bitterness or the alcohol - but you know it is there. A favorite seasonal beer of mine."
""
"This is a nice little beer. it's got a fat head that shows excellent retention and sports plenty of lace. Toasty grain and a soft caramel malt lays down sweetly for an earthy but pungent grapefruit with a bit of pine and a sweet herbal. Brassy in color , the hops sparkle a little in this with a hint of candied orange peel and then it becomes husky with a touch of bread and grain and a pleasant bit of lemon rind to finish it off strong and dry. Anytime! This beer would be fine with me year round."

"It poured a deep amber color with a good sized head and loads of floral hop aroma. The taste is big hops with a slight malty backbone, but mainly the big piney hops. While it leaves a lingering bitter pine finish I found the Celebration Ale nicely balanced and very drinkable. Such a great fresh hop IPA and always a welcome return to the season."
"Overall: Less complex than I was hoping for. Still, a very good beer with some engaging qualities, and one that I would recommend. Subjectively speaking, this was a bit too dark and bitter for me--I like my bittering hops to be balanced by brighter hop flavors and some melanoidins. And yet, taking all beers and not just Sierra Nevada into consideration, this is an excellent ""specimen."" Ah, Sierra Nevada. It's too bad you have to compete against yourself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I get a lot of pine on the palate and then a caramel malt sweetness. The flavors move to a lemony citrus but then end abruptly to a metallic tinnieness. I wish the flavors would hold on a little longer before resorting to the piney, tinny, metallic hop flavor that plagues so many IPA's. That flavor lends to feel with a dry astringency that leaves a long after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't quite get the hype. Celebration is certainly an excellent and drinkable IPA. That said, I don't really find it to be any tastier than Hoptimum or even Torpedo - the latter of which is available year-round. If you see it on the shelves, absolutely go buy it and try it, and enjoy drinking it all season long - I just didn't have my mind blown."

"Pleased with this offering from SN. Online there other beers but not my favorites because their caramel maltiness isn't always what I'm looking for in an IPA but this one has the hip profile I'm looking for and is balanced nicely. Looking forward to having a few of these putting toys together this Xmas eve. Hope my sixtel lasts til then. If not, I guess I'll have to pick up another"

"Excellent tasting beer, but not a session unless you are committed. 2013 celebration restored my faith in this beer, which had fallen off over the past two years. (2006 was the best in my mind). Glad they appear to have gotten it right again and I can once again count this as one of my all time favorite beers."

"Got this after reading all the good reviews and discussion on this site. Gonna have to write a contrarian review. This beer is hops, hops, and more hops. It's not wickedly bitter, doesn't finish like dish soap, actually smells pretty good, but there's just nothing else here but hops. If you are a ""hop-head"" who spends the rest of the year drinking bitter IPAs then you may find this a great ""holiday"" version of that. It has a great hop profile, and I think I'd enjoy it more as a summer beer. But for me ""Christmas"" ales bring to mind malts and spices and toasty warming goodness, and I found none of that here."

"Pours a slightly hazy reddish-orange with a thick white head. Head dissipates slowly leaving nice soapy lacing. Aroma is all about hops. Citrus, spice, floral, pine, a lot going in in the nose. Taste is bitter, grapefruit pith, pine resin, with slight sweet malt notes in the background. Finishes dry and bitter. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, a very satisfying fresh hop IPA."

""
""
""
""

""

"Overall: An excellent seasonal! I love IPAs and had never tried this before reading on this site that it was a can't miss every year for so many of you. I then hounded my local beer shops until one got it in and I can honestly say it really is a can't miss seasonal. Sierra Nevada always delivers and this will definitely be on my list every year from now on!"
""
""
""
"updated to 2013 version"
""
"Since there are a million reviews I will not go into details. This is the perfect example of a balanced beer. Both the malts and hops are in perfect harmony, neither one tries to overwhelm you. The carbonation is there but there is no prickly burn, its just right. I understand why this is so highly regarded now. It is the most balanced beer I have ever come across."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 2013 aims to be an underwhelming, balanced IPA, a stark contrast to years previous. This beer lacked hop aroma, hop taste, notable character, and had an overly yeasty smell- It smells faintly like a macro. I had claimed this in years past as an amazing, highly recommended beer, but was disappointed this year. Perhaps SN is spreading their operation too thin? I loved their beer camp series, but it perhaps detracted from overall quality control on their most infamous craft beer. Better luck next year , old friend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"O – 3.75 – It's not the best IPA I've had, nor the best winter ale. But it's good. More on the floral side of IPAs."
""
""
"O-this was a very balanced beer. It gave you strong hops at times and a malt sweetness, and was creamy and smooth. Very interesting"
""
""
"O: I picked this up in a build your own sixpack Im glad I did, I probably wont buy this again just because Im not a huge fan of IPAs to begin with and I like torpedo better. If your an IPA defiantly pick this up."
""
""
"Appearance is amber with lots of lacing. I love you SN!"
""
""
"Very nice fresh hop ale. IMO the hoppiness in this beer is what fresh hop ales should be. I'm looking at you, Founders and Three Floyds. Very balanced despite the massive hop bitterness on the back end; jam-packed full of malt and hop flavours and bitterness. It might be a bit too bitter for its own good, but hey- at the price it sells for, why wouldn't you have some every winter?"
"overall; bought two bottles. will go back for a six pack. very impressed, definitely warming and great for the cold but would love it all year."
"Overall: This is one of the best winter beers I have found, and at $8.99/six pack it's quite reasonably priced. There's a lot of flavor and enough to talk about to please just about any beer drinker."
"To sum it up, this is a very very complex beer with layers of flavor but not much balance...but it works here. Definitely not for the faint of heart but for the true enthusiast, Celebration Ale is a world class brew and a real treat!"
""

""

"Oily sticky hops pound away at the palate... had this beer loads of times, somehow haven't reviewed it... my favorite Christmas release... yes, an IPA but once I see that snowy cabin on front, I know that the holiday season is here... very drinkable despite the relentless hop assault... pine resin in a glass..."
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I can see why this is so highly rated, as I wish I had bought a six-pack rather than just a single. This would work nicely as a replacement for my Nosferatu that I'm running out of - wonderful hops, but with a solid malt backbone to compliment it all and make it pleasurable drinking experience. I could easily have another one in a sitting. I had this with pulled pork BBQ (mustard based sauce) and green beans and it went quite well with food. I wouldn't mind having a snifter of this either though for a cold winters night. The pine and citrus hops remind me of summer on a cold evening. Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is pretty good. The first few times I drank it, I really didn't care for it very much. I guess that's one of the pros of having a six pack instead of a single; you have to give it 6 tries. I'm not saying I'm going to buy it by the case now, but I'll probably buy it every now and then over the holidays."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very well done IPA. Great citrus flavors come out with the hops and the malts really balance this beer with some sweetness. Only thing that wasn't awesome with this beer was the aroma."
""
""
""
""
"UPDATE: I failed to review the 2012 version, but here I am a year later LOVING the 2013 offering as much as I did in 2011 as reviewed above. I have updated the numbers to reflect. OUTSTANDING."
"Overall: I am normally not a big fan of IPAs in the colder months but this beer is definitely worth breaking the parade of stouts and porters. This IPA contains more herbal-pine flavors than fruity citrus flavors, which makes this a great tasting brew in the winter. The malts are also incredibly tasty. This would be the perfect beer to grab after walking five miles in a foot of snow to cut down a Christmas tree, then dragging said tree back to your cabin."

"Overall- Had this last year first time reviewing this years, and its awesome. One of my favorite holiday season beers. Just so fresh with hops, definately worth trying if not more than that."
""
""
""
"O: The balance is incredible and makes for great drinkability. I could throw back a few of these without growing tired of it. A classic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While I don't think this is anything to write home about, it's nevertheless a very nice IPA, and one that has more to it than just hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes very unique, there were some notes I couldn't quite pick out. It is indeed, as the bottle says, pretty hoppy. I have heard people say it isn't drinkable, and they are insane. I could drink this all day. It is very smooth from the first sip to the last. The bitterness is perfect...more bite than a regular IPA but not quite as intense as a DIPA. A very solid beer all around, would highly recommend."
""
""
"O: I definite go to for any hop head who needs a holiday brew. Year after year, SNBC comes through! I wonder what a double, fresh hop celebration ale would taste like> Probably really damn good!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Sierra Nevada knows their hops! This is the first year trying this acclaimed brew and I am glad to had nearly drank a case already. For the price point, this is some of the best bang for your buck besides Little Sumpin Sumpin and Sucks. An incredibly worthy winter seasonal from SN!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent IPA. I would imagine timing is everything with this offering, as I am not sure how this would hold up once the hops mellow, as there is not much malt to back it up. Pine lovers rejoice."
"Pours dark amber with a two finger khaki head. Beautiful looking brew. The aroma is filled with all kinds of notes. Orange citrus, cinnamon, caramel, maple, brown sugar, and lemon just to name a few. The taste is also quite well crafted. It is incredibly balanced from the get go. Nice burst of citrus closely followed by a caramel bready malt. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. ABV is right where it should be and goes unnoticed. This one is a winner from the beginning. It's equally affordable as it is good. It's hard to find a better beer at this price point anywhere in the US."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little bitter and muddled for my palate. A very drinkable beer, though. Nothing outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"UPDATE 11/27/13: Had a second bottle from the same purchase and really enjoying what seems like a perfect balance between plenty of hops and a mild but substantial malt base. Probably the best of its type for the price out there. Still not much aroma, but the hops include a bit of the fresh hops vegetal aftertaste which sets good fresh hops apart. Raised my taste score to 4.25 and overall score as well."
""
""
"Cannot wait to decorate the tree with a Christmas flick on and fire in the background. SN has exceeded expectations with quality and value. Without a doubt, the best Christmas Seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer drinks as easy as any session IPA but packs so much more flavor and body. It's a splendid beer. 4.25"
""
"Pours a dark copper with a medium head that dissipates in a minute or so. Laces well. Nice hop resin nose. Light / medium body with a balance of hop flavor and bitterness tilted to the bitter side. Hop flavor is of pine and grapefruit - quite nice. Less bitter than Torpedo, but more than Flipside. Hop flavor is less than Flipside. Finishes with a slight hop flavor and lingering bitterness. If hop flavor is your preference, go with Flipside. If bitterness is your bag, go with Torpedo. This one falls in between the two. These 3 SN brews can give you a good contrast of IPAs."
"Sierra Nevada has always been a solid brew to me and this one did not disappoint! Very smooth in the middle with notes of barley that give it a great roasted taste, but dose not mask the hops and a great finish. Also pour quite nice into a glass and form a nice head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sierra continues to impress me. They brew gimmick-less beers with solid taste and appreciation for tradition. Additionally, this seasonal is widely available at a reasonable price."
"A seasonal favorite - probably drink about 3 cases of this from Nov-Jan, and my family/guests drink an additional 2-3 as well. Highly recommend. My favorite beer from SN, easily."
""
"Overall - not surprised by this tremendous offering from Sierra Nevada! A great beer at a great price!"

My guess is fantastic. (Note: I am a hophead. If you are not, you won't like it as much.) Getcha some!"
""
"It pours copper always with a massive head. It smells like pine needles with a hint of citrus. It tastes like caramelized malts (on the sweeter side) and a bitter fruit. The mouthfeel lingers as is not as smooth as I would prefer. Overall, one of the best American IPA's for the holidays."

"This is a nice IPA, and deserves its high marks. IPA fans won't be disappointed, yet it still isn't perfect. If you're looking for a very nice IPA, this is it, but if you're looking for something a little special, then maybe this isn't the choice. No complaints, as this is great, but it is not necessarily the end-all for IPA's."

"Never a big SN fan but this beer has a terrific taste and smell. I'm new to reviewing beer but this IPA definitely stands out. Fortunately a local store still carried a few bottles. Can't wait till this comes out over the holidays.In my opinion the smell and state compliment one another well."

"The beer I wait for every winter! I've never meet a Sierra Nevada I didn't like, and the Celebration Ale is no different. Full boastful flavor, with a great moutfeel, and even better after taste. Like with all Sierra Nevada products great whole cone hop taste, definitely a beer that will make you ""merry"" for the holidays!"

"what a great American IPA! I was late to it this year, but I'll be on the lookout for it next time around ... if a fresh Celebration tastes better than *this*, oh baby!"
"2013 Vintage. Classic red amber color, comforting floral aroma with pine forest and vanilla notes. Flavor is sugar coated tangerines in a doughy blanket. As usual, great balance of gritty malt and rough edged hop bite. Finish is all about lingering resinous piney hop and a trickle of alcohol burn. Mouth feel is a bit light and dry - medium body is there, but the hops havent mellowed yet. IPA, Winter warmer, whatever you want to call it, SNCA is to me, one of the best large production beers available. A valid reason to look forward to Winter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In summation, this is a special American. It rivals other IPA styles while staying true to its California roots. Sierra Nevada has impressed me and I'll be ordering the 2013 version come October, hoping it lives up to this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very well crafted, classic brew from Sierra Nevada. Hits the spot during the winter season as a change of pace from the typical winter warmers. Very easy to find and affordable ($8.99 a six pack, in my area). Excellent stuff, definitely would recommend."
"Flavors of rich, roasted malts, minerals, grapefruit rind, pine sap. This is a big and bold beer with a hop wallop through and through. I like to keep this as a house staple...after a warm up beer or two this one maintains a large level of flavor. Great with spicy food, ideally fresh or less than 4 months."

"This is a great IPA. Plenty of hop aroma, flavor and bitterness. Very satisfying."
""
""
""
""
"O - A solid IPA, the hopping is perhaps a bit too focused on the bittering aspect and less on the flavor/aroma, however this bottle is over a month old so it may be a bad representation of the wet-hopping. Overall pretty average, nothing strikingly awesome about it."
""
""
""

"This one is a very nice IPA and definitely American in style, the strong pine hops and grapefruit are balanced well and the tropical fruits are apparent in the taste although nothing too strong. This one goes down well without coming across as too bitter and is a beer I will seek out again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 355ml bottle. Pours a rich, dark orange colour that's almost brownish. Not what you might expect from a Sierra Nevada ale on first whiff. There are some nice hop notes there, but the typical lemon/grapefruit aromas are a bit muted and the rich malt notes tend to be more up front. Similar situation taste-wise. It's much more malt-forward, with a hearty backbone of earthy hops. Nicely balanced. Great winter beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, IPA's are not my cup of tea but this was pretty good, a testament to Sierra Nevada's dedication to quality and satisfaction. I enjoyed everything about the taste except the hop after kick at the end, but everyone should have a go at it. I also found it to be much less expensive than I imagined, but it's probably just the place I bought it from."

"Love it. Always have. Always will. There is a reason this was one of my first clone home brews. i enjoy thick, chewy, winter warmers this time of yr, but this ipa is my fav xmas beer.4"
"Like I said, this should NOT be a seasonal release. Sierra Nevada is better than that. But for a guy that likes hops, it is a good beer. By the way, the label calls this a fresh hop IPA… and I generally don't like fresh hopped beers. I would like to see them do another version of this and either double the ABV (consider it an imperial IPA) or barrel age it. They just released the barrel aged Bigfoot, so they have some barrels sitting around!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this wasn't that great. Probably one of Sierra Nevada's lesser beers. Don't get me wrong, It would be wonderful as a session IPA or an IPA to introduce somebody to craft beers, but to a veteran reviewer it doesn't offer a whole lot since the flavor profile never fully comes through or develops."

"Brown to amber tones, mostly amber, head it medium bodied with big bubbles, and gone fairly fast. Lacing is good, and the nose reminds me of the pale, yet more hop, and fruit. No spice here, hops, medium bitterness, and some malty complex , with some carmel, and grain undertones. Pair with salmon, lamb, or bbq/smoked meat."

"2012 bottle. Pours deep red-orange with a nice head. Aroma is new to me. Flowery potpourri, roses, extremely floral. Flavor follows that floral aroma, but not as much bite as I was hoping for. The malts are sparing, while the flowery flavor takes over the palate. Smooth mouthfeel with low-ish carbonation, and relatively light and easy to drink. Not bad, but not what I was expecting."
""

"This beer is engrained in my brain that Christmas celebrating starts now. This is so crushable. Bonus is that distribution here is silly and SN made this so freakin affordable-what's there not to love. Well balanced craft, affordability, no nonsense, sessionable, Christmas and something everyone could embrace. This is a staple for any festive event. Kudos to you folks at SN for keeping this real!"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy amber with a larger head that leaves nice lacing. Smells of piney hops and a little malt. Tastes of wonderfully balanced earthy and citrus hops and a little malt. Beer is carbonated right and for its light/medium body it goes down very well. Overall, a superb beer."

""
""
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: Truly outstanding, and that's all that can really be said about it ... one of the best beers that I have ever had, no doubt. It just has that nice bitterness you'd expect from an IPA, but it has some malty character as well. Not many IPAs are quite like this one, and I can completely understand all of the acclaim. One of my favorite pine-centric IPAs."

"Fantastic, one of the beat beers I've had... amber color nd off white lacing that mark the glass perfectly. Aromas are spit on not over whelming and in a winter season filled with dark Porters this is a excellent alternative the fact that this is only seasonal is the only problem with this beer truly A+"

"M - Thin-to-medium body. Good carbonation. Finish is fairly clean and semi-dry with some noticeable residual sugars--in my mind, this is perfectly acceptable for a winter AIPA."
"O: This is what I would call a barely balanced IPA. There is enough malt to keep it from being undrinkable but it's not as balanced as other IPA's out there. Then again, the other IPA's I'm thinking of are DIPA's so maybe I'm being overly critical in that regard. I supposed I'm still trying to decide how I feel about this beer."

"12oz bottle, a rocky, ivory head tops a bronze colored ale; excellent head retention & lacing is left all over the glass. The pleasant aromas of fresh, dank, piny hops coupled with caramely, bready malt fill the nose. Huge, fresh, piny hops (some pungent grapefruit in there as well) prevail through the healthy dose of malt. Notes of rye bread crust and caramel (a little burnt) try to balance out the pine, but can't stand up to it. Pine lingers & lingers on the palate while finishing dry and bitter. Medium body, smooth but resiny reminiscent of pine tar. Overall, although it's fairly one-note with not a whole lot of complexity, I love this seasonal IPA. I'm not sure why some complain about it being too piny...that's exactly the point they're trying to make."

"This American IPA pours a clear amber color, and it is capped by a thin head of off-white foam that dissipates quickly and provides decent lace. Big citrus and pine aromas and a decent caramel malt nose. Caramel and bready malt sweetness give way to citrusy hop flavors and bitterness. Amazingly smooth and incredibly well-balanced, Celebration ale is medium in both body and carbonation."

"Overall: For what this beer advertises, it certainly delivers. While I prefer a more spiced type of wintertime ale, this one delivers for its genre. Very drinkable, good level of alcohol ... beautiful color and head. I could definitely drink more than one of these to counteract the sweets at the Christmas family meal!"
""
""
""
""
"O- I can't speak highly enough of this beer. Its not the best beer I've ever had but its definitely one of the most enjoyable to drink. Every Christmas I grow to love this beer more and more. It is Sierra Nevada's best beer IMO. It is perfectly balanced in a West Coast IPA kinda way. It is super drinkable and unique. I hear people say this is overrated but I personally think its underrated. What a treat. Worth the wait.."

"Sierra Nevada Celebration pours a dark amber, with a good bit of clarity to it. Just over two fingers of dirty white foam finish off the look, hanging around for a few minutes before leaving chunks of lacing stuck to the glass. The aroma is predominantly grapefruit in character, but a bit of more piney hops manages to sneak into the nose as well. There's a healthy dollop of caramel and candied sugar right up front, before a bitterness intercedes. My first impression is that it's relatively mild, but it does increase in intensity as it moves towards the back of my palate. The hoppy finish is closer to straight floral grapefruit, but there's still a little bit of pine appreciable. The body definitely isn't on the dry end of the spectrum for an IPA. For a beer that's (hopefully) only going to be consumed in the winter months, I don't mind that as much. The carbonation could stand to ""pop"" just a little bit more though. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Sierra Nevada Celebration, but I don't quite see what makes some of my beer geek brethren go crazy about it either."

"O - A well-crafted hoppy pale ale. One of the finest examples of the style that I've tasted."
"Delicious. One that's worth waiting for year after year. 2012 though is very good. Pours ok. Even on a careful pour there's quite a bit of head, which I don't favor but overlook for this one. Smells dam good toffee, caramel, oak amongst others. Taste, Dam good. That's why I drink it. Does have a grapefruit ending, slightly bitter. Overall I look forward to this one. Slightly heavy a sixer tops."
" poured into a pint glass"
"Overall, I recommend this brew to those that love IPA's with a spicy holiday twist. Sierra Nevada never disappoints. Try this with spicy Thai food. You'll be highly satisfied. This may sound strange, but try it while eating a grapefruit or an orange. You'll be surprised. Cheers!"

"O: This beer is great. Drinkable and full of flavor at a good price. I'm a hophead but I lean towards the more balanced IPAs and DIPAs and this is one of those. Think I'll get a six pack."
""
"O - Overall, I would say this one of my least favorite IPA’s. A little to much bitterness for the amount of hop flavor and aroma. It also has a lingering piney bitterness that I feel could be better supported by more flavor and aroma hops or more of a malt backbone."

"O: Glad to keep buying 6 of these each year! I'll have another! Not the best AIPA, but a great beer."
"The label implies something like a winter warmer, but it's really a nice, acerbic hop bomb. I'm buying a case!"
""
"O - Not sure if I'd pick this as my first choice for a Chirstmas beer. However this is a well made beer that I'd like to get more often."
"Waited a year to try this one as I saw it last season but didn't get a chance to try it. Poured a finger head with an amber color. Good lacing on the glass. Smelled mostly malty with slight hops. The tongue begins with a hint of malts then moves into centennial hops which is fine with me. A nice bitter/grapefruit finish. Has an average mouthfeel which is good for the style. Overall it was worth the wait and an interesting IPA."
""
"One of my top 5 favorite beers still after all these years."

"Overall - overall a great ipa, massive hop nose and flavor with a medium body that is drinkable in the colder months. I will certainly return next year for the celebration!"
""
""
""
""
"I may have just given off an air of hop fatigue, but that's just not the case. What is true, however, is my weariness of late of brewers who claim an all-satisfying balance in their big-ass bitter offerings, in the hope of worldwide acceptance, I suppose, when nothing of the sort is actually on offer. So, to summarize, this is indeed a pretty stellar IPA, but there's nothing particularly wintery, in terms of malt-upsizing, about it. Glad to have finally made its acquaintance, though, certainly."

"O: Good , solid IPA. Doesn't get too ridiculous with the hopping. Well balanced. Great for sitting next to the firplace and relaxing after work."
"O-Great IPA example, assertively bitter and dry in the west coast style. Hop aroma is somewhat low. I tend to prefer IPAs with a bit more hop aroma, and a touch more balance. But for Bitter Betty's this is an excellent IPA"

"O- One of the first craft beers I really fell in love with. I can't believe I have not reviewed it yet. Picked up a six pack for $6.99 and it certainly does not disappoint. You can hunt for all the whales you want, but the best beer might be in your grocery store beer aisle for $6.99."

"Overall a decent IPA. I enjoy drinking a few of these during the holiday because it gets me in the spirit and is pretty flavorful, but I wouldn't seek it year round if it were available."
"O- Overall a really great beer. I am a big IPA fan and this is definitely going on the top of my list."
"Overall: A perfect mix of good looks, and wonderful taste that I am happy to see return, if a little late, each year."
""
"Overall: It was a good beer. Well balanced, refreshing, moderate in just about every area. However, on the downside, the only area it really stood out in for me, was the mouthfeel. It's stuck in the limbo of being good, but nothing special. Nothing really jumped out or wowed me. In my opinion its overhyped and would not be touted so highly if it were a year round brew."

"Dark amber with a nice head and lacing. Smells Hoppy but not grabbing my attention. Its surprisingly malty up front but soon turns over to the hops. Taste of citrus, pine, mint. Sweetness and spice, bitter throughout A medium body, and pleasant alcohol warmth. I Finally have a favorite holiday beer. December is going to see its fair amount of Celebration."
""
"Overall: Wow... I've seen this beer hyped in the forum so I had to try it. No disappointment here. It might be in my top three favorites now. I'll have to see how I feel after the next five of them. My guess is fantastic. (Note: I am a hophead. If you are not, you won't like it as much.) Getcha some!"
"Amber, cloudy, gorgeous. Nice creamy head--at first about two fingers but diminishing to a quarter inch. Lacing rings the glass. Poured into a mason jar. Smells of pine and citrus. Very refreshing and, well, celebratory. Excellent mouthfeel. A little oily, hoppy, and some malt--an excellent balance. Wonderful. A bite, too, but a pleasant bite. When I went to the beer distributor he bragged about having several cases. I'm glad because I mean to go back."

"My house isn't covered in snow, but I like hops any time of year, and this one has ""fresh"" hops. That's pretty much all I taste. Piney hops with a pretty bitter aftertaste to get you in the mood for time around the Christmas tree. Hopefully I have been a good boy and will see lots of beer under the tree!"

"O: I can't find a fault with this beer. I expect no less from the king of IPAs, Sierra Nevada.. but this just might be their best."
""
""

"Well balanced. Bitterness lingers long after the sip. As it warmed the malt grew more prevalent; astrigency shifted mostly to the aftertaste. A rich, well balanced IPA with a bockiness perfect for the winter months."
""

""
""
"O: Overall I think that if a person is into IPA's or hoppy beers, this is a good celebratory beer for them! It would go well with anything from meats and cheeses on crackers, to a dinner with ham."
"Really nice beer , will pick up a few six packs before it disapears off the shelf"
"O: This is certainly one of my favorite beers out there. They don't mention on the package that it's pitched with yeast which gives it a great taste similar to a belgian IPA. For the price, it's the best value I've been able to find (paid $13 for a 12 pack). Pick it up around the holidays - worth a try!"
""
""
""
"O: I'm pretty impressed with this beer. This is the first time I've had a Celebration, but I like it. It's not as hoppy as my favorite IPA's, but that's not really the idea. I'm glad I bought a 6 pack."
""
""
"Overall, I love this beer.... Sierra Nevada did an excellent job with this year's ""Celebration"".... Well balanced and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite a decent IPA. Nice combination of pine and citrus. Not a ton of malt, making this one quite hoppy and fairly bitter for a 6.8% brew. I enjoyed it."
""
"O: This brew embodies the California holiday season: warm, spicy, and sugary sweet, all topped off with awesome hoppiness."
""
""
""
""
"Celebration pours a beautiful dark amber caramel, bordering on ruby and brown. The beer has a fantastic creamy white head with the faintest tan hints, and it lasts forever, sitting two fingers width up from the beer. The beers body is hazy with carbonation bubbles, but clear of sediment. Lacing is fat and sticky, sliding down the glass slowly and leaving some nice fangs and walls on the side of my glass. This beer looks festive and gorgeous. On the nose the beer smells superbly piney, like a Canadian forest. Rich sweet pine notes meld with almost-cloying sweet caramel malts to hint at some alcohol spice. This smell is what a classic American IPA should smell like. The beer tastes sweet with a wonderful pulpy bitter pine and grapefruit marriage. As the beer enters the mouth and moves over the tip of the tongue the almost-cloying sweet caramel malt plays strongly, but that is swiftly met by the mouth biting bitters, which are not too strong, but are definitely present to bring strong grapefruit and pine flavors into the mouth to stay. The bitters almost bring the flavor into medicinal and stale bread flavors, and definitely walk a fine line as they touch upon the flavor thresholds, but maintain the more appealing tastes of pine and grapefruit, and thus provide a lovely refreshing taste. On the mouth, the beer feels medium bodied with some creamy carbonation and a nice bitter bite that tingles on the tongue. The mouth is left quite dry with islands of sticky saliva and a little astringency left on the tongue. Overall this is a very solid American IPA. Is this the libation of the holiday gods as some people would have you think? No, of course not, it is just a solid example of the classic American IPA, and a perfect time-machine to when the American IPA was first rising as a style. A solid go to drink that is relatively cheap and easy to find. The beer is perfect for those looking for a bitter bite, but it really isn’t amazing."
""
""
"O- I guess I was expecting a bit more. I think I will have to update my review after a few more of these. My friends raved so much about this beer, but I guess it is just above average for me. It is very well balanced and easy to drink. I can't really relate to Christmas time with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I had no expectations for this beer as I just bought it as a one off to fill a mixed sixer and all I have to say is WOW. I love when I'm surprised by a beer and this brew blew me away. I'm going to purchase a case amid make this a staple for the holiday season. A must have."
""
"O – This is a great IPA. You get the same blast of hops that you would get from a DIPA without the ABV. I was expecting this one to be a bit more balanced due to the darker color, but the sweet malts come out more as the beer warms. I’m glad that Sierra Nevada puts out an IPA in the winter time; it’s a nice switch from the much darker and heavier beers that tend to go hand-in-hand with the colder months. This is a very tasty and drinkable brew that has enough hop bite to warm you up."
"O: This is a solid brew, though it doesn't really live up to all the hype that it gets on the site. Its hop profile is pretty bland for an IPA, and the only real saving grace is the nice bitter/peppery finish that lingers in the mouth afterwards. I'll get a few sixers during the holidays, but it's nothing I'd really go out of my way for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is complex enough to try this time of year. I'd recommend getting it on tap somewhere; but if you like IPAs, the bottle is just fine. In this price range, Sierra Nevada is hard to beat."
""
""
"In my humble opinion, Sierra Nevada rarely goes wrong, and their Celebration Ale is no exception. I look forward to this brew every year, and I am always satisfied with a nice lightly roasted IPA for the winter time."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable seasonal IPA. Whole cone hops give it a distinct flavor similar to SN Hoptimum. It's a shame this is just a seasonal, as it is a good everyday IPA. Price is very reasonable and even better for the quality of the brew."

"I am thoroughly impressed with this beer.. I will be bringing it into my account on draft and am interested to see what my guests think of this.."

"This is a very good IPA. I am a very big SN fan and this one didn't disappoint me. Celebration reminds me of SN Torpedo but has a fresher hops complexity so I find it a little more bitter than Torpedo but I find I love the hops bitterness. The taste lingers in your mouth for quite a while but its a good flavor so I don't mind it at all. It is a strong beer at 6.8% so it does creep up on you and can hit you hard but its a slow sipper so I know when to stop and take it easy. Overall this is a great winter brew or, for a matter of fact, its good all year round. Enjoy!!!"
""
"Overall: I really enjoy this beer and consider this a great IPA. It's very nice clean and crisp with a pleasant mild aftertaste. I consider this IPA very balanced in every category and extremely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is one of the great, widely available seasonals. It is definitely outside the norm of winter seasonals, but it is deliciously drinkable, nicely warming, sweet, bitter, just everything one can look for in a good beer, and everything one expects from a Sierra Nevada beer. The mouthfeel holds it back from true greatness, but really the beer tastes great, smells delicious, and looks fantastic. Buy yourself a case of this and go into hibernation for the winter; you will thank me (and everyone else who will inevitably recommend this brew) later. 16.5/20"

"O: A quality bottle-conditioned fresh hop ale. compare with the Northern Hemisphere Harvest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Hoppy bitterness to begin with and finishing off somewhat milder. Not too bitter but still keeps a lot of flavor."
"O - A fresh hop ale with a strong melanoidin and subtle roasted character. Yeasty notes are present that are very surprising in a Sierra Nevada brew."

"O: A quite tasty IPA that is both well hopped and well malted. Great balance of flavors with a profile that comes across as somewhat of a deep, earthy ale that, even as an IPA, fits well with the winter season. A superb offering at a great price, showing yet again that you can get world class beers without destroying your budget."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This was my first IPA in a while and I was glad to have it. I found it well-balanced and flavorful, but in a world of stupid-high IBU brews, this was a touch simple. Sometimes, however, simple is good. I'll gladly drink this again."

"Easy to see why they release this brew during the holiday season - its rich flavors are perfect for this time of year."

"Celebration pours a ruby/golden color with about a 1 1/2 finger head. Great lacing all the way down on this one as well. Grapefruit nose with some malt on end. It's all malty sweetness up front then the bitterness comes in. It's very easy drinking and a great beer all around. This beer reminds you why Sierra Nevada is the granddaddy of craft beer."

"O: Easy to drink and very well balanced - the bitterness of the hops and the sweetness of the malts are really in harmony. Very enjoyable and one I look forward to each holiday season. Definitely sessionable."

"O: A truly great beer. It kicks like a real IPA, but is super refreshing to make it a good session beer. It also seems to have a bigger malt character which isn't as prominent in other Sierra Nevada brews."

"O - a great year for celebration, I love picking this one up every year, going to age a few and see how it mellows in the spring. This is a must grab for any hops lover. I wonder if this beer actual does vary from year to year or is it me who changes with the seasons?"
""
""
"O:soild fresh and drinkable ipa but not strong enough flavors"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall, like many, I love celebration season. This is a great fridge beer that I stock regularly and often bring out when going to a non craft crazy place. As with anything Sierra Nevada, you really can't go wrong and the distribution is fantastic as you can find this in fine supermarkets."
""
"O: This is an updated review, because either the Celebrations I had last year were sub-par, or I was just crazy - I've updated this from a good beer to a great one, pretty much as good as the Torpedo. It's more balanced than the Torpedo, slightly more malty and sweet, but still has fantastic, bright hop flavors."
"O: this is one of my favorite beers of all time and I have a little party in my head when I hear from someone that it is out. The only reel upside to the commercialization of Christmas is that this beer comes out earlier and earlier every year."
""
""
""
"O: This is the 2011 Celebration ale, so it might have lost some of its characteristics over the course of the year, but I didnt notice. I got a very quality IPA, and from Sierra Nevada, I would expect nothing less than quality. Did not disappoint, even after aging a year. Look forward to trying the 2012!"
""
""
""
"Overall: I think I like this a little more then torpedo, wish it was a year round beer."
""
"O: Don't think I'll be going back to this one and possibly not back to any Sierra Nevada IPAs again. In my opinion, each has been overrated for my taste. I consider myself to be quite the hophead and I have been let down by this beer as well as the Torpedo in the past. From the reviews I thought I'd love this beer. From my personal taste, it wasn't what I'd hoped. Their pale ale is fine, but I've come to question if their reputation is taking precedence over people's taste buds."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Elegant in its simplicity. A must!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Didn't blow me away like it did others. Pours a nice copper brown with one of the thickest heads I've seen personally, and fairly impressive lacing. At first it was seriously bitter with a lot of flavors swirling around in the background. The most prominent to me was a pine flavor with a hint of grapefruit and a metallic aftertaste. I let it sit for a few minutes and tried it again, which resulted in more grapefruit and less bitter pine taste, so I'm thinking I may have tried it too cold. Overall a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thank God Sierra still doesn't feel the need to make Celebration a crowd pleaser. Instead the 2012 is a hophead's delight, with significant bitterness and a chewy mouthfeel that will be rough on some palates. Make no mistake even though Sierra has gone global, Celebration is a true-to-form, classic west coast ipa. More robust and flavorful than this fall's Northern Hemisphere beer. Excellent!"

"Overall = A very sought after, yet pretty available Winter Seasonal. It breaks the mold from most winter seasonals’ by not being a complete malt bomb (which are awesome at this time of the year as well). Just a nice “fresh hop” IPA with just the right amount of maltiness to taste right when it is sub 40 degrees outside."
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Hmm, not impressed with this one (in general I'm not a huge East Coast IPA with a few exceptions). I guess all the hype plays against it in a way because I wasn't expecting such a humble beer. It is simply a good IPA that doesn't try anything ballsy and delivers a fulfilling, if not memorable, experience. Would I drink it again? I will return to it for next years release but glad I didn't opt for the sixer this time around."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Right from the start, i knew it was going to be awesome, the body is murky and the thick fluffy head only yields when i grow impatient and sip it away. Pommegranet, apple, grapefruit hit the nose with an awesome sweet metalic malt backbone. The taste followz the nose, but with a sour citrus note, sweet malts again are the backbone and grapefruit bitterness finishes it off with a slit alcohol twang to close it out. Though this may not have been the example of what celebration tasted like a year ago, i love it, and would trade my 2012's for this, any day."

"Poured into a Half Acre snifter. Pours a dark amber/brown color, with a frothy and bubbly tan head...slight haze, but relatively translucent. Head dissipates, leaving a thin layer of bubbly white head. Fresh earthy aroma, with fresh hop, malt and some sweetness character. Taste is super fresh; extremely balanced between hop, spice and bitter profiles, nothing dominates, very pleasant. Mouthfeel is enjoyable, smooth, not too bitter, with a light sense on the finish. Overall very enjoyable beer. Looking forward to several of these for Thanksgiving. Cheers."

"Great brew on its own merits, but again, not sure where the seasonal comes into play here. Still, a sixer of this on Christmas morning would do me just fine."
""
""
"O - Its not the best IPA in the world, but its one of the most consistently great ones. Huge gobs of caramel malt play off of piney and grapefruit heavy hops. The hop profile gives the illusion of an inclusion of subtle but warming winter spices. A classic, as always."
""
""
""
""
"I love winter beer and I love IPAs. This combines the two categories right in the frosty heart of December. And it's not even Thanksgiving yet. Please go out and try (buy) this beer if you like ale."

"Celebration Ale is loved by many on this website for a reason. Great stuff, and not one to pass up during the holiday season. This is one of my favorite food beers too."
""
"O - This one lives up to its name, it is worth celebrating especially if you like a nice wet hoped Ale. Definitely will be a go to for me every year just to celebrate this brew. I think I found a new favorite late fall/winter beer, Cheers!"
""
"Overall, this is a great winter-time seasonal, very unique and has a superb hop profile that really isn't like anything else on the shelves. It is a triumph of balance, the malt give great flavor but is not to sweet, the hops are impressive but do not overwhelm, and it ends up being incredibly drinkable for the amount of flavor it produces. Hopefully available till the day I die."
"This is almost the perfect IPA for winter. It has plenty of hop bitterness and taste along with a warming effect. I could see myself hunkering down with a case of these on a cold winter night."

"Overall- One of my favorite seasonals. Great IPA with some nice alcohol warmth to warm you up in the cold NH winter."

"Overall- Solid beer, but from how it was last year I am a bit disappointed. The sweetness and vibrant taste of the hops are not there. At least not to the bar that they have set previously."
"This is a very drinkable, hoppy beer. This is one of my favorites and I look forward to it every year. It is very well balanced and absolutely delicious. One of the best IPAs around."
""
""
""
""
""
"The color of this beer is absolutely spectacular. Hazy and orange/red in color. it has an off white head with nice lacing. Aroma of fresh hops, alcohol, yeast, and subtle nuances of spice. The taste starts off very hoppy and continues to be, well, hoppy. It has a very nice warming sensation on the palate, although it isn't too heavy. It truly is an outstanding IPA."
""
"O - I really liked this one, so much in fact that I am going to have another one. Also would not mind this as a follow up to a Sam Adam's Winter Lager. A must try for the winter season,"
""
""
""
""
"High C+"
"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a long lasting, fluffy white head and good amount of lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, caramel malt and ripe fruit. Body is medium and crisp. Taste is similar to aroma. Finish is long, grapefruity. Delicious, well balanced IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O - this is an excellent offering for a winter IPA, which to me seems a little unusual; perhaps slightly overrated bc of availability, nevertheless easy to get here in CO; also, well-balanced between malt and hops; accessible for most anyone and loved by geeks...that says a lot"
"O - Sierra Nevada Celebration doesn't quite encapsulate the holiday feel it's inviting label's landscape suggests, but damn if it isn't an amazing IPA! Celebration honors the harvest as the season shifts to winter. The deep hop and malt flavor begs to be pondered with it's intricacies, inviting the partaker back for yet another sip, time and time again. A snow day and roaring fire would pair perfectly with this winter IPA!"
""
""
""
""
"Over all a great beer I look forward to every year. For $6.99 a six pack it cannot be beat, will be a staple in my fridge throughout the winter. Incredibly smooth and incredibly bitter"
"O: I look forward to this every year and it never lets me down. It's a perfect beer for the cool winter evenings on the patio in Phoenix."
""
""
"O- This is an excellent IPA and balance seems to be the name of the game with this one. Malt, and Hops work together to make this an excellent beer."
""
""

"I drink it by the case. It's not the most aggressive, or the most nuanced, but it's fresh, clean, and so drinkable it's insane. Bonus points awarded for making an entire beer season better."
""

"O: This is a beer Ive had a number of times and I will certainly continue to have. Honestly, there is nothing mind blowing about it, but its really solid from start to finish, and something about that extra bit of sweetness and spice give the flavor profile a very ""holiday season"" feel. Merry Christmas!"
"O - one of my first favorite beers (nflmvp gave me a sixer for my 21st), unless they do something horrible to it it will remain a perennial favorite"
""
""
""
"Overall: Great beer but unfortunetely different this year. They either used less hops or substituted some. Either way still an american classic and a great beer."

"Overall a great wintertime beer for celebrations, or just any night of the week. A standout beer for the style, big and bold flavor but without trying too hard. Definitely a sessionable beer for those cold winter evenings."

"Overall: One of my favorite beers - just in time for the season with 6.8% of holiday cheer! Beautiful appearance with wonderful lacing around the pint glass from start to finish. A great balance between the malts and hops with a nice nose. The perfect pint as the weather turns a bit colder."

"O - Like so many others, I look forward to this wintertime brew each year. It has remarkable balance with a complex caramel malt bill similar to a marzen (plus the hops, of course). The fresh floral hops are notable as well. This is a beer without many weaknesses. I typically go for the big citrus, hop forward IPAs but this one is delicious in an entirely different way. I expect to go through a few cases of this stuff this winter."
"An exceptional full-bodied ipa that is perfect for the holidays and the grey boring days that follow. My personal favorite beer of the year a must have on any Christmas list! If you like the regular pale ale or the torpedo it's a nice variation and change that's outside the box. Great beer to get snowed in with."
"Overall a 4.25. Personally i am a bit underwhelmed after so much hype surrounding this. 4 for an IPA from me does not feel right. Try it once. Good drinkability though. Hop heads will be slightly disappointed."
""
""
"Pours a deep Carmel-orange w tons of head great lacing and good head retention as you sip it (or chug it or guzzle it). It smells of Christmas trees and baked cookies. It's very hop forward w piney piney hops at first then sweet caramel and toasted bread before the citrusy hops come in to close the sweet deal w a nice citrusy bitter finish that lingers. This brew is easy to drink w a slick yet sticky lip smacking mouthfeel. I look forward to drinking this beer every year and it never disappoints. One of the best IPAs you can get anywhere and top notch seasonal release I always seek out."
""
""
""
"O: a really nice beer - crafted with excellence with nothing more than water, hop, yeast, and barley, but it had a very distinct and autumnal/holiday character."
""
""
""
"Price + quality + balance = a strong overall beer. Readily available? Count me in."
""
"O: An interesting choice Sierra Nevada has made, to have an IPA for a winter seasonal in lieu of some of the more traditional winter styles (porter, winter warmer, etc). But why not? It's a damn good beer and it sells very well. There's a great deal of complexity coming from the hop profile, and that fresh hop taste is what sets it apart."
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours copper with a thick, off-white head that dissipates slowly. A lot of lacing gets left behind as the head recedes. There are plentiful tiny bubbles rising in the beer. There's a nice citrus and pine hop aroma accompanied by caramel malt. There's some grain the smell as well. The flavors of this IPA are well-balanced. There's a strong malt backbone, but the hops also shine through. It's bready with some sweetness. The citrus and pine aromas come through soon after that and leave a mild lingering aftertaste. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth and this is very drinkable. This is an excellent beer."

"Just tapped a sixtel of fresh Celebration. Absolutely amazing mouthfeel and aroma. Definitely malty but with a perfect balance of hops. Amazing that it is only 6.8 %. Will be loving this for days to come. Perfect beer for upcoming football games. I have had it before in bottles but amazing fresh on draft!"

"2012 I had this at 4.75.  2014 is good but lacking the oomph that a fresh hop should deliver."
""
"O: Solid beer but overrated."
"Whether you call this a malty IPA, or a hopped-up amber/red ale, or a winter warmer, or whatever - it doesn't matter. Call it a stout for all I care. Just know that this beer is delicious. And the fact that it's a seasonal release around my favorite time of the year (the joyous bridge from Thanksgiving to Christmas) gets me that much more excited to pick it up each year. The holidays would not be complete without this beer in my fridge. I always try to make it last far into the spring - usually doesn't make it that long."
"Drank this one as soon as it came in stock here. Only a couple weeks old, and it shows. This is one of Sierra Nevada's best beers, and that really says something."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is extremely well balanced and very tasty. There is a lot of hop aroma and flavor without being over the top. There is also a nice malt backbone to balance without getting in the way of the hops or becoming too sweet. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely very good, but also kind of ruggedly one-note."
""
"This beer pretty much takes what Southern Hemisphere does and takes it to a whole new yet far simplified level. In a way, I prefer this, because as an avid hater of ""seasonal beer," SN made a beer here that could be enjoyed at any time of the year, but it wouldn't be nearly as fresh if they did release it year-round. Great stuff, and a really adequate way to chime in the holidays. Another triumph for SN!"
""
""
"God I love this beer. I look forward to it every year. It actually isn't the most amazing IPA, but I've grown to look forward to it every year. I can't imagine decorating a tree or stringing lights without a Celebration. It's just part of the season..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An incredibly well-balanced offering from Sierra Nevada. Not a whole lot of room for improvement. I always look forward to Celebration's release but decided to finally take the time to review it."
""
"This is some awfully good stuff. It pours a hazy copper with about a one finger white head and delicate spider web like lacing. The nose is floral, resin, biscuit, and spices. Taste is a sweet citrus with a little spice and hops on the finish, basically following the nose. Mouthfeel is very nice with a mild bitter citrus aftertaste. It is easy to see how this is so well regarded. But then again, Sierra Nevada seems to never miss on their releases, at least the ones I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice firey bronze with a thick off white head. Great lacing. A great hoppy married to sweet aroma; floral and lemon hops on top a doughy malt base.Flavor is much the same with the lemony and floral hops shining on top a thick somewhat doughy malt base that offers hints of toffee hiding out there. A sharp, piney finish to this. A nice creamy, active mouthfeel. Overall, a nice beer. Kinda reminds me of Odells Town Pump Pale in that both seem like they could just as easily be labeled a dry hopped amber as easily as an (A/I)PA, though this one is certainly far more hoppier and complex than Town Pump. Definitely glad I gave this a second shot."

"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium orange amber, one finger fine to medium white head with moderate retention and great lacing. Aroma of piney and herbal hops, sweet malt. Flavor dominated by herbal and piney hops, light grapefruit, decent sweet malt backbone, very nice. A nice IPA and great annual treat. Every year I'm surprised again how great this tastes."

"I tried Celebration Ale in my first 6 months of drinking beer and could not put it down. I had labeled it the worst beer I've ever had. Not long after I had a similar experience with Lagunitas' IPA. But, after some time developing a taste for big hops and such, I've revisited a lot of these beers with different results. The Lagunitas IPA still does nothing for me, but I rather like Celebration Ale. It's reddish body and sticky head looks nice. Mild hop aromas and flavor with a surprising woodiness to it (an appropriate label for sure). It's an easy drinker that doesn't give up any flavor in doing so. Hops can be pungent, but it feels more like they are there to force into savoring smaller sips rather than gulp it down."

"Pours a clear amber brown color with a two finger white head that lasts a bit and form nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of caramel malts, citrus, spice and floral hop. The taste has nice malt sweetness in the back ground with a grapefruit citrus hop that is very pronounced balancing it out. Has a lingering bitterness and a dry finish."
""
""
"O: This is good, but I'm somewhat perplexed about the ""fresh hop"" statement on the label. There was a time that it didn't say this - I don't know if there was a change in recipe, or simply a change in labeling. But there's nothing in the flavor nor aroma that would have made me think it was made with fresh hops. Either way, it is tasty, but there are several (even non-seasonal) better American IPAs out there (fresh hop or not)."

"Aroma of grapefruit, earthy hops, pine, sweet malt. Appears a deep copper with hints of ruby; small off-white head that lasts; notable effervescence of tiny bubbles. Flavor is pine bitter but quickly gives way to chewy toffee malt, and finishes with a noticeable pine-resin astringency. Palate is medium and chewy up front but is dominated by astringency at the finish."

"Golden with a generous head that slowly dissipated. Smells of hops - piney, citrus, and spicy hops. This is a bitter brew, tasting principally of hops as indicated by the nose. This is an IPA, so i expect bitter, and thankfully the piney, citrus, and spicy flavors are there too. Still very drinkable, ending dry and bitter. Makes me want some more."

"What a peculiar pick from the cellar. This thing pours an imposing amber gold with a finger of slightly off white head that dissipates within a minute. Wonderful lacing. The nose is dominated by sweet and vinegar malts - heavy caramel and milk chocolate with a touch of something special. I cannot believe how well this holds up after over five years. Instead of getting funky and offset, this beer goes in such a unique direction. It makes me appreciate the malty complexities involved in the original recipe. A delight on the tongue."
"Is this a winter warmer, a strong ale or an IPA? I am not sure - I just know that it is darn tasty."

"I still think it is too dark and bitter for the style, but who says the style has to be a certain way. It's a great quality brew. And I have a ton of it!"

"O - this was quite a surprise. i didn't think this would be all that great from what i had heard from a few different friends - but it was a nice treat! the appearance could've been a bit better coming from one of the bigger craft brewers, but all other aspects make up for it."
""
""
"Caramel color with a medium sized tan head. There was a nice flowery hop aroma. The flavor was nicely malty, a bit sweet and had a strong flowery and grapefruity hop presence. There was a light hop bitterness on the finish. A nice IPA overall with a good malt balance."

"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale: Very good offering from Sierra Nevada. The body has a ruby red tint to it and a bountiful head which make for an attractive looking pour. Linger over the aroma, and you get an idea of what is to come. The Celebration is smooth and very balanced. The malt is not overpowering and piney hops blend in nicely. Highly recommended."

"this beer really surprised me. its' looks were slightly decieving. i wasn't expecting such a drinkable IPA. it has a golden amber hue with a fair amount of foggyness. the smell is unmistakably that of an IPA. it has that tartness to it that becons a sip. upon putting it to my lips the foam had a creamy taste that flooded in with some citrus and tangy tastes that quickly fleeted into a lasting hop bitterness. once in my mouth the carbonation was bouncing on my tounge enthusiastically. this one of my new favorite american IPAs. it's a shame it's only around for the holidays. cheers!"

"This beer is overstocked at my local shop and so I was able to buy an entire case of this stuff for $18.50. Pretty happy about that. Anyway, I poured this one into a pint glass and started reviewing. Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a nice 1/4 inch white head. Hops are the focus of this beer and it has a nice citrus flavor. I can taste sweet orange peel flavors and balanced with a nice hop spiciness. Malts are in the background but still there and slightly sweet. It's a great IPA and I'll be buying this brew again for sure."

"Very bright, exciting flavors and aromas from this one. Big hop flavor and nose, and the malty sweetness was well played. I enjoyed how each hop characteristic almost had their own introduction and time in the spotlight, but by the middle of the beer, they all came together in harmony."
"O - I really enjoyed trying this brew again, and forgot how good it really is. The bitterness is strong in this beer, but I find that to be a great quality and even a bit warming. I didn't even have this very fresh, and the flavor was still very puckering and addictive. This is definitely one of the better IPA's out there and one to really look forward to at the end of the year."

"Fantastic! Had it on-tap at a local lounge and it did not disappoint. The color was a amber/copper and it had a citrus/pine smell to it with some warm malt sweetness. It was bitter but not overpowering, many different hop flavors with a malt caramel backbone. A very drinkable IPA; very smooth, not too overwhelming. Perfect for the festive season."
"O: I can definitely look forward to picking this up around the holidays. It's a nice change from the winter warmers or spiced beers. Hoppy and fresh."
""
""
"Overall - One of Sierra's better offerings. The bitterness can get a bit overwhelming at times, due to it's long linger time. Taking a few minutes to reset brings you back to the beauty in this beer. Despite this minor nitpick, this is a very good beer."

"Sierra Nevada Celebration is a holiday tradition in our house. I always look forward to getting this beer during the holiday season. It's subtle head perfectly laces the glass. This well carbonated, medium bodied beer create an easy drinking true Sierra classic."

"port high tide would be the other."
""
""
"The draft is pretty much the same. A very good beer that I would order any time I see it."
""
"Overall:	Not my type of holiday beer but being objective I would say that it was pretty good."
""
"Overall: I really have to hand it to Sierra Nevada. They're not the hippest or most experimental brewery out there, but this beer is a testament to their skill. It tastes like a classic beer, something you'd sip on in Milwaukee on a blustery winter night, watching football at a bar, alone, but happy."
""
""
"Bitter pine up front rounded by some grapefruit notes and balanced by a subtle malt sweetness. Feels lively in the mouth with intense fresh flavor. A very good ale."
""
""
""
""
"Now that I'm nearing the end of the glass here, I'm actually enjoying this beer more than in that initial taste. I'm a huge fan of American IPAs, and this one can certainly hold its own. As with other Sierra Nevada offerings I've enjoyed, I can taste the quality of the ingredients--especially the hops. Though I wish it finished a bit cleaner, the bitterness at the back does provide some added complexity. Well worth a try."

"Hinterlands ipa is similar, but this is still pushing the envelope even farther. You might as well pop five aspirins in your mouth and spit them back out without drinking any water."
"Medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer lies somewhere between sipper and gulper. The body is full enough to allow all the flavors to truly come out. It is also slightly sticky and a bit coating but never in a bad way. The carbonation is somewhat fizzy but does not detract from the flavors nor the experience."
""
""
"Overall: An excellent beer with a very desirable, pleasant bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Definitely a drinkable session IPA. Hop flavor dominates with very little malt character, but no distinguishable flaws. A solid IPA, but nothing overly spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Another top value offering from SN."
"As this beer has plenty of body and hoppy bitterness you need to be careful with the food to match with. You need something with enough punch to carry the flavour, but at the same time not be a filling main course. I would suggest an entree sized wild game selection. Venison is particularly well suited to the Celebration Ale."

"Celebration is one of the best IPA's available. It is probably too late to pick up a six pack, but these bottles still taste great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: love having this come around every year as it's one of my all time favorite beers. I love sierra nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
"I finally got around to having one of these for the sake of review. It let me down a bit. It looked like a good winter ale and was not to sweet or heavy on spices. My problem was the classic SNPA hoppiness was all I really tasted. It wasn't bad, but I hoped it would differ more from the flagship pale ale."
""
""
"O - This is a very tasty brew. It certainly sticks with the trend of SN not disappointing."
""
""
"The mouthfeel is comfortable, not too tingly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: would be a year round drink for me if it was available year around."
""
""
""
""
"O - Hard to fault this beer other than to say it is a very sessionable IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Awesome IPA that is always worth drinking during the winter months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'd give even better scores with this one due to consistency and affordability but there are too many other IPAs available to me that I've enjoyed a bit more such as Aroma Coma, Blind Pig, Hopfather, Just Outstanding, Union Jack and Sculpin. To Celebration Ale's defense, it certainly does hold up leaps and bounds better over time than the above beers I just compared it to. Always nice knowing I don't absolutely have to drink this one as fresh as possible, although it's still preferred."
""
""
"As I've mentioned before - I'm not into hops much - but this is very nice beer, and I will definitely have it again. Nice golden honey with a foamy everlasting head. Strong bitter, citrusy taste which is balanced well with the sweet malts. Nice, nice, nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - easily drinkable and enjoyable, but kind of a let down. this bottle is 86 days old by my calculations, so maybe this is one beer that must be had as fresh as possible. maybe i'll try again next year."

"O: Very enjoyable beer here, will be looking forward to this seasonal release in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a very good seasonal. I'm not the biggest hop head but this is definitely one of my favorite IPA's. I'm proud to bring this to any Christmas party during the holiday season."
""
"Overall: one of my favorite IPAs while I can get it. it makes winter that much more Bearable."
""
""
"O: A good beer every year. It is a well done IPA, bitter, but not over done. It has good citrus and a bit of malty biscuit, and it is smooth and dry."
""
"O: Another tasty entry from one of my favorite breweries."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I give two Schlitz about Celebration. Beer for beer, Sierra Nevada may be the finest brewery in the country (or maybe that crown still goes to Founders)."
"overall, a damn good beer but not one i go gaga over like so many others. which is fine, taste being subjective and all that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a dry beer with a decent amount of bitterness, but the flavors last quite some time. You can enjoy this beer when it's cold or when it's warmed up to room temp which makes it a great beer to share with some non-craft drinking friends."

"Pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with an off white head over an inch tall thanks to an aggressive pour. Carbonation is visible. Head recedes to about 1/4 of an inch and leaves die nice rings of lacing in my glass. Smell is primarily of sweet citrus, more of an orange smell than the usual grapefruit, with a secondary scent of pine coming in also. The taste hi lights both of these flavors as well as the hops. In the taste I get the malt first followed by the pine then the citrus, the aftertaste contains both the pine and citrus, but is dominated by the pine taste. Mouthfeel is average for an IPA, carbonation is assertive. Overall, great beer. I can say though that there are better fresh hop IPAs. This is one of the reasons I love Sierra Nevada. This beer is worth buying a 12 pack."
""
""
""
""

""

"Poured a hazy, rust red/brown with a few fingers of offwhite head with some good density to it. Excellent 'whipped cream'-like retention, and laces sheets. Nose has a great wet hop character, raw and resinous citrus of orange and grapefruit character, some tropical notes and a general herbal/grassiness that I always seem to find in fresh hopped ales. Some sweet caramel breads behind the hops. Taste is bitter right off the bat, with some substantial citrus rind, pine, berries and floral/herbal hop notes again. Sweet caramell-y bready malts again that are secondary to the juicy and chewy hops. Medium full mouthfeel with a solid bitterness that hangs around long into the finish in a grassy fashion. A touch of alcohol and sweetness, with medium carbonation. Great flavours and complexity, I'm certainly curious as to how this ages."
"This beer is supposed to be world class, and I felt there were some promising aspects to my sampling of it. Perhaps I will try it again, heeding serving temp more carefully."
""
""
"M: Crispy sensation, it is a medium body what can be felt on the mouth, at some point it is a little astringent due to the bitterness, the end is fair of course it keeps the bitterness on your mouth."
""
""
""
"O - Fresh and tasty. I'll be looking for this next year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a nice orange amber color with good carbonation and a small, quickly dissipating head. Aroma is definitely piney with some spice scents. Flavor profile mimics the scent and is fairly well balanced for an IPA. This one does not overpower the hops but they are certainly there. Very nice IPA from someone who is not a big fan of the style."
""
""
""
"It was pretty dark for an IPA and kind of one dimensional. I was expecting more than just one hop character. Overall, not too bad, definitely a nice and bitter thick IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Perhaps the most complex IPA i have tried (not that i have tried hundreds). I was asking myself how an american IPA could be meant for the winter but now i see, this is absolutely perfect for the winter. Still extremely drinkable despite its intense bitterness. Great beer"
""
"O: Fantastic IPA, a truly great reason to look forward to the holidays. The flavors are simple yet powerful and provide a great tasting beer."
"Giant head and lacing. Extremely pretty red amber color. Perfect for the season. This is one I want to drink by a fire. Smell of cherry, hops, and some malt. Love the bite in the taste. Definitely a piney, hoppy taste that I love, mixed with some mild fruit. Honestly this is quite a good beer. Love the bite of the carbonation."
""
"A favorite for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good IPA, I'd like to try it fresh."
"Overall, this really caught me off guard. I wasn't expecting a tone, as I figured it was past it's prime, but I think if I had it fresh, it could easily be one of my top five favorite IPAs. I can say without a doubt, this is a beer I would buy by the case if it was readily available to me."
""
"Overall, a bit dissapointing. Good beer, not great beer."
""
"Hopiness is present almost immediately. Slight lacing on the head, not a lot present. Appearance is light red/brown, body is full of hops as stated previous. I tasted a slight hint of woodsyness with what to me was pine. No mint with this one, but feels a little dry with a slight after taste."
""
""
"A reliable gift year after year"
""
""
""
"I can't call this an IPA. I know it's in the style, but it isn't an IPA in my book. American Strong maybe? I dunno. Great though!"
"3 finger frothy off white head with excellent retention and lacing. Body is cloudy and golden with amber/crimson hues. Nice sweet citrus aroma with subtle floral notes. Flavor is mostly pine and woody hops, a little bitter with a subtly citrus sweet finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall a nice complexly hopped ale. Becomes more drinkable throughout the expierience, excellent"
""
""
""

""
""
"O - One of the greatest beers of all time, even more so given the availability & price. One of those beers you never forget, and one of the reasons I love beer like I do now."
""
""
"Celebration is a fantastic wet hopped ale. One of the best considering its price and availability. Though not overly complex, it satisfies hop cravings on cold winter nights. And that's all I could ask for."
""
"Overall, this is an exceptional ipa, a personal favorite and something that is always anticipated around the holidays."
""
"Hop-forward yet well balanced. Easy drinking but full of flavor. A great every-day IPA that won't bore you or tire your taste buds out."
""
""
""
"This is one fantastic IPA. I am currently on my second case and believe I will continue to buy it as long as it is available."
""
""
""
""
""
"Will buy a couple cases."

"O: I look forward to December each year to be able to get me some Celebration."
"O - Very fine IPA, best from sierra. Worth the wait for winter time."
"O: Mosdef a celebration of ingredients. Harmonious hop balance, smooth malt base. Easy to drink and a touch higher ABV than normal, giving extra holiday cheer. A holiday classic that I buy every year."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a world class beer. One that pulled me into tasting more IPA's. I may have had a different path into craft beer. I found most IPA's too bitter to enjoy, this is the beer that changed my mind. Now I enjoy most IPA's that are well made. I believe a balance of malt and hops is key."
""
"O - my favorite winter seasonal, and one of my fav IPAs"
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"I thought I had given this a negative review after I had bought some a few months ago. I got the wrong impression. I had thought it unbalanced, with too much hops and not enough malt. I bought a 12-er to bring with me to X-mas ""celebration(s)"" at my fiancee's family's house and am enjoying the S$%& out of it. Great beer! Huge hops, still not much malt flavor but no complaints here. Something was off with my palate last time I had it.. hadn't been eating enough maybe? Anyway, as the Bros. rate this, ""world class."" I loved it in the past and will continue to look for it. If only I could locate some Bigfoot in Indianapolis, as I used to back in the early 00s. Thanks SN. Glad I didn't review this and mislead any hopheads or beer fans in general. Important: no spices or other bullshit to ruin this beer despite its' winter seasonal status. Buy it, drink it, catch a buzz if you're a BA willing to entertain such notions."
"poured first into a tulip to check out the color...beautiful deep tawny golden almost amber held before infant solstitial morning light. the rest of the bottle put into a large yule stein (why not)..as it goes down, big dollop islands of pancake batter still remain. truly a celebration of the brewer craft! nose is not the hoppiest i've ever smelled, but it's strong enough to mask anything else. deep pine herbal menthol that shifts to taste seamlessly...nice complex flavors, of course, familiar territory, but the proof is in the pudding and live tasting. nice malt strength held as long as it could below as the hop character slowly overtook from the top. pretty dry finish that leads you to the next taste (and as said by another reviewer today, dangerously sessionable). for such a wallop of taste, the mouthfeel isn't as luscious as i'd like (like, say, Nugget Nectar). overall, a true celebration of this Yule/Solstice season of light, however you recognize it. i'll pick up a few more before they disappear. there is a similarity between this and Torpedo...i still prefer the year round Torpedo, but just by a hair"
"Prefer this one to Torpedo. For an Australian comparison I would go with Bridge Road Bling, because of the yeast presence and the strong presence of bittering hops in the taste. A well made beer, and this stuff is dangerously sessionable."
""
""
"Overall: Well crafted brew. Interesting to age. I opened '08 and '09 bottles this year and found that fruity 'cranberry' and 'apple pie' esters come out quite a bit, feels more 'boozy' and obviously more malty... I look forward to this one every year!"
""
"O- solid ipa wish this was year round. I would buy this over pale ale every time."
"A go-to every year. One of the best winter IPAs on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good all round IPA with plenty of grapefruit in the smell and taste."
""
""
"Overall: I look forward to cracking one of these open every holiday season. Great balance and hop profile. I'll definitely have more in the future."
"O-very tasty seasonal from sierra nevada. Plenty of hops and very drinkable. Loved it even more on tap"
""
"A really easy to drink tasty brew."
"Overall, this is an outstanding brew. Making it a seasonal makes it that much more enjoyable. This is very well executed and is a must try."
""
""
"O - A really nice holiday ale from Sierra Nevada. I bought a six pack and then went out the next day to get a case to make sure I had more on hand. Ive enjoyed it with pizza and Ive had it with steaks and it just seems to work with any food. I may pick up another case."
""
""
""
""
"O - Nothing to write home about, but still my favorite beer from SN."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very good IPA. Certainly not overly hoppy and I was expecting more of a resiny quality. Far from an indictment though as this was very enjoyable and I liked the more malty side to it"
""
"This is a good beer. Not exceptional is the least bit but enjoyable. Very hoppy with a good clean finish. About a 1.5 inch head. Citrus and pine notes. Reminds me of Bells Two Hearted but not nearly as good. Worth purchasing for some type of Holday celebration."
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer, I enjoied this one alot more then I thought I would. If you like IPA's, this one is for you!"
""
"D- Bleh. Don't want any more. A one dimensional IPA with that dimension being one I don't like. Made my stomach hurt too, won't be coming back to this one."
"Pours a hazy amber color that is not really transparent. The hops only have a slight citrus flavor to them, but they are well-balanced in the beer. The bottle says that this is a fresh hop beer. I get that taste from it, though I have no idea what that means. This is easily one of the best IPAs I have ever had, and it does not just fall into the obscurity of ""pretty good"" IPAs that I have had but could easily forget about it. After this beer goes off the shelves, it will be in the back of mind until next season when it is available again."
""
"A true celebration of the hops!"
""
""
"O: Love it. This is my favorite Sierra Nevada brew yet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is medium body but a little bitter at first. Something to get used to this beer does mellow out and then has a smooth feel that slides around easier then expected."
"Having had this beer twice, I can be fairly certain that this bottle was not as fresh as it should have been. Still an enjoyable IPA, but lacking the big, grassy, herbal wet hop aroma of a fresh Celebration. Will re-review later with a hopefully fresher bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Has a kick on the back of the palate, and comes off very hoppy, but I like that so this was a great, relaxing beer. Without the label I would have called it a Northwest IPA due to the strong taste."
""
""
"Over all this a very drinkable winter beer. It successfully blends an IPA with a spiced malt beer. I look forward to next year's batch."
""
""
""
""
"This pours a rich caramel-gold, lots of foam that slowly dies down while releasing all sorts of wonderful aromas. There’s a lot of hoppiness here—some light pine and evergreen and a big citrus leaning towards grapefruit. Absolutely tasty, with the citrusy and woodsy flavors backed by a sweet and caramelly malt backing. Enjoy the hop harvest with celebration but drink it fresh for full effect!"
"O- A fantastic fresh hop brew! Fantastically balanced featuring a great hop profile with a nice malt backbone. One of my all time favorites!"
""
""
"Overall, 2010 was the best version I've had. Still a good beer of course."
"Overall: Whoa! I'm loving this fresh hop taste! A delicious IPA that all hopheads should try."
""
"O - A nice IPA for winter, that sort of works. Smells, tastes, feels nice. A good change of pace from the maltier cold-weather brews."
"Poured into a pint glass, its topped off with a nice thick, light tan head that’s very creamy and bubbly. The body is a slightly burnt orange color and is pretty hazy with little carbonation. I only detected slight hop aromas, the spices were more present and seemed to be mixed in with some grape fruit, the malts are also fairly present here. Its light and crisp on the tongue and has a medium-to-light mouth feel. Its slightly tart over all, there are some hints of hops and spices in its after tatse. It goes down really smooth and there is almost no hint of alcohol."
""
"Overall a nice full tasting hoppy ale that had everything it needed to make a wonderful Winter Seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours an amber gold with a finger thick white head. Good lacing, color is darker than your typical IPA. Smells of citrus, pine, some toastiness, malts, and that typical SN resiny scent. Tastes great, piney hops, grapefruit, mild breadiness, and lingering tea-like bitterness. Medium bodied, slightly creamy, perfect consistency. Very similar to their pale ale in my opinion, only better."
""
""
"O: This beer tastes like it comes from Sierra Nevada to be sure. It tastes like a slightly less hoppy version of their pale ale. I'm not sure what makes it an ""ale for the holidays."" But the price was right, and it's certainly a drinkable beer. Just a solid pale ale."
""
""
""
""
"I am an irreverent beer snob!"
""
""
"Overall - I think I like the previous year's brew better than this. the body and flavor is a little watery. also I think that Celebration would be better as another style, maybe something with a little warmer feel to it. still a fine beer though."
""
"O/D- A delightful offering by Sierra Nevada. This beer reminded me how good a simple IPA can be, and how happy it makes me. Drinkable and refreshing. Thanks, boyfriend."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good holiday IPA that's affordable and easily accessible. Classic seasonal by SN."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoy Torpedo, this just tastes like a fresher, hoppier, smoother version. Not a radical departure, though, and probably the only seasonal IPA this time of year."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer but honestly I don't see what all the fuss is about. I guess I would drink it again though."
""
""
""
""
"A citrusy dry aftertaste finishes off a pretty decent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A pretty good beer, and a great bargain. Definitely one of the better fresh hop ales with lots of grass, pine, and earthy flavors."
""
""
""
"Anywho, good brew."
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid as hell six pack. A very great, widely available IPA for the holiday season. Maybe a tad overcarbonated... but other than that, an exceptional IPA."
"O-Delicious, one of the best straight IPAs I've had."
"PS - Could hardly taste the nutmeg and cinnamon this year! :)"
""
"A great IPA, try it out."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers."
"Overall : The lacing really stands out in this beer, very well done. This beer caught me off guard I wasn't expecting it to be this good. Serria Nevada's ability to put out quality products is beyond reproach IMHO."
""
""
""
"Overall Impression- I remember back in 07 and 08 enjoying the hell out of this brew! I only can give it a ""Good"" overall rating b/c it didn't hit all that I wanted in this style. The reason I bought this brew was b/c I'm celebrating the starting of Finals week tonight (just kidding). Will have this again without a doubt but not my absolute favorite from Sierra Nevada."
""
"certainly lives up to the hype, and a reason on its own to celebrate its release. Total 4.25"
""
"Nice head, floral and citrus aroma with hop notes. Grapefruit and citrus notes on the tongue, crisp, fresh and smooth with a slight bitter finish. Great taste, complex, well balanced. It's a seasonal brew, but but i'm not sure why. It could be consumed at any time of year as any other ipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A truly epic IPA. Unusual choice for a holiday beverage, but for hopheads, this is a classic."
"O - this is a fantastic IPA. I'm not one to choose an IPA as my holiday beer, but this one has a Christmas feel to it with the color and taste to be downed in front of my tree in the month of December. But forget all that. Experience this dandy of an ipa for the simple fact that it's a well crafted world class American ipa. Great beer"
""
""
""
"Foam head, flowery and sour citrusy aroma with hop bitterness, grapefruit and citrus notes on the tongue, crisp, wet and smooth, bitter finish. Great taste, powerful, complex, well balanced. A seasonal brew, but could be consumed delightfully at any time of year."
"Overall, a very good AIPA but, for me, not ""out there"" enough to be a great winter seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
" Not the most refreshing beer but with the the right body and carbonation for an IPA. Not stellar but worth a go once a year."
"I buy this every winter/holiday season without fail. It's always a pleasure to bring this one home. This year I'm enjoying it, but something seems a bit different. There's a piney/Listerine type hops flavor going on that I don't expect. Color is a nice golden hued amber, head is proper, lacing thin but stays intact. Smell is warm and inviting, hops being #1 in the nose. Flavor is a rich IPA with great tangerine/grapefruit notes and grainy carbonation. But, there is that pine sap antiseptic quality nudging through. The mouthfeel is a bit thick for my liking, and while the flavor is good, after one or two it gums up your tasting apparatus a bit. A very good beer, but I think this year (2011) it could be better, or maybe I remember it differently than it actually is."
""
"O: Really nice beer. Super happy I got to try it. It is one of the better IPA's I've had and at it's price you really can't beat it. Almost wish it was around all of the time. Definitely something I'll drink again."
""
"O- If you are a hop head and want the right kind of ale for the holidays, this is the one you need to pick up. Great beer."
"Overall, this is a big, hoppy, sweet (though not too sweet) and delicious IPA that I look forward to every year."
""
""
""
"O - The dank earthy hops just aren't my preference, beer is solid but one dimensional."
""
"Overall Drinkability - Pretty legit beer. Would probably even make a decent session."
""
""
"Although the ABV ist quite that high, you do notice it. Overall, its a very good IPA..a bit bitter, but still nice. Its a great brew for a cold day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very good fresh hop IPA. More hop forward than torpedo and not a traditional winter release but very good."
""
""
" One of the best from Sierra, Bravo"
"Really enjoy drinking this beer. Very good ipa."
""
"O: The grapefruit taste on this one is what makes it unique. Not exactly my thing, but I'm glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's always stunning to me how different fresh hopped beers are to dry hopped beers. I know it's an extreme case but I had a torpedo (great!) recently and the two beers have such a different profile. This beer is much more subtle and really drives home the malt balance. Great winter beer and always stellar"

"Dr. Very good, but one IPA is enough for me."

"O- Nice IPA, always have a 6er of this around the holidays, but would be fine in the summer as well if I could find it then"
""
""
""
""
"A great winter beer that is one of my favorite styles."
""
""
"Overall - A solid IPA from SN, with a generous amount of alcohol and hops. It is what a good IPA should be, I'll pick this one up again."
""
"Great ""IPA"" that has those winter ale contexts but without the overwhelming spice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Darker for an IPA, really nice appearance. Almost has a slight reddish hue. Smell is piney and has the slightest hint of some spices or something that makes me think of this normally great year round style as a winter beer. The taste is piney hops with a little citrus and some malt on the back. See a lot of reviews saying citrus hops dominate, but I certainly wouldn't say that compared to citrusy IPAs like Two Hearted. Pretty carbonated, but I don't dock anything for this. I think it needs that. Overall a great beer for me and I wish I would've gotten more than a six pack."
""
"Overall a really nice, tight, crsip winter seasonal IPA from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
"Overall - Fantastic amount of fresh hop bitterness.. I always look forward to when this beer comes out. It doesn't have a whole lot of citrus fruit flavour that is common in the IPAs that I enjoy, but it makes up for it in delicious malts and fresh hop flavour."
"Overall a very nice beer, I will be getting more for my holiday party this Saturday!"
"O: A fantastic ale. Truly a pleasure. Refreshing and well-balanced. Although this is characterized as an IPA I have heard of people aging it. I think I'll hold on to a few bottles of this 2011 vintage to see how she stands up."
""
""
"O - All these years later, it is still obvious why this is one of the beers that got me into craft beers. Just an excellent beer all-around."
""
"O- Very tasty beer. Above average IPA for sure, I'm just trying to figure out where all the hype has come from. Personally I prefer Torpedo but maybe it's the limited availability that has everyone worked up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This is pretty good. Very well balanced. The hop bite mixes very well with the flavor up front. This may be my favorite sierra nevada, Hard to say."

"Overall: A great example of the style, though it doesn't really do anything to add to it. Would probably be a go to if it wasn't a seasonal."

"Overall - Surprised to find such a nice hop missile during the winter months! I would LOVE to enjoy this on a hot summer day. I don't get the spices mentioned by other reviewers at all, NONE. This is a straight up IPA folks, NOT a winter warmer. I also got very little sweetness here, would have preferred a bit more to balance, otherwise an excellent IPA."
"The hop bitterness is kind of abrasive as well as the alcohol considering this beer is only around 7%. Doesnt really seem to be that complex either. The toasted bread provides a little bit of balance. Not really my thing but a solid IPA"
""
"Overall I thought this was one damn good American IPA, that somehow manages to set itself apart from all the other IPA's with a flavor that really works for the winter time and is a nice departure from the typical Winter Warmer seasonals. This beer had great drinkability, it had very good balance which isn't that common in American IPA's and it wasn't that bitter, I could definitely drink three or four of these in a sitting and it also goes very well with a nice holiday dinner. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, the aroma, taste, look, and mouthfeel were all spot on in my opinion. There wasn't anything that I didn't like or would change about this beer, it's great just the way it is. I will for sure be buying this beer again and I like the fact that it comes in twelve packs, it makes for a good beer to keep on hand for holiday partys. I highly recommend this beer, especially if you are tired of the large amount of heavily spiced winter seasonals. I can't say enough good things about this beer, so far this is one of my favorite Sierra Nevada sesonals, and a great American IPA. Great job guys this is one classic winter beer that I don't see going out of style anytime soon."

"The 6.8% ABV is pretty bold but worth the extra time to sober-up."
""
"Overall - This is an excellent seasonal IPA. With it's unique sweet and subtle hoppy flavors along it's spiciness, all this makes it an outstanding IPA. This isn't the hoppiest IPA around, but it still makes it a damn good one to drink!"

"O- I know there's a huge following for this beer and, though I've had it before and liked it, I never understood why it was so sought after. Now I know. Excellent."
"D/O- One of the better IPAs most will have although I will admit I'd rather have it be a seasonal, add to the experience I feel. Brings back memories every winter I have it! Last year while ice fishing...this year beating my sister in Scrabble..."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A must buy every year. It's not the most drinkable Ipa, but hey, it's a winter seasonal after all. If you're not into hoppy/bitter beers, steer clear. Otherwise, this is one of the best holiday ales for your $$$."
"This beer is one of my top picks for winter, pretty much perpetually. It's sessionable if you're careful and goes great with all that holiday food you're gonna be shoveling down. Highly recommended, as always."
"Pours a beautiful deep gold color with a nice two finger head. Pretty clear. Aroma is slightly tart citrus and caramel. Taste is like the smell, just way more pronounced and robust. Tart citrus up front that's balanced with caramel sweetness and bitterness. Very crisp and refreshing.Very drinkable."
""

"O-This is another great brew from SN. Unlike most of their mainliners, this one really packs a flavor punch. Loads of fresh, spicey hops and sweet caramel malt really give ya a solid sock in the mouth (in a good way). This is a real palette pleaser for IPA fans. Worth seeking out. I might even throw one in the cellar for 6 months."
"O: This beer is pretty darn good overall but there is something missing/ that needs to be added to make it special."
""
"O: The richer, spicier ""holiday"" taste elements are all beautifully tamed and balanced with bitter hops in what is a fantastic IPA. Probably the ultimate hophead holiday beer. This is one of the best IPAs I have had the pleasure of drinking. Do not pass on this one!"
""
"O: The result is a super drinkable IPA, perfect for a chilly evening. Has a very friendly character that imparts itself upon the drinker."
""
""
"I always look forward to the Holiday season to purchase this fine American IPA. It never disappoints! Perfect brown coloring, very aromatic, smooth drinking. The ABV can sneek up on you if you let it although it's hard not to turn this into a session beer. Festive tap marker - it's hard to find anything negative about this beer. Best when served on tap"
""

"This was terrific like most from Sierra Nevada. Seek it out for sure."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass 2011 edition. This pours an amber color with a large off white head which has good retention and leaves a lacing. The smell is mostly of hops pine and citrus with a little caramel. Feel is medium lots of mouth coating bitterness, taste is the way it smells lots of hop bitterness up front and it lingers after I swallow with a little malt sweetness in the middle, after a big foot this might be my next favorite sn."
"O-Of course SN would have an IPA as their winter seasonal, and of course it would be legit. Is it fair to say SN is underrated? I have been drinking Celebration since I was a teenager and damn it's good."
""
"If you are looking for an ipa for the season, this is the one you want!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into my trusty sniffer and got about 2 fingers width of an off white head. The beer poured a rather unremarkable chill hazed Orange/Red and left decent lacing. Upon first whiff I could smell numerous citrus aromas coming from the Cascade and Centennial hops that are generously used in this brew. In addition to hopping the beer when first brewed, Sierra Nevada dry hops Celebration after the first stage of fermentation is complete giving the beer it's bold aroma. The first sip of Celebration is reminiscent to shaking hands with an old friend; warm, inviting and friendly. This brew finishes clean with a slightly bitter side to it from the Chinook hops used in the brewing. Overall this beer is what a great Christmas season beer should be."
"Overall: SN is one of the world's best breweries. Almost always 85-90 material at the least. Not a big beer, but a quality session beer for the holidays. recommended, though not sure f 'll see out again. Not something i'd buy by the case but i'll buy another six next year probably. but thats probably more due to the fact of style preference more than a hit to the brew. ""A" beer material. The summary of this one is a fruity wet hops balanced masterfully with a fresh caramel malt. Dunno what the hell this has to do with the holidays, but whatever...its a really good brew."
""
""
"T: Caramel malts with a slightly burnt note, sharp green hop resin, some grapefruit pith and a nice pine hop bitterness."

"has a finer looking glass of beer ever been poured? i doubt it! absolutely sensational festive red color with a 2 inch head that resembles the first big pillowy snowfall. smells like whole cone hops, delicate and passive, but confident and obvious. resiny, floral notes hit the nose, with none of the spice warmer stuff the packaging suggests. taste is less than a standard american ipa in terms of hop bitterness, in fact its not bitter at all, but just a good well balanced ale, perfect for any season in my opinion, not just christmas time. a really well crafted beer, with a perfect mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation that lets you taste it all. nice finish as well with one last hop kick. really fresh and delicious. as big as sierra nevada has gotten, its products only continue to get better. great great brew. looking forward to the other 11 bottles left in the box..."
""
""
"O - A very nice beer. I am embarassed that I hadn't looked closer at it in the past. This is a solid and delicious IPA."
"O- Quite good, maybe too hoppy. The booziness is non-existent and I really enjoyed this beer."
"MO-First year that I've had this, but it wont be the last. Not a huge fan of the bigger hoppy beers but I do enjoy one occasionally and this one quenches the hopthirst."

"O - A very good and distinctly different IPA. This is a beer I look forward to every Christmas and this year it was outstanding as usual."

"In conclusion, this is a delightful holiday brew. Very festive and provides an added punch for cold winter days. Not a spiced beer, so again, sets itself apart from many other holiday offerings. Without a doubt a go-to winter seasonal brew. Go-to? What the heck, it's awesome fresh-hop glory!"
"In the fresh hop space, this is one of the best out there in my opinion. And the price makes it one of the best values in a quality beer."

"A great IPA that mixes pine hop and bready, cracker malt perfectly. There is a unique quality to this beer that doesn't quite sink in until halfway through the beer....I look forward to this every year of course."
"Bravo to Sierra Nevada for going way outside of the box on a winter seasonal. This is an annual holiday staple in my fridge."
""
""

"(D)- A solid IPA, though maybe not as ""Holiday"" or ""Festive"" for this time of the year as other beers out there, but it is a solid example for the style."
""
""
""
"Since I'm not really a fan of typical Winter Seasonals, this beer is one to look forward to this time of year."
"O - Not a bad IPA, but certainly not one of the best. The piney hop bitterness over powers the other flavors, it needs to be toned down."
""
"O: I should point out that I'm not a huge American IPA fan, and although drinkable (and slightly above average in the class, in my opinion), this one didn't change my position; the bitterness was just too overwhelming for me to give it good marks. I'm not totally disappointed I tried it, but I won't be going back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really enjoyed this beer and this may be the beer that brings me back to enjoying IPAs again. Interested to see what this does with a couple of months on it as well."
"O- this beer is not under the radar at all, but if you haven't had it yet you should. Not at all like a winter beer, but who cares, it's wonderful."
""
""
""
"Overall I don't think this is a great example of an IPA never mind a fresh hop IPA. The earthy flavors really ruin this ones potential. If you are an East Coast IPA guy (or girl) you will probably like this. Otherwise leave it alone."
"O- Solid beer, glad to finally try it, I see it all the time and always pass it up. Enjoyable but not a beer I would be craving to have again."
"Overall: One of the better Christmas Beers I've tasted. It has a good amount of hop flavor in the taste which contrasts with the malt forward aroma on the nose. Its a bit more hoppy than I tend to prefer but its not bad, I would definitely drink it if it was offered. Its hard to go wrong with Sierra Nevada."
""
""
"O - overall, a nice beer. I enjoy the winter seasonal IPAs and pale ales as a change of pace from the winter warmer seasonals (which I love), and this is a very enjoyable offering from Sierra Nevada. Very good, as always."
"Notes: tasty, invigorating, joyful. One doesn't think of an IPA as a Winter Seasonal but this one has the right balance between Hops and Malt and the senses are actually reminded of the smells of Christmas. Wow. This one is gonna be a keeper."
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall this was a pretty decent holiday beer. I did not think it was an amazing IPA though. The hops did not have a lot of depth or variety. I would also have preferred something with a little more bitterness for an IPA."

""
""
""
"Overall: A great IPA and one of the best seasonal beers out there. Great balance of hops and malts."
""
"Overall, something to look forward to every Winter. A true classic."
""
"Fantastic IPA but not as good as the hype makes it out to be. Again, I'd score it higher if it wasnt a winter seasonal as well. Definitely for hop heads though who love that flavor."
""
""
"what can I say about this beer that hasnt been said already? just cracked a new 2011 keg of celebration and I forgot how good this beer really is. Hops are spot on in this one. Not too overpowering but enough to enjoy the lovely hop flavor. 6.8% alcohol is slighty high for a session beer but I can see myself drinking many of them during the holiday months. I never really thought of an IPA as a winter beer but why the hell not? No doubt a go to beer during the cold winter months."
"O - Overall this one surprised me for being cheap and everywhere right now, I like this. Lots of hop head likes and tastes. I would drink this all year. This is comparable to some DIPA's as far as taste goes."
"I heard this was an IPA, but I didn't know it was a fresh hop ale until I first drank it. I felt a sense of pride in myself for identifying it as such when I saw it was written on the label. Unlike other fresh hop beers I've had, this one was aggressive and I wasn't expecting that from Sierra Nevada. I couldn't believe that this beer is so well liked that they release it year after year. Not because it's a bad beer, but because of the aggressive hop oil presence. These hops had a more piney flavor and aroma than most other heavily hopped beers on the West coast. And I say good for Sierra Nevada for doing something different. It's a welcome change to see a fresh hop beer as a brewery's winter seasonal. Keep it up SN!"
""
""
"Thanksgiving! Crystal-clear amber-copper in color with a big, fluffy, pillowy, off-white head. Fresh, fruity hops, toasted malt, and sweet sugary goodness. Taste is extremely balanced between bitter, oily hops and roasted, sweet malt. Goes down very easily and drinks like a charm. A bit of cloying aftertaste but that may be because it's my fourth beer of the day. Just an incredibly consistent and tasty brew that I will have no objection to when seeing it in 12-packs. It's popular and loved for a reason."
""
""
""
""
""
"While an American IPA isn't exactly my idea of a winter beer, this is a really great brew. Strong flavor, beautiful lacing... I wound't call it well-rounded, but somehow, it doesn't bother me all of that much. Recommended."
"Have also had this on draft, with similar disappointing results."
""
"Overall this a very good beer and another one that I look forward to every year. A great beer as a great way to celebrate - the changing of the seasons, friends and family, good health, the life a long time feline friend. To whatever you may celebrate, may your glass, as well your heart, always be filled with happiness. Cheers!"
""
""
"Far from the most interesting IPA I've had. In terms of flavor, 'character' and creativity, more like a pale ale that has been hopped up (an XPA perhaps). Much better in the bottle than on draught (which I had at Beer Revolution in Oakland, wasn't impressed). The character of the bitterness is palate destroying, so I wouldn't drink this one first. A 'solid' IPA, but not interesting enough to pick up as a seasonal, and not available enough to make it your standard IPA. To be fair, I'd say this about almost all of SN's beers."
"o-wow. this is a very complex offering by sierra nevada. easy to drink through the whole winter with the right amount of complexity and body to match any event."
""
"O: Good, a little smoother than the bottled version but much hoppier this year compared to 2010, which is fine by me."

""
""
"12/12/11 edit: revisited this after all the enthusiasm shown here on ba. Still seems to be a good, well done ipa , but at least IMHO, not a superstar ( while fully respected that many others hold in high regard)."
"O: This seasonal IPA is a cause for Celebration (now I'm a hack writer!) indeed. It's more hoppy than Torpedo, Sierra Nevada's year round IPA, but some claim that this IPA can even be AGED! So if you want a sweeter IPA, I'd experiment with that. But for me, it's all about the first hops of the growing season: the fresher the better!"
""
"I’m not going to lie; I have always loved this beer. Think of this one as a Torpedo with a little less ABV and more balance with higher drinkability. I do remember some of last year’s batch having a little more bitterness and not quite as much of the maltiness. Regardless, yet another great seasonal from SN."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a great seasonal IPA from one of the original American craft breweries. Super well balanced with a crisp and clean hop profile. Recommended to any fan of IPAs. Cheers!"
"O - This one remains one of my go to fall beers. The balance of sweetness to bitterness is spot on and it goes down easy. One of the rare IPA's that gets better with age."
"Served in a pint glass the brew pours an amber color that just looks like fall. A good head is formed when poured down the center of the glass. The nose is malty. The mouthfeel is light but satisfying. Good intergration of both hops and malt with a bit of bitterness on the finish. Certainly not a hops bomb but a very good ale and worthy of purchase."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A true holiday ale from California, nicely spiced but hop forward and pleasant. Not a hop monster, but a really well balanced ale that embodies the holidays, but stays true to the west coast style."
""
""
""
"o: Simply stated this is a great IPA and a great value. I look forward to this release each year and it has yet to disappoint me."
"This is a beer that I have looked forward to having again since last year, the first time I had it. This beer is great due to the taste obviously, but also the price point and it is available everywhere this time of year. Classic beer and one to enjoy this season as well as next."
""
""
""
"The flavor follows the nose quite closely. There is a bit of bitterness right up front with huge amounts of grapefruit and piney hop goodness. There is just the slightest bit of lingering bitterness in the finish. The malt profile is bready and sweet, just big enough to provide balance. Medium body and moderately carbonated, with a slightly dry finish. Very drinkable."

"A decent beer overall, but I thought it was going to be a lot better, especially after the smell. The nose was the best part."
"D - This year's celebration is great. Shame on anyone who questions the hoppiness this year. I remember being lukewarm on some previous iterations, but this one is a real winner. Get out there and grab a sixer."
""
"Head pours overtop the rim and stays there like it is gelatinous. The smell is pure aromatherapy, I can understand why old-timers used to place fresh-picked hops in their pillowcases. Pure hoppy smell with a hint of citrus notes. The taste is one of my favorite parts, the beer is one of my favorite beers, I look forward to it every year because that hop profile is so damn good! Cheers"

"Overall a superb beer. Even if it was hoppier last year."
"Overall - I tend to drink out of season, i love IPAs in the winter and i love RIS in summer. This is a great go-to winter IPA, the color is great and enticing and the hops are more bitter than juicy, something i enjoy around these times. Great beer!"

"One of my favorite IPAs, I buy a sixer every year, but this year my local wholeseller had cases. I'm glad I have 23 more to enjoy."

"Solid murky honey orange with a stacked fluff head of muttled off white. In the nose is a lot of pine & grapefruit character from those little green herbal cones we call hops. There is a solid dose of mint in there as well, which is faintly reminiscent of a mint pale ale I brewed a month or so back. Pale malts, piney hops, a touch of citric hops, and a bit of spice round this IPA off nicely. Bittering bite in the back, and pretty smooth body here. Overall, its a pretty solid IPA - but I was expecting a lot more from all the hype on the forums for this seasonal. For the price, $7.99, at Total Wine & More, its hard to beat!"
"O - A great beer that may have been a little overhyped. Did not hit me as strong as I was expecting from an IPA, but the hops were fresh and delicious with a great hit of malt flavor to balance it out."
""
"O: Nice, like drinking a fresh forest."

"I'm not as crazy about Celebration as others are, but it's still a solid brew for the winter season and I hope it remains a staple."

"Good earthy hop flavors take the focus in this highly available fresh hop beer. A good go to beer in this season when grocery shopping or in a pinch, but not something I would pick over some of the better wet hopped beers. But it's price and availability still make this a good choice."
"O- A little maltier than I like, but overall another good offering from sierra nevada"
"A very drinkable exciting beer!"
"O: A pretty good IPA and a solid value."
"Overall this has to be one of my favorite beers by SN. Very fresh tasting and drinkable. Highly recommend picking some up if you have yet to try it."
"This beer looks great. Nice red hues and a nice full head of foam. Good retention down the glass. Piney hop presence in the nose with a little citrus with a touch of grain. Good hop aroma, not too strong though. Taste is great, hops providing most of the flavor. Aggressive pine hops with some grapefruit character, with malt sweetness balance at the end. Hop character lingers afterwards. Well carbonated and has a good body. Creamy feel that is very drinkable. This beer is beyond drinkable, each sip makes me want more. I understand why people go through cases of this, it's a solid example of the style for a great price."
"O: This is another solid beer from Sierra Nevada. I like the fresh pine hops and bitterness. Good Beer."
"Sierra Nevada really got this one right, just as other brewers are adding oranges honey and cinnamon, SN goes simple and smooth to create a holiday classic, I really look forward to and enjoy this one"
"Pours a hazy burnt orange, 2 finger creamy head that sticks and slimes around the rim of the glass. Piny hop notes on the nose first, citrus hops follow up, brown sugar and caramel notes fill the back bone on this beer. Smells the way a west coast IPA should. Aspriny bitterness on the tongue first, the piny hop presence resinates around the mouth. Medium on the feel, not too intense but def bold, bitter and dry with a boozy red wine finish. Overall; Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is something to look forward too every winter, no crazy clove or cinnamon beer can beat this one on the shelves."
"O- While there are IPA's I like more, there aren't many. Certainly a brew I always look forward to around holiday time."
"O: a great IPA, love the hop flavors, especially that it is a fresh hop ale"
"Overall: What more to say? This is a great West-coast IPA. Its wonderful that this is so widely available because this is one damn fine brew."
"full bodied single ipa. one of the classics. thick with hop residue with a complex finish. it seems that every year, regardless of the popular wisdom devoted to the spices of thanksgiving and christmas in beer, this is one of the top ""holiday"" beers. it's a stunning example of American hops in the California style of brewing."
"O: Its confirmed, this is my favorite IPA, maybe my favorite all time beer. Great price, well balanced, a very aesthetically crafted. For a brewer as big as Sierra to put something out like this is really impressive. Time to listen to Christmas music and count down the days til next years release."
"Overall, it's Sierra Nevada...you're pretty much guaranteed a delicious beer. Very good and will definitely be buying again"
"This beer pours a dark amber color, and is a cloudier than many of the IPA's I drink. There's a think off-white head and good lacing that remains long after the beer is gone. The smell has the appropriate pine needle scent of hops, but it isn't overpowering. Taste wise, this beer really shines. Every sip is a crisp bite of hops. One of my favorite brews, and I look forward to picking up a few cases every winter."
"year to sell. I would be interested to hear from someone else who has done this and hear their opinion."
"The malt character is nice, but getting more of that floral hop in the flavor, for instance, would only help this IPA's score."
"overall - I'd describe it as a hoppy amber ale."
"Pours a burnt amber color w/ a one finger cocoa head. Somewhat cloudy in appearance. Good lacing on the side of my glass. The nose is mainly pine, hops, grapefruit and malt. It's nice, and farily balanced. Taste is the same profile. It could use a little more hops in my opinion, just a little weak on that aspect. A little more hops and the taste would definitely get bumped up. Feel is crisp, medium bodied, and hoppy/carbonated- probably the best aspect of this beer. Overall, a very solid brew! Cheers."
"Overall (4.5): This is the archetypal fresh hop IPA, in my mind. All beers of this style aim to be something akin to this: even if they’re aiming to be more or less than what this beer is, they’re aiming for something in the region defined by this beer. Absolutely wonderful."
"Overall: The taste was very unexpected and unique for the IPA's I usually drink, which tend to be hop bombs. The malty-balance is not very apparent by the nose, but a pleasant surprise. This is an IPA that the more casual drinker can enjoy."
"Overall, this is a decent fresh hop beer, but doesn't compare to the Deschutes Hop Trip I had last night."
"4.5, 4.5, 3, 3, 3.5"
"Overall: An excellent wet hopped IPA. I may need to go back and buy another 6 pack of this stuff."
"Drinkability- I thought it was very good. Obviously I'm drinking it again because I love it."
"O- This is a fine beer. This is the first time I've had this one and I enjoyed it. It gets good reviews and can understand why. Not a change your life type of beer, but better than most."
"O: What a beer; this truly is the best harvest beer I’ve had. Complexity, bitterness, and a great range of textures make this beer feel truly alive. One of the best IPAs I’ve had in a long time."
"O: This is my favorite seasonal from Sierra Nevada. I just dont get why this beer is so good. It is like a better version of Torpedo. I want as much of this beer as I can possibly get."
"This is worth the once a year release. One of the best fresh hop ale's I've ever had. It is a bargain and widely available during the fall and winter. I need to pick up a few more six packs of this."
"O) Absolutely one of my favorite seasonals. There's a reason I'm stashing a case in my garage."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Definitely in my top five, and I'll be sorry when it's gone for the year!"
"2012 bottling. Still a wonderful seasonal. What strikes me the most is still the balance and drinkability. It has a wonderful, hoppy flavor without being extremely bitter. Beers like this make me proud of the term ``American IPA''."
"O: I liked Celebration a great deal; the beer definitely lived up to the hype. I grabbed a six pack at the store today and I probably will head back tomorrow to pick up another...two or three."
"A beer I look forward to every late Fall/winter. It's always better than I remember it being, a tough feat for any beer."
"Celebration, this years is tasty. Translucent and deep amber in color with belgian (well not in this case) lacing cascading around my tulip. Fair head retention. The aroma, well it is pine atop citrus with caramel cent underneath. Fairly tasty, nice hop presence, pine, resin, citrus married to a more malty frame then I usually look for. Crystal malt adds a bit of sweetness to combat the bittering hops. Its is a well balanced beer with a bitter finish, clean, and well bodied. I'd buy this beer again, it is a nice tasting ipa that you don't have to over think. It is not overly complex, it is just an ipa that you drink and don't think too much about."
"I liked this beer but found it maybe a little bit one-note for my tastes. I love the hoppiness, appearance, and finish but wish there were a little bit more vivid flavors besides the overall bitterness."
"Overall, a very good wet-hopped pale ale. Excellent balance of malt flavor and hop bitterness. Easy to drink and a good mix of different hop flavors."
"O - Considering the price/quality ratio, this beer is off the charts (got a 12pk fresh for $11). Quality brew, highly recommended for hop-heads."
"This is the first time I have tried this beer, 2011. I bought a 6 pack then went back for a 12 pack a few days later. A truly excellent beer. This beer has a large tan head that stick around until you finish. It treats your taste buds to a piney citrus flavor and a medium mouth feel and goes down extremely easy for tan IPA. This beer is available, affordable, drinkable and delicious. Get them while they're fresh!"
"O: Highly anticipated, this ale does deliver. Seems less ""fresh"" and ""green"" than other wet hop ales I've tried, though I believe SN defines ""fresh"" differently than some other brewers. Hops are well integrated. Very solid overall. Super value @ $7.00-7.99/6."
"Liked the look and the smell, but not impressed by the taste. I prefer more balanced IPAs, or ones that showcase more of the positive hop flavors. This one is a bitter-bomb, with little supporting or accenting it. Becomes less so as it warms up - more balanced, with less sharpness and the malts coming through more. Okay, but not my favorite."
"O: This is unbeatable for the availability and price. I'd pick this up."
"O: Amazing. This years batch is just as good, if not better, than last years. I look forward to it every year, and this year does not disappoint. This beer is dangerously drinkable. Just fantastic stuff."
"This one is a bit aggressive and the dryness and the bite to it will turn people away who don't enjoy that. I however am not one of those people! If you don't like the aggressive bite a month or two will leave a still wonderful beer with more malt standing out. I can vouch that this isn't a bad IPA after a bit of age hits it. I'd still drink early!"
"Pours a golden amber color with a two finger head that sticks around to leave impressive lacing. Aroma of citrus and piney hops, with malts as an afterthought. Taste follows the nose, the hops really shine in this beer, fresh and crisp. This is a smooth and refreshing beer. Screw seasonal, make this all year!"
"This is a great beer; not the hop bomb that would earn an A+, but definitely worth looking forward to and drinking every year."
"I love it! Every year I pick up a case. I wish this beer was year round. What a solid, balanced IPA that really does warm you up on cold days."
"Clear amber color beneath a huge billowy head. Traces of the head last through the entire glass, and leave lots of lacing. Gorgeous. The aroma of grapefruit and pear with a bit of freshly baked bread makes some pleasing sniffs. The taste is wonderfully balanced. Caramel and biscuit from the malts provide a solid backbone while piney hops build to a crescendo through the finish. Yet another solid offering from Sierra Nevada. They've never let me down yet."
"Overall: An outstanding pale ale! My only knock would be that it lacked dry hopping to truly celebrate the ""hop""!"
"O: Interesting flavor profile, intense and subtle at the same time, kind of hard to imagine without experiencing it. It is good and I will buy it again."
"12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams glass. Two finger head which faded a little faster than what I remember from previous releases. Nice clean aroma (reminds me a little of Pinesol (in a good way that is)) with a bit of apricot. Peppery, piney hops with malty bread underneath. Mouthfeel has a nice carbonated bitter hop bite, resinous oils hang on the tongue. Overall I'm pleased with this year's release, although it seems a little more peppery and less citrusy."
"O - Even though SN is a big company they still make great beers. I love IPAs and this is a very good one and one of the reasons why I believe American craft beers are the best in the world."
"twaddleac was right, this is one damn fine IPA, and something to look forward to every year."
"MF- Medium bodied beer that has flavors that last quite a while on the palate."
"Aaaahhh its that time of the year, everytime the celebration ale comes out i know the winter warmers are on the way. But lets focus on the celbration. This years batch is better than last years imo, the smell is better all aroun. The lace in the glass is sticky stick icky lace, and that makes me happy. I wish i could get this year round, it is not one to miss."
"O: Overall, this beer is slightly plain, but very refreshing and drinkable. I don't find it very exciting, but it's definitely decent. It has a similar vibe to torpedo in it being slightly boozy and harsh. Spicy hops linger in the mouth. Unique."
"O: very good beer, and at $9 for a 6-pack I'll be sure to grab it again some time. Just have to be careful that it's not too old. I hate that they release it so early. Delicious, drinkable, and readily available."
"Wonderful hop aroma. Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Nice inch of foam that seems to last forever. Half way through there's still a 1/4 inch left. Dark cloudy yellow color. Did I mention the smell? First taste is crazy. Fruit, tart, apple, watermelon and apple. I'm also getting some apple scent now. Mild bitter finish. Good carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Overall wonderful beer. Something to look forward to during the holidays."
"Sierra Nevada, despite how big it might be getting, continues to deliver some of the best beer available. Skol!"
"Definitely not your typical winter seasonal. This is however, a big, piney hop bomb of an IPA that would taste good sitting by the fire and a Christmas tree."
"This a solid IPA that I'll revisit year after year until I croak. I always look forward to this release and this year did not dissapoint."
"This is quite simply a timeless winter classic."
"O- Outstanding beer. Complex without trying to stand out from the crowd."
"O: I had to really fight drinking the whole thing before I finished my glass. I'm already reaching for another."
"There's a reason this beer is looked forward every year by hop heads. Sure, there are hoppier beers on the market at any given time throughout the year, but few are done with such a deft hand, and I don't know of any that can beat the price."
"Overall. Really nice ipa here. As an IPA lover I look forward to it's release ...and it never lets me down."
"Like it? Of course. This is a fantastic beer."
"O - A very nice beer. Has a nice piney hop profile throughout."
"A little disappointed given how many people love this beer and claim they get grapefruit hops and spice, etc."
"O - A delicious beer that can always be counted on. A classic."
"Overall, I'll drink this again whenever i'm in the mood."
"O: Even a year old, Celebration remains one of my all-time favorite IPA's."
"EDIT: I had a fresh bottle and the hoppy flavour and bitterness were much stronger. Still, far from my favourite IPA. Bitter grass flavour."
"O: All in all, this is a good beer that I feel like could be duplicated as a homebrew. It almost has a homebrew-type taste to it. Definitely try if you like a well balanced beer. If you're looking for this to be an IPA, you may be disappointed."
"Great fresh, great nine months old, great after a year. If you haven't had one... Pbbbttt."
"Overall: Wow. Definitely worth the $2.00 price tag! Sierra Nevada has impressed me again."
"Overall, this is good beer, though its relation to the Holiday season should be noted as going little beyond the festive label: there are no Christmas spices in here, no fancy gingerbread or shortbread ingredients. Instead, there's just malts and hops, hops, hops. IPA lovers should take note of this one."
"This is one of the few beers that I would give an A+ to, one of my all time favorites"
"Overall-I've never been the type to drink a 2.5 year old IPA, but this was really good. Can't wait to drink fresh ones soon."
"O - Awesome brew, super glad I chose to sit on a few until the summer months. Highly recommended to buy some in the winter for summer drinking. Nice work SN, you've impressed."
"On this balmy summer night of 6-22-11 I'm giving this 2010 bottle a go and thinking how much I wish the current weather were just a tad closer to that wintery wonderland depicted on the bottle label...Into a pint glass this appears a clear copper amber color under a well sustained head. Aroma is that of toasted sweet bread, deep floral hops and perhaps a touch of cinnamon. Mouthfeel is a very hop forward one with no shame in slamming the palate with earthy pine and herbal hops riding very nicely on a robust malt base. The finish leaves a favorably bitter imprint on the palate and is quite refreshing (much enjoyed on this humid day) despite its very wintery warming character. Cheers to an American IPA with balls..."
"Poured into a pint glass, a clear amber, with reddish highlights around the edges, and a finger of merry white head. Floral and citrus notes in the aroma, hoppy, with a malty sweetness in the background. Much like the previous batch, a good balance of sweet malts and bitter but smooth hops, floral and slightly herbal, with a tad of spice. Medium mouthfeel and sessionably drinkable."
"This beer pours an amber color with a large pillowy white head that coats the sides of the glass and lasts for a long time. The smell is floral and citrusy. the flavor is very hop forward with citrus and some pine, and a light malt backbone to back it up. the bitterness while there, is not as present as i would like. the mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. and overall i give this one an A"
"4.5-4-4.5-4-5=A"
"(Update): This really becomes more charming every year. It's leafy, raw, and a little harsh, yet somehow I find it as heartwarming as a Christmas tree."
"I love fresh celebration! But i have just discovered that aged celebration is very good as well."
"12oz into a 22oz snifter. 50*F. Awesome looking, 3/4"" tight bubbled offwhite head. Rich orange-red body, brilliant clarity. The head lingers going no where, nice gooey lace. Smells nice and hoppy. Very piney sweet smelling. The aroma is a bit shallow beyond the the sweet malt and piney hops, not bad, just simple. The flavor is quite bitter, coats the mouth with the bitterness. Very grapefruity, bitter pith, but also sweet ruby-red grapefruit flesh. This beer is definitely all about the hops. A faint toastiness develops in the long finish. The mouthfeel is fine, a bit coating, the bitterness definitely lingers as a physical sensation, not quite astringent, the carbonation is on point. This beer goes down really easy, I'm sure I could drink several of these in a session. It's not super interesting to me though, no flaws or anything, just not all that memorable."
"O: Like I said it my taste description, make sure this is not too cold, and it's enjoyable."
"O - Extremely nice overall, suits hopheads well, though 6.8% is perhaps pushing it a little for a session drink."
"It is ever so spritzy yet strong and firm. The long strong bitterness is pretty dry with bags of finesse and leaves a fine coat of lingerng bitterness in the mouth. Just superb how that bitterness just arrives as it hits the back of the throat. Super sticky head is left all over the empty glass. Not at all aggressive but neither could you ever call effeminate. Just love the way that Sierra Nevada's beers all display some house character but are also all so unique. But good God is this beer beautiful."
"D: Considering ABV and body, surprisingly smooth and easy to drink."
"I had picked up 2 bottles of this around the holidays this passed year and was pretty excited to have this again. This beer pours out as a really nice looking Christmasy red color with a tan head on top that settles pretty quickly. The aroma is mostly hops which I like, it makes me want to dive right into this beer. The other aromas are subtle enough that they are almost nonexistent in this one. There is a little bit of spiciness coming through in the nose as well. The taste is just hoppy, I guess there are some malt flavors in the far background of this beer but mostly all hops here. The mouthfeel is medium I'd say. It's a really nice brew though and worth checking out."
"poured my 2010 celebration into a pint glass. had a nice fluffy four finger head. lacing all the way around till the end. has a nice dark copper color to it. smells exceptional, nice floral hops. speaking of hops, the taste is the same start to finish, nice full bodied hoppy beer. cant wait for my next one!"
"D- you have to be an IPA lover to appreciate this- very repeatable for us hop heads; a bit on the heavy side to have more than a few."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a Samuel Adams PP glass. Beer pours clear with lively carbonation. Color is a light amber, with a nice frothy head. Aroma is almost spicy, with grapefruit and citrus character. Pleasant bitterness hits you up front, with citrus and grapefruit hitting you towards the end of the experience. Mouthfeel is full but not sweet, and the malt profile works in harmony with the hops. My only complaint about Celebration is that I can't get it year round."
"Great moderately high carbonation works well."
"O: Very well done. Very good beer."
"O: I didn't think I was a hop head, but after trying this on tap and Hopslam in the bottle this evening, maybe I am? This is an example of top notch execution of a hoppy ale with balance. Very enjoyable, I'll be trying this when it's fresher next winter."
"This was the perfect compliment to a Farmer John premium frank with Gulden's mustard."
"I clearly am not a fan of IPAs since the taste immediately threw me off and it went down hill from there...Amazing color and smell but the bitter taste of the hops, pine, and other spices were just not balanced right for me...I'll stick with the pale ale..."
"Will be buying again next year, for sure."
"To the eyes is a dense copper like color, with a very thick head that leaves generous lacing and lingers. Smells kind of mint at times and hoppy, the taste is a fight of malt and hops with a gentle bitterness in the aftertaste. It feels medium body like that makes it an easy drink. Very good overall."
"Pours a beautiful translucent reddish color with a good finger of ecru foam on top. Big hoppy aromas (grapefruit and pine) get the mouth watering. Medium bodied, with nicely integrated hops and a sturdy malt background. Excellent."
"Light to medium bodied and very well carbonated with ample soft bubbles easing the flavors onto your tongue. Fairly dry finish with only a hint of alcohol in the back of the throat. Always nice that Celebration is so well made every year."
"Verdict: World class ale, perfect for anytime of year really and well-balanced enough for almost anyone. Get some folks."
"Pours a clear copper with a half inch off-white head that dissipates into a fine blanket. Hops blew me away the first time, but after several now I kind of like the big citrus aroma and now find the sweet malt behind it. Taste is grapefruit followed by grapefruit. Fine selection for a big thirst. Goes down easy with a nice bitter/sweetish linger."
"D-very drinkable. My taste was gone in no time. Would love to see what this is like fresh"
"Pours a crisp reddish amber. a good amount of white foamy head. Smells VERY hoppy still. I can't even tell that its aged. Tastes very malty and rich. A lot of great hops still on the tongue. Piney and grapfriuit heavy. Lots of floral aromas and tastes. Solid thick mouthfeel and very drinkable. I'm amazed its held up so well. Very nice brew"
"D - if you are having food or other beer have it last the pine flavor lingers"
"D: Damn plain, but easy drinking."
"d - A very nice, easy drinking IPA. Lots of citrus hops mixing with caramel malts in the smell and taste, and not a ton of bitterness in the taste. Would certainly have again and love how cheap it is compared to some other IPAs."
"The cpj"
"d- this is a very hoppy beer and it may be a bit much for some people to be able to drink more than a couple, most ""hopheads"" I wouldnt doubt crush a 6er easy. I feel its very drinkable like most Sierra products but I also have a slight biased opinion because I love a hoppy beer."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer but probably wouldn't buy another. It's my understanding that this beer changes somewhat from year to year, and I liked it enough that I will revisit it next year, for sure."
"What else could you ask for Christmas ? (and don't say a pony - it's NEVER happening!!!)"
"Bottle 2008 vintage, consumed 1 year later. Thanks ritzkiss. Beautiful color here, nice hazy red pour. Quite the hop bomb for 1 year old IPA, taste is nicely balanced IPA complex mix of hops and leafs. Surprisingly good for the age and wish I could try a fresh one in the future."
"Good display of fresh hops. Good for the occasional ""celebration"". I will definitely have more next year."
"Wish this was year round instead of torpedo :("
"D- I like it, I don't love it. I wish there was a bit more hop flavor to match the bittering qualities. I could be drinking this a bit too late, in which it is my fault; but as is I have reviewed honestly. I don't think I would go back for a second one considering almost 7% alcohol I would move to something else before I got too buzzed."
"O: I've had a lot of these this winter, and a I look forward to having a lot more next year too. One of the better values around Christmas time. It's easy to drink, well balanced and just damn tasty. SN's Celebration is a great way to escape from the in-laws, even if it's just for a few sips."
"Last time I had this, I was not impressed, though it was in late April (2009) and from a bottle. To me, there is a difference when it's fresh and on tap, and based on my experience, fresh and on tap is my preference."
"This is definitely one my go to beers, you can't go wrong with this one."
"M&D- This is a full brew for sure. Feels alot heaver that it actually is. A great IPA in my opinion though."
"Pours a beautiful orange with a solid head. The nose is all hops: citrus, pine, resin. Much like the nose, the taste is one of absolute hop domination. This beer is everything that I love about IPAs, incorporating all the wonderful citrus flavors and an unremitting bitterness. One of my absolute favorite beers; it makes the cold weather bearable!"
"Might be tough to drink to many unless you really like the hops."
"Aromas of fresh hoppy, herbal geranium, floral perfume, some citrus rind (orange) and a biscuit-like cracker. The aroma fades incredibly fast and vigorous swirling is required to refresh it. For the most part the flavors match the described aromas, but the bitterness comes off as somewhat rough and there is a bit of an astringent, grassy quality about the beer. It seems less rich and a bit thin and astringent compared to past years."
"This was my first time having this Sierra nevada beer-would recommend it."
"D - It's an IPA, a strong style of beer, so of course it's not going to be the most drinkable beer in the world. This one is pretty damn drinkable though. Doesn't fill you up too much and has a relatively average-to-low ABV% for the style. I can see putting a few of these down in one night. And the bitterness doesn't seem to get old, since it fades away at just the right time."
"D: I can put back 6 of these in a few hours, which scares me considering the alcohol content. They're just so damn delicious that it's hard to stop... My favorite seasonal beer, can't wait for next winter to come around."
"Summary: My favorite seasonal beer by far. This beer is readily available in my area and also a reasonably priced 12-pack. So happy that I have been able to have this in the fridge all winter. Just another fantastic beer from the masters at SN."
"It has the expected bitter and creaminess that you expect from a pale ale, but for whatever reason is more pronounced in this beer than others I've tried. For my taste, I wouldn't classify as IPA, it lacks the agressive bitterness and finish, but is nonethless a solid pale ale."
"Drinkability: Excellent session beer. They know their IPAs."
"Had two before I knew it and could easily go for another."
"I'm really hoping this was just a bad batch since I respect Sierra Nevada's other brews, but every bottle in the six-pack I got was disappointing."
"D - Easy to drink. Fun to drink. A good IPA that is probably a lot better the fresher you get it, as usual. I prefer Torpedo, but it is close."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a dimpled mug. Pours a very clear red amber with a small white head leaving a good amount of lacing on the glass. Aroma is caramel malt, strong of spicy hops, light pine and citrus hops. Initial taste is malty caramel, followed by spicy and citrus hops. Finish is bready with a light bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Pretty hoppy for a winter style IMO."
"d - deceptively drinkable @ 6.8% while only seeming to 5% I will say that as it ages the chinook herb notes are more present compared to the cascade + centennial citrus notes turning it into a completely different beer. fresh however it is dangerously balanced."
"Loved this when it first hit the shelves this season. Now at the end of January, though not the same, it's still pretty darn good."
"D: Very drinkable and like I said always a treat to taste SN at thier best!"
"Time to sit back and enjoy another one now."
"D - Again.. I wanna say this beer is unbalanced because the bitterness just seems a little too much, but there's something about it that makes me want to go back for more after every sip I take."
"Nice combination of a malty pale ale and the fresh, whole cone hops. Sticky but balanced by sweetness."
"Overall: I like this better than Torpedo, but now I'm anxious to try these back to back. No doubt in my mind why Celebration gets the praise it does - and deserves!"
"D: Bitter, balanced, and clean finishing. Enjoyable alone and I'd wager pairs well with food. Selling 24 oz. bottles was a good move by Sierra Nevada."
"Overall a pretty good and drinkable beer."
"I love the heavy hops. The head is beautiful and it sticks around. Even the after beer burps aren't that bad."
" The taste is rather bitter at the start. The tip of the tongue is greeted with an unbalanced explosion of citric hop flavor. Orange, grapefruit with soapy floral delights. The finish while still bitter does come with a taste of caramel and toffee. The toasted grains are dry and non cloying. The carbonation may seem a bit high, but perfect to keep aftertastes from lingering. The aftertaste last only long enough to remind you to have another quaff.... Its cold out man, pour the last one!"
"D: Clean and lingering taste. Good, but not overwhelming."
"D. This is a great beer that I always look forward to every year. I can have more than one at a sitting."
"Another classic from Sierra Nevada."
"Overall: A classic. Very much like a lighter version of an American Barleywine."
"Conclusion: This is a very good IPA. That is spoken by someone who rarely seeks out examples of this much over-hyped style. I feel that this style of beer as a place, but that the addition of large amounts of hops to beer is a trend that often masks and detracts from styles that were never meant to be hop-driven in aroma or flavor. I digress. This is an American IPA, and thus it should be all about the big hop profile, which it is. I really enjoy this beer, and think that it still has elements of balance and craftsmanship, which I admire greatly. Sierra Nevada has long been one of the best users of hops in their beer, and this example deserves its reputation."
"I enjoyed this SN offering and will continue to look for it in winters to come."
"Bottle, thanks Ed! Clear chestnut with a fluffy head. Nose is fairly bright and pleasant with cirtus and hops, but kind of flat and one dimensional. Mouth is nice citrus, grapefruit, hop oils. Very quaffable and decent, but not much complexity or any sense of balance they're going for. Nice enough, would make a good 6-er when fresh."
"notes - in comparison to SN torpedo, this is heavier and maltier but less hops."
"D--Super good. I'm definitely looking forward to next years batch."
"Tried this when it was given to me by a beer club member. Never paid much attention to Sierra Nevada before, now aI am a fan. Have gone out of my way to find celebration and other SN beers."
"Very drinkable. Smooth and pleasing."
"Take this with a grain of salt, because like I said, not a bitter IPA fan normally."
"Love it! Its the choice of everyday after work drink. The fact that they have a winter that is even hopper (celebration) is even better! Look forward to it every November! The Hop they use are exceptionally smooth with an aftertaste that will cause you to ask for more! They hold the bar in ipa!"
"D- An easy drinker that would be great all year round."
"Very drinkable - wish there was a bit more citrus to balance out the bitter."
"D- Deceptively drinkable. The perfect beer for a cold winter's night."
"Note: 2010 vintage"
"Overall a nice beer; would definitely have it again!"
"Drinkability: Awesome IPA, with a nice hop bite! The beer is also very fresh tasting, which is typical with all Sierra Nevada beers. Sierra Nevada does not know how to brew a bad beer, top-notch brew!"
"D: Crisp, flavorful, and very very drinkable. Overall a very refreshing and well balanced beer. Definitely worth picking up a 12 pack or more for a great go-to beer. I couldn't see the taste getting old."
"Celebration Ale is one of those beers that just grows on you over time. The flavor seems to vary from batch to batch, but you can taste the similarities. The pros are its not super heavy and the hop flavor is quite fresh. Though, sometimes the hop flavor verges on IPA and you would expect a little more ""spice"" since its a seasonal. Overall, its an excellent beer that would be good anytime of year, not just winter."
"D - A fantastic winter beer for anyone with even a slight preference for hoppy flavor; I could drink this forever. Another great brew from Sierra Nevada."
"D - Drinkability is quite high. Exactly what you would expect from this brewery."
"D-Exceptional, too bad this is a seasonal, because I think I would make it my year-round brew, maybe a run on those ridiculously low priced 12 packs is in the near future..."
"When I saw Fresh Hop Ale...from Sierra Nevada...I got excited!!!! You can smell pine and citrus at the pop of the top. The hop in this beer is probably what most people would like to taste in the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Color is fine and a good head after the poor. Cant go wrong with this one...enjoy!"
"Chad"
"Solid seasonal offering from Sierra Nevada. Pours an amber orange, very attractive color with a frothy tan head that sticks around for a minute. Aromas are piney and earthy, no citrus notes, very dark hop profile. Malt backbone is solid, bready malt that matches the earthy, crisp conclusion to the taste. Nicely balanced, expected a little more in your face hops for a ""fresh hop ale"" dont recall seeing that on the bottle previously."
"Notes: For an American i.p.a this one is quite a hop bomb and a dam tasty one as well. Cheers."
"I could drink this beer all night long. In fact, I have. I thought I would be rating this beer higher than I am because I enjoy this so much. The low aroma surprised me and I hadnt noticed how mild it was until I rated this beer. An excellent, aptly named beer. Every time a case enters the house, my wife and I turn every night into a celebration, until its gone."
"My go to beer from November through January, or when I just can't find it any more. The best bang for your buck for a quality beer at a great price."
"O: Just an outstanding beer. Kudos to Sierra Nevada for producing my favorite American IPA. I look forward to this time of year every year. Can we BAs lobby for Celebration year round? I enjoy it fresh or aged. To borrow a phrase I have used a lot lately, I would bathe in it if it were feasible. Just outstanding."
"D - good all winter sipper..."
"Theirs nothing overwhelmingly awesome about this beer but its a great beer. Im not sure if its the hype surrounding the beer or if all its aspects just make it come together really well. Regardless I have drank about 30 of these since its 2010 release and will continue to buy and consume as long as its supplied."
"This is an excellent beer with luscious, fresh, floral hop flavor that's sometimes hard to find in bottles. For the price, you could hardly do better. A few notable New England breweries match and exceed this in terms of fresh hop taste, but for a beer being sent all the way from California, the freshness is unparalleled and nearly rivals local beer. Very well done."
"Overall, I'm a little disappointed. I'd definitely select their Pale Ale before this."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass after letting it sit out of the fridge for about 10 minutes. Presented a beautiful reddish-orange color with a finger and half frothy head. The nose was very citrusy but also I got a hint of spice, which made the anticipation of the taste heightened as a result. The taste was very consistent to the nose with decent carbonation. This is one fine IPA if I might add. Celebration good times! If you can get your hands on this by all means do so, especially for IPA fans. This stays in my fridge, well atleast while it lasts."
"Overall, this tastes to me like an amped-up SNPA, which is ok, but lacks balance."
"My friend compared this to a less malty Arrogant Bastard. I can agree with that."
"After one year, it is clear that this beer is best when celebrated closer it's birth rather than it's anniversary. As such, I recommend you drink up your 2010 Celebration Ale now!"
"D: These is a a beer that shows a lot of restraint. Rather than taking a winter seasonal to excess, SN holds off a bit and gives something hearty and warming."
"Light mouthfeel contributes to a refreshing and enjoyable drinkability. Ready for another."
"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 11/23/10. Pours a light amber orange with two fingers of foam. Great lacing and nice carbonation. Light, fresh hops are not overwhelming. They are balanced with the malt so that you still get a good amount of sweetness. Apricot and peach. Great mouthfeel. Medium bodied and resiny. Sweet but not syrupy. Bitter but not dry. Carbonation seems a bit low. Very easy to drink and enjoy. Lighter fruit flavors and malty sweetness quickly give way to a hoppy finish, leaving you with a nice pine taste. Every year I forget how much I enjoy this beer. I am so glad someone puts out a great IPA as their winter seasonal."
"D: Pretty drinkable. I would have few. I could drink more of these in order than say Torpedo."
"D - The somewhat high carbonation and heavy bitter finish makes me want to eat, or drink something else to give my mouth a break."
"Although I do have some minor criticisms, this beer is excellent overall and does well to relax the body and spirit. I would say that the beer is seasonally accurate, reasonably priced, and a sure pleaser for beer drinkers of all kind. You'll have no troubles finishing this...Cheers."
"Celebration is highly drinkable considering all it's positive attributes. It's a mild IPA, one that won't have you belching a pine or spruce forrest all night long. Very good. This is why we run to the store upon its arrival so we don't miss out."
"D- I would choose their brew over the majority of other brews out there."
"I poured this beer in to a glass, it has a nice reddish body with a little bit of white frosty head. The smell is very hoppy. Its taste is very hoppy and with nice bitterness on the back of the tongue and some sweet malt. Great mouth feel and is nicely carbonated. I think this is very drinkable."
"Overall - Simply delicious. I love the hoppyness of the beer. Flavors are great, as it's able to give that spiciness without the spice. A wonderful winter seasonal."
"d- fine beer we have here, hit the spot when i needed a holiday beer but still wanted my hops fix"
"Sierra Nevada knows the hop game. very sessionable."
"This is a tremendous winter IPA. Very sessionable and very tasty - great stuff."
"Poured from a bottle into a beer mug. The beer is a cloudy, bright copper-brown with a decent, thick, foamy 2 inch head. Smells are heavy in malt, citrus and spice. The smells are pretty robust and full. The beer has a heavy hops undertone, with top flavors of citrus and spice. The spices taste like coriander and nutmeg, and they do a good job of not overpowering with the spice. The beer has a smooth and round feel in mouth, with a sweet, crisp finish. The beer has a slightly bitter hops aftertaste, with some of the spices present there, as well. Very decent holiday beer, and very easy to drink."
"This is a great beer that ages better than 99% of IPAs."
"Served in a 16oz pint at London Grill, Philadelphia with some hot wings."
"Makes the grey skies of winter a bit more cheery. Not a budget killer. Each bottle seems to feel like a damn good idea. Not sure why this seems more than it is...must be those mythical spices. Jingle all the way."
"D - Smooth, clean finish, have had better IPAs"
"could drink this all night long. i would recommend this beer to all my friends"
"Overall: a very tasty seasonal offering from Sierra Nevada that I look forward to every year."
"D: Another great one from Sierra Nevada, this is quite drinkable. As far as Christmas Beers goes, it's not a *typical one* because it's base style is an IPA. But I love IPA, and I would drink this year-round if they brewed it year-round. It's excellent."
"D: All night drinker no problem."
"Overall this is really a awesome beer. It does what it says it does and tastes great. You could order multiple pints of these in the pub or take down a six pack. Great job by the Sierra Nevada guys."
"D. A gret brew, lots of hops, great bitterness.i am glad I got a six pack I will probably have a few tonight."
"D: Such an enjoyable beer - very well rounded... looks good in the glass, has a great aroma and taste with an impressive mouthfeel. The parching effect on the palate, in the Drinkability department, is the only drawback."
"Pours a deep brown orange color with a thick white head and a little lacing. Smells of oranges and piney hops and more hops and more hops. Tastes mostly of hops and a little wood in there somewhere and some caramel malts or something. Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Drinkability is low."
"Served from tap into a shaker. Poured yellow-orange with a one finger off-white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bitter hops, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt and pin/citrus hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is a damn fine brew. Has a great aroma and flavor going on in this one. I actually enjoyed it from the bottle a little more, but not a huge difference. This is must try for any hop-head out there... Scratch that, if you haven't had this one, get off your ass and do so."
"The medium body and hop notes make this beer easily drinkable, as does its 6.8% ABV. Sierra Nevada has created a very balanced IPA, and the holiday release nicely competes with the more spice-laden holiday beers typically seen at this time."
"D - This is very drinkable as nothing is over powering and the alcohol content make this one the best sessionable beers made."
"Another solid ale produced from SN. I would say this is medium in the scale of drinkable. Not the most drinkable, but not the least."
"D -Smooth IPA with the fresh hops, this is a good introduction to American IPAs but would be even better with a little less caramel malt and a little more carbonation."
"Pours a nice hazy amber orange color with a three finger frothy slighly off white head. The head gives way to nice lacing. The aroma is of citrusy hops and floral hops with a hint of caramel malt. The taste has a caramel malt backbone along with a nice piney hop bite up front. There is also a citrus hop presence and the presence of spices to round out the flavor. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. The drinkability is good, it is a smoother drink than most ipa's. There is not the big hop bite that some ipa's have, but a nice well balanced flavor. The bite is enough to keep you interested and wanting more."
"d. really good beer. better than most seasonal spiced ales that become so popular this time of year. another exceptional beer by the consistently enjoyable sierra nevada team. Cheers!"
"Cheers!"
"D. Very drinkable. This is my session IPA every holiday. Super easy to put down quite a few of these. Not a mind blowing showcase for hops, but a well balanced good IPA."
"I would say I like 2010 a little better than the 2005, personally, but it's very close overall. It's a much different beer after over 5 years. Celebration is a rare example of an IPA that can be aged for years and still be very drinkable, however. Perhaps this one has aged just a little too long. 3 years would be about perfect I would think."
"D_Great session IPA"
"I've had my share of SN Celebration this season. It is worth noting that there is a huge difference in both the nose and taste at 3 weeks compared to 8 weeks. The 8 week old beer, reviewed here, is solid and worthy of praise. The 3 week old celebration is phenomenal, on par with some of the best IPAs on the market today. Drink it as fresh as possible, but when it comes down to it, just drink it."
"Having been turned on to wet and fresh-hopped offerings this fall, I expected this to be more like them, yet was not disappointed in the least by the more subtle approach."
"I must be in the minority when it comes to IPA's not usually a style I enjoy beyond one or two in a sitting. BUT, this is probably my favorite especially in the winter months. Great body, warm mouth feel w/o being thick. SN brews are usually hop tinged in overall taste and this kicks like a mule w/good fresh hop cone. Out of all their brews Celebration Ale and even Bigfoot seem to bring me back in the winter months"
"Solid beer, I have a lot left, I look forward to drinking more of it."
"D: Definitely a session beer for an IPA lover. Kicks a hop punch but pretty balanced with a strong malt backbone makes for a very drinkable IPA. A memorable finish."
"drink it."
"Drinkability is good. I would have another. A very high quality IPA."
"Drinks very easy for a beer this hoppy with the body it has on it. Gives me the feeling that on some nights 2-3 could be the limit and on others a decent amount more."
"Overall a nice IPA, better than most, could be very special if the nose was a bit more pronounced."
"Nice job SN"
"D- Wow. I wish this were year round. I love IPAs and this exceeded my expectations. Must stockpile for the long winter."
"This is what I want for the christmas season, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! Merry Christmas Y'all!!"
"Overall - I respect this beer and can tell its very well made. I understand why IPA lovers give this high ratings."
"Poured into my 12 oz tulip glass. Bottle says it is around 50 days old. Pours a redish orange, a little haze with two inches of white head. Solid lacing that doesn't disappear until the end. The hoppy smell like grapefruit and pine got blended together. The taste even more powerful then the smell, with a sharp dry finish. Drinkability very nice, but this is all about the hopps, malt is barely noticable in the taste. A wonderful IPA, that will be my go too beer in November, December, and January for many years."
"Drinkability - is it over already? Really, i can see why Spinrsx had trouble giving this one up in a trade! What a fantastic beer for a great day (just signed on for a new job)! Thanks Spinrsx for the trade and donation from your trip. This is a great beer everyone should try and stock."
"3.5 D: I haven't had this beer before, but it doesn't seem to be that great unless other years have been different. It's overly bready and the hops aren't vibrant enough to pull it up out of the muddled flavors. This would be better if they made it cleaner or went full on with the malt. It's stuck in the middle area between good and good."
"This is a good beer. Hoppy and tasteful. This is a very good AmIPA. I actually read a post where a guy said that a liquor store clerk said this was a recommended spiced winter beer that some customer would like after the customer's original choice (an ACTUAL spiced winter beer) was sold out. OH TO BE SO WRONG stupid worker guy"
"I love this beer. It is the best damn beer for the price hands down. $12 for the 12 pack and could not pass up.. I actually have had may 30 of these or so this season and I love everyone of them. I am not going to say how it tastes, because nobody cares, so I just want people to know this beer is fantastic and I will buy every year that I am still drinking beer."
"In my opinion, this one's a solid fresh hop IPA, but not an exceptional example of the category. Good, but not incredible. As far as drinkability goes, I could drink a shitload of these, which is not bad for a nearly 7% beer."
"one final note is that I have no idea how this has has the same BU's as Torpedo. I haven't drank them side by side but I remember Torpedo being way bigger than this but when i looked up the BU's they are the same. Dunno...."
"D: Incredibly drinkable beer, love the flavors and love the balance."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark gold/light copper with a big and sticky tan head. Lively aromas of predominantly orange citrus and caramelly malts, with a bit of resin in there as well. The flavors are positively jumping with hops, with some malty action on the mid- and back-palate to provide some stability. A bold holiday ale that doesn't stoop or pander in any way."
"I picked this up at a local Trader Joe's Supermarket. I will have to keep my eye out for the next case since the 6 pack just wasn't enough."
"Poured a nice amber brass color with a nice thick white active head. Smell is hop dominated up front but has a hint of malt sweetness in the background. Taste is of citrus grassy hops and perhaps a bit of mint or tobaco in the background, the hops are balance by a nice sweet malt that isnt overlooked but is not as present as the fresh hops in this beer. This is a medium bodied beer wiht a nice active amount of carbonation that leaves a nice dry smooth finish. Very excellent winter beer and very drinkable."
"D-This beer has decent drinkability.Not overly exciting but solid."
"Mouthfeel is mild, but a thick feel. I feel like this is thicker then some of the other IPAs, and it really is just an overall well made brew."
"Drinkability - I can see why people rave for this beer every year. Now, I will be also. What a great brew!!! Good in all aspects. I could make an evening of this without any sort of problem. This beer makes me want for Christmas year round. Definitely worth a try if available."
"Great brew for the winter holidays. poured a nice golden redish color, with like 3 finger white head. The smell of this beer is wonderful you can smell the spices they use for sure! The taste is nice very hoppy taste, a bit bitter the first sip but very nice on the ride down the throat. Mouthfeel is great a bit of a tounge puncher at first but goes down good. The best thing about this beer is it's drinkability, could easily go through a six pack on a cool winter's night(not to many in Fl but good to drink anytime)! Overall a great brew for the holidays!"
"Really good! I want this again! While it does have nice malt flavors, make no mistake--this is a hoppy (bitter) beer. I like hops and it works for me. Bring this to your holiday gatherings, but understand that it won't appeal to all palates. If you're an IPA lover, this is a must try!"
"Higher ABV than I'd choose, but a truly fantastic beer."
"In the end, this beer is very enjoyable from the label to the drink. I would love to drink this during my winter break and take a break from stouts when I feel the need to."
"Mouthfeel was pretty big but, surprisingly I wanted more when my glass was empty."
"This is a great seasonal. Like much of the Sierra line, great taste, readily available and very affordable."
"Thank you Sierra for another fine Celebration."
"I must have had bad stuff last year- I love this now - great beer & a great value"
"Ok drinking, but nothing I would seek out."
"D: I would down the entire sixer in a heartbeat if it wasn't for the generous 6.8% on this bad boy"
"D - Very drinkable. I am usually not a big IPA fan but this a great beer that strikes a nice balance between flavor and a clean finish. Great beer all around."
"D: Highly drinkable beer. Goes down very easily."
"D- Great IPA and will look forward to winter after winter"
"A very drinkable beer. I'm tempted to have another."
"D: This one is easy to drink for sure (second one for the night). Great flavor, good price, and a great session beer to introduce to others. I would definitely pick one of these up for the game."
"D: Very drinkable. You can put this beer down quickly and want to grab a few more. At close to 7% ABV I didn't think pre-taste that I would feel this way."
"Very enjoyable, indeed.. Aged very well!!"
"Pours a golden orange color with a big head and lots of lacing. A lot of resinous pine on the nose, a little bit of bread as well. This beer goes down smooth. The dominant flavor component is the hops, lots of different hop flavors going on here. Pine, citrus, grass etc. This is a great session beer, a great beer to keep around the house but not my idea of what a winter beer should be. I like something darker with more spice to it. That being said this is a great American IPA and definitely worth picking up a case or two for the house."
"I poured it into a pint glass so I could enjoy the aroma as well as the taste. It poured with very little head, but laced the glass nicely as I drank it. It was not a bad beer by any means. It is a bit more btter than I prefer. It was a nice amber color, and had a great hop aroma. Beyond the bitterness, it finished smooth, a nice aftertaste. A perfect beer for a cold winter day in Illinois."
"Drink- Buy a sixer and turn on the game. Done and done."
"D- Great IPA and although not my favorite, it certainly is no slouch."
"D: My first celebration, and it won't be my last, whether to session, or have by the case. Great stuff."
"Notes: I picked this up originally not knowing this was an IPA. I honestly thought it was gonna be a spicy Christmas style beer. It's pretty cool IMO to have a Christmas IPA. It just makes me love Sierra Nevada more."
"Perfect winter seasonal that I look forward this as winter approaches. Very reasonable price too @ $8.99."
"M/D: Medium bodied, has a sweet finish, not very bitter at all. Overall a very solid IPA, I like the sweet finish even though it is not overly malty."
"I think this is my third taste of Sierra Nevada (Pale Ale, 30th Anniversary Barleywine) and"
"D -- This beer is delicious and adds to its drinkability, but the resinous mouthfeel and alcohol become a little fatiguing. This would be a nice sipper on a cold afternoon in a quiet, cozy pub."
"Overall, this was a nice refreshing brew. What we liked most about this was how elegant it appeared, almost glowing. Everything else was certainly enjoyable, and the whole cone hops make for an interesting tasting. When we first starting sipping it tasted chocolaty, as if it were three-quarters American IPA and one-quarter chocolate stout which, again, made this quite a memorable selection."
"D - I could drink this beer all day. One of my Favorite IPA's."
"D - Pretty good, and pretty easy to put down. Quite enjoyable and flavorful."
"D- Like all other Sierra Nevada beers you can predict how this beer tastes and it most often is a very good beer. This one fits the mold."
"D: Easily a sessionable beer. I have done it. I love this beer. It honestly does not get much better than this beer."
"Celebration is a must try for west coast IPA fans. This is not my first go at this one, but the first time I concentrated on the details. I had one on-tap a couple of weeks ago and it was really good, but I was out with friends and not concentrating on the beer as much as the conversation etc. I'm gonna go back and try it on tap again and take some notes."
"D: Nice beer to savor but easy to have multiple in one session."
"This beer pours a darkish golden color with a small lacing head. The smell is a bit weak and a bit harsh. The taste isnt weak, very dry with a strong. Taste very simlair to the pale ale with some cinimmon flavors. Harsh after tase might turn some people off. Overall i found it very enjoyable, much reccomended."
"Pours a clear, deep copper with quite a head. Big and creamy and lasts forever. Thick rings the whole way down the glass. Think there are a few hops in there? Well if the head doesn't give it away, the nose will. Truck loads of grapefruit and other citrus aromas flood the senses. Palate starts out with lots of hops. Fruity and piney with alot of raw flavor. Finish is dry and bitter to the core. This is American IPA at it's purest. Not alot of balance but it works. This is a nice break from all the spiced up malty heavyweights that are typical for the holiday season. Cheers and Merry Christmas!"
"Drinkability: A superior IPA and really the benchmark for the style in my opinion. I look forward to having this every winter and every winter I'm more impressed by it. If you haven't had this beer yet, you definitely need to reshuffle your priorities."
"Received as a gift from a co-worker. Beautiful bottle opened and poured into my snifter. The copper color was beautiful and festive with an awesome foamy white fluffy head. So nice I took a picture of it. The smell was fantastic and just about what i expected from my first wet hopped ale. The taste was certainly hop forward with a nice malt in the back. Strong hop for sure. Mouthfeel was medium and I did get the ""drinkable"" quality the previous reviewers had mentioned. Awesome."
"Pours a beautiful reddish copper with a two-finger white head. Lacing is off the charts and the retention is great as well. Really awesome looking beer. Hoppy aroma, mainly pine and citrus. Hops off the bat. Pine leads the way as the bitter hops lead. Very small grapefruit notes balance out the hop profile a bit. Despite the hops, sweet, thick, caramel and bready malt show up a bit until the end, where the bitter pine hops take over again. Very fresh vibe to this beer which is nice about a seasonal IPA. Guaranteed freshness, unless you're seeing it out of season..."
"D: I love this beer! Beers like this are turning me into a bit of a hop-head, I'm afraid!"
"D:This is a very drink able beer i might buy another case this year but prolly buy at least one case every year they come out with this one."
"Bravo, Sierra Nevada for taking it to the next level!!"
"Drinkability: This is a highly. Drinkable beer. Nothing over powering about it, just a nice, subtle, belly-warming winter selection. And at about $3/six cheaper than the Bell's Christmas Ale sitting next to it on the shelf, this would be an easy choice to make again."
"Solid head and a good nose on this beer. Smell is fantastic with excellent amounts of hop aroma and vegetal notes all over the place. Obviously hops are the star. Not well balanced, but this one is all about the hop bitterness so it's appropriate. Finish is a bit dry and the body is quite smooth for the style. Relatively easy to drink for an IPA. I'm surprised it didn't push me to a bitter burnout. The bitterness is obviously strong, but somehow it hits me the way Arrogant Bastard does. I can just keep drinking it."
"A win for Sierra Nevada."
"Overall: A more refined version of Pale Ale, which I also like."
"Definitely a good IPA and great for drinking near a Christmas tree. The smell of noble pine from my tree mixed with the complex hops from this brew are a good combination."
"D - Very high. I'm going to get another right after I submit this. Another great offering from Sierra Nevada."
"D: Great IPA. Pure American hoppiness, but not overpowering."
"I really enjoyed this offerening because it was an IPA which is different from most holiday offerings. I would definitely recommend this to any IPA lover as a good holiday brew(Note: 2010 edition)."
"Wow... I love this beer. Many thanks to the guy who left one in my fridge after a party! Very strong hop aroma and flavor, but isn't too bitter when you drink it. The finish is surprisingly clean given the amount of hops. Beautiful orange amber color when poured."
"The smell description carries over to the taste. The balance between hops and malts is almost perfect here. The citrus flavors from the hops are present at first and the bitterness is in your face but is instantly subdued to a more earthy texture. The aftertaste with the balanced bitterness and the astringent feel it leaves behind is great."
"D. This is a nice smooth drinkable beer and even though I am not a fan of IPA's I will have to say I would recommend this for anyone that likes this style of beer."
"No problem putting this one back at all. I think there are other hoppy offerings I prefer to the 2010 Celebration, but this certainly was a welcomed change of pace and I'll surely be checking it next year again. Solid B+ beer for me."
"D-A warming beer, great on a cold night."
"This has a bit more carbonation than I would like but it gives a nice change of pace from the normal winter seasonals."
"M: Sharp from the hops, but it still has some body."
"Carbonation is less than I expected and the brew is a little dry, but juicy during the taste and doesn't dry out until after the finish. While a little vegetal, it is more of a spice flavor than a bland flavor. Maybe it's the west coast hops, or maybe it's the great brewers, or maybe it's both."
"D- Easy to drink and have a few. For the price it is a really nice drink for the holiday season."
"While I'd love to drink several of these, it's not necessarily the easiest to drink, even if it is good."
"Poured a clear, dark copper/red from a stout 12 oz bottle with no ABV or freshness date on the label. Solid, solid frothy head that stays for an eternity. The piney hoppy aroma hits you the moment the bottle is cracked open. Beautiful lacing as you keep taking mouthfuls of this beauty. Strong on the hops, with a hint of sweet caramel, but the pine-hops flavor overpowers in a perfectly balanced way. Hands down one of the best IPA's around. It will leave you with a nice buzz, drinkability is good, but I would recommend keeping the consumption in check. It is a very delicious brew, which leaves you wanting more. A solid beer from Sierra Nevada, highly recommended."
"D: Very drinkable beer with lots of hop flavor, and low ABV. Celebration has lots of flavor without blowing your taste buds to shreds and that is what keeps me coming back for more."
"D: I love the fresh hops. Reminds me of Deschutes Inversion but the fresh hops put it a notch above. Will be getting multiple sixers of this one."
"d 4 apparently I've been travelling on the assumption that I already reviewed this beer. guess I had instead decided I would have nothing to add to the many reviews. oh well, screw modesty and humility. celebration is very good, varies a bit from year to year. this year there's a lot of lingering bitterness, but not as much aroma as i'd prefer. still solid as a brick house."
"What an impressive head, very few beers show a thick lacing like Celebration does. Brassy amber color shows a bright clarity. Sharp citric and minty hop notes in the nose with some toasted grain in the back, a pretty big aroma. Medium bodied with a deep crispness. Hop bitterness is pretty sharp as it easily cuts through the malt from sip to sip. Hop flavors range from tobacco to mint, grapefruit peel to green tea. Toasted grain and a mild caramel maltiness lay deep beneath the hop character. Warming alcohol pokes through with a quick fume and clean fruitiness. Finishes bitter with a quick kiss of malt. This is the typical veteran hophead's first pick for winter seasonals and a great pick at that."
"D: Taste is nice and hoppy, drinks smooth, the almost 7% ABV is barely noticeable which could be dangerous, but is enjoyed very much."
"I look forward to this every year and never disappoints."
"The celebration pours a nice dark gold, almost copper but not as dark. Immediately you know this is going to be a rather carbonated ale due to all of the rising suds! The pour gave way to about an inch and a half head that kind of stays with you for a while. Upon smelling and tasting..to be honest, this is a great beer but its almost as though its a more refined, more grown up version of the standard SN Pale. Its crisp, not very complex but at the same time full of flavor and just overall, a well crafted brew. I would say that the alcohol is a bit more present in this ale..more so than other SN beers ive had."
"Get it While you can!!"
"D- A great IPA and perhaps a new favorite from SN."
"D - A tasty recipe that will bring you back for another if time and circumstances allow."
"Pours a lovely clear amber with a three finger head, foamy and inviting. Smells of fresh wet hops; citrus and pine. Taste is very smooth at first, flavour hits the palatte beautifully with the citrus notes at the front, bitter finish. Easy to drink this beer, medium mouthfeel. Something to look forward to every year around this time. Absoulte gem from Sierra Nevada."
"Really refreshing and a different style of IPA than your everyday run of the mill versions. Recommended!"
"D - Considering I had four of these, I'd say it's quite drinkable! I would have preferred two Celebrations and two beers of another type. Two of these is enough of this particular flavor for me. Drinkable considering ABV."
"Overall: This is a good recommendable beer. It is worth a try but if you want something that truly represents a ""fresh hop"" beer this is not the beer you are looking for. On a scale of 1 to a 100 this beer is an 80. Good beer but breweries go through great lengths to fresh hop beer. This beer just has no craftsmanship, no soul. Its the same as when John Coltrane stopped shooting heroin."
"D - Excellent session brew. Delicious. Alcohol is moderate but i could see drinking a sixer of this stuff no problem. If you have chance to pick some of this up do so."
"Taste is very easy-going. Although very bitter, it seems that there is not a lot of flavorful hop presence. This isn't necessarily bad, but when I look to have an IPA, I usually want to be pummeled with Citrus and pine. This one seems to be very well balanced, but with a strong bitter profile. It lingers nicely, like most SN ales do."
"Fresh, tingling, and crisp with a creamy thick body and high carbonation that doesn't detract from the smooth body. A strong point of this beer. Overall, a nice offering from Sierra Nevada; maybe a personal favorite from a brewery I'm not typically crazy about."
"Taste: Subtly biscuity at first. Then morphs into a mellow, vanilla-like sweetness. The hops come in strong at the end, spicy and bitter--peppery. Smooth feel and good drinkability."
"Overall, this is a tasty brew. An excellent departure from the spiced holiday offerings on the shelves during this time of year."
"Amazing IPA, surprised it has taken me so long to try it."
"A great example of the style. For the price, this is probably the best IPA bang for the buck there is. Look hard enough and it's easy to find this for a buck a bottle. Highly recommended."
"M - adequate but low carbonation"
"A Beer in Review. I think it is evident that I love this beer. The flavor is perfect for the season, and its availability sort of hypes up my excitement for the beer. The earthy flavors make this beer stand out, and it is a great choice for a nationally available seasonal brew."
"D - To really appreciate this beer you must drink it on tap. A excellent session beer which is well crafted with a generous amount of hops."
"Goes down very nicely; it's easy to crack a few without noticing. That is until you stand up of course."
"Between the alcohol content and the hops overload, not to mention the $7.99/6 pack price, this is one of my favorite winter beers."
"As advertised, a fresh hop ale. Hops are center stage with all other characters in a minor roll. Good hop lover brew!"
"Rich orange-copper pour with a nice frothy off-white head. Smells of orange zest, spices, pine and caramel and a hint of lemon. Piny hop flavor with lots of caramel malt background and a generous amount of spice. Good medium body with lots of soft carbonation."
"D - One of the 3 most drinkable beers I know of. This beer has been a go to for me since I started drinking beer and is the PERFECT beer for the holiday season. Pretty much the only IPA I have a desire to drink during the winter months, and I drink it more frequently than any other beer during this time of year. A favorite. One of the 5 or so beers I expect to consume most of in my lifetime."
"A great, great beer and a perfect IPA for the colder months. I highly recommend this one."
"This was one of my first IPAs when I was younger, and I hooked on it ever since! It has a beautiful smell that is very robust and yet lite, However, when you drink it you get punched in the mouth with a flavor that is out of this world! When served at the right temperature this beer could knock you out of your boots with its amazingly fresh taste! It has a strong hoppy taste without all the bitterness to most IPAs. I was very happy to taste this beer for the first time, second, third and so on... This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had!"
"D- Great beer, wonderfull thirst quencher, I love the fresh feel of this beer."
"But the latest batch I am drinking (0278xxxx)sometimes gives me hints of phenolic character hiding behind the intensity of the hops. Just putting this out there in case others might have experienced this and are afraid to say so due to the overwhelming majority of excellent reviews. I'm not even sure if its just me as sometimes I can detect it and sometimes not. More research necessary. Otherwise this is a near 5.0 beer."
"Above average drinkability for an IPA. This is exactly the drinkability you'd want from a 6-7% IPA."
"this is an incredibly drinkable beer. still can't believe this comes in at 6.8% abv. what a thirst quencher. wish it wasn't seasonal because I would stock up in the summertime."
"In the end, Celebration is a wonderful IPA and seasonal offering from Sierra Nevada."
"D - An all around good IPA, easy to drink with great balance."
"Much is written about this beer year in and year out in the forums. From the mystery of ""spices"" to the BA who will undoubtedly claim the recipe has been changed. One thing is certain this is among the very best of and a classic Holiday Ale brewed in America and at one time before the bastardization of hops into alcohol delivery devices and vice versa, Celebration was the king of all hops."
"Medium body, a little chewy, and some sticky feels. Drinks smooth and refreshing for sure. This isn't one of the best IPAs I've tasted at all, but it still manages to measure up pretty well."
"D - A good IPA. As a winter seasonal I tend to pick maltier beers over hoppy ones, but that is just a personal preference."
"D-Very drinkable. It goes down smoothly , but also has plenty of substance to keep you interested."
"Very pleasant beer from our friends in Chico."
"and kudos and all dap to SN for charging a fair price."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable beer (big surprise from Sierra Nevada, *sarcasm*) that I get my fill of each and every year."
"Drinkability: Through the roof. Good taste, great mouthfeel and relatively low ABV combine to make this beer among the most drinkable I have tried. Definitely recommended."
"D: Not so well. The flavor sticks to the palate and makes it tired after few sips."
"Drinks: like a celebration in my mouth. Sierra Nevada's winter IPA isn't their best, and it doesn't have any of the wintery spiciness that some expect. But it's a decent brew, and one that should be on anyone's winter beer list."
"Overall a nice IPA that is better than most though it is not amazing. A great IPA for the price though."
"Overall, I was really excited about trying this beer on tap. While it was much different than I expected, it was still exceptional. This is one of those beers that you should never turn down a chance to drink."
"I am wildly out of practice when it comes to pouring from a bottle, vice a CAN. Once the panic of a near-overflow subsided, I was looking at a rocky two fingers' worth of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose was both earthy and piney, like being out in the forest and taking a deep breath. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with an immediate burst of very piney hops on the tongue. Man, this is the kind of thing that caused me to become a hophead in the first place! Great Gaddang, but this was right in my skewed wheelhouse. It's a good thing that I liked it, since I bought a gigantor 24-ounce bottle and I could not find anyone to share it with me. Boo hoo. The finish swept through with a minty chill that really sent shivers up and down my spine. Peering into my glass, I took note of some lovely sticky lacing that looked like Jack Frost had been at work. A second, warmer pour released a really earthy aroma, like I had been out digging around in my backyard. I liked just letting it roll around on my tongue since the hops did not have a heavy bite, but more of a wintergreen flavor. Only $3.95 for this?!? A freakin' bargain and worth revisiting, if I could get people to come over/have me over."
"I was excited to have it with my Thanksgiving dinner, but I actually had to switch to Bud Light instead. Yea, I know."
"This is a great beer for those in love with big, hoppy, and overall, bitter IPAs. It's not as finely balanced as the Dogfish Head 90 or Bell's Two Hearted, but I don't think that's the point. This is a fine beer to sip on a cold night when other, super malty warmers have got you down, or if you've just got a craving for a super bitter IPA that doesn't slap you in the face with hops. A great beer, one it seems is designed for aging."
"DELICIOUS, TREAT YOURSELF!"
"Your quintessential fresh hopped IPA. A World class example in consistency. Always pleasing and enjoyable."
"D- If you like straight foward American IPA's, this is a very drinkable brew."
"An interesting winter beer selection in an IPA. I guess winter beers aren't just malty anymore. It has great flavor with nice balance although it's hard for me to give up my malty winter warmer. As an IPA it is wonderful and as a winter beer it certainly has holiday flavors built right in."
"It feels good, and I do love the timing of the release. Usually by now I've started drifting away from IPAs (a bit) for the season but this is a reminder of the good times that grow on the bines. I feel like I'm in Yakima all over again."
"D - Considering the crisp cleanliness of the hops and the subtle herbal and fruity flavors and low abv, I could definitely drink many of these in a session."
"Was looking forward to having this beer! Last year around this time I was just getting into craft. Pours a clear amber color with a medium head that diminishes quickly. Scent is DELICIOUS hoppy goodness with just a bit of malt. A lot of pine and grapefruit aromas. Taste is very delightful. It reminds me of a very fresh Torpedo with a bit more malt character. At first I get some pine, followed by grapefruit and sweet apricot flavors. Then followed by some hop bitterness with a bit of caramel malt. Very well-balanced IMO. Mouthfeel is nice and full bodied with great carbonation. Drinkability is very high. I could see why people would complain about having an IPA as a Christmas/Winter ale, but I have no complaints. Love this beer!"
"Bitter grapefruit taste lingers far too long. Can't wait to have a different beer once this one is done. Am not impressed at all. I love IPAs but this one just lacks any balance. If you want to drink a grapefruit that has had sex with a pine tree, then this is the beer for you."
"Very drinkable. Does this have to be a seasonal? I could have this anytime."
"very clear amber color with white frothy head about 2 fingers. Definite hoppy aroma and some earthy traces. Nice dry and of course hoppy taste and nice touch of sweet maltiness. Really smooth creamy feel, medium body and great finish that last forever. Poured from 12 oz. bottle in pint glass."
"D - I remember really loving this beer last year (2009) and this year I am not as impressed, however it's a well rounded solid brew."
"I love the way this beer looks on the golden side of amber has a big ole puffy tan head that sticks around a long time and clings to the glass like crazy. The smell is strong piney with citrus lightly behind it/ The taste follows with strong bitterness, a touch of alcohol. It has long lasting carbonation and good body. My problem is that the more you drink of it , the more you taste the alcohol. I think those are the hops scraping my taste buds. Yum!"
"Purchased a 2009 vintage bottle from City Beer in San Francisco. I was told this can age well, so I decided to go for it. Pours a bright orange colour with thick white head. Nice lacing around the glass. Smells of faint herbal hops, brown sugar and caramel. It almost smells more like a barley wine than an IPA, but it is from 2009 so that isn't surprising. Flavour is quite sweet, still enough bitterness though. Carbonation level is nice. I would like to try this fresh someday."
"Appearance is a dark, golden, almost amber hue. Lots of foam on this one. Plenty of lacing as well. Smells like light hops, dark fruit, spices. Tastes are similar. Like a fruity/spicy pale ale. Some citrusy undertones. Maybe nutmeg or clove, some other spice. Very drinkable."
"Overall: A classic! cheers to SN for this one I do love the stuff."
"D - Crisp, fresh, and easy drinking while still being interesting to the palette. A delicious, highly sessionable IPA. I will definitely visit this one again."
"D~Very nice, drinkable beer for a cold winter day."
"Will be a seasonal I drink every year from now on."
"D - Drinkability is off the charts for me, I blew through this Sixer pretty quickly."
"The feel is very creamy and body is really pretty thick. The carbonation is fairly mild, but perfect in my eyes with this much viscosity. It's a beautifully fresh and clean IPA, has all of the qualities I think a good one should posses."
"Drinkability: The bitterness in the end lingers a bit, but this is an enjoyable brew."
"D-well its not that terrible of a drinker. I got a 6 pack and i'm sure to drink a few of them at a time and even tho the taste didn't fair amazingly well with me, i'm excited to have some more."
"D- The hops lingers after the dry finish. Very fresh and refreshing beer."
"RJT"
"D: This beer is meant for celebrating! This one is easy to drink, with big flavor and no let downs. Another wonderful beer from SN!"
"Notes: Setting aside some of their bigger bottles this might be my favorite Sierra Nevada so far."
"Drinkability is good. I like the uniqueness of it being a seasonal, end of hops season, IPA. It seems to extract a much different focus from the hops. Much more earthy and spicy, a nice beer. Cheap cost too!"
"Like all things Sierra Nevada, this is a keeper. Good flavors, good alcohol, just a shame it's a seasonal."
"Overall, an excellent holiday brew."
"Date: 2010"
"This one pours a light bodied auburn in color with a light off white head that sits atop the brew. It is light and well carbonated, releasing bubbles from the bottom of the brew the entire session. It smells very dry and hoppy and has a little musk to it. It drinks like dry, very dry and gives me cotton mouth. It's very hoppy but not piny or citrusy. I'd say it's better than the Sierra Pale. It drinks very crisp and light bodied. I like this one. You wouldn't know it's 6.8%."
"D: Good beer for a cold, cloudy day. Looking forward to drinking more of this beer in the coming months."
"D: Hmmm.... which on is better - Torpedo or this one? Since it's been a few months since I've had the former, and I honestly don't remember it being this good, I'm going to go with Celebration. I could easy pop a few of these."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is not mild, lots of hops up front, a bit of citrus, considerable bitterness, a touch of malts. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"D: I agree that this is a highly anticipated winter seasonal. I get a 1/6th keg every year as soon as it becomes available. This could be a little dangerous though with the 6.8 % ABV and easy drinkability. I think it's much better on tap then from a bottle."
"Big, satisfying flavours on this holiday IPA but I'm not detecting the cinnamon taste that others have noted. And that makes sense to me since Celebration doesn't have any spices added to it. High drinkability as I could easily pack back a sixer over an evening or two, but because this isn't available around here I'll be limiting myself to one bottle per night. I look forward to savouring the rest of my half case over the next two weeks."
"Poured a reddish copper color with a very slight haze and an impressive rocky white head. Fabulous head retention and tons of wet sticky lacings. A nice blend of floral and citrus hop aromas with a hint of sweet malt beneath. Medium bodied with pleasant carbonation. A wonderfully smooth and drinkable beer. Complex hop flavors in the beginning, apple and citrus flavors mixed with malt sweetness that slowly taper s to a bitter, hoppy pine finish that slowly fades away. An instant holiday favorite."
"The taste is much more balanced than the nose. The crystal malt is bold and rich. The hops have good flavor and aren't overpowering. Very easy to sip down and it has good weight in my mouth. Definitely a good IPA, but it's not a life changer."
"drinkability: very vibrant and well-hopped, has a good abv, and with a pleasant consistency."
"Drinkability: The hops are very noticeable but enjoyable nonetheless. Definitely something I would like to try again on tap but not something I would make a night of."
"D: This beer is exceptionally drinkably. The ABV is not overwhelming, the hops are balanced well. Great session beer."
"Not my cup of tea."
"Big, satisfying flavours on this holiday IPA with high drinkability despite the ABV. I look forward to savouring the rest of my case over the next little while."
"Pours with a small half finger head that fades away fast to a slight ring. Clear amber in color. Smells of American C hops and some sweet alcohol. Tastes of hops and a slight bit of sweetness. The finish is bitter and piney that lingers. A bit out of balance for me. Low carbing and thin body. I could take only a few of these in a night."
"I love this beer. For $7.49 a six pack, this is in my fridge a LOT when it's available. Nice pour. Medium to dark clear amber with a nice fluffy 2 finger off white head that has solid retention. Lacing lacks a bit. Hop profile is perfect for a winter time ipa. Big pine, with a nice level of lemon and grapefruit. Great bitterness. Biscuity and caramel malts hold it up. Nothing is overdone about this beer, but it certainly doesnt lack flavor. Perfectly balanced."
"Celebration 2010 brewing. One finger head of fluffy very light brown foam. Head really didn't last very long, but left a nice clinging lace. Color is a 16 on the SRM beer color chart. I detect fragrances of lime, orange, lemon, green tea, and hops. Very flavorful. Heavy on the citrus, sour side, but good tastes, of lemon, orange, lime, and of course hops. Lots of body in my mouth, like heavy cream, but much cleaner after feel. I waited for this for better than a month since the talk was out that it had hit the shelves in other places. I guess South Georgia is one of the last stops. I will look foreword to having more of this. I want others to have a taste, but I don't really want to share this one. It is goood."
"It's drinkable, goes down easy, and is a nice enough beer to drink while watching TV or some other situation where you don't really care to have what your drinking be the main focus of your concentration."
"This is a moderately drinkable beer. I'm a big fan of SN but this didn't hit the mark for me."
"It's so enjoyable I'm gonna drink a few more! Very good for the style. A sort of Christmas IPA. This beer was born the same time I was and I bet it was a game changer back then. It still is now when you compare it to other brews that come around this time of year. Wow! An IPA for Christmas! All I can say is thanks Sierra Nevada! Rarely do they disappoint."
"The feel I cannot say enough about - deceptively smooth and satisfying, cask-like, but with a nicely-balanced, strangely appealing carbonic bite just prior to the moderately dry finish. Great crystal malt and English-style malt presence in the flavor as well as that confounding hop bouquet. I wouldn't say I got a significant dose of fruity or herby flavors anywhere. A unique, refined, and tasty concoction. I could easily stumble into a session with this."
"This beer is good but doesnt do a whole lot for me. Id much prefer Torpedo or SNPA."
"Drinkability - Not bad in the least. Very balanced, though still definitely an IPA. Easy drinker, good choice for the cold months ahead. Admittedly, I still prefer Torpedo over this tasty seasonal."
"D: Great beer. Look forward to it every season."
"The finish wasn't the driest but was still very clean and massively bittering. A very well done combination of malts and *dominating* hops but not as good smelling as it tastes. Not the most refreshing beer but with the the right body and carbonation for an AIPA. Very drinkable."
"overall, sierra nevada never lets me down, i love this company and this beer is amazing!"
"D-this is a great warm winter beer. At a high alcohol percentage, may not be the best session beer, but a great way to warm up on those cold winter nights."
"Drinkability: This is really good stuff. Not only does it have bite, but it also has a very well-balanced malt quality to keep it from going over the bitterness edge."
"The beer is very clear and had a nice head that left a proper lacing on the glass. Good pine/malt aroma but I didn't take more than a small sniff. Very satisfying after my first giant gulp. Dry, spicy hops. Very balanced. Exactly what I needed. This beer basically drank itself. I would have ordered another, but the bartender already had my check for me as I had a to-go food order. Delicious. However, seems to have less hoppy bite than the past years."
"Overall - An excellent IPA from SN, and I now remember why I loved this one so much when I first tried it. It's definitely going to be a regular in my fridge while it's available!"
"Overall this beer is a nice IPA with a strong malt backbone and a nice balance of flavors, it is not as juicy as many IPAs but has a very rich feeling to it and plenty of hop character. For the strength of flavors this is an easy drinking beer."
"D: Before this beer, I was unaware that IPAs could fall in the winter seasonal area. This beer is slightly darker than an IPA and makes me want to buy a bottle on Christmas Eve and hang out. I highly recommend it if you a fan of the style and are looking for a winter version."
"D - through the roof on this one. balanced IPA yet good enough for the biggest hop craving. this one just reminds me of this time of year. what alcohol?"
"Celebration had a foamy, free flowing flavor that was not aggressive at all. In a way, the flavoring left a lot to the imagination...in that I was waiting for more creativity to kick in. As it was on cask, naturally it had no carbonation, which in hindsight may have actually aided to the sharpness I have come to expect from Sierra Nevada."
"Overall, an excellent seasonal offering from SN, especially for the price."
"I look forward to the release of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale every year. Recommended."
"I really like the way this wintry beer breaks up the Big Stout and Spicy Warmer theme of the season. Don't get me wrong, those are all well and good and I love many of them, but a spruced up hop-bomb in the middle of winter just oozes holiday cheer. Now if the holidays would just get here. Cheers!!!!"
"Drinkabilty - I was hopping for this to be amazing but it is ok. I wish it was a little less bitter and a little more malts and spices. Its ok but not what i was expecting."
"The beer has the great nose and creamy mouth feel of most Sierra Nevada's lineup. What sets it apart are the biting fresh hops which dominate and do not disappoint."
"Overall a very well-made beer to be taken slowly an with appreciation."
"This is a fabulous, sessionable, approachable AIPA: highly drinkable with good crossover flavor character, and a bargain (absolute bargain) at the going 12-pack price. I am going to stock up and see if my macro-drinking friends find it as approachable as I think it is. Gateway beer."
"Not bad, but not as good as I was expecting. My first time ever trying this beer..."
"Nice beer, solid IPA."
"notes: I had this on draught the other day and it was much better."
"Drinkability was decent , I was expecting a (looking at the label) Christmas beer !, with all the spices and goodies they add to them , , Not a bad IPA at all but not what I expected, still it's a very drinkable beer and would seek it out again."
"D: Great drinkability, while this is a nice session brew, the overall flavor are just above up to par for an IPA."
"This is a decent beer-- but not one I'll be looking forward to all year."
"2010 bottling. I saw all the reviews and had BIG expectations. Pours nicely, nice head, lacing on the glass, looks great.... then taste it and... blah! I'm not impressed. It seems to be trying to do to much. A bitter hops flavor gives way to spice but to me just doesn't come together properly. Maybe it will grow on me."
"Not quite as hoppy/malty as previous years, but still damn good. One of my favorite IPAs. I look forward to these every holiday season."
"I look forward to this one each celebration season."
"Final thoughts- A well-balanced IPA from a top tier brewery. On a side note, I love the name. I always feel like I have something to celebrate when I pick up this winner."
"D- Well balanced. Not as hoppy as I remeber it, but great flavors. A successful winter IPA... I love it!"
"D - Well I did like it in the bottle and it drinks dry hopped on tap so it does change drastically. A nice seasonal that is a nice spin on a winter beer,"
"I've heard of the controversy as to enjoy this one fresh or cellar and honestly, it is up to your personal preference. When fresh, you best enjoy the fresh hop addition, but cellaring better brings out the complex underlying malt profile. Either way, this is one seasonal that I will keep looking forward each year."
"Pours a dark copper with a big white puffy head. Aroma is PINE forest. Big pine notes with some grapefruit and wet grass. Taste is a once bitter but crisp with that big hoppy pine flavor. But all is well balanced as a slight malt kick evens it out and brings you back for another sip. Its just another great hop delight from SN."
"D- this is a solid ipa and a great one for the winter. Good spice and toast that lends well to the season."
"Taste is sweet, harsh and piney. It's crisp and drinkable. Very tasty and sweet, a bit harp and acidic but easy drinking."
"Kind of happy to see this one on the shelf, for some reason I thought it was discontinued.... Pours an orange amber with one finger foamy white head, good retention and lacing. Smell is malty sweetness, pineapple and tropical fruit malts, a bit of pine. Taste is bitter and fruity up front, pale/light malts provide a bit of sugary balance. Mouthfeel is medium body with a medium carbonation, clean but flavorful. This is a very drinkable IPA, not too bitter and not too sweet. One of the IPAs that is actually balanced."
"Can't be beat for its price."
"D - I look forward to this one every year, and the 2010 version doesn't disappoint. Hope to find it on draft soon!"
"Rock solid IPA. Highly recommend."
"D: Delightfully drinkable for a slightly higher ABV beer. I'll definitely be finishing the bottle and I'll certainly be sharing this one with family come holiday time."
"Overall, an IPA without the super strong citrus or hop notes seen in most but a nice depth of spices, absolutely incredible and wonderfully unique"
"D-I rank this up there with Racer 5 as one of the best IPAs on the planet, but with a higher malt bill than racer and more body. This one never lets me down..."
"Having sampled holiday offerings this year from Anchor, Breckenridge, Avery, Samuel Adams, Samuel Smith, Shiner, so far, I have the distinct feeling that Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale 2010, is the best of the best."
"D- This brew is a delight and makes the Holidays even more exciting. A great IPA that's great to drink."
"A warm, translucent copper color with a thin sheet of lace. A lively carbonation feeds a two or three foamy islands on the surface of the beer. Definitive pine notes on the nose with a bright, juicy grapefruit aroma all backed by a firm malt character. These aromas persists on the palate though the hops take a stronger lead. The citrus is a bit more bitter than the aroma led me to believe but it's a pleasant surprise. It starts with a nice semi-sweet orange flavor leading to grapefruit and a dry, bitter pine needle finish. There's a certain earthy quality to it, like a pine forest after a rain shower, which I assume is due to the use of fresh hops. The bitterness is aggressive but not overwhelming and doesn't go any further than the malt will allow which is a definite plus. The strong malt backbone to this one helps provide a full, smooth mouthfeel that accentuates the flavors beautifully. I found this beer to be incredibly easy-drinking and it seemed to hit almost every note. If I had to pick something to improve I would say that the aroma could be amped up a little bit and maybe just a tiny bit more malt but that's my preference. As it is it's an outstanding IPA and a definite must try. I could see myself drinking a lot of these."
"This is a liberally drinkable beer with only a faint sense of alcohol presence. It is medium bodied and smooth on the palate. What we have here is a full-bodied IPA engineered perfectly to be drunk on a cold night whilst sitting before a fire. Not your typical winter warmer but a work of art in most ways - close to perfection in all facets."
"D-The beer is well balanced and dangerously drinkable while having a fuller mouthfeel. Overall it is packed with flavor and aroma and packs a bitter punch that makes for a great combo."
"drinkability - a flavorful and robust brew, flavor is very strong for an ipa"
"Mouthfeel is really medium-bodied for an IPA with a thin carbonated feel. Coats the mouth and tongue very well. Drinkability is very high on this. The 6.8% ABV hits you after one bottle though, especially if the pace you decide to drink it is only a few minutes. Definitely a holiday beer: Thanksgiving and Christmas-worthy. Considerably tasty."
"D - could drink this anytime, any day, would even choose over most other Sierra Nevadas in fact. superb"
"What a great beer. Got a 12 pack and had a bunch of times at Eli's fresh on tap. I think the tastiest one I had was the one I enjoyed when I was playing black ops. So smooth and drinkable. Hops are so refreshing. Very dangerous at 6.8 percent. I could drink a ton of these. Very crisp. Sierra Nevada is such a BA brewery. Their stout, torpedo, pale ale, celebration, bogfoot... ect ect. They rarely miss for me."
"D: My winter IPA of choice. Stays in my fridge, and I can drink anywhere from 1-4 in a night, maybe even the whole sixer if I'm with good company."
"D- A very good brew. Nothing outstanding or special. 2 pints was enough."
"Definitely a classic of the style and one I look forward to enjoying. It will fill the bill for anybody who wants a pretty bitter IPA without being over the top and unbalanced."
"d: For me this is simply a better-than-average IPA. It tastes good, I love IPAs so I will definitely buy this again. This biggest grade raising factor in this one for me was the real earthiness in the taste. Not what I expected from the nose but it was welcomed."
"D - I will be buying many many six packs of this brew over the winter. I love it!"
"Drinkability-Nice and Smooth, can definitly see myself grabbing a few mor sixpacks of this, and will pick it up in the coming years. gonna try and cellar a few of these for the future."
"D: Good drinkability. Easy to have a few in a night. If this had just a little bit more malt backbone to it, I would give it great marks in taste and drink."
"decent drinkability....although the abv % will catch up to you sooner rather than later...."
"Poured carelessly into pint glass. 1 inch white head honey amber color. This is beer is much better than I remember, could be because Ive been focused on IRS' these days and straying from my norm of anything IPA. I like it quite a bit. Better than most SN that I have had, with exception of Bigfoot. Could use a bit more alchohol. Instant citrus and lingering grapefruit. Cheers!"
"D- So so for me. Flavor is nice and it goes down smooth, but I don't really find myself wanting more than the two bottles I had. Strong, clean hop flavors that makes for a nice bitterness. There are other IPAs I like a lot more, but this is good."
"Great balance and really easy-drinking (alcohol is completely masked). If this were in a blind test with other IPAs I'd never associate this beer with the holiday season, but it's a nice reminder of warmer times!"
"2010 Celebration - I've been waiting for this one to come around again - always a favorite. The head on this beer from simply pouring it into a pint glass from the bottle is amazing. Beautiful tight lacing on a nice amber beer. The aroma could actually be a little stronger - maybe it needs to warm up some more to release that. Lots of piney hops - no citrus or skunk notes. Good malt backbone without being cloying. Super well-balanced and solid IPA, glad to have picked up a bunch on sale."
"D: This isn't the easiest IPA to drink due to how grainy and bitter it is. The ABV isn't anything out of the ordinary but it can catch up a little quicker than expected."
"Love this beer! Always have something to get at my local grocery store during the holidays."
"Celebration Fresh Hop Ale--2010 12 oz. Bottle with new name and label. 6.80% ABV. 65 IBU's. (4.5 / 5.0) Lacy thin white chilled head. Clear bright rich amber orange color. Soft aromatic floral gentle hop front. Smooth well balanced mild creamy sweet light caramel IPA Winter Ale body. Soft smooth hop spice end. Delicious as usual! Sampled 11/7/2010 from 6-Pack purchased @ Fred Meyer, Ballard, Seattle fro $6.99 on 11/6/2010."
"this had a strange taste.... it was hoppy but unbalanced... the malts were given to caramel, cinnamon and nutmeg hence the winter scene in the advertising. The first taste did not warrant a need for a second taste, it was a winter warmer type of product which now I know I do not like"
"D- very good drinkability, not overwelming. higher abv that hides alcohol. not warming and quite refreshing. nice balanced taste."
"Celebration is deserving of an outstanding rating and at $7 for a six pack is one of the best deals in town."
"A favorite I look forward to each year. And each year I dink more and more of it. I love the freshness of the hops and that it doesn't relent to the push from the community to produce fruitier and bigger IPA's. I love this beer as-is."
"Celebration Ale is definitely one more reason to look forward to the holidays. A ridiculous beer in my opinion."
"drinkability- a good beer, but im a little bit letdown."
"Pours with a 1.5 finger head, with a beautiful dark golden color. Excellent head retention, with the head lasting the entire way down, a fact made even more impressive by the fact that I was sipping on it. Smell is of straight hops, with a bit of a floral undertone to it. Tastes like hops, hops, and more hops, with an almost earthy taste to it. The bitterness is just right, and also masks the alcohol in the beer. The medium body feels incredibly smooth washing around the mouth, and the carbonation is very pleasant on the tongue. Drinkability is much higher than I expected, at first I thought I would only want one or two of them in one sitting, but as I finish them, I cant help but want some more! A very tasteful and well done IPA. Great job again, Sierra Nevada."
"Overall- Great fresh hop harvest IPA, very drinkable."
"D - Didn't like this one a year ago, but now I can drink it a few times in a night easily. Pretty good drinkability with this one."
"Taste is fresh oily hops citrus grapefruit and drinkability is very high. I have a case on hand throughout the season. Very refreshing. If you like the wet hop ale you will love this. For the price it is a steal. Too bad this isnt available year round or it may just be my goto beer. Well done."
"D : This ""Fresh Hop Ale"" is a yearly treat. And this years is as solid as ever."
"D: this is is perhaps the best winter seasonal around, this is partly due to it being the only IPA of the class so to speak. Either way, it is a well done IPA that features the more piney side of hops without being too bitter."
"It was medium bodied, had a fair bit of carbonation, and a slightly dry finish. It's very drinkable - assuming the corner liquor store cooperates and stocks this, it'll probably be my path of least resistance go-to for the coming months."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable beer and I'm assuming that's why it's such a hit. Not my favorite IPA by any means but it's definitely tasty and goes down way too easy. Glad I tried; it definitely won't be my last sixer."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle of 2010 Celebration into my Ommegang goblet. Huge fluffy 3 fingers of off white head and a nice light brown/golden hue. Smells cascadian, a little citrusy, floral, pine. Light sweet malt. Like the pale on steroids. Dry, bitter goodness on the palate. Very piney. Fluffy, creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Could put away easily half of this 6er. Overall, really makes me think SNPA with a Barry Bonds complex."
"D-Nice to have a few bottles every year when it comes out."
"D - Drinkability is insanely high. Goes down so smoothly and easily. I finished mine a little more than halfway through this review and am surprised. There's almost no hint of the 6.8% ABV that this beer boasts and the complexity and balance this beer delivers is a recipe for easy-drinking. Combined with such a low price point, this may be a go-to for the next couple months. Here's to Winter!"
"Good solid drinkability."
"D: I love this beer and go through a couple cases every year. I would love more hop flavor, but it is still a wonderful beer for the price."
"This is a great beer, plenty of character to take in, well balanced and all around a delight."
"This brew is OK for those who want to encourage neophites to better beer but little else. SN go back to your roots!"
"Pours a cloudy amber orange color with an initial two finger head that dissipates into a thin lace that clings to the glass. Fresh hoppy smell with hints of pine and citrus. Nice sweet taste not too bitter but the hops come through. Really tastes fresh. Even a slight creaminess to it. The beer has a medium carbonation and goes down nice and smooth. Very drinkable. Great beer highly recommended."
"Year after year this is a terrific ipa and I love it. No balance really, but a hop lovers dream, much on the bitter dry end."
"D - This is pretty drinkable. It goes down good, and I could put down a few of these quite easily. I'm not sure why this is a winter beer, but I think its a great regardless. I would drink it all year round."
"D: It's really tough to imagine a more drinkable IPA."
"Drinkability is quite high. I could see drinking these in the dead of winter, but also in the spring, early summer, and perhaps even after mowing the lawn in mid-July. But best of all, I can't wait until the weather gets nasty cold, and I can sit inside with two or three of these. I'm heading back to the store right now to stock up..."
"Drinkability: This beer has bite, but the back end is smooth. Over a nice bit of extremes that balance quite well. It is definitely drinkable."
"Very nicely carbonated with a light amber/orange color and a nice sized head. Faint smell of piney hops. taste is similar. slight bitterness, dry finish. it's a good, decent IPA and one for the price that isn't bad. There isn't anything inherently ""winter"" about this beer. They could release it anytime, but it's good."
"Pours a dark, tarnished copper color. Pour produces an average sized slightly off white head. Head recedes pretty quickly a leave a bit of lacing. As one would expect there's lots of hops to the nose. Taste is again very hop-centric. Lots of piney hops up front, the malts kicks in towards the end for some balance. Has a nice earthy finish. Mouthfeel is a bit stickier that I would have liked but otherwise pretty good. This is my first Celebration and now I can see why people look forward to this every year."
"Insanely drinkable for its ABV, and, given its seasonal status, something I want to drink a lot of before its gone. Distinctive and great."
"D - Few things are better than fresh Celebration. 2010's batch is particularly phenomenal, and it is definitely leagues ahead of 2010 SN Estate."
"D - a really nice brew for this time of year. Can't wait to put a few back next to the fire this winter."
"Drinkability: Well above average drinkability, if you like IPA's. If you don't like well hoped beers, then this beer will most likely be a turnoff. The variation of hops, malts, and alcohol give this beer a type of harmony that really shouldn't be referred to as ""balance"". That's really what makes this beer awesome, it isn't really balanced but it works for this beer."
"Drink- Def. a nice sessionable beer at the bar."
"It's simply too much for me, but I can see how hops heads will go for this. Lots of hop complexities. Drinkability suffers in my case, this is just overpoweringly hop forward."
"This is a very good brew. I'm not the biggest fan of IPA's but this one proved to be very well balanced and drinkable!"
"Drinkability is great. The alcohol is tucked away well, but its the aging aspect that makes this beer even better. I can't wait to try my first aged bottle of Celebration next year."
"Mouthfeel is not too heavy, but provides enough body to carry this much deliciousness. Overall, this is one of my favorite IPAs. It presents the perfect balance of a variety of hops and truly defines what it means to be an American IPA."
"freedom throughout the galaxy...."
"EDIT: Had another bottle and all the above holds true---I did find that the brew has a touch of orange flavor---just a touch---that sits very nice in the mix. 50-55 deg is prob. an ideal temp for this beer---really shines as it warms a bit."
"The mouthfeel is medium and a bit sticky. Very good drinkability and excellent for the season, although I'd rather have it year round!"
"Overall impression: A Celebration of hoppy goodness. Easy to take for granted, but not to be missed."
"D- yes. Oh god yes. I'm going to buy a case this weekend. Only thing is, because its a bitter IPA...you can't really pound them too quick if you're looking for a day of great drinking. But this is a GREAT beer"
"12oz bottle of the 2010 version. Pours a light amber color that is somewhat translucent. Thin ring of head. Minimal lacing. Nice aroma of hops and a citrusy orange smell. Full flavor of hops. Orange as well as a nice bitter taste. Not overly heavy but a great amount of hoppy bitterness to this beer. An easy drinkable and delicious IPA that makes the winter months better."
"Overall a good IPA, but not a favorite. I probably wouldn't drink more than 3 of these in a session."
"Pours a nice golden amber color, with a 1/2 inch of creamy white head that fades fairly fast, but leaves some sticky lacing. Fresh floral hops are prevalent in the nose, along with some lemon zest, orange, even some pine. Also a bit of a toffee malt aromas. A very fresh tasting, hop forward IPA that isn't overly bitter or sweet - a very nice balance. Its quite smooth and refreshing, and very drinkable - not a hint of the nearly 7% alcohol at all. Always look forward to the fresh batch of SN Celebration as the winter months approach."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a white head. The aroma is great. I get a lot of orange and resiny hops with some bready malt mixed in. The flavor is more of the same, with a lot of bitter orange and papaya and some pine. Medium bitterness. There is a bit of bready malt in the flavor to keep things a little bit balanced, but the beer is all about the hops. Very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Excellent."
"A nice IPA, though not much to separate it from the pack IMO. A good beer just the same though."
"Smells of leafy green hops with some grapefruit and then the pine smell as it warms. You also get some sweetness from the malt in there as well. I like this IPA because you can tell they use top notch fresh California hops with some really nice roasted caramel almost cherry like malts. The mix of the two is what makes this beer one of the best IPA's out there. I kind of forget what this tasted like last year but I just remember it being really hoppy. It still has that but since I'm so used to trying IPA's now that I'm used to that sort of bitterness. To the average beer drinker this will come across as bitter. To people who always drink IPA's this will come off as bitter mixing in with that sweet flavor to create a balanced but still ending hoppy beer. It sort of reminds me of a HopDevil from Victory but I'm enjoying this one a bit more. This is definitely in my top 5 IPA's. This is my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Notes: Typically I think of IPAs reminding me of summer/heat, but this did a great job as a winter ale. Sweet malt and bitter hops pretty well balanced, but bitterness outweighs the sweetness. Reminded me of a mix of an IPA and a Red/Amber Ale. Another nice, affordable option from Sierra Nevada. Pick one up for the winter."
"Notes: this is a perfectly balanced IPA. nice, easy aromatics and taste. well rounded. nothing dominates, but then again it loses some complexity. NOT the Celebration i remember and reviewed in the past"
"D- Celebration is smooth fresh drinakable stuff. The bitterness keeps it lively and not absolutely slam dunk drinkable. Still very good!"
"Picked up a 12 pack of this years batch. I have enjoyed this beer for many years but I must say that last year and this years version are not up to par as in previous years. Not sure why but the flavors are off from what I remember. Its still good as most brews from SN but too close to some of their other offerings such as the Pale Ale and Torpedo. It just doesn't stand out like it used to. The hop bitterness is there but it seems as though they are using different flavoring hops then they used to. My friends have also noticed this. Maybe SN is getting too big and loosing touch with the importance of consistency."
"Overall: Very tasty and another success from Sierra Nevada."
"D: delicious. Really one of the best winter ales around, even if it's not technically a winter warmer. I'm interested by the contrast between the sweet fruity nose and the dry bitter taste. I can, and will, drink many more of these."
"I hadve this before and I will be having it again. This us my recommended fresh hop ale."
"Pours a brownish amber color with a nice white head and that sticky hop type of lacing. Nose brings a good dose of citrus and pine hops plus some caramel and sweet bread. Nice combination of hops and malt for the colder seasons. Drinks quite well and is a staple in our fridge every time it is available."
"Another strong SN celebration. As usual I wind up wishing they'd make it year round."
"Very good session beer, loved how it is so well balanced."
"Pretty nice, doesn't strike me as amazing but pleasant, sweet drinking."
"Bottle - Poured a cloudy amber with a huge fluffy white head which lasted throughout. Lacing was intense and lasted as well. Nose was citrus, resinous and flowery with considerable sweetness apparent. Taste is citrus, some pine, spice and balanced nicely with some nuttiness and caramel malts. Medium bodied and good carbonation, a little sticky but with not much bitterness in the aftertaste. Instead, this IPA is on the sweet side but crisp, refreshing and sessionable for sure."
"Great beer fresh, and quite good with age. Just very different."
"packs a lot of flavor and weight into and ipa, not the kind of ipa i could see me drinking more than a few of. like a mini barleywine."
"This is a spectacular brew. my favorite winter seasonal. I thought the 2008 version was a bit more maltier."
"This poured a dark orange in color out of the tap. It had some brownish notes as well. The head was puffy and very pretty. It showed retention the whole time I drained the pint glass and left some awesome lacing. The nice, sharp pine is what I first noticed in this nose. There was also some light citrus and maybe a few other hoppy notes. The healthy malt base gave this IPA a very good balance. The hop profile is very complex and reflects the scents found in the nose. The toasted malts come up slightly bigger at the taste and have a small nut compliment. As I said before, this is a very balanced brew. This one is a solid medium body"
"Don't let the label fool you, this ale is appropriate for any time of the year. Seasonal only, so store up your nuts for the summer."
"It pours a clear straight amber topped by a firm finger of cream foam. The nose comprises a nice level of citrus hops alongside a pleasant bit o' sweet caramel. The taste generally follows, but the hops, which add a bit o' pine to their repertoire here, seem to dominate the caramel, which is no longer as sweet as it once appeared. The new piney-ness lingers on through the aftertaste. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a very easygoing feel. A very solid IPA, a credit to its style."
"After looking at this label its hard to recognise that is an AIPA it gives you more of an impression of a winter warmer but anyways glad i found out it was the first,it pours a nice light cloudy bronze hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a very frothy two finger caramel laced head and sporadic sticky lacing all over the place this looks spot on for an AIPA quite impressive looking,the smell is a nice mix with aromas of citrus mainly orange and lemon and some sweet toffee malts and is quite subtle compared to other highly hoppped AIPA's but it definately gets it's point across,it has a nice mouthfeel which is just under medium bodied and nicely carbonated and very sessionable with tastes of stonefruits,some light toffee malts and finishes with a nice passionfruit tinged bitterness which stays in your mouth and for me since im a big fan of this style i reckon they got it pretty spot on and if this brew was available to me all year round abit fresher and abit cheaper it would definately have a permanent spot in my fridge."
"D- A very solid brew and easy to drink."
"d: i really enjoyed this beer this time around, very mellow sort of like a fullers vintage ale meets sierra nevada"
"D - I could probably do 2 maybe 3, but then I think I would get bored with it."
"D - This is a pretty good beer that I will buy again to try each year it comes out. I got this bottle from a Winter sampler pack on clearance and I am glad I got to try the 2009 brew."
"This is without question one of my Top 5 beers. Incredible from the first taste until the last sip rolls out of the bottle."
"Crisp and refreshing. I've seen this available in the winter for years at the local grocery store and never gave it a second look but I'll be sure to keep an eye out for it again later this year."
"A tasty IPA with big hop flavours and good malt balance. I like it."
"What amazes me is how full bodied this beer is without being too sweet, the malt masks some of the flavors from emphasis on any one of them while at the same time taking a backside role itself, something that I have never seen before in a brew with such a thick creamy delicious mouthfeel. Makes it drinkable as hell, super enjoyable and I pretty much want to such it down. There are two words I have to describe this beer, ""liquid gold," I am a huge fan of Sierra Nevada and I love this beer."
"A great overall beer that I will drink again and again."
"Well, I can say it- I like, truly like a sierra nevada beer. Their stuff has always been pretty good but this is undeniably great."
"D. Very good, although I would only drink 2 or 3 of these in a day I would think about going back for another one tomorrow."
"The taste is right on with the nose, pine hops. While I can appreciate that this is a good beer for the style, I really don't enjoy hoppy bitter beers; and thus my scores reflect that; although it is a good representation of the style."
"D - This is a very well constructed IPA, and I can see why it rates so well. This was 2009 vintage...I'm looking forward to the 2010."
"Overall, I love drinking this beer. Australian brewers, take note! This is a beautiful IPA."
"D - Quite good for a winter seasonal. Definitely a good beer to have on a cold winter evening, but this went down fine on the spring day I had it."
"Poured an almost red-amber into standard pint glass. Not much in the head department, small and quickly dissipating. Very lovely and hoppy taste. Citrus and Pine dominated with and light crisp Grass note. This beer seemed a bit heavier than the standard SN APA, and was altogether a very nice ale."
"This beer is absolutely outstanding and is something which I look forward to on an annual basis. Cracking open the first of the season subconsciously flips my mind into full-on holiday excitement mode, and the next 23 or so help me to maintain my sanity over the subsequent weeks. I've had so many great brews over the years (and in the past month, for that matter) that this may sound hyperbolic, but Celebration Ale may just be my desert island choice. Highly, fanatically recommended!"
"d - overall very good. hoppy, but not overwhelming. Im new to hoppy beers, and this was a good experience!"
"Easy drinking, with a nice bitter finish that is crisp and invites further quaffing. Although SN beers all have a bit of similarity (most of them), they are all quite tasty. This takes a second only to their Torpedo in terms of their best IPAs, and this one is pretty close to that one. I prefer the Torpedo though, as it's a bit drier and less malt focused."
"Good alcohol%, smooth taste, nice looking label to keep as a souvenir, pity I can't get it regularly here in Texas but if you have a chance to try it (especially around the holidays) please don't pass it up!"
" Reminds me of what I miss from home...Beer. Good beer and good seasonal's as well. Am impressed how well the beer has held up on a trip from the USA and just as good as I have had at an Old Chicago in Denver or Tucson or at home drinking one in December. Note: if in USA score would be lower but since in Australia and only one other beer here can compete with it (Murrays ICON) I am grading against that."
"This is so close to ideal it's scary. Huge head with the retention of something from a dream. Scads of lace and a cloudiness that says hop oils and more. A big citrusey bouquet with a light sweet pine and caramel. A bit of bread and yeasty dough. Taste has a firm grapefruit hoppiness with a caramel malt center. A fresh whole grain loaf mixes with the malt backbone and opens a door for the sweetness to flow. It gives good balance and then the finish brings the hop parade again. A lingering grapefruit skin has a touch of quinine as well but in all the finish is clean and dry. A dark grained cracker like presence hints at graham but not quite. Feel is crisp and refreshing with an effervescence that brings a light creaminess if you let it hang out in your mouth. You can easily go through a couple of 24 oz bottles like the one I have before me. This stuff is deliciously hoppy, balanced and while a little strong not a ""Big Beer"" so you can enjoy it without too much concern. I have to remember this one from now on."
"Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability was great, easily had a couple, great beer"
"Dark, orange amber with a fluffy tan head that leaves sticky rings of lace all down the glass. The nose is solid with plenty of that Sierra C-hop smell and plenty of pale and caramel malt goodness. A perfect medley of hop flavor, hop bitterness & malt sweetness. Pine sap and caramel slathered toast. Full bodied with smooth carbonation. A fantastic beer any time of the year."
"I found this to be very true to style, and will most likely be my go to beer for winter seasonals as long as its around. High drinkability and not TOO high abv make this a quaffable beer with session potential."
"As an IPA and it could be a lot more potent, but there are enough hops to satisfy ll but the most jaded hop-heads. As a Christmas seasonal brew is strikes the classic balance of mildly spicy warmer and hoppy flavor. I'll be picking these up each December for sure."
"D- Very drinkable, hop forward but well balanced. A great beer."
"The taste reflects the nose, but with the slightly roasted characteristic. Assertive hop bitterness and taste pleasantly accentuated by the perfect level of carbonation. Medium-body, and very sweet. High drinkability."
"The Celebration Ale pours an orange to amber color with a nice bubbly head atop that leaves some good lacing. Aromas are sweet with malts, toffee, and caremel. I am also picking up some meaty notes that I haven't sniffed before with this brew. Taste brings out some citrus notes and is very smooth. Not overpowering in any way. Also plenty of malts and pines. Not much hops for being an IPA. Mouthfeel is fairly thin and sort of watery. Drinkability is very high for this brew. Kind of a mixture of several different styles and with that it is truly unique. This is my session beer for the winter months."
"wow, i need to try a few more of these, (not all at once), but if i change my mind, i'll revise this. until then, sorry sierra nevada, but this one's low on my ranks for you."
"O: A solid IPA that is on the hearty side, rather than the refreshing side. Excellent for those cold winter months."
"D: Immensely drinkable, if a bit dangerous at 6.8 percent. Hops are prominent, but not in a way that overpowers other elements. Instead, the supporting parts of this brew serve to showcase the complexity, nuance, intensity, and (getting a bit hyperbolic) the glory that is Humulus Lupulus."
"I really love the American hops, but if the balance with the malt isn't right the hops then can be bit rude. This great beer has a really well-balanced mix between hops and malt - the american hops really blooms! Greatness!"
"Overall, Celebration Ale is an impressive beer from an always impressive brewery. It's a really nice IPA but the graininess for me is a bit strange for the style. I don't want to sound too harsh, though, as this is a good beer that is definitely deserving of being purchased in a six pack."
"Thoughts: All around decent. Nothing jumps out at me for this one but nothing offends either. So far the least liked Sierra Nevada brew out of Big Foot, Wheat, and Pale Ale."
"For me, this has been one of those beers that you look forward to the release of each year. Just a great winter stand-bye."
"Other: Yet another find product from Sierra Nevada with a little more kick than their traditional Pale Ale. Looking for an American style IPA??? Look no further."
"Mouthfeel is okay, nothing special, would hav eliked it a bit less creamy, and the carbonation is a tad weak."
"Mouthfeel - Medium body, creamy with carbonation that fits just perfect."
"A fantastic winter seasonal. It's not at all balanced -- very hoppy and bitter -- but it just works so well here it's hard to find fault."
"A: A smooth copper color, lots of thick rocky head with tons of lacing - 4.50, S: Nice hops on the nose, grapefruit and a touch of bubblegum, a bit of carmel and possibly some pale malt aromas - 4.25, T: Solid hop bite with pine and grapefruit pith, noticeable toffee flavors, finishes quite dry and with a bit of warming from the alcohol - 4.50, M: Medium to heavy body with a touch of creaminess - 4.25, D: A very good beer overall with a great balance of hops/malt, one I would gladly drink again - 4.25"
"D: This is a robust IPA with great balance and makes for a nice winter seasonal. These are highly drinkable, and I look forward to these every year."
"A good choice, if you are into hops."
"Celebration Ale is a solid, well-balanced IPA (a little on the sweet side, but not cloying). Would be perfect for a long Winter outing at a bar with friends."
"Considering the name and the label I was expecting a winter ale. I was surprised to find another great IPA."
"The consistency is good, smooth finish, and great taste. I feel like the ingredients are of a high quality and you can taste it."
"D - An excellent ale that almost seems like an IPA at times. A must try and winter time staple."
"This beer has a beautiful golden amber color. This is not what I expected from a winter seasonal. This is in fact an IPA. It has an aroma of cascade hops. There is only slight head retention and lacing. It is malty to start and finishes bitter. The bitterness lingers and gets stronger. This is a very drinkable but very flavorful beer."
"Drinkability- I would have to say overall i reallly liked this beer, the hops are strong but not so overwhelming as to hurt its ability to make a nice yet slightly strong session beer, one I certainly will seek out again when craving that bitter hop style beer that they do so well a winner"
"I'm a big fan of this one. It somehow operates as a holiday ale and an IPA at the same time. It drinks well and is very satisfying. Unless you hate poinsettias..."
"Drinkable and enjoyable. Unbalanced as hell, but tasty if hops are what you're looking for."
"D - Quite good. It was nice to have a different ""go-to"" beer, albeit for a relatively short amount of time."
"Notes: 2009 vintage."
"D: Good drink ability for a full flavored ale. Not to heavy on the palate."
"D. This is a highly drinkable beer for the well evolved palate, particulary if you are an ipa enthusiast. I can easily consume a sixer without hesitation or effort."
"The mouthfeel is a little creamy but then goes down watery. This is a nice brew to drink a lot of. The price you can't beat for the quality. I feel that this is a cross between an IPA and a Winter Warmer. I just wish it were a little hoppier."
"Drinkability: I could easily put a few of these away on one session, but I don't plan on it. The thickness of this beer would start to be noticed after a couple. I could see the 6.8 ABV creeping up on me as well."
"I really enjoyed this beer. The creamy flavor and bread-like quality were a pleasant surprise and not something you typically see with an ale of this variety. It was like an IPA wrapped in a comfy Christmas sweater, sitting by the fire."
"M+D: Very drinkable, with a pleasant thing mouth feel. Not too thin. Not quite a session beer, but several of these could be enjoyed in one evening."
"D: Eh, this was about as average an IPA as you can get, if you ask me. I wouldn't drink another one of these."
"Enjoying this with some blocks of aged sharp cheese, absolutely awesome."
"Overall- One heck of a beer and the piney/spicy notes really do help make this a delicious beer to enjoy during the winter season- though, I have to admit that I would probably love this any time of the year! Very tasty. Very Sierra Nevada!"
"It has just the right amount of carbonation to make this go down easily. Spent many a winter night watching TV and quaffing a number of these down. This is what I take when I go to winter holiday parties."
"Overall, an excellent AIPA that I'm glad I finally tried. For some reason, I kept thinking this was a winter warmer which I generally try to avoid these days. Highly recommend. Rotation - winter seasonal avail here in TX. Couple 6 packs per season."
"Drinkability - Wow easy to drink but sneaks up behind you and stabs you. just like their torpedo this IPA is absolutly nothing far from amazing to me. I hate winter but when the celebration ale is gone im always dreaming of a snowy night..."
"D- This beer is great! Excellent flavor and texture and it only costs two bucks in the Phish lot. It's worth getting a bunch and stretching them out until next Christmas."
"D- not too harsh, but didn't scream out ""gimme more"""
"Pours a little darker than most IPAs. Decent head and lots of lacing. Smell is a little weak as I don't notice a lot of hops in the nose. A more balanced smell. The taste is very bitter from the hops and I get a lemony goodness. Tastes really good! Light and refreshing but at the same time gives that malty, earthy backbone underneath it all. Mouthfeel has lots of carbonation and tickles the tongue. Drinkability is great due to the refreshing qualities of the beer. Very enjoyable seasonal beer and one I will definitely look for again during the holiday season."
"D-I can easily knock back a few of these at the end of the night. SA makes the holidays special !!"
"D- Good, I guess. I easily drank the entire beer and could definitely drink another one. This is a very solid IPA and a good example of the style. The tea-like qualities were very pleasing and a change from the normal citrusy IPA's I've been having."
"The taste is by the book. It has a nice balance between slight leafy bitterness, floral hop, some grapefruit acerbic citrus notes in the hop, and nice malty backbone, some drying hop elements, some nice graininess in there too. This is a very traditional interpretation of an AIPA, but it doesn't have the exceptional orangey hop burst, or the ripe oily and estery hop presence dripping from the vine, it doesn't make a grand statement. It is traditional, good, solid, but I wouldn't rate this as exceptional, just very good for the style. In some ways the beer is just too clean, too conformist, too by the book. It seems that other brewers of AIPA styles are a bit more inventive and more aggressive in their interpretation and have passed SN by somewhere along the line."
"D- Definitely a beer I would have many of. Its a beer I wouldn't mind bringing to a party to share or to just have for myself. As a regular IPA goes, this is definitely a winner in my book."
"The beer comes across the palate with a well balanced amount of hops and malt with the bitterness crashing on the tongue as you swallow and lingering upon it... There were also notes of pine which I perceived further along into the drink. The beer was well carbonated and coated the mouth with its tasty goodness. I am saddened this was my only bottle."
"Overall: not as good as last year's Celebration, but always a nice, 'milder' alternative IPA, especially for people who aren't that big on hops (though I am)"
"D- This is one of those beers that everyone should try. I could quickly put away at least a 6 in one sitting because the taste is just that good! If anyone says: ""I don't like the beer you drink!"" give them this beer (obviously you will have to wait until it's in season)."
"Color is nice and golden copper with fine head retention a good lacing. Smell is mostly cascade hops with some sweetness in the background. Taste hits with a lot of bitterness and a strong citrus/piney hop flavors. This is held up with some very nice caramel toffee notes in the malt background. The more I sip, the more I get the malt sweetness, especially in the finish. Medium body and very drinkable. Yet another great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"A very beautiful beer with a tremendous white head and medium amber color. Initially sweet but the hops kick in right away with a beautiful medium bitterness that lingers for a long time. Very smooth in your mouth. Creamy for an ale this hoppy. Very drinkable. After trying a bottle that my brother gave me, I bought a 12-pack. I look forward to one almost every day now. It doesn't grow old. Excellent"
"M/D: The beer has a medium to full feeling to it, almost chewy, well carbonated, rich, smooth and extremely easy to drink. I drank the first one before I knew it. Certainly one of the best beers that I have had."
"The 2010 batch seems more earthy than last years batch...pine and citrus with grassy notes, something a bit metallic...still a great beer for the money, I will be consuming a lot of these over the next month or two!"
"Appearance 4, Smell 3, Taste 3.5, Mouthfeel 3, Drinkability 3.5, Score 3.45"
"Drinkability: Very tasty and thirst quenching."
"Simply perfect."
"Always a pleasure drinking one of these, this is one of my many regular purchases, and will continue to be."
"Overall, Sierra Nevada does it again. I often take them for granted, since they are so ubiquitous, but they truly are one of the best, most consistent breweries out there, especially for a hophead like me."
"Overall, one of my favorite holiday beers I had this year, and something I will probably get for years to come."
"This one has very strong flavors typical of a holiday brew, but they are totally overwhelmed by the bitter hop flavor and smell with little to no spice or malt flavors. This made it not so enjoyable to me as I wasn't expecting. About half way through my palate was numb enough to enjoy the remainder without wincing."
"Appearance is a nice copper to amber body with a white head that sits well and sticks to the glass like a dusting of snow. The aroma is pungent grapefruit along with a caramel breadiness that pairs well with the bitterness of it. The flavor matches the aroma with a bitterness sticking to the tongue. With warmth, the bitterness subsides a bit as more residual sugars are allowed to display the caramel malt used in this brew. The mouthfeel is fuller without being heavy. For drinkability this one is no session IPA, but a sipper."
"All in a a fully enjoyable experience."
"Great drinkability. Tastes like a combination of an American IPA, and a winter warmer. Another great job by Sierra Nevada."
"D: Overall, this was a well crafted beer. The beer was easy to drink like Sierra Nevada's pale ale, but it had a little extra character because of the bitter aftertaste. Since the bitterness was not too strong, I think this would be a good beer for introducing someone to the aromas and flavors of hops in beer. Also, this beer would be good with or without food. I'm glad I bought a six-pack of Celebration Ale and not just a single. :)"
"D - This is a delicious, hoppy ale that is a welcome change of pace from other winter seasonals."
"Nothing particularly outstanding about this beer but it's a flawless archetype of an American IPA in it's own right. So says I."
"while atypical for the style of a winter / holiday brew, this is a welcome departure from some of the spicier beers we find throughout the fall, winter, and into spring."
"Final Thought: This is a great IPA from one of the big 3 in the micro-brew industry, fantastic!"
"(bottle into pint glass) Pours a beautiful amber color with a foamy white head that lasted almost the entire glass, falling from about one finger to a half with strong lacing. The nose was of the bitter hops with a hint of citrus. Like other Sierra Nevada brews, the bitterness of the hops dominates at first, but does mellow into a crisp finish. Once a year is perfectly fine for this one, I am not a huge fan, but do enjoy that, unlike other winter seasonals, the sweetness does not dominate, giving a nice break."
"Look forward to this Ale every season. It is one of those staples that is very easy to drink and very good on your palete. This one is highly recommended. Has the perfect holiday season taste. Always bummed when I can no longer find it around. That is why I buy cases of this stuff."
"Very frothy head - I received a six pack as a gift and actually did not know the style of beer it was before I poured my first glass. A pleasant surprise the frothy head, nice burnt-orange/brown hue and thick, toasty mouthfeel of a upper-echelon brewpub IPA! Reputation of SN's regular American Pale Ale precedes the brewery, of course, but this one did not disappoint. I don't normally think of the style as a Wintery style of beer, but it was sure welcome this holiday season."
"Pours a slightly hazy orangish/amber color with a huge off white fluffy head. Sticky lacing from the head coats the entire inside of the glass, and last all the way to the end. Smell is lots of sweet citrusy, slightly piny hops, and caramel. Taste is citrusy hops with a caramel malt backbone, and ending with a nice hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation. Overall this is another very good IPA from SN."
"Happy New Year!"
"D - I find it very easy to finish a bottle of this beer but would question whether I'd have a second in one sitting. It's very enjoyable, but the sour taste wears on me a bit and leaves me wanting me to spread these out a bit over the Christmas season. But I still by a six pack of this every year when it hits stores."
"D: A sessionable IPA that is widely available. Not one of my favorites, but a solid offering from SN nonetheless. I'm happy to drink a few around the holidays."
"CHEERS!!"
"Carbonation is high, which is no surprise. The big, sweet body and creamy feel from the head contribute to accentuate the malt character, which has some nice, light sweetness to it. Maybe it's because of the interaction with the hops, but it has a red candy flavor to it. The hops taste dark and herbal and contribute a very strong, blunt, bitter finish that lingers. This is a nice big IPA. It's a good thing to have in the fridge for one or two pours, but I wouldn't make a session of this beer."
"D: The high bitterness would prevent me from drinking this beer all night, but it's so hoppy and aromatic that I would WANT to drink more if I could. A damned fine beer!"
"Had I known at the time of purchase that this beer was this good, I would have picked up a case or seven."
"Drinkability - Definitely have been enjoying this year's version of Celebration and will look for it again next year."
"It's too bad this beer is a seasonal, I'd drink it year around without a doubt."
"Not really up my alley but a good holiday IPA."
"love when this one comes out. this beer is for the people that want a 'hoppy' holiday. sure i enjoy cinnamon, caramel, and other flavors associated with the winter season, but this one is 100% sierra nevada. bold, citrus hop flavors. woo! this one pours a beautiful brass copper with a finger of off white. want to take a picture of it and put it in my wallet. have a hoppy new year!"
"A tasty bear that I look forward to every Christmas season. The alcohol is well-hidden. Easy to drink that isn't filling. This was the perfect beer to sip on Christmas Eve."
"Decent holiday beer, nothing special though. Very similar to the pale ale in appearance and mouthfeel. A lot more clove, cinnamon, and all-spice notes in the smell and taste. Would probably go well with pumpkin or sweet potato pie. It's a decent beer reminicent of the holidays, but not one that I would crave or necessarily want again."
"-pretty darn good beer, better than i remember it being for sure. not really an holidayness to it, but a good/drinkable beer indeed"
"D- Goes down easily. The grapefruit rind flavors are big, but never seem to become overpowering. Drinkable indeed."
"Pours a pleasing orangy amber color, fairly clear with only light haze. Rocky white head, great retention and lacing. Smell is strong of piney, earthy and spicy hops. Faint kiss of floral and citrus plus a hint towards a nice malt presence. Taste is a big punch of piney, earthy hops - very cologne like, which is a slight turn off - faint floral and citrusy hops noted right before a slight malty backbone presents itelf. Finishes very bitter and dry with a noticible aftertaste. Not in my wheelhouse as far as IPAs go, had higher hopes for this but the hop profile just turns me off from full enjoyment. Still i respect this as an IPA."
"Pours a dark amber with two finger so of head into a normal pint glass. Lots of lacing left over. The smell is a ton of flowery hops that smell absolutely heavenly. The last celebration I had was over six months old and was very tasty, but nothing like this. As hoppy as any IPA I could want, but with some malty backboneto follow it up, this is an absolutely fantastic beer all around. Maybe not the best beer for someone who is not a hop fan, and definitely not the samew type of winter seasonal we get in the midwest. This is fantastic and always worth it."
"this is the one of the best american ipa i have had so far ."
"Another great one from SN. At this point I will say I like this one nearly as much as the rest of the APA/IPA from SN but this is back of the line. When I say back of the line I mean a fraction of a fraction of a fraction. Smaller than the stuff that comes out of an atom. You get the point."
"I LOVE this beer - it is the standard against which other IPAs should be judged. Another winner from Sierra Nevada."
"The aroma is hoppy and bitter. Flavor is a typical IPA, plenty of hop bitterness, some malt backbone. Hop flavor is more pine than citrus, and crisp and clean. Carbonation is high and refreshing. Easy drinking for IPA lovers."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Cloudy burnt orange color with around an inch of head. Smells mostly of oranges and pine needles. Taste is bitter but mellow, loads of orange and lemon. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Refreshing and tasty, this is a great sessionable IPA."
"It's a pretty light amber color with plenty of fizz. It's got a notable hop taste but it isn't overbearing. there is a slight citrus scent on top. It goes down with a bit of sting but doesn't offend the tongue much at all. It's a nice change up from all the stouts and porters typical of Christmas time."
"A great IPA, significant hops, and very drinkable."
"I'm having the 12 pack for myself and I am liking it more with each sip. Very high drinkabikity."
"I've tried this beer on tap about a year ago, but i had to try it again because i forgot how it taste. the reviews from here were good, so i decided to buy two six packs for me and some friends. I knew it was another ipa or pale ale, i wasn't ignorant at all by the marketing scheme of a special spiced winter warmer and all the holiday decorations on the label. but alltogether its average, it might just be torpedo in sheeps clothing."
"This was a very tasty beer, it sort of felt like it would be very filling at first, but eventually became more smooth and easier to drink ."
"overall this is a great beer. this is the first winter seasonal i've ever had that was an IPA, so i guess thats nice for a change."
"This beer is for the hop lover. There is more complexity in the hop characteristics and olfactory sense than in the malt profile, which results in a surprisingly light yet complex experience. I can't imagine aging it and letting go any of the fresh hop character."
"Highly recommend."
"Drinkability is high. I often enjoy more than one of these at a time... a great session brew. SNCA 09 is, as expected, excellent."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I bought a six pack of this beer and have cellared four of them. I plan to try one in six months, then hopefully break out the others for a little gift next Christmas."
"A quite good IPA, one of SNs best beers."
"drinkablity= dont know how to judge it being I have had 7-8 already. for someone who cant handle deep harty beers dont waste your time on a 12 pack, try a 6r for starters, for the MEN who know what they like ""A-"" great beer!!!!"
"D: Not even a question, end of interview."
"My favorite session beer - guess it depends on defintion of session."
"D: A very good and very approachable IPA. I look forward to drinking more of these."
"D: One bottle will inevitably call for another."
"D: A darn fine beer as usual from SN. Definitely one of the best (especially for the price) IPAs out there, and I look forward to this beer every year."
"Drinkability- Easily a session beer."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer that I always wait around for. Nice IPA with a Sierra Nevada twist to it."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle intp chilled pint glass. Pours a copper burnt-orange color 1/4 inch off-white stayed all the way to the bottom of the glass. Citrus and pine notes. Nice hop bite, bitter grapefruit and pine. Retains a generous malt balance. Nice winter warmth."
"Drinkability - No problem having a few of these, that's for sure. I believe my 12, 12 packs shows my love for Celebration. All around awesome American IPA, that I can't wait for it to show up next year. Definitely a beer that I look forward to every season."
"Pours a hazy orange with some sediment floating around, kind of weird soapy head. All I can pick up for smells is a little hoppiness. Taste is great, very hoppy with tastes of grassy citrus, pine and a slightly bready aftertaste. Citrus definitely starts to show through more towards the end. A little bitter but not overly so. A little more carbonation than what I prefer. Drinkability is the highlight though, easy to drink and session, very good for the price, and tastes great. I will be buying this for hopefully many winters to come."
"D: I really enjoyed this beer. This is the first time I have had the chance to have it here in Alabama, and I am more than please. So easily drinkable. Not the most complex beer but the flavors are very well crafted in my opinion. I would be more than happy to see this beer as a year around because it is so easy drinking and pleasing. Dig on it."
"Drinkability is a high for an IPA. Bitter for sure, but not to heavy or high ABV for an IPA so it makes it addictively sessionable. Suprassed my expectations for sure!"
"Dang, three finger head on that second pour. I'm poppin' up the appearance rating. Beautiful brew."
"Deep amber, well-laced white head from which a good part never disappears. Rich citrus (grapefruit) aroma with notes reminiscent of the Christmas tree (piney, resinous, herbal). Good hop character, finish is moderately bitter, just hoppy enough I found. Medium body, good balance. just a hint of caramel malt. And for years I thought this was a Christmas ale...Idiot. The label has been tricking me."
"Drinkabilith is average. Goes down like another mediocre Sierra Nevada offering."
"D - Pretty high. While its not the venerated SN Pale Ale this is a close second. A little less of a drinking beer due to the heavy malt and chewy mouthfeel but a great beer for the holidays and wonderful with meals. I LOVE finding this at lame Xmas parties trying to vie me with peppermint schnapps and candy martinis."
"D - Would tire of the astringency."
"I'm somewhat disappointed with SN's Celebration Ale as I found it overall to be too unbalanced. I remember really enjoying it a few years ago. I think that bottle might have had a year of age on it, which could really cut down on the bitterness factor. I think I might pick another bottle up and see how it ages for myself. Especially since a lot of people think this is a solid IPA for cellaring."
"Mouthfeel is moderate, with appropriate carbonation. Drinkability is good. An excellent beer, as usual."
"A good beer! I think that it reminded me alot of SA ""torpedo. Its a a good beer to spread the holiday cheer!"
"D - This is a fantastic beer with lots of flavor."
"D: high, could have a couple without blinking, but i fancy the hops."
"Pours a light coppery color with a thin white head. leaves some lacing. Smells like an IPA should. Nice and hoppy. citrus notes mostly, with a bit of floral as well. The hops hit esspecially hard on the taste, before mellowing out with a bit of a malt sweetness on the finish. The high-ish ABV and the heavy hops flavor keep it from being easily drinkable, but for a hop-head like myself, it is very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Went down like a champ. Certainly a beer that begs to have more than one of. The ABV is sneaky thought, and approaching DIPA territory and yet no real sign of the alcohol til after the fact due to the flavors working so well. A tough beer to rate, actually, as the flavors are more mild than some IPAs, but they work so well together that you can't help but admire it. Recommended, like all 2,000 other reviews seem to."
"O: Not my favorite SN (that one's still the Anniversary Ale) but I have no complaints AT ALL here. I suggest letting it warm up somewhat in order to unleash its full profile. Drink it too cold and you'll miss out on a lot. Excellent on its own; finicky with food (all that dry-hopping, perhaps?), but try spicy Senegalese peanut (curry) soup, or earthy cheeses."
"D - I bought a 6 pack, so I definitely plan on having another tonight."
"Celebration is definitely my favorite of the Sierra Nevada IPA offerings. Well rounded and above average in every area. Drinks very easily. Great IPA to enjoy as the snow starts to fall."
"Just enough spice in the malts to make it a holiday beer. Manages to be quite distinct from both Anniversary and Torpedo. Fruity, tasty IPA."
"Another winner from Sierra Nevada. I either love them because I'm from the Sierra Nevadas or because they brew such excellent ale, or both. Even the 6.8 abv wouldn't keep me from drinking three to six in a sitting. Very much like the harvest wet hop. 4"
"D) High! Tasty and different for a winter seasonal. I enjoy IPAs and could have several of these."
"Slightly dark orange/amber. Pretty cloudy. Big white head with lots of lacing. Lots of grapefruit and pine in the smell and taste. This is kind a tweener in the middle of their Pale Ale and Torpedo. There's a hint of caramel on the back end, but this is all about the hops. It's not intensely hoppy, just a nice steady dose. I tried in vain to detect any spices. I'd like to see this offered year round."
"Notes: This is my first Sierra Nevada and it is awesome. I have been getting bogged down by spiced and sweet winter ales, and this is exactly what I needed, a blast of hops in a Christmas wrapper. I can't wait to try their other beers."
"D: This is a great ipa, but I couldn't imagine drinking this all too frequently with those overwhelming hops. Great beer, just drink in moderation."
"D - A pure classic American IPA. Nothing too complex. A Christmas staple."
"A very solid offering from Sierra Nevada. Recommend!"
"Definitely has some caramel & pine notes to it. Not overly hoppy. Simply a nice, pleasant drinking beer to savor."
"D= very drinkable if you're an IPA fan who appreciates the inclusion of bold malts."
"Nice red/orange color. Huge hop aroma. Great piney hop taste with ample bitterness. Such a great beer that I look forward to every fall/winter. Its pretty much my favorite thing about the season. I love this beer. I remember the first time I ever had it, way back as a real newbie to craft beer and hops and thought it tasted like what I imagined was drinking liquid christmas tree. Kind of comical looking back on it but really, this is a fantastic winter beer and overall, just a fine IPA."
"Too unbalanced to make the drinkability level high, but still decent."
"Overall, a hophead seasonal for sure. Good alpha acid fix."
"This beer is rather sessionable, although on the bitter side."
"I'm a fan of sierra in general, but really like their seasonals too, like the anniversary ipa and this celebration ale. I wish they'd sell these two year round, but I like their regular pale ale also. This isn't the hoppiest ipa around, but its nice and balanced and a little thicker feeling than the anniversary ipa. I'd definitely buy it again."
"D: Nicely blended and well balanced, not too filling and a highly sessionable beer."
"Its a good drinker."
"Very nice drinkability, perfect beer for a hop lovers holidays."
"The mouthfeel is rich and full. At first I thought I could only drink 1 or 2 of these but this is going down easier than I thought. Anybody who loves hops must find this ale in their fridge during the holidays."
"d- really terrific drinkability here, now i see all the hype. glad i've got some more of these cooling in the fridge waiting for me. this stuff is downright delicious, this is my new favorite winter seasonal."
"Drinkability is great. I drove to the bar tonight so I couldn't have more than one. It had enough body, depth and complexity to nurse for a long time without it getting old. However, were it a different scenario, I'd have no problem putting back many, many, many more of these with pleasure."
"09 edition. And so I add mine to the plethora of opinions on this one, as if it were not already established that this is a great beer. I enter this exercise with a profound bias, this is one of my favorites. Pours clear copper, active, 1 finger white head, great retention and thick lacing. SMELL gets better as it warms, but starts with a strong blast of west coast hops. Caramel maltyness becomes more prominent as it warms. Has legs. TASTE is hop forward, but again, as it warms, becomes much more balanced and smooth. Malty sweetness balances the floral and citrusy hop flavors and the fairly sharp bitterness, which is more prominent toward the finish and then lingers. Some booze is noticeable as well. FEEL rich, rull, viscous, some alcholic warming, dry bitter finish. OVERALL, this is a classic west coast IPA, and one that is very well done. Easy drinking, even sessionable, if you like the style."
"a pretty orange american ipa with quite a sticky white head. nose is orange, tangerine. palate is quite nice and well balance with a nice resin hemp oil hoppy quality. quite nice and sweet citrus and rather bright summer hop. a bit of honey sweet malt finish... a bit of lemon zest. nicely balance. great beer from sierra nevada."
"Sierra Celebration pours a medium amber color, is semi foggy with a long lasting frothy head. The aroma is light airy and hoppy. The taste it a little sweet, but has a nice crisp hoppiness to it. The overall mouthfeel is fine being a creamy, smooth, medium bodied beer. This is a pretty good beer that i could drink again and again."
"a great winter ale bitter and smooth over all freshing i would pick up anothor six pack of this ale again before it's gone for the year."
"Sierra Nevada's Seasonals are top notch!"
"Give yourself a Christmas gift and pick up some from this great Chico CA brewery!"
"Drinkability: for a beer of this ABV and style, it is quite drinkable. The flavors are big but not overwhelming; the balance of ingredients keeps the beer from getting too boring. The ABV also makes me feel a little better about it being 22 degrees outside."
"D: You can totally pound this one. Very drinkable."
"Not your typical christmas beer but awesome nonetheless."
"This is one of the all time great winter seasonals. I've had it on tap and in the bottle in multiple years, and every time it packs the same delightfully spiced hoppy flavor into every mouthful! I look forward to winter every year if only for this beer starting to appear in every local bar and grocery store. It pours out a smooth and dark golden brown, and packs a nice punch of wet hops and winter spices. It drinks as smoothly as it pours, and it goes down smoothly enough to sneak in as a session beer (although at 6.8% abv I wouldn't recommend it). All in all, one of America's best beers!"
"drinkability - great beer yet this years is just not as good"
"D: Great warmer from the cold weather. The freshness from the on-tap version is really nice."
"thus would make it a brew oh so nice."
"Happy Holidays!!!"
"Sierra Nevada never fails to impress me. This is another example of a finely crafted beer and a great offering. I just wish it was offered year round."
"D- The body of this beer may deter me from drinking as much as I would a lighter IPA, but the taste is enjoyable."
"overall - i love this beer, since i first tried it last season, it has been one of my top five not just seasonal, but all time beers... its like an IPA at first but with a excellent balance, lots of hops there, but they dont overwhelm... like i said this is a perfect sippin beer for a cool evening, just relaxing around the holidays... i plan to pair this with a steak later, which i expect will go very well"
"d- decent beer to drink. not outrageous, but not ordinary. a little much for malt lovers like me, but very drinkable pale ale"
"Drinkability: This is a really nice IPA. I always look forward to it. My favorite IPAs tend to be those with juicier, sweet citrus hops more so than the piney ones, but that's personal preference. Great beer- bet you can't drink just one."
"Cheers!!!"
"D - This beer is extremely drinkable. A great wintertime treat. Alcohol not noticeable, and I could drinker a sixer of these no problem. Would probably sneak up on me."
"This is one of the better seasonals I've had this year. I'm not fond of the big alcohol presence - none of that here. Another solid beer from SN."
"Drinkability: Very versatile and easy to drink--at 6.8%, surprisingly so. Glad I picked up a six-pack--but there will be none left to age :("
"I poured this into a Flying Fish pint glass. Appearance is an deep amber color with white head and some lacing. The smell is that of your average IPA, but when it reaches your palate, it tends to be more of a burnt sugar mixed with hops taste with a slight bit of roastiness. It is a dry beer with a smooth finish, and this is a very drinkable beer, though I wouldn't have it with my holiday meals"
"Drinkability> Not as good as Celebration last year nor the AMAZING 2007, but still great."
"D-The drinkability is ridiculous on this beer despite the higher than norm abv. Had several of these over the course of a night at a friends place and ended up walking home. Totally snuck up on me."
"Great brew, really complex. I had a really hard time putting my finger on all its components."
"A very nice, full mouth feel, leaves a slick feel to the mouth, carbonation feels just right. A wonderful winter seasonal."
"Overall a good beer, and a treat for the holidays."
"drinkability: A solid session IPA that displays a very delicious hop aroma and taste, along with a little sweetness to carry the hop flavors forward. This is the kind of beer that I've come to expect with Sierra Nevada regular and seasonal offerings: solid, true to style beers that are sure to please but perhaps not to amaze and astound (although I've yet to try Bigfoot)."
"This really is a nice little beer. It's a nice change from the malt-heavy winter beers most breweries put out. One of my favorite SN offerings."
"This is a masterfully brewed beer."
"Overall: The mouth feel is astringent, slightly carbonated, and coating. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is full. The beer taste like it has simcoe hops. There is an edgy aggressive pine flavor that is similar to simcoe. It is a super IPA for a hop head."
"Purchased from Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN. This is the 2006 vintage, tasted 11/28/09. Pours a light copper body with a rocky golden-white head. Aroma is lightly toasted malt and grassy hops. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with spicy malt flavors and sticky, teeth coating hops that produce a long finish that eventually dries out your mouth. I can only imagine how bright the hop flavors might have been from a fresh bottle, but the flavors held up well over 3 years."
"D - insanely drinkable - alcohol is well hidden and this just goes down smoothly"
"Taste is similar, light with grapefruit up front on the first sip, but soon fading into the balanced, complex mix of orange, pine, spicey leafiness, light toastiness, raisiny grain, and caramel underneath. It is overall very juicy, spicey, and aromatic, with alcohol just adding a warm fullness. It has balanced bitterness and sweetness, with lingering, faintly bitter spiciness. The feel is soft and full but light and not quite oily. It is excellent, complex, just assertive enough while still being restrained and balanced, and very drinkable."
"D - Rate this a 5? Well let me tell you This one is a must buy and have every year and you can not say that with every beer (perhahps) but with this one there is no doubt given the availabilty and affordability."
"12oz. bottle (2009 vintage) served in a standard pint glass. Poured a hazy amber with a dense, two-inch, off-white head with excellent retention - this is a beautiful beer to behold. Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with thick, semi-concentric bands of lacing forming as the brew recedes. Mild nose - a hint of citrus and some floral hops aromas. Aromas translate to the flavor profile; however a malty character comes out to form the backbone, before finally culminating in a lightly lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a background carbonation that falls just shy of prickly. Sierra Nevada is definitely a workhorse brewery - I'm rarely disappointed with anything I buy from them, and Celebration is no different. A nice example of the style; however, definitely gravitating towards the more bitter end of the spectrum."
"D: The beer is strong, but delicious. Can't have too many as the strong hop does sort of kill the taste buds after a while."
"The winter imagery on the bottle suggest more of a porter to me than an IPA, but if you're looking for a winter seasonal IPA this beer is worth checking out."
"Drinkability is off the charts. I could drink this non stop until Zelaya is re-elected in Honduras."
"Another job well done by SN. These guys don't do anything badly."
"Summary: If I am ever in the mood for a hoppy beer I will probably have to go with this one again."
"It's a pretty nice beer, all things considered, and once again, Sierra Nevada come up with an interesting beer, thoroughly reminiscent of California (to me, at least). I wish it had more body and substance, and more sweetness on the palate, but it's very drinkable as it stands."
"Poured from a bomber dated 2009 into a large snifter. Foamy, frothy head that disappeared quickly. Left sticky lacing on the glass. Copper, amber color that is very appealing. Pine, grapefruit scent in the nose very aromatic. Taste also hoppy, perhaps cascade hops. I think the hops might be more mellowed than other years. But still none the less a very drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and sticky a bit oily. I really enjoyed it as it has warmed and the alcohol has warmed me. It paired very well with some BBQ pulled pork sandwiches today."
"D: This is a great beer, one I look forward to every year for a change of pace. SN doesn't make a bad beer, this one comes across as a ""little more", a good way to celebrate. Highly recommended."
"Overall Impression - The is a good IPA. I can immagine that this would be great pared with some good Italian. The hops would cut right through. This beer is on the verge of just being an assulting hop bomb, but there is some malt and flavor to save it. It's not my favorite IPA, but it's worth buy each year. Try it if you haven't."
"This is a holiday classic. Seems a little diluted now, but back in the day, retailers would load up and hoard this stuff for months, now it's everywhere, but still solid. This is the bigger tougher brother of the pale ale, but still has that hoppy, citrusy taste that the pale ale offers. Very drinkable and balanced, a must have october to february."
"D - Fairly easy to drink, but unless I'm in a real hops type of mood is hard to put down more than one of."
"D: Great winter Ale!!! This is the best in the Sierra Nevada Seasonal line up. Buy a few cases to hold for next year."
"I haven't always been a big fan of Sierra Nevada, but this version of Celebration is solid. Particularly fun to smell."
"I could drink these beer all day, every day. I think we bought 5 cases of it from Costco this year."
"Pours a dark Amber colour with a white head that leaves a nice lacing. Hop smell is imminent immediately, the grapefruit and pine being at the forefront of the nose, with a bit of lemon and orange also finding their way in there. Tastes incredibly bitter at first, but the citrus and the hops subside quickly to create a very interesting flavour. The carbonation is a bit strong, but the taste is still quite pleasant. Sierra Nevada is one of the best breweries out there, while they don't make the best beers, they do make the best that you can easily find in your local market (around here at least). This is the perfect example of that, are there better IPA's? Sure. Are there better ""holiday"" themed beers? Sure. However, this is a quality brew that is not to be missed by anyone who calls themselves a beer-lover"
"always a pleasure! i look forward to this every year and for good reason. one of the easiest drinking beers ever despite the intense bitterness. it appears to me though, that this years is less bitter and spicy with stronger malts."
"Just outstanding. Pours a rich amber with solid head and gorgeous lacing. Great nose, pine resin and grapefruit. Exceptionally balanced malt sweetness with the hop overload. Sticky sticky dank mouthfeel - can't get enough. Careful with these, don't want to go through a sixer on your own."
"enjoy in moderation"
"D - A great cold weather IPA. Drink up!"
"D: The first bottle wasn't what I would call a sipper, but it definitely wasn't a guzzler either. I had to pause a bit between swallows. The drinkability improved with the second bottle."
"I decided to give this beer a try along with their Celebration Ale. This selection is a lot more comparable with the Sierra Nevada regular rotation beers I have had. I like this beer and would certainly get it again. I guess I should hurry up before its all gone."
"Drink up, your six-packs not going to last long, mise well buy a case."
"This one is fairly drinkable. Very refreshing."
"I will never, ever, ever get sick of drinking this beer. Never. And at about 6%, I'll never have to."
"D: This is way too good for guzzling - smooth is not what it was trying for - but it's a really great beer and I would defintiely have another."
"12oz bottle on my 1st year at the store. Love SN cele each year, this one was no exception. Pours a nice dark golden hue with a thin white head, plenty of bubbles. Some soft notes of carmel and hops in the nose, its not overbearing. Loads of hops in the mid to finish with a sweeter malty intro. Finishes crisp with a little citrus. Solid effort once again, I'd actually like to see where this one goes in a year."
"D. With the bitterness and the high alcohol it is not the best beer to have in a kegerator, but it sure is tasty. 165 will be tough to finish but I will definatly give it my best shot."
"D: A bit hoppy for a typical winter beer but the warming quality of the alcohol does make up for it; this is a bit high in the alcohol to be a session beer but it's close; very drinkable and very delicious"
"D: Enjoyable and not too harsh, practically sessionable."
"Tastes great with a great aftertaste! At 6.8 percent I would definitely enjoy this again!"
"Drinkability:I can definitely say i enjoyed this brew thoroughly. Plenty of balance with quite a bit going on. Nothing cloying which would make this thing very easy to enjoy regularly. This brew really sweetened as it warmed. As usual from SN a very affordable enjoyable brew."
"O: Always look forward to this during the holidays. Spicy food, pizza, and pasta are a great match."
"In the end, this is the first time I've had the beer. And while I've enjoyed it thoroughly, I didn't quite get enough ""holiday"" out of this beer if you know what I mean. To me a winter beer means a dearth of hops and an abundance of roasty malts with some spices. Sierra Nevada takes that notion and turns it on its head. You know what? I don't mind that one bit."
"Delicious IPA. I look forward to this one every year. Excellent seasonal brew."
"D: See mouthfeel. This is an easy ale to drink and pairs especially well with holiday-themed meals. I think its a fantastic way to introduce folks to good beer, just bring a sixer to your next holiday party. Its also the best beer available at my local 7-11, which means you can pick it up anywhere. It is damn near ubiquitous in the Northern Virginia, DC suburban grocery and convenient stores (despite this, I haven;t come across it on tap yet ... but to be honest, I haven't looked that hard)."
"D-it goes down easy but the flavors are a little mild. I'd like to see more and expected as much from all of the previous reviews."
"A big, foamy tan head sits atop a cloudy orange-amber liquid. The aroma is filled with hops, with a piney, earthy, and slightly spicy character. The flavor also introduces a nice citrus bite, and a toffee malt sweetness brings a nice balance. The hop bitterness builds a bit as I drink, but this one is certainly not a big, bad hop bomb. It does have a great, complex flavor and is easier to drink than many IPAs. Overall, this drinks like an amplified version of the Pale Ale and is a welcome addition to the Sierra Nevada lineup every fall. I will gladly pick it up again."
"D: There is a reason this brew gets the attention that it does. This is one of America's greatest IPAs. Although it is available nationwide, it is only offered for the holiday season. Get it while you can!"
"The beer is medium bodied, balanced enough to be very drinkable and hoppy enough to be intriguing. This is another triumph for the Sierra Nevada portfolio, I love their hoppy beers."
"I don't know why I don't just buy multiple CASES of this beer every year. Another triumph for the crew in Chico!"
"I'm usually quite skeptical whenever a beer gets the hype that Celebration does, but I was not disappointed in the least. If anything, I think it may actually be underrated. Really enjoyed this brew. Quite a fortuitous coincidence that this rang in as my 100th review."
"Poured a deep amber with a respectable head that reduced to a skin. The aroma was typically citrus hops. The taste was also citrus hops with a bitter after taste. No significant malt taste was there. The feel was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. Nothing particularly special about Celebration, at least in it's 2009 incarnation."
"Medium body low carbination glad I bought a case of this stuff!"
"Had on-tap at the Great Lost Bear in Portland, Maine. It pours a pretty, clear red with a thin head of white bubbles. It has a very hoppy aroma, with lots of floral and pine scents. The main flavor is of hops. It tastes woodsy at first. The bitterness of the hops begins to take over, lingering after you swallow. There is a smokey, wooden taste that is hinted at behind the hops. Overall, it tastes dry and refreshing. I'm giving the beer a 4.5 for flavor right now, as I believe it will improve as it gets a bit warmer (this glass was served slightly colder than I usually drink and review beers). The dryness and crispness of the beer lends itself to a great mouthfeel. It doesn't coat too much, nor does it tickle your throat as you swallow. I think this is a supremely drinkable beer. I could go through a six pack and not get tired of it. I only knocked it down half a point because I like to have a bit of a malty beer every once in a while when drinking something as hoppy as this. Still, I'm quite impressed with this beer. It's going to be the go to beer for our annual Christmas party this year."
"EDIT: just got into my 1st of the 2011 batch and its all 2 the good. really enjoying this now.."
"Future outlook: Outstanding....I'm happy to have 5 more to deal with."
"D=great, balanced beers are always very drinkable with this one having a sessionable ABV and great taste"
"The alcohol is well masked by the fresh and sweet flavors of the hops and malt. This is one that you can sit down and easily have a few."
"This is a great beer that I prefer fresh, but it's still great with a year or more on it."
"This one has been a seasonal favorite of mine for a while, and if you have not had it, GET SOME."
"Poured a light hazy amber color with a beautiful IPA smell. Perfect amount of hops for my taste and it had a very slick feel in my mouth. I could taste some citrus in there too, which was great. But again, something in the taste, for the two beers I had, just seemed really strange and a tad displeasing. I still enjoyed the beer but the strange unidentifiable flavor kind of left me with a not-so-good aftertaste. Otherwise, I enjoyed the beer and I could probably drink these through the night, as long as they're not identical to the ones I had today. That being said, another pretty good job from Sierra."
"From bottle no. 9272110-55. Sampled on November 20, 2009. Pours amber-copper in color. It is heady with a foamy beige tone. It settles down in a bit. The aroma is fruity, almost berry-like with a good dose of hops in there as well. The mouthfeel runs about medium-to-heavy. The taste is well-hopped with a strong berry hint in the background. It reminds me of an IPA with strawberries. A fairly unique recipe in my opinion and well carried off."
"Overall, I'd say that this is an excellent antidote for that hop craving I sometimes get after drinking too many malty winter seasonals. Couldn't drink too many of these in a row because the strong hop profile would overwhelm my palate, but the great taste demands that I go back the the fridge for at least one more."
"Celebration is one of the only beers I'll actually buy cases of. There's a certin joy that fills me when I see those first white and red bottles of the season."
"D- Goes down surprisingly easy for a brew this bitter."
"Notes: This is my favorite winter beer. Consistently good with a reasonable price compared to some other beers similar in quality."
"Pours a nice burnt orange with a just barely off white rocky head. Leaves a nice lace as it recedes. Creates a beautiful bright orange when held up to the light. This is a really delicious looking beer. Some pine and then a wallop of grapefruit and other citrus notes hit the nose first. Has some sweet initially on the palate from the malt, which transforms into a floral hop flavor with citrus and a mellow bitter finish. It has a pretty light mouthfeel that is even creamy a bit sticky. I definitely had lower expectations for this beer, as I usually do with other Sierra Nevadas. Many people love all of their offerings, but what I've doesn't really jive well with my tastes, most notably the Pale Ale. However, this was a pretty balanced IPA, which I definitely did not expect from Sierra Nevada. I would drink this again and would suggest it to others. It is a nice winter ale."
"D- Like I said above, some warmth from the alcohol, but to me it really does not get in the way of drinkability at all. Very drinkable/sessionable stuff."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these. Too bad its seasonal!"
"Overall this was a bit of a disappointment, but with this tasting being my first for Celebration, I will certainly revisit it again in bottle form and adjust my review accordingly if needed. I was really looking forward to this beer as I am a huge fan of American IPAs. Worth A Look."
"There is no way I will every get this beer again. As far as for my own taste buds this was just horrible."
"Six down and if I didn't have to go to work, I would drink these until I disappeared. Beer glorious beer. I raise my glass high."
"great mouthfeel. smoother than i remember from last years tasting. low to medium-low carbonation with a little crisp feel. good drinkability."
"Drinkability is high. I could drink a lot of these and quickly. Very refreshing. SN consistently brews high quality beers. And for the price $8.99 a sixer. You cant go wrong."
"D: I'm quite happy having picked up a six-pack of this. It's a good beer and a great value. I'm not sure I'll get more than that; though. It's a good IPA but not head and shoulders above the rest of the pack."
"The mouth is full and bubbly. Well-rounded. This is little harsher than I remember last year's from the bottle. Big bitterness right away that washes away with some light citrus sweetness and honey. My tongue is a little more torched from this, still, I can get through a few of these no problem. This may be one time I prefer the bottle to draft."
"very creamy and goes down thick on the palate, leaving bready malts and hops in the aftertaste. you can definately tell there's some alcohol in there. easy to drink and enjoy. an all around awesome beer, seasonal or not."
"D: An excellent brew. The label may confuse it to be a Winter-style ale, but rest assured...this is a true IPA with a big hoppy flavor. I love it."
"Drinkabilty: Very!"
"This is probably a great one to go with if you're not the type who wants a lot of spices or a strictly malty Christmas beer. Otherwise, it's just a tasty, well-brewed IPA that I'd drink any time of the year."
"Cheers!"
"Heart, chewy and full bodied mouthfeel which is very hop forward. Lots of fresh juicy floral, earthy hops that lingers throughout over the slightly toasty caramel biscuity malt backbone into a bitter dry floral hop finish. This beer is uber-fresh and bursting with luscious dank oily hops. Subtle citrus notes and some nice earthy pine. Sweet dark fruit notes mid-palate, especially dark cherries, and a slightly medicinal presence. More wonderful fresh hoppiness in the finish without a trace of alcohol warmth. Dangerously drinkable and a beer I look forward to all year. Highly recommended."
"D- Nice and smooth with a bit hop bite. Worth picking up."
"One of the better seasonal brews I have had this year and my first tasting of sierra nevadas line up. Would definitely buy again."
"I will be buying a couple of cases of this.. and might not review anything for a good while. This beer is right in my wheelhouse... one of the better IPAs I've come across in a while. Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this beer. World-class."
"This is always a favorite that I look forward to each holiday season."
"D - Smooth with great drinkability and average abv."
"Drinkability: This is a fine example of a West Coast style of IPA without much time in the bottle, which means that it has both the strengths and weaknesses of that style--it has lots of hops and the hops dominate the beer while the malt is well in the background barely making its presence known. I'll be having this one again, but later on after the hops have mellowed out a bit."
"Quite an enjoyable beer, even if it is just another IPA from Sierra Nevada."
"[Drinkability]: Pretty good IPA."
"D - I was so surprised by the notable difference in this beer. I expected Anniversary ale with a different name but luckily I was so wrong. Low-ish ABV lends itself to an easy six-pack night."
"09 version on tap at The Lodge in Boca Raton, FL. Poured into a pint glass pours a hazy orange with a fluffy foamy head that leaves nice thick fat lace. The smell is upfront with a hop explosion west coast done right, citrus smells dominate. The taste is out of this world, strong bold citrus type flavors dominate, grapefruit, tangerine, orange all come together in a fine tasting beer. Overall this is one of my favorite IPA's out there. The quality, the hop profile and the nice malt make this one of the best west coast IPA's that we get everywhere."
"Pours a nice and pretty deep mahogany with a decent off white head that dissipates and spits out aromas. Nose is very piny and bitter, resiny and sweet, not too spicy though, and a tad of citrus. Taste is really bitter and piney and it is so clean and bitter on the back of the palate. Mouthfeel and drinkability were good."
"D: Very smooth and a little bitterness makes it a very drinkable brew. Already poured another and this one's smoother yet."
"Overall, a very good IPA and one that everyone should try. Don't expect it to be a winter warmer because it isn't. A very bready IPA with plenty of earthy hops and a spicy kick. Happy Holidays!"
"I have to say, as a few others have hinted at- it tastes a bit thinner and lighter than previous versions...Perhaps its so early in its life and is so fresh- I'm not sure, but I think it could maybe use some additional aging. Although I'd hate to lose any of the hop flavor...Either way; a very solid, pleasant and highly drinkable cold-weather ale and still one of my ""go-to"" beers."
"D - A flavorful and well balanced brew. My first time drinking the Celebration Ale, and I must say I am pretty impressed. One of the best of the Sierra Nevada offerings that I have sampled."
"This is always one of my favorute seasonals. It has lots of hop flavor but also has a nice malt profile to bring everything together. My token fridge beer for the holidays."
"D: Hell yes! I know some like to cellar this one, but it's perfect the way it is right now."
"D- It's easy to kill several of these if you like Sierra's hop profile. Still a classic winter seasonal."
"Why does this hoppy beer taste better to me with a few months age on it? Not sure. Very big orange in the nose, tangerine and spruce. Taste is sprucey, floral and grapefruity like an IPA with a big orange backbone. Spicey and herbal notes with a low bubbly feel to it, surprisingly I would appreciate more bubbles and I preferred last years batch to this years."
"D: Overall a good tasting IPA. Easily could put a few of these back in a sitting"
"For hop-heads, this is an extremely drinkable and delicious brew. And with the alcohol content of 6.8% ABV, quite potent."
"d-not bad, overall a good winter IPA to chase the cold away; I guess its god that everyone doesn't fall into the traditional winter ale line up, I'll be trying a few more of these this winter,"
"O- Wonderful holiday ale. This will keep we going through the winter."
"Mouthfeel is good, there is nice palate continuity and there is no real after taste. Drinkability is high. I would recommend this beer."
"I was really disappointed with this beer and on this review would not recommend it at all. I'll have to try it in bottle form because it's getting such rave reviews - perhaps the keg was just poorly tapped."
"Even with the age, it's still apparent that this is a very good IPA. I will have to pick up some fresh bottles to make my comparison. With the age on this bottle, I'm really excited to try some fresh."
"Very tasty and drinkable-A fine ""Christmas"" ale"
"Very nice look to this one. Orange amber with an off white head that boasts some exceptional retention. Lacing is also very good. Carbonation is strong in the appearance. The smell is kind of restrained. Malts and hops. Pine. Taste redeems the smell though, piney hops, wood-like flavor feel to it, malts. The hops linger and give a bit of a nice warming. Malts also serve to balance well, although the hops have more of a say. Creamy mouthfeel with a nice coating of hoppy goodness on the tongue, carbonation is good here as well. This may be my favorite of the SN offerings."
"It is a good IPA, not the first thing I think of for winter though, seems like your typical west coast IPA but slightly more pedestrian coming out of Sierra Nevada. 3.00 a bottle isn't bad but there are some more barleywine type IPA's id go for before this one during winter. I like it better than the original SNPA, it is similar but has a bit more body, a bit more character, and a bit more substance to it. It tastes more like a small run brew than the massive operation SNPA is."
"24oz (perfect size, IMO) bottle picked up today at Table and Vine. Pours a semi-translucent orange-amber. Matter can be seen floating in tiny pieces throughtout the whole glass. The head is very nice, three fingers to begin with but dies down to two fingers and stays nice and creamy, very good retention. The head already begins to leave thick lacing down the glass as it dies down. One of the best looking beers I have ever seen. Smell is pretty simple but good. Smells of basically light malts and piney hops, a good balance of the two. Also some citrus can be picked up here too. The overall strength could be a bit higher though. Taste here is also simple and basically the same as the smell. The balance between the malts and hops is great. The huge amount of piney hop flavor reminds me of the holiday season and is very effective. Some citrus can be picked up but it is tasteful and adds a nice element in the background of the pine hops. A downside here is the alcohol will come into play when it warms up and it ruins hte flavor for me, try and enjoy this one while its pretty cool. Mouthfeel is fitting. It is moderate bodied with a decent creamyness, nice medium carbonation and no alcohol warming(when its cool). The hops leave a nice coat on the tongue that will last for a long time after the beer is finished. The MF suits the flavors well. Drinkability is good. The taste is great, the only thing here is the hops that will die down and the beer will taste like alcohol. The price is great ($3.50 a 24oz). I will probably buy this one while it is out for some good sessions to come."
"D: I remember having this beer about 10 years ago and I hated it. It tasted like a poinsettia to me. Now I want a keg of this in my house. There is a reason this has been around so long and is so popular."
"D - One of my go to beers in the fall/winter. This is an extremely drinkable IPA for me. Plenty of bitterness, tons of hop flavor and really well balanced, and at 6.8% this one won't kill you. Good winter all day beer."
"Pours into a Slaapmutske glass a not too hazy medium amber with a tall creamy white head that is slow to dissipate, leaving a heavy lacing all the way around. The hops jumps at nose right from the pour. Slightly floral scent but not extreme. The taste is mellow, bitterness is medium. Not much of a bite to this one but to some that is a good thing. Carbonation is medium to high giving the hops an extra boost. Drinkability is good and I would say this would be a good one to drink on any occasion. Would be nice to drink a few on a cold winter day, just could use a little more alcohol. You know, for the warming. :D Overall one of the best offerings from this brewery."
"d: A baragin at twice the price. Something to look forward to every year."
"D- This is definitely a great IPA to turn to during the winter months; the nice full feel makes it comforting when it gets cold out."
"Mouthfeel is a good medium with a good amount of carbonation."
"Note: I like this better than last year's version."
"I downgraded it a bit on drinkability just because of the hop factor. It burns up the taste buds pretty quick."
"Deep gold pour into a pint glass. Oily looking bubbles. Smells a little sweet, like pale malts. Also a good amount of hops. I honestly forgot this was a IPA, despite the fact that I know I've had it a few years ago. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, but its there. Hop flavor dominates. Definately some piney american hopes in there. There may be some British hops, giving some earthy/metally flavors. Can't really tell right now. Not bad. I think I like their torpedo a little better."
"Nice malty undertones and a very nice mouthfeel."
"Ruby red body with a big white head. Smell is completely dominated by citrusy hops. The taste is another matter altogether. This is surprisingly malt-forward for an IPA, with the hops just kind of lingering in the background. It's very good overall, but it doesn't really feel like an IPA to me. I think of it as more of a mini-barleywine or hoppier than usual old ale. That's OK, though, since when I think of the holidays, ""hop bomb"" isn't really the first thing that comes to mind."
"Overall a decent beer. I'm not sure what sets this apart from every other AIPA. Drinkable."
"It's a little too much bitterness for a session beer but a really nice and enjoyable brew."
"This is the perfect, hoppy beer for drinking one after another on a cold night. It can't get much better than this beer in my book, but I am an IPA lover!"
"Pleasant, but just a bit too hoppy for my palate."
"Celebration Ale is very drinkable, in my opinion; the hops are not overpowering, nor is the supporting malt backbone. This is my first Celebration Ale of the season, and I feel that I've been reminded once again of one of the many reasons I love winter."
"I'm glad I went for the whole 12 pack, rather than just a sixer. But then again...I have a feeling this 12 pack isn't going to last long..."
"Every holiday season there is at least a 12 pack of these wonderfully hopped beers in my fridge...pours a crisp bright amber with a great fluffy head; awesome amount of hops (dry hopped with Cascade and Centennial) and great crisp tasting, it makes you want another sip almost immediately....a masterpiece of brewing."
"D-Very nice easily finished my 24oz and was looking for more."
"It is not going to change your life or make you think."
" Cheers!"
"P.S. I actually drove 140 miles round trip this afternoon to pick up 2 cases. This didn't disappoint, and I can honestly say my holiday season has started!"
"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is a near-perfect IPA. I look forward to its arrival every autumn, and unlike most highly-anticipated things, it never disappoints."
"*Edited from original review."
"Poured into a pint glass. It has a nice golden amber color. Poured with a nice two finger head that dissipated slowly. It has an excellent hoppy pine aroma. The aroma doesn't lie. The first sip is an incredibly awesome pine hop attack that is well balance with a solid malt backbone. This is my favorite Sierra Nevada offering with Southern Hemisphere and one of my favorite IPAs overall. It made my day to see this in the liquor store today when I was picking up beer for the GA vs. FL football game."
"Drinkability - Remarkably so. I could session the heck out of this thing. At almost 7% abv and at sixteen dollars for a twelve pack, this is a relatively cheap, great tasting IPA. I will admit, I was hoping to taste more spices seeing as this is a ""Christmas"" beer...I guess I will get my fix with SA Winter Lager and Ole' Fezziwig for that! But overall a great beer."
"D: This beer is quite drinkable, but hits surprisingly hard for 6.8%."
"D- Highly drinkable, right in the average range for an IPA, in my opinion this beats the pants off any spiced winter beer. And the name is PC too."
"D: I look forward to Celebration Ale every year. the 2009 version is a well crafted IPA and I'm looking forward to enjoying the rest of the 6 pack. it's not quite as smooth as I was hoping it to be, but a damn fine IPA that doesn't disappoint."
"D: I almost finished an entire six pack last night. Very tasty and very enjoyable all around."
"Overall, a very nice standard American IPA that is balanced very well."
"Edit from 2010 release: this does deserve a 5 on drinkability."
"P.S. Drink it fresh! And long live the poinsettia-covered label."
"D & Comments. My favorite selection from SN. I think the hop profile in celebration beats out torpedo. Overall a great fall/winter beer."
"This is a classic."
"This review is from notes several months old."
"A very good IPA. I like this better than their Torpedo. Would drink again. Would buy again, depending on what else was available."
"This is the stuff that expanded my mind beyond high life light from the can. It looks fantastic. Deep, dark copper to amber brown. Gigantic creamy rocky head. Lacing that slides down the entire side of the mug. Perfect. Very fragrant fresh hop smell. I've never been to a hop farm at harvest time, but this is what I imagine it smells like. The taste is ideal for an IPA. Thick, chewy bready backbone. Understated sweet toasty caramel malt with the perfect amount of fresh complex oily hop bitterness. It doesn't go too far with the hops and produce a bitter aftertaste. Again, perfect. This is hands down my favorite beer. It might be my favorite part of Christmas."
"Poured into a pint glass. Dark copper, almost reddish hue, with an average head, but good lacing. The smell was surprisingly dominated by hoppy pine and citrus, and an ever so subtle apple essence. I was expecting more spiciness for a winter warmer/ipa. The taste did reveal more biscuit and maltiness, but it was also still heavily dominated by pine and citrus. Nice medium body and little carbonation resulted in a beer that rolled smoothly over the tongue. Drinkability was certainly apparent, but again, I was unpleasantly surprised by the lack of spiciness for a winter release."
"Back when I bought this I thought the hop flavor was way too over the top but it seems to have mellowed dramatically. It also could be that I wasn't a fan of IPAs/DIPAs but I've gotten into them a bit more this year after finding some exceptional examples. I look forward to putting another 6er of this away this year to try around the same time next year."
"Long bitter hop finish."
"Definitely one of my favorite winter warmers. I hope this years is as good as last."
"Nice strong hop flavor, really floral and bitter. I wish it was a year round offering. I would definitely drink regularly and I can't wait till it's released again."
"Still prefer this one fresh but glad I had one sitting around to try with some age on it. In the end everything was great, the flavor had just faded which is to be expected of this style."
"This one is still great with a little age on it. Probably a good option for those who considered SN to be too hoppy, if that's even possible! The age downgrades a great beer to really good."
"D: I wish I'd not aged this so long, though despite its age, it is still well done."
"Smell is hops. Piney and grassy hops. Still a good amount of bitterness in the flavor. You can tell that this has some age on it, but it's still drinkable. There's a god enough base beer underneath that when the hops start to fade, you're still left with a solid beer. Medium in the mouthfeel and fairly drinkable."
"D - This is a very interesting beer, there is a lot going on. It has complex flavours and aromas, and it's the sort of beer that could taste slightly different each time you drink it."
"Pours a medium copper that is fairly clear with a dense, creamy off-white head that never fully dissolves and remains a thick layer atop the glass. The nose is biscuit malts, brown sugar, and some hints of hops. The flavor is a little watery upfront with some touches of sweet malt, toast and ends with a hop bitterness that lasts. Its medium bodied and has turned a little chewy. This beer is much better fresh as most of the hops that made this brew so special before have faded. It still drinks alright but is a little watery. I'll re-rate this again come December when its fresh."
"Other comments: OK, this beer does not age well (at least not extended aging). It has become very unbalanced and a mere shadow of it's former self. Good experiment though."
"2013 was great again, this time with stronger piney notes IMO. Had at least a case as well as a few pints on tap this year and it is always a great beer."
"notes and comments- tasting an '08 so this has about eight months in the bottle from the release date. the overall profile is mellower then when first released. i look forward to this beer every year as it ushers in the holiday season. if i had to pick a beer to accompany me on an island, i would have to throw it into the ring. i think two to four months in the bottle really elevates and integrates this beer well...you can't go wrong."
"Overall it's a nice winter IPA and I'm looking forward to trying it fresh."
"Just picked this up (5/21/09) on clearance for under $5.00 a six. It is out of date and I didn't car because I wanted to see if the flavor changed with age. Wow this Beer changed. The hop flavor went way down and the malt and spice went up. If you tried this beer a few months ago and see this on sale get it and see what I mean. I loved this when It came out and drank a lot of it. Before it was a rich IPA. This is now a different beer. The hops were hiding the malt and spices before and now they have come to play."
"D: Intense tropical fruits and high bitterness and a decently high ABV... it in a way is a sipper but its complexity has me taking drinks over and over trying to pint point its depth of flavors. A big beer that begs to be drank, I must say. This beer has me thinking about it more than most IPAs do, but in a very good way."
"Had a couple in my fridge from a little while back so I thought I'd have one. I've had it on tap too which is even better, so if it's available to you go for it! It has a nice very strong hoppy taste to it while being very refreshing at the same time. Goes with almost any type of meal or snack. Has a rich amber color to it with nice clarity to it as well, so the amount of flavor is a bit surprising. Very little bad to say about it, but if I had to be picky about it I don't find the aroma exceptionally strong, but still a nice hoppy smell to it. Very drinkable you could chug it if you want, but I would never recommend it, very much worth savoring this one."
"Great mouthfeel. Has some nice body to it. Goes down very smoothly as well. Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
"Bought this as a twelve pack back in January. Pours an orange-red color. Still has nice citrus smell; hop ""bite"" has mellowed since I had it on draft in November. Actually more sessionable now. I pick up a bit of fruitness but after four swallows, can't quite pinpoint it. I picked up a bigger hop bite back in November when I had it on draft; I actually like it better now! Very sessionable; I'll be disapointed when I run out."
"Pours a dark hazy redish orange with a frothy white head that fades fast and leaves lacing. The smell is mostly hops with sweet notes, with some subtle spice notes. The smell could be subdued due to the cellaring (this is a 2008 release). The taste starts with a bite with some bitter hops followed by the spice and sweet notes, and finishes with the bitter hops again. The aftertaste is a long drawn out hop flavor. The mouthfeel is ok, the harsh bitter bite can turn some away, but the veteran hophead will fall in love. The flavor is deep, not very complex, but good. This is definitely a celebration of hops, and delicious beer. A good beer, great flavor."
"D: Yes!"
"Smooth up front with a definite hops back end! For an American IPA it is pretty tasty, although I probaby would reach for a Two Hearted first before this, it still is a great choice"
"Had this beer at the Tap House In Norfolk. Reviewed from notes taken. Poured into a pint glass. Poured a dark amber color, with a head that diminishes quite rapidly. Good lacing as you finish the beer. Lot of citrus and pines in the aroma. The taster had more of the pine, some grapefruit and wood? and mint which was just great and just the right amount of spice. Wow what a great beer. What a great beer from a great brewery. Can't wait to have some more, specialy on tap. Awesome."
"D - Goes down very easily"
"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is a slightly spicy overly hopped adventure into a very bitter realm. For ""hop-heads"" only."
"D - This one completely threw me off. IPA is kind of a stretch. Should be a ""Christmas IPA."" So different from any other IPA, this one deserves to be recognized as a great. Could drink this all night long."
"Very sessionable."
"The color and head on the beer are both great. Decent smell on the ale, not what I expected though. The taste itself wasn't bad, just not impressive either. For all the noise about how great this beer was I was not impressed at all. It tasted like a stronger SN Pale Ale. That idea sounds like it would be a great brew, but something missed in this beer. Just flat didn't like it."
"Taste is not very balanced, IMO, even hoppier than aroma. It's a hop explosion with very fresh leafy and flowery notes and some bitter citrus fruits - malt is there, not totally overwhelmed, but still overshadowed. Some sugery candy-like flavor. The feel is smooth and creamy and the drinkability could be better if not the alcohol were not so noticeable and the hops weren't so assertive. But, like I mentioned, if you're looking for a hop moment, here it is."
"I will skip the standards with this many reviews. This is a good looking beer with a spicy smell and great head. This beer is just plan awesome for the winter months. I always start off with this beer when we get into the Christmas ales. And what a great way to start a session. IMO this is what I did about a beer just damm well balanced and oh so good. You should really enjoy this one. Later"
"D) Sierra Nevada always puts together a great pale ale and this is one of them!"
"This beer is a ruby red good looking beer. Head sticks around for a bit, and the beer is well carbonated. Centennial hops really permeate off this brew and i get a slight caramel hit too, with all voices screaming drink me. Hops are fantastically well balanced in this beer along with the winter spices( ie nutmeg & cinnamon), and the beautifully balanced malt. If anything dominated this brew it would be the sincere craft feel and the way in which it captures the essence of a true holiday IPA. If I had to drink a single beer for the rest of my days, this would be it."
"Notes: I was curious to try this, rate it since it has about 4 months on it. I was hoping that a bit more of the malt came through but I was dissapointed. The unimaginative use of hops in this beer is annoying."
"Scott"
"Drinkability - Sharp hops all day long upfront and on the way down. I wonder how it will age. The rest of the six pack went in the cellar for another taste in November 2009."
"12 oz bottle to pint glass. Copper color with a light tan frothy head. Aroma is grapefruity cascade hops with some grass/spiciness. Flavor is dull semisweet caramel maltiness with generic cascade character. Astringent with moderate bitterness, slightly acrid. Overrated."
"Fabulous beer by SN. These guys have got this beer dialed right. It's an amazingly easy drinker despite it's 6+ % abv. Get some. Hands down one of my favorite beers."
"D: An all around quality IPA that is a welcome treat during the winter months."
"Really a solid example of an IPA. Hops dominated, tasty - though that being said, I wouldn't want to sip on it forever."
"Pours a really nice light copper, amberish color with a hint of orange. It produces a very nice head that sticks around for quite some time that leaves some very nice lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is very hoppy and piney. The taste is bitter in a very good way and right away you can tell it's pretty hoppy. The aroma, taste, and mouthfeel are all great in this beer. I could drink this all day easily. I love this beer, another great beer from a great brewery. It's to bad it's only seasonal, I guess it's good since I can look forward to it every year!"
"This beer is very easy to drink, and the moderate abv means you can have a few."
"Overall: I reviewed this beer when it was at least 4 months old, but the argument has been made that this IPA holds up well to aging. This is definitely a beer to stock up on: great value for an exceptional IPA."
"Overall, this was a really good to great IPA. One of the best winter seasonals out there. Worth a try."
"D: Fairly drinkable, the hop taste is good. The price is pretty good too. Overall, a decent IPA at a decent price."
"Medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. At first, I found this to be a little too bitter but I quickly warmed up to it. I would definitely drink these again but I probably wouldn't care to have too many in one sitting."
"Floral hop flavor profile while not going overboard on the bitterness. Smooth caramel and toasty maltiness provides just enough balance to keep it from being a hoppy mess. What I love about this beer is that there is no indications of oxidation or any other off flavors. A great beer and is quite possibly my favorite SN brew."
"Pretty high drinkability. A very good beer."
"This beer pours a great burnt orange color with a one finger head that recedes to a ring and leaves sticky lace. Ohhh, the smell of pine hops puts a smile on my face. I first had this beer in early December and it instantly reminded me of a fresh cut Christmas tree. The taste is dominated by pine hops and finishes with that great bitterness. A hint of sweetness fights though, but I had to search for it. Medium bodied and good drinkability."
"A nice beer that I would love to try on-tap."
"Overall- This is a decent beer but could use a bigger malt profile. Good display of hops."
"D. I'm not exactly a hops head and I still liked this beer. Strong representation of the style. After this beer ill have to try more IPA's in the future."
"A long time favorite of the Christmas season."
"Perfect bitterness with a clear taste of grapefruit. Very nicely balanced bitterness, fruitiness, and a tiny sweet note. The best beer I have bought in Sweden."
"Conclusion: Classic West-Coast IPA...a little sharp, but overall quite pleasing...I make sure to pick this up every year"
"As for drinkablity, it is damn good. I could easily put down a sixer of this in a few hours."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery. Refreshing and seems to be a good fit for hot weather."
"Pours out amber with a huge off white head, great retention and lacing all the way down. Smell isn't as strong as I'd expect. Taste is a hop bite up front. Not too much, just right. This is a great average IPA. It's a little twist of Sierra Nevada's IPA's that make it great for the winter. Warms you up a little."
"I have to say it was a little of both. This is a good, solid beer, with plenty of IPA flavor & some subtle spices to give it that wintery feeling. I understand the drinkability - it is a sublime piece of work, created to be lovingly downed in multiple bottles."
"D: This beer hits me harder then its claimed 6.8%, seems higher to me, but never tastes boozy. It just tastes so good and balanced, is so beautiful to look at it must be poured in a glass. A great achievement, when I can get it, its in my fridge. A very under rated brew imho."
"I look forward to the release of this beer every year. A straight foward American Style IPA. A benchmark of the style. If anyone is confused, this isnt a winter warmer, or spiced holiday beer either...its an IPA. Pours a nice clear amber colour with a substantial head. Nice sticky lace coats the glass as the beer is consumed. Smells like grapefruit juice, tastes like grapefruit juice and may as well be grapefruit juice. Gotta love those Cascade and Chinook hops. Bitterness is abrasive, just how I like it. If you are into grapefruity beers, this is it. I absolutly love this beer!"
"As a regular DIPA drinker, I find it very drinkable. That being said, for those who prefer a less hopped beer, one might be enough."
"D- Pretty easy to drink. I could take down a six-pack of this brew no problem. Not the best IPA I've had, and definitely not balanced, but a good session choice if you like hops."
"On the darker/fuller feeling of the IPA spectrum, almost winter warmer like in the fullness. But if ya got that hop itch, this will satisfy."
"Time to review celebration. Pours a decent offwhite creamy head. Color is red/ almost orange with good clarity, just wonderful. Smell is and nice hit of piney hops, not too powerful but good. Taste is right there with citris hops. Finishes up with a nice bite of bitterness. Mouthfeel is about medium bodied, not too heavy. Overall a great from Sierra Nevada which I will buy again next year."
"1'' off white/eggshell head. Great retention and thick, fresh lacing. Copper color with good clarity. Wonderful aroma of creamy, sweet malts and piney, citrusy hops. Classic Sierra Nevada nose. Hop bitterness form start to finish...lots of pine needle and bitter orange peel/rind. Nice malt backing - faint caramel in finish, still - a hop showcase. Medium body with tongue tingling alcohol and bracing hops - decent level of carbonation. One hell of a beer."
"D: Had two but felt as if I could have had several more."
"Drinkability - Drinkable. Good enough to buy again next year."
"I haven't had SN Torpedo yet, but if it is anything like this in a year-round format, then I will have something that my fridge will never be without (until next winter!)"
"D - Good drinkability...I would not hesitate to reach for another"
"Drinkability: I really liked this beer, but I think I was expecting a little more from it, especially considering its hyped status. Although I like its unbalanced character and big hop flavors (the strawberry presence, both in the smell and in the taste, is really great), the bitterness is a bit too to much and overpowers both the hop and malt flavors."
"Full bodied and with an active but not overwhelming carbonation. A more robust malt backbone than often found in West Coast IPAs, this one is very nice."
"pours nice. The first thing I notice is the citrus, tates like grapefruit. then at the end it is so incredible bitter its hardly drinkable, to me, and its stays on the sides of my mouth and wont leave! I dont see what the fuss is about on this one, but then again im not into overly hopped beers either. It does have nice carbonation though."
"Over all a solid beer."
"I couldn't wait until the holidays this year. Next year will be no different."
"Poored a nice orangeish red color with a huge offwhite head that disipated to a light cover with in minutes. Smells of hops spicey hops and an undescribable winter/x-mas spice blend? Taste of hops more spicy hops almost no malt to speek of. Mouthfeel is silky and smooth very good drinkability as well would deffinatly buy it again"
"D - Good drinkability. Graet balance off fruitiness and hop spice. A great winter beer."
"Don't miss this one!"
"I do think this is some really good stuff but I think people hype it up more than it is worth. I like the new Torpedo more than this."
"I only tried this because it was on special, and now it's one of my favorites. The only thing I don't like is that it's not always available."
"picked up a 24-pack of this after having a pint on tap. Light amber with a finger and a half of very nice looking, frothy head that lasts almost through the pint. Smell is very pleasent floral hops and pine. Sensing a slight pepper of centenials but i can't be sure. Taste is wonderful blend of hops dominated by a peppery hop flavor but not overpoweringly so like many lesser ipas today. Rather, it's a well-crafted blend of bitterness. Not much else to the taste... Just solid hops! Very good ipa."
"M/D - Nice mouthfeel with decent carbonation that makes this one a definitely must try."
"Drinkability: A Celebration of brash, simplistic bitterness which, if that's your bag, is fine, but I never ever quite understood all the hoopla for this beer."
"Although this is close to being a winter type of IPA there is just not enough abv for such therefore enjoy this year around."
"(couldn't rate the appearance very well) Very malty then very very hoppy aroma. Bitter hoppy taste, but mellows at the end. More mellow as it warms up: hops, some malt sweetness. A decent mellow ale."
"Good beer, not overly hopped, would drink again"
"Enjoy it!"
"Too bad this is seasonal. It's one of my favorite beers. I bought a case in December, and I'm down to my last six-pack. :("
"version!"
"Medium bodied, great mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on. Very smooth with a touch of creaminess. Drank extremely easy despite the massive presence of hops - the only problem is you can drink them way too fast, despite the ABV. This is a great beer."
"Poured a reddish orange color with a thick head that left awesome rings of lacing. Smelled of piney and grapefuit. Taste was really good with a nice balanced hop flavor with a subtle malt balance. THe beer is medium bodied and has adequate carbonation. This is one smooth beer and for someone that isn't huge on hop overload this was a really enjoyable beer. I'm hoping I can still scrounge a sixer or more if it's still available. Very drinkable but watch out for the disguised 6.8%."
"Poured a nice copper color with a thick, two-finger head from a 12oz bottle. Aroma is that of cascade hops, pine and citrus. Taste is an overload of pine, almost like drinking directly from a pine tree. There are no surprises here - the aroma permeates your nose all the while you simultaneously taste the same thing. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Drinking ability is great here and I don't really have anything to complain about. ABV is a little on the high end for an ipa which decreases its session-ability. This is a pretty straight forward but great example of the style. I get why this is all people talk about for the month of december."
"Drinkability- good not great for me but i can knock back a few."
"Drinkability is great. A little lower ABV would perhaps make it a bit more sessionable"
"Drinkability: Very. This is a wonderful IPA that shouldn't be confused with a seasonal Christmas beer as indicated on the label."
"drinkability: very solid beer, a staple during the hoildays"
"D - Great beer, but the heaviness and ABV would keep me from drinking alot. But, with holiday beers drinking a lot is not really the point. I was pleasantly surprised to find no spicy additions to this holiday beer."
"Fantastic beer that is one of my favorites. I'll be buying at least 1 sixer of this every year for a long time. Sierra Nevada does hoppy, drinkable beers like no other."
"D: A great ale that works on many levels"
"I'll leave the pretty words to those with a better vocabulary. If you see this, buy it. You will not be disappointed."
"D: A great heavily malted xmas style beer with a good hop bitterness that still drank smoothly."
"Find it, drink it, love it. Sierra Nevada makes some solid beers, but this is surely one of their best. I look forward to it every year. Highly recommend to have around the house."
"D - this doesn't really seem like a winter beer to me, more like a normal IPA"
"Picked up a six pack at Trader Joe's because I've never had the chance to try this beer. Poured into a standard pint glass. Bright orange color. Ivory white head. Decent lacing. Hops really stood out in the smell. And yes, after the first sip, the hops hit me. Now, maybe it's my fault, but this is not what I expected. I thought this beer was more along the lines of a winter ale, with the very festive label and all. Not being a huge hophead, I was looking for something a bit more smooth to drink. Sierra Nevada has made quite a nice IPA here, but it's a bit overly hoppy for my taste."
"In a side note, my father saved some 2007. The family beer drinkers tasted them blind side by side. Almost all of us preferred the 2008. After a year 2007 is still a good beer, just not as ""bright"" as 2008... and 2007 carried an additional flavor characteristic... something similar to the hoppiness of Fuller's ESB."
"With this review Celebration officially joins Old Rasputin on my list of incredible beer bargains."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and easy drinking. Very impressed with this beer. Highly recommend!"
"I just had a bottle of Celebration for the first time ever. Which is amazing considering I've been pretty into beer for several years now. Always figured it was a middle-of-the-road, avoidable beer. Man was I wrong. Celebration is great stuff. I'll definitely be getting it again next year."
"I'm buy this again... and again. It is a great brew. I'd taste their Pale, Celebration and new Torpedo side-by-side."
"D - Seems like a great session beer with fellow beerophiles. Seems like a near-perfect warming brew after being out in the snow and cold."
"Notes: Excellent winter seasonal, with all the winter warmer/wassail/spiced beer winter seasonals, this IPA is nice change of pace."
"drinkability- great tasting beer and easy to drink."
"D: Daunting at first, especially for me, not a huge fan of IPAs, but I have to respect this beer. The dynamic flavor-smell combinations are remarkable, and though it's not my favorite, the never-departing flavor may be the reminder that it is something to be reckoned with. Not for the faint of palate."
"I will definitely try this again when it is next in season next year."
"Drinkability: This is my go to beer for the winter months. But, alas, Bigfoot and Torpedo Extra IPA will soon be out and I'll have to find something else to session. I'll be looking forward to next year's batch."
"Pours out of the bottle a deep hazy copper color with an pillowy white head that sticks to the glass producing some excellent lacing as I drink. Smells of citrus hops. A very clean crisp scent that matches the flavor of clean hops with some malt in the backround. A bit thicker than most IPAs but all in all an excellent beer. Drinkability is good. I could have a few of these. Yum"
"The first thing I noticed was the sour citrus fruit. However, this was immediately overpowered by a blast of hops. There is a hint of malt but it is dominated by the hop flavor. I can catch a bit of spice toward the end, but very little. The beer finishes dry, very clean and simply refreshing. The aftertaste brings back a tad of the citrus fruits mixed with the somewhat bitter taste you come to expect from the style. Even at 6.8% abv. the alcohol is barely noticeable."
"D: Highly drinkable, it's refreshing and solid flavor without tasting alcohol makes this a great session beer"
"Conclusion - Great beer, very drinkable. Seems to taste better at cooler temps than when warmer. As always, great quality from an amazing brewery!"
"-peace"
"overall i would say that i like them fresh more than aged. that being said, this is the third aged one i've had and ive found them all to be very good. with a year on it, it tastes more like a hopped up APA than an AIPA."
"D: As I lie in bed each morning and ask myself why I should put both my feet on the floor there are precious few reasons I've been able to come up with. The chance to escape my girlfriend's morning breath, sure. Celebration Ale? It's too early to drink but people it is never to early to think about it."
"Others here have described it far better than I can but this is well worth drinking and should be sought out."
"D: A very nice IPA, worthy of multiple in one sitting."
"This beer is definitely worth Celebrating."
"Drinkability: As usual, Sierra Nevada doesn't disappoint. Plenty of American style bitterness. A true classic of a winter release. Solid beer."
"Pours a dark amber and a slight clarity. Retains a two finger off-white head that slowly moves to a nice collar and excellent laciness. Fresh aroma with some spice, but mainly piney. Good smell. Taste is mellow and balanced with pine and a slight malt taste. There is a slight bitterness, but smooths out. Texture is viscous but not heavy bodied. Good drinking beer, very enjoyable. A bit on the sweet side so only a couple at a time."
"Not very drinkable in my opinion - it was a bit too hoppy for my taste, even for an IPA and the aftertaste did not make the experience any better. I know a lot of people enjoy Sierra Nevada stuff, but just about everything I've tried has been disappointing and unfortunately I had higher hopes for this ale."
"D: I can and have drank Celebration all night. great beer and a very drinkable one at that and also at a great value! Something to look forward to all year long!"
"Great seasonal offering here, could drink it all day, just a good IPA too."
"A great example of an american ale that is worth spending the extra dollars for. It is always a staple for me during the holiday season."
"Slightly darker and definitely more red in color than SN pale ale. Could be the pour, but the head also fluffed up more than the pale ale I had just prior. Just as clear, less fizzy, and more red (almost pinish, even)--for me those are all positives. Less hops and more malt both in the smell and in the taste. This is a very nice beer--somewhere between a red and a pa/ipa--and that suits me just fine. It's not as big as many seasonal releases; I expected it to be a slightly bigger beer, closer in that regard to Bigfoot. But there is nothing to complain about and plenty to enjoy. As it warms, a nice malty sweetness becomes more noticeable. This is definitely a beer that you could drink all night at a holiday celebration."
"taste a little thick, spice, pepper, a little caramel, some citrus, and hops, ends a little dry with a slight bitter aftertaste."
"Poured from a stubby brown 12oz bottle into my SA pint glass. Pours a clear amber color with a nice big fluffy head. Stickly lacing lines the glass after every sip. Fresh aroma of malt, citrus and strong piney hops. Taste is all about the hops, oily and piney with just enough malt to give it some balance but this beer is all about the hops. It is a shame this is not avaiable year round. I always say I am going to lay some down, but they are usually gone by February."
"Overall, It's not a favorite, but I'd definitely drink it again. It's bitter, but what self-respecting IPA isn't? Basically, I wouldn't specifically seek it out, but I'd definitely drink it if I was offered some."
"Drinkability: Really easy to drink, especially if you like hops at all. A good AIPA! Would recommend this one!"
"Recommended."
"Overall a really nice beer. Will seek out and recommend to others. I'll grab two sixers every Nov/Dec release and share with friends."
"D - This beer is without a doubt a very drinkable beer. however i would appreciate maybe a toning down on the hops in this brew so that i may appreciate its complexity of flavors. or maybe its not even the hops, but rather this continued grapefruit taste that im getting. never was much a fan of grapefruit. nonetheless i think ive found a winter brew that i can stick with, however it still dissapoints in some areas."
"All in all, its color, aroma, mouthfeel and tatse are as good as it gets for an American IPA - beautifully balanced - a perfect winter warmer as its inviting label shall attest."
"Drinkability: Just an ""okay"" seasonal ale, there are far better. It seems too sweet and just not enough in many categories."
"A delicious IPA. Wish this was available year round. An unbelievable bargain as well. Around the holidays 12 packs were going for $12.99 in Safeway supermarkets. Awesome. I'd buy a pallet if I had the room."
"Overall its a very drinkable beer that is inexpensive compared to some that are poorer quality."
"D/O: Yeah, this one's all about the hops, and I for one am appreciative! The balance brought on by the rich caramel malts prevent this beer from becoming an over-the-top tongue bruiser, while still preserving the incredible raw hoppiness of it all. Extremely enjoyable, and quite drinkable, both from an ABV and palate-fatiguing standpoint. A refreshing change of pace among the other malty, rich, spiced winter seasonals. I've saved a few of these to cellar and see how things go in 6 months to a year."
"drinkability: it's no wonder this is one of the highest ""looking for to one of those this winter"" beers. give me a sixer and i'm happy, give me a case and i'll send you a Xmas card every year for the rest of my life."
"Absolutely recommended for anyone who likes winter lagers and IPA's."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer. Sierra Nevada always does well with their hoppier beers."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Appearance is a clear amber color with a nice big head. Smells of malts, citrus and strong piney hops. Taste has a nice balance of malt and bitter hops. Mouth feel is very smooth and medium bodied. This beer is very drinkable it's a shame it's only a seasonal brew."
"Perfectly executed, as to be expected from Sierra Nevada. These guys know to use hops. I know my descriptions aren't overly detailed, and don't do it justice, but this beer is so well done. Simple, yet refined. I once heard someone say that this beer is essentially the proto-type for American IPA and I'd have to agree. I've had bigger and hoppier, but I'm not sure I've had better."
"Great fall/winter brew, i grab this every winter i can find it."
"T. Hops bite the tongue right away. Then leads into a smoothed out orange and lemon and grapefruit taste. To end, a great citrus and slight pine hop kick. Refreshing. Creamy texture, but a little on the thinner side."
"D..I like the fact this beer is nearly 7% ABV. Easy to drink a few during a session. Something to enjoy on a cold winter's day."
"Notes: What a perfect beer to enjoy with my dad as we watch USC beat the living daylights out of the Nittany Lions on New Year's Day. This is the definition of a festive beer that is best enjoyed on such special occasions, as it reminds you why this time of the year is so magical. The best session beer on the planet when the holiday season rolls around!"
"The abv is on the north side of 6, but this is pretty well-crafted and as a hophead, I could drink this all night."
"Poured a dark amber color into my Duvel glass with a rocky, soapy, two-finger off-white head which left prodigious lacing all over the inside of the glass. Aroma is fruity hops with a bit of malt, candy (red Jolly Ranchers), flowers. Mouthfeel is full yet not heavy, smooth, great carbonation. Taste is orange and caramel up front, with some nuttiness and toffee flavor towards the middle and a perfect hop bite toward the finish. At first I was skeptical of the hype surrounding this brew, but after tasting it I can honestly say that this is by far the best IPA I have tried and has greatly deepened my appreciation for hops."
"Drinkability: This is a good example of an IPA. Good for a person that is new to IPA's and great for a seasoned beer drinker. Great flavor, great look, very drinkable."
"D: Drinkability is very good. This packs some punch with the flavor, but is still very sessionable. I was able to score another half-case of this, which I plan to cellar. I plan on revisiting this same vintage when the '09 comes out. Tasty stuff."
"Sorry, I just find myself a raving fan of this brew. It looks great, with a big flaffy light tan head floating on the bronz brew, but I found it went down hill from there. It's hoppy, with an earthy, resiny bitterness that just wasn't to my liking, and which I think clashed somewhat with the nutty and slightly caramel malt. Lot's of hops on the nose, this one is pretty aromatic. It's good, but I didn't find to as great as many people here found it."
"Pretty damn hoppy and bitter, with a great biscuity and caramel malt structure. Great hop flavor, I get a lot of grapefruit. A malty IPA as well. Bitter, toasty aftertaste. Delicious overall, too bad it's a seasonal. Ideal carbonation (not too much) and balanced, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Overall impression is that this is a fantastic IPA and one of a kind winter seasonal."
"The nose was very piney, not much citrus that I could detect. The taste was piney as well, the hops really come through. The carbonation was nice on the tongue too. I liked this beer very much, though I'd say the drinkability is OK as the hoppiness got to my palate pretty quickly."
"overall, I have to say this brewery sure knows how to do pales and IPAs, absolutely outstanding American IPA here, very enjoyable, worth seeking out or making a special trip to acquire. the only thing keeping this beer from a perfect score is that the Sierra Nevada Hop Harvest Ale is even better!"
"Poured into a straight pint glass. Pours a lovely dark copper color. Poured a small, tight head that disappated quickly. Leaves a nicer lacing than the head would lead you to believe. A sharp hop aroma. Tastes matches aroma. Basic, solid hop flavors. Little to no floral flavors, all sharp flavors. Lacks body and backbone, but is in line with most American IPAs. Nicely drinkable, I suffer palate fatigue after 2-3 so not really that sessionable. A solid IPA, and I generally have some around when available, but this beer does not run away from others of this style."
"I have to mention that I've had plenty of these before, but I just got around to reviewing it because I enjoy it so much that I've never wanted to sit down and actually think on it enough to write it. I figured since my stock for the year is almost gone, I better get to it!"
"D - The kind of brew I can easily drink a sixer of. Well-balanced, pleasing dry finish. Plenty of hop kick and bitterness lies atop a densely-crafted backbone of malts."
"Overall one of the best Winter Warmer's around. A must have around this time of year. Highly recommended."
"Wow. Really impressed by it's appearance. Nice thick and foamy with tons of lacing on the sides of the glass. Coppery orange color. Smell is wonderfully hoppy. Notes of grapefruit and other citrus smells. Not much in the way of piney fragrances. Taste is really nice as well. Grapefruit bitterness is well balanced by a malty sweetness. Quite smooth and very drinkable."
"This is my first year trying this brew and I must say that I'm quite impressed. It's like their fantastic Pale Ale, but taken to the next level. I'll look forward to this next year..."
"D: A nice IPA, but I think I'm starting to suffer from IPA burnout. Good, but not spectacular and sort of nondescript. Still worth a revisit next year."
"Cheers!!!!"
"First beer I ever purchased at the first ever off-premise liquor store in Belmont, MA. Talk about something to celebrate! $7.99/6 price tag too! Anyway...2007 edition. Deep, dark amber/caramel color with nice, frothy head. Bountiful scent of hops and spice capture the olfactory. Warm, solid effort for this vintage - excellent hop character well-blended with mild spice notes. Nice warming sense on the palate. For something that packs this much of a punch it drinks fairly easily. Well-done."
"Overall an excellent beer.Wish it was around all year."
"Drinkability: The drinkability of this beer is outstanding! This well crafted beer is too smooth, too easy to drink, and too damn tasty. So why exactly is it a seasonal???"
"Overall, its a very clean, hoppy, and refreshing brew! Well done!"
"D - Celebration is certainly a great IPA, but I had hoped it would be even better on tap than from the bottle. Still good, but some of the harshness around the edges is still evident."
"Drinkability: Its an IPA, would drink it for free but would not actively seek it out."
"Pleasantly drinkable. Comparable to Bell's Three hearted."
"Drinkability: Had a couple of these at the course today - couldn't resist. This is a must have every Christmas, though I don't think I could drink them forever. The bitterness/dryness is palate-wrecking and the body isn't nearly light enough. Still, a great brew!"
"This is a great IPA! Good for a newby in IPA's and great for a seasoned beer drinker. Great flavor, great look, very drinkable."
"If there was a value category this would be a 5, comes in right under $1/beer in NH. Nice to see a seasonal that isn't a winter warmer. Was expecting more from this beer after the great reviews here, left expecting more. Had this after a smoked porter, will try this again on a fresh palette."
"Since this is a seasonal beer, hoppy holidays!"
"Smell is almost all hops. Taste is similar, mostly citrusy hops, some pine as well. Just enough malt to make this one very tasty well balanced IPA. Bitter as you'd expect but not overpowering. Very smooth taste/mouthfeel. If it wasn't for the slightly high ABV I could drink a bunch of these, and I just might anyways."
"A very, maybe too balanced IPA imo. This is an alright IPA by me, but nothing that really Wow-ed me."
"Good mouthfeel. Fairly high carbonation but thick enough. As far as IPAs go this one is very drinkable. I can see how someone would claim this as a session beer."
"D: Hides the 6.8 well. Could definitely enjoy a few."
"Love this beer. IPA bitterness with a touch of malt backbone - you have to probe for the malt though - it is more apparent in the appearance. Beautiful nmouthfeel and oh so drinkable - could drink this all night. And its a bargain for the quality."
"a beautiful golden color with a foaming white head that never settles. Smell of hops and pines. Taste's of citrus and other fruit's. An awesome IPA for the winter season. I believe I may have over done it though and drank way too many but I could somewhat read my notes for a little review."
"D - For hopheads this might be a good beer. I prefer more of a malty beer but this is good."
"Drinkability: Nice beer. Its got some great flavors packed in there. Its abv is pretty high for a session beer but i can see where a lot of people would want to put a few of these puppies away."
"D - At only 6.8% abv I could drink a six pack of these without hesitation. This is a really easy to drink IPA it goes down nice and smooth."
"Good job once again Sierra Nevada!"
"One of my favorite seasonal beers - this one is awesome!"
"Methinks this to be another wonderfully drinkable ale from Sierra Nevada!"
"Overall - An excellent all-around IPA. Very complex and well balanced, yet simple enough for just pure enjoyment. A must for any hop head."
"Note- This beer even froze solid in the back of my truck and still tasted like a bitter sweet candy."
"Verdict: Simply one of the best American IPAs I've sampled yet, Celebration is certainly something I'll look for each Winter. Miles ahead of Sierra Nevada's other seasonal IPA, Anniversary Ale, this is the Sierra Nevada IPA to get."
"I am a much bigger fan of their anniversary ale. That's about it sofar. Most likely wont purchase again."
"D - I drank the first bottle so fast I didn't have time to enjoy it...so I had to go out and get an entire 6 pack...this has been one of my favorites of the season!"
"Happy holidays, everyone!"
"I originally reviewed this in Dec 2008. I noticed that they have this year's out, and so had to get it. Better than ever! Originally I said I wouldn't buy it every day? Well I was wrong. This beer is outstanding. Do yourself a favor and try it. Your tastebuds will thank you. - Nov 2009."
"Very easy to drink beer, great tastes throughout but something I think I'd prefer in the summer rather than the winter. If I were to review this as a winter beer it would be scored quite a bit lower than it is currently."
"On tap at The Brew Kettle, 2008 vintage. Pours a dark amber with a decent white head. Aroma is nutty and grain with earth notes and subdued hops. Flavor is malt, grain, wet grass and earth. Palate is ok. I have enjoyed this in the past, but now it just seems too grainy with no hops. Don't know if the recipe changed or if my palate is different. Not one I will drink again any time soon though."
"Pours a cloudy amber color with 5/4 inch head. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, sweet malt, slight earthy malt, slight floral hops, and strong wet hop. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, sweet malt, slight floral hops, and hint of wet hops. Overall, good appearance, aroma, body, and blend."
"A hazy amber color with a frothy white foam head. A big pine hop aroma,some grapefruit,and a touch of spice.Flavor is of the same piny,and citrus hops,an underbalance of sweet malt leaves a big hop flavor, with maybe a hint of rasins ,and a dry finish. A nice smooth mouthfeel ,very drinkable. A solid IPA for sure."
"I just realized this is my highest score. Its well worth it."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Ironically, I'm someone that until very recently said he liked any beer except IPA's. I stand corrected. It's a beer all about hops. My wife described it as ""bitter"" but I disagree. It tastes strongly of hops but finishes cleanly. If your not a ""hop head"" but would like to expand your horizons, I'd give it a try."
"Poured into tulip glass deep ruby amber a little hazy nice thick head - fairly tight - nice lacing. Smell - floral, hoppy. Taste - hops hit hard and citrusy grapefruit dry finish. Mouthfeel perfectly average. Drinkability - good - dry and hoppy - can't see having more than one or two."
"(rated Mar 8, 2007)"
"D - Pretty drinkable but a touch too bitter for me to dig into too many."
"Possibly a bit darker than I would expect in a IPA but for the price this is an outstanding value and wish it was not just available during the holidays."
"D=If I walked into a bar that served only IPAs, I'd be all over this."
"Mouthfeel is a little heavy for an IPA."
"Taste: Just as the smell would indicate. Hops hit you first but don't overwhelm your taste buds. Slight sweet malt ending that kicks in at the right time. Definitely can have another....and another."
"On tap poured into a mug. Pour a clear med amber color with a nice frothy 1"" head. Very strong hop aroma with hints of lemon and cedar. Again a strong hop flavor but with enough malt to not be overwhelming. 6 months ago I probably couldn't have finished this but I seem to be developing a tolerance for hops as time goes by. I still dont think I could drink more than one or two of these at a time, but overall its a nice beer"
"This beer pushes the upper range of hoppy session beers, but Im no hop head and still I believe it to be one of the best winter session beers."
"A delicious beer!"
"I really got into beer earlier this year, so this is the first year that I've been able to try Celebration Ale. To say that it didn't disappoint would be a severe understatement. I find this to be a lovely beer; I will be buying more, and soon."
"Color is just what I want - deep golden hue with tiny garnet highlights and a decent lacing and head. Smell brings flowery citrus, grapefruit rind, and snickerdoodle cookie. Flavor profile paralleing the aroma but with a quick snap of hops and a balanced, clean finish, but not dry."
"i bought a 12 pack of this 2008 and ima save 3 bottles and cellar them."
"Notes: Beware of the label if you buy this. It IS an IPA, not a winter warmer. So, if you open expecting a nice mouthful of Christmas, you're going to get a kick of hops."
"Just be wary, if you ask ""what else is out there like this," you may end up spending more time on Beer Advocate than you should."
"A very malty IPA. Pours amber with a medium white head and lots of carbonation. Aroma of sweet hops. Unusually thick mouthfeel. The taste is dominated by the malt. You can taste the hops, but the malt turns this into a thick, hoppy American Pale Ale. The only thing I can compare this beer to is like a cake with too much frosting. Its good, but you don't really get to taste the cake."
"I used to be a major hop-head, but I can feel that fading. I am wishing now that I had a malty brew to follow this one with. It is a good IPA, but not a session beer."
"Like I said before the smooth goodness makes this a really drinkable beer. So drinkable I might have to CELEBRATE with a 6pk"
"Third try of this beer (2005/2006)and it continues to be an excellent choice.A great way to Celebrate the season!"
"This holiday offering from Sierra Nevada was poured from a 12oz bottle into a clean, clear 16oz mixing (pint) glass. The appearance is more cloudy than I remember from years past, with a slightly hazy, orange color. The smell is one of alcohol, with an ABV of 6.8% There is a nice residue of brewer's lace forming along the side of the glass as well. The taste is one of a highly drinkable IPA. There is a lingering bite of hops on the tounge, and a floral finish typical of IPAs. Most Christmas beers are loaded with spices, fruits, or some other type of flavoring, but not this beer, which is nice. I also like the fact that Sierra Nevada puts the ABV on the bottle. All breweries should do this."
"Sierra Nevada always provides me with a little extra incentive to 'celebrate' during the Christmas season. I'd definitely recommend picking up at least a sixer of this seasonal when available. Even if not to age, I can assure you finishing it off fresh will be no chore. This is a wonderful beer and certainly one worth tasting at all stages of its life."
"2008. Celebration pours amber and clear with a sticky off-white head and nice lacing. The smell is pine, caramel, bitter citrus and, although this is repetitive, distinctly hoppy. The flavor is cleanly bitter with hop flavors that come through with more pine and floral strength than citrus. I'm not a big fan of their pale ale. I appreciate Sierra Nevada and their role in brewing, but it almost seems like they sacrifice some quality to pump out so much of the pale ale. The Celebration strikes me as the beer that the pale ale should be. The hops are clear, clean and bitter. There are no off-flavors and the whole package is immensely drinkable. The feel is a tad watery, but it doesn't get in the way of the flavor. Sierra Nevada is obviously capable of making great beer and lots of it. I just wish I could find this beer as easily as the pale ale and all year round. In my mind, this is the definitive American IPA against which all others should be judged."
"I think it is rightly drinkable, but fizzy yellow beer drinkers might not dig the uber acidic hops."
"This beer is great. It has generated a lot of hype this year and all of it is deserved. About as far away from your typical winter seasonal and I give SN a lot of credit for creating this gift around the holidays. Hoppy, mixed with spice and maybe a touch of cinnamon. I have been picking up this beer for the past few months and still find myself wanting more. Hopefully this will turn into a year round brew. Awesome."
"It's definitely a seasonal I look forward to each year."
"You can polish off a sixer of these during a football double-header no problem. One of the staples of craft brewery... Sierra Nevada's crowning achievement."
"Sierra Nevada Celebration has a great taste. It was the first time I got to try a this beer, and I definitely think it is a nice change from most winter seasonals."
"Drinkability: Don't know if I'll be drinking the 5 I have left over."
"Sixer from a liquor store in Dixon, CA. Pours a hazy brownish red with a short white head and sticky lacing. Caramel malt and slightly stale hop odor. Flavor is a big blast of bitter, lemony hops and sweet, biscuity malt. Bitterness lingers for a long time. Kind of sticky mouthfeel. Drinks ok, but a little boring. I've liked Celebration a lot in the past, especially on draft, but something about this year's batch or the bottling or something just isn't all that great."
"07 hits harder and finishes stronger. This beer did very well in the cellar. The 08 is very good, just not as flavorful as the 07."
"D - In my mind this is a one trick brew... Hops and lots of them being the trick... Looks great but proceeds to disappoints in all other facets... Lack complexity and isn't balanced..."
"Salud!"
"A great representative of the dry biting windy winters of parts of California and the west in general. Great stuff!"
"D: I've drunk a bunch of this and enjoyed it every single time. The high bitterness might make it difficult for me to drink a sixer but a bottle or two? No problem!"
"For the price it can't be beat and compared to a lot of the X-mas beers, this is one of the better ones. A nice effort from SN and I will buy it again next winter and hope I get something new from it. Can't wait for Bigfoot!"
"D - Very drinkable. The crispness of the hops is balanced out by the time you get to the finish, with a nice warm spiciness that enhances but not overpowers."
"Overall - Still a good beer, but not one that I will let age any longer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D - An excellent brew. I look forward to this one every year."
"Light amber in color with big, white, frothy head that leaves lacing all around. A delicious scent of citrus and hops floats around the beer, a very inviting aroma. A doughy, chewy taste reminiscent of biscuits with great hop attack to follow. A dab of pepper and spice...and BAM! the concoction is finished. A crisp dry aftertaste leaves the palate wanting more and I concede to the demand."
"This one is very hoppy, but not abrasively so. There is just enough caramel maltiness to keep the bitterness in check. For a hoppy IPA coming in at almost 7% abv this is extremely sessionable, I could drink it all night. For me this years Celebration Ale belongs to the highest tier of IPAs, its release makes Chicago winter a bit more tolerable."
"Absolutely phenomenal beer. I will be buying more of this and hopefully sharing with the family over the holidays."
"D: After hearing friends form Florida to Philly speak of Celebration Ale in the same week, I was glad to try this one out. A more genteel IPA but nevertheless perfectly balanced, throughly enjoyable and something I'll pick up a sixer of next time."
"Overall, I doubt you could find a better beer that is as easy to find across the U.S. Shame that this is a seasonal and they don't make this year round."
"D- I loved it! I could drink several of these at one session. I have heard the 2008 is less hoppy than the past years and if thats the case I would love to find a 2007! I will definatly seek this out a season long. Its a nice alternative to the winter spiced beers. Cheers!"
"Get a case to share during the holidays, but get out there and try a draft, I think you'll notice a big difference"
"Drinkability is supremely high. This might be tops among all seasonal brews for me thus far. Quality stuff."
"Drinkable if you're into hops. Great IPA, all around"
"Another great IPA. I'm really falling in love with this style. Great seasonal brew, but i could drink it year round. Second beer I have tried from sierra nevada, and I have loved both."
"MF&D - Medium bodied and slightly oily. What you would expect from a SN product."
"D: This was my first Celebration Ale in at least 10 years and it tastes much better than I remember. Good show!"
"M/D - Very easy to drink if you enjoy hops and a semi-complex flavors. A little higher in alcohol than SN's other offerings so watch out...a sixer is all you need!"
"4.4/5"
"Pours a dark amber with a gorgeous almost inch and a half of head and awesome lacing all the way down. The smell is of citrus hops and toast. The first taste to hit the tongue is the citrus hops followed by more piny hops. The malty breadyness follows almost immediately and blends with the hops with just a touch of spice to make for a nice, smooth finish. This one is just about perfect in the mouth if not just a tad heavy on the carbonation. Man I love this beer. Definitely one of the best IPAs I've had in a while and hits just right on a cold Buffalo day."
"Poured a light brown color with a lot of carbonation. It had a thick white foamy head. Nose was very hoppy and fruity, with a hint of pine. Had a very strong citrus and bitter taste. Mouthfeel was light and thin bodied almost just with some carbonation. Overall this was a decent beer to me, but not my favorite."
"Yum."
"Overall: Easily my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada. They make quality products all around but this one is a must-try."
"D: A pretty easy drinker, although I'd get sick of the aftertaste too quickly to drink a lot of them."
"D - Excellent. I'm sure I'll be drinking plenty of this while it's available."
"Incidentally, also had this from the tap (which this review is not based on). This seems to take away from the aroma, which in my opinion, really diminishes one of the more distinctive characteristics of this really good beer. Not bad, just not as good as out of the bottle, in my opinion. Still very much worth the try, especially because I'd like someone to confirm/deny this observation."
"D - The bitterness to the hops might slow down some, but I enjoy it. Smooth overall and an excellent IPA."
"D- This is a great beer.I am impressed. I am glad i saved this for my 200th review. I could go for a case of this beer. A nice session beer."
"Decent carbonation and clean finish, an overall drinker. Trying this on tap was the result of a waitress screw up (wrong beer, right result). A good effort from these guys."
"This is a favorite beer of mine. I can't make sense as to why this isn't a year round beer."
"Drinkability: Tastey IPA, very easy to drink, a quality brew for the hop-head."
"Drinkability was good but due to the 6.8% abv it could be a short session. Nice beer, surprised it was that good considering it is a year old."
"D - This one never seems to tire on the taste buds. I've had ones that I like more, but could easily stick with this one all night."
"It also went very well with Obama's election victory, but I had to sample it again recently since I did a lot of celebrating November 4, and was in no shape to write an adequate beer review. A magnificent brew."
"Drinkability: easy to have more than one at a time; nice beer, and not too heavy"
"My gripe with this beer is not that it isnt a very nice IPA, but that it simply is not a winter season beer. I just don't see any seasonal angle, any real spicyness or warmth that an Xmas ale should provide. For that reason, I'll have to give this a low drinkability score."
"Pours a nice red amber body with a nice white head. The nose is pretty floral and hoppy. A good citrus and sweetness. Taste is quite similar with a good bitterness up front and a nice caramel malt undertone. Bitterness lasts into the aftertaste. Fairly low carbonation. Good beer on tap but I'd like a touch more hop flavor to balance the bitteness."
"I'll be getting some more of these."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. It's a nice departure from the traditional 'Winter Warmer' seasonal (not that there's anything wrong with them!) for this time of year. It's a quality beer, but I don't necessarily see anything that stands out about it. That being said, it's a high-quality IPA, and one that I'd recommend to anyone who likes hops."
"A 2008 version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. The snowy country scene on the bottle is encircled by an arrangement of poinsettias. The beer pours a nice amber color with an impressively stubborn and sticky head that left lacing throughout. The aroma signals the hops about to be consumed. Citrus, pine, and herbal round out the bouquet. When the beer is cold, hops assault the palate in a very impressive, enjoyable way with floral bitterness and citrus acidity. As the beer warms a nutty and bready malt character emerges to provide balance to the hoppy onslaught. Warm or cold the beer is a pleasant experience. The medium bodied ale flows across palate and leaves a dry lingering bitterness. As the beer vanishes you can start to feel a warmness in your chest, reminding you that this is winter beer after all. If you have a vessel containing Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale in your hand, celebrate, celebrate indeed."
"Cant believe i have never reviewed this one. Pours a clear amber orange in color with a 3 finger fluffy head and some great lacing. The smell is very hoppy with mostly lemon citrus hops coming through a bit of pine and some grainy malts. The flavor is is bitter with citrus flavor and a medium malt profile for the style, nothing out of the ordinary everything is just right for and American IPA. The mouthfeel is a bit heavy and it drinks like almost 7% however I could and have sessioned this one. A very good example of the style."
"Drinkability: I can't usually drink more than 2 IPAs or so in a sitting and this one is no exception. That being said, this is still an enjoyable, complex, and pretty hoppy beer that is affordable and fairly common. Recommended."
"D: Great beer as long as you like IPAs and can handle a very hoppy beer."
"m/d - Light mouthfeel considering the big flavor which makes for nice drinkability. Feels stronger than 6.8%, makes for a nice drink on a cold night."
"The stronger flavor means sipping this one a little slower than a regular SNPA. A good wintertime brew"
"Great stuff..."
"Mouthfeel is just a touch thin for me, but not a big deal as this is a surprisingly drinkable IPA for a dryer IPA (not my favorite type)."
"This year's version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is one hoppy holiday ale. It is copper in color with a nice smooth, creamy off white head. There are a ton of citrus-like hops coming off of the nose. This beer tastes like an IPA should. I love the amount of bitterness. It seems like the right amount and makes for good drinkability. There are also some spices to go along with the citrus hop flavor and it has a nice full, crisp feel. I really dig this beer."
"D= very high. over all it's a great beer, the hoppy taste to it reminds me a lot of the surly's furious that I enjoy so much. Very nice replacement for anyone who is not in the surly's area. Great beer love it"
"D - I like it and think it would also be good with food or all its own."
"Full and smooth and easy drinking."
"Overall I'd drink this any day of the week from a bottle or a tap."
"D - This one is definitely made for the hopheads, which I am not. When I think holiday beers, I envision something a bit more malty with spices. But this is more like chewing on a branch off the Christmas tree. But it's an interesting brew, and worth a try if you're looking for a bitter winter brew."
"This is a great change of pace for the holiday season. When everyone else throws out Old Ales and Strong Ales, SN puts out an IPA. The deep amber color and the amazing fresh hoppy aroma is very inviting. The hops are balanced by a nice malt backbone. Slight spice notes are also present."
"D: Will probably get several packs of this, affordable, yet containing quality hops unable to be matched with a macro-microbrew."
"2008 vintage - fresh. This poured a clear copper with fluffy tan head. It smelled like orange and grapefruit hops with a bit of creamy malt. It tasted like strong grapefruit hops with pine and copper, and a bit of caramel malt and mulled spices. More of the spices came out as it warmed. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall (fresh) this was very similar to Sierra Nevada's regular Pale Ale. It was fairly clean and easy to drink. It had nice body and a good flavor. I could see the flavor developing nicely with age, as the hops fade some, and the spices and malt become bolder."
"D_This beer is spicy and overwhelming; I couldn't drink more than a couple"
"This is my first winter type beer that I picked up, seems like I should pick up some others to compare."
"One of my favorite seasonal Sierra Nevada brews. It's been about a year since I had this beer last, and I actually forgot all about it. I came home from a long day of driving and it was in the fridge when I got back. A very good beer overall, I'd like it to have a stronger smell though, but that's me nit-picking. Very good beer."
"Taste: Flavor of grapefruit, citrus peel, and pine. Probably multiple kinds of hops used. Definitely a deep complex hoppy brew."
"Pours a wonderful foamy and rocky head. Gold and copper color. Aroma is very fruity and wonderful. Tasty and sweet with just the right snap of hops too. Wonderful example of a California ale a benchmark in taste of the West. Highly recommended. Wish it was available all year long."
"Reviewed on: 11-27-2008 02:12:57"
"I release that I look forward to every year. Reliably delicious and quite drinkable makes it a wonderful compliment to any Holiday festivity."
"Sierra Nevada Brewing is the new American King of Beers IMO! Long live the King!!!"
"D: This is a pretty good IPA, but not amazing. There are better, even from Sierra Nevada."
"An excellent IPA - the other reviewers are not wrong. I would have liked a tad more malt presence but the quality of the flavours coming from the hops is high enough for that to be a minor concern. Thanks Shawn for sharing!"
"2009 Edition - Just had my first 2009 and as good as I remember. I bought a six pack, I think I will run out and grab a case. An excellent beer!"
"Poured a beautiful lightly clouded amber with medium thick head and fair retention. It smelled of citrus and sweet. The taste matched the smell with heavy hops and a bit of cracker taste on the end. The mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation and is very drinkable. I will have this again."
"Celebration Ale looks great with its amber / orange color, full head and beautiful lacing (some of the best I've seen). I like the smell of this beer too - citrus dominates with some spicy undertones. The taste is a bit ""meh"" to me - nothing to celebrate - hop bitterness and not much else. It has a medium mouthfeel and decent drinkability."
"Classy, classy winter brew from Sierra Nevada. Though I love my winter warmers malty and spiced, I can really appreciate a full hopped beer that is crisp and clean. Most winter beers can only make it past maybe two glasses before I'm in need of hop relief, but this beer is sessionable and sociable. Bring a 12 pack over to my place and lets get bent!"
"D: Could the label be more holiday seasonal? Never judge a beer by it's label! This beer befuddles me. Maybe it's the dry hopping that does it but it has all of the big smell and big taste without the over aggressiveness. Hoppiness makes for a nice uplifting festive drink. It's not a show-off. Just an incredibly solid and phenomenally drinkable IPA. Thank goodness I got a case!"
"D- very drinkable beer, like i said in the smell and taste, odd taste for a christmas beer, but very good"
"o:the bitterness decreases drinkability. not your typical holiday beer. hop aroma, flavor and malt impression are too far buried for me. i enjoyed this beer but i wasnt craving the next taste. i would appreciate a more delicate bittering hop or either more balance."
"This beer is one of my all time favorites. I am a hop-head and this fills my need for hops. Sierra Nevada does a great job with this brew year in and year out. Highly recommended to all hop-heads."
"Had this one on tap at RFD in DC after a bad Bell's Cream Stout that they kindly exchanged. I'm a huge fan of this beer - one of my go-to IPAs, which is one of my go-to styles. Appearance is great, nice copper-amber color with a solid finger of head that leaves excellent lacing as it drains. Nose is tons of fruity citrus bitterness, which rolls beautifully into the well-balanced flavor. Certainly a hoppy beer, but not a monster by any means, as there's a nice malt backbone in there to keep everything even. Body is thick and creamy with great carbonation. This is one I'll keep going back to, an excellent IPA."
"Drinkability - I could have a few, I think. This bottle went fairly quickly, and I was trying to savor it as much as possible(it's my only bottle). It would probably be pointless to follow this up with something that wasn't hoppy, though."
"Very agressive pour from 12oz bottle into 16oz DFH tumbler has me running for papertowels because of the slight overpour. Inch and 1/2,light tan colored head pillows the glass leaving behind some quality lace. Color is a burnt bronze color, fairly transparent with good carbonation. S-Piney resiny hops, Orange peel, grapefruit and maybe a touch of honey from the malt at the end. Taste & mouthfeel is phenomenal, big hop profile on this beer from start to finish. Grapefruit is there as well with Sort of a soapy, piney finish leaving a delicious tangy aftertaste. Drinkability is also superb, This is certainly a sessionable beer due to the reasonable ABV especially for the colder months. I have tried this beer on several occasions within the last few years, but I never appreciated it as much as I do now. This is a top notch IPA that is a must try for anyone who enjoys great beer!"
"Not to much carbonation in the mouth which is nice and makes this beer dangerously drinkable."
"This beer is nothing short of FANTASTIC. For 13 bucks for a 12pk it's a steal. This is what an IPA should taste like."
"D - Easy to drink and kind of enjoyable but nothing really special"
"Pours a beautiful copper color with incredible clarity and an equally impressive head that leaves thick and abundant lace. The appearance is easily this beer's best aspect. The aroma is immensely and wonderfully of fresh hops! Smells like pine trees. Not a lot of malt comes through in the aroma, which is a minor knock. The taste is similar to the nose. The Celebration is packed with an extremely fresh hop character. It has a lot of pine and some resin characters that make it pretty enjoyable. The only downside is that I don't find anything overly special in the hop/IPA aspect of this beer. It's missing something that I cannot put my finger on. Anyway, wonderful beer overall though. It's definitely much better on tap than in the bottle from my experience."
"Excellent holiday beer. Nice copper amber pour and floral aroma. good malt balance as well. Gives you that hoppy after taste that lingers until you brush your teeth and rinse with scope. Overall a very drinkable beer. I was very excited to see this one at my local beer store."
"Drinkability: Eminently drinkable. ABV might be slightly high to make this a session beer, but I want to drink one after another. The hops give it a very satisfying crispness. I wish SN made this year-round."
"Overall, a very nice holiday brew from Sierra Nevada. Low cost + fresh hops + balanced taste = quality IPA."
"I would be happy to have a few of these, excellent lingering aftertaste. The alcohol will sneak up on you though."
"I would recommend this beer as a pretty decent seasonal beer."
"excellent overall drinkability. this is definitely one of the more hop forward winter beers, and one of my favorites."
"Great stuff and plan to get another six pack. Get yours before they are gone and you will have to wait till next year."
"This is a must have for the holiday season. Nice head, and copper color. The aroma is hoppy but more malty, surprisingly. Taste of piney hops with a touch of bitterness, and a malt undertone. This beer is something I look forward to year after year. Christmas in a bottle!"
"Overall, a very good IPA. It's got just enough spice and character to make it feel like a winter beer."
"kind of hop oily"
"Overall, this is a staple. A great beer from Sierra Nevada and a must try. I would recommend this beer to anyone."
"D: This is a great beer for hop heads. Not a favorite style of mine but it is well done."
"This is called an ale but almost tastes and smells like an IPA. This beer poured a nice copper color. Smells of biscuit malt and grassy hops. Tastes VERY NICE; similar to how it smells. Sweet malt up front with a good amount of grapefruit flavor following shortly after. There's a good amount of wet bitterness at the end. Mouth feel was somewhat on the thin side, but still quite acceptable. Not a lot of carbonation. Overall, an incredible beer. I really wish the would be available daily. Apa is a good and reliable style, but i never had one i found was a incredible beer, until i had this one."
"I'm looking forward to the first 5-year parallel this year...using up the last of the '04 and '05 batch through '08."
"2008 - Tried my first one last night, and I was expecting a typical kinda spice laden winter brew. Wrong in spades! Pours a nice copper color, with a very nice head. Nose is all hops. A slightly heavier body than most IPA's, but the hop sting is fantastic, a very well balanced and conceived IPA. It's also nice the ABV is less than 7' upping the drink ability factor IMO. I'm going to stock the fridge with this brew thru the holidays, and another great offering from a very solid brewery."
"Overall drinkability. Exceptional. What Sierra Nevada has done here rivals anything else in the U.S. for a great beer."
"Overall a great American IPA, with that wonderful American hop presence, and while unoffensive and fairly tame in alcohol content, not imminently drinkable, and a bit more maltiness would be welcome in a holiday seasonal. Still, this is a superb example of its style and a solid seasonal offering from a solid American brewing icon."
"Nice mouthfeel good carbonation. I could drink these things all night long, great beer. I'm glad I bought two sixers"
"This is a great IPA! Really enjoyed it! The pine and resinous hops dominate everything, but it is there in balance with the malt. The flavor profile really is great for the holiday season."
"Ding Ding Ding!"
"Comments- I will buy as much of this as I can while it's around. It's interesting- based on some forum posts, this year's batch seems to be highly variable. Some people get a malty aroma; some people note a dominant hop aroma. Mine had a maltier nose with a big hop taste and a looong hop finish. Just great."
"overall a flawless example of an ipa, two hearted is the only beer that comes close to it in this style."
"D-Great drinkability. Smooth and bitter, an overall well-balanced brew!"
"D - This is a damn good drinkable beer and that's scary at 6.8%. I have a case of this in the pantry ready to get me through the winter."
"So far, my favorite beer of this winter season."
"Picked up a sixer after reading such good things about this on BA. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a copper color, slightly darker than what I'd expect with an IPA. Finger thick head that settled down quickly. Smells slightly hoppy with some citrus tones. Not a very powerful aroma compared to other IPA's I've had, but still smells pretty good. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, some stick, medium bodied. Oddly, the taste is a lot more robust than the aroma. Starts off slightly malty with citrus, followed up by a real nice hop taste...REAL nice. The hops and citrus linger for a bit and bitterness rounds out the taste. Drinks really well and goes down easy. This is why I love BA...I'm not a huge fan of winter seasonals and would not have bought this had I not read the commentary on BA. This an excellent IPA. Then again, I expect nothing less from Sierra Nevada."
"The 2008 version is a well-balanced winner. I tried last season's on tap and couldn't taste anything more than the hops. Perhaps they toned it down this year, or my palate has become more refined...either way this is one fine, very drinkable seasonal."
"I think I should also mention that I used to live in Chico a few years ago and never heard a bad thing about Celebration Ale. Well, in 2005 I decided to give it a shot with my friend so we went out and bought a case to last for the weekend. Being in college and new to beer we absolutely hated it because of the huge hop presence and ended up giving half the case away to others. Know what to expect when you're buying this beer; it's an IPA and a robust one at that! Now in 2008 I've tried it again, and after expanding my palate for these last 3 years I can say that this is an excellent beer!"
"d: a high quality beer that I would drink again and wouldn't mind having more of, though it's overall more bitter than I like (I've tried to balance this in my score since I usually find American IPA's to be like that)."
"This came as part of a mixed six pack down at Mr. Bones in Greensburg. I poured the 12 oz. bottle into my tasting snifter. It poured with a nice foamy head with little retention. The color was a medium ruby, almost crystal clear. The aroma was packed with hops, and citrus notes. The taste was very reminiscing of Sierra Nevada's Pale ale...lots of hops, a good amount of bitterness, and smooth malt notes in the background. A very enjoyable beer brewed with the holiday seasons in mind."
"This beer pours a nice coppery almost brownish red color with a two finger head with an off white head that is nice a frothy and creates lasting lacing on the glass. As for the aroma it gives off a nice smell of hops with a hint of citrus and spices. As for the taste, this IPA has a nice medium bodied, hoppy taste going for it. The spices and citrus get all mixed up creating a nice IPA. Barely bitter at all, the beer has a great drinkability and mouthfeel to it. It's not what i expected, thought it would be more spicy, but it was a great beer anyways. Glad i tried this one."
"Drinkability: One gulp begs another. Flavor that hugs the tongue both sates and awakens -- strong signature without overdubbed hops or gimmicks. This is a memorable beer that comes around every November and weathers a clean session every time."
"D: For being a higher ABV, fuller bodied IPA, it actually goes down quite smoothly. I drank it in gulps, not sips, and my glass emptied quickly. SN definitely created a beer that would facilitate some Christmas cheer quite quickly."
"If you see it buy it,, I had the 2008 and it was worth every cent."
"Drinkability: Tastes good, good mouthfeel. Clean finish. All the characteristics of drinkability to me."
"From a 12 oz bottle purchased locally. A deep gold, almost amber with a rocky off-white head about an inch. Crystal clear. Aroma is full of American hops, grapefruit and pine. Bitter, but balanced. Malt is toasty and grainy. Hop flavor is again full of grapefruit and pine note. Medium bodied, not too carbonated. Balanced, smooth, easy drinking and very tasty."
"A really awesome beer that goes down well in the wintertime. Huge hop presence with a ton of taste. Definitely could drink this year round."
"Notes: What's with people thinking this is gonna be some spiced winter warmer?"
"D: Not at all a bad offering, but rather plain compared to other examples. Very drinkable, but does not stand out from the pack, nor does it stand out from other SN beers."
"D: Very drinkable, like an early Christmas for a hop-head. Loved the previous years? Then you will love this years offering."
"D-I could drink this all year."
"Pours a rich reddish-golden with a fine-bubbled, yellowish off-white head. Strong aroma is hoppy and has an undertone of spices. Flavor is richly hoppy with an evergreen undertone and nutty and spicy hints as well as a touch of apple. Texture is smooth and tingly, and finish is hoppy and fruity."
"Not one of my favorite IPAs. I prefer more sweetness balanced with hops. It will please the hop lovers well."
"Being that Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is one of my all time favorites, I had to give this one a shot. I was not disappointed. Great foam, just the way I like it, not too airy and the bubbles were very uniform. A strong hoppy flavor with a bite, no bad after taste. For a strong ale it goes down pretty easy. I was a little disappointed that it was too similar to the regular pale ale. I mean if you're going to make a special brew I thought it should be much more different than what it was. It's also not for your beginner beer drinker, the flavor will be too strong for you and too bitter."
"(2010) Mostly clear orange with lots of fine sediment, fluffy two finger head, half inch sticks around. Smell: floral, resinous, citrus peel, pine in that order; slight house yeast charcter, lightly bready and sweet. Taste: resiny, oily, caramel and pine, fades into a splash of grapefruit, mild graininess. Mouthfeel: damn near perfect, medium fluffy body, prickly, drying fights with residual hop oils. Exceptional. Bottled 9/24 (6 wks old). (4/4/4.5/4.5/4)"
"Oh my oh my! This 2008 batch poured a delightful coppery amber with a bit of light tan head. It smelled of rich, sweet hops. In the mouth it doesn't feel too thick and the bitterness can begin to be sensed. The taste isi wonderous! A crisp, hard hop bite while remaining quite sweet and piney as well. It finishes with bitter hops which leave a great flavor behind. Very drinkable and the 6.8% isn't noticable at all..at first. This is a great IPA which I think I'll be stocking up as my winter sipper of choice so far! YUM! Highly recommend!"
"It really great to see a good hoppy beer clock in at less than 7%. Too bad it's seasonal."
"I always look forward to this one: my favorite SN brew. This year's pours a deep orange with some yeasty cloudiness; the head's three fingers high and leaves nice lacing down the sides -- good retention. The smell is pine with some malt and citrus. The taste starts with some biscuit notes, moving though rich malts and some diacetyls to a sharp hop bite with lots of juniper and tangelo; the alcohol is masked for at least the first few sips. It's nicely carbonated, not too overpowering, and fills the mouth well. It's all too easy to drink: you have to watch it with this one. A fine, enjoyable IPA."
"induce a fever with this to get out of your family holiday party, throw away your yule log and make room for another fridge, go outside in your underwear and shove snow in your crotch, bite an ice cream cone with your sad, deteriorating front teeth, wait to take a dump for 2 days until that cold feeling comes... none of it matters, just keep drinking this!"
"Overall, this has to be one of the best IPA's I've had."
"Will be comparing soon side by side with the 2007."
"This celebration ale has great aroma but is very bitter, even for an IPA. This is a good attempt at a Winter Ale that comes across as an IPA in disguise, but its almost as if it tries to be something that its not. Better than last year, but not great."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy orange brown with a medium sized white head that sticks around the entire glass. The nose is hoppy still, nothing foul going on here. The hop character yes has mellowed somewhat in the taste, but its still got plenty of bite. The spices have died down to a balancing,mild intensity and the malt profile is way higher than i remember it being. The nutmeg and cinnamon are intensified on the finish by loads of spicy hops. the hops live on indeed!! reminds me more of a winter beer now actually. Medium bodied and very drinkable."
"Drink this beer at cellar temperature and it will be one of the highlights of the season."
"This years (2008) batch. Pours a clearer amber/copper color than from '07. Couldn't say there was any head here. Good carbonation, and the same lacing throughout. A little less citrus/grapefruit aroma from the '07, more of a hoppy aroma. Taste is not too strong with hops,some citrus/grapefruit present. No bitter aftertaste. 2007 is a tad better, but I would still recommend and drink this years edtion."
"very drinkable especially for IPA fans"
"Overall, I'm glad I bought this beer. It's only my second experience with Sierra Nevada and I'll definitely be back for more of their beers!"
"HV"
"The drinkability is good and does not feel like a close to 7% beer. I definitely could drink a few of these in a night and have a great evening."
"Not much aroma detected, and the initial feel is watery. But the beer comes back strong, with a nice hoppy bitterness. It is balanced a bit by a bit of malt sweetness, but still is mainly the hops that dominate, and not much else. Still pretty good for all that."
"Pours a dark red/ golden color. A decent head stays a while and tries to lace. Smells of spiced hops and light malts. The taste follows the same suit, a very bitter big hop flavor up front that bites at the tongue, then finishes with an easier malt flavor in the background. Mouth wasn't so pleasent with the hop bite, and drinkability wouldn't have lasted long, I did not want another. I guess I was just expecting something else, this isn't my style of beer."
"I think I appreciate this beer more this year than I did last year."
"D: I couldn't pound these all night, but I would rather just slow down and enjoy 'em anyway."
"a very drinkable beer no indication of the high abv and a really smooth finish"
"Appearance has a dark amber hue with a nice pillowy head. Smell of seasonal type bread with spice, malt and hops. Taste is of sweet malts, pine, citrus and a good amount of hops. Mouthfeel has a good medium body that goes down slick. Hats off to Sierra Nevada, this is a great seasonal to be had."
"the carbonation could be a bit more subtle, but I think the body is pefect for an IPA. this is highly drinkable and a true hop-heads delight. I am a winter seasonal fan and think this beer has a little bit of a winter feel."
"Drinkability - Overall, I feel that this is a very good IPA. I would seek this beer out again. However, I do enjoy a stronger bite but the clean and crisp taste of a recently made beer says a lot. I really appreciate how ""new"" this beer tastes."
"D- This is one extremely well made IPA. It's definitely sessionable even though it shouldn't be. Be careful with this one."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Very clean and hop-forward. Citrus and tobacco, notes of grapefruit being particularly strong. Fairly light bodied for being near 7%, and perfectly dry for the style, but the hop flavor could use a bit more oomph - it's good, but not enough to make me celebrate. In any case, I'll have no trouble finishing my six pack."
"Drinkability is high. It's a great IPA, really tasty and makes you want more. Definitely an easy drinker and a pleasure to have."
"D: A drinkable beer, to be sure. Lots of character and a well done taste."
"this is a very drinkable beer, great job sierra nevada!"
"Again a big thanks to HimerMan who was so generous he stuck this in as a freakin extra!"
"D: High...I wish I picked up a 6 pack."
"D: This year's batch seems much more drinkable than I remember last year's (2007) being. Maybe my tastes are just evolving. I had no problem polishing off the six-pack in an evening."
"Drinkability - Very high. I'm always anxious for Sierra's seasonal releases. Celebration 2008 does not disappoint. Hops fans will be lining the trunk with cases this year."
"2008 Bottle. This is one bitter beer, copper in color with thick foam on top. Beer smells strong of hops and pine needles. The beer tastes piney, a bit citrusy and fairly maltl.ke. The mouthfeel is fairly sudsy. Overall I'd say its fairly drinkable for a bitter beer and a quaility beer for those who enjoy bitters."
"Crisp clear coppery brown, with a pillow soft head that lasts. Smells like hops, citrus and pine, tastes the same, which is good, its a damn fine IPA. Light and crisp on the tongue and its not a hard thing to drink several in a sitting, great drinkability."
"Taste is hop filled and bitter, but the hops seem to me a bit subdued more than the usual IPA. I catch more of a fruity vibe to it than the basic IPA and the bitterness seems to last through the swallow (in a good way). I'm finding this beer hard to review because the beer is almost too good to savor at all. Great work SA."
"Note: 2008 Release...."
"Have been drinking this beer for years now; it's a perennial favorite I have to say. While my taste in beer has changed over the years, this beer continues to delight. An absolute classic from Sierra Nevada."
"Copper orange with dense rocky head and tons of fine particulates floating around. I love unfiltered IPAs and this looks like the best of em. The lacing on this thing is incredible as it quickly leaves my glass. Did I really drink this much in only a few minutes?? Nice citrusy aroma, orange, lemonpeel, grapefruit, pine. It has all you need, but there's always room for more. Very nice caramel flavor with citrus hop blast that makes me pucker up. Grapefruit and pine are present, which I like, good use of caramel malts, semisweet at first, but dry on the finish. It's pretty much everything you want and need out of an IPA. Creamy, smooth, yumm. Balanced and delicious. Probably the most drinkable IPA I've come across. Why is this not year round??? Well done SN."
"D: It's not the most balanced brew around, but it's very very tasty. Certainly drinkable despite the ABV. It's a festive, aggressive holiday IPA."
"D: Night before Halloween is a celebration in and of itself. As previously established, hundreds of times over, this is an amazingly drinkable beer. Great anytime but especially from All Hallow's Eve through New Years."
"Drinkability: I can drink these till the cows come home. I didn't think I'd be as impressed as I was but I am, a great tasting beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Tasty brew, but I'm not sure why this recipe would be their winter seasonal. Caught somewhere between a strong ale and an IPA this one has a great medium hop profile, but a generous amount of additional malts could take this through the roof. Mild bitterness to the nose, floral and light fruits backed with some light caramel malt. Copper pour with an amber/red tint, medium head and lacing. Good drinkability but it's thin. Spicy taste with a great hop balance. This warms the body and mellows the mind, it's a nice drink but I was expecting more complexity."
"Overall, a nice IPA, but the bitterness/lack of malty notes leaves balance a bit lacking."
"Celebration comes from the tap sporting a tan cap over a burnished orange-brown body. Strong aromas and flavors of piney, citric hops - smooth, easy drinking with a huge hop presence that manages to avoid over bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little below the supremacy of the other characteristics, but the overall experience is wonderful."
"I poured this into a pilsner glass pretty fast, the head was a very nice light tan color about 3 fingers. I immediately smelled a great aroma of grapefruit and other citrus. It also taste a bit like grapefruit. The lacing was minimal. There is a nice balance of flavor and carbonation, I dont really like IPA's but could drink this all night for some reason. It is strong but not overdone. Overall I think its a great american IPA and I would purchase it again."
"Conclusion - Buy this beer. It's a wonderful offering of the beer gods, and like we all know, Sierra Nevada doesn't disappoint, and this years Celebration Ale, is proof of that statement."
"Drinkability- I could sit down with a sixer of this during the Holidays and forget that I'm hanging around a bunch of insane relatives. I've had Celebration with age on it, and it just doesn't do it justice, in my opinion. Drink it fresh, and drink a lot of it. This is a wonderful, drinkable, affordable IPA."
"It seems a bit less malty and a bit lighter in color than previous years, althought the color could be attributed to my weak memory, and the malt may just be drowned out by the incredible hop power that this bottle has fresh. I'm not sure I've had the pleasure of having one quite this fresh in years past. Regardless, a beautiful ale, and one of my favorites from Sierra."
"D: Great winter session beer. Can't wait to find a great sale (like 9.99 a 12pack) and stock up the spare room!!"
"If you like Sierra Nevada Pale ale, you will like this."
"Great Ale. Got it in a 6 and poured it into my fav. glass. The color was very good and dark copper. Smells like a great hoppy beer with slight pine overtones. As far as xmas goes I am happy to be hoppy! Overall I would give this beer a shot if you can find it."
"Purrrrty copper tones with a frothy head. The hop oils release an appetizing aroma of citrus and pine. The hop resins pack a bit of a bite at first with high bitterness, but it quickly settles down to produce a wonderful taste. Alcohol is nowhere to be found and the mouthfeel is well balanced. Very drinkable. I really have no qualms with Celebration, other than its misleading holiday label and its unwillingness to venture away from the norms of IPAs in taste. It is, however, a textbook example of the style."
"This one was sort of a hoppy step above a pale ale but not to the IPA level. Good brew, however the winter time label threw me off."
"Overall: worth the time"
"10/28/2004. Just sampled this on draft. Wish it was a year round choice. I'm impressed. Dark copper color with a relatively thick head and nice lacing. Sweet citrus hoppy flavor, some pine with a crisp bitter bite. Released for the Christmas season, again I'd drink this year round."
"Then again,a cold night would beg to differ."
"I love this beer. Furthermore, I'm of the opinion that the different parts of a beer need to be judged in relation to each other and the whole... and this beer is thoroughly harmonious."
"Celebration pours a hazy orange-amber color. After some vigorous shaking of the bottle a sticky one inch off-white head lasts and leaves its trail. Smells of malt sweetness (some sugary fruit (apple) and caramel), slightly boozy peppery spice, and a light grapefruit and even slighter soapy hop presence still lingers; likely subdued over two years of aging. An effervescent, tasty, ever-present, lingering, spicy hop profile hits the palate first, though certainly not overwhelming. No real bitterness just a spiciness that is tamer than your average pale ale, but is fun and warming. I was expecting some heavy malt; but really just a light, almost fruity sweetness exists -- notes of juicy apple, and toffee. This beer is not overly complex only a few dominant flavors exist, but it is fun and fits the winter warmer style nicely. Easy to drink, no alcohol is recognized on the palate, and no off flavors."
"D: The 6.8 alcohol is well hidden but noticed in the aftertaste. A good beer to enjoy a few of; however, the strong aftertaste would prevent me from having too many."
"D. COuld drink these all night, a delight to find on tap."
"This beer looks and smells great, but the lingering aftertaste made finishing the growler a bit of a chore."
"D- the smell alone would make me want to have another, and the taste is almost as good. as i said before, i cant wait to have the freshest one i can. n"
"Growler from Consumer Beverages. Amber with a decent white head. Very spicy aroma which carries over into the taste. Lots of pine and citrus. The malts and hops are really well balanced in this. As it warms up it gets nice and resiny. This a great beer to enjoy anytime of the year."
"D : It's ok, would have prefered better balance in it but it's drinkable."
"For its ABV, its pretty sessionable and great for those chilly winter days. The spiciness not only exists on the palate, but also in the aroma. For IPA lovers, this is a great alternative to your standard hop blast."
"Having this in summertime is such a delight. It makes me want to have winter come real soon."
"Final Statement: Not one of my favourite SN offerings, but any SN offering is bound to be superb, which this is."
"D- This and summerfest are my two favorite offerings from Sierra Nevada. If you are a fan of IPAs, or like their pale ale but want a bit more definitely check this out. I wonder why this is only offered seasonally. The flavor is incredible."
"The astringency from the hops deteriorating kinda take away from the mouthfeel and drinkability here. Still a top notch beer and better than many other brewer's IPAs. I definitely prefer the fresher version and can't wait 'til this year's batch."
"Really balanced, verging on double IPA. Tasty stuff. I'll be looking for the '08 this winter."
"Copper color with patchy head. Pungent odor. Decent taste with unpleasant, metallic aftertaste. It has a strange head. definetly a winter beer, why? I don't know. I would definetly categorize it as an IPA. Very hoppy nose. not my favorite from Sierra Nevada."
"I could easily drink a bunch of these."
"It's still such a good beer, but I liked the 2006 version better. And that's strange because 2006 was considered by many to be an off year. But I think it had a better malt profile to it than the '07's. Still a very drinkable and well crafted IPA."
"D: Something I'd like to have another of, but there was only one available where I was. Might need to look into what is still around at other locations, and perhaps try cellaring a couple."
"This is the last Celebration Ale I have for this year, I've had this particular beer now for about 4 months. Poured into a pub glass. Very nice reddish tan color with one finger of sandy colored head, good retention and lacing. Smells of piney hops, very appropriate for a holiday seasonal. The taste was just as expected for a traditional American IPA, malty up front with a hoppy dry finish. Very drinkable at 6.8% ABV, a good saesonal selection. Cheers."
"Straightfoward flavor. Solid malt/hop balance, very good representation of a American IPA, export to Canada please!"
"D: A very drinkable beer. Excellent combination of smooth mouthfeel and balanced taste makes this an IPA that is easy to drink and enjoy."
"This is always a steady and sound choice for winter seasonals. Balance is quite good, but the hops make enough of a presence to intimate its style."
"poured near-brown from 12 oz. bottle. smell is nice, citrusy hops are pleasant. the alcohol is perhaps too noticeable in the palate, but its a nice hop/malt balance. because of the strong taste, it may not be appealing past the first couple, but it really is a wonderful tasting beer."
"Damn..."
"D: A highly drinkable IPA. A different take on winter/holiday ales, which tend to go the spicy, old, or barleywine route. Good stuff."
"Overall drinkability is good. I have always had a good opinion of Sierra Nevada, for 12-13 yrs. I think this stuff is another solid offering."
"I didnt learn of the wonders of the SN Celebration until late this winter and by then I couldnt find it anywhere in Nashville. Figured I would just have to wait until next year but I ended up in California last week and stumbled across a shop that had some around. Lucky me. One of the best beers I have had."
"A superb seasonal beer I religiously stock my fridge with when it's offered."
"Overall, this is a nice beer. Very drinkable and sessionable. Wish I had more in my fridge!"
"Pours a murky brown/orange with great white head that lingers like a fart in a phone booth. good lace. Nose is west coast hops. Taste follows, but the impressive part here is the balance. The malts are as present here as the hops, while the hops are still very much in yer face. Awesome flavor, and great hearty yet drinkable flavor. Mouthfeel is great here, and drinkability is fantastic. A wonderful session beer, and one that is a defenite go to."
"Mouthfeel is medium, but the carbonation gives off a poor impression and it is less lively than I would have hoped. Drinkability is very high for the style and abv, which can be attributed to the beer being well balanced. This isn't a pure hop fix as other IPAs are, but serves as a refreshing and enjoyable winter respite from the over the top and in your face big beers found during these colder months."
"The drink had a blood-red amber appearance with great lacing. Sharp malts and spices were sensed as the main aromas from this one. It overall had a pretty malty taste, but there was a sourish-bitter aftertaste to it that seemed off. A great carbonation helps this drink and gives it a good punch. However, that bitterness cannot be masked by the mouthfeel, so its drinkability is hindered."
"Wonderfully drinkable. I can see myself drinking through the cases I have pretty quickly."
"Medium body with ample fizz. A very delicios beer indeed. Ages well."
"Great beer. I try to hold on to a few until the next batch comes out. Actually I held onto one from 2005 and drank it recently. Still tasted great. Although some years are better than other years."
"On tap into a shaker pint glass. Very nice amber/ red color with nice cream colored head. Good aroma of fruity/ tangy hops. Not what I expected. It does not have the look of a ipa, rather a maltier beer. The malt comes out after the first couple of sips, after the bitter hop flavor dies down a bit. Great medium bodied beer. Have had them for probably the last 6 or 7 winters and finally really appreciating this beer."
"If you don't understand the appeal of hoppy beers, this one will not be the one to explain it to you."
"A nice spiciness hits the nose at first, followed by some nice floral notes. Something was a bit off in the smell, though. The hops may have started degrading since this beer is about 5+ months old. It has held up rather well, though. Bitter spiciness hits the tounge with the first sip, followed by a nice malty back bone. It ends with some nice alcoholic warmth. Nice and bubbly with a medium body and a crisp finish. The SNPA is one of my go-to beers, and I really did grow to love this one as well during the holiday season. I look very forward to 2008's offering."
"Props to SN for putting out a different seasonal to keep things interesting for the holidays! I love how they get out very quality brews at very reasonable prices. One of the factors that makes this a very drinkable brew. Keep them coming!"
"D- Decent beer, moderate ABV... I had two, not sure I would have another. If the recipe was revamped, I could go for it."
"D-Didnt impress me but goes down easily and is not a bad beer by any means, its not for me though."
"Overall - An in your face, well hopped APA. Superb and appealing cascade lead, hop blast. Contrary to the comments, I find this beer quite unbalanced, not enough malt and body to balance the hops. I prefer the anniversary ale as an APA."
"well, I have to say I always thought this was a winter warmer since of the time of year that it was and is always released, I had no idea until I came here and tasted this doosey that is in fact an american ipa, darker color though than your usual ipa and not quite as hoppy as some of the northwest hophead blasters."
"D-This is a very nice and refreshing IPA. It doesn't ""wow"" me-as this year's Anniversary Ale did...but its still pretty darn good. Nice offering by Sierra Nevada."
"I can drink this anytime of year... love the flavor, love the feel...but it alway reminds me of winter and Xmas, since that is when I usually consume this great brew from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co."
"D: Honestly this was my first true seasonal xmas brew. I have six hiding till next year, and I can't wait to try them then."
"Pours a crisp orange with a decent frothy head that leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is an abundance of citrus and pine hops with some sweet malt and a hint of caramel. Taste is also a nice blend of hops and sweet malt. The beer is on the light side of medium and the alcohol is fairly well hidden. This is one of my winter favorites and I am always sure to have plenty on hand when it comes out."
"I last enjoyed this a year ago on-tap, so I'm excited to retry it, this time from the bottle. The pour is shimmering with copper, and the aroma is soft. It's still delicious as I remembered, but oh mama, it is dangerously drinkable! I might need to run back to the Wine Exchange and buy some more."
"This ours a nice golden color with little head that dissapates fairly quickly. The smell is overwhemling hops, and I love it. Too me this tastes alot like a regular Sierra pale, but that might be just me. Overall a good beer, but I guess i expect more out of a seasonal release, other than to taste similar to Sierra's flagship pale ale."
"D - This is a highly drinkable IPA and one of the best i've tried lately. A pleasant surprise from Sierra Nevada."
"D - I could have several of these but after that I think all the hops would get to me...but that is just me. Of course, just like everyone else, I buy this every year. I just found this in the Camp Lejeune liquor store for $13.99 a 12 pack."
"Pours a hazy orange-brown color with a nice 1"" head that leaves lacing around the glass. Smell is very nice with some hint of citrusy hops. The finish is somewhat bitter. Definately worth drinking every year. Unfortunately I am out of my 2007 bottles."
"2007 edition. Poors a nice, slightly cloudy amber-brown color. Small, frothy, off-white head that diminishes quickly like most Sierra Nevada products that I have had in the past. Aroma is very pleasent with hopps and grapefruit and a molasses undertone. Also smell a little hint of apple. Flavor starts sweet and then goes to the bitter IPA taste that you either love or hate. The finish lasts a long long time. The feel of the beer was a bit of a disapointment. Felt very dry with sharp carbonation, the finish metallicy. Good beer if you like Sierra style PA's."
"If you like Cascade hops and Sierra beers in general you will probably love this winter seasonal. This years batch was especially fantastic, but maybe that's just because I missed out on last year. I always look forward to this winter offering."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that should be enjoyed in small doses. More than a couple of these and your palate is numbed, but on the plus side, this is a good beer to toast a celebration with."
"Not bad. Not bad at all. Very well crafted AIPA with a nice malt-backbone and a nice long bitterness to go with it. One of the better AIPA's i've tried in a while. Recommended!"
"More drinkable than you think. Very nice."
"D - Very drinkable beer and much recommended from a growler. I finished the growler the same night as I opened it; just keep that in mind. I'll be sorry to see this one go away soon, but will be eagerly awaiting its release next time!!"
"D-Although initially bitter, this beer seems to mellow on the palate. Easy to drink more than one. Wish they made this year round."
"As one can read in my profile, the American IPA is my current favourite style. And this is probably as good as it gets when it comes to botteled versions."
"Sampled on draft at City Beer in SF under the name ""Torpedo"". Amber pour. Very strong fruity mouth watering hop aroma. One of the better smelling beers I've had. Strong hoppy tasty, with bitterness to match, and a creamy yet dry finish. Interesting, slightly different IPA."
"Overall, a good but not amazing beer. Seemed to be lacking a definitive signature. Definitely right for a session."
"Also, it really reminds me of Great Divide's freshhop - wonder if anybody else got that."
"Well worth a try."
"lovely"
"Taste follows in suit with the smell, good hop punch with little malt balance though, definitely controlled by the hops with a lingering bitterness."
"D- solid"
"Great beer; I could drink this all night. Considering the price, this beer cannot be beaten."
"Smells like citrus, pine, and grapefruit. Flavor is not as harsh as many IPAs, with some mellowing sweeter fruit or malt balancing out a nice high hop content. Sierra Nevada has really produced a nice IPA here."
"This is one of the best hoppy beers that is available in a 12pk. Most of the real good beers come in the six packs or just the 22 oz. I noticed right off the bat that the head retention was incredible. The smell was potent with hops, and is not a beginners beer. The taste of bitter hops lingers on the tongue and has a subtle sweetness. Be careful of having a session on this beer. It can bang you up quick. @12.99 a 12pk it was a steal."
"I'll finish the six pack but prefer many other IPAs to this. IMO, it's not bad but not great."
"Update: After having tons more of this beer this past winter on draft and in bottle, I have truly come to love this beer. I updated my original rating from a 3.7 realizing how good this seasonal ale is. I even picked up a case to drink through the spring and summer, it's that good."
"Overall: Excellent IPA. Enough alcohol to be warming on a winter night, but not so much as to be overpowering. The balance is tipped slightly towards the hops, but there's a modicum of restraint that's nice to see from the brewer."
"drinkability- unless you're already warmed up, this beer will slow you down. given the style, i think it's very well balanced. it is loud, but everything in it is loud, so they're all screaming at the same volume. oh, a significant amount of lacing was left on the glass by this beer. it's big, it's bitter and it's beautiful."
"D - Definitely could enjoy a couple more."
"Don't really know why this is considered a winter warmer, although I'm not complaining, just a straight-up solid IPA (IMO). A good beer, which I expect from Sierra Nevada. Recommended if you like IPA's."
"2007 Bottle.. have been waiting for this. Most places were out or didn't have any, I finally found a place. A wonderful IPA with an awesome mix of hop flavs. IBU = ?? The smell is the only downside in my book, it's nicely evened, but doesn't have that american IPA kick smell I really enjoy in IPA's. This beer has wonderful tingle as you drink. A nice true bitter hop finish to it. A very balanced IPA, of which I can see why so many people rave about it."
"I was really excited to try this beer because I am a long time fan of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. This beer definately warms the heart during cold winters in the Northeast. I would definatley recommend this beer to anyone. It is hearty but yet drinkable. A revisit in my world."
"All in all, a remarkable example of American ""craft"" brewing with hops!"
"The Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is very drinkable indeed, if only in measured amounts because of its strong hoppiness."
"D: every year I wait for this beer. it reminds me of the holidays and just the winter season in general. very drinkable. its hard not to like this one."
"Overall a top notch beer that stands neck and cap over its far more more popular pale ale brother."
"D - I could sit and drink these all day and i think I have. I wish this wasn't a seasonal but I'm glad it is so I won't get burned out on this stuff."
"Smooth and creamy, but with a hoppy bite. Not too much for my hophead palate. If you haven't had it, go buy some now."
"Drinkability: The flavors and aromas of this beer just make me want to drink more. Ruby Red piny-ness, and kick you ass alcohol preclude this from being an all nighter, however."
"The only problem with this beer is that its not available all year round - but I guess this gives us another reason to look forward to the holidays. A delicious and well-made beer."
"Drinkability is damn good. Just damn good. Everything melds very well. Although I'm not a huge hops fan, the balance here is enough to convince me to try and become one. Two thumbs up."
"Cheers and Happy 2008, shertz"
"Beautifully clear orange-amber with a big, fuzzy white head with an orange tinge. The smell delivers bunches of fresh citrus and floral hops. Good carbonation with tongue tickling bubbles. Tastes of citrus, floral, and piney hops; with a slightly spicy bitterness ending in a dry finish. This beer is a fresh and tasty break from the warmer's, stout's, and porter's that I've been drinking lately. Very good, a nice winter pace changer."
"I plan on looking forward to each years edition of Celebration Ale."
"The slight sweetness in the brew makes this far more drinkable than many other IPAs out there. Very much worth stocking up on for the season."
"This poured copper with small head that vanishes rather quickly. Its aroma hit me as soon as I opened it. It smelled piney/hoppy, with an orange/lime/fruit smell. It tasted like a good IPA should, with strong hops and a hint of grapefruit in the aftertaste. It had a great mouthfeel, gliding nicely one its way down. I think this beer compared a lot to Founder's Centennial IPA..."
"This beer has one of the best balanced malt taste of any beer I have had That flavor is balanced with some good citrus flavors. Hints of grapefruit and lemon rind. Just can't say enough here. The alcohol is nice and hidden. Warms you up just a little at the finish. Leaves the mouth nice and slick with clean finish. This is a very strong fresh hopped beer and quite enjoyable."
"This is extraordinary beer. It has a very appetizing copper color and a tenacious white head that leaves some great lacing. This beer is nearly all hops, all the time. It smells like fresh hops, it tastes strongly of bitter and citrus hops but the brewer balances the flavor well enough that I don't feel like my palate is under assault. A touch more malt character would give it a perfect score, but maybe that's just me. The mouthfeel and drinkability are exceptional, you'll want to drink more and more. Buy a case."
"D: Just a great american ipa, nothing particularly remarkable, just very good and very drinkable"
"D- A definate good solid choice especially if you like hops, this is at least my my forth time drinking this and will more than likely purchase again, even if I have to collect change from around the house again!"
"Beer pours a pleasingly amber color with a nice off white head. You can really smell the hops and at the first taste you are dominated with the bite of the hops. The taste finishes with a pleasant bitterness. Definetly another good beer from Sierra Nevada. Very Drinkable."
"I look forward to this beer every year. This is an outstanding example of an American IPA and a total comfort brew for me. Highly recommended."
"The beer poured a deep amber color, with about a 1-inch head into a 12-oz pilsner glass. A sniff of the rocky head detected that wonderful hop aroma that SN has always been known for. The flavor was dominated by the hops, with a very satisfying hop bitterness at the finish. I have always enjoyed the SN brews, and usually get a case of two of the Celebration each season. It has always been consistently good, as are all of the SN beers, in my opinion."
"What can I say? This is the holiday beer of choice for hopheads. I wish they made this year round. Better than many ""year round"" IPAs. If you love the hoppy beers and see this on tap in your local neighborhood beer bar - get it. You won't be dissapointed."
"I hate writing reviews like this. I feel like I am bashing this beer too much, but I did not enjoy drinking this. This is not something I will revisit."
"Pours a deep amber color with a creamy head leaving some generous lace. Smells of hops, soft with a bitter grainy scent. Taste follows the smell basically, with a lot of hops, some bitter pine, etc. Some roundness with a slight sweet smoothness to the hoppy bite. A little malt comes through, but not much. Other tastes kind of come in and out, lemongrass, honey, citrus. I was a little disappointed in the depth and overall character of this beer as a seasonal IPA. A good body with medium fullness, some oily feel and decent combination of smooth/bitter. It's drinkable, but in general I'd pick something else over this."
"Poured a copper orange color with lots of floating particles in the glass. Smells of pine and cinnamon are abundant with sweet fruits in the background. Tasted like apricots or orange with pine accents. I had an acidic feel on the tongue and not the toes (inside joke). But the beer was not dry which is a huge plus. And for the drinkability, I would drink this beer like a crazy man. It is really good and I would take six down quickly."
"Nice crystal clear copper color with a big tan head. Fair head retention. Pleasant smell of both hops and malt. Taste more of hops than malt, which is appropriate for the style. A good IPA for the masses, because it's not TOO hoppy. Just right to introduce someone to IPAs. I did detect a little warmness as it went down too, so the alcohol is evident. Medium carbonation was just right. All in all an excellent beer."
"SN really knows its hoppy beers."
"2006. Off notes from 12-15-2006.Pours a clear very clear amber. Nose is a hop head heaven. Tan head. Flavor continues on the apparent hop theme. Hops. I dont need to say more than that. Feel is basic and standard. Typical stuff. Drinkability? High. You could down a lot of these all nightor day. Whichever your preference may be. Whereas it is nothing special or unique as far as offerings go, it is very well crafted. Smooth and even and worth trying. Or worth buying more than one of."
"Go Patriots ."
"Clear, bright copper-orange color. Thick, frothy white head, leaves lots of lacing. Aroma is piney hops. Refreshing citrus (grapefruit), pine hop flavor. Very smooth drinking, not bitter at all. Easy to enjoy several. I look forward to this every winter. Could really drink this year-round. The anticipation of the seasonal release undoubtedly adds to the experience."
"This was the first time I had this beer and I was surprised at how much I liked it. I will definitely buy more. I would drink it all year if it was in year-round production. Maybe it was just the store I was at, but it was actually cheaper than the Pale Ale, weird."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden amber color with a thick cream colored head that left a wall of lacing on the glass (hard pour). The smell is of grassy and floral hops, very fresh aroma. The taste has an orange & grapefruit citrus & resin hop blast right off the bat, which is followed by some balancing sweet malt flavor. The malt does a good job mellowing out the hops but stills leaves a good hoppy flavor. The brew is well bodied with soft carbonation which combines to a nice smooth feel, finishes pretty balanced - on the bitter side. An exceptional AIPA, a bit on the sweet side but very drinkable"
"Poured into a pint glass and was a nice golden brown color, almost amber with a nice white clowdy head. Has a wonerful full scent of pine and has a simple taste that is similar to an IPA with a little bit of extra pine taste and was very light on the seasonal spices which i found to be a perfect blend. had a nice medium feel in the mouth and was very easy to drink. Cant wait till the extras i have age in the cellar for a year or more!"
"Really surprised that a holiday ale would concentrate so much on the hops without putting in that Christmas spice. Need to pay more attention to the label next time. This is an excellent ale, something I would love all year round."
"Highly recommend this beer!"
"Poured an attractive orange/amber color with a nice white head that lingers for a while. Aroma is a piney hop smell, while the flavor is also a piney, grapefruit flavor. Beer is very smooth and drinkability is high. Lacing was good. This is a good beer that I will definitely have again."
"D - Overall, I could really drink this throughout the winter, and throughout the year even. This beer was a real joy to drink and really was an exceptional, tasteful, seasonal offering from SN."
"Clear coppery red with gold at the edges and a small cream head with a touch of lacing. Smell is a nice round citrus/pine hop note, and some caramel malt. Lively hoppiness, with chewy grassiness and bitterness, and just enough malts to balance and provide some thickness. Perhaps a bit too much carbonation. Slight medicinal alcohol note adds some dryness in the finish. Very similar to DFH 60minute, but a bit more intense."
"D: pretty light, but the bitter aftertaste stays a little too long to be totally drinkable"
"this one is just average to me. i hate to say it, but probably my least favorite christmas beer to date. it's ok."
"Definite must try, pick some extra up before this season is out."
"Unusual to have an IPA as a winter seasonal, and that might turn away some purists, but I wish this were available year-round. Sierra Nevada's standard pale ale is not a great substitute for it, and the Anniversary Ale was a limited brew, so enjoy this one while it lasts."
"Overall this my favorite holiday seasonal. Its a well balanced and tasty IPA. A must drink every year for me."
"Let's face it Sierra Nevada is the standard bearer of the Pale Ale. It doesn't surprise one bit that this one is fantastic extension of that great brew. First off, the smell is floral but not over the top. This is the first signal that this will be a hop heads brew. Taste, didn't disappoint, truly enjoyable. Rich in hoppy flavor but with balance. As far as drinkability.... I enjoy it typically after dinner or with friends. This is an outstanding beer. Get one while you can."
"Slightly aggressive pour yielded a one and half inch head of rather coarse bubble foam with decent retention. Looks wonderful with clear red amber color. Head has good retention. Aroma is citrus hops as is the taste. Not a lot of malt to balance the hops but I like it. I like a brew that has smack you in the face hop presence. Feels great in the mouth. Good carbonation plus hoppy bitterness equals a nice clean mouthfeel. Hey hon, bring me the rest of that six pack would ya?"
"Let this beer warm up after pouring and it becomes more drinkable and balanced. At 6.8% ABV, it is a good beer to sip. This is not one I would drink regularly, but it is a good once a year holiday ale."
"Bought a sixer of this in honor of the season. Its light gold copper and smells of cherries and pine, with a hint of spice. The taste is much more subdued than I expected, more balanced than the usual hop-heavy signature of most CA brewers in general and SN in particular. Not much head retention. The mouthfeel is soft if a bit thin. The drinkability is good, although hops-dominant beers are always an uhill climb for me. A good way to end the year but the name made me expect a winter warmer rather than an ipa. Something about trying to survive the heat of a long southern boat journey doesn't put me in the Christmas spirit!"
"the mouthfeel is great and it is very drinkable. These can sneak up on people as they do not taste like they have a ABV of almost 7%. That speaks of how well balanced it is. Heavy on the hop heavy on the alcohol."
"D- A great beer to pair with spicy food, or just to enjoy alone."
"I will be buying the 2008, I just hope its popularity with the general public doesn't increase (at the local beer store here they had a huge display of this in front and it was about empty) so the price stays the same."
"D Um for an american IPA, this was ok, i still cant get use to the harsh hoppy bitter bite. This wasnt as harsh as most. I can see why IPA lovers would enjoy this, a lot of nice complex flavours but this style isnt for me."
"Cheers to this solid seasonal offering."
"D: Not what I was expecting at all, and for the better! I enjoyed every sip of this brew, I say sip since it would seem difficult to drink quickly due to the strong hop and citrus character. The higher alcohol content also keeps me from downing too many of these, as I am a lightweight, but I certainly look forward to future years of Celebration Ale to come."
"Poured into a pint glass, This beer poured a light brown color with a lot of carbonation. It had a thick white foamy head. The overall scent was very hoppy and fruity, with a hint of pine, A definate change compared to other december seasonals. Had a very strong citrus and bitter taste. Very light mouthfeel, almost like water, just with some carbonation. Overall this was a decent beer to me, but not my favorite. I would pick somthing else besides this beer if given the oppertunity."
"I'm almost halfway through the pint and still impressed with the carbonation. Nice bits of sticky lace like cotton candy stuck to the sides of my Sierra Nevada pint glass. I'm also surprised at the body; it seems a bit thin and makes the beer rather perilously drinkable at nearly 7 percent alcohol. Visually the beer is quite appealing, at least at first, but upon closer inspection I can notice some little white dots (proteins?) in suspension; floating in the beer. Maybe it's yeast, I dunno. It's okay I guess, because the beer tastes good. The caramel malt and hops balance is quite good with a lingering bitterness in the finish. This long, bitter and dry finish is perhaps the most enjoyable quality of this beer, that and I suppose it's dangerous drinkability."
"I was skeptical as to how or why an IPA would be brewed as a winter seasonal until I tried this one. Toasty and warming, it is a great beer to drink on a cold winter night."
"Never had this before, bought a sixer ..Celebration Ale?...expecting something lightly hopped, sweet, creamy, malty and spicy, not an IPA, it caught me by surprise....pleasanty. Thumbs up and Cheers!"
"Drinkabilty: A good beer, but not what I typically think of for a winter ale. I picked up a case of this to see how it ages, i have heard mixed reviews on aging Celebration. With the kind of low alcohol and its style of dry-hopped spiciness, I imagine it will be best fresh. We'll see."
"Celebration Ale pours out of the bottle a deep copper color with a foamy tan head that lasts throughout. It lingers on the sides of the glass, creating lacing with every swallow. The smell is a little weak compared to the taste. You sense a nice hop aroma with a little maltiness. The taste, however, is great. It's got a great big hop character balanced by a mild sweetness reminiscent of dark molasses. On the back of the tongue I found that, along with the ruby red grapefruit flavor found in hoppy beers, I tasted maraschino cherries. Overall this is a gem of a Christmas ale. Many times, holiday ales are so sweet and spiced that if you have more than one you start to feel sick. The nice balance of sweet and bitter in Celebration Ale lends itself to being a very drinkable beer without fear of a stomach ache."
" Again, This is really great stuff but no surprise from pro's like sierra nevada. If you haven't had this yet, buy it now and save yourself a trip to the store by buying a few sixers right off the bat. Your gonna want more anyway."
"it poured a nice amber color with about a finger of head. The smell of hops was strong and the taste was equal with it. It had a nice mouthfeel with some carbonation, i could definitely drink this beer year round too bad its seasonal. Another job well done Sierra Nevada!"
"D: Hoppier than and not as well balanced as their Anniversary Ale and their IPA (and as far as I'm concerned, that's not a complaint), but like all S.N. brews, it's very drinkable."
"D- I don't dig this one. Had it for the first time last year and absolutely hated it. This year i've warmed to it but it just doesn't seem drinkable to me. The first sip is fine and I don't mind hop bitterness, in fact, I love hop biterness, however the bitter stickiness that lasts for minutes after every sip doesn't appeal to me."
"A very drinkable, good tasting, yet unspectacular IPA."
"Drinkability- One of the best all around beers Ive had, a true two thumbs up on this one."
"This beer reminded me more of Seirra Nevada's pale ale more than anything. This brew is hopped up! Nice spices throughout. Has a nice amber color and a lasting head. The hops and spices leave a nice aftertaste in the mouth. Santa, please bring me a growler of Celebration Ale for Christmas!!"
"I've had this beer a few times before. I've always found it, as I do now, to be an IPA of great quality. A sticky, billowy head. A strong floral, grapefruit aroma. Pleasantly bitter with a strong caramel foundation. Warming and fulfilling. It's not your standard ""holiday beer"" but it certainly does the job."
"2007: Pours pale amber with a huge white head that lingers, leaving lace down the glass throughout the session. Aroma is full impact cascade hops, backed by faint notes of crystal malt. Flavor is once again almost pure cascade hops, citrusy with piney notes, backed by medium body and significant malt background. Finish is hoppy yet sweet, lingering and leaving you wanting more. Great American IPA!"
"God I love this beer. I have always looked forward to November so I can enjoy this beautiful IPA that manages to pull off being a Winter offering. Tasting this every winter brings back warm memories when I started to dabble in craft brews. All time classic in my book. Highly recommended."
"D: Because of the acidity and level of carbonation of this beer, its one and done for me."
"For a beer that would lend one to believe it would have the characteristics of a winter warmer, Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale shares come characteristics with an IPA. It pours a reddish brown with a foamy and consistent head, leaving a fair amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. The smell is heavy in hops, with hints of fruits (apricot and grapefruit come to mind). The taste is hoppy, slightly bitter, and has the common 'pine tree' factor found in many IPAs and seasonal brews. For an IPA, this was pretty smooth and I could definitely have more than just one or two of these. You *do* feel the 6.8% ABV, but it's not overwhelming."
" happy holidays indeed!!!"
"In terms of drinkability, I'm one and done with this beer. The hop character is great, but more than one of these at a time, and I grow weary of it. It's a great beer, but it's not necessarily what I would call ""pleasant."" This is some unruly oily-bitter beer, and you have to be in the mood for it. Plus, the 6.8% seems to hit a little harder here than in other beers of comparable strength."
"I'm looking forward to reviewing the 02, 03, 05 and 06 I have in my basement, just to see how this has done over the years."
"D- Bartender! Another one down here, please."
"All in all, this is a good AIPA, and one that I'd love in the middle of the summer, as I sit outside tending my grill. As a winter warmer, however, there's something important missing that I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe it's the lack of seasonal spice, or maybe it's the abundance of my favorite hops. Whatever the case, I like this beer a bunch."
"i used to drink alot of sierra nevada's brew when i lived in San Jose ; this one pours a slightly hazy med. reddish-gold w/ a thin, creamy, off-white head which quickly dissipates leaving plenty of lacing in my pint glass ; smell is predominantly citrusy hops w/ a faint fruity undertone and a smell slightly similar to mildew, a hint of crystal malts as it warms ; a powerful citrusy/floral hop flavor as well, definitely cascades w/ the ""grapefruit"" like flavor and all, some toasty malts are hiding in there, but not really discernible through the hops ; a good rich mouthfeel, one of my biggest pet peeves is people over-hopping the shit out of a light beers and calling it an IPA/APA, this one has a med. body w/ enough co2 to keep the residuals balanced w/ the hops ; i really enjoyed this one, i look forward to drinking my next one, which is right about now..."
"Overall, a staple among all beers. The only thing to look forward to in the winter."
"poured out a honey color, nice head, good retention, I like the color of this brew.aromas-citrus, piney, oranges,cloves, floral hops.taste- honeys,very hoppy, softens on the tongue after several seconds, citrus,floral pine, wood flavors come through.medium mouthfeel combined with the great flavors make this highly drinkable. I really enjoyed this one, wiil buy again before the holidays are over."
"Pours a rich burgandy brown with tight buttery cream head. Smells nicely of floral hops and maybe some scents of sour dough bread. Boy this one is nice a hoppy. Initial taste is bitter, tingles on the back of the tounge. Some bready, malted sweetness upfront but the hops steal the show. Buttery mouthfeel. Great beer!"
"Overall- It's a nice twist on a Christmas beer. There wasn't any spice to associate with the season, but it was more drinkable than many of the beers that are overly sweet or heavy on the spice."
" I would love to see SN come out with a true winter warmer or old ale and add their own hop twist, made for a cold winters night."
"Ah, nothing says Christmas like a bottle of Celebration Ale. Fresh pungent hops, spices, maybe even some mint? It's all there wrapped up in one nice package. Happy Holidays and enjoy."
"Drinkability: Nice brew for the winter, but I could probably drink only one or two in a sitting. All in all, a good choice if your looking for a solid IPA."
"The first ever brew I had from the Sierra Nevada company, and what a way to start off! Absolutely slammin'... pours a dark brown copper color with carbonation present that gave way to a decent-sized frothy head... Smell is full of fresh hops and a faint aroma of spices... Taste is sublime... a great mix of hops and spices balanced out by the awesome freshness of the sample... Mouthfeel is equally great, but some points were lost to drinkability because of the relatively high alcohol percentage... Otherwise, an outstanding selection and a great example of a winter-warmer... Certainly recommended - an awesome brew..."
"D: Not bad, nice and pleasant."
"i could and will easily drink this again, as long as SN keeps producing. an overall top 15 IPA in my opinion, and definitely upper echelon for a seasonal selection."
"D - I really enjoyed this one this is a good IPA would buy it again"
"Not on the same page as many winter brews, i.e. cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger etc.(at least not that I pick up) but a nice, tasty IPA"
"A prototypical West coast IPA."
"got this in a mix a six, wish i would of got more in hindsight pours a pretty golden copper color. with a big frothy white head. smell is of piney hops and warm malt. the taste is exceptional, lots of bitter hops and a strong alcohol presence are most noticeable, has a nice warm finish though. mouthfeel is full and flavorfull drinkability would be higher but at 7% i think i'd get drunk awfully quick"
"The hops really stand out with a strong earty aroma. Leaving a bitter taste you can expect from an IPA."
"It was a very good beer. A little too sharp to drink more than three of these, but definitely a great winter IPA."
"The on slot of hops continues on the palate. Lots of citrus and pine, a good malt bill, spices and a dry finish. The mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth. Another excellent brew from one of the most respected breweries in the U.S. (IMO)."
"The beer pours a brilliantly clear copper color with a thin white head that left nice lacing. The aroma is very fresh, medium-high hoppiness, that of citrus and pine. The flavor has a medium-low maltiness and moderate-high hop flavor and bitterness, nicely balanced. The finish is quite smooth and leaves just enough on the palate to really want another sip. The carbonation was moderate and body medium-full. Overall one of the best offerings from the brewery!"
"Poured copper amber and clear. Thick, dimpled, white head that only got thicker as the beer sat in the glass. Aroma is mostly hop floral with a bit of malt sweet underneath. The taste leads with a bracing bitterness into a rounder green pine hops that is cut with malt before fading into a pleasant lingering aftertaste. Really an exceptional beer for those who like hops. That being said, I wouldn't want to drink more than one or two in a sitting."
"D: A warming and very good IPA for the holiday season. Definitely recommended. I used it to ""celebrate"" Repeal Day."
"I have some questions about this beer. Winter? This beer seems unusual as a winter seasonal, especially considering the fact that SN has a pale ale and IPA that are both available year round. Im also a bit confused as to why this beer seems to be one that is often cellared. Why? The only reason i can think of its popularity in terms of aging is the vintage dating. I'm not saying it doesn't age well, i don't know, i have never tasted an aged example, but it just seems like an unusual choice. A good beer, but it is a bit of an enigma that leaves me a bit confused."
"Despite the misleadings of the label, this is an excellent brew. The hop aroma is pleasant and strong. Head leaves a nice lace in a tulip glass and retains well. The color is a nice and rich amber. Mouthfeel is excellent, with the hops revealing a nice cascade and citrus/grapefruit finish. Malt profile leaves a bit to be desired for a winter ale. If you're looking for a nice IPA, this will not disappoint. If looking for a winter warmer, try another brewery."
"I love this beer! I haven't smiled like this on the first sip of a beer since my first Dogfish head 90-minute IPA. Not your standard winter warmer but a fine celebration of the season nonetheless! Highly recomended and I will definitely enjoy more of these!"
"Pours a big thick pillowy head with a great lacing and a clear brown color with yellow/gold edges. Smell is a slightly sweet fruity hop smell with some pineapple grapefruit hops. Taste is sweet malty with some really good bitter that's light and well, well balanced. Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy too. Overall, a very good brew I will have more of this wonderful brew."
"D: A great winter beer balanced out with spices that makes me forgot about the terrible weather outside."
"Wow! A great IPA. Nice amber color, not as dark as I prefer, but nice, with good head and great lacing. A great hoppy scent and excellent hoppy taste. Goes down pretty well, just a little rough. This is a great IPA! I will definitely have more of these, beyone the sixer I currently am half way through."
"Drinkability took two steps back after about 6 ounces. Beer was certainly well hopped with decent balance, but it stayed with me for the next 2 to 3 hours."
"But if you judge this as an America IPA (which is how BA shows), then this beer kicks ass and takes names."
"just got a chance to have a couple pints of a 2006 vintage (one year old cellared keg obviously!!) at Dr. Dremo's in Arlington, VA... already reviewed this year's batch, but just in case anyone else is curious, it held up really, really well and definitely took on some new dimensions. beautiful appearance with that insane lace that lets you see every sip you took. taste and nose... the hop character held up nicely... the mix of hops that they use seemed to turn in to a nice hybrid that created a citrus flower - almost orange blossom like - taste. malt character really came out as well. soft and smooth. tasty and virtually no bitterness. a real treat. thanks bill!!!"
"Poured into a tasting glass from the bottle. There is a 1/4"" head which lasts, a nice orange color. A spicy and lively hoppy nose, the taste is wonderful. It tastes like a supercharged version of the pale ale, i like the hoppiness. Will be my go to beer for the winter months."
"Year in and year out Celebration Ale is one of the finest IPAs around. From the rich copper color to the wonderful pine tree and citrus aroma to a drinkability that is close to water, this beer is always a treat. This year's edition is no different. Wonderful piney in the nose and taste with a solid grapefruit flavor as well. I could drink this stuff all of the time. Fine work here. Highest recommendation."
"Anybody who likes the Pale Ale will dig this one."
"2007 Celebration Ale, picked up at Community Beverage in Elmhurst. Pours out an impressive deep red, brown color, with a decent frothy head. Smells of citrus and cascade hops. It'll remind you of a stronger Sierra Nevada pale ale. The sweet malts are present, but only behind those cascades. Taste is of wonderfully refreshing cascade hops and sweet malts. Again, I hate to make the comparison, but if you love the pale ale's distinctive hop taste, this is like twice the amount of goodness. Very smooth and crisp, but leaves a rather bitter aftertaste, which isn't unpleasant. Overall, a very, very delicious beer. If this were made year-round, the pale ale would stand no chance. I think this IPA destroys their 2007 anniversary ale, which was a bit disappointing."
"D: Exceptional offering for hop-lovers who still love some balance."
"I am delighted to see that Sierra Nevada has made the switch to pry-off bottles that I can re-use for homebrewing. I've been doing a good enough job lately at drinking mostly kegged beer that I actually needed some bottles to bottle into!"
"Overall, it's pretty easy to drink and is simply a jazzed up IPA, good for those of us that like IPAs but wanted something a bit spicier for the holidays. I'll definitely be having a few more of these for sure."
"Pours golden amber copper color with a thick fluffy head that quickly dissappears. Aroma is floral citrus hops with a background sweet malt. There is an initial flavor of sweet maltiness with a crisp bite from the citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is smooth with medium level of carbonation. I would definately have another, doesn't put me in a christmas spirit but a solid beer."
"Pours a light amber with a fluffy and thick tan head that sticks around quite a bit. Smells of hops and orange peels with a slight bit of malts underneath it all. Tastes of hops which were surprisingly not as big as I thought they would be. Nonetheless, I thought they were perfect in this beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat crisp. Superb and very drinkable IPA."
"Excellent beer."
"Every year, I threaten to buy a case of these and let them cellar until next year ... only to spend my beer cash on too many other winter seasonals. This year, I am trying to buy a 6'er here and there and build up .... check back next year to see if it worked."
"And there you have it, something that I know will be bought every Christmas. Cheers!"
"As with most Sierra Nevada beers, the Celebration Ale has a top end with a pronounced zing to it. Not bitter, just pronounced. This seasonal beer is complex but not quite as well rounded as say the Great Lakes Christmas Ale. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than others, taste is a bit bright but a very drinkable ale nonetheless. Lacing was truly incredible. After finishing my first glass I realized the head had laced all the way down from the top to the bottom and remained throughout, really quite beautiful. A must try beer for the winter holiday season."
"Clean and bright on the palate. The carbonation is moderate with a thicker malty after taste. Smooth but clean mouthfeel. Very nicely done. Very solid and well balanced; characteristic of most Sierra Nevada selections."
"Overall just as good as I remembered, and maybe more bitter than I remembered... this is one of my favorites."
"Anyway, it pours a nice deep orange, almost reddish appearance with a small fluffy tan head. The smell as I said is the usual grassy, flowery, hopped smell of an IPA with a little orange to it. The taste is a nice balanced hoppy bitterness, yet slightly sweet and refreshing. A good amount of carbonation tops it off reminding me more a summer thirst quencher than a Winter brew but very drinkable none the less."
"D: I wish they brewed this year round. This rates right up there with the Stone IPA or even the Ruination IPA for me. The hop character is huge, almost to the point of being overbalanced, but there's just enough malt sweetness in there to make it work. My only complaint (I guess ) is that it's a bit of an odd winter release. But that's just being nitpicky. This is excellent."
"D- Very tasty and nice to drink!"
"I have had the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and this was only the 2nd Sierra Nevada I have tried. I found it a Florence Wine and Liquor in NJ and it was reasonably priced at 7.99 for 6 . The new owners recently purchased the store and they have diminished alot of the previous owners Micro and Import stock to carry 40's and quarts so when I look for a good Micro or Import I find myself going to Red White And Brew in Mount Holly or the Liquor Barn on Florence Columbus Road."
"D: Why oh why is this only made in winter? I could see drinking this all through summer!"
"Good session beer for a hop head but not something for the faint or light beer drinkers."
"Fantastic. Highly recommended... As if you didn't already know"
"2007 vintage. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark orangish amber color with a large off-white head that leaves a nice amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet malt and an array of fresh piney hops. The taste starts out with a touch of malt but the tongue is quickly bombarded with prickly hop bitterness that stay with you long after the sip. Overall, this is surely a winter classic that is highly recommended."
"Overrall, I love this beer, as it is one of my top 5 beers out there. A different beer than last year, but great anyway you look at it. A masterpiece IMHO. Well done SN, well done."
"D - Very drinkable. Easy consumption for such a strong and hoppy beer. The alcohol is not overwhelming. It isn't a session beer, but I could easily have two or three of these."
"2007 version. Loved this beer. The hops on the nose carry through to the taste in wonderful bitterness and flowery notes. The malt flavor does a nice job of balancing and adding to the taste. I loved the dark amber color. I could drink lots and lots of these."
"[ serving type: bottle]"
"Pours a clear amber, with a medium tan head. Smells of malt and hops. Tastes of rich malt, slightly toasty, with a slight hop flavor. Good bitterness from the hops, with a full mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little high, but nothing that would detract from its score. Pretty drinkable for an IPA. This years batch is very good. I will probably pick up at least one more 6 pack of this before the season is over."
"Drinkability: Great, if you're a hophead. I find it easy to drink and enjoyable. But you have to love hops."
"It's hard to rate this one. I heard so many people discussing how great this years stock of Celebration was. I really do like it too.... but.... this isn't what I expected. I am a huge hop head so I like it. However, I was expecting it to have some more spice & complexity to it. It's really more of your typical IPA. Last years stock wasn't the best ever, but it had an excellent spice/cinnamon thing going on and I may have enjoyed it even more than this year. IMO, if they would merge this year & last it would be perfect. On to my review... A - Nice auburn with slight puffy tan head that laced the glass well. S - Hops, hops, hops. T - More hops, where's the spice? Some citrus & pine bite, but bitter hops all the way. M - A nice brew, I love IPA's so I enjoyed it immensely, just not what was expected from the Christmas winter brew. D - You can enjoy these all winter with no problem, either way... atleast as long as you like a strong kick in the mouth of bitter hops."
"D- For such a high ABV, this can be drank in massive amounts. I love this beer, thank you SN."
"A pale copper lends itself to a vibrant amount of carbonation. Scads of lacing abound. Pleasnt aromatics consisting of citrus and pine. Man, this is one bitter brew. A lot of bitterness coats the mouth for a near-unpleasant finish. This is wet & drinkable, but not very complex. To me, this is a run-of-the-mill IPA."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into Delirium Tremens snifter. Poured a copper amber color with a thick white head. Smells of citrus hops with a slight yeasty sour note. Taste a little grapefruit and pine with a nice malty balance, not very bitter. Mouthfeel is medium body with a mild carbonation. Drinkability is very good in this beer which tends to be one of the smoother winter brews."
"Y'know, every year I get some, and I even get excited about it. And I end up getting more later because it's an equal-opportunity IPA, and everyone likes it, and if people don't love IPAs they still kinda come around on this... but really... I can get better IPAs all year round... why not get something I CAN'T get all year round instead? I dunno, but I do, and I don't see it changing anytime soon."
"Super tasty and easy to drink."
"Overall this was a drinkable beer. I enjoyed it more than the recent Anniversary Ale, better balanced IMO. I would drink this again, maybe a six pack or two per season would be about right."
"The label says 2007 Celebration Ale, with garlands and a snowy cabin scene to accent the season. The label also notes the brewer's tradition of special beers made for the winter season. Any disappointment that I feel is linked to this presentation. Celebration Ale is a solid IPA that I would happily drink again, but doesn't feel like anything special to me. There is a big, long-lasting head and and a nose and mouthful of hops that impart notions of grapefruit and herbs. It's enjoyable and would be easy to down several in a sitting - there's just noting special out of the realm of a good American IPA."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer and I'm not a hop head. I don't see it as a daily selection, but once in a while."
"Poured in to a pint glass from a 12 oz. bottle. Nice golden translucent color, with a small but lasting head; good lacing. This one is a nice dose of mild but tasty hops when I'm not in the mood for a DIPA or IPA in that my pallet isn't as wiped out. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to try a ""hoppy"" beer but has been shying away from IPA's or stronger. Easy to drink and excellent taste."
"Poured a nice mellow amber color with a slight cream head that dissapated pretty quickly, but pretty carbonated so it was bubly all the way through. Smelled like citrus and hops. I couldnt really nail down the fruit because the hops was so prevalent. Taste was hoppy with a little floral but mostly hops. To be completly honest, Ive read many people rave about this beer so thats the reason I went out and bought it. I was a little let down. I didnt think that it was all that complex. Its a good beer, but it couldnt be a daily drinker to me."
"cheers!!!"
"Amber/copper color with a fluffy merangue like head, deep due to a vigorous pour. Strong smell of hops, citrus and pine, almost no malt present. Tastes of bitter resinous citrus hops. Medium carbonation and body with a bitter aftertaste. This is the first time I've tried the Celebration Ale, but now I can see where the inspiration for the Anniversary Ale came from. Descent brew, not an every day drinker, but nice for a hop fix."
"Yes indeed..the arrival of an old friend!"
"Ahh, the return of an old friend. I await this one to come out every year, and every year pick up a couple cases and have one every night from now until New Years. This years I have to say is fantastic. A big hop presence was added and it really showed. Poured a nice amber, not as dark as years past, but with a very sticky and foamy head on top, this one was here for a while. The smell was obnoxious, it was so sticky and fresh with hop resin, I did not even know what to do. Such a great mix of pine nugget freshness with a little bit of spice mixed in, dare I say perfect. The flavor was nothing short of extraordinary with a deep rich and stick hop profile, it was much better then any I had tried the last few years. Overall this was great and far exceeded last years version. This is a huge hop monster this year and it really needed to be. I am thrilled to see this back around and it is a real treat. Go out and get some, you will not be disappointed."
"This is one holiday beer that is worth trying. I wouldn't say this is one of my favorites but still good none the less."
"Overall: I love christmas for all the unique spiced ales. But this is the one I pound season after season. I like to drink all the special brews the best brewers but it's this macro micro that I love. I am a sucker for IPA's and any brewer that would put one out as its christmas brew earns extra points with me. This beer shows that IPA's are for all seasons. Cheers to Sierra Nevada for being different."
"This is not a bad IPA at all. If you like IPA's a lot, give this one a try to add to your repetoire. Otherwise try some of the more varied and interesting special winter releases."
"D - For such a bitter beer this is quite drinkable. There is a good bit of hop flavor and especially aroma, but this one is really all about the bitterness. I am normally a bit cynical when it comes to super bitter beers from the west coast, but this is a classic. The bitterness is overwhelming, but characterfull. This beer pairs magnificently with rare, tuna soft tacos and hot mango salsa."
"Would love to have a keg of this around Christmas with a nice fire. Awesome brew, probably the best I have had from Sierra Nevada."
"D: One to savor and enjoy slowly. Glad I have five more from the six pack waiting in the fridge."
"The taste is definately in-your-face, with hoppiness to boot. It's a bit one sided, however, and the piney, medicinal hop flavors reminds me more of an English IPA than most of the fruity, resinous american counterparts. Some malts eventually show up as the beer warms, bringing with it a muted sweetness. The mouthfeel is crisp, with a sticky body and a lingering hoppy aftertaste. I like. This isn't an exceptionally easy drink. It does however, pack a punch that hop-heads will love, although fans of english-style IPA's might find it more up their alley."
"D - good beer, goes down easy, celebrate!"
"Drinkability - It's a great beer to enjoy, but you don't want to overload on it. It's the holiday treat we all wait for. Try it any where you can find it, you won't be dissapaointed."
"Pours a clean copper color with a light tan head. Aromas of grapefruity/ citrus hops. In the taste, a citrus hop right up front, with a sticky sweet malty backing. A quite smooth, with a small bitter mouthfeel, and a sticky-sweet to dry hoppy aftertaste. Great hop characteristics, easy to drink, and usually the start of my Christmas beers."
"D: I'll have quite a bit of this throughout the holidays. Only thing holding back the taste(though not much) is the lack of a more defined malt character. I know hops are supposed to be the mainliner, and I love that, but it needs a bit further touch of complexity from the other side. I also think this would help the mouthfeel a bit, too Appearance was close to a 5, also, but I like my IPA's hazy instead of clear. Knit-picking, maybe. This brew is very close to perfect scores."
"This beer is a bit too strong to be a session beer, but it is an outstanding example of an IPA, which happens to be my favorite style. I'd love to see this one year round!"
"Finish is long and dry."
"Taste was very good, very crisp with a nice citrus after taste. Very refreshing and a great year around beer."
"Overall- You must keep in mind that it does carry the ""winter brew"" name, but not the characteristics. For what it is, an IPA, it is a nice beer. It is hoppy and dry, just like an IPA should be. If you think of it as the typical winter beer, you will definitely be let down."
"There are a lot of beers I might rather drink but would not hesitate to serve this to anyone who comes over. I would echo some other reviews in saying a great IPA, not necessarily a standard approach to a winter brew though."
"D- A very tasty and easy to drink beer. I missed this over the past year."
"D: This is simply an awesome brew, something I actually wish Sierra Nevada would just brew year round, as it's without a doubt one of the top IPAs I have ever had. The thing is, if you want a ""Holiday Beer"" or ""Winter Warmer", this may not be you beer, as it doesn't have the holiday spices or typical ""Winter Warmer"" feel. That being said, the drinkability is very good, although after a few, I think I might have to slow it down, as the high hop character as well as the high ABV are nothing to be fooled around with. To sum up, this is one awesome offering from Sierra Nevada. Buy it while you can. Better yet, buy a lot and save some up, as IPAs tend to age fairly well."
"Drinkability: The bitterness keeps you wanting more as it seems to taste more and more balanced as you drink it since you palatte has been hammered by the hops"
"D - Good, I could easily kick back with a few more. Overall this is a great beer and I'm actually glad they only release it around the winter, gives me something to look forward to again next year. Recommended."
"D: This is one I look forward to each year, as I find it to be a mild IPA that still brings forth a great deal of hop flavor. Even though it's a seasonal release, Celebration Ale seems quite versatile, as it could work really any time of the year. Great hop profile, plenty of aromatic goodness, and quite a level of drinkability make this one a perfect go-to beer around the holidays."
"What else could be said about this beer that hasnt been said? Its almost a perfect beer in my eyes and its a shame its only sold during the hopidays.SN,Just a note.Can the Pale Ale and make this a staple in your every day line of brews."
"Drinkability: Good brew. Too bad this celebration is not available year round."
"Pours an amber, almost burnt orange color with a cloudy body. Rocky, foamy off white almost three inch head that takes a great deal of time to die down. Some excellent lacing that lingers at the top of the glass. Smell is of pine, citrus, caramel malt with a good deal of sweetness in the aroma. Taste is hoppy and a little bit of an oily texture that lingers with some stickyness. A nice deal of warming presence."
"Mouth happiness: I'll take it every time...the fact it's a seasonal spaces it out just right, the desire for it, in a land now filled with great IPA's"
"My only down is that it tastes real similar to most of their other beer. Bigfoot Barleywine (esp. aged, the 2004 was spectacular) and the Harvest (even more hop slap) are different, but the rest of the line is real similar. I think that when I first started in craft beer this would have been too much beer for me. But with the inevitable drift towards hops, it is a strong quality beer."
"I discovered my winter session beverage when I picked this up. If you are a hophead do yourself a favor and purchase this beauty. By far my favorite release by Sierra Nevada. War Chico, CA."
"Overall I won't seek this out..but if you're a hop head..it's a can't miss"
"Nearly a perfect beer! 2007 batch pours a brilliant amber color with nice thick, two finger, slightly rocky head. Great retention and amazing lace. Each sip leaves a ""lace ring"" behind like ring on a tree trunk or layers in the earth. Amazing. Smell is strong of hops, not like a typical ""winter"" beer. Taste is incredible, one of the best beers I've experienced yet. Strong hop punch at the start, definitely was not expecting that, followed by a nice touch of caramel and toasted grains as it goes down. I've yet to experience an IPA like that before. Normally the hops from start to finish bore me but the hop punch followed by the caramel flavour is incredible. Smooth and crisp going down leaves behind a semi-sweet, oily aftertaste. Overall what a fantastic beer! I'm glad I found this early in the season, I will be enjoying several more of these as long as I can find them!"
"Sierra deserves love from hop heads for the awesome consistency -a beer you can rely on yearly"
"Sierra Nevada knows how to make holiday beers; Fall - IPA, Winter - IPA, Boxing Day - IPA, Mother's Day - IPA. Anywho, this years celebration pours a modest head that doesn't stick around for too long. Smells of big citrus and piney American hops. It tingles the tongue, first with carbonation, then with hops that linger around for a while. Obviously it is very hop forward, the maltiness is very well hidden, caramel malts creeps up the back of your throat after a while. I don't have anymore Anniversary Ale but would really like to taste the two beers together, they seem very similar. I will drink many of these in the weeks/months to come"
"D- Very drinkable beer. Smooth and easy to drink, but very very flavorful, this is a great beer."
"Nice reddish golden beer. Thick lasting head with a lot of lacing. Heavy hop aroma. Smells like a pine tree and flowers. It smells like I've been whacking my way through an upper Michigan blue spruce farm with a machete while lost hunting whitetails. I'm not a huge I.P.A. fan but this is a good specimen of that style of beer. Typical I.P.A. bitter aftertaste is present. Good carbonation. Not too thick or thin. But not a ""drink all night"" beer either. Pretty easy drinker for 6.8% alcohol."
"Overall, another solid beer form Sierra Nevada. Personally I liked the balance and cascade hop aroma of the Anniversary Ale better, but the Celebration is still a good, well made beer. They must use more chinook in this beer versus the Anniversary."
"I didn't have last year's Celebration Ale, but if I were to compare it to the Anniversary Ale, it'd be lagging a bit in the race."
"I thought the carbonation and overall feel of this beer was about perfect for it's style. I could definitely drink a few of these, but it definitely takes some warming to get the good flavors out. The last sips were definitely the best."
"DRINKABILITY: This is an awesome beer. No kidding. I don't know what it's like from a bottle, but from a keg on it's first day of being released to the public, it is absolutely wonderful. It has all the complexity to keep you interested, but not so intense to make it non-sessionable. Hats off to Sierra Nevada once again!"
"a year has done much to mellow this all-star and many small bits of yeast are spattered at the bottom of the glass. hops have toned down into a seamless line of pine and grapefruit and malt is toasty burnt caramel as it will ever be. slightly more in balance, and not quite so aggressive."
"This beer poured a deep copper color and had a thin off white head which lasted just a little bit. The aroma was of piney-hops and hints of citrus. The taste was all pine. The hop bitterness dominated this beer which was fine with me. It left a nice aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a medium body with medium carbonation. Overall drinkability is good. I could tire of the bitterness after a while but for the most an overall great beer."
"Deep, amber color with slight hazinesss. Thin foam has that fresh from the fermenter look to it. Smell isn't as strong as other dry-hopped brews I've had, which is too bad because there is a pleasant, sweet, fruity aroma to the brew. Hop bitterness and the citrus twang dominate the taste. Hard to detect any balance, but I found that the citrusy character really mellowed out the bitterness. Is it possible for hoppy citrusness to balance out hop bitterness? Whatever it was, it was very very good. The alcohol is pretty prevalent and hits you pretty quick, but I still found this extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability: This brew is extremely drinkable. It is a hoppy beer, but as far as IPAs go, it isn't too hoppy. I could drink the whole six pack tonight (my wife would hate me though). The only reason why it doesn't score higher is that I just feel there is a lack of complexity in this beer. But not all good beers need to be complex."
"Very nice. It tastes better fresh to me but still not too bad!"
"Overall, I was really suprised when I tasted the beer. I liked it very much. It is really smooth, a good sipper beer."
"Not your typical winter beer. Hop lovers, rejoice."
"One of the original hop bombs. Pours amber with ruby highlights, inch of head fades leaving. Aroma is grapefruit. Taste is all grapefruit with floral notes. Malt is very faint and buttery. Carbonation is spot on. Mouthfeel is really awesome, coats the palate but not too thick. Just an excellent example of the style. 2007 vintage is my favorite thus far. Even better than the 05."
"Maybe this beer was too hyped up for me but I am unimpressed. Yes it is a good beer and worth a few moments of your time, but its not fantastic. Perhapse I got a bad 6 pack at the beer store, but there is very little head on this pretty ruby/orange beer. It smells good, very malty with a slight hoppy scent, but it doesn't follow through."
"Dont drink and review."
"D - Very enjoyable. It feels balanced and doesn't feel too harsh in any aspect. This is a really good beer! I may have to seek out more!"
"Notes: I think SN really got back on the ball with this one. I thought the '06 Celebration was missing something, seems to be back in full force."
"."
"Pours a golden amber with a quick rising but controllable off white head that displays nice retention while leaving splotches of sticky lacing in its wake. The aroma is primarily of ""c" hops and caramel malt, though it isn't huge and in your face. The taste is quite balanced between the hops and malt as far as west coast IPA's go. Not extremely hoppy like certain others, or extraordinarily complex or really special in any way. There is a lingering aftertaste that includes both the bitterness of the hops and sweetness of the malts. The carbonation is just right, and the overall mouthfeel is pretty much the same as you'll find with most other beers of this style. Just a nice solid beer that everybody should look forward to each year."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Great for a winter night."
"Drinks very easy, hops are asserting themselves this year. Not a perfect offering, but well worth stockpiling"
"The beer has a hop kick upon consumption with a little spicyness to enhance the bitterness. Tha alcohol is completly hidden in the flavors. Medium bodied with a wonderful carbonation just make this beer even more attractive for a winter's evening when a stout just won't hit the spot. I will drink many of this, just like I do every year until the supply runs out."
"A solid beer from SN, wish it was a year round bomber."
"I am going to the store to buy another sixer. I am going to age one of these too. Another fantastic seasonal from Sierra Nevada."
"Excellent Holiday brew, ask for it in your stocking."
"Drinkability is excellent. This beer is ready to drink right now. I have never been a fan of aging this beer, and I certainly won't do it this year either. Happy to see this classic beer again!"
"What can I say? This is the beer I most look forward to each winter. Amidst all the Imperial Stouts, Winter Warmers and Barleywines this exceptional ale is the one I thirst for over the summer months. Not too strong to prohibit your consumption and not too bitter or sweet to turn your nose/tongue. It is in my opinion a perfectly balanced ale (for a hophead) and is one of the few moderate alcohol beers I choose to drink with a fine cigar (usually it's Imperial Stout or Barleywine). I've found it has enough alcohol to allow for storage, I've had some 2 year old examples that were phenomenal, more balanced if you will. Each season I try to squirrel away some in the back of my liquor cabinet but they usually don't make it past the spring. I'll have to come back to this one when I've got it in front of me so I can give full notes on appearance and taste and the like. Until then... prost!"
"*It's an American IPA with a Belgian Farmhouse/Saison kick; an odd combo but it works very well."
"Drinkability is pretty solid; it's under 7% ABV so drinking a couple won't kill you. The hops take away from it just a little, since there is only so much of that [presumably] you [I] can take. With that said, however, come the holiday season, it is a beer that you could easily drink all night when it's cold again."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice one finger creamy off-white head, some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is hoppy, slightly malty, and a good dose of caramel. The taste is hoppy still, slightly malty, and caramel. The finish is slightly dry, and still pretty bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, this brew is still very tasty after quite a few years, highly recommended."
"Worth trying when December rolls around"
"Overall this is one of my favorite beers of all time (out of the 460 or so that ive tried)"
"Pours a reddish brown with a light head. Reminiscent of tinted SNPA. Slight spicy odor with a hops backer. Tastes quite smooth with the hops popping on the tongue. Finishes with a strong hop bitterness left in the mouth. Despite this, I actually find that the milder upfront hops make this a very drinkable beer for me."
"The age of this bottle may have affected it's quality. Brewed in November 2006, drank in July 2007."
"D: About as drinkable as an IPA gets, this beer is easy going down and only leaves you wanting more. I had this beer in November, and it was much more raw, the mild aging seems to have mellowed it out a bit, making it more drinkable. Can't wait for the 2007 editon, a must have this holiday season."
"2006 bottling. Pours a beautiful copper color with a voluminous cream colored head which leaves lacing down the glass. Grapefruit, citrus in the nose. Flavors start with hops, hops in the middle and hops in the finish. some biscuit malt sneaks through in the middle, but the malt character is muted compared to the hops. Nonetheless this is a very tasty beer, definitely a good candidate for an evening's session."
"This appeared to be a darker, but not truely red IPA. Not overly impressive but not without its charms in color alone. It did provide an inviting appearance with the generation of a smooth and thin head. The nose was unfortunately unimpressive. A bit ""standard"" for an IPA, it was hoppy but no smells came to mind other than ""beer, stronger than fizzy yellow"". Not displeasing in aroma, just not complex. I have to admit, the taste was very pleasant indeed. It stood it's ground in my mouth yet was not overpowering nor diminutive. A light hint of smoke, hoppy and over all pleasant. It unfortunately, leaves a strong aftertaste that lingers longer than some houseguests! The mouth-feel was the true winning quality in this ale. It wasn't thick, nor thin and carbonation was spot on. The overall drinkability was good; I would pair this with a burger or some barbecue anyday. A nice strong cheese or anything salty for that matter would really be a partner to this very drinkable but otherwise undistinguished IPA. Final comments: stronger than the regular Sierra Nevada but don't get overly excited for this celebration."
"D-Sierra Nevada does it right despite their size, this is a great IPA and a wonderful seaonal treat."
"Mouthfeel is good, smooth, nice texture, its a definite plus. Drinkability is excellent. I probably drink more of this than any other Winter seasonal beer, and look forward to it every year."
"D: The taste of the hops in this beer is a little much. Not sure if its the type of hop used or just too much but its very bitter on the palate. Good beer but not a real sessionable beer for me."
"Taste is bitter with citric notes of lemon and grapefruit. Yeast profile is pretty clean and bitterness is not sharp but rounded. I can't put my finger on the hops that have been used. I thougt it was Amarillo, but in the end I can't determine which hop it is anyway. For me the hops are citric and grapefruity. There is a light sweetness and the beer is a little sticky. Body is medium."
"I was really surprised when I read the other reviews on this beer so I tried it again and I just can't get past the bitterness. It pours nicely and has a nice color and looks like an enjoyable Christmas/Celebration ale but I was really surprised by the taste. Most holiday ales that I have tasted seem to play with the mixture of spices. It is always fun to try and figure out what the brew master was playing with, and they are never the same. The bitterness is so powerful in this ale that it completely masks any other spice. Sorry, I did try."
"understood until I tried Celebration. Damn Tasty."
"I just had this on tap, and like a beergeek took notes. i was suprised when i got home to see how highly rated this beer was. i generally really like sn, and i like ipa's. this beer looks nice, but the problem i have is the harsh dry bitterness. its more complex than other beers etc etc, but i cant get past it. i have had bitter beers, and dry beers, but for me this was just too harsh with nothing to balance it out. Im sure i am in the minority and im willing to try it again. but my vote right now is that this is just too harsh."
"Damn! Hoppy and resinous with a terrific malt presence. A great balance between big hops and mellow, wonderful sweetness. Feels like a great amber ale mixed with an I.P.A. Lookout-the drinkability is outstanding and the mouthfeel is brilliant. A new favorite."
"More bitter than many, but drinkability is still very high. A must have for the holidays, and too bad they don't brew this year round. Although it ages better than most IPAs, so why not stock up and enjoy it throughout the year?! I certainly do, and all I have to ""celebrate"" is that the taxes are done."
"A classic American IPA. I deeply regret only buying one of these."
"Superb seasonal IPA. The 2005 seems to be slightly better but then again my palette may just have changed to some degree. Regardless, a tasty beer"
"Pours a nice amber color with less than a finger of head which leaves a fair amount of lacing. Aroma is pine and floral hops with a lean toward the pine. Taste is floral hops up front with the pine following through. Leaves a very dry, bitter taste. Not enough citrus hops for me. Not unlike GD's Titan IPA, IMO. Good IPA but I am not sure I understand the very high ratings on this one other than it being a seasonal/limited release."
"D: A good change of pace from all the typical malty, spicy winter brews. A must buy year after year. Be careful though, the alcohol will definitely sneak up on you."
"Although not even exceptionally hoppy I think this beers is still too bitter, too dry. Especially in the finish it developes a harsh bitterness, almost medicinal. Leaving a very dry mouthfeel like you've been sucking on a piece of rusty metal. I shared the bottle with a friend and I'm glad I did because I probably couldn't have finished it on my own. Smells ok though, fruity and flowers, like most American IPA's."
"Almost too easy to drink, it's refreshing and addictive. I think most others would agree that Celebration has its rightful place any time of the year. A classic IPA."
"Drinkability: High. Quite high. This is my kind of session beer. I might mix it up with a few darker or maltier holiday offerings, but this is a good one on which to fall back."
"D: A fine example of a winter seasonal. Nice balance of hops, malts and christmas spices. An easy drinker that leaves you craving another sip. Recommended."
"An all around excellent beer. Very tasty and well made. I'm not a hop head, but I do enjoy the hoppiness and floral notes in this beer."
"A very nice IPA with a lot of charm. Will definitely drink again."
"Drinkability: Good, One of the better hoppy winter warmers. Would rate it in the top 5 I sampled this year."
"Good mouthfeel and drinkability. A classic winter-type IPA and very tasty."
"This is a great cold brew."
"Pours amber/orange in color with nice two finger head that waslow to dissolve.Sweet floral smell. The taste is heavy with pine with sweet in mouth at front and bitter hop finish. I can't drink to many of these.This beer to me was a SNPA on steroids!"
"beer pours a solid orange with a very nice white, bubbly head. The smell is hoppy but faint. the taste is a little hops and a little spicy. A well balanced easy to drink beer. This one is very subtle to me but so delicious. Probably my second favorite SN beer after Bigfoot."
"one thing i really like about this beer is it does not leave that dry feeling in your mouth after a few sips its not to acidic or carbonated, very drinkable."
"Drinikability: Refer to the last sentence of my 'Taste' comment."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer has a light feel to it and goes down easily. I can and do session this beer. Personally, I think this is Sierra Nevada's best beer. Overall, a great offering for those who love hops and bitterness. This is starting to disappear from the shelves and I'm going to miss it until reemerges."
"Awesome beer. Highly recommended. I only bought this because of all the talk about it. Everyone was right. Thank You!"
"Damn, my third review of this brew... thought it was my second - ah well. Anyway, the 2006 version pours an unfiltered, lightly carbonated amber/bronze, with a finger of tannish head that leaves light lacing, eventually reducing to almost nothing. It's aroma consists of pulpy orange and grapefruit, with toasted malts and notes of solvent alcohol. On the palate there is bitter white grapefruit, pine, apricot, lime?, toasted/caramel malts, and some heat. The body is medium, with coating, almost numbing hop oils, and it leaves a long, citric finish. More fruity and citric this time around, along with more evident alcohol - this one needs some time to cool down - I've got two bottles for cellaring purposes so we'll hope it improves some age."
"The drinkability is through the roof for an IPA, there is no hint of the ABV and it is incredibly smooth overall. Sierra Nevada really should make this a year round release."
"This is an awesome example of an American IPA not overly hoppy but crisp and dry. It's just a pity that this is Sierra's winter beer and not available all the time."
"Drinakbility - I love it, but if you're not a hop-head, you will probably find it a little over-powering."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my pint glass. Appears a mildly cloudy, golden amber color with two fingers of dense, off white head. Smells of malted grains and citusy hops. Tastes of lemon, pine needles, resinous hops. Bitter and dry finish being moderate both in body and carbonation. This is a classic American IPA. One that I look forward to every year."
"D - Excellent! A hop-head's delight. I really don't see how this is much of a winter beer (I usually think of malty caramel and toffee flavors with cinnamon and spice when I think of winter brews), but it's really good regardless of the season!"
"Note - Sampled the 2006 along with a vertical of the 2004 and 2005. The 2004 has taken on a Barleywine like quality with time. Still tasty with some noticeable hop character but very barleywine like. The 2005 has more citrus than I get in the 2006 and is still a nice tasting IPA after a year. I would probably give the 2005 4's across the board."
"Not too much of anything, but certainly enough of everything. This beer does everything right. It's just on the edge of session-ability. I wish it were brewed year round."
"Not very thick but plenty of body that is very exclusive to the IPA style. Has a very aggresive hop character for a single IPA and definitly sticks out as one of the more notable IPA's i've ever had. Also very yummy on tap. Peace..."
"Excellent beer."
"2006 vintage. Pours a clear ruby red. Good lacing on side of pint glass. Taste is fruity and quite carbonated. The malt backbone is very solid and keeps the hops under control. Excellent mouthfeel and has the distinct Sierra Nevada taste. Dry finish. Excellent beer."
"Love the little snow covered cabin! Had my first run in with this beer at the beguinning of its 2006 brew life. It looks damn good on the pour, a very deep and rich golden color with a pilsner amount of carbonation and bright white head. The smell is all hops up front, a good sign for an IPA. In fact, I'd consider this a double IPA beer. The taste is very ""in your face"" like a Stone IPA has, but a little more of the hops oily charachter pulls thru compared to the raw bitterness. The mouthfeel is very heavy, although carbonated and damn bitter. I defintely can't see myself drinking more that three of these before being overwhelmed and at loss of a palate by the end of the night (not to mention somewhat drunk...haha), these baby's will do it, although it might be hard to stomach for those weak to hops! Recommended if your a hop head looking for something a little less agressive, but still has a punch."
"Drinkability - Good example of style. Not one of my favorites though."
"D: Easy to session this one - can't think of much that would be better to devote a night to."
"Had a 2006 and it poured a dark reddish amber color with a creamy off-white head and wonderful lacing. Aromas of sharp citrus hops, pine, some dough as well a malty background. Complex flavors of mostly bitter refreshing hops. Citrusy grapefruit and spicy pine but with a distinct malt backbone that I enjoyed very much. Full mouthfeel. Can't wait to try this on tap next time."
"The taste is of course hoppy. Spicey hop flavors dominate, backed by floral flavors. This is over an almost transparent malt background. Bitterness turns a tad salty with warmth. This is pretty light for an IPA and I might even go so far as to call it watery. If you are looking for some straight hop juice, this is your beer."
"I wouldn't sit down for a session with the SNCA, but I could see having one or two of these after dinner sitting around a fire on a cold winter night. Sounds cliched, perhaps, but this beer is anything but cliched. A solid outing by the gang at Sierra Nevada once again."
"Pours a nice amber with a pretty healthy head that both sticks around and leaves some good lacing. The smell is both sharp with spicy citrusy hops and has a nicemalt background. The taste has hops up front and deep flavors of dark fruit. Grapefruit pith makes a pretty strong appearance as well. Mouthfeel is well balanced with good carbonation and a fairly full body without being heavy. This beer is a treat when it comes out every year. A very well balanced ipa that is best when fresh and from a store that has kept it refrigerated. I think it is particularly good this year."
"My advice to you young friend is get some while you can as next December is far too long of a wait to enjoy this holiday treat."
"This stuff is very, very drinkable for a well-hopped IPA. It's a lovely winter tradition, and I'll make a point of doing some comparative review as the years go by."
"Drinkability - I really enjoyed this IPA and think Sierra Nevada has produced a unique/fantastic Holiday offering. This is a very nice sipping beer and the hops really stand out. I look forward to adding this to future holidays."
"First thing that stands out are the boldness, resiny hops. Big and bad and in your face, yet very well balanced and not palate fatiguing. The malt is rich and thick and leaves a creamy mid palate. Flavors of flowers, licorice, melon, apricot, and peach round out the taste. Drinkability is basically all day."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale, and I think it's entirely very sessionable ( it's just under my sessionabilty abv limit of 7% ). I always look foward to having this every winter, and it always goes over well, even with those who've never had an IPA."
"Pours a nice copper color gold slight gold hues. Nice slightly off white 2 finger head with tons of lacing. Smells predominantly of piney hops but citrusy and, to a lesser extent, floral hops are also present. Taste is all piney hops. I couldn't pick up any malt at all in the flavor. Nice mouthfeel, just shy of medium body, and a nice amount of carbonation. As for drinkability this is great. Despite the complete dominance of the hops I would have no problem drinking a few more of these (after all this is an IPA)."
"If your into IPA's this one is a must try."
"Very attractive, aggressive, spicy beer. An excellent holiday choice."
"A good value, a good brew. :)"
"Pours a beautiful copperish amber with a nice foamy tan head. Very lively carbonation and nice head retention and lacing. Smells slightly sweet but mostly hoppy, with some citrus. Taste is lots of hops up front, followed by some malt sweetness and finishing dry and bitter. Really nicely balanced and the lingering bitter finish is not at all unpleasant. This is really a nice IPA; too bad it's just a seasonal. I will certainly look for it and enjoy it every holiday season."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with a nutty astringency. Pure pleasure. Were it not for the 6.8% abv, one would want to just sit drink one after another. Recommended, emphatically."
"A classic thats oft raved about, but nothing special to me. Certainly fresh and made to high standards with good ingredients - just not a combination that really works from the bottle least."
"Drinkability: Damn! Every year, they the slightly alter this beer, but they always bring out the best possible rendition. This year is no exception. Seek it out while you can. It's probably off the shelves as I write this (Jan. 24th), because they release it around Thanksgiving (methinks that date is a bit early). Anyway, those in the frigid climes of the Midwest will appreciate this beer after walking their dog through subzero temps, and frozen snow and ice everywhere. This is THE beer to take the edge off that walk, my friends. Merci, moi frere Monsieur Marcobrau."
"The 2006 edition of celebration ale, it pours a deep amber color. There are visible signs of carbonation, with a quater inch off white colored head forming. The aroma has a slight citrusy scent, but surprisingly a strong malt aroma is very dominant. That malt starts the flavor off, and then midway, the citrusy hop flavors become present and linger on the palate long after the beer has passed by. A medium bodied feel, that slowly thins out as it reaches it finally destination, my stomach. This was disappointing, SNCA, to me the standard for being a hop monster beer. Perhaps, my expectations were high, it just seems it falls short."
"Though I find it to be an enjoyable and unique beer, given the distinct hop flavors I can't shake the feeling that this is just a gimmick (or seasonal treat... if you're less cynical than I am) based upon their Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Of course, if you like that beer this is definitely worth a try! And on it's own it's worth a shot as well. I think that I'll limit myself to just this 6-pack, though -- after you've tried it, you might find it a bit pointless to try again. If I want a pale ale, I'll get one -- and if I want a spicier, sweeter beer, I'll get one. I don't really need them combined."
"Overall a worthy effort. Great beer to enjoy with a piece of galic grilled chicken and roasted potatos. A decent offering to enjoy while it is availiable. Not my favorite in style overall but as a seasonal, it is worth waiting for."
"Overall, something you could drink for a long time. The abv would get to you eventually, but it sure is hard to tell its anywhere over 5% when youre just drinking it. If you dont like hops, stay far away, but for the rest of us, this is sheer delight."
"D - A let-down to be sure. I probably won't buy it again. It wasn't bad, but there was nothing to denote it as a ""Celebration"" beer, and as an IPA, it wasn't spectacular."
"Eric"
"D - The initial flavors rated a 3.5, but as it wore on, it became a 2. I guess if you slam this beer, it wouldn't bee too bad, but then, what is the point? I was unable to finish this beer."
"A nice IPA, however this doesnt strike me as a winter brew."
"I could have and have had quite a few of these in a sitting. Not balanced by any means, the hops dominate this one, but it is quite good none the less. I can get this for $5 a sixer, so this is my winter staple. Bottoms up!"
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for bringing this over!"
"pours honey amber color with a off white two finger head that settles to a thin layer on top with a good lacing to the finish. honey, clover, spice, and citrus all come through on the smell. taste is slightly, sweet, honey, with grapefruit but not the bitterness associated with it. mouthfeel medium, good carbonation and hoppy after taste. nice beer."
"Definitely not the Holy Grail I was expecting. How is this an IPA again? Ok, they got away with adding spices to a PA and it still tastes decent; I'll give them that. This, to me, (2006-07) had a red apple flavor, with some hard conditioning. This is better than any winter brew I can think of at the moment, but again; not something I would put high on my overall list..."
"2002 Edition, opened on 3/3/07. The beer poured a dark copper, forming a 1 inch thick head, that left light lacing on the glass. The aroma is light citrus, with an equal amount of caramel. The flavor is not as hoppy, having very little citrus flavor, but with alot more caramel notes. A bit odd, but I guess thats what happens when it ages. Medium mouthfeel, but with a smoother finish. Its hard to say which I prefer, the aged or the fresh. Either way, this is still one of my favorites from Sierra Nevada."
"Nice medium bodied beer, smooth and significant in the mouth. Mild carbonation burn in the back of the throat. Drinkable? You bet!"
"A very nice IPA to be sure! It has a copperish-reddish translucent color, with a fluffy head that retains well. The smell is dominated by the hops: piney and citrusy. The taste is again dominated by the hops - not too too bitter, but the piney hops come through along with a little grapefruity citrus and a flowery taste, rounded out by the esters that give it a nice medium body. Flavorful, but not as dominating as other American IPAs. Definitely a step up from Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale. Nice carbonation, very enjoyable. I'd love to celebrate with this beer again!"
"A rich antique gold, perfectly clear, with a fairly resilient white head. A faint whiff of lemon and spice. Assertive hop bitterness with malt coming out in the middle, leaving with a slight bite of CO2. Medium mouthfeel. Not the most drinkable, in part because the hop bitterness is a bit raw rather than the multilayerd bitterness you get out of other IPAs."
"My favorite of any Christmas brews. This beer screams of warm chestnuts and under-afghan-cuddling with a loved one. Drink a glass or two and watch 'it's a wonderful life'. You'll be teary-eyed by the end, I guarantee. A beautiful beer to look at poured: a deep, amber-brown, reflecting the light shades like her dirty blonde hair used to. upon first sip the spicy taste explodes throughout the mouth followed instantly by that Sierra Nevada bitter kick, stronger this time than in the pale ale or porter, but balanced perfectly by a fuller body and stronger taste. The finish is wonderful and leaves me wanting another. Season's greetings, friends."
"Overall, this is MY pick for the winter brew of the season. Of course, if I could find more better beers where I live that could possibly change..."
"D: Highly drinkable (which is one reason I buy it by the case each year). I remember a few nights at St. Andrews Pub in NYC when I enjoyed multiple imperial pints of this on tap and regretted it the next day (at 6.8% ABV it's slightly stronger than your average beer)."
"CRAZY, AMAZING, RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME HEAD with awesome retention. I won't be able to get the retention off with scrubbing even. The smell is hoppy, but some malts come out. I like ipas that aren't just hops. This is one hell of a beer. One of my top IPAS. Malty backbone and awesome hoppiness. A true treat. Mouthfeel is nice and fullbodied. Good, but nothing mind blowing. This beer is easy to drink, and a beer I wish was year round."
"Drinkability: Quite high. I could see myself enjoying a number of these over a sitting. Too bad I only snagged one to give it a try. I will make sure I grab a six-pack next time. Too bad it's seasonal because I could see drinking this one year-round."
"D - l wouldn't mind drinking it every xmas. I only had a small glass of it, but you need to like the bitter taste of grapefruit to enjoy this."
"this is not a beginers beer.only those who appreciate the way beer should taste will like this.pours a nice creamy head laces nicely down the side of the glass.nice hoppy taste.this is a good special occasion beer.you are not going to sit back and throw a six pack of these down.good taste good look good call."
"Drinkability: After drinking craft beer for a couple of years now and even after this beer has over 1,000 reviews, I finally got to try this beer. I thought it was fitting to try now, since it is Christmas now as I right this review. I don't think I would drink this years Celebration Ale any more, but I would like to see how this beer turns out differently every year. If you like to celebrate hops, then this is the beer to do it with."
"Appears orangish copper in color with a nice 2cm of foamy white head and good lacing. Some sediment. Smells of holiday spices like nutmeg and clove, along with a citrus smell and caramel. Taste is bitter, very much pale ale, with spices and pine, but with a malty finish. Very little citrusy hops though. Medium in body and smooth. Definitely a beer I will continue to grab for the winter months, a nice twist on standard winter brews with the nice hoppiness."
"This is a great IPA. Flavor is balanced and complex. Just wonderful. A beer that can live up to the hype. Outstanding."
"Pours a clear orange-copper with firm visual evidence of suspended yeast. Frothy off-white head pours convex (!) into my bulb, and seems to last a good five minutes before subsiding. Lacing is about as good as it gets. Nose is grapefruit, juicy pineapple, and resiny pine with both pale and biscuity malts all but submerged in the background. First sip is piquant; spicy hops meet pungent-but-well-mannered yeast and sweet pale malt. A firm but not overshadowing hop bitterness lingers from one sip (or gulp) to the next. Fruity, with notes of honeydew and pear. The alcohol is considerable not as prominent as it might be if this were a lighter-bodied brew - it shows itself in between the sweet, light fruit notes of the malt and the firmly bitter (and slightly citric) hops. Moderately full bodied but drinks ""lighter"" than it is. Carbonation is ample . . . has a cleansing, semi-creamy mouthfeel, never a dull moment! The hops really shine here, with both aromatic and bittering qualities vying for your complete attention, and of the latter there's always been some of the same back-of-the-throat bitterness that you'll get when eating a fresh grapefruit. Slightly minty qualities to these hops, too . . .A classic brew, and about as consistent as they come. Also one of the benchmarks for the American IPA style - hardly a hop-bomb, this is a well-balanced and full-featured brew that seems to offer something for everyone!"
"Drinkabilty: I'm going against the grain here, but I think this will hold up for another year, although it's sure tasty right now."
"An excellent effort and very worthwhile drinking. I will be buying some more of this next time I'm at the liquor store."
"poured a deep copper with a 2 finger head and attendant lacing. The aroma was dominated by a strong floral hoppiness. This is a hop lovers dream. Spicey, bitter, citrusy hops dominated this brew from top to bottom. Yet, there was enough malt in the beer to balance the taste out. The finish was just dry enough with very little aftertaste. The carbonation kept it all together. While strong in alcohol content, you won't know it until you stand up. This is truely one of their best beers."
"Drinkability: A damn fine ( and Hoppy!) holiday brew to have every year. Really nice hop flavors and a kick to boot , make this my go to christmas beer if im in the mood for a hop fix during the Winter season."
"I like this beer a lot, for what it is. It's not something I'd drink a lot of or have with a meal. It's more of a ""slow drinkin' , sittin' by the fire"" kind of brew."
"A nice brew...."
"This beer has a very nice copper red color with high clarity and a white head. Great head retention and excellent lacing. Holy hops the smell is all hops a lot of spicy hops come through in the nose I may be getting a little vanilla in there too. The taste is again spicy from the hops with a bit of citrus flavor to round off the spice. There is a peppery bitter aftertaste as well that will stay with you for a while. The taste reminds me of something but I can't place it though. The alcohol isn't really noticable masked by the hoppiness. The mouthfeel is good with the right amount of carbonation light for a winter beer but good for an IPA. An IPA is an intersting choice for a winter beer but this one works, because of the high level of spicy hops for me the drinkability is a little low because of the intense flavor. All in all it is a good beer, a nice change of pace from the dark ale based winter seasonals."
"M&D - will be too bitter for some, but a great sweet/bitter IPA, SNCA lives up to the hype, another great SN brew"
"Incredibly smooth and delicious. The alcohol stays in its place. Like in years past, this one is not to be missed this year!"
"Drinkability: Much more drinkable than the typical American pale ale due to the exceptional mouthfeel. Why doesnt Sierra Nevada brew this year round?"
"note: Not a bad bottle. I bought a case the day it arrived locally and I'm already into the 3rd sixer."
"It feels rather creamy, with tight carbonation. Highly drinkable (I will be finishing the 4 that I have!)"
"2006 poured into a pint glass. A light reddish brown color, with a nice thick foamy head about 1 1/2 fingers. Head clung to side of glass during drinking and disappated reasonably fast. Aroma was hard to detect, slight hint of something I couldn't place. Taste was reasonable. Started off slightly bitter, but that quickly changed and became very slightly sweet. Very easy to drink. Felt right in the mouth, not to watery, and not to clingy. Pleasant beer, but not what I was expecting for a holiday brew."
"I want this all year round. Celebration is never a let down."
"As the ale hits the tongue it goes through some stages, albeit very quickly. A quick burst of honeylike earthy sweetness that quickly gets replaced by a big grapefruit hop presence. This is just thick with oily and piney hop character. Dancing across the tongue, the light malt is completely overshadowed by a clinic in the flavour characteristics of hops. Not as flowery as some, but everything else is there in full force. Be warned, there's little in the way of a yin/yang balance in this one, it's just one hell of a hop wallop. This one dries the palate nicely, and I didn't find it to be overcarbonated, just enough to introduce you to the flavour profile. Drinkability comes down to your enjoyment of bitter beers, and for me, this could be a great session ale in the right mood. Some days I was a hop monster, some days I don't. That said, this is a hell of a brew, and I'm looking forward to next year's offering."
"Great drink...I wish just one Canadian Micro had the balls to make a classic IPA this good!"
"Pours a dark amber with a thick head that ends up as a thin film while drinking the second half. Great lacing all over the glass as you drink it. The smell isn't that strong as most other IPAs, but it is hoppy, somewhat malty, and faintly fruity. It tastes a lot hoppier than it smells. A lot of bitterness and a caramel malt character. It's medium bodied and very hoppy on the tongue, a great mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty good. All in all, a good beer, but certainly not as tasty as say, Stone IPA."
"This beer was absolutely wonderfull on-tap. The hops were there but not overlly bitter. More sweet than bitter. There was also some hints of vanilla and some spice. IPA meets winter warmer. One of the brewers best. A very drinkable brew."
"This is a very drinkable beer."
"D - Very nice beer. A little bitter for my taste, but I think it represents the style very weel."
"Pours copper colored with lots of white head which leaves lots of lacing as it dissipates. Aroma is citrusy hops and some malt. Taste is citrusy hop flavor, carmel like maltiness and lots of bitterness. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Lots of flavor and well balanced, this makes a good session beer."
"Cheers"
"Cheers!"
"The reappearance of Celebration is definitely one of the many highlights of the beer calendar."
"Drinkability is excellent. Goes down easy and tastes great. I wish I'd bought two, since I'd like a second right now! A fantastic American IPA, and one of my favorite beers."
"Cheers."
"There have been few beers i've enjoyed more than this beer. A definite winner all winter. I'll be purchasing this again for sure."
"Drinkability: For a hoppy brew, this is easy to consume. It also hides the ABV well...could be a dangerous thing!"
"(2006 edition)"
"D: Smooth, drinkable beer. A nice IPA, regardless of season...I almost wish SN would brew this year-round. Then again, some of the specialness would be lost as this IS their 'winter seasonal'. Recommended for your enjoyment."
"Verdict: Celebration is a new beast every year, but they are all consistantly good, this year was no different. Pretty good, easy to drink, worth picking up a couple times over the season, but when its gone, I am not counting down the days until its released next year."
"I don't feel like i'm im being generous giving it straight 4.5's. This beer is amazing and only gets better with age. One of my favorite christmas beers, if not my favorite."
"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale 2006! Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness date on it. Poured into a pint glass - clear, definitely orange color, medium sized head. Excellent retention - it lasted all throughout the tasting. Smell is overall sweet and warm: toasted grain, spices like clove and cinnamon, oranges. Taste is complex: begins with a light brush of hops on the tongue. They open fully on the back of the tongue. Strong pine, some acidic citrus quality, too. Not much of the barley or spices. The hops seem to get stronger as the beer warms to room temperature. Good aftertaste - the hops continue to morph. Mouthfeel is right up the middle: not too watery, not too creamy. Overall, a strong offering in both the Christmas ale and IPA categories. Would gladly pick up one of these again."
"Here's to Celebration!"
"Very attractive orange-amber color, pours a thick, white, frothy head that dissipates kind of quickly but a thin white lace persists. Aroma reminiscant of grapefruit and pinetree with a hint of orange peel. Though the three ""C"s (Cascade, Chinook and Centennial) dominate there is a slightly sweet malt and alcohol note to the nose. Flavor is hop-dominated with a good amount of malt backbone. Quite delicious. More malt and alcohol notes as the beer warms. Decent body with a slight stickiness perhaps from the high amount of hop resins? Overall, a very enjoyable American-style IPA, too bad it's only available during the holiday season."
"This is one of those GREAT with food brews. Pours clean and tastes crisp, with a stand-up creamy white head. The hops are distinct on the tongue and beg to be backed up with a plate of seafood nachos or a zesty Jamaican burger and sweet potato fries. This beer is joyously missing the residual sugars which bog down many the winter season ales."
"Sierra Nevada's Clebration Ale pours a nice amber color. The nice and thick foamy head is descent sized and lasts for awhile. The smell is floral, hoppy. The taste has a bitter character to it, as one would expect and hope for in an IPA, but this seemed to ovewhelm any other intended flavors. A nice basic IPA, but nothing really to celebrate."
"Pours a clear copper, fluffy white head, collapses rather quick, big bubbles, nice lacing. Smell is piney, citrus, caramel, spices, very nice, reminds me of the holidays, neat cinnamon-hop aroma. Taste is strange, almost medicinal, toffee, pine, citrus, heavy spices, bitterness is out of whack, not sure whether I like this. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, some residual sweetness, medium carbonation, a little aggressive. Neat flavours but I don't think they hold up to the bitterness."
"A very hoppy offering from Sierra Nevada just in time for the holiday season! A dark copper with a sizable head (2 fingers), the flowery hops were extremely pleasant in the nose. Also detectable was pumpkin and cinnamon. Nice hops balance in the taste, with some hints of honey and ginger. A fine and quite drinkable AIPA for a seasonal offering. I will come back to this brew several more times before the end of the season."
"Tastes fantastic. Good balance between the chocolate hints, spice, alcohol and hops. the citrus and piney hops are very well maintained and not overpowering, but it is an IPA. Very nice drinking. Easy finish. Crisp. I should get some more!"
"Drinkability: I find this to be slowgoing, and I don't think I'll make it through the whole six pack, before I find someone to give it to."
"D - Due to its cleaner balance between hop and malt, the Celebration is a nice change of pace in the IPA canon. Not my favorite winter beer, but it will do nicely on a cold day."
"Nothing wimpy about this beer, but it's not heavy, either. Very drinkable."
"My review was pretty unhelpfull and incomplete but I drank three of these in the course of two and half hours and pretty much forgot to write much down. This beer is great and it will kick your ass if you have more than one or two. A christmas must!"
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily isn’t filling, this is definitely a beer to stick for an evening."
"Overall a really good beer from Sierra Nevada and something I look forward to every winter. Try it if you get a chance."
"i don't really know what i expected from this beer. but i was definitly pleased. a great winter offering, considering most breweries pump out over spiced liquid pumpkin pie and call it a winter offering, this one is awesome. wish they made this all year round as it's definitly up heir on my ipa list. not as good as smuttynose finest kind in my opinion, but definitly good. easily drinkable and very welcome in my fridge this winter."
"D: The ale is very drinkable. I enjoy the subtlety of the spices and the boldness of the hops."
"Enjoy!"
"A gold/red/orange color graces my tall glass. Not much aroma to note, at least not as much spice as I was expecting. I taste a little spicyness, with a hint of citrus, and I mean a slight hint. Feel is good, definitely not too harsh. I recommend one or two for the festive spirit, but that will suffice."
"D - Like I said, it's a very good IPA, but nothing in it made it stand out to me as a holiday selection. I'm going to grab another bottle and try it on-tap, just in case..."
"M & D - complex and medium bodied with a nice oily character. I love this beer every time."
"Extremely drinkable. If you enjoy beer with strong bitter hops, you'll enjoy this beer. I enjoy some hop bitterness, but have had plenty that were too strong for my enjoyment. This beer, however, was a perfect amount. I may have to have a side by side comparison with the regular Sierra Nevada Pale Ale to see the difference."
"A decent offering from Sierra Nevada, obviously popular, so maybe I'm missing something. I think it's good but not as excellent as some of my associates."
"Pours a rich amber, color is very nice, it is topped with a two fingered frothy head. Smell is hoppy with a bit of malt and spicy. Tastewise it is a well hopped beer and there is enough malt to keep it balanced. The alcohol is really jumping out at me. The spice flavors dont seem to hit until the aftertaste. The hops are rather citrusy. Nice beer, not one to just sit cack and pour down however."
"The 2008 version of celebration is by far my favorite. Gone is the pineyness of the previous versions. In its place are the floral/tropical fruit notes I love. The 5 on drinkability may be helped by the fact that I paid like 90 cents per bottle! Quite possibly the best SN beer I've tried."
"Overall an excellent, and different American IPA. Should be a regular this holiday season."
"D - It was very good. It lived up to all the hype."
"Overall, IMO Celebration is not living up to the hype, however it is still a good brew."
"Enjoyable and drinkable winter brew that's a good alternative to the heavier wintertime sippers...also a good value."
"Mouthfeel was zesty and slightly oily. A very solid IPA."
"I've got a 2005 (kept in the fridge all year) open next to a 2006 and the difference is pretty substantial. I loved the 2005, and it is still beautiful. It starts out clean and bright with a silky mouthfeel and then comes a wave of light sweetness & autumn leafy hop complexity, and then comes the hard concentrated hop finish that lasts and lasts. The 2006 has a burst of pleasant hops at the start leading into a long lingering hop finish, but it is far thinner on the palate--there is a whole mid-range fullness/richness missing, and the overall hop impact, despite the nice long finish, doesn't have the same lush glory without the core complexity to play off of. The 2006 doesn't seem anything more than some typically pleasant IPA."
"Overall: As IPA's go, it's tough to imagine it can get any better than this. I used to wonder why it was that everyone would rush out and buy case upon case of this stuff when it was released. Now I understand."
"Mouthfeel is good, with a puckery finish. Very drinkable. If you like their pale, it stands to reason you'll like this. Nothing to get too worked up over though."
"The look is nothing out of the ordinary for an IPA except the color is darker than most. The smell reminds me of going christmas tree hunting after Thanksgiving. Pine, holiday spices, and the hops are in the sent. I am also wondering if there is a little tea-tree oil in there. Great beer for holiday meals, maybe not a honey ham but it could do it. Laces hold up but the head does disapper quickly."
"Pours a garnet amber color with mild carbonation, a frothed off-white head, and distinct lacing patterns. Smells of a balanced mixture of toasted malt, caramel, toffee, bright citrus, pine resin, and slight butter notes. Oily hops hit first on the tongue and remain as an underlying flavor throughout the tasting, on to the aftertaste. In the middle there comes the sweet malt body, full of toasty, candy-like tones. Finishes bitter and slightly dry. Mouthfeel is certainly more than middle of the road and it has a slight, prickly carbonation which amplifies the hops on the tongue. Highly drinkable, although the alcohol is pretty big on this one."
"D: One of the best offerings during this great season. Solid IPA. Highly drinkable--could almost be a session beer if the abv was slightly lower. Hell, if you're by the fire place with good company it could be a session beer!"
"Thinner medium body with active carbonation. Hop oils give it a slick feel on the tongue. Dry, slightly bitter aftertaste. This is one tasty brew. It didn't take long for me to work through a six pack, which could be a bad thing ;-) . I will be grabbing more of this one before it's all gone."
"Very good and highly drinkable. It can sneak up on you, because the ABV is so well integrated. Not sure why this is a seasonal winter warmer, since it is such a traditional IPA."
"A very nice IPA -- one I could imagine drinking all year around. For a winter seasonal, it would sure go nicely with chicken right off the grill on a nice day."
"Drinkability is very good. Naturally, hop presence is very pronounced but it is certainly welcome."
"For being a x-mas beer I'm glad the holiday spices are well intergrated. I wish I could find this on draft some where to see if the head would be more impressive. Props for Sierra Nevada for coming out with a 12 pk. of celebration ale this year!"
"overall: i can see why this is marketed as a winter brew, but i could really enjoy it all year long. however, maybe the seasonal aspect makes it all the better. this beer actually always reminds me of a kind of everyday, sessionable version of SN's Bigfoot."
"Overall- Not as strong or potent as I recall from earlier years but regardless still a solid session beer."
"Very refreshing beer. Good example of an American style IPA. Recommended whenever it's available."
"Extra round flavors of bitter but not overwhelming hoppiness and enough balance to keep me interested. Aftertaste is mellow and moderately oily and resonannt in the mouth. Texture is fluid in the mouth, unmarred by alcohol or carbonation. I could easily down a few of these. I find this easily superior to the more common SN pale ale"
"2006 edition. A deep amber color with a half-finger off-white head. Some lacing left on the glass. Nice aroma of piney and citrusy hops. The taste is exceptional. Some malt but mostly hops. A lasting bitterness at the end. A very tasty beer that gets even better as it warms a little. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a decent amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good but not great due to the biting bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall, a great IPA that is worth celebrating. This is surely to be a yearly tradition."
"Finally got this in my area and well worth the weight. Pours a light and moderately hazy copper with a very nice, thick yet light head. Very nice lacing. Very floral and fruity in the nose with light grassy undertones. The taste is exceptional as well with a medium body and a welcome blasting of hops. Again the grassy grains are present. Very nice. Incredibly drinkable. When I had one, I absolutely had to have another. This beer will just make you happy-- period. Cheers."
"After having aged for a year the 2005 is slightly darker both in body and head color. The head holds and laces better as well. In the smell, the hop flavor is much more subdued but the malt aroma seems much more complex. The taste reveals the complexity with a subdued hop flavor but very fruity and diverse malt profile. There is sitll a good amount of bitterness. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied and stickier than the 2006 version. Overall this is a very complex and much better beer than the 2006. It is almost like a lower alcohol barleywine and its very good."
"A holiday beer not spiced up,just a very good IPA."
"Overall: The first time I had this beer, was about 5 years ago, before I liked anything other than Fat Tire. I got a pint of it at a punk show because it was on sale for $2. I hated it. I dont think I had it all. I thought it tasted like a flower. I cant believe how wrong I was. This beer is great."
"This is a holiday favorite that I wish I could enjoy year round. This delightful brew sets the benchmark for what I consider to be wonderful IPA."
"D - A sixer of this would compliment an afternoon of raking leaves."
"Pours a nice copper color with a good creamy head that leaves a nice lacing. Smells of hops and freshness. Very good taste. Hoppy. Some hints of grapefruit perhaps. Finishes very clean and is highly drinkable. The high alcohol content is masked very nicely. Another great selection from Sierra Nevada."
"Copper-red body with thin offwhite head. Smell is mostly hoppy with a hint of malt. Hops dominate the taste - not surprising considering it's a Sierra Nevada... Some roasted malt is also evident. Flavorful and drinkable... Very good... For me though, it does not quite live up to the hype..."
"Overall it's a fairly standard IPA. Good, not great."
"This is a very drinkable IPA, it has a nice balance, a good crispness, and a tasty hop profile."
"Overall, this is very well done. It can be a bit of a shocker if you spend a great deal of time with the aroma, as to me, the aroma and the taste were almost polar opposites. They compliment one another quite nicely, however. This is a very drinkable beer, and I'm certain I'll have another before it disappears for the year."
"Pours a hazy, copper color, not much of a head really and some decent lacing. Nice hop pressence in the nose. The taste is more of the same however, there is a decent malt pressence as well. Very good mouthfeel and pretty drinkable. Pretty solid IPA."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper color with an off-white head. There's also excellent lacing with this beer. It smells mostly like floral and pine hops, and also a bit of malt and spicyness too. The taste is also mostly grapefruit and floral hops, with a little bit of breadiness. It also has a lasting bitter aftertaste (in a good way). The mouthfeel is slick, with a good body to the beer. The drinkability is good too, it's nice and smooth. I think this is a pretty solid beer, I need to go out and buy some more of this!"
"D- if not for the price (a little pricey but not too bad) and the fact thats it is only available once a year, this would be the beer kept in my fridge at all times, a great sessionable IPA"
"DA: These are great for a celebration....of life!"
"Mouth: Malts and fruit up front and strong hops in the back with some alcohol notes added to a long bitter finish. The most flavor shines through in this beer after the swallow, where more fruit and maple syrup mingle around with the spice. A bitter tinge remains that is not all that enjoyable. Mouthfeel is good at first but thins right at the end, making the finish a little less powerful."
"d - another good offering, this seems much hoppier than past releases. i think this beer is as good as it gets after one year of cellaring so we'll see how this compares this time next year..."
"After all the Celebration bashing, my expectations were low. Yes, it does taste different - a bit more balanced, a little less in your face with the hops. But I really, really like this beer. It had plenty of hops for us hop heads, but I don't think it would over power the casual, non-geek. It poured gorgeously into the glass, with a beautiful head and just the right amount of lace all the way down. It was just plain hard to stop drinking after one bottle, something that I hope won't happen again. Go out, buy it, and enjoy a very pleasant, but not paradigm shifting, brew."
"Definitely a good IPA. This one seems more balanced than last year's version, but I don't know if that's actually the case or if my tastes have simply changed. At first I didn't think I liked it as much this year, but after having a few, I can say that's not the case. A solid beer that any IPA-lover should pick up. Recommended."
"Well, here's to another 100 reviews, and then some! Cheers!"
"At first the hop nose and hop on the tongue don't seem as pronounced as last years, but as it settles in time in the glass, both seem to appear to reveal its true original character. The grapefruit emerges and all is well. I love this beer."
"The 2006 Celebration Ale poured from a bottle into a pint glass to a dense two finger head. Very nice lacing. Looks deep reddish gold. Citrus hops in the nose. Mostly grapefruit. Spicy grapefruit taste at first with a grainy hop finish. Crisp and dry. Very drinkable, nice hoppy head buzz. A fine IPA."
"D: I remember this being better last year. Nothing offensive here, just nothing special. A very average beer IMO."
"This beer pours a orange amber with a thick white lace that sticks to the glass with this offering. The smell is citrus piney hops, with a honey lemon candy sweetness. The taste starts with a citrus rind bitterness that leaves a smack on the tongue followed by a balancing sweetness of caramel, and faint presence of alcohal but in by no means overwhelming. This is a quality brew that is a hop lovers delight and gives you just enough balance to keep your palate coming back for more."
"Pours a rich amber ale with a thick head that stands firm and ready to be taken. Scent of roasted malts and hopps are present. A floral essence along with a fruity citric bite. A nice ipa and great session beer next to the fire or just hangin with the fam for the holidays!"
"2006 edition. Pours a very clear, brilliant dark amber with a yellow cream head that almost glows in the dark. Gorgeous. Grapefruity hop aromas mix with a slight carapils note in the aroma. On the tongue, initial citrus sourness mixes with distinct, saliva-producing bitterness -- just the right amount, not too little, not too much, not too harsh. Carbonation is substantial but not overdone as it helps all the flavors of this beer come out. Malt sweetness provides a solid base. The finish is long and smacks of whole-grain bread. Everything here is so well balanced. It's got depth and sessionability. A stellar example of an American IPA."
"Drinkability: Richly flavored, but perhaps overly bitter. Deceptively inebriating, but ideal for providing sustenance for the long winter months. Above average brew."
"Very good IPA from the folks at SN. This is the brew (along with SNPA) that really got me into craft beer, and I have been looking forward to its release for awhile now. Regardless of what others have been saying, this year's batch lived up to my expectations."
"Notes: One of those beers that makes winter seasonals such a great event."
"D: I'm drinking my second one right now, and I don't think I could drink any more tonight...too hoppy. But certainly a great beer to have one or two of before changing to something else. Highly recommended."
"D - One of the better IPAs out there."
"Easy drinking, time to stock up. Last year's got better with over the past year. I have a feeling this one is best right now. Drink up."
"D: This doesn't drink like a 6.8% abv beer, that's for sure. But it perhaps suffered from too much hype. It was a good beer, but it didn't change my life. I will say that the one really nice thing about this beer is that it's not reminiscent of winter at all, but it IS warming. It's fruity, flowery, piney, and bright, so it's reminding me of some warmer/nicer days from a few months ago."
"I was expecting more of a cinnamon/nutmeg type flavor considering the season and the label but it seems like more of a summer beer to me. Nonetheless, I would drink this any time of year and I could definitely get enthused about more than one."
"One of the better beers from Sierra Nevada IMO. Not nearly as interesting as Bigfoot, but still one that I look forward to each year. Good overall, but not the greatest IPA out there...."
"D - one of the great seasonal brews of all-time. Wish they made it year round. Tasty, well balanced IPA."
"I highly recommend it and will definetely be buying more before the end of the season."
"Give it a shot because it only comes out once a year, but it's just not very good this year in my opinion."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Great for a cool October night such as this."
"Overall a great ipa. Not one i could sit with a six pack, because it just seems to rich in flavor. I want to say i liked last years more, but cant be sure about that. Very nice."
"D- This is a nice beer for a cold night. Drink up."
"Overall I felt this beer was a bit imbalanced and way too hop-focused. For what they're going for I think Sierra Nevada did a good job but it's just not for me."
"M: slightly syrupy at times, still remains light and refreshing. full to medium bodied and very drinkable. This is a great Holiday session beer."
"Having a beer like this around would make any dysfunctional family gathering worth celebrating (mental note to self: must get more for upcoming christmas season!). Would make great session fare, and is also a great example of the american IPA, and would serve as a great intro to the style for someone ready to see just what hops are all about. Ill be drinking (and reviewing) this one again. Already have a vertical tasting in mind, with my lonely single 12 oz bottles from 2004 and 2005. Can't wait!"
"Pretty balanced beer from Sierra Nevada. I'm enjoying these but they don't live up to the hype that they have received."
"Thick and creamy full-bodied and well-carbonated mouthfeel with just enough alcohol to give it that warming feeling you'd expect in a winter/Christmas ale. Very smooth and addictive, though a bit of a dry finish."
"2006 edition. Aromas of pink grapefruit, manderin orange, and a touch of pine. Black peppery hop flavors is the first thing I notice, followed by more citrus flavors. Theres sort of a mellow malty break mid sip, before the fairly assertive woodly bitterness takes hold. Theres also a kind of sublte spicy quality that seems to wash over the palate as well. This is some quality stuff. Thanks to by ""beer mule"" Reid for bringing this tasty treat back from Minneapolis for me."
"In closing I honestly believe that 06' has something missing from the 04' & 05' brews. I must be honest and say I don't know what's missing."
"I can't wait to compare to the '06"
"Another cheerful year of Celebration Ale. Very drinkable as always, and although I believe I scored them the same - this years version seems just a bit better than last."
"If you like hops, this beer is extremely drinkable. A very well crafted beer both in the recipe and the execution. A near flawless example of an American IPA."
"D - A great, highly drinkable, yet robust beer. I love it!"
"Drinkability? Hell, I once got a keg of this with some friends, and it was so drinkable I fell over three times."
"D - All night"
"So i was a little bored today, so I decided to venture to the small liquor store down the street from me in Sunderland that I had never been to before. I walked in not expecting much, but to my sheer delight, there was a sierra nevada 2005 celebration ale sixer from last year sitting in the cooler. Needless to say I was siked. Anyway, pours a really nice looking dark orange/bordering on red coloration, with a relatively thick white heading that lasted right up until the end. Smell was my only gripe with this beer. Seemed to smell like wet dogs hair, although it did get better as it warmed up a little bit...oxidation? Im not sure. Taste on the other hand was really super...the hops in this beer really attack your taste buds to the point where you can taste them well after finishing a glass. Mouthfeel was pretty heavy, but not overpowering. This is an awesome sipping beer...it really warms you up. The alcohol is also really well hidden, so ide recommend being careful with this one. This is a really awesome beer, complex yet simple at the same time...my favorite offering from the sierra nevada guys. This paired well with some sharp blue stilton cheese, though i can see it going well with just about anything. Cheers"
"With two years of age, this beer definitely takes on an old ale style. The medium-dark fruit flavors really come out, and the hops bitterness tones down a bit. This is my first aged-beyond-a-year taste of Celebration ale, but from what I've heard and read here on BA, two years is about the perfect time to age this particular brew. I have to say that it has definitely gotten better with age."
"D- A near perfect IPA. Hoppy without killing your tastebuds and complex enough to keep me coming back for more. I wish this wasn't a seasonal."
"trying to reach the minimun here... I love the fresh article, it is just chock full of all good things pale ale...enjoy it younger."
"(1996 - 8/1/04) Has become way to old. Sweet and oxidized, no more hops here. I'll take a 1 - 2 yr old please."
"D- I see why there is such hype around this beer. Absolutely delightful and sessionable. Balance in thsi brew is awesome. I am completely amazed by this beer."
"2003 bottling. Poured a hazy reddish orange color with a 1 finger head that took a while to go down. Aroma was flowery and hoppy at first sniff, with sweet malt aroma making itself known after a few minutes. Taste: hops are definitely there, but are not nearly as prominent as a fresh example. Malty sweetness has taken over and the piney, grapefruity character of the hops has diminished. The beer had a medium bodied mouthfeel. Drinkability was fairly high and no alcohol was evident. This beer can age with the best of them, but I prefer my Celebration Ale fresh with a powerful hop presence."
"I could drink this year round."
"This fresh hopped version has a bigger nose, great hop flavour (a little more peppery), light fruity esters (vanilla and peach), nice malt & body. An all around great brew. Thanks for an awesome extra Rutager!"
"D: Refreshing and delicious. Easy to drink/session. Great IPA that is good fresh and keeps well (at least short term, don't have long term experience). I prefer this to SN's IPA because I prefer the American IPA over the English version."
"This is a perfect indicator of how tastes change. First time I tried this beer I thought it was a hopped up mess, but now I cannot get enough. Flavors are perfectly blended with some intense piney hops coupled with a mild malt sweetness. Once the pine has passed, grapefruit infuses the palate with a juicy citrus sweetness that follows through to the finish. An excellent beer that I wish were offered year round. Time to stock up on more before it's gone."
"i'd say it aged pretty well (does two yearsmaybe not evencount as aged?)"
"In all my celebrations the only notes I find are in the margin of Jackson's ""Great Beer Guide"" page 428."
"Overall worth the hype it gets and then some. Great hoppy IPA style and I am extremely glad I could find it this late in the year and enjoy the hell out of it."
"Drinkability: I'll be buying a lot of this come winter so I can enjoy it all year round! Great representative IPA to introduce the style to people."
"a fine brew by sierra. i like this one is a lot better then the actual sierra nevada ipa. this one tastes more like an ipa. i thought the other one just was a clone of the pale ale."
"Overall: Yeah, I like this one. Not quite as smoothly integrated throughout as DFH 90 minute, a little brash on the hops, but a darn fine IPA just the same. Strongly recommended."
"Tastes dead on for Stone IPA, I just had them side-by-side. That's a good thing in my opinion."
"Drinkability is good, a very delicious beer here, indeed. MK"
"The beer poured a deep, lightly reddish amber with a finger of head that retained through half the drinking. The nose was very piney, spicy hops. The flavor was intensely spicey, hoppy flavor. I can see how this beer would work very well during the winter months, which is originally when I bought the two six packs this one eminated from. The beer's hoppines sits well in a medium bodied ale with enough of a maltiness to prevent it from being grossly unbalanced, but the beer is a masterpiece of piney hoppiness. A true contrast to other IPA's like Two Hearted. This is a super drinkable beer though because of its flavor (I like the hops) and also because of its medium body and light alcohol taste at the finish of a sip of this ale."
"Poured to a fairly hazy reddish orange color. Very good aroma.. a mixture of fruits (mostly apples), cinnamon and other spices, and chocolate. A spicy and bitter IPA. Had a good, long finish. Many seasonal Christmas beers seem to be marginal, but this was a pleasant surprise."
"This is a pretty solid beer, but the mouthfeel really seemed thin for an IPA. It might be due to the age, but this was in my fridge and not my ""cellar"" so I don't think it went bad. It's still a good beer, but I feel it's better when it's fresher."
"Each sip of this medium bodied beer is smooth on the palate. The flavor is mostly citrus hops with notes of orange and apricot. Some spicey notes are mixed in as well. It finishes somewhat fruity with lingering flavors once the beer is gone."
"Slàinte!"
"If you like SNPA, this is basically it on steroids. A hop lover's dream."
"Medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"This beer rules. I just feel bad recommending it to you since it's hard to find now that winter is over, but if you can still find it - well, don't worry about the 2005 at the top, IT'S STILL GOOD! Otherwise, just keep it in mind next winter."
"A celebratory beer for sure, very festive, and a pleasure to drink"
"Taste has that ge na say quoi...oh I know. Sierra Nevada. They have a trademark taste and this is it. Starts off with the taste of an amber then the hops kick in. Not to bitter, just a nice baseline to go with the malt. Finishes with just a touch of citrus."
"Thick and creamy head. Brilliant amber color. Aroma is piney as is the taste. The flavor is rather one dimensional, no malt balance to play the hops against. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkable, yes, but I feel that there are better and more balanced IPA's to be had."
"Incredibly drinkable, I could drink these all night then wake up and drink one with my eggs and toast. Incredibly smooth that slides down the throat."
"D - Very drinkable, but not a beer I would want to stick with all night."
"Drinkability - well, it won't go *bad* in storage but it's yummier when fresh."
"They only thing bad about it is SN may as well put Santa on the label."
"All in all , a good brew..could have more tha one."
"I broke out my 2002 vintage last night. No special occasion, just itchin to drink it. But man was it worth the wait. Pours much hazier than a fresh one, but still retains its head and lacing. Nose grew more delicous than ever, the hops toned down, with ripe fruits and a sweet, caramel maltiness that hides the alcohol in there. Hops have mellowed down in taste too, replaced by a deliciously smooth caramel malt, and is just a beautiful ride. But it still retains some of that signature hop profile that Celebration is good for. I'm definitely glad I started keeping a few Celebrations in the cellar each year."
"My only complaint would be its limited release. It becomes very difficult to find toward the end of January."
"Overall - A winter brew for hopheads! Not that this can only be enjoyed by hopheads. Even though the hops are the strongest flavor, they don't overwhelm, and the beer has a very quenching character. It had me reaching for more and more. Too bad this is only a seasonal. I could see myself reaching for this on a chilly summer's evening as well. Alas, winter 2k6 isn't that far off..."
"A satisfactory and hoppier take on their everyday (and very good) Pale Ale. There are better holiday ales, but the lower ABV (by holiday ale standards) makes it a good alternative if you're not looking to get blitzed 'n' bleary-eyed over the holidays."
"overall it's a really interesting beer. full bodied, but light and with a very lager-like feel. definitely quite enjoyable."
"Picked up this 2002 edition at Blue Max last week and it did not disappoint. I would have liked a more edgy hop bite, but the smoothness is unlike any other IPA I've tried."
"This is the perfect beer. Color, head, taste... everything. I even like the fact I have to wait until Winter to enjoy this wonderful ale. Perfect hop character, wonderful Cascade aroma. I could drink this forever. I can't wait to find this on tap somewhere."
"Very nice, always glad to accept a Celebration ale! Great hoppiness, nice color and aroma. Nicely balanced. Not like some ""holiday"" beers that are nutmeggy or the like, this is like a darker richer version of their pale ale. bigger, but not sure i'd call it an IPA."
"In summary, I love it in small quantities, but overdose can release undesirable effects."
"I gave the smell a good-plus because it's a got a nice aroma that probably supercedes its taste a bit. I gave the mouthfeel and drinkability a good-minus because it's a tad too bitter for me. The taste is good, though it does leave an extremely long hop/bitter taste lingering in the mouth that doesn't do much good for this beer. I'm not sold on its outstanding classification on the site. But to each his own."
"poured a nice deep amber color with a very thick fluffy head. it had a strong aroma of hops and floral qualities. i found it to be rather mild the first time i drank it, but when i sat down to review it i thought it had a sharper bite to it with hints of floral and hops flavors. i almost think it had a slight berry taste to it. mouthfeel was of a medium body with smooth consistancy."
"Mouthfeel/drinkablity: If you are a fan of Sierra Nevada already this is a great beer. I think that sierra nevada has a very distinct flavor going on and this appears to be due to their hops. I will have no problem finishing the rest of these....I find it is wonderful...I'm glad I got to try it before it is gone for the season."
"Dark copper or light amber in color depending how the light hits it. Tiny bubbles rushing to the top of a thin 1/4"" beige head, light lacing throughout the entire glass. Subtle aroma, very balanced with hops and malt. Taste is hoppy, feels like a mix of pine and citrus on the back end, but very balanced with sweetened malt. Very smooth, crisp finish, perfect feel on the palate, extremely well carbonated. Wonderful balance of flavors, not too subtle yet not too overpowering. Delicious."
"Lots of hop oil flavor. Citrus hops and pale malt. Great IPA with plenty of delicious hoppiness. Hop dryness leaves me wanting more."
"M&D: full flavoured and very approachable due to its creamy texture; again, the 2005 version is another successful brew proving the consistency of the brewery's artistic skills. Incredibly juicy and exceptionally delicious American IPA. Can't wait to try the 2006 vintage~~"
"Drinkability: One of my favorite IPAs, this one has a great hoppy taste and is extremely well-balanced"
""
"2005 Edition. I found this lone 6-pack at Shaw's in Concord NH, so I decided to bring it home. Pours a orange/yellow color. Smell is a bit like fruit. Taste is a nice malt flavor with lots of citrusy hops flavor. Mouthfeel is very nice.Overall another winner from SN, hope I can find it again very soon."
"I was lucky enough to find a sixer of this stunning beer from the 2000 vintage at Route 59 Beverages in Nyack NY. With a full five years in the bottle, this one now is a soft dark auburn stunner. Smooth mouthfeel, nose of subtle brandy and piney hops. Mouthfeel is pure velvet. Notes of smokey brandy, pine sap, vanilla and rum soaked blondies, yum. A few years in the bottle and the flavors are soft, balanced and meshed. Put Celebration away for a few years and you will have some wonderful, soft and smooth stuff."
"A nice beer, pretty drinkable for the style with lots of flavor. If anything a bit too hoppy, but that's typical SN for you."
"D- The hops are really enhanced by the malt but this beer is still very drinkable."
"Pretty good. Definitely drinkable. Hell, I had four in a row."
"I truly can say nothing bad about this beer, even though it's filling, I can drink this strong ale into eternity...I recommend that you do the same...Cheers!"
"I will say that on tap this brew is slightly better in aroma and taste. might just be the freshness, but there is a difference! I have a 2003 in the freg. it will brought out before 2006 is over to compare! It is a west coast AIPA and the full body with the overall overwhelming bitterness make this brew a true winter delight."
"Let it also be noted that it's no secret SNCA holds up surprisingly well to cellaring. Not long ago I participated in a multi-year vertical and they were all fantastic."
"Good quality all around."
"Overall - An excellent beer. My first ever SN Celebration and i wasn't disappointed !! Highly recommended !!"
"Nice hop aroma. Pours very nice with a frothy white head on a copper body. Citrus notes follow a mild malt profile and big hops are present through out. A less in your face IPA which is more to my personal style. Still was kinda sad there was no cinnamon or fruitcake flavors cause when I see snow on a bottle I think spiced ale :-("
"Pours a dark amber with soapy, bubbly head about 1/2"" which receeds to a slight covering. Slightly sweet, piney, fruity (citrus) in the nose. Flavor is dominated by those signature SN hops. Light body with a little alcohol bite in the finish. Not sure what makes an IPA a winter seasonal, but this is a pleasure to drink to remind myself what makes this style so great among the standard winter fare."
"D: Overkill on spicyness and carbonation makes this beer tough for me to finish. It would for sure be a one beer drink for me, Id drink it again bc it tastes good but it gets old quickly."
"Wow. This is beautiful. Pours a deep orange-amber (the color of honey) with a solid, thick off-white head. Smells of bitter grapefruit rine, pine needles, and spice. MMM. The taste is wonderfully complex, and the thick and sweet malts present stronger as the drink warms. A wonderful beer that simply gets better with each sip. Great to sip slowly and really appreciate, or refreshing to drink relatively quickly as one would a standard IPA such as Harpoon. This may be my favorite IPA, and one of my favorite seasonal offerings. Fantastic. I'm buying up as many as I can before they leave us until next year."
"This is a very drinkable beer, with a distinct and festive character. Its not a typical winter beer, but its light and lively and would certainly spice up a holiday party. Celebration Ale would be good year round."
"Drinkability: SNCA is what I consider a quintessential American IPA. A beer that I look forward to every year. That being said, its very well balanced, plenty of hoppy bitterness as well as a mildly caramel like sweetness in the middle. A beer that I could drink all day. Highly sessionable even with the 6.8% abv, which is very well hidden. Can't wait for next years edition."
"The best American IPA I have ever had! In the glass, the beer has a nice medium amber glow to it with a white head that laces fairly well upon drinking. Very hoppy aroma that is expected with the style. The taste is backed up with more hoppiness and a harsh bitterness which gives it a sharp finish on the tongue. Great beer, would definetely look forward to next year's."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The most important need for improvement IMHO is the mouthfeel... it is rough, and the carbonation slightly hurts the drinkability. I'm loving the burps right now, no problems there... I feel terrible that my sweet, loving wife has to deal with my bedtime etiquette tonight. All in all, an unmistakeable IPA that will continue to have a home in my beer cellar 'til the Hop Gods come for the keys."
"2005 release. Pours a hazy shade of copper,with a massive three finger head crowning over very active tiny carbonation. Very dense foam shows excellent retention and leaves rings of sticky lace. Hoppy nose, pine and citrus and a slight herbal/earthy aroma. Toasted amber malt first, then raw american hops take over the flavor leaving a coarse yet satisfying aftertaste. Herbal and bitter, it balances well with the sweet amber malt flavor. The medium body and high carbonation smooth out the onslaught of hop oils and the mouthfeel turns out rich instead of harsh with a surprisingly mild finish. An outstanding IPA."
"Bravo, Sierra Nevada. You nailed it in 05. I hope next years offering is as good as this one. A near perfect beer."
"defently a beer for the colder seasons."
"Crisp and oily on the tongue, it will warm you up with the 6.8%"
"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color beer with a nice foamy slightly off-white head with excellent retention. Aroma of citrusy hops is quiet evident as well as an evident caramel malt presence. Taste is a well balance mix between semi-sweet malt and citrusy and bitter hops. Body is fuller the average with a good level of carbonation. Overall, this is well balance IPA that I would love to have access to all year around."
"I was very surprised to find this on tap at the Marriott Newport RI hotel bar. I had asked if they had SNPA and they didn't. (What a great substitute!!) The bartender was a proud hop-head and is a lot more knowledgeable about beer than I am. A great chat as well as a surprise encounter with a familiar, top-notch beer. I didn't notice much difference between the draft and bottled versions. Bars are dark so my 56 year-old eyes didn't get to enjoy the apprearance as much as I do at home. The aroma, taste and mouthfeel are exactly the same as I encountered in my review of the bottled version. While I gave them the same numeric grades, I might hedge the comment I made about this being an outstanding session beer. A few of these and the ""session"" would definitely be effected!!!"
"Served in an imperial pint glass at 3F's BP. A large off white, thick head sits atop a bright amber body. Floral and grapefruit hops with some ""cat piss"" Columbus hops greet the nose along with some carmel malt. The body is medium with the citrus hops leading the malt. The finish is full and satisfying. A great beer to drink and not too much alcohol to have more than a couple in a single sitting."
"A hop celebration."
"It's a great IPA, I'll grant them that. And it's a fun beer to have around the end of the year, but for a ""celebration"" I feel it's a bit too much of an IPA to be enjoyed in quantity with the family around the fire at the holidays. I'd be more than willing to buy it again, but just not necessarily for its intended consumption setting."
"Rusty orangey color that's clear and pretty. Smell will wake you up in the mornin- hoppy and strong, nose-tickling. Earthy. Bitterish. Taste is awfully tasty. Bursting with hops. Overflowing, even. Tasty hops with a citrusy kick. The maltyness isn't soooo well-balanced with the hops, but it works. Mouthfeel is sudsy and smooth, fluffy and creamy. Nice and bubbly. Very drinkable. A tasty concoction indeed."
"Poured a lively deep amber with gold highlights and an offwhite head that stuck around quite nicely leaving some lace. The aroma is full of grapefruit and spicey hops with only a touch of malt sweetness. The flavor is very hoppy and it is just like the aroma with lots of grapefruit and spicy hops, the bitterness lingers along with the flavor well into the finish and the malt is hard to identify. The mouthfeel is good as the CO2 isn't too high which would make is seem too bitter and the viscosity of the beer give the impression that the beer is very full bodied. Very drinkable even the 6.8% can't stop me from having a few pints of this."
"So, this would make another SN Beer that makes a high grade, and makes a great Pale Ale with a kick, as opposed to other IPAs, this one really defines what an great IPA should be."
"The body is light but the beer is easy enough to drink. Other then the bitterness there is nothing wrong. Overall I wasn't too impressed."
"Overall a great beer from Sierra Nevada. A little bit more in the way of flavor than the Harvest Ale, although overall not quite as drinkable. Excellent, hoppy, beer..."
"Pours a nice copper color with a fluffy head. Strong hop smell and taste. I couldn't drink too much of this, bit hoppier than I would want for a session beer, but it is a tasty brew, especially for those liking a nice hoppy taste. Definitely worth a try."
"I look forward to this beer every year. I always hear that it was ""much better last year," but this is only my second year tasting this beer."
"Even after aging, it is a little strong tasting. Sierra Nevada seems to be over-hopped on everything I have tried from them. This is no exception. I'll drink it again. I'll buy the '06 release when it comes out. I won't make a session out of it."
"Appeared a lovely golden-orange with yellow hues in my pint glass. Aromas of pine, grass, citrus, and hops were evident, but this time they worked very well together to create a bitter, hoppy smell. The taste was just terrific with loads of hops just jumping all over my tongue. Initial hop bitterness grows ever so slightly with each sip leaving behind an aftertaste that beckons you to take another sip. Just delightful! Some malt is present, but not much compared to the hops. Very good drinkability because of it's moderate ABV and flavorful character."
"I could probably drink two in one night, but that would be my breaking point. Definitely one to pick up next year though."
"This is bitterer than I expected considering most fall/winter seasonals tend to be malty and over spiced IMO. I will be seeking this out in forthcoming seasons as I find this a very delightful and drinkable beer."
"No more intimidation! Celebration Ale will be a brew I look forward to every year, now!"
"Taste; initially starts out a little sweet, and then the hops kick in with a strong piney bitterness, and it finishes with that spiciness. Mouthfeel is meium bodied and slick from the hop oils. Very easy to drink as long as you enjoy hops, and I do. Overall this is a very enjoyably IPA."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle of Sierra Nevada's 2005 edition of Celebration Ale. A very nice golden amber color with a rather huge frothy head that stuck around awhile. Very good lacing along the edge of the glass. A strong, but not overpowering, hoppy aroma that somehow started out a little fruity and then mellowed. The aroma itself literally made me salivate. The amount of hops in this beer explodes in the mouth (really meant for those who love their hops). A nice crisp finish to the beer, in spite of the level of hops present. A very drinkable beer in itself, but I'm not sure if I would have more than one in a sitting. The amount of hops used may mask the flavors and aromas of other beers one would want to enjoy afterwards."
"It seems to be getting better as it warms, but I really don't want another of these. I'll finish this bottle, but won't be looking for this one next holiday season. This seems to be quite popular, so I guess it's just my particular palate that this doesn't agree with. This was a 2005 bottle."
"D- Drinkablitliy is high can put a six pack of these down at least"
"This is a beautiful beer that could be enjoyed all year. It has a nice orange-amber color with a small head and pretty lacing. The smell is predominately spicy. . It has a great spicy taste, and is also fairly hoppy. I think the bottled version is more hoppy than the one on tap. Either way, a great beer that can be enjoyed any time. It is 6.9% ABV, so be a litle careful."
"Not sure why this one deserves the ""Celebration Ale"" moniker and the winter theme because this is an outstanding beer that can be enjoyed year round. Anyway, poured a crisp, clear, light amber with very good carbonation, medium, off-white head, and nice lacing. Aroma was both fruity and flowery and reminded me of sitting on the back porch in the summer evening enjoying a nice brew. Taste was crisp, clean, and refreshing. Had more body than I expected. Very tasty brew."
"Hops, hops and more hops. This one reminds me of an IPA I tasted in Boise, ID from a taphandle labeled in masking tape and Sharpie magic marker. This beer dances just below the threshold of Imperial IPA pushing hops (very grapefruit-like bitterness) and alcohol. Two words - Game On."
"What a great seasonal brew! The amber color and lacy head was begging to be enjoyed, and enjoyed it was. There were smells of citrus and hints of caramel malts, which led to a sweet taste before the hops came in. It felt light inside the mouth, and was very drinkable. Actually, for the amount of hops present, this beer was extremely drinkable- which is what I would label its best quality."
"Poured a clear amber colour into the glass with a medium fluffy head. Aroma is spicy and citrusy with a bit of caramel malts noticeable. Taste is slightly sweet and smooth before the full affects of the hops takes over. Pine and citrus flavours with a spicy dry finish. Medium bodied with a good level of carbonation. Definitely a solid beer and very drinkable."
"I could drink this all night, but unfortunately, this is my last of the season. Must buy again!"
"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale was poured from the tap into a pint glass. The color was a great copper hue with a thin head. The head faded into a thin top layer but left some lacing down the glass. The smell was a combination of caramel malts and wonderful spicy hops. The taste was hoppy on the tongue and finished with a light caramel note. The brew was crisp and did not leave any off flavors on the palate. Very drinkable and very satisfying, this is a great choice and I highly recommend trying one if you have the chance."
"Smell is hops: piney, sweet citrus lemon, but also a good sweet backing peaking around. The taste, again, is hops. But that's what this beer is. The citrus falls away in the flavor, but the wonderful piney hops rush forward. It finishes with the bitterness of the hops playing around (maybe fighting it out) with the good amont of sweet malt that you notice just at the end. A bit of toasty malt hints through as the beer warms. A great beer to drink and is very drinkable at 6.8% ABV."
"One of my personal favorites. Outstanding. I hear it's even better when aged, but who could possibly hold onto this stuff long without drinking it?"
"Cheers!"
"This beer came an amber orange with a thin film of head. Smells primarily of different citrus fruits and dry piney hops. Tastes like a SN's pale ale with some cinnamon, a honey sweet malt and orange zest with a grapefruit rind finish. Mouth feel is medium bodied with a crisp carbonation."
" I'd certainly buy this again and would put this near the top of the seasonal and holiday brews that I've consumed so far this year. Sierra Nevada's offerings never let me down and always amaze me with their quality, refining, and overall taste and aftertaste. A truly great IPA from a truly great brewery!"
"Mouthfeel is a little heavy, a little oily, but in a good way. Lips remain sticky after the drink is finished. Oddly, drinkability remains high despite its bold flavors. This is the gold standard in American IPAs, one I have sessioned on many occasions."
"The flavor continues the pattern of dry bitterness. There's also a bit of citrus, but the bitterness is more prone to dehydrate the inside cheeks and tongue than to invoke any juicy analogies. I'd love to describe how this ale develops as it warms, but I sincerely doubt it will last that long. While I'm typing, the alcohol warmth begins to glow in my tummy and puts a smile on my face. This is one of those beers I look forward to every season when I can see my breath in the morning."
"Beer poured a orange-red color with a half inch of head with left incredible lacing. Smells of hops that bring a citrus aroma as well as pine. Taste is of pine and citrus as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with almost a perfect amount of carbonation. Drinkability is very good, each drink invites you back for another."
"I have to say I'm quite dissappointed in this beer."
"This is my favorite offering from Sierra Nevada and I can't wait to try it every year around Christmas time. This beer pours a beautiful golden brown with a nice white head .Smells of pine and citrus are the only two things I get from this one. Taste is best described as fresh, wonderful hoppy flavor that is so well balanced with a malty aftertaste. This one is not for the rookie beer drinker as the hoppiness tends to scare some away so I don't have to worry about anyone touching my six pack when I show up at a friends house."
"I have to write another review to counteract my lower bottle review earlier this month. Just yesterday I had this beer on tap. A surprising treat at The Corner Room in State College, PA. Yes, we all know most beers are better on tap, but this one was MUCH better. It was so smooth, balanced, fresh and beautiful that I was sorry we only had time for one. In my previous review I remarked about how I didn't think SNCA quite lived up to the hype, but now I think otherwise. It's definitely highly recommended to try on tap."
"Drinkability: This is the winter brew I've been waiting for! Complex and spiced just enough."
"This is a great new generation brewery in the US and is in the mountains, near Chico, California. The brewery is known for beers full of character and complexity. This one is for winter and is aromatic and lively in flavor, with hints of oily dark chocolate and lots of lemony hop bitterness. I personally don't like a lot of hops, but this one is pretty good. Sierra Nevada is famous for India Pale ale, which to be honest, i'm not a huge fan of. But check this one out, it is a good christmas ale. Not quite St. Arnolds, but close."
"A great seasonal offering from Sierra Nevada. Keep up the great work!!"
"Nice job. Keep them coming SN!"
"Overall this is a very well-balanced beer for an American IPA and a very easy drinker. The alcohol is barely noticeable and the malt and hops are both well represented with neither overpowering the other. This is much like a bit heavier Sierra Pale Ale. A little more of everything, but is still refreshing enough to not wear out the palate. After recording my initial impressions, this beer was used to wash down a roasted garlic white pizza which had four heads of garlic in the sauce and topping. The Celebration Ale stood up to it and was very effective in keeping my palate scrubbed fresh. A great combination."
"It does alright but I still don't love it. Probably a little too woodsy for me. But definitely a good beer compared to a lot of the winter stuff out there."
"Quite similar to SNPA, maybe a tad fruitier? I've absolutely enjoyed this one, and will be enjoying it again as soon as I can. Very nice beer, I'm surprised its taken me this long to get around to it."
"I think this is the same beer... Sierra Nevada prints the year on the collar of each generation, and this is from 2004. The smell is overwhelmingly of wheat and sweet malt. The body goes down really easy with the hops adding a pleasant kick in the end. The mouthfeel is great as well, especially after you've had a few. Like most Sierra Nevada brews the first few sips of this beer are big, but it mellows out and becomes much more enjoyable."
"Overall - This is a better version of a Siera Nevada IPA, more balanced than a straight IPA, a little richer. For a ""winter"" brew, a little light. Could use some darker color and a thicker taste. I'll be buying another 12 pack of this for the holidays."
"Clear coppery orange with an eggshell head. Good lacing throughout. Toasty malt aroma underneath a lot of hops: earthy, citrus, and pine. Resinous bitterness throughout, but it really builds into the finish. Malt sweetness provides some balance, but the hops are really dominant. Light citrus with a huge dose of pine in the end. Moderate carbonation with a rich, creamy texture. Medium body. Not bad at all. Goes down easy. I'll try it again next time I run into it on tap."
"Opinion: Well, amazingly enough from my review, I think that this is one of the better years for Celebration in at least the past 3-4 years. It is hard to review them as a vertical tasting as the hops mellow as it ages. This one is probably the most balanced of all that I have tried thus far...out of the box. Contrary to many others, this is not my favorite beer. I am amused by it though, so I have to keep trying it. I normally put some back too, so I can try it later. I believe that this beer is really in its prime at least 4-6 months after its release. I would recommend this beer, but mostly for the fact that it is an icon in the micro-brew community."
"The carbonation is just right, and the hops aren't overly bitter but are rather nice and floral. They don't crush the pallete, and the hop taste lingers for a very long time."
"Drinkability: Be careful with this one. It is strong, but the hops, taste, mouth feel will deceive you. Pay attention to this beer as it only comes along once a year."
"A bit astringent at times but great drinkability. Definitely one to keep around all winter to add that warming feeling and keep the cold bite out of the body."
"As the 727th reviewer of this beer, I'm sure I'm adding a tremendous level of not-yet-seen insight here. Pours a bright, translucent amber hue topped by a nice-looking inch or so if creamy white head. Pleasing aroma of crisp, spicy hops, tempered by some caramel malt and the lingering essence of black pepper. Hop flavor is sharp and assertive up front, mellowed only slightly by some caramel malt. Notes of pine, black pepper, grapefruit, and some astringency come through. Body is rich and creamy, belying the character of most American IPAs. If not for the alcohol, this would be infinitely drinkable (further enabled by the 32oz cups for $5 at Satisfaction's last night)."
"Flavor is in your face spice and hops. Lived up to the hype. Where can I even begin with the list of flavors that assault the pallet? Hops, nuts, whole grain breads, something vaguely cinnamon like, malty caramel the list goes on. Needless to say a very complex flavor."
"There is that hop profile I was beggin' for...huge piney hops up front but the malt backbone really helps to balance it out and not be over the top. Bitterness lingers a bit, but in a good way...the carbonation is nice for the style and the mouthfeel is medium-bodied. Very easy drinking here...a true session brew, especially fresh. I am real glad I picked this one up again...a solid brew."
"Dont get me wrong, if you like Stone Arrogant Bastard, or any of the hopped up 4000 minute IPAs, you will dig this. But a celebration ale in the old world style ? Jesus Jones- only if the old world is Portland Oregon!"
"Very good, I had anticipated this would be somewhat sweet, but was actually more bitter, and had a nice, clean hop finish. Drinkability must be great as I'm already bummed that I only have 3 of these in my possesion this evening."
"Drinkability: Another fine year for Celebration. Nicely hopped, seeems similar to previous years, except this year I was not as impressed by the appearance. Still, a very drinkable beer and a 6-pack is a must buy every year."
"Drinkability: Certainly no less drinkable than their Pale, but points are lost for lack of originality."
"overall a nice IPA, but i'm not sure what makes this a ""Celebration"" ale or why there's a snow-covered house on the bottle. seems more fit for summer."
"This brew pours a nice copper color with a beautiful fluffy white head leaving substantial lacing in my glass. Nose is citrusy and slightly malty. Taste is a wonderful blend of malts and hops, reminds me a bit of the ESB style of beer as opposed to a winter seasonal. Mouthfeel is good as this is extremely lively on the palate and adequately full. Overall drinkability is very good. This is one of my favorite winter seasonal beers in which all hopheads must try!"
"Pours a rich amber with a fluffy head and lots of lacing.Aroma is piney, smells like Christmas! Taste is of pine and citrus. Strong flavor with a bitter,but good edge. I'm glad I tried this beer. If you like Ale, this has got to be one of the very best!"
"I always make sure to pick up a few six packs of Celebration each winter. The fact that it is seasonal makes it bit more special even though it's not so hard to find."
"2006 Edit: Now that I knew what to expect, this brew wasn't quick such a sudden surprise...but I like it even more. This is really an EXCELLENT beer and one I wish was year-round."
"Hoppy nose, and definitely some mild spice, but the taste is what really impressed me. Dry hop-bitterness to begin, wheat, malt and spice faded into a rather pleasant sweet, warming aftertaste. Balanced very well, it was clean and refreshing while being a good winter warmer. Overall a very good brew."
"i had another, and another, as testament to this creation. could it have more malt balance? yeah, except it wouldn't stay true to the style. i look forward to trying future versions to compare. glad i found the last sixer at frugal macdougal's..."
"While IPAs are, in my opinion, inherently unbalanced, that would be my only complaint about this beer. Otherwise, its outstanding! Highly recommended!"
"D - Immensly drinkable, killer APA."
"this beer is a swwetheart of a brew. it has a nice amber color when poured, and leaves a nice white head. and it smells great too. starts with a real nice floral taste, the gets a little piney, and then bang like a grapefruit just popped inb your mouth. really great beer fro the boys at sierra nevada. go out and buy some."
"Another winner from Sierra Nevada. Poured out to a burned amber ornage color with a wonderfully full head of foam. Medium level of carbonation. Smell is very hoppy, with indications of spices and sweetness toward the finish. Nice. Taste is very enjoyable; hops dominate with notes of smooth malt, floral elements, and some controlled citrus character. Very nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, a unique but desireable characteristic for an IPA. Drinkability is very good. I could enjoy this regularly on the change up from my typical winter bocks and stouts. Recommended."
"Now this is a nice drop. Quality ale with a full body, good bite but isn't too busy on flavour or taste like some other winter brews. I've had it on tap and in a bottle. I have enjoyed it everytime. It's not a session ale, but if you are looking for 3-4 brews and this is available, don't think twice."
"Why doesn't SN put this stuff out year round? I would buy it year round!"
"cheers..."
"Also, I found a 2002 version of this beer in my basement. The biggest difference is a pronounced caramel malt flavor. This beer did not cellar so well as there a bevy of off flavors (or at least flavors I don't tend to like). Also pours quite hazy as expected."
"Now, if only I could find some on tap someplace...."
"Wow good beer. Certainly better than the other christmas Ales I've had, and different in that this is an American IPA. As such, hops is th name of the game with this one, it pours a dark orange with a red tint and a noticable chill haze. I think all beer that can tansmit light throught them should have a chill haze, it makes them look more tasty. At first I didn't even notice the hops but on the second sip it was obvious, not overly but quite present and very distinct. It's very complex with a heavy hopping that isn't too heavy and the hops are quite delecate. You can even smell the hops before you take a sip which tells you you're in for something interesting. Great winter brew. (recent observation: very drunk)"
"Served in a stein, pours a copper-brown color, fairly clear with a short-lived white head. Hoppy aroma. Taste is pretty much dominated by hops (not that that's a bad thing). I was taken aback on my first sip. I hadn't read the reviews, and was actually expecting a ""winter warmer"" type of beer, not a potent IPA. Goes down fairly smoothly, although I could see a non-hop head getting sick of it after a couple."
"Drinkability is nearly perfect, my favorite winter offering. If you can get to LV, go to the MGM, sit in the poker room or sports book and try not to lose your ass while knocking these back. I just cannot get enough of this stuff, I wish they produced it year round. Thank you beer gods, casino gods, or whoever decided to get hook it up for the poker players!"
"Pours a three-fingered cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Hoppy, floral nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts sweet and spicey but the hops kick in as expected with a bitter finish. $7.99 for a 6-pak of 12oz from Market Basket Concord, NH."
"Nice."
"It's seasonally available on tap as well, and makes a fine ""black and tan"" when mixed with Guinness."
"4's across the board. Nice amber orange color, ample head. Smells great, very citrusy. Taste is excellent with the right amount of bite...satifying lingering flavor. Mouthfeel is delectible. Definitely a session beer for me."
"Overall: Definitely one for the hop heads. Regardless, this is definitely a beer that you remember. I just let myself go to that great hoppiness and ride it out. I'll be looking for this every year from here on out."
"Another classic release from Sierra Nevada! Pours almost orange in color with a citrusy nose and classic hoppy-bitter from start to finish with BIG malty undertones. Almost burnt on the very long finish. Really stays with you for awhile. I don't think I could sit down and drink a whole sixer at a time; but could probably polish off 12 in a week- a little too bitter to have a lot at once."
"For balance and fairness and to show I'm not biased, this beer isn't drinkable at all. To have a second would be a chore. It's too rich, too spicy, too thick and flavorful on the tongue and on the roof of the mouth. But this isn't criticism, it's a fair extrapolation of this beer's strengths."
"This is a great winter warmer, one of the best seasonal winter beers I have had an opportunity to tast. The color is copper and and the nose is deceivingly faint. The taste however is an explosion of hops and spices and fades quickly to an almost malty sweetness on the backend. SNCA is a hopheads dream, as if Sierra Nevada gave the gift of fine cascade hops to all beer drinkers for Christmas."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is meduim to full bodied. There is nice carbonation helping to float the beer down. Very drinkable beer. I just wish it was available all year long."
"A great beer that I look forward to every year."
"This ale is strangely creamy and, as anticipated, very hoppy. I dont personally have a soft spot for hoppy beers, so this one doesnt stand out as one of my favorites. It has lots of things going on though. This beer reminds me of grapefruit and lemon peel. Bitter and spicy makes for a great winter warmer. That ABV might catch you off guard, watch out."
"Wow! This is one of my favourite brews of *any* style!"
" mouthfeel is quite carbinated. drinkability is super high for a beer this complex. I've drank a pint of this with ease. for this review i've turned it into a nice siper in a tulip and that works too. enjoy"
"D: I think I could pretty much pound these away. Doesn't have the raw power of the Stone IPA, but at the same time, it might make it easier to drink. Great brew to enjoy a six-pack of over the course of a day of football."
"This is good stuff! I don't really care for their pale at all, but this is fantastic stuff. Wish it was made year-round."
"Juicy. I guess its the light spicy quality that makes this seasonal. At 6.8% a few of these will warm you up real good. Definately well worth sampling on tap as well."
"Drinkability is good on this beer. It is just the kind of thing for a cold and wet day. A couple of these is a nice way to pass a couple of hours."
"Drinkability and Overall: Hell yeah. Go Sierra Nevada. I wasn't a big fan of last years version, but this one is phenomenal. A very good winter IPA, and one I'd like to see what age does to. This one's a winner."
"2005 edition: Purchased a single at Whole Foods in Raleigh. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Smell: All hops. Color: clear amber with large long lasting white head. Very hoppy taste with a smooth finish. I really like this beer. I was expecting a winter spice malty beer, but was surprised and very happy. Did not realize this was an IPA. A great beer, worth picking up a six pack."
"Perfect looking beer. Nice clear amber body with a tall offwhite head that lasts and lasts. Smells sweet and fruity with a kick of hops. Has a bit more christmas/winter smell to it than I expected from a style created to send beer to some of the hottest and most humid regions of the earth prior to refrigeration. Wow to the taste! It is a very fruity and well malted IPA. I'd like to see more hops, but what it does have makes the beer taste more like I expect in cold weather. Light to medium body. Dry and Crisp. I may have to go get a case of this stuff:-)"
"Drinkability: Easily dispatched with. This could be in the SN year round lineup. Then they could come out with something a bit more over the top for celebration season. At any rate this is a fine beer. As long as one realizes what this is and doesn't expect a mind blowing special production just because it says celebration, it's pretty good. This is not something that I will count down the days until next release though."
"I did like the fruitiness, though. It reminded me a bit of Southern Comfort. So there you have it: SN's Celebration Ale is the Southern Comfort of beers..."
"I've seen some other reviews complaining about a lack of balance. Though I would like a little more malty sweetness, there is plenty here to keep me satisfied. It is an IPA, after all."
"I try to rate the beer not by what a beer company ""says"" it is as I do more the style it really is, and this one is no winter brew but an excellent APA/IPA(whichever you choose)."
"The 2005 Celebration Ale appeared a light amber color with a promising thick beige head of foam. It smelled exceptionally hoppy  not surprising given its IPA heritage. I anticipated a complex mixing of flavors, but found only an almost brackish bitterness which was consistent throughout the session. I did not detect the spiced accents that Ive come to expect in other holiday beers. I only found a resin and pine aftertaste. Mouthfeel was also disappointing -- oily and thin are the words that best capture it for me. Sierra Nevadas 2005 offering is an adequate IPA, but not one that Ill be using to ring in the holidays."
"After last year really only being able to find this brew on tap, it seems to be all over the place in bottles this year. This review is for the 2005 Bottle version. Brew pours to a amber color with a small off white head that has pretty good retention and leaves a lot of lacing through out. The aroma is hoppy in character to say the least with pine like scents dominating followed by a caramel malt flavor. I think the hops really seem to make distinguishing some of the spices quite hard. The taste is nice, starts real smooth, and then quickly breaks to a strong hop flavor of pine that stays in the mouth for quite a while. Again, this is a very smooth tasting brew, one that I must say makes my day when it is available. A favorite."
"I sampled this beer at a local watering hole and was floored by it. I was expecting a decent fruity/hoppy/spicy beer and was shocked to find all that plus some real conviction. The flavors really are alive and pronounced. light fruit and spice essence hinting at kiwi, pear and ginger, mixing perfectly with a killer bold hopping. Sierra Nevada has got a real winner here. My hat is off to you folks at SN. This is one beer worthy of joining your celebration. Happy Holidays"
"Overall- Fine brew, love what it has to offer!!! Great to drink with family and friends. We all have a lot to be thankful for and this brew is definatly one !!!"
"Well integrated flavour with a surprisingly citric bent. This is a little oily on the tongue but with good carbonation and a definite lemon rind flavour with a pleasant herbal aftertaste. The alcohol is rather more apparent than I would like, but that does little to detract from this winner."

"Wow! I have never paid much attention to this brew but now I'm regretting it. The 2005 offering is a knockout. A very clear amber body was topped by a white head that left nice rings of lacing. Slightly piney aroma did not prepare me for the piney, grapefruity blast of hops that assaulted me in a wonderful way. Refreshing and drinkable. Sierra Nevada, my apologies for always considering you a mainstream, pedestrian craft brewer, when in actuality you are along with Anchor one of the pioneers. Great beer."
"Overall = This might very well be the best IPA I've ever tasted. It should be brewed 365 and knowing it won't last, I'll be buying a ton of it this season."
"This beer is a dark amber with a thick off-white head which leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is all fantastic hops- spicy and citrusy. There are also some sweet and fruit notes in the background. The taste is also dominated by the hops. Again spicy and citrusy. Also some pine notes. There is also quite a bit of delicious sweet and caramel malt lurking in the background- which the pletiful hop easily keeps in check. Really just fantastic tasting stuff. Lots of nuances come together to really make this taste like the holidays without being at all gimicky. It really manages to have huge hop and malt flavor and still be very subtle. Mouthfeel is great- medium to full bodied, smooth and creamy. Definitely very drinkable. I don't find this at all cloying which I find can be a problem with other holiday beers' drinkability. I reallly love this stuff. I think it will definitely become a holiday tradition for me."
"D - Outstanding. This goes down well. ABV is deceptively high. The hops completely mask it. 6.8 is higher than I ever would have expected from this delightful brew. Works fabulously as a session beer. Very good."
"As winter seasonals go, this is one of the best. It's slightly different every year, which makes for some intriguing tasting debates, but it's always good. Highly recommended."
"Overall, it's a very good beer, worth trying and I can't wait until they come out again next year."
" The taste is west coast hoppy. Dry, piney, bitter hops with slight grassiness. Slight caramel malt profile. Mouthfeel is leaning toward the heavy side for an IPA. This is a good beer, but it's not one of my favorites."
"I was so glad to see this on the shelves at work that I had to take home a case. Hopefully this will last past my birthday in a week, but the drinkability of this beer may prove me wrong."
"A big, strong IPA for the winter season."
"had this at MacGregors on tap (20 oz). This was a nice clear amber brown with a small head. The smell was very hoppy and piney. The taste is malty sweet but the hops dominate. Nicely bitter. Moderate mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. For some reason i found this less drinkable than other strong IPA's but it is very enjoyable to have 1 or 2."
"Nice in your mouth, but overall, a little tough to drink (especially and entire growler). Recommended for any hop head."
"Good copper color. Poured a two inch head with nice lacing. Heavy hop aromas and flavor up front. Very strong hop taste throughout with not much malt balance. Hops may be a bit overwhelming here, but it definitely is a good winter offering from Sierra Nevada. Second beer was much better. I may have had a bad one mixed into my six pack."
"This is a phenomenal beer. I look forward to this beer every year."
"Conclusion: This is one delicious beer. This is not as bitter as I remember it from last year. Very good again, though, and drinkable. Recommended."
"Very enoyable beer, easy to drink. Only had it from the bottle, never on tap. Not sure it is even available outside California from the keg."
"11/16/2005 - My palate/nose must have been off when I commented about the beer not being as good as previous years. I had a bottle tonight, and all the characteristics I love about Celebration Ale were present. It's easily as good as last years."
"This brew pours a clear amber color. The head is white and creamy. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is of pine. The taste is piney and grassy. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this brew isn't bad, but piney, grassy hops aren't my deal."
"Moderate to light body and active but not frothy carbonation. Very drinkable and tasty!"
"Thank goodness it's Christmas time, a time when great seasonals are abundant and this is one of my favorites. I remember trying this beer for the first time last year and not expecting an IPA but I was pleasantly surprised. If one wants to know what a ""floral hop aroma"" is like then dip your nose into Celebration, god does love us. Hazy copper-orange color, appetizing head, and those great hops are up front on the nose. Upon your first sip you notice the great medium body mouthfeel and a dried grape fruit, orange marmalade taste. Long, long dry finish....man I need another sip."
"Pours a rich amber color with a mild haziness. Large creamy white head. Sticks all over the glass with no end in sight. Love it! The aroma is rich in floral and piney hops. The flavor is a dream for hopheads. Has a nice sharpness on the tongue. Citrus and pine hop flavor dominate. There is a small amount of malts pull though. Has a semi-dry hoppy aftertaste. This is one of the best IPA's I have had in a long time. Gives me all the hops I need."
"I poured this beer vigorously to get a huge egg-shell white head, with a clear light amber body. The smell is dominated by the hops, mostly piney some fruit, with a hint of nutmeg. The hops also dominate the taste, which is a good thing. I don't get much else in the taste. The malt is hidden by the hops, not getting much from the malts It has a medium body and leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. I would like to have a little bit more malt to balance the great tasting hops."
"Drinkability is great! I will be getting a couple of more 6 packs for a birthday party this weekend, cause I know it will be a hit. Or, if not, I won't mind drinking them all myself."
"Better than the 2004 IMHO."
"Gorgeous copper with exceptional clarity, toped by a white head made of tiny bubbles that leaves good lacing. The bouquet exhibits some light apple notes as well as delicate spice (nutmeg and coriander) and citrus, and gives only the smallest indication of the wonderful hop-bath your tong is about the take. When it comes to taste, the malt characters detectable in the nose are set aside and a strong American hop profile dominates, though some of the malts do come through briefly in the middle. The understated malts do not indicate a lack of warpath, you still get all the fireplace fuzziness you want from a winter seasonal."
"No discernable difference from previous years. You will receive a beautiful copper brew with a sticky off white head. Great carbonation, lacing, and retention. Big grapefruity piney aroma bouyed by a hefty caramel/bready malt body. The flavor will be full of Cascades, but expertly matched agains a caramel malt and slightly alcoholish background. You will want several. Though on the heavier side, this one will be enjoyed by non-beerknerds during holiday parties."
"2005 release. The glowing copper body puts up an off-white head of bubbles of all sizes. Plenty of carbonation streams laze their way to the top, while the yeast sediment finds its way to the bottom. Big piney, grapefruit hop aromas along with some caramel and hints of bread crust. The signature SN Cascade hops wash over the tongue, followed by some warming malt sweetness with hints of alcohol, while balanced, this one and leans towards the hops. Highly drinkable."
"Full bodied, yet refreshing and very drinkable. Can't wait to get this by the mug at Crunchy's again this year."
"Dry, crisp, and quite drinkable."
"The hops are prevalent in the taste as well, with a very earthy abundance of flavorings. There are sweet fruity notes as well, with grapefruit being the most obvious. Carbonation is biting and prevalent. Easy to drink."
"mouthfeel is somewhat full. hops dry it out in the end. really nice. very tastey and very drinkable. I really like how the sierra brews tend to have generous hops tastes. this is one of my favorites. i wish i could get it year round. one of the best IPAs i've sampled yet, and consistently good year to year."
"Pours a beautiful deep copper color with a huge, frothy beige head that leaves sticky lacing all down the glass. The aroma is very hoppy, with notes of citrus (grapefuit and lemon), pine, spices, herbs, hearty bread and caramel. The taste begins with a big blas of hops: citrusy (grapefruit orange and lemon), pine resiny, and herbal followed by a spicy flavor, and a big toasted bread and caramel malt character that balances the hops. The mouthfeel is full and rich, but not overbearing and drinkability is quite good. An awesome holiday IPA, balanced and complex...one of the best."
"bright, orangish amber with swirly particulates (hop bits?) and a decent head with largeish bubbles. nose is faint, but i'm mostly getting a mild citrus fruit hoppiness. the taste is bitter hops up front with peachy, citrusy juiciness. juicy is also the predominant mouthfeel, medium body. a nice bitter finish. this is really delicious and easy to drink. easily one to buy by the case every year."
"2005 version, 12 oz bottle, seems like it's out a little early this year. Pours a nice looking orange/amber, absolutely clear, 2 fingers of desnse cream colored head, good retention and moderate lacing. Smell is fragrant hops, mainly pine but a little bit flowery, with a slight bit of spices. Taste is a flavorful burst of hops, grapefruit and citrus primarily, trailing into a bold spicey bitter finish. There's a malt taste lingering somewhere in the background, but it never really comes forward, but they do just enough to keep the hops from overwhelming. Medium body, dry finish, and a very smooth feel. And at 6.8% this is no slouch in the alcohol, but I could down these all night. Definitely a great drinkable IPA, wish they would produce it all year, as it is I'll just have to stock up in season."
"Do not wait for the holidays. If this beer is available go get it now."
"2007 edition, still a very good IPA with citrus, above average carbonation, and lacing grooming the glass. Very drinkable, but the 2000 was an award winner."
"This is a beer worth checking out, much better than I expected. It's not an in your face IPA, but still damn good."
"overall: just an excellent winter ipa every year. i look forward to this release from the second i run out. bitterness is just a touch less than alpha king, but the hop flavor is better. perfect mouthfeel and excellent drinkability. drink it while you can. it seems to disapear as quickly as the season."
"Drinkability: Wow, I think I'm going to have to snag a 6-pack to cellar for sure. I had this last year when I didn't know as much about beer, and still enjoyed it then. But now I'm liking it even more. I could see this doing well after just a year, though it's great now. I'd also like to pair it with some food and see what happens. All in all this is a great brew, and it certainly should be tried; it's a celebration after all, I suppose."
"Always one of my favorites but was knocked down a notch this year. Pours a deep clear amber with a half inch thick off-white head. Very aromatic. Hints of citrus and pine. Good head retention throughout. Nice hop flavor but not as expected. The aroma did not follow through as strongly in the taste. Definitely a strong hop presence with a complimenting malt flavor but there was an almost pungent finish. Very drinkable. I had three because I couldn't quite figure it out. Not SN's best year."
"This beer has a nice hoppy aroma with pine and orange. Definitely smells like a SN. The haed was average with a white, rocky head. There was virtually no lacing and the head disappeared. Th body was clear with a nice amber.orange color. There was moderate hop bitrterness initially that became stronger. The finish was long. It has a medium dry mouthfeel with a good bit of carbonation. There was a nice and surpirsing resin finish. I wish they brewed this one all year."
"Pours a pale, quite clear amber with a half inch, stick head. Reduces to a nice collar. Smells up front of citrusy hops with a definite caramel, bready malt backbone. Sweet caramel upfront gives way to huge fresh juicy hop oils. Not as citrusy as the nose led me to believe, but equally earthy and spicy. Pith emerges through a very toasty, smooth finish laden with spicy hops. Also there's a definite, intriguing hint of of rosemary... Very nice hop character coupled with a tremendous malt backbone. Almost no brash, harsh bitterness, instead it seems restrained and subtle. Mouthfeel is beautiful, medium with creamy carbonation. Perhaps it could be a tad fuller. Sessionable. Didn't lay hop waste to my palate and leave it in ruin as many IPA's tend to. Definitely one of the better IPA's."
"I've been going through this sixer I acquired pretty easily. Thumbs up on the drinkability end."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. Malt and hops are equal in their presence. A nice kick is also there--probably due to the relatively high alcohol content. Great session brew for any cold late fall or winter night. Time to Celebrate beer!!!"
"This is the 2005 version, just released. Pours a reddish-amber with a good off-white head that fades to leave the typical IPA skim. Smells sweetly malty with a substantial infusion of floral and spicy hops. My eye watered a bit when I got my face right in the glass and took a whiff. Flavor has a very malty backbone with hop highlights, a toasty finish, and lingering oily bittering from the hops. The toastiness reminds me of HopDevil. Celebration is a very solid and balanced IPA."
"Nice beer overall, though."
"Pours amberish-orange with a nice head. Nose was pretty hoppy- cascade was present (typical of Sierra Nevada). Initial taste was a hybrid between herbal and spicy. I didn't get a good taste of the malt bill because the hops took over the flavor quickly. The mouthfeel is spicy and a little bitter. It is not overpowering but definitely had a kick on the back of the palate. I would recommend this to someone who is a fan of west coast hopping and is a must if the person is a fan of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"A real reddish amber color with a tan two finger head.A very hop filled aroma with hints of spices and a bit malty.This is a great tasting beer.Like the smell,this is very hoppy,then you taste some holiday spices,then you finish with some maltyness.This has a nice medium feel,not too heavy or light.As far as drinkability goes,there aren't too many beers better than this,if you see it ,buy it."
"If you're looking for a great, hop-filled beer, here you go. I'd place Celebration ale right inbetween Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale & Harvest Ale in terms of intensity/bitterness. It's a good step up from the P.A., but not powerful enough to turn off the casual drinker."
"Still a classic. SNPA with a little more oomph."
"For drinkability I have to say only this, I will definitely buy more of this celebration ale, perhaps some of this year's batch, or maybe next year's doesn't really matter when, but I will definitely be buying more of this in the future."
"Notes: At this household celebration is a masterpiece and requires owner permission for gobblage. I usually stock up a few cases and drink it over a year. It changes over the year and I find that after a year its starting to fall out of favor. Drink it fresh and stagger it for a vertical for fun."
"Pours a vibrant golden yellow with a finger of off-white head which fades to a spotty coating. Smell is harshly bitter, piney hops, and citrus, and grassy grainy malts. Taste starts off heavily bitter with floral/piney hops but smooths out and sweetens up as it warms with citrus and tropical fruits. Mouthfeel is rich for an IPA and nicely carbonated. This is a tasty IPA once it warms, a little harsh if cold - which goes with its winter seasonal theme. Didn't blow me away, but this is a tasty, vibrant pale ale worth trying as the weather gets colder."
"Pours a wonderful dark gold with a big off white head that gets clumpy and leaves wonderful lacing. The smell just blows you away, citrus hops and caramel malts. This is one of the few beers that i've had that the first taste just makes you say WOW. Wonderful level of hoppiness but so smooth on the finish. Caramel malts balance the hops perfectly. Just a great beer. Ultimate smoothness on the palate and a perfect carbonation level. I stongly recomend this beer to anyone. I will be drinking as much of this as I can over the next couple of months. I don't see how it can get much better than this but I guess i'll keep looking."
"I definately prefer this beer at cellar temperature. Sierra Nevada Celebration is still one of my favorite seasonals...I will be drinking plenty of this in the coming months"
"You can see the lacing forming as you take the first drink, your mouth full of piney and citrusy goodness. The carbonation is perfect and the mouthfeel full and creamy. I can't see how an IPA could be crafted any better. Thank god my palate has matured because this is truly divine."
"Drinkability -- Very nice. This is a great holiday ale. You could just as easily enjoy it on a hot summer afternoon. I'm sure I'll be drinking quite a few of these in the next couple of months. Cheers!"
"This beer in my opinion is a ""spiced"" winter ale that retains the hoppiness of an IPA or pale ale. It's very lacey if you pour it into a glass, and the spices make it very rich-tasting, yummy. It's filling however, so you won't be able to drink too many after eating a holiday dinner. I tried a similar style locally, last year, at Sly Fox, but I can't remember what it was called."
"This was the 2004 edition. The beer is a slightly hazy amber color with a decent light-tan head. The aroma is nice, although a bit underpowered, with a nice blend of malt, a touch of a grainy complexity that's a little like caramel but not quite, and a spicey hoppy / ester character that is kind of a blend of cinnamon, cherry, and oak aroma (I have no idea where that comes from but it reminds me of that - I'm not suggesting the beer is aged in oak, though!!) The flavor is nice, with maltiness bordering on sweet without being the least big cloying - I don't know how they pull it off but SN always does. There is a bit of hop note as well. PRobably my biggest hit on the beer is that its been topped by other offerings in terms of ""bigness", but this remains one of the more drinkable beers in its class and is consistent year-after-year without being boring and predictable."
"I may be drinking 04s in 2006, 05s in 2007 and so on."
"Overall Sierra Nevada has produced a fine brew that many do and should envy. I look forward to the 2005 release."
"D - Delicious and well crafted. This one is a staple for any hop lover who wants a spicy kick without being hobbled by the bitterness."
"Definitely a beer I drink frequently... no obvious mistakes or wants out of this beer. While I don't find it spectacular, I must say that this is a very very solid brew.... yet another great brew from SN."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
" The mouthfeel is smooth, alcohol warmth with a finish that dries, like grain/husk. Drinkability, oh ya, easy to let its alcohol sneak up."
"Worthy of my 250th review."
"Luckily I have cellared more to compare later. This is a great drinking beer in its current state so I will have to get busy with the ones I have left!"
"[edit 03-15-2006: I want to be clear that I'm reviewing the 2004 SNCA. The 2005, while good, is at best a 4. Less caramel malt presence, more toasted 'burnt' flavor. The hops are more raw and unrefined, age has so far not improved the brew. Here's hoping 2006 is a better year!]"
"Overall drinkability is decent -- I could pound two or three of these if I had them available, but for the $2.25 that I paid for this single, I can do a lot better. The Bridgeport IPA is still my favorite of the style, although I'll keep an eye out for the 2005 so I can try that when it comes out."
"Tough for a session beer because it's such a heavy and powerful taste. But, luckily, a session with SN Celebration isn't a long one, with its relatively large ABV"
"A remarkable beer in that it's complex with the malty/hoppy interplay- interesting that such balance and variance in taste can be found in such simple recipe profile. Yet, the beer can be tasted with such ease that it's dangerous at 6.8%. An absolute delight of a beer and a welcome to my drinking rotation each winter."
"This beer poured to a very dark amber. I found this beer to have a very pleasant holiday aroma. This is one hell of a hoppy, fruity beer. Those two main tastes, along with some others, really combine into something very complex. I really couldn't finish too many of these as it is a very heavy, filling beer. Still, a nice treat for the holidays, enjoyed in moderation."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1 1/4"" light tan head. Beer was clear, dark amber, and laced nicely. Aroma is fruity hops. Taste is also fruity hoppiness, with a reasonable malt backbone, and closes with crisp hop leaves on the tongue. Mouthfeel and drinkability are very good as well. One of the standards for the American IPA style, I believe."
"Smooth and easy to drink with just a bit of alcohol warmth. Very nice anytime."
"Now, which one do I prefer nowadays? Well, even though I have now reviewed this fresh I can't say I will change any of my rating as they were pretty spot-on. Overall I am lucky that we live in the beer age that we do, and I can get fresh Torpedo anytime at my local grocery store, and still look forward to Celebration in the Winter ;-)"
"Carbonation is moderate and mouthfeel is full, but not heavy. Good, moderate hop bitterness that lasts into finish. Very mild astringency becomes apparent in aftertaste."
"Pours a deep amber/gold, with mild carbonation and lots of suspendies. Not overly nosey, mild hoppiness, but oooh boy is it good. Crisp, sharp hops with a really smooth, almost creamy malt body holding it together. Good hop bight, wich accentuates the crispness. An all day drinker, one of the best I have had in a long time. The hops do not have as much of a presence as other IPAs, but the beer is not wanting because of it."
"poured a medium copper color with white puffy head that left a slight lacing. the smeel is of hops with a fruity, citrus aftertone.taste is enjoyable with a mixture of hop bitterness and dryness. Good drinkability, I wish I had bought more than one in my mixed six pack"
"Overall this was a damn good seasonal IPA that I'll look for next Christmas-time. It was refreshing, crisp and beautifully balanced."
"This one came as a pleasant surprise! The color is a darker copper tone with an off-white head. The smell of the cascade hops is a nice punch in the mouth and you can definitely smell and taste the other dry-hopped additions, in this case chinook and centennial hops. Flavor wise, this beer packs a punch as well... clean, smooth, warm, balanced. Mmm. This is the kind of seasonal beer you can look forward to."
"Notes: I had quite an experience with this beer, almost as if my palate had matured through the experience of a six-pack of Celebration Ale. For that, this beer will always have a special place in my heart."
"This is a short session beer for an evening but this vintage will soon be past its prime. I'd drink a few in an evening or use it as a starter to move to stronger ales or barley wines."
"Pours a dusty orange amber with a nice head, light lacing down the sides. The smell is a clean cascade, a bit citrusy with pine notes and a notable grapefruit aroma. This is a hoppy beer, but really well balanced and smooth. The hops are flavorful and not just bitter with notes of grapefruit, floral and piney flavors and a clean bitterness in the back. For an IPA this is pretty drinkable, it is balanced and smooth and very warming. This is a great beer to go to bed on on a chilly night."
"Drinkability/comments: Much better balanced with age. Drinkability has improved, but the alcohol content will sneak up on the unwary drinker."
"The bottle claims that this ale is unique, and....well, I suppose it is. (Not that this is a good thing.) The nose was a whacked-out combination of cedar, bitter orange, and menthol. I should have quit right there. I can't figure out why everyone loves this stuff: the taste of burning wood and mint leaves with a powerful jolt of alcohol was too much for me. There was a perfect level of carbonation, though! For me, this beer is not worth the hype. It's good for keeping around to drink once in a decade when you're just bored with the usual beers. Gross!"
"This was an excellent beer on tap. Wonder what next winter will bring..."
"Taste: Fresh hops with a bitter sweet oil flavor; malt flavor and a nice whole grain breadiness; and slight hints of caramel. Decent hop bitterness comes through; and then a nice fruitiness. Great holiday brew!"
"Celebration is a good name for this fine brew as its quite drinkable and makes for an excellent party beer. Not your typical holiday brew as most breweries are making spiced winter warmers while the good folks at SN are kicking this one out, but I like it. I look forward to this one's release every year. They should brew this as their year 'round IPA and introduce a spiced spruce ale as their holiday seasonal....just an idea."
"Nice and tasty ipa, but no way what i think a christmas brew should be like. Remove the christmas stamp on this since its just good beer."
"Don't recommend this as a session brew, but it is great to have 2-3 with a belly filling dinner of meats and potatoes."
"I know some have said this vintage isn't as good, but i sure as hell like it. I don't remember 2003, but nothing is wrong with 2004 imo. This is a hop onslaught, brilliant because of the amazing depth of hop flavor pulled from the beer. this thing must have been dry hopped like mad. a great, powerful IPA."
"Overall a very drinkable ale worthy of its name. I just wish I would have tried this during the colder winter months. This brew packs a sneaky punch which will warm you from head to toe. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, very drinkable."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer is a hazy amber color with a creamy white head. A good amount of lacing is left on the side of the glass. Very hoppy aroma. Nice hop flavor and bitterness. More maltiness than most beers this hoppy. The finish is very bitter. Terrific drinkability  having one always leaves me craving another. This is my favorite beer from Sierra Nevada, and one that I like to pick up a sixer of a couple times a year."
"2004 version. This one pours an amber color with a medium head that falls fast, but leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is quite hoppy with some spices thrown in for good measure. The flavor has a caramel malt backing, but it is dominated by the American hops. Citrus, grapefruit, slight grassiness. Good body and easy to drink."
"Pours a slightly oranged amber color with a 2 finger head that falls to sit healthy atop the beer. The nose is nice, with spicey and citrus hops sitting over a nice healthy caramel malt base. Smells good. The flavor is very hoppy, with a good citrus blast and a nice sweet caramel malt. I relaly like it. The feel is moderate. This beer makes me smile every time I drink it. Its a very nice winter beer, but I think I could enjoy it all year long."
"Yummy. Someone pawned this six pack off on me because it didn't taste like the label I suppose. I was more than happy to receive it and enjoy it thoroughly. It has a nice amber, chestnut color with a head that fizzled out pretty quickly. Other than that I was very happy with the snap of the hops and the twang of the malt. I thought it was a nice balance. They may have overdone it with the bitter hops if they were hoping to make it highly drinkable. But one or two will do for me."
"tastes tangy, like a berry sherbet.. with hops quickly taking over with bitterness all over the mouth. yet drinkable and light. the best product in the SN family. wonder how this one would be after a year of sitting in a cellar. unfortunately, that was my last one and the bodega local is out."
"Beautiful reddish-copper hue, thick head, and nice carbonation, like a frothy cloud atop the pint glass. Floral hops accentuated more in the smell than the taste. Very hoppy, can understand why this is considered an IPA instead of a Winter Warmer since it also lacks the spice and cinnamon. Too bitter to be a session brew."
"Strange brew, I bought this thinking it was a warmer, and ended up disappointed when I realised it was only a seasonal IPA. I'm not normally a fan of over-hopped beers, and this offering by SN is no exception. For the hop heads only."
"Pours a dark amber colour, nice head, good retention. Floral aroma, fruity, great hop aroma. In terms of taste, I was expecting something more unique. But it's a typical west coast, hoppy ale, which is fine by me. Taste was fruity, hopped up. Great balance between malt and hops. Juicy and flavourful. Drinkability is exceptional."
"Overall, its great for long sessions, but doesn't offer much for a single beer experience."
"Still tasted pretty darn good, with lots of hops in front and sweet fruity middle with a dry bitter finish."
"Pours a deep orange/copper with a orange-white head that clings to my glass. Smell is very hoppy, but the malt backing is in there, too, along with some orange. Hoppy taste with some fruit and caramel thrown in for good measure; these citric notes are heavenly. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a great hop aftertaste with lingering orange notes. It's downright tasty, but I usually only have one or two in a sitting; lot of complexity in there to think over."
"Celebration Ale is copper in color with a foamy, creamy head. The head sticks around till the end of the glass and stays fairly foamy for most of the glass. Aroma is entirely of strong citrusy hop smell. The taste is big and hoppy. Strong bitterness in the finish, which lasts a good while after the sip is complete. This is maybe just a little too bitter for it's own good, a little more tasty hop flavor profile might kick the taste up to a 4.5 in my rating scheme. Then again, this is only my 3rd IPA, so what do I really know. Anyhow, I still very much enjoyed Celebration Ale and will be picking it up again next winter."
"Pours a opaque bronze with a big haze and a great, big old head of cotton-candy froth. Smells like the hop forest. Other fruity things going on, and a beautiful, up-front hoppy taste. Bits of malted milkball meets caramel apple flavor notes, and then a bitter, hoppy finish. Not that easy to drink, but very good."
"Methinks I'm becoming a hophead. The 2004 edition pours into a pint glass an orange/amber with a three finger creamy white head that is dense, frothy, and looks stiff enough to sit things on it... it persisted nicely, and left lace on the sides until the beer was, sniff, gone... I'm not sure why others have noted no head at all. The nose jumps at you with fruity citrus hops, a little orange sweetness there, too. Taste is sweet malt backbone that is overwhelmed and bubbling over with citrusy hops. The mouthfeel is creamy initially, a little thinner as I reach the end. The light carbonation seems to bubble on the tongue, and the hops persist to leave the tongue tingling with a touch of bitter long after the beer is down the hatch."
"Pours a pleasant burnt orange with minimal head, decent carbonation. Very good lacing throughout. Smells of toasted hops and a little dark malts. A medium-strong hops is most noticeable in the taste along with a heavier body than regular IPAs. Although I'm not a fan of the heavier hopped brews, this definitely had more to offer."
"On tap, this beer is an appealing amber color, with plenty of lacing. The hops are quite evident up front(both in smell and taste), but do not overwhelm the balance of this beer. There is a counterbalancing fruity, almost citrusy taste. What amazes, considering all the complex flavors, is how smooth this beer is(proof that smoothness does not equal blandness). A true classic, by one of the great pioneering craft breweries."
"Drinkability  One of the more quaffable beers that Ive had. On-tap this thing is addictive."
"Pours out a beautiful amber with a nice 2 finger head medium carbonation.Smell is nice and hoppy.Decent hop filled taste, with a little alcohol warmth towards the end.Mouthfeel was ok just a little thin for me.A good beer ,theres other brands id probably prefer first,but id never turn one of these down."
"On a pairing note, drinking Celebration while grazing on a variety of Christmas day appetizers, I found it pairs really nicely with strong cheeses. Not only does the cheese cut some of the bitterness of the hops, but the ale seems to bring out more flavor from the cheese."
"The taste is a small bit of malt swallowed by a humongous overload of citrusy hops. There is alcohol present, but it's not overwhelming and is well balanced with the brew. God this smells good and tastes great. Excellent beer for around the tree - or menorah, or buddha... hell, even atheists can enjoy Christmas with this one."
"Waiting for the backlash on this, but I just don't like the taste of wood polisher... errrr... pine in my beer. Wreaths stay on the door, they do not belong in my beer. While I do very much enjoy the hops in the beer, the pine just kills any joy I get from this beer. There are also hints of caramel and spices, but the pine just shoots them down in my opinion. I will admit this is not as pungent a pine as I've had compared to other beers, but I can still taste it."
"The mouthfeel was neither offensive nor spectacular but again is indicative of the style. I'm glad to get this one over."
"Wow. What happened? Maybe I got a mishandled six pack. Don't get me wrong this is not horrible ,but it's certainly nowhere near the past versions.It poured a dark amber ,but with very little head and the lacing was non exsistant.It seemed very subdued in all aspects ,not really spicy ,not hoppy, not much more than an average IPA.I look forward to this every year and sadly ,this year I was dissappointed.But as I said , maybe ,I hope, I just got a sixer that was somehow mishandeled . I'll see if I can still find this somewhere else and rerate it."
"The 2004 version is as good as always. Strong pine resiny aroma and sharp bitter taste. Centennial hops at their best. I finally found this beer at Whole Foods in the Chelsea section of Manhatten after searching around my local distributors for weeks. This beer is consistent year after year. Too bad it's not available year round. A rock solid IPA that is very drinkable despite it's 6.8 ABV. With all the over the top seasonal beers out there I've tried, I always find myself going back to this classic IPA. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". This beer will go down in the annals of American brewing as the classic IPA that all others are compared too. Please Sierra Nevada, make this available year round!"
"A fantastic offering from Sierra Nevada. Pours a bronze colour with a thick foamy head. A sweet malty aroma wakes you up with hints of pine. The taste is full of wonderful flavours. Pine, grapefruit, and even grassy notes rock the tastebuds like a mo fo. Great stuff. A great beer for just about anything."
"Give this one a shot for sure!"
"This one was on tap at Falling Rock - so my review isn't as detailed as usual. All in all a fantastic beer that I look forward to having again in the future. Poured a beautiful bright amber color with a nice head that left a lot of lacing as it drained. Fresh hops and citrus flavor dominate - with just enough malty undertones to keep it reasonable (but this one is definitely for hop-heads). Great creamy mouthfeel"
"Overall, a nicely incorporated, balanced flavor. However, I find myself missing the full strength of the hops in fresh Celebration. This is my first experience with cellared Celebration, and though it's certainly good, I simply prefer it fresh. I think I'm gonna go pull those six-packs of '04 back out of the cellar, and drink 'em this season instead..."
"What can I say that has not allready been said, except that I can't get it here in NC and that makes me want to cry. Winter just won't be the same without this staple of Holiday enjoyment. Perfectly balanced, hoppy, spicy, and good enough to drink all night. Whenever the subject of good winter brews comes up, this immediately comes to mind. Good good!"
"2004 Celebration: bronze colored liquid with an off-white, firm, rocky head. Sticky lace. The beer is cloudy from yeast sediment. The aroma is thick of piney hops. Its an intense aroma: a wake-me-up peppery, outdoorsy, full-on Northwest smell. Hint of malt underneath the hops. Tongue numbingly bitter, with a dry, crisp, very refreshing finish. Id love this beer year-round."
"(2004) Beer pours a crisp golden/amber with a nice 1-2 inch foamy head, good retention, nice lacing too. There's a pleasent ""ale"" aroma. Fruity esters from the hops are present, I can smell some nutmeg and ginger too (or else I've just been eating too many cookies lately) I think I can smell some malt too, but not much. Very hoppy as I would expect from SN, phenomenal!! Wow! Spicey, piney not too sweet. This beer tastes like Christmas. I want one of these while opening my presents this year (which will hopefully be more of these). Exceptional drinkablity for the hoppiness, could go with these all night."
"Good stuff. Pours to a creamy white head and orangey color. Aroma is hop-dominated with a good deal of pale maltiness shining through. Flavor is bittersweet, quite well-balanced for an American IPA, strong bitterness with a sweet malt backbone holding it up. Very pleasant IPA aftertaste and mouthfeel. Wow. I bought this not knowing it was an IPA (I had bought Pyramid IPA to serve at the Xmas party along with this beer, Czechvar and my homebrewed stout). It is excellent. It has the right balance of slightly toasty-caramel maltiness and the generous bitterness, flavor and aroma of the finest U.S. ale hops. Worth the extra money. A sixpack of Celebration Ale costs over $9 in OK and I consider it more worth the expense than the $7.50 for any Pyramid beer, incuding the IPA!"
"Pours a beautiful medium amber with a huge head and great lace. Smell of fruity citrusy hops. Great floral hoppiness. Taste of fruity hoppiness with a nice amount of bitternes. Not too bitter though. A great example of an American IPA. No detection of the 7% alcohol anywhere. Its mouthfeel is very nice. Not too light or too heavy. Its drinkability is only slightly above average because I just can't drink a bunch of IPA's in a row. I enjoy them very much, just not a bunch at once. I will savor the other 5 of these through the holiday season."
"Bought a single of this at the local beer store for $1.59. An excellent beer for anytime, not just the holidays. Probably the best IPA I've had in my relatively limited experience (though I have a Dogfish 90 Minute waiting for me in the fridge). Nothing special about the appearance, typical light brown color with nice, lasting head and ok lacing. Smell is very fruity - I can't place a finger on which particular fruit though. Something citrusy, like lemon or grapefruit even. Man, this is a hoppy beer. Might be too bitter for some, but I love me some hops. Drinkability is way up there...despite the 7% ABV I feel like I could easily make this a ""session"" beer. Overall quite impressed and pleasantly surprised, as I'm actually not a huge fan of the other Sierra Nevada products I've tried."
"Nearly 7% alcohol?! Bullshit. Where's it hiding? I drank this one at room temp. Pours a wonderful clear amber color with a crazy amount of head. I'm immediately smaked upon the nose with the wonderful cascade hop. Smells delicious. This beer starts of with a citrusy aroma, but it ends with a grassy, hoppy bitter chinook bite. After a couple of sips I can pick up some of the grassyness in the aroma. There's just so much going on with this beer. Such complex hoppyness, and dry as a bone. Nothing sweet here. This is one of the most delicious beers I've ever tasted. I have five more of these to drink! I doubt I'll refridgerate any of them."
" Note-Sampled a 2000 vintage bottle earlier this week. While the hops had dimished it was definately showing its age. Not unpleasant but was past its prime for sure. Had a slightly ""off"" flavor. I wouldnt call it rancid but it was off to be sure. If youre cellaring this one Id suggest diving in. Malt flavor and body were there-just had an untangible element to it."
"Pours a nice amber and has a big off white head that leaves gobs of sticky lace. The hops attack the nose as soon as the glass gets anywhere near my nose. Very nice! They are very up-front in the flavor as well and they are a nice floral assault on the tongue. This is a very good American IPA. It is quite drinkable. I would like to try it on tap sometime."
"For a brewery that prides itself on uniformity, this year's celebration is surely not worth celebrating over. Lets hope the Bigfoot is much better."
"This is one of the best brews I have ever had the plesure of quaffing. First impression was a little dry for my taste, but by the end of the glass I was hooked. I've come to know this as a great sessionbeer,but the 6.8% ABV will ensnare the unknowing or the unwary. A truly great beer."
"Drinkability: I don't think that I could ever tire of this beer. Truly fantastic, and it leaves me wanting another."
"It pours with a rich, reddish hue and one inch head that doesn't quickly dissapate. In other words, it is a beautiful beer. The smell is dominated by hops and illicits a piney reaction. Here comes the hops. This is a highly hop dominated beer, but at the same time it is balanced. It has a malt finish that raises its mouthfeel. I could drink it all night."
"What can I say? This beer lives up to the hype. Too bad the only store near me fucking gouges on the price ($11.00 for a sixer!!!) or I'd probably buy a case to enjoy until next year."
"Drinkability: I know some people that are cellaring this one until 2005, and beyond. Having enjoyed a couple bottles of the 04, I doubt that I could avoid the temptation of making nightly visits to the cellar."
"Honey clear out the garage Celebration is out again, this is the stock up the house beer. I wish they sold this year round so I don't have to find spots around the house to shelf it. Pours a nice amber with golden streaks, the head is white with tan streaks. The smell is of sweet caramel and nutmeg malts with sweet sour hoppy citrus. The combo of smells is outrageous. The taste is indescribable, you can only taste it yourself, right in the middle of barleywine and IPA. A smooth robust will warm you up during the holidays but also refresh in the summer months. Solid."
"Initial head of ½ inch fluff that is creamy in appearance with some larger stuff going on at the outer edges. Celebratory hop front on nose with just a jack of candy cane sweetness flitting about aimlessly in the eaves. Gaudschalk frizziness of hop that almost stings on the tongue and back of throat and simply engulfs any washing holiday spices that I think must be hidden in there, somewhere. Really seems like this could do with some more mellowing; an oddly low-tide mud flat finishing to the pour brings the party down to a murmur for me."
"The ale poured a beautiful bronze with a georgeous rocky white head. The aroma was essentially of hops very floral. The taste was really pretty one dimensional it was sharp and hoppy and nothing else. The body was medium dry finish. This beer was a real disappointment. I was expecting something complex and maybe spicy instead I got nothing but hops. It was also very unpleasant to drink with chilli."
"Drinkability: Easily one of the best Christmas releases I've had. I will gladly enjoy this again."
"Drinkability is good. A nice brew especially on a cool Florida winters' night. All things considered, I'll be riding the Sierra Nevada horses a little more often now. I guess Bigfoot was just an ornery old mule."
"Gorgeous amber with a massive, fluffy head that looks like egg-whites beaten to stiff peaks. Smell is practically all hops... first some grapefruit/citrus aromas and then lots and lots of spruce. Just a hint of honey in there. Tastes exactly how it smells. Spruce flavors dominate, a bit of citrus, and an extremely mouth-drying, extremely bitter finish. Mouth is smooth and slightly creamy with light carbonation. One for the hop heads."
"Drinkability is what this beer is about. The hoppiness doesn't overpower at all. Like I said above...my all-time fav for a great session brew."
"The color is dark copper with a frothy head that generously laces your glass in a series of parallel lines all the way down. Islands of ""dirty"" hops float on top of the liquid, sparking daydreams as you savor the excellence of the beer known as Celebration."
"Overall, this is a very nice IPA. Perhaps a bit ""raw"" right now, but still very tasty. I wish it were available year round."
"All in all, a very drinkable brew. I think I'll buy another six pack soon."
"01/12/03: It's beauty is in its drinkability. I find it difficult to believe that Sierra Nevada keeps this brew seasonal. Heady copper. Citrus leaf and roasted nut nose. Exceptionally balanced through a draught and every sip puts the pressure on to sip anew."
"2004 bottle.at 5.99 a sixer not a bad buy poured a copper red. with a light tan head. aroma hops, malts, pine, citrus, some yeast. flavor, citrus, hops, pine, nice clean taste and finish. will get more of this was told that this ages well. bieristgut said he has a 2003 that we can compare."
"Comments - This really is an ale worth celebrating. The aroma combined with the taste of this beer makes it really outstanding."
"The hop flavor seems very raw. It's not overwhelming or totally out of balance, but I think being just a bit more mellow would help the taste. Aging this thing just might do the trick."
"Drinkability is average. If you want more than 2 of these, you need to have your head examined."
"Bender factor: I am partial to Souther Tier Harvest, it is a better brew than this. When SN wants to own up that Celebration is not a winter brew, I will try it again. Otherwise, it will not find a place in my fridge."
"Tasting notes: I have no other years for comparison and from what I've read, this isn't the best year. As far as I'm concerned, this is a solid IPA and dead-on for the style. I would definitely recommend it and if you have other years to compare it to, consider yourself lucky."
"Recommended."
"Gorgeous amber color with slightly reddish hues. Two finger head which dissippates within a couple minutes. Fair lacing. Floral nose and very sweet and hoppy. Smooth and rich mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Quite bitter (though in a most pleasant way, it's not an affront to my palate at all) and citrusy with slight hints of apple. All in all, this is a very solid IPA."
"This beer has a beautiful reddish amber tint with a nice tan head. The smell is incredible, there is sweetness and flowery hops. The taste starts out mild, then the hops appear. The hoppy taste is great, very well balanced. There is a nice mild hop bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good, I would prefer a bit more body but I can't complain, this is a great beer. The drinkability is excellent. It is so good that I wonder if I can get this in kegs?"
"Deep copper to amber hue, light offwhite head and light lacing on glass. Smell is rich of nutty roasted barley and sweet citrus fruits. Flavor is a solid sweet malt backbone with strong citric hop overtones. Medium body, not too sticky on the palate, crisply carbonated. Very easy to drink, SNCA is always welcome at my house during the holidays."
"This is a hefty IPA given the 6.8% abv and the high hop character. An IPA fit for the winter season, but it's tough to drink this as a session beer. A 'good' IPA IMO that I feel gets a bit more credit than it deserves."
"The taste was good like most Sierra Nevada poducts. Flavor is dominated by the citrus hop like flavors with a nice amount of bitterness that last well into the aftertaste. A nice amount of carbonation as well makes your mouth tingle with joy."
"Basically, an inexpensive but pleasurable experience... I love the winter warmer style and I'm so excited that the season has begun again!"
"2004 version: This beer pours an dark amber with an oily foamy off white head. Aroma is floral citrusy hops can't really smell anything else but it smells real good. Taste is a repeat of the citrusy hops, hint of toffeelike malt underneath. Long aftertaste of hops like you were sucking on a hop cone, I don't think it ever goes away but eventually you just stop noticing it. Great drinkability especially for the alcohol content. Just the thing to get in the celebrating mood. A great American style winter warmer IPA."
"On-Tap @ The Washington House in Sellersville, PA! Fresh keg tapped 3 days ago! This brew is a light red/dark amber colour with a light tan head of foam that lasts and leaves nice lacing as well. The aromas are of fresh piney/citrusy hops and nice bready malts. The taste is hoppy up front, very malty in the middle, and dry and hoppy in the finish. This one really gives you some piney, hop burps! The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is pretty awesome as well. A classic."
"This has to beer my favorite beer of all time."
"Overall: I could buy this beer and just keep it around for sniffing. The flavor is a bit unbalanced and rough."
"I hear so much about this beer (as well as SN's Bigfoot), and I've finally gotten to taste it. It does not disappoint. I regret only picking up a sixer now."
"Found this beer on tap at the Pittsburgh Bottleshop Cafe. Wow. What a brew ! Beautiful amber/copper color with a rich creamy off white head. Smell is mostly hops and citrus. Very nice. The taste was unbelievable. Very hoppy with a nice fruity flavor. The fruitiness reminds me of a late harvest white wine without being sweet. Did I mention very hoppy ? The mouth feel was just about perfect. The carbonation is just right. Drinkability is dangerously high. If I can find a case of this stuff I will certainly buy it."
"Deep copper color, very clear with a light cream colored head. Thick and rich with a delicate lace that settled on the rim of the glass immediately after the pour. The nose has a hint of floral hops, backed by a delicate malt aroma with just a hint of spice. The taste has a nice balance of hop and malt backed by some spice character. It has a medium mouth feel . Very drinkable. I now see what all of the fuss is about."
"Finally got to get mine. Pours a ruby amber color with a nice off white head stays a while and laces nicely. Aroma is malt lots of hops, floral and ctirus combined some fruity aromas coming from citrus hops? or somewhere else like a big gumby bear of hops just smells juicey. Tastes of malt to start then hops lots of hops dominating this beer grapefruity bitter. Starts out lightly sweet with floral hop flavors blending with the sweetness then the bitter grapefruit comes up with carbonation leading the way and announces itself all else falls away to bitterness for a while then it fades some and sweetness is tasted again as it finishes. This beer leaves a nice hop resin coating on your tounge to remind you its time for another drink. Mouthfeel is a good solid meium drinkability is also good nice hop strong regular IPA very good but not quite a masterpiece. After finally getting to taste some I can see why people talk of cellaring it. I bet after a year in my cool basement it will have much more to offer then just hops."
"One of the beers I have been looking forward to trying since I first started getting into craft beer almost a year ago. The label is somehow psychologically soothing, and I like it. It pours out of the bottle like beaten copper with a ruby tinge. A big bubbly head rolls up and clings in loving lace patterns in big chunks of froth. The vision of the beer itself is almost hypnotically soothing, watching the head slowly recede and leave those patterns of lace on the glass. Once I take a whiff I get somewhat of a wake up call though. Sweet sticky malts over-come by resinous pine aromas, lemon grass, and citrus rinds. The combination is almost candy-sweet, but brash and assertive at the same time. This beer tastes great as well. The malts are present and nicely sweet, but light on the tongue. The hops, obviously, dominate this beervibrating mid-pallate like I had a penny on my tongue. Resinous pine and bitter citrus rind present themselves toward the finish, very lovely. A great IPA with classic Sierra Nevada style. Let me say that I love this beer, but there are some behemoths in the IPA category that are really hard to touch, Sierra Nevada still does an awesome job with this beer."
"These days it is getting harder to distinguish yourself in the AIPA category. I think that SN Celebration is getting a bit dated. It is a good beer, but I can have exciting fresh, local AIPAs all year now and that, as much as it pains me to say, makes this beer less magical."
"Pours a lightly hazy deep amber to copper color, the head is frothy, mountainous, the lace in thick sheets that cling to the glass till the very end. Nose is hop floral, malt takes second fiddle, quite ""Sniffable"". Front is malt, lightly sweet, top is moderate, the finish is magnificently hopped, potently acidic, the dry long lasting mouth feel, adds much to this beer. Ranks #286 on my current 1000 beer master list"
"Maybe cellaring will make this one a star, but right now it's a fourth-round draft pick."
"One a side note, I review the 04, but shortly after tasted an 03 Id been saving since the past year. The year old celebration was just as good, but slightly more subdued and a little more balance, sort of like a fine wine. A different experience with aging, no better no worse, just different. I highly recommend both ways."
"2004: Bought a case of this today while in PA> This will of course be a yearly ritual from now on (along with Bigfoot, Old Ho, Hop Wallop, etc...). Pours a deep auburn color with a frothy tan head and thick lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell was grapefruit, pine and caramel. The taste is heavy on the pine cones with some sharp lemon/lime rinds with just a hint of sweet maltiness bringing up the rear. The carbonation was sparkling and the mouthfeel with bright and clean with a VERY dry finish. Man, this is hoppy (moreso than last year?). Overall, the drinkability factor is pretty high even with the dry finish and warming alchohol kick. I know that this ages really nicely so I look forward to a month or two of aging. Top notch Hops for the cold winter months."
"One hell of an IPA. Worthy of drinking morning noon and night. A toast to Christmas!...err...Halloween!"
"Yahoo, Another year where Sierra Nevada has done it right. I just had a bottle of this years Celebration Ale. Hopheads will love this one. Aroma was pure hoppiness. Not overpowering like some Double IPA's but much better than your average IPA. I also liked the fact that even though you could tell it had some cascade hops in it they used other hops to give it a better flavor than just cascade only. Color was a nice light amber color. Head was good and full. I'm looking forward to the draft version now also."
"Appearance is clear amber with fluffy pillows of foam. Generally a fine looking beer. The aroma is held captive by piney hops, but there are subtle elements of biscuit malt. A slight dose of alcoholic odors rests underneath everything else. The smell of alcohol gets stronger as the beer warms. Flavor has strong hop bitterness with a harsh finish and aftertaste. Strong piney flavors remind me of my least favorite hops, but maybe they just overhopped in general. I like the toasted malt that's in there, but it could use a lot more to achieve a sense of malt-hop balance. Some spices are in there, but the bitterness of the hops blasts them off the palate, and I can't tell what spices are actually there. The mouthfeel is decent. I like hops, but overall this beer was just out-of-balance. Maybe the harshness mellows with age."
"Great Drinkability. I'm going to be enjoying this one all through the hoilidays."
"I'm not a seasoned beer connoisseur, but I must say, this beer is excellent. It's a little hard to track down, but I knew Liquor Mart in Boulder, CO would have it... they have everything. This is the 2004 brew, and there are so many spices and nuances, your senses are provided with quality stimuli. Beer was purchased at 6.99 a six pack, and judging by the review on this site, i was happy to pay. I think Sierra nevada has a tendancy to have more carbonation than neccesary, but I thought this beer had a nice compromise. Poured a deep red/brown color. Looks like some yeast still remain, so not quite filtered as it's Pale Ale brother. It's more filling than Pale ale I can tell you that much. The taste was very complex and I felt the holiday ""spirits"" immediatly. I'm not experienced enough to know what specific ingredients and what processes produce a specific taste, but I can say that Celebration Ale tastes like an evening in a cabin during the dead of winter with the fire blazing and you snuggled up under a warm semi-stiff blanket. For being a 6.8% beer, you hardly taste the alcohol. Some beers rely on that alcohol taste to ""flavor"" the beer, but not this one. They've taken quality ingredients to almost exactly compliment any alcohol. Thanks Sierra Nevada for a quality brew!"
"2004 vintage on-draft. Pours a very attractive clear golden copper color with a good, persistent head and substantial lacing. Enticing hop flower aromas. Strong hop oil flavors which finish with extremely potent and almost metallic hop bitterness. This vintage was far too hoppy for my taste. While the hop flower smell and flavors are interesting, they are ultimately overwhelmed by the hop bitterness and overpowering after-tastes. I found it very difficult to finish my pint."
"The appearance is absolutely gorgeuos with a sticky head and ruby read body. The aroma is typical Sierra Nevada on both years, but the 2004 has a lot bigger ""Kick in the face"" hop trait. The 04 had a very strong grapefuit as the 03 had a milder citrus smell. Now for the taste. The 04 seems extremely fresh and chock-full-of-hoppiness delight. The 03 has a much drier and weaker hop presence. I must add that the 2003's head is much more sticky and the lacing is out of this world compared to the 2004. The mouthfeel is great on both years although the 03 is much more enjoyable. This is truly a fine specimin for an IPA and I look forward to it each year. I had to, of course, buy a case of the 04. I will be cellaring a six pack for future years. I agree with others that this beer is much better after taking a nap for a year or so in a dark basement! The 2004 was just a little too fresh; if that is even possible or a bad thing."
"Seems to bit a bit more malty this year. Still very good, but I've enjoyed all the past years a bit more. Still won't stop me from buying a case each year...and from drinking the rest of this years stash. Still an above average IPA."
"Unfortunately, I forgot to buy any last year, and I have no more cellared C.A. left. Fresh, it's just too bitter to be interesting. I bought 2 six packs, and after this review, I'll be putting all the rest up."
"Drinkable, oh yes. It's tasty. It's balanced, and as a winter beer it's totally repeatable."
"Well haven't written a review in a bit but this brew is surely worth it. 2004 Release. Pours a deep copper color with a fluffy offwhite head that just sticks around nicely. Aromas are super hoppy, giving off some citrus, a little pine, and just a hint of malt. Initial flavors start of very hoppy with a piney resinous like flavor. The mood of this beer quickly changes over with a nice creamy malt backing that portrays a bit of biscuit and just a hint of caramel. This brew progresses back to the hops thereafter, giving off a slight crisp bitterness followed by some juicy citrusy flavors that just linger on the tongue sip after sip after sip. The body of this beer is magnificent while the carbonation plays on the tongue in just the right way. This IPA is truly magnificent, and a true testament to what Sierra Nevada can do."
"Mouthfeel is lush and creamy with good carbonation. Smooth and satisfying. Drinkability is through the freakin roof. This is my fave brew of the holiday season and it pratically begs to be sessioned. I will be cellaring some to see what some age does as well. Don't miss out on Celebration this year...go...buy...now."
"2004: Ruddy orange, with a thick and foamy, frothy off-white head that rises up to an inch high, and sinks slowly down, but leaves a thin layer of uneven bubbles. Lace rides up the insides of the glass. Aroma is cinnamon and floral hops, with a hint of citrus. Smooth mouthfeel, perhaps a little soft, leading to a tangy hops bitter, an interesting mix of citrus and pine. Not bitter, not overwhelming, but very even and balanced. An orange peel bitter lingers."
"This stuff was great and I could drink it all the time, definately more drinkable than the Pale Ale but it definately catches up a lot faster."
"year: 2004. Redish, yellow-brown color. Small head. Smell of floral hops reminds me of a light IPA. light roasted malt flavor in the beggining. Hops is the doninant flavor, with a crisp carbonation bite on the finish. No alcohol flavor is detectibe, good for a 6.8%. Little hop after taste. A very good choice for an celebration."
"Winter 2004 brew. Appears a dark red amber color. Creamy head on top laces the glass, nice. Smells of biting hops, and citrusy fruits, lemons, limes, grapefruit. The taste of this beer is very challanging. I like a good challenge. The hops are so present the beer stings your tongue and bites you in the back of the mouth. Intense. You have to swallow the beer fast and evade the taste bud hop attack to even pick up on the maltyness. But that's ok, I don't think this beer was intended to be well balanced in that respect, it's just a hop extravaganza. Very bitter finish as well. The mouthfeel is crazy, an asrtringent biting sting for sure, but not in a bad way, if that makes sense... I know, it doesn't make sense, but who cares, this stuff is kick you in the ass good."
"I more than enjoyed walking into Chumley's in Lafayette to see this hop monster on tap. I strolled up to the bar and immediately ordered one. It poured a deep orange with a 2 finger white head. Aroma is intensely hoppy, a nice citrus hoppiness. Taste was more of the same, but there is also a substantial malt backbone to back up the hops. Taste lingers on the tongue for awhile. Mouthfeel is nice and thick. This is a very solid and respectable beer. Great for when you need a hop fix."
"Pours out an amber/copper color with a nice head that stays with you a for little bit. Smell consisted of hops, hops, and more hops. There was some good spiciness to the beer as well. Lots of citrus lay underneath the hops, grapefruit, orange, and some lemon. Taste was hoppy, but as hoppy as the smell which was alright to me. Some good bitterness lingers on the palate for a while. Finishes with some grapefruit/orange flavors and lasts into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium with the right amount of carbonation mixing in. Can't wait to get a 6 pack for this upcoming winter. A must have around Christmas time."
"i celebrate every year when this comes out.it is my favorite of the sierra beers and one of my favorites over all.its an amber style ale with a nice ""winter brew"" kick if ya know what i mean.its september now so we only have a few months to go!!!!"
"Surprisingly ( or not ) , there wasn't even a hint of oxidation in the taste of this brew. Another gem from the cellar."
"A very fine IPA, with a nice winter flavor. I'll be looking forward to seeing this in GA this year."
"A clear winter beer with a beautiful redish orange pour. A sweet hoppy smell with a nice bite during the finish. A nice medium head with flavor. Surprisingly tasty, full of nutty, chocolatey, tootsie roll like flavors. A body that is more than I expected, each sip finishes with a short blast finishing hops!"
"2003er. Pours an orangy copper color with a beige head. Deep piney, Cascade hop aroma. Some other hop is is there, Warrior or Chinook? Initially sweet on the palate, then moving towards the drier, hoppy side, finishing malty sweet and citrusy again. Pretty darn good for having a twist-off bottlecap."
"Nice deep amber color, huge cratering head that disappeared to almost nothing. Smells hoppy - big, juicy hops, with some citrus. Taste is... hoppy... a lot of grapefruit, maybe some pine, with very little malt sweetness. Tastes a little raw to me, with the standard oily mouthfeel on a long finish. (gotta love the hop burps, though...) If you like big hops, this might be a good example, but it's too over the top for me - if I were going to have this again, it would have to be much more balanced."
"Overall: 4.3"
"Some ""Buzzard"" brew I think. Thus I did not give this one the lowest scores for taste/smell/drinkability."
"Had this on tap at Hard Times in Herndon. Pours a dark amber color with a small frothy tan head that disappeared fairly quickly. The head does create a nice lacing around the glass as it is drunk. Great aroma, which is huge in hops with some herbs and spices hanging on for the ride. Hops and fruitiness dominate the taste with a hint of spiciness and an excellent bitter finish. A great brew for a hophead to get his fix from. The mouthfeel is about average for an IPA. I find this to be a very drinkable brew as I usually have about 6 of these will playing pool, of course you will feel the 6.8% after a few. An excellent seasonal and all around brew, one of the best IPAs I have had."
"This was the 2003 edition, poured a deep orange amber color with about 1 finger of frothy head that quickly dissipated, leaving some fine lacing in my glass. Smell was grapefruit, banana and mild citrus, with a hint of a malt backbone. Very soothing! Taste is sweet malts that are quickly taken over with a velvety bite of hops, yet never truly bitter like a Stone IPA. The overall taste is wonderfully crisp, that is refreshing and finishes dry and smooth. (Outside Temperature at tasting was 100+) Mouthfeel had just the right amount of carbonation with a slight oily texture that was very pleasing. Overall, a great Cali IPA, in either Winter or Summer. Another quality offering from Sierra Nevada!"
"2003 bottle. Pours a nice clear amber capped by a medium to thin head of slightly off-white bubbles. As the head diminishes and the beer is consumed a nice curtain of lacing lines the walls of the glass. A full aroma of hops--floral and citrusy with a bit of spiciness, greet the nose. Great fruity hop taste, with some good bitterness in the finish. Some sweetness and breadlike flavors come through as well, particularly as it warms, but really are hidden behind the hops. A great tasting and relatively easy drinking beer which I look forward to each year. A definite favorite. (I'm finally transfering my review from my own files, and just re-reading my notes is causing me to look forward several months for its next release)"
"--Joey"
"The 2003 bottle edition pours a lovely, bubbly, rich amber color, topped off with a modestly frothy off-white head. Mostly hops in the aroma, with some grapefruit and piney background and just a hint of the toasted malts. The taste is exquisitely complex--initial hops and some light citrus and floral on the back of the palate. The taste lingers for a good while and then fades to a balance of bitter, swettness, and subtle smokiness. A bit too heavy on the carbonation I think, but the mouthfeel is good; it has some substance to it."
"This beer is a good example of a good IPA, good job sierra nevada"
"The 2003 bottle version poured a nice copper color with a nice off-white head that leaves a nice lacing around my glass. The aroma is quite hop-filled and has a very citris-like scent to it. The taste, like the aroma, is big on the hops. I really couldn't detect much in the way of malts due to the overwhelming hops. The mouthfeel was excellent as the beer had just the right amount of carbonation and it went down almost too smooth! This is a beer that you can sit back and enjoy several of in a sitting. Definitely something to look forward to each year from Sierra Nevada!"
"What this beer is to me is a bigger and badder version of their pale ale with more hops, more alcohol and more body. I like how this beer gets better sip after sip with a warming effect taking place after half a bottle. There are heavier winter warmers and more exotic winter warmers but this is one the best drinking winter beers."
"Nice healthy hop aroma, amber brown color, very hop filled first taste with a nice blend of malt and some spice, sweetness seems to disappear rather quickly and your pretty much left with the hops and resulting bitterness. A true hopheads Christmas brew, non hop heads need not bother"
" Mouthfeel is good. Not heavy and cloying, but with enough oomph behind it to let you know you're drinking a beer. Drinkability is good. I could easily have a bunch of these. I like this beer. I do. I'm just not sure it deserves such high ratings. If anything, it's well known and widely distributed. Almost as much as SNPA. I'm glad to try it about once a season, see if anything has really changed. Good beer."
"A very nice clear, amber pour with quite a generous pancake head. The nose is nicely hopped and has plenty of fruitiness kickin around as well...peach and apricot i'd have to say. The taste is big and hoppy right off the bat with underlying fruitiness and a nice malt backbone. Underlying caramel sweetness. This beer offers bold, up front taste and well balanced body. A very, very light and smooth mouthfeel make this one an easy drinker...dangerous with the 6.8% abv. The finish is of a lovely hop bitterness as the light fruity notes disapate towards the end. Great stuff!"
"poured a copper like reddish brown with little head. Sweet smell with some spice and a bit chocolate. Alot of spice in the taste, but had a bit of bitterness to it as well. Had a little more carbonation than I was expecting but not too bad. No exactly something to write home about. Not totally awful, but not really impressed, either."
"I get that a hint of citrus in the taste. Then I'm slammed with that lovely hop bitterness I expect from a good IPA. Finishes off nice and bitter. Very full mouthfeel. This is my first celebration and i will certainly be getting more season."
"I have become wiser since my last review, so I thought I'd a few more comments. HUGE floral aroma and taste. This is one balls-to-the-wall IPA. I've bumped up my ratings a little bit after trying this again a year later. Definitely worth a try for yourself, but it still does knock me on my ass!"
"Pours a dark honey color with a nice-sized beige head. Leaves a great lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is not overpowering, but what is there is beautiful hop bitterness. The aroma is a great precursor to the blast of hops bitterness that assaults the back of your tongue. An IPA through and through. A faint fruity taste teases your tongue in the background, amazing considering the strength of the hops. The aftertaste is more of the same, leading into happy hoppy burps that let you relive the experience. The mouthfeel is heavy due ot the carbonation bombarding the sides of your mouth. This is immensely drinkable. The pint is gone almost before you realize it. I love this beer."
"This is the 2003 version. It has a cloudy orange amber color. Large bubbles in the head that leave a little bit of lace. An absolutely fantastic spicey and floral hop boquet. The flavor on the other hand did not give me the same hop jump. There was a hop bitterness followed by not a grapfruit citrus but more of a lemony citrus. Lemony like the finish to a lemon ice tea. I don't know if the cloudness in the beer was responsible for the muted finish to the flavor or not. I guess I will just have to wait to next year and try it as soon as it comes out."
"Pours a nice, clear medium amber brown with off white lacy head that held the sides like a champ and lasted a pretty good time. Aroma of maltiness, citrus, spice and floral hop. The taste of grapefruit citrus hop is very pronounced with a hint of maltiness in the background balancing this out. It has a relatively light mouthfeel with a nice hop bite at the end that makes you want more and more. Very drinkable."
"Poured a fluffy oatmeal brown colored head left a coat of lace as it faded to a film. Light mahoganny colored beer with a steady stream of bubbles rising from the center of the chalice. Potent piney hop aroma. Wow, only two years ago this beer was the most bitter IPA I could handle. Piney grapefruit hop flavor sits atop a solid malt base. The finish is mildly bitter, solid for an IPA. A staple IPA, nice raw hop character."
"Very drinkable, I also know where there are 4 more six packs of this stuff are. Bye! need to go to the store!"
"2003 - I always look forward to the release of this beer, it has the bitterness that I crave and it signals a great time of the year. It is light copper in color with a citus aroma. It is very bitter with enough maltiness in the body to round it out. Each sip finishes with a appetizing bitterness that leaves you wanting another."
"Another beer in my ""honey, we got our tax return, let's each get fifty to blow and put the rest in the bank," beer. Poured a reddish gold color with a slightly off white fluffy head. Some lacing. Smelled hoppy, imagine that. Cascade mostly if I'm beginning to learn this stuff. Quite tasty. Very hoppy, but not as hoppy as I was expecting. Less of a hops assault more attention to detail. Decent mouthfeel, moderate body with good carbonation. A little oily, but that rarely detracts. Definately drinkable. I can't have more than one in a sitting, but will definately look forward to this each year. My one downside, as it warmed, the alcohol became rather obvious and overpowering."
"I get a brief sweet caramel hit up front and then hops roll in. SOme pine and some sour grapefruit. A little oily and chewy with a drying finish. This is a nice and smooth brew that is not overwhelmingly hoppy. Very nice to drink!"
"scores for 2007: 4.0, 4.0, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5... ... 4.3"
"All in all, a wonderful brew which should be done year-round, much like Bell's has wisely decided to do. Can't wait to find some more!"
"Got a 2003 bottle as part of Cellar Meat BIF 18 from pentathlete. After a year and a half, the hops had faded, and the beer could be considered balanced. The taste had taken on shades of an Old Ale at this age, with some chewy sweet malt. The hops lurked in the back as a peppery wispy presence. I much prefer the assertive fresh taste, but still much to like here."
"The taste is even better then I remember with a great big bite of hops and a creamy malt character. Notes of caramel and a slight pine taste. This truley is a taste explosion! One of the reasons I look forward to the holiday season. It doesn't get much better than this."
"Golden/brownish color body with a white head that leaves a smooth looking lace. Smell is spicy and hoppy with fresh green plants, leaves, rainforest. Also some florals and citrus aroma come through. Taste is very hoppy but not off the wall. Good malt taste upfront and a strong, but pleasing bitterness in the end. Also, slight coffee notes in the aftertaste if you look hard. Im not a big fan of IPA's but this one is pretty good."
" a female friend of mine took a sip of my celebration, made a face and asked why i would ""pay extra"" for something ""so harsh."" I paused and, content with my answer, did not reply."
"The holiday season means there are some great brews, and I can't thing of many better than this. I enjoy searching for this beer as the holidays approach. The snowy cabin on the label gives a feeling that if I was snowed in with this beer, life would be good. Pours a amber/reddish liquid with a great off-white foamy head. The head stayed around for quite some time. Great lace around the glass as time wore on. Smells of citrus, almost spicy. No mistake about it, this is going to be hoppy. The taste is as good as it gets. Hints of a sweet malt surrounded and overtaken by citrusy hops. Plenty of Cascades in this one. This is a hophead's delight. Great medium body. This may not be exactly be a session beer, but since it is a seasonal, make it one! I almost wish that this was a year round beer, but I am glad it is not, so I can appreciate it and look forward to the holidays. If you like hops, you must check this one out."
"Char"
"I really like this IPA. They should make it a normal offering and make something else their winter beer."
"quite simply a solid to excellent brew all around. pours a healthy amber/gold colour with a nice sized head that hangs out for a little while then leaves a nice chunky residue on the glass. smells of hop, bread, a bit toasty with floral notes and spice and citrus fruit hints. the taste is a bold hit of hop at first, and by bold i don't mean overdone, just powerful. this brew is medium bodied with a nice bitterness coming from the hops and a sweetness following in the back along with some malt flavouring. a nice toasted bread finish completes this one. a very easy drinking brew that is smooth but aggressive and, while it's one of if not the most mainstream holiday brew, is a nice alternative to the more fruit-based holiday beers that are out there. another well made brew from sierra nevada."
"One of the beers I look forward to all year, and squirrel a few away for spring. Easily one of the best IPAs in the world. A standard for west coast IPA. Great from the bottle, but absolutely stunning on tap. The hops are incredibly fresh."
"Drinkability: For an IPA, this is a pretty wonderful brew. Once it has had a chance to warm just a bit, the flavors become more complex, and it smoothes out just a bit. Nicely done."
"There's plenty of flavor and character here to satisfy any American pale ale or IPA fanatic. It's relatively cheap too, for a 6.8% well made IPA."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It is full of piney hops, pale, and crystal malts. It has a nice balanced aroma. The taste is great. It has the best of both worlds. It has a very intense hop flavor which is accompanied by a complex malt bill. The mouthfeel is also good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with excellent carbonation. This beer drinks great. It goes down easy and shows little sign of it's elevated abv. . This beer ranks along side the best I've had; a real good beer."
"A must have for the holidays. I enjoyed this vintage more than the last couple due to it's slight chewy malt characteristics. If you can keep this around until Valentine's day, you're doing better than me."
"Hey, it's a good beer but not a ""winter celebration"" type ale. Don't be fooled by the packaging!"
"i sat down with five coceutive years of this and found out that as the hops subside this becomes a great english still old ale. this year was full hpppy and wonderfully bitter, 2003 was still full bitter and hoppy 2002 starts to mellow and the hops start to fall away and expose more fruity character , the 2001 really starts to become and old ale with ripe fruit character and rich malt quilty, make no mistake their as still a great hop character its just becomes more sutle and allows the other flavors to come through"
"I'm not a card carrying member of the Hophead Society yet, but if I were this beer would probably get an even better score from me. I really didn't find this beer to be all that balanced, but the fact that it is so well-brewed and interesting atones for that. I will eventually acclimate myself to this style, so that when next winter rolls around, I will be ready to accept the onslaught of the Celebration Ale."
"Beautiful bronze colour, with a ring of head around the outside that leaves beautiful lacing around the glass. The smell is a subtle and beautiful scent of hops, almost as though you were walking through a field of hops, but not overpowering. Taste is heavenly. Major hop taste without being too bitter or acrid. Perfectly balanced with malts. Neither sweet nor sour, but just inbetween. A delicately balanced beer. The other surprise about Celebration is that it goes down super smooth. Aftertaste is pure hops without being overly bitter. Just that nice smooth bitterness. All around an exceptional beer. Too bad I got the last sixer from the beer store. It's a crime to have this beer be only seasonal. But then again I suppose one will appreciate it better."
"Comments- Wow, my first time with this beer and it sure made the last part of 2003 and the beginning of 2004 a blast. When I can no longer get this very special seasonal brew it will be a sad day. But it will sure give me something to look forward to next winter. One of my now all time favorites that I will be sure not to miss towards the end of the year."
"dark amber colored with a thin just slightly off white head. the smell is almost totally hops with a nice clean flowery fresh cut grass smell with pineyness, there is a caramel malt aroma with some baked bread. fresh hop flavors dominate, with a near sweet/ bitter grapefruit taste with that fresh hop spiciness. there is a caramel malt flavor profile underneath this with the same slight yeasty characteristics as the aroma. excellent fully carbonated, but not at all thin, while remaining crisp mouthfeel. probably one of the best beers that i've tasted. man, what a kick ass classic beer. get a case."
"Drinkability--I consider this to be one of the superior American IPA's. While I wouldn't quaff this, if I could only have one beer for an entire evening, this would be one of my top choices."
"Overall: a complex beer with bold flavor, not the second coming though, overrated"
"Now I know what all the fuss is about. Wow."
"DRINKABILITY: All winter long, baby!"
"The King recommends drinking this beer with a slice of Mom's home-made rhubarb pie."
"I've tried this both in the bottle and on tap, but I prefer the draught version. The head didn't last particularly long, but I didn't particularly care as this beer wasn't undelicious. The hop aroma is groin-grabbingly transcendent and being a hophead, I can't get enough of it. The bitterness is present but is balanced nicely with the malts. I love cascades (who doesn't?) and the citrusy characteristic of them is strong, and it helps to mask any alcohol flavor. Definitely the best IPA I've had that I didn't make myself..."
"The drinkability here is almost worthy of a 5.0, but the high ABV makes it a beer better served with a good, spicy meal. Not a session beer, but a special beer."
"Celebration 2003 poured with a small rough light tan head, and left nice fine lacing. The color was a very beautiful molten and glowing copper. The smell was mellow yet quite complex, with a lovely floral hop bouquet and a sublte malty notes. The taste was rich and delicious, with a superb whole grain malt backbone and perfectly matched assertive bitter finish. The beer felt amazingly full and velvety. This beer is quite an accomplishment. It is rich, dimensional, and hoppy, has a mouthfeel of a more expensive big beer, and yet costs the same as the other ""standard"" microbrews. A winner!"
"12oz. Bottle: This is a winter beer. It pours quite dark, with a tinge of red to it. The aroma is quite good, with aromas of citrus hops, malts, spices, floral notes, and quite possible some others. There is a full, rich taste with quite a nice hop kick to it. A very well balanced beer. Very, very good!!"
"A quick hop attack, gives way to a big round caramel powered malt flavour. Some toasted flavours make it a little more interesting. A sharp bitter whack heralds in orange & pine, with the pine flavour really popping after the swallow. Dry finish, medium body, easy carbonation. A winter classic."
"-Oelergud"
"Great Beer."
"I think the thing that makes this IPA so wonderful is that it doesnt taste like other IPA. No it doesnt have a high hop profile or a strong alcohol percentage, which Im used to. The beauty of this beer lies in the subtle yet complex flavor, a symphony of flavors from hops, herbs, spice to fruit. This beer has intoxicating diction, so that every ingredient complements another ingredient. Dont read this review, rather go and try some (and buy some to age)."
"Wow. Just had the 2003 vintage. I am not an IPA person, but this was really deserving of its reputation. Let me just say it is hoppy without being overwhelming. And that really boosted its drinkability for me. The taste has more nuance than that, but what can I say? Try it for yourself. I would be completely shocked if you were disappointed."
"The holiday season offers some of the best seasonal beers. However, hands down Sierra Nevada has one of the best seasonal brews. I buy it by the case because it sells so fast in my area. I cannot wait for my local beer store to get their Bigfoot ale in as well. If you are looking for a good seasonal brew I reccomend the celebration ale."
"Additional Comments 11-13-04: The hops are smoothed over a lot, big initial hop kick, but that flavor does not leave you with a gigantic hop bitter aftertaste. Unique and delicious. I think I appreciate it more after a year apart."
"On tap @Little Brothers: This beer was a reddish brown color and formed a small off white foamy head that left some nice circular lace. There was a medium amount of carbonation present. An aroma of malt, hops and citrus. A flavor of malt and strong presence of hops. A bit of a citrus aspect with a touch of spice. A bit of a bitter finish. A slightly different animal on tap in the 2003 version as compared to 2002, which I did not have the advantage of having on tap."
"This was the 2003 tap version...while still great, I am thinking that this would have been a bit smoother and the flavors a bit more meshed if I was drinking say a year-old version, but hey, here we go: Medium clear amber. Nice frothy head when served, but it settled down after awhile. Aromo was of a pine forest. Taste was of a meeting between the malt and the hops, with hops making it just slightly rough. Again, while drinking this, I thought, this is pretty good, but oh, it would much more enjoyable if aged! For a tap beer though, not bad, a bit rough and not really as smooth as it could be. pat"
"I've been away from Sierra Nevada for too long. I haven't had one for probably 10 years and been way too long. This is truly a great beer. To me its almost an Imperial IPA with all the hop to it. Amazingly quaffable beer and I can only dream and imagine how good this would be on draught."
"2003 vintage in a stubbie twisty."
"Good mouthfeel, fair carbonation. Not something my palate would say is highly drinkable, but one or two at a sitting would be cool. I'll have a go at it again next year now that I know more about the beer. If you're into strong India Pale Ales, this one is for you. Don't expect much more than a hop explosion, but if that's what you like, you're in for a treat."
"2003 Edition."
"This one poured a golden copper color with a frothy white head. The smell was citrusy and hoppy. As was the taste. I noticed lots of grapefruit along with some floral hops. But the malt backbone kept the hops in check, somewhat. This was still quite hoppy but not extremely bitter. Another winner from Sierra Nevada."
"Another great offering from SN. This beer poured the color of the mosquito fossil amber cane the old guy had in Jurrasic Park. At first it smelled crisp and clean like a cold winter morning, but then the super dry hop smell kicked in to let you know what was ahead. Like the SN Pale Ale, this beer is well balanced with smooth malt flavors across the tounge, with cirtus dry hops to balance out the beer. Molasses and tannin flavors that balance out nicely. A really nice beer that carries on SN's west coast brewing tradition"
"Pours a nice cloudy rich copper color under an off white two-fingered head with body and staying power. Nice lace rings linger down the glass. There's lots of fresh sweet hops in the nose, almost like a carnation it's so sweet and flowery. The mouth is very prickly and fairly light. The taste is scrumptious - lots of sweetly bitter hops, with what almost seems like a bit of apple juice somewhere in the back to add balance. The finish is all bitter, leaving a marvellously spicy aftertaste. This was the last beer I had before going to bed last night, and the aftertaste was so good I didn't want to brush my teeth and lose it! Yum!"
"What a wonderful beer!!"
"Truely a beer for the hophead, but maybe a let down for anyone expecting a spiced winter ale. This is without a doubt, an IPA. Amber in color with an off-white head that diminishes into a thin lace. Hop character is piney with a bit of grapefruit. A caremel malt flavor is almost completely hidden in the hoppy bitterness. Yes the winter is a miserable time of year, but this makes me look forward to it."
"Three of 'em will make you love any Sandra Bullock movie."
"While this is an amply malted brew, with some caramel and herbal qualities, the focus here is on the hops. Sharp-edged grapefruit bitterness and piney esters are in abundance. A light fruity background and a bit of metallic tang, along with some noticeable warming alcohol, make for a very flavorful ale, without resorting to an overwhelming quantity of alcohol. Celebration Ale will be one of the Christmas Eve offerings at my home this year."
"The Celebration poured a copper-amber color with a nice thick, creamy head with fine bubbles that retained to the bitter end. Very nice smelling with a nice hop and spiciness balance with some floral tones. Interesting taste - medium to full bodied with a spicy, slightly sweet, initial taste with some subtle malt and fruitiness. Then come the hops! A very hoppy finish, a little too bitter for me. Overall, the Celebration is a very interesting beer. The hoppy, bitter finish and aftertaste is a little too overwhelming for me and detracts from the taste and drinkability of the beer."
"This poured out a very clear and bright orange amber color with a perfect head of dense foam. Wow, this is an intensely flavorful beer. With an aroma full of sweet flowery hops and lemon grass. Nice tasting malt body with a strong lingering bitterness. Very easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"Great brew, very solid. Like many other BAs, I look forward to this each year."
"Hand-drawn tap at the Cock and Bull. This will become one of those memorable experiences that I will never forget. Poured an amazing hazy gold with a huge rocky plateau of a head that makes for an eternal wait of at least 5 minutes before the glass is filled. The delicately sweet and floral aroma is enticing. The taste and mouthfeel are what set this beer apart from other IPAs. The thick head looks deceptively solid, but reveals itself to be pure silk making for one of the smoothest mouthfeels I have ever experienced in a beer. The taste is briefly sweet with some citrus but quickly gives way to an assertive floral hop profile that is presented perfectly and lingers long after each sip. This beer is an incredible experience in alchemy. The alcohol is very deceptive in this one and I feel it drinks much stronger than its percentage."
"Deep amber robe, hazy, well-laced white head from which a good part never disappears. Rich citrus (grapefruit) aroma with notes reminiscent of the christmas tree (piney, resinous, herbal). Good hop character, finish is moderately bitter, just hoppy enough I found. Medium body, good balance. It's certainly good, but it doesn't impress me."
"Bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $1.35. 2003 vintage. Poured a copper color with a lot of carbonation. White head as thick as my finger. Had a spicy hoppy scent, with a caramel-sweet maltiness hovering in the background. While the taste is dominated by hoppiness, its not overbearing like many IPAs I've known. While subdued by comparison, the maltiness is definitely not afraid to come out and play, with a nice caramel flavor that complements the spiciness of the hop flavor quite well. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. This is not something that will thrill people with an unhealty hop sensation, but it is a very drinkable IPA that I will remember when I next go for a sixer."
"The flavor was overwhelmingly hoppy with hints of grapefruits and other citrus flavors. Not a lot of malt presense in this beer. As my palate started to adjust towards the bitterness I actually started to enjoy this brew."
"The taste is not at all what I expected. Its surprisingly peppery spiciness is not of the sort that the smell would seem to presage. Its hoppiness reminds me again of Santa's Private Reserve, but here the hops are very crisp and not as bitter. It's quite drinkable and the big, steep peaks of lacing left at the end are a bonus, but I'm somewhat turned off by the distinct taste of pepper and the absence of the more jolly winter spices."
"P.S. Just realized this is my 100th beer review. Couldn't have planned it any better if I tried!"
"I shall consume again."
"This is the most drinkable of Sierra's seasonals, and beats its flagship Pale Ale hands down. This is something to look forward to each Christmas season."
"I cannot imagine anyone not wanting another. In fact, one leads to another, drawing you in like a moth to a flame. The ABV is just such that you likely can afford to indulge in as many as your senses tell you you require to satisfy The Urge. In fact, this beer may qualify as The Gateway beer that turns you on to many others. But whatever it is, its about as good as it gets, with a few exceptions, and henceforth just the view of that festive label will be enough to make me knock off work and imbibe."
"Other than the apperance, this was an above average brew for me. I am not really a hop head, so it just didn't do it for me. I will say though, that it was better than most hoppy ales. The smell was hoppy, the taste was hoppy, and that was about it. Never really got anything other than hops. Hope this review doesn't discredit me, but if it does, so be it."
"Yep, I could live on this stuff. Always a treat year in and year out. Can only see this one getting better with age... have put aside a few just for that purpose. Has been tops on my list of special holiday ales for a decade now."
"I wish all brewers could make beer this delightful."
"The color and aroma was glorious.An orange and amber hue hid below a pillow of eggshell white froth.Quick dissipation was not on it's list of things to do.Trails of lacing remained.The scent is of distant spice and a wallop of hops and citrus. Taste was immense with great balance and a bold finish of strong hops. Nice,smooth and a bit chewy. In my opinion, one of the best beers made. It's too bad that it's a seasonal.I could drink it all the time and never tire of it."
"2003 edition. The body is a hazy amber/orange color, topped with a well crafted foamy white head. Excellent lacing. The scent is of hops, big hops. The taste of this brew is a excellent mix of a huge dose of hops combined with smooth malts. Very smooth feeling beer. The one problem with this is that its too easy to drink, and before you know it you will have put down ten and receive a nice reminder the next morning."
"The hop bomb returneth! This is the infamous SN Celebration Ale, what can be described as their Pale Ale on steroids. Sticky, slightly sweet, bitter, and hoppy - this monster will lay waste to your palette and laugh in its' wake. Not for the uninitiated, this one is supremely balanced and chock full of flavor. The only thing wrong with this brew is that it's not made year round.... Excellent! Get it while you can!"
"A very light, tan, crusty, sticky head leaves lots of sticky lacing. The beer is clear, reddish/amber. Nice. Huge, mouth-watering Cascade in the nose along with a sweetish maltiness. The front is very bitter but settles to a sweet, malty, somewhat creamy middle. Hoppy bitter in the finish, of course. Grapefruit burps. This is a very tasty Cascades IPA with a full malty middle. I love the hop monsters, but this one really needs to warm up for the malt to take the edge off the hops. For me, the competition in this field wins."
"Pours out a copper/amber color with a thick frothy off white head very nice and it maintains for quite a while then slowly thins out never fading out completely. Carbonation was moderate and had a medium bodied mouth feel. Aroma was straight up hops, citrus hops, floral hops, spiced hops and a piney/grassy aroma. Flavor was much the same as the aroma straight up hops spicey and floral hops were the strongest flavors noticable a bit and tiny bit of caramel malt. There was a slight bitterness and aftertaste IMO. Good brew but not my favorite SN...."
"Terrific amber hue with a massively rocky, tan head with fantastic lace. A citrusy grapefruit dominates the nose but a noticeable hops aroma is present as well. Occasionally I could detect a note of pine. Balance was not the objective; the flavors are mainly hops... damn tasty pine (and grapefruit). Faint malt sweetness could be perceived as well. This beer is surprisingly firm, yet smooth, in the mouthfeel department. The 6.8% abv makes this a true winter warmer! This brew is lip-smacking, mouthwatering good! This is a must try! The lack of balance may deter some and the power of the hops may deter others. I think this beer is worthy of the praise, even though it is not as hoppy as I had expected."
"I had the good fortune of finding a sixer of this at Kappy's. Ran about $8. Had an deep amber color with a decent head. The twist off makes it way too easy. The taste was hoppy, but not over powering. The label said 2003, but I don't think the taste changes much year to year. Bitter sweet, this is a fantastic beer. If only store 24 carried it!"
"Definitely not what I expected for a winter seasonal. Great thing was, I had a desire for a well hopped beer when I got home from work. Celebration was just the ticket. A really well-built IPA. Too bad it isnt around all year."
"Very drinkable and very buyable for 5.49 a sixer in Toledo Ohio."
"SNCA may just be my favorite beer in the world - certainly my favorite American beer. I twist off the cap of a 2003 bottle with much anticipation. It pours an orangey-red with with a thin, fine-bubbled head. The nose is full of piney hops, making me remember that this is the drink to set up a Christmas tree with - forget egg nog. Taste is all hops, but with a firm malty body to back it up. Just the perfect mouthfeel to keep you coming back for more - not too thick, not too thin. A perfect beer, hence the 5's in all categories."
"If you enjoy drinking IPA's then you will not be disappointed. If you like this brew try Victory Hopdevil."
"2003 was the first year I tasted this, which turns out to be something I should have done earlier. Pours starting out with a nice two-finger head, fluffy in the middle, with a medium bead. After a minute or two, head subsides and remains at about one finger or so. Abundant bubble strings streaming through deep bronze-colored liquid, almost glowing orange around the edges of the glass when held up to light. Nice color! Lace is clingy at first; later slides easily down sides of glass. Aroma is distinctly citric and hoppy; by aroma alone you can recognize this as an IPA. Caramelly hints of malt in the middle of the nose. Taste is of lots of American hop, citrusy juiciness, and another light, caramelly maltiness at the back of the palate. Lemon juice, orange rinds; just a touch of spice, nutmeg? clove? consistent with the season. Mouthfeel is outstanding. Juicy, wet, moreish, with that citric character really cleansing the palate with lemony wetness, not as dry as the majority of IPAs. No alcohol taste to speak of; deeply quenching and moreish. Very drinkable... the first time I encountered this beer was on draft and I wasn't familiar with the alcohol content, so a friend and myself ordered it by the pitcher and treated it like a session beer, which, in retrospect, wasn't the most accurate approach. That won't keep me from enjoying a few more six-packs (at a more appropriate pace) this season. Its chart position is understandable... Recommended."
"John"
"Awesome at cellar (55-60) temperature."
"Had it on tap. Even better. Fresher, hoppier, tastier. This has quickly become one of my top beers."
"Drinkability: Grab a case or two and get ready for snow. Yum."
"Get some if you can. You'll not be disappointed."
"This is for the 2003 release. pretty much the same as far as appearance, color and head go. But the aromas and taste are definately different. The main noticable difference this year is in the hops. There is a more grassy straw aroma and taste. Its tart and tasty. Not too sweet and not to bitter. Though it definately is a bitter beer. Once again SN comes up with another great seasonal."
"The beer that i've been tying to find up here for a week or so. Poured a medium head, receding slowly. The first taste was of hops and then spices as is typical of the season. The carbonation that i felt at first was replaced by a smooth finish. a very good seasonal."
"2003 edition. Ahh, first holiday beer of the year. Dark amber, sticky head with good retention. Smell is hops, hops, hops, hops, and hops. Piney, sprucy strong hops. Touch of malt at the beginning and then painful Xmas tree hops flood the palate and leave a lasting intense bitterness. Not enough balance here. There seems to be a touch of clove or nutmeg or cinnamon in here. Pretty tasty but I would have liked to have these holiday spices have more presence, and overall this one isn't balanced for my taste."
"The brewer from Bell's was at The Brickskeller a few weeks ago singing the praises of Sierra Nevada's consistency. He has a point. Celebration never disappoints."
"same great IPA, very spicy hop notes and very green grassy fresh hop nose and taste. like throwing in a hop dip straight from the vine, nice and oily"
"Notes: Excellent, excellent beer. I can't wait to taste this along with next year's version, as I've never had a truly fresh bottle. Highly recommended."
"2002 On Tap:This beer's appearance was a small sized ivory head that was creamy and smooth and contained fine-small sized bubbles that was mostly lasting.The body was uncarbonated and clear with a reddish hue.The nose was hoppy and malty with a very bitter and hoppy flavor.The mouthfeel was fairly smooth and somewhat tingly and it was medium bodied.There was a fair amount of lacing with this beer.I am not a hop head by any means so this one tasted very hoppy and bitter to me."
"Poured out that amber hue, some head retention, lots and lots of lace. Once in your mouth, it's lighter body is somewhat deceptive of it's real power. Powerful hop prescenes will smack you in the face (in a good way), and has some nice sweet and spice to it going down, smoothly finished off with a small bite. Seasonals- YAY!"
" IPA, Winter warmer, whatever you want to call it, SNCA is to me, one of the best large production beers available. A valid reason to look forward to Winter."
"The 2003 edition and how happy am I. Beautifully constructed (again) with a combination of I assume those biscuity english and caramel malts and a good hit of cascade hops along with a few other varieties for good measure. Just outstanding and will need to go get another sixer soon. Makes winter a lot more tolerable."
"There is little doubt why this is always one of the more anticipated arrivals every fall"
"Taste is dominated by assertive hops with a sour spicy (nutmeg flavors among others) malt. medium bodied but feels bigger than that. Smooth and drinkable. One of my favorite winter seasonals, never disappoints."
"Just got my first 2003 six pack, and I was in heaven. Poured a amber / orange color with a thick bubbly head that remained through most of the drink. Lacing was beautiful. Aroma sported strong hops, with a sweet / sour sensation. The taste is great - strong hops with a nice balance of sweet malt. Some citrus seems to arrive on the tongue with the bitterness after swallowing. The carbonation level is perfect, giving some crispness to the mouthfeel. Alcohol level is barely detectable. One of the most drinkable beers I know, as several can be consumed in an afternoon or evening."
"And as far as the 6.8% ABV, you would never know it was even there, it was that well hidden with all the flavors."
"I just wasn't as overwhelmed by this beer as most people seemed to be. It's not bad in any way, it's just not up there with my favorite IPAs (HopDevil, Ruination, etc.). Still, I'd probably give it another try."
"Drinkability: An excellent offering. SN Celebration is basically SNPA on steroids. A beer worth wishing the onset of winter for."
"Nice drinkable mouthfeel, I call this the star of Sierra Nevada. I crave having this beer around through the cooler months."
"Overall Impression: Even though it’s 87 degrees outside, this beer summoned the Christmas spirit in me. It warmed me with its potent alcohol level, cheered me with its color and lace, and impressed me with a full hop taste but no impulse to pucker. I’m a fairly rabid hophead, but the intensity of the taste and the potent alcohol kick (which is felt much more than tasted) cuts back on drinkability. Like Christmas, part of the magic is in the rarity of the experience. Paired it with a smoked Gouda cheese, which complimented it well. Recommended."
" ""This is a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, this is a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on hops"". Great representation of an IPA."
"as it is fresh and full of gusto...it is unbalanced and extremely bitter. delicious nonetheless. because a steady supply of SN has finally reached my area, i will be buying as much of this as i can to drink this holiday season and a bunch more to lay down and age for future reference. wow is this a killer IPA."
"Appearance: Immaculatey forms with deep copper amber tone and a two finger sized cream colored head leaves behind scattered lacing very nice brew. Aroma: This one doesn't take you by the hand, it just wallops you with cascades and a huge layered malt profile, floral and piney with a caramel malt like sweet scent this one is amazing. Taste: Well, I this beer and I met early in my beer journey a few years back when I was first getting into beers I ran into this on tap in Fuel and Fuddle in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh. To this point my brother Dante' and friend Kolby had tried many different beers together, however after ordering the SNCA my bro and friend were totally turned off making statements like ""this tastes like pine sol"" and ""that's overkill on the hops"" well I am proud to say I didn't have that reaction. I absolutely love this beer from the first time I tasted it. Cascades slide upon the palate with an oily resin given them their lubricant capable of being so silky and smooth, while the hops do steal the show I still find this one balanced enough with caramel sweet sticky maltiness so good. Mouthfeel: Perfect carbonation, hop burps come after only three or four sips medium bodied well textured I love it. Drinkability: Definitely need to pick up a case of this beer this coming winter enough hops and malt to keep me happy for a long time."
"2003 batch kind of weird seeing poinsettias on Halloween but oh well. Dark amber color with a head that is bubbly and coats the glass to the last drop. Smells of sweet version of pine resin very hoppy. Hops come threw full bore in the initial taste but a slight malt sweetness comes threw on the aftertaste. Not being a real hophead I fully appreciate this beer for it gives one of the best tastes of a truly hoppy beers where everything tastes like it is unison."
"In my opinion, this is the perfect beer. I had this baby on tap for the first time tonight and was blown away. It has a beautiful dark red/amber colour with a nice white head that left great lace down the whole glass. The smell was great;the hops jumped right out at you and did not let go, and the citric bite was prevelant as well. the taste was pure beer goodness with the perfect mixture of hop bitterness and a touch of malty sweetness to balance it out. There were also great citric flavors in there and it was not really dry tasting like a lot of IPA type beers are, but it was very very drinkable. If you can find this brew on tap or in the bottle, you will definantly be hooked!"
"Hopheads paradise brew. Excellent cloudy copper appearance, with a chunky head that laces nicely. Oustanding smell, citrusy with strong hop presence. Taste is pure hops straight forward and delicious. Aftertaste remains nicely in its bitterness. A slight puckery mouthfeel reminds you of the hop presence. Very drinkable for a high abv and hyper hops."
"I sure was glad to see a new beer at the Utah State Liquor Store, especially one as delicious as this. 2003 edition. Amber/copper body with a sticky, light tan head. Very good retention. Smells of some maltiness, but mostly hops, hops, and hops. Very resiny and sprucy. Very appetizing as well. Taste reveals more malt than the smell. Not too sweet, but good body to balance the crazy hops. Very resiny, piney, spicy, and medicinal. As the beer warmed, I swear I was tasting some hints of nutmeg as well. A crescendo of Xmas tree bitterness lingers into the finish. Very good, but not my favorite high-octane IPA. Big and oily mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable for its strength and bitterness."
"This is a really good one, especially on tap. Since it has the high ABV, I usually have maybe two pints, move on to something else and call it a nite."
"Had this on tap at Anam Cara. Tasted very similar to last year's offering (of which me and my wife consumed probably 5 cases). Just looking now for a local package store that has the cases in stock for under $30. A wonderful hoppiness with enough malt body to support it. Nice russet/orange color and aromatics."
"Year after year, a great offering from Sierra. A little less balanced than previous years but if you like your hops to punch first and ask questions later, then this is a beer for you. Highly recommended!"
"I'm looking forward to drinking more of this while it lasts. It's only October, so I have awhile to go. I think this is the first review of the 2003 edition, and it's also my first ever beer review!"
"This is a very smooth drinker. It has some oily qualities but they do not hinder the enjoyment of this IPA. Very crisp and dry on the palate. Very nicely done."
"2002 vintage - Nice big hoppy aroma is a most noticeable feature. The color is a golden amber - very small head when poured. Has a nice malty sweetness that is immediately offset by a citrusy hop bite. This follows into a pungent aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice and full. I can hardly wait for the 2003 version!"
"Rating is for 2002 version .Medium gold color, large foamy head. Hoppy spicy aroma. Malty and very aggressively hopped. Malts are slightly sweet and balance the big bold hops well. Think this year's version is better than the 2000 edition. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter, Bid bodied IPA. Really nice. Well age well I think. 2000 vintage- Medium brown color, small head. Medium malts, aggressively hopped ale. Full flavor, full mouthfeel, nearly chewy. Good hop to malt balance. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is bitter."
"Ok, I freely admit it I am extremely biased when it comes to this beer. I used to buy cases of this stuff every year. I finally broke down and started to buy a keg of it instead. The first time I had this it absolutely blew me away. The hops where so intense so fresh the just screamed to break free from the confines of the bottle. This beer is definitely best when fresh, because it is all about the hop flavor and aroma. The hops lend a wonderful spicy citrusy greatness to this beer. And wonderfully the brewers saw fit to outfit this paragon with a solid malt backbone that just carries and delivers the hop celebration to every corner of your mouth. Just a plain awesome beer."
"Drinkability: Could drink alot if i had it. but in short supply"
"1996-Very malty in taste, that hoppiness that is so present in the unaged stuff is gone. It is a darker amber color with many complex flavors. Sample as many years as you can, its a great beer to put aside and let age."
"One of my all time favorite beers. A beer that screams with hop flavor, like someone squeezed a grapefruit in the bottle. The chinook, centennial and cascade hops stand up proud for sure. This beer also has a very stiff malt backbone that makes the beer very enjoyable overall...and quite drinkable...just don't drink it first in a flight cause it will ruin you."
"Notes: In my opinion this beer gains nothing from aging. It's perfectly balanced now. I've tried one aged 6 years or so lately, and while it was still good, it had lost most of its hoppy characteristics. Find something to celebrate about this year, and buy a case or two!"
"A strong IPA that is almost like a Winter Ale, very smooth yet hoppy in the final taste. Copper colored with the smell of floral and hops that are strong in the nose.. a nice winter ale that is warming and actually grows smoother as the beer gets warmer."
"Notes: Beautiful, well-balanced IPA. Mustard says drink."
"A nice find in the middle of summer,a 2002 offering.Pours a nice copper clor with light to medium head that has some nice staying power,the aroma is hop zesty with a slight sweet background.The taste is very hoppy and citrus like but there is caramel malt taste that lingers as well.Very well done stays real well."
"Originally samploed on 9 November 2002. I am writing this review from mynotes. This pours a clear harvest gold in color. The flavor has lots of hops on the palate. In my humble opinion, this is not an outstanding beer, but it is far better than average"
"2002 Bottle: Yep, liked it, like their Pale ale, this was nice and soft, with a perfumy flowery, piney hop nose, i could sniff this for a while. Very well balanced flavour, the start is sweetish malty with a bit of raisins or something, with a failry sharp, bitter, grapefruity hop finish, very tasty, and thankfully not over the top, very yummy."
"Nice looking deep amber ale reminds me of a glass of apple cider. Millions of tiny particles floating giving it a cloudy like appearance. Thick creamy head with an almost blanket like lacing. Aroma is predominantly cascade hops, a trademark of this fine California brewer. Very smooth on the palate, a medium to full bodied ale which finishes with a little crispness. This is a great winter time ale and one worthy of celebrating."
"2002 edition bottled 11/02, sampled 06/03. pours a clear dark mahogony with a long lasting, tight, creamy head. roasty malts and citrusy hops on the nose. spicy, oily, roasted malty flavor followed by a lemony hoppiness. full, smooth, creamy body with a good level of carbonation. the hops have mellowed somewhat and aren't as ""green"" as upon initial relaese. i taste a more pronounced chocolate character as well. has mellowed nicely in 8 months while still retaining the characteristic hoppy snap. and all around great beer to look forward to at xmas, and one that seems to stand the test of time well."
"2002 was not the best of the years, but was still one of the greats."
"celebration ale, you wonderous creation. pours ruby red and lovely with big aromas of citrus/piney hops that make you drool. the flavor, full and robust, some nice malt is there, but the whole story is about the hop. from the first sip, a mouthwatering twang hit the back of your jaws and from then on its a wonderful pine/grapefruit hop experiance. clean and crisp is the mouthfeel, lightly filling but in a comforting way. finishes with a tangy mouth puckering zip and the 6.9 % alcohol makes this brew so very deceiving. and thats just fine by me."
"-""Hop-a-long"" winter beer....very hoppy with flowery and citrus tones...creamy finish...not a lot of malt balance but hops seem to settle as you drink deeper..Very solid beer particularly if you like a ""hoppy"" winter style."
"I've had many of these fine beers from the 2002 batch. What a wonderful and warming beer. You don't need to be celebrating something to drink this beer, you should just be celebrating it's existence. I sure celebrated finding this beer (3 actually, shared with Marty and EmoBeerGuy) discarded in a dorm hallway next to a trash-can. I don't know who discarded it, but we were more than happy to give them a home. I finally drank mine, probably the last one I'll find until next year, today on a cool late summer day. It was just as good as I remembered all the others this year being. The wonderful deep amber and thick head with lace that does not quit is only a modest hint of greater things to come. The wonderful hop aroma is likely the most pleasant I've experienced. If you like very hoppy beers that are nearly perfectly balanced with malt and some fruit, you will love this beer. The medium body and near perfect carbonation make this beer a pure joy to drink. The 6.8abv doesn't hurt either, considering there is no hint at all of the strength of this beer. All in all this is just a great beer."
"Overall, a good beer and a nice change of pace from the usual winter seasonals."
"This ale tasted of hops first and foremost, then malt with some fruit and hints nutmeg. Great mouth feel, low carbonation, and decent lacing. A great seasonal brew. Thanks tavernjeff for the samples."
"I had this in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. There is a good 1.5 fingers of off-white foam, as I drink a fair amount of lacing is left on the glass. The color is a cloudy brownish red. The smell of spices and hops are very overwhelming, but exceptional! The taste is all spice and hops. There is maybe a little bit of clove or nutmeg in this one, and it has a good bitter finish from the cascade hops. The drinkability is very good for this style. The mouthfeel is heavy, yet smooth on the tounge. This is one great Christmas brew!"
"Signature fresh hop sweetmalt nose. Cystal clear reddish color and look, Thick sticky, rocky, head that lasts and a lace that clings to ya like your college girlfriend did... The taste is dominated by a hoppy, earthy, signatures and the brew has a chewy caramal malt backbone. This brew can '""take a lickin and keep on tickin"" (and no referances to my college girlfriend again). As the beer warms the mouth smoothes more and more.. Smooth medium to fuller mouth comforts the tongue. This beer is the perfect way to celebrate if you love hoppy brews. At 6.8% very drinkable. You will fall in love with it without thinking (like you did in college)!"
"Fairly big, fluffy, white head. Farmer's market aroma -- fresh flowers and citrus fruits -- that includes the very floral and evergreen hop aromas. Nicely medium-bodied. The hops are definitely the predominant flavor generator in this brew; they creep over the tongue from start to finish. Very subtle -- a wee bit of an unbalanced flavor here -- malt sweetness upfront and through the middle, but this finishes with a clean, big hop presence. I had two, but I don't think I could have any more; it just lies a bit to far over the hoppy line to drink a lot, but the high alcohol content is very deceiving. I really love Sierra Nevada, and this is another great offering from them."
"Feel is a lighter-medium body with a very crispy sweet dryness that starts in the middle and settles down through the finish and has a great evenly smoothed out bite with a very subtle but potent alcohol warming, which only now I'm starting to feel. Wow, some damn good stuff. I think I'll have another, yes I will."
"I love this beer! It's beautiful; pours a golden amber hue with a tall, foamy, lasting head that leaves a sticky lace down the inside of the glass. The taste is crisply hoppy and malty sweet. I was having trouble characterizing the smell, but one of my friends hit it right on the nose... peach! There are definitely hints of peach in this beer. One of my all-time favorites."
"Not the first time I've had this beer and certainly not the last. Deep golden-amber hue, deeper than most IPA. Nose is straight hops, to warn you of whats about to hit your palate. The flavor is a hop lovers dream. Straight hops all the way, classic over the top American IPA. What I think is so amazing about this beer is the ABV which is totally inconito. I would have never know. This is a beer that, if drank in large quantities, would surely sneak up on you. While IPA isn't may favorite style (I find it a bit too one dimentional) this beer takes that dimention and does it perfectly. Want an IPA. Drink this!"
"Comments: Very fine brew. Great flavors and extremely well balanced. Thank you Keith (stegmakk) for the ""other two bottles""."
"Pours a dark orange with an initial sensational smell of hops and fresh fruit. The taste is primarily floral hops throughout with just a hint of orange peel, banana and very slight roasted malt, but overall powering on the hops. The ABV seems to be mixed in wonderfully for a nice, but not overpowering warmness. A wonderful beer all around, today I agonize over not buying the entire rack of this version."
"Id been looking forward to trying this brew for the longest time and it was well worth the wait. Pours a beautiful reddish/copper color with fluffy 3/4-inch head, which leaves a medium-thin, sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is all about the hops! Hints of citrus peel were detected amongst the intense scent of hops. This is one great full-bodied beer that packs a full arsenal of hops. The sweet bitter aftertaste of orange peel and hops left me begging for more. I will most definitely seek this one out again, once its released next year."
"I wish I could find more but I think there is no more...these were the last 3 bottles I found (gave 2 away to a fellow BA)..."
"What we have here is a sturdy American-style IPA with a well-rounded personality."
"Complex, warming, consistent, a great winter ale -- one whose passing I mourn every spring."
"Waiting on friends and having sampled the run of draft beers that I would order, I asked for an old stand-by Sam Smith's which was not carried any more. What other bottles, then? Celebration (and a host of mass-swill). Stared at the nice label graphics then poured into my waiting glass. Fine all-around look to this one -- deep hazy-brown and few, tiny foam bubbles of white, running for the sides. Bold, hoppy aroma. This beer held captive the Cascade hops that I love, only releasing the chain-gang busters once inside. And the flavors of this seasonal carried over nicely with each sip. De-lish hops, de-lish beer."
"This is one of the few great beers that is affordable to buy by the case. This is a very hoppy brew. Almost like a Kangaroo on steroids. Pours out dark amber with a nice head. Tastes of hops. If you let it warm up a bit, it becomes a more complex brew, but still a hop monster. You should always have a few of these on hand."
"This brew poured a copper color with sort of an amber color when held to the light. The head was off-white and about a quarter of an inch thick. The aroma was complex with hints of citrus, hops, and alcohol. The taste was basically the same as the nose with citrus up front and the spice of the alcohol in the middle. The finish is bittery with a nice bite, the citrus also comes back a little in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was nice with good carbonation and it went down smooth. This is my favorite winter seasonal and in my top three overall, what a great beer."
"it has a solid malt base to play off the playful hops. It could do with a touch more body to equalize the bitterness but that's just nitpicking.This beer has a slight chewiness to the body that dances with the hops,maybe it is the yeasty fruitiness here with a tiny bit of caramel malt. The hops give a nice citrus flavor that's almost flowery and a nice long bitter finish.Nicely balanced.As it warms a very nice grapefruit flavor stands out. I like it."
"This is one of the beers that I actually seek out to buy every year. Unfortunately it's not readily available here on the east coast. Once again this yrs version did not disappoint if you like this type of ale. Nice copper color with decent head that leaves a nice lace on the glass. Slightly bitter, this is not the type of beer that you chug nor do have several at a sitting. Also it help to pair with the right food - spicy work well. I've never seen this on tap but would certainly love to find it, let me know if anyone knows where in the Boston area!"
"Very drinkable for such a strong brew..and none of the stringent alchol taste..great beer."
"Very different from most winter seasonals iv'e had. The copper color is hazed with a very fine sediment. The white pillowy head fades and leaves a thin lace as you drink. A strong citric aroma of hops and medicinal alcohol lets you know your in for something special. The taste is spicy and balanced at first then the hoppy bitter flavor asserts itself and lingers. A great choice to have with some spicy food, i enjoyed it with some hot wings."
"If you like hoppy west coast-style beers, this is for you. If not, their are much better winter beers. I just don't think this fits as a winter seasonal when you live somewhere cold and snowy. That's the bottom line for me."
"My tiny complaint, though this is a brew that I sample and enjoy every year, like all beer lovers, is that it's character doesn't offer much than you'd imagine of a super-hoppy IPA. When I think of seasonal wintertime beers, I expect something darker, with extra flavors, suitable to the chilly days we have have to endure. (At least, those of us who have winter...). It's a pity they don't release this year 'round as an IPA, as that's the only staple missing from their portfolio."
"This is a good beer, but not something that I would necessarily drink lots of on a cold winter night as it is designed for. The look is really good, with a nice deep, golden hue with a creamy, white head. The smell had nice fruity flavors and I was excited to drink it. the first taste was a bit of a let down. It came on much too bitter and the fruit flavors were way too citrusy for me. It did have a nice hop finish, and I must admit the further down the glass I got the better it tasted. I might try this again, this time letting it warm up for another 5-10 minutes, but I have had better IPA's."
"Presentation: Packaged in a stubby twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass. The edition reviewed was 2006."
"Amber in appearance with abundant frothy head. Hops are quite evident in nose along with spiciness. Taste has obvious hoppiness and spiciness (somewhat herbal). I could not really detect anything fruity about this, although others have mentioned a subtle fruitiness. In all honesty, I wasn't terribly big on the taste. I like hops, but this was a bit overpowering. Although, it went pretty well with some spiciness food. Very warming - no wonder this is for the winter. Mouthfeel was surprisingly smooth. Drinkable enough, although I wouldn't drink too much of this one."
"My friend had a keg of this brew for his birthday a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since. I had to wait until I could sit down with one in front of the PC to give an honest review, else bias would have made this an all 5s brew... Pours a nice golden/ruby color with a small head that dies quick. Scent is all malt and hops. If you like hops, you'll love this brew. Right away the hops explode in your mouth, nice & raw, with the sweet malt there to balance it out. Spicy citrousy notes. One thing that makes this one of my favorite christmas brews is the fact it's not too spicy like some other american breweries that seem to go over the top with strange,unidentifiable spices. This brew is great malty taste + tons of hops. Hops linger in the mouth for awhile after a swig. I could drink this all night (and have on occasion). A great brew, one of my favorites regardless of style."
"The mouthfeel is definatly ritch and well rounded, and the overall drinkablity is great. Although, deffinatly not a session beer, this beer is one of those treats that makes being a Beer Advocate all the more rewarding!"
"SN Celebration Ale 2002: Slightly different from the other strong hopped character beers i've tried so far. I am not a big fan of hopped beers but i found this one a bit different and more balanced. It pours a cloudy light brown/reddish colour topped by a thick head that settles down rather easily. Flavour and aroma are dominated by hops but this Ale is very well balanced. The taste is not that bitter as i would expect from a strong hopped beer. Quality seasonal brew..."
"This ale poured to give a coppery colored, cloudy beer with very thin white foam that left nice lace on the glass. The aroma was interesting with the dominant aroma from barley and malt, but with some odor of hops and apples. The taste was dominated by hops - sharp and almost acrid with some fruitiness and spicy oakiness. There was a lingering aftertaste of bitter hops. The mouthfeel was smooth with a strong hop bitterness throughout but with a mild sweetness in the finish. The carbonation was moderate. The drinkability was good for this clean and crisp IPA."
"But it doesn't stop there; a juicy underlying fruitiness from the yeast adds to its vibrancy. The body is light enough to be highly drinkable, but also full enough to combine with the very fine natural carbonation giving it an exceptionally smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The flavor, like the aroma, is dripping with fresh floral and citrusy hop character - but it's not so bold that it's over-powering or minty. Instead, it's delicately balanced against a softly sweet, nutty and bready caramel-soaked maltiness that emphasises the hops. It showcases the soft, and almost sweet character of the Cascade hops! Balance is what this beer is all about, and it's bitterness is no exception. It's not intense (which would ruin the palate and overshadow it's supple maltiness, but it is quite solid and becomes drying in the finish. It pushes and pulls throughout the pint but never becomes the centerpiece. Finesse, not bravado, wins the prize here!!!"
"2nd review: After 2 Years of aging a Celebration Ale it has developed great carbonation with tons of bubbles rising up.Very bitter mouthfell and finish.A fine white lace with a swirling haziness.The color is a dark orange to light brown.Mouthfeel is not watery and has some body to it.Bitterness has overshadowed the hop taste.Aging does change a beer alot."
"NB: Had on draught, this WAS mellower and even better."
"2002: I've grown a strong liking for hoppy ales lately, and I was very, very satisfied upon drinking the Celebration Ale. From the bottle, it poured a nice, dark orange / brown color. A beautiful full head stood atop the glass, and was very well-retained throughout. Complex and tight lacing was also present, and I'd have to describe its overall appearance as creamy and full on top, sharp and mellow below. A luxurious hop aroma was present, and a nice spiciness added to the wonderful smell. A very pronounced hop bitterness was noticed in the taste, along with a subtle and pleasant maltiness. The higher alcohol presence was noted but not intrusive...most welcome, in fact, on this cold December night. A full, creamy mouthfeel was cut sharply by the prickly carbonation and felt great in the mouth. Overall, the Celebration Ale has been one of the best brews I've tasted since I began seriously reviewing beer. It's a great seasonal brew, and will very likely accompany my holiday celebrations for years to come."
"Pours the color of fallen leaves, browns, reds and burnt orange hues all mingle together. Unbelievable thick and firm head that leaves a proficient lace down the sides of the glass. Sweet malt aroma is there behind a grapefruit wall of hops. Light Roasted malts leave a caramel taste in my mouth but the hops come to the forefront at the finish. Very drinkable ""winter"" brew."
"Fluffy, off-white head with tiny silver bubbles. Bright copper color, slight chill haze. Aroma is slight fruit, with massive grapefruit peel. The taste starts with a malty, bready, slightly sweet flavor followed by a huge rush of nice citrusy, grapefruit hops, slight alcohol, with a very long lasting bitter finish. Nice, full mouthfeel punctuated by lively carbonation in the hoppy finish."
"Another fine example of an American IPA. It gives warmth to your body, pleasure to your eyes, and spicy hop aromas for your olfactory."
"A thick, meringue head forms atop a crystal clear deep copper/ruby liquid. The initial aroma is *wham*..grapefruit in bushels! If one concentrates, you can also detect a little alcohol escaping from those tiny bubbles. Head forms a nice brussels lace and stay with the beer until you're done. Bittering hops are well balanced to the sweetness and body of the malt, and finishes with strong hops bitterness and sugar cookies. Excellent mouthfeel...nice and chewy. Comparing the bottled version to draught of the same year, I would say that the draught had a thinner head, a somewhat milder hop profile (i.e.-a little more rounded and smooth), and had less bitter hop finish, which in my opinion made the draught more enjoyable. A great beer, and one I look forward to each year. If you like this, try Bell's Two-Hearted Ale. Get both on tap if you can!"
"On the palate it's solidly hoppy (grapefruit) with slow, silky, rivulets of light caramel syrup raining down afterwards. Cured, dried herb is the theme here though. Feels like I'm working in a hop mine, taking a break to eat ruby red grapefruit...herb smoke afterwards. The guy next to me is eating red skin peanuts, and not in a polite way either...Someone lights the incense..."
"Pours a very attractive, not-quite-clear amber orange. Active carbonation feeds a substantial foamy, light head that dissipates rather quickly but laces quite impressively down the side of the glass. Even when well-chilled, this beer has a strong, wonderful nose--very crisp and hoppy with some sweet fruit notes as well. Hops are omnipresent in the taste, muted at the start by soft fruitiness and by some dryness at the end. A bit oily in the mouth but a good mouthfeel nonetheless and eminently drinkable."
"Big head, dark copper color, hop/fruity cherry smell, and a great spicy hop taste. The 6.8% alcohol gives a nice kick without any alcohol aftertaste. This is a great beer that is moving to the top of my list."
"The beer when poured exhibited a generous lasting head. The aroma was hoppy with a sweet background. The predominant characteristic is the hop bitterness and flavor. This is soon followed by a background maltiness that serves as a perfect backdrop for the main character, the hop. The beer was a pleasure to drink being so well balanced."
"Sierra Nevada 2002 Celebration Ale is a real hops treat for sure."
"Pours a nice copper/reddish color with a nice off white head. As soon as you put your nose to the glass you get hit with the hops then a small hint of fruit and malt. Its a nice aroma! Mixed with a smooth mouth feel and a pleasant after taste of hops. A very enjoyable seasonal beer. Enjoy!"
"Happy Drinking!"
"Wow! This is an exceptional beer! Reminds me of a hoppier, stronger version of Liberty Ale (one of my absolute favorites). If you don't like a beer that's extremely ""hopped-up", avoid this. Otherwise, seek it out! Very smooth, easy to drink (had to slow myself down!). Pours a very large head, impressive lace. I finally found this a couple of towns away. I'll be returning on payday to buy a case!!"
"Pours a very clear amber/copper color with a large off-white head. Looks very appealing! The smell is a very pungent grapefruit aroma with citrusy hops well pronounced. The taste is a reflection of the aromas and includes a very bold dry hoppy citrus including strong grapefruit notes. Whew! This medium bodied brew is one that will ""wow"" you and drinkability is not quite as high as like-ability...but I can say ""I Love It!"". Pineywoodsrooter brought this up from Houston and shared a few bottles of it with me -thanks again! Cheers!"
"Merry Xmas and Happy 'Hop-Head' New Year."
"Clear red-amber body, with a nice cream-colored head. Head is rather short-lived, but a bit of lace stays atop the brew and clings to the side of the glass. Grapefruit citrus and a solid presence of the deep pine forest dominate the smell. A bit of caramel malt noticeable as well. Rich, wonderfully hoppy and bitter flavor - but not overwhelming, by any means. The citrus flavor dominates most of the way, but the herbal, piney taste takes over in the finish. Nice mellow caramel malt backs up this excellent IPA. Incredibly smooth brew, went very well with a nice rare sirloin."
"This ale pours a beautiful rust, honey, orange color with a creamy off-white head. Scents of pine, spicy hops, and grapefruit dominate. The taste is of spicy, ""gritty"" hops with notes of caramel, apple and citrus, especially grapefruit. A buttery mouthfeel and backnotes of nut, wood, allspice?, nutmeg? The richer, spicier ""holiday"" taste elements are all beautifully tamed and balanced with bitter hops in what is essentially an IPA. Probably the ultimate hophead holiday beer."
"Clean, hoppy aroma. Taste is solidly cascades, but toned down just a bit from the standard pale ale. A touch of carmel malt flavor, and very drinkable. There's a hint of bitterness in the finish, but overall, well-balanced and very drinkable."
"426"
"Very good stuff...stands with Sasquatch as my fav SN product."
"The malt is definately a side note. The main feature is the hops. I highly recommend this warmer for a nice, red meat dinner."
"Mahogany/deep ruby red appearance with a small fine white head. Big aromas of piney hops with some toasty malts as well. Medium carbonation; fairly big body. Taste of piney, citrusy Cascade hops with some grapefruity character, offset to some extent by a sweet caramel/brown sugar malty profile, particularly as the brew warms. A bit unbalanced towards the hop end for my taste, especially for a winter seasonal, but undoubtedly worth a try."
"Not balanced at all, but it is damn tastey. At once I was not fond of high hop brews, but this one has changed my mind. And you have to love the scene on the bottle!"
"My expectations were a bit high for this beer. The hop blend is ok. The 2001 was better. This one is lacking in maturity. The initial taste is very good. However the second half as it rolls past the palate is not a clean finish and is rough. Almost a bit of a ugh factor. Reminds me of a more mature version of the Arogant Bastard. Nice Seasonal - but needs more seasoning."
"Reviewed again after a comparison to some of the other hophead westcoast beers and it does not hold up as well."
"Deep amber, thick head is pockmarked. Nose is huge. Floral, citic hops over a crip toasty malt. Flavor: Grapefruit and pine sap hops, tingly, Crisp maltiness. Butter and flower nectar. Damn good. Much better than the regular Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"I like everything about this ale. Big nose, big head that lasts with ample lacing. Spicy taste followed by a smooth, very drinkable body, not overly carbonated. Of course the traditional big hoppy finish that is the Sierra trademark. One of my favorite seasonals."
"This brew is ever so smooth. Hoppiness and maltiness blends well and hits at the same time. Spice is mild, I could have used maybe a little more to give me some additional holiday cheer, but the 6.8% ABV warmed me nicely. An excellent seasonal!"
"Something like this reminds me why IPA/heavy-hops were my first love. The power and presence of the hops head-off a perfect drinkability score as this brew is not one for easy/lazy drinking. The brew requires your attention. Snatch this brew up before the seasnos change. Enjoy, repeat! Cheers!"
"Exactly like what you would expect for an IPA from Sierra Nevada. An excellent offering each winter, this one pours a glowing copper color with a very frothy head that lasts infinitely. Aroma is mainly of citric, piney hops. Taste is similar, with a huge hoppy profile that's balanced quite well with a thorough malt character. Mouthfeel is pretty good, maybe a little carbonated. For an ale of 6.8% ABV, I find this to be an easy drinker for sure. I, too, am all for this as a year-round offering from SN. There's always something to celebrate, right?"
"This is my first year trying this brew and I must say that I'm quite impressed. It's like their fantastic Pale Ale, but taken to the next level. I'll look forward to this next year..."
"The label's quaint scene of a snow-covered cabin works well in announcing the themes of winter and Celebration, reflecting feelings of warmth, safety and comfort. The beer pours amber, with a creamy white head. A sharp nose, with strong elements of citrus, suggests an impending hops explosion. Hops, hops and more hops. Even at the finish a bitter hops flavor lingers, as elements of grapefruit and pine recede, but in a way that is inviting, rather than overwhelming. With a full mouthfeel and nice carbonation, this is a big beer, appropriate for a big and festive holiday season."
"Amber in appearance. The aroma is wonderful smells of citrusy hops with a slight piney smell. Well, I'm not reporting anything different from other reviewers when I describe the taste as hoppy. I would agree that it is more a taste of hops without a ton of bitterness. Not as bitter as other IPA's I've had. I did get a very subtle orange taste on a few sips. I got this one in the store from the refrigerator plus the 2002 on the label so at least it wasn't sitting out for a while. A pretty good brew but I guess I'm a little puzzled by all the fuss. Maybe it is narrow mindedness on my part but it also doesn't match what I was expecting out a winter offering. I don't penalize the beer for that."
"An awesome beer, I can see why it is so highly rated, must get more before it dissapears from the stores."
"It poured yellow-amber and very clear, but seemed to get a little cloudy as it warmed in my glass. The head seemed coarse, with large-ish bubbles rather than a smooth white foam. All of that is secondary to the aroma. Hops. Lots of 'em. Heavy duty pine and citrus aroma slaps you in the face. The hops are also very evident in the flavor, but the the beer is more hop-flavor than just bitter. Not what I expected from a holiday brew, but overall it is an enjoyable beer."
"Poured copper in color with an off-white head. Bubbles seen rising through the semi-cloudy liquid. Aroma consisted of hops and sweet fruit. Good carbonation hits the tongue right away followed by the a strong hopiness of this full-bodied brew. A bit of malt in there too and a very bitter, salty finish . A great beer for those who love hops. It also made me realize that not all winter seasonals have to be heavily spiced and sweet."
"Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale: Very hoppy aroma, very little spice. Fairly surprising for a holiday beer. Reddish brown color, with a slightly off-white head. The aroma and taste is very much, too much, hops. In fact, but for a slight citrus taste at the end, its hardly a holiday beer at all. Very Very nice beer, not much of a holiday beer though."
"Great, and overrated. Hazy reddish gold with huge dense head. Aroma is the weak point; smells like spoiled milk to me. Tart, piney hops are all you need to know here. Like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale except bigger. Malt character is solid but almost beside the point. Good for sitting by the fire on Christmas Eve with friends and family and getting comfortably smashed. A fine beer, flawed, whose esteem has risen largely because of limited availability."
"Sierra really works the Cascades well with this beer."
"Pours dark copper color, foamy head, citrus hoppy aroma. Medium-Full bodied and unfilterd, thick head leaves a nice lace in the glass. Very hoppy with a good malt backbone, balanced creamy soft mouthfeel, I love this IPA."
"7/4/03: I stocked up on '02 Celebration and it's been a real pleasure to see how it ages. The brash, overt hoppiness of new SN Celebration is still evident but has settled down and is now wonderfully balanced with the malt. I continue to be impressed with this brew."
"Yummy, I've got to make sure that I get some more of this stuff before it is all gone for the year. Beautiful copper beer with a big white sticky head and great acing and ringing down the glass. Nice piney and citrusy/floral hop aromas dominate. Quick hop bite right at the start of the brew before it turns into some nice mellow malt through the middle before the fruity hoppy flavors take over and the beer eventually finishes with a nice lingering hop bitterness. Smooth and tangy with a decently heavy body that is appropriate for the season. I'm tempted to run out and buy more of this right now. I'm definitely going to put some of it away so that I can enjoy it as the year goes by."
"Pours a golden amber with a nice white fluffy head. The smell is hops all the way. Well balanced beer that has that warming affect as you drink more. Lots of little bubbles that dance in your mouth. I can't find one part of this beer that stands out too much or over powers another flavor. My two favorite parts are the smell and the aftertaste. I will have to get more of this."
"If you've never had an aged Celebration, I can tell you that's it's a completely different beer. The only way this beer could possibly improve is by aging it another year or so."
"After hearing so many people rave about this beer, I was finally able to get my hands on a 6-pack, and I have to say that if you like hops, you will enjoy this brew.  It pours a medium amber color with a massive creamy head.  The strong scent of hops struck me as I was pouring the beer.  Once in the glass, some fruit scents were notably mixed with the hops.  The taste is a bit sweet and spicy with a strong hop blast on the back of the tongue.  A very nice beer for the winter season!"
"Something about the bottle with the red cap just reminds me of the holidays."
"sampled 11/26/03"
"Dark orange, light amber in color with a thin head.  The aroma is of delicate spices.  Big whiffs of cascade hops, but these are balanced out by a nice orange citrus which makes itself known as the beer warms.  Flavor is spicy and once again the hops are very noticeable up front.  Mid-palate is dominated by a nutmeggy malt sweetness and a mild alcohol warming, folllowed by a significant hop bitterness.  Dry finish with a good spice aftertaste.  Very drinkable indeed!"
"I finally was able to find this SN beer by me. I've been looking forward to the season and the beer for some time to see if it lived up to the hype. I'm sad to say, IMVHO, that it did not. Don't get me wrong, it was quite a good beer. I am definately seeking this one out in the future. I'm just not going to set up a shrine in its honor. My biggest problem was with the mouthfeel. In terms of style, the mouthfeel was flawless. However, since it is packaged as a winter brew I feel it falls short of the mark. Two things could be done to correct this. The first is give it a finer carbonation. The second is increase the final gravity. IMO, the carbonation is too coarse, or the body a bit too thin, for a ""winter warmer""."
"Slightly hazy dark orange color, plenty of head that holds rocky shapes and laces well. Bright spicy orange aromas, hops influenced. This baby is hopped like a maniac, the agreeable malt has slight nutmeg qualities but seems overrun early and often by the hops all the way to the aftertaste. Just too unbalanced for my expectations of a winter brew (unless X-mas in California means IPA), lots of similarities to some other up and coming juicy American IPAs. But, a cool addition to your arsenal of winter brews, I can certainly be in the mood for this as there are definite times I crave hops. Much more gutsy than SN Pale...maybe they should run this all year."
"addendum: market found 10 cases hidden, so its on sale. Seems extra good compared to the lagers I've had lately"
"the beer itself is incredibly smooth and rich. it has a wonderful array of sweet malts that are followed by a delicious hops finish. wonderful drinker for fall and winter. there is a lot going on with this beer, and i love all of it"
"Copper hue w/ good clarity. Persistant ivory white head leaves Belgian lace. An assertive, pungent combination of a citrusy cascade and piney hops hit the nose immediately, then are ceded by medium caramel and hints of rich, pleasant butterscotch. Although the hop bitterness is quite assertive, the rich malt character isn't overshadowed, and toasty malt and well integrated, deep caramel provide a firm malt backbone to support the hops. Hop flavor mirrors the hop nose, and is both citrusy and piney, but when coupled with malt sweetness, could be perceived as sweetly spruce like. Moderately bodied, w/ a dextrinous, full mouthfeel. Fruity esters, although subdued, emerge late and provide additional complexity. Finishes w/ a delectable lingering combination of crisp hop bitterness and mild caramel sweetness. Tongue coating bready grain is perceptible upon exhaling. This years Celebration (2002) retains the hop profile of previous years, but the malt profile seems to possess greater depth and richness. Simply put, it's one of the greatest American IPAs around. Who needs spices in a winter brew, when spicy aromatics can be acheived with hops? It's a beautiful beer, especially when consumed at cellar temps or above."
"Just picked up the first 2002 six pack of this sold by my local specialty grocery store, and with great anticipation, I cracked one open.  Huge frothy head over an amber-brown brew.  Head retains very well and leaves lace as the glass empties.  Powerful hop aroma, mostly citrus, a bit spicy.  Hints of sweet caramel malt.  Wonderful!  On the palate, bitter and spicy hops take the lead with malt struggling behind in the beginning, but showing itself more as more is consumed.  Deeper in, more complex hop character comes through showing the variety used in hopping this beer.  Citrus, oil, and fruit are all present.  Malt backs all of this up very well with grain and caramel sweetness.  Spicy and grain dry finish.  This isn't what I would normally expect from a winter brew, but surprisingly, it fits with the season very well.  The spicy hop character gives it that winter holiday feel.  This is what I want to drink with Thanksgiving dinner.  Insanely drinkable for a winter brew as well.  This is an exceptional ale that goes beyond even high expectations, the perfect companion all through the winter!"
"First of all I was not overly impressed with this beer. It poured a golden brown and had no foam. The aroma had a faint floral smell and that was it. The bitterness of this beer over powered my palate and I couldn't detect any outstanding flavor in this beer. Tried it again and raised my rating by .5. I didn't get it so cold this time. Warmer is better!"
"It's here:  2002 edition.  It pours a pretty golden-red with a somewhat bubbly off-white head.  The trademark Sierra hops are definitely in there, but the smell isn't by any means overwhelming.  In fact, the hops seem almost subtle for an SN beer.  Notes of citrus abound, with a definite undercurrent of yeasty/bready flavors.  The mouthfeel is surprisingly light and almost fizzy on the tongue.  Despite its 6.8% abv and a definite warming quality, it doesn't want to go down like a sipping beer.  I'm going to have a hard time keeping away from the remainder of the six-pack.  Welcome winter!"
"This is a light chestnut colored beer that has a slight reddish hue and amber highlights.  It pours with a nice, solid head that really covers the glass with lace and exhibits excellent head retention.  The aroma is of malt and floral hops, with a hint of spices.  The front end of the taste is sweetness with a strong hop finish.  The hops seem to be very much in keeping with Sierrs Nevada's style.  It has a very smooth mouthfeel, and drinks quite easily.  I feel fortunate to have found and enjoyed this beer."
"Compared this to an Anchor Special Ale at the same time.  This won though the Anchor was wonderful as well.  Sensational mouthfeel:  very silky, smooth, and luxurious tasting (the mouthfeel of this beer is like the ride of a Mercedes).  Leaves attractive lace on glass and maintains a slightly foamy top through the whole beer.  Alluring color of Mahogany amber and cloudy.  Taste is herb and spice filled.  Strong hops, bitter but not all that overpowering.  Very complex.  Can't picture drinking more than two of these though.  Very enjoyable beer and will be awaiting this years version."
"Update: 03/13/05 Linear Tasting: Tasted 01, 02, 03 and 04 with much the same results - drink fresh!! Older versions did not go bad but hops were subdued to the point of having the Celebration Ale turn into a light English Barleywine... If that's what you like just buy a good BW instead of bothering with aging."
"Incredibly great color with an enticing aroma.  Malt flavors are quite noticeable dominated mostly by nuts and some caramel.  Hops also show themselves through some nice citrus undertones.  The alcohol gives the beer a nice warming property and does not detract from the other flavors.  Very interesting and complex brew that deserves several sessions."
"I picked this up one day instead of the usual SN Pale Ale because I hadn't seen it before. I was a bit confused because the label said it was 1999 Celebration Ale, which seems kinda old to be on the shelf. I got it anyways and it turned out to be alright. It has a deep copperish-brown color with a lot of cloudiness. I love the hops that SN uses because it brings out such great aromas. This one even seemed to have some fruity aromas. This taste was good, hoppy and bitter. The drinkability was less than I had initially expected but defeneitly but would make a great brew to drink for the holiday season."
"One of the things that make the long, cold, and wet winters here more enjoyable is Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. I decided to stash a bottle last winter and thought about comparing the 2001 with the 2002 version. Sadly to say it won't happen this year since I'm drinking the 2001 version tonight. It's amazing how well this beer is made. The amber color invites you to consume it's tasty contents, and once you drink it, you are hooked. It's a full flavored beer that does more than its share to keep you warm, even on the coldest of all nights. Also, at 6.8% ABV, it's not something to be played with. Take your time to enjoy the wonderful, malty taste. You'll even notice how much more the flavors stand out when the beer grows to room temperature. With that said, I suspect I'll see the 2002 version on my store shelves in about 3 months and enjoy winter with the best beer of the season."
"Pours a copper/orange color with a steady white head,A multitude of hop flavors, enough malt to hold it together plus various spices,  One of the reasons I look forward to winter.  This was the first holiday brew I have ever sampled, and it pretty much got be back into drinking quality beers."
"Typical strong offering from Sierra Nevada."
"Sierra Nevada has done it again with this brew.  I was a little skeptical when it was recomended to me by Shangy's (my beer store listed on this site).  It is clean and refreshing with a mild aroma of hops.  The head is not all too thick and laces nicely by the end of the glass.  This is a nice one if you can get your hands on it."
"This is a very good beer....the color is very appealing and it has very good taste.  The spices were a little to much for my liking but not enough to give this brew anything but a good rating.............CHEERS"
"2002 Version sampled 11/22/03 Smoother more mellow flavors. Lots of hops still, but the malt undertone is much more noticable.Oily resin flavors match with a hint of slick chocolate flavors. Slightly oily. Very Smooth, rich and mellow. Not as much fresh hop sticky, resin bitterness."
"Notes from 2000: Another winner from S.N. Great fresh hop nose when poured into the glass. Wonderful head on this too. Be prepared for a blast of hops on the palate. A loooooonnnnnggggg hoppy finish on this one makes it a world classic, widely copied, look for it!"
"Excellent citric?grapefruit notes in aroma. Great hop nose. Nice frothy white head. Beautiful copper color. Nice bite present in this brew. A very good bitterness present. Huge rind characteristics. Very warming. Excellent IPA . Taste good even on the burp."
"The first nationally available monster of an IPA. I am glad it is seasonal. Keeps me from taking it for granted."
"What a treat. It looks terrific in a glass, with a subtle reddish hue. The taste is piney with hints of grapefruit and a touch of spice, though it's better after it's warmed a bit. I've got one left from this season, so I want to wait until the last possible traces of winter before I pop it open. Alas, this has become one of my favorite holiday traditions."
"Orange-amber color, good head with decent lace. Hops, citrus, pine, alcohol aroma. Bitter, hoppy, citrus, pine flavor.  Bitter front, med-full body with a high hops middle and a bitter-sweet dry finish.  Lingering grapefruit rind and spice aftertaste.  IMHO; more malt for better balance and more spice for more flavor.  Better character when allowed to warm. Tried it at ice-cold temp, way too bitter. This is a good beer, but it is too bitter and hoppy for my taste."
"A very hoppy brew; spice hints abound.  Very smooth, and easy to drink.  Thank god for Sierra Nevada."
"Very nice beer overall, but especially good for a winter warmer.  Good steady head, nice color.  There is definitely the flavor of grapefruit in the taste, but I guess I like it.  It might be hard to drink more than a couple of these."
"Hops all the way.  Smooth and tasty, with a creamy taste that makes this beer richer than their ales.  Not heavy, but hearty."
"A fantastic winter beer. Pours smooth to a nice dark brown, almost ruby color with a decent head. Malt is prevelent on the sip and initial mouthfeel, but quickly gives way to a big dose of hops on the finish. A winter warmer sure to please, but in essence, this is a IPA, not really a specialty beer other than the time of year it is released. The log cabin picture on the label beckons you on a cold, fall or winter day. This brewery, overall, brews some of the best, widely available beer in the U.S."
"Many invading flavors here, a bit fruity, a bit flowery, a bit of tarty citrus, and a good kick of hops.  It does have a malt edge, but it's the hops that comes through the strongest.  Smells like fresh flowers and berries and leaf hops, but not quite as potent as I would really like(big deal huh?).  There is a fine sediment floating throughout the glass(gotta love the sediment). Most importantly, this brew is down right delicious..."
"Beautiful orange-amber color, intensely fresh hop aroma, Malt stands it ground but the hops edges it out. The flavor of hops roll across the tongue with a pleasant long lasting bitter aftertaste.Surprisingly drinkable. A classic I look forward to every year."
"Notes: At 6.8% this is one hell of a Winter seasonal! Warms the body and soul. A brew for hop heads too. One of the best Winter Seasonals that I have ever had, and one of the best Strong Ales. Drink with caution as this brew will kick your ass."
"Orangish, red brew with light tan head that laces down the side of the glass. Hops explodes on the palate followed by toasted malts with a citric dry finish. Perfect beer to drink with a holiday meal. Hopheads will love this monster IPA."
"Notes from 2000: If this is November, then Celebration Ale must be on the shelves. It's like biting into a raw hop leaf. Would I be too out of line to describe Celebration as a world-class IPA to go with SN's world-class pale ale?"
"Notes from 2000: Even 6 months later, I remember this as fruity and hoppy. How long to Christmas?"
"Notes from 2000: This lovely brew is got to be top ten material. Won't be long now for this year's supply!"
"This is why I drink beer.  All year long is merely a warm-up for the day when SN Celebration hits the shelf.  Hops, Hops, Hops, accompanied by just the right amount of malt.  Onslaught of flavor.  Awesome."
"This is a good winter / Stong ale. Real big fresh hop flavor to it. Enough malt to back it up. Nice hop/spice aroma."
