"Overall: If like most of us that started with the BMC adjuncts, but has a preferred taste for PBR and its fruity sweetness, you will enjoy this with its ""less than insta-hangover"" quality. I can see where this was a hit after decades with Bud and Miller. Todays standards, it doesn't seem high quality or over the top. But I can see this as an American style that screams ""I'M FUCKING PATRIOTIC AND THIS BEER SAYS 'MURICA!"". Though, it's not a Sam Adams."

"poured into a tulip pint glass from a bottle that was born on November 11, 2014. salty that i wanted this beer but my local store only had it from Nov2014. would like to get this within 60 days of brewing though."

"A good well balanced beer with hops and malts"
"Overall: According to the blurb, this was apparently introduced in 1975 which pretty much debunks the myth that craft beer in the US is a 'new' thing. This was the second Cascade-based beer I'd had in this session (Saltaire Cascade being the other) and the Anchor pretty much blew the Saltaire brew away in terms of both smell and flavour. There are undoubtedly better IPAs out there, but if you're looking for a toe in the door of the American IPA style then this is as good a place to start as any."

"Overall: Very impressive that this beer is now 40 years old.  Many brand-new American IPAs created in the past decade can't touch this"
""
""
""

"Beautiful dark golden ale with a thick creamy head and good retention.  Mild hop aroma and bitterness with a small carbonation bite."

"DATE TASTED: January 16, 2015... GLASSWARE: Kisatsky Tavern pint ... OCCASION: a good week done... APPEARANCE: a storm of effervescent bubbles whirl violently below an absolute dreamy cloud of thick white head; hazy orange amber in color; lacing is ribbed and substantial... AROMA: sharp orange peel; some sugarlike cookie, vanilla, grapefruit and spring flowers... PALATE: creamy at the lips; slight pings of sourness at the teeth; effervescent but swift to the throat; light and mega-sessionable ...TASTE: citric flavors of grapefruit and lilac, orange and vanilla make this already a winner; the malt settles nicely, providing balance...OVERALL: why so long to revisit this most perfect example of the genre--as refreshing and flavorful as a pale ale can be..."
"Extreme lack of flavor.  No finish"
""
""
""
""
""
"Maybe this is not my cup of tea but it is just a bitter beer.  Not enough hops to be an IPA.  Not enough malt and character to be a good brown."
""
""
"By the way I have never considered this beer an IPA - more of a pale ale IMO."

"Overall- a very fine IPA. The whole hops give it a bright piney character. Often the bitterness in IPAs overshadow the taste- not this beer. It's pleasant to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a beautiful golden Amber with a quarter finger head that is sticky and lingers for several minutes. Aroma is hoppy, floral, fresh cut grass. Mouthfeel is the best part of this beer. So creamy and wonderful. Front end is sour, then bitter hops. Very clean and drinkable. A great example of its type. Solid ale. Would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cross between a straw yellow and orange and clear liquid. Fingernail length head dissipates into a thin white lace on the rim of the glass. Aroma is citric, honey, malty sweet and chocolate. Taste is malty sweet with slight hop and bready aftertaste. Taste also has hints of citrus flavors such as orange rind and lemony flavors. Nice carbonation, not so high, but still tickles the tongue. Low to medium body and slightly syrupy and viscous towards the end. Anchor Brewing Company is one of my favorite breweries. They do not disappoint with this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours light amber with a white head, it's a light bodied beer with a moderate amount of carbonation. Smell is earthy and floral hops and caramel maltiness. Not very bitter to the taste, there's some citrus hops and sweet and pale malts. This beer finds a nice balance, but is not at all unique, although it isn't trying to be."

"i dont care what anyone says about anchor, they still make some wonderful beers, and liberty ale is at the head of that list, with its rich red malt base, glowing amber in the glass, and its huge hop palate, shocking to the masses no doubt when it was released, but not fitting rightly into the ipa category range. i like the fusion here, its got an english type ale yeast that imparts a lot of flavor, along with great dryness of feel, but its also hopped like a west coast ipa, a cool blend of traditions and entirely its own. i like the amber malt base, it isnt the least bit sweet, but its a different launching point than we usually see for the cascade hops, which are everything they usually are, bold and bitter, fresh and dramatic. the grain does balance that all the way through, and the english yeast is a great touch. carbonation is soft and not aggressive, but it is prominent and more than enough. the body is medium but filling as it warms, and the finish is long and bitter and distinct to this particular beer, ipa may have evolved beyond this in some ways, or at least the american beer geeks palate has, but this stands as a baseline for what good american hoppy beer should taste like, and it always makes me happy to go back to this one. a staple in the american craft scene for me, for some reason always better on draft."

"o: A good dinner beer or summer sipper with ok flavor but perhaps relatively unremarkable now given the nature and amount of competition.  A little reminiscent of a mild Belgian golden ale because of the initial fruitiness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rating: A-"
""
"Complex and balanced, tasty and refreshing. The bitterness in particular is prominent but avoids the grassy, acidic quality so often imparted by dry hopping. The hop qualities are also well supported by the clearly present malt."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 14B). Bottle 355 ml - Batch unknown. AROMA: floral and citrusy hop and esters aromas reminescent of grapes, oranges and some piny and resinous character. some sweet malt background. APPEARANCE: medium gold color and clear. nice moussy head of a slight ivory colour that persists. TASTE: citrusy and piny flavours more faint than the aromas. sweet malt background. medium-high bitterness that lingers into a dry finish. PALATE: medium-light body with medium-low carbonation. OVERALL: a nice APA that promisses in the aromas but doesnt deliver much in the flavours."

"Overall:  This is a good beer.  Nice flavors of toasted malt, black pepper, coriander, caramel-like sweetness all nicely balanced with some piney, hoppy, bitterness.  While I like Anchor’s Steam beer the best of the offerings I’ve had from Anchor, I like this one quite a bit too.  Recommende"

"Overall- Another great brew from Anchor Brewing.  Cannot go wrong trying this one."
""
""
"o: liberty ale is nothing like the ultra citrusy/tropical fruit explosion modern IPAs, but this is still a very lovable ale.  cascade hops are quite delicious"
""
""
"It's interesting to me that Liberty has such a higher rating than Anchor IPA. I don't think a lot of people realize Liberty is listed as an American IPA. However, based on the ratings I guess people understand the difference between these two. Liberty being a recipe from the 70s the light hop profile is understandable. This is an IPA when you're looking for something more subtle. Anchor IPA is much more akin to what modern western IPAs have evolved into. It tastes a lot like Torpedo. I guess I get the love for Liberty, it's like Steam was hopped a bit. But I still don't understand the non love for Anchor IPA, sure the market is saturated but it's good. Whatever."

"Pours a soft yellow with a twinge of orange,  Small flecks of sediment are now swirling in my Sierra Nevada Hop Tulip.  Poured from a bottle aromas of leather, cedar, and lemony citrus waft up to my nose.   Nice and natural head float on the beer and cling to the side of the beer.  Tastes  of lemon zest, and light caramel are followed by a creamy yeasty flavor with a carbonation that is neither  to much nor to little, but just right.  I guess this time it was just the beer I was looking for,"
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Not what I'm used to in a WC IPA, but I still appreciate what Anchor brewing has done with this beer.  Good.  4.1/5"
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and pretty enjoyable though I wonder how much better this would be fresh on the west coast vs. on the east coast (there is a slight hint of fading hops in my opinion). Could put down a couple of these though with the 5.9% ABV it is probably a touch strong for a session beer. Alcohol is well hidden."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A very good example of an AIPA, one that a non-hop head can easily tolerate. Well balanced, well done b y Anchor, my faith in this brewery is restored. I really enjoyed this beer. Condor recommended and approved."

"A classic beer from Anchor brewing. Pours with a thick sudsy foam that leaves a nice foam lacing clinging to the side of the glass. A light amber in color with sweet hops and sweet malts on the nose. Taste of light caramel and biting bittering hops with an acidic yet somewhat creamy taste. Lot's of hop bitterness on the aftertaste, more caramel sweet notes as it warms. A very good ipa style beer, and an excellent session beer for the hop head. It is a treasure for it's longevity in the brewing world from a solid brewery that still makes steam beer as well as a multitude of other styles. Cheers."

""
""
""

""

"Has a sweet smell that is quickly coupled with a sweet taste. While not particularly a fan of Anchor's steam processing - I feel like I can taste the steam with every sip of their flagship beer - this one is a great alternative."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a nice beer. It doesn't try to do too much, and it is clearly well-crafted, however it can leave the seeker of bigger beers wanting something more. Good balance, light overall flavor and feel. It definitely belongs in San Francisco, where it can go down easy in sun, fog, rain, or everything in-between."
""

"Food match: This brew is right in the sweet spot for a curry, in fact I just polished up a vege Korma before beginning this review, it really hit the spot."

"A real gem of an American beer. If you love or once loved Anchor Steam, then you've got to track down Anchor Liberty."

"Overall - I would consider more an APA than an IPA but it is a great beer"
""
"33 cl bottle (bb 11 2015) into a tulip. Clear golden, tiny head, little lacing. Fresh smell has malts and fruity hops with a hint of grass. Crisp malty taste is followed by fruity hops, dry fruity aftertaste with mild bitterness. Medium body, pleasant smooth carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. Overall a fresh and pleasant ale. Would have again."

"Overall: love how Anchor balances their beers. This is a perfect balance of light hops with solid malt base. Perfection in beer! Nice to know that an IPA does not have to be in your face over the top hops."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Definitely on the English side of things. This one reminds me of the SouthHampton IPA I had a while ago. Although not great in todays craft world, I reckon this was mind blowing back in 1975. Something I will consider grabbing again if Im in the mood for a english style pale ale/IPA. In fact, having had their porter as well, I think Anchor does English style beers justice. The price is right, too."

"Pleasantly surprised. Wasn't expected exactly what I received, but it was good. A little grassy but ok with a hint of citrus to balance it. A well done ale that balances itself well and leaves a good taste in the mouth. Anchor brewing has always pleased me. Only point I would make is that with a little more attention, they could take all of their beers to the world class level or pretty darn close. Nice !!!"

"Overall - a bit disappointed since there wasn't more harmony between the nose and the taste of this beer but in all it was quite tasty and worth trying again."
""
"O - Although listed as an IPA, I would consider this an IPA for people who really don't like IPA's. It is a good beer that I will have again, but it just doesn't seem to have the hop profile that I expect in an IPA."

"Flavor: more balanced than the aroma. The hops are still dominant with the citrus and pine leading the way but the sweetness of the malt and the yeasty backbone even this beer out nicely. Overall: Liberty Ale is a fine representation of the style."

"Liberty poured a slightly hazy yellow/gold colour, with plenty of fine, fast rising bubbles visible despite the haze. Pouring produced about 1/2"" of white head which lasted for about 2 minutes, leaving some modest spotting and lacing down the glass. The beer's aroma was primarily of grapefruit, with some other unidentified tropical fruits present...a bit subdued but nice all the same. Its taste was again dominated by the grapefruit, but with an increasingly noticeable orange flavour as the beer warmed...much more enjoyable through the second half of the bottle with a better balance between the bitterness of the grapefruit and sweetness of the orange. Liberty had a dry, bitter finish and the bitter grapefruit lingered for several seconds as an aftertaste. The carbonation was perhaps a bit prickly in the back of the throat to begin with, but mellowed as the beer warmed. I would describe Liberty as light bodied, and at $2.00 per 355 ml is quite reasonably priced. A refreshing beer that I would go to again, but next time I'll let is sit for 10-15 minutes after I take it out of the fridge."

"O - Though it might be light in hops for the more modern APA and IPA standards, one should take in consideration what it meant when it was released in 1975. It's a really nice beer that I would (and will) gladly drink again in the future."

"I have had this one a few times now and it seems more yeasty than hoppy every single time. The hops are certainly respectable for an IPA but clash just a bit with the yeast."

"O: Tasty brew and an easy drinker. Definitely has that rustic old-school brewery taste. I'm an American IPA lover but this is a nice low key alternative with an interesting flavor profile and old-school feel."
""
"O: This is the grandfather of the modern IPA. It is simple in construction but is very well balanced and true to style.Was first brewed in 1975 to commemorate the bicentennial. Definitely a must try for any hop enthusiast. Also a great beer for anyone new to IPA who wants to try one that won't knock their head off. It's not my favorite AIPA but it is the first, the traditional one, the oldest, very simple and well built."

"Poured from a 355 ml bottle into a pint glass. An American IPA from well before the era when American IPAs became cool, this beer is a light flaxen amber color, just shy of bronze, with a decent quantity of off-white head. Releases a bright, fizzy hops-forward aroma of yellow grapefruit and lemon citrus rind, currant leaf, and clean grainy malts. Palate is quite bitter, perhaps more than expected on the basis of the preconceived notion that a brew predating the current era of hop bombs must be quite mellow, with plenty of bright green grass and lemon hop flavors. Indeed, this may be one of the most lemony brews I've had in terms of this particular flavor standing out ... There's some grapefruit and tangerine as well, white pepper, and ample Cascade hop character. The malts put in an appearance as well, some toasted caramel and even a little sultana fruit in what is otherwise a pretty dry and bitter (but not coarse) finish. Carbonation is assertive but this works well with the overall intent, which is to showcase green hop flavors without a lot of background sweetness. Obviously a classic brew and any IPA hardcore should try this at least once, if for no other reason than the historical context it provides. My view is that this beer is worth a taste on the basis of its own merits, though. Fits somewhere between pale ales and modern West Coast IPAs."
""
""
""
""

""
"Pours a nice golden color with a good 1+-finger slightly off-white foamy head. Doesn't last too long but does leave lots of lacing when sipped that stays on the glass. Perfect carbonation. The aroma is of some sweet grains with a hint of citrus. The taste was about the same and even better even with just a slight 'hoppy' finish BUT doesn't last long at all. Very pleasing. Very drinkable for being a ""American I.P.A."" as I am not a I.P.A. fan. An exception for sure!"

"overall; more drinkable then an IPA. a bit too much dryness and flavor could be a but stronger, but its fairly unique in its mild but solid flavor and its drinkability, would buy again when I'm in the mood for an american ale but not an IPA"
"O- Just on the verge of great. A very good IPA, to be sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice pale ale, a pleasant change from the IPAs I have been having lately, would have thought a bit more of a hoppy taste would come through. However noting that this beer has travelled far to get to me (date not checked). Definitely a good session beer"

"Poured into a pint glass, nice head developed, white in color, with mild retention and lacing. Appearance was a clear, golden color. Aroma had notes of citrus and malt with light spice notes. Tasted of mild hop and citrus. Medium mouthfeel with a dry aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed this beer. I love how all the Anchor beers I've tried have the same base fruity flavor and smell. I don't think I would call this an IPA, but it was still pretty good. I'll probably have this from time to time."

"This is the first time I have started tracking my beers on BA. I typically do it on untappd."
""
"O - This offering is decent enough. It is very drinkable, but I can name about ten IPAs I'd rather have."
"This beer is a great change-up for a man inundated with West Coast IPAs. The taste is almost as amazing as the aromatic smell."
""
""
""
""
"I find this beer vastly superior to so many west-coast IPA's, partly because it is better balanced and more complex than most. I feel that so many California brewers think that if you add enough hops, the drinkers will come. Apparently, they are right."
""
""
"O-I'm not sure this is a true-to-style American IPA, or maybe I've just gotten used to the bitter hop-bombs that dominate the style now, but this is a good, drinkable beer, nonetheless. The most interesting thing is the almost-Belgian like yeast, which is semi-sweet and quite doughy. The yeast flavor pairs well the lemon zest and orange peel flavors in this beer. This would be a great summer drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This feels restrained in all the right places. It's a reminder that this was one of the first 'Merican-made IPAs, and still has a significant English influence to it. Even in this era of EXTREEEME and MOAR HOPZ, I'd take this over many other modern IPAs any day."
""
"I can't say enough about this beer. I finally tried it out today after years of passing it up... it's excellent it's the craft IPA everyone has tried to emulate.It's flat out hop balanced it has the 'bite"" you want, it's the one beer your ""lite"" friend will say wow! Original. i'm having another nite! nite!"
""
""
"a perfect single-hop brew that gives you some great Cascade hops for the standard in floral/citrus character"
""
""
""
""
"I prefer Liberty Ale over SNPA, but both are amazing. This beer is like a rite of passage for beer enthusiasts...although I know a lot of people tend to overlook this one."

"This beer is not what i was expecting. It has plenty of hop character but I think my favorite part of this beer is how the lightly toasted grain combined with the fresh mint and the honey. The fact that it wasn't smooth as silk made it even better to me. The bitter was strong but not aggressive and I really liked this one. You drink a few of these easily."

"I really like this beer. Anchor beers are usually pretty good, but so far this is my favorite from that brewery, although this is only my 4th beer I've had from them including 2010 holiday, steam, porter, and this one. There's no one aspect that stands out over others; it's just a really good well balanced beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Ps. Really more of an APA rather than an IPA."
""
""
""
"O: First American IPA I've had. The citrus aroma is so prominent that it even remembered me Orval. This is pretty neat. I'm sure I'll have more in a not-so-distant future."
"O- Very nice drink. Good malt flavor balances well with the hop bitterness."
""
""
"O: A solid ale with mild but enjoyable bitterness."
""
""
"Overall - So this is the first California Pale Ale?! In previous reviews, I've been open about my bias towards all beers Anchor. This is yet another great beer from Anchor brewing! This beer is flavorful, complex, balanced, and wonderful. Go get yourself one or six."
"Overall, not what I was expecting from an IPA. I'm a little disappointed, but I'll go easy on the guys at Anchor because of the age of this one."
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely an important beer in the history of West Coast (and hell, American) brewing in developing the widespread style of the IPA today. It is somewhere halfway between a pale ale and an IPA, so it's hard to rate here except for what it is. Decently hopped, slightly dry, and definitely not one you'd want to have sitting around forever. Not my favorite, but I'd imagine this DID blow people's minds a bit when it came out, though!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy straw color with a finger of head that lingered for a bit. The nose is fairly mild – perhaps there is a hint of oranges present. Light malt flavors and some hops, but not much. The finish has a sweet note, but also something that tastes medicine-like. I’m not convinced that this is best categorized as an IPA, but I’m not sure what might be a more accurate designation."

"This is quite easy to drink. The hop bitterness is more subtle than many American IPA's I have had and that makes it that much better. There is a different citrus thing going on the background that adds to the bitterness."
""
""
"Liberty Ale isn't a bad beer by any means, as my scores show, but I do think it's kind of meh (much like Anchor Steam) and somewhat overrated (much like Anchor Steam). Time has really passed this beer by, I think: it's inarguable that back in the day it was quite the thing. You just have a lot of better alternatives out there now."

"A well crafted IPA, has less of a Cascade punch than SNPA but this has a solid earthy profile, a bit grainy and malty with a dry finish. I think it works pretty well, not the most hoppy IPA or flavour intense but it is flavourful and is quite quenching. Worth trying. Flavor is tasty and crisp and session able with a earthy fruity profile."

"It appears a golden color with good head retention. The aroma is belgian-esque with a hoppy and cereal smell. The taste begins with the belgian flavor, a kind of estery citrus perhaps. It is followed by a light and hoppy finish. A well balanced ale as the body remains medium to light. I'd drink six."

"This beer was a bit disappointing. It seemed very unbalanced. The hop notes were all citrus, so much so it tasted almost as if there was a little lemonade in the beer. Very little else in terms of hop character. Bready, overly sweet malty backbone. Poured a gold-amber with a thin white head. good lacing. Smelled of citrus and grain."

"Overall I'll def need to get a fresher bottle of this to revisit it with less than 6 months on it. Held up well"
"This pours a semi-clear, golden yellow color with a fizzy, off-white head. The aroma is very inviting with bold scents of hops and citrus. The flavor is very hoppy but the texture is thinner then I was expecting. I know this generally reviewed pretty highly but I just find the flavor to be a little off for a pale ale but maybe it’s the flavor pine that I’m not as used to. This is one of the few brews that didn’t live up to its high rating for me."

"D - Despite being into craft for a few years now, there's a lot of big name American breweries I haven't had the pleasure to try; the sort of 'entry-level' gateway breweries that get most folks into craft. But the thing is, a lot of these brands don't distribute around my parts, so brews from Sierra Nevada or DFH aren't really in the cards for me, but luckily Anchor brewing is. Last weekend I picked up my first sixer of Steam Beer and was really impressed, so I figured I'd grab Liberty Ale this time. The result? Another solid, tasty offering from a brewery I probably should have familiarized myself with a long time ago. Something tells me I'm going to be seeing a certain porter in my fridge next weekend..."

"Liberty Ale - The bottle says: ""San Francisco's famous Liberty Ale was first brewed on the 18th of April, 1975 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Paul Revere's historic ride. It is virtually handmade by the brewers of Anchor Steam Beer in one of the smalls and most traditional breweries in the world. Liberty Ale is made with the finest barley, fresh, whole hops, top fermenting yeast, pure water, and the simple natural meths which reflect our exceptional respect for the ancient art of brewing. It is ""dry hopped", a classic ale tradition and slowly completes its fermentation in sealed vats in our cellars. This unique process creates Liberty Ale's distinctive bouquet and uncommonly delicate, entirely natural carbonation."""

"Diaphanous apricot with soapy white sheet. Smells herbal hops, green apple, oxidized malts, some metals, some grass. Taste biscuity with some bitterness, a little tea, some white grapefruit spritz and a little artificial pistachio flavor. Medium bodied with hi carb and an off dry finish. Meh, seems like a pretty good English IPA, but a poor American IPA."

"A beautiful beer. Not the freshest bottle, poured a light amber. Subtle floral notes shot up the nose and a lagery tang takes up the rear. Taste is just quite lovely if subdued; clean with a surprisingly bitter finish. Extremely drinkable, it just aches to line your mouth as it does so well. Could do with rather a lot more carbonation."

"355 ml. bottle. Pours a small head, that doesn't hold much, though it leaves some lace. Smell of tropical fruits, citrus, hops, spices, pine.Medium body and salty palate, the taste is just as the aroma: tropical fruits, spices, citrus and pine."
"Pours a hazy yellow and has a strong head. Aroma is citrus and sweet. Bitter up front with a taste of citrus. Malt and sweetness. Herbal tones, It finishes dry and has a hint of pine. Easy to drink. Not as aggressive as many in the style but worth a try."
"O/D-Hard to review this beer with much conviction. Its been around forever. Its one of the forefathers and what not. Its boring to me. Really regretting my choice of a six-pack over a bomber...Sorry America?"

"This pours a clear honeyed golden color with tight foam. The aroma is lightly hopped with some lemony citrus notes. Flavor has more of the lemony zest/Lemon Pledge flavors—that is to say it’s citrusy and lemony with a light bitterness. An easygoing drinker. It’s hard to believe that at one time this was one of the hoppiest beers commercially distributed. It’s so tame in comparison to what’s out there these days."

"D - Pretty good. I like it more now that I've developed a palate for IPAs."
""
"This was an average beer that, in 1975 may have been an IPA. Today, it's scarcely a pale ale in character. Not recommended at all for those who like an American style IPA."
""
"Taste is refreshing, strong yet very pleasant, a hop symphony. Hoppy citrus, spice and Some sweet malts as it warms. Bitter-dry and full of character it is still a tad too watery to be amongst the best in its class."
""
""
""
""
"First of all, this is an American IPA? What? Really? Cause I swear before it was a Pale and referred to as Liberty Pale Ale. Either way you classify it, a damn good beer, but I'm rating this as an APA, because that's what I think it to be. And as an APA it's in the top of it's class, for my money. One of the hop components I believe is shared with Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA and it just makes these two beers both quite memorable for me. It's like a a citric mint charcoal bite and aroma and something else that I can't quite pit my finger on. Whatever it is, this is what turned me on to APAs and IPAs and was the beginning of my love for both. Awesome beer! Give it a try if you like anything even relatively hoppy."
""
""
""
"Poured a clearish pale copper color with a thin wispy white head. Very little detectable in the nose, mild citrusy hops and grainy malts. Taste was similarly muted, especially for an IPA, especially for an IPA being showcased by the brewer himself. Very light flavor, pale biscuity malts underneath a citrusy but subdued hop presence. Body is light, the beer, while lacking in flavor overall, is smooth and quite drinkable, but just too bland and thin compared to what I like in my AIPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an IPA with American hops with excellent balance of flavor. I generally seek out hoppy IPA but still enjoy this beer from time to time. It's a great example of the style but most would think it's more of an English IPA with American hops."
""
""
""
"O- Good. I really liked this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Honey yellow in color with a deep haze. Poured with short frothy foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Resinous citrus orange and light pineapple hop aromas with biscuit and honey aromas beneath. Medium bodied with slightly subdued but tangy carbonation. Citrus orange bitterness up front and into the middle. Tangy hop bite thru the middle that introduces pine hop flavors to the finish. Sweet malt, biscuit and honey flavored backbone throughout. Finishes with lingering pine hop bitterness."
""
""

"Another great beer from the Anchor brewery, probably not my favourite but still a classic right off the bat. The flavours all worked well together and struck a good balance. Good fruit notes that were refreshing and went down well."

"355ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Single brewer tasting session on agt´12. (Enjoyed many times in the past). Orangish amber color. Chill haze. White froth & firm lasting crown. Floral & citric hops, grapefruit notes, pine & some mildy toasted malts to the nose. Biscuit malts at first sip, light sweetness & hops showing a citric & floral touch whit aggressive bitterness. Medium to high body. Moderate carbonation. Oily texture. Coupled malts & hops in the middle with orange & grapefruit hues resolves in a dry bitter finish. Refreshing. Easy drinkability."

"The Rest: Body is medium to just on the thin side of this tasty IPA. This is a nice change-up from the typical AIPA, with the malt having a more prominent role in the taste profile. It has great balance with a lot of back and forth between the hop and malt characters."
"O - This beer shows awesome craftsmanship. It's beautiful how the hops can be so present in aroma but in flavor let malt shine through and finish with a reminding amount of flavor and dryness."

"I will not have this beer again. It does not fit its style at all."

"Pours clear golden with a large, frothy white head that dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. Some bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is of hops and malts. There are some citrus notes from the hops and it smells a little grassy. It's not a strong aroma, but it is pleasing. The flavor is of citrus and hops mostly on the first sip. There is a mild hop bitterness, which isn't very strong, but does provide some balance. As it stands, this pale ale is a little sweet. There's a mildly bitter aftertaste. The body is light with plenty of carbonation. It's crisp and refreshing with a dry finish. This is very easy to drink. Overall, this is a solid pale ale from Anchor. This is a good, drinkable beer."
"Pours a inviting bright golden with a 2 thumbs width white head. A little soapy in the aroma, a little earthy, some sweet orange, and a touch of some malt. Flavor starts of bready from the malt, some musty earth and citrus kicks in mid stream, and it closes out with some grass . Some but not much bitterness. A creamy and active mouthfeel to this. Overall, I have held off from trying this one forever but glad I finally got around to it. Nothing fancy or crazy about this, just an enjoyable beer done well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very drinkable but not very complex. Not a bad beer but nothing to make it stand out."
"Crisp, biting grassy hops...almost tastes like a beefed up lager. A biting carbonation, and some of the lemon on the backend too. Not exactly blown away by this one, but I can see the appeal. A fairly dry, easy to drink APA that certainly won't offend."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I hate to have a beer brought down by a single category, but this one is a shame. I'm not sure if its a bad batch or what, but I didn't really enjoy drinking it. The taste smell and look are all great though."
"On the other hand, this beer pales (hehehehe) compared to their Barleywine and Porter. Of course, those are exceptional beers which really punch above their weight!"

"Not so much of an IPA as Anchor says, but as a Pale Ale, very good."
"O: drinkable, lighter body but good an refreshing"
""
"Hazy dark orange-amber with a thin white head. Citrusy and bitter aroma that appeared to be a blend of American and floral hops. Very nice, plush palate with a creamy mouthfeel, gritty hold and perfect carbonation. Bitter chocolate leads flavour, and the bitterness stretches out a long finish."
"Pours a translucent honey color with a decent-sized white head with appreciable lacing. Aroma is that of floral, slightly citric hops. Flavor is crisp and balanced up front with an emphasis on the hops, though wheat asserts itself in the aftertaste in a way that is slightly overbearing (though there's some citrus lurking there as well). The first sip resets the palate nicely, though. This brew is not overly complex, but it's serviceable insofar as it is crisp, refreshing, and balanced. It's not something I'd seek out, but I enjoyed it a good deal more than Anchor's flagship, Steam."
"O - A nice beer. Great look, good profile, and nice feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A real treat if a little heavy on the alcohol strength side."
""
""
""
"Refreshing, light and tasty. Pours a hazy golden with a medium head. The aroma is tasty, with a little bite of wheat and an overripe flower edge from the hops. The flavor is light and toasty, with a bready malt backbone and a gentle but distinct piny and flowery hop note over top. The mouthfeel is rich and filling with a piny sting on the finish."
""
""
"I had this on tap in SD over the new year and loved it, but out of a bottle it really isn't the same. Or I was just feeling generous that first night, I don't know. I like the dry hopping, but the sweetness of the malt just gets to me after a while. The bitterness needs to be stepped up a bit for me to thoroughly enjoy this beer."
"Overall: A-, great balance on a hoppy beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A truly great beer from Anchor, pours golden in a pint glass, with a picture perfect foamy head. Great use of the cascade hops throughout, but not too hoppy to make it one dimensional....perfect beer for summertime picnics or baseball games in July. One of my favs."

"D: Nicely balanced and smooth ale. Glad I tried this, and I would recommend this for malt/barley-forward ale fans."
""
""
"O - A grandfather of many a great APA but so many have exceeded this one."
"Gold on light amber with medium large creamy , frothy head. Flowery light herbal hop aroma with slight citric and honey character. The malty sweetness is in the front, with a nice bitter, hoppy finish with still more malty sweetness in the background."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent pale ale. worth a try, tasty apa."
"This brew pours a golden color, leaving a fingers worth of a white head and decent lacing. The aroma is has a slight citrus note to it with hints of malt and yeast esters. The taste has a slight bitterness to it on the front of the tongue and a malty sweetness at the back. Nice medium mouth feel"

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"An enjoyable pale ale, the malts are much more prevalent and balanced than is customary in most American pale ales."
"O: Hop profile isn't as assertive as I would have liked, but it's pretty well-rendered, with the floral notes complimenting the malt very well."
""
""
"Pale golden-copper colour, one finger of white head, slight lace spots. Smell is lightly sweet malt, bitter hop, pine, citrus, lemon rind and buttered bread, dry earthy notes as well. Taste has soft sweet malts, dry hops, citrus and grapefruit, light butter flavours, nice bitterness throughout, citrus hoppy aftertaste. Medium carbonation, medium body, medium-full weight, nice dry feel as well. Solid pale ale that I will revisit however there are some around that I like more but I will come back to this form time to time."

"Poured a golden orange with a great white head and above average retention. Sheets of lacing. Nose has some grassy hops and pale malts, crisp crackery notes and ligth grains. Taste is again lightly grassy, lightly caramelized malts, pale malts, grains a good hop flavour. Very mild citrus in the finish. Medium body with a good bitterness in the finish. Medium high carbonation with a touch of alcohol. Good drinkability, with some likeness to some Kellerbiers and EIPA's I've previously had."

"This beer poured a quite clear amber with a thick white head. Lots of carbonation. There was an aroma of crisp, clean hops, with a slight note of malt. There was a good amount of hop bitterness. Notes of lemon peel and grapefruit. Pine was also present. The mouth feel was quite pleasant, creamy, perhaps due to the high level of carbonation. Overall the was a very pleasant beer to drink, I could see myself having this again, as a change for the highly hopped beers I usually prefer."

""
""

"Pours crystal clear yellow with a good amount of carbonation and a single finger of silky white head. Lots of esther fruitiness in the aromas, along with sweet and bready malt and a citrus hop smell. Scents are not big, but they are pleasant when found. Hops are a lot more prominent in the taste than they were in the smell, bringing the bready malt flavor to the front. Lots of esthers make the beer sweet, but do not fully balance the bitters. Flavors are big and full, and the bitterness has a bite without being obscene. Btterness lingers into the aftertaste as a reminder of the style. This beer has a great amount of body for the style, making the flavors really rich and enjoyable. Carbonation keeps the hops at the forefront of the flavor profile. A great after work beer."
"Very drinkable beer that paired quite well with pizza. It has enough character to be satisfying and a refreshing crispness. Great pick for meals or parties, but a tad pricy as a day-to-day beer."

"In a bottle at Wing Central in the U district. Poured into a pint glass. Ar: hoppy but mild Ap: hazy, darkish blond with about a half finger head. Decent carbonation.

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy, vibrant, yellow-gold coloring with a sparse film covering the surface. Slow, steady carbonation bubbling throughout the beer. Aromas are flowery and citrus sweet, with a subtle hops presence in the background. Flavors are light and effervescent, with grapefruit and blood orange citrus sweet flavors, and a mild, dry hops profile that cleans up the palate. The malty representation is mild, with a slight, full body sweetness in the backbone of the brew. The aftertaste is slightly roasted, with the citrus sweet blend taking the biggest space on the palate. Good, clean, slightly drying finish, with the hops bitters and citrus tart both doing their part to clear the palate. Great beer."

"This is an alright APA. In my opinion the hops are a little too fruity and there isn't enough of a malt backbone to support balance. It's drinkable, if maybe a little heavily carbonated."

"A tasty pale ale - good stuff. The blend of malt, yeast and hop flavours is solid; my only complaint is that the hop bitterness seems to overwhelm the aroma, leaving it slightly unbalanced. However, this is still a highly drinkable beer. Worth trying."

"One of my favorite readily available brews. It pours a nice amber color with a nice thick head. Nose of freshly cut grain and a clean hops scent. Good integration of malt and hops. Taste is clean and fresh. This is a true all day brew for me. Good effort."

"Beer is golden and translucent. Not much head. Aroma is subtle. Break, hops, and some tropical fruit. Taste is clean malt, citrus, lemon hoppy finish with hints of fir. Mouthfeel is excellent. This is very refreshing and very drinkable. It's nicely carbonated. It's crisp and clean but with a nice complexity."
"The best of this style - the origin of the California/West Coast Style Pale Ale. There is a reason why this beer has stood the test of time and still can beat the best of them. Its simple yet complex, beautiful hazy dirty blonde brew that can act as a session brew but also stand in for the hop heads and newbies. This is quality in a bottle and deserves every bit of the high rating that it gets. Anchor still brews some of the best IMO."
"Overall: Enjoyable and easy to drink, although I prefer Anchor Steam to this beer."
"Dirty blonde with a thick, solid white froth. Signature flavor and aroma of Cascades- sharp grapefruit and flowers. The hops run up against grainy malt with a buttered biscuit softness. Yeast adds more of an English slant with some fruit and woodiness. An old school hoppy American ale, though not so hoppy by today's standards. Some might find the more English malt/yeast combo at odds with the American hopping, but a pint now and then makes me appreciate a beer that has withstood the test of time."
"edit: just found out the bottle is 4 months old"
"Just an average APA with Cascade hops just friendly."
"Highly drinkable and refreshing."
"O - definitely a one of a kind APA, the mix of mineral, sour fruit, and floral is like nothing I've tried, would not want to session this but I could see this being a semi regular purchase"
"This is an American classic and a very good pale ale."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the style Amecican Pale Ale."
"overall: Good beer, pleasantly surprised by the smell and taste, very floral even on the aftertaste, very pleasant. I enjoyed it very much."
"Overall, an enjoyable beer and one that is definitely worth a try. Another fine offering from Anchor."
"O: A decent pale ale. I prefer the Humming Ale over the Liberty but this is still tasty."
"This beer totally supprised me. I wasnt expecting this beer to drink so easly. I LOVE anchor steam, Anchor christmas, Anchor Summer. Have not tried the rest of the bunch and when I get an opportunity to try one of the others I do. Well the Liberty Ale was great....the wife even liked it. When drinking it, I got a little bit of spice and sweet. Would buy it again in a heart beat. Thank you Anchor for impressing me once again."
"Flavors are similar, pale malt, mild citrus, lightly floral. Shortbread sweetness at first, with an easygoing bitterness in the finish. A little bit of herbal hop spice and fruity apple from the yeast. Overall easy drinking, simple and flavorful."
"Overall - In my opinion the perfect American Pale Ale. I like many other APAs but this one is my favorite!"
"D - Very well balanced beer that fits the style nicely and I'd certainly drink again. However, in my opinion Anchor's Humming Ale is better and can be had for the same price."
"Unfortunately it was a part of a mix-six pack and I'd really like another one."
"This beer pours cloudy and has limited head. Gold in color with a good smell. Was very effervecent on the tongue. Good tasting and very good on the after taste. Leaves the mouth quickly and invites you to drink more. Went well with mixed nuts and cheese. Better tasting that its appearance."
"The beer is a foggy golden color.The head makes a circle around the glass and is barely existent. The smell has a lot of fruity smells. The taste is good too. The tastes has wheat flavor and slight fruitiness. The mouthfeel has some crispness. Just overall a good beer."
"O: I think the smooth mouthfeel gives Anchor Liberty Ale a slight edge over Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. I think the flavor is also pretty well rounded."
"O-really good pale ale that is well balanced"
"Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint. Pretty pale orangish-gold with nice white head and abundant lacing. Aroma of citrus and grapefruit hops, semi-sweet toasted malts with only a slight graininess, somewhat spicy. Smells more IPA than APA. Very nice Cascade hops with evident citrus and grapefruit. Malt is more in the background and mostly dry and only slightly grainy. Ends with a distinct spice and hop bite. Moderate carbonation, medium smooth and firm body, and very, very dry. Seems English in feel. This is pretty much THE original ale of the modern craft beer movement that spawned both the APA and IPA. Plus, it is fantastic."
"I am taking a half point from my overall score because my burbs from this one tasted terrible!"
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a slightly foamy head. The smell is excellent -- zesty floral hints, touches of grapefruit -- really nice. The taste has a bit of a zing to it, but is not overwhelming. Dry finish. Leaves just a slight lacing along the glass. Overall, a very solid american pale ale."
"Cheers!"
"Nice easy middle of the road ale from Anchor."
"Soft and round, medium bodied. A bit too dry, perhaps; otherwise would be quite sessionable (excepting the 6% abv)."
"A really nice APA. I feel like this is a beer that is much better fresh than even after a couple months."
"Overall, I would place this as my second favorite American Pale Ale behind Sierra Nevada of course. I would love to drink this one on tap. It is no doubt a classic example of the style."
"This beer has a unique, delicate flavor that is really nice, and give that the beer is so easy to drink, I'd be hard pressed not to buy it again."
"On tap at Ducali Pizza in the North End. Served in an Anchor branded pint glass. Muted orange color, with just a minor amount of head. Smell was of pine and citrus. Nice amount of hops on the palate for an APA. Well balanced though, so it was a smooth beer to drink. Mouthfeel was enjoyable, except I thought the abv was a tad high for a pale ale. A tasty beer to drink, and a nice alternative to Anchor Steam, which is what I usually see on tap everywhere instead."
"O- Overall a decent pale ale. Not the best one ever but it is very balanced. Even if you don't like hops it is a good beer."
"Na Zdravje!"
"It was decent, but the flavors in this beer didn't quite mesh."
"Overall a very nice beer, another piece of art by Anchor!"
"Notes: A unique beer, no doubt. Belongs in the APA category I guess. It is a great Summer Beer, refreshing and invigorating to the taste buds. It is nice to see West Coast Hops used with balance and restraint. This is a great change of pace beer, with some nice flavor notes and a beer that stands out in it's style category rather than a generic clone."
"Can you taste the freedom? It is medium in body with a mildly dry finish, the overall beer is nice, good malt character a mild, probably about 20 IBU bitterness on the finish. The overall beer is quite drinkable. I guess it tastes good, but just isn't special to me. I would have it again if I found myself at a party with someone who thought they knew what good beer was or if I went to some ridiculous event that served this or BMC. I enjoyed it, I just wasn't blown away."
"one of many i haven't reviewed for the sake that its so easy to find. grain solid ipa with good PH. Good color with a mild cloudiness, favorably sweet so. Not much nose outside of pine mineral hint. Palate is balanced with grain grit and a simple but well placed single hop. A bit husky mineral feel but altogether easy to drink. For scale of production, but anchor is really good at not marginalizing beer production."
"Overall - I thought this was an interesting beer, a unique APA in my opinion. I thought the taste was refreshing and crisp. A pretty good beer overall"
"Overall a good refreshing beer. Very good."
"O: Another solid offering from Anchor. Good work, gent."
"M - Balanced. Good carbonation. Good flavor sticks to the palate. Easy to drink."
"D: I really think that this is not the best this beer can be. I've had this beer before and remember it popping a bit more in the flavor department, and for a beer that describes itself as ""dry-hopped"" but doesn't bring it in the aroma department makes me think this beer is a bit past its due date. Disappointing overall."
"A mainstay to be enjoyed every Independence Day! This brew poured up a luscious golden amber colored body with a foamy head with good retention and lacing effects. Aromas of floral hops, some grains and fruits (oranges, lemons). Flavors of hops, apricots (or maybe nectarines), a slight hint of honey (or burnt sugar). Light- to Medium-bodied, very smooth with a dry finish."
"Some hopheads might find this beer wanting because it's not as aggressive as the newer APAs and IPAs, but I see it as a well-crafted, enjoyable brew."
"Poured a cloudy amber color with a creamy head that lasted the whole glass. Nose was of straw and grass with a hint of some citrus fruits. The taste was surprisingly a little sweet, but with a nice afterbite of hoppy bitters to give it a nice crisp finish. Overall I have always enjoyed this beer and style and was not disappointed. Very refreshing on a hot summer night."
"Bought this as a singleton, and am a bit bummed that I bypassed the full sixer. This is an easy drinking session-style ale, an APA that is on the sweeter side with very mild to non-existent hops. Grab one if you're looking for a milder APA."
"I used 2 different glasses: 1 full American Pint Glass for tradition, and one full Riedel Stemless style Cab/Merlot glass. I preferred the Riedel for all aspects of the tasting experience."
"Overall: Nice beer."
"M: Medium light body, some carbonation. Nice American Pale Ale."
"O: drinkable brew, not very exciting, but nothing offensive"
"Overall: I didn't expect this beer to taste like a sweet malt heavy IPA. However, I appreciate how terrific balanced tis beer is and from what I know it is the first craft pale ale produced in america. I recommend it to all beer drinkers."
"Pours a light golden amber, two finger frothy white head that leave a bunch of lacing on the glass. Really floral hops on the nose, orange blossom, pine, citrus. Flavor follows suit with a nice bit of body. Not overly sweet or big, but there is plenty there to back up the hops. More than anything, this beer is really balanced and one that I could come back to again."
"Pours a lightly hazed gold color, moderate cap of white bubbles, decent retention and some lacing. Scent is quite floral with an orange blossom like citrus quality, backbone is grainy malt, minimaly sweet with a faint hint of nuttyness. Taste follows scent, pleasent floral and citrus notes before a solid crackery malt backbone hit, faint touch of grain, carmel and even fainter touch of nuts. Slightly bitter and even more so when approaching room temp. Light lemony soap charachter towards the bottom of the glass. Medium bodied, carbonation in control, some lingering grainy bitterness after each sip. Solid pale ale, quite balanced with neither the hops or malt being overly powerful."
"Overall, a solid APA - old school cascade."
"Nice, light, an excellent session APA."
"D/O- Sweetness in the aroma/taste categories as well as the sticky mouthfeel, really cut down on the level of enjoyment I get while drinking this beer. I don't plan on purchasing or drinking this beer anytime in the foreseeable future. There's just too many other fish in the ""APA"" sea. Cheers."
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden/ brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of piney hops. Taste is also piney hops up front, a touch of malt, bitter at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"A classic and its not hard to see why. A little fruitier and a little less hoppy than I've come to prefer but I will certainly enjoy it again and again."
"Overall: A really good put-together brew."
"Straight-forward but satisfying example of the style - perfect as the weather warms up."
"Nice example of style and I certainly appreciate the balance between malt and hops here. Overall it's as refreshing as a lager and very sessionable."
"overall; not a huge fan of this style but this is one of the better versions I've had."
"O: Not too bad but not worth the near $9 it cost for a six pack."
"This beer is moderate in body, and has a very smooth mouthfeel. Not real complex as far as flavor goes, but extremely balanced and quite tasty. Borderline English in style, but has just enough to make it an American classic. One of the great original offerings from the West Coast!"
"Summary - This is the first Anchor beer I've tried, and I really enjoyed it. It's not too heavy, so it's a good brew to enjoy on a hot day. Nothing exceptional in particular, but all-around good."
"Another enjoyable brew."
"O- a very nice beer that i have passed by too many times. the strength isnt too much to not allow having a couple in a sitting without having a bad next day either. well done. check this one out."
"taste very pleasant after some yard work. a bit crisp"
"O: This beer is interesting enough to keep bringing me back for more (and more), but, in part because of the relatively high ABV, and in part because it isn't particularly ""crisp", it's not as sessionable as other hoppy pale ales. I haven't had this beer in a long time because it's usually so old by the time it hits the shelves around here, but now I'll buy this whenever I find a reasonably fresh batch."
"O - Overall this is a tasty APA. Good malt and hops, nice appearance, solid mouthfeel. Very sessionable."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with medium carbonation, a medium body and crisp zesty finish that accents the sweet malts and yeast. Wow, this was unique and tasty, and a beer that I highly recommend. A great old school craft beer classic."
"Poured in a glass had a big 3finger white in color head. Smelled of citrus and fruits, was not hoppy or malty at all very refreshing summer beer. Not a whole lot of character, but really smooth lent itself to the upper end of light beers. I would drink it again most definitely."
"Solid, solid all around beer right here. Extremely drinkable and enjoyable. This is a beer that has lasted the test of time and it shows."
"O: Well done, all around. While no individual aspect is overpoweringly good, everything is solid and the combination is truly a classic American beer."
"Overall, really quite an astounding APA. I've found Anchor to be somewhat lackluster in it's other styles, but this is a winner. Delicious, fruity, sweet and perfectly hopped. Great job."
"Overall a good summer beer. Solid. Will probably buy some more for the summer months."
"O: I really like this beer, the taste is good for any time of year, but now that it's getting warm again this would be a great beer for summer activities."
"O- Seems complex but it is very drinkable."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a one finger head that dissipates to a film on top of my beer. Smell is of grassy floral hops. Taste starts with those good hop flavors, then I get a touch of light bready malts. Mouthfeel is proper for a slightly heavier APA, and carbonation is moderate. This is an APA you could have any time of year, I am glad I bought a 6-er this January."
"O - Behind the Porter, this is my second favourite from these guys and it is certainly a solid offering and perfect example of the style. Easily drinkable and quite flavourful."
"O: anchor can do no wrong. worth trying if you can get it, you wont be disappointed."
"O: This is an American Pale Ale that I can rely on. I've been waiting for an all-around great APA to come my way, and this is the first I've tried."
"One of the classic APA's. Hoppy, refreshing, a perfect choice for a hop lover looking for something lighter than an IPA especially on a hot day."
"Overall this a nice pale ale. Nice and refreshing and very drinkable!"
"ODB (Ol' Dirty Bastard, hell yeah!) Date Code. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a two finger bone white head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Very nicely balanced flavor going on here. Good aroma as well. Glad that this one is readily available in my area. Definitely a must try even if you aren't trying to tick the Beer Hall of Fame list..."
"This is another winner from Anchor, with a crisp and refreshing air (and overall drinkibility about it) that belies its 6% ABV. Hoppy yet approachable is the name of the game with this one."
"(revised with bottle consumed Sept. 2013)"
"This ale pours out as a light copper color with a generous amount of head on it that fades after a little while. The aroma of the beer is mostly hoppy with a little bit of malt in the far back end of it. The flavor is pretty hoppy too, with the malts bringing up the aftertaste and drying things out it makes you go right back for the next mouthful. The mouthfeel is pretty good too, It's drinkable and not overly heavy ot light."
"D-Overall this is a Nice beer. Super refreshing even though it has a somewhat dry feel to it. Everything in this beer is well balanced. WOuld enjoy this anytime of the year. Another great job Anchor"
"the mouthfeel is a little light, which is quite refreshing. i could drink this all day. in fact, my next day on the dock will be spent nursing a sixpack of these for sure."
"This pours a hazy gold with a big, fluffy two finger white head that leaves some spotty lace that can't seem to decide if it wants to stick around or not. On the nose, the hop profile is very floral, lacking the big pine or citrus notes. There are biscuity malts underneath the flowers, and definitely some raw, grainy hints, too. In the mouth the hops subside a bit and the raw grains especially comes out. There are fruit flavors, not citrusy but more generally just plain old fruit in the mouth. The body is medium with a medium finish, very well-balanced, just like the beer as a whole. Overall I think this beer is a fine, well-balanced pale ale, with the big detraction for me being the graininess that just doesn't sit well within the taste mix. Others may think differently about it and I wouldn't begrudge them that, as this is clearly a well-built brew."
"O=I didn't quite know what to expect, but I'm really pleased with this. A great beer that screams America from the bottle to the taste. Well done Anchor"
"Brewed on 1, F, V, whatever the hell that means. Pours out a lovely copper kettle color with a thick, smooth creamy looking head. Lots of tiny bubbles working their way up to the top. Beer smells citric, briney and ever so slightly sweet to the nose, yet a bit vague. The beer tastes nicely hoppy, with lots of piney, citrusy Cascades hitting my palate, with a nice clean, dry, bitter aftertaste. Tastes a bit like an amped up Anchor Steam, more long bitter citric hops, slightly grapefruity towards the end. I can detect some slight sweetness from the barley mash, adds a nice touch. The feeling on the tongue is all smoothness, small gentle bubbles make it almost creamy. Overall Anchor is a revolutionary brewing company that doesn't try to overdo anything. What they do they do extremely well and the majority of american craft brewers could learn from them. Goes down extremely smoothly and leaves me wanting another, which I will gladly do! Anchor Brewing is definitely a destination spot I hope to visit someday."
"Very balanced, straightforward, and highly drinkable."
"O: Anchor may do stuff the old fashioned way, but heck it works and it's damn tasty. I've never had a bad brew by them and respect them very much."
"Overall, while lacking the bold hop and malt flavors of contemporary APAs, this is a great beer. Like it's cousin brewed up in Chico, a true American classic."
"Overall this was a terrific beer and would recommend it for those looking for a good all around beer with a solid amount of hop flavor but not quite as bitter as a standard IPA"
"A delicious, easy-to-drink ale with a wealth of flavor and character."
"Overall: A good solid beer for a good price. There are many better beers on the market, and it's definitely not for everyone, but for the price you absolutely can't go wrong. 4.5/5"
"O: It has an interesting flavor, but I don't love it. The aroma really hurts it for me, having to smell it every single time I take a sip."
" lemony hop flavors with tangy elelments of orange rind and slightly bitter taste of herbs with a slightly apple-jack type quality. The overall hoppiness is not over the top assertive but it has a nice clean bitterness with lots of hop flavor and only a mild amount of citrus zest astringency. The light floral hop elements are great adding to the complexity of the flavor while the malt is sturdy but not very forward either. A really great Pale, plenty of hop taste with mild malt gives light fruitiness of the yeast an effortless yet delectable balance for the beer as a whole. I think Anchor Liberty is highly drinkable, a quenching satisfying and well made ale."
"Drinkability - The lack of a strong aftertaste makes this very drinkable for the style."
"D - Easy drinking."
"Recommended: A solid offering from Anchor. I prefer the Steam Beer, but this one is certainly worthy as well."
"You really can't go wrong with an Anchor beer, I think they are some of the best American-brewed beers out there."
"The taste is also quite good, it comes on very strong with the citrus at first, with a bit of floral, slightly aggressive hops moving in. Aftertaste is nice citrus and a bit of pine resin. Nice, very pale malty backbone. The only thing that brings this down is a slight astringent quality throughout, as well as a pervasive sweetness. The mouthfeel is solid, it's highly carbonated and on the lighter side of medium bodied. The drinkability is also quite good, the only knock on it is the aforementioned sweetness."
"the CPJ"
"Pours an almost-clear, golden-orange color with a nice large white head that goes down slowly. Aroma is quite lovely on this beer. I get some English malt notes with a strong floral background. Some subtle hoppiness is present throughout. A lot of floral notes though. Taste is either English hops or English malt...I'm really not that skilled when it comes to distinguishing. All I know is there are some nice malt and hop notes in here, and one of em aint American! Strange, considering it's called Liberty Ale. This beer is very well-balanced and somewhat complex. I'm diggin it. Mouthfeel is very full-bodied and almost creamy. Not watery at all. Drinkability is high. I can't believe it took me so long to try this beer. I see it all the time, but never grabbed it. I'm glad I did."
"This is a real winner. A nearly perfect marriage of hops and malt. One I will gladly drink again and again."
"D: Good taste - moderately drinkable. Overall, a great brew from Anchor."
"In fact I think that it's B+ rating on this site might have something to do with it's distribution, because this brew has tons of positives, even if it might get knocked for being widely available."
"Drink- To me, an ultimate beer. It is my fallback for any occasion. If I saw this beer every time I opened my fridge, I'd be a happy man."
"Cheers"
"Overall a very nice representation of the style. Light, clean and easy to drink. Would have no issues with going after this one again."
"Pours a big 2 finger white head. Creamy and sticks around a while. Very nice white ring of lacing remains till it's gone. Very aromatic, floral, earthy, piney, some citrus, slight sweetness, touch of carmel. Tastes earthy, carmel sweetness, some floral lavender quality, piney, slightly resinous. Some mineral water tastes on the finish. Very well balanced. Slight lingering bitterness. Medium bodied, medium carbonation. I could drink quite a few of these at a time."
"overall: ill have to give this a try when i can find a fresher bottle. i remember having this years ago and thought it was much better, but my palate may have changed quite a bit. humming ale was a much hoppier, more enjoyable brew."
"D: Satisfying."
"What a great beer. I never thought Anchor would be able to make a beer that competes with AnchorSteam in characteristics. Such a well balanced beer. From the start it reeks of fruit, despite the fact that the fruit doesn't show too much in flavor. Nice floral hop smell, kinda reminds me of Spring blossoms. As far as drinkability goes this one really hits the spot. Go buy some, You will not be disappointed. Stay thirsty my friends."
"Beautiful rich, cloudy, amber color with a fluffy white head that leaves lacing all the way down. Smell threw me off a little bit. Almost smells skunked and reminds me, of all things, of Heineken. Fortunately, it doesn't taste like Heineken. In fact it's a damn good, or at the very least solid, beer. I get some citrusy pine notes from the hops and a very crisp hop finish. The bitterness is near perfect and makes this beer extremely drinkable. Carbonation is high and perfect for the the style. Just another good and solid beer from Anchor."
"Overasll started off nice but didn't end uop as I would have liked"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is also very sessionable."
"Cheers."
"D: Very good brew. A nice, but unique taste for a APA. Good job here."
"Poured with a large, frothy white head, with good lacing. Body was slightly hazy, and a dark-yellow color. Aroma was of average hops, with a light presence of alcohol as well. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and fairly thin, with a little oiliness to it. Soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Flavor was long-lasting of moderate bitterness and some nice citrus flavors, with a very dry finish. Slight taste of alcohol in there as well. A bit bland for me..."
"A great tasting beer with just the right amout of hop bitterness. I'll definately be looking for this and will drink it often. Highly recommended."
"D: With this I take the liberty to enjoy myself with putting down a few more of these, very good, true to style and even surprised me."
"This is a very creamy beer. Very enjoyable to swirl around, enjoying all the hidden flavours. Could this be a session beer? No idea. I only have one bottle and its a work night."
"Much better this time. Glad I revisited this one, as this is a good beer. Make damn sure that the bottle you get is fresh. Old bottles of this one are garbage at worst and lackluster at best. Fresh, it's quite tasty and very well done."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. This tastes more like a hoppy tripel then anything else. Very flavorful, nice mouthfeel, and a easy drinking beer. Well done, Anchor."
"The aroma is of wonderfully aromatic citrus hops with biscuit-y, sweet malts. The taste is similar to the aroma with a great bitter finish. The only letdown for me is a tad of a watery mouth feel. Liberty Ale is very drinkable, a good session pale ale. If it's the same recipe as it was when first released, it was far ahead of its time. I'd never turn one down. I'm always pleased when I can find one."
"This is an excellent beer. I tasted it alone for a while, then drank the rest with my supper...butter chicken. It was an excellent match, and in that context, it was smashing-good. I'd happily drink this regularly."
"D: This tastes very fruity and fresh making it a highly drinkable APA."
"Drinkability: It's a very drinkable beer accompanied with great flavours and aromas. It's an overall great pale ale."
"d - extremely drinkable. Great session beer, but does not really fit the apa style. More like a cream ale. Probably the best light ale available in Ontario, where our micros are hop shy."
"This is another solid ale from Anchor. I could have this one anytime anyplace. Definitely worth a try."
"D - the right amount of hops to make it considerably drinkable."
"NB. I really dig the cover, going in the collection."
"Aromas of white pepper, hibiscus flowers and a little citrus. Light to medium bodied, prickly, citrusy, flowery with some solid malt backbone. Very good beer."
"Drinkability - interesting and fairly complex tastes. Overall a very tasty and interesting brew!"
"Good amount of carbonation bounces the hops right off the tongue. Anchor is such a solid brewery, and this beer is no exception. Very drinkable unique, but familiar flavors. Right up there with SNPA for me to judge all other APA's by."
"Drink - I've had this beer a few times and never got around to reviewing it. It's not a hop bomb by any means but it has enough hop taste to keep me interested. Considering what's available to people from Ontario at the LCBO, it's pretty damn good. I could drink this all night long - it's my new go to beer. (since I can't get my hands on any SNPA here)"
"D - An extremely drinkable pale ale, a quintessential session beer."
"D- it's drinkable sure. Especially if you wanna introduce someone to craft but not kill their palate with hops."
"12 oz into a snifter. Pale straw color with a plentiful head. Neat and tidy appearance (not a yeasty beer). The aroma is much 'smaller' than many pale ales, but this is not a bad thing, as it is in fact much more refined and delicate. I don't drink that many American pale ales because I find they tend to be a bit overbalanced on the malt side, but the balance of this beer is exquisite. It starts as it means to go on, with a consistent flavor that is quite delicate and pleasant. It's hard to not quaff the whole glass in one gulp. A widely available and affordable beer and truly world class. Highly recommended."
"Poured a big 3"" head which slowly settles. A rich pee yellow color. Smell of hops and maybe a hint of skunking. If there were such a thing as ""beerness"" I'd say this sample has a lot of it, because it's like any of the mainstream BMCs just magnified in the color, taste, and smell. And I understand this was sort of a gateway beer which bridged the old BMC style to the more modern hoppy IPAs, so I respect that, but instead of coming across as fresh strong hops it comes off almost more like a skunked BMC."
"goes down smooth and easy. not a challenging or unique beer but fresh and well made."
"D: Very balanced and easy to drink."
"Pours a slightly hazy yellowish orange with a thick off white head that seems like it stays around for like five years and more lacing than I have ever seen in any beer before. Smells of citrus and hops. Tastes of wheat (which I don't think that it is) citrus, and plenty of hops to round it out. Mouthfeel is medium with good body and some carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"Overall, not terribly impressed by this one. A bit too flowery and not enough citrus or resin flavors for my tastes. Still, its fairly decent and maybe worth trying just to have all the Anchor beers under your belt, given the historic nature of the brewing company. Cheers!"
"this was a very hoppy & bitter beer. it tastes like beer is supposed to taste. the flavor is very solid almost IPAish. however i didnt think there was anything interesting about it. kind makes me think of a basic solid good beer- like a stone foundation waiting for something great to be build on top."
"D: Very drinkable. Flavorful and balanced. Sessionable ABV."
"This beer has a very dry taste. It is well balanced and very drinkable. It has a distinctive bouquet, tastes like a dry less distinctive IPA. I picked up a six pack and drank 3 of them. I have to say they also produced a nice buzz with the 6% abv. Overall a nice drinkable Dry Ale."
"Solid ESB beer. Good malt profile, and the herby hops go well, I get an almost black tea flavor from it. I think that is so great to this beer is the balance, is that there is nothing over powering to make it super awesome. Unfortunately because it is so balanced, after a few beers there is nothing memorable to it."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into my Coors Banquet tasting pilsner glass. Produce a fairly decent head with mild lacing. Nice continuous carbonation and rich golden hue. Smell the typical anchor steam brew with some mild piney and citrusy additions. Taste is very much like the smell. I think it is a tad tastier than the anchor steam due to the additional piney hoppy flavour. Mouthfeel is wonderful, light to medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability is splendid; I could certainly enjoy two or three outside on a sunny day. I could enjoy a few inside, if need be. Cheers."
"Liberty Ale One of my favourite beers from San Francisco's Anchor Brewery and highly drinkable, with a good head, a great taste and feel. Well worth drinking! I hope the new owners of the Anchor Brewery never change it!"
"D- Great! I could drink a few of these on a nice summer day while on the porch swing."
"It pours a nice clear amber reddish color with a medium head that leaves its share of lacing. The smell is very hoppy with citrus notes and a slight bit of malt. The taste begins with an abundance of hops but finishes with a smooth hint of malt to make it go down easier. Good full thick mouthfeel and decent drinkabability. Not one of my favorite anchor steam beers, but all around a solid brewskie to sit back and enjoy. Different from many other traditional APA's ive had like SNPA, but its unique spin benefits it."
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy golden with a thick white head. Aroma is a perfect balance between citrusy hops and biscuit malt. Medium, tangy body. Citrusy, spicy hops and grapefruit flavor nicely balanced by biscuit malt on the palate. Long dry finish. An awesome beer. I'm glad I've finally tried it."
"Pours opaque orange with a nice lasting white head. Aroma of piney hops, citrus. Taste is piney earthy hops, citrus light malt, with good carbonation,crisp, nice tangy with a some bitterness to add balance. This is a very nice brew. It is easy drinking and well balanced. More of an IPA. An enjoyable brew."
"Pours a golden copper with a 2 inch head that after a while dissipates into a nice inch lacing. Great piney scent, citrusy, gotta love those hops. A little grapefruit on the tongue, malty and delicious. Hoppy finish. Highly drinkable and highly recommended. Wow, what a great APA! Took me a while to review it (don't ask me why). Great session brew and from now on, a regular on my fridge!"
"Overall this is a decent beer. I'm not a fan of beers that have a barley finish, so as a result my grading is harsher than most. What I thought was excellent about this beer was its head retention and that it is definitely a well made beer. Shame, its not my type of a brew."
"Has nice fruity like aroma that grabs you. It has a nice head that lingers for quite awhile. Has murky honey like amber color with very active bubbles. The taste at first is a bitter but then subdues and goes down smoothly. I would definitely buy this one again."
"This beer is great if you want to taste English, but buy American."
"Drink well my friends"
"Anytime you visit a brewery, you are predisposed to liking it, in my opinion. It is part of the ""sport"" of enjoying good beer. You tie memories and and a sense of ownership to that particular brewery. I went to Anchor on my honeymoon and had a blast. However, in my own defense, I enjoyed this beer at Virginia Beach the year before. It pours a nice golden color with excellent head, and is everything that you expect from and APA. It's bitter and hoppy, but less drastic than an IPA. Its well rounded quality makes this beer very drinkable. This should accentuate everyone's beer repertoire...yeah, I went there!"
"The taste is full of pale malt seems very fresh to the taste the body is mild but apparent a mild hop bitterness finishes"
"Overall, a solid APA. Crisp, refreshing and tasty!"
"D- Easy to drink but not much in the flavor department."
"D: Highly quaffable, highly palatable, available and well-priced. Excellent APA."
"d: a classic example of the style and solidly crafted all around"
"Overall: very interesting APA dominated by its dry hopped character. Tasty and enjoyable."
"Overall, this is very lovely. Nice hoppiness, and subtle malts. NOMS."
"Drinkability - I like this beer, this is a good APA and i enjoyed it a lot.Good size bottle to stock and allow to share with friends and family when they come by."
"medium-bodied mouthfeel with slightly above-average carbonation. fairly drinkable, i would not object to another."
"Drinkability - A friendly beer for most if you can handle hops. Light and crisp taste, you can put a few back no problem. The beer is tasty and has no bad after-taste."
"nice pale ale, always dug this. easy drinking."
"D - A nice combination of dry malt and spicy hops with some fruity notes that come out in the finish. The malt is well balanced with enough sweetness to keep the toasted notes from becoming unpleasant. Moderate, herbal bitterness rounds things out. This isn't as pungent or pine oriented as many modern pale ales, but after 35 years it is still a good pale ale and an interesting glimpse into the early years of American craft brewing."
"Overall this beer is well balanced between hops and malt. The fruit aroma from the yeast coupled with the tartness alluded to a young beer."
"This one pours a light auburn in color with a light white head. It doesn't really have any overpowering aromas. Both the hops and malt are pretty subtle. It doesn't stand out in that category. It is very tasty and has a unique kind of sweetness to it. It's really kind of hard to describe but it is very appealing. I really enjoyed it. It drinks well, pretty light in consistency and has good carbonation to it. It's very drinkable, especially for a pale."
"Overall - What a great tasting, well balanced beer. This is definitely worth having again.."
"I enjoyed Anchor Liberty Ale. It's a pretty basic tasting pale ale, but that's what makes it a good beer. Well balanced between hops and malts, this beer certainly knows its role. One of the better pale ale's I've had."
"Flavor is biscuity and a touch nutty with some roasted flavors. Bitterness is light and with some orange hop notes. Malt profile lingers nicely and coupled with the fine carbonation give the beer a nice feel. Quite drinkable, not too sweet and offering some intriguing and morphing flavors and smells as the beer warms. Nice."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied, pretty smooth beer overall, but nothing to write home on. It does have some flavor and goes down quickly/easily, so I'd call it pretty drinkable."
"Pours a light clear golden amber with a thin foamy head. Appears to have good carbonation. Smells of citrus hops and hints of grapefruit. The taste is of an overly bitter ale, the flavours of the alcohol are strong. Has a surprising sharp hop bite for a pale. Medium mouthfeel showing a slightly chewy taste and watery feel on the palatte. Overall a decent strong ale, neat bottle but I'd be more inclined to take other Anchor beers over this."
"D - I don't drink it often, but when I do, I am always stoked on the fresh, refreshing and unique flavor."
"Drinkability: refreshing and tasty; what more do you need in a pale ale? I haven't see this beer around much up here, so I'm glad I finally had a chance to taste it. I just wish I could get it on a more regular basis."
"Bottle pours a golden yellow thats mostly clear, but just a slight hint of a haze to it. Lots of foam as well. Theres a bit of a hop taste up front with a faint piney finish. Its very bland though. The aftertaste and mouthfeel lacks finish. Its not bad or anything, and could be sessionable. The flavour could use a little more though."
"This brew has class - neither overly hoppy nor overly sweet, it maintains a fairly dry taste and a fragrant aroma. The hops impart an almost citrus flavor. I admire the label almost as much as the color of the beer itself. The craftsmanship places this above the average microbrew. This beer is just elegant. It expresses such a balance of flavor that it's hard not to enjoy."
"D- Good beer, and pretty refreshing. It has many good characteristics going for it, but it didn't achieve as much balance, IMO, as I would have liked. Above par though."
"After allowing this one to warm up a little bit, the aroma opens up very nicely, and both the aroma and flavor display a very complex hop palate. The beer is definitely hoppy, but not unpleasantly so. Overall, Anchor manages to deliver a tasty IPA, creating a complex hop palate, rather than just beating you over the head with hops. Quite good."
"All around it's a nice subdued APA with all of the flavours but not much strength. Very drinkable, but still average given the competition."
"Pours a very nice, hazy, light-orange with a fluffy, pearl white head. Good retention and lacing throughout. Aroma is a bit mild. Definitely some citrus, orange and grassy notes. Unlike most APAs, the hops dominate this one. A lot of fruity hops. Orange and lemon dominate and also some pine and grassy hops in there. Some sweet malt comes in at the finish, but the hops linger on in the aftertaste. More mild hop flavor, but could be closer to an IPA than APA."
"On-tap at Tyler's Taproom served in a keep the glass Anchor pint glass a crisp pale orange with a thin off white head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is crisp citrus hops and mild sweet pale malts. The taste is a nice balance of sweet malts and citrus hops. The beer is quite light, crisp, smooth and refreshing. This is a very enjoyable pale ale, just as good as I remember it."
"Overall: A very good, promising beer."
"D - High. Even higher for a fresher bottle. Decent hop fix with not filling you up too much."
"Another solid beer from Anchor, which I might even like better than their flagship lager. Smooth drinking, nice flavor and feel."
"Big, creamy off-white head, easily three fingers to start before slowing dissolving off, moderate dimpling and credible amount of lacing streaks left behind. Gentle gauziness to the zinc orange color, fades to a dark yellow at the rims, transparent enough to see the scattered bubbles rising. Apricot and peach fruit scents strong with sourdough bread, pepper and green grasses to give it erectness in the nostrils, the orange citrus downplayed some, the malts stay off to the side, same for the pinch of honey, except for the fruitiness appears to prefer getting dirty in the earth. Medium-bodied with attractive firmness, so much so that it can afford to be slightly over-carbonated with no ill effects. The bitterness clearer here, gives you a strong twist with lemon to grapefruit pith, grass and leafy forest scrub, pepper, even the pine notes seem sour. The floral element naught but a flourish to the apricot, peach pit flavors. There might even be some estery notes underneath there somewhere. Even nearing room temperature does not sweeten appreciably. Well-crafted, likely more as a ""food beer"" than for casual chugging."
"The flavor is more biting than a regular Pale Ale, and that makes it all the more enjoyable. Some citrus smell, some bitter taste, mostly just an easy drink. A crisp and clean finish and there's nothing at all unpleasant to be found."
"Overall - Cheers to Anchor brewing for a great APA! I'd love to try this on tap sometime. If a nice, balanced pale ale is what you're after, look no further."
"Conclusion: A very nice example of an American Pale Ale. Well balanced, nicely bitter, but not over the top. Wouldn't pick it up all the time as if I'm drinking a form of pale ale I generally prefer Bitters or IPAs, but this is quite solid."
"D: There's a lot of hop character to be had in this APA and the gravity of the beer shows it's got a study malt backbone as well. Fairly complex and ""big"" even for an APA at 6% ABV. I'd have a couple again for sure."
"D - I really wish there was a bit more malt to balance the beer out a bit. The hop flavors are very nice and it's very drinkable and refreshing. I could probably toss back 2-3 of em especially with a meal. A very good Pale Ale everybody should try at least once, I'd definitely drink this one again but I can't say I'd buy it again as I prefer others over this one."
"d: Very refreshing. I don't usually like highly carbonated beers but it really works in this one. Excellent pale ale."
"I wasn't expecting it to be so colorful. Surprises are just another turn-on. The taste is somewhat crude, but it wasn't offensive by any means. It tastes much darker than it looks."
"goes down ok. I enjoy the aftertaste a bit more than the initial flavors, though. meh."
"A true classic beer... Can't believe I've never rated this before!"
"Very drinkable, well-balanced APA. Hoppy, but not too hoppy, and too refreshing. Will be reaching for this one regularly."
"drinkability is good, could easily throw a few of these back.."
"A tasty beer with a bit of interest to it. The hop character is just a little bit weird but it's a good beer nonetheless. 3.75"
"Overall- Very well balanced, extremely drinkable. Refreshing. People say it is not as hoppy as it ""should"" be, I say its a DAMN GOOD BEER!"
"Drinkability- very easy going down. I could drink a few of these in a sitting. The flavor does not get too overwhelming, but I don't think that I would want to pound these all night."
"D- I think after 3 of these I would be done."
"Drinkability: I could easily go for another of these. It's interesting to make you want more, and yet refreshing enough that you're not overwhelmed by all the flavors. I think this would go well with food, but I think I'd rather just enjoy it as is, by itself with nothing else to interfere with the flavors."
"D: this beer really drank quite welll but was a little too sweet for a pale ale, don't get me wrong it was still a tasty beer."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, this beer will throw you off though since you will originally think its an ipa until you taste it. very interesting"
"I've never had this beer on draft, however I hear that it is available some places in the U.S. so I will be hunting for it! And trust me, you should too..."
"D-this is a decent pale ale, well balanced with a fair amount of sweetness and nice presence of bitterness. the medical flavor in the taste is slightly off but other than that a good beer."
"Bottle - Pours golden color with thick white head - I like a little foam. Good hoppy nose. Citrus, smack of grapefruit, hint of orange peel. Sourdough. Good balance of malt. When I get an APA like this one, and perhaps Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, I really am a big fan of the style (APA). Kudos to the brew master. This would go well with Mexican food and crawfish etouffee."
"D: a very easy drinking beer that i could have a lot of."
"Anchor Liberty ale is a bright straw like shade of yellow. the frothy white head pours a good two fingers thick. I let this beer sit for a good minute or two and the head hasn't moved. NICE!! A big aroma of floral hops fills the nose and a little grassy. those little grassy notes that are barely noticeable in the nose really come through on the taste. I get some lemon zest too. The finish hangs out just for a little while which is perfect for this ale."
"Very nice light amber color with a small head and better than average lacing. Heavy citrus scent. At first I thought lemons, but now I am thinking of a more sweeter fruit. More hops than I was expecting. Nice malt flavor. Tastes like sweet honey and a kick of hops to go with it. A bit of a bitter finish. Carbonation works well with this beer, thus it goes down very smooth. Happy I finally tried this one. Have been an Anchor Steam man for a while, but never got around to tying the Liberty. Guess I'll hit the porter sometime soon."
"12oz bottle drank into a pint glass at Bricks for my buddy's birthday...Pours a darkish light brown not very clear, dark for a pale ale, night light head good retention...The taste and aroma are both light citrus to start, some malt backbone, but not a ton of hops. Lightly hoppy but want a little more. Not a bad little pale ale, nothing special though."
"D: Good ABV, nice balanced brew.... Not a bad little beer on a hot summer day.... A good APA... worth a shot."
"Just a wonderful American Pale Ale. You just get an experience with this beer that I can't explain. It's not over the top. It's just a fantastic beer. This always hits the spot. This beer is great in any season. One of my favorite PA's."
"Overall this is a pretty easy drinking and well balanced ale that is a bit drier than many of this style."
"d-Wow...this stuff is fantastic...I could drink it all day. I would love to find it on tap somewhere but will settle for now in bottles."
"I used to prefer the Anchor Steam, but this stuff is way more refreshing and drinkable. Excellent APA!"
"Pours a fizzy yellow amber, with a relatively thin head. Soft aroma, a slight scent of hops with a mild yeast touch. Good moderate flavor, good balance of hops and malt, definitely an ale. From what I remember tastes better on draft than in bottle, but still worth picking up a 6 pack."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable pale ale, although this has a higher ABV than most session beers. A well-balanced beer I would enjoy having again and something that is a satisfying drink overall."
"I'll say this is a good all-around APA. Not necessarily the best but a solid contender and a good go-to beer."
"D- Not an exceedingly great pale, but I would recommend it if you come across it."
"A: 3.5, S: 3.0, T: 3.5, M:3.5, D:4.0"
"Mouthfeel is light with a crisp amount of carbonation."
"D - A nice pale ale, but not the best I've ever had. Very drinkable and enjoyable, but I think I'd rather have a SN or Mirror Pond."
"D: Of all American Ales, this is by far one of the best. I can just think of perfect balance with Liberty Ale."
"Drinkability: Great balance and a pretty arch typical representation of the APA style. Pairs well with a number of dishes. Unique and irreprehensible. I could see myself having this as a luxury session beer."
"good beer."
"I really enjoyed the taste of this beer although for me there was a slight unpleasantness on the palate after swallowing. I'm not sure if it was the beer or just me. Something I'll definitely have to try again."
"I'm surprised that I've never reviewed this beer. I'm also surprised that this is called an APA on BA. I've always heard of it as an India Pale Ale. In any case, i'm not sure where the line is drawn. It's a little more ""India"" than Sierra Nevada Pale and a little less than the more extreme versions of IPA's. Light gold to straw color. Good carbonation with a lingering white head. Aroma is perfect west coast hops and flavor is bitter but not outrageous. A great beer for any time and a great gateway beer."
"D - A very solid APA all the way around which should be no surprise from Anchor... Sophisticated and unique... Stands as a wonderful example of the style... Nothing pretentious about this one..."
"Great Beer."
"First time I've one of these in a while and I'm reminded how nice of a little beer this is. While it's not truly outstanding in any aspect, it's pretty good all around. The beer is just above average in all categories, and is a welcome go-to option when choices are limited."
"In summary, a very nice beer but comes off as an American IPA to me as much as a pale ale-- in any case, I can think of many that I would place above this one."
"d- very nice apa, better than most that i've had, this would be great on a summer day, very refreshing."
"Over all, this is an excellent Pale Ale. I love how it's dry-hopped enough to bring out the color and bitterness in the hops, but maintains excellent drinkabilty and doesn't over power it's malt."
"This brew pours an impressive clear golden hue almost pilsner looking with really decent carbonation that leaves a smoggy three finger head that slowly recedes to two and leaves heaps of frothy sticky lacing,the smell of this brew is very herbal with alot of spicy,apricot hops and a light caramel malty background,it has an above average mouthfeel that feels very sessionable while still being able to leak its true tastes with a rather smooth caramel/toffee malty start that finishes with a hint of passionfruit hoppy bitterness but the bitterness is not much for a hophead like me and to be honest makes it a very easy brew to session on and would drink again if i saw."
"Pretty tasty little ale here, I cannot believe it has been more than a couple years since last I had it. Delicate but commanding floral and herbaceous hop flavors. Plenty of bitterness on the finish too. Malts are clean and light and supported by a biscuity, earthy yeast undercurrent. While the blend of hop varietals may not be my favorite of all time, it is clearly a well crafted and delicious pale ale. It is almost unfathomable to think that there was this great of an American craft beer available in 1975. Fritz, you are truly tha man!"
"D) A great beer and truly an excellent example of this type -- Pale Ale"
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and crisp, but a little syrupy."
"I appreciate anchor brewing, but this not my favorite of their offerings."
"Bottled on: [no date given]"
"On tap at the brewery in San Francisco. Poured into a small 6 ounce fluted glass. This beer is dry hopped but I'm not picking up a huge hop aroma. Taste is crisp, nice bitterness, nice flavor. Nothing too outstanding, but pretty tasty. Wish this one was just a touch hoppier."
"overall: well crafted and really good enjoyable beer that holds true to the style of the brewery. I cant explain this but the brewery has its own style that is really kind of cool. it makes me want to try more from them and I am sure I will."
"I want to abuse this beer. Damn good."
"Slainte."
"An interesting take on the style. Usually less sour, i think."
"D: Really good."
"This would be great with Asian cuisine in my opinion, particularly sushi. It is somewhat similar in style to Asahi, but it has a great deal more flavor. Very nice brew!"
"Pleasant and drinkable American-Style pale ale. The taste is dominated by American hops, but is more herbal and piney than bitter (there's some nice bitterness too, but it's not as over-the-top as some beers). The best part of this beer is the mouth-feel -- it's thick and oily, and really works well with the herbal hop flavor."
"drinkability - refreshing, leaves a bit of a dry finish on the mouth"
"D - A very drinkable APA. Complex enough to make you want more, but not overwhelming or intimidating. Light and crisp, so definitely refreshing and satisfying."
"What an excellent beer -- I really want to believe this is what beer used to taste like. Lots of hops, but so well worked into the whole product it doesn't seem forced. As other reviewers have noted this is in the same class as Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, but I might give the edge to Anchor Liberty owing to its overall more uniform taste and that IMO the ""gestalt"" is just better. I'm also a fan of Steam -- Anchor is a class outfit."
"D-The medicinal notes really get in the way for me. I'm wondering if I might have gotten an old bottle."
"Drinkability - Nice spring or summer beer. Could definitely have a few of these after mowing the lawn."
"Reviewed from my notes. Poured from high above into the center of a 16 ounce fluted glass at the Lion's Pride. Liberty has a dirty, tarnished gold color. The gravity pour gave it a huge white foam head that has created a mountain of foam on top of the glass. As it settles, it leaves behind lots of patchy lace. The liquid is translucent and there isn't too much carbonation rising within. The aroma is very good, with lots of grassy and citrus hop scents. It's a little earthy as well. It isn't exceptional, very very solid for the style. The beer, once I finally taste it, makes me think of a hoppy graham cracker. It's a little bitter, a little sweet, and there are pleasant hops throughout. This is a excellent hoppy pale ale. It has a medium body. The carbonation is at a level where I can really feel it, especially when I swallow. It leaves behind a bitter and sticky coat. It isn't overly sweet though. I find Liberty to be exceptionally drinkable. It could very well be the textbook example of a drinkable hoppy pale ale (even moreso that Sierra Nevada Pale). This beer is good in any situation where craft beer is welcome, in any amount."
"A nice, easy drinkin' APA."
"Drinkability - I thought the pricing was a bit steep. Now that I've had one, I can easily see myself revisiting it. Makes me wanna enjoy it on the back porch, which I think I'm going to do right now."
"cheers!"
"D - I've had this beer so many times, I can't believe I'm just getting around to reviewing it. This beer is very well made, and satifies my craving for a good beer in a low key environment. This beer is not extreme, it is not something people rave about, but when it comes down to it, it is very good, just subtle. The taste is great, and the mouthfeel is awesome. I will be drinking this again."
"Deep golden orange in hue with a huge meringue head. The retentive white froth leaves behind a patchy lace on the walls of my glass. Bready malt aroma also shows big fruit and floral notes. It's a very simple and mild aroma, but very clean and inviting. Nice toasted bread flavour, and just a little bit nutty. Hops provide flavours of peach, pineapple, citrus, and pine. Medium bitterness and tangy citrus linger and fade away slow in the aftertaste. Medium body and fine carbonation give a soft, smooth mouthfeel. Its well defined malt character is enough to match it's juicy hop flavour. A well crafted and dangerously drinkable pale ale."
"D: This is a true classic. This to me looks and tastes like a beer. I love all kinds of styles, this type isn't even my favorite, but when someone says ""beer"" this is what I think of. Extremely drinkable."
"D - Excellent drinkability overall. A great pale ale up there with Sierra Nevada."
"Enjoy!"
"An apparently well liked beer in the States but I don't see it. Looks fine though. The aromas were a little too strong in the disinfectant kind of hop way. I'm not talking about pine-like hop resin, I mean it smells like I'm drinking it in a hospital toilet. On the palate it didn't get much better; some nice malt nuttiness, angry bitterness and astringently dry. Somewhat unbalanced too. Lacking body and direction. I didn't hate it but I did drain pour it-only because I had too many other good beers to get through to drink any more of it."
"DRINKABILITY: My go-to APA, and not just because it is a San Francisco brewed beer. Just a great beer for all seasons."
"A delicious brew. More of a malt smell than hops, but a dry hops flavors shines in the taste. This is a complex tasting beer, with flavors ranging from dry hops overtones, to malty, minty undertones, with subtle peach or citrus fruit esters and mineral water sharpness mixed in to boot. A very good beer, and one I would highly recommend. This is an all-purpose pleaser: good for serious flavor, and equally good for a refreshing thirst quencher, or a monster blowout session. A true classic. No other beer tastes quite like any in the Anchor line. The Anchor brewery deserves tremendous respect for being one of the first great microbreweries and still one of the best in existence."
"At first whiff I smelled freshly vacuumed carpet. Has a metallic tones clinging to the malt which I find in a lot of Cal ale yeast beers when really cold--mellowed out to a pleasant biscuit when warmed up. Cascade-ish grassy, spicey hop. Crisp and refreshing with fruity malt balanced by a grassy spicy hop. Dry, fizzy, champagne-ish carbonation."
"It's smooth and easy to drink, and covers all the bases well, good beer."
"Pours a pale yellow-orange colour with thick white had. Little bit of lacing. Smells of citrusy hops and bread. This has a nice bitterness from the hops, with some malty sweetness to go with it. Nice level of carbonation. Classic beer that I can drink anytime."
"Pours a nice golden orange-yellow with a healthy, thick, foamy, white head. Aroma is filled with sweet malt/grain with hints of citrus. Taste was pretty strong. There was sweet malts, citrus, and the hops going down; each pretty distinct. Good body and carbonation. I popped this one after coming back from a 10 mile ride. wonderfully refreshing, definitely an anytime beer."
"Overall a pleasant surprise. Anchor beers are so easily overlooked with all the choices in the stores but they are usually very solid. This is certainly one of them."
"Not a bad beer, but standing in line behind a good number of better ones."
"What makes this beer a personal favorite is how versatile the beer is for me. It can be refreshing on summer afternoons or comforting for cold winter evenings and is a constant stable in my fridge. It is a great beer for people that love pale ales and has been enjoyed by company that do not enjoy pale ales. I have yet to find a American Pale Ale I like better."
"Had this a ton of times, might be my favorite if the Anchors. Pours a hazy pale color with nice frothy head that leaves great lacing on the glass. Tastes slightly sweet up front and lingers into a tad bit of bitterness. No real aftertaste, but does have a nice malt finish."
"D/O- Drinking about 3 or 4 of these would leave me one happy camper. Good example of when session beer meets something that actually tastes like something worth drinking."
"I'd say snpa isslightly better but it's close."
"This is an excellent, well crafted ale from Anchor, a classic American craft brewery. This beer will always be welcome in my fridge."
"Anchor Liberty Ale pours a slightly hazy light copper. The aroma is bright, fresh hops, a bit citrusy, herbal and grassy. Sweet malt breaks up a bit of the grassy hop flavor and leads nicely into the bitterness. The flavor is almost creamy. I would say this leans towards the IPA range of pale ales. It's a delicious beer and a classic for sure."
"I could definetly buy a six-pack, hit the sofa and watch a bad movie. The beer would make the movie much better!"
"Billlowing 2 finger+ head, medium slow dissipation, significant lacing. Clear golden body, a wee bit of visible carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Light nose, lemony, yeasty, flowery hops. Taste is interesting and balanced, citrusy, light bready malts perhaps a bit of crystal re ripe melons, finish is faintly bitter,k dry. Creamy mouthfeel with sweetish finish, not cloying. I could see this as a really effective summer quencher, good with BBQ. I thought the general lack of caramel malts was interesting for the style. An extremely well crafted beer, just what you'd expect from this quintessential American brewery. Outstanding."
"Pours golden orange-yellow with a white head. The aroma is grassy and resiny hops, but is a little faint. The flavor is citrus and grassy hops. There is medium bitterness with a nice orange flavored aftertaste. There is also some light pine flavors in the beer. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Lots of hops up front. Fairly citrusy with nice hop bitterness. There is also a fair amount of malt to balance it out. Very nice flavor over all. Medium bodied with a crisp, dry finish."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer, seems to suit the style, but not my favorite."
"This is a benchmark of the style and the granddaddy of them all. Are there APAs I like more and would like to drink more than this? Well, yeah. But it's hard to forsake your first love, which must explain why I keep coming back to this beer year after year."
"Overall this is one of my favorite ales"
"Carbonation is slightly low, but the body is light to medium in texture, despite the big hoppy and balanced flavors. I wouldn't mind having a few more of these in the fridge. If I could get a case, this would be a go-to beer for me."
"Tasted 10 february 2010, at 12 pm, while watching the game of FC Bayern for the DFB Cup. Once served in a pint glass. Look: Amber color, a finger of foamy head, wth good lacing; Smell: Citrus hops and fruit essences, predominant guava and orange, slightly malt cookie; Taste: Pine-Wood and earth hops, plus a cookie-scented malt, the fruit essences of the smell lost; Mouthfeel: Dry, woody and very bitter, medium to robust body, almost creamy, low carbonation; Drinkability: Excepciontal American-freedom beer."
"D - easy drinking and great tasting ale."
"A clear dark golden color pour with a huge lasting frothy offwhite head , lots of jagged lacing left , light carbonation. Aroma is zesty , spicy and floral light butter and biscuty malt notes , even hints of cherries. Flavor is crisp clean and hoppy , nice floral tones with a lightly toasted pale malt backbone ,nice light sweetness with a good level of bitterness and long dry hoppy finish , medium body , crisp clean mouthfeel ,and quite sessionable , a very good APA , nice ."
"D: I love it. I'm surprised it's under the APA label since it is quite hoppier than alot of IPAs. None the less it would be my number one session beer. It's not to hoppy, but not to subtle - nice middle ground bursting with flavour."
"Mildly bitter up front with light, sweet malts. Heavy biscuit, some honey and lemon. Pretty heavy carbonation works for a light bodied beer. Incredible drinkability--a fair amount of flavor and complexity with a low ABV. Light and refreshing."
"D: I am enjoying this beer very much right now, and have any other time that I drink it, which is not very often, but I do plan on keeping this in my regular rotation, for it is a great beer for the end of this long week. I recommend this beer for anyone that wants to have a solid drink choice around. Would make a great choice for one of the beers that you stock your cooler with for your next BBQ."
"D: Drinkable? To simply answer ""yes"" would be an understatement. Liberty is a classic American Pale Ale and I expect nothing less from one of America's finest and most revered breweries. It was one of the brews that introduced me to craft beer and it's still as good today as I remember it was 15 years ago when I drank my first. I shall not let myself go another 15 years before drinking another."
"Hey California: you sure know how to make ales!"
"Overall, an excellent APA that really highlights the style. Highly recommend. Rotation - avail here in TX. Good for couple six packs a year."
"A nice hoppy beer, suites both food (e g a steak and fries) and being on it's own."
"O: Excellent drinkability. Classic American Pale Ale. Recommended"
"Notes: I had my doubts, after I bought the beer, once I was able to decipher the bottling date code. However the brew feels outstanding, the hop profile is very rich, and there is not a minimal hint of skunkiness. I´ll try to be far more aware of this dating system when I pick it up in the future and see if there is a difference. Maybe a tad too hoppy to offer it as a PA to non-craf beer aficionados, but it is not too extreme, and works wonderfully."
"D: Would be a pleasure to put a bunch of these down."
"D. I could drink these beers all day long. Smooth and refreshing."
"Overall, what a lovely hop-heavy ale. I really enjoyed this one. Lovely, strong, well rounded taste. Its wonderful to see such a great beer come out of America, from a small brewery still making its beer by hand. Never had a better American beer than this one. Cheers to them for brewing it, and to anyone who picks up this beer and tries it."
"D - pretty drinkable, but the one-sided hop display starts to wear near the end of the first one. two is definitely my limit."
"Mouthfeel restrains itself down the home stretch, remains drinkable as anything. Strange to me the Anchor Steam gets all the notoriety, but I guess its more unique, but its not necessarily better when you don't give any points for history."
"Perhaps in the end it was a bit too mild for the heat of the curry but provided a refreshing accompaniment none-the-less."
"The taste is rather good for an American beer, sorry to say that it can not compete with the European styles. The hop gives this beer the taste i have noticed in more USA beers."
"I think Liberty is overlooked and under-appreciated by too many craft drinkers, myself included. We are quite fortunate to have it available at the LCBO. One reviewer said this beer used to be good but is now simply ordinary. I beg to differ. Liberty compares to the best of them, a delicious brew in its own right that has withstood the test of time. As one of the hoppiest beers and probably the best retail pale sold in the province, I plan to enjoy this more often. Thank you Anchor!"
"Overall, there is a very good reason why this beer is known as part of the start of the craft movement, and there is a reason why this beer is just as good today as it was way back when. Sorry dad, I might be drinking the other three in the fridge."
"Verdict: Back in the dark days, I'm sure it took a pretty exceptional beer to get people back into drinking the hoppy stuff. Liberty obviously fit the bill back then, and still holds up as a tasty brew today."
"OVERALL Medium bitterness, kinda dry, with modest complexity. Easy drinking quality ale."
"Cheers!"
"Typical in a good way. Very drinkable, too. For the cost, a very nice sessionable ale."
"D: This is a great session pale ale. I haven't had one of these in quite awhile, but I remember why I used to enjoy it so much."
"Great beer, well hopped, but still has excellent balance. Floral hop smell on the nose, makes you want to go back for more. Very drinkable for a well-hopped beer, could put 5 or 6 of these back without thinking twice about it. I think this is Anchor's flagship, not the Steam beer."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Has a great golden yellow clear color. I could smell the hops. The taste is sharp and crisp. I feel this is the granddaddy of all west coast ales and it is still one of the best ones out there. Respect this brew but even more important enjoy it."
"The mouthfeel is dry with a hoppy bite to it that adds some sharpness. Carbonation is moderate and doesn't stand out or get in the way. The drinkability is okay. It's a nice, hour long bomber. There isn't enough there for me to crave more, and it's a bit big to consider a simple session beer."
"Old school American IPA. Think it's the first IPA I ever did have. Great label too. Nowadays in comparison it's not that great, but still. Poured with a decent medium sized head and a little lace. Color is a hazy medium amber. Aroma is an earthy, slightly grapefruit hoppy, malty, spicey and a bit floral. Flavors about the same. Body is good and so is carbonation. Finish is a long hoppy bitter sweet. Could be a session."
"D - If I were in the right mood could do a few, but in the big bottle usually am going to limit this to one."
"D: Very easily drinkable. It goes down smooth, as the taste isn't aggressive. It's a very standard APA, however, it's missing that extra punch which puts some into that next level."
"Thanks Bobsy!"
"Hadn't had this one in years and was looking forward to it. Somewhat of a let down. The head was nice, the color was nice and the nose was hoppy with a little cake batter character. The taste wasn't spectacular but it was quality, nicely hoppy although it seemed like the choice of hops used was off. Little vanilla and pale malt, citrus hops bring the bitterness, a malt toastyness as well. Mouthfeel was a little too carbonated and I didn't really want any more after the first-it was time to move on, for good. Not because it wasn't drinkable, because it just wasn't anything special."
"M: Light, great level of carbonation."
"D- Very drinkable, nice beer. Along with Sierra Nevada, really sets the standard for the American Pale Ale style, crisp, refreshing, bitter, great beer."
"The best part of this beer is the bitter drying finish and the crisp mouthfeel. It's light and drinkable, a nice pale ale for sure."
"This is an excellent beer, flavorful but not trying to out-do or be the biggest in a certain category. 12 oz bottle to glass. Dark golden color, poured a huge head even though I thought I was being pretty gentle. Nice bright aroma(tart, not so much sweet), mostly hops coming through. Flavors are well balanced, not too sweet, a pretty bitter finish (I think some of the double IPAs cancel out some bitter with a huge malt attack...not happening here, the IBUs may not be as high but they aren't masked at all). Some mouth watering tartness. The carbonation is a little high, but just short of too much. All this and only 6% abv. Good job Anchor!"
"Pours a slightly hazy deep shade of golden with a fluffy white head that dissipates to form a cap but leaves lots of lace on the way down. Smells of citrus, caramel, maybe a bit of fruit. Taste is sweet with caramel, slight grain midway followed buy some fruit that seems like pear, lots of citrus to balance it out. Finishes sweet and slightly bitter. Nice nice balance. Body is medium to thick, mouthfeel is creamy, carbonation is crisp. Its been a while since I've had this one, too long really. I remember trying this 15 years ago and thinking how bitter it was, now I find it incredibly balanced. This is a great beer!"
"WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, GET OFF OF YOU'RE ASS AND GO GET A 6'ER AND ENJOY !!!"
"A fine brew and a great example of the style, but given its limited availability (and expense), will probably only sample occasionally. Nevertheless, a solid APA."
"The beer does not go down as easily as, for instance, many English pale ales. But it is not too complex and it is therefore a relaxing brew to drink."
"I've only ever had Anchor Steam, their Christmas Ale and this one from these guys. I hope they have a big line up of this quality."
"D=good, not overly bitter or sweet, yet still bold."
"D: Very drinkable but not much complexity beyond the first beer"
"D. Very drinkable. Good session beer. Not the most complex or extreme, but it doesn't need to be. Good at what it is, which is good pale ale."
"D - Leaves me wishing for better. As it warmed up, the finish started really getting in the way of the overall merriness. If you aren't a true hop-head (and I am not), chances are, this isn't a super drinkable beer for you, despite its great taste and complexity. I should take in account that I drunk a bomber bottle; perhaps, if I had a small one, the drinkability would seem better."
"Drinkability: This is pretty much THE original ale of the modern craft beer movement that spawned both the APA and IPA. Plus, it is fantastic."
"The smell is alright. A lot of lemon and some stinky grapefruit. Unfortunately, it is a little bit too overpowered by lemon. The malt sweetness is prevalent. The same can be said for the taste, with a light caramel sweetness that unbalances the lemon citrus notes. All in all, a very nice easy to drink beer, and one that I would consume again."
"Nice drinker, wouldn't mind having this again though nothing astounding. Solid all around."
"Such a pleasant and solid beer, these guys know what they're doing."
"(D)- A great beer that is a breath of fresh air from the normal; boring Miller/Coors/Bud products. Very well made and balanced all-around into a very easy drinking beer that I would gladly drink any day out of the year!"
"Pours a beautiful orange-amber with a foamy one finger head. I found the flavor to be sharp and a bit sour. The flavor also dies off very quickly with no lingering aftertaste. Some of that sharpness is probably coming from the alcohol, while AT 6% seemed even a little stronger than that. Overall, I was just not that impressed and I would not seek this one out again."
"Flavor is nice and bitter. This is a hoppy and dry pale ale, but not unbalanced by any means. There is a nice malt presence and yeasty earthiness. Hop flavor is spicy and herbal, with a touch of citrus. Mouthfeel is medium-light, carbonation is medium. Here's a truly american pale ale that drinks like an IPA. Good stuff."
"M/D: Mouthfeel was decently medium-bodied, but the flavor didn't have me running to go grab another one."
"D - a nice find. i like it a lot. could easily settle into 2-3 of these at a time. good job Anchor Steam!"
" Overall, very refreshing and drinkable-a lot of subtle flavors going on kept me coming back for more. A nice representation of the American pale ale style."
"notes and comments- i typically drink this beer once a year during the fourth of july. while i appreciate the beer, it's not my choice as a daily drinker."
"Final thoughts: Its a very light, clean, and easy drinking lightly hoped ale. It doesn't have much body or hop base, but its got a decent malt and enough hops. It doesn't try to do anything special, just a nice session beer. Its very crisp and refreshing. I would like something like this as a summer beer more than many summer style hefes (since IMO most American Hefes don't do it right)."
"D - This was my first Anchor offering and I was very pleased...one thing I didn't like was the inconsistency on the taste...but it was pretty balanced and a solid APA"
"Everything I'd expect from one of the founders of the craft brew movement. A beer that goes with lots of foods and drinks well on it's own."
"D-A very good APA. Very easy drinking. I could readily enjoy a whole six pack on a hot summer day into evening. One of my favorite APAs."
"Personally: One of the great beers, always have some in the fridge."
"Drinkability - I enjoyed this beer and could easily have a few. But you've got to watch that tricky 6% abv. It catches up to you after a few."
"D: Fritz Maytag sure knows what it's all about. I still haven't had a Anchor-beer that I didn't fall in love with"
"HV"
"Drinkability - good drinkability for an APA, however at 6%abv and high level of hoppiness your taste buds will fatique soon enough."
"D- A well balanced tasty, creamy ale. Enough flavours to make it enjoyable for a session and a creamy texture which is easy on the tummy!"
"While I can't say I was blown away by this beer, it is a very smooth, easily drinkable beer."
"This beer poured a light amber with copper highlights and a single-finger head. The smell is mostly some piney and grassy hops with a bit of malt. The taste reflects the smell, starting off with a solid malt backbone that's quickly taken over by some citrus and piney hops in a pretty good balance that don't linger on the palate. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some fine carbonation. This beer is surprisingly drinkable for an APA, with a bit of a bite but without being unpleasantly bitter. A good version of the style."
"D - Very high. Great session brew and a good 2nd step for those looking for their inner hophead."
"Poured with a large, frothy white head, with good lacing. Body was slightly hazy, and a dark-yellow color. Aroma was of average hops, with a light presence of alcohol as well. Mouthfeel was light-bodied and fairly thin, with a little oiliness to it. Soft carbonation and a bitter finish. Flavor was long-lasting of moderate bitterness and some nice citrus flavors, with a very dry finish. Slight taste of alcohol in there as well. Overall a very nice APA that is quite bitter, but enjoyable."
"This is one tasty beer. If you want to know what Cascade hops smell and taste like, buy a bottle of this stuff and give it a try."
"nice coppery orange colored ale with a lovely white-capped head. slim amount of retention and lacing. dominant aromas are malty and hoppy, not much else on nose. the taste is outstanding! this is the best american pale i've ever tried....has a wonderful balance of piney hops and malts, neither being overly aggressive, and just a bit bready underneath. i'd say it toes the line between an english pale and a hoppier apa. mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied....well carbonated, nice bitterness from the hops on finish but not overwhelming and quite refreshing. drinkability is high...could drink several in a sitting. very satisfying...hard to ask more from a beer, it really nails the style right on the head."
"A quality, enjoyable beer that is perfect for everyday drinking"
"D: A classic pale ale. If you like SNPA, you'll probably dig this as well."
"pours a nice tawny copper color with at least an inch of head. smells vaguely of bananas with a hint of floral hops. imparts a nice sweet taste at first, not too sweet, very pleasant with a bitter hop finish. mouthfeel is medium. goes down very smooth with a clean finish. overall a delicious ale that would make an excellent session beer."
"Poured into an Anchor pint glass. Appears a light copper color with a medium white head. Aroma of citrus mixed with grass and light cedar - very pleasent. Very crisp in the taste with lots of citrus - grapefruit and pine dominate and finishes quite dry, which I loved. A great session beer for me. Another good beer from Anchor - a great session beer."
"This is a very drinkable APA. I was surprised at how the malts almost outshine the hops. Very refreshing."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is high. It's easy drinking and well crafted. What else can you expect from a native Iowan named Fritz?"
"D. A beer that many could enjoy. Everything is in balance, nothing is over the top. Which can be good and bad, but overall this is a respectable pale ale."
"Definitely a great session beer"
"Like their Steam Beer, I can't seem to get in my body fast enough. I actually have to force myself to slow down and admire the simple beauty of this beer, it's that damn drinkable."
"Poured into a pint glass it pours a nice orange color with an almost copper hint to it. Has a one finger white head with some pretty decent retention. Leaves good lacing down the sides. Smells sweet, nothing to impressive but it's smells nice. Taste has a pretty apparent citrus taste to it, starts a little sweet and ends just barely bitter. Kind of has that typical Anchor taste to it but it's not as strong as some of their other beers. It's fairly hoppy, not crazy hoppy but it's nice, pretty balanced I guess. Pretty drinkable, not a high ABV and it's pretty good so I have no problem with this one. Not the best American Pale Ale I've had but it's still really good, I'd pick it up again."
"Not much smell to pick up on at all from my experience.. the biggest thing I picked up on is a very strong pale malt character.. the hops are there as well in balance, but the pale malt seems to really stand out the most, and this prevented it from being anything unique or too great.. its ok, definitely not bad. The mouth is light, sort of empty feeling and the drinkability is a question of whether you consider the term to mean ability to drink a lot of it or desire to drink a lot of it. If its the latter, then it suffers a bit."
"A great pale ale, very hoppy, bordering on the IPA line. A nice citrus and grassiness aroma and taste complement the light bready malt. Very good session beer, similar to SNPA."
"D - Anchor is in the top five of my breweries ever for good reason all their beers are approachable but amazing."
"Pale coppery sort of color. Soft white head that leaves some decent lacing. Ok aroma-somewhat floral and earthy. Great hop flavor. Not overly bitter or astringent just a solid hop flavor upfront. Touch of malty sweetness. Mildly fruity. Slight lingering bitterness. Good body. A great beer drinkablility wise. The flavor more then makes up for any flaws in color or aroma. I have loved this one for years. Still do so it seems."
"not a pale to overlook"
"Liberty ale, when very fresh, is one of my favorite session beers. It is perfectly integrated, with bright, fresh flavors, yet complex and refined, both in hop and malt character. A classic."
"Had this on tap at The Stable. Nice light amber color. Not a large aroma coming off the glass but a light grassy hoppy flavor. The taste was slightly sweet at first but then the hops bit and all was well. Not big flavors going on here but a nice balance and a crisp easy to drink beer that went well with dinner."
"Pours a crystal clear light orange color with 2 fingers of creamy white head that sticks around for some time and eventually leaves a fine layer around the glass. Aroma is very light grassy hops, caramel malt and some alcohol. The flavor is a good balance of malt and hops. Extremely light on the palate. The body is light and is almost a little too carbonated. This beer isn't one thing too fantastic about this beer. It's a decent beer."
"Liberty Ale was first introduced on April 18th, 1975 to commemorate the bicentennial of the famous ride by Paul Revere. Celebrate craft beers and your independence from mass marketed brews. Quality not quantity."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. The ale appears a hazed rich apricot color with about an inch of off white foam. The head settles to a thin layer within a few minutes leaving spotty lacing on my glass. Nose and flavor are of earthy, fruity hops, light peach, citrus, sweet bready malt. A bit more than medium bodied and amply carbonated for it's style. Crisp and quenching."
"Poured a cloudy orange w/ one finger white head and some lace. A good aroma of citric hops and a mix of sweet and bready malts. Medium-bodied and smooth, passes over quite tasty from sweet malts and a good range of fruit flavors. The hops not only give it that fruity tasty but lend themselves to a dry finish, which is a great balance for this beer. An easy drinking ale that I could have anytime."
"Decent pale ale with citrusy hop aroma and flavors. Also grassy, earthy flavors as well. Mild bitterness and plenty of carbonation bite. Sweet caramel malt dominates the malt profile. Overall - a better that average, drinkable pale ale that goes down smooth."
"Notes - I'm sure people are a little put-off by the lack of hops. But to think this was first brewed in 1974 is pretty amazing."
"An refreshing take on the American Pale Ale from these master brewers in San Fran. Wish I had visited the brewery when I was there a few summers back on vacation."
"D - Fairly drinkable beer overall. Has a decent amount of complexity and is pretty refreshing. Nothing mindblowing, but pretty good nonetheless."
"D: i love the artwork on the bottle and the beer goes own pretty smooth as well"
"I don't know why I hadn't tried this until now. This is a great pale, possessing a uniqueness while maintaining the balance this style dictates. My only real complaint is that the yeast seems to be a bit overdone."
"D - This is a nice drinking ale...I'll look for this again"
"4 an easygoing pale ale."
"D - Refreshing and not to overpowering with the hops. Leaves a faint dryness on the back of the tongue."
"D- It is not to filling and doesn't have so high an ABV that keeps you from drinking to many. You could easily put down a six of this."
"I wouldn't go saying this is my favorite beer but I will definitely buy it again."
"Drinkability is amazing on this one. Medium ABV makes this a beer of choice for bbq's. While not a hop head's APA I find this one well constructed and one of the main reasons I hold Anchor in high esteem as one of the worlds great brewers."
"D - Moderately drinkable, abv is manageable. Hop profile is probably not intended to be a total session beer as it can wear down the palette. carbonation is surprisingly not filling."
"D: This is a solid brew that I could drink repetitiously."
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. Each sip leaves me wanting more and I could easily finish off several of these without wanting to change a thing. This beer will have a place on my shopping list."
"Overall this is pretty good and right up there with SNPA. The downside for me is the price...I really can't justify paying more for Anchor when SN is just as good if not better. Taking price out of the equation, this is definitely a winner though."
"D: I like the 650ml bottles- saves me from having to open another one. A good, tasty drinkable APA."
"pours a little hazy golden with a 3 finger white head - leaves notches of lacing all down the galss- smells like every other anchor beer very macro - taste is so much better then the smell but all anchor beers taste similar with pear flavor up front - overall solid a apa with great drinkability"
"12oz bottle. Pours a clear orange-gold with a clingy white head. Smells of aromatic, piney, slightly floral hops and a hint of sweet maltiness. The malt becomes much stronger on the palate; while the hops decline, they do lend a very nice floral, citric character and give it a dry finish. Medium body with good carbonation. Nice and drinkable."
"D: Very easy to drink, but not a ton of flavor for an APA. I'd get Liberty Ale again, and I'd recommend it in a heartbeat (as I would with all Anchor year-rounds) for those just peeking their heads into the craft world for the first time."
"The medium body and even, tongue-coating carbonation make this an easy beer to down, and I could definitely have at least a few of these at a time."
"Drinkability - Nice beer, could have several of these."
"Apparently I'm in the minority as I didn't really enjoy this brew all too much."
"Seriously disappointing. Nice bubbly mouthfeel, though."
"D: Good feel and smell, but the taste comes up a little bit short. A solid brew, and one that I'll definitely try again."
"D - Amazing. It's as natural as drinking water."
"A nice offering from Anchor. This is closer to an English pale ale, in that the hops aren't so strong, etc. Like most Anchor beers this is a bit pricey, so I won't get it too often. But it is an enjoyable one and I'll be getting it again in the future."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A bit harsh, remaining quite prickly throughout. A tasty hop lover's APA that won't disappoint."
"Notes: Got a sixer as a gift. It'd been years since I'd had this beer. It won't be years before I buy it again, however. Forget SNPA as the quintessential APA; this may be it."
"D - Despite its unbalanced hoppiness its an easily drinkable brew. Good for a tasty refresher on a summer day I'd imagine."
"Pours orange amber in color with large sticky marshmallow head. A pleasing aroma of grains, citrus fruits, wet greens, hops. Flavors of light floral, greens, cereal (quaker oats, plain, aisle 7 in the market) and some sour notes that mingle with the hop bitter finish. Light in body and refreshing on a sunny day. A higher alcohol session for afternoons."
"Golden with a healthy amount of carbonation, off-white head (thick, but not dense as I'd like), and a tad hazy. Under-emphasized barley aroma, nothing interesting here. Clean and well balanced, with the right amount of hopping. A slightly bitter finish. It is reminiscent of a German lager. Medium-light bodied but with enough oomph to stand out. I also detect a bit of spice in the nose This would make a very good beer for warmer weather for those who aren't into wheat beers. It would also work well with Thai or Indian food."
"Pours clear and golden with thick white head, decent retention and lacing. Smell was slightly hoppy but a strong biscuity malt as well, almost ""bock-ish"" at first. Taste was slightly hoppier (piney hops) with a strong malt balance. The malt here seemed to be a dryer, bready malt which I'm not a huge fan of. Mouthfeel was fine, not light but not too heavy and it was easily drinkable. I think I'd take a SNPA over this though."
"NOTES: Good quality session beer. I highly recommend trying it."
"Pours a light amber color with a nice frothy white head. Scents of honey, flowers, citrus, and bread are coming from this. When taking my first sip, I got alot of biscuit first then some of the hops. Semi-citrusy, well balanced with the malt. Leaves a faint sweetness on the tongue. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"12 oz. Fairly golden pour, small bright white head. Floral citrus aromas. Taste is just a hint of malt, mostly citrus fruits, a little yellow raisin and piney hops. Would have liked some more grain or biscuit or something. Very clean light body. Good drinkability. Great refreshment on a warm day. Somewhere between a pale and an IPA, and pretty darn good."
"The only other brew I've had from Anchor Brewing is, as one might guess, Anchor Steam. Although Anchor Steam is good, it's funny how it's far more popular and accessible (at least here on the east coast it is), because I think this Liberty Ale is slightly more enjoyable for the masses."
"Eric"
"This is what I want to have in my hand as the days grow warmer. It may not be ground-breaking or especially distinctive, but for me, this is like the Mona Lisa of ""Beer Brand beer"". I love it."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This may not be as hoppy as some people like their beers (including me), that being said...this is a well crafted beer with some definite hop character."
"Pours a slighty cloudy orange golden color with thick head. Smells hoppy, spicy and fruity. A floral hoppy flavor with sweet malts and a little bite and bitterness in the finish. The carbonation is apparent and provides a spicy tingle on the tongue. I really enjoyed this beer, would definitely have another."
"Love this beer. Quintessential American Ale, indeed."
"Hazy aprocot color, impressive 2 inch head, tons of lacing. So far so good. Lot's of grassy + citrus hop. Picked up a bit of peach fruituness as well. Very crisp, loads of hop, but there is a malt backbone there that tries to balance things out somewhat by slipping in and out of the citrus hop tsunami. A bit too sharp on the tongue to rate it higher in the mouthfeel dept. A very good example of the style."
"America...Fuck Yea, back at it bitch, the red white and blue delivers the goods in true English style. A scientific approach to balancing hops and malt. The aroma was faint but compensated with clear, healthy body, lacing, and head. Apricot malt base to bitter tea hop bite. Excellent collaboration by both competing parties to create a light body ESB? An English mild on steroids? Who cares, a perfect example of what is possible if the foundation for a marriage is grounded. This couple of hops and malt are in it for the long run, with the malt being a bit of the bitch in this case. Refreshing, sessionable, braggable. What, what?!"
"From a 22 oz bottle purchased locally. Aroma is citrusy lemon/orange. Orange gold in color with a one-inch white head. Flavor is lemony and a little oxidized. Malt is a little one-dimentional amd a little cardboard in there. Flat body and lacks richness. This is a bad bottle. I've had this beer before and I know it's much better."
"I actually liked this one much better out of the bottle... This had a slight hoppiness to the aroma that seemed well balanced with the malts... The taste got old fairly quickly on this one. It could have been old or something... Sorta middle of the road brew for me on tap... I loved this in the bottle..."
"It is pale/golden in color with a nice creamy head. Smells a lot like floral and herbal hops. The taste has a lot of citrus hops and some nice sweet caramel and fruity malts. It has real nice balance. Good medium body and mouth feel. It is very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is right where it should be. All things combined makes this a very good beer. I could drink quite a few of these in one sitting."
"The connection is greater than that these styles originated around that area of the country. The idea of upping the alcohol and cramming pale ales with gluttonous amounts of hops (in essence making the beer 'bigger, stronger, better') is undeniably reflective of an American mentality. As its name would suggest, there's nothing more American than a Liberty Ale."
"This is a very nice example of the style, and I will definitely enjoy it again."
"D- I was kind of surprised by this one. Really good and easy to put back a few at a time."
"D,this is a wonderful APA ,i drink this beer as often as i can .it`s very good, if you never had it go get this beer and make it a regular ."
"Pretty good flavor though not too strong. Easy to drink."
"as it warms, the hops pop out. yes, compared to the hophead tsunami out there, this is 'tame'...but tame is another benchmark of the high art. in other words, it isn't tame. it's refined and will still very likely kick any unsuspecting, disrespectful brewheads' *&%$##^* ! ;)"
"D - I could drink this all day. Pleasing aroma and tastes makes me want more."
" Great crisp and clean mouthfeel with a perfect hop profile. Drinkability puts light Macros to shame. Give your Bud light loving friends one of these, perhaps one of them will appreciate this nearly perfect APA."
"My first Anchor beer and I am impressed. I was shore if I would enjoy this beer but it ended up being quite tasty and was easy going down."
"Hazy Yellow. 3 finger head. Smells of citrus hop. Medium mouthfeel. taste hops up front, bit of sweet malitness in the middle, and finishes with a little bitterness. Pretty good ale. maybe a touch to bitter for me to enjoy more than one at a time though."
"I took my time in drinking this one and after an hour I found that the beer had still managed to retained not only a slight head but good carbonation. Liberty Ale is, in my opinion, best enjoyed when given time to slowly warm. Start with one out of the fridge and sip slowly over the next 30 - 40 minutes."
"I could definitely down a few of these to say the least. The hop shock makes this a very interesting and enjoyable beer."
"Overall: Very good pale ale, lots of flavor and a nice dry finish. Moderate carbonation and highly drinkable. Could have sworn this was an IPA."
"Have to say this is definitely one of my favorite beers over the past 2-3 months. Bottle pour into Stella glass. Hazy golden with substantial off-white head. Excellent lacing remaining throughout. Aroma - wonderful citrus, Cascade hops, grassy notes. Excellent taste and IMO a very well-balanced offering of an APA. Sophisticated yet very drinkable and refreshing. Not too dry or bitter, just right for me. Top notch - Cheers!"
"MF&D - the beer is a tad bit thin and the carbonation is just not right for some reason, I think it could be a bit more dense. nothing bad to say."
"D: Drinks wonderfully. Would go well with a meal."
"Drinkability is good with this beer that is well balanced and more subtle with the hops than many other versions of this style."
"Drinkability- overall a pretty good tasting and interesting pale ale, similar flavor to that of the sierra nevada pale if you are a fan of that give this one a try, one i will have to try again as I found this to be pretty tasty hoppy enjoyable pale ale beer, highly drinkable good session brewski"
"medium body, though ever so slightly thin or watery. moderate carbonation can be fluffy."
"Well balanced the resin may be off, for my taste, or too much tea flavor other than that a good session beer if the crisp carbonation is tolerable."
"What can I say, nothing to snail-mail my grandpa about but a solid American Pale Ale all around."
"Poured golden with white head that laced, had some nice looking active carbonation going on. The smell was hoppy with some citrus scent. The taste was bitter from the hop packed potion. It is light and crisp with good aftertaste. I couldnt see myself drinking these all the time, but it was refreshing and worth a try once in a while."
"Pours a clear light golden color with a minimal head that quickly dissipates to nothing. Smell is slightly hoppy. There's a bit of light fruit in the nose as well. Taste is crisp and hoppy. Comes across very clean and refreshing. Not a hop-bomb, but decent in it's own right. A sessionable beer, but nothing to get excited about. Would be a very nice summertime patio beer."
"Another solid beer from AS. Very drinkable. This was my only one, but I would have loved to have more to enjoy."
"Ive liked everything I had from Liberty so far, so I tried their flagship beer. Pours a cloudy orange with a nice fluffy head and tons of lacing.. off to a good start. Smell is quite hoppy.... moreso than I was expecting for a pale ale. First gulp of this was outstanding.. nice creamy, mouthfeel to it that just bombards your mouth with sweet, delicious beer flavor. Taste is slightly dry and leaves you craving more. This is a great beer and when I'm looking for a nice six pack to have on the weekend I will be choosing Liberty Ale!"
"Overall: Enjoyable, neat label and concept ...good marketing. Good Drinking!"
"Good quaff. Very nice atmosphere. No complexity of flavor, but a nice hoppy pale ale with a formidable, but not offensive feel. Good quaff."
"Overall a nice change of pace from the typical west coast APA. Focuses more on the bittering hops and yeast than the usual aroma bombs. Worth a try for sure, this is not my favorite APA however that is just me. I know this beer is so highly regarded for a reason and while I gave it a modest score (based on other opinions) I think every beer geek needs to try this one, it is after all a micro brew classic for a reason."
"D: liberty just freed my flavor palate. Top notch stuff and this brewery continues with awesome stuff. I can drink this all the time....ding ding ding!"
"Bright tangerine orange, noticeable carbonation, 1/2 inch of foamy but not thick head. Fruity notes on the nose, a little floral character to the hops. Taste is a mellow blend of citrus hop bitterness and biscuity sweetness. The hops are a little subdued for an APA. The warmth of alcohol chases the bitter and sweet flavors, provides a pleasant contrast. Extremely dry finish. This might be one of my favorite pale ales--exceptionally nice flavors and a great body/mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: The flavor was very subtle and the aftertaste off putting. The carbonation left a foamy feeling in the mouth. For me, the beer was not as enjoyable as expected."
"A fairly well rendered, and tasty brew - maybe not the headiest of IPAs from their native turf, but quite drinkable all the same. I could see going with this as a party sixer for slow sippin' all night, with the aim of keeping my palate intact for other pursuits."
"Drinkability: A bit too over-represented in its bitterness. Personally, I would've liked it if the fruitier and sweeter notes were a bit more pronounced, but then again it sort of fades at a higher temperature."
"Overall, I'll have to revisit this in the future to see if freshness held me back.."
"4.0 D: One of the more drinkable beers I've come across. Can easily session this."
"D. Another quality beer from the anchor brewery, though I think their Christmas Ale is lighter than in past years."
"This is my drinking beer and watching football beer. And yes President Ford, I do like beer and Nachos."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer for me. I can enjoy them one after another."
"Poored from stubie brown in to regular pint glass man does it look good a medium gold huge head fell quickly in to film great lacing smell of some hops light malt more bitter than I would like from an APA but what do you do other than that very drinkable solid beer."
"D: This is a drinkable beer by any measure, clean flavor, reasonable abv, and can cater to hops and malt at the same time"
"Pours a cloudy, dark golden color. 5/4 inch head with good retention and good lacing. Smells strongly of hops and fruity aromas. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Smooth and thick/chewy mouth feel. There was an extremely high amount of carbonation that inhibited the drinkability a little. Tastes strongly of fruit along with some hop bitterness. Overall, the taste was lacking, in my opinion. With the appearance and smell, I was really looking forward to this beer, but the flavor just wasn't there in the concentration I was hoping for. Still a pretty good beer though."
"Good beer to kick back with and have a few. Unassuming and refreshing. Balanced and tasty. Give me Liberty, or... ah forget it. I'm sure someone's used it already anyway. Cheers!"
"d - Pretty drinkable, not sure I'd grab a 6-pack of it but I'd drink it again if given the opportunity. Definitely a beer I would hand a friend as a transition into the style, not overpowering with bitter hops but enough to get a feel for it."
"The body of the beer is creamy, smooth and easily drinkable. This is a great pale ale, one of the best. I'm surprised it took me this long to try it out of all the Anchor beers, but I'm glad I did."
"Crystal clear pale yellow with a fluffy head, lots of lace. Smells a bit like hay or grass, in a good way. Taste sweet and with a mild spicy bitterness. A little bit over carbonated for me gives me the burps. It's a great drinker, one of my go to session beers. I love this stuff."
"Overall, this is one of those beers that you can't go wrong with. The balance of it truly is its defining characteristic - the harmony of the ingredients is readily apparent. My single complaint is that it looses some fizz in the final fourth of the beer."
"Appearance is outstanding on this one. thick, fluffy white 2 finger head that left a constant lace all the way down. smell is slightly hoppy with some earthy tones. Taste is excellent with an initial hoppy bite with a sweeter, very smooth finish. Drinkability is quite high here with a lower ABV. I could drink this stuff on tap all day long!"
"Overall, for the price of the beer, and cool vintage label, I really hoped for more. Maybe turn up the floral smell a hair and give the hops more of a punch. Still, it was very drinkable and the 6% abv makes it a good selection for a session."
"D: A very nice APA, I wish there was a little more character to the hops. Well worth trying."
"D-I liked this beer a lot. the flavors were quite stimulating--i would gladly drink more of these."
"Highly drinkable. Probably the best American Pale Ale I've drank."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"Great beer!"
"Pours orange with a small white head. Nose of spice. Tastes fair- dry, some hops but nearly as many as I expected. This isn't a great pale ale. This is the second Anchor beer I've had that's disappointed me, I doubt I'll be trying any more of their brews."
"It pours a dark amber orange with a fluffy light tan head and some decent lacing action on the glass. The nose picks up a pretty floral scent. The flavor is a great balance between the slightly biscuity, slightly sweet malt, and the great floral and slightly piney hops. I detect a little orange or citrus in there. Mouthfeel is OK, but this beer really gives me a warm fuzzy feeling whenever I drink it. Maybe it's some sort of psychological deal with Anchor Brewing that's causing it, but I can drink this all day."
"Drinkability -- overall a very drinkable beer, though it starts to thin out and appear more watery as the bottle progresses"
"Overall: this one is probably my favorite american pale ale. It has more flavors than for example Sierra Nevada PA. Great beer."
"An amazing beer in fact..."
"(rated 7/17/2007)"
"D: Good session beer, not my favorite style but still good."
"D - This was a great example of a Pale Ale, the mix of taste along with the body and aromas produced by this beer was great, and 6% it is a great sessionable beer"
"Pours a nice mid-copper color with some very nice head and a nice bit of lacing, too. Good scent, very floral, with a slight jerky tang. Good taste, too, a nice clean, hoppy pale ale, floral with a bit of citrus and jerky, without being unbalanced. Goes down clean, just a slight hoppy aftertaste."
"The color is golden yellow with copper hues. There is a thin white head. The aromas is wheat yeast floral and hops. The Beer is heavily hoppy with bitterness has a nice malty backbone. You can taste the malt and yeast a very balanced beer. The finish smooths the beer out."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid pale ale. When I opened it, I could immediately smell the hops and thought it was an IPA. Give it shot, it's worth it."
"Sorry, didn't really care for this one. Copper pour with a mild head. Floral aroma with some sweet hops. Astringent, metallic taste ruins the build-up of what I expected to be a good beer. The copper color may come from actual copper in the beer, either way it had an antiseptic bite that overpowered everything."
"Pours a clear, dark golden-orange color ith a thin foam head that quockly dissolves leaving minimal lacing. Clean and crisp aroma with hints of citrus and floral hops. Very crisp and clean tasting with a nice maltiness that balances out the floral hops."
"I could drink these all the day long."
"The body is a bit light but this is enhanced by the stronger bitterness notes. Some astringency from the hops. Overall some off notes and unbalanced beer makes it not really that great of a beer."
"Very drinkable brew, good but not great, a good choice for a session brew."
"Anchor Liberty Ale from Anchor Brewing Company pours a light amber color with a very large head from an aggressive pour. Smells of malts and hops. Tastes good with typical malty and hoppy APA characteristics. This beer is just a little too thin for me. I like well balanced beer but I find this one a little too sweet for my taste buds. Good but not great. Would be a good choice if you found yourself surrounded by macros."
"The finish calls for more after every drink, making this one a great easy-quaffer, but the 6% ABV makes that just a little bit dangerous, as it would be easy to go overboard. Still, a wonderful American Pale and yet another superb brew from an iconic American brewery."
"D - Because Pale Ales aren't my favorite I'll try not be biased, but I think it's very solid. I could drink a few of these but not all night."
"Drinkability: A nice beer and light enough to have a few. Well done"
"Drinkabilty: I am not an ale guy whatsoever, but in the few I've tried and liked this one is a real treat. I had a Flying Dog Pale Ale on tap earlier at a bar in Watertown and this beer blew it away. A hoppy, yet regulated and sophisticated beer to keep your attention!"
"This beer met my expectations."
"Pours a beautiful clear gold with a big white head. Smells of honey, citrus and floral hops. The hops make no bones about asserting themselves. Refreshes the palate no matter what you're eating. It also definitely delivers on the honey-like sweet malts. Good medium body with the perfect amount of carbonation. Too dry to have without food but amazing with a meal."
"This is one of the beers that turned me on to craft beers in general. So I gotta give it a huge thumbs up!"
"Will pick up again."
"Notes from 3/18/06"
"Pours a nice gold colour with a decent white head that doesn't last all that long. Has a really nice sweet fruity smell to it. Smell matches the taste, sweet with an astringent end. Very little lacing. This is definately a drinkable beer and would love to have another. For sure will recommend to my friends."
"I love this taste. This is the type of beer that I crave. Nice mellow hoppy bitterness, with no bad aftertaste. Nice and creamy smooth. Beautiful and tasty. Recommend."
"Aroma is herbal with malt, hop, and some yeast. Beautiful golden color with a golden head. Flavor is citrus like and peppery with all the elements from the aroma. The finish has a quick bite of the hops. Overall a nice beer but not a great beer. I would have another."
"Very pleasant ale, and would be sessionable if not for the ABV. Not really an IPA as some have suggested. More comparable to some of the hoppier English ales like Bitter & Twisted."
"Got it in the bottle from a neighbor whose wife was giving me a bad haircut, made it a bit more palatable. I did not see it, as it was not poured, but the smell was faintly of hops and not much else, and the taste was kind of weak, too. I expect much better from Anchor Steam, and would not shell out $9 for a six pack of this."
"D: An all-around great session ale that is nice and balanced. Anchor has done a good job avoiding the temptation to make a beer that is silly or overwhelming on any front."
"D- Well balanced and refreshing"
"12345"
"D: One of my favorite English IPAs - a go-to beer that thankfully has a wide distribution in bottles, but is a real treat on-tap at the brewery"
"Pours a golden amber/red color, clear, big head, white, good lacing. Strong hoppy malty aroma balanced. Some nutty aroma, strong caustic aroma. Very balanced Nutty taste, reminiscent of Newcastle, but not skunky. Strong acidic first taste but then smoother, and only a nutty aftertaste. More hoppy than malty. Very fizzy."
"Color is typical of a lager, clear yellow with a tinge of orange, but with a nice, thick, fine-bubbled head that persists. Aroma is crisp and malty with a hoppy undertone, not complex but still inviting. Flavor has equally strong hops and malt components, not too bitter, with just a touch of sweetness. Texture is smooth, and finish is hoppy and satisfactory."
"Wow what a great classic pale ale. I had it on tap and it pours with a beautiful head. Nice deep golden color with nice fulffy white head. The scent is very strong with the hops but the taste is balanced when you drink it. It's a great hot day beer or for tailgating. This isnt the best beer on the market but proably the best american pale ales. I love the drinkablity and I will continue to drnk this when I have the chance to."
"On tap at the brewery. Gold color with a thin white head. Filmy lace left behind. Aroma is straight-up Cascade hops. Flavor is pale malt with Cascade citrus and a bit of an apple juice note. Slight bitterness is a little weak for the style. Nice mouthfeel, with smooth carbonation and a medium-thin body. Drinkable but simple. Just doesn't jive with my ideal profile of the style."
"Overall, a great beer. Very enjoyable look and presentation, and very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A great APA one of my favorite and always a solid choice."
"Overall: A classic of the style and one of the first american IPA'a. A clear standard for the style and very enjoyable, maybe my favorite nose on an american IPA."
"This beer has a unique taste. Up front I did not like it, but it starts to meld toward the end and becomes very drinkable. Really bizarre. At first I was almost cringing, but when it was done I would have taken another."
"Kinda dissapointed in the taste. The aroma's really pumped this beer up to be a hop moster, and I was left wondering what this beer could have been."
"The aroma was nice and crisp with a good hop smell with faint maltiness. The taste was of sweet malt up front with a fruity hop finish. It had an overly moderate carbonation factor that was fine. Overall a solid pale ale."
"D: Very impressed, another solid offering from one of the original Craft Brewers. Great offering and a pretty good example of a West Coast Pale Ale, which was kind of cool after all the IPA's. A must try for all advocates."
"Pours a clear light-orange color, smallish sized white head fades into a film on top of the beer, a few splotches of lace around the glass. Lots of floral hop aromas, bright & citrusy, with a nice bready backbone. Citrus hop flavors come through nicely, without being too over-the-top, some faint tangerine notes, slight piney bitterness, some sweet caramel flavors, all of this in extreme balance. Lively and refreshing, and a beer you could drink all day, all year. A longtime favorite of mine."
"Overall, this is one hell of a light ale. Tons of flavors and an almost perfect combo of malt and hops."
"D: Great APA if you ask me, extremely drinkable. Not too complex but great balance and interesting enough to really appreciate the character of this beer."
"Like with other Anchor beers, Liberty Ale is the sort of beer that I wish mass market breweries made. It's simple, clean and well-balanced. You can understand how it helped popularize microbreweries in this country, and it tastes the way that I imagine good beer has always tasted. It's not ""extreme"" or exotic. It's just good beer in traditional styles. It's also very easy to drink."
"Once in a while you find a drink that surprises you. It brings you back to a time and place and makes you remember why you search for good beer in the first place. There's validation here - Drink up!"
"Drinkability: A classic example of the style, nice and crisp."
"You could basically drink this beer all day and sometimes I do. I love the flavors and aromas - It's like coming home from a long vacation."
"The beer is tasty, with light toasty grain, fruit, especially tart peaches, citrus, juice, leaves. The hops are just strong enough to barely dominate the character with a definite floral, citrus element and crisp bitterness that pulls back just before becoming too strong. It's offset with enough flavour and malty body to carry the bitterness and has a little compelxity while being very clean and crisp."
"This is a very good beer, I could definitely see drinking several in one session and going back for more."
"I admit to arriving late to the game on Anchor beers. Never tasted one until a couple months back, a single bottle of Steam. Grabbed a 6-pack of Liberty this week. What I love about both beers is the rustic quality; they taste ""old."" Old in the sense that they have been making a quality product for years, and feel no need to change things, much like the traditional German brewers, yet it is still very American. I can only imagine how bold this beer would have been when it debuted in 1975; it seems rather tame by today's standards, but it is still an exceptional beer. Highly recommended, and shame on me for taking so long to discover this fine product."
"Anchor Brewing Co. was the first craft brewery in America. I have admired a few of their wonderful beers and Liberty Ale is my favorite. I poured a 12oz. bottle into my tasting snifter and prepared for the best that Fritz Maytag has to offer. There was a nice amount of head once fully poured but it quickly dissipated. The color was a golden straw, and just a bit cloudy. The aroma was fresh with hops and citrus, with a touch of yeast. The taste wasn't overpowering, nice and smooth with equal amounts of hops and sweetness. I would also highly recommend Anchor Steam ale as well, unfortunately I'm all out so that review will have to wait for later."
"D: One of the better APAs I've tasted, and easily near the top in terms of drinkability. Not too dominated by its hoppy character, and with a nice overall complexity, this is a good brew."
"D: Pretty high. Easily drinkable."
"Pours a nice semi cloudy pale/light orange with a good fluffy white head that retains quite well. Nose is some fruity yeast, slight citrus hop. Taste follows with decent citrus hop flavor and a good subtle malt presence. An akward fruitiness in here. Mouthfeel is ok, but slightly overcarbonated and a little thick. Drinkability is pretty good, but there are certainly more drinkablte pales out there. A good unique beer, and a decent pale, but there are enough of them out there, that I probably won't purchase this one again. a decent beer, refreshing enough."
"Drinkability. A refreshing beer which I would have a again. As I stated earlier, a little lighter in the mouth than a lot of other Anchor products and other ales which is somewhat deceiving with the above average alcohol content."
"Nice mouthfeel and a nice to drink factor. Classic APA."
"Notes: It was a pleasure to taste and rate this beer. This makes 2 for 2 for Anchor Brewing Company beers that I have rated. I recommend that you try any product that they make based on those two reviews (the other is Anchor Steam)."
"D.Good drinkability."
"Very drinkable, a suitable hot weather beer for sure."
"This was the first of the Anchor brews I've had. Very impressed. Solid and flavorful APA."
"Hazy orange-like color topped with a medium head. The carbonation seemed to disappear halfway through the beer. Sweet citrusy, mild hoppy aroma. Very smooth, orange citrus flavor with a dash of tangy hops. Could use a little more flavor. This is relatively light and would seem to be a nice fit for the summer."
"Not digging this one as much as the other offerings from Anchor. Different style - sure, but flavors are not in line with my preference. Decent balance, but not my cup of tea. Has all of the great elements, just can't seem to come together."
"taste is crisp, grain, malt in the back, caramel, citrus throughout, with a slight sour finish, and also some bitterness in the end."
"650mL bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours an uninticing pale yellow, with a bit of head and little carbonation, although the current low carbonation could just be that I opened the bottle a couple of small pours ago. Weak hoppy aroma. The taste hits the tastebuds immediately with hops upfront but it ends sharply, almost a bit spicy. No fruitiness or well-rounded flavours, unfortunately."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and silky smooth. I think this is very drinkable and was very happy to see I enjoyed it as much as I remember."
"D= Deliciously fresh on tap. Not your typical American PA/IPA flavor at all though. Good drinking for a summer's day, and worth a go for anyone who appreciates pale ale."
"This beer is excellent; it comes on very strongly but wanes delicately and leaves you wanting more. For those of you who like the hoppier beers - this one's for you. Since this brew kind of strikes my fancy, I would really like to get the chance to try more beers from the Anchor Brewing Co. and see what else they have to offer in terms of other styles. Well-done!"
"This is truly a special beer. It's too bad the bro's consider appearance so highly. This is without a doubt a solid A beer."
"Drinkability - A summer beer and then some! Another all around solid brew by a legend in the business. On a hot summer July 4th I could think of nothing better. So easy to drink and the breadiness in this one is otherworldly."
"It's a classic and it's good. Nice, mellow, balanced, and tasty."
"On the palate, razor sharp bitterness cuts in right away, soft malt with more lemony citrus come through nicely. Medium bodied, soft and creamy as such. Finish is rather tart."
"I enjoyed this. A very unique pale ale. Anchor did a great job with this beer."
"Overall, I found this one quite good. I could drink quite a few on a hot summer day, it's very sessionable."
"Very respectable beer. I can only imagine living her in West Virginia, it could have been fresher and much better."
"Analogies aside, this is a great, classic American beer. Drinkable, enjoyable and brash."
"This ale is a slightly cloudy yellow amber color with minor white head and modest lacing. The aroma is lemony malt but somewhat weak. The taste is a nice light lemony wheat with very solid, fine carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing. Plenty of clean hop bitterness. Very nice but not much complexity from what I can tell."
"Great beer, which I slightly prefer to regular Anchor Steam. Thank god this beer is widely distributed!"
"A suprisingly heavy beer, I would not buy this again, although it was a nice treat."
"Tan orange color with a billowy white head that stays stick all over my pint glass. Smells malty/grainy. Tastes like light barley and of course cascade hops. However this is a little watered down compared to sierra nevada pale ale. The hops provide pine oils and orange peel zest in the flavor. The dry hop comes through and you get that whole hop/tea leaf dryness. Sorta spritzy, watery mouthfeel. Very drinkable, goes down easy... I would suggest this as a summer brew."
"I wish this brew was more widely available in this neck of the woods, as I'd keep it on hand for sure."
"I like this better than I thought I would. It really reminds me more of Bass (taken up a few notches) more than something like SNPA. No trouble drinking it, although I wish it maybe was lower in abv. I would love to session this, but 6% can catch up with me a little quick. I would get it again if I was in the mood for pale ales. I was a bit sad when I took the last sip."
"D - I think that this would be a very good beer to get people to like hops with a gateway beer to IPAs it has a good taste thats sessionable worth trying"
"Liberty Ale is a classic american pale ale orange amber in color with a good amount of hops. you can really taste the citric favors from the cascade hops. There a good solid body with a bit of hoppy resin. Liberty Ale bitterness is supported by a good amount of carbonation that cut through the body and livening the mouthfeel. Leaving you with a bitter yet pleasant aftertaste for grapefruit and lemon peel. Over all it's a good beer."
"Very drinkable, and sessionable ale. A well crafted, somewhat user friendly offering from Anchor. Would make a good introduction to american pale ales to beer newbies. It just keeps inviting the drinker back for more. Glad i picked up a big bottle at the local LCBO. May stop in for more before the summer ends."
"Drinkability: I'm not the biggest drinker and I was able to drink almost a 6-pack over the course of an afternoon and evening. It's really great stuff. The hoppy aroma never gets old and the easy-drinking taste demands more drinking. This will be one of my favourites for the summer here in hop-starved BC, Canada."
"Drinkability- A truly wonderfull pale ale, full bodied, flavorful, and lasting taste, one of the best."
"D = Good drinkability, well balanced, refreshing, a very good APA."
"The Liberty Ale is a very well balanced APA that probably doesn't get the props it deserves. It's crisp, refreshing, sweet, and slightly bitter. I could drink these for quite a while."
"Pours a lovely golden haze color with two inches worth of foam and nice lacing down the glass. Smell is sweet and floral with hints of piney hops. Taste is very sweet, hints of honey, slightly floral in flavor, nice use of malts and and generous amount of hops that don't ever become too bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth and well carbonated. A very nice representation of an English Pale Ale from a very well-respected American microbrewery. My favorite of Anchor's offerings."
"D: Right up there with Fat Tire for me. An incredibly drinkable Ale. One of my standbys and readily available, even in Mississippi. A good call. No matter what time of day."
"Great Beer with great overall taste. When you first drink it tastes like beer heaven. The hop flavor does not overwhelm you. It coasts into the beer like a steam ship. No pun intended. The aftertaste is really good feels like you continue to drink the beer even after your done with it. The beer has a nice clean taste almost has a sweet hoppiness to it. The hops add wonderful character and taste to this beer."
"Overall, quite drinkable and sessionable. I feel the need to go get another one."
"Almost appears like a pilsner but much more bitter not fruity at all buit overall a good quality brew"
"Drinkability: If it weren't for the price, I'd buy this a lot more. I'm a big fan of all of Anchor's beers. One of the most unique breweries I know."
"D- An interesting APA that I did not find all together that great. I know that this beer has gotten great reviews here, but I felt that it was lacking. I was especially hopeful because I am such a huge fan of the Steam Beer. Maybe my favorable thinking of that beer gave me the wrong impression of this one. Maybe I was expecting something else. This beer is something that I will have to come back to down the road because I know that it is better than that. Overall something that I would not purchase again but was still glad that I had the chance to give it a try. Just glad that I was able to purchase a loosey instead of being left with a whole 6 pack."
"Very pretty IPA color of deep gold. SLightly clouded, how I like it. Very nice nose of fruits and flowers. The hop taste is distinctly cascade and it caught me a bit off guard. For a minute, I thought I might be tasting an I2PA. It has a high IBU count, I'm sure, but tasty nonetheless. A nice beer."
"Notes: A very fine brew. A pleasure to have and a very unique Ale. I will go out of my way to find this as this Brewery has given me some good experiences. I would say this is an American classic,perfect for all occasions. Session-Hell yes!"
"A hazy orange-brown colow with a nice tan head. The nose has a sweet malty base with some fruity citrus hops on top. The taste is similar. A nice blend of the pale candy malts and floral hops. A medium to light body with good carbonation. A nice example of a pale."
"D - Extremely drinkable; just flavorful enough but not overpowering; can swig comfortably; goes fast; could suck down a few of these in a session for sure"
"Drinkable, but I wouldn't buy it again. For APA's, my future money will go to Great Divide Fresh Hop."
"D - A very drinkable pale ale. The only things that take away from the drinkability is the medium body. It's a very robust, enjoyable flavor, so it's not a beer that I'd want to drink quickly, but rather savor it."
"D: Very drinkable--its got a strong flavor profile, it doesn't sit heavy in the stomach, and it smells great. This would be a great non-winter session beer."
"D: Very drinkable. A good all around beer for a medium bodied beer."
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass, honey orange color with a minimal head that reduced to bubbly foam islands. Hoppy barley aroma and the taste was similar with a hopspice and a bittersweet finish. Bitter citrus and hops make it crisp and dry with light carbonation. I am surprised I didn't like this more but I was not very impressed. Would drink again but not purchase."
"D: Eminently drinkable. Tip back a few and let freedom ring."
"Overall this is an excellent ale that I enjoyed very much. 4-6 in a sitting with no qualms. Drinkibility is high for sure."
"D - Even as a non APA drinker, I might consider having this again, although I suspect I will need to grow into this area before that happens."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer. It has a well-balanced flavor and a good smell. Taste is a somewhat overly bitter at first, but you get used to it."
"MF&D - Crisp flavor and good carbonation. Highly recommended. Just a notch below Anchor beer."
"T/F/D: The hop/floral aroma continued onto the palate and is quite pronounced. I thought that the beer was overly carbonated. The beer was mild with a bite, but finished dry and crisp. Overall, it has a good flavor and taste with good drinkability. I would consider picking this beer up every so often, but not something that I would put into heavy rotation."
"Final thoughts - Tastes like it smells. Light grapefruit taste that is very smooth."
"D: All around good pale ale that would be suitable as a session beer in my opinion."
"A light orange brew with a rolling, fairly long lasting off-white head. Retention is excellent, and a thick lacing is left behind. Nose consists of an essence of orange, hops, and a bit of pine. The hops mix perfectly in with the citrus sweetness that covers a slight chalky yet biscuity undercurrent which actually balances the experience out. In the background lies some orange peel and lemon. Carbonation is active and mouth-feel is light to medium bodied. Smooth and tasty."
"Pours an orangey copper color with a thick tan head that sits atop the beer for some time before settling and then laces the glass very nicely all the way down. It has a very nice roasted malt smell with a big citrisy hoppy finish. The taste is good too. Nice sweet malty base underneath a nice amount of citrisy and piney hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is really clean, crisp, and refreshing. The drinkability is very good as this is a nice APA."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I really like this beer. the appearance is a golden color, but it also appears slightly orange. nice head with nice lace. smell - is a bit fruity but the hop auroma is killer. taste is great. real hoppy with some fruityness. it is light on the palate, and the 6% abv can be detected. This is one of my favorite APA's."
"D: Overall a decent malty ale, but wouldn't drink on a regular basis."
"I didn't have paper to take notes on, so this review is based purely on memory. It poured a clear, dark amber with a little off-white head. It smelled like malt with a bit of copper hops. It had a generic but good flavor of copper hops balanced by malt. It was slightly thick with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a good, solid pale ale perfect to celebrate the 4th of July."
"D,notes: An excellent well balanced brew with a great hop flavor that is not overpowering. Highly sessionable. I don't have much respect for the American pale ale as a style; this beer reminds me why I should. This is by far the best APA I have had. It illustrates how many really sub-par APAs are out there."
"Drinkability- Its a good beer very tasty and enjoyable."
"I have never met an Anchor Steam product I haven't fell in love with, and this one follows the trend. It has a nice golden color, creamy white head, and just enough lace on the glass. The smell is very aromatic with hints of fruit, hops, and spices. The taste is equally exceptional with flavors of a wonderful hop blend that makes its presence at the end and fruity at the initial taste. Definitely recommend this beer (and all A-S products) for all!"
"I could drink this brew all day and all night. It belongs in dive bars and five star restaurants alike."
"Jk"
"difinitely on the shopping list."
"This is a good summertime beer. Could drink quite a few of these but falls just outside the session category due to the 6% ABV. I recommend this beer as a great example of the American Ale."
"I could easily drink a few of these per sitting. Great APA."
"The flavor has a lot of Hefeweizen-like characteristics: banana, wheat, pale malts. Some alcohol & hops pull through on the finish as big, yeasty fruit notes give this Pale Ale a nice complexity. The aftertase warms with the alcohol, and hops deliver a great bitterness reminiscent of an English IPA. Overall, however, I was a bit underwhelmed with this beer. It's a good beer and one of the originators in the world of craft brews, don't get me wrong, but it seems that the craft scene has passed it by with more complex, hoppy, & overall tastier Pale Ales."
"Easy to drink, especially outside in the hammock."
"D - Could have a keg of it to myself."
"Good one, this: balanced and flavorful without socking you in the mouth."
"Not an APA that one would want for high hop content, but rather one that's restrained yet delicious. Very nicely done."
"This truly is a great American pale ale and I would gladly drink it again and again. I likely won't revisit it any time soon though due to its high price. I really like the interesting malt and hops flavors that I'm not familiar with; they're very tasty in a firm and balanced, but subtle way."
"Nicely drinkable, improves greatly as it warms. It may not be my favorite pale ale at the moment but I do need to try this particular beer some more before I make any hasty decisions. I will be buying some more!"
"This beer pours a pale golden yellow/orange color with a creamy and sudsy white head. Rests on top and dies down rather quickly. Smell is of grainy malt with some slightly dull floral aroma. Taste is very smooth and crisp with a nicely carbonated mouth feel. Nice sessionable beer."
"This is a great American pale ale, and it is all around a solid brew."
"d: this beer is very drinkable possibly to sweet, but the 6% abv is barely noticeable. This could possibly be a session beer if i could get it by the 6 pack"
"This used to be my favorite beer. But it has changed, and not for the better. Is it the twist-off cap? That certainly doesn't help.... But there's more. I haven't had this on tap for a long time, and I really want to try it to see if it's better than the bottled version. But the last few times I've had this in the bottle, it's been a big disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad beer. But it's not up to the standards I expect from Anchor, which I consider one of America's greatest breweries. The hops just don't stand out, the malt is not full or complex enough, and there are some off aromas and flavors. Body is very thin, it's under-carbonated... I can't go on-- too depressing. As I said, I've always loved this beer. What's happened to it?"
"D: Excellent. A nice beer alone or with food. Great for an evening session with friends."
"One of my favorite pale ales and a lot different from the typical pale ale, in my opinion. Pours a hazy, golden color with a nice, foamy head. Smells of breadiness, citrusy, and earthy. Flavors of bready malts, citrusy hops, yeast, and a certain ""earthy"" flavor...I dont know how else to describe it. This beer isnt as crisp as the typical APA but packs more body and depth of flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, and good carbonation. Very balanced beer and extremely drinkable. Anchor doesnt let down."
"The beer poured nicely with a cloudy, light orange body and a medium head that left nice lacing in the glass. The smell of floral and citrus hops was immediately apparent upon pouring the ale. The taste was a strong, resolute and very satisfying mix of floral and citrus hops with fresh yeast that finished dry and clean. A great example of the style. I can't wait to try the Porter."
"Previously, I only sampled it after drinking other beers. It never did it for me, but I decided to buy a six-pack to focus on it and I was glad that I did. It's a different style than SNPA -- it has a sweeter, floral aroma and taste with a hop bitterness that is pretty mellow. A very good pale ale and highly recommended."
"The sweet flavors of the malts meld with spicy notes. The kick of the hops just keeps building and suddenly drops away."
"Fantastic brew! The complexity is subtle but is more than meets the eye. Though light in color and texture, the flavors range from light maltiness to light hoppy sharpness in the finish. This goes down so smoothly with such a clean taste that I can see how this could become a favorite. Excellent."
"I used to drrink this long ago and realized I had not only not reviewed it, I hadn't even drank any in a long time, so I decided to get a six pack of it. Pours dark golden with a big white head that fades to a cap. The smell is all piney and citrusy hops. There is a light malt profile lurking in the background. The taste leans to the piney side, but with a grapefruit peel backbite. Mouthfeel is clean and a bit on the thin side like some of the other classic West Coast IPAs. Drinks well with its refreshingly bitter bite and huge pine aftertaste. It is essential to drink this beer fresh to really experience its glory- I'd forgotten just how good this stuff can be. I think I'm going to add itt back into my IPA rotation."
"Rerate in bottle back in Tx, left me with a much diminished impression of the beer. Below average with a strange eggy flavor ala the Anchor Summer beer. Didn't care for it 2nd time around..."
"This is a very well balanced, wonderfully crafted beer that is a credit to the style. The malts hold their own, but it is the hops that steal the show here. I like the depth of flavor and the overall ease of consumption. I find myself becoming a big fan of the Anchor Brewing Co. I have really enjoyed everything that I have tried from them and the Liberty Ale is a winner for sure. I look forward to trying more of their offerings."
"This is a nice, dry, flavorful beer that is good, but isn't my favorite pale. It pours a rather light orange yellow with a white thin head, some retention, little lacing. The smell is yeasty bite and prickly carbonated hop essence. The hops here are aged rather than freshly ripe and dripping with ester and oil. The taste is strongly tilted toward the hop. It is a dry, very dry beer, with some maltishness in the finish. I'm detecting some complexity in the malt, perhaps some citrus, some herbal tea like flavors. The hops do overpower a bit. This is a lightish consistency beer, but there is some creaminess to it as well, and it does get better as it settles. The mouthfeel begins rather prickly but smoothes out. The aftertaste is a bit acerbic. It's a refreshing beer. I'm definitely getting more acerbic tea like flavors in the finish as I'm nearing the bottom of the glass. I just had a Smuttynose pale just prior, and I think I will give that one the nod over the Liberty."
"D - Nothing really sets this beer apart from other ales. Probably would not seek this one out in the future."
"D- Ok. Have been a Anchor fan for a long time, but this is the first try of this beer. Would like to try fresh on tap to see if it opens up more."
"Liberty is a clean, crisp pale ale. I'd call it a golden ale, but it almost touched upon being a lager for its dry clean taste. The body is gently clouded with a good cap of white foam. Drinkability is high because it's clean and satisfying. A good all around beer for any occassion."
"alot going on in the taste category. A historic brewery and a must try brew."
"One of my favourite APAs."
"From the bottle it pours a light copper, with a degree of cloudiness, and a quickly diminishing white rocky head. The aroma is fresh and and full of hops and a hint of grapefruit. The initial creaminess in flavour is replaced by a crispy fruity taste with the grapefruit coming through somewhat. Bitter finish, and nicely refreshing. Medium-light body and medium carbonation."
"Guess I am going to have to try the bottle..."
"Excellent brew. I wish I had more."
"d: Drinkability is very good. Its pretty staightforward, earthy hops, not much balance to it. An enjoyable beer, I think I appreciated it more before I got into IPAs, now it doesn't stand out as much, but its still solid."
"Pours a bright and hazy toasted orange color with a small creamy egg-shell head that dissipated into a sudsy looking cap. The smell is of pale malt, lemon, and a slight earthy yeast/hop combination. The brew starts off bitter but not in a citrus hop sort of way. The initial bitterness is followed by a bready pale malt and lemon twang. A tin like metallic bitterness shows in the finish. The feel is light and very fizzy, it kind of numbs the tongue. The finish for the most part is neutral but does have an odd metallic bitterness. A different sort of APA that is uniquely bitter with a lemon twang. Definitely not my favoriate APA, I think I'm not a fan of the hops that Anchor uses."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of medium honey, with a nice off white head - nose of red fruit, light hops, and some light citrus  taste of light hops, light red fruit, and citrus - body is medium, dry, and with medium high carbonation  dry aftertaste of light hops, light red fruit, and citrus"
"I will definately enjoy the six-pack."
"From a short fat 12 oz bottle copped singly from total wine and more in union. Pours an amber gold color with a decent head. Smell is very bready with a slight caramel aroma. Flavor compliments the smell with a noticible vanilla aftertaste. Slight bread and biscuit flavor with a clean, clear crisp finish witch gives way to a slightly bitter aftertaste that goes down smooth and clean. Easy drinkability, very refreshing. My favorite brew from anchor. Def Recommended."
"Pours a slightly cloudy gold with just a little head. Nose is slightly citrus-esqe with obvious hop influence. Flavor is not what I had expected. Starts off with a deep but not overdone hop flavor. Moves to a slight citrus accent. Then to a smoothly bitter tone. Then you are left with a clean hop flavor on your tongue. High marks for such a ride through the flavors. Mouthfeel is thick with a good carbonation. Very drinkable."
"Pours a mild to medium pale amber, but with a lot of bubbling and a little lacing. The aroma is a little skunky, but maybe in a hoppy way, I'm not sure. Very light malt in the nose. The taste is a lillt e unky, but still mildly malty and strongly hopy. Dried hop taste with some stl bread mixed in. Not bad, just not as sessionale as I thought it would be."
"Pours a nice golden clear liquid with a small white head. Little lacing, good carbonation present. Smells of hops and grain, some citrus hints. Tastes of citrus and grassy hops, good bitter aftertaste and holds the tongue well. I enjoyed this brew and cannot believe I haven't picked it up before as I've seen it for years."
"Pours a nice, smooth head that simmers down to a beautiful white layer. LIvely carbonation. Lovely golden color. The aroma is solid as well w/ a good hop presence. Great citrusy aromas, followed by a strong fruitiness. This aroma lives on in the flavor with a strong hoppy bitterness initially w/ flavors of grapefruit and lemon peel. This is backed up by an excellent fruity flavor from the esters. Finishes crisp and clean. Light bodied and smooth. Overall, an excellent example of an APA. Delightfully crisp and clean citrus flavors, with a bit more fruitiness than most APAs I've had. Highly recommended."
"Drank a bottle of this with the Anchor code ""7SZ," meaning it was bottled on September 26, 2007. Poured a clear golden yellow into a pint glass, with a small white head. Little retention on the head. Smells of honey, orange, and mellow malts. Tastes of orange, citrus, crisp malts, with a light, hoppy finish. It drank like a crisp lager. Light-to-medium mouthfeel. This is an excellently drinkable beer, a fine example of the American Pale Ale. I will always refer to this as a very strong stand-by."
"1 finger foamy head quickly drops to a thin layer, but sticks around, leaving plenty of lacing. Very mild aroma, but it smells pretty balanced between malts and hops. Pretty tasty. The key here is balance. Citrus and pineapple flavors burst from the hops, and with backbone malts there to balance. Very drinkable and refreshing. Actually tastes kind of similar to the Brooklyn lager with more of a pale ale kick."
"Poured out with a murky gold appearance with a thin head. The aroma is full of hops with some malt smells. It had a good, but a bit mediocre citrus flavor. The drink had an average carbonation that did make it refreshing. This was, overall, a pretty balanced pale ale"
"Edit... intitially reviewed this as an AIPA, changed my review for the better to a APA."
"Drinkability: Very good ale. Nice balance. This brew begs you to have another."
" Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle.Looked nice in the light.Smelled nice in the nose and tasted great to me.As the beer warmed to the room the smell reminded me a little of Leffe.I could drink a few of these."
"Not a bad ale but needs a tad more in the flavor dept."
"Anchor Liberty Ale pours out of the bottle to a hazy golden color with orange highlights. The good size head appears dense, with a little lacing as things proceed. Hops make the first impression on smell with citrus and herbal scents followed by a malty sweetness. The taste is much the same, with the initial subtle hopiness balanced beautifully by a caramel malt tastes. Balance is the key to this brew - it doesn't need to shout to proclaim its greatness. Very drinkable as a result."
"A good example of an APA, but if you couldn't tell already, I prefer the hoppier IPAs ;-)"
"D - An excellent APA and well worth the price ($10 / 6pk). Good drinking for any season, borderline session type drink."
"Overall a pretty good APA. Not readily available in Canada so when ever I find it I usually stock up. Recommended."
"If it wasn't so expensive I would definitely buy this more often; a great, easy pale ale when you want a slight break from hop bombs."
"Medium bodied feel to it. Alcohol is hidden and the sweetness is nicely balanced out with the hops. Could turn out to be a nice session beer."
"This is becoming a reliable beer to have on occasion. It pours a cloudy orange with a finger width snow white head. There's a thin layer of lacing left over. The smell was of dry flowery hops. Taste was pretty much the same with an interesting sequence. The hops were present immediately with a dry bitter taste, then they gave way slightly to the malt, and it finishes again with dry hops. The mouthfeel is one of the high points, leaving a crisp dry feel. I could only drink a couple at a time but this is a solid beer."
"Overall, one of the better beers from Anchor. Very traditional recipe, and I loved it. Great session beer, although some may say that the ABV is just a tad high to be a session. But in the end.... you don't think much about it, but every 10th sip or so you say, ""damn, this is pretty tasty""..."
"My first real APA as far as I can remember. Nice, but I'm not a hophead. Not saying that this beer is that hoppy, just a matter of emphasis. From what I understand, a great representation, but I'll take an English one thanks."
"D- a new addition to my list of widely available go to beers. anchor liberty ale, sierra nevada pale ale, and TD hoppus maximus."
"The taste is sweet--red licorice and molasses. The bitter finish begins oh-so-subtle, then builds nicely without overwhelming the tongue. Nicely hopped and an excellent ale. I'd love to have this one more often, but they just don't carry it out my way."
"American brewing has come a long way since this brews introduction back in 1975. If you're looking for an ""old school"" beer, you can't go wrong with Liberty Ale."
"Drinkability: Enojyable APA that I will look up again"
"Pale amber in appearance with an unfiltered haze and a sticky cap of foam. Honey-like sweetness and bitter citrus make up the nose. Herbal and citric hops (lots of grapefruit) balance with bready malts to make up the foundation of this beer. It finishes dry and slow. This is pretty rich and complex for a pale ale - not exactly a session beer, it feels too heavy to drink a lot of, but it's exceptionally flavorful. A great pale ale."
"Poured from the 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Body is a slightly cloudy golden color, topped by a thin, bright white head that doesn't stay for very long. Aroma is a nice blend of assertive floral hops and light malt, along with a bit of sweet adjunct ingredients. Palate is well-balanced up front, with an assertive bitterness come mid-palate. Finish is nice and dry, with a touch of sweetness. Mouthfeel is substantial enough to convey the flavor, but far from heavy - very pleasant. This is a quintessential American pale ale, and one that I should probably purchase more often. A very drinkable ale that really hits the spot."
"A light ale as the malt is there it isn't the main attraction with this beer. Carbonation stays consistant with the release of many tiny bubbles. Leaves a bit of a piney, metallic aftertaste that isn't pleasant but not something that will stop me from drinking this fine example of an APA. Give it a try as it's readily available in most areas."
"A nice beer, I enjoyed this one... but I didn't find it all the ""drinkable"" I would struggle to enjoy more than a couple of these before wanting to move on to something else"
"07/09/2008 - Nearly a year later this has become one of my absolute favorite beers!"
"I've had this many times this past year and like it a lot, I'll try to be objective. Poured a clear amber into a Guinness glass - no, make that golden - but with an unmistakable orange hue. Nicely carbonated, subtle but persistent. Fragrant hops on the nose, really quite strong especially when first poured. A healthy almost-white head turned wispy with some stick on the sides of the glass but not really a lot of lacing. Mouthfeel is firey and hoppy with a citrus fruit zest and a marmalade finish. Quite refreshing and satisfying. It seems bitterness, body and fire are nicely blalanced here ... beer like this is making me a huge hops fan, hmmm good!"
"I loved this brew. I thought it was as clean and balanced as I have had. Great stuff. Simple and done right!"
"Worth checking out"
"D - Overall an interesting beer, much like the other Anchor beers. Definitely worth a go if you like the other Anchors, and you should."
"Taste is more citrus than the smell, the hops are medium bitter and hops are a slightly resinous. The yeast gives some fruitiness. Malt is sweet and somewhat dextrinous and biscuity. This beer is nicely balanced, but all components seem kind of muted."
"HIGHLY RECCOMENDED! Just check the date codes and make sure your beer is fresh (The second reviewing I had was about 5 months old, who knows how old the first one was!)"
"Not a particularly bad ale, but I go more for a malty, full bodied bitter ale."
"D: a nice apa. I could enjoy a couple of these."
"D) This is a really good, well balanced brew. I could easily drink a bunch of them. Sampled this beer in a blind tasting with Hopalicious and SNPA, it lost to Hopalicious by a nose."
"Immensely balanced and drinkable, this could be a regular session beer except for the prohibitive price - $9.00 a sixpack. I suppose it is a beer to savor when you have it. There should be an easy to read freshness date as I have seen this ale over a year old stocked on shelves in numerous liquor stores. Having said that I still highly recommend this brew."
"I used to be a staunch lager man but, American pale ales like this, IPA's and weissbier changed my whole outlook on life."
"wonderful amber color with a great fluffy white head...wonderful slightly hoppy aroma...carbonation is wonderful as it seems to be just right, gives a great mouthfeel...this is definitely one beer that is always in my fridge, a great go to beer with great drinkability"
"D- A classic American Pale Ale, perhaps the embodiment of the style."
"D: A very good ale that holds all the qualities of a mainstay within any refrigerator."
"Recommended. Another quality beer from the Anchor Brewing Company."
"D: Great drinkability, probably the best APA that is easily available to me, this is a step up from the quality of SN Pale Ale, which is a great beer in its own right."
"Notes: It has been about ten years since I last had this wonderful beer. It still tastes the same as the first time I had it. It's very drinkable and very unique for it's style. This american pale ale is a well ranking one in my book. Cheers"
"Pours a nice attractive copper color with good head that hung around a while. Aroma is citrusy with a bit of hops. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation level is good. Lacing around glass is good. Dominated by the hops, both in flavor and bitterness, but that is complemented by a subdued maltiness and faint vanilla sweetness. This is a fine beer."
"Comes out an orangy amber, with not much head, little lacing. It has a somewhat sweet smell to it. Has a smooth sort of bittersweet taste, It is definitely a good solid ale. I could see kicking back with a sixer of this anytime, it is quite refreshingand very drinkable."
"D-An easy drinker yet one with enough character to demand notice. A very good APA."
"D_East drinking, could be a session for me. But if there is a host of beers available, I would switch after one."
"The flavor is a perfect balance of apple peel, ripe apples, and pear, countered by a sharp hop presence that is never overbearing, but stern enough for the drinker to take notice. The slightly sweet syrup taste is exposed as the beer warms. Overall this is one of the more balanced APAs I've ever had. You can tell a lot of care and effort went into this one. Another stellar beer from Anchor."
"D: Very drinkable, and easily sessionable beer. It's light yet very flavorful and tasty. Goes down smooth, I could drink it all night. An excellent American microbrewed ale, another great Anchor offering."
"Pours a pale orange color wiith a white head. In the nose, big grapefruity hops and sweetness. In the taste a malty sweetness with a small bitterness in the end. A smooth bitter beer with a clean feeling. I was expecting more hops in the taste, but a good beer, period."
"I'd highly recommend this fine APA! (and very glad that I have 5 gallons worth to enjoy with friends in the coming weeks!)"
"D - A fine example of the style, and a definite go-to for any time of year. Well rounded and tasty with a bit more character than other beers in the style. Nicely done!"
"Same thing goes for the taste. Very nice and well balanced brew that I could drink all day long"
"Bottoms up!"
"Overall this is an excellent APA and one of the best I have ever had."
"Okay."
"was waiting a couple weeks to drink this and realized that today would be poifect. this is a hazy glowing apricot with a beautiful creamy off-white head and mochi-like lacing. smells much like other anchor offerings i've had, with a distinctive yeasty, bready, doughy nose. also some buttery notes and a hint of citrus. i would have liked a bit more residual malt sugars for a 6% beer, this had just a bit of malt sweetness. the finish is where the subtle (to me at least) hop bitterness kicks in. this had a dry, crisp profile overall. creamy, lively mouthfeel with a touch of astringency. another nice one from anchor."
"D - Slightly sweet and buttery with a nice dose of dry hopped citrus for us hop-heads...this is the very definition of drinkability!"
"How is this so drinkable, at 6%? I could easily see this being a go-to beer...well, it's one of my go-to beers, anyway. Tough to ask much more from this one - smooth, tasty, and really easy to drink. Anchor never, ever disappoints."
"Overall, it is very drinkable pale ale that is quite tasty."
"D: A session-able blue-collar ale...worth drinking pint after pint. A well-crafted, well-balanced ale with a pleasing richness and (yet) simplicity that makes me want to put this on my list of regulars. Recommended."
"D- this is a very drinkable beer, worth trying if you havent already."
"D: Awesome. Absolutely amazing drinkability. You finish this beer then want more. For being 6%, the alcohol flavor is that of a low-gravity wheat."
"D: This beer is an easy drink, a well-balanced ale that clearly helped set the stage for the highly hopped ales on the market now."
"Solid head on top of a nice looking amber beer. Nose is interesting and full of flavors; malt with lots of different fruits, citrus and maybe raisins too. Taste is very good. Similar to nose in the fruit, as well as a strong malt presence. Fruity hops show up as the beer goes on. Feel is medium bodied with good carbonation. I feel like this is a good beer to introduce people to craft beer with. Lots of flavors but not overpowering. Really a tasty one."
"M/D: Goes down easy. Nicely carbonated, even with my exaggerated pour. A reliable pour for any occasion."
"I had this one again for the first time in a while today, forgot what nice aromatics it had. Strong essence of lemon in the nose. Nice approach, long finish with some woody notes in it, hangs around the tongue in a not-at-all hurried to leave sort of way. Good beer, good brewery."
"Now if only Australian micros started making their bog standard pale ales like this..."
"Pours a lightly hazy blonde with very strong orange and copper tones. Huge, super-creamy head, white to off-white in color; lasts a good while and leaves thick lacing. Aroma is pleasantly light and fruity: apple, pear, bread, bleu cheese  very rich, though somewhat faint. Rich, creamy mouthfeel with a bit of tang. Medium body. Flavor is light fruits again, but with a touch of grape, carrot, and suds. Very crisp with a deliciously nutty, malty, lightly bitter finish. Aftertaste is clean and faintly bittersweet."
"Orange, hazy autumn morning, oddly enough the ground is covered in a thick blanket of snow. When it starts to warm the snow melts away, but not completely. Some nice formations remain. Pretty goddamn beer. Smell is robust, musky and hoppy. Taste is a punch in the head, with an extremely German hop aftertaste, big time Saaz. Mouthfeel is substantial, and clinging. Drinkabillity doesn't get much better."
"Leaves a bit of a film but overall quite light and summery, but with a hint of autumnal thickness. It's a good ale with some sweet flowery extra."
"Single bottle bought from Trader Joe's, 12 ounce bottle with code 7F7 on it, which I think means bottled on February 27, 2007. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a yellow/orange color with about an inch frothy white head. It smells hoppy, like citrusy and floral hops with a bit of bready malt too. It tastes mostly like citrusy hops (grapefruit and lemon), with some butter, spice and malt in there. Mouthfeel is light/medium, with a clean and dry finish. Drinkability is good too, it's a nice sessionable APA. It's a good solid beer, I'd buy it again."
"D - A nice APA. Good blend of flavors."
"A great beer with a well balanced taste. Citrusy hops provide some initial bitterness but the beer is mellowed out by a nice malty afternote. It smells maltier than it is. Bright orange color and a moderately foamy head add to the taste. Overall this is a pretty enjoyable beer."
"Drinakability- Had trouble keeping it in the glass long enough to review it."
"It went down smooth, but was certainly full bodied and very solid. I was pleased with this ale, and could see my self ordering it again. Nice."
"Anchor Liberty Ale pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The hops are noticeable up front in the aroma, fading into a caramel malt. Piney hops jump out first in the flavor, there are some citrus notes too. The malt is in the background here. A very tasty ale, recommeded."
"This is a very nice beer. It wasn't what I expected, and I think that there are other pale ales that I prefer, but I will definately buy it again."
"Pours a paleish color. Aroma is spicy, malty and hoppy all at once. However, this gives way to a very sour taste that makes me wonder if the beer went bad or not. Completely ruins it for me. I'm not aware of pale ales ever being sour but this one sure was."
"Poured one of these out into a nice, glass mug. It poured a golden body with a pretty thick, white head. Solid retention keeps the head of the beer with you the whole way through it. The smell was not anything too significant; slight sense of malts and hops had me expecting a well-balanced beer. The taste was a little bit different than what I was expecting. The malts were up front and present fairly strongly with nice hints of hops that offered to balance the beer even though the malts were much more evident. As you drink more of the beer, the hops begin to recede into the background of the beer, becoming more of a nice aftertaste than a balancing taste with the malts. The mouthfeel was pretty solid and full-bodied. Overall, the beer was fairly drinkable; easy to drink and very smooth. The taste was crisp and refreshing as well. This beer good come in handy on some warmer nights later this summer."
"An above average American Pale Ale (borderline IPA in my opinion) that will always hold a soft spot in my heart."
"Pours a golden amber hue with a lively head -- well carbonated. Did not smell particularly exciting (perhaps a result of a recent but persistent case of sinusitus -- blech!!). The taste, however, was very pleasing. I could drink a lot of this beer. Hops are in the front row, but nicely balanced by a nutty maltiness. This beer might not have the claim to fame of Anchor's Steam beer, but it is a terrific beer in its own right."
"Despite my description of this beer being sour, I do enjoy this pale ale quite a bit- a good British/American hybrid."
"Bottle into snifter. A: Light amber/orange, head goes down pretty quickly, not much lacing. S: Strong citrus, hops are present but not overwhelming, a bit of a wheat/bread smell. T: The citrus carries through under the hops, finish is dry and clean, a very slight bitterness remaining. M: Smooth and inviting. D: Not the most amazing beer Ive ever had, but very easy to drink. Definitely a good beer, but personally Id buy an IPA over this."
"A classic in its own right, but there are better ones out there now."
""
"Lighter bodied than I expected, it goes down very easy and although I had only one, it could certainly make for a very nice session beer."
"to the flavorful middle"
"This is a great APA, recommended with plenty of cuisine and for a night out as well. Fairly complex for such an easy drinking beer."
"This was the first american beer I learned to love, some 15 years ago. Really no downsides. A beer that should work for everybody, beer lovers as well as lager drinkers."
"Into a pint glass, pours a slightly hazy golden straw, a half-inch head of off-white foam settling down to a film, slight lacing in small streaks and bubbles. The aroma has that classic Anchor signature to it, that which I can never describe but always pick up. Fresh light fruits, citrus and malts in harmony, its nice, well tempered, well crafted. The taste is similar, more hop bitterness in addition to fruits and citrus, again the malts are well balanced, the finish is long drawn out. The body is great, carbonation is right, the alcohol not very noticeable but perhaps slightly warming. I've never been very into Anchor's beers, but this is definitely a tasty beer that I'd be happy to have any day."
"drinkability is very subjective, i could drink this beer all day long for the rest of my life so i gave it a 5, i could do the same with other beers too. That said it earned the 5 and i enjoy it alot."
"OK, I like it. I don't love it. It's a micro APA, but not an overly grapefruity one, and that is always a good thing. It isn't as frustratingly complex and trecherous as Anchor Steam ( a beer I am constantly trying to like and don't) it is a solid APA that you can drink without thinking about it too much. Or something."
"Pours a typical golden with decent head and lacing and noticable carbonation. Subtle fruit aroma with a distinctly spicy power behind them. The spice is upfront in the taste, which melts into some sweet fruit zest in the middle before it finishes with a cascade bitterness. Very complex, balanced flavor with a bite. Perhaps a little too strong flavored and grainy for more than two or three, but a wonderful sipper."
"don't base your purchase on my review!"
"Poured a relatively clear golden with ample carbonation. Smallish head dissipates quickly while carbonation bubbles continue to rise to the top for several minutes. Aroma is mild with some floral hops and sweet malts. Taste is herbal hops and bitter with a decent malty sweetness to keep it from being too bitter. Finish is very dry and invites another drink. Excellent to drink and perfect session beer. It's not really a memorable beer, but it is very very good."
"Anchor's Liberty Ale is an all around quality beer. Very well made and a pleasure to sip. I need to stop taking these beers that are always available for granted like I so often do."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's pretty light bodied. But, I'm not a huge fan of the taste. Overall, it's not a bad beer by any stretch. But, it's not very good. I don't think I'll be drinking it again."
"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Imported to Europe by www.bierenco.nl . ABV is 5.9%. Golden colour, slightly hazy, large head. Lovely Cascade aroma, citrus fruits and tropical fruits abound. Pleasant hoppy flavour - more in terms of ""depth of flavour"" than actual bitterness. Soft mouthfeel. Some hops in the aftertaste too. A nice beer!"
"Overall, this is a tasty drinkable pale ale from one of my favorite breweries in california."
"pours a slightly hazy golden-orange, amber-y body with a big, soft head, sinking somewhat quickly into thick, fine-bubbled lacing and a clumpy, shiny film. the nose is fresh and fruity, somewhat lemon-like, less than the steam, but still strong. floral notes also climb the nostrils, with a sort of woodland piney-ness. savory malts are also detectable. now on to the taste... amazingly well balanced between the more-than-average-but-not-too-much bitterness and the complex, luscious, bready malts. medium bodied, fine-carbonated, this beer is absolutely sessionable and soft-spoken in its craftsmanship. fantastic. besides, it doesn't hurt to have the ""made in san francisco"" written on the bottle. it makes me proud, tearing up just a tad for my distant home. san francisco, this one's for you!"
"A very drinkable beer though not really one for me."
"D - This ale goes down very easily, would be a good session beer."
"Good body with a certain degree of creaminess although there is a waxy/oily qualtiy to the mouthfeel that detracts a bit from the overall enjoyment. Still, drinkability is high even with a slightly surprising 6% ABV."
"App - 4.0 , Smell - 4.0, Taste - 3.0, Mouth -2.5 , Drink - 3.0"
"I still enjoy Steam more then this, but they both entice you enough to buy a case & then some. :)"
"Best American ale? Show me another."
"DA: highly drinkable stuff. Very enjoyable. A good one for Presidents Day."
"Some say that this is the standard for American pale ale, and you'll find no argument here. It's got the right blend of flavors and is superbly balanced. Could drink this one all night."
"This feels a bit bity, and a little coarse too. Also, this is very clean and crisp."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a clear straw collor, forming a 1 inch head, leaving medium rings of lace along the glass. The aroma is mostly of hops, but with a slight trace of grain. The taste is of hops, forming a light citrus flavor, and again being accompanied by a light grain taste. Light mouthfeel, and medium carbonation. This tastes like a combination of a pale ale and a light lager beer. Almost like something released by Miller. Not a bad pale ale, but not my first choice either."
"The main thing I'm getting out of this beer is crisp hops. There's a backbone of coppery caramel, but it's really dominated by the hops. The hops profile seems a mix of american and european to me. It's fairly grassy but there's also a citrus edge to it that keeps it from getting too earthy."
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a nice full head  average lacing. The smell is strong of the smell of hops  very nice. The taste is bitter and the hops are definitely noticeable. The mouthfeel is full and crisp. This is a good example of a pale ale, Id consider it when this style strikes my fancy."
"D: Definately a great (and underappreciated) pale ale"
"I am taken by this beer and drink it as often as I can. It is a throwback and homage to homebrewing."
"Not bad. Notably strong for an American Pale Ale. Hops and malt are well balanced."
"D: Not quite the tastiest beer I've had, goes down easy enough and it isn't very filling. It's not a bad beer, but there are definitely many others within the style that I would choose first."
"D- For some reason, I couldn't really see myself enjoying this on a regular basis, but I did enjoy this one. Something seemed missing to me."
"Taste carries over more hops than I remembered both in taste and bitterness. Of course I didn't remember any of the great things about this beer. Light resins and clean malts, hint of seaweed and some salt. Nice bitterness, super easy to drink, perfect finish. How did I forget about this beer?"
"Altogether, Liberty Ale is a nice APA and worth the while."
"One of the better pale ales out there; very drinkable, nicely balanced and the bright malt profile is superb. Recommended."
"This is a great pale. Pours a cloudy amber with a nice white head. Has a citrus/malt aroma leading more towards malt. Taste is crisp citrus hop with more malt presence than many of this kind. I like the malt dominance this APA has as compared to others. An excellent APA that is very balanced. It is a perfect complement to Sierra Nevada for APA lovers because it offers a different experience but still adheres to the style. I am glad I tried it and will have it again. It has high availability as well so it should be on every BA's list."
"D- good taste, not sessionable for me, i like it better in small doses, very well brewed pale, but not my pick."
"A solid, respectable beer. It's an orange color with a small head. An outdoorsy, grainy aroma, with a little citrus. Mostly a hoppy taste, sweet. I think it had a nice balance. This is a beer you could drink a few of, and be very satisfied. I know I was."
"Simply brilliant and brilliantly simple."
"the beer pours a hazy tan. the head, 1/4 inch, is gone within a few seconds. malty nose, hoppy when agitated. the taste is a very citrusy hoppy taste that turns sweet after the swallow. good mouthfell and you can drink it all night. have yet to be dissapointed by anchor, and i don't think i'm alone here."
"I got this brew at Tank's Taproom in Tampa, Fl. I poured it into a pint glass, and it gave great head. The retention was solid, not to fast, not to slow. It was a light redish color, or a darkish yellow. The smell was a great subtle hop aroma. The taste was the same, but just a bit stronger. The mouthfeel was wonderful, it hit the back of my mouth, and it was like a party in my neck. A soild brew. Don't drink and review."
"This is very drinkable. I could drink this at any time of the day ... it's just that good. Another winner from the Anchor family ... run out and grab a sixer or too. Btw, the ladies love this one as well. I would highly suggest newbies to try this out if they're looking for an IPA in its truest form."
"I've had this beer before on draft, and thought it was pretty good. This bottle pours a dull hazy gold...a bit light for an APA. Smell is sweet malt instead of hops. Taste is light and crisp but not at all hoppy...in fact I'd take issue with the classification of it as an APA, despite the claim on the bottle that it is dry-hopped. Tastes more like a Belgian Golden Ale to me. I found the label claim that it is naturally carbonated also very interesting for a large scale production beer that is not secondarily fermented or cask-conditioned. It results in a very smooth and mild beer. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, and this beer is highly drinkable."
"Very drinkable. A great lunch time beer."
"I like this a lot. I could see this as a go-to keep-in-the-fridge to go with anything beer."
"A beer that doesn't hit you over the head with everything it's got right at the start. Rather, a beer that you realize is great just as you're finishing the bottle. Great length of flavor and masterful balance, with a very attractive flavor profile (malt not too caramelly or fruity, hops not too citrusy or herbal)."
"This beer has a pretty balanced body as well. It is not heavy nor light. Rather the body sits right in the middle, carbonation is acceptable for this range, perhaps just a little less, and I mean a little-a miniscule amount. LIberty Ale was also quasi creamy when I first sipped at it with that nice head still quite large before the oil on my lips started to diminish its size. Overall this is a beer that I would readily buy again, however with so many APAs out there I probably won't get around to buying it again anytime soon. I definitely prefer GLBC Burning River or SNPA over this one, however this is also good. I guess it all depends on my mood. The two former are hoppier, if I want an APA that is more balanced then I'll choose the later. This is a beer that I could sit around and seriously drink all day."
"This was a nice beer. It had a good hoppiness to it. The only thing I didn't like is that it was a little dry on the taste. It was easy to drink however and had a nice hop aroma and a nice head and decent retention. I have grown to enjoy brews from this brewery."
"D: For the ABV of this brew, it's very dinkable, as it's not an overpowering pale ale by any means. This isn't the best pale ale I have ever had, but it's defenitely a good choice."
"D: Would definitely order another, an interesting APA that deserves a second or third order."
"Mouthfeel benefits from nice, perky carbonation, medium body, and a little malt stickiness. A very refreshing beer, this gets high points on drinkability. I will get more of this when I can."
"drinkability is great. this is a nice beer that one could easily drink on a daily basis."
"The taste is a little tart. It's got some bittering hops going on, but this is the same fruity tartness that I have in my that homebrew recipe I'm thinking of. It's the same yeast that's used in Cooper's Ale. In fact, this tastes darn near like a Cooper's. Fortunately, Cooper's is one of my favorite Aussie Beers. My only beef is that it seems way too carbonated for my palate, and it's a bit harsh or abrasive going down."
"Drinkability: For a sample or two, I would recommend it being a once in a while beer. Very good, but not completely endearing"
"D - Easy to reccomend and a pleasure to drink."
"I have to say, from the reviews, I expected more from this beer; I will probably try again at some point in case this is just an out of date example"
"D- This is a good APA, but it tastes a little mainstream (I guess that's a good thing?) Still, I have to give Anchor credit for making a good product and being able to sell it on a large scale. That's a tough thing to do these days."
"I rarely preface a review with comments but this is truly the gold standard of American ales. I have consumed this periodically in the 80's, 90's and have now returned. I can say this ale has not waivered and as in so seldom the case, is as good as I remember it being in the previous 2 decades. Poured into a nonic glass achieved a beautiful 2 finger head, fine beaded carbonation. Head was vigorous and sheeted down glass. The citric hop aroma (I get tangerine) is fantastic. On first taste you get that and a flowery hop note. The malt then kicks in, then a great bitter hop finish. A classic that is one of a kind."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Crisp, with a light body. Good mouthfeel. Drinkability is high. Good session beer."
"An overall good beer. Evidence of dry hopping, which should be to the delight of hop lovers. Bitter yet refreshing. This is one you shouldn't pass up."
"A good finger of off-white head and orange-red murky body, good bit of lacing. Smells very hoppy, which I expected since its an APA from the west coast... Surprisingly light in flavor considering the aroma. Tastets hoppy, both bitter and citrus. Very crisp, easy-drinking beer. I like it better than the Sierra Nevada APA because its still tasty, but it doesnt hit you over the head with anything. A nice little beer."
"Poured with a nice white creamy head about a half an inch thick.A hazie reddish-orange color. Smells grassy a bit fruity,not much of a hoppy smell,like I remebered the last time I had this.A slight yeasty aroma also.Has an earthy taste.a crisp clean,dry,finish.A mouthwatering finish, a slightly sweet taste also at the end. a very refreshing and quite drinkable beer."
"This is a great beer. I really enjoyed it."
"D: A good PA, but at $8.99-$9.99 per sixer, there are better to be had for cheaper."
"Overall: This is a sturdy and very good American Pale. A worthy adversary to Sierra Nevada this is. However, being on the East Coast, this is a much more expensive option. Top notch beer."
"Drinkability: Drink as many as you see fit."
"This is a highly drinkable beer that I find to be a nice change of pace from the usual EPA or IPA. A beer I find myself wanting more than one of."
"Slightly misty, copper orange colour with a medium sized white head and good lacing. Aroma is fruity (banana, citrus) and floral hop. Tastes of flowery hops with some vanilla and fruit flavours apparent. Some bitterness. Light/medium mouthfeel and low carbonation. Overall a very decent APA."
"D- a very nice APA that I would have again"
"Pours a hazy apricot with a frothy white head with bubble craters forming at the top. Some lacing present. Big malty nose with butterscotch notes and grapefruit scented hops. Flavors Start off with that butterscotch note which then leads into a mix of bready malts and grapefruit hoppiness, then finishes with a light fruitiness, which tastes more derived from the malts than the hops, accopmanied by a moderate hop bitterness. Perfect. Mouthfeel is moderate thickness with a very soft carbonation. Enough body to linger on the palate but not too much so that it forms a film. Damn near perfect session beer if it wasn't for the substantial abv."
"An American classic."
"D- One of the finer examples of an American Pale ale. Very balanced and smooth. Super drinkable and goes good with everything, anytime."
"If you feel like a dry beer that's full of flavor and aroma without being totolly hopcrazy, this is a good pick."
"Overall an impressive APA that is slowly becoming a favorite."
"Drinkability: I think Anchor Steam's a little overrated, but I'm a huge advocate for Anchor Liberty, and it makes one hell of a session beer too."
"Overall, this is a very quality ale. Again, it reminds me a lot of Arrogant Bastard, but not quite as...arrogant. Thus, the drinkability is higher, but the flavor is lacking (only slightly, though). This is a very great brew, altogether. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is also very high and I will definitly be repeating my purchase."
"D - I like this beer a lot. One of the better Pales I have had to date."
"Cheers!"
"A classic summer ale that could be had year round. Possibly the quintessential American Pale Ale."
"The aroma has a fruity estery quality to it, subdued but noticeable. There is the briefest glimmer of a yummy malt taste, but it is not strong enough for my liking, and while there was hoppy bitterness, there was no hop aroma, and the hop flavor was unappealing. While I thought there were elements of taste and smell that I liked, they are barely apparent. The malt/hop combination does not seem well-balanced, to my palate."
"Quite a delicious APA, and one that is readily available. Highly recommended."
"The alcohol smell and flavor obscured the beer. I did not want another."
"I'd had this beer several times in the past, but not since I really got into craft beers. I have a much better appreciation for this brew now and was really quite surprised how much I enjoyed it. This is a truly unique brew that is made all the better by its wide availability. Liberty Ale will always have a home in my fridge."
"Unobtrusive medium body and mellow carbonation. Absolutely sessionable."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle at a Taco Mac. Bottle. Good aroma, although it was tough to tell since I had in a smoky bar. Hoppy, fruity taste, with a finish of citrus fruit, primarily grapefruit. A good, smooth drinking beer, and one I will definitely be having more of in hot summer weather."
"M&D: softly-carbonated, medium-bodied, utterly smooth on the palate, with a healthily-balanced palate and a clear hoppy from the nose to throat... The bitter-hoppy flavour sits in contrast to the semi-rich malty+fruity aroma, and is very much my cup of tea! An utterly enjoyable APA which is bound to be one of my all-time favourites!"
"Drinkability: Solid beer, probably wouldn't keep going with this all night though."
"I drank this during the 4th of July weekend and it really hit the spot."
"D: Warm weather beer. Refreshing."
"It reminds me a bit of something else I've had."
"note: a good temperature for drinking this brew seems to be around 10° Celsius (= 50° Fahrenheit), the bitterness is a bit too dominant when the beer is colder"
"D: The drinkability is good, although if you're a pale ale fan and looking for something great, then you may opt for something better after having one of these, as it just lacks a big hoppy character. It still is good and refreshing though."
"Pours a dark Gold, huge wispy head that sticks around the entire time, great clarity on the class. Good hop flavor in the beginning, fairly well balanced until a kick at the end comes in. You can definitely taste its strength and hoppiness, very full around the corners. Drinkability is ok, for some reason seems harsher and more filling than other APAs (like your grandfather or something) but certainlty drinkable. Just another great example of the style."
"I discovered this a couple years ago and I have yet to find a better session beer. I'd keep this stocked 24-7 if I could. Growing up as a beer drinker and going through some of the run of the mill macros, this is what I imagined that beer should look, smell and taste like. A true American classic. Cheers."
"Drinks pretty easy will work as session beer for me, not in the upper echelon of APA's but nothing to pass by either. I remember whein it was just this , SNPA & Ballards for this style. Tried & true"
"Pours a murky unfiltered pale yellow/orange color with a small creamy white head. Aroma is light with citrusy hops dominating. Taste starts out with a floral sweetness and hints of citrus that is followed by citrusy hops that finish out the taste. This is a wonderful APA that I recommend to anyone to try. This has enough hops to keep hopheads happy but not too much for those who do not care for brews that are dominated by their presence."
"this is a benchmark APA consistently great and mighty tasty, setting th standard for many a years."
"This is a pretty good pale ale. There is a pretty decent, foamy head to it. I like the strong floral scent, and there is a nice bite to the citrusy west-coast hops. They kind of roll over the tongue, and leave a nice lingering flavor. I would enjoy drinking a few of these."
"Notes: Just a real solid, balanced pale ale, and refreshing enough to be a real good warm-weather brew."
"This brew pours a clear pale reddish-copper color. The head is one finger in height, thick, creamy and recedes slowly. The aroma is everything a pale ale should be: it is well balanced with the hops coming through over the malt slightly lending a nice grapefruit aroma. The taste is as amazing and the aroma with a nice fruity hop kick. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a wonderful pale ale."
"Pours a golden orange color with a white 1/2"" head that quickly dissapates to a lacy cap. Smell is nice combination of caramel, citrus, piney, and floral hops. Taste starts off with a quick caramel sweetness, but is suddenly taken over by a lemon zestiness. Nice complexity yet simple at the same time. Feels good in the mouth. Dry and the carbonation is noticable. This is what an APA should be. The hops are there, but you're not still burping them up the next morning. A nice summertime session ale."
"Overall - An excellent beer....Nothing extraordinary, but very very drinkable... definitely worth a try..."
"A easy drinking brew. A good session beer."
"Overall a decent easy to drink beer."
"Smell is hops and citrus. Very little malt from what I could sense. Taste is hoppy with a hint of grapefruit, but not overly bitter. Mouthfeel is thin, but not watery. This would be a good start for those wanting to try out an IPA/APA."
"D  Solid and easy to drink beer. I look forward to having this many times in the future."
"The taste is along the lines of hops + honeydew melon, or another subtle melon like canteloupe with some bready stickiness in the finish. I'm not really excited about the choice of hops, and not a huge fan of those melons so this isn't really working for me. Mouthfeel is a little watery for my tastes. The drinkability is hurt because I'm not a big fan of the flavors, but there is nothing offensive about this beer. Recommended to fans of light melonzzz."
"This beer poured a straw color with a thin head. There is a fair amount of lacing. There are a good deal of floaters. The taste is fairly bitter. There is not much sweetness here. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth. The bitterness is just right. A good beer I could certainly drink again. A fair example of the style."
"Overall a nice refreshing beer. What an IPA used to be until everyone started to try to be hoppier than the last brewer. Recommended highly for people who like hops but don't necessarily want to chew on them."
"Dvery much so. I would love another. Even thought it is 6% ABV, it might make a good session brew."
"Overall a very drinkable beer."
"This is a very good beer and definitely earns the respect many people hold for it. I drink this one just about every time the local store stocks it, and having it on tap is just as good."
"I'm slowly working my way through Anchor's offerings for a second time (to review) and this one pleasantly surprised me. A very good balanced pale ale, not too heavy on the hops."
"Mouthfeel is good, though leaning toward the too carbonated side right after the pour, but right on par a few minutes later. Disapointed, expecting something more balanced. A fine ale, but not as impressive as I'd hoped after adoring Anchor Porter."
"Very, very drinkable beer. As stated above, it's a hop driven beer, and damned proud of it. Again, not bitter, really, just hop flavored. Very nice, very drinable, and one I'd order again and again. Bravo."
"A great, great beer. I know some will argue for SNPA, but this is the gold standard for APAs in my opinion. Yum."
"Definite hop character in the flavor. Balanced well. Nice and mild. tea-like qualities... seems like an English Pale... a bit dry on the finish."
"Finally decided to review this classic. Pours a light amber color with a small white head. Somewhat hazy. Smell is an even mix of malt and hops. There is a nice citrus pull also--grapefruit and orange--along with fruity apricot. Very nice. Tastes full of malt with a nice hop bitterness. A bit of smoky flavor goes well with the citrussy finish. Well balanced. In the mouth Anchor Liberty Ale is full, bitter and has little carbonation. Pleasant on the palate. On the whole, this is a very good and sessionable (despite the 6% abv) beer. It is very tasty, balanced and enjoyable to drink. Deserving of its respected status."
"CRUX: GREAT HOPPY PALE ALE SESSION BEER. I like this classic better than their other classic (Anchor Steam.) Serious position in the DBF this summer. Great out of the bottle, too...."
"Overall an above average APA in terms of flavor and aroma complexity. If you like this, check out Blue Point Hoptical Illusion."
"Pours cloudy light amber with good carbonation but not much head. Spicy, floral nose (hops), pretty clean. Taste is pretty punchy with a good bit of hops, slight citrus, and a bit more complexity than you expect from a pale ale. Mouthfeel is very lingery though, was expecting a cleaner finish. Altogether, a decent beer for eating a bunch of heavy greasy stuff."
"D: Decent. I could have two of these but do tire after two. The sharpness of them detract quite a bit from the beer."
"The beer poured a very appealling somewhat cloudy yellow with a nice thick creamy head that lingered. It's smell was impressive. It had the floral, hoppy scent with hints of fruitness that's very pleasant. The taste was a bit weaker than the smell led me to believe. It was very refreshing and appetizing. I recommend it with a meal. I imagine it would go well with chicken, pork or fish. It was drinkable, but a bit too bitter for more than one or two at a time."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. I'd definitely recommend it, and would drink it again."
"When I poured it into my mug, the beer was a golden orange color with a less than an inch head of white foam. The head of foam dissipated away no to fast leaving behind very few rings and no lace. At first the aroma wasn't that good. It only had a slight aroma of spicy hops and some fruits and that was it. But when I swirled it around, this nice juicy fruits aroma emerged. Other than that it was just a simple hops and fruit aroma. Up front in the taste were those juicy fruits and after all that, I noticed some grains, little malt, and this all ended with a slight bitter hop taste. What I thought to be a little bit more than an average APA taste. The mouthfeel was carbonated, medium bodied, and watery. Not too watery where it destroyed it. There was just a slight taste of it. I found this beer to be a nice enjoyable fruity ale."
"Would chose better APAs over this one."
"Light orange. Medicinal aroma that is truly repulsive. Its like smelling the inside of an antibiotics container, although there are hints of citrus fruits, peach and spicy hops. The flavor, however, is very distinctive, unique and enjoyable. A lovely fruit filled malty sweetness with hints of honey, all balanced by a generous supply of spicy, herbal and citrusy cascade hops. Much better as it warmed. A pretty good beer overall."
"From a 12 0z. bottle this pours into a decent inch head then subsides into just surface skim leaving minimal lacing. Color- was a meduim orange amber. Aroma- slight hops, but mostly sweet malt. Taste- harshly sweet- diacetyl- yuck ! This was too sweet- the diacetyl would not quit. Mouthfeel was thin with moderate carbonation. Drinkability, I do not like this and will avoid it."
"Taste: Starts lightly biscuity, moves to earthy, leafy and fairly dry flavors with just a tiny hint of butter. Medium hop level, with a sort of vegetative feel. Light carbonation makes this a flavorful but easy to drink choice. Very well balanced, one of those beers that just requires another sip, and then another, without pushing any one flavor aspect over the others."
"Poured from the distinctive Anchor bottle into a Goose Island pint glass, anyone out there can get me an Anchor glass, I'd be eternally grateful. As much as I love Anchor Steam Beer, this is my first Liberty Ale. It does not dissapoint. Poured with a very thick tan head, on a light copper colored body. It is very carbonated, it is not as dark as other west coast pale ales, but it is looks just as delicious. Nose is very fruity and floral, clean yeast is in the nose, slight grain, but mainly fruit, flora and yeast. The mouth is very fruity, can't detect the yeast, extremely clean hop bitterness that lies on the center of your tongue for a few seconds afterwards with an oily lick left behind. Damn, I need to buy this beer more often."
"-Oelergud"
"D- This is a very smooth dry beer that has lots of qualities of an American all-grain lager with noble hops. The citrus hops add a nice twist, but it is a very ""safe"" beer for BMC drinkers. The malt is distinct and the hops are heavy on the bitter and light on the aroma and flavor."
"Once again, Anchor has done an excellent job on this one. Along with Sierra Nevada, they are producing some top-notch domestic beers."
"I could drink several of these."
"Big creamy white head sitting atop a clear orange-copper body. The nose features semi-sweet earthy hops along with a faint trace of orange. A medium-to-strong bitterness takes hold of the palate at the onset, accompanied by hints of minerals. A gentle fruitiness is next, followed by faint malt. The finish follows a bitter-fruity-bitter progression. This isn't your typical PNW hop explosion of an APA, and in this sense Liberty Ale offers something unique."
"Pours a straw color, crystal clear bubble, effervecent brew. Choppy, half inch head fades quickly but with good tracing. Hops are very much present in the aroma, with some biscuity malty background. Flavors of the top of a well baked biscuit, I can distinguish it very well. I'm mad I poured this straight from the fridge as I know it needs a while to warm up since I can't pick up a whole lot in the aroma/flavors. But it is very balanced, light in body, carbonated well, and an overall very drinkable, sessionable beer. Certainly something I could switch back and forth between SN Pale Ale for an everyday beer if it wasn't so expensive here."
"Overall: Truly wonderful beer. Maybe if the ABV were a little less I'd consider it a true session beer. If you have not tried this beer then go get it right now."
"D - Excellent, off-the-hook drinkability. One of the most drinkable beers I have ever had. A little lower ABV and $$ and this would be my ultimate session!!"
"Pours out an orangish color with a nice creamy little head. The beer is a little too hazy, maybe from the refrigerator, who knows. Smells nice and citrusy. Has a great cascade hop smell. The beer tastes perfect. Exceptionally well balanced. The hops have a nice fruity, citrusy flavor. A nice sweetness. Not very bitter. The kind of beer I could drink all day. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean."
"This is a great ale; Very flavorful, but not quite a session beer. It's got a bit of alcoholic punch that makes it a sipper."
"ALA pours a hazy 14 ct. gold color with a respectable slightly chunky head. Nose is a very elegant tangerine-orange-peach combination with pine and hops peeking through the front end of this brew. The presentation on the tongue reveals robust fine carbonation and a solid bitterness and moderate dryness, quite well balanced. Flavors of lime and to a lesser degree lemon appear in the taste and linger long enough to suggest that this beer is well flavored and well permeated with hopping. The mouthfeel is bright and lively; partially due to the fine carbonation as well as the copious citric element present, this keeps the drinkability factor somewhat elevated. Although this is a well-engineered brew, true to the style, I would like to see a bit more body and warmth, but the less endowed nature of this particular selection is likely to continue this session a little further into the evening!"
"Pours a light yellow-amber with a thin finger of white head that subsides quickly to a thin cap, which then leave behind a moderate amount of scattered lacing. Nose is a moderate dose of piney hops, with some faints note of caramel and apple and pear. Taste is more of the same, a nice full pale malt with a hint of caramel, giving way to a slightly fruity and nicely hopped finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbontion, slightly dry. This is a solid pale ale, but nothing really stands out about it, and the fact that there are readily available local substitutes usually keeps me away from this one. However, it's a very good beer, just like any other Anchor produces."
"D - If I were more into bar scenes, this would probably be my APA of choice. I am not enthralled with the style like many, but this one impresses me. I would definitely session this, and it could wash down many a meal. It went extemely well with the goat brie I had with it. If the oppurtnity arises, I will definitely enjoy this one again."
"this is truly an American classic, one of those beers i'm really proud are an American creation. drink this in large quantities."
"Pours a hazy amber color, with a frothy head that hangs around for a while, providing good lacing....Aroma is clean, slightly fruity, not overpowering at all...The taste of this beer makes it worth the price to me, a little malty at the start, hops coming out on the way down, and sticking around for a pleasant finish that leaves you wanting more...Nice medium body, and moderate carbonation make this brew very drinkable, and one my personal favorites. Anchor has a real winner with this one!"
"Stubby 12 oz brown bottle with freshenss code ""5NB."" To crack the code, I visited the the Anchor website to reveal the beer was bottled on 11/02/05. Pours a hazy golden honey color with a thick frothy, long lasting head. Smell is clean and fresh with lots of piney, citrusy notes. Taste smooth and very well rounded between the citrusy hops and biscuity malts. Good dry hop twang at the finish. About as good as it gets here in South Carolina."
" More malty taste than in many APA's, not all hops and yeast. Solid bitter aftertaste and active mouthfeel. Very easy drinking and probably a crossover beer for both traditional ale fans and hop heads alike. Easier than I thought to polish off a sixer, that's for sure."
"D  This would get even better after Id had a couple to help mellow out the hops. Great beer, and finished the last little bit with pizzammm."
"Drinkability: Refreshingly pleasant, almost Germanic in some respects"
" This may be my new favorite APA. Recommended! I'll need to get more of this."
"Just a superb beer in every way that counts."
"Overall: An excellent brew. If you've never tried this one you owe it to yourself to do so as soon as possible."
"Taste is quite nice, a bitterness enters with a sweetness that follows nicely. Exceptionally smooth and dangerously drinkable. This is some pretty good stuff."
"Nose is mildly hoppy and I can pick out some vaguely sweet malts. Also getting bits of orange rind in the beer. Very nicely balanced and extremely enjoyable beer. Medium body that had a slightly dry finish. The flavor kind of emanates up the back of the nose."
"Carbonation-streaked orange-peach juice with a billowy off-white 1/2"" head. Zingy citrus aromas of grapefruit and tangelo rind and candied orange slices. Citrus-inflected flavors dominate too, but in a far less astringent way: mellow orange (not yellow) and sweet ruby red grapefruit juice. Light doughy malt presence -- noticeable only in the ""even-keeled"" hop temperence acheived, so I guess I don't really detect much malt -- this is all about the hops. But this is not out of line! Unlike any other beer I've tasted, and unlike anything I was expecting -- almost a revelation! Clean, juicy mouthfeel and incredibly easy to drink. This is not the most balanced pale ale I've ever tried, but as a hop head I think it's quite possibly my favorite, even if it's not the lupulin blast of others. Simply great. Cheers, Fritz!"
"This is great. Balanced. Interesting. Subtle. Complex. Great Brewery."
"Agolden/coppper color, with a nice head lacing down nicely. Light citrusy, floral aromas come with first scent. Initially the taste of roasted barley and malt jit the palate, and then the hops come through and dominate the flavor. Slightly watery in the mouth, and has a good dry finish. After a few more sips this beer becomes easier to drink, and the flavor becomes more appealing to the palate. This is a good beer over all, I just expected more from the flavor."
"Overall, I'm not going to change my score at all; the current one speaks for itself as a testament to how much I like this American Pale Ale. One of *the* best in the style!"
"This has become my favorite ale and one of my favorite beers."
"I've often heard this beer described as some kind of ode to the Cascade hop, and after trying it I can see why. Appearance is quite solid -- the beer itself is a beautiful just-shy-of-clear orangey amber, and the head is substantial at first, although it eventually fades into a thin white film on top of the beer. Smell is full of those great citrusy Cascade smells, but there's also some creamy notes in there. Taste is outstanding -- sweet and sour hop flavors combined with the malt mean that every part of your tongue is active with this brew. There's no acrid feeling to this beer -- just spicy, flavorful hops. Extremely well balanced. Mouthfeel is a rarity, in a good way: this beer, according to the bottle, contains no artificial carbonation, and it certainly feels that way when drinking it. There's a very fine carbonation, enough certainly to tickle your tongue but no large carbonation bubbles... it's the difference between California sparkling wine and Champagne (with Anchor Liberty playing the part of Champagne, duh). Overall, a wonderful, quaffable beer."
"Pours rusty gold, with decent clarity. The dense, snow -white head rushes to fill the glass, then gracefully settles out at two fingers, and retains very well. Some sticky lacing is left over lively streams of tiny bubbles. Toasted malt and wheat nose, with some citrus/apple fruit aromas and faint, indistinct hops. Malt is sweet and estery, with a strong toasted character; and herbal hops wash over in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel never becomes dry, but also never gets slippery...very smooth. Medium body and a light, even carbonation. Finish retains some mild ester, and hints at diacetyl, but totally approriate and balnced for the style. A well-balanced and and near perfectly executed APA."
"Overall drinkability is really high. I could drink quite a few of these so long as they didn't catch up to me too fast."
"Overall a very good beer. I reviewed it in the bottle, but i think i prefer this one on tap."
"Only a one cm head on this one, although the carbonation appears pretty active. The color is a beautiful clear copper/orange. Smell is of strong hops, piney, dank, and resiny. Taste is not not very sweet at first, but very clean. Hops start to dominate and it yields a modest bitterness at the end. After a few more sips the malt flavor starts to come out, but it is still a bit timid. The beer feels slightly thin, but not bad overall. There is plenty of carbonation present in the mouthfeel. A good hoppy flavor, it could have used more malt balance, but it still went down pretty easily and got better toward the end..."
"Anchor's Liberty Ale is obviously an extremely well-crafted ale, unfortunately it isn't to my taste exactly. It is a pale gold color with a thick white head that leaves a nice lacing. The hops dominate the aroma. They seem a bit harsh and have a rotten fruit component to them. The taste is a actually a bit harsh, dominated by a hop character that doesn't appeal to me. Very bitter and full of a rotten fruitiness that dominates a malt base that is looking to come forward, but is never really able to. The abrasiveness lingers through the finish. This beer doesn't work for me as an APA because there isn't enough blance between the hops and malt and it doesn't work as an IPA because the hops just don't taste good enough. The mouthfeel is good with an appropriate amount of carbonation. The drinkability isn't very good because I just don't really care for the taste of it."
"From the bottle to me pint, poured a pleasant dark orange with a little haze , medium and quickly fading head. Aroma is of citrusy,floral, and clean-green hop smells. Taste is great! More on the bitter side with hoppy-herbal citrus and some yeast. Balanced with some sweet-smoothness and good natural carbonation. This is one good beer. Very unique , very fresh , and very drinkable. Nice use of cascade hops. I will be buying alot more of these tasty APAs from San Fran."
"This beer pours a cloudy amber orange with a nice white head that holds well but does not lace that much. Overall it is a ""good"" looking pale ale. The beer smells of a nice mixture of floral and citrus sweetness. The taste brings back these floral and citrus flavors but also balances with a nice amount of bitterness. There is a good mouthfeel. This is fairly thick pale ale with a good carbonation and a bit of dryness. Overall it is one of the best pale ales I have had and would really enjoy drinking it again."
"D: Easy to drink for sure. Very nice."
"Very tasty, drinkable satisfying beverage. Not objectionable qualities of sight and smell. Easy mouthfeel, medium bodied. Just a well-made citrusy beer. Good C hops, and understated as U have found in Pales. Clean and crisp brought in fresh from LCBO."
"Drinkability  Goes down pretty easy could be satisying on a summer day but this one didn't grab me"
"This beer was decent, but not as good as I expected. If I was choosing an APA, I would definitely opt for Sierra Nevada Pale Ale instead."
"Good APA very close to an IPA in my opinion. It is very balanced and I will definitely be looking for this when the warm weather shows up. Another good beer from Anchor brewing. Keep up the great work!!"
"Ahhh, a piney/grassy aroma that tells me right away: hops live here. And do they ever, the aroma gives way to a piney flavor with a bitterness that lingers. Exquisite!"
"D = Very drinkable. See myself drinking a few per session if it was cheaper."
"Poured a hazed, rich golden amber into a pint glass with a rich, foamy head that lasted fairly long before falling to moderate cream-colored lacing. Carbonation is quite active and visible even through the haze of this ale. Smell is a bouquet of floral hops, with a hint of grainy citrus as well. Tastes bitter and hoppy, one of the hoppiest APA's I've sampled, can taste some grapefruit, leaves a similar bitter aftertaste. Dry on the tongue, finished crisp, enjoyable."
"However, I'll be picking this one up again from time to time."
"Overall: A very nice APA that one can drink all day in the summer or enjoy with a nice meal."
"Wow. This is an excellent, perfect example of what an american pale ale, and really, most american ales, should taste like. this is the standard. very hoppy, american beer, with great undertones of slight citrus. a bit acidic aftertaste, but good in a lot of ways. its great being an american."
"I would recomend buying a six pack after trying a single."
"Anchor steam liberty is the perfect 4th of July beer and can be drank anytime!! Interesting, very hoppy brew. Has a terrific head, nice appearance, and if sipped on for awhile, can taste the floral banana mixed in the brew. Very good price for a high quality beer and can be used as a terrific session beer. Big, big, hops for the hopheads!!"
"Simply put, this is my favorite Pale Ale of them all. That being said, I find it to be distinctly, and pleasantly, different from most other pale ales. The appearance is quite appealing--the color is a dark amber that suggests a healthy dose of malt was used to brew this beer. The smell is what you would expect for a Pale Ale--plenty of robust english and american hops to go with some enticingly earthy malts. First taste is delicious--the malt flavor is sweeter and stronger than I expected, and is very tasty. I detect a prominent citrus note, perhaps the result of some cascade hops present in the boil. Mouthfeel is excellent; let there be no doubt, this is a man's brew. I generally find most pale ales to be a little sharp for session drinking, but the perfect balance of this brew certainly promotes multiples. Damn good beer."
"This beer goes great with pizza or anyhting spicy, and is a great session beer. Its the perfect 4th of July beer."
"effin fantastic. ive been debating myself (and my wife) about how i could knock this down from a 5. i just cant do it. sometimes i think i/we expect too much from a beer. this one has it all, and it deserves to be rewarded. thanks to the people at anchor."
"such a pleasure to drink, this is obviously a microbrew masterpiece and my new favorite APA."
"A very nice beer. Much better than I had given it credit for. Very easy to drink due to a medium malt flavor, pronounced (but not overbearing) hop flavor and aroma, and a light - medium body. Carbonation and hop drying causes a refreshing and palate clensing drink. Enough play on hop and malt character to add a much needed complexity. Hop spiciness with sweet malt profile makes, in every sip, something different to find. Mildly rusty and thin in the finish. A good beer, but not enough umph to score over a 4.0."
"Opinion: I really like this beer, and after this review, I think that it has pushed its way to the top couple IPA's on my list. It has plenty of body and mouthfeel, while still having an aggressive hop profile. What I like the most about this beer, is the same as I do for the Great Divide beers...they are mostly balanced in the finish and reflect some clean water. It seems that a WHOLE LOT of breweries over ""Burtonize"" their water in an effort to make an IPA...the result is a harsh and almost undrinkable beer. This example is very palatable."
"This beer pours a hazy golden/orange has a thick two finger white head with great retention and moderate lacing. The aroma is very inviting spicy, nutty, grains and floral hops. The taste is of toasted malts and an explosion of citrus hops. This is a beer that I could drink everyday, and I highly reccomend it!"
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, with a good bite and some nice complexities."
"Again, this beer gets the 'meh' sticker. Nothing I'd go out of my way to find, but certainly better than the average macrobrew."
"Drinkability - The taste of this brough my rating down a lot. Also this would be hard to get through more than one a night. Very sad showing from Anchor."
"Good hop character and intensity, yet a little too buttery for the style. Easy drinking, especially for warmer weather."
"My opinion of Anchor was raised after revisting this beer."
"Overall impression: This beer is the benchmark for American pale ales. Well made, drinkable, and interesting enough to keep you coming back for more."
"mouthfeel is nice and light with a good bite. i love this beer its my absolute favorite to reach for in the fridge any time. ive put down many a 12 pack. it doesnt get much better than anchor liberty."
"It's a good enough beer for me to not pour out, but not so good that I'd spend more money on it, when I can find better beers for the money."
"Slightly orageish-amber with a thin whitish head quickly reduced to a splotchy film. Smells of toasty malt touched with some caramel and just a note of citrus under bitter hop. A nice APA that comes off on the sweet and juicy side. Seems to have perhaps some German malts in there, caramel malty flavor and much less biscuity malt. Hops are bitter, but well-balanced, knowing just when to bite. A light refreshing brew, but not enough carbonation for ""crisp."" Pretty drinkable, but not super APA."
"cheers..."
"Drinkability: An interesting pale ale. After a bomber, the fruitiness is getting a bit much. I think just a bit more bittering hoppiness would be to my liking, but still a fine brew."
"This beer to me, has set the precedent on what an American Pale Ale should be. Beautiful semi-hazy pour with a delicate head and an awesome smell of hops that are getting ready to kick the bad day I just had right in the ass. This beer with any spicy dish would be a likely candidate for my last meal on death row."
"Almost tastes like a pale ale, the bubbles are just as noticable at the top as further down along in the sample. The hops are felt less and less the more you get to the bottom, but the substance of the beer remains the same and subletly reminds me of the flagship Anchor Steam - nicely brewed, enjoyable, and slightly addicting. The Liberty Ale is definitely worth a shot and nice to watch progress from the first sip to the last swill."
"Pours a gold color with off-white head that doesn't hold for very long. Heavy amount of carbonation and very translucent. I detect some malt and hop aromas, but not much else; not really appealing. The taste is rather plain for this style with equal amounts of hop & malt in the taste. This beer is well-balanced in that the bitterness is offset by a malt presence, but there is little else going on in this beer. Not as interesting and flavorful as other pale ales. There isn't much of an aftertaste. Overall, I think this beer falls far short of Anchor's other brews and can't compare to other beers of this style."
"D: Easy drinker, though I'm restrained by that soapy flavour."
"This beer is better than an above average APA. I'd give it an 85 to 88/100 rating."
"This is a nice looking beer.A very large two finger head,but the color is a little light for my tastes.this looks like a lager.This beer has a earthy aroma.Its a bit grassy,with a slight hop and malt smell.The taste is very good,not great,but it does have a fruit/veggie malty flavor.It does have a little light m/f,but it's not bad.All in all,this is a good beer,not great, but one that could be an everyday beer."
"Pours a hazy peach color with a finger of head that falls to a nice thick coat over top with a ton of thick lace. Nose is pretty nice. I get notes of orange and light spicy hop. Enticing. Flavor is Right there as well. Caramel and light orangey notes, with some spicy hop and a very light bitterness hanging on the finish. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Pretty nice brew. I would like to have this on a nice warm day. Easy session beer."
"Drinkability: Scary good, if I wanted I could put away the whole 6 in a setting, but then I'd be hurting and needing to get more, so I'll have to stop at 2 and have the rest later. At one time I was a pretty dedicated Steam drinker (I had a roomate who loved the stuff), I can't beleive that I had never tried this before! Definitely recommended."
"Wow. This beer looks truly incredible. This is my ideal and definitive example of a rocky head. A pale yellow-orange color, hazy, topped off by a creamy off-white head that holds the most amazingly solid shapes and contours, even as it moves down in level of the glass. Truly beautiful. Creamy. The smell is hops: bittering and aromatic, floral, crisp, appetizing. Taste is again, overwhelmingly hoppy, and of the floral variety, but some balancing malt is present too, just to keep from being too bitter (for the feint of heart). Easy to drink. Two thumbs up."
"All in all drinkable and an interesting twist on the style. I've always found Anchor brews to have an unusual yeasty flavor and this one was no exception."
"Overall: One of the most well balanced brews out there (along with Red Seal Ale). A really nice rendition of a classic APA."
"Flavor was stupendous. Great caramel and cocoa laden malty brew, with sharp hop bite on the front and smooth herbal/piney hops on the back. Just enough to know they are packin', but not enough to hurt your mouth. Strong, but tasty and just right. Worth several."
"notes: my goodness...that is a good beer. woo! definately going to get a 6 of this next time i buy beer. wow!"
"Very drinkable, much like Anchor Steam, one of my all time favorites. Easily could be one of my new favorite session beers."
"Notes: I'm always impressed by this brew. Sierra Nevada, Stone, and Anchor to me are what brewers should look to as the king of pale ale's and strive to achieve their greatness."
"A very well crafted and interesting pale ale but it's not my thing. Those west coast hops are not always to my liking... those of you that enjoy them there hops should be all over this one."
"The beer after its extraction from the 12-once brown stubby bottle sets in the glass translucent golden amber with a modest frothy off-white head, and after its erosion the resultant lace forms a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt, crisp and clean almost lime-like, start is somewhat sweet with a nice grain profile, top is light to moderate in feel. Finish is sturdy in its acidity, the hops delectably spicy and the aftertaste desert bone dry, another long time favorite beer from a long time favorite brewery."
"Pours a nice clear copper color, with a small head that leaves a ring and some lacing. Aroma is fruity and spicy, with some apple and coriander present in the nose, strong hoppy smell. Taste is fruity, pleasantly hoppy, and perfectly bitter with the malt balancing it all very well. Some light wheat-like tastes linger in the mouth for a moment. Mouthfeel is just right, with perfect carbonation and phenolic smoothness balancing each other perfectly. A very drinkable, wonderful session ale."
"overall: i can't help but compare this apa to alpha king. not even close. may make a good session beer, but there are better out there. average in my opinion, but a must try as this is a legendary brewery and seems to hit the spot for others."
"Head is big,white, and frothy on top of this clear light gold beer. Rings of lace make for a nice look. Aroma is balanced between rounded orangy fruitiness and doughiness. Flavor wavers between sweetness and bitterness, with a pleasant tingly bite at the start. The real beauty here lies in the gentle leafy character of the hops! So wonderful! Fades into a light citrus and cocoa aftertaste that seems a little muted. This is a very enjoyable, everyday type of beer. While the stupid bottle codes bother me, I will still buy this every once in a while."
"Gold with red hints. Smells of citrus, lavender and a bit of sulfur. Very hoppy in flavor, with white grapefruit and some white grape flavors. Not much caramel malt flavor at all, but that's not such a bad thing in this case. Good carbonation helps to give it a nice refreshing quality. Hides the alcohol very well. Long and pleasently bitter finish as well. I would definitely buy this again."
"This is just a great anytime beer. Well rounded, not over complicated, and very easy to drink. Classic APA."
"Real good, if you like beer and feel like a smooth, lightly complex and tasty brew, there's little reason to not get this occasionally or frequently."
"Very smooth with a dry hops finish. Refreshing. Tasty and very drinkable.."
"Poured into a Anchor Steam Glass. Was golden in color with excellent carbonation, but a small head that disappeared fast. Not much lacing afterwards as well. Nice malty, hoppy scents. It does taste a little different than other APAs I've had. Goes down really smooth, not much of a bite afterwards though. Very drinkable and would make a nice session brew at 6%."
"Man, Anchor makes some pretty beers. Liberty Ale is a clear golden color, light but not weak. It also maintains an attractive white head throughout. Smells and tastes sweet and florally hoppy, very simple, very fresh, very good. Rich, creamy mouthfeel. This beer would be an excellent example for the non-BA of how hops can be a great things. Just a really simple and tasty beer."
"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Anchor beers, and this was a good beer, but it didn't strike me as being truly worthy of the Anchor label. It was decent, I'd have it again if nothing else looked good, and it by no means disgraces the good name of craft beers. It just doesn't do it for me, thats all."
"Pours a hazey golden color with a small head that turns to lace after a couple minutes. Smells grainy. The malt hits first as I tasted It with some hop bitterness at the back end. Quite different from many other APA's I've tasted.Goes down very smooth. An extremely drinkable APA that I find especially nice on hot summer days."
"poured a peach-amber color, slightly cloudy with nice white head that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is essentially hoppy with a background fruit and pine scent. Taste is hoppy, but quickly fades to reveal a nice fruitiness. Nice dry aftertaste. Good beer but nothing special."
"I would buy this one again for sure, ranks at the top of APAs for sure."
"It was a highly enjoyable beer, one that I would like to return to in the near future. I can see this livening up a barbecue or other event, as its lightness, combined with assertive flavors, would attract even non-BAs. I highly recommend this beer, though I am not sure if it is the consummate representative of the American Pale Ale style."
"I tend to think that this beer is a bit overrated but it is easily available and not a bad choice by any means."
"Pours a clear amber/copper colour, ample white head and plenty of lace. Really pretty looking beer. Piney northwest hop aroma, but the malt backbone is very detectable in the nose, nice breadiness. Taste is all hops, citrusy hops from front to back, malt is detectable but plays second fiddle to the hops, but thats okay. Taste is very full, good body, real smooth. Excellent ale on a hot day, or any day for that matter. A classic."
"This beer poured a nice clear golden orange color with a nice fluffy off-white head. The aromas were a mixture of floral hops , toasted malt and a slight caramel scent. The taste was of a very, very slight smokey caramel/malt/honey and finished up with a bitterness from the hops. The after taste stuck around of a bitter hop. Overall it wasn't a strong flavored beer, but it was very balanced. I love this brewery, I haven't been let down yet."
"Anchor Liberty is an ale I have recently rediscovered. I first sampled it in my early ""beyond Bud"" days and remember it to be a hoppy ale. In recent tastings it proves to be a perfect example of an aromatic brew. Aromas of Cascade hops, ale yeast fruitiness, and malt background make for a great beer to keep under your nose. Fine(small bubble) natural carbonation and a creamy head give a quaffable mouthfeel. Some feel this beer should be labeled an IPA instead of a pale ale. Take into account this beer's birthday, April 18th 1975(I was 4) to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Paul Revere's ride, well before american IPA's gained popularity.(Ballintine IPA maybe?) This beer should be sought fresh and sought often. World class."
"Appearance is a cloudy orange with some foam an lacing. Aroma has yeast, hops, bananas, crackers and malts. Initial taste contains malt, honey, and lemony hops with some wintergreen and spice. Yeast rises to the surface to remind us that this is an ale. Awesome crafting. A very good ale."
"What can you say about an American institution. This is the true craft brew for American pale ales. The hop bitterness should put it into the IPA style. A hop bitterness explosion that after a session leaves you tasteless. The body is full and the golden hue with its big head is stunning to look at! A great brew for any occasion, but a true session APA for all seasons."
"Fine looking pour, a blend of amber, orange and yellow, topped off by a creamy white head that laced all the way. Very malty aroma, not much of anything else. Heavy malt flavor and tasty, but no flavors stand out. Thick, full bodied ale. Exceptional drinking brew, rich in the mouth, but not *heavy*. A good, sturdy ale for the longhaul, year round."
"This one pours a mostly clear orange with a frothy white head which leaves a satifying amount of lacing. The nose is pine, citrus and apricot. The carbonation level is slightly lighter than average, but it's fine that way. Liberty Ale has that crisp hop bite (from one or more of the Big C's, probably Cascade) and fruity citrus flavors that you'd expect from an American Pale Ale. It tastes so smooth and creamy and it has plenty of bitterness to keep it interesting. This is as much the benchmark Pale Ale, in my opinion, as SNPA."
"This really is an American classic in that it really helped introduce hops in the pale ale. Mid gold with a worthy head this beer is redolent of hops and malt. When you get a few sips in you notice the real balance and complexity of this beer. Like Sam Adams Lager or SNPA this beer defines drinkability combined with a sense of care and attention. This is a go to beer for many including myself when I can get my hands on some."
"Very drinkable..I could easily drink this IPA for a full session. And I will next BBQ."
" A wonderful tasty ale, havent been this excited about a beer since Duvel."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean, very easy to drink, very satisfying and quenching. Wish I could make this at home. Better in the bottle than on tap."
"This is good beer, it still tastes good after many years of drinking it. As long as it's fresh, you know this will always be a solid choice for a sessionable brew."
"easy drinkibility, initially surprised by the bitterness, but that subsides"
"Rolling hop flavors start piney, then orangey, then wraps around a crisp pie crust, and comes back with a fresh chard kiss. This one isn't as clean as I remember. Heck of a pale ale, seems a shame to call it pale, I found it quite rich."
"Mouthfeel was good but not outstanding. Likewise for drinkability... an OK session beer, but just a little better than average."
"D&N: Super beer, and easy to see why this is a classic. Very drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours out a very clear pale yellow color with a substantial white head. Smell is floral and citrusy. Taste is very smooth. Upfront this brew is nicely bitter, but also has the grapefruit citrusiness that is classic cascade. I don't like my hops to be all grapefruit, so this is really not my thing. There is some lingering fruitiness to this, due to the yeast, but it isnt very noticable. The mouthfeel on this one is very clean and easy drinking. Not a bad beer at all, I know it is a classic, but I will reach for others first."
"Damn tasty, and just as drinkable."
"Pours with a 2 finger white head that leaves crazy lacing all the way down the glass, the body is a pale golden color thats crystal clear. The smell is raw, herbal/medicinal hops with a mildy sweet, honey-like malt backbone. The taste is quite complex (as expected from anchor) starts with an earthy hoppy flavor that coast the mouth with a resiny hop oil, and continues with sweet honey like malt taste. The malt taste is almost like doughnuts, and ends with a bitter, grassy and floral hops finish that lingers on your tongue briefly, you really get some complex hop flavors here with a spicy flavor that follows a fruity citrus like taste. The hops definately outshine the malt here but what did you expect from an APA, from the west coast no less. The mouthfeel is smooth and light with moderate carbonation. An excellent APA, really showcases that western hops flavor well without overdoing it. Could be a great session brew as the alcohol hides itself fairly well."
"I am generally not a fan of Hoppy Pale Ales. This one along with Boulevard is a pleasant exception to the rule. Pours a clear yellow orange, with a 1-finger white head that lasts and leaves creamy lacing in its wake. The aroma is a delightful balance of malt, good hops, with some citrus and other unidentified spice. The taste is initially sweet malt and later hoppy, grapefruit-bitter, balanced underneath with biscuit malts. The citrusy/spicy bite makes this a crisp refreshing brew, a staple. A balanced ale, of the quality I have come to expect from Fritz Maytag and Anchor. Keep this on hand for guests...or myself."
"overall a great IPA, just not labeled as such. bitter, bracing and brilliant."
"Wowww. Awesome brew. The bottles are cool also. Great hoppy smell right when you burst it open. Nice looking orangey yellow color with a nice head. The mouthfeel is moderate and sorta bitey/ fizzy. Great floral hoppy flavors that are in your face. Really reminiscent of sierra nevandas ipa which is a goood thing."
"Decent brew here, though it smells better than it tastes. Very complex cloves and brown sugar smell, with a hint of raspberry. Taste is disappointing, though. Bitter lingering aftertaste and not much complexity to the palette. Very carbonated, so you gotta go easy on these to prevent gastric distress..."
"Anyways this isn't really anything to rave or write home about but it is tasty... I got it on sale for 5.50 a sixer and i don't regret it... A classic you might say ....i'm not fond of the regular west coast pale taste but this is quite different..."
"Appearance is a golden amber marked by a slight chill haze. Foamy white heads springs up to top it all off. Good lacing. Smell is good, but subdued. Earthy notes with some pungent hops and a little toasty character. Taste is mellow yet complex. Hops are immediately apparent, but do not overpower. Some creamy pale malt leads to toasty and biscuity flavors. Finishes slightly bitter with a hint of alcohol. This beer is remarkably creamy and dry. Low carbonation increases the creaminess and thicker mouthfeel. This is an APA for people who aren't quite hopheads. Even if you are, you can still enjoy this easy drinking beer. So smooth, you'd almost think it was a lager."
"Very drinkable, and the moutfeel is good"
"Unique ale. A touch of sediment was present, was suspended in the glass and no deposits at the bottom. Fruity, floral aroma. Flavors of sharp citrus and stewed hops were most present, with a slightly alcoholic and malty aftertaste. One of the better brews from Anchor Brewing. Recommended."
"A shockingly average to borderline miss from the Anchor folks. Oh well, at least I still have the Steam and the Porter to savour."
"Taste: Good cookie malt presence, bitterness has more bite than your average pale ales, but smoother than an IPA. I really, really enjoyed this one. Proof once more that, for me at least, balance and nuance beats exaggeration and obstreperousness (my secret word for today)."
"Perhaps taken for granted by those with easy, everyday access to it, and it's been around for quite some time, but I have to say this is one of the true exemplar standards of the American Pale Ale style, one that has held its own over the years, and deserves respect. My fridge should be full of this stuff. Anchor Liberty Ale, I salute you."
"I have a lot of positive nostalgia for these guys- the rightful claim to craft beer's early crown- unlike the Boston Brewing crowd."
"Nice light yellow orange body with a white head on top which slowly disappeared to a thin layer of bubbles. Aroma is loaded with hops which range from grapefruit to a nice resin pine aroma. Overall very typical hop profile from a west coast pale ale. There is also a nice malty sweet balance. The flavor has less of the grapefruit flavors and more of the pine resin aspect. Finish is slightly bitter. Mouthfeel is medium, not as thick and oily as some, but definitely coats better than others. This is a typical session beer of mine so of course its highly drinkable. Definitely a classic."
"For someone who generally likes more malt than hop flavor in his brews, I really liked this beer. The Anchor Brewing Company has a winner in this beer."
"One of the great beers from the early microbrew revolution in America, this is a real classic, and far better than Anchor's flagship Steam, in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Like said, not as good as I expected, but I could definitely through down several of these while shooting some pool."
"Pours a hazy straw color. Good head and head retention on this. I was amazed by the lacing this beer left on the glass. There is a slight metallic aroma going on in this beer. This is an interesting take on the American Ale in the flavor department. It's bitter, with a hint of malt, but I don't get the overload of grapefruit/citrus that I get in other American Ales. Interesting. More malt should probably shine through in my book. Decent beer, a good solid standby."
"At 6% it will catch up a bit quicker, but man it's pretty drinkable."
"12 oz. bottle with a batch code on the back. Pours orange with a nice 2 finger head that leaves decent lacing. Smells like crisp floral/citric hops. Bitterness hits first with citric/pine/grassy/floral hops and malts in the back that contribute notes of bread and biscuits. Bitterness lingers. Malts are more pronounced near the end of the beer. Very prominent hops that coat the mouth well and the carbonation feels smooth. Last sips are heavenly. I could drink many of these. I just wish it were cheaper."
"A beer that should be gone back to from time to time to see how far we've come ... and now NOT far we've come. 9/10 brewpubs couldn't make a beer that could stand up to this classic."
"Taste is floral bitter hops up front. Tea leaf flavors. Crisp, lightly sweet pale malt. The citrus has disappeared. Not much to it but well balanced and a nice crisp mouth. I wouldn't say it's light bodied but relatively light on the tongue but stil full flavored. A well crafted treat that ""goes down easy"". This beer is a nice gateway drug for introducing people to hoppy beers, not off-putting like some pale ales can be."
"Pours a cloudy cold with a thin white head. Very floral aroma, but also with some fruit and honey in there as well. Bitter taste nicely rounded out with some malty sweetness. Finish is very dry. There's some yeast in the taste, too, with a very evenly carbonated mouthfeel. There's something a little off in the flavor, though; something just tastes a bit stale in it. Not bad, but I feel like there's better offerings in the style comparable prices."
"For a pale ale, this poured slightly cloudy. The head retention was also quite minimal, but at least stayed to a centimeter. The smell was awesome, though: a bouquet of hops and citrus. The taste was good too, beginning with a slightly bitter hoppy taste, followed by a sweet malty middle, leaving a slightly alcoholic and mildly hoppy finish. I will probably drink another in the future, but probably not until it starts to warm up around here."
"This is a straw colored, slightly cloudy beer with a decent white head that disapates quick buts leaves lots of lacing. There is not much of a smell, just a slightly metallic hoppiness. It has a very nice hoppy flavor with very little sweetness. The mouthfeel is pretty good. It is a very refreshing and easy to drink beer."
"Great beer. Perfect, crisp carbonation makes for a great session ale, too."
"This is a remarkably clean yet wonderful session ale that would also fit into the IPA category IMHO. The freshness and bitterness of the hops dominates this beer from start to finish without being overdone. I buy this whenever I'm in Ontario... Québec will not import this beer."
"So seek it out on tap. And, if you buy it in a bottle from a source that you don't know well, you're rolling the dice. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing . . . ."
"Pours to orange color and white head with a little lacing. Aroma is mostly malty. Flavor is a nice balance of malty sweetness and intense bitterness. Very easy to drink. Nothing spectacular, but a good choice if you like pale ales. Makes a good substitute for Boulevard Pale Ale."
"Terrific appearance. Golden brown color with a nice head and great lacing on the glass all the way down. What an ale should look like! Nice hop bitterness that hides the malts. Nice taste as well, slight hop floralness aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good but could use a little less carbonation in my opinion. Goes down easy and would make an excellent session beer."
"About time I saw this one around here, Ive been waiting for it forever. I poured it out of its uniquely shaped anchor bottle into a standard pint glass. The body is perfectly translucent, a little paler than a lot of the other APAs Ive seen and visually nearly devoid of carbonation bubbles. The head is aggressive and eggshell colored, I couldnt even pour the whole twelve ounce at once, when I finally get it poured it gives that domed ice cream float appearance that I so love. Bright white lacing literally sheets down the sides of the pint. This is definitely a great smelling APA, all the right piney and citrus notes on the nose backed by a candy sweet, bubble-gum/cotton candy malt smell with a little pepperiness hanging behind it. The flavor bears witness to the nose, up front is packed with candy sweet malt, which slowly lets the dense, flat bitterness come through, and then the citrus flavors of the hopswithout ever truly letting go of its foothold. The mouthfeel is softly carbonated and lightly slick. From what Id heard of this brew I was expecting hop-tea, but really it is more of a barleywine-lite, much more well-balanced than what I had expected and the malt flavor is superb (dont forget the hops, they were great too!)."
"Definitely recommended and may be a good one to convert a non-BA."
"This beer is exceptionally smooth. The flavor is bold and round - pulling together a good mix of hops and barley. Although it is very hoppy, it has more to offer than bitter in its taste. There is a richness when drinking it that I sense when eating thick desserts."
"After passing this up on the shelf to many times to remember I finally decided to give it a shot. Body is a golden orange with a tall white head that almost overflowed. Great lace and head retention while I drank this. Aroma was heavily citric with a touch of floral and sweet malt. Taste was more citric hops, with a good backing of caramel malt. Very refreshing clean and crisp flavor. While the taste is lighter than others it still is quite flavorful and pleasing. Body is light to medium with definitely boosts the drinkability and doesnt really hurt it any. This stuff couldnt be more drinkable in my opinion. I am glad I finally picked this up. I will definitely be revisting this on in the future."
"Drinkability- Happy I finally tried this one. Have been an Anchor Steam man for a while, but never got around to tying the Liberty. Guess I'll hit the porter sometime soon. My second straight Anchor style 4's across the board review."
"This is a very good pale ale. It is a light orange color and has a creamy white head that leaves tons of lace on my glass. It has a nice citrusy aroma and a ton of malt in the nose too. The flavor is very crisp and the floral hoppiness is nice and sharp, but does not linger long in the aftertaste. A very drinkable pale ale from a world class brewer."
"Drinkability - an all-season pick. Enjoy in good health and freedom."
"Final Though: After the first taste I was a bit skeptical, but then this beer became a classic."
"Election 2004 with a Liberty. I've waited awhile to finally try this one and I'm wondering why. Pours with a 1 finger creamy white head atop a pale orange body. Smell is predominately malty which surprised me for an APA. A little bit of piney (i'm not getting much citrus) hops poking through. Taste is extremely well balanced with a small hop kick giving way towards a huge wall of caramel malt before backing into a hoppy aftertaste. Nice experience. A very solid beer from Anchor Steam. I'm sure that this bottle isn't very fresh and it'd be nice to try this new to see the changes in the hop profile, but as is, it's very enjoyable."
"Comments - Great all around pale ale, which also could make for a great introduction to the world of craft brew."
"Sweet Lady Liberty. I must have a bad batch of this fine ale. The last time I drank it the hops were far more bitter and noticable. This time they are merely adquate. In fact, it tastes a bit watered down. I suppose this sat on the shelves for a while. Oh well, it still looks and smells Absolutey Beautiful. This great cloudy golden orange color. I'll try this again soon."
"Pours a golden color with a thick creamy white head. Has a pleasing citrusy smell. Tastes of citrus with a hint of malty sweetness. Leaves a slight hoppy bitterness on the finish with an increasingly, pleasantly bitter aftertaste. Very carbonated. A very good beer, an American classic."
"this is one of the beers that started me on the road to like ale a little bit more"
"God bless friends from home. Anyways, Liberty ale pours with a beautiful head. Starts out huge, with at least four fingers. Disipates to a little less than two fingers, but still hovers like a thick, beautiful cloud. Bit of an orangy-gold colour, with a hazed chill. Lace lightly sticks to the glass. Light fruits, raw honey, honeycomb and biscuit malts, grassiness, yeast, hops and even a bit of sprig mint on the nose. Taste starts out biscuity sweet, with malts and honeycomb. Then it changes to an earthy, flower and grass taste. Aftertaste is bitter fresh. Grass and bitter hops, with a bit of sprig mint that's a bit off. Reminds me of a menthol cigarette. Had to take a half point for that. Finishes dry and raw. Definitely could tell this were dry hopped. I couldn't drink alot of this at one time, but I could still enjoy this occasionally. Glad I got this."
"Overall, I like this one a bit less than Steam, but this is still a darn good beer."
"Clear orange gold with a puffy white laundry-suds head, definite rich piney smell. Flowery hoppy flavor with a small amount of sugary (not malty) sweetness, really light mouthfeel with a bit of a puckery, citrusy finish. This is a clean and really refreshing beer, despite the hoppy flavor it is really quite mild, enough that you could easily rack off a six pack of these at a summer BBQ or a winter poker party. A bit gassy bit that makes the hops stand out even more."
"Magnificent beer from Anchor. I have always liked the Steam and never tried this one. I like this beer better."
"This is the standard bearer of American Pale Ale. The most striking part of this beer is the aroma. Put your nose in a glass of Liberty and enjoy. Anchor Liberty is still a beer to be revered."
"Pours a five-fingered white head that fades slowly leaving a ton of lace. Clear, light amber color. Hoppy nose. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts as a mix of sweetness and hops but then the hops really assert and finish is hoppy with lingering bitterness. A very good pale but not for my tastes. $2.25 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, Ma."
"nice session beer"
"This beer's my 4th of July staple. Pours a semi-clouded light copper color with a short off-white head. Cascadey, piney nose, with some tea-like caramel malt aromas, too. Nice and hoppy without being overly aggressive. A sweetened tea-like maltiness rounds out a good orangey hop presence. One of the better APAs this fine country has to offer. Highly drinkable. A classic APA."
"Excellent mouthfeel and medium body."
"Pours a red / bronze hue with a massive tan colored head. Has a mild but fresh floral smell. Taste is caramel, vanilla sweet with a mildly bitter citrus flavor lingering in the background. Medium bodied with a very smooth , creamy mouthfeel. Highly drinkable for the glass was empty before I could savor the last bottle of this six pack from y2k. Should've done a vertical tasting with a "" fresh "" Liberty."
"Pours a strong gold color, with great carbonation and great pure white, lacy head. Smell is hoppy and fresh, but not crisp like a pilsner. Taste is excellent, with a well balanced and full bodied hoppy flavor and a subtle, malty taste. Doesnt taste like other pale ales, but still excellent. A smooth mouthfeel. This beer is excessively drinkable, an excellent and a classic beer."
"If i was designing a book of beer swatches, this would be my entry for the American Pale Ale. Are there better ones? Yes. Are there worse ones? Of course. But there is no APA that is more architypical than the Liberty Ale. It is pretty hoppy, as should be expected from a Pale Ale, but not too much. In the same vein, the bitterness and sweetness are also very moderate. There is a subtle fruitiness to it, but nothing too strong. A good beer for picky people. There's something for it in everyone, but at the same time, it isn't blazing new trails."
"Sure, there are hoppier and more bitter beers out there now, but Liberty Ale is still a damn fine beer."
"like anchor's other products I've tried."
"Very drinkable and an excellent 6.0% ABV session beer for a night. I like everything I've ever had from Anchor. The Liberty Ale is no exception."
"Mouthfeel was smooth but carried a slight tinge on the toungue but very drinkable."
"That being said, this is not a hot day, suck back a 6 pack by the pool under the sun type of brew. A great choice for those nights when you really do want ""just one beer"""
"This isn't exactly a beer I would go out of my way to buy, but with the poor selection here in Mississippi, this is a beer I am very glad I am able to find."
"This is a classic american ale, refreshing, well hopped, fruity and easy drinking. A great beer! Gonna head out and get some more. It's a good thing the bottle is 650 mL because a regular pint is just not enough."
"Most amazing? Usually when I sample a ""guest"" beer at a microbrew, it lacks the freshness element of beers brewed on premises. Not this beer. It was just as fresh as others probably because of the extra life the hops instill in this ale. Outstanding beer from Anchor."
"A nice representative of the style. Not as complex as Anchor Steam, but good. Seems appropriate for light dishes like fish and poultry, particularly on warmer days."
"Drinkability: Ah, the lightness of this beer makes it immensely drinkable. A great session pale ale, this is an interesting take on a popular style. Worth trying and enjoying."
"The head is beautiful: very dense and silky, fading slowly. The body is of a hazy orange copper color. The smell is very refreshing:hoppy, with very sweet notes of citrus; the fruitiness is very floral too. I like the smell a lot: sweetly citric without being tart. The taste is enjoyable but shows more citrus and tart than I expected. Floral notes of honey, hints of pine, and a whole bouquet of citrus: some lemon, some orange peel and a full grapefruit aspect, with a pronounced tartness. The mouthfeel is enjoyable; very floral and fruity hops bring a complexity without making the beer overly thick. This beer reminded me a bit of a mojito, probably in the citric and grassy/minty aspect. I like the floral hoppiness a lot, but I don't like the excessive aspect that much. A very hoppy beer, similar to some hoppy Belgian ales, enjoyable, refreshing. A good beer."
"Bottle5 weeks from bottling date. Poured a vibrant orange with a rocky 2 finger cap that takes a while to reduce to a 1cm surface cap that stays. Medium effervescence. Wonderful nose...pungent floral-fruity aroma (grapefruit) mingles with a solid peach-bubblegum sweetness...one of the best smelling crafts out there. Starts big with gravelly mouth feel that mellows to a sandy hop wallop (still not too over powering of the ample malt body)...flavors of peach, pear, lemon grasscomplex, controlled astringency with solid underlying malt spinefinish is a slowly bittering affair as the malt drops away completely and the complex hopping leaves a dozen different impressions on the tonguelike 4 or 5 different metals wadda ale! This is the one that set the pace for complex hop pronounced alesa pioneer that took the risk for people like Rogue et al to follow. A well crafted American micro that will stand the test of time."
"A great beer of the fall back variety. I much prefer this to Cali's other mainstream Pale Ale."
"came in a cool looking 650 ml bottle. poured a light orange color with copious spectacular looking bubbles. Best carbonation Ive ever seen (aside from unibroue beers). It has a massive dense foamy head with endless retention and chunky lace. The aroma is of perfumey and floral hops. The taste is very complex but definitely dominated by hops; grapefruit, lemon, earthy, woody, and grassy hops. Very enjoyable, one of my favourite beers."
"650mL bottle, 5.9% ABV listed, bottled March 9, 2004 (production code 4MI)."
"Hands down, a fantastic beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is good, but its not a sessionable beer. All together, a very tasty american pale ale."
"everything is good about this beer. but nothing great. that's what makes it so good."
"Let me preface my review by saying that I haven't quite gotten into really hoppy beers yet. I'm still pretty much a newbie and a hoppy beer like Liberty Ale is new to me. Still, I did like Liberty Ale quite a lot. I didn't smell to much other than hops, but the appearance is an excellent orange copper with a think head. My first couple of sips of Liberty Ale seemed too bitter, but I quickly settled in and began to enjoy. Beneath the hops I tasted a little citrus and perhaps some spice. Liberty Ale is fairly drinkable, but a little to filling for a long session and maybe a little too hoppy for a newbie such as myself."
"d"
"The most direct comparison has got to be Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Given that they're both in bottles, I'd prefer one of these."
"A great ale, lovely aromatic hoppy flavour"
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. I was not that crazy about this stuff. I think it is because that liberty ale is not as sweet as some of the other pale ales I have tried. It's like eating a grapefruit with no sugar. It's not becuase I have an aversion against hops, I don't; I love hops. A little too coarse for my liking. This just wasn't my cup of tea, or pint glass of beer."
"Picked up a 6 pack on sale at AJ's recently. Poured a beautiful frothy head that is maintaining quite well down my pint. Nice golden color to this brew. Smells a tad bit bready. Taste is very good, finishing with a nicely balanced dry hop finish. This brew is a tad more suttler than the big hopped beers I am fond of but very agreeable with my palate. The mouthfeel is quite full for a pale, very interesting. Overall frinkability is very good. I am liking it better the 2nd time around, nice brew!"
"This is, plain and simple, a great beer. Drinkable without being insipid, Liberty was -- along with Sierra Nevada Pale Ale -- an early example of the American pale ale that many breweries have subsequently tried to duplicate or improve on. The fact that this beer hasn't been crowded from the shelf on the beer aisle shows that few have succeeded in even coming close. Anchor should release two companion ales to Liberty called Life and The Pursuit of Happiness because this sh*t is awesome."
"I always get at least a 6-pack when I find it."
"That must be 250 words."
"Very drinkable indeed..this is still a nice ale..but in 1975 this must have been a revelation..the first blast of the trumpets for the macro revolution."
"its very drinkable but I will probably not buy this one again"
"Ah, Liberty Ale. Poured out a golden color with a decent amount of carbonation in this beer. Left a lot of lacing around the pint glass as well. Smell consisted of various things. Hops are detected, along with some floral aroma and some lemon. Quite nice. Taste was all hops basically. Starts out light in the beginning but gets strong towards the middle and end. In the middle it blends in with some citric flavors along with some herbal plants. Almost minty I might add. Quite smooth. Just the right amount of carbonation also. I like what they did with this beer. They're not trying to go crazy with a pale ale, but on the other hand they made a very decent ale with all the items that should be in a pale ale. Damn good beer."
"It's better when I stop paying attention, and let the offtastes fade away, so I can enjoy the quiet toasty malt."
"Foamy head forms and recedes, leaving virtually no lace and a clear, coppery color. Hops and a piney scent are evident. The hops stake a claim, but do not exclaim, just enough to be pronounced over the malt. Tickly carbonation with the balanced palate create a nice feel in the mouth. Finishes with a quick, slightly bitter aftertaste, and cleanly. Not overly impressed, as it doesn't do anything to stand out, but a good session beer."
"Pours a copper/orange cloudy liquid with a white foamy head. The head did not stay around long. There was no lacing on the glass as this beer disappeared. Smells somewhat floral, grassy and herbal. Taste is slightly sweet with a touch of flowery hops, and a slight orange peel taste. Seemed to be a higher level of carbonation, as this seemed a bit fizzy to me. The hops are not overwhelming, but make their presence known. Medium body. I find this to be drinkable. I would have another (and did). This is a classic American Pale Ale. I often revisit this beer when I want hops, but want a bit more balance. Good session beer."
"I feel like I am a better man just for drinking this beer. I have heard nothing but good things and now I know that everything is true. I love the taste. Fruity and sweet. Citrus with grapefruit and lemon. Caramel malts make it even better. It goes down so smooth that I couldn't drink enough of it. Great beer."
"Nice yellow beer with a decent white head that leaves a nice lace. Hops, grain, yeast nose. Taste is a fine balance of hops and citrus(mainly grapefruit). High carbonation gives this beer a high refresher score. Very fresh tasting with a nice medium mouthfeel."
"Definitely a very good ale that I could drink several of and will definitely keep a couple of around."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a solid malty scent with hops sneaking in behind it. The taste is good. I has a creamy malt palate with mild flavor hops. It goes down easy and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a real good drinker; a fine brew for any day."
"Overall, a refreshing yet complex and very flavorful beer."
"Poured a slightly hazy light amber with a smallish soft white head. Smell was not much... some hints of floral hops. To me, the taste was strong on hop bitterness... but somewhat lacking in hop flavor. Mouthfeel was average, unremarkable. Frankly, I was somewhat disappointed in this. I always look forward to tasting beers rated in the 4's, but I thought this was more deserving of mid-3 status!"
"pours a very slightly hazey golden sunset with a tight cropped creamy head thats leaves an amazing lace. nice! right off the bat you notice the hop aroma, piney and mouth watering...also a nice dose of grain and malt show up. first off, this beer is smooth. damn smooth. in the mouth it shows a healthy lightly sweet malt body (honey) matched up against a nice dose of citrus/pine like hops. great match. one of the most balanced beer ive encountered. semi sweet, lightly bitter, a touch grainy...just raw. in a good way. like ""damn now this is a real beer"". creamy in the mouth and finishes with a dry little bite. this is a winner, a masterpiece and session brew all the way."
"Pale clear golden color with a frothy white head fed by lively streamers of carbonation. The head is fairly short lived, and the beer fizzes out leaving a film of soapy bubbles on the surface. Floral hop aroma with a hint of spice and grassiness, bready malt is also apparent on the nose. Taste is dominantly bright grainy malt with only a touch of earthy hop bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel with apparent esters and a butterscotch like aftertaste. The body is much too delicate to hide the alcohol content, and as a result the beer ends up being a bit one dimensional."
"Beef Notes: Many BA's love this beer. I don't understand. Are they drinking the same thing that I just had? With all the great pale ales out there, this one fails to climb out of mediocrity."
"."
"Anchor Liberty Ale doesn't appear to have any weak spots. There's no question that it's one of the better pale ales that I've had yet. Best of all, since it's readily available at my local grocery, I'll be coming back to it fairly often."
"I really enjoyed this beer and could drink it all the time."
"Over all this is a fantastic brew that I can enjoy through out the year, a fantastic pale!"
"Really drinkable, this is a very well balanced beer. Much better than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale."
"gds"
"Overall- a delicious beer that gives Sierra Nevada Pale Ala a run for their money."
"ng"
"All in all, a pretty nice brew. The hops weren't quite as assertive as I was anticipating but Liberty Ale could make for a nice session brew and summer refresher."
"Pale orange-yellow with a small white head that fades quickly, Liberty has a soft, pleasant, slightly hoppy aroma. The mouthfeel is full, turning a bit watery at the end. he taste is non-descript, though you can discern both malt and hops -- just more of a whimper than a shout. It's a good, easy drinking pale. It would make a nice session beer."
"im not a huge fan of pale ales, but this is a problably the best ive had. by the time i was 2 or 3 deep i started to enjoy the taste much more...the more i drink it, the more i like it."
"Had this on tap at Redbones. Pour when served was a clear golden, clean aroma, no head. I found the taste rather biscuity, and not very hoppy at all. This was a pleasant beer that is easy to drink and a good solid craft beer. At that abv, almost a session beer."
"I would like to hoist one of these at a 4th of July BBQ, but I would drink this anyday of the year. A very thirst-quenching brew. I could easily go from sipping and appreciating this one to pounding down a six pack of this. A good APA from Fritz and Co."
"Finally shelled out the money for another sixer of this. Pours a beautiful orangish gold color with a light and fluffy white head. Ample carbonation to keep it up for a bit. Some lacing. Smells hoppy. Citrusy grassy hoppiness and happiness. Wow, I love this beer. Nice citrusy hops right up front, ahh, but hops is not all there is to this beer, oh no. Underneath that wonderful bit comes a nice rounded bisquity sweet malt. Mmmm. Decent maltiness hangs around for a while. Crisp clean mouthfeel. Highly drinkable as far as the beer by itself goes, however, due to cost, not as drinkable as say a Sam Adams or Bully! Porter. Still, if it wasn't 8.50 a sixer and Sammy wasn't a mere 5, this would be my everyday beer. It's yummy. I'm sorry but almost 200 dollars a year means I drink Sams most of the time. Still, a wonderful beer and worth the purchase a few times a year."
"Nicely rounded and balanced, a pleasure to drink."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Pours a light amber color with a thin head. Marvalous fresh hop aromapeppery, floral, west-coast aromaspine-like. The taste always seems surprisingly malty. Nice, tip-of-the-tongue sweetness. Moderate to full-body. Finish is refreshingly bitter and biting. This is a great session brew.Ive always been impressed with this one, and found it to be one of the best beers from Anchor."
"An excellent palate cleanser here, and an excellent ale. Pours a nice, clear, honey amber color with a moderate ecru head that lasts several minutes and never really disappears, except for some sheet lacing it leaves behind. Floral, pine, and lemony citrus dominate the nose. Mouthfeel seems on the thick side and has a touch of pleasant, hop bite. Taste is toffee/lemon in the beginning. Caramel/toffee flavor holds on toward the finish, but the lemon and pine of those American westcoast hops constantly hold your attention. Has a dry and hoppy finish and aftertaste. Very well balanced overall, and has a nicely assertive taste that would make this a fine session ale."
"The mouthfeel was smooth. A slight dryness was detected after swallowing. The bitterness lingered on the tongue for a few seconds along with a mellow caramel flavor. This beer is extremely drinkable and makes a great session beer."
"Pours a lovely allmond brown, average head with some retention, clean and smooth malt profile, bready with hints of oatmeal and biscuits. Vibrant and citrusy hops. Grapefruit. Smooth & velvety on the tongue. Goes great with salads, nuts and cheese. All around great ale."
"Medium bodied with a rich, full and creamy mouthfeel. Fizzy carbonation that hurts the drinkability. Haven't had this one in years...silly me! Good solid ale."
"Drinkability--Delicious and refreshing, the heaviness would work well with spicier foods. I believe this would be an excellent choice with lamb."
"I had no idea what this brew was like. I grabbed it and tried it with no preconceived notions. I was pleasantly surprised. An excellent pale ale."
"Mouthfeel was good with light to medium carbonation. Light bodied."
"While I have many new friends behind the bar now, it's always great to run in to the one that turned me on first..."
"This was a little bit hoppy for me, but good none the less. It was a cloudy straw color with a foamy white head. The head was pretty thick and lasted a short while. Pretty good head retention overall. The smell was kind of like an old boat with hops. I don't know where that came from, but that was the first thing I thought of. The taste was very similar, but had hints of citrus type fruits. All in all a good beer, especially if you like the hoppy type beers."
"This is a great beer. Pours a nice amberish color and a good head that slowly dissapates. The smell strong and of a bouquet of flowers very pleasant. The taste is very well balanced between hop bitterness and maltiness with a crisp aftertaste. I really The mouthfeel was just right for this style of beer. I really enjoyed this one. Wish I could find it in Utah."
"Dark amber color with a nice frothy head that lingers fairly well. Noticably hoppy aroma. Excellent taste marked by strong hops and smooth malt. Bitterness lingers on tongue long after swallowing. I really like this beer. Somewhat akin to Sam Adams Boston Lager in the hoppiness, though not as malty in my opinion. Could be the ale vs. lager as well. Overall an excellent offering that I would happily drink again and again."
"Dark amber appearance with a nice smooth frothy head. Mild malty aroma, very earthy smell but with a sweet balance. Soft malty taste on the pallet with a long bitter hop finish. Slightly sweet with that same earthiness as in the smell. Fantastic balance of malt and hops. I used to think this was a good session beer, yet now, like Anchor Steam, I find it very filling, like a meal in a glass."
"Drinkability: again, bitterness out of balance"
"This is the tablewine of ales. Not spectacular in any way, but good enough across the board to drink day in and day out."
"I bought a six pack of this for $7.99. After trying it I think I overpayed. Not sure why but all Anchor beer in my area (NJ) is expensive. Maybe because it's from CA. Anyway, I did like the appearance of the bottle. Poured a golden brown with minimal lacing on the glass. Looked decent. Very hoppy IMO, more bitter than other ales. I enjoyed it, but I would rather have one of my local brews."
"Taste is a nicely balanced mix of mild, sweet malts and crisp citrusy hops. Really nice taste here - probably the best tasting American pale ale I've had. Mouthfeel is just what I'd expect for the style. Very drinkable. I wish there was somewhere in this area that had this - or any other Anchor product - on tap."
"This brew pourred a hazy light brown brew witn a nice foamy head with good retention. Nice aroma a strong hoppy taste (could it barley?). Complex mix of spice. Definitely one of the best american pale ale and looking forward to other Anchor products."
"Excellent example of american micro. Had my first one this week. (why'd I wait so long?). pours a light-straw color with a low effervescence and minimal head. Nose is hoppy, but not over-powering, a little citrus and slightly piney. The taste is lovely, hits the perfect range of bitter for a beer that has distinctive character while still drinkable in quantity. Refreshing and uplifting. If you like Liberty Ale and you live in Fla, try Dunnedin's Piper's Pale Ale, it is remarkably similar."
"Bitter and dry to drink with a citrus finish like oranges. Tasty but doesn't blow me away."
"(PS: in this review whatever unsappy, man-ridden facades I might chose have long lost out)"
"s worst perfume."
"hazy orange gold color with a medium white head. very floral malt aroma, with a little grassy hops. it has a sweet floral citrusy taste with a well balanced hop bitterness. a medium mouthfeel with a decent amount of carbonation, goes down real easy. this is very good beer, if people say this doesn't travel well, then this must be damn impressive at the brewery."
"A classic west-coast pale ale: a mouth-puckering dryness balancing fruity, biscuity malt. Clean, hoppy and full of character."
"This is one that I have overlooked for some time and as per usual have later grown to regret that. This beer pours a hazy golden apricot with a thick, somewhat ""fizzy", off-white head. Not much lacing going on. Nice sweet citrus and mellow floral hop aroma going on. Taste has the same mellow hops balanced perfectly on a malt backbone with a crisp finish. I was also tasting some light peach flavors on the sweet end which was enhanced by the hop bitterness and bite. Overall, a very enjoyable and readily available pale ale. I still love my Sierra Nevada Pale Ale though."
"One of my long time favorites. I like to introduce friends to new beers and Liberty is the only one that I can say that everyone has liked. The lighter than ""pale"" color is deceptive for such a flavorful brew. The perfect sweet to bitter transformation sweeps across the tongue and satisfies all the way. It has enough bite for most hopheads but the beautiful balance and the pleasant floral bouquet erases any possible complaints. Even the mother-in-law likes it. The best introduction to the way of the hophead."
"This is a damn good beer. Very drinkable. A first-rate American Pale Ale."
"Ive only had a couple bottles of Liberty Ale before, but I like this brew. Liberty Ale pours with a great frothy head that is about three quarters of an inch high. The color is clear amber-bronze. The head hangs around for a rather long length of time and eventually lowers to a thin lace. The aroma has a slight amount of caramel malt with hops being more predominant  slight citric/grapefruit hints. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. There is a light smooth malt start with just a hint of caramel. The hops are great! Towards mid swallow, the hops come in but dont completely hide all notions of malt. There isnt an overwhelming hop bite that takes over the beer, rather, the hops seem to fade in gently and take over. Hops are fairly citric, somewhat juicy and linger into the dry finish. The aftertaste is also of hops but is restrained with malt becoming slightly evident again. Overall, Liberty is quite well balanced, but definitely leans towards the hops. This is a very drinkable and enjoyable brew that is great for most occasions and worth keeping in the fridge on a regular basis."
"M"
"Appearance is brass/golden with a decent white head. Smells of juniper and crisp lemon peel and hops. Taste is almost gin-like and it tastes like it smells: juniper, lemon peel, enough malts to keep this from being too watery, and citrus hops. I would say this is almost the beer equivalent of a gin-and-tonic. Very refreshing and goes down easy."
"When I first tried Liberty Ale over a year ago I didn't care much for it. My tastes seemed to have changed. This is very good indeed. Liberty Ale would seem to be a great beer to pair with food. This is a solid American Pale Ale."
" It has a golden copper color and pours a good head; off white or tan. Decent lacing. It has a nice floral hoppy smell. Excellent, The taste follows the nose. Floral, malty, citrus. Good mouthfeel. I'd say medium bodied. Very drinkable, In fact I just ran out and I'm feelin a little down. Overall a great Pale Ale."
"Drinkability: This has got to be one of the best pale ales I've ever had. I had forgotten how truly great some of Anchor's products are as it had been awhile. This will definitely become a staple in my fridge."
"Medium peach in color, with a large white head that slowly recedes to leave small amounts of lacing. Aroma is mainly dominated with cascade hops (pine needle & some citrus) with some bready maltiness and a bit of yeatiness hanging out. Taste is of piney hops, some sweet citrus, and hints of breadiness. Body is medium, flavor is very well balanced, and immensley drinkable."
"A nice copper color., pours with a solid cream colored head. A definite citrusy aroma wafts from the glass to my nose. There is a good amount of body to this beer, and it goes along well with a nice American hop (Cascade) character, in both the aroma and flavor departments. This beer finishes with a nice pleasing bitterness that hits ones tongue. At its best this beer is overflowing with American hop character, a wonderful hop-citrus character. Backed by a solid amount of malt backbone that helps this pioneering beer stand tall. Unfortunately this beer does not travel well. Anywhere I have had this beer a significant distance from the brewery, it is merely a solid good above average beer. When it is fresh though it is world class. So all of you Liberty naysayers get thee to the brewery to really experience this beer."
"This beer is pretty unique. I'm not sure what it is, but I think it might have something to do with the strain of yeast employed. An interesting blend of flavors, fairly hoppy, but with those interesting yeast notes. A very smooth beer overall that I thoroughly enjoy."
"Drinkability: Goes down very easily."
"There's no ifs ands or buts about it...this is a fantastic pale ale....like drinking freshly squeezed hop juice...but at the same time not hugely bitter....very very tasty..."
"Very nice mouthfeel, strong body yet goes through well as a thirst quencher with a medium body. This is a premium beer worth having many times (with moderation of course not all at once.)"
"IMHO: A well-balanced Pale Ale with more character than most  not over hopped and pleasantly complex."
"An excellent beer from a true american original. Accept no imitations."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a hazy orange color, with a moderate head that quickly receded to a smallish ring, leaving some lacing behind. Aroma is floral and citrus from the hops! Very nice. Taste is slightly malty, witha good hop balance and with moderate carbonation, this is a very drinkable beer! Very enjoyable."
"This stuff tastes and feels pretty good going down, and it has a nice sweetness that makes it a pleasure to drink without being soda pop. Can't fault the carbonation either, especially after it has wamred a little bit. This is definetly a nice beer to relax with, and drink without thinking about drinking."
"This brew, I was told, is a classic, the prototype for the so-called west coast IPA's, and from what I can tell it is an apt description. It pours a light amber with a modest off-white head that recedes quickly. The smell is, of course, hoppy, but not nearly as bold as some of its west coast descendants. The taste is light and hoppy--not much in the way of complexity, but extremely drinkable, especially listening to a Thelonius Monk CD on a late summer vacation evening."
"I've enjoyed the other Anchor offerings that I've had, and this is no exception. A good, solid, West Coast pale ale."
"Comments  The Liberty Ale is less authoritative in its flavors than the Small Beer."
"Notes: Very drinkable. Good beer for those seeking a beginner beer down the hoppy road."
"Pours a deep golden/amber color with a nice fruffy head,the aroma is somewhat dry and hoppy with some slight sweetness in the background.The flavor is zesty and citruis-like with a malty sweet lingering backbone but the hop profile is the main taste I got from this brew.A pretty darn good ale even better if your a hophead."
"For the BJCP style American Pale Ale, this is in the 4.3 / 5 mark - more hop aroma would help."
"I was literally stunned at how much I enjoyed drinking this beer. I did not have overly big expectations. But every mouthful was a treat. For a pale ale to give this much satisfaction to the drinker says a lot. It's not an ""extreme"" beer, it's not over the top, it does not hit you over the head with heavy flavors. What it is however is a perfectly balanced ale with class and style."
"Rerate: 24 May 2003. This beer is HUGELY different on draught versus in the bottle. The previous rating is for the bottle. I had it on draught today, it has a nice hoppy nose, w/ a flavor that started out creamy & finished hoppy. My rating reflects my original 'bottle' tasting b/c that's more widely available. However, if you can get it on draught, it's far superior... This is a *nice* IPA but nothing compared to the other IPA's available in California. It's readily available, so that's a plus."
"This beer couldn't appear any better for it's style. Beautiful medium sized white creamy head. A golden amber color. Slight carbonation. The aroma seemed a little withdrawn for the actual flavor but was still quite nice. There were a lot of different hop flavors I noticed in this one. Citrus hops being the main flavor. Floral hops were also there along with some bittering hops. A grainy malt flavor was there to keep the hops in place but it didn't really ever stand out. Just kind of a backdrop for the beer. Finishes with a yeasty, grainy dryness mixed with some floral hops. Superb beer!"
"This beer had a medium sized white creamy head with fine-small sized bubbles that was long lasting.The body was cloudy and there was no carbonation observed.The lacing was very good on the sides of my glass.The nose was hoppy and also fruity. The mouthfeel was bitter and smooth.The flavor of this beer was bitter from start to finish."
"Appearance a well carbonated light gold with a nice lace down the glass. Smell was a nice citrusy aroma. Taste was a a nice hoppy tang followed by a nice full mouthfeel, with just enough aftertaste. A nice drinkable brew, very good for this category."
"Pours a light amber color, with a very florally fragrant white head. The beer is very aromatic, lots of floral, and hop smell to it, with a very slight fruity smell. With the first taste the hops come rushing to the tongue and follow up with a very crisp and pleasing aftertaste. There was a lot of time and craftsmanship put into this beer, and you can tell. It is very smooth and easy to drink, hoppy but well balanced, a good session beer"
"For me, the definition of ""go-to beer."" Cascade goodness!"
"I first had this beer four years ago and since then it has always been one of my favorites. Pours a clear orange/light amber with a nice white frothy head. The smell is inviting, of floral aromas and of hops. Very pleasant smelling and rather strong--the aroma can be detected without even lifting the glass. Taste is spicy and hoppy, with a dry finish. Outstanding flavor. The taste is dominated by hops yet not in an overpowering way. Feels surprisingly light, and this combined with its great taste and aroma, makes for a highly drinkable beer."
"Some grainy pale malts provide a good foundation for this brew. Grassy hops take it from there to bitter a bit. It is well-balanced. Carbonation is light and the body is medium, very smooth. It is definitely a decent drinker as long as you are not anti-hops."
"This beer pours an orange color with a moderate head and not much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very soft and hard to detect, but it smells slightly of citrus. The flavor is fairly smooth and very malty and filled with citrus. It has somewhat dry of an aftertaste. Overall this is a good beer but just slighty more dry than I would prefer."
"Medium gold color, large head. Medium bodied ale. Moderately malty and fairly aggressively hopped. Good balance. Taste is smooth and clean. Nice flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Nice beer, light and refreshing."
"Pours quite beautifully qith a clear golden color with a nice well retained head. Very nice hop character with a mostly citrusy taste and aroma. It's very drinkable, it wasn't long before I was ready for my next bottle. Not much as far a mouthfeel, but the hoppy flavor is enough to satisfy me. Great beer for football games and picnics."
"Flavor is citrus and grass hop bitterness towards the front with a biscuit malt that is quickly surmounted by a crystal malt and a bubblegum note shortly before a final hop blast to finish."
"A great drinking experience. This is something i would buy again, and highly recommend."
"I had this brew in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. The color is a light orange and there is a good 2 fingers of head. There is just a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly sweet, with just a small hop aroma. The taste has a good balance of honey and fruit with cascade hops. If you love cascade hops, you'll love this beer! The mouthfeel is just a tad on the light side. This is a very drinkable brew, and is great for relaxing."
"Nice deep amber color with small head even with a heavy pour. Lacing is minimal but consistent to the finish. This is a nice rich IPA and seems a little heavier than others. Cascade hops obvious from the get-go and a great malt/hop balance. I found this full bodied for it's style."
"Outstanding ale. Pours a hazy amber with a huge gold-hued tan head that retains decently and leaves small deposits of lace. Lovely aroma lets you know you're in for some nicely hopped malt brew. The flavor is exquisitely crafted; plenty of hops, but not overpowering. Lots of malt balanced by the great hops which tended to the citrusy. Great body and superb mouthfeel make this a very drinkable beer. Well done Anchor!"
"The big, cream-colored head is noisy. The lacing is clumpy. The color is a clear amber-gold. A sweet caramel nose shows promise of hops. The front is caramel with a little tobacco. There's a touch of fruit in the malty middle leading to a delicious, hoppy, grainy finish. Hm. Bottle's empty. Next time I'll get the big bottle."
"One of my first lighter ales since I began my beer tasting venture it poured out with a nice white frothy head, some lace, and golden color. A very drinkable beer. Nice mouthfeel for a lighter ale than I have been used to drinking (all stouts). Floral aftertaste from a fairly well balanced brew that gives a slight edge toward the hops."
"A pretty big head sits atop this deep golden colored brew. What hits the tounge is a nice, pretty hoppy bitter flavor. A damn good american style pale ale. This beer has a good hand in getting me into the nicer beer selections. A pretty nice standard american PA"
"This is a very good beer, could be better with out the slightly sour taste. Good beer from a great brewery."
"Pale golden color, bright white head that disappears too quickly. Very light aroma, so light that I can't really detect any discernable smells. It feels highly carbonated, which maybe contributes to the weak flavor across the tongue. There is a slight hop flavor, but no malt or other accents that come to mind. This one didn't really do it for me."
"This is a wonderful, refreshing beer, and a great beer for summer. It will be a staple in my refrigerator."
"Nice orange amber with a big white head. I had to get this one topped off. Nice tastey hop flavors. Not a huge bitter, but enough to make a hophead smile. Smooth. A bit of a fruity flavor in there with the grainy flavors. Good balance. A good pale ale, almost an IPA."
"A light reddish-orange with a moderate head. Smells very fresh, crisp, and a little spicy. Tastes very clean and refreshing. A little malty. Feels great in the mouth -- very complex, not too much of anything nor too little of anything. For me, the best thing about this beer is it drinkability. It is fantastic. I finish one and immediately want another."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow-orange with a moderate white rocky head. The mouthfeel is rounded and moderate. The smell is cereal and grain with an underlying citrus. The taste is citrusy hops balanced by an underlying maltiness. This is a smooth pleasing pale ale with a lingering bitter finish."
"It poured with a substantial head, but the retention was rather low. The dark gold color made for a nice appearance. The hopping and maltiness were apparent in the aroma, though both rather low... As for the taste, there was a definite maltiness- more maltiness than I'm used to in a pale ale/bitter, but it was balanced perfectly by the hops. However, I would've prefered a more agressive hop taste and aroma. It offered a medium body and good drinkability, making for a well rounded beer. I'll definately purcase it again, though it lacks the complexity necessary to make it one of my favorites."
"Pours to a hazy, copper color, with a thick tan head that leaves excellent lacing. The aroma is spicy, and really fruity, with malt aromas in the back. The flavor is malty, with a spicy, fruity hop flavor. It is a well balance beer. It is medium bodied with a semi-dry finish. It is an easy drinking, well-balanced brew. Very tasty; I would definitely drink this one again."
"Color is a solid golden yellow like honey, recieved a foamy white head about two fingers high with some divets and settled slowly. Smell of this is crazy floral hops, cascade variety with a mix of woodish others, citrus peels of lemon and/or grapefruit, you can tell right away this is gonna be a bitter one. Taste is like someone just peeled a fresh grapefruit, super piney and fresh as hell. Crisp. Tightly bitter, short, leveled, and citrusy stuffed. Slightly sour grapefruit, strong hop bite, pale, and nearly dry as dirt. Feel seems crisp and lighly medium with a clean bite and the malts take a far back, second seat with a slight toasted realm. Drinks down just fine and could easily be quaffed enough until it becomes almost normal to the buds."
"This is yet another exceptional beer from the Anchor brewery. Pours a clear amber/copper color with a medium sized rocky head that retains itself for the duration, leaving a light lace on the glass. The aroma is full of cascade hops, citrus peel, and just a hint of raisins. Taste is extremely hoppy intermixed with some citrus flavor, possibly grapefruit. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. This is definitely a great session beer that can be enjoyed any day of the year."
"A classic! It's slightly hazy (bottle-conditioned) golden-amber body is topped by a frothy white head that holds really well and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. Dry-hopped Cascades saturate the nose - perfumey, floral, lemony, and pine-like over some lightly caramel-tinged grainy malt. The hops are 'softer' from the dry-hopping, however, and not as 'sharp' as if they'd been added to the kettle. It's luxurious! The body is medium; and it's lightly crisp and then smooth and creamy in the mouth due in part to a very fine, natural carbonation from bottle conditioning. Cascades carry over into the flavor in a big way; wrapped in sweet, caramelish malt and backed by a firm bitterness. It's very well-rounded and nicely balanced, without the aggressive edge that many beers like this have. Absolutely worth seeking out!"
"The aroma is an almost sweet citrus and sweet malt. Nice lingering bitterness. This beer is light and easy to drink. I like it."
"The taste is also admerable. There is a puckering tartness in the first few sips but the sweetness of the malt does not go unnoticed. It is a great drinking beverage. I recomend it."
"Good pale ale, I can see why it's considered a classic. Keep this one handy."
"Anchor Liberty Ale: How it has taken me this long to try this absolutely terrific beer is beyond me. I’ve never been a big fan of Anchor products, but their Liberty Ale is the cat’s pajamas. It is a deep golden color, with an off-white head, with great staying power. The aroma is almost perfect, fruity, perfume, hops, flowers. The taste really shows off the cascade hops, with tremendous smoothness, leaving a very clean dry finish. The mouthfeel is somewhat hop/oils, very pleasant. Damn fine beer."
"Pours an orange haze with a white thick head but quickly thins out. Strong floral hops aroma. Light carbonation with a good mouthfeel. Tastes of floral hops, malt and some citrus fruit specifically orange at least thats what I taste. This beer goes down nice and smooth which is nice to have on a hot summer day while relaxing next to a pool or at the beach."
"A classic American Pale Ale. This one pours out to a slightly hazy dark golden with orange highlights, forming a dense whipped off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate. Aroma is inviting with lots of fresh, floral, spicy hops...nutty and lightly toasted grains, and a mild amount of fruitiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and pillowy soft with a light body. Taste begins interestingly enough, with chewy, toasty malts. Caramunich graininess is noted, but not dominant. The hops come in, loud and aggressive, but never bitter, completely in balance with the malt. There is a corn taste towards the end, but it is rather pleasant, and I think secondary to the fermentation. Alcohol is completely unobtrusive. No off-flavors noted. Belches are pleasantly hoppy with some graininess. The finish is very soft and wet with pleasantly lingering floral hops and sweet malts. Very nice finish. As it warms, I notice some tannic astringency and caramel in the finish. This is a rich and filling beer, not as drinkable as my favorites, but it can stand on it's own as a good session brew."
"A pleasant ale and easy to drink, but nothing out of the ordinary. Pours with a nice white foamy head, but it does not last long. For the wood workers out there, the color is close to orange shellac crystal. A crisp hop and citrus flavor with a mild bitter after taste which is to be expected with this type of ale and remains making you want to take another sip. Definitely worth a taste."
"This brew poured a hazy copper color. The head was white and fluffy and the lacing was decent. It had a good aroma with floral hops jumping out the most. There was also a fairly strong citrus aroma. Sweet malt was barely detectable but it mostly cosisted of hops. Same with the taste, very hoppy. The citrus flavor hit up front followed by a strong hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was a bit sharp at first although it went down fairly smooth. I wasn't expecting to much from this beer but I was pleasantly surprised. This would definitely be a good beer to drink during the hot summer. I will surely drink this one again."
"Pours a nice orange colour and is hazy, not clear. Little head and a pungent acidic smell. Unimpressive taste, sorty of grainy but sweet. The strong aroma hinders the drinkability of this beer."
"Orange body, with smallish head and fine bubbles. Rich bouquet of flowers, tree sap and malt. Amazing long lasting bitterness. Creamy smooth body that has a complexity that leaves me floored (or maybe that was the 6 percent alcohol. I have just found my house ale."
"The Liberty has a very crisp flavor with little aftertaste. There is a noticable bitter, hoppy flavor. I was expecting a larger, more dramatic flavor but the Liberty is a refreshing beer that I can imagine having more of in the future."
"Bountiful head with good lace retention on this slightly cloudy orange brew. Mostly hops with some apricot and peach come through in the smell. The taste reflects the smell, but the fruit flavor is very subtle. The bitterness is very nicely balanced with a bit of sweetness and an adequate level of carbonation to make this a tasty brew. I found this very enjoyable and easy to drink. It tastes almost as if this is the older more sophisticated brother of Magic Hat #9, because it has a much more complex taste, without all the fruitiness. Overall, a very enjoyable American Pale Ale."
"This is just a solid beer, a great Pale Ale. (And though it doesn't count toward the the official review marks, I'm also fond of the bottle, which explains that the name 'Liberty Ale' is in celebration of the ride of Paul Revere.)"
"What else to say....super smooth and creamy mouthfeel....perfectly balanced, hoppy, but not too hoppy. This is a wonderful beer. It's very highly drinkable. I like the large bottle it came in, and I definitely would drink another if I had one. The appearance is nicely and cloudy golden orange. I highly recommend this pale ale for sessions."
"liberty ale pours out a very bright, albeit very cloudy orange-gold color. lots of ""floaties""...an inch thick head reduces to a thin layer with ample lace. aroma of citrusy hops....man does this smell good! the taste surprised me....i was expecting an assault of hops, but what greeted my taste buds was a nicely balanced, full and creamy flavorful brew. a hint of belgian, with lots of toasted and biscuity malts....followed by an understated citrusy hop bitterness. this is the epitome of a restrained but flavorful hopped-up ale. dry hopped for sure, but not obnoxiously so. alcohol undetectable. this is a damn fine brew, lots of complexities without being hit over the head with massive hops. very tasty and highly drinkable."
"Golden amber with a thin head. Very fragrant hoppy, estery aroma. Medium bodied, and crisp, but smooth. Very bitter hoppy tasting with some peach-like hints. Also sweet malt and a touch of honey. This is some good stuff. Something I'll come back to time and time again."
"Cheers"
"I have had this beer before, but it was at least five or six years ago. It isn't a bad beer at all, it's just the flavors are not what I would consider to be those of a typical pale ale. For a good pale, I would rather have a Sierra Nevada or a Boulevard. However, the drinkability is great; it is refreshing and I have polished off the whole bottle while typing this! Like I said, it's good, but don't expect a classic pale ale flavor."
"Aside from the occasional holiday brews, this is the best beer in an all-star line from Anchor Steam. It pours an amber-copper color with an average head. The strong aroma is reminiscent of stone fruit (cherry and peach) and citrus (grapefruit). Liberty Ale provides a middle-of-the-road hops experience, with a nice fruit-caramel balance. Although every brew is technically unique, this one really stands out. Its closest availability is at a liquor store about 40 miles from my home. I don't consider that too far, for Liberty Ale."
"Pours a slightly amber tinted golden, with a light white head that fades to a thin covering layer. Aroma is interesting, hops evident with light perfumes and a good dose of spicy hops. Taste is also quite interesting. Regardless of reputations, this is my first time trying Liberty Ale, and it leaps out to me as exactly what an APA should be. Flowery hops merely flesh out the spicy hop flavours, with quite a bit of sweetness to keep that all in check. Light (in a good way), refreshing, and ever so good. A fabulous beer, and a permanent fixture at the LCBO, so I have a new option for backup for when I can't find anything new."
" Sour, then sweet. I love how a beer can paradox a common idiom"
"Anchor Brewing delivers quite a beer here. A wonderful representation of an American Pale Ale. Pours a amber light copper orangish hue with a full heaping white head. A great amount of fruit aroma that is unbelieveable. Within in the first sip, the sweetness of the malts dominates the flavor, but a great taste of citrus hop flavor fills the senses balancing this beer perfectly to the likings of my taste buds. I will put it like this, this beer is so fine if it were a woman, I would drink it's bathwater. An great classic taste that is amazingly drinkable."
"It is too dry, not well balanced, too oriented to the bitter. The bitterness is very persistent, but annoying."
"After sipping this fine brew, I was surprised not to be belted in the taste buds with overpowering hops. They are there but are very subtle. A very fruity taste also accompanied the hops, almost like a peach aftertaste. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy even. This is a very unique, interesting, and delicious beer. I could drink this all night."
"An A+ offering from Anchor!"
"I""ve always enjoyed this beer. I feel that Liberty Ale is one of the better balanced US version of the style. Pours a nice, deep golden hue. Prominent head, good retention. Nice lace presence. A very noticeable fruity, citrus taste. I've seen Liberty Ale referred to as the ""quintessential micro brew", and I have to agree. This is one of the beers that I buy consistently, but not as often as I used to. Somewhat tame compared to many of it's hoppier counterparts."
"Pours a cloudy golden color. Perfect head, thick, white, creamy, invites you to drink it. Aroma is crisp with plenty of hop and some citrus. Taste is absolutely perfect for a session beer, plenty of hop with a smooth malt balance. The mouthfeel is like silk, this stuff just feels good on your tongue. Exceptional drinkability. I would have no problem making this my house ale. It's a nice session beer in winter and would make a great companion to any summer BBQ."
"Another quality offering from the folks at Anchor. A somewhat cloudy, brownish appearance with a citrusy aroma. The white head eventually gave way to just a slight layer of foam. Very pleasing mouthfeel (due to the carbonation?) as well as a flavor that is crisp and would be well-suited to a spicy meal. I have yet to be disappointed by the Anchor beers I have tried and the Liberty Ale certainly deserves a top 50 ranking. A very balanced beer."
"I had thought this beer would taste like a Strong Pale ale, but it did not. The flavor was subtle, slightly hoppy with a delicate malt that made a nice contrast to the Red Seal and Arrogant Bastard that I like. This taste was consistant from the time I poured until I finished the last drop. I am going to put Liberty Ale on my regular list of beers to buy."
"Thick white head, settles soon. Pale orange color. Fresh aroma, incredible fruit! Peaches, apricots, citrus, with perfect integration--nothing stands over or above anything else. Quite mellow and smooth, this is an ideal session beer, not too powerful in hops or alcohol, but one that rewards the attentive. Fritz Maytag and the boys at Anchor are the ultimate craftsmen and this is a perfect product. Everything is so well-formed and pure, it's amazing. Great balance, flavor, everything!"
"The taste is supprisingly light very clean and appetizing a little dry in the finish. Nice and refreshing good on a hot day or to acompany a spicy meal!"
"Liberty Ale is a hazy, orange tinted amber beer that pours with a solid white head, that slowly dissipates to a thin film of foam. Strong citrus notes in the aroma, with a definite hop spiciness. I can smell hints of the aroma as it sits on my desk. This is a complex beer, with malt, citrus, and peppery flavors intermingling. The finish is heavy on the citrus notes. (I would imagine Cascade hops were used heavily in this beer.) The mouthfeel is very full and solid, as to be expected by the film left by the head. Carbonation is very fine bubbled, which I think helps contribute to the excellent mouthfeel. With the rather clean finish with the citrus aftertaste, I imagine this beer would go great with spicy foods. It's very drinkable, and I wish I had tried this one sooner. Very deserving of it's ranking as one of the top 50 beers. This is a well balanced, refreshing beer."
"This Ale is very impressive from the top of its head to the bottom of the glass. A cloudy offering with a nice crown that disapates to a foamy collar and light lace. The body is full, and taste leaning ever so slightly to a hoppy bitterness and there is a taste retention working here that is very pleasing to the palate."
"Light brown-yellow color, big foamy head that clings to my glass, grainy aroma. Nice balanced malt and hop flavors, smooth and easy drinking, great session beer, as all the Anchor brews."
"The original American Pale Ale. If you want near-perfection, and a model/standard to compare to, look no further."
"I'm a bit surprised. When I read the label talking about a big hop boquet, and several reviews describing the hoppiness of this beer, I suspected they were a bit dated. It had been a while since I last had this beer, and let's face it, this beer has been around for a *long* time -- 1975! What with all the Ruinations and whatnot which have come out since, I figured any pre, say, 1995 beer which proclaimed itself hoppy should be taken with a grain of salt. But hey. I was wrong. The aroma isn't overwhelming, but it *is* very hoppy and quite nice, with just a hint of malt sweetness to it. And the hop flavor makes itself known throughout the whole mouth. Great use of Cascades lend a nice floral, lemony flavor to the palate, and a oily smoothness to the mouth. Well matched by an underlying malty sweetness with a crisp dry finish. A bit cloudy in appearance from the bottle fermentation, with a light gold color and a thin wispy head. This is a beer that has stood the test of time."
"This truly is a world class Pale Ale. It looks beautiful in the glass with a nice head. There is a very noticable citrusy character to balance the cascade hops. This beer may look a tad thin, but the malt character is present, and delightful. What's most impressive, though, is that this is a beer that's been around since 1975. It's truly a pleasure to anjoy!"
"Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a thin but sticky white head. Nose is a bit hoppy and floral with notes of fresh peaches and honey. The taste is a well-balanced combination of a hop bitterness and a fresh baked biscuit sweetness with a touch of honey. A very nice brew, and at $1.29 for a 12oz bottle, I can afford to drink several of these!"
"Pours a dark golden color, with a nice, long-lasting white head that leaves thin, wispy lace. Big time hop aroma, mostly floral and citrus with hints of fruit and honey. Medium to light in body with a smooth mouthfeel. Excellent hop flavor and a nice bitterness that isn't too overpowering. Some sweetness and citrus are also present. Very enjoyable."
"Pours a huge white puffy cloud-like head, which rests over a hazy golden-orange liquid.  Head stays pretty well at the appropriate level.  Fruity aroma with a citrus hop twang and sweet and sour malt in the background.  Well-balanced is the keyword for the palate!  Smooth hop bitterness and sweet biscuit-like malt blend together just perfectly.  Slightly fruity and almost lemony.  Slight rind-like effect too, especially in the aftertaste.  Mint pops up as well in a light mint-like effect on the mouth.  This hits me as an American-style pale with a bit of English-style thrown in.  Very tasty.  I like the hop and malt varieties used, they give it a unique quality.  Great casual drinking beer."
"This beer has a nice crisp toasty malt character. It also has good hoppiness. The citric hops are not overpowering but they are noticable. Well balanced beer that I really enjoy. A bit of soapiness to the flavor."
"Cascade hops are on parade here.  There's a nice (but not over-the-top) bitterness and both citrus and floral notes are in abundance.  Malt is way back in the background but there just enough to keep the bitterness in check."
"Flavors are lemon-bright and feature plenty of hop resin. Not a huge sugar investment in this beer. What is there resembles honey, apples and succulent green herbs. Authoritatively dry. Lingering bitterness creates the urge to drench the palate again and again. How might this taste with a plate of seafood at a Vietnamese eatery downtown?"
"It explodes into the glass, a nice golden-orange with a foamy head. Citrus smells dominate, especially grapefruit, with a noticeable hop scent rounding it out nicely. This probably sounds strange, but with the citrus flavor and slight honey undertones, I can almost imagine having this as a hot drink in a mug. Not to worry, however, I won't put this one over a flame in a teapot. Liberty is a classic APA and well-deserving of its spot on the BA best beer list."
"Nearly clear orangish-gold pour with minimal but persistent head, gently maintained by light but persistent effervescence.  Aromas remind me of a wheat beer with hints of citrus and crisp hops.  A smooth taste with an initially soft sweetness that gives way to some bitterness toward the end.  This balance makes for a very favorable mouthfeel that is only slightly oily.  As expected, this is an eminently drinkable beer and my favorite bottled pale ale to date."
"Slightly hazy brassy golden color with a thick snow-white head and slight carbonation.  Bitter citrus hops and pine sap scents are very prominent in the aroma, some hints of malt as well.  Taste begins with sweet malt and honey notes with a whisper of carbonation, midway through the taste bitter hops asset themselves and linger at the back of the mouth long after the finish.  Very smooth mouthfeel with a dry finish.  Anchor Liberty Ale is what all pale ales aspire to be."
"I won't be going nearly as long before I buy this wonderful beer again as I went since I had it last!"
"Golden coloring with a thin white head. Aroma is equal parts bready malt and floral hops. Medium carbonation. Taste is toasty/biscuity malts cut by a sort of nondescript hop bitterness. A back-to-basics American pale ale."
"At one time, one of my favorite beers but there are certainly better balanced APA's available now..."
"Outstanding, its a must try for all, and somthing I must drink often and from now on, I will!"
"Fresh and in your face, a real American ale to be had here and one that I will happily make space in my beer fridge for."
"An interesting beer. Would offer a great contrast to other ales if being part of an APA session I should think."
"APA = Ah! Pourme Another !!"
"Loved this beer on draught.  Funny thing, I was at a beer fest (mirobrews&blues) and my buddy said try the anchor steam lager.  It was the best I ever had, but the lines to the kegs were switched, I was drinking the ale.  I told the rep. that I think his lines were wrong and they were.  That mistake turned out great for me.  recently I tryed Liberty out of a bottle, it was good, but not as good as draught.  If you never tried Liberty Ale dont wait, or this time it will be your mistake."
" Liberty Ale is truly a world-class Pale Ale!"
"Anchor produces an excellent APA with this one. Pours a hazy light copper hue. The head retention is outstanding... it sticks around throughout the duration of the brew. The smell is of hops with a bit of malt attempting to show itself. Tastes relatively hoppy with a nice malt profile that balances everything out quite well. Feels fairly carbonated on the tongue, but appropriately so. This would make a nice session beer."
"I'm upgradeing my review. This is a fine APA with a great flavor. I let this one warm up a bit and that help the malt hop balance. Good stuff."
"I love this stuff, it calms my hop jones, yet it isn't hop dominated, a real favorite of mine.  This is a very refreshing beer, good for all seasons.  I try to keep it stocked 24/7."
"Very orange color, medium head. This was passable but Anchor's Porter is much better. On the scale of APAs this was not as hoppy as I would have liked, but the mellowness in that area wasn't too bad. Very clean and refreshing but overall there are much better Pales out there."
"Liberty Ale has many of the fluid characteristics of Ambrosia, Nectar of The Gods."
"Pours a fairly clear pale golden color with a slightly off-white head.  It smells of hops.  It tastes of hops with a little lemony/citrusy fruit along with it.  It finishes semi-dry with a very light slightly creamy mouthfeel.  Very good pale ale brew!  Cheers!"
"This sums up what kind of beer I like.  The color is an orange/amber that seems slighly cloudy right after the poor.  It has an adequate head, white in color, and some lace.  The smell is sweet and you can tell the taste will be smooth.  Taste is sweet and hoppy and finishes well, not dry, just right.  This is one of those beers that you can never tire of (assuming you like it to start), the flavor doesn't bore you, or eventually overpower you.  Drinkability is high (too high?)"
"Flavorful and biting mediumish body.  Damn fine.  A must find.  I cannot belive I drank Liberty out of the bottle for so long.  Now I know the meaning of beer.  Cheers!"
"very flavorful with the hops hitting you right away. The taste was a complex as the aroma that finished off with a dry bitterness. Great copper color with a hugge white head that quickly vanished."
"Not bad on-tap, but much more preferred in the bottle -- seems to be hoppier in the bottle and all the flavours pop out more."
"Note to self - do not bring this out with the cousins around, unless you have more than 2 bottles. This poured out a lovely copper color with a cloudiness that made me think of a wheat. But not that wheat taste though. Definitely a citrus taste with enough hop flavor to give me a jolt! So refreshing too!"
"This beer poured a nice reddish gold color with a nice fluffly off-white head that left some lace.  It had a nice hoppy and citrus/floral aroma.  A decent amount of carbonation.  A flavor of malt and lightly of hops.  A slightly dry finish too it.  A good beer."
"Pours with a finely carbonated white pillowy head. Beautiful hazy gold with the lightest of amber highlights coming through. Wonderful fresh and perfumy Cascade hoppiness is evident in the nose. A smooth interplay of malt and hops follows the first swallow. Finishes long and luscious, with ongoing bitterness that fades out longingly. One of the American microbrewing classics, also has the best label in the business!"
"One sip and I was in heaven. It has enough hoppyness and sweetness to bring it together as a great beer. This by far is Anchor Steam's best beer!"
"While not a fan of Anchor Steam my wife bought me this brew and I said what the heck lets try it.  I was very surprised and ejoyed it, not one of the best beers I've drank but would purchase and drink again.................CHEERS"
"Semi-clear amber orange color, head is around 1/8 of an inch, mostly small but separate bubbles.  Slightly sweet aroma, mostly of a raisin-bread type of smell.  Flavor is pretty neutral, good balance of brown sugar-like malt and a good hop counterbalance.  Nice mouthfeel, if the beer suffers from anything, its a lack of an assertive tone.  A little pepper and spice but as with Anchor Steam, almost too well-balanced to me.  Good beer, maybe a session American Pale."
"Hazy light orange in hue, topped by a well retained ivory white head.  Belgian lace is left down the glass. Pungent, citrusy Cascade hop nose hits the nose at first, but minty notes and mild caramel malt sweetness follow.  Although quite appetizing, the aroma isn't quite as good as the tap version, which screams dry - hopped Cascade. The overall flavor epitomizes what a good APA should be-- the hop bitterness is assertive, yet a firm, dextrinous malt backbone provide support for the hops.  The hop flavor is all Cascade, with a pleasant and mellow grapefruit note asserting itself.  The finish is dry due to the low residual malt sweetness with a crisp and satisfying hop bitterness.  Liberty Ale is an American classic.  If you can find it fresh and well travelled, it's an outstanding American Pale Ale."
"Pours a light copper color, appears slightly hazy / cloudy but no sediment floating around like someone had mentioned in another review though. There is a slight grapefruit aroma on the nose. On the palate there is notes of grapefruit, citrus, slightly spicy perfect hop / malt balance and natural carbonation which makes it exceptionally smooth/slightly spicy tingly but very refreshing and easy to drink. Overall excellent brew!"
"Straw gold in color with a huge, dry-hopped bouquet of perfumy hops. Complex palate with several kinds of malt, hops, spices, citrus, and apricot flavors.  A worthy effort and should be on any ale lovers must try list."
"The beer is a hazy golden with fine sediment floating around. Rocky white head. There's some big grapefruit on the nose. Very piney on the palate. Spicy. And oily. A little resin kick adds some ooomph. I don't get a lot of bitterness though. Light to medium in body. Malt character is sufficient and slightly caramelly and bready. Solid IPA."
"Pours a pale golden color with a creamy white head.  Smell is of floral hops and some lighter malts.  The first thing to make an impression on the tongue are the floral hops, but as they slowly fade the great malt backbone of this beer is displayed.  Great creamy and smooth mouthfeel and the brew is very drinkable.  Great APA, not just another cookie cutter super hopped APA.  This beer has it's own character."
"A sentimental favorite for me. This beer was my introduction into the real beer world. I bought another six, just to have around to introduce friends to better beer.  Nice straw color, with slightly off-white head. Big hoppy nose and crisp hoppy taste with a certain tartness to it. Slight fruit taste as well, big bitter finish. I love this beer on many levels. A classic American Pale Ale, compliments almost any food, and it truly refreshing on its own. A fine tribute to the April 19, 1775 and everything it represents."
"I have recently revisisted this brew and fins it is worthy of a new review. Pours a cloudy, flaxen hue with a sticky retentive head. Aromas of citrus hops and fruity suspended yeast. Smooth body supports a nice balance of citrus hop character, mild malt and mellow fruity yeast contributions. Very tasty and unique ale."
"A strong pour will force a pillowy massive and sticky head. Moderate Cascade nose. Well balanced profile finishes sharp and fruity. Easy drinking ale and Anchor's best offering IMO."
"Good headed beer with a slight amber tint to the color.  This is a very smooth balenced ale with a hint of bitterness at the end that beckons you to have another.  Very clean finish.  Thirst quenching, and can be great with a wide variety of foods."
"Light in color, strong in taste. The alcohol is very prominent. Excellent aroma, good mouthfeel, nice solid lacing. Taste seemed to change a bit as the glass was emptied. Very complex solid beer from the brewery that started me on the road to beer snobdom. As an update. The last few bottles have been very refreshing with much less alcohol strength in evidence. A real tremendous beer from the pioneers!"
"I like this better than Anchor Steam.  What an aroma.  Smells like fruit, pine, and hops.  It has a taste unlike any ale I've tried.  Complex, yet simple and I can't quite put my finger on why that is.  Nice hop finish.  Leaves you wanting another one."
"Very tasty beer, not too over the top, elegant, bit spicy, bit of citrus, bit of tropical fruit, i love this stuff, only ver had it on a couple of occasions though (not too available where i am), but its up there."
"47"
"My favorite APA ever... Nice malty feel, with a hop bitterness that cleans it up nice. My shop now has these in 22oz (Florida had a ban on 22oz for some reason) and I love taking my work home :-)"
"Arguably, Liberty and Sierra Nevada Pale are the benchmarks for APAs as they are today. I still remember discovering this gem and thinking what a find it was 10yrs. or so ago. It's still a great brew."
"This is not your average pale ale - this is the best!!!!!  I try to have a Liberty Ale two or three times a year - I don't want to get used to it.  THIS IS A TOP TEN!!!!!"
"I need to revise my review of this beer, as it is worth more than just a line.  I must say this beer is one of my favorites.  Outstanding in all areas.  Perfectly golden in color with a white creamy head, you can smell the floral aromas wafting out of the glass.  Tremendous tasting- hops are outstanding.  This is what an American ale is all about."
"If you are not afraid of assertive, aromatic hops, this is the beer for you."
