4.43,13.9,4.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"The second IPA I have had from Deschutes, and it definitely lives up to the expectations I had. It pours a cloudy, dark reddish amber color with a big frothy head. The smell has lots of pine, citrus, and some other fruityness i can really pinpoint, theres also quit a bit of malt aromas. The taste reflects this aswell, and has a fairly balanced taste, and it also has what I can only describe as spicy flavor to it. Overall a really tasty somewhat unique beer, I haven't had an IPA that has tasted anything like this one.","Joe_Howard","Apr 05, 2015"

This one doesn't quite match the memory, but it is still a pretty solid IPA. If I had a complaint it is the  slightly off flavors towards the finish that combine with the bitterness. This sample was a bit past the best by date so I will have to try to find a fresher one to see if I feel any different about it.","maedhros09","Mar 03, 2015"

4.21,8.2,4.5,4,4.25,3.75,4.5,"Overall, this is probably our favorite year-round offering from Deschutes.  What is most striking is how “fragrant” everything is.  We keep coming back to that word, even when describing the flavoring.  It is either the translation itself, or the hop varietals themselves, that lend to this curious effect.  You feel almost like you’re breathing through your tongue, absorbing subtleties from the air.  They take all of the bitterness of the west coast and pack it into this tiny beer.  Again, this is especially visible through the flavoring, as you get this heavy, hard-hitting bitterness of hops that lingers forever.  It makes the mouth water.  This is funny, in a sense, because it seems all the hops here are dried, pellet form.  They taste just like those hops you get in the beginner brewer kits, but a bit more souped-up.  Maybe this beer is so approachable because it feels like the best beer you could ever make from those kits.  Like, you could do it yourself, if you reached your maximum potential of home brewing in this realm.  This is obviously a bizarre comparison, but something we thought of nonetheless.  This is fantastic, and should be considered a must-try for any true lover of the style.","TheBrewo","Feb 17, 2015"

Those IBUs were balanced nicely and this was a fantastic IPA.","BrewChatKen","Oct 28, 2014"

The head on it (the beer, not Ambyr) was firm and looked like dirty straw. This IPA has a good  flowery smell that you expect from an IPA.  The taste was very grassy - or maybe that was because i had just finished mowing the lawn. The bitterness stayed a bit too long for my taste so i marked this down on the feel and on taste.","HopsScotch","Oct 11, 2014"

Nice note of citrus (mainly grapefruit) with a little bit of concentration. Off the top, nice bitterness, almost perfect bitterness... strong malt backbone and pine, pine, pine. Yum.

3.9,0.3,4.75,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Final Word: Great flavors in this beer, but the strong hop presence in the finish makes it a bit too potently bitter for the drinker that doesn’t love hops. There’s a lot of citrus and malt character, so it still sits in much better balance than many IPAs, and isn’t an IPA that only hop heads can get into. However, you need to be pretty familiar with hoppy beers and hop flavors to enjoy this one, or else the intense, dry bitterness on the finish is going to turn you away. If you already love IPAs, this beer will definitely satisfy and is worth picking up if one of your favorites isn’t available. I’ve had better IPAs, but they are some of the best around, so this beer still sits high on the list.","Louisville-Beer-Reviews","Jun 21, 2014"

3.73,-4.1,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"The first sip of this beer brought me a lot of typical citrus notes from the hops. I experienced some slight sweetness from the malt which was followed by pine-bitterness from the hops. The mouthfeel was medium bodied. The head was a off faint khaki color about an finger worth. It smelled of citrus, and slight bread notes from the malt. I purchased this on a whim after deciding to put back their obsidian stout which I like. I figured i'd try something else from the brewery. Overall, I am not disappointed. I can't say I would go out of my my way to get another sixer of this, but it will be on my mind when in a pinch, given that it was 7.99 at the store. I would recommend this to those who are looking for a session IPA that still want hops, but not too much and would rather not have a lower tier ipa (i.e. long hammer, etc.) The 6.8 abv puts it a slight notch above your standard session brew, so beware of that.","XCaliBrew","Jun 03, 2014"

4.38,12.6,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Went with a shaker pint glass on this one. Served into the glass out of the bottle. Color is amber to copper. Off-white head (picture aged paper). Very good clarity. Numerous bubbles rising to the top of the glass. The head had some rolling irregularities to it (not 100% uniform but not what I would call rocky). Aroma definitely had hops, but it was more delicate and less assertive that some IPA's I have had. That is not a criticism of this beer by any means. Very fresh, clean, fruit, hops smell. The head persisted thinly to the bottom of the glass. I think I know why they call this ""Inversion IPA"". Not a dry beer. The hops play the large role, but the maltiness is a close second (an inversion of what I am accustomed to). Lots of deep raisiny, plummy flavors, and in the finish (inhaling deeply after I put down the glass) I'm getting peach yogurt. Very interesting. The lacing in the glass was well banded showing everywhere I paused between sips. I will definitely come back to this one.","TangoMike","Apr 27, 2014"

Looks like an amber. Aroma of pine, grapefruit, floral bouquets, some other orange citrus rind too. Flavor had a nice caramel and bready malt presence, a nice bit of bitter pine, some citrus character. Insanely drinkable and very nice, leaning more toward the APA style than IPA. Light to medium bodied, slightly resinous, with medium plus carbonation. A really nice every day type of beer that I would love to have available locally.","BMMillsy","Feb 26, 2014"

This beautiful ale pours a rich reddish copper color with a substantial off white head that gives way to a nice film and handsome lacing. The aroma is hoppy and bitter with notes of pine, grass, tropical fruit, and citrus. This ale sips very smooth and easy (I could get in trouble with a sixer of these). The flavor is a spectacular blend of hops and malt. Slightly sweet on the front end and then crushingly bitter on the tail. This is a very underrated ipa that should be more recognized as the awesome ale that it is. Can't wait to try more from this brewery. If anyone from Deschutes is reading this; please come to Michigan soon.","lochef81","Feb 21, 2014"

Now, fast forward to 1/24/14 Deschutes has launched in Ohio with their four main stays Inversion IPA, Black Butte Porter, Mirror Pond Pale Ale, and Red Chair Pacific Northwest Ale along with Hop Henge IPA one of their fantastic specialty releases. A fantastic introductory IPA that can be enjoyed by the masses and those in the know when it comes to hops. Complex drinkable and definitely hoppy enough to be one of the stand out IPAs from the Pacific Northwest. Abundant hops in this beautiful glowing amber body big billowing cream colored head leaves intricate speckled lacing on the sides of my glass. Aromatics give out hints of pine, citrus, with dank earthy hops. Flavor has a well crafted malt backbone hints of bready/caramel malts without hitting overt sticky sweetness. Really nice IPA, I'm ready to drink another bottle it's that type of beer. It will blown your mind how good a solid stable IPA can be and it's probably a majority of the reason this company has grown beyond the PNW to the state of Ohio along with the fact that I've never had a bad beer from them. Texture slightly resinous with hop oils and flowing carbonation carries the beer great over the palate. Overall, this works so well. I'm a fan of Inversion and every other hoppy ale from them that I've tried!!!","WVbeergeek","Jan 25, 2014"

Inversion is an orange to reddish amber brew with ample off-white bitter foam and a very rustic kind of vibe. Aroma is very sweet caramel malt and classic American hops (grapefruit citrus and twangy herbal notes). The taste is dominant tangerine citrus (not as much grapefruit) and a sweet malt backbone like gummy candy and caramel, with a little dark toast. Very smooth bitterness without harsh notes or strong pine, its resinous but more restrained than many other American IPAs. Some brown spice notes combine with the aforementioned flavors to create an effect like sweet orange spice tea. Little rank tropical flavor but there are earthy and grassy notes in the finish. The body is silky smooth and not terribly heavy. Overall picture is that of a sophisticated and cultured bitterness, with a decent weave of classic flavors and superb integration and balance. If you care, the recipe for this thinking man's ale appears in Mitch Steele's book on IPA. Check out the interesting mix of old school and cutting edge hop cultivars.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 29, 2013"

With the tropical fruits and citrus on the front and a palette coating pine bitterness on the back with a heavier malt profile that added a hint of sweetness. In the end the Inversion IPA was a refreshing and solid IPA.","brurevu","Aug 27, 2013"

3.91,0.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a beautiful deep amber, with a finger and a half of fluffy, off-white head that stuck around. It looks fantastic. Scents of citrus and slight pine, but with a lot stronger a scent of malt. What I normally expect from an IPA, with a little bit more malt. Flavor is hoppy, with citrus, pine, some floral notes and a bit of a fruity character. There is a nice malt presence in the background, mostly caramel malt, though there is a nice bready flavor on the finish and in the aftertaste. Pretty on style for an IPA. Maybe a little too malty for my taste. The hops are present and quite good though. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. It's pleasant and easy to drink. Slightly stickier than I like, but not unpleasantly so. Overall it's a pretty good IPA. Different from a lot of the West Coast IPAs I've tried, but similar in some ways. It's not bad, though I'm not sure I'd make it my go-to IPA.","Auraan","Aug 21, 2013"

Sharp raw herbs right from the get-go with a surprisingly hefty maltiness - toasted bread with a slather of caramel. Hops continue to smack around the palate despite the malt. Grapefruit pith, coarse herbal flavors, hopsack, earthiness, under-ripe strawberry, grassy bitterness. The 80 IBUs shows off in the long biter finish. Not the juicy citrus/pine bomb I was expecting, but more of an old school craft IPA with a focus on bitterness as much as hop flavor and aroma.

I'm sure they wanted to try something a little different, but a less overpowering malt base would let the great hops in this brew come forward a lot more. Still, quite a deal at $8 for a sixer.

If this is meant to be one of the first groundbreaking IPAs in American craft brewing, I can see that for sure. The malts are pretty delicious, but the hop oil does get pervasive, so at that point I would not necessarily introduce this to newbies with hops. Still a great pick, and up to par with Deschutes' standards for sure.","magictacosinus","Jan 20, 2013"

Aroma of pine and light citrus hops with some caramelized malt is pretty good. Taste is mostly dominated by floral pine and citrus notes with light fruity ester and a pretty solid caramel malt backbone. Bitterness level is about average with quite a bit of floral undertones.

Very complex and well balanced - Deschutes has dry hopping down to a fine art. At 6.8% there is the expected defined alcohol warming - just as it should be with a big IPA. Very drinkable for 80 IBU with a note of carmel and a very subtle malt aftertaste. Exactly what I look for in an everyday beer - very hoppy but not so over-the-top that you can't drink 4 or 5 in one sitting.

Tastes include lots of bready malt, brown bread crust, caramel, piny and spicy hop, pungent grapefruit rind, lingering bitterness with resiny pine oils sticking to the palate with some burnt caramel on the finish. Bitterness builds with each sip taken. Mouth-feel is creamy, smooth, medium body, with nice carbonation. This is definitely a quality IPA, but i think this is getting close to being past its prime.

Head retention is decent, and thick rings of lacing are left behind, but the color is just a bit dark and murky for my taste. The nose has a little bit of caramel to it, followed by some flowery and citrusy notes. Those hop aromatics just don't jump out the glass the way they should in an IPA though. There's a little bit of caramel again at the front end of each sip. The bitterness that comes through next is plenty bold, but the hoppy finish fails to deliver. It's not quite as weak as the nose, but the grapefruit peel flavor is just not intense enough. The body isn't quite west coast dry, but it's not as sweet as some more malt forward interpretations of the style either. The carbonation though is just dull, it feels like the beer fizzles out by mid palate. I'm more than a little surprised by how lackluster I find this bottle of Inversion IPA, usually I'm very fond of Deschutes beers. It honestly just tastes old to me, I'm wondering if Deschutes isn't setting the ""best by"" date a bit too far out from the bottling date.","axeman9182","Aug 16, 2012"

3.9,0.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Aroma is mild and hints of a fresh hop presence and a substantial malt body. Flavor is seriously big on hops. Citrus zest and dry. Very west coast / PNW kind of IPA. That said, this beer isn't particularly ""pale"" or otherwise grapefruity like a traditional American IPA. I'd go so far as to say this is more of a imperial red ale or American strong ale. While the flavors in this big beer are very enjoyable, and there's no detectable alcohol burn, IMO the total ABV hurts drinkability of this otherwise very refreshing brew. Which is sad because it's so tasty I'd really like it to become my go-to PNW high-IBU ale. I guess what I'm saying is this is a great beer and it's a shame it's not my new session IPA. Or maybe I'm just in the mood for something a little lighter today.","hreb","Aug 12, 2012"

Poured with an off-white foam that reduced to a soapy cap and left thick sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Soft ripe citrusy aroma that is propped up by a sweet caramel malt backbone. Medium bodied with rich creamy feel and carbonation from the beginning to the end but thins at the finish. Pungent citrus hop flavors up front with pine hops to follow. Hop bitterness creates a tangy bite in the middle before an intense pine hop bitter finish. The caramel malty sweetness is overwhelmed for most of ride but shows signs of life beneath.","IronLover","Jul 16, 2012"
4.07,4.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5," The flavor is very good, lots of piney hop flavors swirling with mild floral and citrus ringd flavor with a good dose of grapefruit and mild toasted malt with a smidge of caramel to round it out and keep the astringent element at a minimal place with lots of dank and juicy hop flavor, this is very fresh tasting with a nice dry quality as it finishes with both herbal and light alcohol tinges. Overall I was really impressed with this based on the amount of hop flavor, it is very bitter too, but not over the top, just agressive enough to keep you coming back for more.","Slatetank","Jul 16, 2012"

Taste is lemon, grapefruit, and blackberries - very bitter but still fairly well balanced by the toffee malt. If you took away half the IBU's I think you'd have a pretty decent amber. Medium mouthfeel with nice dry sticky finish that really asheses to the tongue. Overall a great Northwest IPA which pushes the limits of bitterness without becoming unbalanced.","coldriver","Jul 15, 2012"

Sweet malt and light aromatic hop aroma. Flavor is sweet and caramel malt and moderate hops, aromatic hop bite on the finish moderated by the malt. A very pleasant IPA. The hops are not outstanding, but everything is done well and has a nice ratio of hops to malt. Definitely a repeater.","LiquidAmber","Mar 21, 2012"

I'm not a huge hophead or the biggest IPA fan in general (I've gotten myself to be able to appreciate the style more of late, but it's still not my first choice most of the time), but I feel that this is a very well crafted west coast IPA. I feel like Deschuttes is one of those breweries that meets that rare cross-section of widely available and extremely reliable, and Inversion is no diversion from that path. Definitely pick it up and give it a shot if you're curious. Or even if you aren't really. Just give it a shot, it'll probably win you over.","kemoarps","Mar 08, 2012"

Some hints of sweet malts in the background of the nose. Assertive bitterness with a balanced degree of english malt, this beer tastes like a sherbert. I dig it. Medium bodied with light on moderate carb and a wet finish. I stopped drinking this flagship a couple years ago because I found it too simple. Don't know if the recipe or I just changed, but good stuff - reminds me of Hop Henge 2012 (light version)","harrymel","Mar 08, 2012"
3.54,-9,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"A dark amber with a thumbs width beige head. Nice lacing. A nice bready but sweet malt base paired with some pine and citric - orange and grapefruit - hops. Flavor matches the aroma pretty well with the malt base giving it an underlying sweetness and breadiness paired with the hops providng some resin and citrus. A slightly more than moderate prickly bitterness carries through the entire sip and into the aftertaste, the one aspect of this beer I like least. Its not smack you in the face aggressive bitter, its quite mild in that regard, but its strong because of its duration. Its there the entire time and the length enhances its effect on the taste buds. Not quite medium bodied but not thin either, active from carbonation. A pretty good, easy to drink IPA from Deschutes here. Generally not a huge IPA fan so I probably wont drink this one a whole lot but I definitely enjoyed this.","denver10","Mar 07, 2012"

Some pine and general forest character. Sturdy malt base with a bit of earthiness. Less dense than the nose suggested. Bitter finish that lingers for some time, no alcohol to speak of which was nice for the ABV. Medium low carbonation.

Smell is of malt, fruits, and citrus zest. Taste is of malt and citrus zest. There is a medium amount of bitterness that lingers aftre each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good IPA that has a nice balance between the malt and the hops.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 29, 2011"

Loads of bitter grapefruit in the nose. Lots of pine and citrus with just a bit of a tropical back bone. Huge amounts of hops in the taste. Straight up piney bitterness with just enough malt profile to balance it out. Just a bit. Awesome hop fix right here. Mouth feel is is on par as well. Goes down smooth and has a pleasing oily finish.

That disappears on the tongue, where bitter pine cones dominate. Old penny finish with the fizz lingering until the swallow. A little thinner than the the smell suggests, but that's OK.

Strongly recommended if that's your thing.","biegaman","Jul 24, 2011"

I am so glad I decided to pick up a single bottle of this so that I could not only review it but revisit an old friend.

I don't think that I have had a beer from Deschutes that I didn't like, but this is my first one. I believe that I can just expect this from a brewer in the NorthWest where hops are in abundance...but it is a shame that this beer doesn't have any better balance than it does.

3.46,-11.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This one pours a nice golden amber color with a finger of off white head. Webby lacing. The nose is faint, offering some caramel and light citrus notes. The taste is a bit more impressive, offering some bready sweet malt and some pine and citrus hop flavors. Although the balance isnt achieved here, it is quite drinkable and tasty with a creamy mouthfeel. Decent IPA.","ChugginOil","May 29, 2011"
3.65,-6.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a standard but very nice looking one and a half finger head, the head is slightly off white. The head has some small bubbles and some big bubbles, from the side the bubbles look a lot different, not very good though from the side. Excellent lacing throughout the beer. Carbonation looks just about perfect, maybe a touch less would be perfect, but pretty dang close. The body is a orangish-reddish color, very unique for an IPA really. Not very transparent, but I can see a few things on the other side. The head is now mostly gone, but it's retained a little bit, and it isn't going away so that's good. Overall the appearance is really good, I don't know if it deserves a 4.5, maybe it does, but I'm going to give it a 4. The smell is hoppy, malty and boozy. Right off the bat I can tell there will be a significant malt note and alcohol note in this beer, which is a little disappointing, because the malts should be on the lower side in an IPA, and the alcohol is always better when it's masked, regardless of the style. There is still a heavy hop smell in this beer, so I have no doubt it will be a quality brew, just a little disappointing by that heavy malt and alcohol. Other things I notice, it smells really clean and refreshing, not too complex though. It's a quality smell, so it gets a 4, but for sure nothing over that because of the malts and alcohol smell. Not very much flavor on this IPA, I'm shocked. I'm not drinking it ice cold, so there shouldn't be anything holding back on the flavor. I mean it's just really watery, maybe I have a bad bottle, I have another bottle, so I'll check to see if that one is the same, but wow. Somewhat malty, somewhat hoppy, pretty well balanced on those accounts. No alcohol on the flavor like I thought there would be, but overall the dominating factor is....water. Slightly crisp, but for the most part the carbonation is very low as well, I guess you can't judge a book by it's cover. I do pick up a little alcohol now, but it's not much, and it's not bad. Overall, it's just not very flavorful, I'm in awe. I mean it's not a bad flavor, and what I can taste is good, it's just way too light, especially considering it's 6.8%. Mouthfeel is big enough, it fills up your mouth enough to be a solid feel, but the carbonation, it's just way too low. Second strait beer where the carbonation has just been way low for my liking. I want to give this beer higher rating on the mouthfeel because the feel isn't that thin, it tastes watery, but it doesn't feel watery; but the carbonation just kills it for me. Overall on this beer I'm shocked at how flavorless it is, I mean really, WOW, I'm at the bottom of the glass now and not much has changed. It's still a good beer, it's well made, it's tastes good, just not a sufficient IPA. I don't know what more to say, not a terrible beer, it's a good beer, but most definitely not anything more than that.","MaltsOfGlory","May 25, 2011"
3.85,-1,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"A decent IPA, but I prefer many more to this one. If I'm drinking Deschutes 6 packs, Obsidian Stout will be first and foremost on my list.","obrike","May 25, 2011"
3.82,-1.8,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"A reddish amber color with a small tan head. Evenly laced during consumption. Pretty well balanced nose as pine and grass lead into a subtle toffee note. Smells like it will he thick. A little sticky in the mouth. Hops as used more for bitterness than taste. Again, hops/malt is equally spread as this is darker and tastes more like a hopped amber or ESB. Still, very drinkable and a present beer, just not a great IPA.","spree92","May 21, 2011"

There is plenty of chunky lacing around the glass as the foam slowly dissipates. The nose is a bit complex with rip orange and a subtle honey boozyness. This beer is surprising as it does not look or smell like an average IPA but is striking and smells delicious non the less. The taste is also complex with a strong malty presence up front more like a Scotch Ale. This is then followed immediately by a bitter orange then a floral blast. The mouthfeel is slightly dry and has a lingering burnt bitterness. This is a very complex beer and a mixture of many styles that makes it both delicious and intersting. Oh, and it has good retention and is almost 7%.","LazyL","Apr 25, 2011"

Nose is piney and malty; also hoppy with a medley of fruits lurking that I cannot peg down without help from the bottle (citrus). Brew is bitter on the palate. Nice, well-carbonated mouthfeel that goes down smoothly but a welcome coat lingers on the palate. Bitter, piney aftertaste. Bitterness lingers for several minutes. Very refreshing.

The nose comprises a sweet caramel covered in a solid layer of understated citrus peel and even more understated pine. Nothing is overt, but at the same time nothing is truly weak, either. Very nice. The taste pumps the pine and especially the citrus (it seems like some ruby red grapefruit) up a notch, while the caramel remains as demure as the height of Victorian maidenhood. The grapefruit rind is a bit sharp, but doesn't go so far as to viscerally hurt. The body is a rather light medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a pretty solid IPA, though strangely hard with the grapefruit. The only thing knocking against the drinkability is the length of time the grapefruit peel hangs around the back of the throat, stabbing with a tiny arrowhead. It's still pretty good beyond that, though.","TMoney2591","Sep 29, 2010"

Might be some light caramel back there, and hops are surprisingly low key considering this is an IPA, but what hops I do manage to get out of the smell are lightly piny. Hmm, this beer is hard to judge. It really has no IPA qualities to me. This tastes like an American Amber/Red Ale rather than IPA. It's very malty, again with the toast and bread, some light caramel, but not overly sweet. Hops are way in the background, and like the nose they largely consist of pine flavors, some herbaceous tinges, some citrus, with a short supply of bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with very low carbonation. I don't get it. How is this an IPA? Where are the hops? Best before date is 10/5/10, so I know it's not super old. I'm sort of baffled.

There is a solid bitterness though out the sip, but the rest of the taste vanishes quicklly leaving no aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture.

Aroma is mostly hops with hints of orange, apricote, and pineapple. But the flavor is more balanced. Still fairly bitter with plenty of citrus/tropical fruit hop flavors, but there is a nice sweet caramel base. A little like Juicy Fruit. I think the malt brings out the flavors of the hops even more. The hop flavor just seems to go on and on. Finishes bitter with a pineapple and kiwi aftertaste. The body feels large enough to carry the bitterness but it is not so heavy as to hamper enjoyment during hot weather. Good carbonation. This is one of the better examples of an American IPA.

I like that I can have a few of these and not feel like a hop bomb went off in my mouth.

Other times, it fades quickly, is replaced with an almost wood and tobacco (maybe they slipped in some oaked tobacco barrels to age it in) denigration of the beer, hence why it suffers in my rating on the last two categories. Maybe these guys are blending not so good batches. Something happened that made this beer not as good as it used to be, but then again, Deschutes has been riding on their past success for a few years now.","Beerandraiderfan","Dec 24, 2009"

The taste is majorly defined by moderately bitter and sticky caramel malt character. It has the bitterness of a typical IPA, but very little pine and a barely noticeable floral quality A lot of tealike characteristics as it warms, especially in the midpalate and finish. Pretty much zero fruitiness. Very little showcasing of any hops, a very lackluster IPA. Medium-thick body and matching medium carbonation. A drinkable beer, but boring. Where are the hops?

This backbone comes through to the flavor, but the hops aren't quite as full as they are in the aroma. It has a good feel, not incredible but solid. It's just a really solid IPA, a great way to get your hop fix for less than a buck and a quarter per beer. Deschutes makes some great beers. I tend to underestimate them for no particular reason. I don't know why. I can think of a great number of excellent beers that they make. Black Butte, alone, is one of my very favorite porters, and it's also affordable.

Taste consistent with nose, but grapefruit flavor is amplified, leaving a lingering bitterness between quaffs.

The taste is a burst of citrus hops, with a malt backbone that takes a major backseat to the hops. I would like to have seen a little more malt in this one to provide more of a backbone for the strong grapefruit hop flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, very nice texture.

A strong amount of bitter hops flavor, with a relatively mild citrus flavor compared to a San Diego IPA. It could really use a higher dose of citrus to balance out the aspirin taste.

Huge dirty citrus and pine with a wonderful caramel background that tops this one off just right. Surprisingly the flavor begins with the sweet caramel malt that is quickly thrown aside by the a clean pine hop taste. Grapefruit emerges soon after followed by a bittering effect that leaves the mouth pretty dry, but not too much. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy, different for this style but I like it.

The NW hops are ample, but it is good without being over-the-top kick-ass bitter. Very smooth, nice mouthfeel and no trace of 6.8% abv, highly drinkable. The smell even opens up a bit as the beer warms in the glass. Yes, now, just before hitting that review button, I must bump the smell score up from 3.5 to 4.0 as it's really come around to reveal an ale with loads of depth and character. Overall quite good.

A really well balanced IPA with plenty of citrusy hop character and caramel malt to offset the hops. Starts with a hoppy bang, the middle balances things out then ends with another hoppy bang. Wish this was available in my area on a regular basis. Not an over the top IPA but one that is relatively easy on the palate and easy to drink. I could easily make a session of these, howver, the 6.8% abv will sneek up on you. Overall, a really good IPA and on that I wouldn't hesitate buying again. Glad I have one more left.

3.58,-8,4,3.5,4,3,3,"I like this beer a lot, and its 75 IBUs makes it a step up from their former IPA, Quail Springs, which was somewhat underhopped. The beer is a nearly clear bright copper color with a two finger off white head that sticks around for a while and leaves significant lacing. The nose in this beer changes depending on the temperature. The beer was 55 degrees to begin with, and at that point the smell was all hops; crisp and piney. As the beer warmed toward 60, much more of the malt came out in its smell. For a bitter IPA, this is a balanced beer. The after taste is dominated by its long pine-citric hop finish, but while the beer is still on the palate caramelly malts abound. The mouthfeel is sharp and medium bodied. As much as I like this beer and love the IPA style, this one seems to suffer on the drinkability side.

I caught a whiff of pine with a strong citrus orange aroma and a bit floral. This one has got some bitter bite to it, damn. Almost a spicy hop bite in the beginning that tingles the tongue then it fades into a different kind of more dull bitterness that is not nearly as pleasant as the first, but still satifactory. There's a little ctirus in there, but all I really get is a hops piled on more hops. Mouthfeel is creamy at first with a very dry finish.

Maybe a bit unbalanced to enjoy as a session ale. I drank this for the first time after brewing my first IPA. The hops from the brew session were lingering so I enjoyed this immensely.","ChrisA","Jun 30, 2006"
3.93,1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"First thing that struck me on the first drink, was the creamy mouthfeel. I didn't expect that. It's not a bad thing, just caught me off guard. The hops definately are the first thing to jump out here, but they are subdued and quickly tamed by the malt back. Solid IPA, and another great offering from Deschutes.","ReebShorts","Jun 29, 2006"
4.08,4.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability  This is a big-bodied IPA that will fill you up in a hurry. I really enjoyed the harmonious mix of flavors and the heavy, slick mouthfeel.","RoyalT","Jun 25, 2006"

4.24,9,4,5,4.5,3,3.5,"Big hops from this beer! Very high IBU's but remarkable well balanced with a nice malty undertone. Copper to Red in appearance. Nice creamy tan head that forms an easy 2 fingers in a standard pint glass. Dry hopped for 7 days and you can really tell with the fresh herb nose that is readily present as soon as you stick your nose in it. Finishes clean with a bit of a zip. ABV in the upper 6's and you can taste the alcohol as well. A great seasonal for Deschutes. Nice job.","JohnY","Jun 17, 2006"
4.23,8.7,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Mouth: Very strong lasting hop flavor from the entrance through the swallow. There's an interesting herb flavor in the front that makes me think of a farm, like alfalfa, and in the back that herbiness takes on some mint qualities. Mouthfeel is excellent!","clickpush","Jun 12, 2006"
3.48,-10.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Nice half-inch creamy top, color is dark cloudy copper with some floating sediment. Fine lace. MIld aroma of pine-like hops and sweet citrus present. Sweet and orange-like, the nose is moderately strong and very pleasant. The taste is not what you'd expect, virtually none of the citrus sweetness in the smell comes through in the flavor. Sharp and sour up front, the malt is subdued, and the hop freshness has dissipated some also. I get a nutty taste in the finish with some bitterness, but mostly a light sour flavor toward the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is light to medium with a slight smoothness, not bad. I might drink another one of these, but considering the wide selection of IPA's out there I definitely have better choices.","bennetj17","Jun 10, 2006"

4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Dark orange with an off white fluffy head. Nice citric hop bite in the nose with some underlying sweet caramel malts. A bit of pine as well. Bitter citric and pine hops upfront before the malty backbone brings some balance to the flavor. Lingering slightly dry hoppy finish thats a touch fruity. I really liked the bitterness here that is sometimes missing from IPAs. Good mouthfeel with a thick enough body and smooth going down. Easy drinking and plenty hoppy enough to satisfy me I could have had a few.","meathookjones","Jun 06, 2006"

4.07,4.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I have been drinking this beer for about two weeks now and I am finding that if I have a fresh hop craving this just hits the spot. I highly recommend this beer, especially if you can get a fresh sample.","Gueuzedude","Jun 04, 2006"
3.88,-0.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"A beer that looks near perfect but is slightly flawed in the glass. I could see buying this again if it was cheaper than my usual Pale Ale but I can't see buying this instead of my usual local craft beer. Worth a try but not anything super special.","Zorro","Jun 03, 2006"
3.71,-4.6,4.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Overall, a well done IPA. It's a bit unbalanced, but nice if you're in the mood for a hop-bomb.","Beaver13","Jun 02, 2006"
4.32,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Notes: Hmmmm I'm not quite sure if this deserves elite status but for now its damn good and well above average. Deschutes has some really nice offerings once you get done sampling the lot.","DogFood11","Jun 02, 2006"
3.09,-20.6,3,4,3,2.5,2.5,"Amber / copper body with a thick creamy head, settles a bit after a few minutes but leaves a nice lace. Smells deeply sweet, caramel/bready with citrusy and earthy hops. Aroma is deliciously balanced. The sweetness comes through huge in the taste, though, along with a heavy, syrupy mouthfeel. Hop taste is a bit dirty and bitter, definitely sour grapefruity but not a lot else going on. A bit too sour and bitter to drink very many.","PeatReek","May 30, 2006"

4.25,9.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I forget just how good beer from this brewery really is. A quick review of my reviews reminds me that this is my 11th Deschutes beer and that I've only given one of them less than a 4.0 for flavor. I'm not sure I can say that about too many other breweries. Inversion is a beer that I would be bringing home by the case if I was fortunate enough to have ready access.","BuckeyeNation","May 28, 2006"
4.15,6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"a damn nice beer, well, just like everything deschutes does. iVery balanced, and equal in it's hoppy and maltiness.","pjwilson","May 19, 2006"
4.2,8,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a slightly rusty orangish color with above average lace for an IPA, and some small chunks floating in suspension that I really hope are hop pieces. Smell is gorgeous, citrus/resin aroma noticible from a couple feet away, floral notes as I get closer, and a hint of sweet malt upon close investigation. Tangy citrus flavors are right up front, with even a clovish spice to it. I don't think I've ever wanted to describe an IPA as having a creamy flavor, but this seems to fit that bill. Mouthfeel is nice, I like an IPA to be a little thicker, but for a moderate 6.8% ABV beer it still qualifies as quite good. Drinkability? I'm on my second and I could go for at least 3 more. A session IPA? This is my first encounter with Inversion, but I think it may become one fo my benchmarks for a well balanced non-extreme American IPA. I'm thinking I may want to keep a couple of these around to introduce non-hopheads to the style.","Pooba001","May 19, 2006"
4.08,4.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Nice inch thick head floats atop the orange crimson body. Very pleasing to look at. Decent bit of lacing but not enough to complete the perfect score. Nose is pine that shoots like an arrow to the nose, mingled with a weird boiled cornlike veggie smell. Taste is once again pine, unsweetened sap, and grapefruit mixed with caramel. The hops certainly get center stage here, with no attempt at balance. Mouth is dense and lush with sparse carbonation acting like a masseuse. This would be a nice IPA to session with.","TheBungyo","May 17, 2006"

4.54,16.7,4,5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle a blurred orange-brown with a stupendous frothy light tan head, a magnificent crown to the body, after is slow demise, the resultant lace forms a tight skirt upon the glass. Noticed some little fernies floating in the beer also, yum I love that stuff. Nose has a magnificent hop floral aroma citrus like in its crispness, sweet malt, and fresh and mouthwatering this nose, start is sweet at the front, the grain profile perfection, and the top middling in its feel. Finish has a pleasing acidity, the hops, wham, they snap your taste buds to attention, with the aftertaste long and lingering, a real treat this beer, from one of the worlds best breweries, and a long time top five brewery in my book.","Gusler","May 13, 2006"
4.15,6.7,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This bottle comes courtesy of Loren01... pours a rather dark, but bright amber with head that initially impresses but fades rather quickly. Smell is pretty standard for an IPA, but pleasing nonetheless. Lots of citrus and doughy malt notes in there. As for the taste, the initial citrus sweetness of the beer switches in a snap to heightened bitterness that's powerful yet restrained. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with light carbonation. This is what an IPA used to be, before all the hops arms race that's resulted in so many double IPAs out there. This beer is hoppy, it's malty, but it's not so extreme in either characteristic that it can't be enjoyed as a session beer.","geexploitation","May 02, 2006"

While hop henge still pleases my pallete more, this beer proves to be flavorful without pushing the alcohol levels up over the 8% range. A good job producing, and - at this point - leveling an IPA with a marketing plan at large groups of people.","edmundfitzoil","Apr 21, 2006"
4.12,5.9,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D- This is old school ""micro-brew"". You have to love this raw beast, it brings back so many memories of what some of the IPA were like back in the 1990's. Inversion IPA is a must try, especially if you love hoppy beers. Paired well with a pressed German Ham and Swiss pannini.","Jason","Apr 16, 2006"
3.63,-6.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with good carbonation. The bitter hops at the end make you that much more ready for the malt at the beginning of the next sip. After one bottle, I'm feeling it a bit, and so I think two or three would do me for the night. Tasty though, and a nice treat after a hard day at work.","waldowin","Apr 14, 2006"
3.9,0.3,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours a cloudy burnt orange color with suspended particles that appear to be the residual of dry-hopping. The pretty, creamy half-inch tan head sticks around for a while. Assertive aroma of floral, piney hops reaches out and grabs you. Palate is more of the same - aggressive piney hops, with a hint of grapefruit and grass in the background. A very light caramel malt tempers the hops oh-so slightly. Body is substantial and just a tad sticky. Truthfully, the hops get to be a bit much after a while, but this is still a tasty IPA, and a considerable step up from its predecessor, Quail Springs.","ElGordo","Apr 11, 2006"
