"This is great IPA. I prefer Two Hearted Ale, but Founder's makes a smooth and balanced beer. The hops are just right, and the aftertaste leaves you wanting more. Darker in color with an orange tint, I recommend this beer."
"Orange or dark gold in color. The taste was tangy, almost sour, with a weird after taste to follow."
""
""
"I haven't been much on the session IPA craze but this is a very nice beer.  My main aversion to the style is monetary. I can't bring myself to spend $11 on a six pack of beer this low ABV. However it was a hot day and I had just walked a couple of miles. This was on happy hour special and it hit the spot when the others choices were heavier IPAs or Allagash white. This split the difference of what I needed. Great hop flavor but a lighter more drinkable body. Really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best thing about this beer is a relatively low alcohol content for an IPA."
""
"Had on draft this. Solid session ipa"
""
""
"Best tasting session IPA I have had. Nice and hoppy full body taste, very smooth finish, I purchase these in 15 pack cans and it's very reasonably priced."
""
""
""
"Perfect session IPA, reminds me of moon man with a little more bitterness. Refreshing, good color for the style with nice head retention. Slightly floral with citrus. I love it"
"Color is clear gold with a frothy white head that slowly receded to clumpy islands.  Lacing is okay.  Smell is really nice - tropical and citrus fruit.  Flavor is also very good.  It's a little subdued, being a session IPA, but still very tasty.  Body is light/medium with good carbonation.  Overall, one of the first session IPA I've had that I actually would enjoy sessioning."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Heavy grapefruit, a bit much for me otherwise would be a 4. Good balance malt, crisp and not too dry"
""
"probably my favorite session ipa... usually buy the suitcase of 15 cans"
""
"An IPA that you can drink multiple of and not got sick of"
""
""
""
"Poured from a tap into a 16 oz pint glass, an unremarkable blonde-gold color with a short lived white head that left a lot of lace. Mild hop aroma. Tastes strongly of piney resin and bright citrus hops, rather astringent at first, almost more Pine-Sol than pine, but then rounds out with a little more malt for a clean light finish. Mouthfeel is pleasant and slightly sticky. The overall flavor profile just slightly off-key, the front a tad too bitter, the finish a tad too watery. This reminds me of sodas or juice drinks with reduced sugar: my tongue misses the boozy heft of the real thing. However when you want those bitter hops but only a minor buzz, this gets the job done and is fairly pleasant."
"All the facets of an IPA like the bitterness, stinky Hop breath, and satiating of the pine tree palate without all the buzz. I guess I'm happy that I can reliably go beer for beer with my Bud drinking friends IPA style now without looking (or feeling) inadequate....at the same time it's a bummer that I'm gonna have to drink a few more of these IPAs before I'm feeling good. Though it may take one or two more to get me going, that's okay, because this one has a bright, citrus flavor to it that tastes pretty good actually."
""
"O - This is a great session IPA. Perfect for a drinking session or a warm day."
""
""
"O: Very good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Easily the best session IPA i've ever heard. No reason to ever drink a bud light again with this beer. Easily worth the extra money for a 15 pack as opposed to a 12er for 18 for little difference in price. Glad I found it."
""
""
"Prefer it in cans, the 15 pack of Founders All Day IPA can almost always be found in my fridge.  Excellent, excellent IPA, punches way above its ""class/ABV," and is enjoyable one at a time, or eight at a time!"

"Pours a clear golden color with little to no head and minimal lace. Nice sweet aroma of malts, fruity esters, honey, bananas and vanilla. Hop heavy taste with strong citric bite. Strong carbonation and lighter bodied than your typical ipa. Very drinkable, in fact, I drank it quite fast. As the name implies, a session ipa and a decent one at that."
""
""
"Aroma is juicy citrus, tangerine and clementines. Fair head retention (for the style) and darker in color than expected (again, for the style). Flavor is citrus rind, coarse herbal hops (but restrained), and mild malt sweetness. Body is thin, but expected given the ABV (and the ""session"" IPA style). Finishes clean, prickly carbonation. Best ""session"" IPA tasted thus far. Founder's nailed the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Golden clear with white head.  Aromoa is grassy and citrus hop.  Starts up grassy hop, then sweetness, lemon orange bitter and a grassy finish and lingering orange bitter.  Slightly more carbonation than others."
""
"I actually like this beer better than some of Founders 'real' IPAs."
""
""
""
"Poured a clear amber body with a half finger bubbly white head. Fairly standard IPA appearance, quite nice, if not a bit simple. Scents of dank, earthy, herbal hops, vegetal hops with slight onion character, light tropical fruit and some citrus round out the aroma and there is a very light malt sweetness. Overall impression of aroma is of a big, hoppy beer with a good deal of powerful hop aromatics. Very nice. Flavor begins bitter, with notes of pine resin, herbal hops, dank, earthy hops and grapefruit peel. Middle opens up vegetal hop flavors and a stronger flavor of grapefruit and light floral hop flavors. Finish is bitter with notes of floral hops, grapefruit peel, citrus blossom and pine resin. Aftertaste is grapefruit peel and pine needles. Overall impression of flavor is of a very hops forward ale, wonderfully flavorful, with a degree of complexity from the numerous interacting hop flavors. As is typical for the session IPAs the malt is undetectable. Mouthfeel is light bodied and watery with medium-high carbonation and a slick, resinous feel. Overall impression. Of mouthfeel is of a hoppy light beer. Overall this is a good session IPA. Founders was one of the first to try to make a hoppy session beer, and while not quite as good as some that have come after, it is still a solid choice and a good, light, refreshing hop-forward beer."
"Great Session IPA, awesome in the summer time"
"This beer will one day be a legend!  From its amazing taste to its unique drink ability to the picture on the side of the can....this beer has got it all!"
""
""
"Tasty.  A nice balanced session IPA."
"Not something I can drink all day. Unless. Weird having an ipa with low apv"
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite of all time on a hot sunny day!!"
"So many really good IPA available for short money... This offering is only average at best."
"3/7/15 (Bottle) - Nice golden pour with light minimal head. Citrus and malt aroma pleasant and strong. Lemon and malt flavor very good and fun to drink. Carbonation noticeable, beer went down with a slight kick which I liked. Overall very good offering by a strong brewer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's one of those beers that you want to just sit back on the porch, relax and have a drink. It's very smooth and gentle while still having a lot of flavor."
""
"Nothing aggressive about this beer, but it's truly spectacular. My favorite thing to recommend to new craft drinkers."
""
"The best session ipa in my opinion. Fruity and hoppy on the nose but smooth taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good beer if you're in the mood for an IPA or if you prefer them. Has that standard hoppy taste with a smooth finish. Doesn't come with that after bite you get with a lot of other IPAs but is quite good"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by strong grapefruit. Taste is grapefruit, pine, a surprising level of bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall an enjoyable beer I could down several of with ease."
""
"Overall: This is a very serviceable IPA that doesn't blow you out of the room, but lets the flavor linger throughout.  A nicely balanced brew."
""
""
""
"My go to session beer and an all round great IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice for a session IPA! Well worth a try."
""
"Pretty good session IPA. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but the smell is excellently grapefruity and floral, and the taste has a nice grapefruit bitterness to it. I could drink this daily."
"Not too hoppy but the name doesn't disappoint, drink it all day!"
""
"Yes, definitely grapefruit smell and taste. The hops punch your tastebuds around. A little loud but its what you expect from an IPA. Nice mouthfeel. Overall not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably the best session IPA I've had."
""
"O: Overall tasty, refreshing, and something I could destroy on a hot summer day."
""
""
"Tastes like fresh cut grass clippings and I love it."
""
""
""
"This is a great IPA you can drink all day"
"The best Session IPA around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Barely an ipa. Does qualify as a lager"
""
"Faint copper color, more of a gold color. Hop smell is not over bearing and it went down smooth. Good session IPA. Probably closer to the top for the price. I'll buy this again."
""
""
"Overall:  This is one of the first ""Session"" IPA's that started a bad idea. In reality, these are over hopped pale ales and this one does not disappoint by being off balance. There is no malt backbone found in a good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good Session IPA, not watery at all, and the name speaks for itself.  Good session-able IPA."
"On tap poured into a pint glass.  A nice golden color, small half in. head on it that dissipated after a bit.  Nice honey and bread smell, good floral notes up front with strong hoppy after taste.  Real solid IPA.  Very enjoyable in a mild way."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a very well balanced, very tasty IPA.  And that’s coming from a guy who doesn’t typically like IPAs.  There are certainly some assertive hops in this beer, but it’s perfectly balanced with a huge malt backbone.  I’ll certainly drink this again!"
"This is a great session IPA."
""
"Definition of a session beer.  The name says it all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very solid beer. Toned down flavors, so perhaps an ""entry level"" IPA. Super drinkability and very sessionable. At 4.7% for an actually decent IPA, I'd say that's a success. You can keep up with your friends who drink mass produced beer without being the first one to puke on your own lap."
""
""
"One of my favorite session IPAs. Very citrusy and hoppy with a low alcohol content which allows one to enjoy ""all day"". My only complaint with this beer is I have noticed a touch of inconsistency with the taste of the beer from time to time. One of my favorite beers to have by the campfire in the summertime! Highly recommend!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love the taste of this beer and how it miss leads you thinking this is a high % beer. Def a great beer to just kick back and drink them all day!"
""
""
""
"One of my favorite beers.  Love the grapefruit flavor.  Perfect for a hot summers day."
""
""
""
"A sessionable beer has to be both low alcohol and light bodied, and I can't think of a more satisfying beer than this matching those descriptors."
""
""
""
"Of the 1/2 dozen or so session IPAs I've tried this is the best"
""
""
""
""
""
"meh not to sure about this"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was delicious. Most of the session IPAs I've tried did not have the flavor I've been looking for. This one was pretty spot on. Smells like weed. Has that cannabis-y flavor up front with a well balanced finish. Would drink again. And again. And, well you get the idea."
"Overall a solid session ipa would like a little more in the feel department but still like this beer great for a summer bbq"
""
""
""
""
""
"Average IPA. Very drinkable, so the name is true."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The name ""All Day"" IPA is quite accurate, this beer definitely packs the hops seasoned IPA drinkers love, but it's just a bit lighter on the hop and citrus side. Just enough to make this IPA not too bitter on the pallet over time, not tongue-numbing and quite sessionable."
"12oz bottle in standard pint glass. Slightly hazy golden color that projects a heavier beer than it is; virtually no head, only slight, fleeting lacing, visible carbonation; citrus scent; very dry, the citrus hop profile is the prominent taste, but bitterness from start to finish. Overall: A refreshing beer that beats most low ABV options and probably in the top-tier among session IPAs. Given how much I like Founders' offerings, I was hoping for more. (7.5)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good, sessionable IPA. I'm not an IPA fan, but I could see myself easily drinking a few of these in one sitting no problem. A highly drinkable IPA. Recommended for those who are just trying to break into the IPA style, or those who enjoy IPAs only occasionally."
""
""
""
""
""
"For a session, it's great! Light enough for anytime of day, yet it has a strong hop forward taste that packs a crisp, pine/floral punch.  Great outta the can...My go-to for the outdoors!"
""
"This is my go to beer and one that got me into the realm of IPAS."
"Had this right after a Victory 19 Anniversary Session IPA. This paled in comparison. This beer disappointed in everything but appearance as the color was a nice dark gold and had some lacing. Not a fan of session IPA's. If I want to have a few lower ABV beers, I'll drink some pilsners."
"Eh. Not bad, not great. Just average."
"Great floral aromas, a solid ipa that can be enjoyed ""all day."""
"Mediocre beer. Good in the summer. Like that it comes in cans. Eh"
""
""
"A very flavorful IPA for such a low ABV. Lacks the backbone of a true IPA and is a bit watery. This brew has a nice piney, citrusy flavor. If I was looking for a session IPA I think I prefer Stone levitation Ale to this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"It tastes great, low ABV, inexpensive, and comes in 15-packs in cans. My fridge is always stocked. If you haven't tried it yet, go for it."
""
""
""
"Although lower in ABV than most I take down, this is an outstanding IPA for such a low ABV. I could seriously get into drinking this more often and feel satisfied. Great beer and well done Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Disappointing for such a great brewery, especially one known for such strong beers like Dirty Bastard. No malt flavor makes the beer taste like hop steeped water."
"This is a solid IPA and I love the lower abv and lower malt.  It is no go to from stone which kills this one all day everyday but it's good."
""
""
"Typing out characters to rate as now required by this site."
""

"Love this for session and I'm not afraid to say it!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: While session IPAs are a very popular trend these days, I'm not entirely sold on this offering.  While the low-ABV package means you can enjoy a couple these beers in a single sitting, the flavors leave something to be desired, meaning I probably wouldn't drink more than one anyways.  Personally, I would like to see more balance and sweetness from the malts backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent IPA  not the best but def not the worst."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drank out of the bottle. Medium feel. Dry and hoppy. No trace of alcohol to taste. I liked it more than othe IPAs but I'm not super crazy about IPAs"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the best ipa i've ever had but definitely good, and for $15 for a 15 pack... it's what i'm usually drinking."

"Had this at an Italian restaurant with deep dish pizza.  I was surprised to find that it was only 4.7% ABV.  Too dark to judge color but excellent head retention with significant lacing.  The smell was mildly citrus with a hint of pine while the flavor was mostly citrus with malt in the background.  This really is a great session beer."

"for this ""session"" style this one is my favorite.  It holds up in the can & bottle far longer than it has a right to, always bright & citrucy thirst quencher that can go any where.  Have a few & not worry about getting filled up or too silly.  Great pick!"

"O-a drinkable IPA, lacking a punch"

"Best beer for canoeing! Delicious, dank, refreshing, and you can drink a ton of them! Comes in a can, so you shotgun em!"
""
""
"All day. All freakin day. Although the beer did not last all day with my friends, the 15 pack that I bought could have lasted one person all day. All in all, a pack of All Day's can last a person all day. Do not share."

"One of the best session ales I've had. Very light but packs a solid grapefruit, lemon-piney bitterness. Pretty balanced tho and the low abv makes for some serious crushability. Perfect summer/springtime beer."

""
""
"the bud light of IPAs"
"Pours a light golden orange.  Nose is grapefruit, citrus and grass.  Taste follows, balanced but hop forward.  Overall a solid everyday, sessionable ipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The perfect session ale."
""
""
"0: An enjoyable IPA for someone who isn't fond of IPAs. The corn flavor added depth to this beer, taking attention away from the hops."

"It's important to note that I don't think a 2.5 is a bad beer. It's not a good beer, but again, I wouldn't turn it down. If this beer didn't smell like it does, it would get a 3. I wouldn't buy it unless the other choices were adjunct lagers, and I couldn't reasonably get to another store or bar. I don't recommend this brew, and I'm glad I only bought one 12 oz. bottle of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Minty hop nose with fresh mown grass, some light grains. Brilliant gold with a slightly yellow tinted off-white foam cap. Fruity hops attack the palate joined by citrus and pale malt with a hint of sweetness finishing with a crisp bitterness. Medium body and carbonation."

"OVERALL: NOTHING about this IPA jumps out at you...EVERY Part of the Experience is ""OK"" but never GREAT......Would make for a Good ""Session Ale"" if you were planning on having 4 or 5. but If you are looking for a SPECIAL beer or a ""UNIQUE Drinking Experience""...this would NOT be it."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"All Day pours a light gold/hay/amber color with very little head. The nose has a nice balance of floral and pine hop aromas matched by a light, crisp mouthfeel. This beer is super balanced and sessionable, perfect for spending a summer day outside."

"Changing my rating from 4 to 2.75. All was well with this one until I bought a case of it in cans. Pretty sure ive had it in both can and bottle. Hoppy seltzer water is the best way to describe it. Stones Go To and Free Will Lower Case IPAs are better examples of 'session IPAs' in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's the one of the few IPAs that I can drink honestly,  everyday.  Drinkable, super drinkable.  Loads of flavor, lots of citrus little pine.  Amarillo and Centennial hops,  they are the ticket"

"This is a very drinkable beer.  It is the light version of Founder's Centennial.  It has a light hoppy presence, just enough to keep it interesting.  There is also some malt behind.  This beer is just not outstanding in any way, however with its lower alcohol content that you can drink all day...."
""
"Fizzy.  A bit stringent.  Does taste like an IPA. Hate to be harsh, but a really boring beer.  Bought a case (in cans) but I cant drink more than one at a time.  Def not an all day brew for m.e"
"O: Centennial Light. The ""lets do some day drinking"" beer for the IPA fan. Would I drink it again? Sure. Will I ever set out to drink it again? Nope. I would rather just get a case of Centennial and pace myself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When fresh and out of a can, this beer is addictive. The can is empty before I know it. I truly love it when it's on point. The problem is that you never know if it will be great or mediocre til you buy it."
""
"O:  OK, just nothing to write home about.  Stone's session IPA - Go-To IPA - is far, far better.  The latter has a similar but much more robust taste.  It also has a ton of carbonation that mitigates the light mouthfeel.  Not so with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Never poured it out of the can. Smells super piney. Tastes just the same. Just a touch of bitter. So easy to drink. Exactly what it says it is. I could drink these all day at the beach. I might even be able to talk some of my cheap beer drinking friends to try this. Wow an IPA that is not over the top and is ok with itself."

"Overall - A good session IPA, but does little to stand out from the rest of the pack. All seem to have bright citrus notes and not much else. If you're a West Coaster that can't get this, try Stone or Lagunitas Session IPAs to get a good sense for this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"I could drink a million of these at a baseball game. I mean for a 4.7abv beer its going to be watery. I find nothing wrong with this brew. This reminds me of Victory’s Headwaters, but the aroma is slightly better though. Citrus, resin, herbal tea, can’t go wrong. Perfect summer beer. Recommended."

"This is much less flavorful than many other IPAs, and I do understand this is necessary to achieve a ""session"" ale.  Average score is similar to Laguinitas IPA, but to me there is no comparison.  Because of this, I am unable to give this a higher rating unless this beer were moved to a different category."

"Im not big in to the session ipa trend. Id rather have something bolder, but with that being said this is by far the best session ipa I've ever had. So much hop flavor packed into that 4.7% abc. Great job founders!"

" Very clear, light bodied. Tons of pine and hops. It smelled like fresh cut grass or weeds to me. Tasted like the nose indicated. The low abv is very evident. If you are looking for a hoppy session to drink ""all day", this would certainly fit the bill. I will stick to DIPAs"

"I'm not giving this one a typical review, as I'm rating this one 5 across the board because I love an IPA that, like it's name, I can drink all day and love every since can/bottle. A session IPA to soothe the taste buds and not knock you out with a high alcohol content. Excellent aroma, even better taste, and I'm happy. So this one is right up my alley!"

"355ml bottle. BB 4/11/14. Pours a touch lighter than deep gold, slightly opaque, with a large frothy white head which quickly disappeared but left lovely lacing. Aroma of pine, paw paw and grapefruit. Medium bitterness in quite a pleasant sort of way. Very restrained. Medium body, smooth texture and a lingering bitter finish. Very sessionable."

"First taste was served on tap at a July 4th fundraiser picnic. Served in plastic, disposable 16 ounce cups. While the serving didn't allow a complete feel for the beer, the citrus nose caught my attention. The beer's lighter body made it a worthy, refreshing accompaniment to the BBQ. Since then,I have had it served in both 12 oz bottle and can. Both of these servings were equal with no difference in qualities of the beer. A: golden color, poured a moderate head. (Bottle served in a pint glass and can was poured in an white wine glass). Smell: citrus nose (refreshing). Taste: citrus, grapefruit up front. Mild bitter finish. Mouthfeel: effervescent, no heavy hop after taste. Overall, I enjoyed this beer."

"Okay I am not a huge fan of IPA beers. Most I don't like but this Founders All Day IPA is good. It has a bitter taste like all IPA's but its not super bitter like most are. It has a light body, even though it isn't a light beer, and is average in beer calories so its very easy to drink. I don't like how you get a choice of both bottles and cans. It kind made me skeptical at first since it was offered in a can but every Founders beer I had so far was good. The cost was decent at $18 for a 15 pack of cans. Bottom line if I want an IPA this will be my first choice."
""
""
"O: I'm not the biggest fan of these ""session IPAs"" but Founders has brewed a tasty little beverage here. It's light enough to drink all day/night, but it packs enough flavor to keep the hopheads satisfied. This may not find its way into my fridge often, but it'll definitely find its way into my cooler at a BBQ."

"Took this bad boy out to a Saturday BBQ recently, and was glad to do so. I wanted a beer with more taste than a domestic that I could really drink ""all day"" without ruining my Sunday. This beer did the trick. All Day is a true session that gives you a nice IPA taste, but to me it really comes off as ""IPA lite"" (which was great for the occasion). Not quite as much initial pungency as Lagunitas' DayTime, but pick your poison I guess. I had em' both on the same day. I'd probably give DayTime the nod if I had to choose, but that's really a matter of preference. I'm partial to a good hop kick in the mouth. Overall, All Day is perfect for what the name implies."

"Pours gold with a yellow tint and an off white head. Aroma provides a nice hit of some hop oils, citrus, and pine with a touch of toast as well. Flavor follows suit. A light, crisp, mouthfeel. Overall, hands down the best session IPA I have discovered and one of my favorite IPA's of any strength too. I have never been into session IPA's in the past, finding the label ""hop water"" generally quite accurate, but Founders found a way to not have make any sacrifices in the malt department to brew this beer. Fantastic stuff."

"I know that I have a profound aversion to Simcoe hops - it astounds me that there are people in the world who like them - and All Day is Simcoe-heavy. But AD is a blend of Simcoe and Amarillo hops. I have to assume that I detest Amarillo hops just as much. For me, this is the worst of both worlds."
""
""
""
""
"All Day IPA means all day. Smooth drinking IPA great for summer day drinking and casual consumption. Not overly strong but enough flavor that you can always have another. Other IPA's have much stronger and deeper taste but also can't have too many. This is the IPA that can battle the light beers for tailgate supremacy."

"Overall- First time I had this it was way too dry and just lacked flavor to me, but after revisiting this since last summer this tastes much better to me. One dimensional with the citrus, but it works and makes for a great session ipa. I can't put this in the 4 range because it simply lacks the flavor and depth of other regular ipa's that Ive had. That being said this is going on my go-to summer list, and with a 15 pack/12 pack price setup this will be hard to not repurchase again and again. (88/100)"

"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a thin off-white head. Aromas of pineapple, and a hint of pine. The flavors start with some grapefruit rind, then a hint of biscuity malt, and finishing with a pounding of pine flavor. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Overall a good session beer, though I would prefer a bit more citrus and less pine personally."

""

"O-I really like this beer for a lighter alternative to the IPA. Nice hop quality in something that you can drink several of while camping, etc. without getting too crazy. I hope it can be available for less than the price of regular IPA, as I think a lot of breweries our using this session IPA trend to gouge their customers. Fewer hops, less malt, less price."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus fruit and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty, light, and easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Ill be the first to admit that I don't get the ""session IPA"" style. Isn't that what a pale ale is? Anyways, I appreciate that they can pull bold flavors with as little abv as my PBR. But I'd rather have a few regular IPAs or IIPAs with more flavor than a bunch of these, especially for the price. I will consider buying this again if I really do need to drink a low abv without sacrificing flavor. As far as All Day vs. Go To goes, I was blown away with Go To compared to this. More bright fruit flavor and less malt. The date was rubbed off on this bottle, so I will have to reevaluate a confirmed fresh one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an enjoyable beer. With 4.7% ABV and a light body it is very sessionable. If I wanted to sit down and have one beer - this would not be it (I'd go for something a little heavier). But after a hard day in the sun one or two of these would be nice."

"Poured into a wide chalice: this is a medium-gold, clear beer with a slight but solid head. The aroma is really packed with citrusy hops, lemon-grapefruitish! The flavor packs a strong bitterness up front, together with loads of citrus hop flavor. Malt doesn't really come into play at all. In fact, I'd be somewhat dubious about this beer, since the body is so light and there's no malt presence, except I realize it's supposed to be an IPA that's quaffed and enjoyed by volume, and as such, it fills a welcome niche. Heck, I might even drink the rest of this six-pack straight from the bottle, out in the garden. Drinkability gets A++."

"O: I get it, they are going for a lower alcohol beer, but 4.7% is considered too high to be in the alcohol free category, so its considered an American IPA. Its got all the flavor of an ipa, but in this category where its not the best beer, but still solid. So it feels like a compromise in my opinion, and I would consider it a regular beer as far as alcohol. Nice to have the excuse of having it in the day though, so I’ll buy that."
""
""
"Good Job !!!A very nice session ale that pours a nice head that slowly disappears over time. Smell bites a little with fruit, possibly grapefruit or orange??. Hop flavor is nice but yearned afor a little more after smelling it. Nice brew, done well, and definitely worthy of drinking plenty more of these, especially as the weather warms!!"

"Pours a slightly straw color with some haze, with thick head of white creamy foam. Nose is delightfully aromatic with loads of herbal, grassy hop notes with some pine & citrus. Palate is surprisingly light to medium bodied, noticeably drinkable right away, yet follows through nicely with a good full flavored balance of herbal hops, citrus tang, and light cracker-like malt. Good drinkability, refreshing, yet flavorful."

"This is my favorite IPA right now. It has a very sharp flavor and is obviously very hoppy, but well balanced. I really like that it is a session beer so it is lower in alcohol, making it more enjoyable to drink multiple because a lot of IPAs right now are fairly high in ABV."
""
""
""
"Overall: I prefer higher percentage beer, but overall it is very enjoyable."
""
""
"I've been enjoying Session IPAs of late and was looking forward to having this one purchased on a recent road trip to Michigan. Nice bitterness, pleasant aroma but perhaps a little weaker in overall flavour than I've had in other offerings in this style. Overall, a good example of the style that I would purchase and drink again. More proof to my tastebuds that one cannot go wrong with an offering from Founders."
"O - This has turned into my go to session ale and I actually like to drink it more out of the can that from the bottle. Huge flavor and juicy drinkability in this brew."

""

"Well done, Founders! You've produced just about the perfect summer beer for people who like good beer. Taste, drinkability and price! Bravo!"
""
""

"Light amber color. Pours out with a rich thick head that that lasts several minutes, but interestly leaves little lacing. Relatively low in alcohol. Nothing remarkable other than its lightness, making it enjoyably refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very mediocre beer in my opinion. It does what they want it to do - it's an IPA you can plow through all day because of low ABV - but it's really boring. It seems like a stab at a pale ale / IPA hybrid and I think it would be better if they'd committed to one or another. It could serve as a good ""bridge"" beer to help folks move from pales to IPAs, so it's not without value."
"DRINKABLE. A great summer beer. Lower alcohol and a crisp refreshing feel make for an IPA that can be grabbed one after another from a cooler. Pine, fruit hops, grapefruit and a hint of strawberry, and just a touch of a bitter aftertaste remind you that you are drinking an IPA. Get this for your summer BBQ. Everyone should be happy."
"Smell is good, fruity with some hop aroma. Taste is also good, not outstanding but a nice balance with some definite citrus flavors. Overall, this beer is pretty good and I'll give it a try again."

"O: Overall I am disappointed. There is a clear hop difference when comparing to Stone Go To, specifically in the aroma, which makes sense of Go To's 65 IBUs vs. All Day's 42 IBUs. I do get more of a maltiness the Go To which makes this easier to drink as time goes on. And in that case, All Day becomes the better session, while Go To is clearly the better IPA."

"Pours a golden yellow orange with a small white head. Aroma is grapefruit, citrus floral hops and some grass notes. Taste is mostly citrus hops with a very tangy grapefruit note, some biscuit malt makes it way thru along with some fresh cut grass. Palate is a medium body, light crisp mouth feel with mild carbonation. This brew is seems to be a bit on the citus hops and tangy grapefruit side with some grass notes and a bit of biscuit malt. Overall its a still a good drinking session brew."

"this beer is good for what it's meant for: a tasty, refreshing yet flavorful beer, and out of a can, it's a go to, easy to grab, great when fresh and cold and right outta the can. I prefer it that way. its not really big or complex, just a great beer to hang out and drink, got a 15pk of cans"
""
""
""
"Pours out to a frothy white head that laces erratically but thickly. Color is a dirty deep golden. Aroma presents with a tangy, piney, spicy, herbal hop character and slight pale grains. Flavor is very much like any other IPA with strong hop flavors and very little malt character. Bitterness is appropriate to the gravity, although a bit skewed toward alpha acids. Mouthfeel is similar to domestic lagers, light, airy and crisp. Overall, this is a beer that defies its low gravity. Having been introduced to the style in Oklahoma brewpubs who had to improvise on the 4% abv limit they had to work within, I knew American IPA can be credibly done without the 6%+ abv. It takes getting used to (for me, again), but the upshot is that you get the same satisfying hop rush but you can drink this stuff all session long and still have your wits about you."

"It's refreshing to have an enjoyable IPA that doesn't overpower the taste buds with an aggressive hop finish. This offering by Founders is appropriately named a ""session ale"" because I'm ready to pour another freshy."

"O: As an IPA, this would be a one-time beer for me. As a ""Session IPA," it really does manage to hit all the notes while keeping the ABV low."

"Overall: I loved it and would drink it as a go to daily beer. In fact, I might just do that with St. Patrick's Day coming up in Savannah, Georgia in a week!"

"I could drink this beer all day. Hey!!! I think that's what Founder's had in mind. One of the most deliciously refreshing beers I've ever had. Perfect for a hot day by the pool. Won't get you too smashed either. Really a very solid, well balanced IPA. Citrus notes, pleasant bitter finish. I honestly can't think of a better beer to accompany you while mowing the lawn or on a trip to the beach."

"O Its a good IPA, I like that is session able however Its too expensive for what it is. Also its got a fair amount of body so while consumption is easier then most IPAs its harder then your average AAL, this makes it a bit more work to catch a buzz, although this could be seen as a positive for some I suppose."

"OVERALL: This is a very good IPA and I would but it again. It's low in alcohol (4.7%) compared to most IPA's I've tried which means I can enjoy more of it. The name is very fitting because you could drink this all day while fishing. This is the second beer I've had from Founders. They have yet to disappoint me."

"Wow, an excellent beer that I'd never heard of before. Of course, there's lots of beers that fit that qualification, probably. A bit of pine, didn't detect or miss lemon, worked well with the jalapeno-spiced food that I enjoyed with the beer. Clear and pleasantly deep golden color, with no hint of malt. A quality IPA, and one that I will look for and drink again (next time in warmer weather)."
""
""
""
"sports a lightly-spicy hop bitterness that packs a soft punch.... tastes kind of like grapefruit or orange sparkling Pellegrino, lacking a good bit of that malt backbone and undercurrent of alcohol that I've come to associate with US IPAs.... super-light body for an IPA (reminds me of some comparable lower-gravity UK ""IPA""s).... not sweet in the least, in fact, it's pretty bone dry.... crazy drinkable to those who enjoy the flavors of an American IPA, but want something lighter and 'sessionable'.... what it offers in drinkability is unique, though the overall taste is relatively familiar"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a fairly well regarded brew, and at 4.7 ABV you could certainly drink a ton of it. It is pretty good, but only a can and a summer day would warrant its use, IMO. Far better than BMC for that purpose."

"Figured I would give this one a go... I had heard from multiple friends that it is a great session IPA. Anyway, got a growler fill of it. Looks OK in the glass, pretty much what you would expect a session IPA to be, very low on the SRM chart with a generous amount of carbonation. First impression on the nose was extremely more skunky than expected... almost smelled like B.O. Taste is overwhelmingly B.O. I hate to say it, but this one was a drain pour. In fact, it was so bad that I had to go grab some bottles at the local shop to see if it was just a bad keg. Nope. Bottles had the exact characteristics all around."

"Only thing: So DRINKABLE!"

"Overall - This is a fantastic IPA. This has been my go to beer for the last two outings of a fishing weekend that involves playing long sessions of Texas Hold' Em. Everyone else at the table thinks I'm drinking a 8-9% DIPA and they are drinking 5% Buds. so I think I have a leg up on them."

"After pouring into a glass, this beer just looks great. Light golden hue with a decent head. I was a bit wary when the smell hinted at too much citrus but the actual taste was great. Low alcohol gives the ingredients a nice venue to be shown off. I loved the hopes with hints of grapefruit but not being overpowered by it. It was just so nice to have a flavorful yet clean IPA. Any downside this beer has is that it feels a little light, like with the flavor there should be more character to the beer. Overall I was very impressed and would definitely recommend."

"Nice to see lower alcohol IPAs making more of a showing in the market. Sometimes I just want something a little lighter, but with flavor. This is one of the better ones- particularly when very fresh. when you a lovely floral hop aroma and flavor- delicate, but definitely flavorful. It does fade fairly quickly on the shelf, so freshness is key. A nice option."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: All Day IPA is a pretty straightforward IPA. The hops are not as wild as other varieties but they pack a clean, fresh punch that makes this beer enjoyable to drink. I would say this is a textbook example of a ""weekend beer""."

"O. Great IPA.i love balanced IPAs, this is one of them"

"Golden-amber pour, clear, with a bubbly white head that receded to a ringlet; dots of lacing on the glass. Basic aroma of citrus pith and distant biscuity malts. Similar taste, a biscuity malt base overlaid with citrusy, pithy hops, mild but lasting bitterness. Nothing new here, but nothing wrong with that. Light-medium body, and easily drinkable, good for the summertime. Sessionable? Sure, it's nice and goes down easily. But I'll take a Centennial or a Double Trouble over this any day."

"A simple beer all around. Pours a nice golden amber color with a decent head that sticks around for a nice amount of time. Smells of your typical IPA elements; grapefruit and pine. The taste though is very simple. There is a forward push of hops and citrus notes but very little behind it. The initial taste is very enjoyable but quickly turns to a bitter, astringent flavor that is vaguely reminiscent of(what I can only describe as) feline urine. Its not a horrible beer but definitely not what I expect from a brewery like Founders. Would purchase again only in a pinch."

"Overall: a particularly good example of the American IPA style. Plenty of hops up front with just enough presence from the malts and warming alcohol to round it out. At AU$75 a case of 24 x 355mL (2013) it is better value than plenty of less impressive options."

"Just a few short comments for this AIPA. I will start off by saying, look at the name. All Day IPA. A session ale. I think Founder's hit a homerun on this one. This brew has all the points of any other mainstream India Pale Ale, but in a softer, chuggable format, due to lower ABV. I drink mine straight from the can, anytime, anywhere it's viable. Heck, even the can looks chill and relaxing. I can't imagine anyone who enjoys IPA's to say this is not exactly what the can says. If you go in expecting Pliny the Elder, you will be disappointed. BUT, if you go in expecting BMC lager, you will be pleasantly surprised and wearing a nice smile all day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Lower alcohol and with less hop bitterness than other IPA, All Day IPA is exactly the type of beer you would expect. No, it isn’t going to satisfy the extreme hop cravings many of us have, but it is good when you want to taste some hops but want the hops kept in check. Founders actually did a good job balancing out this beer and making it just hoppy enough to satisfy and just light enough to make it good for everyday consumption. It’s another winner from one of America’s best breweries."
""
"Pours a clear gold color with a small light tan head. The smell is a huge tropical fruit and citrus head - juicy stuff. Taste is tart citrus with a bit of tropical backing ending a bit dry with just a little bitterness. Light body with fairly active carbonation."
" I think it's Founder's best (i)PA."
"I tried FounderS ALL DAY IPA lat week for the 1st time, and I'm a big fan. I returned to the store the next day, and bought 12 more. 4.7% alc , but you can't tell by the taste. It has a wonderful golden color with not much fuz after the pour. Kind of an orangey, pine flavor, and smell. Not as heavy as most ipa, and I guess that's why they call it a Session Ale."
""
""
""
""
"One whiff and the olafactory senses are bombarded with pine needles.The palate is brushed with mild motes of pineapple that sucumb to a toasted conclusion. The star is the mouthfeel, crisp and clean. Nothing to overwhelm, but one that could be taken for granted. The perfect sessional craft that completely destroys the infuriating myth that a beer has to have a high alcohol content to be great. Leave it to Founders to end this nonsense: the Beer World's equivalent to the 9/11 Truthers."
""
"Overall: Since this is intended as a session beer, I think Founders crafted another masterpiece here. I could drink this one all day and still get a good hop fix without descending too far down the inebriated rabbit hole. Great that it's offered in cans too, as this could be a quintessential tailgate beer for craft beer nerds."
""
""
"A great session IPA, especially for the ABV. Grapefruit dominates with a light pale malt base. It's crisp and clean and you could drink this all day... get it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would have to say it is perfect for what it is. A session ale and nothing more. It gives off some good flavors, stays light and clean, and served ice cold it is extremely refreshing. Again, it's excellent for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I'd buy this by the truckload if it was available to me locally. It might just be the perfect beer for me, something I can drink a lot of based on the ABV and lots of hoppy scent/flavour. I'll buy more the next chance I get."
"Overall - A very rewarding IPA that maintains carbonation and it's plentiful flavors throughout - perfect for a spring or summer day!"
""
""
"A decent beer by Founders but I am a bit disappointed with this particular beer. I expected more from Founders as usually I am not disappointed by their beer. Appearance light in color is good but the taste is a little flat from what i expected the smell of hops in great but that is the extent of my feeling towards this beer."

"This beer is amazing! Throws down the gauntlet for what a drinkable, clean full of flavor beer should be. All day indeed. Good job Founders. Awesome, awesome beer. Do not miss it. Buy it when you see it."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled on 9/23/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light bread, light honey, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of citrus/tropical hops with a fair amount of malt balance; and good strength. Taste of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, orange zest, lemon zest, floral, grass, light pine, light honey, light bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, mango, floral, grass, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity of citrus/tropical hop flavors with a fair amount of malt balance; with good flavor robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.7%. Overall this is a highly excellent session IPA! All around great complexity and robustness of citrus/tropical hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Pours dark gold with a medium very persistent rocky head. Smell is huge grapefruit hops. Taste is much the same as the smell. Big grapefruit hops and little else. I think it's a nice smell but for the flavor it needs more malt to add some backbone. Unbalanced. This is why IPA's typically have higer ABVs. Medium to light bodied and very well carbonated. Very drinkable but overall the concept isn't working too well for me. I like the idea of hoppy session beer. But maybe this is a little too hoppy or a little too weak."
""

"Citrus to the max. Clean, snappy and juicy, though a little thin, but that's to be expected, and delivers a solid dose of C hops (though not as many as the nose promises, tbh.) Not quite hoppy enough to compete with some IPAs, which is reflected in the taste score, but impressive for the strength, which is shown in the overall."
""
""
""
""
"All Day IPA represents one of the new session IPAs that I've encountered over the last couple of years. It slides right down. Definitely a good alternative if you're not in the mood for a lager but you want to get your drink on. Very grassy on the nose and in taste. Perfect amount of hops for the purpose."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Another so-so delving into the world of hamstrung IPAs, all under the guise of sessionability. Why can't the alcohol be reduced, without sacrificing the sassy, isolated bitterness? This trend seems worthy of investigation, at the very least as a corrective construct."
""
"Taste is nicely crisp and bitter, refreshing. Definitely a session ale. Mouthfeel is light, slightly sticky. Overall, not bad at all."

"For a session ipa this is great. It should defiantly be a 90 or above on ba score. Notes of citrus and grass. A little light in the body but that should be expected for 4.7 abv.

"The palate opens with a moderate bitterness, more than I was anticipating and for a beer this low in ABV, quite appropriate. My beef with most ""session IPAs"" is that the beers don't have enough of a bittering hop addition, making them feel rather watery. Not this one, though - with a pleasant bitterness with some welcome resin, the palate follows up with flavors of citrus and mango. Grapefruit peel bitterness lingers on the finish. There is a touch of malt, a little bit of biscuit and honey, that wonderfully counters the bitterness. Light in body with crisp carbonation, this beer is hands down one better low ABV hoppy beers I've had recently."
""
""
""

""

"Poured to a tan head with moderate retention and lacing. Appearance was a golden honey, slight haze. Aroma was hoppy with citrus, pine and grain mixed in. Nice taste with strong hop and citrus on the front with a little malt on the back. Mouthfeel was light, almost water like, with a grain aftertaste."
""
""
""
"The Crack was music to mine ears and I was anxious to get started so I employed an inverted Glug to kick things off. I ended up with a massive two fingers of foamy, rocky eggshell-white head with decent retention. Color was a beautiful amber (SRM = between 9 and 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was VERY pine-y and I had to glance at the ABV to remind myself that it is a sessionable beer. Mouthfeel was kind of thin and watery for the style, but if that is the trade-off between taste and low ABV, I will take it without complaint. The taste was more muted than what the nose had led me to expect and it actually had a very mellow tea-like quality on the tongue. Finish was equally mellow and slightly hypnotic. I felt like I was ready for a nap."
""

"This a solid IPA with an easy drinking quality about it that could satisfy a number of palates."

"This beer is great for what it is. You wont find many session ales with this much flavor. With a nice piney citrus scent, and a slightly hoppy bitterness over your pallet you cant go wrong. Take it wherever your just trying to drink socially and have yourself a time. Cheers (had it in a can so I cant comment on the appearance)"

"This is a great beer for what it is. Smell is dominated by hops (obviously) with citrus. Taste starts off with ambiguous citrus and tea flavors, lending to a distinct grapefruit flavor and leaving a dry grapefruit finish. There's not a ton of complexity nor is there much malt balance, but it tastes great [even] without the bite from the high ABV of most IPAs. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, which is necessarily for this to be a ""session beer", but it isn't too thin and the carbonation is kept in check, making this mouthfeel, while not generally what I prefer, to be successful. It's not fair to compare this to the average IPA when it doesn't aim to be. If you're looking for a lower alcohol IPA that still has plenty of flavor, this is a pretty good choice"
""
"Overall - Not my favorite hop profile, but it's a very well made beer. This wouldn't be impressive if it weren't so small."

"Overall it is a solid pale ale, but my main problem is that it's not an IPA! As I am rating to style and this just doesn't meet the expectation I have when something is listed as an American IPA, I can't give this any better of a rating. My other problem with this is the price. It costs just as much as Centennial IPA, Founders Porter, and Dirty Bastard. At this price I don't see why I would ever buy this again when other good pale ales are being sold for cheaper."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Disappointing for such a great brewery, especially one known for such strong beers like Dirty Bastard. No malt flavor makes the beer taste like hop steeped water."

"Pours a clear gold with one finger thick white head, spotty lacing. Smell: big grapefruit stank, herbal, pine, light apricot note in back. Taste: citrus rind, herbal, peach tea, spicy and rindy finish. Feel is light, a little too slick. Still tasty and refreshing."

"I have had All Day in a bottle and on tap. It has a sunset color to it and the aroma is fantastic. I'm not much of an IPA drinker but what I have realized is the IPA i do like are more floral. This is one of them. I had it on tap and now I have picked it up for ""all day"" events time and time again. Great IPA!"

"When I poured this into a glass, it has a burnt orange color body with a small foamy head that quickly disappears. The aroma has is of floral hops, very pungent. The taste is of floral and bitter hops. Has a nice bite to it. The mouthfeel is very nice and overall another good one from founders."

"Incredibly drinkable with great flavor and aroma. The low alcohol content is remarkable considering how much hop taste they are able to maintain. Great finish with no butter lag. I have also had on tap with similar, but surprisingly less stellar, flavor. My current bottle favourite."
"Dark Yellow color. Little to no head. Very hoppy smell. Fruity will a crisp odor. A light and fruity taste with the familiar IPA finish. Very hoppy aftertaste. I like it a lot. It's low in alcohol as far as IPA's go but it still tastes like an IPA. Very crisp and complex. Good beer."

"O: I think Founders is a great brewery but this one really disappointed me. The SingleCut 18Watt I compared this to (or say a Hill Farmstead Edward) both are state of the art in terms of a sessionable IPA and the comparison was night and day. Maybe the bottle was too old? I dunno, but another reason to buy local I reckon..."

"Body feels a little watery."
"I guess the syntax of most of my sentences in this review tells most of the story: I like the beer, but--you can't get far with praising (or criticizing) this beer without saying 'but'. Let me just say that I don't regret picking up an entire 6 pack and leave it at that."

"I would definitely buy this beer again, it's a great standby when you want something simple, with some flavor, that doesn't break the bank, that you can share with other non-beer-snobs."
""
"Bottle dated 6/3/2013 so this was about seven weeks old when I drank it. Still hoppy! Aroma was distinct hops, pine, citrus. Flavor was nice and hoppy still, citrus and a strange fuzziness that I got from Lagunitas Daytime IPA. Super easy to drink although at 4.7% I wouldn't quite call this a session beer, maybe at 4.2%. Perfect candidate for cans and I'll be picking up some or trading when they hit shelves."
""
""
"Overall, quite good. A really good job at brewing a flavourful yet low alcohol pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Of course this pales in comparison to many other IPAs or DIPAs but this is for a different time and place and I'd say it delivers on its purpose as being an all day IPA. There's just the right balance of flavor and wateriness that makes this very drinkable. I look forward to giving this a go at the next barbecue."

"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with tall, long lasting, foamy white head. Wonderful aroma is of citrusy hops, tropical fruit and bready malt. Body is full and tangy. Citrusy hops dominate the flavor with bready malt and ripe fruit provide balance. Finish is long and grapefruity. I could drink this IPA all day."

"This is a sessionable IPA by all means it pours a golden hazed hue with a one finger head that stays and leaves a rim of lacing the smell is straight out pineapple and citrus with a hit of pine,the mouthfeel is light bodied but for an all day beer it makes total sense and has tastes of pineapple first up which is very prolific followed by a smack of fresh citrus intertwined with a small cameo of toffeeish malts and the cameo Is short but just like the name says its an all day IPA and to be honest funnily enough I could drink it all day cheers."
""
"O: Overall, like every other Founders beer I've ever had, the brewers achieved what they were setting out to create: a low ABV session IPA. I could easily drink a 6 of these in one sitting, and have. It is a great beer to drink on the beach due to the low ABV. Nicely done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I'm torn with this one. I want to like it bc its created by one of my favorite breweries, but I just don't session beer. If I drink a brew its with a meal or during my down time. It'd be great on a hot summer day or for those looking to session a hop forward brew. It definitely has some qualities and accomplished what they were going for with this ipa. Also may be something for people to use as a good introduction to hops. It has a place in the craft beer world, I'm just not sure itll find its way into my rotation that often."

"Session IPA is not one of my favorite styles. This one is middle of the road in a sub-par style. I can drink it, but I wouldn’t pursue it."

"All I got from this was some piney hops and that's it. No complexity at all to round out the beer."

"Pretty good clarity and a fairly minimal head. Light golden color with good carbonation. Pine like hop aroma with some biscuity malt following. Lots of flavor from the pine like hops. Hard to believe it is only 4.7%! Very smooth mouthfeel. Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color ale with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus and floral hops is quite nice and refreshing. Taste is also dominated by clean crisp citrus notes with nice floral undertones. Malt is present with a fuller body then I was expecting considering the ABV. Nice refreshing hoppy IPA with low ABV – there should be more of those out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"Overall as the name suggests this is an IPA you could enjoy all day. Isnt going to knock you down after a sixer but wont take it easy on your taste buds. Perfect for the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I like everything about this beer but the price. It's definitely a great brew to drink on a summer afternoon, but at 4.7% alcohol, a 6 pack isn't going to last you nearly as long as a higher abv, more flavorful 6-pack that you can purchase for 9.99."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A bit disappointing. Nice hop character but the lack of any malt backbone make it too thin and watery, even for a session beer."
""
""
"As good as double jack which I love but a very different taste. It's hard to describe but I would say a strong fruit flavor rather than pure hops. Founders brewery never disappoints and I look forward to trying more from their collection. One of the best beers for the price. Could certainly be called a session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I am not an IPA fan so this review might be slighted a bit. It is definitely true to style as a good ""session ale"" that you can surly drink more than 1. I would call this a good ""gateway ipa"" for someone looking to get into this style."

"D- definitely a session ipa. Easy drinking and easy abv but still with plenty of flavor."
""
"Probably my favorite beer from Founders. The color is a medium amber and is nearly perfect in its appearance and invites you to drink it. You can taste the hops immediately, but they do not over power your mouth. It reminds me of taking a deep breath of pine needles and being able to taste it. It isn't bitter and it doesn't fill you up. A great beer for summer, which is the intent. A shame summer doesn't last longer in these parts."
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured into Sam Adams pint glass. Pours a golden copper color. First smell was pineapple and grapefruit, also floral and grassy notes. Taste is citrus, grapefruit, nice flavorful hops. As it warmed got more of a malt base. Mouthfeel was light, yet balanced and refreshing. Overall, a great sessionable IPA and easy drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All day IPA pours a frosty copper color, with a very small head. Their is a strong malty/hoppy floral aroma mixed, very unique. The taste is much of the same strong sharp maltyness, with strong floral bites. Very full flavors, nice strong body. Overall its not bad, very unique, maltier then other IPAS."
"Pours a clear, light, amber color with a finger width foamy head.  There is very little head retention and very little lacing.  Has a fresh, grapefruit aroma.  Slightly piney.  Has a nice, hoppy, bitterness up front.  Somewhat peppery.  There is a grapefruit taste all the way through with a spicy bitterness at the end.  Good sessionable IPA.  I just wish it was a little less peppery.  That won't stop me from drinking it, though."

"O: I think the beer has good hop flavor and aroma, which is what you're really looking for in a beer like this. I'm not a fan of these particular flavor choices, but it's good in a pinch when looking for a hop fix. It's also nice to have the option of having a beer with this low of ABV. For that fact alone, I could see myself buying a few of these."

"O-nice balanced beer, definitely more of a pale ale than an ipa, then again its a ""session"" ipa"
""
""
""
""
"Poured a golden body with foamy, lively head thanks to some good carbonation and lace all around. Love the balance of the light citric and piney hop aroma, possibly some grape although I can't really detect it more than a whiff, and a good caramel, bready malt backbone. Nice to see a classic, not overly hoppy or alcoholic IPA, still being made. The hops, citric, pine, touch of spice, are there for hopheads but the beer is mellow, easy to drink, and just downright smooth and wellbalanced with a good sweetness and finishes clean and crisp. As the name implies just an easy going beer that one could session all day (particularly nice on a hot, humid summer day)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is ""sessionable", so the name fits. To me it's more of a hoppy pale ale than a traditional American IPA. A nice beer with a moderate abv."
"Watery at the start and through the middle, the body fills in just at the swallow ending up medium. Carbonation is medium plus. For an IPA it is rather less biting than most though not smooth as I cannot bring myself to describe any IPA that way (save a double/imperial). Well named, I could easily drink several of these throughout the day. Sadly, I only have two."

It's a tasty IPA that doesn't have the overpowering delicious hop taste that's hard (for many, not all) to session with. Sessionable with lot's of excellent flavor!"

"O - This isn't the most full-flavored IPA, but it isn't supposed to be. In fact, it comes across as good, if not better, than much higher ABV IPAs. My first sip, I was disappointed, until I remembered it's 4.7%; every sip thereafter just got better and better. A very solid beer, all the way to the bottom of the glass."
""
"The flavor matches the aroma--it's more citrus rind than malty, but there is some sweetness that is quite subtle. Full bodied but the carbonation is elevated as well."
""
""
"I need this in my life. summer beer is usually so boring in the name of sessionability, and steers away from the hops I love. this one does not. its bright golden and clear with an inch or so of white head. the nose is gorgeous cut grass and citra hops, or something similarly fruity, with big grapefruit notes and a touch of lemon peel. the flavor is the same, lighter malt body, big bold hop flavor that avoids being overly bitter, but packs in just a ton of fresh hop flavor. it really in a brilliant brew, and the 4.7% is just about right, as the name suggests, for all day drinking. perfectly carbonated with aggressive bubbles, light but not watery on the body, and clean and refreshing in the finish. it wouldn't be quite sturdy enough for me during colder months, but this time of year I can think of very few beers I would rather get into. I like it ice cold right from the bottle the best, preferably on the boat. a beer drinkers summer beer. my mouth waters for this when its fresh and freezing, and there is nothing better on the golf course."
""
""
""
"Pretty good, but unbalanced. It looks OK, and the hoppy aroma is fantastic - tons of delicious fruity notes. The taste is less rounded; plenty of aroma hops but a weak malt presence that doesn't even out the flavour. Thin, watery body. A decent IPA with good hop character, but lacking in it's other qualities. Could use improvement. However, still worthy of sampling if you come across it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very nice refreshing IPA, to be enjoyed on a nice relaxing sunny, warm day."
""
"O- So much better than Lagunitas Daytime, especially in the aroma department."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great nose, but the beer is a little light for my tastes. I see where they are going with a hoppy lawnmower, but all the hops makes this more of a slower sipper rather than a refreshing drink. Glad I got it, I'll enjoy the 6 pack but I think I'll move on to other beers."
""
"Overall: An excellent example of the session IPA style. I could see myself drinking this beer on a hot day and getting a lot of the things I like in an IPA without too much body or overkill in the hop department. Somehow though, the taste, aroma, and mouthfeel seem a little at odds with each other."
"Not on board really with the session IPA thing, this one wasn't too bad, though."
""
""
""
"Pours a little cloudy, yellow with a thin head and no retention. No lace, a little yeast floating on top. It doesn’t look like much. The nose is big. Crisp with citrus, spice, tangerine, hay , floral and a even a little lemon. Good pine and resin. There’s a touch pale malt and only a very little bread. Some caramel sweetness as it opens up. Catty as it warms. Taste is really terrific for a very light beer. This has a low abv but it smells and tastes like a big beer. Citrus and floral. The hops pronounce the drink delicious and and stay with it all the way through. There is a just a little grain and bread and a decent bitterness. Some yeast and sour grapefruit. Body is a little thin and has brisk carbonation.Slightly bitter and slightly dry in the finish. This is a good session beer just like it promises. Low in alcohol so you can drink it all day and low in calories too. Has plenty of flavor and was satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Particularly good in the sun with a smooth and bitter taste that is loaded with citrus and backed up with some tropical fruits. A beer that goes down quite well and made for easy drinking, definitely worth a try."

"It's a lightly toasted golden raisin with a solid sheet of fine whipped toasted cream foam atop. Smells of resin, pine, some grain and a little metal. Nice and assertively hoppy on the nose, has what I consider a classic PNW smell. Flavor follows suit with resin, pine and some body oder...Maybe a bit of grapefruit pith and a solid amber like malt character with a bit of biscuit. Medium bodied with slightly soft carb and an off dry finish. The beer reminds me of Bitter American from 21st Amendment, and since it's on the shelves around me, and canned, it would be my go to over this one. Good though."
""
""
"O: Good, not great. As much as I love trying these session IPAs, there's only one so far I can say I loved (DayTime). Not to mention, session IPAs don't make a huge amount of sense from a monetary standpoint. Having said that, between All Day and Centennial, I'd choose this one every single time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little sharp but crisp seems to be the concept. I think this is one of the better under-five-percent beers I've had, especially for a hoppy variety where the bitterness can get ahead of the more delicate body. From the 12 oz bottle out of the cooler at Whole Foods in DC."
""
""
"I know this is labeled and supposed to be a session ale, but it's a little too light for my liking. Would prefer more in the body too match the smell. I really love all the other offerings I have had from Founders, but this one misses the mark for me. Not too say it wasn't a decent beer, just not one I would seek out in the future."

"It's been a while since my first taste of All Day, and I must say I do miss it a bit. It pours a clear brass topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mild greens, very light biscuit, and a touch of citrus peel. The taste brings in more of the same, with a touch of spice tossed into the greens for good measure. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, this is still a nice ""session"" IPA, proof that Founders knows how to make a pleasant brew."
""
""
""

"O - Overall I was very, very pleased with this ""Every Day IPA"" and wasn't expecting it to be such a good beer. This a definitely a fridge filler with the price point and I will always have this one on hand."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I expected better from Founders. I realize the point of this brew is supposed to be a sessionable IPA but this brew ends up not quite strong enough to be an IPA and not quite malty enough to be something else. The hops could be better balanced; there is too much grapefruit in both the smell and the taste."
""
""
""
"Bright orange gold with a bright white head that starts out at about one finger thick before falling to a fine layer of tiny bubbles with lace on the edges. The smell is of bright citrus and pine hops with just a touch of caramel malt in the background, the hops are really the focus with this one. The taste follows the smell with an explosion of hop flavor on first sip. The grapefruit tangyness is in the forefront with the pine and herbal hop flavors following close behind. Like the smell there isn't much of the malt in this one but there is just a enough, really not enough to balance the hops but that would have made this a much bigger beer which was obviously not the intent. As a result of the lower alcohol and gravity, the body of this is fairly light the moderate to high carbonation adds to that making it even lighter. Overall this is a nice IPA, the lighter body makes it great for a hot summer day, a picnic or poolside maybe not the best IPA out there but the light body and great hop flavors makes it really enjoyable to drink."
""
""
""
""
""

"Clear, ambery orange. Not a great head. The smell is orange, too: loads of citrus with some tropical aromas – lychee, papaya – as well as a touch of freshly-cut grass. Taste and mouthfeel border on anemic. There are some nice mango-ish hop flavors here, and the beer overall is very balanced, but it lacks body and depth. I get that this is meant to be a lower alcohol version of the style, but I've had beers 10-20 percent weaker than this that were way more delicious and interesting. If I'm honest I've had low-alcohol beers that were tastier. As a sort of basic pale ale, it's not bad. As an American IPA, it's a failure."
"D: This was a great session IPA with delicious but gentle scent and taste. The body was a bit thin, but the finish was smooth as can be. Just about the perfect beer to drink all day."
""
""
""
"Not one of Founder's best and not really all that impressive for an IPA. Could use more body and more punch."
"This beer pours a clear copper color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of pine, melon, tangerine, and flowers. Where the aroma is vibrant and juicy, the taste is subdued and short-lived. There is a flash of fruith hops, but it vanishes as quickly as it is noticed. It is pleasant when it is there, however, which only adds to the disappointment of its early disappearance. The mouthfeel is lighter bodied with a thinnish texture, and a bone dry texture. All of which I appreciate in a session beer. Overall, this is a nice beer. I would like the flavor to stick around a few seconds more, but it is still good nonetheless."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"O - An overall surprisingly hoppy and tasty beer for the lower than normal ABV for this style....hats off to Founders for creating a hop forward beer to satisfy the hop heads without all the alcohol and stupidness that follows. (!!). Definitely could drink this one all day while sitting on the deck."

"Appearance is decent, yet nothing to get overly excited about. I realize we have to grade this criteria and while sometimes the super sticky lacing left behind by a standout IPA does get me excited, it means NOTHING, if the beer doesn't taste good. Medium copper/champagne hybrid with delicate foam and sparse lacing to boot. The smell is a refreshing combination of pine, orange peel and lemon zest. This really tastes magnificent and I would warn IPA lovers to have a few before giving a concrete review. I wasn't in love immediately because I kept wanting to compare it to other favorites that I enjoy. Despite the ABV, this has a hop kick that is immediately noticeable and thoroughly consistent. Extremely crisp and prickly, it goes down smooth and begs you to enjoy more. While I would never compare this to heavier West Coast style IPAs, I think it needs to be judged for what its brewer intended. This is a session ale that is spot on for an IPA. I could and have consumed multiple brews of this seasonal offering from Founders without feeling the side effects of your typical IPA. This beer is completely underrated. Give it a chance before it's out of rotation."

"I don't get it. The first one of these I had out of the sixpack was so enjoyable and tasty and refreshing and light. I thought I'd found my new go-to beer, particularly for warm weather. Several days later, the second one tasted like straight up cat pee. Is that the Simcoe hops? Is it one of the undisclosed hops they say are in there? I don't know but it makes for an unpleasant experience. I tried a third one several days later and it was cat pee again. Pushed the rest of the pack off on a friend. This one gets perma-banned from my fridge."

"Looks like an orange colored American IPA. Pleasant pale ale smell, with expected citrus and piney goodness. Great bitter flavor. Slick yet bitey mouthfeel. Is it the best IPA out there...no. But 4.7%?!?!? Given the diminutive caloric hit, and a smaller liver jab than a pair of Tylenol, this beer is awesome!!! My new default IPA in the fridge. Did I say awesome?"
""
"Smell is dank and earthy. Lots of hops of the English earth. Some light citrus. Bready malt. Taste is perfect. Dry hoppy ale that is crisp while having a satisfying punch. Support dry finish with lots of hop oil lingering. Feel is as I said crisp with nice mildly effervescent carbonation. A perfect American expression of a mild ale."

"I think this beer should be evaluated in a different catergory from other IPA's. It's not meant to compete with them. The abv is 4.7% for Pete's sake! As a ""fishing trip on the lake-session ale with some hop flavor, this is a great beer!"

"Pours up a crystal clear medium gold with a small foamy head, pretty good retention, and small bits of lacing. I don't have the world's strongest sense of smell, but the nose seems to be mostly apples, and citrus. Taste is a little drier than I expected with a bit of yeastiness up front. The finish is citrusy and an undertaste of charcoal. Mouthfeel is nice with a good amount of carbonation. Not bad at all, but for Founders I was a little underwhelmed."
""
"overall: Founder's created the ultimate session IPA. I was hesitant to buy a sixer because I like my beers, especially IPAs, heavy and high in alcohol and hops. I just didn't think this could compare, but I stand corrected. Massive flavor, well balanced, satisfying to a huge hophead like myself, I am pleasantly surprised and will be buying this a lot more in the future. I can't figure out how they got so much hoppiness into such a light IPA, but they did."

"The fun irony with this beer is despite any complaints I have with it, it's very, very drinkable. I COULD have this all day if I needed to, and works well for outdoor picnics or camping trips that even the driver could have one and be fine. However, what's even more ironic is that it is classified by the guys at Founders as an IPA, but it instead feels similar to many dry-hopped pale ales, only with less of a kick from the alcohol, and, well, less of a kick overall with the faded bready and hoppy characteristics. Doesn't hold my interest for very long, but it's still a solid Founders' offering."
"Overall: A nice session IPA like it was intended to be. Hoppy and light is not a bad thing and great for the warmer months."

"I love this take on the IPA - the hops make it more assertive than a typical pale ale, but the low alcohol content makes it perfect for cottages, yard work, or fishing. Cans are coming soon as well, which will make it easier to lug around in coolers. Great beer!"
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a fluffy white head about 2 fingers thick that fades to a lacing that clings to the side of the glass. This is a very nice looking beer, something you could easily fool your BMC drinking friends into trying. The aroma is citrus, mellon, and mango, with a slightly bready aroma. The taste is a little disappointing. I was expecting more of a hop punch similar to a pale ale. Its sadly not very complex, mostly pine with a strange grainy finish. The carbonation is on the higher end for the style but it makes it rather quaffable with its dry finish and light body. Overall it is exactly what it says it is, something you can drink all day. I'm very happy to have it here for the TX summer and I look forward to consuming many in the future."
""
"This is a good looking IPA, it smells great and taste great, just enough bitterness and still very very session worthy. Looking forward to them canning this beer this year. Will make for a good summer having some all day IPA in the cooler. Or on draft."
""
""
""
"O - This is a delicious, hoppy session IPA. High drinkability and very refreshing. The mouthfeel is a little too light, but otherwise this is everything a light IPA should be."
""
"Overall - For a sessionable IPA, this one hits the nail right on the head. Very tough to beat to have a beer with the flavor and ABV, along with the wonderful aroma. It is a great session beer, you can have many of these and not worry. This beer will be great for those warm summer afternoons when you don't want something too light. This will also satisfy your hunger for hops on those hot sunny days."

"Good but not impressive in Beer Geek mode, when its characteristics are under deep scrutiny, by works damn well in its intended role: having one or more when involved in other activities, like fishing or mowing the lawn."
""

"O: Serves its purpose well, an multiple session ipa with an easy malting and respectable smooth hopping. Probably makes good for a warm summer treat, though equally as nice as a fall beer. Solid B offering, wet upfront, toasty dry finish."

"Nice beer for a session, but it leaves a lot to be desired due to the metallic aftertaste. Could be due to a bad tap, but not a good enough beer to bring me back. However, due to the overall quality hop flavor, this beer may see some repeat business from me due to the mellow starting taste and the overall drinkability. Poor mouthfeel may e a result of the metallic taste but the lack of a quality head and carbonation hurts."

"Poured from bottle into hill farmstead tulip. Pours a deep bronze slightly amber color with no head but slight white rim of lacing. Amazing aroma of mango juicy hop with slight malt. Nice hop flavor...again juicy mango with a tropical flavor as well...some nice light malt balance. Its a little thin and lacking on body but it is a lighter brew. All around a great session brew with a lot of flavor."
""
""
""

"O- pretty good flavor for the low ABV, not as much bitterness as a typical IPA, but it could easily be a session beer. For a hit summer day, this would be a fine choice"

""
""
"This is a great session ale. It is also a great IPA. Apparently it does have some flaked maize in it which helps give it a sweet and crispy finish. This really accentuates the hops that make it a great IPA. Plus, it's always great when you can have a few and still drive home."
"Overall:I am not a huge fan of IPAs, personally, but that does not mean this is a bad beer. I thought for an IPA, it was good"
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice and sessionable piney ipa. I could see myself drinking a few as the weather warms. Above average beer, but there are several other ipas that I like more."
"I have decided with this beer that Indian Pale Ale beers are not my first choice of style. Although it was well balanced the hops were very strong. My favorite thing about this beer is that the aftertaste was not long, although it was bitter. Too hoppy for my personal taste."

"The beer is golden yellow with a small white head. The aroma brings citrus and pine hops. Light in body and sufficiently bitter. A bit watery and certainly refreshing. A nice brew to toss back on a hot day. Lingering bitter hops and perhaps a touch of orange rind. Good stuff."
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic session IPA, the best I've ever consumed. It's full of flavor and doesn't kick your ass, but the body could be a little bit more full to completely satisfy me. Definitely worth a shot."

"I was surprised by the low ABV for this beer, which is why it's an ""All Day IPA."" Overall this beer was a little to heavy on the hops for me (I like hops) but I also thought it was better when the beer got a little warmer."
""
""
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is light, refreshing and very easy drinking. Session IPA or just hop centric pale ale? Who knows why the focus on session, but it is pretty good. I wouldnt mind throwing back a few of these on a hot day. Thanks again for sharing Jason!"
""
""
"O - Does exactly what its name suggest, expect nothing less or more."
"I am not an Indian Pale Ale Drinker and this is my first choice if forced with a decision. It is a well balanced. The hopps are strong but very well balanced with the rest of the ingredients. The hopps come through cleanly without a lot of fuss or distraction. With this beer you get the hopp flavor without too much lasting bitter aftertaste. Founders definitely has a winner with this brew."
"Overall, I like the attempt by Founders to make a session IPA but I feel the style just doesn't work all that well. The hops really overpower everything plus the price is just too high to really session."
"O- This is a smooth beer with lots of full hops that are slightly juicy and slightly pungent adding nice complexity and very drinkable."
"Just the right amount of hops for a session beer plus it's not too overwhelming with the alcohol % that you can have several at a sitting."
"Bitterness is held in check but finishes real clean. Body is maybe a little light for an IPA but makes this very drinkable as well. Carbonation is spot on. I could see kicking back a ton of these particularly once they come out in 12 pack cans. This is one of the best IPA's I've had. If you are a sucker for jucicy citrus/tropical fruits in your IPA this one is for you."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of the best session beers I have ever had and $15 for a 15 pack is absolutely amazing. I will for sure buy this again."
""
"Poured this AIPA from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a light amber color, produced an average white head , featured average retention and average lacing. The aroma consisted of biscuit malt, pine and citric grapefruit. Medium bodied, there was a foundation of sweet malted grain, toffee and an average amount of piney hops- citric grapefruit as well. Overall its an entry level IPA it is what it says it is...a session beer. It will do the trick, but there are much better IPA's out there."
""
""
""
"The All Day IPA by Founders Brewing Company is a great American Style IPA. This beer has an clear, amber appearance. The smell is very hops and wheat flavored. The mouthfeel is very light and ""moorish"". The flavor was also very light and hop flavored. This was a great craft beer."

"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was how easily drinkable it was, and the robustness of aroma and flavoring for what it is. As a session beer, All Day has the job of keeping things light enough to, well, go on all day long. To this goal it is successful, keeping a wildly aromatic and freshly hoppy citric zing, while delivering solid flavoring through most of the sip. With the end of the swallow, and through the feel, things do become watery and washed, but for the most part this is made up for. This is a great beer to sit outside with and enjoy these April showers."
""
""
""
""
" The flavor is bright and has a mild citrus element with green tangy astringency from the hops which are similar to strong brewed green tea, light sweetness but not vegetal and very smooth bitterness with gentle malt backing. Overall this is a very drinkable beer I love how much hop flavor you get in a session strength beer, wonderful to sip on with mushroom pizza as it scrubs the palate and I could probably drink this on any occasion -Kudos Founders!"
""
"O: This is what IPA would taste like if Budweiser tried it. Hop finish seems artificial and the taste is all wrong. A heavily dry hopped pale would be much better than this. Its only the second bad IPA I have had, and this might be the worst of the two."

"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a solid pale malt scent along with a killer citrus hop nose. It's light and refreshing with plenty of hop character. The taste is good. It has a great hop character that's balanced with an adequate amount of malts. It seems a bit watery, but the hops really add a good amount of complexity. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a highly drinkable beer and it's incredibly sessionable as well."

"this ipa from founders is pretty drinkable but there are so many others out there that drop kick your taste buds into submission- why would you phone it in? this beer isnt bad. it pours a nice golden color. the smell makes a lot of promises- its piney and has a lot of citrus. the taste comes on strong at first and has a slight kick at the end but isnt nearly as strong as some other ipa's out there...this beer is called everyday ipa, so i guess the jokes on me, theyre telling you right out the gate that there is nothing that special about this. its not a bad beer..but with so many great ipa's out there, this seems kinda pointless."
""
""
""
"O: Decent IPA, would drink a lot of these at a party or on a hot day."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed copper coloring with a thin, low profile white head that quickly disappears. The nose is very fresh hop forward, with a steady dose of bitterness and resin, with an underlying sweetness of citrus fruit and caramel to balance. Flavors are much lighter than the nose would hint at. Rich caramel and tart grapefruit on the forward tongue, with a peppery dry hops characteristic immediately following. Peppery and bitter aftertaste, with some resiny properties. Mid-bodied, with a slightly dry, slightly effervescent finish. Very easy to drink, which from the title was what they were going for."
""
""
"O: I'm pretty disappointed in this one. I'm a big fan of what Founders does and I was really looking forward to my first ""All Day."" I love IPAs and the thought of being able to consume an extra one or two at a sitting without falling down was very appealing. Unfortunately, this just isn't a beer I want to consume more than one of -- and even one is likely to be too many. This is the oddest tasting IPA I've ever tried. Maybe it will grow on me with time, and I have another 5 to test that hypothesis. But right now, I'm not too optimistic."

""
""
"Overall: At first it is very bland, but it is one of those that builds up sip after sip. It is definitely not on the level of some other IPAs I have had but I would definitely call this an easier intro for the style of beer. One more thing because of the wet hop feel, it feels like a thirst quencher. This might just be your warm weather IPA. Salud!"

"Poured a cloudy amber with a short lived head. Aroma is rich and sweet, with strong fruit and pine notes. The taste is a wonderful mix of hop bitterness (pine, citrus) and the tropical fruit, citrus, and pine. Little carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. A great big flavor IPA with a session-able ABV."

"o- i could see many a summer day that i make at least of 3 of these vanish... for breakfast. great with spicy food... we have a pulled pork sandwich that this would DANCE with. Points for stylistic authenticity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sidenote: I just want to say that I'm glad that Founders has made a really good, complex, flavorful beer that I can take to a BBQ or other outdoor long-lasting event and not be a mess. The ABV race to the top gets annoying to craft beer drinkers who want to kick back and enjoy a few but are often limited to splitting a 12 oz. bottle and that's it (unless you want to get sloshed)."

"O: Definitely a sessionable IPA. Flavors are pretty mellow (it's 4.7%, what do you expect) but it's still pretty nice. It's like a mini IPA or as the bottle says aptly: a fractional IPA. Simple, but nice. Goes down easy."
""
"Very light, hoppy IPA with just enough malt to keep it in balance. Really enjoyed this, although i prefer a pale ale over this ""light"" IPA style."
""
""
"O- easy drinking beer, but not something I'd drink by the gallon at the price point. You can get better IPAs for less money, and that unfortunately puts a hole in the whole sessionable aspect of this"
""
"O-Disappointed, but still not a bad beer necessarily. Very simple and a thin body, but it is sessionable. The fact that they had that in mind whilst brewing it makes it a little better. For the price, I'd buy SNPA any day over this."
""
""
""
"No obvious flaws. Not unique or special."
""
"O - I'm not a hops or IPA guy, really, but I like to believe I can still recognize a good one. This one's decent and sessionable."

"A nice quality drinker for warm weather - which seems far away, although does seem a little possible in some distance future . Balanced well in flavors"
""
""
""
""
"For whatever reason, I enjoyed this last bottle much more than the rest of the 6. Definitely lots of good hop flavor for a low ABV beer, I think I would prefer Lagunitas DayTime for a session IPA though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is light, flavorful, and stupidly quaffable. My only question is how it compares to Lagunitas DayTime. The fact that this is year-round rather than rotating is certainly a plus. Overall, I think I prefer the hop profile of DayTime but the malt profile here. I will certainly be buying this in the future."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Brightly hoppy with a bitterness that was dominating but not overbearing or disagreeable."
"This is a good sessionable beer. I will be buying more this summer."
""

"o - Overall a very nice IPA and easy to drink. The nose is extremely nice and hoppy, and there is no bitterness in this one at all. Glad this is popping up all over NY, would definitely buy a 6er of it again."
""
""
"Honey yellow in color with a slight chill haze. Poured with a brief white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Pungent herbal and citrus hop aromas. The feel is on the thinner side, a tad bit watery up front until the tangy, assertive carbonation rolls through. Herbal hop flavors up front followed by citrus hops through the middle and pine hops at the end. Finishes with a long lasting, bitter pine hop after taste. The hops are the showcase, biting, tangy, and bitter. Not much malt presence, but that's probably the point with the ""all day"" session theme here."
""
""
"Overall, this is a great all-day drinker like its name says. Nothing special as far as IPA's go, but I would definitely keep this around for an everyday IPA."
"Front of flavor is tart, piney, and heavily resinous. There's a nice light malty sweetness that carries through. I miss the majority of the juicier fruit flavors but still pick up orange and lemon rind. Overall, very tasty, refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Hoppy flavor @ 4.7% abv works 'All Day' for me."
""
""
"O: Not a good IPA. This would not even make a good pale ale. Little flavor and more common IPAs are better and cheaper."
"Overall: Solid session but not something I would continue to come back for."
""
""
""
""
"O: An easy drinker, but full-flavored. Founders has shown with this beer that a hoppy IPA doesn't need to be 6.5 or 7% ABV."
""
""
"Maybe just a bit to much bitterness in the finish here, for me anyway. Though, a small gripe. Something I can enjoy pretty much all day. Well done, and recommended."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not exactly an earth-shattering take on the IPA, but nonetheless a tasty beer. Drinkable."

"This would be a pretty good pale ale but it doesn't hold up in the IPA category. All Day IPA does a good job of filling its niche as a light sessionable beer for outdoor activity."
""
""
""
"Please note, this was my first ""Session beer"" and therefore my review on this may be skewed. I am not particularly fond of the style but I will agree that it IS ""sessionable"" in the sense of what they designed it to be."
"Pretty much what I expected. With the low ABV it still packs a large hop punch with some nice fruity and floral flavors."

"a beautifully clean copper/gold color with a finger of white head, lots of visible carbonation. smells very hoppy, grapefruit, pine, caramel. the flavor is mostly hoppy, definitely tasting the 2row, grapefruit, pine. medium body on the lighter side, moderate carbonation. a very refreshing and tasty ipa. the lower alcohol percentage makes it a perfect summer beer."
"I suppose if you are just a crazy hop-addict who needs an IPA to session, you might find this beer appealing, but for those of us who are open to other styles that are easy to drink, there are many better options for tasty, light bodied and low ABV beer."
""
""
""
"O: A nice session IPA that very drinkable at 4.7% ABV and certainly keeps you interested with it's strong hop profile. As the name implies, you could drink it all day, but I'm not convinced that I would. However, I'd get it again and consider adding it to a summer BBQ or camping pack."
""
""
""
"O- A lighter, easy drinking IPA, very enjoyable. Packs a nice bitter punch in a sessional beer."
""
""
"Wow, I am completely sold on this one. Most impressive session ale I've had in recent memory. Appearance is average and doesn't begin to capture its wonders. Body is slightly hazy amber with a small white head with weak retention. Aromas, however, are vibrant and lively. Orange zest, floral notes, and honeyish sweetness and a bit of bubblegum leap out of the glass on this one. The taste is predominantly hoppy on the front and back palates, with the middle striking a balance between grains and fresh greens with a hint of herbal goodness. I really like this beer. It puts many IPAs to shame in its finesse and downplayed alcohol content, and shames session ales with the thrillingly assertive hop profile."
"Overall: Not my favorite ipa by some measure but it is what it claims to be. its a pleasant tasting and i could drink quite a few of these. definitely a hit by founders for me"
""
""
""
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Pours a translucent orange-copper with a loose, 1/8th inch off-white head that quickly dissipates into a tight band around the shoulders and a soapy/oily dollop across the center; no lacing. Nose expresses floral and citrusy notes as well as faint tropical fruit esters and a hint of earth and spice. Taste is considerably more watered down - some citrus notes are still present; however, the earthy/herbal bitterness dominates the flavor profile, hiding many of the nuances expressed in the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive, slightly prickly carbonation and a pleasant, palate-cleansing acidity. Overall, pretty good, but closer to a hoppy APA than an American IPA (perhaps just semantics). That said, enjoyable, but there are other beers in the same ballpark that I would go to before this one again."
"I like the concept, but I think they sacrificed too much here."
"The taste does not follow the nose as earthy musky tones are followed by a watery finish. There are hints of grapefruit throughout but they are weak. The feel is easy and light, hence the All Day but its not quite an IPA like experience."
""
""
""
""
"Session IPA, really hoppy APA, whatever you consider this, it's am excellent low-gravity hop monster. I don't find it as tasty as a good 7% IPA, but there's definitely a place for low ABV, hoppy beers, especially once the summer months roll around."
""

"Medium to light texture in the mouthfeel. I notched the overall score a bit because it's nice to have reasonably flavorful session beer. Well done, Founders."

"O- After the one pint, I wanted more of it. I assume after the second I would want more as well. Truly a session IPA which I must confess this is the first of the kind I have tried coined as such but very appropriate. It really presented itself as a double/imperial IPA without the big syrupy mouthfeel I perceive in many. Cheers."

"It's nice to have a very hoppy beer that's not 8%+ abv. This beer does tend to lean on the bitter side, but it has tons of hop flavor if that's what you're after."

"Overall (3.75): This is a good beer, and both legitimately IPA-ish and sessionable. Still, this is not what I would reach for if I wanted something ≤5% ABV—I’m not convinced that IPAs that light can scratch the same itch as an IPA. I don’t mind the light malt body, but a little more heft would help smooth over the astringency of vegetal-herbal hops bitterness. If you’re craving hops and want something sessionable, then this may be a good choice. Otherwise, I’d still prefer a very light saison or a well-made pilsner."

"I like the idea of this beer but it doesn't hold up to most good ipa's a couple of percent abv stronger. The flavour is too weak and the body too light. Glad I tried it but doubt I will probably not purchase again."
""

"O - I prefer a more well rounded ""normal", or higher gravity IPA. But Founders provides a great session IPA, for the hop head at the lake in the summer time."

"Really nice package. Super sessionable, really difficult to comprehend the relatively low ABV at times, easy to think this was 6% just with how much is in this. Very enjoyable."
"I really wanted to like this beer. When I first tried it, I thought ""Oh, a nice clone of New Glarus Moon Man."" But that's where the similarities stopped. It's like a beer spritzer. Weak, yet hoppy, and I felt myself not really wanting to drink it. It quickly went flat, and I'm only drinking more to try and catch a buzz. I wouldn't buy it again, and I'm wondering now if Founders has gotten too big for their britches. I think their quality is slipping, and a brewery I once thought could do no wrong, is proving me wrong. Don't bother."

"Overall a great beer that was too easy to drink; named perfectly, this is a definite session beer, however the only drawback is that it is lighter than expected as far as the flavor so that is the trade off. Either way, I’m glad this beer is available in NY now."
"Pours light amber with a aggressive head that quickly disappeared. Hoppy aroma with pine and fruit. The taste is Hops and citrus, grapefruit. Bitter. Just a hint of sweetness and malt. Light body and noticeable carbination. Its an easy drinking low abv ipa. A good afternoon have several beer."

"O-Nothing outstanding but a beer that you can have a few off without any side-effects yet nice on flavor."
"A wonderful session-worthy IPA that packs a superb hop wallop. Bravo!"
"Overall this is a great beer. Great for lawn mowing. Great for frisbee golf. Great for fishing. Just great."
"Very drinkable session-like IPA in my opinion which is why All Day IPA is such a great name! Drinkable, palatable and refreshing. Great to pair with a rare burger. Low-hop profile with a beautiful tropical fruit nose makes this beer interesting and yummy. I can picture myself getting a six pack of this to enjoy while barbecuing. Not much else to say about this beer, I recommend picking it up when you just want to enjoy something, or if you are new to IPAs try this one out first to get your palate more experienced to the subtley that hops can have in well-crafted brew."
"Final Thoughts: Founder's has done a good job making All Day IPA a flavorful, yet low ABV beer. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
"O-Great beer overall. Highly drinkable and with a 4.7% abv can drink this beer all day long. Very well done."
"The nose on this beer is great. Unfortunately, the flavor seems quite thin. I'd hope for a lot more punch; especially coming from Founders. But for what it is, it's a great session ale and something I would easily go to if I wanted to have more than a few, but not something I would go to for flavor."
""
"A stellar hoppy session ale. In the realm of Zombie Dust, though not as good. I'm always impressed when brewers can put this much oomph into a low-ABV beer. But beyond the hop presence, this beer is really well crafted, with near-perfect mouthfeel and no downsides. Excellent."
""
"Overall, a really solid take on a session IPA from Founders. Packs a really nice amount of flavor for the ABV and some really nice hop notes. Nothing too outstanding, but I will certainly look for this again in the summer."
"Overall pretty nice but nothing phenomenal, decent hop flavors but lacking a little something, and bitterness gets a little too in your face for an all day session beer"
""
"Nicely hopped. Definitely an all-day beer."

""
"O: This is a pretty easy-drinking beer with a great hops presence. I wish the malt flavors were a little more assertive. All in all though it's a really good session beer."
"I enjoyed this a lot. Light but with solid malt character. Plenty of hops for the strength tasting much more bitter than 42 IBU's. Light, crisp and refreshing."

"Pours a clear, gold color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, citrus hops, slight floral hops, hint of hop oil, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. The bitterness level is slight. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, citrus hops, slight floral hops, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and blend. Based on the name, the body is appropriately session-able."

"overall: Gotta confess, I'm a go big (DIPA) or go home guy. Give me HopSlam or Unearthly or 90 minute. Two hearted is about as ""light"" as I wanna go. But this is as well done a ""small"" IPA as I can imagine."
""
""
"Exactly what it claims to be. An easy drinking low ABV IPA that doesn't fall in to APA territory. Hello fallback sixer."
"D/O: A close cousin to Founder's Harvest Ale, this low-ABV IPA boasts many of the favorable malt qualities of that other, excellent beer. Hops qualities, while evident, are not well established--a complication similar to that of Ballast Point's Even Keel session IPA. Add Lagunitas' similarly-named Daytime IPA to the conversation, and one has an interesting, thematic trio of light ales with hops occupying the lead role."

"The beer pours a beautiful clean golden color with a touch of orange. The beer’s head is off-white and the bubbles are just above small in size with a fuzzy looking texture. Carbonation looks quite lively within the beer, and the beer’s body is oddly lager clean with just a faint haze from the darker malt. Lacing is light and patchy, leaving bubbles that are sticky and medium in size. The lacing also gives off a fuzzy look, much like the head does. On the nose, the beer smells of piney resinous hops with a healthy hit of citrus. The malts are light and caramelly beneath the bitter hoppy aromatics, but this is a good healthy IPA smell. The pine and citrus smells meld together beautifully, suggesting orange peel, slight lemon, grapefruit, and then good old pine tree. On the tongue, the beer tastes sharp and bitter with a nice malty finish and a touch of wateriness on the back end. The taste begins with a washing of mild bitters which build into grapefruit and slight bitter aspirin flavors, and stay on the tongue for awhile. As the bitter flavors hit the finish with a lot of water flavors, the tongue is left with residual slightly toasted malt flavor and a fair lingering of bitters. The beer also has a watery quality towards the middle of the sip, which suggests it 4.7% alcohol. The wateriness is a little upsetting for me, and though this beer is nicely bitter and full of flavor for a below 5% beer, it carries a little more water flavor than other’s of its style. On the mouth, the beer feels light and watery in body, while the carbonation is medium to prickly, leaving the tongue with a nice scrub. The mouth is left damp in the cheeks with a little bitter dryness in the middle of the tongue. Overall, this is a great all day beer with some nice bitter flavors. It does exactly what the brewery set out to do, and for that I applaud them. I like Levitation from Stone better though. I understand that Levitation is technically an amber ale, but I consider it and All Day in the same style, and I think Stone was able to have less of that watery taste and body in the beer, which is an impressive feet for an under 5% beer. This is a great beer to bring out an about, and a great one to quench your thirst, but there are better options in the style. Still, try this beer out."

""
""
"O: A great ""light"" IPA. Great flavor with a nice light, session feel. My only question is why release it late winter and not late spring into summer? This would be much better suited for outdoor, warmer weather."
""
"Overall - Big disappointment. I really wanted to like this beer too. Oh well. There are plenty of sessionable beers out there for similar prices that actually have flavor and body. I wouldn't bother with this one."
""
""
"Another winner from Founders. Just as clean and tasty as advertised and an all day drinkable IPA."

"O-I really wouldn't say this is an IPA. It's just not hoppy an bitter enough. I really like it, but I did like the Lagunitas Daytime better."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and can easily take down a 6-pack in an evening because of the drinkability, low ABV and the enjoyable flavor profile. While I feel Lagunitas Day Time IPA was a bit more flavorful, both are great examples of a style I hope will continue to be released into the market."
""
"O: I'm going to start by saying that I think the concept of the session IPA is dumb. I haven't had one yet that I can say I truly enjoyed. This is no different. The nose is great, but it falls flat from there. It's just the nature of the style. There isn't enough body and malt backbone. It feels emaciated and hollow. That's the price you pay for the lower abv."
"O - This is an awesome beer and I love the lower abv. Do not love the price though. $11 for a six pack at a reasonable store? Oy....this is a tough pill to swallow."
"Solid IPA. I expected nothing less and got what was deserved."
"O: One of my favorites from Founders, and that’s saying something. This is a truly mouthwatering hop experience, but in a refreshing package that’s nothing but easy-drinking (though I do love those sticky, hoppy DIPAs). A beer that screams summer."

"Drinkability: This is decent and drinkable — especially, I would assume, while outdoors. It is not overpowering, but it does offer good flavor without being overly heavy or boozy."
""
"Overall: All Day IPA showed up in Minnesota so I grabbed a sixer. It is definitely a bitter and dry IPA, and the lightness means I could have several in a sitting. Unfortunately I don't really like IPAs quite this bitter, a little more sweetness would be nice. But then it would probably be above 5%."
"O - Quite impressive IPA. Definately not one of the big imperial knock you on your butt IPAs. I think they hit spot on with what they were trying to achieve, an IPA that could be enjoyed all day long. Great beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- For an IPA that is sessionable, highly recommended."
""
"A lovely session ipa, but I would personally grab something with more of a malt presence and have one or two less beers. This would make a nice ipa lawn mower beer. Maybe my opinion will rise with the temperature."
""
"O/D-I knew I was going to love this. Flavorful all supremely drinkable. I will say that I enjoyed Lagunitas' DayTime IPA a bit more (comparing here is my unneeded comparison of session-IPAs) but this one rocks too. I have been waiting to try this and it didn't disappoint. Drinks easy but never skimps of complexity and quality."
""
"It's big, but it is not. It's bold but light. It's truly a session able IPA. I call it a hop head brew I could drink all day indeed."
"O - impressed with what it is, this would be my go to if I want to drink a whole six pack of something with great hop aroma and light flavor that completely refreshes you. So rating this on style only, I would say this is great. Overall as a beer in general, I would only reach for this in the above mentioned situation and probably wouldn't buy this just to enjoy one. I found the taste very similar to MBC lunch, since this actually IS available in six packs I'll probably get it again."

"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent light golden color with a half inch of head. Some lacing. This one smells fantastic. Citrus and floral hops. Sweet orange and grapefruit. Hints of grains. The taste isnt as hoppy as the aroma indicated but there is still a nice amount of floral and citrus hops. Grains as well. Super drinkable with very little alcohol presence. Light and crisp mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer is exactly what it is supposed to be; a flavorful, hoppy low ABV brew. Overall, a perfect beer to have a bunch of in the fridge."
""

"Verdict: A really enjoyable session IPA from Founders. The flavors do skew to the lighter side and aren't as impactful as a higher gravity IPA but the refreshing nature of this beer makes it a winner."

"Pours a clear, golden-amber, with a very thin white ring of froth. There's a slight amount of lacing later on. I find the smell of this beer to be extremely enticing, with very citrusy, aromatic hops. Once tasted, it's easy to surmise that there's virtually no malts present whatsoever. Lots of different hop flavor notes here - piny, resinous, and also citrusy grapefruit (like the aroma indicated). I wonder what different types of hope were used... It's a very clean libation, a perfect light-bodied choice for having with a meal, during a summer's day, or in large quantities with your buddies. Overall this 'session-able' IPA succeeds in every way as advertised, despite how suspect that statement initially sounds!"
"O: not sure why this is a session beer because it is one and done for me on this IPA (and i am a huge fan of Founders IPAs/DIPAs). Very disappointed."

"Overall: A very solid West Coast style session IPA. Very good citrus flavor. Impressive for the low ABV."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled 2/18/13. Pours a bright orange yellow, with a one inch fluffy white head, that leaves webs of lace on the sides of the glass. Smell is pineapple, tangerine, cut grass, apricot, and grapefruit. Taste is all that, very balanced, with a hit of grapefruit in the finish that lingers a bit. Body is light, plenty of carbonation, a little dry, and you can drink plenty. This is what it says it is and is really a complex delicious lower abv beer."
"12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Clear copper with a rich bright-white head. Robust sticky lace drenches the sides of the glass. Smells grassy and bitter with herbal notes and touch of pine and sweet tropical fruit that stick to the breadiness of the malt. The taste is grassy herbal character with a rind-like bitterness and some light resins. Herbal character gets more tea-like as this warms. A well balancing sweetness on the edges comes courtesy of the malt and the additional fruit notes of the hops. The mouthfeel has a medium bodied firm creaminess to it that flows rather easily across the palate. This was nice, with an easy drinking nature yet still packed in some full hoppy flavors. Quite quenching and sessionable overall."
""
""
"O: Good session beer if you like dry IPAs. The aroma is definitely the nicest part to this beer."
""
""
"Very good hop character in both flavor and aroma. Bitterness is not overwhelming. Possibly a little too complex to truly be an all day drinking beer for me, but I enjoyed the flavoring and aroma hop profiles. A little more malt character, and it'd be excellent."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think it could use more hops but otherwise, you'd be just as well off drinking an APA. I think Otter Creek and Lawsons Finest have better examples."
"Overall: fresh and brightly flavorful. Well worth a try. As advertized a sessionable, lower alcohol IPA - Nicely done"
"This one exceeded all expectations for a lower abv beer...but the onion notes keep me from rating it higher."
""
""
"Where the beer prefers a straight-forward taste of hop dominance over any malt balances, ester complexity, spice notes, or variations in grain caramelization- it does so brilliantly and confidently. It's a beer that draws the bottom of the glass far too soon and proves the notion that you can't have just one. I can drink this all day long!"
""
"O - Sessionable, just like it was meant to be. However, if the carbonation maintained itself through the whole mouthfeel, this would be a phenomenal brew. But it just falls flat and watery half way through."
"Medium bodied with a crisp and spicy earthy hop bite that lingers over the sweeter fruit notes and pale malt backbone into a dry finish. Fresh juicy hops with some dry, earthy bitterness and resinous pine flavor countered by hints of grapefruit, mango and pineapple. Could use a bit more citrus/tropical fruit flavor but there is enough there to add complexity and balance out the bitterness. Underneath, there is a pale malt backbone that really helps balance things out without taking away from the hop flavors. Some bread, biscuit, graham cracker and a touch of sweetness rounding things out in the finish. Really tasty and excellently balanced with a low ABV making this beer extremely drinkable. Not the most flavorful or aggressively hopped IPA but it's really nice and I could see myself drinking this ""all day""."
""
""
""
""
"O: It doesn't taste quite as good as it smells, and just generally comes through as one of many above-average seasonal brews out there. It isn't a bad beer by any means, but it isn't particularly memorable either. Easy to drink, which is what it is supposed to be."
"Lots of hoppy character. A little unbalanced on the bitterness end (even for an IPA) but the spicyness helps. Low ABV makes this a sessionable beer. Good citrus and piney notes to the nose. Clear golden color. Not my favorite IPA but this is a good one and worth a try."
""
"A very flavorful light brew. Good hop flavor. I could drink these all day like the name suggests."
""
""
"O - One of the best session IPA's I've ever had. The first bottle I had about a week ago was even better, so drink this asap."
""
""
"Pours a clear deep golden color with a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates to a small ring on the top. Smells of citrus pine and earth with a hint of bready malt that barely shows itself. The flavor is fruity, juicy, citrus and pine with a hint of bready malt to make you believe there is actually some malt in there. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Great light easy drinking ipa, If I thought my wife would let me get away with it I could drink these all day."
""
""
"The taste begins with a quick burst of grainy malts and then evolves quickly into a moderate hop bitterness that lingers passionately to the end. I won't forget that. A nice IPA."
""
""
"I hate to say that this is a good ``session ale''. It's kind of like saying Stephen King is a good horror writer. The fact is he's a good writer regardless of genre and this is a really good beer that can stand on its own against a lot of IPAs that aren't holding anything back."
""
"O: A solid sessionable IPA (I'd rather just call it a pale ale) that is (of course) easy to drink and has a nice flavor profile going on. Recommended for those who want the flavors of an IPA but the drinkability of a pale"
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation, and it finishes dry. This is a really nice IPA. I am very impressed by how much flavor there is in this low abv beer. Well done."
"Speaking of these beers in general, I am a little annoyed at the marketing gimmick of calling these session beers IPAs or Super Pale Ales. They're not. They are extremely Americanized forms of the English Bitter. A least Surly recognizes that their version is Bitter-like, as opposed to calling it an IPA. Can we make an American Bitter category, and be done with the ridiculous marketing? That said, I love this ""style""."
""
""
""
"O - This beer is very average, below average compared with the Founders line up. I hate to say this but this more fits an IPA that the big boys would produce to enter the market. Its very light and you could definitely drink a lot of it. I wouldn't actively seek it out, but I would drink it in the warmer months."

"The beer doesnt live up to the nose but it's still a good beer. Light brightly carbonated body. Thins out a bit on the finish. Very piney and floral hop flavor throughout. Not much of a malt presence, a nice hoppy flavored beer but it's not over the top or in your face. Lots of piney hop on the backend. Flavor is big for such a sessionable beer which is nice and the beer is highly drinkable. Def a session beer for hop heads. Lingering bitterness as hop resin coats the tongue. Beer thins a bit on the finish but lends to its drinkability. Very good session IPA but it only comes in a 6 at the same price as all other founders 6's making it an expensive beer to session as well. Hopefully we'll see 12 packs soon."

""
""
"O: While not measuring up in the flavor department for someone that really loves hops, I think this could be an excellent starting point for someone trying to get into the style.

"Slightly hazy gold with a thin but solid white head that leaves nice rings of lacing. Nice aromas of peach, mango, grapefruit, and pineapple with a very mild malt backbone. Taste is similarly tropical and fruity, with a light malt profile and mild bitterness. Excellently drinkable, with a medium-thin body and good carbonation. Overall it's exactly what I expected : a deliciously drinkable and sessionable brew from one of the best breweries on the planet!"

"Bottled just about a month ago, so fairly fresh. Pours a clear golden color with a small white head. Scent is quite hoppy, yet mellow at the same time. Not a very big malt profile, which is what I was hoping for. Some lovely lemon aromas and sweet orange scents. Taste is just as it smells...but a little less hoppy. It is a very tasty beer, but the hops kinda die off in the flavor. I'm sure when it's very fresh that it is a way better beer. Has some similar characteristics as Sierra Nevada Pale. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a very tasty pale ale that is very sessionable. I could see myself easily putting away a six pack of this by myself on a warm summer day."
""
"D - The hop character is excellent, but the malt is a bit too dry and toasty for my taste. While a touch of sweetness would go a long way here, it is a pretty nice session IPA overall."
"O-The aroma of this beer of awesome but the accompanying beer is average. It was a lighter body session ale but it wound up being somewhat average in the end overall for me."
""
"Appearance is light amber, with a head that's initially quite thick, but fades quickly. The scent is all hops - grapefruit and orange - and absolutely intoxicating. I can't stop sniffing. The taste is certainly hoppy, but not as much as the scent might imply. Grapefruit tang is notable from start to finish. Mouthfeel is very thin. For a session ale, this is to be expected. It's a very light and drinkable. A great session IPA."
""
"3.5/5"
""
"O- This is a great beer, I think I actually like this one as much as their rye and centennial IPA's. This is a great ""small"" beer."
"O-It is hard to judge this one based on the style, since the idea is a more sessionable IPA. On flavor alone, there are many more IPAs that pack more punch. As a sessionable IPA however, this one is very good."
"My only main complaint is that the beer tastes a bit ""watery"" at times, but nonetheless, is still packed with flavor for a 4.7% ABV beer. This is definitely something I could drink all day."
""
""
""
""
""
"This achieves exactly what it set out to do: a low-ABV, very hoppy, sessionable ale. I would have preferred a more citrusy hop character for a session beer to avoid palate fatigue, but I'm not complaining. It's a little pricey for a session beer, but I wouldn't turn this down if offered."

"Overall: For what Founders was probably aiming for with this; they nailed it. It’s an enjoyable, flavorful IPA, that doesn’t overpower you. I liked it."
"I keep going back to this beer and editing my initial review and bumping up the score, because this beer really grows on you the longer you sit with it."
"Pours a fast fading low head with only little lacing. Looks to be a dark pils, clear, deeper orange but still on the light side for an IPA. Smells of intricate citrus, pine, pitch, balsam, and something I can't identify. Taste is grapefruit up front, the lightest rind nearest the pulp. Really terrific, high carbonation, fast, and cool, bitter notes are medium high, but somewhat muted, with inviting sustain. Mouth-feel is fast, refreshing, but the hop echo is of moderately long notes, with bitterness fading near the end. I really think this is a terrific IPA, and I've had lots of this since my first sip in April. Of all the craft beers I love, and I've loved lots, this one maybe really is my 'go to' session ale. A repeater, for sure. Does different things than some of my favorite ales out there...standing somewhat alone in my experience... A good follow up after a higher % (D)IPA."
""
"Pours a semi cloudy amber orange color with a very little head. Scent is strong with hops and more hops. Taste is smooth, mellow, and mildly bitter. There is a crisp, clean, hoppy after taste. Overall this is a very well made beer, too bad is in such limited distribution."
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a nice clear amber with a little haze and not much head. Nose is super floral and citrus--yum. Mouthfeel is thin to medium. Taste is a delightful hoppy bitter at first then a solid malt after taste as well. This has quickly become my current session ale of choice--it's just delightful!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body of the beer is fairly light, perhaps medium-light in weight, with substantial carbonation that prickles the palate slightly, but also foams the beer up substantially. The result is a slightly harsh, yet overall smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Finish is quite dry, with little to no stickiness left around the palate."

"O - Overall, a great session beer from Founders that hits the mark. At under 5% ABV, you could drink a lot of these and you would not be missing out on any flavor of bigger beers"
"Overall: Subtle flavors left my palate wanting more. Still, it achieves its intended purpose as a sessionable IPA that has enough flavor to call it above average. I think there are plenty of hopped up pales around the 5% range that pack much more flavor."
""
""
""
"All day IPA indeed. This beer is an orangish yellow colored beer, showing very good head retention and lace. The nose is a powerful one, dry yet full of hops. Clean, crisp citrus and pine in this one. And the taste goes along that way as well. What makes this fun to drink is besides having a relatively low ABV, is that is really does tastes like a very good, lower gravity IPA, and not to be confused with a pale ale. This is recommended for sure, especially during the lunch hour."

"Adequate finger high head of loose off-white bubbles, not quite foam per se, clears off swiftly to a ring around the edges, the lacing is super-thin but does form decently wide streaks before evaporating. Yellow gold colored liquid with a soft orange cast, only a few fat bubbles visible, scattered about, looks “basic” and unassuming. Piney nose with raw grains, grass, yeast and grapefruit rinds, more floral than fruity, more wheat as it warms, overall has a fresh, taut character, good balance and no burn. Medium-bodied, tight and slightly overly aggressive carbonation, keeps it scrubbing into the tongue which favors bitterness over sweetness. Pepper and herbaceous green grass, grains, pine, black tea leaf, the blood orange and grapefruit pith drying. Thin dusting of cocoa and allusion to anise, malts not contributing much to the final equation. Seems to pull back on just about every ingredient, wants a close race among them all, as a result more calculatedly balanced than integrated. You lose interest after the second bottle."

"The beer is a little over-carbonated for it's intended purpose, and I have been pouring these vigorously, and have even resorted to stirring the beer in the glass with a fork to get the carbonation level closer to cask-like. The head is a lovely white with moderate retention--lacing sticks to the glass the whole way through. The nose of the beer is pine resiny. Really inviting. The bitterness here is intense and at 42IBUs, and especially sharp considering the light body--and this pronounced bitterness is the only ""flaw"" I can fault the beer for (though, I'm not actually sure what a session IPA *should* be like in terms of bitterness ;). In any case the bitterness and dryness of the beer conspire together to make the brew especially drinkable, with the end of one sip begging for the beginning of another. If this beer were more widely available (and perhaps a little cheaper) this would be stocked in my fridge all the time."
""
""
"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a light orange/gold with a finger-width of white head on top. Light retention. The nose is bursting with citrus and pine needles! Sharp and inviting aroma. The mouth is crisp and clean. Easy finish. This beer starts out with a nice bitter smack, but this hesitates and finishes with a sweet citrus flavor of orange and tangerine. Well balanced. This cures my craving for the bitterness, but is also quite refreshing and easy to consume. Not the standard for IPAs no doubt, but this one holds its own while also taking on some characteristics of a ""sessioner"" - lighter ABV, clean, tasty. I liked it."
""
""

"D- I could drink a six of this real quick, but would bore of it rather quick, especially at this age. The amount of bitterness is light enough that drinking six would not burn out the palate though. A great session beer."

""
"O: I am not a fan of sessions IPAs so this does not get a favorable rating for me. If these are your style, I think it would hit the spot, but I like my IPAs powerful."
"Big thanks to one of my customers for bringing this by since we don’t get this one in Georgia. Does exactly what Founders set out to do...a nice sessionable IPA. Nothing crazy or extreme, just delivers a hop fix without too heavy of a body or too much alcohol. Great lawnmower beer with serious flavor."
""
"Pours a small hazy deep yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, mellow orange citrus hops. In the taste, dryer hops, with a mellow citrus end. A small hop bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a dry hop, with notes of orange citrus in the aftertaste. Perfect for what it is, an IPA light!"
""
"Great drinkability, not really in my wheelhouse, but a solid AIPA that won't get old too quick in a session"
""
"I see why they named this All Day IPA, because it is light enough to drink all day doing yard work. My only problem is I wouldn't want to spend an entire day drinking this. It is way to light to call it an IPA. I think All Day Hoppy Lager would have fit it a little better. Thanks to jrags8 for this extra."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark amber with wispy white head. Lots of fluff without lacing and a very slight haziness. The nose reveals dank citrusy hops; an aroma that screams this beer will be delicious. Tasting this beer doesn't disappoint with heavy hops and malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is a little watery making this beer drinkable, but a little lacking. The head leaves a thin blanketing throughout drinking. Overall I think this beer is long overdue and it shouldn't be such a novelty to have a drinkable, low abv IPA!"
""
"no complaints with this one other then the fact I can't find it in my home town, thanks again liamt07 for sending me this one"
"Clear golden orange with a finger of white head. Moderate retention and good lacing. Nose of bright citrus fruits, a bit of sugary malt and slight grassy/herbal/dank hoppiness in there too. Taste has only a glimpse of the citrus before opening up into some toasty grains and more prominent herbal and grassy notes. Light sweetness but bitterness prevails. Light body and genuinely 'poundable' (hence the ""All Day"" title?). Medium light carbonation. A solid IPA, wish there weren't so many other things I wanted to buy when I was in Michigan, more of this would have been acquired."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of the best (if not the best) lower abv beers I've ever had. It's just so flavorful and drinkable. I could pound these stubby bottles all day, and that's the point. Heading home after a long day of work, and cracking this beer open on a hot summer night on the deck is something to look forward to."
""
"Overall: Very light and pretty simple, but very drinkable and quite enjoyable on this warm day. I'm glad I came back to try this again as I could hardly taste it after drinking a couple Double IPAs on Friday night. Though, All Day Pale Ale would be a more fitting name for this beer."

"(D)- Its nothing to write home about, but definitely another solid IPA from the midwest."

"M: Massively refreshing and easy to drink. Lighter body with complex warming and aftertastes."

"O) While this is far from the beer nirvana that some of Founders other offerings provide a craft drinker. It is clearly as advertised, one heck of a session ale. I could drink these on the patio all summer. Gladly recommended."
"OVERALL: All day baby. All day. Solid IPA, always welcome ontap or the fridge. Would pair nicely with a spicy curry or some Mexican food."

"O: Decent pale ale. Weak hops in the taste redeemed slightly by a nice grainy malt backbone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is exactly as advertised. If you want a low alcohol, flavorful session beer, this is what you've been looking for. Fairly well balanced. They did a nice job of making sure the bitterness of the hops didn't overshadow the malt. I probably could throw back a 6er of this in a night."
""
""
"Easy to drink and refreshing. Had one after mowing the lawn today."
"O: Of course this is very easy drinking, they definitely accomplished that. A good amount of hops and flavor and the nose is fantastic. For what it is, I think Founders did a great job as usual."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear crimson body with very slight golden hue with a somewhat thin white head with little lacing. Floral, citrus (orange and pineapple) and pine aroma. Flavor is a touch tangy with mild malt presence with more of the same from the aroma in the flavor with the floral hops coming across more grassy. Lighter side of medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall the hop profile is complex which is accentuated by the mild malt presence."
"This is a quite enjoyable session 'IPA' that has a lot of nice flavor for lighter ale. To me, this drinks like a hoppy, American pale ale. I now regret only buying one six pack."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer, it's good for what they brewed it for. I think they could have gone a little more conservative with the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"I welcome that balance. Good job, Founders."
""
"Pours a rich yellow with a frothy white head that fades into lacing. Smell is fruity and sweet with the hop bouquet. A unique smell coming out that is very inviting. Taste has the subtle sweet and fruitiness, but the hop comes through in a big way, with a pine mixing in with the fruit notes. This is a lighter medium mouthfeel, a nice balance in flavors, good depth. Overall good flavor, a nice IPA that has no bitterness, and is very enjoyable."
"O: Well, its pretty drinkable / nice and tasty at 4.7%... definitely a good summertime IPA - I wish it came in cans so I could take it to the beach."
"A very simple, straightforward, boring low ABV IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A very nice IPA to enjoy when you feel like something that tastes very good, but is lower in alcohol than most IPAs."
""
"Definitely a stellar ""session"" ale!"
"O-a little disappointed. it could be deemed a session beer, but for the price, i'd rather stick to miller or coors."
"Overall this is easy and refreshing. Good beer for a hot day. I could drink these ""All Day"""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, All Day IPA is a clear, golden yellow color with a one finger, soapy, yellow-white head. Nose is all west coast hops, thick with citrusy grapefruit notes and resinous pine. The flavor is a bit more muted than the nose, the citrusy and resinous pine flavors are seeminly watered down, but are well balanced with the malt bill to leave something that does go down, well, sessionable. Mouthfeel is light in body with a medium carbonation. Overall, not my go-to IPA but if I was going to try to drink all day with my BMC buddies, this would definitely be a more flavorful alternative that you could actually drink more than a couple of (as advertised)."
"O- How do you make a hop bomb without killing your tastebuds? I don't know but Founders does."
"O: Refreshing and easy to drink, exactly as advertised. If this were available to me I’d drink it all day long. Thanks again jbck109!"
""
""
"D/O- Gotta bump up the drinkability a ton on this one. It packs the hop goodness without the alcohol to go with the average IPA/craft beer. Now if we could just work on the price a little...maybe a 12pack for $12ish?"
""
"Overall: Another nice beer by founders. If you have a 6er of this beer I would say you are ready for summer, grilling, and whatever else you do on a hot day besides drinkn good beer!"
"Classic pale ale here that is lighter on flavor but easy to drink."
"Golden orange color, white medium head, and not very much head retention or lace. Smells great. Sweet light malt blanketed in various hoppy aromas. Dark mouth-watering citrus, pungent woody pine sap, green apples, leaves, candied lemon, and various floral notes. Taste has a lot of pine, spruce, almost minty flavors mixed with citrus rinds, all with brisk carbonation and steady bitterness throughout. Texture is smooth with a bit of dry graininess. Resiny...in a good IPA kind of way where it meshes well with the bitterness. I enjoy this IPA. This could be a sessionable IPA I suppose."

"The founders All Day IPA is awesome....its Zombie Dust Light...coming in at 4.7% vs the 6.2% for ZDust and 8% for Holiday Sucks Ale. This beer is for anyone who enjoys the citra hop....the most amazing hop. The taste and smell of this beer is a perfectly blended pine and bitter citrus. The malt is just enought to give me a woody. Mouthfeel is lighter in body good carbonation... an absolute winner!"
""
"It pours a light golden color. Aroma is crisp, sharp and hoppy. Smells good. Tasty, too, with a very clear, very clean flavor of citrus-grassy hops and a sharp bitterness on the finish. I’d have another. With it’s low ABV I’d have a couple! Fantastic brew. I really enjoyed it."
"O: Good light IPA. Good citrus taste without the sweetness. Nice finish. Perhaps a bit on the light side but this makes a very nice summer drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An average session beer, I guess. Founders can do better for the style, but if I want a beer that tastes like this I'm picking Zombie Dust every time."
""
"A solid attempt for a session IPA, no doubt about that... But I'll take another 1.0 ABV to drink something more flavorful, if one less bottle. 3.5"
""
"O - The bottle says it all - ""Session Ale."" This is a nicely balanced, lower ABV IPA that seems perfect for an occasion when you want to knock back more than a few. Nice offering by Founders."
""
""
"O - Light and nice and very downable."
"The finish is simple, which is what you expect. I would drink this again, if someone else was buying."
""
""
"O-Overall a great beer highlighting Amarillo hops. Reminds me a hell of a lot of Gumballhead though, so not blowing me away in the originality department. However I love the idea of a hoppy session IPA. Too many alcohol bombs that prevent me from having ""a few"" on a sunny afternoon. so this doesn't really disappoint."
"Poured a clear amber with a tall white head. Mmm. The beer opens with a big hit of fresh hops, just off the vine. It's a rich piney perfume, with a juicy tangerine edge. The flavor has a biting grapefruit kick over a relatively light, but not thin, body. The hops are a touch more complex than 21st Amendment's Bitter American, but Al Day IPA is more drinkable. Man, I'd like to get a case of this for a long weekend. Delicious."
"Know what they were going for but it is just a miss for me. I would rather have less of bettter than this alternative."
"O: OK but not a repeat for me. I much prefer 21st Amendment's Bitter American for a low ABV brew."
""
""
"This beer pours a light bodied and very clear yellow gold in color with a soapy lacing around the glass. It poured exceptionally clean. The nose is very light and clean but also very fragrant. My guess is Amarillo, Centennial, and Cascade hops? It's very refreshing. Oh wow, the flavors too are very light and approachable. It's a little grassy and the hops shine. It's incredible how drinkable this beer is. It drinks light in body with a nice assertive hoppiness yet isn't dry at all. It drinks like a very light hoppy lager. I'm rather impressed. This is a perfect warm weather IPA. Founders needs to make this a summer seasonal ASAP."
""
""
"12oz bottle, pours golden with a slight orange tinge. Nice fluffy, white head leaves some lace and holds decent retention. Aromas are really pleasant - floral hop, lemon, grapefruit, and some biscuity malt. Tastes are refreshing with fruity hops providing a pungent grapefruit and lemon rind flavor. Some mild malt notes: biscuity and faint caramel. Mouth-feel is thin-to-medium and is bitter, sharp, and dry on the finish with a sharp cheddar aftertaste that is not off-putting. I think it's slightly over-hopped in the bitterness department, but overall I like this for what it is, but I'd rather have it's big brother, Centennial, if I was to choose an IPA from Founders."
""
""
"M: Light bodied."
""
"O - This is a very nice IPA, some say too thin but for me it is a good tasting beer, lots of hops but very little bitterness, very refreshing finish."
"O: Totally lives up to its' name. This literally IS and all day IPA. Great stuff."
""
""
"Overall: Great. Had this on tap last year in Chicago an thought it was excellent, and it's excellent from the bottle as well."
""
"Overall: Compared to regular IPAs, this feels thin, small, and weak despite the hefty hoppiness. As a session beer for hopheads, its great stuff. Really love the hops aroma/flavor."
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very good, easy drinking ipa. I always expect quality with Founders and was not disappointed."
"Taste-Initial gulp is a bit weak-kneed, then a nice rush of hops and fruity pine come in for a nice flavorfull finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but this is a ""sessionable"" IPA and would be welcome in the hotter months or at a backyard BBQ. Nice flavor and very refreshing."
""
"Founders Brewing Company is one of my favorite breweries. They aren’t the first to brew a lower abv IPA, but they did a nice job with it. It has a really nice flavor and is very, very drinkable. Sounds like mission accomplished to me. If you’re a fan of IPAs and are looking for something to drink over an evening, find a few bottles of this. It fits the bill!"
""
"Overall and very nice IPA. I like it less than centennial, but that is a high standard in my book."
"I've become a lightweight since losing a lot of weight last year, so I can see this beer becoming my savior, the one that lets me keep up with my boyfriend without becoming a slurring mess. Love this beer."
""
""
"All in all, Founders has produced a very drinkable IPA with this beer."
"Reminds me of an IPA I accidentally over-diluted; still has an ample hop bunch but the malt aspect isn't there. I think Leviation is better rounded beer that's actually lower in alcohol than this."
""
""
"I'm alwaya a fan of beers that have a lot of hop/citrus taste but not a lot of bitterness or extreme residual sweetness, so this fits the bill in that sense. But at the same time, compared to beers off the top of my head that I think are at least somewhat similar, like Daisy Cutter or Little Hump, I perfer those two to this. The biggest problem (and I didn't deduct for this) for me though is that if the point of this beer is to be ""sessionable"" (and, I would assume cost less to produce per batch) then why am I paying the same for this as I would for Red's Rye? Even making it just $1 or $2 less than their usual offerings would mean a lot IMO."
""
"Poured to about a one inch slightly offwhite head. Brew itself was brownish gold in color. Left a little lacing, but nothing to brag about. Had as light hoppy smell. Maybe a little sweetness going on. Not a real strong hoppy flavor noticed. There were notes of citrus and pine. Also had a quite strong bitter aftertaste. The bitter left as fast as it was noticed to me. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was good. I thought this would taste like Two Hearted, but there was no comparison. Two Hearted was better. But then again, Two Hearted with its higher alcohol content isnt (to me) a session beer."
""
"Overall- It's not the kind of IPA that will blast you away. You do have to give Founders credit though, this beer is exactly what it says it is."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I could definitely see drinking this all day during a BBQ on an 80 degree summer day. If I was in charge at Founders, this would be a May or June seasonal without a doubt. I wouldn't make this year round."
""
""
"Overall, could you imagine if all Sessions were this good?"
"O - a really enjoyable beer with is probably very sessionable. $11 for a six-pack isn't really what I look for in a session beer, though..."
""
""
"A great session beer. All day indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is decent, but it's not something I'm likely to get again any time soon. That said, it's easily drinkable and I'm not one to complain about an IPA with a reasonable abv being available."
"Overall: Keeping in mind this is a session ale, I think Founders does a good job with the All Day IPA. Sure it's not packed to the gills with flavor, but it's not supposed to be an in-your-face brew. It's cold out right now and I want to be sipping an Imperial Something-or-Other, but I think when I'm sweating myself silly in my air condition-less home this summer, I could go to this brew pretty quickly. 3.75/5"
"Poured from a bottle, this is a light golden color. It is fizzy with very light head. Smell is very light citrus and pine. Taste is very mild with a light hoppiness in the background. Not something overly complex, it is a nice session beer and probably something great to have in the summer."
"This is a good IPA. However, if I was looking to drink several beers for whatever occasion, I would probably choose something else. All Day IPA is definitely worth a try though."
""
"O - The name of this beer describes it perfectly. This is exactly what i'm looking for in a session beer. Lots of flavor refreshing mouthfeel and low abv. I could drink a whole six of this while playing a round of golf or fishing with no problem. For your next poker night be sure to grab a six pack of this."
"O-I am really not one for kicking back beers. I choose higher abv beers generally because I get very full fast. This beer though is a great median. It has like the taste of a great DIPA without the alcohol content. I may not always be in the mood for something like this but it gets my respect for what it is."
""
""
"Overall impression: Delivers as advertised. Nice approachable hoppy beer that you can enjoy a couple pints of. Highly recommended."
"Really nice beer here from Founders. Great aromas and flavors for such a small beer.. well done."
""
""
"Pours a nice light gold-to-copper color with a white head and a good amount of lacing. Smell is quite strong and hoppy with some excellent floral, citrus, and tropical notes. Taste draws back a bit, but is still quite nice. Light malt character, but really not too much. Mouthfeel is light and dry. I see drinking this one all summer.A Nice session summer brew."
""
"M - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation."
"There really aren't any flaws here, its just very underwhelming, I was expecting more of a dry hopped prescence. Should be Blah day IPA."
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 12/26/2011. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is mostly hoppy, the brew smells like citrusy (tropical fruit, orange peel, mango) and pine hops, along with a little bit of bready malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but for whatever reason it just doesn't taste quite as good as the aroma would lead me to believe. The flavors seem a bit watered down. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick, is well carbonated and goes down easy enough. However, at $10.99 a 6-pack I wouldn't buy it again since I can get better IPA's at that same price or cheaper (for example, Columbus IPA or Brew Kettle White Rajah). With that being said, I do think it's worth trying."
""
""
""
"Yellow gold with a bit of haze to it and a small, sticky pure white covering of a head. Mild sweet orange hop aroma - a light, but quality blend of floral, citrus, and pine. The flavor is again mild, but still showcases a nice selection of hops...fresh grass, pine, zesty citrus all over a bed of grain. Light bodied with a medium bitterness and finishing dry. Yeah, I could drink several of these. Hoppy pale ale? Light IPA? Whatever...tasty stuff!"
"O: Founders makes some great brews. This one is spot on with being a great tasting beer you can drink all day long. Hince the name. Great job Michigan Breweries keep them coming."
""
""
"Overall I thought that this was a pretty good beer and a damn good sessionable American IPA. This beer was light on the mouthfeel but full of flavor. It had very good drinkability that makes this beer live up to it's name, I could session this beer without getting bored with it and drinking it all day wouldn't be out of the question, it's smooth, not filling, full flavored and low in alcohol, everything you would want in a session IPA. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma it was really good and full of citrus hops. There wasn't anything that I didn't like about this beer but I think if a six pack was a dollar or two cheaper this beer would be in the fridge at all times. I will for sure be buying this beer again, I can see drinking a lot of this in the summer, especially on the disc golf course. I highly recommend giving this beer a shot if session IPA's are your thing, you shouldn't be disappointed. As usual with Founders this is another good and well made beer that is everything it is suppose to be and nothing it's not. It's nice to know that the brewery that gives me the big stouts that I love can also supply me with a great sessionable IPA that I can for sure see being a summer time barbecue staple. Before I had this beer The Wanderer from North Peak was my favorite session IPA, but now this beer is because it is better tasting. has a better aroma, and it isn't as bitter. Great job Founders I can see drinking a lot of this beer in the future."
"Pretty light bodied, but drinks damn near like water. Probably a bit thin, but for a session ale, all right. Better than session ale from Full sail by a long shot. For obvious reasons, pretty tame though."
"Light golden in color. Clear. Forms a small white head that quickly reduces to not much more than a ring around the edge. Some light lacing. Aroma is pretty good: lots of tropical hops and juicy citrus with just a bit of pale malts. Unfortunately the taste isn't nearly as good as the aroma. The malts are rather low and while the hops are certainly present, they almost seem out of place. It's not that the beer is lacking balance, it's just the the hops just don't taste as great as they smell. Body is thin with a bit of a spicy feel in the mouth. Mild-to-moderate bitterness. Overall, something just seems off with this beer. I love hops and this beer has plenty of them, but the lack of an appreciable malt backbone does nothing for them. Sure, it's easier to drink than most IPAs, but I really just wouldn't want to."
""

""
""
"Overall another great beer by Founders this one would be worth the 10 bucks a sixer if it ever went outside it's Michigan borders."
""
"It is great looking in the glass. It smells nice too. Tasteis a little metalic as is the aftertaste. I am not going to rush out and buy this for my guests (but I will get some Bitter American)."
"Overall – For a lower ABV IPA, there is quite a bit of flavor to it. That said, the body is a bit too thin and the flavor just is off somehow that I can’t put my finger on yet. Perhaps just a bit of a metallic aftertaste."
"O. A great summer beer that won't fatigue the palate or knock you on your ass if you have more than 4+ in a session. My only beef, which has been expressed by others, is that this beer strains hard to be considered an IPA. I guess it really doesn't matter, it's a nice effort from Founders nonetheless."
"O: A very sessionable IPA. The flavors are muted, but they are well balanced. That being said, beers like Pliney and Ephraim are more sessionable and have the flavor profile to boot. The fact that it comes in 6-packs is its major perk."
""
""
"D - It's a 4.7% Founders brew, how in the hell could this not be drinkable?! The taste is narrow and not terribly complex, but overall it's a well-done beer that has an exact point and purpose."
""
"Poured into a tulip. Sort of a nice light orange amber with a white foam. Dissipates very quickly to a small ring with a little lacing. The smell is a wonderful hoppy citrus with a bit of spruce. Taste is light, clean and fresh citrusy hops with a mildly bitter finish. Light mouthfeel with good carbonation. Overall great session IPA. I could easily see myself going through quite a few of these. "
"O: this is very refreshing and certainly fits the bill as an ""all day IPA", not going to go down the road of controversy that is associated with calling this a session ale, but the bottom line is that it is light, flavorful, easy drinking, and refreshing"
""
""
"O: Pretty much lived up to my expectations. There are better American IPA out there no reason to settle for a sessional, especially for the price."
""
""
"O- Easily one of the best sub 5% hoppy beers that I've had. I could see picking this up quite often over the summer."
"Overall this actually drinks a lot like a lager. It's very light and only a subtle bitterness. Very smooth as every Founders beer is. I think I was looking for something a little more and that's why I wasn't so impressed. As a nice easy drinking beer it's perfect."
"Pours clear and golden with a big light fluffy white head. Aroma has beautiful aromatic floral hops, some light citrus peel, and very little sweet malt in there. Easy drinking but holds a decent hop bite. Flavor is light citrus rinds, some light grass and pine. Very light mouthfeel, very little malt backbone, but still plenty of flavor. Medium high carbonation. True to what it us supposed to be: a good IPA that won't floor you if you're downing them all day long. Nicely done."
"O- A very nice beer with lots to offer in the way of a different style. I feel to have a light IPA as an option is a brilliant idea. I could drink this ALL DAY."
"I do not give a Schlitz for Founders All Day IPA. Incidentally, Schlitz is also 4.7% ABV (and a better bargain)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Enjoyable. I like it better than Victory Headwaters but not quite as much as the Lagunitas Day Time or the 21st Amendment Bitter American."
"O: with minimal bitterness (42 IBUs) and low ABV, this a perfect IPA to enjoy with disregard for your inhibitions. maybe it's just the label (an old Woody with a canoe strapped to the roof heading down some pleasant country road)... but i would very much like to be outside under a warm sun right now."

"Overall, great, flavorful session ale that brings nice hop characteristics to the table."

"O- The beer is quite drinkable, however, the metallic taste and high carbonation prevented me from wanting to drink a few in one sitting."
""
""
""
"O: This beer is true to its name: I could drink this all day. Light but intricate flavors, low ABV and a clean finish make this one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. Even easier to consume a quantity of this than cheap macro-lagers."

"Overall - Packs quite a punch for such a small beer. Impressive hop flavors, malts and smoothness without the ibu's or booze. What a great summer beer this is, founders got a perfect bbq on a hot saturday afternoon beer here."
"I have a special fondness like alot of people do for this GR brewery.Poured into a standard pint glass a dull medium golden with almost no head to speak of,I gotta say alittle unhappy with the pour.Tropical fruit-like hop aromas along with grass to give the hops more punch,a lightly sweet malt base underneath,nice hop complexity.Tangerine hops dominate the palate with mild caramel sweetness and toasted cereal grains underneath the good hop profile.Yeah this is a great American style session ale with its big hop presence,Iam gonna buy a few six packs before grillin season."

"This is a tasty, refreshing, light ale that has enough flavor to be fairly called an IPA. The flavor has a lot in common with the Founder's Centennial IPA and their Pale Ale- I'll be interested to try them side-by-side. Totally accomplishes what it sets out to do: be sessionable. It is not Centennial, it is not Huma-lupa, it is not Two-Heart. Camping trip beer, hot day beer. Summer porch beer when you want hops, not wheat, copper, not yellow, but definitely refreshment."
"What most of us old time beergeeks have been waiting for I know it's been done but it seems like those other canned hoppy offerings with lower abvs seem funny after a can or two and I don't really want anymore after a couple cans. This is the exact opposite and it's name happens to be All Day IPA. Pours into a nonic pint glass leaving two fingers of nice thick head behind, with a pale copper/orange body with a bright white head/okay maybe slightly off white. Fine intricate lacing left on the sides of my glass bewteen each sip, this is pretty amazing stuff going on in my glass. Aroma has pine, citrus, floral hops with a light biscuit malt sweetness complementing the barrage of dry hopped aromatics going on. So enticing with the smell of this beer, that you literally want to fall in the vat and start consuming. Flavor is light with a good mix of malts and hops not an overbearing beer yet it's still reasonably flavorful, citric notes, floral accents, earth hops breed full into a nice soothing bitterness and ample clean bready malts compromise the malt profile. Mouthfeel full on bitterness lighter bodied heavy carbonation that leaves behind ample bitterness. Overall like a said the beergeeks dream, nice hops without getting hit over the head by the alcohol lights out hammer."

"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a golden yellow-orange with a minimal pure white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine, pine hop, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, pine, pine resin, wood, and citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Sometimes beer names don’t make any sense to me, but this one made perfect sense upon trying it. I had heard from another guy who had tried it the night before and raved about how good it was. I just kind of nodded my head and told him that was cool. Not really expecting much I brought it to my nose to find a very pleasant aroma going on here. Everything in it was very pronounced and was quite intriguing. Upon taking a sip I realized why Founders named it this. The flavors were all really nice and pleasant, but they were quite light which made this a beer that one could *gasp* drink all day. Really well done brew from Founders this time around as I would be more than happy to stock up on this to drink around the pool during the summer. I suggest you get this on your palate soon if you have not already."

"overall- if doing a side by side with founders pale ale I really couldn't tell much of a difference. although I like this a little bit more then dry hopped pale ale. its nice that this has such a low abv, I look foward to drinking many of these in the summer. thanks again founders you did it again!"
""
"O- Good beer. Not sure if this should be classified as an IPA. More of a pale ale with its thin body, low malt bill, and bitterness. Reminds me of a lighter, less citrusy Zombie Dust."
"Pleasantly balanced citrus and pale malt flavors, grapefruit pith and dry crackers. Ample hoppy bitterness delivered via a light bodied feel. Lingering herbal grassy notes. Honestly this reminds me of local favorite Daisy Cutter a little bit. Could easily finish off a six pack over the course of an afternoon in the shade."
""
"Enjoy!"

"At 4.7% being a session ale, this has to be the most drinkable beer I've ever had in the craft beer world. This summer and fall will be great to be able to readily get one or two of these six packs to take on a camping trip, for an evening out fly fishing with some friends, etc. and not be wallopedlike some of the other beers. Don't get me wrong, I normally purchase the best tasting and highest abv beers I can find, but this will be an exception to that rule with the great taste, low abv, it can be enjoyed more often and more of it in one sitting than typical craft beers I buy."
"O- A very well made beer that drinks incredibly well. Very tasty. This is going to be consumed a lot in the summer."

"In terms of IPAs, its rather lackluster (actually more like terrible), but in terms of APAs, its actually pretty good. Im thinking we need a category change on this one. The balance is the difference."
"O- A solid session beer, probably just the thing for sitting at home and watching some TV with or for taking out in a cooler, the flavor isn't bad, but I think for Founders it's maybe a bit plain, I feel like a lot of reviewers who are talking about explosive hop flavor and awarding lots of perfect scores must be talking about a different beer."
"O- Decent IPA, quite easy to drink. I see this as an IPA for non-IPA people, I would consider it a pale ale with less malt myself. Good beer but nothing great enough to make me want to buy again."
"This one poured out as a nice looking clear golden yellow color with a foamy white head on top. The smell of the beer gives off some really nice hoppy citrus aromas. The taste of the beer was citrusy and bitter but not overwhelming at all. The mouthfeel was light and rather refreshing, definitely a session beer for sure. Overall this beer is one that you could drink several of and not get too filled up from it. It's a good brew sure to please many people."

"o - probably the most easy drinking beer i have ever had. the fact that i could have 3-4 of these in a night (or day) without falling down drunk just makes it that much more enjoyable. i see this being a regular inhabitant of my fridge."
"Overall Impression- A perfect example of this style! Didn't expect anything less from Founders. This is my first time seeing this brew from them and am wondering why?? Maybe it wasn't offered in the Missouri Market the past 2 years? Either way, looking for more! I suggest you do the same."

"Overall a decent IPA but not the best, if it was anymore bitter it should be classified as a ESB. It was semi sweet and had a great taste. I'm a big fan of IPAs but there are better ones out there, if this was conditioned a little longer it could definitely be a better beer."

"O - Damn near flawless, All Day IPA is a session ale packed with hop flavor and character that's exciting but not overwhelming or taxing after a few. It's not often I want to drink pint after pint of a beer but, I'd be overly willing to put six of these back. Founders has nailed it; All Day IPA is the quintessential American session ale!"
""
"o - overall a nice ipa, nothing earth shattering. glad i got to try it extremely fresh. i do get founders locally, not sure if this one will come to town, but i imagine so. i'd definitely reach for this one if i was looking for an ipa to drink all day (as advertised), but would definitely take double trouble over this one in a heart beat."
"4/30/12 edit-this beer is really growing on me. It's a great session beer. I bumped the taste up to a 4 and the overall up to a 4, as compared to my first review."
""
""
"O: a great IPA, especially with such a low abv. I could definitely drink these all day."
"Toasted malts and some lemon mineral water bitterness up front. Herbal, grassy hop flavors become weedier through the palate. Some pine in there too. Bitterness stays strong, and even gets a little aspirin-y in the end. Light malt presence with some caramel and fruit flavors. The hops definitely win this battle though. Very dry finish. Moderate body, with a little bit of a gassy, bubbly feel. Definitely tastes like a ""session"" IPA, with all the hops but less malt/alcohol. Ultimately, although I quite like this beer, I think it would really shine on cask; the carbonation is a little too prickly and gives the beer too much of a mineral water feel."
"This beer is insanely drinkable, while at the same time being one of the most uniquely hopped beers I have ever tasted. There are so many of the standard hop flavors that you usually find in IPAs, This one just combines them all in one beer."
""
"I am confused why this is an IPA, more of a standard pale ale."
""
""
"O: This stuff is great. Exactly what it says. The kind of beer I could drink all day. I am sure hardcore hopheads will not be satisfied by it, but I see this becoming a beer I keep stocked in the fridge."

"O-Great IPA if you're looking for an easy to handle IPA or just getting use to the power of hops. I'm lucky to have Founders in my backyard and recommend this to any visitor."
"The aroma was pungent and fresh, dripping with hop resin so bitter you could feel it through your nose. Very floral, with big notes of orange and tangerine, hints of grapefruit and lemon, with a bit of pine tar thrown in for good measure. This was what it was all about. The flavor was more f the same, and this could have been quite possibly the best tasting IPA I have ever had. Right up there with Sculpin for sure. Huge, sticky fresh hops, loaded down with candy coated sugar. Big notes here of orange all over the place. Lots of citrus of every conceivable kind just literally dripping in here. This is what I would imagine chewing on a still growing hop vine would be like. It was intensely fresh. Nice medium body, almost chewy at time"
"Light copper color with a fluffy white head. Thick rings of lacing. Strong pine and mild citrus nose with a strong biscuit and bread malt graininess. Robust biscuit malt body with grass and pine bitterness domianting throughout. Not as much citrus as the aroma, other than some light rind makes this is a little disappointgly bland; dry, earthy and bitter. Medium body with full carbonation. Nice for 4.7% but probably not something I'll seek out when it's packaged."
"O: Really great nose on this. The flavor isn't quite as good, but it's still enjoyable and at sub-5%, really easy to drink."
"O: I really enjoyed this brew. Great flavor, low ABV, and a beer that I could drink quite a few of. I would love to have this fresh on a hot summer day. Just what the doctor ordered. Skal."
"O - Surprising amount of heft and flavor for a beer with this ABV, great session beer that would go well with food."
"Overall, very drinkable, though the tea notes on the finish are a little off putting after awhile. Nice to see some more very flavorful, lower abv beers."
"O: All Day IPA drinks packs quite a bit of smell and taste for being a lower ABV beer. It feels a little too ""on the fence"" though, meaning it isn't quite a session beer or a proper IPA. Still, it is quite drinkable due to its simplicity and lower ABV. "
"D - Extremely drinkable. Very interesting IPA with as much flavor as it has with the rather low abv level. It is very flavorful and does not sacrifice flavor."
"O- Very drinkable. If you're looking for a hop forward IPA, this is the right drink."
"Pours a lightly hazed gold color, moderate cap of white head, decent sticky lacing. Scent is hop forward, lots of grapefruit with touches of pine resin, very faint malt presence in the nose. Taste is quite bitter and hoppy, grapefruit forward with pine resin and lemon. Some mustyness and again a faint malt presence. Took a look at the ABV's posted at the bar and it was listed at 4.8%, so that should justify the low malt backbone. Lighter side of medium bodied, lightly sticky and dry finnish. Tasted pretty good, but overall just lacked a little sweetness to cut the bitterness."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, tingly and biting on the tongue. Drinks insanely well, great balance and flavor - I really hope they bottle this soon."
"I found this to be a very tasty session beer. Easy drinking, yet ful of flavor. Please bottle (or can) this and sell it 12-packs for the summer!"
"O - I had a couple pours of this one, as it's just so easy to drink. Didn't totally blow me away or anything, but for what it is, it's def an excellent beer."
"O: Another great beer from Founders and one I would look for 6 packs of this summer if they release it (as I think they were planning to)."
"Enjoyed All Day IPA on tap at the Map Room. Poured into a pint glass. It pours a bright yellow with about an inch of nice white head. The aroma was strong citrus hops, mostly grapefruit. It had a strong heavy enjoyable aroma for a beer of its size. The taste was very citrus hoppy as well. There is a little bit of resiney hops, but not much at all, leaving for a very drinkable and approachable delicious IPA. The mouthfeel was medium light with good carbonation. This is generally what I am looking for out of an IPA. Overall a very good beer. It is well brewed and outstanding, especially for such a low ABV brew. Good work founders on another hit."
"this was amazing, i loved every sip. with the uber low ABV and stupid amount of hops, this is the jam and then some."
"Overall a great beer light refreshing and damn tasty. Surprisingly huge flavors for such a low ABV. Now I have to find a six pack"
"This poured pretty light, much less than solid orange. One reviewer said peach, and that sounds quite right to me. A little head, some retention, and decent lace. On the nose the biggest note is orange rind, with a good but not overpowering hop presence. In the mouth the orange rind is huge and contributes to a big, bitter profile. There is no doubt that this is an IPA in my mind, as it lacks the bigger malt backbone of something like Alpha King or SNPA. What malt there is is mostly caramelish, but the bitterness, including a long finish, is definitely at the fore here. The feel is a little thinner than most IPAs but given the low ABV that was probably the intention. I was a big fan of this beer, maybe even more than Centennial IPA. Can't wait to see this released more widely."
"D - The name is appropriate. I finished my pint in about 15 minutes. Carbonation is a bit too high for it to be a home run session for me, but it's at least a stand-up double."
"Very drinkable and pretty darn good, but than its rating right now."
"D- A very drinkable IPA. A low abv of 4.8%, makes this a joy in the IPA category. I was told that Founders is in the process of bottling it, and if it is the right price, I just found myself a perfect summer beer."
"Very drinkable, as intended, but also very boring. I am really not too pleased with the mild/session beer fad that's erupting this year. I have yet to taste a good beer brewed with this intent lately. Give me something with good flavor or at least keep the mediocrity in Michigan."
"D - refreshing and not high in alcohol so goes well with food. If I can ever find it in Indianapolis I will drink it all day"
"D- Although this was a hop forward beer it seemed a little muted at times in the nose. The flavor was big but not over the top I thought. A nice balance between sweet and bitter with the ABV really lending to the drinkability. Overall a nice sessionable beer from Founders."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Quite malty with many floral notes. Good to sip and enjoy. It can be a little too bitter at times. It is medium to light bodied. Not one of my favorite offerings from Founder's."
"Pours a golden yellow with lots of white head. Lots of great hops on the nose. Some solid citrus and grapefruit smells. Very complex. A lot going on. Tastes similar to the smell. Tons of grapefruit and citrus hopes. Light and highly carbonated. A solid beer and I am VERY glad Founders is bottling this one"
"D: As a low alcohol beer, the ethanol definitely doesn't come into play, but I wouldn't feel like another of these. The taste was pleasant for a bit, but without being particularly complex or a great taste, drinkability is just average."
"Poured a clear, light golden. A thin, off-white head clung a bit. Smell was hops superlative; bubble-gum, pine, pineapple (very tropical-smelling). Taste echoed the smell very nicely, with grapefruit and fresh-cut grass coming to the forefront. The malt body is very mild on this beer - mostly it tastes like a dry-hopped, light pale ale. Mouthfeel is very nice, lots of carbonation, yet smooth. Once again, I tasted it as light on the malts, but seemed suitable for what the beer was. Reminded me in spirit to Stone's Levitation Ale, but the dry-hop was much more successful, imo. Super easy to drink, and a darn enjoyable beer that appealed to the hop-head side of me."
"D- I suppose this is a fairly easy to drink beer. I was a bit disappointed in this one and thought it was rather boring."
"Ridiculously drinkable beer. The flavors of an IPA in a 4.5% pale is hard to beat. Could easily drink several of these in a sitting without worrying about intoxication."
"I think the best way to describe the drinkability would be with an anecdote. My good friend and fellow BA TCGoalie lives in GR and frequents the tap room with his wife. They have a favorite server, who once described this beer as ""crushable"" while making a beer guzzling gesture. That is exactly what this beer is. A hop lover like me could crush these like a frat boy would BMC, and enjoy every minute of it. I am a sucker for hoppy pale ales, and this one was right up my alley."
"I found everything about this beer to be average. I tend to ride my bike to the brewery alot and when I get there this is one of those beer that I drink to only quench my thirst. It is typical and would be a good beer for someone that was not expecting the explosion of flavor that you typically get from founders. This would be something that I would recommend to some that typically does not drink microbrew and was at founders with me."
"D: love that this is under 5% abv."
"Pours a nice light gold-to-copper color with a white head and a good amount of legs. Smell is quite strong and hoppy with some excellent floral, citrus, and tropical notes. Grapefruit and mango stand out. Taste draws back a bit, but is still quite nice. Light malt character, but really not too much. Mouthfeel is light and dry. Drinkability is very nice. I'm really glad the trend of these lighter abv, highly-hopped ales seems to be catching on both with pale ales like this one, as well as quite a few hoppy wheats. Bravo to Founders; this was well deserving of its GABF medal."
"On tap at Founders. Poured into a tall almost pilsner style glass. Golden amber color with zero real head poured. Good aroma of hops but not really citrus or piney but almost fruity type hop aroma. Fairly hop forward but pretty light. Like the hops. The back end falls apart a little for me. Lighter mouthfeel. Not bad overall."
"A clear light golden straw color body with a small fizzy white head , short lasting with slight lacing . Aroma is grassy , lightly sweet , with hints of corn husks and pineapple . FLavor is lightly bitter , with lemon grass , corn , pineabble , and maybe a bit of honey , a dry finish with a slight lingering bitterness . Crisp dry mouthfeel , light to medium body , and quite sessionable . A slightly odd beer but quite sessionable and it grows on you as it warms ."
"D: a job well done on a very different brew. I know corn has a bad rep, but this is fantastic. Definitely worth a shot if you are in town."
