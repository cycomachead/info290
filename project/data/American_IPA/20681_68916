Bright yellow-orange color, slightly hazy, good head. Aroma is quite hoppy, tropical and dare I say West Coast. Flavor was bitter, tropical, hoppy and again possibly West Coast. Probably one of the best IPA's from the east coast I've ever had, wish I could have brought home bottles.","ArrogantB","Oct 25, 2014"

It's still fantastic but I think that over the years it's lost a bit of character.  No complaints though.  One of the MBC beers that's actually worth the price tag.","Immortale25","Oct 20, 2014"

The pricetag isn't friendly (as is the Maine way) but if you're looking for a quality pour, look no further.","alexbutler","Aug 29, 2014"

And I can hardly stand to drink it. I usually love apas and ipas with a toasty malt base. But the earthiness and dryness just make it hard to drink and not the most appetizing.","SportsandJorts","Aug 13, 2014"
4.48,1.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Carbonation is moderate and keeps this beer flowing smoothly while citric brightness keeps it from drying. It does get drier as the hops keep coming, but it's creamy up front before going clean and semi-dry in the middle. Crispness keeps up the whole way. It eases a little in the middle as far as the body, but never thins out.","Brenden","Aug 13, 2014"

The nose is thick which marginally hampers freshness, plenty of pine, herbal matter, the white grapefruit adds to overall punch, same for the white pepper element, the cocoa and malt cloaked, thickly layered nectarine, pineapple, guava, peach fruit scents, not going for finesse but comes off as a gentle steamroller. Full-bodied, tangy and biting, even the carbonation has a chip on its shoulder, steady push towards the throat. More tangerine and orange mixed into the grapefruit. The floral element softens a few rough spots. Earthy and close to minerally or metallic. The fruit pulls back, apricot, peach pit and some pineapple, green apple. As in the nose the malts wait until the 11th hour to arrive. Piney qualities add to bitterness. This is no messing around, no smiling, just business, type of beer.","farrago","Aug 05, 2014"

Smells of malt, sugar, Hops, and citrus (mostly grapefruit). Tastes just as it smells, with first impression being the malt, then an earthy sugary taste, lastly the citrus lingers as you swallow. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with moderate carbonation (a little less than I usually like in IPAs). Overall a good IPA but not one I'd go out of my way to get, I much prefer the King Titus porter or dinner.","anthony23cippy","Aug 04, 2014"

Beautiful orange with amber to ruby hues, big towering and thick just off white head that stays atop the beer till nearly the end and deposits big sticky and chunky lacing. Aromas burst from the glass alive with grapefruit citrus like notes and slightly sweet tropical aromas. Initially your met with sweet malt flavor with a wave of hop flavor bringing big citrus and tropical favors. Malt sweetness hangs in just to right before the finish which brings on some teeth clenching bitterness and that amazingly bright hop flavor. Mouthfeel starts amazingly lively with the carbonation with a medium body. It bursts into a creamy feel then finishes completely dry and compliments that great hop flavor and bitterness bringing an amazing drink ability. This is a world class IPA that has it all figured out.","HopBomb515","Aug 03, 2014"

The malt perhaps suffers in this one-sided focus, and that powdery/chalky character, while weird, is not really off-putting in the least. Another (or was it the first - I'm too lazy to look that up) decent IPA from this brewery - glad to see them available around here.","biboergosum","Jun 17, 2014"

Citrus is mild, moderate bitterness, strong hop flavor but not the kind I love and gets a touch sweet. It is heavily carbonated, moderately soft but a touch of syrup.","cpetrone84","Jun 15, 2014"

4.21,-4.3,3.75,4.5,4.25,4,4,"Milestone review (#500) and it came down to a Maine Beer Co. brew versus one from Green Flash. Since I am pretty pumped that we just got another wave of four Maine beers hitting Alberta, here goes. Different array of hops from Another Round and this one is rooted more firmly in citrus and herbal territory, with Another Round skewing more tropical and perhaps more pungent overall (see that review). This one is a cloudy lemon yellow with a rich beige head, a matrix of smaller bubbles encapsulated in a layer of larger ones. A remarkable fresh hop aroma greets the drinker, pineapple, mixed citrus and fresh spruce needles, resinous with hints of berry. Palate is a sublime mix of orange/grapefruit/tangerine/lime rind and juice, pineapple, rock candy, baby aspirin, sage, red berry, guava, and a whiff of burnt toffee. Largely a hop flavor and aroma showcase but with enough malt to add a balancing sweetness to the equation. Very bitter but said bitterness is ultra-clean, buttressing an assertive and juicy finish of mentholated cough candy, lime, and flower shop. Body on the low end of moderate with the carbonation on the high end. Another clear cut masterpiece from this brewery, sophisticated and nuanced yet bold of flavor. The worst thing anyone can say about these guys is the high price point, which frankly I will keep paying so long as the quality remains this high. The social and environmental initiatives these guys take only sweeten the deal.","CalgaryFMC","Jun 14, 2014"

Golden in color with a very serious head that was quite intense. Aroma is a bouquet of citrus and floral with some mild earthiness mixed in too. Tastes of wonderful grapefruit, some hops and citrus notes as well. Virtually no bitterness and extremely well balanced, complex, and very easy to drink. This ""lunch"" is somewhat medium bodied, creamy, has a little warming alcohol at the end, and finishes cleanly on the palate. Overall, this american ipa, truly is worthy of trying and is masterfully crafted!","dpgoblejr","Apr 29, 2014"

It tastes astoundingly fresh - almost in a newly-bottled homebrew sort of way (albeit a very, very good homebrew). It may not be the biggest citrus-bomb out there, but it has a definite charm in its clean and balanced approach to the American IPA.","hail_seitan","Apr 27, 2014"

There was an excellent hop profile up front with nice notes of orange, lemon zest, and pine. Then it finishes with a nice balance with a little bit of malt that comes across as a light but smooth caramel. This beer is by no means sweet though and definitely focuses on the hops. Appropriate carbonation and great aftertaste. I could drink this all day.","glazeman","Mar 28, 2014"

The first time I had it, the hops didn't come forward at all, I had to wait for them. This time with the fresh bottle, there was a blast of hops on the nose that gelled upon tasting into a very smooth, refreshing drink, with a bite.

I was shocked with the results. The beer had completely changed into a one dimensional zesty flavor (mainly of lemons and faded grapefruit), and had become grainy and earthy with none of the juiciness I loved the first bottle for. This falls off rapidly, it seems, and I'd warn anyone of getting one of these to make sure that you know what you're getting is as fresh as possible. For that matter, it's a tricky beer for me to want to revisit. I would love to try this fresh on tap, one of these days...","magictacosinus","Mar 04, 2014"

Lots of hop flavor for the hop heads out there, but also easily drinkable and approachable for those who may not be a huge fan of the style.

The smell is a citrus hops and while it's not overpowering, it's really nice. The taste is similar, hoppy on the citrus side, very little malt, not really bitter at all, it's very, very good and just what you want in an IPA. Mouthfeel is a touch watery, but still great. All said, this is an excellent IPA and one that I would drink often if it were easier to find and if it were priced reasonably. It's similar to Flower Power and since FP is easy to find and reasonably priced, I'll probably never buy this one again.

The taste is almost as juicy and fruity as the aroma, but it quickly fades into a more bitter, piney flavor. Mouthfeel is ok, nothing spectacular with good carbonation levels.

Smell is textbook with strong citric and wet hop aroma along with a caramel and bready malt sweetness. Taste and mouthfeel follow as I get a strong taste of hops, mostly citric with touches of plush tropical fruit and grape (pretty rare for a ""single IPA"") but nothing overpowered the tastebuds and the balance with the grainy, bready, and sweet malts is great. The hops are the star but don't dominate and the beer finishes crisp and dry but doesn't dry out tongue making this a dangerous session beer.","clayrock81","Jul 14, 2013"

Nose was floral and citrus with lemon up front. There was also some pine, grassiness and apricots. Taste was well-balanced with citrus, pine, but with the malt background evident and pleasant. Mouthfeel is creamy and dry but not overly bitter. Finish did not have much bitterness or hop bite either. This is a well-balanced offering I will absolutely try again.","regspeir","Jul 13, 2013"

3.72,-15.5,3.75,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,"Overall it's an enjoyable IPA. Much like Peeper Ale, the malt character avoids a heavy caramel component and the hops are intriguing. Simcoe appears to be a brewery favorite variety, along with perhaps amarillo. Do I think it's a top 10 IPA? Not in my mind, but that's personal preference. This is a well-made beer with enough originality to separate it from the abundance of American IPAs on the market.","jimlin","Jun 29, 2013"
4.35,-1.1,5,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"Lunch pours a very clear deep gold with a beautiful head that really lingers. Fruity orange citrus and pine in the aroma with a bit of sweetness. The orange gives way to grapefruit which leads nicely into the flavor. The grapefruity hops come on strong in the flavor with just a bit of sweetness. The malt is dominated by a strong, but not overpowering bitterness. Overall this is a really nice IPA especially for a couple months old. I imagine it's hard to beat right off the bottling line.","ericj551","Jun 28, 2013"

Not sure if it has dropped off with time or started out mellow. Not bad, but was expecting much more here. Taste is solid, but I have the feeling this started out much more than what it is now. Not getting any of the citrus or pine that others have described and what you'd expect of a west coast IPA. The bottle says drink within 90 days, personally I think the limit is much shorter than that. Still a solid drink, just doesn't have the shelf life it says it does.

It has a killer hop nose that boasts of citrus hops; probably citra or simcoe. The malts lend an adequate base and complimentary aroma. The taste is good. It has incredible balance for a beer with so much hop character. It's tasty as hell with loads of residual citrus hop flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine.

Head eventually settles into a solid, quarter inch cap with delicate strands of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Nose expresses notes of tropical fruit, a hint of rind and a light graininess. Taste consistent with nose, but a bit more muted. There's also a slight medicinal bitterness that lingers at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation, and a slight acidity. Finish leaves a light, residual prickle between quaffs. Overall - no where near worth the $7.49 price tag. A decent IPA, but not all that mind-blowing an experience.

Honestly, you'd think this was a top double IPA from the look and smell. The taste is the best IPA I've had. Typically im not all that impressed with IPAs since double are so much more loaded and well balanced, but this is close to a double in a standard IPA skin. Well balanced is the definition of this beer. The hops, citrus and sweetness blend so nice with a smooth aftertaste. Maine Brewing Company continues to impress me more and more and they appear to be the big up and comer. As far as this IPA, its the best on the market.","sjones5045","Jun 01, 2013"

I was SOOO excited to try this one, and the second I took a sip, my immediate impulse was to check the bottled-on date to see if this was fresh....a definite red flag. Despite a bottling date of 5/7/13 (050713), a mere 19 days old, this beer tasted a bit lifeless. Pleasant no doubt, but not even close to comparable to some of the greats of the style. I went into this beer thinking it would be comparable to Pliny, a beer I am very familiar with, but this one fails to compete. While the nose was out of this world, that was the only stellar aspect of this brew. Reading some of the other reviews, I am really questioning my palate right now...Might come back and edit this one after I crack my other bottle. Maybe I am still coming down from my cold...","DmouthCaliBrewz","May 25, 2013"

4.96,12.7,4.75,5,5,4.75,5,"Bottled on 5/21/13; poured into a Bell's nonic pint. I didn't seek this beer, it sought me and demanded that I consume it. Pouring itself into the aforementioned vessel, it jumped out of its holding container to exclaim, ""I am IPA; marvel at me."" A huge, two-finger cap of foam gives way to myriad lace patterns resembling broken guitar strings, frayed curtains, and shower-glass film residue. The nose is permeated by a citric cornucopia that is backed by just enough malt to create a majestic balance of hop perfection. To characterize the taste would never do this beer any justice, as words pale in comparison to the sheer pleasure that follows the first sip. As I consumed more, I began to sense a tectonic shift within the craft beer industry. This isn't just Maine Beer's version of a West Coast style IPA; this is their version of a better one. You know the brewer has struck a chord when you can hear the cherub and the seraphim rejoicing holy, holy, holy while you're drinking it. Maybe none of it was real. Maybe I woke up one morning and imagined what the perfect IPA would taste like. All I know is that this version of IPA is without rival. Rumors have already surfaced that it can re-grow hair on bald men, and resurrect lifeless medical patients from their catatonic state. You know what, I believe them. If you're fortunate enough to get your hands on this brew, consider yourself among the chosen. Ladies and Gentlemen, Lunch is served.","weiserr","May 24, 2013"

Is this exponentially better than the numerous amounts of hop-forward American IPAs, probably not, but amazing good and worth a try at least once.

It is fresh and light, opposite again from what I would expect with a name like LUNCH. I am impressed and thoroughly enjoyed drinking this beer. I can see why some comments I've read say this beer is watery, it does feel light on your palate and depending upon your mood some beers will speak more to your taste. That said would I enjoy a lunch with just a bit more malt body sure, but I also can appreciate what has been crafted in this bottle. There are many BIG IPAs on the market so therefore I believe there is also a place for a well balanced well crafted refreshing IPA. Bottled on 3-26-13.","B-Stein","Apr 05, 2013"

Even with >1 month of age on it the nose presents dank grapefruity hops with a good backbone sweetness. The taste is initially grainy & sweet, but then the juicy/bitter hops kick in and create a savoring/balanced APA. The potent grapefruit in the nose and taste do not translate into the mouthfeel, which has more grainy sweetness and subtle, non-lingering bitterness as an afterthought. I taste more of a lingering graininess than hoppiness. It could afford to ferment out more sugars to dry out the finish, but I think that might distort the juiciness of the fresh hops. This beer is very distinctly hoppy, highly drinkable when fresh. The beer could maybe afford a bit more attenuation, but that's just personal preference.","ThePorterSorter","Mar 25, 2013"

At each aspect of the sip, or with a slightly warmer temperature, the hops seem to take on a different persona. Soap, pine, citrus, and herbals all show up at some point through the tasting. This helps to keep the beer refreshing and seemingly new to the end. Everything else about this beer embodies the inherent “clean and simple” attitude of this brewery, and when coupled with the basic complexity of the hops, makes for a delicious beverage. Dare we say, our first thought at the first sip was ”Pliny”?!","TheBrewo","Feb 20, 2013"

Lunch manages a similar level of hop flavor and malt backbone with only 7% ABV. This blows the competition out of the water. The only drawbacks are that Lunch isn't sold in 6-packs and isn't always available, making it more like specialty DIPAs than other IPAs.

It smells fantastic, too, and the taste is great—not perfection but I really can’t knock it much. Every IPA is different and this one does what it does very well: not blindingly bitter, but with a great flavor and a fantastically dry-hopped aroma, with a nice body and excellent look thanks to some good bottle conditioning. This is a great beer. Too expensive and hard to find to make it a regular, but a nice treat when it’s fresh.","fmccormi","Oct 03, 2012"

Pours a slightly hazy orange copper color with a two inch off-white head that laces well throughout and settles into a nice creamy-looking top. The aromas are rich tropical fruit, citrus, sawdust and a bit of malty sweetness. On the palate, it is full of flavor - pine sap, cedar, earthy spice and a nice counterbalance of ripe fruit; pineapple, grapefruit, and a bit of mango. The finish is long and woodsy with a good bitterness bite. A bit overrated as I’ve had better IPAs, but this was a solid beer nonetheless.","CuriousMonk","Sep 24, 2012"

The color is really gorgeous and I am loving the two finger width head that lasted for quite some time. The smell is beyond heaven with its fruity punch. Mango, papaya, and a wonderful pop of pine are the dominant smells here, but the malts are also there with a very slight biscuit. There’s even a slight bite of alcohol in the back of the smell, along with a classic bitter bite. On the taste there is a lighter bite of fruit. Mango and papaya are still dominant, but there is also the classic tinge of grapefruit in the taste. Malt is light and biscuity, but definitely a side show to the delicious hops of this beer. Mouthfeel is also to die for with velvety smoothness. Carbonation is effervescent in the start, but mellows out instantly into a sweet caress on the tongue. The mouth is left with some nice saliva along the sides of mouth and great dry bitter streak on the top and bottom of the mouth. The afterfeel is a little too dry for my taste, but still pleasant. Overall this is an awesome IPA with terrific fruitiness and a dry streak. This is a must drink, and is up there with the best IPA’s of the East Coast. This one doesn’t top Heady Topper, obviously, but it is quite tasty and a tremendous example of the style. Drink this beer.","Maxwell","Sep 20, 2012"

One of the things that really stood out in this IPA to me was how well the citrus flavors and pine flavors balanced with each other without finishing too bitter. This is definitely one of my new favorite local IPAs right up there with HF, Heady Topper, Lawson's and others. I'm not saying it's as good, but definitely in the same league.

Pours a slightly hazy deep golden amber color with a huge meringue like head that leaves lots of stickies on the way down. This smells incredible! Grapefruit, pine, resin, a bit of tangerine or orange, and hardly any barley to be found. The flavor follows the aroma obviously. There's a splash of bready malt somewhere in the beginning before the resinous pine and citrus onslaught. Nice tropical fruit flavors coming through along side the dank sticky pine and resin. Finish is fairly dry with a pleasant lingering hoppy bite. Medium to light body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. If this beer wasn't so damn hard to get and so highly priced I would drink these all the time, its a beautiful beer. Maine beer, you make wonderful brews, but the 16oz bottles and your high price point turn a lot of people off. /end rant","johnnnniee","Jul 06, 2012"

Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a one finger off-white head that remained throughout the glass. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, floral, and floral hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, earth, spice, earth hop, floral, floral hop, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really happy to get the chance to finally try this one and for good reason. Upon pouring it into the glass I put my nose right up to it. I was surprised at how nice this brew smelled on first inspection. Really well balanced and all the right notes in all the right places going on here. The flavor was pretty nice too, but just wasn’t as balanced as the aroma unfortunately. The earthy note felt a little invasive to me, but it didn’t hurt the brew at all. Definitely worth your time to try or seek out if you have never had it and call yourself a hop-head.","thagr81us","May 31, 2012"

Great head retention, too. Clings all over the glass as you drink. Aromas are citrus-hop blend that smells amazing, with lime, orange, and grapefruit blending with the pine, fresh cut grass, and resin to entice you right into the glass. Flavors are rich and resiny. Hop forward with a follow up blast of tart grapefruit keep your taste buds standiing at attention. There is a subtle caramel backbone that supports all the other profiles, which is exactly what it should be doing. Peppery and roast qualities at the end of the palate transition into the aftertaste, where a resiny and bitter kick displays the hops presence once again in this gem. The finish is clean, smooth, and only slightly drying. Amazing. Utterly amazing brew!","GarthDanielson","May 22, 2012"

Hop aroma is excellent with a bouquet of herbal and floral and a touch of pine. Not picking up much in malts, but in fragrant beers like this do you really care. First sip bodes quite bitter and dry with a floral taste essence. Not as pungent as the nose leads us to believe. Caramel malts are found towards the end with a low level of diaceytl, thats not an issue here since it is quite low. This beer finishes smooth and with a semi-dry after taste. Pleasing to look at, smell and drink although the flavor is a bit muted still excellent none the less. I'm jumping on the MBC bandwagon right now.","micromaniac129","Feb 07, 2012"

Tame bitterness, though the flavor flogs the taste buds for a while. Nice hop bite with citric and herbal flavors, and some spice in the middle as the dry maltiness tries to rise above. Apple and pear fruitiness, warming alcohol and graininess try to stave off the hop flavor, but it just keeps pushing along.

About an inch of fluffy, pillowy, pure-white head develops, but dissipates after a minute or so; gobs of lacing remain. The aroma is of spicy hops, pine resin, orange citrus, lemon zest, various grains (straw, hay, wheat), and a muddled earthen sensation. It tastes of spicy hops, bitter/piney hops, various citruses, straw, and wet earth (read dirt, but in the best possible way; strange, yes). It is surprisingly delicious (or unsurprisingly, given your expectations; either way, it’s damn tasty). Mouthfeel is crisp, and finishes clean.

Although an amazing beer, I had my hopes up for one of the most amazing IPAs considering how fast it flies off the shelf, and it's good, but I would drink some easier to find and cheeper beers before I scoured the state for this.

Not the very prettiest beer but what a smell. Huge citrus and pine, so fresh. Can't get over how fresh, piney and citrusy this smells. Big hop flavor up front, resinous, pithy pine, some grapefruit like citrus. Bitter mid-palate through the finish. Obviously malt plays second fiddel here, but its just enough to balance the extreme hops. Kinda dryish finish, not cloying from over hoppiness. Just a hugely successful beer by Maine Brewing.","pmlondrigan","Oct 02, 2011"

The color of almost liquid copper sits right below the bubbles. The sweet smell of juicy fresh hops hasn't stopped since opening and only gets better as you get a strong whiff from the glass. you get tastes of citrus and slight pine and sweetness from the malt but it's not overwhelming at all, it's a complete compliment. The mouthfeel is full of lively carbonation and leaves your mouth dry after each sip, making you long for the next one. Overall this was an awesome beer that I would live to have again.

Ends with dry, semi-bitter pine hops, a touch of spice and a bit more citrus sweetness. Really crisp and compact flavor profile, but allows you to sense the different layers in the beer.

4.42,0.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"O: A very good East coast IPA, this one offers up an awesomely perfumed nose, lightly sweet malts on the palate and a wonderful blend of floral and citrus hops in the flavor. Another hit from Maine Beer Company.","Florida9","Jul 26, 2011"
4.62,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O-Simply put, this is one of the best IPA's I've experienced. Refreshing, citrusy, bitter and all-round exactly what I look forward to (i.e. not much malt backbone). I just wish it was not so expensive ($6) for a pint bottle (purchased from VT)...for me, I wish I could get a bomber for that price...but a good beer is worth it...exceptional!","threeviews","Jul 26, 2011"
4.33,-1.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This stuff brings new meaning to the saying ""Let's have some Lunch."" It pours a clear gold topped by over a finger of marshmallow foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, orange peel, light pine, mild caramel, honeydew, light flowers, and a decidedly light whiff of mint. The taste brings in more of the same, though the caramel is a touch sweeter, and some cantaloupe and light apricot have been added, bringing a more-than-welcome extra bit of fruitiness to the proceedings. Damn, this stuff is tasty! The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, a great IPA, one I'm really glad I was able to try.","TMoney2591","Jul 24, 2011"
4.08,-7.3,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"Even with two months on it, there is no doubt that this has quite the vivid and well balanced hop profile to it and a pretty smooth body overall. It’s just a shame that this ended up showing as much heat from the ABV as it did. I knocked my grade down a bit based on this experience with it, but I’d be willing to tango with another fresher bottle of this. The potential is definitely there.","Kegatron","Jul 21, 2011"
4.15,-5.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Beer is way thinner than I expected, finishes mildly dry with moderate bitterness. The beer is chewy up front with a sulfury and sweet sort of hoppiness that carries through to the midpalate. The beer is pretty good, just thinner than I hoped but I would have it again. A mighty fine IPA.","drabmuh","Jul 12, 2011"
4.03,-8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"O - A very solid IPA, but nothing to go all that crazy over. It's good, just not world-class, IMO. An enjoyable go-to beer if you're looking for an IPA, no doubt.","Sean9689","Jul 12, 2011"
4.18,-5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D - A very nice IPA from the East Coast that I suspect was even better 6 weeks ago. Still it's aged remarkably well and is quite hop-forward. I'd gladly have this one again.","MasterSki","Jul 10, 2011"

4.08,-7.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"A big bubbly head stands on top of an extremely carbonated copper/orange body. These bubbles will not settle down. About two fingers of head. Nose is sweet bread and tropical fruits but with some pine as well. Light and balanced but the aromas still stand out. The flavor is completely different than I expected from the nose. Malts are sweet and roasted fruity like an imperial but on the light side. Hops are a mix of pineapple and spicy herbal. It finishes fruity and dry. The dryness is a mix of piney fruit and malt tartness. Creamy and fruity body with a bitter but thirst quenching finish. A large amount of head stuck around until I was finished.","DrinkingDrake","Jul 04, 2011"
4.2,-4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"O- After having Zoe a few weeks ago, I was expecting this to be just as good, and it almost is. This is a very refreshing beer that is well balanced, but still has that nice hop presence that I'm looking for in an IPA. I hope Maine Beer Company keeps up the great work, as I will be looking for more of their beers in the future.","JoshVandy","Jun 30, 2011"

Bitterness is low here, the palate is dominated by the hop flavor. Malt character is subdued, there's not much here apart from a mild sweetness. Drying on the finish, there's a mild resin character and plenty of citrus flavor. The mouthfeel is sublime. Softly carbonated, this is expertly conditioned. Redolent and resplendent, this is an excellent IPA. Thanks again, John!","DefenCorps","Jun 24, 2011"
3.98,-9.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"O: Very good IPA, and although my review does not say it, there is just something I don’t absolutely love about it. It’s really good, but not my favorite. Thanks again Michael for sending me these!","scottfrie","Jun 21, 2011"
4.65,5.7,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O: Maine Brewing hit a home run with this one. Honestly I put this up there with Sculpin and Blind Pig. It might be even better when super fresh. Do yourself a favor and pick up one of these (if you can, they disappear at an incredible rate).","Dope","Jun 19, 2011"
4.5,2.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The first one of the night I wanted some lighter fare to get things going in the right direction and this one definitely did the job for me for sure. Pours out a nice medium amber color with a light head of white that caps the top rather nicely and leaves a smooth and even layer of lacing. Aroma is nice piney hops that mix in and mingle with a smooth and delicate orange note and a touch of a light malty base. Very clean and crisp flavor, light body is more then adequately carbonated and left no doubt in my mind as to how good this one could be. Nice biting hops up front are quickly subdued by a light buttery taste and an earthy, piney freshness that cuts right through. Smooth as silk and overall just a very solid and drinkable IPA.","mikesgroove","Jun 18, 2011"
3.91,-11.1,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Hazy amber color with a big white head the retains very well. Smell is of pine and grapefruit.

This was a pretty tasty beer.","badbeer","Jun 18, 2011"
4.41,0.2,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The hop is the story of this beer as to be expected. There is also a strong alcohol bite to the taste. The malt is present but plays second fiddle. The body is spot on. Pretty good combination for me. A classic IPA.","smcolw","Jun 17, 2011"

I decided to drink a second bottle to make sure. the second bottle showed me that it's not a knock-your-socks-off kind of beer, but it's extremely well balanced and delicious to boot. Probably one of the best examples of the East coast IPA, and at $7-$8 for the 500mL, it's a solid find.","Goblinmunkey7","Jun 09, 2011"
4.15,-5.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a beautiful sunset color. Thick off white head that lasts awhile, webs of lacing. This is one nice smelling IPA! Tropical fruits, and citrus. Imagine a hop marmalade if you will. The flavors follow the nose. Pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, and pepper. Light to medium body, it is just a little thin for my liking. Its a bit warm.

A good balance - with a sweeter malt base that never overpowers, allowing a clean, lightly pine bitterness to follow through to the end - if anything I'd say that the finish is too balanced and could use a touch more hop bite.

Is this another tropical IPA? I'm getting the grapefruit and piney hops in the nose, it is very aromatic, similar to Flower Power. Mild bitterness starts the tasting experience, nice bready malt in the background blends with tasty hops. Considering all of the strong flavors, this is light on the tongue and very drinkable with a quick dry finish. This is among the best IPA's that I have ever had. I'm not getting the real tropical flavor that the nose exudes, but it is damn near perfect. Maine Beer Company is 4:4 with me! Fantastic","jstilwell","May 24, 2011"
4.1,-6.8,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O: This has been getting a lot of hype lately and while I did enjoy this, it's didn't really impress me all that much.

Extremely fresh hop taste here - again mostly citrus with a strong orange oil presence. Nice bitterness up front, but as hoppy as this is, it's actually quite balanced too. Nice deep malt here, a touch of caramel, smooth and sweet. Excellent body, slightly chewy and full.
