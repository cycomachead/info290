It has great lacing, a good head on the pour, smell is solid and the taste is full and is not just a hop bomb. Great one if you can find it. They are expanding to Chicago and building a bigger brewery. Lets hope they get outside of MN.","Flatlands","Jun 20, 2014"

Notes of pine needles, orange and other citrus. Nicely balanced. Not much else to say - just a fantastic, straight-up IPA.","ljthiesse","Apr 28, 2014"

The malt character comes out a bit more as the beer warms up, but nothing ever dominates. A very well-balanced brew with a lot to offer. Hopheads and malt lovers alike could both enjoy this. Great brew.","SaisonRichBiere","Apr 28, 2014"

4.66,8.1,4.5,4.75,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Pours a dark orange with a huge foamy head. Malt forward on the nose with caramel and toffee notes. Lots of pine and citrus hop aromas. Pine and grapefruit pith bitterness on the front of the palate balanced by the strong malt backbone. Full bodied with light carbonation. Finishes bitter and a bit dry. Overall, even though it's a bit maltier than most IPAs, the hop profile will satisfy the heartiest hop head out there! Well crafted and quite tasty. Great job, Surly.","JohnG190","Feb 16, 2014"

Taste was quite nice with a balance of crystal sweetness to stand up to assertive bitterness and complement fruity hop character. The body of the beer is a little heavy and the abc is higher than my sweet spot. Still, this seemed like a great pairing with what would otherwise have been an over spiced peppery jambalaya.","pweis909","Jan 05, 2014"

For a beer with only 6.2% ABV, this thing drinks like a IIPA with 1.5 times the alcohol. Unlike other hugely hopped beers in the lower ABV strata, this one doesn't get harsh or vegetal.

Taste is grapefruit, lemon, pine and sweetness. Feel is great, carbed well and leaves a slight dry aftertaste leaving me craving more.

There's no doubt the nose is piny with some fruity grapefruit/tiny bit or orange with no resin or anything like that. Taste is slightly malty with a little bit of the piny hop flavor to balance things out. Really well balanced. Mouthfeel is fairly thick for the style which is a nice surprise as I haven't really thought critically about this beet for some time. Overall I really understand why this beer is so well respected.

Caramel, pineapple, and other mixed citrus notes on the nose. Mango, pineapple, citrus, joined by light caramel and toffee notes midpalate. Finishes with continued light caramel notes and bold citrus rind bitterness. Lighter side of medium bodied, slick mouthfeel. As more of a hoppy amber rather than an IPA, it tends not to be one of my favored styles. However, it certainly is a solid brew regardless.","chanokokoro","Dec 01, 2013"

On the thinner side of medium bodied with a slick oily feel up front until tangy carbonation rolls through the middle.

It doesn’t overwhelm you, but rather gives you the exact amount of nose and mouth that you want simultaneously, producing the ultimate satisfaction with each sip. Additionally, there are a few things that make beer so unique for a “single” American IPA. For one, the grain bill is dark, and they don’t attempt to hide it. While it is so rich, they balance it wonderfully with the heavy, dripping wet hops throughout. Secondly, and more basically, it is robust as hell and intensely concise. Furious marks our introduction to Surly, and makes us that much more eager to hunt down each and every other beer they make.","TheBrewo","Sep 28, 2013"

Flavor is initially bitter, but quickly turns sweet and caramel. finish stays a little sweet, but with some hop astringency - not offensive, drying in a way.

There is an initial aggressive and harsh bitterness, but the bitterness in the finish is much smoother and soft. The hop flavors come across as quite citrusy, lots of orange juice and tangerine lending a very bright taste. There is a subtle sweet caramel backbone that complements the intensity of the hops, but doesn't temper or balance them much. Not nearly as overly aggressive and in-your-face bitter as I remember it being but sill an extremely great example of its style.","MetricOcean","Aug 08, 2013"

A deep, amber/red color, nice off-white head and moderate carbonation all hold up a fresh, fruity scent. The malt back-bone elevates the hops creating a truly satisfying IPA. I'm sold, I just wish I could track it down at my corner store.","crowsoup","Jul 08, 2013"

A citrus aroma, with some hints of pine and oak. 99 IBUs I believe, but Surly knows how to balance the hops with other flavors. It's an IPA that goes down very smooth.","XavierK31","Jul 08, 2013"

Still, while it is a nice IPA, i'm a little surprised at how highly this is evidently thought of (given its current ranking on this website). Ranking aside, if you have the opportunity, give this one a try. Just don't go into it expecting a hop bomb or some type of life-altering beer experience.","mechamifune","Apr 09, 2013"

The aroma was surprisingly mild, composed mostly of hops with a measure of citrus. At the forefront of the taste were onion and citrus like hops. There were bitter acidic and citric notes present, crisp to the point of being an attention getter. The highlight for me were the dark sweet malts that lay the backbone. The bitterness continued into the aftertaste, lingering slightly with certain orange notes. The carbonation hovered in the moderate range, allowing the taste to linger just long enough to be noticed without overstaying its welcome. This is not my favorite effort by Surly, but it is solid and quite drinkable.","JohnnyHopps","Beers"

Classic IPA bold flavors, with a crisp, bitter aftertaste. Some months later, beer buddy suggested it was one to try, when I realized I had indeed tried Furious.

4.31,0,4,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.5,"a fantastic ipa, which totally took me by surprise. the pour is pretty standard, pale orangey straw color with a finger or two of white foam. the nose is piney hops, sure to be a high alpha bomb, some lightly toasted american barley malt happening as well, but the big oily hops are stealing the show. the flavor confirms a nice hoppy brew, but fairly balanced despite how intense the hops are here. what surprised me more than anything is how soft the mouthfeel is. its really really gentle on the tongue, which is absolutely not what we have come to expect in ipas. the carbonation is relaxed but suitable, and the body is near medium, but somehow there is the feather soft character to it that is a total shocker. really wonderful way to experience hops. in the end i loved my first surly beer, not one of their highest acclaimed brews, but a very impressive introduction. the feel makes it.","StonedTrippin","Jan 13, 2013"

While it is the typical orange of other IPA's, it is murky and has particulate matter floating about. It is surly, surely. The smell, to quote a good pal of mine, is GLORIOUS! Citrus-pine-grapefruit will overtake your nostrils and initiate a hop coma that may be summed up in just one word; mmm. Or "mmm, beer" if you want to quote a famous father we all know. Oh, the taste... Perfection. I wonder if they just put hops in a blender and then canned it. If you are a floral hopoholic, this is the beer you have been looking for. Imbibe, my brothers and sisters.","edb7","Dec 08, 2012"

There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is good, the brew smells like pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, along with some bready and caramel malt. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some floral hops and a bit of tropical fruit. There's also a nice lingering hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and smooth with moderate carbonation. I have to say this is a pretty good brew, it's rated high for a reason.

The flavor is nice, but isn't quite as impressive as the nose. The malt comes through more in the flavor and it's not quite as citrusy as the nose would indicate. Nicely balanced with a slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation.

It may not be the best IPA on the planet but it'll give any American IPA a run for its money. Is it possible we've also found a new style: Midwest IPA? I think so. Would I drink it again? Again and again, perfect warmer for the long Minnesota winter.","JamesMN","Oct 06, 2012"
3.31,-23.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"O - Was expecting something else. Definitely not expecting what I found to be a knockoff of Troegs Nugget Nectar (which I don't love all that much either). The malt they used really wastes all those hops imo. This isn't bad if you're into English style IPAs or hoppy ambers, but that's not what I was anticipating or desired. Wouldn't buy if the opportunity presented itself.","nrs207","Oct 06, 2012"

It pours with a deep reddish-amber color and is topped by a big, rocky, sticky head. The beer is very fragrant, with a big contribution from citrusy hops on top of a light, bready malt base. The flavor is big and bold, with juicy, resinous citrus and spicy pine over some noticeable but nondescript malty sweetness. The texture is mouth-filling without being heavy. Overall, this is just an all-around very good IPA.","devilben02","Sep 17, 2012"

The first time I tried this, the extreme bitterness made me gag and trade it off to my friend for his Summit Pale Ale (a beer I still find preferable to Furious, by the way). But after a few more tries, I "get" it, I guess. The hoppiness is harsh, and it isn't balanced with any malt or softer fruits, but that's the point. It will never be my first choice, and I much prefer Bender or Abrasive, but this isn't as "meh" as I used to think it to be.","Ilafan","Aug 17, 2012"

I get some metalicy flavors and i think that the carbonation is a bit high. Its remarkably hoppy and the head retention and lacing are great.

The aroma is a nice blend of citrus/tropical fruit with the hops, though the earthy pine is strong, too. A hint of crystal malt. The flavor is a rush of fruit: mango, lemons, grapefruit together with the earthy pine hop character found in the nose. Medium bitter. Light caramel malt base provides a nice sweetness. Tastes great. Finishes with a lingering hop bitterness and residual sweetness together with the pine hop. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a good brew!","hopfacebrew","Apr 20, 2012"

The smell is strong and very much in agreement with expectations, while the texture is inspired--nearly sublime. The flavor profile could use more continuity; the dark crystal malt seen in the too-amber color weighs heavily upon the palate. Hop qualities are represented well in terms of flavor intensity, but come across as simplistic enough to keep it from the top tier.","beagle75","Apr 18, 2012"

I had a building score list of IPA's and each time I had another opportunity to tip back a Furious - I had to shake my head and exclaim, "DAM!". There are some really great IPA's out there but I've found no one who can balance it like Surly in their Furious offering. A gorgeous dark swatch down from amber and a sharp scent of heavenly evergreen that belies the balance you about to taste. This beer surprises you everytime by returning you HOME - it is as like the TARE on a beer scale. Some beers can take you high on various notes but Surly Furious is the new standard by which all other beers must measure themselves. I dropped the score on 'mouthfeel' to 4.5 only because I feel the need to leave room for another beer to challenge the perfection of Surly's Furious. Of possible, only a creamy mouthfeel could perfect Furious.","GoldHorde","Mar 02, 2012"

This is about what I expected, as this can was less than three weeks old. The look is darker than most IPAs; a ruby red hue. The taste followed the aroma here: very hop forward, with a nice bitter finish. The hops are a blend of piney/citrusy flavors. The hops are balanced with a malt backbone that almost tastes a bit like rye. Because of this, I might compare this beer to Founders Red's Rye or Two Brothers Cane & Ebel, but a bit more hop forward.

Yet, I've never even attempted to trade for it until recently. I love to see an IPA in can form, there's just not enough of them out there. I heard Two Hearted and Torpedo are coming soon, but I've yet to see them in my beer stores. The simple description on the can really gives you what your in for. Definitely a crimson colored IPA with a light khaki beige head forming even thin lacing between sips. Aroma has some citrus and pine hops but there's a nice caramel malt base with Scottish malt adding just an air of rustic smokiness to the mix. Flavor has a beautiful blend of caramel with pine spiced hops and hints of citrus peel. A really mellow IPA even though it's called Furious, it should just be called Delicious. Definitely hop bitterness coming through but throw me a West Coast style or a midwest style West Coast IPA anyday. For example I've been drinking more White Rajah than I care to admit. I fantastic example of the midwest West Coast IPA, or Fathead's Headhunter IPA both beers I would love to have regularly. Masala Mama from Town Hall is actually the most amazing Minnesota beer I've ever had. Mouthfeel was resinous with a strong lasting hop bitterness, balanced on the palate I didn't feel overwhelmed by the big dose of hops. Overall I would be super proud of this beer if I were from Minnesota but compared to the rest of the country it's on par and defintely ot superior with a West Coast IPA. But I want more at the same time, that's the catch with this beer it makes you want to drink another one. Thanks to Ryan aka Schlais for the trade.","WVbeergeek","Dec 22, 2011"

4.42,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a pretty deep amber with 2 fingers of sticky head that recede to a clumpy layer on the top of the beer. It is a bit darker than what I am used to for an IPA but still looks good. The smell is strongly IPA, lots of pine and some grapefruit peel, definitely some malt sweetness after the initial hop rush. Taste is more of the same, tons of hops, strong clean bitterness with a good malt backbone. Mouthfeel is good. Overall, I feel like this is a slightly more malty IPA which leads to an increased drinkability. I don't feel my palate fatigued, nor my mouth dryed out as can happen with some really dry IPAs. Definitely worth seeking out.","quirkzoo","Dec 15, 2011"

Really nice nose here (4.5) T: Earthy hops up front, a hint of catty dissonance between the sweeter malts and resiny oils. Doesn’t taste as good as it smells, but it is a mighty fine beer. Getting some bubblegum later as it warms. (4) M: Prickly up front with the body to tame it. Really a great feeling beer with a good oily residue on the finish. (4.5) O: Really a great beer. It’s a month out, and some would call that "stale", but this beer is still lively and quite well constructed.

Toffee and caramel balance out all the fresh hops. Piney and herbal. Somehow it all combines very well. A little citrus and bitter grapefruit. Great hop flavor. Pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish but overall relatively low bitterness. Well carbonated, medium bodied- actually maybe a bit light bodied relative to other IPAs. Makes it a little more sessionable though. Overall- really awesome. A really unique and great IPA.

The initial smell was the familiar smell of citrus, hops and pine that I am used to with a pale ale. When I took a sip, I instantly felt a hoppy kick before I even swallowed. The reason that I can't quite put this brew at the top of my pale ale list was that when I took a drink, there was just a bit of a watery feel mixed in with the grapefruit/pine hoppiness.

Impressive variety of fruity flavors- grapefruit, tangerine, mango, green apple, white grape. 99 IBUs and only 6.2%? I dig it. The hops are truly the stars of the show here in spite of the hefty (bready, not caramel) malt profile. Earthy and dank at times. Toward the finish, things take a turn down a resiny and gritty road.

The taste is where this shines. This is soooo perfectly balanced. Awesome hop profile, with a creamy mouth feel. This is so smooth. I could session the hell out of this beer without any gripes.

4.47,3.7,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," The taste is a very full and layered blend of bitter and tropcial hop tastes, the pithy citrus rind tinges with mildly sharp grapefruit-like bitter citrus flavor and slight tangerine sweet accents with some pineapple in the mix and a mild grassy sharp element in the tail end, a real kaleidoscope of hop elements all coming together seemlessly with nice balance from the malt and it has the nice dry finish that brings you back for the next wonderful taste. I was overwhelmed since I didn't know what to expect other than a great beer -the overall result for me was part of the can was not enough. I could have drank both cans being shared, it is a fantastic IPA, a well brewed beer above the rest of the pack. One of the best I have had recently perhaps -it is certainly an outstanding IPA in the American Style no doubtaboutit.","Slatetank","Aug 03, 2011"

The balance is what really strikes me as the high point of the brew.","myspoonistoobig","Jul 11, 2011"
3.69,-14.4,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"O: This is a good beer, and potentially a very good fresh beer. The unfortunate thing for me is that this beer really looks and feels like it came out of a can. There seems to be a lot of latent flavor in here, but it's inhibited by the lack of body, which seems directly related to the potency of the hops. The hops are prevalent and maintain a monotone presence throughout the drinking experience. The hops kindly greet you with a sensation, whereas this could be helped by a punch in the face, followed by some bold salty and sweet tropical flavors/sugary marinades. This seems like a fine recipe, but perhaps the freshness is suspect. Can or no can, this thing is good enough to warrant a few visits before a conclusion.","Cavery","Jul 11, 2011"
3.87,-10.2,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O: Definitely this beer had the indications and some traits of a truly magnificent IPA, but it really let down at some critical points, primarily the taste development and mouthfeel. Surly is definitely on to something here and the initial hop attack of this beer is one of the most aggressively tasty hop hits I've experienced, but this one definitely could use another trip to the laboratory if it wants a shot at true greatness. All in all though, glad I got to try this and not sure I'd turn down the chance to have it again.","Klym","Jul 10, 2011"

Medium mouthfeel, and quite easy to drink.","Rifugium","Jun 30, 2011"

3.97,-7.9,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured this American IPA out of a can into a pint glass. This AIPA poured a amber, orange color. It produced a decent head, that was slightly tan. Head retention was excellent. Lacing was average. The aroma was nice, very hoppy, notes of citrus and pine come leaping out. The taste of this brew starts with a jolt of piney hops. There is a nice base of malt, very sweet, overall pretty well balanced. This AIPA starts with hops and has a nice dry hoppy finish. Overall , i would say this is above average for the style but I am not sure that it lives up to the hype. I was thinking it would be very close to Piney the Elder but its not even in the same class.","GossageBrewery","Beers"
4.27,-0.9,4.5,5,4,4,4,"Poured from can into DFH snifter. I immediately catch a whif of this IPA- its all about citrus and pine. Awesome aroma. Pours a cloudy dark orange color, some nice head with decent retention. Taste- there is a buttery citrus feel to this, with just a little bitterness on the end. Very smooth- from the smell, I was actually expecting a more pronounced hop flavor here, but regardless, this is an excellent IPA. Mouthfeel- appropriate carbonation, buttery, clean. Drinkability- I could drink this one all day. Definitely one of the better canned IPA's I've ever had, but don't think its the best.","lnashsig","0"

4.08,-5.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a suprisingly copper orange color, huge plume of off-white froth, good retention and lacing. The scent is hop forward, strong citrus notes with splashes of pine. First thing to strike me about the scent was the amount of carmel and nutty malts, buttery and toffee like. Taste was quite unique, big harsh and bitter notes from the hops and a big malt presence - nutty and buttery toffee. In the back, one can find notes of lighter citrus and watery fruit. Fuller side of medium bodied, smooth and creamy, lightly dry with bitter aftertaste. Quite a uniqe beer due to the malt profile.","rfgetz","Jun 25, 2011"
4.05,-6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Overall, a really nice IPA that's big and bitter. I love that this is canned and that it is in a tallboy. Really refreshing and enjoyable. I do think it falls a bit short of the hype and it's not my favorite of the Surly brews I have tasted. It definitely is near the top of the mountain for best malt forward IPA though. Certainly worth trying.","Gosox8787","Jun 24, 2011"
4.05,-6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"O: The is a very good beer, but it is not the most original or hoppy IPA. The IPA aromas and flavors are very good, but I think 8 or 10 other widely available IPAs are better including Bell's Two Hearted Ale, Victory Hop Devil, Smuttynose Finest Kind IPA, and Heavy Seas Loose Cannon. Still this is a really nice beer.","argock","Jun 24, 2011"
4.42,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Canned 060911. Pours a clearish, dark red with a nice tan head. Smell is really fantastic. Orange, spicy pine and caramel malt, balanced together. The taste is spicy pine and a touch of orange hops, slightly biscuit, bigger caramel malts. I think it's really good, but I could see how it seems a bit rough around the edges - this is certainly different that a lot of the other really good IPAs. The mouth is aggressively carbonated with a medium body and a touch of malt sweetness hanging on the tongue. Overall, this is a really, really awesome IPA. Much better than masala mama in my opinion in the battle for MN, and the best IPA I've had that doesnt fear big malt flavor.","seeswo","Jun 22, 2011"

I'd certainly have a bunch of this in my fridge nearly always if I lived in Minnesota. Initially thought this was closer to a 3.5. Sipping on it and contemplating leads me to change my mind. It's a 4.0 overall. Granted I feel some IPAs are better, but those that I think are better than this would get a 4.5 overall from me.","matttttYCE","May 31, 2011"
4.46,3.5,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"O- The hops and malts are balanced perfectly, just enough malts so that you can taste it but not enough where it overpowers the hop bitternes at all. The piney after taste leaves you with a bitter, crisp finish that doesnt linger for too long and before you know it you have finished an entire 16 oz. can and your goin back for more. Really great beer and I wish I had easier access to it.","MikeyMikee","May 29, 2011"
4.42,2.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy dark amber color with a 1 inch off-white head that fades to a small cap. Nice distinct rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of citrus zests and pine trees. A very fresh and delicious smell. Taste is very hop forward with citrus zest and pine needles that fades into a semi-sweet caramel/malt flavor. Medium hop bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. The beer has a mild carbonation level which makes it very smooth and a bit thick. Overall, this is a great IPA and my first from Surly.

4.37,1.4,4.5,5,4,4,4.5,"O- Very good IPA. The only thing I would change would be to balance the bitterness and the hop flavor just a bit more.

Very happy with my first Surly and would like more coming!","TheGordianKnot","May 06, 2011"

Some caramel malt sweetness in the nose as well. Flavor has a strong sweet toffee/caramel malt backbone with a big citrusy hop bitterness. Goes down easy and leaves a dry, piney/citrusy hop finish. Alcohol extremely well hidden, and very drinkable at "only" 6.2%. I have yet to try a beer from Surly that I didn't like. Truly a world class IPA.","muttyd","Apr 14, 2011"

About a finger of off white foamy head and a light brownish amber body. Head dies fairly quickly leaving a good looking scuzz on the top with pretty nice lacing. Lots of pine and spicy floral hop scents on the nose. Mellow floral flavors lead into a pine and woodsy flavors. Finishes very dry. Good creamy, little bubbles on the mouth. A Great IPA.

4.55,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Mouthfeel is crisp, clean and relatively light for all the big flavors. Slight chalky character in the middle is pleasant and comes from the under-the-radar bitterness. It's crazy strong but you don't really even feel it other than in the mouthfeel. Drinkability is the top of the heap because of the balance and dry finish. Can't top this beer in this category.

That's almost nitpicking though, this is basically the perfect IPA. Superbly drinkable. The only real flaw here is that I only have one! Send me more. Please. Somebody. I'm begging you.

The flavors consist of pine, citrus, honey, light malt, and light alcohol. It has excellent balance for an IPA. It has an almost perfect mouthfeel. It drinks so smoothly from the can it's nuts.

Nose is big pine resin, some citrus, sweeter tropical fruits. Hops are fresh and incorporated well. A fair bit of caramel melt in the mouth, and a full, bitter hop bite that carries through deep into the finish. Sweeter in the nose than in the mouth, if that makes sense.

Clear flat looking body with an amber color. Aroma was very floral with notes of amongst other things pine, citrus, grapefruit, flowery. Also light notes of toasted malt, caramel, orange peel. Medium bodied with an extremely dry texture and a soft carbonation. Heavy bitter hoppy notes with only light sweet malty notes. Heavy dry, bitter and long lasting finish.

4.29,-0.5,4,5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a brilliant amber orange color with a nice, full tand head that looks creamy and foamy at the same time. The smell on this beer is amazing. This is the most citrus hop I have ever smelled on one beer, and I can't stop going back for more whiffs. I smell citrus here that I haven't smelled in beer before. I get fresh grapefruit, orange, lime, pineapple, and peach. On smell alone, this is like a tropical fruit salad in beer form. However, after the smell, the taste is a letdown. I get a strong tea-like note on the first swallow followed by hints of grapefruit hop and a little bitter pine resin. There is a slight balance from a biscuity malt, but not really great. It's not malty, but not over the top hoppy. It's a unique flavor for an IPA, but not the most delicious I've had. Other than that, the mouth is nice and the drinkability is good. Overall, an average-flavored, unbalanced IPA with one of the most fantastic noses I've had the pleasure of inhaling.","dgfair","Jan 12, 2011"

The presence of warrior hops is clear. The taste is again zesty up front with citrus flavors, crisp bitterness follows with a base of great malts up holding the hops. This beer finishes with more hops, but this time piney resinous ones and a round malt flavor. Good mouthfeel for an ipa, a little prickly and well carbed.

The can must really hold the hoppy goodness better than a bottle, because I can't remember having many better bottle commercial IPA. The beer is a dark crimson highlighted amber that is deceivingly dark. The smell is of herbaceous hops with fresh cut pine boughs, orange peel, and baking bread. I just can't overemphasize how fresh and vibrant the aroma is. The beer is appropriately dry with very firm bitterness and a nice little bit of caramel (but not sweet) maltiness. The carbonation was perfect and the hop tannins added a good bit of body. Beautiful beer to have a whole pint of.","Soonami","Dec 19, 2010"

That having been said I approached this in the conventional manner. This beer is a nice darker orange color with a nice ecru finger of foam on the surface. The smell is out of this world. It smells like when I picked hops and stuck my head into a box of them. It smells so fresh it's wonderful. The taste was rather assertive in hoppiness. I believe that there was a rather gritty dirt flavor up front, but it was taken over quickly by the bitterness of the hops and the caramel malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel was the downside of this beer, I really had to trudge through the feeling that there was literally soil in the beer (though I know there wasn't). This when let warm became even more notable in the caramel flavor, and progressively became more and more drinkable as it went along due to the fact of my tongue becoming used to the hoppy bitterness. This is a fine supery hoppy IPA, and just one more reason I wish that I had Surly around these parts.","Vdubb86","Dec 13, 2010"

The nose is one of those that you can get about a foot away from the glass, exactly how I like it. Loaded with c-hops. Taste exceeds expectations. Giant pine and white grapefruit first, followed by a movement of pineapple and caramel notes, and finishing pretty dry with some bitterness on the sides of the mouth. Wow!

Smells of grapefruit and pine mostly but with a good floral hop background, too. Nice and fruity but balanced with a hint of sweet buttery malts. Taste is just like I bit into a grapefruit covered in pine needles, I love it. Bitter, resiny and juicy hops give way to a biscuity malt bill that is sweet enough to take the edge off but doesn't interfere enough to make the hops completely fade away. High carbonation and an oily slick body that is medium to thin but still coats pretty well. Drinks wonderfully, I would love to have this one on the shelves in Boston.

Color is a slightly cloudy red-stricken orange, with that familiar Surly lacing: very small bubbles, yet this lacing was not as impressive....it was a little runny. The aroma hops are so very similar to Ithaca's Cascazilla, which I believe is a barrage of cascade hops. Nonetheless, the hops are wonderful and fresh. Other aromas include fresh pine needles, citrus (more toward orange than lemon), and malts of an English nature. Something is a little spicy on the nose. The taste is quite malty-sweet with fresh bittering hops, and a deep toffee flavor (and no caramel as specified on the can). A deep, delightful bitterness sticks around the roof of the mouth.

Oh, this is nice and bitter and hoppy. There's a nice full hop flavor here. It's along the lines of Nugget Nectar or Hop Stoopid, but less sweet and more piney. It's perfectly balanced. After almost 800 beer ratings, this is the best rating yet. This IPA is perfect in almost every way. The can keeps it fresh. I wish I could buy this in Upstate New York!","yesyouam","Sep 22, 2010"

It's got the great west-coast hop profile, with a solid and tasty malt backbone of an east coast IPA without somehow succumbing to the usual drawbacks that negatively impact mouthfeel or drinkability. One of the best IPAs on the planet.","Bubba83","Sep 21, 2010"

This is very crisp and dominated by hops with a subtle malt profile. Very well balanced. The mouthfeel is light and easy to drink.

I was surprised by the dark color of this beer, it is reddish brown that kinda scared me away at first(I am not a fan of overly malty IPA's of DIPAS.) The nose is filled with citrus fruit, pineapples and tropical fruits. The taste is phenomenal, pineapples and citrus fruits lead the way as the bitterness blends exceptionally well with the malts. The bitterness is again more west coast style, therefore more delicate, but make no mistake there is a lot of pine blasting the palate. An absolute fantastic IPA that I would love to drink all the time.","nas5755","Sep 12, 2010"

Smells great, lots of flowery notes that dominate. The taste is outstanding, I'm not a huge hophead and I love this beer. The bitterness is in here but they have done a wonderful job ballancing it out. Some beers overwhelm you with the hops leaving you with that dry bitterness on the back of your tongue. The beer seemed more tea-like in the hop flavor that was more round in flavor. I'm no expert on how they did it but there is enough other stuff going on that it's bitter but not offputting for someone like me who's not looking to be blown away by bitterness. Feels very slick in the mouth, a bit of an oily edge that goes down smooth. Overall, this is my favorite IPA - this is what I plan on drinking whenever I need a break from my normal Belgian Darks and Stouts. Just a great beer overall and I'm lucky that I can find it everywhere around town. I get to see how they brew this on Sept 24th. Woot!","plumcrazyfx","Beers"

Carbonation rushes from the base of the glass as the head dwindles leaving silk screened lacing. The aroma is big time citrusy hops. Caramel malts with a whole wheat breadiness on the nose. Really big dose of pure grapefruit and orange peel. The flavor is just as intense as the aroma. Has a huge citrus bite up front then the malts peek through to balance it somewhat. Still a very hopped ipa with structure. The carbonation level lacks a bit for me as it's not flat, just softly carbonated which I would prefer in a dipa. This makes it a bit dull and doesn't give a fresh feeling on the palate. The mouthfeel is silky smooth though. Drinkability for me on this is high. It's a great go to ipa, though I can't get it here.

I was a bit tipsy the other two times I enjoyed this beer which is why I never bothered to review it. Being able to have this now and take the time to review it makes me realize this is indeed a good beer. I always compare other IPA's to RR Blind Pig, and other DIPA's to RR PtE. Hence, seeing as this is a 6.2% IPA I went into drinking this beer to see how it stacks up to my favorite IPA. I am not biased by any means, and know there are different "styles" of IPA's...and this is one of them. A good IPA for sure, though it is a bit bitter and at the same time too malty. However, the more I let this warm up and enjoy it, the more this grows on me. Be sure not to drink the beer too cold - it becomes another and more enjoyable beer once it gets a bit warmer.

Taste starts off with some nice mango, tropical fruit, and pine hop flavors then finishes with a nice strong but not overpowering caramel/toffee backbone. This is a meduim bodied IPA that is very well balanced and feels really nice on the palate, the hops let you know they're there but doesn't overpower it. This has been my favorite all around brew since I first tried it after a Vikings game last year.

Nice lacing, and a thin ring around the outside of the glass remain. This is a very good looking beer. Aroma of hops is evident from the git-go, big, piney, and citrusy. Very nice. Taste starts out with citrus, moves quickly to pine, and then plunges into hoppy bitterness. Tastes great! Finish is dry and big time bitter. Bitterness hangs around after I drink. This is a very good IPA. Mouthfeel is right with good carbonation, oily pine, and plenty of bittering hops. Drinkability is great.

4.33,0.5,4.5,4,4,5,5,"Pours a relatively clear copper with a little sediment. Frothy, thick off white head that has excellent retention and leaves copious amounts of foamy, sticky lacing. Aroma is balance of smooth pine and resiny hops with sweet malt and mild toasted notes. Mouthfeel is medium thick with mild carbonation and a mild hop, resiny finish. Citrus and pine hop flavors in body are balanced by a strong bready and caramel malt body. The mouthfeel and drinkability of this IPA are exceptional for the style, however after having had a Sculpin earlier in the night it's hard to rate the taste and nose much higher than I have (not that I'm trying to directly compare them). The balance and smoothness are incredible for this beer, easily my favorite Surly beer I've tried yet.","yourefragile","Jan 01, 2010"

The smell is a big hit of pine, citrus peel, raw minerals, a little savory note at the end. The taste is brutal on the hops: pine, mostly, with some grapefruit peel, some faint sweet malts down in there. Not in the least bit balanced, but enjoyable anyway. It's moderately carbonated, thick and sticky. Too much of a hop bomb to drink much of -- last night I split a can with two friends, and I think that little bit was the perfect amount.","gory4d","Beers"

Aroma features extremely strong pine and citrus (grapefruit) notes with earthy and caramel notes beneath it. Taste is almost a disappointment after the power that the aroma suggests. Not that its bad, just the aroma is so appealing. Taste begins with hop bitterness and finishes with a smooth caramel maltiness that balances it without taking away from the hops.

I was looking at a thick finger of light-tan head that was exploding with bubbles, giving off a scent of caramel-toffee that was richer than I had imagined. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber, so I disagreed with the color. The CAN was stamped on the bottom "CANned on 9/27/10 so freshness was not an issue. In the meantime, the head fell, creating a lot of sticky lacing. Leaning in for a whiff, I got a blast of pine, like undiluted pine cleaner. Wow! The first sip was medium in terms of mouthfeel but heavy on flavor as the pine and the grapefruit-hops strove for dominance. The finish was initially of ruby-red grapefruit, but the extreme finish allowed the caramel-toffee to make an appearance. Goddang, but this was the kind of thing that got me hooked as a hophead in the first place!

Really a nice looking IPA. The smell is amazing, orange, grapefruit, lemon-lime all together upfront. Then it gets really floral, slightly herbal and leafy. The malt body comes on bready, but slightly dry. Toasty, crackery, and a hint of pinapple cake with caramellized malt sugar. The beer comes on nice and cakey, like a dry citrus cake, lemony, bready, toasty. There's a nice caramelly glaze. There are resins, floral notes, powdery pollen, The alcohol isn't noticable, but this one warms you up a little. This has ther kind of flavor I love in an IPA. The mouthfeel is a liittle around medium, maybe lighter, with a nice tickle of carbonation. The resinous feel was good, the dryness was very good, but there was just enough malty sweetness.

4.65,7.9,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is the one thing in this beer that is standard for style: on the light side of medium-bodied with more carbonation than is foreshadowed by the appearance. The taste uses the full pallet of hop flavors: grapefruit, pine, lemongrass and lavender all weave their way through your tastebuds. A welcome caramel flavor makes a brief balancing appearance about midway though and then the long, bitter finish comes through, lingering pleasantly at the back of your throat. Although the beer is not "balanced," in the true sense of the word, it provides enough complexity to prevent any one flavor from taking on undue prominence. Without a single harsh note, Furious is one of the rare breeds that provides complexity and yet remains quite drinkable. Truly one of the best IPAs I have tasted.","chicagobeerriot","Jul 24, 2009"

Tastes are bold, pungent grapefruit with an enormous bitter finish with some piny notes (I've gotten used to the 99 ibu's this packs, so it seems to taste better each time I have it, because I know what's expected). The malts are present (mainly caramel and some sugary notes), but again are in the background. They do hold up fairly well to the hops.

The mouthfeel is the first thing that jumps out though. This is one creamy brew! I usually use creamy to describe a beer but none have ever been like this.

Very complex and very nice. Taste mirrors the smell but hops get a bit more balanced by the tea and I like mine very one dimensional. Still fantastic however.

Perhaps a bit out of balance here, but they do make bitterness into an art form. This beer's bitterness deserves its own zip code. It's a statement. Carbonation is perfect.

It pours into the glass a dark amber to copper color with a nice creamy head that appears to lose nothing from the brewers' beloved canning method. The taste, oh the taste! This packs as much flavor as many of the DIPAs that I have tried. It is so citrusy, piney, and bitter. It doesn't forget about the malts either. The one knock that I have is that the mouthfeel is not 100% where I think it should be. I think it could be a little more full bodied, not to say that it is bad by any means. Man is this beer drinkable though. If you are ever in St. Paul or your beer store gets a case of this beer you should have no qualms about buying a full case or too.

Since the beer is canned, one would expect the beer to have a slight tin nose or taste, but the beer definitely does not. The nose comes accross of a deep citrus flavour with a slight grapefruit and peach hint. The fruitiness comes entirely from the hops, but smells wonderful. When drinking the beer the huge bitterness of 100 IBUs hit you intially, but the Amarillo and Simcoe hops jump out at your tastebuds, making you want to have another drink. The beer is so incredibly hoppy, but at the same time, it's balanced! The flavours and aroma while drinking this beer, just blow me away.

Furious pours a reddish copper color, relatively cloudy with a billowy head that was pretty active as I poured into the glass. The lacing is clinging to the sides of the glass in rows as I drink it down. The dominant hop aroma jumps out of the glass as if you are sniffing fresh hops off the vine. It is almost breathtaking to get a whiff! The hop profile is more piney than citrusy. There is a slight aroma of malt but the hops are the big thing here. The flavor does not disappoint for hop heads. There is a well balanced sting of hops coupled with a medium carmelly body. Flavors like white pepper, pine needles, and very sour orange juice loom in the background.

Pretty good effort though, for only 6.2% ABV. Drinks a little heavy for a 6.2%, seems to have a lot of unfermentables for that potency.

The aroma is over the top piney hops with just a subtle hint of grapefruit and malt. The taste is west coast hoppy. Orange peel and what reminds me of the bitterness from fresh squeezed grapefruits. What's odd is the beer really doesn't have a middle. It's orangey up front and finishes with the grapefruit bitterness but leaves the body open. Odd. The mouthfeel is a bit thin. I wish that it had a little more weight to it. While it does, in my mind, have some flaws it still is a remarkably drinkable beer. At about 6% this is definitely something I could see drinking a 4 pack of in a night.","hwwty4","Oct 05, 2008"

Aroma is a ridiculous level of orange, lemon rind, and caramel; it's floral, almost perfume-like. The taste is full of prickly pine, earth, and some malt that manages to remain very robust without upstaging the hop flavors.

Flavor is bursting with, again, massive hops like grapefruit, pine, and orange. A touch of a lemony sourness from the moderate hop bitternes but this brew is surprisingly smooth due to a decent malt bill and it's not at all harsh in the aftertaste as you will find in many mega-hopped IPA's.","beerkittycat","Aug 19, 2008"

Not a big smell. Big bitter start with a dry hop finish. The bitter taste stays long in the mouth. This begs to be drunk. I'm getting a slight sweetness around the tongue with a dry bitter taste on the tongue. Great sipper because it tastes so good you don't want it to end.

You get a huge whiff of flowery, citrusy, and piney hops that I don't think I've ever gotten on another IPA. The nose is really really strong on this and it translates to the taste as well.

Pours a very pretty red with hints of terracotta, creamy yellow white head. Beautiful. Smells fresh, of grasses, citrus fruits and pine sap. Taste is a hop-forward blast of changing flavors, pert bitter citrus, nice caramel malt backbone, lingering bitterness.

Nice retention throughout leaves lots of sticky lacing behind. Smells even better than on tap, lots of pine, citrus oils, earthy hops, and toasted caramel malt. Tastes of toffee, sweet caramel, and lightly toasted malt are followed by flavors of orange peel, pineapple, tangerine, grass, pine, and earthy hops with a little bit of spicy hops mixed with grapefruit in the back end.

4.55,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Wow. What a great IPA! Normally I'm not the biggest fan of beers with lots of hops, but this one hits the nail on the head. Served on-tap in a pint glass. It has some nice brownish-ruby coloration, topped with a thick white head which left copious lacing down the length of the glass. Lots of hops in the nose. Taste is what floored me about this beer, though. The hops seem to hit with a one-two punch; a nice flourish at first, which subsides and is then replaced by a second wave of hoppiness in the aftertaste. All of this is balanced brilliantly by the malt character which puts this stuff ahead of any IPA I've tried thus far. Mouthfeel is probably best described as somewhat viscous, with a satisfying rich character.

4.88,13.2,5,4.5,5,5,5,"This is an amazing beer - I've had it on draft and in a growler, but am reviewing a canned one. The appearance is just amazing, especially when poured into a glass that can hold all 16 ounces and a head. The head is dense, and it subsides slowly, leaving plenty of lace down the sides. I get a good whiff of hoppiness here, which considering I rarely smell anything is a plus. The taste is explosive, with an initial assualt of citrussy hops, followed by a solid base of malts to balance it out, with a strong hoppy after taste that lingers for quite some time. The beer has a great, rich mouthfeel, as if it were almost too big for itself. There is nothing watery here, yet it remains sprightly and non syrup-like. Again, this beer's nearly perfect balance shines through. It is quite drinkable, but going beyond a couple cans can be a lot of alcohol. If I could sip, it would be a great session brew, but as I guzzle, I need to limit myself. This is an outstanding IPA.","Monkeypaws","Apr 17, 2008"

The nose shows lots of citric (especially grapefruit) hops with just a touch of balancing sweet toffee/caramel toward the back. In the mouth it is well-balanced and shows tons of dry and bitter piney/herbal hops vs. the mainly citric hops the nose showed. This one gets bonus points for packing in so many hops at a "lower" alcohol.","SQNfan","Apr 13, 2008"

Nose is delicious, fairly drying hops but then hits of fruit in there as well. I've heard they throw a ton of varieties in here, and the aromas follow through with that. A good bit of caramel hops too. Flavor is fairly drying, piney hops up front. Some darker toffeeish malt, and then some weird fruitiness, maybe dried fruit, pomegranate. Interesting as hell. Certainly dominated by those hops, but incredibly complex. Feel is nice and full, with perfect carbonation. Had this one along with the Masala Mama this week, and they were both absolutely excellent.

Wonderful sweet citrus aromas with a hint of spruce needles. High alpha hops, I am thinking Centennial, control the palate with bitter citrus flavors with some evergreen tones.

I was expecting a hop infusion, but it was a bit mellower, with a wonderful malt balance finish. this one did not burn my taste buds (which i definitely do not mind, being a hop head) Nice consistent medium bodied mouthfeel.

I really want a touch more malt in this one, and the body is a touch thin.

A piney resin remains on the tongue with a teensy bit of toasted oat. Fairly well balanced, even considering the initial onslaught. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full bodied, though perhaps not so shocking when taking into account the thickness of the Bender I had the prior eve. Very rich, wouldn't pick this as a warm weather quencher, but its lovely for a cold day watching hockey. I enjoy it, but the Furious assault of hops is wearing out my tongue, a little heavy for not being a dipa. Still nice and warming, and again, well balanced. Big thanks to mully for the can.

Like a handfull of Warrior pellet hops. Big and acidic and maybe some amonia too. The taste is way off balanced and I'm not complaining at all. I think there might be a touch of carmel malts, maybe. Who cares let me enjoy my hops. As the beer warms the nose matures more refined spicy piney hops.

Pours a slightly hazy amber with a head that fades to a cap that sticks around and generates some good lacing. Fruity aromas with lots of citrusy hops, including a good dose of pith-like smells. Tastes similar- big and bold with lots of citrusy hops, a lingering bitterness, and a brighter fruit finish with sweet citrus and cherry, and a slight hit of metal right at the end. Mouthfeel is slightly thick but not grainy or sweet. Just delicious and a pleasure to try this. I just wish the distribution were a little wider.

Furious is malty and hoppy. Unique IPA simply for the different malts that were used. The taste is hoppy and citrusy upfront. There's a nice caramel maltiness midway that gives way to a piney bitterness. Scottish malts add an great touch to it and provide a feint peatiness to the finish.","Winter","Nov 03, 2007"

4.57,6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Good to finally get my hands on this beer. has to be one of the better IPA's out there. The beer begins with a heavily froathy pour that brings on amber and orange colors with a heavy rust undertone. The nose is dominated by juicy, thirst quenching perfumes and citrus notes, all woven into a rich malt pillow --mouth watering to say the least. The flavors are highly devoted to ripe oranges and ruby-red grapefruit centered on medium malt flavors that stop shy of caramel or artificial sweetness. Back up notes of pineapples, peppery esters, and mild alcohols all complement the rich malt body, while adding a lot of complexity. Textures are Marzen-like, but with that influence of citrus hops. Finishes quite clean, juicy, and with a crisp dryness. No problem finding the bottom of this glass. Thanks Nathan15 for sharing.","BEERchitect","Sep 25, 2007"

Poured out a deep dark copper amber color that had a nice red tint to it when held up to the light. was topped off with about an inch of tannish whit head. Pretty good head retention, and tons of sticky lace left behind on the glass. Smell: Mouthwatering aromas of floral hops, sweet malts, and delicate citrus notes teamed up with a bit of pine and orange peel. Just a notch below perfect but damn close. Flavor in fact was perfect in my opinion. Nice smooth yeasty, malty, bread like flavors, and then a nice bitter hop rush that takes a bite out of the palate. Also citrus, pine, and a bit of grass. Very earthy. Just the right amount of carbonation, and very nicely balanced. Has a nice sticky, but smooth mouthfeel. I love how canned beers really showcase the hops. Awesomely drinkable. This now has to be my favorite IPA.","jaxon53","Aug 30, 2007"

The aroma has a big malt profile but the juicy hops are the main characteristic of this beer. Big grapefruit and citrus aromas make me want to dive right into this beer. The taste is similar to the aroma with a very clean mouthfeel and a pleasant bitterness. The Scottish malt, as it states on the back of the can, remind me of a hoppy Scotch Ale like Red Rocket, caramel and sticky sweet. This is truly a moment of pure hop bliss. One of the best IPAs I have been able to enjoy, and the best beer from a can I have ever had. Where are the 24 packs???

The taste is citrucy hoppy (grapefruit juicy) with sweet malty undertones. The mouthfeel was thick and filling, very coating and satisfying.

4.4,2.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Got in a trade with Faro - many thanks! Poured from a 1 pint can into my pint glass. The back of the can had a blurb about the beer - did a good job describing the fury within. It was a cloudy reddish-orange with tons of carb bubbling up. It had a good light tan head that settled into a constant film. Heavy lacing. The aroma was hop attack with citric and pine. Could smell a little of the malt in the back but not the buttery toffee that some describe. The taste was also a hop attack. Very piney with a bitter, but not too bitter, aftertaste. It's listed as an AmIPA but I could easily see this as an ADIPA. The mouthfeel was creamy with an all out assault by the hops. Overall, a great beer and glad I got to try it. Only caveat for me is that it is so strong on hops that I'd really need to be in the mood for it before trying again. This is not a beer to just wipe out unless you are prepared for a ton of hop shredding. Highly recommend. (4, RB-OAY, T, Y, MBIM)","TexIndy","0"
4.85,12.5,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep ruby orange with a good 3 fingers of ivory head that dies slower than normal and laces nicely. This already looks like a knockout. The smell blows my mind. Yes it smacks you with intense hops but the variety is wonderfully noticable along with very intense citrus. Piney, fresh grass and a hint of malt. This is not your average IPA. The taste makes my lower lip quiver and brings a tear to my eye. So many intense hops, citrus, grapefruit, some awesome malty balance with a bitter finish of perfection. Feels crisp and medium in the mouth wih perfect carbonation and has the drinkibility of an ultimate session beer. This brew smashes the IPA mold, a feat in itself, and opens my eyes to what a great beer is compared to a good beer. Minnesota BA's will be recieving a lot of mail from me in the future.

So thanks to ballplayin' Jordan and his Steelies it doesn't get a perfect score. I suppose it's a little harsh if you're not used to it. True, it's really harsh and bitter for an IPA.

Head lasts and lasts, with heavy lacing. Aroma is dominated by piney hops. Taste is more of the same resiny hops, but with enough malt underneath to keep it from being cloyingly bitter, if there is such a thing.

More citrus is on the tongue than had expected from the scent. Starts off with grapefruit and lemon blended with some mild toffee malt flavors that come out towards the end. Very balanced. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a good amount of carbonation, perfect mix of the two for the American IPA style. Very crisp and clean going down.

It has a nice malt scent that boasts of pale, special roast, and bisquit malts along with a hell of a hop aroma that really blends well with the malts; well rounded. The taste is great! This is one hoppy beer. It starts off bitter, but balanced with the malts provided and then just explodes with hops in the finish. It's quite intense and leaves a residual hop taste in my mouth several minutes later. This is a true hop lovers beer. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation.

The citrus fruit character is quite dominant in the mouth as well, but are balanced out nicely by a smooth, but not overly sweet or caramel-like, maltiness. Theres a bit more of a herbal/leafy touch on the back end, with some fairly assertive bitterness. All of the elements are in balance, but the intensity of all of the flavors are off the charts.

It seriously makes me glad that I don't have any cuts in my mouth, or else my whole mouth would be stinging instead of just buzzing. Malt is crucial in providing the balance, but it's not a major part of the flavour profile giving a light caramel sweetness and heathery softness. All that said, this is balls-out in presentation and flavour and it very hard not to like. It's a hop bomb that you can still enjoy for a lot of other reasons besides the bitterness. I found the carbonation a little high but that's a minor quibble. Extremely drying in all that bitterness and the hop oils coat your esophagus so you can enjoy hops all frickin' night until tomorrow morning. Drinkability is high as long as you have a glass of water between pints to whet your dried out puckered whistle. Furious might even be like IPA Crystal Meth.

A wonderful quaf of floral and citrus, with rising heat and a nip of malt caramels in the nose. Pours a crystal clear ruddy amber, with sunset fire fringe. Foamed with creamy tan sticky lacing, sheeting the glass and floating high. On the tongue a deft hand of hops, with articulate loblolly pine resins, burning red pine sap and a whole bouquet of floral orgasm. The hop flavors are right there, as if off the vine. So fresh and ripe. Scarcely does an IPA seem to hold onto the crisp resins and hop sugars as this beer does. Maintaining a biting alcohol-fueled hop frenzy in the middle, this is a bitter beer, but only in a good west coast cacophony. Luscious, wet and sappy. This is a damn fine IPA. The malt backbone kicks in with light caramels, sweet maple syrup and drying raisin bread. A top IPA for sure. I do think that the canning has helped preserve this beers better qualities and many have said that it doesnt differ from the tap version all that much.","CharlesDarwin","Feb 25, 2007"

Scorching bitterness, little balance was all I thought on my first sip and things really didn't change. The hop flavour was very resinous with some citrus character, and there was just a faint caramel sweetness that was inadequate to tame the bitterness. A bit of alcohol was present too. Medium/light bodied with average (and appropriate) carbonation and a dry hop finish. There just isn't enough of a malt backbone here to support the bittering hop charge in this beer.

Beautiful.... I am a hop head, but there is more than just hops to this beer. The scottish malt used adds a real depth to this beer and really helps countact the hop attack. I can't beleive this beer is only 6%. It could pass for a dipa, except a slight lack of sweetness. One of the best IPA's I've had and I can't wait to get back to Minneapolis to track more down.

Overpowering, flowery hop smell along with pungent, fruity cirtrus accompaniment. It appears the solid, ruddy yellow tan of a nice IPA, with a pillowy, inviting yellowish head. The taste is a thirst-quenching molestation of the inside of your mouth, like somebody is throwing a bitter snuggle party - and hops & the sides of your tongue are invited. Heavily carbonated; perhaps a minor negative, as there was almost a slight champagnelike character. But the full mouthfeel and rolling bitterness leaves you little doubt as to the school of alcohol your imbibing. Clean, dry finish. It was a 16-oz can (here's to hoping they start bottling this sucker), and the alcohol content snuck up on me a bit. Maybe it was the beer talking, but I was wanting another. Well done, Surly!

Sweeter malts were present initially, quickly gave way to the intense and complex hop flavors. Mouthfeel was medium, with moderate carbonation.

This is one heck of a hop bomb for sure, with a huge blast of piney hops and more hops and more hops through to the finish. Piney, citrusy and fruity hops that come in waves and give their own kind of buzz apart from the alcohol in this beer. I believe that hops, in the right quantity, can be intoxicating. This beer is proof of that theory. The malt in this beer merely is a foundation for the hops and to keep the beer drinkable so that you can have more than just one.

Taste follows suit; big--no, huge--hop profile. Fresh, herbal, citrusy, bitter, numbing. Malt is there, playing third fiddle. The hoppiest regularly-brewed beer in the state? I think so.

3.98,-7.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"Others have noted this as a hop bomb and that seems about right. Not sure there is anything particularly special about this, except no other MN brewery (not brewpub) seems to be making something this intensely hopped and yet accessible. It's nice to have this option and it fits the bill. It might be hard to do more than two (for me) as I fear the dreaded hop hangover.","garymuchow","May 13, 2006"
3.94,-8.6,4,5,3.5,4,3.5,"Geez Louise is this beer gettin' the reviews! I was expecting a BubbleJack easy goin' grease-beater and instead I get WHOOPED on the head ugly-stick style with hops, hops, and a great big can of Pineapple (sans the syrupy gunk that fills up the can.) Big hops on the nose . . . swear I could smell this as it was being tapped, and I was outside on the patio! Cascades and Amarillo? Simcoe and Chinook? Pushpins and pineapple and Ticky-tacky? Aww banana oil, all I know is for such a hop-bomb this is surprisingly well-balanced, with just enough juicy malt to keep the juicy hops in place (I was reminded of the Avery IPA, a personal fave . . . take that as a compliment, guys!) I will say that this beer ain't for everybody but if you eat sleep and dream hops it IS for you. One last thought: Golden Promise malt seems to be buried by the hops - Give 'em an A for effort anyways. This beer almost makes me wanna buy the tee-shirt, swear ta God . . .","Chaz","Apr 21, 2006"
4.6,6.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"I've been wanting to try this beer since it was introduced, so I decided the open house was as good a time as any. I was not disappointed--this was an excellent beer that reminded me of a double IPA, but without the high alcohol kick. Highly recommended!","Mdog","Apr 16, 2006"
4.63,7.4,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Damn, this is a good beer. It has a nice amber/coppery appearance, deeper and cloudier than your typical IPA. The girl at the bar I ordered it from said, "you know this is really hoppy right?" and I said "Sweet, bring it on." She was right, and I wasn't kidding. Upon smelling this beer you can tell it's citrusy and fruity, but upon tasting it there is a flavor explosion. The grapefruit-like and strong floral aroma/taste work well with the cloudy and sweet malt. It reminds me a lot of beers that have simcoe hops in them, this might too, I havn't seen a list of the hops yet. I might be understating this but the flavor is quite pungent, which reduces the drinkability a bit, but damn, this is a good beer.","dfried","Apr 13, 2006"
4.97,15.3,4.5,5,5,5,5,"Drinkability: The new champ (in bitterness) of Minnesota hop-bombs. Not the most balance, but by design. Fantastic.","TastyTaste","Mar 18, 2006"
4.82,11.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Nice hop bite, some Malty taste to balance. Medium heavy mouth feel. I love this beer. Very nice job by our friends at Surly.","corporatejim","Mar 09, 2006"

4.8,11.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Slightly hazed copper. Thin creamy ivory white head that is quite dense. Retention is very good. Lost of nice looking lace is left behind on the glass. Really nice aroma. Fresh lemon zest, grapefruit and other bright citrusy goodness. Underneath lies a nice toasted malt quality. The mouthfeel is creamy. The beer's medium bodied. Alcohol traits are absent. The flavor is nicely balanced. Tilts toward the hoppy side though. Brightly citric with grapefruit pulp and pine sap noted. Nice little lingering bitterness. Hop qualities are quite juicy. And there's some caramel and toffee based malt characteristics giving this beer a foundation underneath. This is quite good, but in my world, it's more of an Extra Pale Ale or IPA than an amber. But hey, that's just me!! What matters is that it's a damn nice brew.","Bighuge","Mar 04, 2006"
4.05,-6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"I enjoyed this at first pint. Very nice grapefruit taste and bite. But it is a bit much after a while. It tired my palate out right quick and half way through the second pint my mouth was screaming for something else so I had a Porter instead of a third Furious. I see now why it is named as so. The hops are just that. Furious.","tavernjef","Mar 03, 2006"
4.49,4.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"On a side note, I am extremely happy to have a brewery in the Twin Cities that is willing to color outside the lines a bit. Nothing against the local juggernaught Summit, but they are not willing to do anything that is risky or exciting. Prost! Surly, keep up the good work!","hgrong","Feb 25, 2006"
3.31,-23.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Dark clear amber color, darker than I expected. Minimal head in this pour, light traces of wispy lacing. Aroma of copious hops, harsh in many aspects, with a background of malt. The aroma is as unidimensional as the taste. Mouthfeel is lighter, carbonation is well-done at medium. The flavor is quite cartoonishly bitter, I had a hard time picking up a malt profile in contrast to the bit of nuttiness and caramel to the smell. Piney and scouring and too brittle and dry, deadening and palate-fatiguing rather than complex (wonder what the hop addition bill was, lots of bittering, less aroma hops?), with a hard-charging finish that leaves plenty of hops lingering into the aftertaste. This one could be way more (or at all?) balanced to my mind, but if they were going for a highly amped-up hop bomb to impress the folks looking forward to the Surly line, they achieved it. I enjoyed it slightly, but it was a bit more harsh than I normally like. Tried back-to-back with a Two Hearted Ale, and sorry, Furious is a one-note wonder in comparison.","ADR","Beers"
4.61,7,4.5,3.5,5,5,5,"This is one of two beers brewed by a brand new brewery in the Twin Cities, and I must say, I am impressed. This pours a slightly opaque reddish amber, with a half-inch whitish head and substantial lacing on the glass. A slightly hoppy smell does not adequately prepare one for the incredible citrussy hop flavor. There is plentiful malt backing, which helps to provide this brew's fine balance, but it is the hops which take center stage. Along with the bitterness, one can taste a juicy grapefruit flavor, which dazzles the tongue. This is very easy to drink if you love hoppy brews. I can hardly wait till they bottle it. A fine effort!","edbeered","0"
4.85,12.5,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"P.S., I've had the cask dry-hopped version, now dubbed "Tea-Bagged" twice now, and never took out pen and paper to compose a full review, but, damn, it would definitely get all 5's out of me, an amazing beer! Check out if hear of a pouring, it is not to be missed!","feloniousmonk","0"
