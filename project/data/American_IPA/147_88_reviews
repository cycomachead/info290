"Honestly this is one of the worst IPA's I've ever had.  Mostly because of the quality control but also because on the West Coast this is what most people try as their 1st ipa.  This is when people decide they don't like IPA's."
""
""
""
"Definitely not my favorite IPA, but its decent.  It has a great smell, but there is a skunkyness to this beer that is pretty over-powering.  Not to much to say about this Stone Beer, yes its drinkable and readily available at a decent price, but the wow factor is just not there.  If it tasted as good as it smells then my rating would be higher."
""
""
"Dank smell to it. Definitely floral notes and citrusy. Great 1 inch head that returns when agitated. Great IPA."
"Grapefruit, pine and dank. Just a tad bitter on the aftertaste for me, but an incredible beer nonetheless."
""
""
"O - one of my favorite IPAs. Delicious and refreshing. One of the best year round IPAs out there."
""
""
"Good but ipa is not my forte"
""
""
""
""
"one of the best IPAs. but i don't need to tell YOU that..."
""
""
""
"Overall: An excellent IPA, and one that is drinkable and world-class without being gimmicky, overly boozy, or anything else. Just a straight-shooting IPA with incredible purity of flavor."
"Really solid IPA. Strong bitterness but good balance. Drinkable and rewarding."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Bravo !"

"One of the best, unique IPA's available in Pennsylvania. Keep up the good work out there in Sunny CA guys!"

"Recently enjoyed at Stone Brewery San Diego with John, mom and dad February 2015."
"Overall, an extremely smooth finish, an excellent IPA that I would definitely buy again."
"Go to West Coast Style IPA"
""
""
""
"I remember that when I first had this, probably 6 or 8 years ago, I thought it was absolutely great.  Today I had two in a row.  OK, its good, but it wasn't all that drinkable.  Nice flavors up front, but a little bitter-harsh on the finish.  Very similar to a hundred other IPAs.  I think many of those newer IPAs  probably copied this.  Maybe I'm just burned out on all the IPA nonsense."
""
""
""
""
"Strong at first, after taste wasn't bad"
""
""
"citrus big hop notes same as the taste very good"
""
""
""
"What a IPA should be. Full of flavor, crisp and strong. I really enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little over-hyped in my estimation, but still a very good IPA.  Not bold or exciting, but very nice."
"Overall: I don't like bitterness, so I won't be drinking this often. However, that doesn't mean that it is not a good one; it is up there with the top, and I am sure I will return to it."
"O - Perhaps my opinion is skewed having tried a couple other Stone IPA's prior to this one. While the Delicious and Green Tea IPAs blow this one out of the water, it's still very smooth, balanced, and the hops sit in all the right ways."
""

"Bottle of stone ipa drank."
"-one of the better ipa styles i have tried, it is what stone is best at!"
""
""
""
""
"First off one of the coolest bottles I have seen, the painted on logo is pretty cool. It pours a bright somewhat haze gold with a big frothy white head that is very enduring. The smell is intense with floral and pine aromas with vague hints of citrus. The taste reflects this, lots of hoppy goodness with a little malt to back it up. In my opinion this is definitely a hop forward beer. Definitely refreshing after a long day. Usually I like my IPAs more on the citrusy side rather than floral or piny, but for this I will make an exception. I understand why this is a world class beer."
""
"O: Was a bit worried because this bottle was pushing it's best by date, but it has held up very well. Properly hoppy, shows why it's a true standard for the style. Still not my favorite, but a solid classic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark yellow with a thick head. Smells like pine, fruit and citrus on the nose. Tastes bitter on the back but hoppy and the smell compliments the taste. A fantastic IPA"
""
"On draught.  Comes a straw color with a creamy head, good retention and lacing.  Nice spicy, pine, citrus hops in the nose and on the palate with just enough malt for balance.  A great example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle into shaker. Pours clear orange-amber with a solid two-finger white head. Lots of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a powerful hop blast: citrus, floral, and pine. A fair amount of caramel and bread malt lies below the hoppy aroma. Taste is medium-high bitterness from citrus peel, pine, and flower hoppiness supported by a nice malty sweet ribbon through each sip. Medium body, slick and creamy, average carbonation, long, bitter finish. Nice to finally drink an archetypal IPA from a bedrock craft brewer."
""
"on tap at bar hop. welcome to ontario, stone. lightly tropical aroma consisting of mango, pine, and some grapefruit. taste follows the nose with a solid bitterness on the back end. hops are the showcase.  not getting much malt flavour. medium mouthfeel, medium carbonation. a bitter and unbalanced but hoppy and delicious IPA"
"Great west coast IPA and is highly available at least in Southern California. It will put you on your ass"
""
""
"Good beer Enjoyed it a lot"
"Excellent beer.  Especially good from the tap."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a kick ass brew that I will seek out when I am specifically seeking hop bombs with little to no sweetness in the taste."
""
""
""
""
"Really good and solid IPA, will definitely buy again, can't wait to try more from stone"
""
""
""
""
""
"My first go-to choice of IPA"
""
""
""
"Few regular IPAs are as angry as this one. A Pine hop citrus monster with not alot of sweetness but usually very refreshing. Its not always consistant on tap, but its more consistant than most. If O'Dells IPA and Firestone IPA are running too sweet on tap for my mood, I'll usually end up drinking this. If it's stone, its going to be hoppy or alcoholic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Awesome ipa, smooth, delicious, tasty"
""
""
"Burst of hops to both nose and palate. One darn good IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hands down, the king of all beers. This is a wonderfully crafted beer."
""
"I drink it too fast. Tastes awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  What I consider a true representation of the style.  A solid offering and go to beer for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is everything an IPA should aspire to be.  One of my favorite.  Light yellow appearance and a crisp , ultra fresh taste.  The price and lower abv makes it a perfect ""everyday"" IPA or the go to after a stronger beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I need to grab a fresh bottle this was a little outdated. And it was still pretty good."
""
""
"Overall: excellent IPA. Lots of character in a relatively low ABV beer. I especially like its floral, spicy, and hoppy character. Often, IPAs miss out on a strong floral notes. This beer is very well done and balanced just right for hop and citrus flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite IPAs....."
""
""
"Okay could be better however.  Dry-hopped"
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice and smooth with a perfect blend of Hoppiness and taste."
""
""
""
""
"The best IPA from the ""King of IPA's""!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: taste like grapefruit I personally likr the black ipa better"
"Much better now that I've had some fresh product."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not sure why this beer is rated so high tastes like any offering from any other brewer"
"Not terrible but not great.  Middle of the pack IPA."
""
"This beer is far too bitter. I love bitter but this is bitter beyond reason. Still pretty good, however."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as balanced as I'd like. Bitter Ness heavy and some top-hop flavor but missing in the middle."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was expecting more out of this. I've had it in the past prior to my craft evolution and thought it was better then. Palate has definitely changed over the years."
""
"It was good, but very bitter. I like ruination better"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A stellar American IPA. A solid hop profile. This is my kind of IPA. All the hopheads out there will be happy this one."
""
""
""
"Super IPA.  Ultra smooth.  Personal favorite.  IMO, this is a new standard...like SA Boston Lager was in the 80s."
"Great IPA. Stone has many great offerings and this one is on the top of the list"
"very good IPA.. There are a few that I like better. Still recommended"
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice strong IPA. Reminds me of a weak Imperial IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though I complain alot about American IPAs, I sure seem to drink plenty of them.  This is a subtle and unique example and well worth a try.  This bomber was marked down from about 5 1/2 bucks down to 4 bucks."
"Very good  and balanced IPA...with above avg ABV...  I heard they are opening up a brewery in Belgium...wow... I admire the cajones, and I do think it will do well over there... maybe after some initial resistance... there is not much they can pick apart in this IPA if they actually taste it..."
""
"O:  Another gem from the Gorgoyle.  Sold, smooth and easy to swallow.  More, please."

"Love the way it's marketed. Really drawn to the smell and the bitter bite of the hops. Outstanding!"
""
"More bitter that hoppy. I am use to the beers that showcases the hops more"
"This is the beer that made me an IPA fan all those years ago"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - one of the best looking beers you will find. I'd definitely drink it again many times over but I prefer other IPA's and other Stone offerings out there. They are a fantastic brewery."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Such a solid IPA. Hoppy yet extremely well balanced."
""
""
"Enjoy IPAs, but this one has way too much bitterness."
""
""
""
"Disappointing.  I bought this based on a recommendation, but far too bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent spicy aroma with slight citrus. Spicy hop flavor, medium, body with nice dry hop spice aftertaste. Gold standard for a good ipa."
""
""
""
""
"Basic gateway IPA :(  solid and though"
"A classic in the west coast IPA style, light on the malts and a heavy dose of bitterness that lingers from the hop profile.  Glassy, green, fresh taste with a grapefruit flavor.  Great sipper but the bite of the beer can sometimes fatigue the pallet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I say this has and always will be a go to for me as an AIPA. Its hard not to find practically anywhere."
""
""
""
"Its alright. Don't understand the hype but they are a top notch brewery this just ain't enough citrus or any fruity hop presence enough for me to purchase again."
""
""
""
"Seriously, world class stuff."
""
""
"Very dissapointing considering other reviews, too bitter, and I don't mean good bitter, bad aftertaste."

"I  like other Stone products but this IPA is really nothing much. I've had much better IPAs for this price (Anderson Valley comes to mind). Definitely would expect more from west coast brewers. It is especially strange because their Ruination IPA is just delicious! My advice: go with Ruination IPA"

"not gonna go into too much detail on this one, it's very interesting I tried this after having sculpin for the first time, and the bitterness was indeed refreshingly bitter as greg koch described it (not this beer specifically but craft beer in the early days as a reaction to big brew swill) in a talk he gave I found on youtube. this is a very good beer and one i can see myself going back to, it's certainly not as vicious the bottle would lead you to believe but it's a very good beer and better for being a little less bitter than described"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Supremely delicious and crisp! My first and favourite IPA."
"Grapefruit.  Hoppy.  Strong.  Drinkable.    First taste is light and somewhat watery but prolonged bitter aftertaste rescues it.  An enjoyable IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've had this from bottles a number of times, but on tap, this is extra nice.  There is a dank weedy hop presence on the end that I'm really grooving on."

"This is as close a beer I've ever tasted to my favourite IPA, Driftwood's Fat Tug. That said, it is absolutely great! Great balance between the citrus and pine aromas and flavours. Not much for tropical fruits like mango, pineapple and else. So not an easy juicy IPA by any mean. This one is for the IPA connoisseur!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite IPAs. Has a great hoppy flavor, which is just the right bitterness. I also appreciate the label, the gargoyle is pretty BA. If you like hops, you'll like this IPA"

"Smooth drinking for all this is, which is a perfect example of a beer for those who enjoy hops without much else getting in the way. Not overly complex. Highly drinkable. Grade A stuff."
""
"This beer is great. Amazing flavor with a lingering back end bitterness that seems to affect the mouth increasingly as the time between sips increases. Similar to getting out of a pool when it's cold. The flavor Keeps you coming back for more. So jump back in that water because it gets cold when you're out too long!"

"Single 12 oz. bottle poured into a Lagunitas mason jar style mug (yeah, yeah, I know!). A classy light copper color with frothy beige head leaving nice rich lacing on the glass. Aroma is herbal and spicy, with some grapefruit, zesty orange, papaya, and pine undertones. Deep, rich hop flavor and a smooth, near-creamy mouthfeel. Herbal and earthy rather than aggressively fruity, although certainly there are clear citrus, peach, and pineapple notes. This fits the hop bill, heavy on Chinook and Columbus. Extremely drinkable despite the bitter resinous punch. Getting almost a cola-like brown spice in the dry herbal/woody finish. Some bready caramel malts lurk beneath the hops and this sweetness becomes more pronounced as one's tongue acclimatizes to the bitterness. Leaves a very pleasing impression of complexity and poise. Deserves its good reputation and does offer something different from other west coast IPAs."
"99? What? I love Stone beers, but hate this one. Mine is fresh according to the bottle, but WAY too grassy, and off putting. Just a nasty beer, and I don't get the fan fare with this. Where are the grapefruit, piney, citrus notes that you get in a West Coast IPA? Just completely non-existent with my particular beer."
"It meets all the marks I expect out of an IPA. Hoppy flavor, a little bitter, but overall very smooth and flavorful."
""
""
"One of the many great beers floating in the sea of IPA's. It lacks the citrus flavor that many IPA brews house, yet it isn't too bitter. It never fails to disappoint."
""
"You can never go wrong with Stone IPA.  Such an excellent well balanced delicious beer that is widely available. Always my fall back crutch for beer when I'm in a hurry or just wanna get something I know I'll like. Love it"

""

""
""
"Pours a light gold with a two finger,  white head. The aroma is very hoppy. Lemon, orange juice, grapefruit, pine, sap, and a little malt sweetness. The flavor follows the nose very closely. There is a bit more of a malt presence, but that is very well balanced by the high IBUs. I've had so many IPA lately, this is better than I remembered."

"Overall this is a prototype California-style IPA.  I personally really have to be in the mood for IPA, and when I do partake I tend to prefer the east-coast styles for their more apparent malts (Dogfish Head 60-Minute, for instance.)  However this beer's reputation is well deserved, and I could definitely see myself enjoying this again."

"Sweet citrus ripped away by bitter pine and bitter herb rounding back to a bread malt background with some sweet mango notes. A very aggressive and complex brew. A very solid IPA that can run with the big dogs, but is not leading the pack."

"Vegetable after taste. Hmmm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Recently rediscovered this very widely available classic. Definitely a little bit of an acquired appreciation with this one. Clean, original and dare I say dank. Gosh darn good craft brew, and at 6.9 percent I can actually enjoy more than one. Way better than ruination imo."

"Good India Pale Ale.  Similar (I think) to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale"
""

"Intense but flavorful and reasonably well balanced. The alcohol and hop qualities are slightly attenuated by some malt sweetness and smooth carbonation, but the former still verge on overwhelming."

"This pours a semi-clear golden yellow color with a slight head. The aroma is bold with hops. The taste is bitter, dry, and perhaps one of the best IPA brews on the market. Outstanding and a must try!"
"Slightly hazy straw colored body. Good amount of white fluffy head. Pungent hoppy earthy aroma. Very bitter flavor. Lots of citrus flavors. Tasty!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a delicious, super smooth IPA. Very drinkable with only a little bit of bitter aftertaste. It smells and tastes pretty grapefruit-y. The bitterness is well balanced with some sweetness, like fresh citrus zest and pith. It's surprisingly refreshing. I could drink this one every day."

"Pour is golden with a modest touch of amber. A medium to thin head reduces at a quick pace to leave sticky lace coating the glass. The nose is robust and smells of hop and touches of citrus and earthy grasses and pine abound. Bitter hops greet the pallet as do a moderate but appreciated malt under current. This IPA is really quite gentle on the tongue which makes it quite easy to enjoy more than one. A nice dry finish rounds out this quality beer."
"It's still a very good IPA but of course Enjoy By and Ruination are a bit better in every way."
"12 oz Bottle.Very very solid beer.Ipa at a respectable 6.9 abv.Of course not as good as say a Ruination from Stone but still a solid semi functional brew.I use the term functional very loosely because if you drink to many of these brews they can easily get a way from you.Great flavor as you would expect from Stone and it seems like it`s in my frig all the time meaning it`s easy to find.  I do love Stone beers."

"Really good IPA, and great labeling."

"Before trying this beer I was a fan of the Pale Ales and darks but this IPA has grown on me quickly because of its hoppiness. Very crisp on the tongue and lingers nicely. A good summer beer elsewhere but great anytime in its home town and mine. I could not give it a perfect score because I believe there is always room for improvement. However, I am definitely a fan now."

"Appearance is a dark yellow/orange color with a nice khaki head that trails the glass. The smell is full of floral and grapefruit notes. Taste is similar but with a refreshing crisp bite after the hops that is very refreshing and leaves the drinker wanting more. The mouthfeel on mine was a little over carbonated but good nonetheless. Overall I really enjoyed this one, especially for a reasonably priced IPA."

"wow, Stone Brewing, you go !!!. Great color and head with nice lacing. Hops is awesome and flavor is awesome with hops, and citrus and finidhing with more hops and some citrusy-grapefruit finishing. Great balanced brew and one of the top 20 IPAs I have had. Probably top 10. The balance, as I stated before is incredible with the perfect amount of grapefruit and hops, its hard to believe !!!"
"O - Very bold and tasty. I heard a lot of good things about this beer. But this was way more than I expected. My favorite IPA to date. Cheers!"

""
""

"Poured a gorgeous cloudy rich golden color with a slight orange tint and a thin cap of white foam. A very nice looking body, but a slightly disappointing head. Scents of pine resin, lemon zest, melon, earthy hops and a faint hint of biscuit on the finish. A nice overall aroma profile that is very hop forward. Flavor begins highly bitter with strong notes of pine resin and citrus peel, with a little hint of pale malt. This moves into a fairly bitter middle with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and pith, some floral and earthy hop flavors and hints of alcohol. Finish is medium-dry with notes of pine resin, grapefruit peel and a faint hint of biscuit-like malt. Aftertaste is dry with Nora of pine resin and grapefruit peel, with a faint grainy flavor. There is also a very mild, though present, pale malt backbone that barely balances the bitter hop flavors. A good IPA flavor profile that fits the classic West Coast mold. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with resinous, oily slick feel with medium-low carbonation. A nice mouthfeel that keeps the overall impression light and easy to drink. Overall this is a classic example of a West Coast IPA. It doesn't do anything new or experimental, but it does provide a wonderfully hoppy and refreshing drinking experience and highlights the general strengths of Stone's recipes and brewers. Quite the nice core offering and highly recommended."

"As the bottom falls out of the malts, its sweetness recedes quickly and allows the hops to develop into a smoothly resinous bittering, that intensifies to the proportions of freshly torn pine needles, bark and sap. Still, its pithy citrus sharpness ensures a high level of refreshment and drinkability as the ale concludes with resolute dryness."
""
""
"To me, this is what IPAs are all about! Poured heavy into a pint glass from a bottle, it looks wonderful with a deep golden/ amber color. It also has a nice thick foamy head. It has a sweet grassy smell with a slight hint of citrus. The taste is absolutely wonderful! Its smooth and fresh with a crisp bite and smooth notes of pine and citrus. I love how well everything is blended together and lays out perfectly. Truly a world class IPA! Without a doubt one of my new favorites!"

"Re-review: Out of a bottle. Smell is piney and citrusy. Taste is grapefruit and pine. The bitterness is balanced out nicely with bready malts. Not as bitter as I remember it. The taste seems subdued as well. Not as piney as I thought it was. I had this not too long ago and thought it was as good as ever, but for some reason it just doesn't live up to what I remember. I'm not sure if it's a bad batch or my palate has just evolved a lot."
""
"At clear honey in the glass, with a thin head, but a good amount of lacing. Smells fresh, and faintly of hops, but not floral, so I'm ready for a sip. Nice carbonation. Hops, peppery spice, and a nice bitter finish. One for the fridge, which I will undoubtedly have many more times as it is now readily available out East."

"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into pint glass. No head and little carbonation. You can definitely smell the hops.  Taste is an immediate rush of hops, but smooth.  Well balanced at 6.9 abv. This is a very drinkable west coast ipa, one of the best. That being said, there a very similar ipas readily availabe in most stores in kc that are more affordable and just as good in quality.   This is a great ipa though."

"I heavily favored torpedo for my stand-by extra ipa, but this stone product has all the qualities that I have found in torpedo, with an added little spiciness of mild cloves on the front end of the taste that lingers into the middle sipping of the sound hop base. An extraordinarily drinkable and pleasing ipa."

"Good beer however not 100% my style of IPA. I personally prefer the hops, bitterness and power of a double IPA. I will definitely no knock it for its unique flavor and scent. It has a great golden tint to it a dang IPA should and a decent smell with a slight citric note. A little to sweet for me but is easy and smooth going down. A great IPA for this with sensitive taste buds!"

"Medium to heavy body for an IPA with slightly above average carbonation. Nice chewy feel with a bit of agressive prickliness from the hops as well."
"Served out of a bottle into a Trillium pub glass. Golden in color, much less hazy than many of the beers I've been seeing lately. Smells pleasant, noticeable hop smell, but nothing too heavy imo. The bitterness at the end caught me off guard first sip, but I am enjoying the heck out of it now. Not overly carbonated, great mouthfeel, almost creamy. Leaving heavy lacing left behind. Overall, I am happy to have grabbed a 6 of this very well crafted beverage, at a price I felt was fair."

"Stone ipa is a house hold name. It is simply great, I've had exclusive brews, seasonal brews, and this india ale is simply one of the best they have to offer. It tastes a lot better than their other brews. It is perfected with the right amount of hops and is a bit harsh for the normal drinker. Though this specific brew is a lot lighter than its brothers. It is not to be taking lightly this is a strong beer flavorful with dark citrus and coffee residue. It is a must try by anyone and a regular basis drink in the household."

"Pours with a lustrous golden orange color and a sticky, foamy head. the aroma has a bright and fruity hop bitterness, with a mild bready sweetness to provide some balance. The flavor likewise has a solid malt backbone, but the powerful bitterness dominates, albeit without being over-the-top abrasive. The mouthfeel is resinous, but the beer is still tremendously drinkable. Overall, this is one of the beers that I think exemplifies the prototypical West-coast IPA. It's like sunshine on a cloudy day. Boom."

"Overall a great IPA. I misjudged this one at first. Stone's brews are all excellent! This is great but they make so many DIPA's I prefer more."
"This beer pours a deep golden amber color with barely a finger of head. The aroma is amazing with a big burst of pine and citrus. This was one of my first ipas ever about a year ago, and it was extremely bitter. After a year of letting ipas wreck my palate this still packs a punch, but it is a much more enjoyable bitterness. Honestly I wish more ipas were still this bitter to me. Besides the bitterness the taste overall is amazing with citrus, bready/caramel malt, and BIG pine which helps amplify the bitterness. Overall, this is a great ipa and one that got me into loving the style. This is the perfect beer for the ipa lover, but if your new to the style the bitterness could be overwhelming. (91/100)"
""
""
""
""
"Difficult one for me, I have become accustomed to PNW brews and this hangs way over on the citrusy side, from the aroma to the taste I just live n a different part of the world I bought this due to the BA rating so I respect where it comes from but there are just to many better options so I will not return to this one."
""
"O - overall this is a great American IPA, great hop flavor and balance with a nice crisp dry finish. Regarding my verticle with ruination, this doesn't have nearly the hop flavor, or malt sweetness, but provides a little more balance, certainty two very different beers as this is more lighter and crisp."

"Cloudy light copper with a finger of soapy head that sticks around. Classic IPA smell: A flowery aroma with some grapefruit, orange, lemon zest, and clean crackery malt. Stone touts on the label, ""to say that this gem of an IPA is 'hoppy' would be putting it modestly."" Maybe that was true with this beer debuted, but to the modern palate, the hop level here is manageable if not average. That's a good thing for those of us who like balance in a hoppy beer. The taste is crisp and refreshing with a citrusy payload, a neutralizing malt backbone, and an oniony, earthy character that lingers in the background. I think one of the most underrated aspects of drinking beer is the aftertaste you get when you breathe out through your nose after a glass, and Stone IPA is the best beer I know of when it comes to these bonus flavors: it has a nice herbal and flowery aftertaste. Overall it's my favorite of the Stone offerings that I've tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Stone continues to impress me. This is an outstanding and easy to drink IPA. Very similar to the Enjoy By IPA I recently had but lacks the overall freshness, but to be expected. At $9.99 for a six pack in most places, you can't go wrong."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thus far, one of the best IPA's I have had in a long time. It has a fantastic hoppy flavor that manages to still be smooth. You could easily drink this one over and over while maintaining a full flavor IPA. Good beer for party or casual drinking...."

"Poured from a bottle with a hazy golden yellow color and a decently foamy white head. Has a very nice hoppy floral aroma. Taste is kind of sweet up front, dominated by floral notes with touches of citrus. The finish is a surprising amount of bitterness that lingers a while. The beer has a nice full body feel with some carbonation. This is very refreshing and enjoyable."
""
""

""
"Light amber to brown in color. A minuscule bit of white head partially covers the top of the beer. A bit hazy with Brussels lacing. Incredibly enticing aroma of pine like hops reminiscent of pineapple greets me. The mouth is a little sticky and the bitterness prickles my tongue. When I take a sip I get a short but sharp burst of pine like hops and then some light malt to back it up. I get a nice gentle bitter fade."

"Very solid IPA. Not as overly floral as some IPAs. Very well balanced. Citrus grapefruit smell and taste. Very smooth, the 6.9% can launch a sneak attack without warning. Even though this beer was released more than a decade ago and was ahead of the curve at the time, it still holds its own very well."
"A show-all trend setter for pure India Pale Ale amongst the ranks. This foundation of a brew should be mocked and chased after by all breweries. Light flavor with rich-heavy after taste, smooth and golden color, hop notes are balanced, not the focal point of the beer. Overall well-slated IPA."

"The hops are of a blend of fresh-cut grass, holiday wreath, and green onions. A modicum of sweet malt combines with additional hop flavors to create a mild, sweet orange-creme nuance. The chlorophyll-leafy and green onion-like pungency and bitterness has always turned me off enough with Stone's beers not to have any urge to order a pint or buy a bottle. Some of their darker beers exhibit these qualities, but a couple actually taste pretty good. I'm seriously going to have to find out which of the hops they use offends me. Or is it the yeast? It bugs me, because a lot of people love their beers.... Then again, none of their beers below 6% abv score above 4 on here. Maybe there's my answer... Gonna see what Levitation has to offer."

"12 oz into tulip glass. I had heard so many good things about Stone, and this being my first beer of theirs, I was not disappointed! This is all that you expect from an IPA: Bold, hoppy, whamma bama crocodile slammah! Glad I bought the full six pack."
""
"A tangerine colored body with a finger’s breadth of fluffy white head comprised of various sizes of bubbles. Average retention and generous wet lacing. Aroma is of pine, citrus (orange and lemon with a dash of grapefruit), grass, and a bit of caramel malt (hint of age on the bottle, I suppose). Flavor draws a bit more malt, but still generous doses of lemon, grapefruit, and pine up front. Bitter, earthen hops dominate the middle and finish. Lively body with perfect carbonation, dry, bitter finish. Overall, a well balanced IPA that is a great example of the style. I do wish Stone had a more robust bottle dating system (the date was wiped off this bottle), but it’s still fresh enough to be enjoyable."
""
"I'll come back to it and review it again in the summer...maybe the change in weather will help? I must say I've been drinking a lot of very hoppy IPAs lately, so my buds are all juiced up!"

"As a huge fan of all of Stones offerings, I am finally getting around to tasting one of their simpler, less in your face ales. Pours a handsome hazy orange with almost notes of green in the light with a slight white head and substantial lacing. The nose is somewhat subtle for a west coast ipa. Floral and citrus hops, some pine and a little malt. It definitely smells very fresh and lively. The flavor is perfect west coast ipa. Bitter and hoppy, tons of pine and citrus. Just a little malt to offset the bitter but not so much to take away from the fresh flavors of the hops. The mouth is light and easy drinking. A little dry on the finish but in the best way. This is the benchmark for west coast ipas. If they all tasted like this the world would be a better place."

"O. This is a very well crafted ale. I assume this beer falls off as it ages so I'm fortunate to review it while fresh. I greatly enjoy the peppery tingle from a fresh ipa. An excellent balance of pine and citrus notes from the hops. I don't enjoy hop bombs so this is right up my alley. Not overly aggressive but a decent amount of bitterness."

"A damn fine IPA overall. I love that Stone prints the Enjoy By dates on their bottles. As a conscious shopper, I like knowing how fresh my hoppy beers truly are after being burned one too many times. This just adds more appeal to Stone's beers. Anyway, this is a really great beer that deserves it's own merits."

"O: Man, oh man... I'm a fan of dark brews, but this one has my palette-preferences playing tug-o-war! This is without a doubt one of the finest, easiest-drinking IPAs that has ever graced my mouth. My wallet is currently shuddering at the thought of how many sixers of this I'll be buying in the future."
""
""
""
"O: A beautiful creation that allows you to find the malt sweetness without missing the hoppy goodness. For me, this beer is a great choice for those who don't consider themselves 'hopheads' . It is definitely a hop forward libation but it gives you a glimpse of the underlying grains that are the groundwork of a good IPA."

"O - A very, very enjoyable American IPA. One sip leads to another and another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer put out by stone( as usual) and is always a constant in my fridge... Reminds me of Ballast Points ""Sculpin IPA"" but just a tad more bitter. Its the perfect example of a west coast hop bomb. Really glad im able to get this year round as well. If you're a hop head - go out right now and buy this beer."

"Overall: this a great sipper for dinner or other formal occasion."
""
""
"O: One of the hoppier IPAs out there then again this is Stone; it almost tastes like a DIPA but not quite as much alcohol which lets the flavors show more on their own. Fantastic balance and a wonderful beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"This has a great lingering bitterness. It's dank, bitter, and earthy, three great things in a IPA. You can find this one most places and it's at a great price. One of the best IPAs on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
"Transarent, golden, with a thick & sudsy head that leaves behind a lot of lacing: gorgeous IPA, looks similar to their ENJOY BY. Aroma is more restrained than I expected but very nice: all grapefruit and floral hops but not overwhelming as some IPAs can be IMO. Great malt background compliments the hops which are fruity and assertive but not overwhelming in terms of bitterness. Finishes very dry. One bottle really makes me want another."
""
""
""
"While I am often critical of Stone (highly overrated in my opinion as a brewery), this is a solid beer. Not as overblown as some of their other IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Given the style in mind, Stone knocks this out of the park. I'm use to heavier IPAs at this point and I had to keep reminding myself of that during this review. I really like their lineup and this is a great start to the world of craft beer. If you're ready to move up, give ruination a try maybe an Enjoy By IPA? Definitely a journey for the taste buds."

"The Stone IPA is the definition of a West Coast IPA, and it’s all hops! The hops are fresh and citrusy with a slight malty sweetness. It poured a nice golden body with a creamy head. This is an easy drinking IPA which I have no trouble taking down. Very impressive for a standard line-up IPA."

"Not that interesting to me. They probably used a crapton of bittering hops, but didn't really get a whole lot of aromatic hops on there. Disappointing, given that this is the first time I've actually had it. Average IPA, not worth revisiting again. However, Enjoy By and Ruination are much better efforts by Stone. I'd recommend looking for these instead."

"Now, don't get Raul wrong; it's solid down the line, but not amazing like having Nina Agdal over at 2 AM ""amazing."" The main drawback is what Raul would call a ""strict"" taste/bite in the end.

"Poured into a tulip wine glass. Nice creamy white head that disappeared quickly. Fantastic nose. Notes of citrus are perfect. Very subtle. Very blended and smooth. Lights up my tonque perfectly with small tight carbonation. Perfect level of carbonation. Taste is very sophisticated and smooth. Leaves a nice bitter finish and is not too strong, just right. Very awesome lacing with sticky bubbles ""glued"" to the side of the glass. No taste of alcohol, very well hidden in the hoppiness. The afterglass on this beer matches the original sip perfectly. How did they do this? This has been on my wish list for a while and I found it at a Whole Foods store. I really like this beer a lot! Will definitely be purchasing more."

"DATE TASTED: October 2, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Duvel tulip... OCCASION: the Browns on primetime TV--a chance at 3-2!...APPEARANCE: orange-peach hazy body supports a thick crunchy near-white head; beautiful display of bubbles with cirrus lacing... AROMA: as remembered, this IPA slams a pinecone of citrus orange peel up the nostrils, with a bit of apple too...PALATE: full-bodied, immersing the tongue in a bitter bath of effervescence; aggressively active in its aftertaste...TASTE: a crushing hops avalanche--alcohol is well hidden but warming--and enough malt to balance (?!) the mad mix-- a true feat...OVERALL: spending a summer discussing the best IPAs with a few colleagues made me want to review a few from the hallowed halls, and one of the first true west coast gems I indulged in was this label-less intimidator...Stone delivers the Cali attitude befitting its gargoyled mascot..."

"It's very apparent of the continual excellence this quaff has accrued. Good looking craft having a generous head with staying power. Resonant hop bud release. Crisp and light which can be a relief away from my unsatiable thirst for the Imperials. Problem also for me is that there are too many choices on the menu. Priced right and readily available fresh. Craft that pleases most. Going into my steady rotation. Keep up the good work!"

"Really solid, straightforward IPA from Stone. Pours a deep amber with a white head that dissipates into a thin layer of tiny bubbles in a minute or two. Aroma is hops and lemony citrus, and the flavor is earthy and herbal, quite bitter, and just a slight sweetness competing with that. Clocking in at just under 7% abv, the mouthfeel is slick, bracing, and moderately carbonated. Not a lot of bells and whistles on this one, and truth be told I like my IPAs a bit sweeter, but this guy is of fine, fine quality, and a great value at ten bucks a sixer. Clean, tight, simple beauty of the style."

"O: good hoppy american IPA but not remarkable ... not these days when every American craft brewery makes three versions of this style; that is not to say it's a bad brew -- far from it, it's just fine *and* readily available for a decent price, so when in doubt, Stone's IPA works well."

"Overall: Enjoyed this one. I usually like my IPAs a little sweeter but like what Stone did here. In my opinion a lot of the very bitter IPAs don't have much flavor, just dry dry dry, but this one is dry with impactful flavor. Think the mouthfeel is what I appreciated the most though, very light. Good summer IPA."
"O - Classic bitterness profile starting modestly and then just letting the flood gates go. More so than usual, very one sided beer which I am beginning to warm up to more. Aroma pops out but lacks some dimension, flavor is also the same story. That mouthfeel is perfect and should be emulated. A cornerstone of the American IPA style."

"O - 4.5 - probably way above average on this rating, but this is so much better than other IPA s you can pick up at any grocery store. Out of Union Jack, Hop Notch, Torpedo Extra IPA, Lagunitas IPA, etc I think this really takes the cake. It s just that good. Sculpin and Pliny may be better, and the day someone finds me a sixer of either of those for less I'll buy them first. but until then --> Stone IPA!"

"O - Good IPA., but I rate it a bit low compared to the average on this one. Love Stone and Love IPA's, but this and some of their other beers, just fall short with me for some reason. I plan to give it another try to see if my taste buds are just not quite on today."
""

"Pours a brite gold color with an inch of rocky bone white head. Aroma, well, there isn't much going on here. Faint malt scent, muted pine hops. Hope this gets better. Flavor follows the scents, muddled hops, muted malt presence. Nice mouthfeel, I'm sure these fine bubbles would help scrub the bitterness from my pallate... if there was any. Overall, I've had american pale ales that blow this beer out of the water. I will add a caveat to this review, I started my night out with alpha king and had this beer right after eating some crackers to ""cleanse"" my pallate. I also expected an ipa to bring more to the party than it little brother. I will be revisiting this beer, but my initial impression is that stone may be needing a facelift with this brew."

"Overall: I am the reason we offer this beer in the bar I work at, being in charge of beer/liquor orders has greatly expanded our collection and quality, and this is the premiere IPA we offer after the Stone RuinTen, very popular, economical, and allows Guinness to float on it beautifully for a nice stout Black 'n Tan or Doberman. This is one of the beers I always have stocked at home, and will never allow to be 86'd in the bar. I highly recommend this beer to everyone who is expanding their beer horizon. Keep up the excellent work Stone."
"O: It's a good beer. I did enjoy this beer better than the other Stone beers I've had, which were the Arrogant Bastard, Gotterdammerung and Self-Righteous beers. I can't wait to try the other ones mentioned. It was smooth for me, had a hint of sweet taste without an overpowering hop flavor. I did try and orange slice with it, and it gave an additional positive flavor to it, smoothing it out more, but not much more. Good Job Stone, you have a returning buyer."

"This IPA isn't the most complex of its kind, but it's so eminently drinkable. Certainly one of my favorite go to beers of the summer. Always have wished that the flavors interacted more rather than hitting the palate in distinct phases. But certainly an IPA I recommend for individuals wanting to tread in a more hoppy direction."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the standard by which I measure all IPAs, and since I can get it for $9.99 a six pack, it's a great deal too."
""
""
""

""
""

"Bottle. Gold pour with ivory white head. Aroma is heavy pine, a whole coniferous forest’s worth. Some sweetness too slightly citrusy or some pineapple. Taste is definately piney and grapefruit with an extra bitter finish. Good sparkling mouthfeel with a bitter dry taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served from tap into a plastic ""bud-light"" cup at a local music club. Great IPA aroma; herbal, citrusy, slightly earthy, along with toasty bready notes. Nice thick head that dissapates into a sheet of lacing (even on a plastic cup) and a fine layer of bubbles that remains on top of the brew. Taste is pure hop bitterness! Herbal hop variety; very piney, some orange pith and grapefruit zest; malt profile is hidden under the hop barrage but very little is to be had in terms of malt complexity or residual sweetness. Very dry and assertive. Medium thin mouthfeel. Overall a very aggressive IPA and the benchmark set by Stone. I much prefer the sweeter, less herbal taste of Sierra Nevada torpedo extra IPA, or even the juicy-fruit bomb that is 'Stone's Enjoy' By line. Just my own personal tastes. Fans of a botanical, earthy, bitter IPA love this beer and rightly so."
"Overall a well-crafted IPA except for some issues in the finish."

"Oddly, I loved Ruination, which is even more hoppy than this. Perhaps my taste buds do not appreciate certain hops. I'll take the slightly more pricey IPAs from another California company, Firestone Walker, over this any day. And for not a lot more than half the price, SN Torpedo will suffice to satisfy my hop cravings."

"Taste is a short fruity sweetness closely follwed by a big piney hop presence that lingers on your palate.. I quess until the next morning ;) I have to admit I like my IPA more balanced. This is just pure hop bitterness, with almost no malts to back it up. If you are a hop head go for it, if not stay with the more balanced East Coast IPAs"

"Overall I thought this was a pretty nice beer and an above average IPA, it had a pretty nice hop profile that stayed away from the heavy citrus and tropical fruit components and it relied on some nice floral hops to take the helm and I thought that worked out nicely. This beer had decent drinkability, it wasn't the smoothest, but the flavors did a decent job at holding my attention and I think one or two of these would be good enough for me, the bitterness and lighter body might start to wear on me after awhile. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty damn good with the aroma doing a great job at highlighting those floral hops. What I liked the least about this beer was the balance, I know IPA's are suppose to highlight the hops, but I think a maltier base would help this beer a little. I don't know if I would buy a six pack of this anytime soon, but I wouldn't mind ordering this at a bar/restaurant and I think this could pair well with some spicy food, I recommend this to any IPA lover and people who like the floral hops, I also thought it was priced nicely. All in all I thought this was a pretty solid IPA, there's some aspects that I think could be improved upon, but for the most part is was a pretty good straight forward American IPA and the more I drank it the more I liked the hop profile. This isn't my favorite IPA, but it's far from my least favorite, I would say it's a little above being right in the middle, but if I was in the mood for a floral hop heavy beer I would choose Two Hearted Ale over this. Good job Stone this is one solid IPA, I have no clue what took me some long to try it but I'm glad I finally did, keep up the good work guys."

"Overall 3.5: Good IPA and certainly different from the many other IPAs that seem to proliferate the bottle shops. The featured hop in this brew is distinctive; very clever and well-thought out of the brewmaster at Stone. Nonetheless, this IPA is not perfect (IMHO), but it is very good. Sessionable, but probably not all that great with food. I see the floral hop interfering/clashing with certain flavor profiles. Nonetheless, certainly worth trying this beer if you have never had the privilege."

"Pours light amber, almost golden color with this foamy head, around 2 finger width. Head retention and lacing are both great!! Great hoppy, citrus aroma. Excellent citrus malty taste to start, followed great piney, hoppy burst. Citrusy, acidic, bitter aftertaste at the end. This is definitely one of my favorites. A high end IPA for sure."

"Amazing beer. My favorite of all time. No matter what I try I keep coming back for more. Wasn't in love at first, but it grew on me and continues to do so. Very floral and fruity with multiple layers of complexity. Perfect hop bitterness lingers just long enough. Just enough malt to balance the powerful hops. Perfect head which adheres to the glass to remind you it is disappearing by the sip. I buy it by the case whenever I can find it! I've tried many beers that are rated higher on this site, but none come close to the perfection of this beer for me. This beer has an unspeakable quality about it that is hard to describe but that I grow to appreciate more and more each year. I would buy the company if I could!"

"Poured into becker pint glass. Clear yellow-gold with lots of carbonation and a thick fizzy white head that fades a bit into a thick puck of foam. Smell is lots of floral and citrusy hops. Lots of lacing on the glass after my first sip; taste is clean malts, not quite sweet, with some citrusy hop flavors and tons of bitterness over the slight sticky malt aftertaste. A great and unique IPA, worth trying for anyone who loves hoppy beers."
""
""
"O: People warn that this IPA is extremely bitter, but it really isn't that bitter. It is rather crisp for being an IPA, and very drinkable. It is definitely one of my favorite IPAs, but I mostly drink DIPAs and TIPAs when I am in the mood for something hoppy."

""

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, best before 8/26/13 nice. Poured down the center and got a massive 2 inch white billowy head, that leaves beautiful lacing. The beer itself is a yellow orange and a little hazy. The smell is grapefruit, pine, tangerine, and pineapple. Taste is all of that, with grapefruit being most dominant in the beginning and the end, with the other flavors lending a hand in the middle. Body is medium, plenty of life, on the dry side, and very drinkable. This really one of the greats! Like someone else said, a bench mark. I haven't had many better."

"Usualy on tap around my parts... Real nice orangey gold with a light cream/white head. Very fruity up front with some of stones Special B trademark flavours. If there are all the light lager beers on tap all over the place I am almost sure to see this guy hidden in the mix. Stone is a benchmark for craft breweries in SD and deserves to be beside the ""giants"" dt its stand for craft breweries... Dont be surprised if Stone is the first craft brewery gone wild."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is probably my favorite single IPA. It is pretty aggressive with the hops, very explosive, yet it is still fairly well balanced. I like it way better than Two Hearted Ale and any other IPA that I've tried. Stone Brewing company is my favorite brewery; they never disappoint."

" This was a strong, beer that grows on you as you drink. I didn't find the same cocky personality in this that I have found in other Stone beers and I think I missed that. I also think that the fruit character suffered in the attempt to make it intensely bitter without provoking it sufficiently first. The malt came out more and more to show that it was indeed stronger than you might have realized. The hop character engaged you more and more as well as the expansive bitter just kept unfolding and at the end of the bottle I was mysteriously satisfied."

"Well was introduced to craft beer 10 years ago and been a member of BA for almost as long. Decided to start reviewing them 10, ye ars later one at a time. Well havent had stone in quite awhile and decided to give this one a go and it is how i remembered . An over rated ipa boosted by incredible word of mouth and marketing. Not bad at all just overrated and waaay overhyped. Above average ipa at best and would be curious where this would score in a blind test without the benefit of all the hype."

"Big boy bottle poured into a pint glass. Gorgeous copper color, slight haze, generous slightly off-white head. Aggressive aroma, big hops, good citrus, floral. Not as clean of a finish as I think you see from a lot of IPAs, but I think that's a good thing as there's nothing to complain about with the after taste here. Another outstanding offering from Stone."

"Overall - I've had Stone IPA on several occasions, but this is the first time I've had it in quite a while. At first drink, believe it or not, I kinda felt that it tasted a little watery. But then I realized that my perception has been altered somewhat by my recent consumption of many bold high alcohol IPAs, porters and stouts. However, once I reached the bottom of the glass, I was enjoying this quite a bit, and was pleasantly reminded of my previous dalliances with this beer. Overall, this is a great beer. If you're looking for something more bold and daring, reach for the Ruination or Arrogant Bastard. But if you're craving something more drinkable, less bitter, and, dare I say, sessionable, go with the IPA!"
""
""
"O: Perhaps the quintessential West Coast IPA and definitely one of my new favorite IPAs overall (if not THE favorite). If it wasn't for the high price being this far from Cali, I would certainly buy it on a more regular basis."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite IPAs. I love how there are hops all throughout this beer but it doesn't over power it. A good IPA for any time, even summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is one of my go to beers. Stone is dependable, their IPA is a great addition to their suburb collection."
"I find that Stone IPA's excellence sneaks up on you. The appearance and head are fine but nothing dramatic in terms of size or museum-quality lacing or anything. The aroma is somewhat tightly wound, at least coming from the bottle, and it is subtle though nicely complex--dank hops with with a surprising, orangey-grapefruit fruitiness that tells me this beer was made by people who have a sense of composition and desire to combine flavors in an at least somewhat out of the box way. So then I drink. And drink. And it goes down so incredibly easily, but the complexity of the nose is still there in the palate, and the finish on the back of the tongue, while somewhat short, has a pleasant bite, and it is so tantalizing. Can I do that again? And again? In part because of the company's over the top ad copy, there is this sense that Stone is bad ass, but this standard IPA seduces slowly but completely. The Billie Holiday of IPAs?"
""
""
""
""
"Bottom line: this is an outstanding IPA that delivers a plentifully flavorful punch that puts some lesser DOUBLE IPAs to shame. Stone rules."

"o: This is the quintessential IPA. This was a pleasure to drink and I would be blessed if there was more in my fridge (there is not). As I am reviewing this beer I am taking sips between every two or three words - I cannot keep it out of my hands. Very positive experience!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent nose ..very citrusy and clean. malts integrated but not pushy. overall hop dominated. very nice summer beer, it cools you off. lingering chewy pine aftertaste but not palate wrecking easy to drink. high acidity from hops. alcohol well hidden at 6.9% abv. nice head until the end. good pub or outdoor beer; only improves as it heats up."
"Overall: An amazing brew in every single aspect. If you love hops, IPA's or just something crisp, bitter and challenging, you'll love this beer. If you don't, you'll probably be put off by the intensity of it all."

"O - This is very good, very drinkable, a good example of an IPA. It's neither as thick nor flavorful as a DIPA, but there's certainly no lack of hops, and it provides surprising balance and complexity. For my personal tastes, I'm not big into the malty flavor, which is accentuated as the beer warms up. I don't think it makes it a bad beer; I think it's quite intentional, and well-crafted."

"Pours out to a creamy white head, concentric rings of lace, and hazy golden color. Aroma is ""c" hops and sticky Carapils malt with notes of pine, citrus and cilantro. Flavor is a world class blend of pungent hops in your face, pale malt backdrop and lingering alpha acid bite. Mouthfeel is light to medium and carries the flavors well. On the whole, a damn fine American IPA made by people who stake thier rep on quality and craftsmanship."

""
"The wonderful bitterness and fruity pop is great, but I don't care too much for the grassy lingering finish. Exceptional IPA, but I prefer Centennial and Union Jack. A good dry hoppy IPA."

"Poured this 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. This American IPA poured a hazy golden color, produced a thick creamy head, excellent retention and excellent lacing. The aroma consisted of malted grain, citrus and pine. Medium in body, this AIPA has a foundation of malted grain, biscuit, fruity easter and dominant piney hops. Bitter and well balanced- Nice example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Like some other beers I've tried of it's type, I think it's only real fault is that the body/mouthfeel is really too light to support the flavors contained therein. This would've been even better at a heavier concentration."

"To me this beer is the benchmark for any good IPA. When I drink an IPA I always compare it to Stone because it is my favorite beer to drink. It's the beer that I always seem to come back to and always enjoy. It has a good ABV, but it is hidden well. The smell is fantastic and you can really smell the hops. The taste is very in your face like any IPA, but in a good way. The taste is very hoppy and with a hint of pine. This is a great beer and a staple for any craft beer drinker."

"O - Still one of my favorite, go-to IPAs. I'll advocate for Stone where ever I go."

"Overall: One of my favorite IPAs, this is what I think all west coast IPAs should measure up to. The aroma and taste are out of this world and I will be buying this over and over again. I may be in the extreme minority, but I prefer this over a Ruination. Which is kind of odd considering I love DIPAs typically a little bit more, and I still love Ruination, but this just blows every other single IPA out of the water. This is one of the beers that converted me full time to craft beer. Perfect on every level."

Medium body and low carbonation. Good beer!"

Only real complaint is that it was not very well carbonated, very small head."

I've never had an IPA that had all the characteristics I look for, yet washes clean and begs for more without sacrificing body. This is a home run. Cheers.

"This is the IPA that got me into hoppier beers to begin with. When i was younger, i had Ranger IPA and thought very little of IPAs till my uncle (from California) got me a Stone sampler which included this flagship IPA. I will TRY to rate this IPA as objectively as possible... It pours a nice honey with very little bubbles. About a 2 finger creamy-white head with medium lacing. Tastes start with a strong hop presence (duh) then onto slight fruit notes, maybe a faint bit of apricot. The mouthfeel is whole and pleasant. Overall a very good IPA. Anyone who is thinking of trying an IPA, I recommend this one. Honestly, one of the best IPAs out there and one of my personal favorites, when i can get it."

Aroma's of grapefruit pith, lemon zest, pine and resin with a faint bready caramel to provide a hint of balance. The flavor is sweet with light bread and caramel with a pleasant hop flavor and bite. Citrus and pine mingle in a crescendo of flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. I've had this many times before and I can't believe I hadn't reviewed it yet. Great beer, and I'd drink it all the time if Stone could get it to my store before its close to or expired."

"O - this after having some New Belgium Snow Day. I like to 'taste' after having something with a big contrast since i puts a focal point on those differences kn my palate. The citrus was very bright in the transition and the Bitter wasnt overwhelming. Great crisp full beer. Still learning to appreciate IPA's buti love this"

"Overall: stone is a west coast and craft classic. I feel as though the main purpose of these early ipas was to simply use the grain bill as a medium for the hops. I think if stone revisited this they would seek a certain type of balance. It's just that the battering hops dominate more than anything else. Still a good beer but not compared to others west or east coast."

"Overall: This beer is everything that an IPA should be. Such a deep complex taste, simply wonderful. This beer was the first craft beer that really opened my eyes to truly great beer. I feel like Stone can almost get taken for granted being so widely available but they really bring it with all their brews, especially the IPA's."

"O - 4.5 - This is a crisp, clean IPA that is more quaffable than it's ABV would suggest.  The hops are the primary characteristic, but they are clean and herbal/spicy, making it more balanced and less overtly ""C"-hopped than many West Coast IPAs.  Very enjoyable."

"O: Excellent, easy drinking IPA. I loved Stone Enjoy By 12.21.12 and this is right there except for the freshness turnaround."
"Good stuff!"
""
""
"This is a top tier IPA along with 90 minute and Racer 5 to name a couple. A perfectly crafted IPA that doesn't try too hard nor does it cut corners. What I love about this IPA is that it is incredibly accessible and relatively well priced, all things considering. In any case, worth every penny."
"I love Stone brewing, don't get me wrong but they could have done much better with this one. It lacks on almost all fronts. Stone is known for being cutting-edge and over the top. This one is a safe bet. It's not a bad beer, but it just lacks that Stone-esque edge that we know and love. The taste is good, not great. Bitterness is there, nothing else really. Nose is decent, earthy, piney and floral with mild citrus. I wish they would have tried harder with their year-round IPA. Middle of the road, at best."

""

""
""
""

"Pours a nice cloudy golden with small head. Smell is pine and lemon citrus zest. Taste follows with piney hops and strong fresh lemon presence that lingers on the palate a bit. Crisp IPA with slick medium mouthfeel. Medium to high carbonation. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was finally able to sit down with this one for a review. Quite a tasty West Coast type IPA; I was pleasantly surprised with the tropical fruit aromas and flavors, but this batch, at least, tends to stay on the bitter side. Definitely something to keep around the house."
""
"O: a great IPA that is readily available, excellent example of the style"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: In my opinion, this is one mighty fine tasting IPA. Though my favorite IPA is still Dogfish Head 60 minute, this definitely comes in a close second. Another fine beer from Stone Brewing Co."
"O: This is a pretty incredible IPA. I can't believe it took me so long to try this beer. Call it East Coast bias, I suppose with staple like 60 and 90min. But I will drink this beer again, and recommend it to many a new beer drinker."
""
""
"I would definitely order this again, and was a perfect pair for my Spicey Asian Tuna Berger."

"O - Overall, I'm pretty sure that this was an old bottle. No flavors really jump at me. I've wanted this one for a long time and it's kind of a disappointment."

""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent IPA, likely to be the best option in many pubs for that style. I put it in my top 10 for this category."
""
""
"The Verdict: Meh. I love IPAs and I love hop bombs, but this is just too much of a bitter bomb for me. I picked it up hoping to change my mind about Stone and finally see what everyone loves about them, but thus far I’m still disappointed."
""
"Medium-bodied, with above-average carbonation. Initially sweet, and then very dry-bitter finish, not well balanced."
""
"I like this, but for some reason it's feeling like less than the sum of its parts. Each element works, but they don't add to each other. I think I might like this much better on another day. As it is, I like it plenty well enough!"
"O- As a young guy from the Midwest I was surprised at how enjoyable this IPA was for me. Definitely different from what we get around here. But different isn't necessarily bad. Really enjoyed this and can't wait to try more from Stone to see what they offer."
""
"overall just a great IPA. easy drinking, you can't go wrong."

"After trying a bunch of stones I figured I should step back and try the IPA. This pours light orange/yellow with a white head. The smell is a lot of citrus and pine, slightly yeasty. This tastes great, it starts and finishes with a consistently great hoppy dryness. The favors are typical; hoppy, piney, citrus, lemony, and the lack of malt makes this a crisp masterpiece. This isn't the best IPA ever made but I can see why this is a staple for stone, glad I finally grabbed one, I waited too long."

"Pours a golden, opaque, honey color with a large fluffy white head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smells very strongly of hops, there are definite pine and earth notes along with a slight citrus. Taste is slightly malty sweet at first, but quickly fades to a strong hop bitterness. There are pine and resin characteristics. There is a nice long lingering bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly oily. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. This beer is very drinkable, although I discovered it is maybe too drinkable. This is turning out to be one of my favorite IPA's. It is very enjoyable and I recommend giving it a try."

"Stone IPA pours out of the bottle an orange tinged amber, cloudy, but still appealing to the eyes. The head is small, has no staying power, but surprisingly laces all the way down the glass. The mouthfeel was very strong and overpowering on the carbonation - possibly the highest carbonation I've tried to date - it just detracted from the taste. The taste itself was IPA all the way - something I've come to terms with that I'm just not a fan of. Overall, it's a good beer, but not much better or worse than the other IPA I've tried."

"Overall: On the bottle Stone brags about making then IPA ""deliciously hoppy."" I would say the emphasis would be on the hoppy and they succeeded with this beer."
""
""
"EDIT: For some reason, I decided to drink my last bottle of Stone IPA straight from the bottle, which is something I practically never do. I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy this beer considerably more than in a glass. So I am taking the rare step (possibly my first) of adjusting my rating. Taste and overall bumped my 1/2 point."
"O-Excellent American IPA. Reminiscent of Bell's Two hearted. Would enjoy comparing these side by side. Slightly different hop profile but very similar tasting grain bills."
""
""
""
""
"I thought I had drank beer, but then I had a Stone IPA. Now it is the staple beer in my refrigerator. The beer has the perfect amount of hop bitterness that I was missing in regular beers. When you open the bottle the pine smell and aroma makes you know your drinking something special. Definitely my favorite beer."

"Served into tulip glass from bottle. Pours a hazy light orange with about a-finger of tan head which dissipates within a couple of minutes. Smell is of citrus,particularly orange, as well as hops. Mouthfeel is pleasant, moderately carbonated,heavy citrus, moderate hop bitterness which seems to last till the next sip. Overall very good IPA, would be fantastic on a toasty summer day."

"Overall a mighty fine offering from Stone, a usual for sure."

"O: This beer is so good after a long day. It delivers on bitter and juicy citrus and pine hop flavors. I was glad to find this one on tap because I've had older bottles before that did not deliver anywhere close to the hop pungency this beer was designed to impart on its drinkers."

""

"O: I was glad to see this on tap at a restraints while visiting South Carolina a for my relocation. First Stone beer and I can say it was freaking great. Everything I look for in an IPA. Fresh and hopped up. I look forward to living in this state. Cheers!"

"Overall- Really good IPA. I mock Stone for their weird collaborations and experimental brews, like Dogfish, but their flagship beers, and especially this one, exemplify the styles and have revolutionized the craft beer movement."
""
""
"Taste/feel: At first sip, I got a hugely bitter taste, but the more I drank it, the more balanced and complete it seemed to get. Definitely huge on the hops (spicy, earthy, even fruity) which is always key for an IPA, and the malt cuts through the bitterness quite well. I do like this beer, but at the same time, I'm somewhat disappointed. The reviews on this site has it ranked among the best in the world, but it's just lacking something. I'm not sure what that something is, but beers like Racer 5 and Two Hearted have it ... this one doesn't. It's still a very good IPA that I'd no doubt have again, but I definitely feel that it's a touch overrated."
""
""
""
""
""
"A great, flavorful IPA that is packed with flavor like a double but still very dinkable. Pours out hazy, thick amber, golden with a touch of orange. Head rolls up and recedes into a thick ring. Stays with you the whole way through. The smell is a strong, but balanced aroma with a very strong hop foundation and a sweet, malty backbone. The Flavor is that of a very strong, floral hop, with a nice crisp citrus finish. Beneath it all a very sweet, but balancing malt character rounds it out nicely. Refreshing carbonation, but with a respectable heft on the mouth. Active but short-lived combination. All around great IPA that's easy to enjoy at any time, and more proof that Stone just makes thoroughly flavorful beers."
""
"(This is the exact same review I gave Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA. They are a lot alike.)"

"Having overlooked this one for too long, I snagged a few pint bottles tonight. Poured slowly into a snifter, a beautiful soft, chunky head grew and settled into a lacey bead that lingered to the bottom of the glass. The color is tarnished gold. An initial fragrance of distant pine blooms into citrus and fades to spearmint. A clean, refreshing hoppy taste that is bitter enough to get your attention without that 'punch-you-in-the-Adams Apple' bite remained fresh. This IPA is one to spend an evening with preferably watching a sunset over the Blue Ridge mountains or the ocean at Cape Hatteras. I have had an epiphany...this is one not to be neglected."

"Stone IPA is not to be missed. I found it to be like unto cubist art, in which a single, clear perspective is abandoned in order that the object be viewed from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. There is too much happening on the palate to appreciate all of the flavors of this beer at once. Your perspective must be flexible, mobile, and willing to focus on particular aspects of the experience, perhaps at the expense of comprehending the beer's flavor in its entirety. Expect to be overwhelmed, challenged, enthralled and enchanted. Cheers!"

""
"Overall very nice as expected. Easy drinking, balanced and tasty. Exactly what I want from an IPA."
""
""
""
""

"Taste is primarly juicy orange and grapefruit pith and resinous pine, not as much of the tropical fruits here. Slightly herbal. Bitterness is moderate, but not overpowering. Medium body that's brightly carbonated. Bitterness is respectful and doesn't blow out the palate, maintains plenty of hop flavor, with moderate bitterness is refreshing and juicy. Very, very good IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is one of my staple beers. It's cheap and holds over my hop fix between the couple double ipas I get each week. Something I do and will continue to buy often, this is my bench mark for west coast ipas"
""
""
""
"O-A really well-done IPA. The smell was the highlight for me, but the taste wasn't bad, either. I like Ruination, but this is much more drinkable and would pair better with food."
"yeah totally worth the hype. one of the most refreshing and delicious sessionable strong ipa's out there. this pours clear and bubbly, champaigne looking. it smells like intense oily hops, lots of citrus in this one. the flavor confirms, total grapefruit profile. its got the same juicy acidic tart but sweet addicting essence you get from a fresh florida pink grapefruit. its uncanny how similar this tastes to that fruit. it gets real bitter in the end, and serves a thirst quenching role to perfection. this has a great feel too, light enough in body to drink a bunch of them, but a well hidden and dangerous alcohol strength. carbonation is bright, and it makes the beer feel lighter than it is. overall a nearly perfect india pale ale, one of the best stone beers out there."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing short of great, Stone delivers a fine IPA which, strength-speaking, really isn't too far off their double - Ruination. While still being decidedly less strong overall, this IPA is huge on hops. They dominate the nose and palate, leaving a sticky hop residue in the back of your mouth. Hopheads rejoice! Personally, I'd take Ruination over this one, but to get a 6 pack of this one is about 5 dollars cheaper, and I couldn't fault anyone for grabbing one. It is a great beer."

"What more can I say about this particular India Pale Ale other than it's amongst my favorites.... This is one of the hoppier I.P.A. brews I've ever had.... I can honestly say that I love everything that comes out of this San Diego based brewery.... Stone I.P.A. has such a perfectly balanced hoppy taste along with a perfectly hoppy nose to match it.... With my increased pallete for beer over the years (generally, only giving beers of a 7.5 ABV or higher a chance), this is one I can always go back to because of its increasing availability.... Love it !!"
""
"O: The hops really take the show. A solid IPA which is widely circulated throughout California. A great introduction for anyone interested in the California microbrew scene."

"O - one of the best west coast style ipa's you can get and it's fairly easy to get ahold of. Do the guys at Stone make a bad brew? I know I've never had one(I've had about all of them) so im guessing no. This is one of the west coast legends and I finally decided to give it the credit and respect it's due. The Stone IPA is a must try for those of us who love hops and want a damn good American IPA. I know it's one that's hard for me personally to pass up and the guys at Stone don't make it easy on me since this is a year round offering. It's just one of those all time great IPAs."
""
"O: One of the standards for IPAs. I've rarely come across any that are consistently better. It's almost always on point and when it's not I've found that it's due to freshness. Being in South Georgia we have to pay attention to labels - stores here are not quite up to snuff on craft beer. We're working on it though."
""
""

""

"Review from 10/2010 notes. Poured into a tumbler. Pours a medium orange amber with a one finger medium white head and lacing. Strong citrus, floral hops and light malt aroma. Flavor follows; neutral malt balancing citrus and herbal hops. Nice hoppy finish. Medium body. A nice aromatic hoppy IPA as one would expect from Stone."

"O- For an American IPA clocking in at 6.9% ABV and ~$10 a 6-Pack, I don't think you can find a better beer for the money...the exception being Union Jack from Firestone Walker. This is great stuff and should be a staple in every hop-lovers 'fridge...but be sure and get it fresh!"

"I'm not a big IPA guy, but this is the epitome of the style. Great pour, retention, and lacing. Huge pine-scented nose. Light malt for the base, that balances the moderate hop bill well. Hops do not overpower, but provide a solid kick. Great weight for sessioning. Could throw a few back and feel great, while still getting the great flavors."
"Medium body, very strong tasting for a single IPA. However, it is very smooth once your palate gets used to the hops they use in the beer itself. For first timers, this is one that I highly recommend trying, and its priced just right. You can pretty much find this anywhere (depending on where you are located). Always recommend trying it in the 22oz bottles before buying 6 packs."
"O- a reference standard for the West Coast IPA. I could enjoy it anytime, anywhere, and it really hits home when I want a very bitter IPA (but don't feel like blowing my head off with Green Flash W.C. IPA)"

"Overall - The King of West Coast IPAs. The hops are perfectly chosen to create a beautiful hop flavor profile that focuses on citrus and tropical fruits, but the malt makes a good showing as well. Perfectly drinkable and never disappoints. Highly recommended"

"O-my new favorite IPA"
"O: The best most balanced IPA out there. I prefer this to DIPAs so I can have more than one. It's also available everywhere in SF at a good price which is a very good thing."

"O-A really good IPA, I need to try and I find an extremely fresh bottle and give it another whirl."

"O: A great sipping beer that grabs you and doesn't let go. It demands your attention and rewards you for it. Subtlety behind intense flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"However, the action occurs on the palate; there is an initial citrus explosion, containing various shards of lime and orange, which fades in a quick, but intense, bitterness provided by the generous dry hopping. Pleasant well-balanced mouthfeel brings to close a satisfying quaff and an important reminder of how great craft brew should taste. Still, you gotta love them gargoyles."

"cruising around the hotel in vegas and saw this on tap so I braved a pint. classic semi transparent color with a finger plus of filthy white foamy head. visible bubbling could be seen and nice lacing on the plastic pint glass. smells of dank west coast hops. taste is also a hoppy bouquet of happiness and the finish is soft bitter. really solid aren't ipa. tastes pretty fresh. nice treat in a hotel where everything seems to be BMC."

"O - easily drinkable IPA, not over-hopped, excellent mouthfeel, light, crisp, refreshing"

"Slick and drinkable. I like it."

" I'm a huge proponent of putting APA's and IPA's in the freezer for about 15 minutes before drinking them. There is just a crispness with these type of beers that is accentuated by drinking them very very cold. However, by the end of the beer, when it warms up a bit you really know what you have. Lesser quality APA's and IPA's tend to lose that crispness as well as show their alcohol content once the beer warms. So if it still tastes good and not so boozy when it warms you have yourself a real winner. And that's what you have with Stone IPA. Super delicious when ice cold..still pretty darn good when piss warm...can't say that about many beers. If you haven't tried it and enjoy hoppy beers, get on it my good people, you'll be glad you did. Good thing about this one is that you can find it at almost any liquor store. Which, in my book certainly adds a notch or two to the rating."

"This is a very balanced IPA. The hops do not overwhelm, but rather, they are firm in their presence. The hop-attributed tastes are lemon rind, citrus and pine. There's some nice bitterness, but not overwhelming. Very quaffable IPA."

""

"Poured a bomber into a pint glass. The appearance is your typical IPA. Somewhat opaque. The smell is grapefruit hoppy with a hint of malt. The taste is simliar to the nose in that it's a grapefruitty with a hin of malt taste. Love the mouthfeel, medium to thick. Overall it's a really good beer. It's good in the bottle but I've enjoyed it more on tap. Not as dry."

"Best IPA that I have ever had and one of the best beer I have ever had PERIOD! One of the few beer that made me say ""Oh MY"" when I had the pleasure of trying it. As good as this is out of the bottle, I had the joy of trying this fresh when I visited Stone while out in San Diego in the Summer of 2011 and its even better!!! A real treat! Worth the little extra $$$$ IMO!!!"

"Overall: Stone takes the malty English IPA style and marries it with some in-your-face American hops(Cascade, Chinook and Columbus). I wish the hops were a bit more bright and aggressive, but the hops that really showcase those ripe, juicy characteristics that most 21st century hop heads crave weren't bred during time that Stone came up with this very balanced and dry IPA recipe. I haven't drank this IPA in quite some years, but I am certainly happy I revisited it."
""
""
""
""
"O - Stone is a great brewery and that reputation is made through their perennial beers like this one. An IPA very true to the style. Will definitely be a go to beer for me from now on. Still prefer the IIPA but this is a fantastic IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: A good brew, but more of a pale ale than an IPA. It is nicely balanced but does not stand out from the crowd."

"great ipa, if too strong in the mid-palate for session drinking."
""
""
""
""
"This is one of my standards by which I judge other IPA's"
"O – A stellar IPA. Don’t let the mild looks and aroma fool you; this one is a taste titan. And here this is only Stone’s “normal” IPA. Proof that an IPA doesnt have to be “Black”, “Double” or “Imperial” to be an outstanding beer."
""

""

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours hazy golden with an abundant, fluffy white head that retains well. As the beer was consumed, there was still plenty of head left on top as well as abundant lacing down the glass. The aroma is of sweet malts as well as plenty of pine and citrus from the hops. It's a very bright and inviting smell. The flavor is fantastic. The big malty sweetness is balanced by big hop flavors. The citrus flavors accompany the sweetness into the mouth while the piney bitterness hits the back end. It's incredibly well balanced. The body of this beer is medium to full and the carbonation is adequate. The beer coats the mouth really well. Overall, this is an incredible beer. This should be the gold standard for this style. Stone hit a home run with this beer."

"O- This was one my first IPA's after having PtE about 6 months ago and I remember thinking it was pretty good. Ever since then I've had trouble finding fresh ipa's from Stone. I have to remember too that this is not a DIPA and it has a amazing bold flavor for a regular IPA."

"O - A great IPA, it shouldn't be a surprise that this is the type of beer that Stone is known for. If you want an aggressive IPA, drink this now!"

"Pours a light copper color with a thick and foamy white head that quickly dissapated to a ring around the beer and nice lacing down the glass. Aroma is of floral, fruit and spice. Taste has a slight sweetness, followed by lots of hops. However seemed to be well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium."

"overall - nice hop flavors, but in my opinion needs some more malt body."
""

""
""
""
""
""

"O: I'm so excited to finally review this beer! This was seriously my very first go to beer. An expensive one, but I drank this week after week before I knew anything about beer. I just knew I liked this. Even now that I'm more beer geeky it still holds up fantastically. Worth every penny."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Stone's IPA is world renowned and highly rated for good reasons. It's classic in it's delivery and taste and it's easy to see why many a beer lover has fallen in love with IPA...a classic in every sense of the word."
"Yet another IPA like many others but definitely one worth trying. Good depth and perfect balance."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the IPA that set the standard for me. This is the beer that all other IPAs are compared to. A terrific smooth tasting IPA. So much flavor here. An A+ beer; one of my favorites."
""
"The west coast IPA that started it all. Slightly hazy golden orange with great lacing. Huge herbal hops, light in body, and sahara dry. Malts? Well yes technically there are some in there but you'd never know it by tasting it. Light, in the IPA world, and well carbonated. This is a must for IPA lovers. The benchmark for all IPAs."
"Overall this is a pretty classic example of a SoCal-style IPA. Definitely hoppy and bitter while still drinkable and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good, classical example of the hoppy American IPA. Strongly flavorful and delicious."
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Orange yellow color with a small white head that laces well. Aroma is of piney high alpha acid hops; floral and spicy with a definitely malt back bone. Flavor is upfront spicy and hoppy (grapefruit and spruce) and caramel sweet. Moderate ester profile to complement the hops and malt. Finishes dry and crisp."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall, this beer was just OK for me. Not sure why, as an IPA, this gets such a strong rating... If it was just a Pale Ale, I could see it though. Not a bad beer though. I did enjoy it, just have had much better in the IPA class."
""
""
"O - Overall this is one of my favorites from Stone. A balanced, perhaps a tad hoppy IPA that is widely available for around $10 a 6-er. For the price, I don't think you can get much better per brew while staying moderate with all the beer's characteristics. Cheers!"
"O: Classic IPA, always dependable when its fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the beer is a solid IPA. It is smoother than most IPA's but has all of the excellent aroma and flavor qualities of a classic IPA. Try it, it is worth it!"
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink and very refreshing on this unseasonably warm evening in early March in NYC. Definitely a session drinker and one that I enjoy - and plan on having again in the future. Great flavor and a lovely aroma."

""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall- Giving this the benefit of the doubt, I've held on to this bottle for a few months when I should have probably enjoyed it sooner."
""
"While I found this a good and decent entry as an IPA, I can't say I found the balance between the hops and resulting dryness to the malt that pleasing. While I am looking for the former in an IPA, I am also seeking a bit more body, as well as greater refreshment in the flavor, feel, and aftertaste, which the use of hops here slightly intrudes on. Additionally, as suggested, found the body and flavor a bit thin. Good, but believe there are better IPA's out there."
""
""
""
"Overall, a good IPA but not up to its reputation in my opinion. The hops are nice and it is a good beer, but I would like more of a malt presence to accompany the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - There's nothing complex about this IPA, but it's clean and it catches the taste buds just right. I'm a big grapefruit guy, so the flavors in this beer are right up my alley. One of my favorite IPA's; I like it better than their (Stone) Ruination."
""

"O: this is a mostly easy drinking IPA. I'm impressed how well balanced everything is in this beer. I would have this again."

"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 2/28/2012. Pours slightly cloudy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger off white head with fantastic retention that reduces to a thick cap that lingers. Some nice lacing down the sides of the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, pine, herbal, floral, honey, and a bit of biscuit. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, pine, herbal spiciness, floral, caramel, honey, and biscuit. Good amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, pine, herbal, floral, and honey notes on the finish for a while. Very hoppy, but still has a nice malt balance to even things out. Medium carbonation and body; with a slightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel. Very drinkable, with hardly any alcohol warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible IPA. Very hoppy, yet still has great balance; and is very drinkable at 6.9%."

"Pours a cloudy orangish copper with a slight white head. Nice aroma and flavor citrus, some piney resin, and a touch of bready malt. Some bitterness throughout but balanced with the rest of the flavor. A crisp mouthfeel. Good drinkability to this and while I am not much of an IPA fan I did enjoy this one."
"Overall: Easy drinking IPA and then some. Lots of flavor, but easily drinkable in quantity without experiencing fatigue. Solid with a hop profile that manages to hit citrus without Cascade."
""
""
"Yes, everybody else is quite appropriate to laud this beer. It's a fine IPA."
"Initial strong aroma of hops. Poured with a golden color, and a frothy head that was still a half inch thick a few minutes after pouring. Very well-balanced flavor with a mellow hop bitterness and a good amount of hop flavor that melded very well with the malt backbone. Rich mouthfeel that felt almost creamy from the fine carbonation. The beer coated the mouth for several seconds after each sip. This evolved into a pleasantly ligering aftertaste that was a good mix of bitterness and hop flavor."

"Picked up a sixer at a local liquor store for about 12 dollars. For that price I expected something really spectacular and the 95 overall ranking made me think ""oh boy, this is going to be great!"". If I'm honest, it just isn't. It's TOO bitter. It tastes like what I imagine grapefruit peels to taste like. If you puréed them with some pine needles. Hopslam is way better for my palate any day of the week. Ugh."

"O - This west coast IPA really shines in my opinion. As my palate matures I'm sure I will find myself reaching for stronger doubles and imperial IPAs but for the moment this seems to be my comfort level."
"Overall (4.25/5): Still a wonderful beer. I do at times when drinking this beer wish for more body and more malt. Other beers, like Green Flash West Coast IPA, have a more prominent malt bill, which I favor. That being said, Stone IPA is a true trailblazer. It remains one excellent IPA, particularly when enjoyed with a month or less of age on it."
"O - This is the first Stone IPA I've had in awhile, and it still doesn't disappoint. There's actually more bitterness in this beer than I remembered from before, but that's certainly not a bad thing for me. The hop flavors are delicious, with a good showing of the floral and pine varieties, which make this a very uplifting and drinkable beer. This brew has always been one of my favorites, and will continue to be one I come back to."
""
"Mouthfeel is crisp with some oily slickness from the hop oils. The body is slightly thin. Somewhat lacks the pucker factor I was looking for. Overall, this one is still good, despite a little age on it, but I will have to seek out another one that is fresher and adjust my review accordingly if warranted. Compared with other American IPAs, it definitely holds its own."

When I started getting into IPAs and hoppy beers, I always proclaimed Stone IPA to be favorite of the style and most appealing to me. This may still hold true after all these years... I mean, it definitely sits in my Top 5 of the style."

"Overall / Drinkability: A very good AIPA and quite drinkable. I had two of these in short order with a grilled salmon and crab cake dinner. I could even argue dangerously drinkable as after two I wouldn't mind a third but I know better. A very fine AIPA. I can see why it is rated as high as it is, and I think on tap it's even better than it is in the bottle from when I previously reviewed it."

"O- This is a nice beer, refreshing, tasty, easy to drink for 6.9%. I would have liked a bit more on the aroma and mouthfeel. I should note this is from a bottle from craft beer exchange, possibly this is a bit older than it should be, not bottle dated."

"Stone IPA pours a golden straw colour, almost perfectly clear with a healthy head and very respectable lacing. The smell is completely dominated by the hops, but its so much more than that. Citrus and pine tones are mixed with an ever-so-slight maltiness to form the perfect bouquet. The taste is, well, incredible. The most intensely piney hops I've ever tasted in a beer (not including Ruination of course) are somehow balanced up front with the malt they've chosen. The aftertaste is almost just as intense and it's quite dry. Overall, I've already said it. A perfect example of an American IPA, and a perfect beer."

"O: Stones ipa is between a sweet ipa like alesmith and racer five and a more bold like wipe out. I think this is a damn fine beer, with a great malt backbone. With all of that said... Stones ipa doesn't shatter the earth, but that's not the point. It's an ipa and very good one at that. So yes, I defiantly recommend you pick some up."

"The beer also has a strong citrus component on reaching the tongue, but this becomes more piney mid-taste. Strikingly sweet when it hits the tongue, with no immediate hop hit following ... this does appear in the surprisingly hoppy finish. Thus, this IPA creates a striking and unusual (well, exaggerated) flavor dynamic."

"O - Overall, a fantastic beer - I actually enjoyed it much more than the Ruination IPA. I will have to try to get some of this back to Nebraska."

""
""
"A very solid west coast IPA."
""
"An excellent beer that I would recommend to any hop lover."
""
""
"The price is way too high for a sixer ($12), but this would certainly be a go-to IPA if I could always find it fresh for around $8."
""
""
"Overall, fairly hoppy, piney and citrus hops mixed with the gentle sweet malts. I like this one."
""
""
""

"O: Overpriced, overrated. Drinkable."
""

"O- A little too bitter for my liking, but still a nice ipa that is very herbal and pine forward."

""
""
"O: One of the best IPAs around, can't really go wrong with this. Excellent abstraction of hop flavors."
""
""
"Overall: A good IPA that I would no doubt have again; it's refreshing and an easy, delicious drinker."
""
""
""

"O - This beer gets better and better with each sip. Great hop forward IPA with solid bitterness and crisp hops without a strong malt backbone. Great year round offering from Stone."

"This is an awesome IPA! One of the top quality ones, and a true inspiration for those attempting to brew premium IPAs. It, just like all of Stone's beers, is an acquired taste, but it's a classic hop recipe by the brewery. Simply excellent!"
"The beer is definitely different for an ipa. It actually showcases the huge flavors one would normally find in a double ipa which is impressive but not exactly what im looking for when I want an ipa. Not bad though at all"
""
""
""
"O- One of my favorites. Hop forward and delightful."

"Stone IPA has a nice hoppy taste that I've come to enjoy in beer. It has a nice amber apperance. It also leaves a nice spider web of foam on the glass that a good beer should. Definatly recommened if you are looking for a good IPA. Its another good beer from The Stone Brewing Company."

"on assault on the palate to be sure. definitely overpowers everything. even the hop flavor is eclipsed by the fierce bitterness (kind of to a fault)."

"O: Surprising presence of hops after a full year in the bottle. I'll look forward to tasting a fresher example of this hop-forward West Coast I.P.A. More difficult to obtain since Stone dropped distribution in WI last May. Complex and delicious."

"As others have written, it is a very well-hopped IPA with a nice citrus aroma and taste. I actually did not find it all that bitter, but my taste buds are used to drinking beers in this genre. In any case, I found the hops to be sufficiently balanced to take the most bitter edge off of the hops. It still tilts generously towards the hops, but it has a very pleasing taste."
""
""
"O - This is a great effort from Stone. This is right up there with DFH in terms of my favorite IPAs - big hoppy flavors, tons of citrus, and a nice refreshing malt-y finish with a good carbonation balance. Excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very solid standard IPA. I tend to not prefer pale ales and IPAs that have that biscuit like flavor going on, but the rest of the profile is excellent - as usual for Stone."

"The only negative thing I'll say about this beer is how single minded it is. ""Let's see how hoppy we can make an IPA"". Not sure if this is exactly what the people at Stone Brewery had in mind, but I have a feeling they wouldn't mind me saying that. Thank you Stone, for brewing interesting beers."
""
""
"O - I thought I had reviewed this by now, surprised that I haven't. I usually pick up a 6 pack whenever I'm in the US and see some that is only a few weeks old. It's nice that a solid IPA like this is affordable and usually fresh in stock in Michigan. Just a nice and solid IPA, especially for a beer of its availability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Great beer, and so damn easy to get. I frequently pass this one up for other IPAs I have not tried yet, but here in Montana, this one is hard to beat. Stone, what would I do without you?"

"O- A fantastic american IPA that just seems to do it all right. Its a benchmark of what this style of beer should be, I said that about Southern Tier's IPA and i think this one is actually a little better."

"Stone Brewery in Southern California has been producing excellent beers for more than a decade and have a wide array of offerings. This IPA, though not their best IPA (in my opinion), is one with fine character. The golden color of the beer is contrasted with a off white head which laces the beer glass while drinking. The aroma, though not as pronounced as other IPAs (thinks Avery's) is nonetheless hearty with agreeable hop notes. It has a hops, earthy, and some light citrus flavor which remains on the palette even after drinking. Sure, there are many IPAs on the market, but this one is well above average, very drinkable, and remarkably consistent every time I have had it. And another benefit is that one can find the beer all over the US owing to the size of Stone Brewery (among the top 25 largest breweries in the US)."

"Overall (4.0): This is a very solid, very classic American IPA. What I like about it is how straightforward and clear the bitterness is, showing more bite than a lot of the new, all-chewy-juicy-hops (D)IPAs—this kind of beer defines the American IPA, in a lot of ways, and it’s very good beer."

"Nice golden body, strong bitter smell, strong bitter taste"
"Aftertaste: The aftertaste is not what you expect from a beer with this much flavor. It’s there, and it lasts for a while but it’s nothing to write home about. It’s clean, crisp, and the subtle bitterness toward the end lingers for a while. It’s not one of those aftertastes that makes me want to stop and smell the roses, if you know what I mean. Regardless, this is a great beer, one that is easy to find, and is not very expensive. I will order this time and time again. Bottoms up people!"
"Classic West Coast IPA and a must-try beer for any hophead."
"Just reviewed this one on tap, but I figured I'd review a fresh bottle. Pours a clear gold with a two finger head that sticks around. It is a little darker than a standard macro. Smells is wonderful. I get pineapple, grapefruit, and papaya. Smells juicy. Taste is a hop onslaught. Mostly citrus coming through with noticeable pine. Overall, I think I might actually prefer this bottled. Perfect representation of a west coast IPA. The only thing keeping this from being an A+ is the lack of any noticeable malt flavor. I know west coast IPAs tend to be all hops, but I prefer a little sweetness in my IPAs."
"O: Very impressive IPA. More like an Imperial IPA meal in a glass, but who am I to complain."
"Definitely one of the better IPAs. It is nicely balanced and is unfiltered."
"Had this tonight over an awesome burger at Red Robin. Pours a beatifully inviting, frothy glassful of welcome. Nose is dominated by bitter citrus flesh, red grapefruit rind, citrusy hops. Taste follows the nose perfectly. Perfect carbonation. Goes down way too easy. Could drink all night."
"O - I like Stone's IPA for its hoppy, pine character. It's much more true to my vision of an IPA than others I have tried. That being said though, I think I still prefer Bell's Two Hearted Ale to the Stone IPA in terms of flavor. Nevertheless, this is an excellent IPA that people should definitely give a chance. 4.5"
"Drinkability: It lacks complexity, but it packs a hoppy punch and offers major grapefruit flavor. It is now the definitive IPA in my book."
"O: Very good IPA. Among the best IPAs out there."
"The quintessential American IPA. Poured with a nice, large, off white, foamy, frothy, head that lasts a long time and lots of lace. Color is a clear amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is hop, malt, citrus, pine, fresh baked bread, grass. Flavor is huge hop/malt bittersweet thing with perfect carbonic tang. Body and carbonation are perfect. Finish has just the right length and is like flavor. This is beer baby."
"O-excellent, i love this brew. i recommend it, its totally worth it"
"O- i really enjoyed this beer. it is a really nice IPA and the ingredients in it are blended very well. very smooth. i would compare the flavor and mouthfeel to a Deschutes Mirror Pond but without the slight bitterness or tang that the mirror pond had."
"This America IPA is hop head's dream! Classic west coast IPA not for the faint of heart. In your face hops and easy to drink!"
"Go out and grab one of these. Their around 6 bucks, and a 22 oz with 6.9% alcohol by volume will take the edge off your day for sure. And if you don't like IPA I don't know why you are even reading this review."
"Overall this is a good IPA but not my favorite. A bit too much on the bitter side with a lacking hop flavor. Kind of forgettable and a bit of a palate wrecker because of the lack of a malt presence to balance the abundant West Coast C-hops."
"People need to understand that you don't need an overly hopped out beer in order to make it a good IPA. Reminds me of the wine industry and highly alcoholic wine with pruny, raisin flavors that so called wine drinkers started flocking to in the late 2000’s. This is an excellent IPA, well structure and just as advertised. Those looking for something overly hopped out in order to “get” this beer don’t understand the elegance that goes into beer making and IPAs."
"O: New go-to IPA. Nice job Stone."
"D - I don't really understand this beer. There's not much here. It's watery and there's hardly any mouthfeel at all. Don't think I'd get this again. Not impressed."
"O: Meh. If you enjoy really bitter IPAs, you'll be a fan. I enjoy bitter hop tastes, but the thinness of the beer and overall light flavor is disappointed. I wanted a lot more from Stone and the beer did not deliver."
"Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a pint glass. The beer is hazy-golden in color, with a slim 1-finger head. This is a very aromatic beer with lots of floral and citrus notes; I also detect a little honey at the tail end. At first taste, the grapefruit and citrus flavors are very evident, as well as a noticeable hop-bitterness that is strong but not overpowering. The body of this beer is exceptional, for it accomplishes being creamy yet highly-drinkable. The carbonation is a little much, but the taste outweighs this minute flaw. In comparison to other trademark IPA's. this brew holds its own with ease."
"overall: I loved the smell, and was very surprised by the taste, I'm not usually a huge fan of super hoppy bitter beers but this one wasn't half bad. Overall I really liked this beer, great combination of flavors."
"A very large head and a copious amount of lace. Opaque golden amber color. Smell is bright and citrusy with lots of caramel sweetness and tropical fruits. A touch of pine and yeasty doughy sweet rolls. Taste super. Sizable malt front is quickly enveloped by lots of grapefruit. A nice amount of caramel and multigrain dinner rolls for a backbone. Hops are full of oily citrus notes. A bit of mint as well. Finish is very dry and long with hop oil dripping from every part of my mouth. Feel is crisp and mildly effervescent with a medium light weight. A top flight beer that just does it better than most. Wow."
"A pretty good beer overall. I’d definitely give it another go."
"This is a model IPA that should be followed, if not replicated, by other breweries. Many say that Stone is too bitter or hop crazy, but when you compare this IPA to others (such as Lagunitas or DFH), you notice this is much more delicate than its competitors. There are floral and fruity undertones to this beer that you just don't get with others. Now it must be admitted that I'm a bit partial, since Stone introduced me to the wonderfulness known as hops, but I think there is a reason I listened when they spoke. Stone knows what they're doing here, and anyone with taste buds will sit a little straighter and take note. Cheers!"
"This is an excellent AIPA, as most seem to agree upon. I would appreciate a deeper aroma, but the core of this beer is entirely strong; I wouldn't change a thing if it meant altering some other aspect of it."
"Overall; This is a perfect beer for me. Strong and hoppy, but balanced and not overwhelming. Complex but crisp. I really think if God was going to have a beer this might be it."
"Tasting the Stone IPA as my first beer on this glorious Saturday evening. The beer is quite good. The color is a hazy orangish with white foamy head that is lacing. The smell includes fresh pine and bitter citrus fruit. The taste is quite good. It starts with a nice citrus and pine push then a malt takes over then a bitterness, then the pallat clears with more malt. It is quite an interesting beer. The mouthfeel is very good and I probably could have a couple before running out of steam; higher ABV makes it tough. Overall a very good beer."
"Overall this is a really solid representation of an AIPA and an overall tasty beer. Recommended for any fan of IPAs, plus it is widely available. Cheers!"
"This is a completely different, and frankly better, beer on cask. So much complexity, that its almost not like an ipa."
"O - Excellent IPA so definitely try it if you can. I highly recommend it."
"D - Definitely one of the better IPA's I've had. Well built and drinkable (especially considering I'm not a huge fan of the style). Not great, but I'd have it again."
"O- Love it. Definitely has a lot of components I look for in a beer."
"However, if you are a ""hop-head"" and really want to see what Stone is about, I would recommend the Ruination IPA. Otherwise, this is one of many good IPA's available in this country, and though it is well-brewed, it is not special to set it apart from any of the other good ones."
"Pours a honey color with a thick, white head that turns into a great lacing that coats the sides of the glass. Carbonation bubbles race from the bottom of the glass to the top keeping the head afloat. Smells of grass, citrus, and sweet malts. Taste is well balanced between the bitterness from the hops and heavy malt profile. Taste strong bitterness from the hops, sweet malts, and a citrus tropical profile. Easy drinker and crisp finish. This growler will be easy to finish before evening hits (2pm as I review). Great IPA from Stone. Makes it even better this is readily available. This is a staple beer that will always be in the fridge."
"Overall I'm a big fan of this West Coast style IPA. At $3.99 a bomber (even in Texas) it's hard to beat."
"Appearance is a beautiful amber, nice and cloudy with a good head of foam. A robust citrus smell with a bitter taste. Not too hoppy. A fine IPA, a very enjoyable experience. I will be getting more of this asap."
"O- It may be a little on the bitter side of balanced, and I could see how it might not be everyone's cup of tea. But that's OK, I love it. One of my favorite IPAs. Besides, it's almost worth it just for the cool silk screened bottle :)"
"I had this one on tap the other night. Poured a clear golden amber with a lasting amber head. Aromas of biscuit, skunk bud, orange, tropical fruit and a hint of pine. Palate was medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of biscuit, grapefruit, orange zest and light tropical fruit with a smooth dry lingering bitter grapefruit finish."
"O: great IPA. I wish I could brew IPA like this..."
"This beer would be good when I desire something extremely bitter, with a lovely hop aroma. However, this beer isn't something that I would go out and get a 6 pack of."
"Not overly bitter so it's drinkable and refreshing. The alcohol content is moderate but warms the palate. Overall balanced and solid."
"Overall a really solid IPA. Very drinkable."
"i could drink this all day, every day and would have huge stupid grin on my face !"
"This IPA is just like heaven in my opinion. Maybe it's because I love the taste of trees that this does so much for me. I could easily say that this is the best tasting IPA I've ever had, but there are still so much I need to taste."
"Golden straw (hazy) in color. It had a big fluffy white head that dissipated slowly and left lacing on the glass. Very strong aroma of grapefruit and floral hops. First, I tasted some caramel and sweet malts. When it hit the back of my mouth, the bitterness of the citrus hops kicked in a big way. Alcohol taste was not noticeable. It finishes dry with bread-like malts and resiny hop bitterness. Light to medium in body. It had medium carbonation and a nice effervescent mouth feel."
"Okay, not really ""session"" . . . that would be a very bad idea, at 6.9% and not really being a session beer in the slightest, no, I wouldn't . . . but still could drink a few without blowing out the old palate!"
"Overall it's a very standard IPA. There isn't a whole lot I can say about it to wow you into going and buying it, but I will say it's very drinkable and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a new IPA to try."
"C-"
"Overall, definitely try this if you can. A solid IPA."
"Pours a beautiful amber color with a generous white head with great retention. Lots of lacing down the glass makes for a pleasing visual experience. The smell is out-of-this-world good. Loads of citrus hops hit the nose with a wallop. The taste is all hops. Delicious grapefruit flavor with touch of pine. Plenty of bitterness makes this a hop-head's dream, and not for the faint-of-tongue. If there was ever a beer deserving of being called exceptional, this is it."
"Good brew here, this poured out as a nice looking copper color with a white thick head on top. The smell of this brew gives off a good blend of malts and hops, the hops are strong on the nose like they should be. The taste is really nice here, just a really drinkable IPA. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and has a good carbonation to it. Overall, it's a beer that you can have multiple of in a sitting if you want too."
"Pours a murky copper color with a 1 inch puffy white head that fades to an island of foam sitting on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace mark the drink down on the sides of the glass. Smell is of pungent pine and herbal hops and a slight malt aroma. Taste is of the pine and herbal hops up front with a malt backbone coming through on the finish. A medium level of bitterness sticks to the palate after each sip. This beer has a good carbonation level making for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good hop-forward IPA from Stone (what do you expect, right?). I have had this one in the bottle but I prefer this one on tap."
"Pours a clear, golden copper color with a smallish cap of off white head, some lacing and decent retention. Smells wonderfully floral with some orange rind and some grassy notes, maybe some pineapple and tropical fruit. Taste is nicely balanced floral and pine, finishing mildly bitter. Mouthfeel is very soft carbonation, mediumish, on a medium-light body. Overall, an excellent choice for an everyday IPA. Very drinkable and great flavor, packing a lot of hops."
"Smell and Taste: Apricots, Grapefruit and other citrus smells. I also catch a little bit of pine too. The taste is amazing, not too harsh for an IPA, an extremely smooth IPA. I might have found another go to IPA to go with Racer 5 and Huma."
"Another great one for the Gargoyle"
"I've had this several times and had varying experiences, the best being from a solo cup on a 100 degree day, seemed to bring out more juicy, resiny hop flavors, still a solid IPA that I'm grateful to have easy access to."
"O: Another solid beer from Stone, I'm continuously impressed by them. Worth the money to try."
"O: Exactly what was to be expected, this is the flagship American West Coast IPA and the one that all others will be judged on. That said, I prefer a bit more balance in my IPA's as well as the more grapefruit, citrus oriented hops, but I would never turn one of these down. Cheers!"
"This is the best IPA in a bottle that I have tasted so far. It is very hoppy, simply delicious. I am happy to report that now it is available at Costcos for $25.99 a case (at least in the Torrance, CA Costco.) Bought 2 cases and now I'm happy.(9-10-2011)"
"Overall: Just a damn good IPA"
"There's not a whole lot that I can add to the reviews already given for this brew. This is one of those ipas that has become a benchmark for other beers to follow. It has all the trademark highlights that craft beer drinkers look for in a great ipa. Great nose. Wonderful hoppy taste and extremely drinkable."
"O- A nice example of a West Coast IPA. A bit one dimensional but that's ok. It's bitter, piney nature makes for a crisp, clean, refreshing brew."
"O: This beer is the antithesis of a pretentious beer. The simplicity and purposeful confidence of this beer is inspiring. If you see this fresh, it's a can't miss ."
"Of course you can drink it, which is what I prefer. The beer dances on the palate. There’s a definite hop bite to it, with a clean, sharp finish. Great carbonation. A little maltiness to balance the sting. More floral than piney hops, although I get a sense they’re in there too. (Again, I need to work on my hop education.) A standard bearer, and not just limited to the west coast obviously. Yum. I really enjoy this beer."
"A very nice IPA, having finally tried this one I can see why it is considered such a staple by many."
"D/O: Very drinkable. I'm thoroughly enjoying this beer. Fresh IPA is tough to beat!"
"Overall - This is really a great IPA, especially if you like your hops expressed in strong citrus flavors. Great mouthfeel, and just enough sweetness to keep you from puckering - highly drinkable, very satisfying, highly recommend!"
"O: Haven't always been into IPA's but this one impressed. I would have it again for sure if I was after some IPA's."
"Overall great example of style with great bitter close."
"Stone You Rock"
"Overall: I can understand why this is such a highly rated IPA. It's an excellent refreshing beer that pairs well with food (I had it on the side with a steak) and on its own in during the summer months. If a friend were to ask for some recommendations for an IPA, Stone's IPA would definitely make the list."
"O - It;s good but i don't feel it's all that special. There are so many A+ IPA's out there and i just don't feel this is in their class."
"O: phenomenal, lives up to everything i had expected and really hit what i want in an IPA"
"enjoy by date: 10/11/11"
"Benchmark, for sure."
"Had a few bottles of these on Friday night at a local Middle Eastern restaurant. Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Nice vibrant orange body with a fine white head. Moderate carbonation and lacing. Smell was full of hop aroma. Very potent, just like a lot of the West Coast IPAs tend to be. Taste was also mostly hops, and that lent a nice pine-like flavor to the beer. Very crisp beer, with a bit of dryness at the end. Not an over the top IPA, so it was enjoyable to drink. Plus the high abv was not much of a factor. I thought it paired well with the spiciness of the evening's Lebanese food. Good match."
"this one is a staple in the diet when i can afford it, a nice strong pour brings a finger or two of white frothy head that lays on a body of gold clarity that is part of stone ipa. the lacing is not strong but thats ok and there is a little bit of legs to let you know it was there. the smell of citrus and grapefruit hit first small bits of pungent next and a slight sweet that follows. the taste is not let down by the smell at all, full of citrusey fruit tones and sharp hop bitterness jump out at you, it has a slight drop at the end of the sip but works with the punch you get from the first of the drink. the mouthfeel is very lively with lots of jumpy carbonation that attacks the tongue but if ate with spicey and i mean spicey food its not there at all. overall i love this beer, drinkability is outstanding and an easy everyday all day beer for me. one of my favs of stone hands down"
"Not my favorite IPA."
"He shoots, he scores! This is a wondeful IPA... Pours an orange-caramel into the glass, with a sticky, frothy head, medium retention and wonderful webbed lace. The nose has all you’d expect: grapefruit, citrus, pine, floral accents. These transfer directly into the flavor dept. There is a faint caramel malty sweetness which underlies a huge hop contingency. Grapefruit, citrus, and candy orange slices are noted in the mid-palate, whereas the side- and back-palate are peppered perfectly with a mildly-lingering pine resin dry-hop. All of the wonderful complexities of this brew come together almost flawlessly. It has a very nice, refreshingly creamy (and cleansing) finish that works wonders for the overall effect! Truly, one of the best IPA’s one can have."
"Stone IPA is an orange colored brew, medium sized white head with loads of lacing. The scent is pretty interesting and enticing. Some caramel malts, but loads of piney hop, citrusy hop, grapefruity hop. The flavor is very good too; nice sweet malt start, but the main focus is on the west coast panoply of hops. Citrus, lemon, pine, some bitter but not as much, some grapefruit. Lot's of variety in the hops, but none are overwhealming. Medium bodied."
"O: Another solid offering from Stone. I think I prefer a maltier base, like Arrogant Bastard, but certainly nothing to find fault with here. You could do worse than this for sure. At nearly 7%, I'm amazed that there's no sign alcohol burn whatsoever with this brew. Very well crafted."
"o: is for obsess. because i cant wait to go get more."
"I have to call this one light bodied. It just rushes over the tongue so fast, and the carbonation definitely makes itself known. Bitterness that is pleasant and not overpowering stays with for a while. Dry finish."
"Mouthfeel is smooth with a solid medium body feel and a lively carbonation. Overall, Stone IPA might just be the quintessential American IPA. Fruity and bitter and oh so wonderful."
"A textbook IPA, rich and hoppy. Standard, but high-quality. Glad I picked this bottle up!"
"D: the balance between the hops and the grain couldnt be much better than in this pint. as most everyone that uses this site knows, very enjoyable brew from stone."
"A solid IPA that is not overpowering but has everything that you would want."
"Overall: Very good and enjoyable. Probably the gold standard IPA as far as I can tell. It is hard to tell it is 6.9% abv as well, it's so easy drinking."
"Overall I think of this as kind of the standard for west coast style ipas. Not the best, mind you, but note for note it respresents such a good base line for that style. If I had one complaint, it is that there seems to be a little more variance from serving to serving than I would expect given the pure quantity of this beer that stone has/had brewed over the years. But even within that range, it has been between good and friggin great. Oddly enough, I have had the same issue with their neighbors down the road, green flash, and their ipa (and no, it has not been an issue of age on the beer)....but I digress.... this is a great (and easy to get)west coast ipa, and if you are a fan of the style you should seek it out. Save yourself the 5 bucks, pass over the ruination 6 pack, and pick it up."
"Excellent. Aromatic and bitter with a good malty backbone. This typifies the American IPA style - nicely balanced with stacks of hop character. A must-have beer."
"O: One and done for me. There are other IPA's I prefer. Two hearted, Green Flash, Hop Devil."
"Overall, Stone's IPA is good fare, and definitely does not shy away from the hops. Hop-lovers will rejoice at this bitterness, but at the same time, many of the beer's more subtle flavors get lost in the mix, marking a possibly huge weakness (depending on your tastes)."
"O: Everything is textbook about this beer from the scent to the flavor to the mouthfeel. A good benchmark IPA."
"Pours golden, frothy head. Smells AWESOME! Very hoppy, very citrusy. The taste was a let down. Did not taste as hoppy as the smell, nor as citrusy as the smell. Not a big fan of the bitterness. Total let down. Typical mouthfeel for an IPA. Solid carbonation. Overall, the bitterness killed this for me. I think without the bitterness, this would've been better. Also, I wish the taste would've matched up with the nose."
"O: Good IPA, very assertive as Stone is known for."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this beer. It is well balanced and highly drinkable."
"Very nice IPA -- it's one of the last major offerings from Stone that I've tried, but it shouldn't be upstaged by its flashier siblings. This IPA is spot-on!"
"What an outstandingly good IPA - less citrus than many, but more of the herbs than most, which really turns your tastebuds on their ear."
"O/D- Just what I was looking for tonight- more bitter than balanced, made my eyes red. A happy example of the style, I think."
"o- This is an excellent beer for a true hophead. It showcases all the aspects of a great american ipa. A highly recommended beer."
"O: a great hoppy beer, this and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale are my go to beers for sessioning"
"Perhaps I got an old bottle; there was no dating but I did buy it from a very solid store that keeps the product moving. Overall the flavors were a bit more muted than I would have liked but this is a solid B IPA nonetheless."
"O: Overall this is a very flavorful and layered IPA, that is a solid goto IPA."
"O - A very well balanced beer. Exactly what I would expect from Stone. I will have this again, as well as any others I can get my hands on!"
"O-terrific IPA with great flavor and balance"
"Another hop-tastic treat from Stone. A vigorous pour creates a beautiful cascading effect, and the lumpy, sticky head is also very pleasing to the eye. Hazy orange color. Soooo aromatic. Pineapple, citrus fruit, and raw, herbal hops- intense aromas. Very complex taste. Nice fruitiness and surprising sweetness. Hop character is bitter and long-lasting, and perhaps a bit medicinal. Herbal for sure. The finish dries up a little, and the oily hop feel is replaced by a more leafy one. Some spice (perhaps from the alcohol) in the finish as well. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery, but the hops make up for it. As a Hophead, this brew makes me very happy."
"Jesus what an incredible beer. After having tried (and enjoyed on several occasions) some Arrogant Bastard Ale (in a bomber no less) I purchased a 6 pack of Stone IPA for $9 today. My immediate reaction? Jesus. The pour is nothing short of beautiful. A foam head at least 1"" thick comes up as soon as the beer hits the glass. The color of the beer itself appears to be the same color as honey is. The smell is definitely a lot of hops, with a strong scent of pine as well. Very, very hoppy. Taste-wise, between the intense amount of hops being present in the beer and the taste of pine and a tiny bit of grapefruit, it's one of a few beers that is actively kicking my ass. All in all, this is a beer that is automatically on my top five list."
"Pours with a hazy orange glow and a foamy head of at least two inches. Head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves minimal lacing. Nose is very hoppy with an herbal and fruity smell. Taste is hoppy with mildly fruity malts. Medium carbonation. Crisp mouthfeel with restrained bitterness. Very drinkable."
"OK, not a heavy hitter but certainly a very drinkable IPA, refreshing, one I would drink on the colder side, say around 45 degrees, and suitable for a warm summer day. The finish is the most distinctive component of this ale and definitely adds to the overall enjoyment. Average ABV for this style. Sells for approximately $42 around here so it’s no bargain when I can buy Victory Hop Devil for less."
"Overall, Stone did a great job. It isn't a surprise that this is on the beers of fame."
"Drinking this right now poured out of a bottle into a Pint glass. Nice head and color. The smell is right on with other ipas. As for the taste... I had stone ipa ruination last week and personally I think this brew does more damage to your palate. Hops are very strong. Immediately attacking the back of your tongue. I feel like I can only have 2 of these and then I can't taste anything. Cant taste much alcohol but the buzz comes in nice and easy. It's a quality beer but i prefer something a bit more drinker friendly."
"O - Very good beer, anytime I try stone I try to keep their reputation from inflating my score's but they are consistently well done."
"Fantastic beer. My friend handed me a bottle. We were looking after a house and I didn't want to bother him with a request for a glass (being that he'd have to wash it) so I just drank it from the bottle as he was. Still an exceptional beer, even just out of the bottle. Can't imagine how incredible it is in a glass much less on tap. Great beer. Bitter is better."
"D- Sits very light. No problem putting away several of these bad boys."
"It goes down easy for a bigger beer, and is deceptively strong for those not paying close attention."
"O- This is a great IPA, very aromatic, great flavor, strong bitterness. This is a great beer and a hophead's dream come true. This beer just tasted so fresh."
"Analysis - great. Could be better but not much. What is missing?"
"O: Very good. It's what I would expect from a West Coast beer; hoppy as all heck, and bitter as an ex who finds out you've done better since leaving her. I wish I'd waited to cook the steak and have it with this beer; the saltiness would have cut this hoppiness nicely. Think I'll grab myself a piece of sharp cheddar. Ciao!"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy amber color with a finger of foamy white head that retains and lace amazingly. The aroma is strong with caramel malt and earthy hops. The taste starts with some caramel and bready malt and then has citrus notes and finishes with the caramel sweetness. The mouthfeel is clean and finishes smooth. Over al a great IPA."
"It is a pleasure, one I rarely anymore so often give myself to where I indulge in this, one of Stone's finest offerings. Sadly, there is so much beer to try and so little time, but today, an old classic reigns in my glass. Frilly lace upon the sides of the caravan as it travels the swivel of my elbow from the table to my mouth. Big time pine in my nose with a little bit of citrus. Drying finish, nice bitterness, subtle malt backbone, just supple enough. This is a classic for a reason. And the reason is love."
"Stone IPA is always around so I don't drink it often but when I do I always question why I don't drink it more often. This is a damn solid IPA, one that I need to remind myself to get reacquainted with from time to time."
"overall, one of my favorite IPAs. just an excellent, well-made, beer. an exemplar of the style."
"Overall I absolutely love this beer, I've probably drank more of this one than any other, its my go to beer for a night of drinking and it never disappoints. I love it fresh and I even like it past date when the hops die down a little and the citrus flavors shine through, fresh or old I love this beer. Thank you Stone for making me a craft beer lover."
"The beer pours out a clear yellow in color with a light head on top. The aroma off the beer is decadent, floral, and really showcases those traditional West Coast hop varieties. The dry hopping allows for more prominent tones of citrus, pine, and maybe some light woody characteristics as well. The taste of the beer is similar to that showcased in the aroma, it's a homage to hops and easily overpowers the malt profile of the beer. Mostly the beer tastes of citrus and piney hops and swallows with a dry finish with lingering hop resin on the tongue. Overall the drink of this beer is great for those hop heads/IPA lovers who are more taken by the West Coast variety of the beer style."
"Stone gets a lot of praise for the other beers that they produce, but this is an underrated example of the West-Coast IPA style. It’s a little bit light in body, but this lends to easy drinking. The hop profile and underrated malt backbone make this beer a winner."
"As a fan of IPA (and a fan of Stone in general) this is a good but very mild IPA. Its taste is mild and smooth. I would have loved to have had some more hop flavor... it has the look and smell of a good IPA.... but, could use just more... oomph! That said, I have had it a few times, when I am in the mood..."
"Although it's a bit pricey for a 6 pack, this is a classic American IPA...one not to be missed."
"I thought I had seen a nice spectrum of IPAs up to this point but Stone really kicked me to the curb with this one. Bitterness is really up there, great smell, and very balanced. Hop heads rejoice."
"Might be the best IPA I've ever had (and I've said that a lot lately). There are no flaws with this beer and I'm not sure my 4.5s across the board do it justice."
"Pours light yellowish orange with a nice big white head. The head disappears to almost nothing within a couple minutes but still leaves some nice lacing on the sides of the glass. The smell right away is hops. For just a regular IPA it's probably one of the most hoppiest smelling beers I've had. Citrus, piney, grassy, a bit earthy. Almost like holding hops up to your nose. The taste like the smell is hops. At first it almost seems balanced when it hit's your mouth but then as it sits for a second the hops take over. Citrus, pine, a little grassy. Ends with a nice bitterness and hop bite aftertaste. At almost 7% ABV it's not terribly high so multiple bottles wouldn't be a problem in one sitting. Overall it's a fantastic IPA and one I've been drinking a ton of lately. So when I can't afford Ruination this is definitely a damn good substitute. Another solid beer from Stone."
"I can't think of anything wrong with this beer. If you like American IPAs and want an outstanding example of one, look no further."
"Pint glass pour with a great apricot colored ale with a foamy white head that looks like whipped cream sitting atop the brew. Well done. Nice fruity aroma with mangos, pears, orange and light malt. Nice bitter taste with an even bigger bite on the swallow. Big malty backbone helps to even it out and there is a long bitter aftertaste that sits well on the buds. More carbonated than I would like from this IPA. Overall this is an easy drinking IPA and each time I drink it…multiples are easily consumed. An above average IPA from a great brewery. This beer has everything one could look for in a balanced IPA."
"D- this is a definite repeat based on the high drinkability. this beer looks, tastes, and drinks very FRESH. hop pines are almost to the level of a DIPA but much more fresh and airy. I could easily drink this beer this entire summer and not ever get sick of it. It is a great, great IPA."
"O: Definitely a solid IPA. For somebody who doesn't like a sweetness balancing out the bitterness. They make no claim of a bitterness that is balanced on the label."
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on July 2, 2011. This is an pour with a touch of cloudiness and a thin head. The aroma is not quite as full as I anticipated but there is definitely a noted floral hoppiness as is to be expected. The body is creamy and medium. Oh, but the taste really makes up for any flaws (as few as they are) that may be noted at first. Bitter hops with a fruity sweetness on the side."
"D-Overall this was a very pleasant IPA. Not too boring or too hoppy like some. Had the right amount of hops and other flavors. Would get this again. Give this one a try."
"Overall-Great IPA. The Dry-Hopping aroma doesn't shine as much as I'd like on this bottle, but this is a very nice beer with excellent drinkability."
"Poured a 3"" off-white head which took a while to dissipate. Beautiful hazy orangy gold color. Smell has hops and citrus. Taste is more of the same and although not the most complex of Stone's offerings I'll pay them the compliment for in this case not actually overduing the beer into another of their big bold blowouts. Finish is pretty long and has some acidity and a touch of saltiness."
"Not over the top, but insanely drinkable."
"Poured a hazy peach-orange with a finger of foamy white head that retained decently and left a bit of lace on the glass. Mainly citrus hops in the aroma; piney. A base of sweet maltiness in the taste is overshadowed by piney hops; notes of grapefruit and orange. Hops are in command, but there is still a pretty decent balance happening. Medium-bodied and easily drinkable for the style."
"Mouthfeel- sticky, resin left behind, a medium body to it."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice straw golden color to it with a nice 2 inch fizzy white head. The smell is nice of hops with a hint of pine. The taste is good of hops with that little kick of bitterness on the back of the tongue, to me it screams drink some more. It also has some malt to it to. The mouth feel is great, nice and smooth with some carbonation. Overall i really like this beer and could drink it all the time."
"O - This really tasted great this evening. My kind of brew: Fruity, bright citrus and a grapefruit bitter finish. Reminds me of a Port Mongo or Fat Head's Head Hunter. Good stuff."
"MF- Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Strangely, as it warms, the less syrupy it gets. A very nice beer."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle (with freshness dating) into my Dale's Pale Ale shaker glass. Very nice cloudy, orange/amber hue with a finger or so of head. Head fades moderately quickly, but nice sticky lacing. First whiff is a load of flowers up my nose. A little bit of light pine, light skunk/cat pee (though not in the light-struck sense) and promises of bitterness. Very bright and fresh pine flavors. A hint of lemon on the finish. 9/10 bitter-wise. Creamy at first on the mouth, and then a nice carbonation prickle. Such a great beer."
"Overall an excellent IPA."
"On a side note my appreciation for Stone grows with every one of their offerings that I try. Kudos to the guys at stone who just don’t seem to miss on any of their ales."
"Serving type: bottle/ straight from the bottle and favorite flute Stone IPA glass."
"O: Great IPA – very hoppy and tart. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming and is blends in nicely with the hops."
"This is a really nice example of an American IPA that has been on the scene for a while. I haven't had it in a year or two at least and I am glad I came back to it. This is a really great beer that is widely available."
"Overall I really enjoyed ""this"" bottle of Stone IPA. I say that because I don't believe I have ever had a fresh bottle of this. Stone has just recently started ""best enjoyed by"" dating their bottles and this one is dated 07/05/11. This is one of the beers that I cut my teeth on but that was 6 or 7 years ago and I haven't really enjoyed any that I have had (since way back then) until this one. Cheers to Stone for freshness dating their bottles. Even though it is really hard to see."
"M - Perfect carbonation, light to moderate feel, smooth."
"This is a good beer. It once made a dinner with business colleagues beerable at a Black Angus (kudos to a chain restaurant for offering it) in Lakewood, CA."
"O - Pretty good. I could drink this regularly but when you compare it to some of the other offerings available locally it really comes up short. Still a good beer tho."
"Overall, I am very pleased. And were the ABV not above 6%, I would happily session this IPA on a workday. Well, maybe I will anyway..."
"D. Although Stone IPA is highly-regarded, I found it to be ok, but there are other examples of the style I'd reach for first."
"M: first you have a neutral sensation and then starts the bitterness of the hops very strong and lasting a lot in the back of the mouth."
"Bottle. Pours a clear golden copper color with a white fluffy head. Nice lace left on the glass. Orange, citrus, grassy, all in the nose. Clean and crisp. Light/medium mouthfeel. Buliding bitterness. Sweet upfront with the bitterness flavors. I know this is highly rated and it’s decent but in all honestly I’d almost rather have a Centennial IPA from Fournders."
"-JH-"
"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a golden/orange color with a 1 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is also very hoppy, considerable bitterness, lacking in the citrus notes found in most IPA's. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"Stone IPA is the pinnacle of SoCal IPA's."
"Pours a gorgeous deep gold in my snifter. Perfect creamy barely off- white head. Very well rounded nose with smooth hop citrus, pine and grass. Smooth sweetness up front with delicious hop bitterness in the middle and a nice dry finish. Carbonation is spot- on with a lightly sticky mouthfeel. Super drinkable for a 6.9 ABV. Alcohol warms the belly but does not interfere with the taste. Excellent!"
"Overall Impression- Such a great balanced IPA! Excited because this is the 3rd Stone beer we have had in the past month @ the Wolf Public House and all of them are fan favorites. Easy drinkability with this one and will be enjoying more!"
"O: Begs for a hot day and a BBQ."
"Pairs extremely well with burgers and fries."
"O - I like this beer even more than I remembered, maybe I should start considering it one of my favorite ipas again - at least for the summer"
"Taste- Hoppy from start to finish.. very good creamy mouth feel too. If you love hops then this beer is for you. This beer is pretty straight forward... not a lot of complexities... just hops and more hops."
"Overall I thought this one was pretty decent, the 1st couple sips kind of turned me off but I it warmed slightly the taste got a lot better."
"Drink- I'll always come back to this one. Such a classic example of what a single IPA can and should be. Everyone getting into IPA's should have this."
"Probably a standard in the American IPA category. A showcase of a very well balanced brew. Hoppy but not offensive to the palate in any way with a solid malt base to balance it out."
"Overall: A total classic; one of the IPAs that all other IPAs are measured against."
"Exceptional IPA."
"Overall: See drinkability."
"My favorite Single I.P.A.!"
"MF: Nice an crisp, creamy and refreshing."
"O - Like many people, I enjoy Stone's brews. They are uniformly excellent and their IPA is no exception. I could drink this anytime."
"To sum up in three words: Dry hopped awesomeness."
"O-Very good brew, many more of these will be consumed in my lifetime."
"$2.20 a single."
"This is a really good IPA, but I must give it slightly lower marks than the Full Sail that I just finished. To me, the Stone has a bit of a toasted bread flavor, while the Full Sail is more melon and grass. They're both excellent, and I would be excited to discover either in the fridge, but I'm leaning toward the Full Sail. That being said, the Stone does have a mouthfeel, the word ""structure"" comes to mind, that is perfectly in balance. I can see why so many others rate it an ""A"."
"Overall, this one is a good IPA. It's not my favorite out of California, but one I find myself still buying every now and then."
"Back in the early part of the 2000s, before I got into beer, I imagine that this was considered a top-tier IPA. It still should be. Stone has never distributed to where I live (though where I used to live, Kansas City, just started receiving Stone beers). Whenever I'd be in a city that has Stone, I'd always pass up the IPA in favor of bigger, rarer offerings. So this is my first Stone IPA. I wish I'd have had one sooner. It's a lovely example of the American IPA style. It'd be a mainstay of my fridge if I lived within Stone's distribution."
"O: I could drink this everyday, all year round until I ran out of money. Hands down, this is in my top 3 of IPAs."
"Medium body with a zippy carbonation. A solid basic IPA - very drinkable."
"Served on tap into a pint shaker glass. Poured an orangeish/amberish color with a nice foamy 1/4 inch head that quickly disapated. Nice lacing, however. Aromas of malt, hops, and pine. Taste was bitter hops, malt, some pine, and some citrus. Overall, this is not my fav. I tend to like my IPAs more balanced; this one is the west coast hops in your face. Not bad but..."
"O: Even being a big fan of IPA and drinking them all the time, this beer blew my mind! I don’t know WHO told me that this was bad or maybe I dreamt it (the reason I waited so long to try it). But if I remember, I will never trust their beer taste again. As an end of finals celebration I always get a nice 6-pack or two, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. I would recommend this beer to anyone… HANDS DOWN one of my favorite IPA!"
"D/O- Not my favorite IPA, would place it in the top of the second tier. An enjoyable experience for certain though. Thanks PTMcB."
"O: This is refreshing, flavorful, and satisfying - which is great for an IPA. And, with summer just starting, I have the feeling I'll be stocking these $5 bombers deep. Great bang for your buck!"
"Yes, this is a good beer. And so was the one I had in Australia."
"Overall, this a pretty great IPA, though not my favorite. There is no denying the quality of this brew, however, and it's a cornerstone of the style for a reason."
"Overall:A bitter sipper that is great for those who love hops. there are a lot here. I would get this again, but only one per sitting. Very much a California IPA."
"Stone IPA has a thick, off-white head and a hazy, golden appearance with some bubbles streaming up and a good amount of lacing rings left behind. The aroma is sweet, piney, sharp, and fruity. Taste is mostly hops, hops, hops, and there is some citrusy aspect and oiliness. Mouthfeel is medium, and Stone IPA finishes crisp, refreshing, mostly dry, and quite delicious. This is a very enjoyable ale."
"Always read the stories on the bottle, very entertaining."
"Notes. One of the first West Coast IPAs to which I was exposed. It still holds its own within the style, even in a saturated market. A classic."
"T: I don't know about this one. I know a lot of people like it and it has great reviews, but it just doesn't do it for me. There's just nothing to this one. There are some decent hop flavors upfront, but then nothing else happens and it ends on a semi-bitter note and seems watered down throughout. It's not the worst IPA I've ever had, but it's just not that good for me. Stone missed the mark on this one. Ruination, on the other hand..."
"overall well-balanced, very drinkable."
"This beer was excellent, maybe my new favorite IPA over Pliney and Green Flash West Coast IPA."
"Pours a slightly hazy bright gold. One finger creamy white head that provides some lacing. Nice carbonation: steady streams of tiny bubbles throughout. Aroma is piney hops with rosemary/floral on orange marmalade on crackers. Pine-grapefruit taste, no sweetness here. Bitterness dominates mouthfeel yet creamy. Lingering bitterness."
"D: This is a damn good, easy drinking IPA; such a nice example of a hop forward--without going crazy--IPA"
"O-An excellent IPA that I'm excited to have in the St.Louis market and that only cost me $3.99!"
"22oz. bomber poured into pint glass. Clear light golden color with creamy, fluffy and sticky white head that lasted forever! An excellent presentation. This is a hop beast with hop aroma all over and bitter taste to perfection with nice malt balance to the finish. Big, smooth and creamy body. This is IPA - WANT HOPS!"
"O- Great IPA, a pillar of hoppiness."
"Overall I think this is such a well-rounded IPA. It goes down very easily, and although it has a higher abv than the BMC's of the world, it can just as easily be a session beer. It has been my go to for months, and I am still not sick of it. Just can't wait to try all the rest that Stone Brewing Co. has to offer."
"O: Exceptional IPA, one of the best I've had that is a standard brew, not a special bottle type. Really beautiful colors, great aroma and a great taste. Can't wait to drink the rest of this 6 pack and to stock my fridge with this in the future."
"22oz bottle poured into a tulip. Best by date is 5/5/11. Pours a cloudy yellow orange with two fingers of frothy foam and moderate carbonation. Nice lacing. Nose is lovely. Elegantly hoppy and bitter. Nice, playfully fresh hops with just a slight hint of malt. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Lively carbonation. Palate is all hops dancing on the tongue. Not super resiny. Just resiny enough to give the finish a long and pleasing bitterness. The hop flavors are so light, they have a more floral quality than you find in most IPAs. This continues to be one of my favorite expressions of the style."
"this was good, but was a bit lacking overall. i'd like to see a bit more hops with this being their IPA. still a treat though!"
"poured into tulip glass,cloudy orange in color,nice two finger head,with good lacing,with hop resin on side of glass,nose is classic ipa,grapefruit,citrus,pine,hops,hops,hops..classic west coast ipa,hop bomb,very little malt...a hop heads dream!!,go out and get this classic aipa offering from a great san diego brewer...CHEERS!!!"
"Pored a golden haze, one finger head, medium carbonation. Smell was not a powerful as I expected, citrus stood out. The pine and citrus hop flavors go well together. Had a dry ending and after two I could taste the resin on my lips. Overall a solid IPA, I can't believe I waited this long to try it."
"Overall, this one should be on standby in my fridge and is perfectly tasty on any given day. This is a great showing from Stone. I just wish there were more hops on the nose since your sense of smell is half the experience."
"I've been on quite the IPA kick the past few months and this was by far the easiest of the lot to drink. Its not as overpoweringly hoppy and piney as some of the others and they got the sweetness just right for my liking. Very enjoyable and will probably become a regular pick up."
"So glad Stone is finally here and that I can mark this occasion with a staple IPA. JAH BLESS"
"Overall: A crisp, clean IPA with a subtle sweetness. Highly sessionable with no detectable flaws."
"Stone claims their IPA is a good example of a style that (they define) as being ""highly hopped and high in alcohol"". More accurately, it's the benchmark of a style that Stone themselves pioneered and popularized: a hugely hoppy ale that is stingingly citric, brutally bitter, tremendously tropical, remarkably refreshing and candidly characterful."
"O- An excellent summer weather IPA. Quenches thirst and not extremely high on the ABV in terms of Stone's standards."
"Overall, this is a great beer from Stone. I think they made it really stick to the Stone name. Definitely find this one."
"O: A top tier IPA from Stone Brewing Co. An excellent example of the style and a well done beer."
"I've been on an IPA/DIPA kick lately. I was on a barleywine run over the cold months, and the IPAs were leaving me cold. However, IPA has been my favorite style for a while now. The latest one to retry was this one. Here goes. It looks good poured. Nice head. Smells strongly of pine. Tastes piney and citrusy in equal measures. This one went down quickly. Not a strong alcohol IPA, but pretty strong tasting. Bitter just the way I like it - not as much as Ruination, which is ok. Solid all the way around. I'm sure I'll enjoy the next 5."
"O - A very solid AIPA but the Pliney and Sculpin have its measure"
"This beer feels light and easy to drink, even though it has some kick to it, and is so drinkable it’s almost scary; this is a top notch beer which I have immensely enjoyed for years and one that I highly recommend. This is the epitome of an IPA."
"D: I can definitely see this as my go to IPA. Very well distributed. Incredible balance, great feel, and just a very drinkable beer overall. A definite staple for the style."
"Overall this is solid you just can't go wrong with it, it's also a personal fav for this style as well for me."
"Overall Drinkability - Good kick in the taste buds when you're craving an IPA."
"Overall a great beer. Nothing is out of balance and the hops are really sharp and piney. Some sweetness brings everything full circle. Plus you could look at and drink this beer all day."
"Overall: Great IPA, the hops and bitterness are not quite as strong as I had anticipated.. but it makes for amazing drinkability on an amazing taste."
"A wonderful beer. It is outdone by Stone's Ruination IPA, but that one is just crazy good."
"Finish: Nice bitterness creeps in and soaks into the palate with a little stickiness on the lips"
"M/O: Excellent carbonation, crisp mouthfeel, goes down smooth. It's been a good amount of months since I've had stone IPA; it was the first beer to truly get me into craft beers, and I felt like I had moved on. But getting back to it after having tried so many more IPAs.... I remember how amazing it really is. This is one of those beers that you have to judge everything else by."
"I found Stone IPA extremely satisfying and most enjoyable."
"Overall solid IPA can't go wrong with this although there is a lot of options too choose from craft and homebrew. A beer to impress a hop enthusiast friend."
"It's spring, so I am ending my IPA cycle, and getting ready for another summer of wheat beer fun. The Stone IPA was a great way to end the IPA season. The Stone IPA pours a nice head that goes the distance. Aroma is just as it should be, very inviting, which foreshadows what is to come. Many IPA's start out sweet, then bring on the hop and bitter. The Stone has a nice blend of hop flavor and underlying sweetness from start to finish. Not much bitter to this brew. Very smooth, with a luscious mouthfeel. I give it high marks. So good it made me go over my one beer per night limit when I brought the six pack home."
"Overall: A fine beer"
"Overall: A phenomenal IPA."
"Pours a hazy golden-orange with a two-finger white head which reduces to a constant ring leaving nice sticky lace, and smells predominantly hoppy, with lots of rich citrus fruit and flowery aromas and a touch of papaya and biscuity malt. The palate's mild malty sweetness is very quickly bowled over by the resiny and very leafy hoppiness, while the nice bitterness provides the fuel for the long, dry and slightly mouthwatering finish."
"O: To me this was a very lemony (but not too far) hoppy pale malt creation that works. Its bitter but balanced and not too acidic. I could drink many of these. Strangely when I had a bomber I did not enjoy it as much. Great everyday IPA."
"O - As it warmed, the character of the beer comes out, I really enjoyed the Stone IPA, I wish there was a little more fruit flavor, but overall a very good IPA"
"O - I really enjoyed this beer. I'm glad to know realize that its better than i thought it was earlier."
"Overall: A damn good beer."
"Goes down very smooth and it's a very easy drinking beer as far as IPA's go. Highly recommended."
"O: A good brew, however, I'm not as impressed as I thought I was going to be. Could taste a little more alcohol than I was expecting. As I drink a lot of IPAs from around the country, I was expecting this to have a more floral taste, however, the bitter hoppy flavor is still quite pleasant."
"Very good example of the style."
"O: The beer is extremely drinkable because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste and the hops do not overpower your palate. I could easily drink a few of these in one sitting."
"O: Very drinkable. I wouldn't call this beer great, but I could likely drink all night, and that's a sign of a quality flagship beer, as this is."
"Drinkability. I could blaze through a few of these without any effort. Good stuff."
"DELICIOUS, SEEK IT OUT!"
"D - There is no doubt that this is a hoppy beer so it might not be for everybody, but it is crafted so well that the balance makes it entirely drinkable."
"The most British of the west-coast IPAs. A delicious IPA from the king of hops."
"D- Very drinkable, a solid IPA from the west coast. Nice and balanced with all the ingredients. Perfect for a nice hot summer day."
"Nice looking pour with a healthy 2 finger head. Froth settled down, but left quite a bit of lacing. Light yellow amber color with some decent carbination to make the beer refreshing. Has the grapfruit citrus taste up front that I really enjoy. Has a decent hop kick, but not so bitter that you couldn't drink more than a few of these without getting too full. In fact the back end of the taste, it is actually very smooth- the more I drink it the better it tastes."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Quite smooth with a bit of orange zest. Very crisp, drinkable and refreshing."
"D: All night long - just fabulous!"
"D - Very drinkable, though starting to get a little high on the ABV for too many in one session."
"Drinkability - I'm not even done with it and want another. Just an awesome west coast IPA can't wait to try something else from Stone."
"I have really started to love the complexities of IPAs. The ipa from the stone brewing company is a great one. The piney citrus comes on strong as soon as this champion hits your tongue. The bitter finish packs quite a punch. This beer is deffinatly not for the drinkers of that sissy lite swill that little lady-like fellas love. I would expect any less from the makers of arrogant bastard!"
"Drinkability - Everytime I have a Stone beer I'm impressed. This brew is no different. Very solid all the way around. Perfect for the Spring and Summer day. Most definitely worth a try. Cheers!!!!"
"M - Light. Moderate carbonation. Semi-sweet finish."
"Yum!"
"D. I really like this IPA I get it everytime I can find it Thank You Stone"
"This IPA pours a nice clear golden color with excellent retention, some of the best lacing I have seen on a beer and good carbonation too. The smell is of herbal hops, some pine, a little bit of citrus and pineapple. The aroma makes me look forward to the taste. The taste is strong herbal hops followed by some grassy earthy taste than some pineapple and citrus in the middle and staying until the end and finishes off with more herbal hops. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy and very enjoyable to drink since it is so good that it just goes down nicely. This a a must try IPA, great beer highly recommend it."
"D: Great overall drinkability. I only mark down slightly because of my personal taste. I have a hard time drinking more than a couple of any IPA or similarly hoppy beer. This is probably an exception to the rule though because of the smooth finish and buttery mouthfeel."
"Some might like the bitterness (and Stone writes clearly on the bottle that they loaded their IPA with hops), but it just isn't for me."
"Poured from the bottle and amber hued clean orang with a carbonated thin white head that receded and gave some good lacing to the glass. Smell is of centinial and magnum hops with a tiny hint of some caramel malt, but let's be honest this beer is about the hops. Taste is pine citrus and lemon with a smooth backing of caramel malt with a biting hop finish. Mouthfeel is balanced and simple not too heavy but not efforvescent. Drinkability is easy as this is a classic american india pale ale. Give me another."
"Good beer."
"D - A good beer that is worth trying."
"A nice IPA at a solid price."
"D= for someone in an entirely IPA-max mode this is probably great stuff. For the more casual IPA lover like me who is still a total Stone fan, but who prefers a little balance and flavor, it's got limited tolerability. Plus, there are no ratings for ""Stomach"" and mine is complaining about acid-overload at the moment."
"D - Still a good beer, big pine hops checking in."
"d- very light, easily kill a 12"
"That said, the taste certainly didn't disappoint, I prefer a more bitter finish to IPA, this was a bit sweet, but overall very pleased. Will certainly buy again."
"Taste is bitter, sticky and a bit sweet but the malt takes a bac seat in this big west coaster. A bit harsh on the finish but it's solid. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich. Very good."
"D - reasonably drinkable for almost 7% ABV. IPAs are not my favorite style, but I liked this a lot. I'd say that it's my favorite IPA that I've tried so far."
"Overall: Strangely enough, I rarely drink Stone beer when I'm at Stone. This is the sort of beer that's always there and is often overshadowed by flashier offerings. However, this is definitely a good IPA, and sadly one that I probably won't drink again for some time. Still, tasty stuff."
"Overall: Smell was exceptional,the taste was ood."
"D - Good drinkability. An impressive IPA overall."
"D - A very tasty IPA, loads of hops with a nice bitterness that makes it easily drinkable. A light and floral hop offering and easily a hop head favourite."
"Great mouthfeel, medium bodied. Very drinkable, I see myself enjoying another one in the future."
"Exceptional."
"drinkability - could drink this beer all night, this was my first stone and i loved it."
"D - this is a hop heads prayer answered, so crisp and clean with a great flavour mix, and blackout drinkable at 6.9%"
"D- Even though the hops dominate this one it is very drinkable. Overall, a very good American IPA that is extemely well rounded. I'm going to have to grab this again next time I see it."
"Pours nice and crisp into my pint glass. Copper color, small head, nice carbonation. Smells of citris, pine and floral. Taste of hops and honey. Nice light IPA flavor easy to drink. Not bad for a west coast IPA. No match for Sothwest Michigan IPA. Nice try Stone!"
"Stone IPA made for a perfect early evening on this unseasonably nice mid-February day. It went well with a Nicaraguan puro cigar, an aged Don Pepin Garcia Cuban Classic robusto. This IPA is as good as any of my favorites and will surely be a regular in my fridge from this day forward."
"Very drinkable and highly recommended."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden hue with a white, foamy, long lasting white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops and biscuit malt. Light-medium, tangy body. Citrusy hops dominate the flavor with a biscuit malt provide good balance. Finish is long lasting, dry and hoppy. It's a good IPA like many others."
"D- The best (single) IPA i've ever had!"
"Drinkability is actually pretty good. Not really a hophead, but I'm trying to expand my palate and beers like this give me hope that some IPAs might just be for me. Really a very nice beer to sip and savor through the course of an evening. Cheers to Stone Brewing for another quality brew."
"D: A good beer and one that's easy to drink, but I'm not sure I'm interested in the flavors enough to look for a second glass of this right away. Nonetheless, a beer I'll be having again."
"Overall, just a solid IPA. It doesn't bring anything new or outstanding, but is just very solid. Does not disappoint"
"D-I don't know what it is about the boys over at stone but they have never let me down, another fantastically drinkable beer and another job well done."
"One of the best"
"This is the final beer of my Stone ""kick"". This beer pours a thin burnt gold with a one finger white head. The aromas are of bitter pine. It's nothing I haven't seen before. The flavors are of pine and grapefruit, yet both bitter and sweet. The malt kind of becomes rather prevalent after a few sips and gives it a moderate amount of sweetness. This beer drinks between light and medium with a very, very dry finish. I hate dry finishes. I'm not a fan of induced cotton mouth and this beer brings it. It's unfair to this one that I compare it to Ruination and their 14th Anniversary Emperial IPA but this one doesn't hold a candle to either. The cotton mouth is a little much and it isn't as complex as their other aforementioned IPAs. This beer is pretty average in my opinion, as far as IPAs go."
"D: This is another wonderful citrus-forward IPA. It's one of my favorites."
"D-wow i could drink this all night long. you know, i've seen this beer so many times and always passed it up because it was always there no matter where i was, i never had a sense of urgency to buy it. i regret turning my back to this beer for so long. this is amazing! i love it! it has a perfect ABV as well. i hope to have this again and again!"
"I am really happy to have been able to try what is so widely regarded as one of he best ipa's out there. I am going to put this on my list to re-review when the time comes."
"D - Drinkable because of the nice bitter finish and because it tastes so darn good."
"Drinkability: A truly excellent IPA. While its intense hoppiness makes it a bit of a sipping beer, it is still a pleasure to drink. Anyone who has tried Stone's other offering should, to some degree, know what to expect from this beer. If you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out."
"D - Solid offering from Stone and a good take on the style. If you're an IPA fan, its worth giving this one a shot."
"Drinkability: Very high! Truly great beer with a lot of elements working in it's favor!"
"D: Very solid IPA."
"D: A very drinkable IPA full of fresh hop flavor. This is pretty much an archetype beer with nothing really wrong with it. Cheers to Stone yet again!"
"This is overall one of the most solid IPA's, you can never go wrong with this one."
"D - I felt that the piney hops were almost over the top. I liked this beer but when I was done with this bottle I was done with this beer for a while. By the end the hop bitterness had gotten old. The citrusy hops in something like Racer 5 IPA don't wear on me near as much."
"Final thought - You can get this beer at Disneyland and Angel games. Enough said"
"A decent IPA. Nothing too outstanding, but it seems Stone reserves its crazy side for beers like Ruination and Arrogant Bastard. It's actually refreshing to see some semblance of balance from them in this beer."
"Overall, like I said it isn't going to make you drool for more but it is a great goto especially at bars that have bud, coors, miller, bluemoon, and stone ipa. Can't go wrong with it in that situation..."
"The appearance is slightly hazy and light orange in color. The head is a half inch thick and leaves a formidable sheet of lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is bold, with hops soaked in alcohol being the dominant scent. The flavor is very enjoyable and hop forward, with subtle citrus notes. The finish is quite bitter (in a positive sense) and has a warming alcohol sensation to cap the whole thing off. Overall, a very good IPA."
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a hazy straw yellow with a two finger pure white head that subsided to a half finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, pine, and pine hops. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, pine, and bitter hops. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was quite an excellent IPA. This one had a good balanced flavor to it. The caramel in it really seemed to help bridge the gap between sweet and bitter. Also the aroma was quite good as well. A must try for any IPA fan that hasn't had it before."
"D: Very drinkable, has nice hop characteristics. A good IPA overall, not the best I've had (really not even close) but a good beer to say the least."
"Not a bad IPA by any means but I won't be buying another sixer of this anytime soon."
"D: An outstanding IPA. A must-try for hopheads."
"This is a solid west coaster IPA, a bit more hoppier than I like my beers but it is well crafted none the less."
"Nice carbonation and the lighter body would make multiples of these enjoyable. I would highly recommend getting a few of these because they would only get better with more of them. I think this would be great anytime of the year. Is Stone capable of producing bad beer? I think not."
"Like all of the Stone offerings I have had, there is alot of flavor in this beer and it's pretty balanced, mouthfeel is no different. Really balanced, mild IPA mouth feel.  Moderate ABV, and I think if I had this in a 12 oz bottles I could put a bunch away on a tailgate. "
"OK- what is it about this beer that people like so much? Ok, so was at the brewery and man is it cool. One of the coolest in America but this beer was just bitter at the finish. Not balanced, off aroma etc. And, normally when I am at a brewery everything just taste so much better. They have Gardens , FIRE, Water, Fire in Water you name it but I judge a brewery by their IPA and this didn't do it for me. Obviously, 2000 other reviewers disagree but I oh well."
"The beer was a nice dark orange with even an aggressive pour got very little head to form. The definition of a nice west coast IPA. The nice citrus with the dense pine smell as well. This was a nice tasting IPA that was more towards the piney side than I would have 1st thought. Some of the off center colored citrus, grapefruit and some hops mostly. Very good. Spicy, citrus and hoppy. Medium bodied with a well paired carb level. A nicely done IPA in taste and feel. A very, very drinkable IPA with some great flavors. A most have for hop-heads."
"Medium bodied, medium carbonation, sticky and bitter but not overpowering. Super drinkable, excellent flavor, and the alcohol is practically invisible. I pass this up in bottles frequently due freshness issues, but on tap it reminds me why I enjoy this beer so much."
"D: IPAs are one of my favorite beers so I could drink plenty of these, it is a sessionable beer for me. It is a little costly in New York, but well worth the price."
"D - A great IPA any brewery could be proud of. Well done."
"Supportive body, not heavy, but balanced and porportional. Reminds me of a more refined leaner and fuller Punk IPA. Pretty certain this was BrewDog's inspiration."
"Best before 2/06/11, was in the refrigerator case at my liquor store. Really nice lacing on the glass too. Smell is of some tropical fruits, citrus and some herbal grassy notes, and some odd glue/acetate odors in the alcohol. Hmm, not what I would normally expect from an American IPA. Fortunately, the taste comes through nicely without the strange off flavors I got from the smell, not sure if that is a by product of the yeast or what. Anyway, the taste is nice and hoppy, big resinous pine and grapefruit, and some sweet malt in there to balance things, a little. The mouthfeel is somewhat smooth, and full bodied. Wow, I am getting a real nice long bitter aftertaste, most be a lot of resins in those hops, whole leaf?? Overall, once I can get past the weirdness in the nose, believe it or not this is a great beer. So far I like their IPA best, the bigger ones get a little too rich, sweet and malty. I just noticed I drank half a glass of this pretty darn quick! I think I will get another six pack of this again soon, and see if I still get the ""glue"" smells."
"When I imagine a standard ipa, this is what I think of. It isn't a tropical fruity, sweet ipa, and it isn't a high hop, high malt backbone ipa. Nothing overpowers and it's hop dominated. Bitter and crisp."
"One of my go to beers, highly recomended."
"D - a very drinkable beer"
"the mouthfeel is nice and light and crisp, and the drinkability is high this is an awesome ipa"
"Out of the fridge for about 30 mins. I have had this beer several times but never got around to reviwing it. Pours a nice two finger head with a pale golden straw colored body. Ample carbonation and some lacing. The nose is piney with hints of tropical fruits...green apples, hops, malt. The alcohol is very well masked. As for the taste, fresh hops are the first thing I notice followed by subtle malt. The mouth feel is light approaching medium in body. One of my favorite IPA's."
"I've been gaining steam with my experience into american craft breweries, buying singles all over the place trying to expand my repertoire as much as possible. THIS beer makes me want to settle down and buy a six pack, and that says a lot"
"Overall this is how a standard IPA should taste. Grey beer that I buy often. If you can try the double dryhopped version. Even better"
"pours a slightly hazy golden tangerine with a tight/bright/and white 2-finger head, leaving healthy lacing all the way down the glass as the head fades into surface film with a thick ring - the hop aroma is nice, along with fresh grassy/piney action - taste follows nice and sharp, a good hop bite on the tip of the tongue with a nice citrus fade towards the back - a little sticky, yet clean, knowwhati'msayin'? = very smooth - I wish she'd picked up a couple more, this one went down way too easy."
"Could barely wait to try this IPA. Poured a hazy orange, cloudy with large fluffy head. Smelled of lemony, citrusy hops with a nice balance between bitter and sweet. Tastes of sweet lemons and hops. A little bit of a sticky finish. Mouthfeel is pleasant and man, this is a very drinkable IPA. Stone never fails to disappoint."
"I am very impressed with this beer, by bottle and by tap! Its taste is very smooth for a beer such high alcohol content. Quite hoppy with not to much sweetness. The color is beatiful, not to dark with little haze. This is a solid choice all year long!"
"Pours a cloudy yellow color, huge head, and as expected, huge lacing. Aroma is hops, hops, and more hops. It is simple, but appealing. A bit of citrus and slight grapefruit, but the aroma is of primarily hops.Bitter hops dominate the taste, with some lemon and citrus, with hop bitterness dominating the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated, and drinkability is good for a beer of this ABV. Overall a good IPA, but nothing special. Ruination is a lot better"
"d- it's a good IPA, I feel that IPA's are either your thing or not..."
"D - Very very drinkable. Stone makes very good IPAs."
"Leaves a nice sticky bitter coating in mouth and is very crisp from start to finish. Alcohol is not noticeable at all, and each gulp does down easy. Simple, well done IPA."
"D- Fairly high. And damn cheap. Pretty good stuff. Not top-tier, but tasty. Check the date, buy it fresh, enjoy."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Nice fluffy white head. The beer is fairly orange in color. Nice ABV for a simple IPA. Fairly pungent hop aroma. Pine smelling hops. The beer is fairly transparent as well. Slightly creamy. The palate could be a bit better. The beer is full of hop flavor. The dry hopping did pay off if you ask me. The bittering hop just gets all over the back of your mouth. I love this beer because the focus is all in the hops. Not really much to say about the malts. Overall, a good bitter/hoppy IPA from Stone!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Thanks for letting me snag one of your bottles of this guy Andy! Pours a slightly hazy straw color with about a finger of white fluffy head. A big aroma of dry piney hops and citrus zest. The aroma very nicely blends dry and juicy aromas. Probably the most balanced IPA I've smelled in a while. This is like smelling a pine tree spayed with sweet tropical juice. The taste is perfect. It simply doesn't get better than this. Dry piney hops, dry bitter flavor with a lemony finish and slight citrus flavor. The mouthfeel is light and sharply carbonated. Nothing to argue with here. This is amazing. I want to be able to get this with my meal at Wendy's. I simply want this all the time. It's almost not fair that I can't drink this all the time."
"Maybe not my favourite IPA ever, but in terms of mass produced IPAs it's well up there. Please, someone, anyone, make this available in Ontario."
"Packed with big flavor and freshness, this is a top-tier brew with character and guts."
"The carbonation is pretty high, as indicated by the foaming during the pour; possibly emphasizing the bitterness. Good drinkability on this one. It's one of my favorites."
"pretty nice drink ability...prob not quite a session but close"
"D- This is a great IPA and really worth trying if you like IPAs. I will definitely buy it again, but I don't see this being my go-to IPA."
"I've had a lot of IPAs lately and they all seem to start running together. The market is saturated with a lot IPAs tasting really similar. This one is very good and not overpowering. The Ruination is definitely more along the lines of what I've been seeing in the market lately, but this beer is a nice balance of body and taste. Very good."
"The CPJ"
"Another outstanding IPA, a good solid example of the West Coast IPAs. I miss my home state so much. Will be getting again, when I can find it here."
"Thank goodness I have a 6 pack of this because just one will not suffice. Well worth the price."
"This is another West Coast, citrusy hoppy. beer. The taste is very good but it seems to lack a bit of body and finish. This would be a dry IPA to my taste and lacking a bit of a malt balance."
"The hop bitterness, the bready malt and the hop pine flavor is everything you could ever ask for in this style of beer. West coast IPA's usually have this sort of pungent different smelling and tasting IPA but this one nails that unique quality of a west coast beer. The only one that I've tried that comes close is Sierra Nevada's Torpedo ale but I'd say this has a richer taste to it plus more hoppy bitterness. Thank you Greg Koch for my favorite IPA to date."
"D - A classic definition of the IPA style. A great beer that I will definitely be having again."
"D: This is a tasty IPA, lower in alcohol makes having multiple in a sitting easy."
"Pours a crisp golden amber with foamy white half inch head. Very inviting. Nose is a bombardment of citrus, grapefuit some slight pine and hidden beyond a caramel malt backbone. Sip reveals a wonderfuly blended IPA, hop forward bitterness and strong maltiness mixed in. Bitterness stays into the finish which ends dry. Medium bodied and smooth mouthfeel. Excellent drinkability and about perfect ABV. A strong offering on the classic from Stone."
"Very easy drinker. Especially when found on tap :D"
"I would not consider this offering to be ""over-the-top"" for an IPA as is Bell's ""Two-Hearted"". But it does somehow just miss the mark for what I prefer. I think the presence of PINE is overdone."
"In the world of IPAs, this is definitely up there w/ the best, you can argue it's the benchmark. Classic IPA, classic example of the style. Highly recommended."
"One of my first IPA's that I actually enjoyed. This IPA seemed to hit a good balance of malt/hop that alot of IPA's are missing. The aroma and taste were amazing. But I found myself only wanting to drink one. I would like to try this again on tap to see if it tastes differently."
"22 oz bottle on my desk. i drank the first half with a big smile on my face. i have some rory gallagher playing in the backround with some great slide work on his guitar as i pour my second glass, good times. great taste for my palate with all the strait forward hop aroma and taste, overall a good beer i will purchase again soon and a good first beer to reveiw."
"Poured on-tap at the Stone Brewery. The beer is bright golden, more towards a lager than most IPAs. There was no significant head. There was a spice (pepper?) and hop smell to the beer; green and sweet at the same time. Tastes of pine and hops on first taste, somehow balanced with a sweet base. The beer is smooth and full bodied in mouth, with a smooth finish. Surprisingly, there are sour notes to the aftertaste and finish. Fairly easy to drink, but the sour tones make it hard to drink multiples in one sitting."
"A good beer with no freshness date."
"Very solid IPA."
"Medium bodied, lower carbonation. Bitter lingering finish..."
"Pretty light(malt) IPA with amazing hop characteristics Pretty easy to drink and leaves a nice astringency so you constantly want more. I drink this on tap a lot at a local English pub."
"Nice mostly clear amber/tan hue when poured. Pretty frothy head on top that leaves a lot of lace. The smell is mostly floral with a lot of pine. It goes down very well with a less dominant flavor (mostly pine and nice hopes) than expected from the smell. There is a nice bite as well. All around a very drinkable IPA that is one of my favorites."
"D: Good. Goes down easy."
"D: This is good as it gets for drinkability in an IPA. Nothing too overpowering and it's light."
"About as highly drinkable as possible for a brew of this ABV. I've had it many times before finally reviewing it and it was a bit surprising to be reminded that the ABV is 6.9%"
"Dark honey color. Not too much head but there was some lacing. Some piney, and floral hops in the nose. Tastes have some tart citrus and piney flavor. Also some sweet bready malt. Light to medium body and fairly dry. Nice IPA."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. The pour is light, clear orange with a sticky 2 finger white head and poillows of lace. It has a big citrus and tropical fruit aroma. The first sip is great, pine, grapefruit and some papaya. It has a lingering bitter finish. The body is medium, nice carbonation. A great IPA, drinks like a bigger beer."
"D - Definitely enjoyed this beer, would like to have it again for sure."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a decently sized white head. It very slowly receded to a foam on top of the beer leaving a little bit of lacing. The nose is mostly hoppy with some citrus as well. The taste starts with hops and grapefruit and finishes with a hoppy bitterness with a little bit of breadiness. It has a medium mouthfeel with average carbonation. The taste is great and this is an enjoyable beer to drink but at 6.9% you should be a little more wary of how much you have enjoyed."
"Great moderate carbonation, nice slightly slick mouthfeel."
"12 oz bottle poured into a nonic pint glass. A nice golden orange body with 2 fingers of head leaving lots of sticky lacing throughout consumption. Lots of hop aromas in the nose, both floral and pine, even some citrus coming through. Great tasting IPA, all kinds of pine / citrus / floral / earthy flavors are prominent on the tongue. Not tasting much of the malt bill on the tongue at all (which is fine by me), really fresh tasting with a nice bitter finish. Medium bodied, average carbonation, perhaps slightly dry but nothing overwhelming. Really solid IPA by the people at Stone."
"All around solid IPA, nothing jumping out at me, the alcohol's well-concealed. This could easily be a repeat taster, though I after maybe three I'd probably have reached my limit. Not incredible, but very decent."
"All in all, a highly recommended IPA."
"D - This is exactly how I imagine a west coast IPA should be! Very drinkable."
"Pours a golden yellow color with 3 fingers of creamy head. The floral hop aroma is noticeable without even lifting the glass to my nose. Upon closer smell, there is a lush bouquet of floral, lemon and grapefruit hops. Hop bitterness right off the bat over a sweet malt backbone leading to a very bitter, slightly oily finish that is quite lingering. Body is medium and drinkability is OK, hurt by a bitterness that boarders on harsh. I know that's Stone's thang, but I think this would be an exceptional IPA if they toned down the bitterness just a touch."
"O: This is one killer IPA that focuses on hops, hops, and more hops. The malt does just enough to balance out the hops and make this one drinkable brew. Definitely a top-tier IPA"
"beautiful beer, has that perfect amber color, almost orange, and just looks like quality. Smells like hops and tastes the same. Huge hop taste up front and yields to a dry, hoppy finish. Great beer, maybe a little too big for my taste as an everyday beer but who knows, I could really see myself growing a taste for this beer."
"Taste is medium hoppy and the citrus floral thing is going on also. This is a very easy to drink beer. Five years ago I would have given this really high marks. There are so many IPA's out there now that this one is above average but not THE best."
"Not that they need more reinforcement for what they do, but +1 Stone. Find me a flaw in this one, and I'll drink Bud light for the rest of my life."
"M: Quite smooth for a medium bodied beer. Finish has a certain drying effect because of all those hop oils. Quite good here."
"politicsandbeer.com"
"Drink - Another one of Stone's beer that I really enjoyed. It is a really hoppy/citrus based IPA that isn't too sweet - which I like. It's a must try for all the IPA fans out there."
"Drinkability: This is heavy stuff. It isn't for tte faint of heart when it comes to drinking IPA's. This is a strong IPA. I couldn't drink too many of these in a row but it leaves such a satisfying aftertaste that sticks around."
"Stone IPA has a nice orange colour and a good 1cm head that that fades to sparse lacing after about 3 mins. It smells faintly of hops, citrus and yeast. Very hoppy up front with some bitterness. The aftertaste is metallic and slightly bitter. This beer is watery in the mouth. This beer is ok, but get the Arrogant Bastard instead if you want something hoppy from Stone."
"D - Not a bitter as I expected; lots of hype for Stone, I thought I was going to get a heavy hit of flavor; I could definitely sit at the bar and drink a few and recommend it to others who enjoy a light IPA"
"D: Very nice ipa to have around. Solid stock beer from stone."
"This is an IPA that I really enjoy and I revisit it from time to time. I think it is a fairly session-able IPA, though the hop bitterness might crush a palate after a few bottles."
"fairly creamy mouthfeel that makes me desire more carbination overall."
"Very drinkable, easily my go to ipa."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is just over light bodied with quite a bit of fine carbonation. Overall, a good IPA that I buy pretty often when I get the chance to get it fresh. I would prefer more fruitiness and a little less bitterness, but it is very refreshing in the end."
"All around a very solid IPA, very bitter, but still retaining some balance. Awesomely drinkable. Will pick this one up again."
"D - For me, this is just a little too bitter to be a ""session"" beer, but I could easily have a second."
"D - A bitter IPA, but it gets better and better as you work your way through it. After finishing, I cannot wait to have another."
"A tasty beer. Balance, flavour, aroma are all really great."
"Pours golden / cloudy orange. Nice long lasting white head. Nose is piney hops, some citrus. Taste is piney hops, citrus with some malt sweetness. Palate is medium body, good carboantion, with a nice crisp mouthfeel. Finish is dominated by citrusy hops with some light malty notes. Overall a very nice well balanced IPA."
"D: Overall as always an absolute chore to drink. I love hop bombs but this is nowhere near that. I really don't see why this beer gets so much praise."
"Excellent IPA. I have to place it up there with 90 Minute (Dogfish Head) even though 90 Minute is a DIPA. Love the bitters, love the aroma. For me it loses to 90 Minute on palate and finish. I think the higher alcohol content gives 90 Minute the fullness on the palate that the thinner Stone IPA just can't do. But the higher carbonation of the Stone IPA gives adds a touch to keep it close."
"I really like this, and I'm not just saying that out of my mad love for Stone!"
"Very carbonated, but still fairly easy to drink. I generally like my IPAs with just a little more malt balance but understand this is a hoppy west coast version. But I do appreciate the hoppiness of this beer."
"An above average IPA from Stone, and a pretty good example of the style."
"Pours a hazy deep golden color with a thick eggshell head. The aroma has a blast of citrusy and piney hops initially, along with some biscuit and cane sugar notes, grapefruit, esters and some alcohol The flavor is incredibly fresh, with huge grapefruit and piney notes upfront, orange marmalade, biscuit and caramel notes, with just a slight alcohol bite. The mouthfeel is light but not watery, and drinkability is excellent. This is the benchmark IPA, especially when it's fresh and on tap."
"Drinkability is good, pretty drinkable for sweetness with dry finish, no real booze, but a slight sticky finish."
"Excellent brew from Stone. Very tasty with a great aroma and mouthfeel. Drinkability scores low because it is 6.9% abv, not because it is difficult to finish."
"I poured into a pint glass to three fingers of off white head. The beer is golden amber in color. I got some yeast on the final pour. The aroma is led by lemon with some other citrus characters following. I was surprised by how muted they were. The taste begins with the lemon citrus and is overwhelmed by piny bitterness. The bitterness lingers for a bit leaving me wanting more. I prefer the mid-western ipa's, but this isn't bad for the bitter west coast style. It's a little on the bitter side for me, but that's exactly what they are going for."
"D- pretty damn drinkable. 6.9 per cent is very well hidden, and i could easily have a few in an evening."
"Serving type: bottle"
"(D)- I can see how this can be a good IPA, but it would be nice to see how it is fresh since I am unable to find it as such in either IL or WI where I have gone."
"D - Overall a fine example of a West Coast IPA. Great showpiece for american hops but still well balanced and not overdone, so the other flavors and aromas can really be noticed"
"D - Drinks great for the hophead. Very drinkable if you like a true IPA, it might be a little over the top at first but not for me. Very great rich classic og drinking IPA with balanced notes. Thumbs WAY UP!!"
"D- Great tasting IPA. Probably one of the best I've tried in my exploratory journey. Hidden ABV and flavorful, crisp taste make this one stand out among the others."
"D - Drinkability is great. I can drink these all night and not get bored with the flavor. This beer goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more. I like it because it showcases hops more than a lot of other IPAs out there. I think stone did a good job on this one. Cheers"
"drinkability - huge hop profile and very flavorful, hop complexity, easy to drink for 6.9 abv, a go to IPA, also Stone kicks ass for having best by dates on their beers"
"Drinkabilty-One of the best IPA's I've tasted. Not overly bitter or oily but full of flavor. Gotta try it if you see it."
"Cracked the bottle. Poured a golden color with a nice foamy head. Great lacing throughout. Smells of citrus and pine. Lemon taste with a nice hop pop, not overbearing though. A really good beer with a slight carbonation to hold on the tongue, very drinkable. Enjoyable, would be great with a steak and potato."
"D - excelllent drinkability refreshing love this beer one of the best IPAs out there"
"nice citrusy IPA"
"This is a corner""stone"" IPA."
"Got to be one of my least favorite IPAs. If you are forced to drink this against your will, I would suggest letting it warm way up. I drank the second half of the bomber at damn near room temperature, and it was much more palatable that way. I have had more than one of these, but I bought this bomber specifically to review it. Won't be buying anymore in the future. It's not all Stone's fault; there is some STEEP competition out here on the west coast. Just goes to show that any gorilla can dump a truck load of hops into the brewing vat. It takes an artist to carefully choreograph the delicate balance that makes a beer truly great."
"Cheers!"
"My lowest scored IPA of the night (under Jai Alai, Alesmith, Sculpin, Columbus, Furious, Two Hearted, Founders Centennial, and Red Racer)"
"D: Excellent, a crisp refreshing IPA."
"D - Oh yes. Very tasty with that lovely finish that is actually a bit warming. Easy to down and would be wonderful to session. Good competition for 60-Minute in that respect."
"D: Very drinkable for a hophead."
"Light bodied beer is nice enough to drink."
"D- Very drinkable, absolutely lovely. I've been waiting to try this and now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long. A very good IPA, a very good beer."
"D - Its light enough to drink all night, but be careful because it hides its alcohol well."
"I'm surprised about this beer, to be quite honest. Stone has done a solid job of creating a good IPA here, without going too far."
"Very drinkable, and highly recommended."
"Pale golden color, with a lovely white head with good lacing. Very bold citrus and pine, with a good sweet malt balance. Leaves a wonderfully dry finish, making you crave more. A great all around IPA that is enjoyable all year round"
"Drinkability is good. This wouldn't be a great session beer due to the higher ABV, but it goes down smooth and I would definitly have it again. I will have to try some more brews by Stone Brewing Company."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, I agree that this is one of the finer examples of the style. A true classic American IPA!"
"This is a great IPA drinkability is perfect. This beer is one everyone needs to try at least once. I myself tend to return to this one quite often."
"d- overall a very nice beer and must have for ipa fans"
"overall, great beer, i will buy this again to switch up the routine, highly recommended"
"Good moutfeel and aftertaste. Overall a great beer."
"This is a really good IPA. I like it better than Sierra Nevada personally. It has this large bouquet that lingers."
"Crisp and easily drinkable if you like the style, this is a great beer. But for the price I can get other things that I like a lot more as well."
"Outstanding, almost perfect IPA."
"Drinkability: I can see why this IPA regularly gets high marks. This is definitely a well-made beer that fits the style nicely. I have had this one before, am enjoying this one as each sip easily follows the one before. I certainly expect I'll be choosing this beer again in the future."
"D - This drinks great as an IPA, and all you hopheads out there like myself remember this is an IPA, not a double or imperial, and for the category it's in it is an awesome beer!"
"12oz bottle. Pours a hazy yellow with a large head. Lots of lacing throughout. Wonderful aroma. Blend of citrus, hops, pine but no one aroma more powerful than the other. Taste is bitter with a citrus flavor to it. Good amount of hoppiness as well. Lots of flavor to this IPA. Not overly drinkable but can be consumed at a good clip."
"Attractive, great-smelling, very tasty American IPA. It's orange with a head that fell pretty quickly but left nice lacing, and smells of wonderful citrusy hops. It tastes of them too, although the finish gets a bit piney/spicy, and has a light, clean mouthfeel with vigorous carbonation that you can't help but enjoy. This is a reliable beer, nothing particularly unique, but perfectly crafted and a must-have for IPA fans."
"The rindy/melon taste kind makes the flavor profile kind of distracting in my personal opinion. This is a beer I've had many times but is definitely not my favorite from stone. Give me a Ruination or SSR over their standard IPA any day when I'm looking for some hops."
"Drinkability: Alcohol hidden, like all great IPA. I do not know why I keep excellent high gravity beers on tap at the house.... glutton for punishment."
"D: it drank quite well but was kind of dissapointed on the hop profile and bitter punch that was lacking especially coming from the arrogant bastards. This IPA was a west coast hop let down."
"Drinkabilty - Very high. This is near perfect unless i wanna go hop heavy, then i move up to ruination or such. You can drink 3-4 of these no problem. I always keep a six pack handy. One of the best ipa's out."
"A good IPA, but nothing too special. I would recommend this, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. It's readily available though, so bombs away!"
"Drinkability: I could drink these all day long, but at 6.9% it would hit the head after a few. Absolutely a joy to drink"
"Overall, one of my new favorite IPAs. This along with Smuttynose's IPA are going to be my go tos for the style. I'm surprised I took so long to try this out given that Ruination IPA is one of my favorites. Definitely do yourself a service and give this beer a try!"
"D - Infinitely drinkable, this is one of the standard-bearers for American IPAs. Amazing beer, amazing brewery!"
"An above average IPA for me with excellent presentation and drinkable because of it's restraint with the alcohol and flavor characteristics."
"pretty drinkable, but high enough abv that i really feel it after 2 of these. To me the epitome of west coast ipas and probably should be on everyone's beers to try list. i'm pretty sure this set the standard at one point, but there are certainly more exciting examples of the style out there."
"Great beer to represent the American IPA style, bold hoppy flavor and boozy weighing in just shy of 7% ABV. Not a beer to session but goes well with spicy food and it's my go to for the over $10 sixer category."
"D: Great drinkability. This beer tastes pretty good and goes down easy."
" This beer is not meant to be a ballanced IPA and focuses purly on the bitter. There are some hints of almost citrusy flavors but they are wiped away almost instantly by the taste of hops and even more hops."
"Pours a beautiful pale golden-orange color and offers a dense, thick head that fades slowly, leaving plenty of lacing and a thin persistent head. Aroma bursting with hops, namely citrus, pine, and grass aromas. A wonderfully balanced flavor with just enough malt to stand up the hops, and little alcohol detectable. Overall highly drinkable, and an outstanding example of the American West Coast's world-class IPAs."
"In the quest to try every beer on the planet one often forgets about the easy to find and cheaper offerings. Well IPA lovers...there is no better staple. There is no beer I come back to as often and trust me I've got about 40 different beers in the fridge...this one will be bought again before all of those are even sampled."
"For what it's worth, Stone IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale are the two stalwarts of the American IPA / Pale Ale class. Stone is a very drinkable IPA that is great for both hopheads and casual beer drinkers alike. Even if you are not a big fan of ""hopped up"" beers, this is still a must try."
"Serving type: bottle"
"First of all i love the label and spiels on the back of these bottles just stoked to be able to be drinking a brew from Stone,it pours a non see through tangello hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a nice two finger head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is nearly spot on with hints of pine resin,marmalade,passionfruit and lychee,it has a pleasant medium bodied mouthfeel which is lightly sticky and leaves you with tastes of passionfruit,tangerines,grapefruit,some light toffee malts and finishes with a tiny bitter tinge basically a perfectly balanced beer in my eyes that i could drink all night if given the chance and will definately revisit this fine drop."
"D - Very good drinkability, 6.9% isn't too high, but definitely not ""sessionable."" Not so bitter that it will ruin your palate for the night, not too sweet to give you a headache after drinking one."
"D- A very solid example of an IPA. To be honest, it's working it's way towards a double IPA. Very easy to down, and considerably hoppy. Would definitely get it again. More grapefruity than most though."
"The beer pours a hazy light amber color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of various hops, but is a little bit faint. I get some orange citrus, pine and flowery notes. The flavor is more assertive, with notes of pithy oranges and some caramel malt. The bitterness is about medium and just about right for a regular American IPA. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. A very good IPA."
"Slight touch of haze in this deep yellow brew with bright orange hints throughout. Pretty fluffy head that reduces as expected, but manages to stick around a while. More of a floral secondary to citrusy hop notes in the nose. There's a good bit of hops in the nose and the taste. There's quite a bit of bready malts coming through as well. More of a citrus forward taste leaning toward grapefruit with only hints of pine. I found this to be very well balanced (what can I say, I like lots of hops.) Certainly finishes cleaner than Stone's bigger beers, but is great for the style. Not my favorite of the style, but right up there with the best of them."
"Bomber served cold into a chilled pint glass. A moderate pour gives a nice 1"" of frothy off-white head on top of this semi-cloudy golden brew. The smell is a strong resiny pine hop, some mild florals and a bit of sweet light malt. The taste has an interesting body of tannins and a secondary malt sweetness that support a moderate dose of the sticky pine and florals detected in the smell. The earthy astringent tannin and bitter hop blend well together, tieing the body cleanly to the hop for a rounded full taste. The feel is perhaps a bit on the light side of moderately thick, with appropriate soft carbonation. Tasty. Lace lingers on the glass through the session."
"D: Extremely enjoyable. Very easy to drink."
"The mouthfeel is perfect, especially for an IPA. It's visually effervescent, but on the mouth it's incredibly smooth and silky. Almost like a porter or stout. The carbonation is barely noticeable on the tongue. Drinkability is noticeably high - definitely can have a couple more glasses of this delectable IPA. My first glass was finished in a matter of minutes due to its incredible taste and mouthfeel. This IPA is underrated!"
"Stone IPA is one of the best I have had the pleasure of enjoying. In my book it falls only behind Two Hearted amongest American IPA's. Tremendously enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Pours a hazy, maize color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops (pineapple/grapefruit), sweet malt, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, sweet malt, and slight yeast. Overall, good standard APA - nothing flashy."
"D: Drinkability is average at best for me, I personally prefer some malt and or tropical fruit flavors in my IPAs, but the malt was really lacking. Definition of a West coast IPA for sure."
"Atmosphere is pretty great. Appearance is rich and golden with a giant foamy head that just won't quit. Plenty of persistent sticky lacing. Nose is not complex, but full and floral. Flavor, again, not complex, but full-on hop assault. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"I meant to grab a bottle of Ruination, but grabed a bottle of the Stone IPA, oh well let's give it a shot. Pours out of the bottle golden in color, nice head 1-2 fingers. The head disapears after a few miutes, nice lacing. The smell is wounderful. The hops are INTENSE, but have another sip it keeps growing on you. This is a very hoppy IPA, nice finish, hardly any trace of malt flavor. If you like IPA's and a beer heavy on the hops you have found your beer."
"Pours a perfect orange-gold with only the faintest haze to it, almost no carbonation. Very little head with no retention, and some sticky lacing. Nose opens up with grapefruit and pineapple. Settles into west coast style aroma hoppiness...Flavor is burting out of the gate. Very full and rich for an IPA. Some alcohol in there, and it carries throughout the flavor, but isn't too much. Hops are huge here, and overpower almost all else. Some hints of candied apple, and maybe some vanilla but it's masked amidst the wash of hops. Finish is long and bitter in a good way. Priced well usually, so this is great everyday beer. However, it's the epitome of a West Coast IPA and not super unique at this point."
"This is a very drinkable IPA. There is just the right balance of hops, malt, and fruity notes. Great brew and will surely be having this again when i crave an IPA"
"Super drinkable IPA, and a favorite of mine, especially in terms of availability."
"D: I feel the Stone IPA is overrated. It's a good beer, but not amazing. The hops are fun for a while, but too violent in the beginning of each sip. The 6.9% tells. I wouldn't buy another, but you should try just one."
"M/D: Creamy and smooth, very easy drinking. A great IPA that I could drink everyday."
"Pours a light gold with a solid sustaining head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is very citrusy with a hint of caramel. Really nice hop bitterness comes through, leaving a solid aftertaste as well. Malt is not really apparent in the flavor, which is perfect for my taste. Imo, this is pretty much the paradigmatic west coast IPA: hoppy and delicious."
"We'll see how long it takes me to die during the Leaving Falls Church uber-bender. My guess is not much longer. This co-defendant pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger of white foam, complete with a decent amount of etch-style lacing. The nose comprises plenty o' pine, grapefruit, honeydew, and rich toffee. The taste dilutes the pine up front in a wash of grapefruit, followed by a nice smattering of toffee, but then, in the finish, the pine returns for some always-enjoyed vengeance. The body is fairly light, with a moderate carbonation and a pretty dry and crisp finish. Overall, a very nice, easy-drinkin' IPA. Get some!"
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is good, it's a very well made and flavorful beer. it has a very nice and bright hoppiness to it that is very nice. All that said, for my personal taste I slightly prefer more of the tropical hoppy flavors in an IPA. That doesn't diminish how well made this beer is though at all."
"Bottle. Gold pour with ivory white head. Aroma is heavy pine, a whole coniferous forest's worth. Some sweetness too slightly citrusy or some pineapple. Taste is definately piney and grapefruit with an extra bitter finish. Good sparkling mouthfeel with a bitter dry taste."
"Pours a cloudy dark gold/light amber with a nice white head. Lively aromas of citrusy hops and caramel malts. On the palate this beer becomes positively electric. Lots of orange citrus and (to a lesser extent) pine resin jump right out in front and later linger long on the finish. In between these hop bursts, the mid palate is noticeably sweeter, with honey and caramel flavors. I pick up some floral and grassy notes as it warms. Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation; a definite palate cleanser that will stand up to any food under the sun and is a pleasure to drink."
"Deep yellow in color with a hint of orange and a touch of haze. Decent white head that reduces to a healthy white cap and leaves a trail of sticky lacings on the glass. Soft floral aroma with hints of orange and a faint hint of pine. Medium bodied with lively carbonation and a crisp finish. Like the aroma, floral hoppy flavor with orange in the beginning, a brief sweet malty taste, and a hint of pine at the finish. Nice clean finish that raises the drinkability points as you have a hard time keeping the glass down."
"A nice treat on-tap and it went well with my Thai chicken curry with its floral, citrus and spicy hoppiness and robust pale and light caramel malt backbone. Still, though it has been surpassed by many, it still remains a standard bearer for the style."
"This beer does live up to how good everyone says it is."
"Overall: one of the classic American IPA's one of the first craft beers I ever had about 5 years ago. Great stuff!"
"D: The only complaint I have about this beer is the hops. They seem much too herbal to me. Like one of my mom's homoeopathic concoctions."
"Any IPA fan will not be upset by this beer."
"D- Very solid beer from Stone. Wouldn't expect anything less from them. Not the best one I'd ever had, but a pretty damn good one."
"This is a well crafted brew certainly deserving of its reverence . A perfect example of what an IPA should taste like."
"D-this is a well balanced IPA that has malt flavors really complimenting the big hop presence. everything compliments each other so well, it has the complexity you want but the hop bomb and bitterness you need."
"22oz. bottle served in my SA Sensory Pint. Poured a pale orange-gold with a slightly hazy clarity. A creamy/frothy, one inch bright white head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap with some thick swaths and strands of lacing adhering to the sides of the glass. Nose reveals grapefruit and resinous hops notes with a trace of caramel or toffee in the background. Flavor profile is very well balanced - some citrus astringency at the start, a little bitterness at the middle and towards the back (not as piny as suggested by the nose) and a light biscuity presence. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation that falls shy of prickly but leaves a residual tingle on the tongue after each quaff. Astringency lightly stimulates the salivary glands. A very solid and drinkable IPA with great balance. Doesn't overly assert itself in one direction which greatly accentuates the drinkability."
"Libation: I like this beer, but frankly I expected a whole lot more based upon reputation. It's a bitter IPA, I get that, but I'm just not getting the complexity that warrants the bitterness. I think there are better options out there in terms of delivering an interesting/complex flavor profile, which this doesn't."
"Stone remains one of the best breweries anywhere, IMO. Every beer I've had from this brewery is great."
"Overall- this is your classic west coast ipa. not unbalanced but definitly hop forward. hops are not overwelming but stick around just long enough to keep you going back for more!"
"It is thick and has a nice body without being syrup. The finish is fantastic, and I can't stop drinking it. I could drink this all day, but alas I have to go in to work, for at least a few more days before they finally hand me the exit."
"D- its a toss up between this and two hearted for my go to IPA. i usually settle for whatever one is on sale. sometimes with green flash's west coast IPA. glad this one made it here. also glad they list the freshness information on the bottle. every IPA should have that."
"Highly recommend this IPA as the Gargoyle emblem has definitely protected the hops from evil spirits that can ruin a good beer."
"Prost!!!"
"Edited 7/17/11: Doesn't quite pack the same hop punch for me now that it used to. Still hoppy and flavorful, but the alcohol seems more prominant to me now than it did the last time I had it, thus had to lower scores a little bit. Scores changed to reflect updates."
"Review #2"
"drinks rather well. You have to have a decent hop tolerance to enjoy this one, but if you do it will satisfy your hop fix very easily."
"Got a sixer, it's Friday, and I'll definitely easily drink a few."
"Edit: also had it on tap had to change the taste up a few notches."
"M & D - Crisp, medium body, refreshing and delicious. Great solid offering form Stone."
"D: I've had this on tap and in bottle several times, trying to get into this beer, with all the hype around it. I've been disappointed every time. I doubt it's a freshness problem (having it fresh out of a new keg), I am trying to like this, but there are too many other good IPAs out there to give it another chance. The only Stone product I never plan on buying anytime soon."
"Overall, a solid IPA, representative of what Stone does with hops."
"One of the tastiest and boldest regular (non DIPA) IPAs you can get your hands on. Easily stands next to Ruination without any questions."
"Medium bodied and crisp. Satisfies without kicking your ass."
"Drinkability - Surprisingly easy to drink and a great beer for an introduction to IPAs. Not as many complex flavors as some others but a great everyday IPA. My initial thought when drinking this beer is that it falls short in comparison to other more complex IPAs but then I found myself unable to put this beer down."
"Drinkability: a very good beer that i could have plent of"
"I do not understand all the A ratings. This was worth the price and I would buy this again. However, this seemed like a fairly standard, yet solid, IPA. I like Stone, but this one was just okay."
"D: Good, clean IPA. Would have this again - could be a session beer for me. A simple and yummy IPA. love."
"Pours orange-gold with a 1 finger frothy white head. Nice grapefruit and slight sweetness in the aroma. Excellent flavor of grapefruity, piny hops with just enough malt to balance but still let the hops shine. Nice smooth medium body. This is an excellent example of what and IPA should be."
"Much better hop aroma and taste out of the bottle, scores going up"
"A tasty beer. I like it."
"DB- I remember this one being a lot fruitier but that was a while ago. A good beer for sure with a nice hop and malt presence. Refreshing at a good price."
"D - A good everyday, drink a few after supper kind of IPA. One hell of a brew!"
"d - A very nice IPA. Had it many times and is a definite go to for me. Will have again."
"d-very good. need to have the other stone ipas now to compare the whole bunch! a very solid ipa."
"I don't know why I waited this long to try this beer, but I finally decided to pick this up on a trip to Buffalo yesterday. Pours a golden-yellow with a huge white head. Lace is all over the glass. Beautiful. Has lots of hops in the nose - herbal, pine and grassy, maybe some citrus too. I can smell some bready type malt too. Flavour is bursting with hops, nice level of bitterness. Some malt backbone here too, well balanced. A really good drinking IPA, I'd buy lots of this if I didn't have to drive to Buffalo to get it."
"D: the drinkability is good"
"Hell yeah!"
"D: the drinkability is good. I could easily have a few glasses of this brew and not be disapointed"
"D- Probably the worst aspect, but certainly not bad for the style."
"Wow, this one did not disappoint. The smell was an intoxicating mix of hops and citrus. Exactly what I look for in an IPA. I will seek out a six pack of this on my next trip to the store."
"Great IPA in its own class, more aggressively bitter than most with a decidedly more herbal/floral profile. This beer reminded me more of De Ranke XX Bitter and Orval, to some extent, than most other US brewed IPAs. Kick ass!"
"D- Stone IPA is the west coast ipa that sets the bar. The brew is so drinkable and enjoyable. It has a delicious mix of flavor and bitterness in the brew that is a can't miss. I really enjoy downing this brew"
"I like this beer a lot, one of the better IPA's I have had, will definitely add this one to my rotation of beer. Not as hoppy as other IPA's a very smooth beer and very drinkable. I had this in a 12 ounce bottle poured into a glass at home. I definitely recommend this one."
"I think it would be better if the finish wasn't so dry"
"Been a while since I had one of these. Grabbed 1 for a 12 pack sampler of my choice, was going to save it for my b-day Party in August, but it fell out of the Fridge, and it started hissing at me...well, better drink it now :-)~ Poured into my Great Lakes Pilsner glass, Translucent yellow/orange. 2 inch White foamy head. What a freekin' smooth IPA. Less hops than other IPA's, but balanced in every way. smells like Grapefruit. Wonderful malt sweetness on the back, with a dry hop finish. I won't be wasting my time with 1 freekin' beer next time. Better than I remember it."
"Love this as a one beer treat, and can also drink it all night long."
"D- This beer is pretty drinkable if you like IPA's and would make a good session beer for IPA fans. Overall this beer is a classic IPA."
"The drinkability is key for this beer, as I could have myself a lot in one session and not feel bowled-over by it."
"Pours a cloudy, straw-orange color with somewhat large white head. Extremely hoppy aroma with a bit of sweet malts. Very strong citrusy notes (orange, grapefruit, lemon). The taste is very well balanced. Up front you get great citrus hoppiness, followed by sweet citrus fruits. Then it ends with bittering hops. Very lovely taste. The mouthfeel is almost perfect for an IPA. The drinkability is very high for this 7% gem."
"All in all, certainly a benchmark. Enough exotic aromas to make it stand out and everything else certainly does it's part. A fine brew indeed."
"D. I could definitely have a couple of these after a long day at work and fall asleep nicely. A little strong to be a session beer but not a bad choice to keep one or two (22's) in the fridge."
"D- lowish abv and tons of flavor makes for a great beer. I tend to over look this one for bigger newer thing but this. Is a classic for a reason."
"A good solid IPA from stone, but wants to grow up to be the Runition IPA, as this is a far superior IPA from the same company, and worth every penny! The regular Stone IPA has an average amount of hoppiness/bittering, but not overwhelming. Consistency is very light, and the flavors will not blow you away. All in all it is rather forgetable, and does not compare the to the other IPA's by Stone."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a cap of suddsy white head. Ok retention and spotty clumps of lacing. Great whiff of citrus and tropical fruits along with touched of floral, piney and earthy hops. Faint biscuity sweetness in the nose. Taste is a big rush of bitterness, mostly piney and earthy hops in the taste with a background presence of floral, citrus and tropical flavors. A solid, lightly sweet biscuty background as well. Medium bodied, good carbonation, smooth and almost creamy. A good all around IPA from Stone."
"I wish this was available here in Alberta I would have less money but would be drinking great beer, try this if you can"
"Drinkability -- This is the Stone offering that I have passed on over and over. While it didn't fully live up to my expectations, I am still glad I went with this. Great balance, very refresing, but the mouthfeel and appearance left a little to be desired."
"cheers!"
"If I had any critique of the beer it would be , its very , two dimensional, there isn't so many little things going on with this beer. Hops and malt. It a nice, bold, straightforward IPA, maybe explore more into the depth of flavor. Why fix something that isn't broke. In my fridge at all the times."
"Golden pour with an initially thick head. Smells strongly of cascade and floral hops and sweet citrus grapefruit. Taste is initially of bitter hops with some lighter flower tones. It then morphs into a citrus grapefruit flavor. The final stage is a cascading plunge of bitterness culminating in a wave of intense hops in the aftertaste. Palate is somewhat thick and syrupy. A very excellent IPA. As Ludwig Wittgenstein once said, ""I turn to stone"" -- now who could deny the taste continues?"
"A: Good head retention, head is thick and cottony while laying flat, noticeable spotting along the interior of the glass, light to medium straw in color with some minor sediment visible - 4.50, S: Strong aromas of juicy fruit gum, quite floral and citrusy with a lemon zest, very nice hop aromas that dominate the nose - 4.50, T: Malts provide a solid caramel base, a sharp grapefruit bite that is most noticeable on the very tail end of the beer, quite a bit of herbal spiciness if that is at all possible, all around a solid American IPA - 4.25, M: Slight zing to the mouth feel, medium bodied - 4.00, D: A very nicely crafted IPA, good balance and an excellent representation of the style - 4.50"
"Drinkabiliuty: Being from Stone, I expected this to be an assault of hops. However, this is hoppy but also has a very pleasant, balancing malt character. A great IPA."
"D: Very drinkable. This is a great beer to get a sixer of; it's priced reasonably for the quality, and I can stop at one bottle if I choose. Definitely on regular rotation in my fridge."
"Overall, I'd say this is the gold standard in American IPAs. Hoppy as hell, but in the nicest way possible. A must have for all the hopheads out there."
"D - Fairly easily drinkable based on what I've heard about the bitterness. It makes me wonder how old this bottle is. Regardless, Stone's IPA blends potent hops with a good malty backbone well."
"poured from 12oz bottle into chilled pint glass,still my go to ipa,alesmith & racer 5 close seconds,stone has that hop bite and full mouthfeel that satisfies completely!! still want to try pliny the elder,and bells two hearted ale....thank god for craft beer!!!!"
"D - A good IPA but not a favourite. I really want to try this one again because the second half of my pint was very, very good but the first half was too bitter. Overall, review is based on the second half and I really enjoyed it."
"Searing and just barely palatable grapefruit pith bitterness. Just enough bready malt to give hops purchase. This whole beer is just soaked in hop oils and it really adds to the mouthfeel. Just what I would expect from a SoCal IPA."
"BOTTLE"
"Finally getting around to reviewing one of my favorite IPAs. Pours a translucent, bright orange / ever-so-light copper, with a pillowy, cotton white head. A few patches stick to the glass as I down this delicious hop nectar. Smell is a touch piney, but more grassy / earthy / peppery - to me, at least. There are some floral notes in there, too. Taste is more citrusy, with grapefruit rind being pretty noticeable - there is some piney-ness, too. Caramel malt is there, but this beer is definitely hop-forward. Mouthfeel is just about perfect to me. It could use a little more body, but that might deter it from being so drinkable. The finish is crisp, clean and refreshing. I wouldn't consider the IPA as a highly drinkable style, but this is a highly drinkable IPA, for sure!"
"A beer for hopheads. Either handle the intensity or bow out politely. I like it. I like it substantially more with spicy food."
"Drinkability- I blew through the 22oz and could have inbibed in another. They should make 40ozs."
"Final Notes: An excellent beer to pair against a nice spicy meal or for refreshment on a hot day. Absolutely delicious."
"D - A great beer that I'd drink again without a doubt."
"Enjoy it on the porch at sundown, after a nice spliff."
"D: Unfortunately, because of the strong hoppy taste, I wouldn't be able to drink a 6 pack of this beer. It was very enjoyable to have one or two though."
"... lol."
"So, yes, this Stone IPA is an amazing, exemplary beer. But no need to stop the presses--puppies are cute, the sun will rise tomorrow, and everything is as it should be."
"this is one of the better ipas out there, and if it wasnt for the price, id be drinking it a lot more. stone is, in my opinion, one of the most quality breweries, from there insane big beers, to there average simple beers and it shows in this beer. went very well with some philadelphia bbq sushi rolls with some wasabi. highly recommended from me is that means anything to you."
"Big Citrus Hops smell. The taste follows. Citrus hops, mostly grapefruit and orange. A hint of malt mixes well with the hops. Finishes with nice big hop kick and a tad dry. A lot of flavor here and a very well done IPA, one of the best I've ever tried."
"Midnight Brewers"
"All in all, not as impressive as the Cali-Belgique version of this same beer. Belgian yeast, woo!"
"D. Quite a good IPA offering from Stone but having sampled the Ruinition a little earlier made this somewhat harder to drink. I would have really enjoyed this more if I had tried it before the Ruinition. Still a very good beer in my opinion."
"I generally like IPAs--Dogfish Head 60 minute, Great Divide Titan IPA, Bell's Two Hearted, Great Lakes Erie Monster--but this was just too hoppy for me. The appearance is nice, and the smell is very floral and complex with plenty of dry hopping. Unlike the aforementioned IPAs, though, there's no notable malt sweetness, perhaps just enough to make the beer palatable (but not enjoyable). While the bitterness doesn't dry out your mouth, it comes close. If you're totally obsessed with hops or just want something extreme, you might like this beer."
"I'm more ambivalent about Stone than most of the BA reviewers, I think, I'm not necessarily a fan of overpowering beers but in the case of an IPA, I enjoy and appreciate it provided that it isn't oversweetened and overmalted as well. This beer is not, it's a bit thick for a regular IPA in my opinion but the quality of the ingredients come through and the balance is proper for an IPA. This is a fine brew and the best one I've tried from Stone."
"drinkability: Goes down fast. Nice with chicken."
"Pours a pale golden color with a fluffy white head. Leaves a bit of lacing on the side of the glass. Nose is moderatly hoppy, equal parts citrus and pine, slightly sweet. Smells nice. Fairly aggressive bitterness with slight hop citrus, lingering bitter aftertaste. Slightly above average taste. I have had better, have had worse. Mouth is pretty full for the style, helps carry the hops well. Overall, a good, solid IPA. There are better IPAs to be had for less money, but sometimes Stone's signature flavors just hit the spot."
"Overall: I love it! Had this many times and it's always good, even in the bottle. Stone does a really nice job with their QC - this is even a few weeks past the best buy date. Compared to other top shelf American IPA's this is fairly bold but quite balanced. It shows a lot of hop character without getting into the grassy, vegetal, harsh resin realm that some approach. Some that push the envelope a bit more are more tasty and complex but this is extremely enjoyable and great drinking. Wonderful balance."
"pours a cloudy copper orange color with good white frothy head and good lacing. Almost overwhelming citrus piney hop smell. taste is much the same . very bitter as expected. some grass like and lemon hints. light body with a thin slick texture. Average carbonation and average flavor duration. moderate bitter finish."
"D - Another one of a kind, big, bold Stone brew. The grassy/black pepper notes I was getting from the smell really keeps me from drinking too much of this at any one time, although it was mighty tasty and surprisingly complex."
"D- I'm not really sure about this...I've had IPAs I've enjoyed more, and because of how bitter this is, I'm not sure if I'd come back to it. I don't get many flavors aside from the pine, and its a huge turnoff to me."
"D- Too hopped out for my tastes, can't even finish one of these bad boys. I might revisit and finish one to get the full Stone IPA experience."
"Drinkability - This is by far the best IPA I have ever had."
"D - Pretty easy drinking IPA. I enjoy this one and would drink it again but wouldn't go crazy trying to find it."
"Just finished a HopDevil prior to this and I have to say this was a great exercise in how different (but still delicious) American IPA's can be. If HopDevil is the quintessential East Coast IPA, then Stone is it's West Coast counterpart. Just as I said of HopDevil I'll say of Stone IPA, it's readily available and relatively affordable so if you haven't had it - what the hell are you waiting for?"
"o - far from a hop bomb, but quite good. would enjoy having again."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a white, patchy, head. First whiff is pure IPA kindness, very pronounced hops on the nose. First taste is the same. The hops are the star, but let the other flavors act as good support. Pineapple, grapefruit, and sweet malts. Outstanding beer. Nicely balanced. Feel is nicely complex, creamy and smooth, but with a daggered hops edge. Doesn't finish as dry as I expected. High drinkability."
"Looks, smells and tastes like an IPA. Nice beer. There are better out there. I liked it. I think if everyone tasted this blind -- without knowing who made it -- they might just find it a good competent IPA. I think the Stone reputation here has more to do with the high rating than actually tasting it objectively."
"D - just a fantastic, mellow IPA"
"D - one of the best IPA's to eat with spicy food, this is a classic that often gets overlooked yet its still at the top. wonderfully hoppy yet drinkable, hard to only have one."
"I quiet enjoyed the beer, the bitterness continued throughout the tasting, even the aftertaste was all hop and no hint of any malt content could i find anywhere within the brew."
"Feels exceptional in the mouth. Smooth, but doesnt stick around too long and the huge hop profile leaves that typical dryness on the walls of your mouth. This is the kind of beer that, for me, deserves an unreasonably high rating. It is pretty much everything I would want in an IPA."
"This is my first review and I,m happy that Was with this beautiful IPA I hope that soon we can get this beer in a better price I buy itt for 7 dls aprox ( the bottle)"
"Poured from a 1 pt. 6 oz. bottle after a long day at work. If you like imperial IPAs, you'll like this one. Forms a good head. Dark coppery color, and a tad murky. Smells good. This beer is very rich, and tastes more like an imperial IPA than just a regular one. It's hearty with a good sweet-bitter balance. Unfortunately not really what I'm usually looking for in an IPA--just a little too intense for casual drinking. It's a tasty ale, very indulgent."
"D: goes down easily. one of my favorite summer IPA's"
"This has good carbonation, but overall, this just isn't my preferred take on an American IPA. There is really not a whole lot of ""taste"" or flavor to this, just huge bitterness. It feels like that was the intent though, so I'm not giving this a negative review. I would prefer a Bell's Two Hearted over this any day of the week."
"I do like the beer, definitely is a quality IPA that I will be drinking when I can, but I do feel some flavors are dominant and you are not able to taste other things in the beer."
"Excellent alternative for those who tire of sweeter IPAs. Some may regard this as one of the gold standards in ""West Coast IPAs"" for that reason."
"pick some up if you're rollin in the dough."
"I actually like this better than Ruination. I feel it has more balance. Top-notch IPA."
"Wow. I'm just starting to appreciate hoppy beers and this is the hoppiest beer I've tried so far. Delicious herbal and pine flavors come through extra strong, incredibly crisp, dry beer..but smooth all at once. Nice head retention. Looking forward to trying other offerings from Stone. If you're into hops, give this one a try!"
"I would personally rate this beer a solid ""D-"" if all there was to consider was what I just drank."
"D: you could knock a sixer of these back in a sitting! The dry finish and the hoppy sensation is quite refreshing. the beer is sweet and full enough to please your palate as well. All around an interesting and good ipa."
"If there was a higher rating than an A+ I would give it to this Beer. The bottled version is astounding. On tap, it's enough to provoke spontaneous combustion."
"Drinkability: West coast ultra hopped tastiness. Not for the faint of palette. It would be natural to think a beer this hoppy would not be drinkable. Stone is insulted by that way of thinking, don't let it happen again."
"This stuff is crazy. It is an IPA that drinks like an DIPA. How do they pack all that flavor into this beer? Stone are masters at their game."
"-Excellent IPA, one of my favorites, highly recommended. Only downside to this is beer is that it tend to be pricey."
"It as a nice white head and the lacing is good, doesn't stick to the entire wall of the glass but certainly lets you know it's there. Definitely a beer that you can drink in large gulps so be careful."
"A good IPA, would try again on draft or a fresher bottle."
"This was a very good IPA just not my favorite. Personally I like more citrus in my IPA. Solid overall. Bottle is 3 months old which may have hurt the hop aroma. Will definitely try again, hopefully a fresher bottle."
"This drinks really easy and is an exceptional IPA."
"I would definitely recommend this beer to fellow craft brew fans and macro brew drinkers alike."
"D - Burned through the first two but slowed as the alcohol caught up to me. This is a strong beer and I felt the need to switch to something lighter. With more experience in craft brews I could learn to appreciate this brew a bit more."
"Poped the cap on a 22oz bottle and shared with a friend. Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours a hazy golden color with a frothy three finger head. The head settles to a film after a few minutes. The smell is a lovely bouquet of hops. There are citrus and grassy notes. The first sip...a nice maltyness that quickly fades to the hops. This beer has a great backbone on it. The beer is hoppy but balanced. The mouth is nice. This beer is pretty much what I look for in an American IPA."
"Drinkability - This is a well balanced IPA and very tasty. I loved it!"
"Drinkability: Yes!"
"D: this is a great IPA, I was so interested in trying all of Stone's extreme offerings first that it took me some time before I gave the IPA a chance, now I'm sorry I waited. This beer is great."
"This is an IPA that I keep in my garage fridge when I find it reasonably priced. It's usually a little more than comparable IPAs. Regardless, it's very drinkable."
"This is one of my favorite everyday beers. The smeel of hops is abundant with hints of herbs, and grapefruit, maybe some fresh cut grass. Taste has full NA hop flavor with a small malt trace. Undoubtly this beer is all about the bitterness. The aftertaste is quite persisting and a strong hop character lingers in the mouth."
"Hell yea it's drinkable, this is my third one tonight! Highly recommended offering from stone if you're looking to grab a sixer of something new or something great."
"Cheers!"
"Goes down very smoothly, although I did start to notice a little alcohol note towards the bottom of the glass. Not enough to put me off, but enough to give me pause and respect for this. Not something I would pound two or three of down in a sitting, but a good opener beer for something a little more sessionable. Just a well crafted IPA from a brewery that I keep discovering really has their sh*t together. I'm so glad this one will now be a regular option at the store."
"Drinkability: Hop heads rejoice... This brew goes very well with spicy Mexican food as hops bite through the burning sensation of the tongue almost nubing the burn... Sip this brew all night with some spicy salsa and chips."
"D: Great for 6.9%. Don't think I could get through more than 22oz, but the hops aren't overwhelming."
"D- Good drinking beer, each drink has so much flavor that it is really a beer you can take your time and savor, though I can't call it my favorite IPA, it is definitely up there and is a beer I will be looking for again in the future."
"This is a good beer but it doesnt leave me running for another one like some IPA's do."
"D - While the hop influence is incredibly strong, this is still a very tasty and drinkable beer. Highly recommended for hop-heads."
"D - It would have to be my go to IPA but now I have to try Arrogant Bastard to see which one is more hoppy!"
"D: very easy to put away, leaving me wishing this was a bomber and not the 12oz bottle that it is."
"For a straight IPA this beer is very hoppy. It is definitely not a great introduction to this style of beer, but is terrific for one who has acquired an appreciation for a delicious hop bouquet."
"D - Nice smooth hoppy beer that is very well balanced. Definatley one of my go to ipa's. Very glad they made it to CT so I can have it on tap. I had to finish it quickly so the family of hops were able to stay together. I don't want to be the kind of person that separates a family."
"D - For all the trash talking on the bottle, this is a balanced American IPA. Very drinkable, But it's not something you want to hurry through. Savor it."
"Drinkability: A good choice for any IPA fans. Easy to session (just under 7%) and not too heavy in the belly. I like."
"to have just one."
"D - This is the type of IPA I would give to people who are looking to try IPAs for the first time, it's pretty unoffensive, no offensive hop tastes, very drinkable."
"D - This is one of those beers that reminds me how many great beers there are out there right now. This is an exceptional IPA but when I walk into my favorite beer stores, I tend to walk right by...it doesn't stand out to me on the shelves...seems ""common"". But, I'm glad to have picked up this one along the way. This is a great IPA that suffers from great availability. Very drinkable IPA, great west coast flavors, reasonable pricing...what more can you ask for. Think I have to revisit this one more often...hmm, wonder how many other great beers like this I just walk by in the stores."
"The taste is hop heaven and it goes down smooth although I get a bit of a ""tinny"" after taste. Very light and not filling at all. I have to say I understand why this is a popular beer."
"Quite happy to finally try this much talked about IPA. Also happy to say it is as good as everyne says. Basically they have nailed the style of American IPA. Nailed and virtually trademarked it. Hops aplenty on the nose in the mouth and well after you've finished. Having said that, it is still very well balanced with the malt and carbonation all nicely in place. Great benchmark IPA. Can't wait to try it again."
"Pours a surprisingly pale gold with a slight copper tinge. The head is fluffy light white and has great retention and ridiculous lacing. The nose is full of grapefruit and pine with just a touch of pot skunkyess. Sweet biscuit malt is also in the aroma. Flavor is wonderful with loads of American hop character. Grapefruit, pine, orange, floral and a hint of spice. It's all there folks. Strong bitterness, but this beer has a solid malt backbone that keeps it from being completely unbalanced. Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium with a sticky dry finish and lingering bitterness. The lighter body and dry finish makes it super quaffable. Could be hop addict's session beer if it had just a little bit lower of an ABV. Classic IPA, and one that I had forgotten how great it was. Glad I got a bomber."
"The hop flavor is nearly as dominant on the tongue as it is in the nose. Piney and bitter, lots of grapefruit and some orange zest, but the surprise is the malt presence. The sweet malty backbone really balances this IPA out. Medium bodied with a mildly sticky feel on the tounge. Very nice overall."
"Overall a great pick for American IPA if you want a superb quaffing beer."
"Drinkability: While still a typical unbalanced west coast ipa, overall this really is pretty drinkable. When I wake up and am feeling that bittery grapefruity taste...this is my go to."
"pours a light amber/copper with a two finger white head. smells pungent and brilliant. sharp alpha acids, tropical fruits, citrus hops, granny smith apples, and mangos. the tastes is great, with a bitterness that lingers on the tongue. oily hops and huge fresh pine with a small malt base, a bit spicy. solid IPA. benchmark. this would be a great introductory beer for anyone 'crossing over'"
"Happy hour, $3 20oz pints of Stone, count me in! Nice looking IPA with a moderate head and good lacing. Smell is an assault to nose with a ton of citrus and a bit of pine. Taste follows with the nose plus some. A bitter-sweet citric parade fills the palate. The hop oils are ouzing out of every sip. Finishes with a perfect amount of bitterness. Dryness lingers on for quite awhile after a pint or two. Overall, a top notch IPA."
"OVERALL: Say what you want about their marketing, but Stone is one of the most solid and consistently good breweries in the States. This was an enjoyable and tasty IPA, and if you’re a fan of bitterness, this will not disappoint. Admittedly, the first time I had this beer many moons ago I was not all that impressed, but freshness may have been an issue there. This bottle was great, so I’m glad I was able to have it again. Well worth picking up if you haven’t done so yet. Recommended."
"D: This beer is quite bitter and dry, however, it drank well enough for me to want another after I was finished. This is a typical west coast IPA, but better than alot of others I have had."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, great traditional aspects of the style, very satisfying, and offering great value at the store."
"Having sampled a number of Stone brews since, I have now become an official hop-head, and can accept this as the truly great beer that it is. In fact, I revel in it."
"As soon as I smelled this beer I thought I was going to love it. But like I said above there is just something about the aftertaste that I dont like. However the more I drink it the more I like it, probably wont buy any more anytime soon though."
"D - It's a good IPA, just not my favorite. It is what you would expect a Stone IPA to taste like."
"Flavor is enjoyable enough to continue to sip, and mouthfeel further augments the drinkability."
"D_Light,crisp, and refreshing. Easy drinking IPA."
"This is an impressive IPA that lives up to all expectations - fine anytime, anywhere, with any meal!"
"A cloudy burnt orange color with good off-white foam. A bountiful hop aroma seems to alternate between citrus and pine. The taste seems to confirm this as the pine bitterness gives way to the citrus finish. The hop bitterness lingers for awhile but not overpowering. This IPA has a very smooth feel and is so well balanced that I think it is just a wonderful introduction for anyone into the IPA style. Easy drinking and complex, a great IPA for anytime, anywhere."
"The sweet maltiness first hits the tongue immediately followed by a wonderfully bitter tang of hops. Piney and citrusy, the hops are very well balanced by the sweet and bready grains, and the slight carbonation. Drinkability is very good."
"Mouth/Drink: Smooth and easy to drink. I expected more out of this. Its a great beer, but all the hype it gets on here led me to believe its the best single IPA which isn't true."
"Drinkability- Big hops overshadow nearly 7% ABV. Not heavy bodied, but a chunky mouthful of hops."
"Overall, this is a really nice example of the style and I would love to get my hands on a fresher version because this is a very hop-forward beer. It's not a hugely complex IPA but it's very well put-together and is something I would definitely drink again often."
"Overall: One of the best traditional west coast IPA's out there, hard to top."
"I've had this in the bottle many times and on-tap, finally getting to review it. Poured into my new Magic Hat pint glass (thanks Julio's). Appearance is faint orange with nice creamy white head, carbonation bubbles flying everywhere. Head retains well and leaves thick lacing. Smell is great as well, loads of hops and some tropical notes. Taste is good but doesn't really live up to the smell. I'm getting lots of grassy notes, grapefruit, in the aftertaste a bit of biscuit and surprisingly booze. A hint of toasty caramel lingers as well. Mouthfeel is a tad watery. As far as drinkability, it's good but there are probably other IPA's I'd prefer for the same price/cheaper (Titan IPA comes to mind). Still a solid go-to IPA I will continue to get in the future."
"All things considered, a pretty good IPA. No glaring weaknesses, although isn't a favorite. Would love to get it fresh."
"This beers is actually quite smooth with the right amount of carbonation. It is on the thick side, but it fits well. Drinkibility is great on this beer as well, something that is fairly easy to put down and tastes great. All around just a great beer."
"D: it is up there but I like the sharp citrus hops better, for me it lends to more drinkability."
"TRY THIS BEER NOW!"
"D: The smooth and creamy nature of this beer allow for a very palatable beer that is in my opinion unoffensive and light for an IPA."
"Pours orange-golden with thin white head that dissipates. Clear. Nice floral hop aroma invites you in. Straight bitterness, but very clean and crisp and not overly harsh. Malt is present for only a blink. Dry finish. Very good, but I think I prefer the Ruination. This is a very easy drink, though. Makes me wish it was 80 F and sunny and not 22 F like it is now!"
"drinkability - with the abv being near 7% this one could creepy up on you so watch out"
"Ooh. I did not expect that. The obvious flavor commencement is citrusy hops, but it follows with a surprising grilled, smoky flavor to finish. The aftertaste is almost buttery (my brother says he tastes bacon). This beer would satisfy the hophead who enjoys a little more three-dimensionality in their palate. I appreciate it, but the smokiness is not what I expect or enjoy in an IPA. I like the finish to be a little more sweet. With that said, this is definitely worth trying. It has a uniqueness as compared to other run-of-the-mill IPA's, but I find myself largely indifferent."
"(d) Decent for an IPA, others defintely offer more drinkability, but with a decent ABV and considering the bitterness I could suprizingly enjoy a few of these bombers...but probably nothing else! (4/5)"
"D- Very drinkable for a high gravity IPA with balance. Yet it will attack the pallet and more then two for me would start to overdo the taste it brings."
"Very beautiful beer in the glass, the epitome of perfection in beer. Smell is the best I have ever smelt. I want to take a swab and dab my upper lip so I can smell it all day... yummmm. Very hoppy beer, if you drink it, savor it, it deserves it. A beer very worthy of RESPECT!"
"Pours a cloudy gold/amber, medium white head with a creamy texture. Decent lacing. Strong aroma of hops, with citrus (grapefruit, lemon) and pine. Underlying aromas of yeast. Taste is extremely hoppy, with an excellent bite, and flavors of grapefruit balanced with a finish that is long and slightly on the sweet side. Excellent beer."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass and noted a golden-apricot hue with a small, quickly dissipating head. Low carbonation with a sharp hopped-citrus smell that i really enjoy. Taste was a smooth, balanced hop flavored experience reminiscent of two-hearted ale with a moist finish. Mouthfeel was a medium, almost silky sensation and the drinkability factor was unlimited. Great ipa i will always buy when given the opportunity!"
"There really isn't much to say about Stone IPA. It's a solid, straight-ahead American IPA. It doesn't throw any curveballs, but everything it attempts it does right."
"I got this six pack in Brooklyn and definitely think I need to visit San Diego to really get a feel for this beer. A good transcontinental IPA nonetheless."
"Poured into a pint glass. It has a hazy golden color with about a finger worth of off white head. The citrus hop aroma is excellent. The overwhelming smell is that of oranges. Out of the gates the citrus presence hits you followed by some nice bitterness. The finish is nice and smooth. This is a well balanced IPA."
"Overall- this ipa is a classic american ipa to me. nice hop bite and aroma. if you're a hop fan and you haven't tried this one i don't know what you're doing??"
"Pours a somewhat hazy orangish amber with good head retention and insane sheets of lacing. Smell is intense with hoppiness. The first few sips were bitter and not much else. As it warmed, I picked up some more subtle sweet herbal notes. I got something almost like a burnt rubber aftertaste that was kind of odd. All in all, this is a very nice example of a good IPA. Maybe not the best I've had, but it's up there. If you don't love over-the-top hops, don't even think about it."
"A very different beer on cask with a superior drinkability."
"Notes: A very hoppy IPA, packs a biting punch but works rather well. Maybe a tad too hefty to introduce people to the style but if one likes IPAs this is really pleasing."
"A nice IPA; nowadays one of the reliably clean ones that doesn't sicken you with sweetness. This one uses enough bittering hops to keep the mouthfeel clean and quenching, and the flavors are bright, if a little tart."
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden honey color with a foamy white head. Streams of carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. Good retention and lacing. Very attractive beer. Smell is a little reserved for a west coast IPA. Nonetheless, piney and citrusy hops are prevelant. Taste is resiny, piney hops with a balancing pale malt backbone and a touch of honey sweetness. The finish is crisp and dry with a moderate bitterness left on the palette. Medium bodied and no alcohol presence. This is one sessionable and balanced IPA. I think I'll have another."
"12 ounce bottle into a duvel tulip. Orange with a nice white head that disappeared quickly . Small amount of lacing. Man i love this beer. Grapefruit hop flavors basically dominate with a sweet malt background that becomes more prevalent as it warms. I just love the hop forward nature of stone IPA's. Its definitely not the most balanced one out there but that's why i like it."
"D- Overall pretty good but I think this would cause some palate fatigue after a couple. Decent overall but there are other IPA's I would go to before this one."
"Overall a solid beer that is a staple in my fridge. Everything an IPA should be in my opinion."
"I very much enjoyed this brew. Hop dominant with floral bitterness and very drinkable. I would pursue it again, and could be the most enjoyable Stone offering I have had to date."
"Perfect beer for any hop jockeys out there."
"*Tasting notes from summer before a Tigers game*"
"This is a decent IPA at best to me. Too bitter for my tastes. I can drink, but usually would chose not to if I have any choice in the matter."
"O: This is the standard for all other west coast IPAs to follow, though the mid-west style IPAs are more my cup a tea. Even considering slight style differences, I would not buy this again if I could get two hearted instead."
"D - It's not quite what I remember - really no match for Two Hearted at this point - but it is pretty good. I don't find myself wanting another right now, though finishing it wouldn't be a problem, but I'd like to revisit it in the near future."
"Pours a dark gold with a nice, fluffy white head. Nose is of citrus and floral hops. Taste is quite bitter along with citrus and floral notes blending together quite well, with the floral notes taking the lead--very nice in the sense that it's different from many of the better IPA's, which are typically loaded solely with citrus. Great carbonation and excellent drinkability."
"D – I would go for something else, generally."
"A bomber is tasty, I'd come back to it if I knew I was buying very fresh beer. This seemed like it had too much age on it for an IPA."
"D: This is a no-brainer drink anytime brew from the guys @ Stone. Not as many complex flavors as say Ruination, but at 1/2 the price, I'm on my way to get more!!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a medium to soft carbonation. Very drinkable and recommended highly."
"Drinkability on this one is above average, in my opinion. A great tasting brew, with not too much alcohol content. Could be my favorite ""session"" brew."
"Orange copper colour with a white head that leaves a nice-looking lacing. The smell is truly something to behold. All kinds of fruits and flowers come together to form a bouquet of brilliance that is hard to describe using only the words in our English language. Suffice it to say that the smell is so powerful that I almost feel as if drinking it would be an affront to my nose. The taste, while by no means as affront, simply doesn't live up to to the nose. That, however will be the only negative thing you will hear me say about this. It tastes wonderful, with a hops taste, and a malt finish that creates a wonderful balance, while still maintaining the bite and bitterness that a good IPA should have. Feels wonderful, with a great body, and I could drink this all day. A great product that I'll be glad to have another of."
"Great IPA to drink. Not to strong, not to light. Just a great all around IPA"
"D: Being on the east coast of Canada, I've probably been lucky to have the few Stone beers that I've managed to find on trips to the U.S. Beers like this one continue to make me want to try more... three for three so far, Stone! Keep up the excellent work."
"One of the best IPAs you can buy. Highly recommend."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with hints of orange and a slight haze. Left a good 1"" off-white head with good retention. Leaves solid lacing. Smell is piney and earthy. Makes you think of the woods. Taste is initially smooth with a smokey hop bight for a finish. Kind of burnt. Mouthfeel is pretty light, mild carbonation. A little too mild actually. Drinkability is good never the less. This is a great bitter IPA. Not too complex, just right."
"Lots of pukey chicks at the end of the night, who didn't realize that this stuff has some kick. I had never seen chicks drink anything so good and bitter. Good times."
"Overall/notes: This is just a good IPA from Stone. I preferred their Pale Ale a little more, but that just speaks about how great THAT beer was. This one is... well it's really good, too. An easy-to-access beer that'd be great for novices (like myself) to look into."
"If you like IPA's this is a no brainer! Great appearance, not too carbonated, and will simply blow you away."
"D: Drinks pretty well but not much better than your average, baseline IPA."
"Had to fight off my hophead cat, who couldn't keep her nose out of the glass(a high mark of approval)"
"D. This beer was good but I feel that there are a many better IPA's in Cali. I would have trouble drinking more than 2 of these at one sitting."
"D-This is one easy drinking IPA. It's easily one of my favorites and I hope Stone makes it to Chicago soon so I can regularly enjoy this fine beer."
"Value: Expensive, considering what else is out there in IPA Land."
"D: This is very drinkable. The flavors are nicely balanced, and the hops don't overwhelm like many other IPAs. Alcohol is just right to add a perfect warmth to the finish."
"D: Very drinkable and crisp, dry finish adds to the drinkability. Very nice."
"Overall, I first didn't properly appreciate this beer and now I am a true fan. I will drink this often. The review stats reflect this review session."
"Poured a dark coppery gold. Nice two finger head that quickly disspated to one finger before I had a chance to take the first sip. Initial smells were with very forward hops but the citrus and fruit was present as well. The hop and fruit flavors are very forward on the palate. The taste hits you right away and then goes away with a nice balance. This beer does not have a huge bitter aftertaste you might expect given the initial smell and taste. Overall just another impressive Stone product."
"D: As sessionable an IPA as they come. Not quite the complexity or big malt foundatiton as its big brother, but I could drink a few of these."
"really excellent beer."
"D-Good beer, originally gave it a lower d rating, but after 4 they are still going down easy. Very surprising d for a hh and h alc beer"
"D: This a pretty good session beer, even with a higher than average ABV. Regardless of price, if I'm in a hophead mood, I'll have to consider this one, or Ruination as my hopped beers of choice."
"This is one of the top IPAs I've ever had, I'm thrilled it's in the Louisiana market!"
"D-such a great IPA, very bitter and aromatic"
"D: full of zest and formidable flavors, this is a staple in IPA's as far as I am concerned. Its overall drinkability is one of its best assets. I was disappointed that I had not reviewed this one, as I have had it countless times before...oh well. I am glad I got a sixer of this from ""The Plaid"""
"D - Quite drinkable. ABV is under control, and it's not too abusive on the palate. Great tasting and complex. I'll come back to this beer, and possible update my review to give it due diligence."
"D> I think most people wouldn't have any problem drinking these all nights, especially fans of the style."
"Overall, this is a flavourful and interesting West Coast IPA, and I'm glad to have tried it. A great beer all around."
"D: Very high drinkability, but not one to throw back. Definitely a beer for sipping and savoring."
"The pine and grapefruit is apparent in the flavor. Smells very hoppy. The head looks soft and pillowy, like a really comfortable mattress, like I could sleep on it. A hoppy cloud. Super clear beer. The taste sticks around in my mouth, which is a good thing."
"Mild lacy head. Clear bright rich gold color. Rich hop front. Dry sweet citrus caramel crisp Pils malt body. Clean rich tangy hop spice end.Hoppy clean balanced mild sweet IPA. Deceptively rich and smooth. Classic West Coast San Diego IPA."
"D: Very well balanced beer from Stone, one of those beers that go well with anything. Nothing that impresses, but definitely consistent."
"D- Very drinkable for any IPA lover. After finishing one, I could definitely have another."
"Poured this from bottle bought at a local store. Poured it into a pint glass. It made a 1/8"" off-white head that left a lot of lacing down the sides of the glass throughout the drinking of the beer. The smell was pine, citrus w/ a faint malt that is easily over-powered by the assertive hop smell. The taste is more hops. It is bitter, but the bitterness mellows quickly. This beer has a bitter, pleasant aftertaste. Despite the bitterness and assertive hops, the mouthfeel is smooth and velvety. I find it very drinkable."
"D - A really nice IPA"
"This is a staple in the world of IPA's. It's affordable, and widely distributed (but not widely enough!). It's good enough to hang with the big boys (Sculpin, Pliny) and cheap enough to win out over them most of the time. What a great brew."
"One of the tip top IPAs, but these days the price is getting prohibative per 6 pack so it's becoming a treat rather than a regular."
"D- nice session beer. clean and crisp and a little subdued for an ipa. really enjoyed this beer...has the right mix of hoppy bitterness and pine for my palate"
"I could certainly drink several of these in one sitting. A lot of positive qualities about this IPA, and yet another solid brew from a very solid brewery."
"Overall, one of the best IPA's I've ever come across. The only thing that makes me mad is how long it's has been since I've had one. It's a regular again on tap so I'm sure I will be denting the keg quite frequently."
"Medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Ruination may be one of my favorite beers, but Stone's regular IPA is so much lighter while still being quite flavorful. It's not as crazy as Ruination but the hop presence is still amazing and I want to drink it all day. One of my all time favorite IPAs."
"Poured into a nonic glass it forms a 10 mm head that leaves ample lacing. The color is amber and clear. The aroma is strongly of citrus and grassy hops with little sweetness. The taste is also strongly of citrus hops and on the dry side with a little sweetness and lots of bitterness. The feel is full bodied with moderate carbonation. One of these per evening is ample refreshment."
"D- Deceptively drinkable for nearly 7%. Nothing is too overwhelming, which is good except for with the hops, which I was hoping to be more prominent. All in all, a good beer and definitely one of the better of the widely accessible IPAs. I feel like this bottle might be a little older than I would have liked, but no dating system on the bottles so I don't know. I hadn't had it in months before tonight, but I remember having a bottle or two and definitely some servings from the tap that were slightly better, but my palate may has changed since then too."
"Pale Amber cloudy body, 3/4 finger white semi-rocky head, some lacing. Citrusy nose (grapefruit) some piney-ness, and bready malts. Taste is quite citrus, a bit sweet, meyer lemons? Above average mouthfeel and carbonation. Extremely drinkable. Maybe not as much of a hopbomb as most SD IPAs, but certainly an exemplar of the West Coast IPA style. Along with HUB and Bell's Two Hearted, one of the most balanced IPAs. Classic."
"Now, all I can say is wow!!! This is a damn good IPA!!! To me it has the perfect balance of hoppiness/maltiness. Very easy to drink, and leaves me wanting more. Nice session beer. I'll definitely be purchasing more Stone IPA's in the future."
"This pours hazy yellow orange with a little small layer of foam at the top which will lace the glass slightly. It has a very fragrant like cologne. The taste is also bursting with flavor with lots of orange which pairs well this stones trademark hoppiness. Finishes dry and quick."
"This is a tasty beer packed with hops. The bitterness is a bit sharp on the finish and a bit too astringent. Throughout the sample the hop aroma gave way to sweet malt and honey. The flavors kept going back and forth between pungent, pithy hops and sweet malt. The hops are very persistent on the finish."
"Pours a light, murky gold with little, but persisting, sticky head. Smells like citrus, grass, and a faint note of pine needles. Taste is a tart citrus, and pine. Strong hops bitterness, but sweet maltiness, without being syrupy - it is surprisingly light and extremely drinkable."
"D - I really do not know why this beer does not get more recognition, it is a great IPA and something I will be buying a lot of"
"D- Very refreshing and could be a good session beer. I'm not even a huge IPA fan but I could see myself having a few of these. Would accommodate some great food very nicely."
"D - A classic. Quaffable to the extreme."
"D : Great example of an IPA, so keep it coming. A great hop - malt balance really adds up to its drinkability"
"I don't really like it, so I won't be drinking it much. It looks overbarleyed and tastes like a medicine while feeling as if it's soda. It's an eccentric experience--particularly for such a simple IPA--but that doesn't mean I'll revisit it."
"Overall, definitely one of my favorite IPA's, and I really cannot say enough about Stone as a brewery...never a shortage of amazement"
"The color is a nice hazy golden. The smell is very hoppy with some citris in it. It also has a very very nice earthy smell. The taste is very hoppy, a nice bitterness to it and some citris as well. Pretty good IPA, ive had better, but this holds its own. Also, the lacing on this beer is magnificant, its in abundance all up and down the glass."
"Well balanced IPA. Lots of grapefruit and orange character in this one. Nice head, good lacing and nice grapefruit aroma. By well balanced I don't mean malt and hops I mean citrus and pine flavors derived from the choice of hops. Okay, hops and malt too. Medium body, medium carbonation. Crisp and oily. Good solid choice but a little overrated in my book."
"12oz bottles. Pours a slight cloudy yellow colour. A nice hop punch to it, quite tasty and smooth. Doesn't live up to the hype though. It was very sweet as well, almost a little too sweet. Have had better IPAs, but its still pretty good."
"D-Exceedingly drinkable for an aggressively hoppy IPA. Drinks well cold and warmer. An excellent IPA, quickly becoming a favorite of mine."
"very smooth mouthfeel, and finishes dry with a lingering hop bitterneness. this beer is well rounded and hoppy. easy to drink, it's one of my go-to beers."
"dr. You kidding? Easy."
"Over-all: pretty good. Once it starts warming up, though, I think it will be too bitter for me to really enjoy."
"Drinkability - the sixer disappeared quickly, I had to hold this last one off to review."
"The taste is again mostly citrus - grapefruit - with pine and a light raisiny grain sweetness underneath, but not quite enough to carry it. It's far too bitter, with some malty sweetness to balance and a grain element in the finish, but too unbalanced and sharply bitter. Making a beer, even an IPA really bitter, simply does not to me equal good beer."
"D: An exceptional IPA with fabulous flavors. Would like a hint more aroma though. The appearnce was solid, but not the amount of head I was looking for. Overall, this is a hop lovers dream, with tons of hoppy flavors. A showcase of the American hop as it should be. I will buy this again and again. Please start distributing in Minnesota."
"12 oz bottle to glass. Clear yellow-orange, soapy head, lacing is great. Smell is good, juicy fruit and some spice. Taste is much heavier in the hops than malt, but not too off balance. Bitter finish makes you want another sip to get the malt back for a couple seconds. Very drinkable, well done."
"Drinkablility: This is one drinkable IPA, and at 6.9% you might have to be a little careful, because this sucker will sneak up on you."
"Just a little bit smoother than DFH 60 minute with an extra kick. A really great intro brew for strangers to Stone looking to start out with some of the big guns."
"This is an excellent beer all around, very complex and flavorful."
"MOUTH FEEL - Nice and thick enough to deliver the taste all over."
"Mouthfeel is nice, with significant bite from the hops. Medium carbonation works well with the rest of the beer. I could have one of two tops before my tongue begin to beg for mercy."
"D - The best. Probably THE most drinkable beer I know. It finishes only slightly sweet and a bit dry, which brings me right back in. A big reason for my purchase was knowing how crisp and refreshing it was."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: An IPA with a great look, nose and initially a great flavor. It's too bad the alcohol showed its head so much. Nonetheless, an IPA that will end up in my crate again in the future."
"J"
"Drinkability: quite refreshing, actually, despite the somewhat high ABV and large hop presence. I'm sure it would go great with a steak."
"Like I said...I'm a Smutty and DFH guy, but with Stone a recent addition to Maryland offerings, it hasn't taken long to make onto my favorite's list."
"Drinkability - I could definitely have a few of these without any problems. It wasn't as hoppy as I thought it was going to be but don't be mislead, there is a good amount of flavorful hops to be had in this one."
"this is one of the best beginner beers out there as it is readily available almost anywhere and is relatively inexpensive. not one of the best ipas but it certainly has earned its reputation."
"Overall: I love the Stone Brewery. Arrogant Bastard, Oaked AB, Levitation...but this one, not so much. You guys missed the mark here. I think it would go well with my breakfast tomorrow morning...in a juice glass."
"In my mind, belongs in the top tier of go-to American IPAs. A must try for every beer lover."
"Poured into a pint glass hazey orange with a thick white head. Great lacing all the way down. Smell is a tough one. I had to pull a glass from my dishwasher, which needs to be cleaned of lime deposits, so all I'm getting is the lime smell from the terrible local water. The taste had a very pronounced hop bite up front, and it's missing the bad after taste that some IPA's have that I find unappealing. It's a very smooth ale, that might be a little light in the mouthfeel. But overall this is one of my favorite AIPA's."
"D: I could definitely down a few more of these, a top-notch IPA"
"I have not had this old favorite in some time now, and tasting it again I find it every bit as delicious as I remembered. Exceptionally delicious, it is crisp and ideally balanced. I find the malt profile of this beer slightly unusual with a welcome earthiness, rounding things out perfectly and setting this brew apart from its peers. In my mind an exemplary American IPA."
"Drinkability: It has a decent drinkability depending on what you like, if you are into the less malty bitter ipa's you will definitely like this one. Even though it has a lot of bitter to deliver it still is smooth and creamy, which, to me, stands out. Id prefer it had a little bit more maltiness to it, but don't get me wrong its definitely good."
"Overall: Hopheads abound this is your beer, has enough bitter but isn't face puckering. Drops the bomb and laughs in your face for it. Prefer a less hopped beer well as stone would say. 'youre not worthy'"
"I will have to be more careful when I scoop from the singles bin: this one was best before May 17, 2009 (about four months ago). Regardless, it turned out to be a very good beer just the same, just not a high spirited IPA I might have otherwise have enjoyed. Poured a hazy, orange-tangerine gold with a half finger white head. A cloudy centre remained with a good ring, spotty lace. Smell of citrus hops, sweet and fruity, bit of rind in the mix. Taste is still hop forward although grapefruit affect muted for the most part; still there is a discernible citrus taste with sufficient bitterness and plenty of biscuit malt in the finish. Mouthfeel still has a lot of liveliness, hoppy but with an even, balanced acidity and nice texture. Very drinkable. A nice IPA even though its' best days were behind it, love to try it again fresher sometime."
"D - average drinkability. If you dislike super bitter IPAs, stay clear of this one; otherwise, I think you'l enjoy this one. Personally, I thought this was okay - it was very bitter at first but after a couple of drinks the bitterness became tolerable. Definitely not a bad IPA, just okay."
"Outstanding, epic beer. Balanced, balanced, balanced. Obviously a hop bomb, but the crafting of the grain bill and malt character of this beer shows the love and care that the brewers put into it. If this was available in Missouri, this would find a nice home in our fridge. Going to be the traditional American style IIPA that I compare all others of the same style to..."
"The taste is just overwhelmingly hoppy. Thats all that dominates throughout the whole tasting instead of a very nice bite at the end. Just too bitter to be a great IPA."
"Drinkability: One of my top 3 IPA's of all time, it's a shame I am trying this beer so late (As of right now Stone is finally available in my neck of the woods) - At 6.9% ABV this is very drinkable. If you looked up the definition of IPA in the dictionary, this beer should come up. An excellent pursuit for the hop cravers out there with all the right elements to make this a regular in anybodys fridge. I can't wait to see what else I have in store from the brewers at Stone!"
"A warm, orange-gold color with a rocky white head that clings to the side of the glass like few others. A generous amount of lace covers the beer to the last drop. The aroma is absolutely incredible. Unbelievably strong and showing a nice depth of citrus flavors, most noticeably grapefruit. The taste is a beautiful display of hop character with a juicy explosion of grapefruit and an unyielding dryness that is hard to beat. As it warmed up, the flavors really softened and blended harmoniously, but still packed quite a wallop. Despite it's relatively high ABV and strong hop bitterness, I found this extremely drinkable and pleasant. A perfect beer for summertime or spicy food or both. I'll definitely be drinking this again and again."
"I started the evening with a black butte porter (bottle) -- great beer.. then I tried a Stone IPA. I had never had it before but I could tell after the first drink that it was good. Actually it was a great beer , very easy to drink . Can't wait to try it again . Wasn't as good the 2nd time.. seems more of a summer beer."
"drinkability - Not great but good. For people who are really into hops it's great. For me personally a little too hoppy to have more than one at a time. Overall very satisfying. It's very tasty. You can tell it's a quality beer."
"M/D - fantastic, I can't say much else"
"Overall: Stone's IPA was one of those beers that got me into craft beer. Now, after a year or two into the beer scene...I still find myself enjoying this beer...just not as much I used too. A try it beer. Cheers!"
"additional note: this comes in at 6.9% - and the 1 pint 6 oz bomber gave me a decent buzz. Thanks Stone!"
"Drinkability: This is pretty good. I feel I've had some better IPAs, but this one is certainly a quality beer."
"This is one of my favorite IPA's. It pours nicly with a great golden amber color, and if poured corectly, a nice pillow of foam for a head. The aroma is filled with citrus, florals and hops witch make that first taste a flavor explosion. Hops and Hops with a little citrus sweetness. Very Nice. As the beer warms it gets even better. It smoothes out with even my of that great sweet taste. Good feel in the mouth leaves you wanting more."
"Drink this beer all day and all night."
"D: Easy to drink -- ready for more of the same afterwards. Great stuff!"
"D - Wow. This is a great beer on draft. Hop flavor dominates but doesn't overwhelm. More please!"
"D: super high.. very refreshing on the hot day"
"Drinkability: Every company is pushing for their IPA to bigger and badder then the next. They all do it slightly differently, but stone delivers with a very hoppy IPA thats not overly bitter. It has all the flavor you want from an IPA, without any of the things many companies do wrong with this style. For me being introduced to the world of stone, I may have to reconsider my favorite IPA."
"The fairly high percentage of alcohol is not overtly present at the end of the swallow. The taste lingers until finally it concludes on its own volition. I reccommend this to anyone curious about IPAs, or are in need of trying something new and different."
"As the beer warms, it becomes sweeter, and more complex taste wise, but the hops are still all powerful . This the perfect beer for hop heads, or someone that after another long drudged-out work day wants that one or two beer buzz to take the edge off and settle in to relaxation mode."
"Quite possibly the best American IPA I've ever had."
"D - My tongue and mouth say ""no more"" but the tastebuds gotta have it. Wonderful flavor and not too harsh in any of the flavors. Nicely balanced."
"On tap. Pours clear copper with a fluffy white head. The foam dies down to leave a considerable amount of lacing. Smells well-hopped, with heavy citrus. Only a hint of malt and some sweet light fruit. Tastes outright heavily hopped, with notes of dish soap predominant. Maybe it's the mixture of citrus and resin, but whatever the taste is, it's unpleasant. Gets better as it warms and as the palette gets numb to it. Pleasant sweet malt eventually shows through. Medium body. I don't know what it is about the hops Stone uses---I really enjoy other IPAs and DIPAs, but both this and Ruination have had the same soapy quality, and I'm not a big fan."
"A nice mild carbonation and lacy body make this one a real drinker. Not as bold and exciting as a lot of stone beers, but a very solid go to beer when in a pinch."
"D: ABV is too high for a session beer, but some might like this one so much they drink quite a few anyway. This is a textbook American IPA...and American IPAs rock."
"O-Very good IPA, It helps me get my hp fix when I need one."
"D: This is one of the best stright up IPAs I have ever had. A very easy drinking IPA. Would go great with some spicy food even just a pizza. Highly, highly recommend this one!"
"Excellent IPA! One of the best."
"D - YES...oh man, this bomber is going down so easy."
"Side Note: i paired this beer with some Pepper Jack cheese and the beer complimented perfectly."
"D - Far too hoppy for me, to the point of overpowering my taste buds. Not one of the best IPAs that I have tasted."
"I'd have to go ruination for my hop fix from Stones."
"Golden pour with a nice, thick white head, which laced and lasted well. Great citrus and floral hop aroma combined with some sweeter caramel malts. Wow, full on grapefruit in the flavour produces a hop explosion in the mouth. Even with the hop profile a little past its peak this beer still produces big time, resulting in pretty high bitterness. It actually still tastes really fresh to me (because of the dominance of the hops, and there's a nice resin aftertaste. Thankfully, the flavour is nicely balanced by caramel malts (what a classic combo grapefruit and caramel has become!). Medium body, with a prickly mouthfeel which helps to accentuate the bitterness."
"Today, i join the hophead club."
"Drinkability is good but I don't think this is a good session beer a bit to hoppy for my liking for a good session (heartburn even)."
"Overall: easily the best IPA i've ever had. like hop flowers in a glass."
"This is a great beer. I think it is the best IPA that I have had."
"Overall: I'd rate this very high. One of the best IPAs I've ever had."
"this is the perfect beer for my 50th review!!!"
"D: I marked the drinkability down half a point on this because I am not sure if I would want to drink Amarillo hops all evening."
"Notes: Now I know why this beer gets so much attention from ""hop heads"" as it is delicious and drinkable while featuring the hops. At the risk of entering hyperbole, this is a masterfully done IPA."
"D - A very nice IPA...balanced and crisp...making this a very sessionable IPA...but if I were to chose between this and Ruination...Ruination would win hands down"
"Exceptional mouthfeel and drinkability. Could down quaite a few of these."
"A really good ipa, this is one i don't drink enough because it's so prevelant. I usually go for another ipa, if that's what i'm in the mood for, or another stone, if that's what i'm looking for. In any case, a very good ipa and one you should fully consider if it's available."
"Stone IPA is one of, well, it is my favorite beer. I can drink a Stone IPA and completely change my mood. Stone is probably the best example of an American IPA available. I've made IPAs a focus of my beer drinking and sampling and I can say without hyperbole, this is a great beer. Of course it is better on draught than in the bottle, but I had a 12 oz bottle of it served in my Stone IPA glass. Medium head, strong aroma of cascade hops, dark yellow, clear (although sometimes the bottles are cloudy). Excellent mouthfeel, a great amount of hops but the bitterness is not overpowering."
"This is a very good IPA I have enjoyed (and will enjoy) many, many times."
"Go buy some and drink it. You will like it."
"D: Highly drinkable, but watch out for this one, it will bite when you're not looking at 6.9%."
"D - Top shelf west coast IPA. One of the best. Great session beer even at 6.9% abv."
"D- Very good, wouldn't mind drinking this throughout the night, will be purchasing again soon. Personally I feel that this should be the gold sandard for IPA's."
"Poured cloudy orange color with small head. I was not able to pick out much of an aroma. The taste was citrus and a hoppy bitterness (which I liked). I admit to not being a great IPA fan, but I did like this beer. So far, this one runs second to the AleSmith IPA."
"Taste was great. Slight citrus taste. Slightly acidic with a background sweet taste. Bitterness was quite present. About a 5 out of 10 on the bitterness scale. Beer was very drinkable. Could imagine drinking this on a hot summer's day. I'm still learning about my other beer tastes and flavors."
"This is a very drinkable, tasty brew. The dry/hoppy quality make it a super drinker on an 88-degree summers day!"
"Very happy and will certainly look for this bottled in my local beer store."
"Awesome. Very good IPA."
"Overall- A very good beer, very hop forward which after reading the label is exactly what I expected "" . . big hop flavor . . . big hop aroma."" This is what I expect from an American IPA. Hoppy but not out of balance. Stone Brewing came through admirably."
"The mouthfeel is sharp initially with a clean citrus/hop flavor dominating. Carbonation is medium with a medium consistency. This is a fantastic IPA and I would tend to stay with it for a session. Another great beer from Stone."
"One of my staple single ipa's."
"Pours an orange color that is slightly hazy with a white fluffy two finger head. The head gives way to a little lacing. The smell is of hops with citrus much like pineapple juice and orange with a hint of floral. The taste is of hops with some citrus tons much of pineapple and orange again. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. The overall drinkability on this beer is extermely high."
"D - A great West coast IPA one of the best w/ a dry and highly drinkable quality. The taste is still not intense for the sake of intensity -this is a classic example of an American IPA w/ a more bitter hop focus. I enjoyed this IPA it is easy to take large gulps of this, it is refreshing."
"Drinkability: This IPA is one of my absolute favorites. I believe it emphasizes all the goodness that is an IPA without any single characteristic being overwhelming or offensive. This is one of my go-to IPA's."
"Pours a clear-ish amber with two finger white head, lacing but head collapses. Smell: full of citrus - lemon rind, bitter orange, grapefruit, pineapple juice, floral too!, with some malt sweetness in the background. Taste: also full of citrus - more grapefruit is prevalent here, orange, spiciness and a chill bready malt. Creamy and soft with a nice drying finish that is stopped short of puckering by the sweet malt backing up the citric hop punch. Fantastic."
"Drinkability: Hard to find much to fault it, really. Its great stuff. I'm pretty much a sucker for most of Stone's offerings. This one is a staple."
"A wonderful beer and one of my favorites. I can write nothing that has not already been said, a great beer and brewery."
"Pours a big, impressive froth that almost refuses to settle (which, of course, is a good thing). Leaves nearly enough lace to make it look like it didn't even settle! Copper to orange color. Absolutely beautiful hoppy aroma. Tons of floral and citrus character. In fact, it jumps out at you before you even finish opening the bottle. More citrus-like hop bitterness in the flavor, with some hints of spiciness and great malty undertones. Hops make it very smooth and crisp, and the bread-like maltiness underneath rounds it out quite well. Great balance of bitterness and sweetness as well. Dangerously drinkable! This is one wonderful brew. I'm loving every Stone brew I try with a passion! If you're just starting to love hops, this is a great step up from their pale ale if you're not quite ready for ""ruination"". And for the seasoned hophead, this is a wonderful treat and an exceptional brew all around! No matter who you are, try this! It will not fail to impress."
"D) Extremely high, would never guess this had a higher than 5%ABV. I downed this extremely fast and wished for another!"
"Finish - Creamy and exceptionally delicate for its medium body. Strong hop aroma rolls in at the very end of the beer and into the aftertaste. Finishes remarkably well."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid IPA. I have been going through a lot lately and this one seems to be one someone would consider a standard for an IPA. Definitely one to keep readily available for those hop heads. I could easily drink more of this."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable IPA. Refreshing and versatile. Especially good in warm weather."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is high due to the fact that this is one of my favorite styles and the ABV is on the low side. Sessionable. I really like this beer so I could have quite a few of these. I don't think it is on the level of Jai Alai from CCB or two hearted, but a very nice example of the style. Skal."
"Overall a little different taste than bottle (better), and still a damn fine IPA. Stone knows hoppy beers, and this one is no exception. Awesome."
"Drinkability - I would definitely be tempted to have a second one but I couldn't make this into a session beer. But then again, I'm not a fully addicted Hop-head...yet."
"D- This is a very drinkable brew. It's a shame this beer was tainted when I cracked it. I love Stone and this beer is the only off one that I had pretty much ever from Stone. But I drink this and like it. You should too."
"Hazy peach colored body with a fat cream colored head of foam that melts slowly and leaves a good deal of sticky lace on the glass. The nose is really good on this one, fresh and resinous smelling piney hops with a touch of grapefruit rind and pineapple. The flavor mirrors the nose with nice hop bitterness that lingers long into the finish and just enough caramel maltiness to balance the flavors. Medium bodied with a slippery hop oily mouthfeel. A really great example of the style that never gets old, I can't begin to guess how many of these I've had over the years and it still tastes as good as the first one."
"Mouthfeel was smooth and enjoyable. Drinkability is good, as this one is very delicious."
"A small white head covers a dark golden brew. Decent retention and some lacing on the glass. Aromas of fresh squeezed citrus, and bready malts to balance. Very floral and delicious...I can't wait to take a sip! And when I do, it's incredibly hoppy with tons of West Coast florals and herbals. I can taste such a great amount of hops...it really dominates my palate and not much else can pull through (in the true Stone style). Medium body mouthfeel offers my mouth tons of residuals, so that I can hang on to the bitterness. I would buy a 6er of this brew without thinking twice about it. Another great Stone offering that adheres to everything expected from a West Coast IPA."
"This has now become one of my top IPAs, along with Celebration and Two-Hearted."
"The IPA pours nicely into a glass with a great brown color. I find the aroma pleasant and the first and last taste delightful."
"Overall, I think this one smells better than it tastes. In a world of amazing IPAs, this one is a slight step down. A great brew, however, just not a world famous IPA in my book. Drink it fresh!!"
"Appearance is very good, nice billowing head with lots of lacing. Smell is very citrusy lots of grapefruit and lemon. There are some underlying dry hops as well. Taste was good but not great in my opinion. NOt one of the more bitter IPA's I have had. Mouthfeel was better, oily and slightly carbonated. The positive side was this was the most drinkable IPA I have ever had- it goes down so easy"
"Had better IPAs and wont seek this one again."
"Again, Stone has achieved almost perfection with this beer. One of my top 5 beers."
"Another Stone beer that I have had many times. Reviewing from notes taken at my last Stone beer night. Poured into a Stone Pint glass. Pours an orange-caramel into the glass, with a frothy head, and wonderful lacing. The aroma has all you'd expect: grapefruit, citrus, pine, and flowery. The taste has exactly the same qualities. There is a light caramel sweetness mixed with the huge hop presence. It has a very nice, refreshingly creamy finish that I loved. Truly, one of the best IPA's."
"I dare say this is a purist's brew and a standard for IPAs. ABV is a little deceiving, but low enough that this one can be sessioned with some frequency."
" I am not norally a huge fan of IPAs but wow. This is a great beer. It has a hoppy smell with some mixes of fruits, possibly grapefruit, a bit of lemon. felt like a meduim beer but flowed so smooth. the after taste was strong, but not overwhelming hops like most IPA's. It was a great mix and kept me coming back for another sip."
"Drinkability: Session-worthy much. Could drink this all day, but the ABV is more present here at 6.9 than I feel like Pliny the Elder is at an 8, but smooth and delicious nonetheless. Really just a fantastic IPA, and I'm more than happy if ever offered one."
"Big bodied, viscous, and a fair bit of a carbonation bite in the back of the throat. Nice. All of this works very well together in this great drinkable IPA."
"An absolute amazing beer, so many aromas and flavors from the hops. Just enough malt character to somewhat balance the beer, but overall, hops galore. Definitely my favorite IPA."
"Pours a clear golden color with a frothy white head that clings to the edges in clumps. Some slight citrus and malt scents bring great balance. Taste is just like the nose. A little citrus and piney hops along with some great malt flavors. Overall this is quite a refreshing and prefectly balanced IPA. I'm excited that they are coming to Louisiana at the end of the summer!"
"Drinkibility: I think after a couple it would start being too ""rich"" like many IPAs."
"Drinkibility: I can't leave this one alone. It is a perfectly balanced IPA. I could drink this one every day."
" Get Some!!!"
"I recommend this fine bier, one of the best IPAs I have tried. Do yourself a favor and try one. PRosit!"
"Stone IPA is by far one of the finest india pale ales that I have ever had. It has the heavy hops one comes to expect from an IPA, but it's smooth and far less abrasive than other brewers takes on IPA. It's a drag that you can't get Stone in Illinois, but well worth the drive to pick up a few bombers."
"Pours a crystal clear glowing orange with a fantastic slightly off-white creamy head. Aroma has caramel malt, granny smith apple and touches of citrus hops. Flavor has more of the citrus hops upfront with some light malts and a very light bitterness that doesn't dominated. its light to medium bodied with a very light carbonation. Very nicely done IPA, doesn't really stand out from most but the aroma is unique."
"I'm glad to finally get a chance to see what this beer is all about. Certainly didn't disappointed, maybe I wish I had found it sooner. Definitely a safe go-to for my citrus hop fix!"
"D: A go-to IPA. Top notch west coast beer."
"D - I tend to like IPAs with a good citrus or grapefruit profile to them so I really like this. I drank a few of these the other night without realizing it."
"Beer poured a light orange with a nice white head. Nose is huge with floral northwest hops. Taste is grapefruit hops, pine, and a hint of mango and bread in the background. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth, and is leaving a resiny layer on my palate. Drinkability is quite good, this is still one of my favorite IPA's!"
"Drinkability: Very high. This is a really enjoyable, basic IPA."
"D: This is a great IPA and another winner from Stone. Not as an intense a beer as Ruination, but still offers up a wonderful floral aroma and is packed with flavor for what I could easily consider a sessionable beer. It's amazing what these guys can do with some malt and hops."
"Very pleasing to drink and there is an superb amount of hops with just the right bite."
"[RR-hops]"
"Pours an orangish copper with foamy off-white head.. smells quite hoppy (of course), a bit fruity but the aroma is sort of subdued when you smell it after pouring, you need to smell the bottle to really get it.. A very fruity hop flavor, a bit sweet but, again, in a fruity way, not syrupy. A sweet aftertaste in the back of the mouth after swallowing. A good medium body. Super easy to drink, not heavy at all, could easily put down a ton of them. Its hard to judge which is better between this and Ruination, though.."
"Drinkability: A very good IPA. Good hops, with good malt balance. I would have preferred the taste to be closer to the smell, in relation to the hops, but it doesn’t disappoint either way. Easy drinker; definitely sessionable."
"I'll be looking for this one again for sure. At 6.9abv. i could drink a few of these badboys."
"Overall, a very nicely done IPA that I will have to revisit again."
"D - An allround great IPA, ill definitely have another."
"A great IPA. Stone Brewing has yet to disappoint."
"D- An awesome IPA."
"D: Very drinkable and a long time favorite. Not a whole lot needs to be said as this is one fine brew. Draped up and dripped out."
"D- If you're into bitterness it is very, very drinkable."
" this brew."
"The aroma is strong, fresh, floral, and hoppy. Taste is full of hoppy bitterness and flavor with some citrus flavors as well. Not much malt for balance, but it's not missed. Mouthfeel is mildly dry, but will be easy drinking."
"Verdict: As I had imagined, this is essentially Ruination's (relatively) little brother. In all honesty, this IPA is a lot hoppier (and a damn sight tastier) than many brewer's Double IPAs - just what you'd expect from the boys at Stone. Well done!"
"This is very drinkable."
"Overall a very nice IPA not to much special going on just a well crafted IPA."
"Being as I am newly enamored with IPA's, I went looking for them at the local beer snob emporium. When I found that Stone made just what I sought, my search ended. What does Stone make that isn't good? Many other IPA's that I have purchased have brought disappointment, not the case with this one. While it didn't send my mind into a the frenzy that I was looking for, it definitely scratched the itch. Very well representative as a Double IPA, at least in the humble opinion of this beer initiate."
"I tend to prefer ales that have at least one over-the-top aggressive characteristic; however, Stone IPA is consistent and strong in every area. It's an ideal IPA and the first one that would come to mind if I had to commit the rest of my life to just one. As appealing as that thought is, I plan to continue to play the field."
"Overall impression: Very solid West Coast IPA. For the first time, I feel that the weighting of the appearance is really dragging down the overall score of a beer. I can't give a beer with minimal head and lacing anything better than an 'average' appearance rating, though."
"D - Very easy to drink and a great IPA. A winner."
"Poured into a std pint glass. Good head that provides great lacing throughout the pint. Great hop aroma, a little sweet smelling. Hints of citrus upfront, only to lead straight into crisp hop bitter. Surprsingly drinkable. Yet another quality offering from Stone's."
"Pours semi-hazy amber to golden color with white head that dissipates to a thin layer. Nose is mixed citrus, with some focus towards grapefruit. Palate is sharply hoppy at the beginning which is quite nice, light malt midway, and grapefruit-orange citrusy towards the finish. Refreshing."
"D- Again, pretty good. Moves quick and tastes good."
"Pours a light straw color with a weak head that dissipates quickly and no lacing. Smells strongly of piny, grapefruity hops. Maybe a hint of pear? Tastes bitter and a tad bit tart. Mouthfeel is good for a beer this size and I could drink many of these."
"Drinkability - A nice drinkable IPA. Normally not my favorite style of beer, but I like this a lot."
"Terrific beer, and one of my favorite IPAs. Consistently good---one of my standbys. Obviously, I'm not alone in my praise for this beer so I'll stop gushing now. Enjoy!"
"D- simply amazing! I need to have at least one a week to stay sane...you will not be disappointed!"
"D- easy, one of my favorite IPA's"
"D: Easy to drink, though at nearly 7% it's not quite a session beer."
"A very good IPA but to my mind not up to the standard of Bell's Two Hearted."
"D - this beer was very balanced, almost to a fault. i thought that the yeast/malt flavor was a bit overdone. this isn't to say that the hop bitterness was't there, just not enough for my tastes. that said however, if you are looking for an American West Coast IPA that doesn't decimate your taste buds, and is very balanced, this might be a good choice."
"Cheers!!!"
"Had this with a greek style pizza. Poured into a pils glass. Hazy golden color, white head that stayed around, leaving a fair amount of lace. Smelled of American hops, big and kinda piney. Tastes of the same hops, but with a good malt backbone to back it up. This is bigger than a lot of IPAs and it shows. I don't think I've ever bought this before because I would have remembered how tasty it is."
"Very, very good IPA."
"Def. could have 3 of these. Good, crisp, good"
"Pours a clean, clear gold in color with not a huge head but still a sticky lacing on the sides of the glass through the entire beer. Though usually a hop fiend where I have to notice a pungent floral scent jumping out at me right off the bat or I'll already start having my contentions about how good an IPA gonna be even before it's first there's something nice and different about the subdued character in the aroma of this. It smells of citrus and pine along with some malt and I'm thinking something along the lines of peach but laid back, sweet and nice instead of brassy, bold and upfront. It's deceiving though because on first sip there is definitely a sharp hop tang up front. Not all pucker power though but like the scent-crisp and citrusy with that peach thing I mentioned in the backbone. Malt shows up in the middle adding a nice balance to the the sweety tarty flavor that surrounds it. The finish is slightly dry and kinda spicy with a bit of alcohol burn but nothing that would make ya think that this is close to a 7% ABV."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. and goes great with spicy snacks or meals."
"Another great Stone offering."
"D= Great. This is an awesome IPA. I'll be looking for this beer more often that's for sure."
"Off the tap at Sweetwater's in Burlington this beer was a hazy, rusty gold color. The one-finger, beige head displayed decent retention and good lacing. The aroma was well-defined and apropos to the style, floral hops, citrus hops, grapefruit and orange notes and a solid pale malt backbone. The flavors were totally on-the-mark for an IPA, grapefruit, pine, herbal notes, a slight spiciness, pale malt and a bold but not overpowering bitterness. The mouthfeel was semi-smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation excellent. A great go-to example of the style."
"D - Very! With a smooth aftertaste, it leaves you wanting more and most anything after. Great for hops lovers who desire something elegant but not extreme."
"Drinkability is awesome, if you're a hophead. Not too heavy, alcohol is present but nicely masked by the hops. Great hoppy IPA that really showcases the hops. I could drink these all day long."
"Taste, flavor, mouthfeel combine to produce extraordinary drinkability. This bomber likely will be empty in five more minutes."
"Pours a nice pale orangish-yellow color with a small head but left some nice lacing. Aroma is all grapefruit and light citurs olenty of orange-like citrus flavor backed up by a decent pale amlt backbone. No caramel malts her, just hoppy goodness. Taste is the samne. Bitter grapefruit rind, a bit of black pepper, sappy, semi-sweet, with a long dry finish. This is easily up there with the best of the AIPAs. I love these hop centric ones with less caramel malt and more hops. Yum."
"D - Extremely quaffable IPA that is certainly a hallmark in the echelon of the IPA kingdom. This is a fantastic entry-level IPA for someone looking to delve into the splendor of West Coast IPAs."
"Pours a light honey color with tight white head that dissipated into a light cap and left some clingy lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of juicy grapefruit, light pine, a bit of a peppery spice and a honey malt. The taste is of juicy orange hops that quickly transforms into a piney and resiny hop bitterness. All of the hop flavors a supported by a bready honey malt. A pretty serious AIPA with a bigger malt presence than most. The feel is that of a moderate body, soft to prickly carbontation and a bitter finish. The brew is bigger than your traditional AIPA. Very flavorful AIPA, though the malt presence makes this brew heavier it helps balance out the hops and adds to the drinkability."
"D: I had to stop myself from finishing my glass before I even started writing the review. American IPA might be the single most competitive style right now in craft beer and Stone sets the bar incredibly high with their version. Stone is big (among craft brewers, anyway) for a reason. They make great beer."
"Overall: Pretty drinkable IF you like hops, a bit bitter but the hop flavors make up for that. This held up really well for 2 months in the fridge, the hop character is still very prevalent."
"Overall, probably the best IPA I have ever had. Strong flavors all in balance. Just an expectional example of the style. Would have every time I had an opportunity."
"D - Overall good. What you expect an IPA to taste like, nothing too fancy. A bit over-hyped, but an easy to drink beer."
"D- Overall this beer is a good IPA but I didn't think that it lived up to the hype. I've had better ipa's. It's very drinkable though."
"Great beer. It's simplistic: hops are hops and malts are malts. Not overly complex but everything is in perfect balance allowing one to enjoy this fine beer in all it's glory. Well done."
"D: If you are a Hop Head, this is a great beer. If you are not, it's worth a shot. It does what a good, hoppy beer should do. Satisfies your taste buds and hangs around on your pallete a while."
"The hops are very dominant in this brew, as to be expected given not only that it's an IPA but that it's from Stone. A pleasant upfront grapefruit-citrus followed by a kick of hops and a lingering dryness."
"D- Perhaps it's just me but stones products always leave something to be desired and in this, the extreme bitter aftertaste is a bit much. Otherwise this is a decent ipa with a low abv"
"Taste is great, nice clean bitterness, with lots of flower/citrus notes. Smooth and well carbonated, overall a nice easy drinker. Its only too bad that I have to go all the way to WI for this one."
"Bottle poured into a regular pint glass this beer produced a hazy orange/gold color with a 2 finger head. There was some nice lacing present. The smell consisted of pine, hops, and citrus. I found the taste to be a bit of a let down as the malts far outweighed the hops. It was, however, very easy to drink and was still enjoyable."
"Overall I thought this beer was spectacular. It may not quite be as good as the sum of its parts though, since the taste was the weakest aspect of it (although it was still good). I have had multiple others that taste this good, but none that are so good across all categories. I still would prefer a Two-Hearted over this, but this may be my #2."
"drinkability: high"
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and slightly astringent. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is bitter, but in a good way. I am big fan of Stone Brewing they have never let me done so far. This a very round well bodied IPA with great flavor. This the way an IPA should taste."
"I've only really tried one other IPA (it was a Goose Island, and I polished off half of a bottle that a friend opened but disliked and I really didn't think much about it other than I'll be damned to let a craft beer go to waste at a restaurant). This Stone IPA was something else though.  A good introduction to West Coast IPAs?  It is a style that is clearly popular, but I'll have to seek out more examples to see if it grows on my palate."
"Overall Impression: This is definitely an IPA; the hops smack me in the taste buds. I was surprised aroma was not stronger (the hops seem muted) until I looked at the ""Enjoy By"" date and it read 03/31/09. This was a bit surprising as I purchased the beer in mid-March (09). I guessing the hop aroma diminished over time. Even being old, I am still enjoying the beer."
"Note: At 11.59 a six pack here in jax Florida its not the cheapest though."
"I took my first sip-- smooth as silk. Giant hop flavor, very mellow, and great balance. Not too bitter but tons of hops. Unnaturally easy to drink. Hands down my favorite IPA to date. If you don't like hops try a different brew."
"Stone IPA pours golden orangish color with a nice sized cream head. It has a pungent hop aroma with a bit of sweet malt. It has a very herbal, piney hop flavor. There is some citrus flavor in there as well. It rocks. Has a very crisp, refreshing medium mouth feel to it and it is pretty drinkable, although very high in abv for a single IPA. I would almost put it in the DIPA range if not for the brewery already having a different brew in that category."
"D- Wonderful all around brew. Lots of big hop flavor for the hopheads but it is balanced well with the malt and citrus flavors."
"Bitter fruit rinds linger, so you'll definitely want to cleanse your palate if this isn't the last beer you're drinking. Great pale ale, and I'm resisting the urge to go and get more of it right now."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. I could probably drink a couple of these on a summer afternoon. It's just plain good."
"Taste has a nice balance between hops and the malt, not overly hoppy as to ""ruin"" your taste buds but enough to please, easy to drink, above average for an IPA although nothing truly stands out."
"So the moral of this story is drink fresh!"
"This beer poured a cloudy copper color with orange highlights and a fluffy single-finger head. The smell is all different kinds of hops, it's herbal, floral, citrusy, and spicy along with a little bready malt. The taste starts off with some spicy hops that give way to some citrusy hops that give way to some piney hops that fade away into a surprisingly clean finish. The whole time there's also a sweet malt backbone that helps balance out the hops without overshadowing them. The mouthfeel has a little bit of thickness and and just the right amount of carbonation. One of the big surprises for me is how drinkable this beer is. Even though it's definitely hoppy I couldn't imagine holding on to a six-pack of this brew for more than an afternoon. A fantastic beer, a must try for anyone on this site."
"I'm pouring my bottle into a tall pilsner glass. (I need new glassware) This beer's got a bright orange/gold color and is quite transparent. Good and thick big-bubbled also. It smells awesome. Definitely hoppy but nicely mixed with a fruity paring and possibly a bit of bready. A little citrusy and spicey. An excellent combination of aromas. I don't think it can be improved upon. Heavy hop and pine flavor with a touch of sour. Not too much sour to be unpleasant, however. Contrasts of sweet fruit, bitter hops, grapefruit, pine, and malt all exist in the flavor to create a pretty damn good beer. Medium body, a little creamy, and a joy to sip down. Pine cone aftertaste... But that's expected with the style. This is one of the better IPAs out there."
"Pours a soft amber with very sticky white head that shrinks into beautiful lacework on the glass. Hop oils aboud in the nose, very nice florals especially. Could sniff this all day. This is a well balanced IPA featuring a gentle malt profile with bits of toffee and caramel. Leaves a nice citrusy after taste as the hop oil does it's work. Bit of pineapple maybe? Very easy mouthfeel and low ABV make this an excellent session beer. I want another now."
"- Very drinkable.. bit bubbly.. not so much strength in flavor, hides it well. Session? Possibly on a night where I wouldn't have to get up early the next morning :-)"
"This beer pours a nice honey color with a nice fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. The smell is very clean upfront with grapefruit and other citrus flavors. The smell is not upfront and in your face which is neither good or bad. The taste is much more agressive than the smell with big grapefruit and other citrus flavors. The mouthfeel is a tad thin for my likening but this beer is just so smooth and easy to drink that I hardly notice. I think I am simply comparing to other Midwest/east coast IPA's like hopslam or dogfish head that have that syrupy quality that I enjoy. Overall this is an exellent IPA that belongs to my long list of favoite IPA's. A must try."
"This is one great IPA and is it ever drinkable. A six could be gone by the end of the night easily but then I'd be unhappy without my Stones."
"and again..."
"Overall: A very good IPA, perhaps bordering on a ""double"" or ""extreme"" IPA. This one seems to be on the far end of the IPA spectrum, but taken in and of itself, is quite good. Recommended."
"Overall- Feel as if it lived up to expectation."
"Drinkability: A great beer. Blends honey and citrus in a creamy warming beer. One bottle is enough for me with the higher alcohol content and massive bottle."
"D: I could take down a sixer of this quite easily!"
"The mouthfeel and drinkability of this beer are both quite high. Very bitter, oily, just enough carbonation to wash it all away. Excellent beer."
"This one's a Keepa!. A must have on hand! Do yourself a favor and get a couple sixers at once."
"A full bodied IPA thats resinous and a little sticky and clean at the same time. This beer is very bitter to my palate and although I enjoyed it could not drink to much of this beer.A fantastic example of an American IPA."
"Sadly, though it seemed promising, I don't see myself revisiting this one."
"Notes: By far one of the best IPA's out there."
"Drinkability is very good, this may become my go to Summer IPA. I wish I had bought more than just the the one to review!"
"I love the way those hops linger. This is a very nice IPA. The hopping is nicely balanced, so it's quite drinkable. I like this beer an awful lot."
"Given it's bold taste, I still feel that this is a very good beer and you could drink this for a night easily."
"D- With its crisp finish, delicious taste, and a not too heavy feel I could easily have a few of these, but not worth having more than 3 as the delicious taste will be for not after you have burned your taste buds"
"Overall: Fine mouthfeel, well carbonated and oily. Pretty drinkable, no alcohol comes through and the taste isn't overpowering."
"While the hops did not taste as fresh as they did when I had this beer on tap, it was still delicious."
"M: medium bodied for the style. perfect carbonation level. sharp, yet subtle. very clean and crisp."
"Overall a solid, drinkable IPA."
"D - Hmmm, you know, I think I realize that I find this more drinkable after I've already had a couple other beers. At my favorite bar, this is my go-to beer, yet it seems less eminently drinkable here at home, in the bottle."
"One of the best IPAs that I have ever tried, hell, one of the best beers I've ever tried. A great spicey hop taste that is just what you would expect from a good IPA but is also quite drinkable."
"Poured a orange with a very thing head. Smells of citrus and grapefuit just like I want it to. really nice fruit taste on the front end, not the biggest hop bomb, not the most complex IPA, but such a clean, structure taste it's hard to find fault in the simpleness. Here is a case where simple really works. Just a touch thin on the mouthfeel, not watered down, just a little thin. Still I could drink this all day and would be extremely happy the entire time. A classic that deserves every ounce of praise it gets."
"Mouthfeel is just a touch thin but that doesn't detract substantially from a highly drinkable beer. I will always come back to this one."
"Bottled deliciousness! This pours a cloudy orange with ample bosom. Smell is of citrus hop aromas. Taste is primarily of grapefruit bitterness with a sweet biscuity backbone. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a dry finish. Drinkability is perfect. This IPA is the best of its style I have yet to enjoy."
"The bottle says it all when it comes to hoppiness. Great strong hops aroma and powerful hop taste. All of this balanced perfectly to create one of the best beers I have had. When I poured this one into a glass. It had decent head retention and some decent lacing. Pretty standard india pale ale color. Over all I am very impressed by Stone as always. Arrogant Bastard might still be my favorite but this one's close. Great buy, worth every penny."
"I tend to go for its bigger brother, but it is still a nice single IPA. I did consume this beer 26 days before its enjoy by date, so I think the smell and taste were altered by that fact. I will go and revisit with an even fresher bottle."
"D: smooth drinking and no bitter aftertaste. It warms in the belly a bit."
"Notes: was expecting a little more out of the highly respected IPA. YOURE not worthy for ME!"
"Note* I purchased these a couple of months after bottling and they were sitting warm on the shelf the whole time. The hops weren't quite as assertive as I hoped. I look forwarding to reviewing a fresher bottle someday to see what differences there may be. Regardless it was an excellent beer and can't wait for another sixer."
"It was the first Stone brew I have tried, but it won't be the last. Up to now I have taken a pass because of the price and because I am not a fan of the packaging (I know that is lame, but when there are so many good choices you need some excuse not to try something new)."
"Golden tangerine body, no head, possibly my pour, with dotted light lacing as it drops. Awesome aroma of woody malt, spicy fruity hops. Spicy hop up front, bitter center, lingering bitter finish. Crisp and sweet at times with a zesty peel that boxes the sides of the tongue. Excellent clarity and a well hidden ABV. Hints of malt sap and grapefruit. Ridiculous balance and confident hop character. One of the best."
"I'd def. drink another."
"Light amber with one finger head with a great aroma: fresh hops right off the vine, some light herbal in the background. Crisp and refreshing in taste, hops but not on the attack, slight grass and herbal notes, dry finish. Great light carbonated mouthfeel, light body. Highly drinkable for any season."
"d-101%. more sips suggest insane food pairings: calamari, garlic gread, etouffe, oysters and tabasco...throw out the dixie, please..."
"D- Excellent! Stone pulls it off again. They can hop the hell out of a brew but balance it out just right. This brew goes down way too easy for it's IBU and ABV levels. Without a doubt, one of the gold standard beers for the American IPA style."
"D: Not for the faint of heart. This beer is definitely for a Hop Head, as it pretty much meets the perfect definition of and IPA"
"Drinkability: Standard for the style. It probably wasn't a good idea to rate this soon after Nugger Nectar, because NN kind of puts this to shame, but this is still a great beer."
"Overall - A excellent, straightforward, hoppy IPA... recommended..."
"Pours out a very clear golden color with a nice 1-2cm white head. This one leaves great lacing, even after the head has fallen down to a little ring of bubbles. Looks really great, but it seems just a little bit lighter than I'd like to see an IPA. The smell is nice, some floral, citrusy, grassy hops. Actually quite a bit of hop resin in the smell. Almost leans towards a DIPA smell. Not really much maltiness to speak of, maybe just a whiff of sweetness. It's about what anyone would expect from an IPA. The taste seems to be a bit more bitter than a standard IPA, which is my main complaint, but there's enough of the hop flavor and aroma to fill in. This one isn't incredibly balanced, I can barely detect any sweet, malty backbone, and I can't taste the alcohol at all. The mouthfeel is nice, the bitterness makes you pucker and hesitate. I think this is lost somewhere between an IPA and DIPA, I like it but I'm not sure how well to either style it actually is. This one is very dry, like I would expect, with nothing standing in the way of the hoppy taste. This one really drinks well for almost 7%. You just keep taking drink after drink, and it is definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability- extraordinary, a great beer that is an amazing session to me even though decently high alc level, a golden example of the ipa, great beer i will always be having time to time"
"On tap at Baker's Street Grill and Bar. Poured a reddish-tan color with a decent head that left nice lacing throughout consumption. Smelled very hoppy, grapefruit, pine and sweet notes. Tasted hoppy, again sort of grapefruit, pine and almost a little too sweet. Good malt mixture in there as well. Overall a good go to IPA, however the sweetness coming off the hops makes the drinkability of it for me, a little too much to make it a staple."
"Overall, very pleased with my first Stone experience, will definitely have again."
"d 4 nice example of a chinooked ipa. not as assertive as i anticipated, but quite drinkable particularly considering the abv."
"From 22 oz. bottle into tulip at brew pub. Clear amber color with medium off-white head. Good lacing remaining throughout. Very hoppy - pine/citrus and bitter through the finish. Review is of last half of bottle as the first pour included a slight aroma of bleach. This from a respected brew pub - I did not complain, just let it sit awhile. I will say it dampened my excitement immediately for my first taste of Stone IPA. Overall very enjoyable - Cheers!"
"Very good drinkable beer and good with mild/medium cigar."
"Pours a golden yellow with kaki head that recedes but forms a nice lace. Smell is wonderful piney grapefruit. Taste is big hops instantly. Crisp and clean. Not over-the-top but hoppy. After taste is pretty peppery. Tastes like centenials which I'm kind of over. Good beer could use some variation in the hops."
"Drinkability is so/so. It's hardly a session beer but great for hop fiends."
"Great flavor and hoppy taste, but not liking the price tag."
"The first thing I observed was the cool looking green gargoyle bottle. Poured from that into my snifter. Golden pale color, moderate head disippating into a light layer over the brew. Smelled like hop-a-mania, very nice. The taste was even more hops, hops and hops. I agree with a few other reviewers - kind of one dimensional. Although a good dimension. Mouthfeel and drinkability were average for the style. When I'm in the mood for hops I could go for this one for sure."
"Phenomenal. It pours a magnificently clear pale color with an awesome head that leavs great lace and has pretty good retention. The aroma and flavor have one of the cleanest, most pure hop flavors I have experienced. It has a nice bitterness to it, which is balanced nicely with a slight maltiness. I could drink this beer all day/ night long. Perfectly balanced. Awesome."
"At 6.9 percent, you can have a few, but it is a little one dimensional with its hop focus."
"stone ipa looks good out of the bottle great straw/orange color with good lacing... after that everything is just a bit above average the smell and taste is ok and drinkable.. it is smooth and a good beer ... but i think it is overrated. the hops are bitter/weak and the pine, grapefruit, and citrus aromas are just not there as i would expect from a"" legendary"" IPA. this is still a decent IPA...just not one i would keep on rotation.. but still try it if you can find it"
"D: Pretty good"
"This is a good beer, but it's kind of weak for an IPA."
"I enjoyed this one from the bottle more perhaps because it was fresher. Either way, it's both smooth and drinkable without being boring. Still not as good as Ruination. I look forward to finding that on draught some day!"
"This beer is highly drinkable...its just so smooth. The bitterness is great and what I look for in an IPA. Damn shame the beer was gone well before I had finished my review. Guess that means its time for round 2."
"Overall an excellent beer, hoppy to the core, a very solid IPA"
"This beer pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into a small head of lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, oranges, and pine resin. The taste like the aroma with a nice lingering bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a nice IPA. It doesn't really stand out from most other IPAs, but it is bold and flavorful which is enough for my liking."
"D - This is a nice drinking beer, but the alcohol hit means I'd probably only drink a couple at a sitting. Still, a very flavorful brew as I always expect from Stone."
"Overall - a good American IPA. Hops dominate as they should."
"Very drinkable and refreshing. Alcohol presence is minimal but is packed with flavor."
"Mouthfeel is a spicy, with some faint fruit flavors coming through, like orange, evening out the balance. Drinkability is good on the Stone IPA, however I do not understand why some hype this selection from them. Very good brew, but not great."
"This is a great IPA, I love the crispness of the taste and the serious hops."
"D - Dry finish leaves you a bit puckered, wouldn't be easy to drink too many of these in a row."
"This is the real deal. Nothing out of the ordinary, but flawlessly crafted."
"Overall there's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said. If you have access to Stone do yourself a favor and revisit this beer."
"D - If you love hot hops, you wouldn't want to stop drinking this west coast offering."
"Taste starts off with clean, lightly sweet caramel malt and lightly astringent hops, with a finish that allows the fresh citrus to really shine, and a lighter than expected bitterness lingering on the palate. The overall result is an utterly fantastic IPA - not overpowering, refreshing, flavorful, and one of the most drinkable IPA's I've ever had. Emphasizes the flavor of the hops, rather than just the bitterness. Superb balance."
"For the strength of this beer, I was expecting something a bit bigger, hoppier and bitter. Ruination pulls off the style a bit better, but this is still a good brew."
"Poured in a shaker pint. Medium off white creamy colored head. Well carbonated. Slightly cloudy deep gold color. Perfumy aroma, sweet and floral. Starts moderately citrusy, bitter, becoming maltier throught the middle. Mild ethanol. Finish is citric and floral."
"Outstanding."
"When my dad (who loves IPAs) comes out from Philly to visit, Ill have a sixer of this as well as Firestone IPA and Green Flash IPA waiting for him. Cream of the CA crop, IMO."
"Well, the alcohol is a kick in the balls. Couldn't decide on this or Ruination and chose this because of alcohol level. Well, that was dumb, as another 1% wouldn't have mattered. I'll have one more out of the six and be done with it tonight. If a little less boozy, this would be a regular for me."
"I certainly enjoyed this beer, but to be honest I would save a couple bucks and pick up Sierra Nevada Anniversary Ale for a much better taste and a more drinkable offering. This beer can be described in three words: spicy, spicy, spicy. I drank two of these on Saturday night and that was about all I could handle. The spice is just slightly overwhelming for me. Maybe I'm not as much of a hophead as I thought. There is a very obvious scent of grapefruit. You can certainly taste the alcohol, and it does kind of hit you after a couple. All in all, I wouldn't buy this beer again just because it isn't overly drinkable. But, once again, I wouldn't turn down a free one."
"Drinkability: I live a good IPA, so I would put this high. I don't know how much I'd care to drink in one night at 6.9% ABV, it'd likely knock me over."
"Notes: A wonderful AIPA! This is like perfect! A very impressive beer. Right up there with Titan IPA in my opinion"
"one of my favorite all-time beers. definitely recommended."
"Overall this is a decent IPA, not my favorite but by no means is it as offensive and damaging to the palette as I thought it would be."
"Lastly, this beer had perfect carbonation and the bitterness lent itself to a slight chewiness."
"Pours a golden color with a big frothy head that leaves great lacing on my pint glass. Smell is of citrusy hops and a little malt. Taste is good with a big slap of hops and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Very nice beer that is very drinkable."
"D - Being thick and full of character, I could only have a couple of these - but in the way you would a decadent dessert."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Great IPA, very good on the drinkability scale as it is tasty and not harsh, if just a tad too high on the ABV scale for sessioning."
"A great beer with great hop action, but I will continue towards IIPAs when I need my hops."
"First taste bites you like sinking your teeth into a lemon, and I always love that first explosion of IPA flavor. The piney promise of the aroma comes through as well. Bitter, bitter aftertaste, but an adequate, malty/biscuity backbone balances things out. I've had it out of both the 22oz and 12oz bottles. Both are delicious, but the 22oz flavors seemed more delicate. Either way, you've got to try this beer. Creamy mouthfeel, not light, not heavy and very refreshing. Good medium-low carbonation. This beer is absolutely delicious, one of the best IPAs out there."
" Overall a great beer, very easy to drink because of the light, clean feeling it leaves behind. Definitely worth drinking on a regular basis."
"Overall, the Stone IPA is definitely worth trying and maybe even making it your regular ""buy every week"" beer."
"D- What a beer. Easily my new go-to IPA. Alcohol cannot be detected at all. Great beer."
" D: Like all the brews i have tried from stone after you get a taste for the first bottle ya cant stop drinkin them"
"D-This is one of the best IPA's I've had,not overly hoppy but enough that their presence is known.This is a must try for any beer fan."
"This is just a damn fine IPA."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer if you like hops. It gives the exact components of a good IPA and I will enjoy this again when I can get my hands on it."
"Any complaints here are minor quibbles really, but this beer just doesn't have the intensity of their Ruination IPA, even though it's not that much smaller. I'd order the Ruination over this anytime, but it's still a very good second choice."
"D: A very nice IPA. I hope to visit this one again."
"Like I said, this was not the same beer that everyone else here tasted. I will definitely try this one again, and give a fairer review."
"A very high drinkability, I could put away a few of these easy."
"All bow down to the beer gods...Thank you Stone for this, this liquid poem of great beer. I wish I could put into words how much I love this beer. It is my all time favorite beer. Everything about it is great, the slight caramel taste it starts with, followed by a twinge of metallic, finishing with a slap in the face of hops...Also got to love the fact that its 6.9 abv. I love that 2 or 3 of these and I'm feeling really good...Thank you Stone..."
"Hands down my favorite IPA right now. Very clean, sweet, and hoppy. Nice citrus and hop aroma. Cloudy light amber color, almost looks like a hefeweizen. Moderate carbonation. I cant express in words how much I love this beer. If you don't like this IPA, buy a six pack of Smirnoff Ice and rent The Notebook."
"D: I am enjoying this beer so much, that I was ready to rate the drinkability extremely high. Then I looked at my half-full pint glass and half full bomber and realized that this beer will take me a while, probably leaving me exhausted and not wanting another tonight."
"Served in straight pint glass. A beautiful bright, clear gold color. Minimal head that dissipated quickly, leaving a very sticky lacing. Pleasing floral hop aroma. Flavor has a strong, smooth, even hop presence. This is not a bitter IPA, but still delivers a strong hop blast. One of the strongest points with this IPA is balance. The body is just slightly on the thin side.This beer has the backbone to stand up to the hops. This a very drinkable IPA that, due to the smoothness and balance can truly be sessionable. This is not a tongue-burner, you won't suffer from palate fatigue as with lesser IPAs. This is a go-to beer for me, it can always be counted on to deliver a great beer experience."
"Delicious and an outstanding pick for a hophead. Highly drinkable, this one is yet another great offering from one of the most highly-rated breweries in the country."
"This was a good IPA. Not the best I've had but certainly close to the top tier."
"D: This tastes awesome, and is a big, aggressive beer. My first Stone product and I'll be very curious to try the rest of their line after this first foray. A sipper, but an easy sipper all things considered."
"poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, poured a hazy golden color with a frothy white head. smells strongly of hops and a bit of spices. taste is mostly of hops, citrus, spices and a little bit sweet. mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied, this beer is very drinkable and the almost 7% abv is hardly noticeable."
"Quite nice and much preferred over the more available standard draft given the body of the beer."
"I went to Richmond and visited total wine witht the intention of tasting some brews I cannot get in Missouri-where I go to school. Anything from Stone was high on my list. This ale did not live up to its reputation. Apearance and smell were average. A nice hoppy aroma was very apparant signalling a good IPA. The taste was average as well. The ale seemed to possess no balance. The consistency was very light,which I did not like. It was hoppy enough for an IPA, but something did not click for me. Other IPA's, such as those put out by Great Divide and Avery, are more to my taste. I was excited about this ale and almost wonder if I got a bad bottle of the IPA and Smoked Porter, considering the rave reviews they recieve."
"Great IPA much more drinkable then celebration ale. Golden in appearence nice head rentation when poured aggressivly. Very sticky. smell is very nice prototypical extreme IPA. Spicy hops, grapefruit, pinnapple, kind of a medicinal sent. Taste is spicy hops and fruit. Warms you up pretty good half way through consumption. recommended IPA and i would go as far as saying its just a little bit better then celebration due to its drinkablity."
"I got to pick up a 6 pack of this on a recent trip out west. Great IPA, lots of hops up front and lingering afterwards. It is one of the lightest colored IPAs I've drunk, nice and bubbly in the glass. In spite of almost 7% alcohol it was very drinkable; polishing off a couple before dinner only whet the appetite for more. I'd buy this often if it were available where I live."
"Great IPA. Pours a nice hazy golden amber with a thick, fluffy, fine-bubbled head that laces the glass nicely as I drink. Aroma is hoppy with a hint of pine to it.. Flavor is rich and very hoppy, pleasantly bitter and pineish with just a touch of caramel sweetness. Finish is edgy and lively. A nice hoppy beer."
"Notes: This is one fantastic IPA. Once again, Stone doesn't disappoint. Hop domination is the goal here, but the underlying malt makes it all possible. Delicious hop flavors just seem to dance on the tongue, but isn't one-dimensional due to the supporting flavors that add some depth. Highly recommended"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - It's a big beer with lots of hops but very smooth. One really hoppy beer usually satisfies my hop yearning, but I could do one or two more of these right now."
"I wish I wasn't reviewing the last bottle of my 6-pack!"
"taste is creamy yet crisp, grapefruit, lemon, bitter hops, slightly metallic, grass, and danelion, bit on the watery side as it warms, leaves mouth dry, ends bitter."
"Mouthfeel: Medium body, very smooth, very nice fruity aftertaste."
"D - Very tasty and easy to drink."
"A golden straw color with a fluffy white head,some soft lazy carbonation.Big hoppy aroma of floral citrus and spice .Big hops on the flavor,strait to the point some grapefruit,pine nuts,and orange zest,enough malt to make a showing here,nice fat crisp mouthfeel,with a hop coating. A thing of beauty"
"This is my new favorite IPA"
"Typical west coast hop bomb. Not quite as great as Ruination, (a little less potent for one thing), but not a whole hell of a lot behind it either. Nice little malty beginning before the hops hammer you down, a sensation that is occasionally very refreshing in a west coaster."
"Overall this is an excellent IPA. No surprise that Stone brewed another winner."
"D- really good if you're a hophead. i like to keep things in balance, so i doubt i could session this all night (and i'd end up on the lawn) but it's so good I'm sure people do all the time."
"this beer goes down great, good example of the style, it will probally be a staple in my fridge."
"I very much like this beer...the only thing keeping this from a higher rating is appearance and color...this is a bit lackluster...but close your eyes, and this is a true winner."
"D: I find IPA's very drinkable in general. The more balanced and subtle nature of this one makes it a very easy beer to session. I am going to get this in future to see if it has a stronger hop aggressiveness that was missing from my 6."
"Another fantastic beer from Stone Brewing Co, you wont be disappointed. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is very good along with the easy drinking of this beer. A great IPA."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"(rated Mar 28, 2007)"
"The only downside is the price tag. Would enjoy more if they were priced more along its peers (ex: dogfish). That aside, its worth every penny, therefore I splurge when the Gargoyle calls."
"D: Good drinkability. Well balanced, not overpowering. Solid."
"D: The 6.9% ABV is hidden very well. If it were a little lower, this would be a perfect session beer. I tried this awhile back, and was slightly underwhelmed, but that was probably not fresh enough. This is an excellent kid brother to Ruination. I'm going to be drinking a lot more of this in the future."
"One of my favorites. Average for Stone's standards; big hops flavor with citrus backing that does not let up. Crisp bitter end. If you like IPA's and have not tried this, you are a tool. Go to the store now, buy one, and you will definitely enjoy it."
"I think this beer has the best possible appearance, that's why i gave it a 5.0 score on appearance. and the smell, taste, mouthful and drinkability aren't far behind. This is, by far, the best IPA i've had in quite some time. Again, the appearance, and the way it pours into a long fluted glass, makes you want to sit down and just stare at its beauty before taking that first taste."
"D - An excellent, easily drinkable IPA. The hop oils are center stage in this beer and while the bitterness is nothing to scoff at, they clearly made the right decision by going for flavor and aroma instead of just bone crushing bitterness. The hop aroma and, more importantly IMO, flavor have a crisp, fresh character that keeps the beer drinkable and avoid the muddy, mouth coating hoppiness that some big IPAs fall prey to. Overall, an excellent, and unusually drinkable, example of the style."
"Bottle. Wow, this is good. Hoptastic aroma. I want to bathe in this. Pour it all over me. Taste is amazing. Heavy hops, but not totally unbalanced. Very quenching. I could drink a few, and that's what makes a great beer. I will definitely be drinking this again."
"D - Great. This is a very easy drinking beer that I could put down quite a few times if I wanted to. The only downside is a lingering hop taste that takes a while to go away."
"Reviewed on: 01-27-2008 14:59:11"
"Overall: Why drink this when you could have a solid Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA? Probably wont go out of my way to buy this again. But all in all, Good."
"Pours a light golden color into my pint glass, leaving a moderate white head that lingers for a couple of minutes. Leaves some nice sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly hoppy, with pine and a touch of sweet malt. Not a real powerful aroma for an IPA, but very nice nonetheless. Tastes mostly hoppy, but the hops don't dominate the taste. The hops are nicely complemented by the malt and pine, and a nice bitterness follows. The taste is very well balanced and doesn't have a powerful hoppy bite. Light to medium bodied and doesn't leave a whole lot of stick in the mouth. This IPA is nice and smooth and goes down real easy. I've only recently ""found"" Stone Brewery and have been very impressed so far. This IPA is another great beer by Stone."
"D - Very nice session beer. I am looking forward to drinking many more of these in the form of 6 packs cause a bomber just wasn't enough."
"One of the best IPAs I've ever had. Pours deep and golden, leaves a thick, lingering lace. Grassy, hoppy aroma, great hoppy flavor with a slightly cheesey, yeasty finish. You absolutely must try this beer- even if you don't like IPAs you will appreciate it. The fact that these are readily available in a six pack is proof that God exists."
"Pours golden amber, with a nice white head... tons of lacing. Aroma is hops... that's about all you can say for the aroma... they are all there... floral, piney, spicy... all of them. Flavor is balanced, even though there are tons of hops... mouthfeel is just about right for an IPA... not too thin, almost syrupy with hops... a nice burn from the alcohol, carbonation, and spiciness of hops. Stone doesn't make bad beers..."
"Very drinkable."
"Ahhh...good old Stone. These guys just kick ass at just about everything they do, and they are even cocky about it. I just had a Racer 5, and wanted to compare the two to each other. Racer is super great, but I must say I prefer the Stone IPA. It is really really great, can't say its perfect, as i prefer a little more intense nose, but seriously its great! Pours a nice light copper, almost orangeish, nose is a little yeast and piney hops, and the taste rich and varied between bitter hops, and just enough alcohol to taste it, maybe some citrus fruit and light honey."
"From what I understand this IPA is legen wait for it dary and I was not disappointed. Nice bright golden tan color with tantilizing thick head. Smells like heaven that is if heaven is a hop factory. Unbelievable hoppy, bittery flavor with hints of caramel and I think pine cones. Feels great to drink not to thick or carbonated and after you drink it you feel like a hop breathing dragon. I would like to drink these all day but in reality I could probably only handel two or three in a sitting. Looking forward to many more of these tasty treats."
"Awesome, cheap, and available (outside Illinois) - what more do you want from a brew?"
"Another brilliant brew from Stone. Pours a hazy amber color with a frothy white head. This beer is dominated by hops but is balanced out by a sweetness that doesn't make it too bitter. Not as good as their Ruination IPA but excellent for a single IPA."
"Bottle at Mad Mex (Monroeville, PA). Pours an amber/orange, very slightly cloudy. Aroma is the classic IPA citrus and hops notes. Hops get you on the initial sip, but in a good way, not overpowering. Grapefruit-pine-citrus-hops. Will try this one again."
"stone is not available in illinois, atleast not to my knowledge so a buddy of mine picked me up on a trip to ohio. the look of it is great, has a nice slightly orangish/gold cloudyness to it with a nice fluffy white head, and it smells flipping great, just a wonderful cascade of hop aroma, very light and not overpowering earthy hopness to it. taste is great too, just a fulll bodied flavor, not to strong, not to light flavor, it is one of the easiest to drink ipa's too, alot of your really really strong ipa's are hard to get through the bottle cause of the bitterness or the alcohol but this one is an absolute world class beer. just wish it were available locally"
"Good, solid IPA with dense head and strong lacing. Smells slightly piney but mostly beery, a little yeast. Taste is mostly hops, bitter with a slight jasmine background. Mouthfeel is great, light on the tongue, and very easy to drink. Stone makes some nice beers."
"This is a solid IPA. To me, not one to write home about, but very good. When my first homebrew IPA, based off a clone recipe for this beer, came pretty close to this I was stoked. But there are many IPA's I prefer to this one. That said, I have at least one friend who thinks it is the gold standard of the style."
"Bottle from College Liquors in Grand Junction, CO. Pours a clear golden color with a medium white head. The aroma is awesome; loads of sweet hops, juicy and ripe. The taste is just insanely quaffable; sweet grapefruit hops, some light bitterness in the finish, very clean and super easygoing. One of the best IPAs."
"Stone IPA pours amber with yellow highlights and a rocky white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is a bit on the sweet end, a bit of pineapple perhaps. The flavor is quite nice, the malt holds its own, but the hops are the show here. Floral and a bit piney. Very enjoyable."
"Bottle at home from my Great Brittish Beer Festival haul ... Colour is amber with pretty much no head ...light sweet hop nose ... Big malty front with a long juicy pine hop linger ... quite dry ... more like i expect froma pale ale than a IPA... Ok but not really hitting the spot for me"
"Love this beer and it will be a staple in my mix of IPA's from now on."
"Very good taste, although, due to it being an IPA, I don't know about how many I could drink in a night. I would recommend this IPA over 85% of the other ones that I have had."
"Overall, a very impressive beer....will have many more times in the future."
"D - Very hoppy beers are not what I normally go for, but I do enjoy them for a change of pace. This beer took care of my hops hunger. :) Overall very pleased."
"D: Hands down my favorite session IPA very delicious, nicely balanced, and downright tasty. I like it a lot more on tap than from the bottle, but it is still a great beer."
"First, I an NOT a hophead so this isn't a beer I would purchase, it was given to me by a friend who didn't like it. Having said that this wasn't a bad experience. It poured an slightly hazy orange tan into a pint glass, produced a nice 2 finger head that stuck around for awhile. Of course it had a very hoppy aroma with overtones of floral and citrus. I was surprised by the flavor, while the hop flavor was pronounced it was well balanced by a touch of malt sweetness.Thought the carbonation was on the spot and the brew went down easy. But I dont think this a beer I could drink more than one or two of in a sitting."
"Very drinkable. This breew exemplifies the excelence I've come to expect from Stone."
"Good Beer. Pours a nice hazy golden amber with a thick, buttery, fine-bubbled head. Aroma is hoppy with a hint of pine to it.. Flavor is rich and seriously hoppy, pleasantly bitter and evergreenish with just a touch of caramel sweetness. Finish is edgy and lively. A nice hoppy beer."
"Not too bad of a mouthfeel. Crisp, clean, tasty."
"Very drinkable if it weren't for the high alcohol content. I wouldn't have more than two in a night - I don't want that Stone gargoyle laughing at me."
"I can drink a couple of these in a session, but then it just ruins my palette for any beer that doesn't pack the same wallop as this."
"The pour creates a body that is amber in appearance, and has an average off-white head. A very hoppy aroma with some floral scents. Has a malty flavor, is slightly sweet, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Very hoppy taste. Damn good!"
"I've never enjoyed an IPA so much that didn't qualify as a double/imperial."
"D - This is an outstanding IPA. It really is masterfully balanced for a great taste."
"Pours a light brown with a lacy tan head. The nose has a nice collection of floral hops and sweet fruity malts. Well balanced flavor profile. The malt variety really compliments the bitter hops. Medium body is well carbonated. A great IPA from Stone."
"Reviewed on November 4, 2008 while watching McCain get whooped. This country is going to hell!"
"Poured from bomber to Mug a dense cloudy apricot color with a thick cream head that settled to a 1/4 inch throughout with heavy lacing. Smells of sweet fruity hopsice. Taste is heavily hopped but the bitterness is minimal and it is very smooth. I will have this again and again. Stone is one of my top 3 breweries in the US and this one confirms their supremecy."
"Damn god American IPA here, maybe one of the better I've had. Really wanna try it on tap, to get away from this yeast in the bottle thing I'm unfamiliar with. While a lot of other people are saying this is a session beer and/or they could drink a shitload of these. They should note the fairly high 6.9% ABV and probably limit themselves :) Its a great beer though and one could find it easy to overlook this logic."
"D: Pour me another. One beer can easily turn into a session."
"22oz bomber from The Lighthouse in Manchester, Maine. Pours a hazy yellow-amber with a thin film of off-white head that leaves some lace. Smells amazing - orange, grapefruit etc hops dominate for sure with just the slightest hint of malt. Bright citrussy hops dominate the flavor - orange, grapfruit, and slight pith. Slight caramel and biscuit malt help to make the hops not overpowering. Nonetheless, hops dominate and create perhaps one of the finest hop flavors in any beer I've ever had. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. An easier drinker than expected, considering the ABV and big flavor. Perhaps one of the finest IPAs I have ever had. Phenomenal in almost every way."
"I was able to get this on tap at my local pub, i have had it before in a bottle when i lived in california. The color is a orange almost red and smells citrusy with a hint of pine in there...i love stone and there ipa is my favorite so this is a great beer. the taste is great also"
"I really like this beer. It is well balanced and highly drinkable. It will be hard to keep this on hand as it is oh so tasty."
"D - Love this beer. Definately will pick up a 6 pack or two next time I goto the store."
"At 6.9%, I would still drink this stuff all night if I could just get someone around here to carry the elusive 6-packs. I can never have enough of this amazing stuff."
"Greenflash, Smuttynose and Stone IPA. Don't miss any of these."
"D: A solid and highly drinkable IPA but I just want something more, maybe it's just heightened expectations for the beer, but I swear there are better IPAs out there than this one. I mean it is still a great beer, but there are better ones out there and closer to me."
"Drinkability: High ABV but still tasty and medium bodied so its easy to have more than 1. Was surprised how easy this was to drink. Recommended"
"Overall a very nice example of a west coast IPA."
"D - Very drinkable, goes down well alone or with food"
"Though a toss up, I think I might just prefer Smuttynose or Founder's Centennial; of course my Smutty's are fresher since they don't travel across the country. Regardless, a lovely IPA and one I'll certainly enjoy again."
"Pours a nice hazy golden amber with a thick, buttery, fine-bubbled head. Aroma is hoppy to the point of being piny. Flavor is rich and seriously hoppy, pleasantly bitter and evergreenish with just a touch of caramel sweetness. Finish is edgy and lively. A hop lover's delight."
"This one seems all over the place , perhaps it's me and exposure to more IPA's out there. At one time it was my standard IPA. Decent stuff I suppose, but I don't like the nose and the taste is onlt slightly above average. Honestly I prefer a simple Hop Devil to Stone, and Racer 5, and Modus, 2 Hearted blow it away. I'd take a bottle, but won't buy another 6, Ruination although a Double is far superior. Maybe it's just inconsistent or badly handled, could also be a Total Wine problem they buy in such volume no telling how long it sits is a hot warehouse or trailer. Maybe a Bestway trip is needed."
"I felt the beer was dry, but not overly so, which certainly highlighted the hops. It has a slight bready quality that reminds me of Anchor or Bear Republic pales. Perhaps they use the Liberty yeast. Not sure. Good beer; really good."
"I used a mug. And if you've ever googled the word ""beer"" (as we all have) and saw a photograph of the perfect mug with a deep amber/orange (slightly hazy) body and a huge frothy head that stayed almost forever... That's what this looked like. It was love at first sight. Hops immediately present in the nose with a rich body (chomping through all the remaining foam) and slick, full mouthfeel. For an IPA, this was not overly hopped. In fact, I commented on the remarkable hops presence that is perfectly balanced with a rich buttery malt underneath. These guys deserve their reputation. This beer is marvelous."
"Greatful that the Stone series is available in Maine."
"Definitely a quality IPA, not overpowering in the hop category but enough to let you know they are there. Several other subtle nuances that I cant quite put a finger on."
"D: Drinks well. I could definitely go for this with or without food, but it would accompany a good meat and bread feast nicely, such as a good burger."
"Drinkability: A go-to IPA for any occasion. Represents the west coast well."
"Drinkability: One of the staples, and one of the best-balanced IPAs out there, with lots to admire on both sides, and enough bite to keep the hopheads happy."
"D: Good example of the style, will get again. Only had a half-pint with dinner at a cafe near my place, so I definitely want to revisit my review after another try."
"D - If you're a hop head.. this is for you. Wow. easy drinking not to bitter."
"pours a wonderful copper with a fairly substantial head. aroma is very pronounced, mostly citrus and floral hops. Taste is bold and hoppy, but just the right balance for an IPA. This beer is a perfect example of the style as far as I am concerned. Will get it whenever possible."
"Medium-bodied with fine carbonation, Stone's IPA is all that I've heard it was, and everything it should be. Superb drinkability."
"Overall, this is a really good beer, though I wasn't quite as impressed as I expected."
"Definitely an easy beer to recommend, and I'd buy/drink it again."
"D: Like most of the Stone beers I've tried, this is very drinkable. It goes down easy and has a well balanced taste."
"Will have another!"
"A hop heads IPA for sure. It goes down very easy which makes it a great session brew."
"I'd buy this again and recommend it. SurlySober left this at my house, and I have no idea where he got it."
"D. Very drinkable. This would be a great beer with a very spicy meal. This will be a staple in my fridge!!!"
"D: Goes down rather smoothly, though full of hop bitterness (which is boasted about on the bottle). Given it's 6.9% ABV, i could probably have 3 or so, then the flavor would probably become a little intense. An excellent sipping beer ideal for warmer months."
"Pours a very bright golden color with a quarter inch white head with nice lacing. smells of very strong hops, lots of citrus, grapefruit , and pines aromas going on. Taste is very hoppy all the way through, taste really resembles smell on this brew. Lots of grapefruit and citrus notes, just the way i like it! Oh and there is definitely a lot of hops in this one, its great. This beer is great! easy to drink, great taste all the way through, i would recomend this to anyone, great brew!"
"Drinkabilty is very high for an IPA. I might think this was closer to an APA if it wasn't for the very end of the finish."
"The six packs in my area are a little pricey but it's worth the price. Get this one for a nice treat, you won't regret it."
"This is a very nice IPA. I just had the Ruination the other night, which may have ruined me for anything less luscious, as I prefer that to this. Can't go wrong here though."
"D - A little strong for a session brew, but a well balanced IPA without too much bitterness. Good stuff."
"D: This is a nice, bracing west coast IPA. NC has been waiting on Stone for more than 3 years and Stone does NOT dissapoint!"
"This is my first review in almost a month and my 150th. To mark the occasion I have chosen Stone IPA, a very popular and well reviewed beer. This is not my first Stone and most certainly not my last. Poured into pint glass with a purty lite amber color and fluffy, frothy off white head. Nice small bubbles throughout. Great hop aroma, with a touch of honey. Strong biting hop flavor, bitter. Great mouthfeel, chews on the tongue ever so slightly. The bitterness and hop harshness is maybe just a little too strong to make this a super drinkable beer. Great overall though."
"Not the hop bomb I expected; it does have less hops than alpha king, for the sake of comparison; but it is amazingly drinkable and pleasant."
"Appearance is copper with a thin white head. Smell is very strong of citrusy hops. The taste is incredibly abundant on the grapefruit hops there's also a slight yeast flavor. Very bitter, but not atypical of an IPA. Mouthfeel is crisp, very carbonated. This is a drinkable beer, but it is so bitter and carbonated, I recommend taking it easy with this one."
"What is up with the almost 7% ABV? Not sessionable at all and with the overwhelming bitterness I am not sure I would want to anyway. Good for a bitter fix then move on to more balanced brews."
"M/D - Unexpected light/ med body and medium carbonation. Very easy to put back. Even though it's over 6% ABV, I could easily drink many of these throughout a night."
"On Cask (hand-pump) @ Stone Brewing World Bistro & Gardens. Special release with Summit and Amarillo Hops. Pours light golden yellow, cloudy. Small clear white head. Sweet, orange aroma with a definite kick of hops. Starts off with sweet tangerine/lemon notes then becomes intensely hoppy with accompanying spice and Ting. Hops spread to the sides and back of the tongue. Cask gives the pallet a smooth rich texture with perfect carbonation. Lingers a long time on the back of the tongue. Great stuff!"
"pint at Taphouse on Queensway, Hampton, VA"
"D: Incredibly drinkable, I just might have another."
"Picked this one up at the Nova in Hudson Wisconsin, can't get it in Minnesota unfortunately. Pours a hazy straw color. Smell has a fresh quality to it, very brisk. Mild citrus notes are present. Taste is creamy and most pleasant. The hops are of course notable plus somewhat restrained, and not in a bad way. Strawberry perhaps? Some lemon zest for good measure and a touch of mint. The finish has a nuttiness to it. Mouthfeel is of a high quality. The medium and smooth creamlike body grips the palate with a kind of nonchalance. Smooth and easy drinking. All the factors come together beautifully yet it still seems short of magnificient. Lacking in the top-quality of the absolute best ipas (two-hearted, furious and masala mama notably). In the end though a really phenomenal ipa not far off the top."
"D= I loved this beer, but only someone who loves hops and off-the-charts bitterness would. A great year round session beer despite the abv (though I wouldn't plan on evaluating any other beers after this has fried your palate)."
"Overall, a very good IPA. I could see kicking back with a few of these any day of the week."
"D - A fantastic beer. My first Stone experiences were with their Arrogant Bastard and Double Bastard years ago. The alcohol was way too obvious in those beers and I didn't like them at all (that was then, I love them now). It's taken me a while to warm up to Stone but this IPA is about as good as it gets."
"One more review after more than 1300 prob won't make a difference, but this one is worth it. A prestigious brewery like Stone wouldn't let their signature IPA fall flat. Beautiful appearance, stong nose of hops, great hoppy taste followed by an exceptional hoppy kick. Not the absolute best IPA I've ever had(Flying Dog IPA, Smuttynose Big A are slightly superior), but this could be considered the IPA standard bearer."
"Fantastic beer! One of the best IPAs I've ever had - I think I only like the Stone Ruination more. Everything here is top-notch - smells great, tastes even better, and its never too strong or too hoppy. Stone may be my favorite brewer - I need to try their Imperial Stout to be sure. Like all Stone beers, this IPA is highly recommended!"
"Still a great IPA and solid all the way. I cant even imagine Stone making a bad beer."
"If you like IPAs, seek this brew out. It's a shame that I have to head downstate to find it."
"D. I love drinking this brew its one of my favorites and leaves me always wanting more. Check out the Ruinination IPA too it always gets me thinking about the worlds mysteries..."
"D- Very nice brew. Refreshing and thirst quenching on a hot summer day. I like the citrus characteristics of this brew a lot."
"Good drinkability, a great IPA here."
"Served in a Pint Glass at 48 degrees. Poured a nice golden hue with a tinge of orange in direct light. Head was thick and white and left pleasant lacing. Rough but pleasant hop notes dominate a very inviting aroma. Taste is the expected and potent smack of bitter hops with nice hint of smooth malt in the finish. This is a classic example of an American IPA."
"Poured into a pint glass. Ale was cloudy and gold with a little brown overtones. Head was about half inch thick, but had some real nice lacing. Left rings around the glass with every swallow. Every swallow left more bubbles around the edges. Smelled of floral hops, malt and citrus. Tasted a little dry, slightly bitter, and had that pine taste. It just tasted good. Felt good in the mouth. carbonation was good. I would drink these all the time and will buy again. I couldnt make this a session beer because of the higher alcohol content. It tastes so good you just want to gulp it down. But if you want to treat yourself, its worth it."
"I would purchase this again and would consider it as a 'staple' beer for everyday drinking."
"Golden amber with a pure white head that clings to the pint glass. The aroma brings the first notion that this ale is world-class. The hops jump out at you and pull you in for the taste, which is even better. The excessive dry-hopping produces a powerful IPA-worthy bitterness that somehow manages to be completely smoothed out by the mild malt character. Medium to light body with a serene crispness. This easily makes my top 3 IPA list. There should be a picture of this brew in the dictionary under India Pale Ale. Mission accomplished, Stone."
"D- A great beer. Recommended and easy to drink."
"This ber pours a semi cloudy amber with a 1.5 fingered white head. The smell is of citrus and malts with some fruity smells mixed in. The taste is very pleasant, a very well balanced IPA with beautiful hops flavors followed by a very smooth malt flavor. The flavor is very fruity for an ipa which is nice for a change. The mouthfeel is very nice and well carbonated. Borderline a 5 drinkabliltiy, just a wonderful brew and I will drink it more often on tap!"
"Aroma is very floral, citrusy and hoppy. Pours a darker golden color, or light orange with a moderate to small head but still some nice lacing. Crisp hoppy flavor with sweet citrus, moderate bitterness and dry. Very nice with amazing drinkability even if you are not a hop lover. One of the best IPAs around."
"D- Very nice to drink on many different situations."
"Nice flower blossoms in the nose with a tinge of orange and other fruitiness, and a fluffy white head that doesn't last long but sticks to the sides of the glass. A bit of malt up front offers some sweetness, then there's the giant bite as it goes down. Wonderful! Very dry, quite fizzy. Hugely bitter in the aftertaste with plenty of citrus rinds and pepper. Pretty in the glass, too. Highly recommended."
"D- Goes great with spicy food, I'm eating mine with jalepeno/onion/ground beef/green pepper pizza.mmm"
"Based on the nose the initial taste was not quite as ""juicy"" was i was expecting. I was anticipating hoppy for sure, and it's there, but it strikes a near perfect balance with the malt. Piney and nice a nice blend with the malt presence in the background behind the dominating hop bitterness. Grapefruit flavors emerge in the middle. Another solid offering from Stone."
"M,D: The active carbonation is great and the alcohol is hidden perfectly"
"If you are not into hoppy beers or have no idea what a hop head is then this beer is one that you should stay away from. The taste of the Stone IPA is rich with an impressive hop flavor that is beautifully crafted as being the right balance of spice and flavor. While there is some pine noted, other than the hop taste of the beer, there are also subtle citrus tastes that also work their way into the offering."
"Single purchased in Chippewa Falls ; )"
"Drinkability: A great beer that you can taste from the beginning of the glass/bottle to the end. Excellent flavor. A stupendous example of the west coast IPA."
"Body merdium, creamy and infinately drinkable. I could not recommend a finer accompanimant to O'Malley's incredibly good buffalo wing"
"Overall: Good to Great IPA"
"A good representative of a West Coast IPA. This was one of the first craft beers I started drinking when I lived in CA. Glad I could revisit it in the South and can't wait until they are distributed in GA."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden orange with a 2 cm iff white foamy head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma of hops: mostly sweet, a little piney and resins. Initial taste is citrusy sweet. Flavor balances out and becomes very dry on the aftertaste, which lasts for a long time. Light to moderate carbonation, hint of alcohol, light to medium body, and tons of lacing. Great beer, very drinkable."
"Had the beer a number of times now- bottle and draft. This review comes from a bottle to goblet. Beautiful orange body with a nice white head that leaves lots of lacing. wonerfyul puckery citrus aroma. Very pungent. Same as the taste. Amazing for a easily fopund IPA. Great treat=- tons of aroma and flavor. citrus galore. Could drink them all nite!"
"Drinkability: Pretty solid IPA. With all of the excitement of this beer coming to Milwaukee, I was expecting a little bit more, but I would definitely seek out again."
"Overall: quite possibly my favorite beer."
"I enjoyed this far more than the Ruination IPA. The appearance was a bit cloudy with a nice light orage/amber color. The aroma had lots of citrus hops with the initial palate being very full. I did not care for the texture being very creamy and oily but the flavor was moderate in all areas with the bitterness not being to overpowering. I also liked how the alcoholic taste did not linger as much as the Ruination."
"Had this one on tap for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and managed to find it again today. I remember the first time I bought a sixer of these (fairly close to when I first started drinking crafts) they totally knocked me on my ass. Now, the beer is great, although certainly not quite as stunning. It's got a solid look, just like an IPA should. Fairly weak lacing on a solid head. Flavor and nose are strong on piney hops, with caramel malt and some toffee and citrus in there too to round things out. This is a highly hoppy beer, no question, bitter and drying, but delicious. Doesn't quite reach the top echelon for me (Two Hearted, Hop Red Rye, etc.), but still a very drinkable and tasty brew."
"Cheers..."
"Drinkabilty is good. Nice west coast style IPA. Others I enjoy more. But I'd gladly buy & have this again."
"While this is a really good IPA, there's just something missing for me, or maybe the hype skewed my expectations. Regardless, I'm very happy that Stone made its way to Wisconsin."
"Got a 22 ounce bottle from my favorite store and let it chill for a week. Opened it and poured my first glass. Beautiful dark golden/light amber color with good carbonation and a very nice looking head. Took a big ol' wiff and HOPS!, HOPS!, HOPS!....the hop aromas were jumping out of the glass, so I took a taste and MORE HOPS. Good character for this beer, Stone has a knack of brewing their beers to the maximum potential of the relative styles they make and this IPA delivers. Fresh tasting ale with complex hop flavors that seem to kick you at first but soon come together into one damn good beer."
"note: Not the best american IPA that I have sampled, but a very good one."
"D- a great beer for hops lovers, a great beer for beer lovers, this one can be enjoyed by all."
"D- A nice consistent Ipa lacks somewhat in the malt category but doesnt hurt the experince all that much."
"D: If it wasn't for the 7% alchohol content i would be drinking these all night. Superb, really. I was impressed."
"A slightly creamy mouthfeel, a very bitter beer that is suprisingly refreshing and drinkable!"
"On tap at Stone Brewery in Escondido. Color is a medium yellow with a small amount of white foam. Smells of citrus. Tastes of citrus and heavy bitterness, but the taste just isn't all that intense. I've had the stuff on tap before, and it was much better in the past. This time, it didn't do all that much for me."
"Very drinkable. It's been a while since I had this. Good stuff, don't plan on waiting so long to have it again."
"D: I will pull for this one without reservation. Stone has changed my opinions on IPA's or at least the American style. While the hops were quite strong as advertised on the bottle, the remainder of the receipe was a perfect blend to ensure full enjoyment to the very last drop."
"My Benchmark Calli IPA...This was the beer that made me fall in love with hops...Thank you Stone...If I ever make it out to Calli, I will be there...The Crisp finish with the high dryness makes you remember how it tastes the next day...after the gig...."
"D: An excellent complex IPA. The hops are definitely there..I could smell the hops from my glass on the table. The high alcohol content (6.9%) keeps me from pounding a 6pk but it is really drinkable. Great example of the style..."
"One of my favorites. Enjoy!"
"Low bitterness so an easy drinker, again very refreshing, would take this over most summer styles, if I was on the west coast I could keep a six pack of this, but Bells and Goose have ones as good so no problem."
"Growler from Consumer Beverages. Bright orange color with a nice head. I like the color of this. Aroma is fruity and floral with some sweet malts. Starts out with lots of malt sweetness but gets more bitter and dry towards the finish. Not bad, but a pretty average IPA."
"Poured beer into glass. Definitely a little cloudy for an IPA (maybe a chill haze goin on?). Pours a yellowish or light copper. Not much of a head, but keep in mind I use glasses washed in the dishwasher with detergent. Amazing citrus smell. First sip catches you off guard as it is not what you would expect, but it is a great unique citrus flavor. The citrus (orange like flavor) is not over powering, but balanced very well with the rest of the beer. Great beer."
"Medium golden color with about a 1 finger head that left lacing to the bottem of the pint. Smells strongly of pine, citrus and alcohol. What got me about this was there was no depth to the flavor. It was a big hoppy start and then very little in between or in the end even. The overall flavor was decent--nice strong hop flavor, bitter orange peel. A very easy drinking IPA--would be easy to have 2 or 3 even. Nice carbonation, soft mouth feel and generally a clean finish. I guess I like my IPA's to leave a strong flavor on the back of my mouth and this doesn't. Overall its a good beer but not one I'd regularly reach for."
"This is a great IPA and I am only sorry that I cannot get this around my area. I am just now getting aclemated into the stronger and hoppier beers and I can see why this is a good representative of the genre. I truly hope that Stone comes to NC soon like the rumours that are going around are stating. Otherwise I am gonna have to keep trading to get my hands on this."
"The feel is kinda slick and moderate. For an IPA this is one of the the most balanced and drinkable ones ive had."
"As for drinkability, let's just say that I could drink this stuff all night. It's hoppy as hell, yet still seems to be balanced nicely. Definitely one of the better IPAs out there."
"D - At just under 7% a couple of these bad boys will do."
"Great brew, definatly recommend."
"D- A decent IPA, but there are better examples out there. It's very balanced, but I think that I would grow weary of it after two or three pints. Still though, it's a good beer and worth a go if you haven't had it before. Cheers!"
"D-Overall a good IPA, but there are a lot of good IPAs on the market. Nothing about this is bad, but it doesn't stand out more than the others. I am just a little torn about this one. The hype of this beer may have upped the bar a bit. Easy to drink and a pleasure for hop heads. Good, above average American IPA"
"A good refreshing American IPA. More bitter than most, but not in a bad way. Stone has another winner in this one."
"some malt sweetness in the finish. Carbonation is medium, but I find the mouthfeel to be medium-thin. Drinkability is very good-but this is not a session beer."
"D: Outstanding IPA. Could easily drink these all night long. I drove an hour to a liquor store in NY to get a six pack of this and it was well worth. Too bad we can't get this in CT."
"D- I don't consider IPA'S to be my session beer, but this one is very good."
"Drinkability - High. I've been wanting to try this beer for awhile based on the ratings here at BA and am glad I finally did. Great tasting and with no chemicals and preservatives I can say I'm drinking healthy!"
"An aggressive pour results in a nice white pillowy head of about an inch or so which sticks around for a few minutes. When I look through the glass I see a crystal clear straw-colored beer. Great hop character on this! Ohh yeah, this is something I can get behind! Flavor is big with plenty of grapefruit hops which provide for an excellent taste. Medium bodied with light carbonation helps this one become a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a great copper color with good head and nice lacing. It has a wonderful floral, hoppy scent that fills the air. It has a great taste, very light malty tones with a wonderful hoppy overtone, nearly too much, but it's great. It goes down very smooth. An absolutely wonderful IPA."
"D: Good."
"D- Don't kid yourself this is a big beer. With that being said it goes down easily. I don't see myself drinking this as a session brew but I love to mix in two or three if I am on a mission:)"
"I think Stone beer only just became available in Wisconsin, and I was really surprised to find it."
"Seriously This stuff is wicked good! The aroma alone is absolutely gorgeous. A wonderfully sweet fruity hoppiness, roasted nuts, and caramel is indescribable. Appearance is an orangish/ amber color with a small white head. Flavor is big on the hops, pine, and a subtle caramelized malt note. Palate is bitter/sweet and last quite a while. Overall, This is one damn good beer."
"Simply sublime!!!"
"Very good and even though the ABV is a 6.9% I would like to call it sessionable from the ease of drink. Real good IPA here."
"This is a great beer, just one more from Stone to look for!"
"Pours a very pale yellow. The color is a shade above Budweiser. ALOT of carbonation in this one. Poured down the side of the glass slowly, and this one still bubbled over. Smell was slightly underwhelming. Some citrus and hops, but it was relatively subdued. Taste was overly hoppy and was not as balanced as I was hoping for. Mouthfeel was too bubbly for an IPA. Overall, this is an average IPA at best, and definitely not one of Stone's best offerings."
"D: Highly drinkable for IPA, reasonably high alcohol content is completely non-apparent. I have yet to have a Stone beer that left me at all disappointed."
"The finish is solid as well, slightly dry with a strong bitter flavor. Every bit as good as the bottle, and a joy to be had every time."
"D: Stone IPA is a masterfully crafted beer. All facets of the experience are top-notch. The higher ABV limits drinkability a bit, but not much. I'd definitely try to session this one (don't know how much success I'd have, though!)."
"A fantastic example of an American IPA. Highly recommended."
"Pours a light gold in color with a nice frothy inch of head. Smell is crisp, piney and floral hops. Taste is clean, refreshing and more floral hops. Not over the top, but a nice easy drinking, solid IPA. This is an easy warm weather beer. This is too easy of a drinker. Very smooth and nice."
"Shaker glass. Pours golden with a thick frothy head. Aroma of sweet malts and hops. Big malt taste right up front, followed by a big bitter finish. IO was expecting to be blown away by the bitterness, but they only present strongly at the finish. One of the best IPA's I've had."
"taste buds. Cool bottle too."
"Stone, you haven't let me down yet."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low levels of alcohol and simple but pleasing flavors make for easy consumption. An enjoyable experience."
"D - This is one of the most flavorful IPAs that I've had I could drink this all night long definitely worth going out of your way to find"
"""oaked""ABA is my second favorite."
"D: The light and crisp mouthfeel on this one make it extremely drinkable and would be an ideal spring and summer IPA. I could see this being a staple in my fridge if I had access to it."
"What is there that can be said about this beer that probably hasn't been said already? This has to be the quintessential American IPA. Perfect taste and near perfect everywhere else. Stone never ceases to amaze me. This will become one of my go to beers. Absolutely awesome. Highest recommendation."
"D: Classic example. A good solid example and hard to go wrong here or find reason to fault. A worthy recommend and nice try."
"Medium bodied. Mild creaminess to the mouthfeel. Perfectly carbonated and VERY drinkable."
"O/ M - Great IPA! Velvety, creamy medium mouthfeel and body. Very smooth for IBU of 70+. One of my favorites!"
"d: I'll quote todd here, ""Simply put ... this is one insane IPA, and not for the weak palate. To compare it to other IPAs would be silly, however I think this sums it up ... Once Stone comes into a new market it's like a challenge to other brewers in the area: ""I know my big beers are bigger and better than yours, but let's see yours anyway. I promise not to laugh."" Oh ... and this is just their standard IPA doing the speaking."""
" This is a classic Left-coast IPA with very agreesive hops and plenty of tongue-numbing bitterness. A hop-heads dream I suppose."
"Hazy gold colored ale with an aroma of pine.Taste is pine and malt.This has an ""A' with over 1200 reviews???This is one of the 10 top worse tasting beers I've ever had.It reminds me of the Pine Sol my grandmom used to clean the house with.I don't get.Can you say overhyped??"
"A must have in your life."
"I poured from a bottle into a glass. I got a pretty good foam that quickly broke down, but did leave some great crystalline cobwebs on the glass. This IPA is light gold in color, almost a honey color. The smell was not very complex but was very hoppy. The beer had a mild malty taste up front that finished with a strong hoppiness. Very refreshing. The mouthfeel was surprisingly rich (almost creamy) for a light colored, hoppy ale. A very drinkable ale. I'm sure I'll drink it again and now I want to try Stone Ruination Ale."
"D: This was a great beer. I wouldn't drink more than a bomber in a sitting but I would keep a few bombers in the cellar. I am really looking forward to Ruination now."
"pours up a deep yellowed-orange color with a nice white head. great lacing. looks like panty hose. aroma is citrus hops and grapefruit. taste is great! citrus hops, mildly spicy hops, hints of lemon, nice medium bodied malt backbone. low to medium carbo. glad this one comes in a sixer but forget that. even though its cheaper to buy a sixer, im a bomber fanatic til the day i die!"
"Love the bottle... (my friend wouldn't let me keep the porter bottle we split :( ) This beer has Knox block color with a thick active white head. Smell is really tops as far as hops goes. This beer is heavy with hops but has a hint of sweetness in the finish, though nothing compared to dogfish head's 60 minute ipa sweetness wise, may also have a hint of sesame in the flavor. A rather heavy and slick feel to the tongue with lite feel of bubbles. This beer is pretty drinkable... too bad its so pricey. Yet again another enjoyable brew from Stone."
"Drinkability: Very. Excellent session beer - If you get the chance, try this. Superb example of an American IPA."
"Had on tap at Moan and Dove. The drink had a murky orange color with a quickly thinned head and lacing. There was a sharp citrus and floral aroma strongly emitting from the drink. Compared to the smell, the taste was a bit weaker with the citrus still apparent. Medium body in general, giving it a good carbonation but nothing more. Overall, strong aroma flavors while other dimensions are just above average."
"This is a solid IPA. Nothing overpowering and nothing complicated. This beer is a welcome companion on a long morning, afternoon, or night."
"Drinkability: Although this beer is delicious, I could not drink more than one at a time. I split a 22oz. bottle with 2 other friends and slowly sipped it and enjoyed all its complexities."
"good ipa. Smells like one as you open the bottle you are looking forward to a good beer. As you taste it the hops are right there on top and a decent follow through. However, there are just simply better IPA's our there including hop devil and dogfish that I have had. Certainly would buy it and you will not be disappointed, but you might do better."
"Overall: Possibly my favorite IPA, the hops are top notch yet not overpowering. A very tasty well balanced brew."
"Poured from a 22oz. bomber, into a pint glass. The beer pours a clear light gold, forming a thick creamy 1 inch off-white head, with light spots of lace along the glass. Heavy and rich hop aroma dominates the nose. Citrusy and slightly fruity. The taste doesnt dissapoint. Suprisingly smooth thick hop flavor up front, followed by a noticeable malt presence in the finish. Alot smoother mouthfeel and finish than expected. A highly drinkable IPA! Overall, this was much better than I expected. I assumed that this would shred my tastebuds with all the hops, but it turns out that this is a very well rounded beer. Not that I have anything against extremely hopped up beers, but there are times when highly hopped but smooth beer sounds good, and this is it."
"Bitterness is not to an extreme level, but it's up there. Not mild by any means, the bitter hop notes come out more in the aftertaste. There's some grapefruit/citrus rind, balanced by a tasty light maltiness. Very quenching and easy to drink, i've gone through two bombers this week, and Ruination is on deck after this one..."
"A classic IPA."
"D: A one!"
"Stone IPA pours a slightly cloudy orangey yellow with good white head. Nose is balls out citrus hops. Taste pretty much follows, super west coast grapefruit citrus hops with somewhat of a malt backbone, but the hops overpower them by far. The mouthfeel is good, drinkability is pretty good too. Overall this is a great session IPA, but it is quite unbalanced on the hop side of things. Personal preference would be for just a touch more maltiness in here, but overall it is a great IPA."
"It's hard to believe that this is an IPA; it is strong as hell, and it kicks the ass of almost all of the IPAs I have had before it. With it's alcohol content and drinkability, it is both a blessing and a curse to not have any more at the moment. I've had some mixed feelings about Stone's brews, but between this and Ruination I will gladly buy their beer for as long as I walk this earth."
"Poured from 11.5oz bottle into standard pint glass. Heavy handed pour yields 1 finger head, of nice white foam. Head diminishes somewhat quickly leaving moderate lacing . Beer itself is an orange amber, beautiful in color. Smell is all hops, piny resiny citrius hops. First sip perfectly echos the aroma . A very nice hop bite on the tongue, citrius and pine resin. Body is a bit thin afet the hop explosion. A very nice drinkable IPA."
"if you are an IPA fan. i highly recommend this beer. its the best IPA i've had. and most people agree that its one of the top 3 out there."
"All in all something I'm glad to have tried."
"D: Well what can I say, with almost 2000 reviews at this time, I'm just adding to the legend, throwing another log on the fire. So here we go.... Extremely drinkable, a classic depiction of the style, west coast all the way, top notch hop profile that grabs you by the face, but doesn't over power, showing its complex hop flavor but not lacking in bitterness or ABV and just enough malt to not be forgotten. A wonderful IPA, and a fine beer period, I can see why Stone gets may accolades, well done indeed!"
"This beer is a medium cloudy honey color in the glass, but without much of a head. It smells of citrus, alcohol, hops, and apricot. It's a pleasant, fresh smell. It tastes crisp and properly-balanced in terms of hops and fades to a sweet flavor alluding to the complex makeup. It's pretty dense in mouthfeel with good carbonation. This is a good beer, and nicely exemplifies this style."
"Drinkability: Nice beer. I would buy it again."
"Another great job by Stone, highly recommended... if you were trapped on a deserted island... and could only have one IPA... this might just be it."
"D - a highly drinkable, tasty, west coast ipa. i really liked this one."
"Pours a clear golden yellow with thin white head, ok retention and good lacing. Smells of grapefruit, pineapple, grass clippings, pine needles, and honey, lots of hop character in there. Taste is very hoppy, grapefruit, pine, grass, but is also well balanced with a honey sweetness. Medium in body with good carbonation, smooth with a nice crisp bitter finish. Lots of hoppy flavors, easy to drink, very sessionable, even if it is almost 7% ABV."
"Drinkability was decent. This isn't my go to style of beer which means that I wouldn't want more than one of them in a sitting. Despite that, this is a damn good IPA, possibly the best IPA I've had yet."
"Finally review # 200! This beer poured a golden, coppery straw color with a huge white rocky head. The smell was great! Nice typical hoppiness smells such as citrus nd pine. The taste was wonderful as well with a nice maltiness in the front followed by a proper bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel was thick. Nice heavy body with medium carbonation. Overall incredible. Stone Brewing is one of the best breweries out there. Enough said."
"Had on tap at Lucky Baldwin's Delirium Cafe. As common as this beer is in So. Cal I've only had it a couple times in the last 2 or 3 years since in my first couple experiences with it I just found it too ""grassy"" of an IPA. Well I don't know what has changed- my palate, or their recipe but this was a fantastic IPA. It had a bit of citrus in it which I never noticed before plus a load of pine. I will definitely be ordering this as one of my regular beers from now on."
"What a great example of a West Coast IPA."
"Very nice! I wish I could pick this up whenever I wanted. The hops smell and taste are just so pleasing, it keeps me coming back, rushing this first bottle quite a bit!"
"D- Excellent. ""More bottles!!"""
"An organish-tint that is somewhat seethru and carbonates greatly. Received a rocky, two-finger head that dies quickly but leaves sticky lace patches. An unbelievable floral and earthy hop smell complete with fruits and spices mixed in. One of the few beers to actually make me turn away to catch my breath (it was like I had put my nose in a peanut butter jar; my breath was literally taken away). The hops dominate the tastebuds while only being slightly spicy and mildly bready, and this beer actually has a smooth finish. Don't know why exactly, thought I tasted caramel and/or butterscotch and the hops gave off some fruitiness (like apples), but a great finish to a great beer. Considering I can get this on the cheap at my local grocery store, this is a must redrink and I recommend it to any IPA drinker."
"d - wow. incredibly easy drinking ipa from stone."
"Mouthfeel was good as well."
"But the taste is much different. I realize now that the Ruination was an imperial Ipa, i didnt realize that until i read the reviews after my review of it. I am a much bigger fan of this regular Ipa. Not so much hops and none of the bitterness. Nice smooth going down and very drinkable. Bit of a bite at the back of the throat after swallowing, but not in a bad way. Definetly more of a beer for me."
"MF&D - Thin to medium bodied IPA. Spicy and flavorful finish. Highly recommended. Paired extremely well with a spicy bowl of turkey chili."
"Drinkability- A hugely drinkablle beer, i will definately buy this beer again."
"This poured a hazy honey gold with nice off-white head. It smelled like sweet pine and some roasted yeast. It tasted very sugary with some hops bitterness and mild yeast for balance. It was fairly watery with no carbonation and a gentle sweet aftertaste. Overall this was much more sweet than bitter for an IPA, but it was tasty."
"D - A potent IPA... Definitely one to be savored and not rushed... Finely crafted and a joy to drink..."
"D: Very nice IPA but not a beer I could drink all night."
"D: This is a masterful IPA...well balanced and smooth. It is a wonderful session brew."
"Thanks to Beertracker for the opportunity. Pours a light straw color with decent clarity and a good 1/4 inch head that settles to a fine ring that leaves little lacing down the glass. Smells of big time grapefruit with a touch of floral hops. The nose becomes maltier as it warms up. Tingles the tongue with those grapefruits right away. Some lemon and grassy notes also discernable. A pleasant dose of sweet malts all around. Well structured. Smooth oily mouthfeel. The maltiness also becomes more noticable as it warms. A great IPA that is layered nicely."
"I had this at Wild Bills Casino in Lake Tahoe. I found this IPA to be very well rounded with a malty slide. There wasn't much head from the bartender's pour but the color was medium amber and a spicy hop aroma. Taste was very balanced with a medium mouthfeel medium. Great finish!"
"The color is light orange. This IPA is a winner, it's bitter but the malt comes through oh so nicely. Some nice citrus flavors come through with the hops. The balance is amazing, I freaking love this beer. The only problem is it's a little pricey on the east coast. Check out the Arrogant Bastard Strong Ale as well. This is a close 2nd in my favorite IPA (first is smuttynose). SO freaking drinkable, I could drink this all night, which might be a little dangerous."
"A very strong IPA and an excellent intro into the Stone lineup. My favorite from them is still the Ruination, but this is a darn tasty beer."
"D - Very enjoyable, looking forward to next round."
"It was a very drinkable and great tasting beer."
"Hop flavor is wet and spicy, as well as Earthy and piney. Freshly cut wood is prominent. Strong bitter oils on the back of the tongue."
"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with a nice sticky white head. The aroma is oily fresh citrusy hops with some malt. The taste is dominated by the bitter citrusy hops that are quite puckering and last well into the finish. There is a mild malt presence in the background, but it is hard to even the slightest attention to the malt before the hops demand your full attention. Overall, this is a fabulous West Coast IPA that I would highly recommend. If this was available here in FL, it would be a staple in my fridge."
"D: Pretty solid all around.. Won't be my first choice when I want an arromatic IPA."
"Also the price is right, and ya gotta love that."
"This beer pours a golden amber color with a medium sized but thick tan colored head that laces the glass all the way down. The aroma is of very nice citrisy and piney hops. The taste is great! Very nice roasted malt backbone underneath a bold citrisy and piney hop flavor. The mouthfeel is nice - very crisp and dry finish. The drinkability is very good as well. I would definately have a few of these if I could. Well worth a try, excellent IPA."
"Appearance was good.. rich, golden color, with a nice 1"" head. The smell was nice, fresh.. of fruit, straw, and hops. The taste was excellent.. lots of hop flavor along with apples and pears and straw. Very fresh. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"Taste is very hoppy. Grapefruit peel is very strong here. Its not pure hops though as some bready malt along with a touch of caramel help balance things out. Lingering bitterness on the palate. Mouthfeel is nice, smooth, pleasant carbonation level. Well worth seeking out while I was in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. Unfortunately its not available in MO, maybe sometime soon it will be. Great beer."
"I do believe we have a winner. My new favorite IPA, I didn't believe it possible to pack this many distinct hop notes into one beer. Excellent dry-hopping - a very assertive, very fruity, very pleasant surprise. Cheers!"
"Stone has certainly set a high standard for IPAs everywhere. This will probably turn anybody into a hop-head."
"Hope this review helps."
"Overall i nice beer I recommend."
"No mistaking the big hop additions in the flavors; lots of citrus and pine in tune with the delicious aromas. A touch of sweetness from the caramel malts are noted mid-palate, but the finish is a crisp and bitter hop contribution; nice and long. These guys are good!"
"MF/D- not to bitter, and flavor stuck around for a bit on the tongue. The Hops were pretty crisp, and the malt was subtle, making it a very enjoyable beer."
"A nice example of a tastefully heavy-handed IPA."
"A very nice light amber color when it hit the glass. Had a decent white head that stuck around for a little bit. Fruity hoppiness in the nose. A solid malt backbone to support the hoppiness of the beer. Perfectly carbonated with a medium body and a clean finish. A very smooth brew. If I wasn't so broke, I'd buy a case right now."
"A real hop-head, West Coast IPA."
"The only criticism I'd have is that it could use a little more malt to offer a more complex after taste once the hop flavour disapates."
"A great IPA."
"Alright ill get straight to the point. I love this beer! Im already a fan of hoppy ales/lagers especially IPAs and this is by far one of the best out there in my opinion. Pours that classis IPA orange color. Smells of wonderful hops. The taste is great you have the classic crisp hoppy flavor and its not overwhelmed by the alcohol. I could enjoy this one year round for sure. When i compare it to the ruination IPA from stone i like this one better suprisingly because of the lower alcohol that doesnt take away taste from all the hops. But if your looking for a little extra buzz go with the Ruination. You wont go wrong either way trust me. Oh and this ones a little bit cheaper as far as i know. Once again props to stone. without them and other micro's we would be stuck in piss water hell with bud,coors, and miller"
"Pours a crystal clear golden orange, with a pure white, rocky head. Smells citrusy and piney. Taste is quite dry, with an herbal and citrus hop flavor, as well as a tiny bit of malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is great, carbonation levels are low. I could drink several of these, they taste wonderful, one of the best American IPA's I have ever had."
"In all I think this one is pretty good, but I wish the bottle was not oxidized."
"This is one of the best IPA's I have had in a long time and I look forward to sampling their other varieties of IPA. I highly reccomend this to any hopped beer lover and I know I will be consuming several in the near future."
"A very tasty IPA that I could definitely have several of if the occaision allowed it. Needing to shove off for work soon precludes that, sadly. I definitely will drink this again, however."
"Drinkability: Pretty good drinkability. Very clean and crisp and quite refreshing."
"Excellent beer that I really wish we had here in Georgia."
"I hope they brew this in heaven."
"Initial strong aroma of hops that settled down to a more subtle hop aroma after a minute. Poured with a golden color, and a frothy head that was still a half inch thick a few minutes after pouring. Very well-balanced flavor with a mellow hop bitterness and a good amount of hop flavor that melded very well with the malt backbone. Rich mouthfeel that felt almost creamy from the fine carbonation. The beer coated the mouth for several seconds after each sip. This evolved into a pleasantly ligering aftertaste that was a good mix of bitterness and hop flavor. This is an excellent, well-crafted beer."
"D - Pretty good. Easy to drink and pleasant. I'll have again, likely. Stone is really up and down for me - but this one actually struck toward the middle."
"This is a very solid IPA. You can tell this beer is made of high quality ingredients. I will look for more from Stone brewery."
"A great IPA...I'll have to sample other brews from STONE"
"just wish there was a little more fruitiness and a little more malt. otherwise a bold american ipa"
"Notes: Probably the best example of an IPA I've ever tasted. I've had double IPAs before which lean towards the extreme side, but if you're not looking for extreme amount of hops, but still want a good fix, this is your brew."
"Rich honey to amber colored pour with relatively short lived head. Smell at first is big bold fresh hops, but in a matter of a couple minutes, the hops dissipated dramatically, and turned into a lightly aromatic honey and caramel with the faintest hint of alcohol. I've never noticed the hops aroma fading, or especially that quickly. Taste was actually rather smooth, sweet, and very mildly bittered and flavored from the hops. My girlfriend who can't normally drink IPA's from the bitterness actually liked this one. I was expecting a huge wack in the mouth from hops in this one after reading the bottle's description but it just didn't happen. I happen to like the milder side of IPAs rather than overly extreme, so it was nice, but I'd think some might be dissapointed. For 70 IBUs it was a cinch to drink, very enjoyable and worth getting again"
"D: i would love to have a six of this after working outside, great crisp/refresing IPA"
"D- It would be very easy to drink and enjoy several of these, as the abundant hop flavor never gets tiring and leaves the mouth wanting for more once the first brew is finished."
"Beautiful beer, a hefty golden color. Just barely cloudy. Pours with a small rocky white head that goes completely away. Good lacing. Smell is heavy if not harshly hoppy with pine and grapefruit. Also a myriad of other smells, rasin, raspberry or cassis, apple, a little oak and some honey. extremely refreshing taste. Starts bitter and ends with a sweetish note (for an IPA). Average duration. Palate was light, dry, and a bit metallicy, but only enough to stimulate the senses, still a joy to take down. Soft carbonation, very enjoyable brew."
"d: I'll stick to locals to ensure freshness, but this is a very good IPA."
"D- This is dangerously drinkable. It's not that the alcohol is particularly high but I think the dangerous part about it is it is so tasty and easily sessionable. I could go through a few of these without even blinking an eye."
"The funny thing is this IPA is just there entry level beer available in 6 pks.Can't wait to try there anniversary ales!!"
"Seriously, even Stone's standard fare is amazing. One of the best IPAs I've had."
"Pours light amber in color clear with no haze. Smell pinny zesty and a bit of a floral hop aroma. Taste is exceptional a touch of sweetness with a nice grapfruit, pinny, bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel medium in body carbonation was modarate. Drinkability I could have more than one this could be a new favorite IPA."
"This is a delight to drink. Of course I am a lover of IPAs, but this is probably subtle enough for the casual IPA drinker as well."
"An excellent ale through and through. Also, every bottle is fairly consistent. Lacing is present all the way down the glass, but the only knock I would give is that the head is a little soapy and didn't have that great retention. Other than that, a solid ale from a solid San Diego brewery."
"D: A great IPA and standby on tap. Very strong hop flavor but very easy drinking. Alcohol isn't really detectable in taste but has pleasant warming effect. Personally, I prefer Two-Hearted over this."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability - Drinkabilty is almost where i think it could be better, and by better I mean I just wish I could drink more of it. It is so good but the strength of its taste and alcohol content keep me from being able to drink it all day long like I wish I could"
"Notes - It's been over a year since I last had this beer, and I had almost forgotten how great it is. I think it took drinking a number of average-to-mediocre IPAs for me to realize how incredibly well-crafted this one is. Simply a classic of the style."
"This is one of my current favorites. Stone IPA pours a golden color with a moderate white head about 3/4 inch thickness. A slightly hazy beer that leaves a consistent lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell punches your nose with nice, hoppy notes of pine and citrus. There is also a slight alcohol presence noticeable in the aroma. A sweet malt smell lingers at the beginning of the sniff followed by a lovely fresh hop aroma. The taste has a bite to it from the combo of hops and alcohol. It has a nice sweet, malty taste and a great bitterness on the back of the tongue. The hops are aggressive and the bitterness level is perfect. This medium bodied IPA has carbonation that sits on the tongue momentarily before dissipating. This, combined with the alcohol, creates a spiciness that leave the mouth tingling for several minutes. The drinkability is very high and leaves you wanting more. I, myself, could drink a million."
"A very good IPA. Stong hops prescence with not a lot of sweetness and a crisp, clean, dry aftertaste make this a very sessionable beer."
"D- Overall this is a delicious beer that certainly displays the hops, but in a balanced atmosphere that I truly appreciate."
"Drinkability: The hops assault your taste buds such that 2 is the limit to truly appreciate the flavors in this beer. After that, give yourself a rest and wait until your tongue comes out of its coma. Also, the alcohol(6.9%) can get you if you aren't careful."
"Prosit MK"
"TTried this one a millon times. Used to work at the brewery and dont know how many growlers, kegs, and bottles I have of this stuff. This time off tap into a pint glass. Poured a golden orange color with a thick white head. Smell is of citrus hops and pine mixed with yeasty malt. Taste is well balanced hop bitterness profile with a little grapefruit and pine again. Mouthfeel is medium body with great carbonation. I can drink this beer forever, but the next day sometimes it feels like my intestine is going to explode after a binger of this IPA."
"poured from a 12 oz. chilled bottle in a pint glass.as an american and india pale ale fan..this rates amongst the best i've ever tasted in the pale ale category. i would love to try on draft.i tell ya,cali. makes some good pale ales!(stone and sierra nevada). drink carefully, they do creep up on you!"
"Starts out with a nice amber color with a STRONG smell of hops, but not overpowering. Head sustains for a bit, a nice thick white head. The taste as ALL stone brews do knocks you off your feet. Others say there is good balance, I would not say GOOD, but decent. Hops is insane through from the time it touches your mouth until the finish. A strong brew thats turns out to be a great IPA. I'll drink one to it!"
"D: Very high, overall. I could see the hops becoming a little much, personally, but otherwise it's a very smooth and friendly drink. Definitely something I will be getting again."
"Enjoy WJVII."
"Yeah, I'd do this one again!"
"D: Very drinkable. IN fact for an good IPA this is about as drinkable as you can get. At almost 7% you would have no idea. Another great Stone beer."
"Medium body and carbonation, dry bitter finish. Pretty definitive west coast IPA."
"I can't get this in NC but my in-laws live in TX, so I buy this every time I'm there. Great stuff."
"D: Very good example of the style"
"Kudos to Stone for creating such a fine tasting IPA. The beer looks and smells great, but the taste was the memorable and unique aspect of the beer. Well balanced and the hop flavors were both subtle and substantial, if that makes sense. You can definitely taste the hops, but not in an overwhelming manner. Definitely recommended drinking and not only to IPA fans."
"Appearance was deep, slightly cloudy orange. Nice head that lingers on the glass. Smell was fresh hoppy and bright. Taste was fresh popping citrus and hops, very balanced bitterness. Some malty, toasty flavors in the background. Hops settle down for a clean aftertaste. Nice creamy mouthfeel, the beer rolls around and feels smooth. Overall a very drinkable, distinct IPA on par with the best I have ever had. I would definately recommend this beer to others, even those who are not huge hops fans."
"pours a honey golden color with a large white head and lots of sticky lace nice aromas of piney hops and fruit and spices. taste is fruity and sweet with hops from begining to finish. medium body good carbonation smooth and well balanced. great tasting beer will be looking for more."
"D - A solid every day IPA - big, hoppy, flavourful, but maybe a little one dimensional."
"Well done Stone, and I award you with always having a sixer in my fridge of this tasty brew."
"Little aftertaste, pretty pleasant brew. After consuming most of the beer, I noticed that it was stamped ""enjoy by 12/11/07"" but I've had this brew before and didn't notice any major change. Generally, IPA's are made to last for longer periods of time. I feel comfortable saying that this brew would probably still taste good a month from now."
"Pours a cloudy gold with a one finger head. Smell is highly sweet with a touch of lemon. Flavor seems somewhat light but thick with personality at the same time. Starts off slightly in citrus and delivers a high level of bitter into your mouth. Gets smoother as time goes on. Smooth, but a bit strong on the mouthfeel. Highly drinkable."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable. You will have to watch out with this one as the alcohol taste is not noticeable and you can slug a few of these back before it catches up to you."
"there is a slight malty after taste that dissipates after several drinks, this beer also lingers in the mouth reminding the brain of how awesome this beer taste and forcing the drinker to take another drink and then causing sadness when this beer is all gone."
"I love this Stone. I love all Stone brews. Great brewery."
"My first Stone Brew!! Im so excited. pours out to a golden straw color. Big fluffy head, long retention. The first thing I noticed was the piney hop scents that filled the room. Deep citrusy scents, pine, hops,hops. Flavor is very reminescent of the smell. Ver hoppy,yeasts citrus. overwhelming onthe palate basically. overpowering mouthfeel,kicks you around, I love it. Makes this one definatley a sipper."
"D - off the charts! What an IPA! Stone isn't available in GA, so whenever I visit home for the holidays I pick up some right away. I could drink this all night. If you haven't had this get it ASAP. Definitely worth trading for as well if you're into that sort of thing."
"Pours a pure, light gold with good effervesence and a sizable, diligent head. Light hitting the glass shines in many directions. Ahh, the smell of hops invades the nose with a bittersweet complexity that makes the mouth water. The smell fades to a honey-like scent after a few sips. The taste is no secret, a bombartment of hops that come at you from all directions, but pleasantly. Strongly bitter finish and aftertaste. Biting in the mouth so you remember it sip after wonderful sip."
"My first-ever brew from the famous Stone company... their big, bold, aggressive marketing style works really well, and after sampling their IPA, I must say it is full of flavor and strong character that really shows... Appearance was a nice bronze color with light carbonation visible... aroma was hoppy, tinged by a faint smell of caramel and vanilla... taste strongly complements the aroma, being a solid brew with a strong hop character... slightly bitter finish but definitely full of flavor and really robust... I am eager to try more brews from this company, as I was really impressed with their rendition of an IPA... a good, solid brew... Recommended..."
"D - Pretty easy drinking. This would be a good session IPA"
"Have enjoyed this in bottle (live on East Coast) and on tap in San Diego. Excellent IPA with good balance and hop bite. Head disappears quickly and a good session beer for the experienced. A few in my party in San Diego had to stop at one and return to their yellow fizzy beers. Always a good pick on tap or bottle."
"Pours a golden color with a rocky 2 inch tall white head. After a few moments this head dies down and leaves a great deal of sticky icky clinging to the sides of the glass. Smell is of hops, and hops! Plenty of citrus aroma making me want to dive right in. Taste does not disappoint with some pine and grapefruit flavors. Mouthfeeling is just carbonated enough to make this one bitter, yet crisp and refreshing."
"Is this the best IPA I've ever had? Hard to say. I tried the Rocky Mountain IPA the other day and it absolutely blew me away with a hoppy kick in the teeth that induced me to buy two sixers of it but this is still a good IPA that I will be revisiting."
"I'm a big IPA fan - and while I think this is excellent, it isn't as great as anticipated, although it's very refreshing."
"M/D: Light to medium body that is slightly watery. Carbonation is pretty high as well. Smooth and easy drinking."
"A bombardment of hops, sweetness and malt. What a beer!! The best IPA I have ever had and I have had over 100 easily.The only thing that touches this is Harmon IPA Tacoma. It literally was the best of the best. Poured golden, yellow a thin head, excellent stuff!!!I had this bottle and I can only imagine how it tasted on tap."
"Medium bodied but super crisp and refreshing. This beer delivers the best of both worlds as far as an IPA is concerned. Bready malt with piny hops. Almost sticky sweet/bitter with crisp refreshment. So well put together. One of the best representations of the style there is."
"I really enjoyed this beer. IPA's are not my favorite. I prefer lots of malt in my beer, but this was really exceptional. Great balance, and very flavorful."
"D - Good. This is a pretty nice IPA, but I don't think that I like it as much as some other reviewers."
"This is the quintessential West Coast IPA. A brilliant brew. This is an example of why Stone is one of the utmost brewers in the nation. Great brew and highly recommended."
"Pours a bright golden color, pretty clear. Decent head leaves some lacing on glass. Smells very piney, some grapefruit, very floral and sweet smelling. Taste is extremely balanced. Piney, grapefruit notes, very hoppy balanced out by lightly sweet malts, citrusy....terrific. Great mouthfeel. Ridiculously drinkable. Immensely!"
"D = A very good choice for an IPA."
" I would recommend this beer to anyone that is able to take on a strong hoppy brew."
"It is somewhat difficult to believe this ipa is 6.9% ABV; it is extremely drinkable. If not for the high ABV, this would be the ultimate session ale."
"I've had this brew dozens of times ... but never really thought to stop and savor... this is what people are talking about when they say West Coast IPA. Fantastic and remarkably drinkable... I really like bitter beers for the most part, but for some reason, my purchases tend to linger in the bigger body/maltiness range.... but Stone has this one perfected."
"A light golden brown brew with a thick white head and substantial lacing. An aroma of caramel and sweet pine hops, very appetizing. This is tastey stuff with a bitter hops base that is streaked with candied malt. It has a fine carbonation and a nice full bodied feel.. It's easy drinking but fairly heavily hopped with pine and there is a notable alcohol, but I find it to be a great blend. Another top notch effort from Stone!! IPA lovers definitely will need to try this one and should be pleased."
"This is a beautifully done IPA. If I had to pick one beer as an example of a west coast IPA, this is the one I'd choose."
"Drinkability: Excellent IPA. Bold and hoppy, but maintains accessibility and drinkability."
"Overall, this is an excellent IPA and one that I would definitely drink a lot of if I could acquire a stash of it."
"I could definatly drink one of these every so often, just not my favorite as the style goes."
"D: I'm still more partial to their Tuination IPA, but this is clearly an IPA for hopheads. The hops aren't overpowering, though, so this can be enjoyed by all. This beer is better in the summer as it's quite refreshing, but with it being as cold as it is, maybe time to put it away for the winter..."
"I have had this beer a ton but never reviewed it. This past weekend I went to King's Fish House at the Tempe Marketplace and was pleasantly surprised to find this on tap. Came in a shaker pint that had not been frozen before filling. The color is a light amber, not as rich as say a DIPA but nor should it. The aroma is hoppy, flowery and slightly herbal. The flavor is somewhat sweet along with citrus and hops. The drinkability is wonderful for an IPA."
"The body is a very amber, almost orange color. It was topped with a white head that fell quickly. The body isn't perfectly clear but is extremely bright. The aroma is filled with pine, citrus, and malt, exactly like a west coast IPA should be. The flavor is pretty heavy with pine and backed up with citrus. I personally prefer the citrus to dominate the pine but this is good. The balance in this beer is perfect. This is a classic west coast IPA everything is great."
"Taste: Bitter hops and citrus/pine flavor (mixed with nose?). Medium bodied. Long and excellent aftertaste"
"D - A very well made beer that could blow out your palate after three or so. But a 22 oz bottle is a perfect serving."
"Drinkability: Drinkable and not overbearing. This is probably the standard for an American IPA"
"Not a bad ipa but also not an amazing one. Everything is here but its not knock your socks off good. The color is warm golden tint with a nice thick head. The smell is citrusy and a little hoppy but not very heavy or offensive. The taste is layered, starting with mild citrus and ending with that typical IPA hops and bitterness. A good combination but nothing fantastic. Better then most IPA's but not the best."
"Drinkability - If it weren't for the strong hop flavor, I would swear this is a ""session"" beer. Very easy to drink. Dangerously easy to drink."
"Delicious, always refreshing."
"Grabbed this bottle from Community Beverage in Queens. They don't have too many Stone's, so I grabbed whatever I could. This brew poured into a pint glass a very murky copper gold, with a nice one and a half inch thick head. The head was very foamy and creamy, not just bubbly air. The brew itself does not look too appetizing, however, it smells wonderful. Smells of delicious hops, malts, and maybe fruits. The taste is heavenly. Not nearly as bitter and unbearable as other ""strong IPAs."" Great balance of hops and malts, and fruit notes. And the feel, it is wonderfully velvety smooth. Overall, if this were more readily available, I'd be on it all day. Easily one of the best brews I've ever tasted."
"This beer is a medium cloudy honey color in the glass, but without much of a head. It smells of citrus, alcohol, hops, and apricot. It's a pleasant, fresh smell. It tastes crisp and properly-balanced in terms of hops and fades to a sweet flavor alluding to the complex makeup. It's pretty dense in mouthfeel with good carbonation. This is a good beer, and nicely exemplifies this style."
"Had what i think was an older bottle, enjoy by date was barely readable, i think it said 7/02/07. Color was a beautifully clear amber gold with thick creamy white head that laced the glass very well. Not really much smell as the hops have diminished over time. Taste was good and hoppy, grassy and piney but balanced by the sweetness of the malt. As badass as Stone tries to be, this beer is obviously well crafted and beautifully balanced. Body was medium and carbonation was just right, slid right down the throat. Could drink a couple of these, will definately re-review again with a fresher bottle to really experience the hop-punch-in-the-face smell."
"This beer is not for a beginner. If you do not like hops, or even like beers with medium hop character then stay away. This is only for the people with the craving for a well hopped beverage, which includes me."
"They go down easy for an IPA (like I said, lately they bite too much). The creaminess of the bottle was better balanced on the tap version. Very nice."
"Drinkability- this beer is dangerously quaffable. Too high of an abv to be a session beer, but surely drinks like a session beer. I'd love to keep a stash of this in the fridge."
"Pours clear golden with a big soapy white head that laces as it dies. Big pine, grapefruit, citrus rindy hops in the nose. Tastes as the smell promises, big huge hops with a nice bitter finish. Crisp, clean and light in the mouth with a tickle of carbonation. Rediculously drinkable and THE prototype for a delicious IPA."
"Overall, this is a tasty, very good example of an American IPA. Some say that American brewers take classic styles an push them too far. I like the fact that Stone specifically set out to make an over the top, not very well balanced, beer with no apologies. Hopheads, this is a brew for you, and I would gladly have many more."
"Wow. There are very few (ok, no, really) similar offerings to compare this to in my neck of the woods, so I feel like I've been enlightened, or something. The biggest thing I take away from this experience, however, is that I bought this at a Yoke's in Kennewick, Washington, during a recent wine country tour, and they even sell this stuff in gas stations south of the 49th - lucky freaking Yanks."
"If you drink this often or exclusively, be prepared to be disappointed by the so-called ""standard"" beers! ;-)"
"Great IPA.It was a suggestion from a bartender at a great place in Boyertown Pa. called union jack's.It's down a dirt road and you would never expect it to be there.They have over 250 bottled beers and 25 or so on tap.I have had alot of great IPA's at this place ,but stone is my favorite."
"This IPA has a very floral scent that is quite pleasent. At first drink this beer seems a little more carbonated than most IPAs I have had. Not lacking any taste, but certainly not too overpowering, it is very refreshing and is extremely drinkable. I definately recommened this as an everyday IPA."
"Poured from bomber into pint glass. First thing I notice is the color, a crystal-clear golden orange. Excellent thick head with great retention, leaves behind tons of lace. Almost ""ring like"" as each sip it takes there is a ring left to mark the previous level. Smell is of piney hops (cant distinguish much more with a slight sinus issue). Taste is terriffic. One of the best IPA's I've had. Hard hitting hops, piney and crisp. Smooth going down and leaves a bitter and dry aftertaste. Also something I really havent noticed in some other IPA's which I guess must be the hop oil. A somewhat ""slick"" feeling present as well. Good carbonation leads to a light mouthfeel making this an easy drinker. Overall a great beer!"
"Pours a surprisingly clear amber/orange color, with a nice thick head that settles rather slowly to leave behind a well defined lace on the glass. Smell is very hoppy, with equal parts citrus and pine. Most balanced aroma i can recall. Taste is faint citrusy hops, along with a sweet finish, pineapple perhaps? Hmm.... Mouthfeel is likewise excellent, very smooth, slightly sticky finish, not an obscene amount of aftertaste. Goes down way too easy. Before i knew it it was gone. Wow! Well done Stone."
"Mouthfeel is medium to thin and the carbonation serves the hop oils nicely. Drinkability is great even if the abv is on the higher end for single IPAs. Enjoyable, but look for this on tap where I feel it would be better."
"an elite IPA."
"EDIT: i dug another one out of my secret stash, this one has the date 21.1.05 debossed into the bottle so that makes it 3 years old! math! head was less vigorous, made about 1/2in settles fast but left alot of lace. where's it come from? same marshmallow milky toffee fruity hop aroma, but in the taste hops are more subdued, but much more developed and complex. as are the malts but the hops are the star from start to the long dry finish. cocoa butter sandalwood tropical fruit and alcohol! i really hop i can find some more of this shit."
"D- A fresh, hoppy beer, that is a welcome flavor. The alcohol and flavor aren't so strong as to prevent enjoying this beer all evening."
"Drinkability: Well, I was left wanting more.... I only bought a single 12oz. just to try it.... But this would be good all day long. I do prefer the DOUBLE IPA of Ruination though..."
"Edit: From a bottle the promise is upheld. Notes I didn't mention: the fruit is definitely pineapple and grapefruit. Fantastic beer!"
"Pours a bright transparent copper color, with a fluffy off-white head that leaves a generous lace behind all the way to the bottom. Big floral hop aroma pretty much tells the story here....yep, it's an IPA. Taste begins with a subtle buttery malt flavor, followed by a serious rush of evergreen and floral hop flavors. Very crisp and to-the-point....no dickin' around here. As another BA noted before, the hop bitterness is very prominent at first, but fades quickly as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is a little sticky, with a hop aftertaste that lingers for quite a while...just keeps you sippin' away. I could drink this all damn night! Great IPA!"
"D - Quite well I'd say, I could definitely use another. I will revisit this one rather soon I can tell, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good IPA."
"I could see this beer being a session IPA. It is not overly hoppy and the alcohol is subdued. This is my favorite example of an IPA."
"I poured this from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass and had a golden hue - a bit lighter in color than I had expected. The head was about one finger thick and remained intact for some time. It smelled great, like citrus, and the hoppy aroma imparted a fresh, spring like quality. The taste is truly exceptional. A perfect balance of bittering hops and flavoring hops make this one of the best examples of an American IPA. Hoppy! The drinkability is great and could easily be a quenching session beer."
"Pours a medium golden color with a small head and some lacing. Aroma is nice and strong with hints of grapefruit and floral notes. Taste is nice and hoppy upfront with the aftertaste being one of grapefruit. Really nice aftertaste that is not too dry or bitter. Malty too as well. Very smooth and well-balanced. Goes well with the pizza I'm eating. Definitely one of the better IPAs I've had."
"D - This beer is incredibly drinkable. I, for one, am very happy that Stone decided to sell these in sixers. One of Stone's finest brews."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, and will get more on my next trip south."
"Edit from 12/12. Tasted again recently at Piper's pub and Smokin Joe's in Pittsburgh, and as it has been over 5 years since I reviewed this beer, I figured an update was in order. What amazes me about this beer, is how consistently good it is. Even 2000 miles from where it was made, this beer was light, crisp, slightly tropical, yet refreshingly dry and bitter. This is a beer that is easy to take for granted (especially given all the other great beers Stone makes), but it's really something pretty special. Just an altogether excellent, well made IPA."
"A very nice IPA overall, and another winner from Stone. Completely sessionable, this beer really showcases a bold use of flavoring hops while maintaining balance in bitterness."
"D: If I hadn't had a big lunch, I would probably have to stop after 2 or so, but I could really drink this for quite awhile before experiencing palate fatigue. Extremely tasty and easy to drink. Without a doubt one of my favor brews."
"Great golden color-somewhat on the darker side of gold. Nice white head on top with some great lacing on down the glass. Big aroma of fresh cut grass and grapefruit. Huge hop blast of flavor. Definate tongue stripping sensation here. Just a touch of sweetness to balance the hops. Great mouthfeel. Terriffic beer overall. I think this might shape up better then the Ruination for overall drinkability. Great beer-well balanced."
"I've longed for Stone for some time. An unexpected business trip to San Francisco gave me the opportunity to pick up the IPA and a couple of other Stone brews from BevMo to bring back to Georgia and enjoy. Enjoy I am! Poured from a 22 oz brown bottle, with the cool Gargoyle that ""wards off modern day evil spirits"" painted on bottle, into my new Sam Adams glass. This IPA is one outstanding brew for my taste. The hops are there but do not over-power my palate. The brew has the expected floral, grapefruit impact one would expect from an IPA. Do not have the lingering bitter taste and oily mouth-feel that I sometimes experience with other beers of the same type. The alcohol is faintly noticeable but masked well. Everything that I have read about Stone is true! I could drink this magnificent brew until I fell off the couch! Wish I had more than 2 bottles of the IPA ;( Wish I could get this in Georgia!!!"
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark gold color with not quite an inch of white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is nice and hoppy (but not strong), mainly citrus (grapefruit and lemon peel) and piney hops, with a bit of malty sweetness too. To me it tastes the same way it smells, mostly citrus and pine hops with some malt. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium and a bit slick. Drinkability is pretty good too, it's smooth and has just the right amount of carbonation to make this very easy to drink. I think this is a very solid beer, I'll definitely have to buy it more often."
"The taste is just amazing I wish we could get a micro in Ontario to start brewing something along the lines of a solid IPA ( I know we do have some good micros and beers but comparing them is like comparing the CFL and the NFL). My palate picks up a piney, citrusy hop quality followed up by a sweet malt presence and a bitter finish ( not the most bitter finish out there but still your gonna feel the IPA bite)."
"D: Dangerously easy to drink for 6.9% abv. Top notch beer. Suddenly all the bragging on the back of the bottle seems warranted. If you're a hop-head, this is hard to top."
"Overall a very nice IPA, may be the best one Ive had."
"Zum Wohl!!!"
"D- This is a decent IPA but not one of my favorites. I was surprised that the alcohol was detected in this medium ABV brew. This one is full of hop flavor and bitterness. I may revisit this one again."
"I will have to review this one from a bottle since, for some reason, I wasn't getting too much aroma and I'm sure a bottled version, or a proper glass, would improve its score."
"D- Really can't taste the alcohol. A little high for a session, but would be happy putting 3 or 4 of these down in a sittings. Another nice one from Stone's."
"Could drink more than one of these at a sitting"
"This beer poured a kind of golden/amber color with a 3 finger head, slightly cloudy, kind of like a hefe, but only not as much. Very piney and citrusy smell. The taste is a little bit citrus but very bitter. overall, this is a a quality beer. But it is too biter and the citrus hops are overpowering to me. I couldn't drink this right now agian if I wanted to. I very quality beer for the style. Just out of my personal prefrence."
"Drinking from a cold bottle 22oz. Decent aroma, with a hint of fruit. crisp mouthfeel, but than the full flavor and aftertaste comes in, and it ruins it. This beer has a somewhat insipid fruity taste mixed with hops. I don't like beer that tastes fruity, and this ruined this for me. wanted to like it but like most ales for me, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
"Awesome! I can't believe a beer of this quality came from less than 30 miles from my house! Pours a perfectly clear (leave the yeast in the bottle - this is LIVE beer) copper color with a beautiful, dense, creamy white head, leaving lacing all over the glass. The hops can be smelled a mile away. The centennial hops dominate the palate, with an exceptionally strong bitterness from Magnum (perfect for blending without a strong taste imparted). Taste is that of citrusy fruits, with a strong hop bitterness that perfectly balances the malty sweetness. Mouthfeel: Light and slick, with a pleasant tingling on the tongue. A sweet/citrusey aftertaste lingers in the background. Overall, one of my favorite beers. Goes great with Bob Sagat live (inside joke)."
""
"Good, simple, ""pure"" IPA from the almighty Stone brewery. This IPA pours a light orange/amber color, like a glass of cold apple juice, into a pint glass, leaving a decent off white head. As I consume the beer, a good lace forms on the walls of the glass. The smell is of citrusy hops and not much else. Pure, clean grapefruit and orange. The taste follows the smell nicely with pure citrus and some alcohol. Quite bitter. The mouthfeel is light and adds to the refreshing quality of this beer. This ale is nicely drinkable once one gets used to the hop attack. Overall, this reminds me of my more familiar midwest favorite, Bell's Two Hearted Ale. Like Two Hearted, this ale has a simple, pure, and delicious character dominated by citrus, particlarly grapefruit, rather than a complex, malty profile."
"Drinkability: As the beer warms up it looses it's drinkability because of the overpowering grapefruit flavour that blocks out anything else. YES IPA's usually have a high bitterness, but this one is quite smooth and enjoyable while cold. When it becomes Warm it destroys any previous thoughts you may have on the drink."
"The taste is really smooth. One of the smoothest American IPA's I have tried. Here in the NW this style seems to rule the run of the mill beer or supermarket store alleys. The mouthfeel is good but really soft and leaves right away. This beer tastes really good. I will definitely have it again. It seems to be lighter version of style."
"Drinkability  This brew has great drinkability. It is very easy drinking. 6.9% ABV is fairly light for me  I could (and have) easily session this one all night long."
"Kudos to Stone, as always."
"The drinkability of this brew is astounding. Quite possibly one of the smoothest IPAs I've ever had. Another top notch brew from stone."
"Overall a great IPA. Tons of hops, but also a great balance that makes this a go-to beer for those looking for a very hoppy beer without and overwhelming ""hop-bomb"" characteristic."
"Overall I was extremely pleased with this IPA. I would say for a plain IPA, it's better than the 60 Minute. I wish that I didn't have to go to MA for this beer, but it's worth the drive to Yankee Spirits! Can't wait to get my lips on this beer again!"
"Well, I've had this IPA many times before and I always ""assumed"" that I had already reviewed it. My bad."
"Drinkability- This is a very solid IPA that I enjoyed quite a bit. It has the balance that is needed with the extraordinary amount of hops that are in this brew. As a daily brew to sit and sip on, this has too much hops for me. As a brew to sit and enjoy once-in-a-while or with some fantastic Thai food."
"Mouthfeel is initially slick, but bubbles tingle further down the tongue, becoming fuller and creamy. A little tannic, but not much. Very drinkable, very smooth. Good beer."
"Drinkability: Great. Beers like this deserve to be imbibed until ossification. Seriously, it is a great beer that I would consume a lot of if given the chance. How much for a keg? ;-)"
"This one has a very nice pour. The head dissapates slowly and you are left with orange-gold colored beer. The smell is filled with hops (fruity). The taste was smooth at first and went down with a hint of bitterness. This is still a good beer that I will enjoy because I bought more than 1 and I am not dissapointed"
"Drinkability: Fantastic. If it weren't for the high abv, this would be quite the sessionable brew"
"A tasty, well-balanced IPA full in flavor yet light and drinkable."
"22oz bomber poured into a Stone IPA glass. A slightly hazy pale orange with a decent slowly diminishing head that left spotty lacing on the glass. The aroma is a nice blend of citrus hops and sweet malts. Taste is a wonderful hop blend with a sweet creamy maltiness providing a great balance with hops only slightly overpowering, not at all too much for an IPA. The beer is actually light and crisp and very refreshing, the alcohol is very well hidden. This is certainly one of my favorite IPA, I can't wait to see Stone in NC, and am hoping the rumors of early '08 are true."
"D- pretty solid however if i were picking between this bottle and the ruination, ill prolly pick ruination every time"
"A very nice example of an IPA from a brewery renowned for the style."
"Pour was a nice light amber, leaving a medium white head and decent lacing. Smell was lovely. Grapefruit, citrus hops with some floral notes as well. Some sweet caramel malts in there also. Taste was much of the same. Juicy, citrus hop flavor with a good floral attribute that followed smell closely. Malts add a little backbone and make this a near balanced treat. Mouthfeel is thirst quenching. A little bittersweet tingle on the tongue that is great. Drinkability is also up there. Doesn't seem like a 6.9% IPA, more like 6 tops to me. One of my favorites within the style. I'd put it up with the Two Hearted."
"As I finished drinking this beer I was left with one thought... I'm not worthy! Cheers to Mr. Koch."
"Drinkability: This is a great beer any time of day/year/millenium. I loved it. Wonderful stuff from Stone."
"If not for the 6.9 ABV, I could indulge on this a while. After a couple of pints, thought I'd better ease up, had to drive. An excellent summertime refresher."
"O: Overall, this is a well-crafted IPA, solid on all fronts. You'd be lucky to call this an old stand by. This is definitely one of the better and more well-known IPA's."
"probably a good idea this beer is damn near impossible to get here :)"
"Overall, it's a good IPA. Bold taste, but still drinkable. I am about to have a second. It would pair nicely with spicy foods, which I am about to do."
"Update: I like the color-more golden, pale malts, but there has been some sediment. Nose has not jumped out as much with the hops. Bitterness is a bit harsh and astringent-enamel removing. Still good though."
"Overall, this will probably become one of my first choices for parties/BBQs. This is a rather bold I.P.A. with a lot of hops. Still, I think it's well-balanced enough to appeal to anyone who likes the style. Unless hops scare you, you'll probably enjoy this beer."
"This beer is a very solid IPA and a great go-to beer."
"Overall, very drinkalbe. I'd definitely recommend to hop heads and anyone looking to gain an appreciation for what an IPA is supposed to taste like."
"Taste is much like the aroma, but the hops are a bit less on the sweet side and pack quite the bitter punch. Some orange peel as well. Mouthfeel is crisp, refreshing, and has a lingering hoppy bite that lasts just the right amount of time. Definately a beer that's drinkable as hell, I could easily have 3-4 of these in one sitting. Fantastic offering from Stone, they haven't disappointed yet."
"Excellent brew, what less could you expect out of Stone. Lacing like whoa, not the most powerful of aromas though. Nothing like ruination. Good balance, smooth beer. Mouthfeel was pretty good, but sometihng wasnt sitting well with me, cant put my finger on it. Tastes a nice bit of hoppiness but nothing to overwhelming. Bit of an alcohol presence unfortunately, which surprises me since Stone Ruination is nearly a percent higher, and I just finished one of those and tasted no alcohol. Oh well, very good beer nonetheless, but this will be my last today cause Stones other quality is they get you drunk fast... God Bless Hops."
"D: Very good for an IPA, and easily available at almost every corner liquor store in Huntington."
"Another great product from the Stone Brewery."
"Pours a honey colored yellowish with tones of carbonation bubbling up, capping with a 1/4 inch of thin but sticky foam that forms a reverse meniscus. The head is attractive, but otherwise looks tame. Grapefruit and orange hit the nostrils first with a bit of toasty, cracker-like malt peeking through. Again, nothing earth-shattering. Oh, but that first sip certainly suggests something out of the ordinary. The grapefruit hinted at in the nose is there in full force in a bitter, piney onslaught. The middle is a lovely, cracker flavored joy. For a brewery that prides itself on monster hops, I am surprised to see the amount of delicious malt that is present. Its a beautiful counterbalance. Ah, the appearance gets better as it goes along. this is some of the stickiest, prettiest head I've seen, with waves of lace latching onto the side of the glass. Lovely... The aftertaste is dry and sweet and fairly long-lasting. I've had Ruination, which is a hop-bomb to say the least. But this is remarkably balanced for a west-coast IPA. Definately a treat."
"Taste wise, she is refreshing, of course hoppy, but with flavours, citrus, floral, herbal and piney flavours the hops, but quite balanced with the malt, quite balanced actually."
"Pours very clear golden with thick, ~3"" head and very bubbly body. The head is long-lived, thinning slowly while drinking and leaving lace with large bubbles. The smell is clean, piney hops with some lemon-citrus and just a little bready. Nice balance of malt and hops on the initial flavor and is weighted, as expected, to hops. Lightly sweet, warm bitter aftertaste that is average to long-lived. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a slightly creamy texture, lively carbonation, and light to moderately acidic. This is a tasty IPA that I will definitely buy again. Not necessarily my favorite but it compares very well to others I have been tasting."
"Bottle. Poured a cloudy golden color with floating sediment and a thick white head. Strong lacing. Great hoppy aroma with nice citrus tones to it. Pleasant mouthfeel. Flavor is hoppy with hints of pine and grapefruit. Another tasty offering from Stone."
"Drinkability:Goes down well, although a few of these might fill you up. No regrets getting this one."
"Poured from a painted 12 oz. bottle into my Sly Fox shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a slightly hazy golden yellow color with about two fingers of off-white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a nice lace on the inside of the glass. Smells of fresh citrus and fragrant, woody pine followed by sweet caramel malt. Tastes of sweet citrus fruits(orange and lemon), and bitter hops all followed by wonderful, sweet malts to balance it all out. Medium in both body and carbonation. This is a beer that I keep coming back to quite often."
"Very nice citrus mixed with woodsy aroma with a cloudy golden color. The taste is fairly typical in the hop department for an IPA, but taste beyond the hops and you'll find this to be an excellent beer. Followed this up with DOgFish head 60 minute..."
"A 22oz bomber poured into a pint glass. Hazy orange color with a small head and a little bit of lacing. Citrus aroma as well as some pine. It had a nice grapefruit taste, with a peppery feel late. This was a pretty smooth IPA, not aggressively hopped. A person coul drink some of these and still have his taste buds intact."
"Moderate hop presence up front with a substantial level of malt to iron things out, and of course, a hop sting in the middle. Finish was nice and smooth with a dry bitterness that I liken to biting the rind of a piece of citrus fruit. I must admit, I am indeed surprised with this one. A nice representation of the style that isn't over-done like so many others."
"This is the only beer I have ever had and even thought of scoring a perfect 5. And yes, as the tips suggest, I would say with conviction that nothing could be improved in this beer. It pours a medium brown with a thin head. The nose is pure hop and the first taste backs that right up. Then the pleasant surprise is a ""fruitty"" pop at the back end, but the bitterness of the hops still hang around. This is ""the"" beer for me. The ""stuck on a desert island with only one choice"" beer. Try it, you will not be dissapointed."
"Picked this one up in Medford Square. Poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass a orange/gold color, with a thick two finger heading. Aroma was largely a bouquet of sweet smells of citrus, dew, and even a hint of white vanilla cake. Although not as dominant, there was also a bit of grassy earth notes in the aroma as well. Taste was filled with citrus hops and grassy undertones. The balance on this beer is insane...hoppy but not overly bitter. Mouthfeel was also surprisingly light considering this brewery. I really like this beer. I still think the Ruination has a slight edge, but this is definitely worth tasting. Good job Stone."
"It's medium-bodied with mucho complexity--the hops dominate the ride, but their provide different sensations on the palate all the way through. Very drinkable for those partial to the hops. Another killer from Stone."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. This beer poured a clear light amber color with a thick bubbly head that slowy faded away leaving some thick lace on the glass. Carbonation is noticable. Aroma is all citrus hops. Flavor is caramel malt with some spice notes. Undertones of grapefruit and pine are also present. You feel a nice spicy hop bite on your tounge. The beer is medium-bodied. It ends with a very dry, bitter finish. This is an above average IPA, but for me I would prefer a little bit bigger flavor to go along with the excellent hop kick."
"Poured a very nice golden hazy color. Aromas of hops, and it tastes pretty darn good. It is a great IPA for all occations. I feel that it is almost a bit session-ish, well at least for me. It is one of the few beers that I can never get tired of, or ever stop drinking."
"Stone hits this one out of the park. Very good IPA and very drinkable. If it was a little cheaper for a six pack, I'd have this one all the time. Great everyday beer for the fridge. Stone is quickly becoming one of my favortie beweries. I've been on the lookout for some ""oaked"" stone six packs in Oregon, but haven't been able to find any. This is a taste beer. Did I mention this was a good beer?"
"A nicely balanced beer from Stone. I would like it a lot more if it didn't feel so light-bodied and if it weren't so lacking in carbonation, but it's still one of the better American IPAs I've had. This is a must to try if you like IPAs, and recommendable in general as well."
"Poured a hazy-amber orange with a sticky, thick off-white head with excellent retention. The smell was dominated by piney, grapefruity aromas giving good anticipation of hoppiness. The taste was a knockout. wonderful grapefruity hoppiness balanced beautifully with a pungent malty sweet/sourness. Nice quenching, dry finish. Became much more bitter as it warmed up. Good crispness in the mouth. Not as sessionable as some other IPAs because of the slightly higher ABV, but enjoyable nonetheless. I look forward to having this again and again -- definitely worth the 20-minute trip to Julio's for this one!"
"D- This is a great example of a west coast IPA that is easy-drinking and full of hoppy goodness that is far from overwhelming. It falls a little short of its cross-town IPA cohort at Alesmith, but still a great choice!"
"Drinks like a session beer but at 6.9% ABV i won't be knocking these back. This one is nice but not living up to the hype."
"The taste is balanced. for a hop head, too balanced. i was hoping for more bitterness, but without a doubt a good brew. the first flavors i taste are the slightly sweet malts, but then the hops kick in and make it what it is. a good american ipa."
"D: A very quaffable IPA. It goes down easy and smooth even with all the dominant bitter hops present in the brew. A big IPA, not for those that not like hops shoved in their mouth. A very solid and very good IPA."
"Easy drinking with a crisp, mildly bitter and dry finish. Pine & citrus, light malt. Very nice, and you can't go wrong with this as far as a standard IPA is concerned. Recommended."
"12oz bottle. Pours a light bronze with notable carbonation. Aroma is divine with the smell of fresh hops - going so far as to remind me of the aroma of some cask ales. Flavour is heavy hops on the piney side. Bold and full hoppy aftertaste. Rewarding. RE-RATE: Just had a fresh bottle. Absolutely outstanding. The fresh hops weren't as piney as I previously found."
"It's a damn shame too, because it smells so nice."
"On-tap at Heroe's last night. Same glowing appearance, but not as much head. The dry-hopping isn't as overpowering as it is from the bottle, but the flavor isn't as bitter, more sweet citrus. This makes the beer much more drinkable and refreshing on draft compared to the bottle."
"Poured a bomber into my arrogant bastard specialty glass, pours an orange rustic color with a fluffy foamy head that stays the entire time and leaves some lace on the glass. Smell is pretty hoppy citrusy and grassy. Taste is bitter like grapefruits and also some citrus hops in the mix, I do enjoy this brew but other bottles that I have had seemed to taste a bit better, this is still an extremly good brew and a damn fine IPA plus stone has the coolest bottles ever."
"Pours a golden apricot color with a two finger head that recedes to about 1mm. Smells of hops and pine. Unlike the rich hoppy scent, this beer seems to be lacking on the IPA flavor. Its not as sweet as I expected and the malt was lacking . I did pick up coraiander, spices, apple, and citrus fruits along with hops and a bit of alcohol. The carbonation was good and the body was medium. Although not bad, being an IPA lover this one didn't do it for me"
"D- Because of the balance, this is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. Good in the hops, wonderful malt. mmm."
"D- Very. The 6.9% alcohol would prevent me from have too many, but the ones I did have would be fun. Another fine Stone product!"
"The Stone IPA is a great beer, but not the perfect example of an IPA. Poured into a glass it's slightly cloudy, with a golden tint. The aroma is citrusy with a good load of hops, although not as much as I expected. While clearly a hop-based beer, the IPA is lacking slightly in the truly bitter hops experience I expect from a west coast IPA. There is little (but noticeable) malt flavor, but the hop intensity just isn't there. The citrus and bitterness is prevalent, but the bitterness quickly subsides to a mild bite. Although this detracts from the expected IPA characteristics, it makes the beer very drinkable. Highly sessionable, but not the best example of an American IPA. Still a great beer."
"Overall, this is a very tasty IPA. It's hops are the star here, but the malt is very tasty as well."
"The taste was very good, but I was expecting more of the hoppy bitterness. That being said, it is very drinkable, and if I was not expecting more bitterness I would probably rate it higher."
"Drinkability - this a very good AIPA, one that showcases the hops, if maybe neglecting the malt. It is also sessionable."
"Finish is long and mildly bitter. yum"
"great beer. I got it based on its beer advocate rating of 91. Pours a hazy gold with a good head. The smell has an almost orange aroma to it along with hoppiness. The taste is fantastic. More orange flavor and again big hops. It also tastes a bit creamy to me. Finishes very clean and crisp. I need to get some broken halo IPA from Widmer and see which I like better."
"A different sort of IPA, which is very welcome. I didnt get any distinct malt profile of this one, but the citrus hops were an interesting mix of smooth flavor and powerful bitterness. This, with the lack of malt flavor, make the mouthfeel seem a little empty while making it more drinkable at the same time. Huh. Try it anyways."
"This is a decent IPA. Not the best I've ever had but not one I would kick out of bed either."
"So good you'll want more despite the relatively strong taste and higher alcohol. Lovely."
"Stone IPA pours a slightly hazy yellow orange with a thin head. Aroma is huge C hops, maybe Centennial and Amarillo, it is sweet and citrusy. Flavor comes on with sweet, fruity malt quickly followed by a nice rounded bitterness that leads in to more really citrusy hops. The hop flavor is sweet orange and ripe grapefruit. Overall a delicious and drinkable IPA, completely hiding its 7% abv. I've been meaning to pick this one up for a while now and I am not disappointed."
"D- Overall a quality IPA. Not my favorite, but not disappointing by any means."
"Found his on-tap at a new restaurant in Columbus called Fabian's. I was impressed to find it there. Pours a clear, golden honey yellow with a thin white head. A tiny bit of retention and lacing on it. Smells and tastes aren't terribly strong (I have to admit that I'm approaching this beer having had Stone's Ruination and 10th Anniversary IPAs), but they're nice and balanced. Good blend of grapefruity hops, with a touch of honey, malty sweetness. Medium mouthfeel, a little carbonation - seems appropriate for the style. If you're looking for crazy hops, this is not the beer, but it's still a superior example of an IPA - well balanced, wonderful to drink. Highly recommended."
"Again , my sports day was not that great but finding a beer with this wonderful flavor turned my sports Saturday around ,"
"Now this is an IPA. Where other beer try to lean too much on hops, Stone gets the balance just right. There is a plenty big hop character here, comprising much of the flavor. Citrus (a nice lemon zest, if I do say so myself), pine, earthiness, are all on the palate. However, this is offset by a wonderful maltiness that compliments these bitter flavors. Mouthfeel is also very clean, and there's a dry finish. This is an incredibly drinkable beer, I had no idea it was close to 7%. Overall this is the best standard IPA I've had."
"Highly drinkable, I'm trying to resist drinking the rest of this 6-pack before I go to work."
"Taste is very clean, not an overwhelming citrus flavor to it, but enough to convince you that it's an A-IPA. Floral whaffs also affect the taste buds. Really nice balance considering the style between the hops, malt and their by-product offerings."
"A very good IPA, but one I don't think I'd drink all of the time. Be warned, this one is all hops. If you don't like bitter beers you'd better stay away."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, I think that this is a beer that I could get used to drinking on a regular basis."
"The beer is a golden orange with a very frothy head. There is more than lacing on the glass, almost clumps of left over head. The smell is aromatic, sweet, a bit citrusy, not too much hoppy smell. The taste is clearly imbalanced towards the hops. When the beer warms a bit, you can taste some malt, citrus, less hoppiness, some grassiness. When its colder, the hops are just too pronounced for my tastes. The mouth feel is a bit creamy, and you can feel the hop bite in the middle, end, and aftertaste. The aftertaste is not overwhelmingly bitter but you will know that the brewers didn't spare the hops. If you love hoppy IPA's you're going to like this beer. I'm becoming less interested in them, but it's just a matter of preference for me. L'Chaim."
"The beer's appearance is a clear, orange colour with tiny bubbles consistently rising from the bottom and a good amount of head at the top. The beer's smell is rooted in citrus aroma. You could barely tell of any hops in the aroma. As for the taste, the aroma translates very well. A sweet, citrus taste with a light bounce on the palate. The mouth feel reveals little carbonation. I found this surprising since halfway down the glass, tiny bubbles still rose to the top. Given that mouth feel is light, I could drink this every night in the warm Spring weather. Maybe that is why I enjoyed this brew when I used to live in SoCal. This IPA is highly recommended."
"Pours a just-shy-of-clear bright amber color, with golden highlights and a big, dense head of white foam that leaves tons of lace. Huge aroma of American hops -- citrus and pine sap and metals. There's a nice, sweet blood orange note in there. Only the slimmest hint of amber malts makes it through. On the palate, the mouthfeel is extremely smooth considering all the hops in this thing. Carbonation is biting but fine-bubbled. The taste is extraordinary, and precisely what you would want in an American IPA. It's almost harshly bitter, but the malt payload is enough to keep things smooth, albeit still massively imbalanced. In the midst of all those citrus and metallic notes is a notable lack of acrid fusel oils or any other detracting byproducts of massive hop bitterness. Overall, this is an incredible IPA. It's big and brash, but not out of whack in its flavors and aromas... huge, imbalanced, but still drinkable, which is a pretty remarkable achievement."
"In terms of the style, this falls just short of AleSmith in flavor, but I love the extra bitterness and that's about it for IPAs I'd perhaps choose over this. Crisp and refreshing as hell, can't wait to have another!"
"D - Overall extremely enjoyable and totally sessionable IPA. This could be a staple everynight drinker and would love to see this in a keg in my kitchen!"
"Drinkability - This brewhaha just flat out ruled. Definetly going to have to check out the rest of the Stone line of ales after this winner and on a side note the bottle is top quality too (etched graphics over a pasted label=top notch). I look forward to pairing this bad boy against a local fav Hopdevil Ale from Victory next week. Enjoy!"
"drinkability- this is a total joy to drink. as a hophead, i am rarely so endulged. not a hurtfully bitter beer, the hops are noticed in their flavor contribution, and the freshness is hard to beat. i'm also pleased to actually taste the malt, and not the alcohol (in excess anyway.) overall, well crafted and delicious!"
"drinkability: this is an IPA lovers dream could drink this all day!! very thirst quenching, goes great with spicy dishes."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orangey golden. Aroma is the show stopper with a wonderful bouquet of citrus hops with grapefuit up front. Taste follows the aroma with more floral hops than anticipated. A little bit on the bitter side, but not in a bad way. Mouthfeel is smooth and clean. Highly drinkable. Nice IPA."
"In your face hops within a well rounded flavor palette. Hats off and bang a gong."
"Overall an outstanding brew, one that Stone has done a very good job with. Huge hop flavor, but without the huge alcohol. Highly recommended."
"Appeared a very nice foggy straw color with thin head that died down a bit after pour. Lacing was quite sticking and grainy that retained throughout. Smell was excellent, I absolutely can't stop taking whiff after whiff of this brew. Such a clean and crisp scent of grapefruit with a hint of evergreen pine. I would definitely burn a candle with this smell! Taste wasn't what I expected from the smell, but it was still good. Hops are there, but not overpowering. Grassy spice with a piney zest. Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth for an IPA, very subtle bitter bite. The yeasty finish balances this beer out almost perfectly. Such a good job designing this brew. Great IPA, I wish I tried it earlier but I was too distracted by Arrogant Bastard and Ruination. Stone ""wow's"" again."
"Got a bottle of this at East Gate Liquors in Wilmington last thursday. After finishign it off, I was glad I chose it. It poured a light orange, mostly yellow with a thick, creamy head. Lacing was nice and the aroma was great. Seemed mostly piney on my nose. Initial taste was bitter, but mellowed on the way down and was slightly sweet, but not enough to let you forget you're drinking a west coast IPA style beer. Really nice IPA."
"Not much to look at -- brassy gold, foamy head which dissipates quickly. Smells fantastic -- citrus (pineapple/grapefruit) and pine -- the hops aren't overwhelming like some other IPAs because of the sweet sweet malt. Tastes nearly as good -- this is a real cornacopia of hop tastes -- spice, citrus, bitters, and more citrus (in that order), which somehow drops off, leaving you with a sweet piney, slightly bitter finish. A remarkable beer. Fine carbonation and a creamy body make it very drinkable. Three cheers for Stone!"
"Pours a light yellow with a frothy white head that fades quickly. The smell is dominated by a floral aromas of hops. This one is dry hopped to give the added aroma to the beer. The taste is not as hoppy as the smell but still very large. The taste starts sweet and hoppy and is followed by the bitter taste, which isn't very strong considering the amount of hops in the smell and taste. A decent amount of carbonation and a great balance make this beer an easy drinker for any hop head. A great brew from a great brewery, check this one out! Enjoy!"
"Overall a great rendition of its style, definitely focuses more on the floral hop variety and its dry malt backbone."
"When poured into a simple mug, the beer was a hazy metallic honey orange with a thin layer of white bubbly foam that was supposed to act as the head of foam. It fizzled away into a small trace of white bubbly rings and lace around the mug. When I first popped the cap, It smelled like I twisted the cap off a bottle of Pine Sol. I didn't know if I was suppose to drink it or clean the floors with it. When it settled in the mug, the strong aroma of Pine Sol was still there, as well as some citrus hops and a hint of citrus fruits in the background. It tasted like somebody started growing grapefruits on pine trees and you took one of those trees and shoved one into your mouth. It was that piney and citrusy! Behind the grapefruit pine tree was a few other citrus fruits, citrus hops, and just the slightest hint of toasted malt at the end. The mouthfeel was very crisp with a strong aftertaste of sharp pine needles and citrus hops. It also completely masks it alcohol content. Pine and citrus hops conquers all! Overall a very good citrusy and piney IPA. I don't think I've had an IPA that was so strong in pine and citrus. I think I should have bought their 22 oz. bomber bottle because this little 12 oz. bottle doesn't go very far. If you like eating pine trees, then give IPA a try."
"Overall: IMO, a top-class IPA. Ranks up there with Victory HopDevil."
"D-Extremely drinkable despite it's aggressive character. This is one of my favorite beers and not a month goes by without having one."
"D: Ovrall its very drinkable especially for the IPA crowd. almost 7% is a bit high for an every day beer, but very smooth and easy to enjoy anytime"
"Slightly cloudy golden/copper with a bready off white head showing good stick. Big juicy tropical fruit nose, pineapple, and some hoppy esters. Mouthfeel is smooth with a full crisp froth around the palate. The taste is of citrus pith, pulpy fruit, some bready grains, an aggressive bitterness, sprucey, and hot spicy hops. The subtle sweet malt balances well with a honey sweetness. The finish is dry, bready, floral/herbal character and a lasting hoppy spice."
"Sweet maltiness and mild grapefruit leads to herbal spiciness in the hop finish. Nice soft mouthfeel keeps the hop acidity from being overwhelming. While not a well balanced IPA overall (definately leans towards hop bitterness), Stone IPA seems to be more balanced than many hop-bursting American IPAs. I find this IPA a little easier to drink than some of the more heavier-bodied IPAs... gets me the hop fix without filling me up on 1 pint (or 22oz bottle)!"
"The second of the gift beers from my friend in AZ. I've had this on my trips to the southwest and it is an excellent beer. Nicely balanced but still enough hops to satisfy. Good stuff."
"Super easy to drink. Sampled in 2 different bars and nose was incredible, in both a crowded smokin' spot and an empty lunch crowd."
"Cloudy bright amber in color. Powerful hops aroma, some citrus coming through. The taste is not as hoppy as it smells. I guess the bark is worse than the bite. Very smooth beer, especially for an IPA. Overall a good drink for a small session. Half of the attraction is the bottle art, for sure."
"Taste of US hops, spicy grapefruit and a slight resinous, oily hop taste. Bitterness is pretty clean. The malts are not upfront, but come in second to the hops. Maltiness is also mild and pleasing. The yeast gives a clean profile, no real fruitiness or spiciness. Carbonation is a little too much, rolling the beer in my mouth, a lot of gas comes out. Body is medium and the beer is slightly sticky, but not as sticky and full-bodied as other IPAs. Very good balance!"
"Tastes absolutely delicious. It has that hoppy bite that comes with the style, but doesn't overdue it and there is a pleasant malt flavor underneath that carries very well. The bite is enough to tell you its an IPA but not so much that it isn't an easy drinker. Thin yet still frothy mouthfeel that along with the balanced taste make this one of the easiest drinking IPAs I've ever had. Highly recommended."
"D: Very drinkable. A very good beer, well deserving of a 91."
"Stone IPA is a fine example of the style. It may not be at the top of my list for IPAs, but it's close."
"I felt a little dissapointed in the complexity and punch of this one. I was expecting more. I feel there are better American IPAs out there."
"Drinkability: My favorite ipa, I could session this beer all night. 10 bucks a sixer (in mass) is worth it for me."
"With the last sip I consumed the head, this is the mark of a great head."
"Pours a golden haze, with an unexpectedly dense head that holds it own all the way down the pint glass. The smell reveals the lemony character of the hops, which are well placed and bold, but not overpowering. A subtle malt undertone creates a complex balance between the two that gives the beer a great drinkability. Carbonation is lower than most IPAs. The depth of the malt/hop balance, along with the smooth delivery, make for a very enjoyable brew. The aftertaste is a ringing endorsement of the lemony character present in the hops."
"A very nice IPA. One of my favorite and I have tried quite a few. Come to think of it, I think its time for another. It definitely has a big hop flavor yet the aftertaste is not overlingering as some heavily hopped IPAs tend to be. The aroma is also very nice. Overall a very drinkable IPA when you want to sit down, relax and enjoy a quality beer."
"From a bomber this is a nice dark copper color with a fluffy white head that recedes to a nice lace. Leaves beautiful lace as I drink it down. Smells very citrusy, piney. Some grapfruit and orange peel as well as florally hops. Taste is not as bitter as I had expected. Hops are certainly present, but this brew is suprisingly smooth. Dry in the finish. Quite good. Yet another great selection from Stone. Can they do no wrong?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Lightly carbonated going in, it never gets interesting enough to best highlight the hop and malt features to its potential. It's a flavorful, fresh hop fix for sure... and the burps are frequent and quite tasty, actually... but not the gem of an IPA I recall not long ago."
"Cheers!"
"I love drinking this beer, exeptional drinkability."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: This brew is light and very smooth. Nice carbonation level. Definitely one of the few Stone brews that I could session. I could drink this all night. Overall, this is probably my second favorite IPA on the market (Alesmith takes the cake). Great offering from Stone."
"Drinkability: This is almost 7% ABV? Wow. I am not prepared to drink another one (no more in the fridge) and I only have 5 left next time I go back to MI I may be picking up another 6 pack, or a case this beer could easily become a new favorite. I need to try it 5 degrees colder."
"I absolutely love this beer. The aroma is very piney/citrusy which is very typical for a West Coast microbrew. Carbonation was excellent and the lacing was good too. The color is almost golden. The taste is very malty with very prounouced hops. All in all, this is over of my favorites that I always keep stocked in my fridge. I would highly recommend this very balanced beer."
"Overall, a insanely drinkable beer. the lower carbonation makes this slide right down. a great and well crafted beer that doesnt prove itself by overdoing the bitterness (though they advertise they do)."
"The taste is mostly all hops with a slight grainy malt presence to add character. Again the citrus is in full command of the taste as in the nose. Well done!"
"Stone IPA has a nice fruity/malty aroma. Its a nice golden copper color with some mild carbonation and a thin flat white head that look really tasty. It hits your tongue with a nice crisp taste that is followed up by a thick malty flavored aftertaste that has a hint of sweetness to it and goes down quite easily."
"App. - 4.5, Smell - 4.0, Taste - 4.0, Mouth - 4.0, Drink - 4.0"
"This beer poured a clear golden color with a thick white head  some lacing. The smell is very hoppy. It also has a spicy aroma. The taste is very hoppy with enough malt to keep it just in balance. There is a bit of a bitter taste and aftertaste  but is quite enjoyable. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation gives it a little something extra. I find this an enjoyable IPA that will be at the top of my preferred list when Im in the mood for one."
"Mouthfeel is nice and medium-light bodied. A very drinkable IPA that goes down easier than 6.9% might suggest."
"Drinkability: A solid IPA that I'm sure I will be drinking again."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: A massively sessionable IPA that, I would argue, is the flagship session beer of the craft beer world. It gets the point across - this is a sessionable beer that does not yank or push, but retains a sense of easibility and likeability."
"Drinkability: A well balanced drink, suprising from Stone. A good example of the style without falling prey to the notion that everything must be extreme."
"Stone's IPA is a classic West Coast IPA. There may be IPAs I enjoy more, but this is basically a flawless example of the style."
"12 oz bottle which I poured into a ruination mug. The color is dark yellow and almost clear. The smell is wonderful but not overwhelming. I think I can smell grapefruit, but better than grapefruit (cause I don't like grapefruit). The taste is slightly bitter and the mouthfeel is pleasant. This beer goes down way too easy and that is why it is one of my favorites. This is yet another winner from the good folks down in San Diego."
"Pours a light golden with a frothy white head that leaves some decent lacing. The smell is of orange and grapefruit citrus with a little bit of spiciness. The taste is mostly spicy hops up front and some attenuated malt at the finish. A bit grainy, but fairly balanced. The hop profile doesn't blow me away,but its solid. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and with a good carbonation level. Its a little rough in the mouth, it could stand to be smoothed out a bit. Good solid IPA, quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: Top notch IPA, stands out for the hops, not much toastiness or other flavors, this beer is about the hops. It went very well with my rack of herb crusted lamb, it cut through the fattiness."
"Drinkability - Very good. I'm not a big noble hops fan, so I probably wouldn't drink many of these at one time. Good beer."
"D: This is a classic West Coast IPA. Rock solid in the balance catagory. Insanely drinkable! Highly recommended."
"highly drinkable. i know of a place where it is on tap and i will be putting in a session on it soon. Stay tuned!"
"D: Whew, scary. Goes down too easy!"
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very enjoyable brew. i've had this one several times and just finally getting around to reviewing it. great stuff."
"Medium mouthfeel,very tangy,syrupy,fairly smooth with good drinkability.Very good on tap seemed to like the bottled version a little better. Liked my last keg of Bell's two-hearted better."
"All in all this is a class leading IPA. I could drink this the rest of my life and be a happy guy. Too bad the closest distriution is a several hundred miles away."
"Poured from a 22 oz. into a favorite mug producing a nice, thick, foamy head which stuck around for most of the drink. The aroma was a very strong citrus aroma (which though not my cup 'o tea was still pleasant. Mouthfeel was very pleasant with just a hint of alcohol warmth. Love the taste which only got better as the drink went on (not surprisingly) This is a very good beer that I would gladly have more of."
"D: If I had the money, this beer would be in my house at all times. A must try."
"interestingly, the toasty ale flavors seem to finish on at the front of the tongue, with the hops finishing in rear corners of the mouth. seeing that this is precisely how taste buds work naturally, i think this is a ringing natural endorsement of this beer and its ingredients."
"Medium carbonated and prickly mouthfeel. Delicously drinkable."
"Overall-Simply put one of the best IPAs I've ever had, it's taken me forever to try Stone beers and now that I've had one I can't wait to try more. Astoundingly good."
"I enjoy this beer and when in the mood for an IPA this would be on my list of ones to buy."
"If you live in CA and reading this review, you probably already know about this beer...if you live outside of CA and can get your hands on this stuff, do it."
"Stone comes through again. I've never had a beer of theirs that I didn't love and this is no exception. The hops show off their bitterness much more than their flavor and sweetness, and I can appreciate that. I'm just glad I had my own bottle this time."
"I forgot how good this IPA is. I need to pick this one up more often... especially now that the six packs are showing up here more often. Very drinkable."
"Overall, this is one fantastic IPA. Very aggressively hopped, but not at the expense of balance or drinkability. At 6.9%, this is no session brew, but I've a feeling I could drink a lot of these before I realized I was hurting myself. I've yet to try a Stone beer I haven't absolutely loved, and this one kept that streak intact. Now I can only hope my travels take me into Stone distribution territory again soon. This is well worth looking for."
"I have to rank this as the best IPA I've reviewed so far."
"D- Can I have another? and another? and another?"
"This is very drinkable, one of the more drinkable IPAs I've tried. Goes down surprisingly easy for something which is approaching 7% ABV. Advise caution with this guy."
"Poured a light amber color with a small off-white head that faded down quickly. Stable aromas of floral hops, citrus, even some slight skunky quality in there. Taste shows more than the aromas with an even and refreshing hop bite (citrus, pine), perfect carbonation, very smooth and highly drinkable, especially for an IPA. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable for an IPA. The hops are very noticable without banging you over the head. One of the best IPAs out there."
"D: I have no problem knocking a couple of these back. Arguably the premier West Coast IPA."
"D: Not being a hophead I would limit myself to one a session, but could see how lupulin lovers could session this stuff. As expected, another well crafted offering from the boys in San Diego."
"Color was a hazy amber color, lightening near the bottom of the glass and darker at the top. Head was full and fluffy, dissipated after a couple of minutes. Once poured, the beer had a slight floral hop scent, with a strong undercurrent of citrus, specifically something reminiscent of grapefruit. The taste was true to the description on the bottle, very bitter hops, with the grapefruit coming through as well. The mouthfeel was slightly crisp, with a good deal of carbonation. Considering the strong hop flavor, one would expect the beer to taste somewhat crisper, but it almost seemed dulled somehow. The drinkability is surprisingly good. I'm personally not a fan of the deep bitter flavor in this one, but I'm sure fans of the style would LOVE this beer. I would recommend it to fans of IPAs, but for me, I think I'll probably pass next time."
""
"Overall, a good beer from Stone but not all that memorable."
"This IPA poured a hazy, light amber color. The foam was flouffy and faintly yellow, and it persisted a long time and clinged to the inside of the glass. The smell was light floral hops with a little malt. The taste was malty and a touch sweet with moderate hoppiness. Alcohol was tasted, and there was a light hint of oxidation. The mouthfeel was smooth and hoppy with medium body and moderate carbonation. It was relatively clean. This was a good, easy to drink IPA."
"Although IPA is not my favorite style, I must say this is a very good beer. Goes perfect with Indian food (which is what I paired it with for this review). The color is a pretty, clear, bright, light, pumpkin orange. The head is moderate and bubbly. It doesn't last long (though it doesn't dissipate immediately either), but leaves light lacing all the way down. The aroma is really great. The hops are very nice. The mouthfeel is full, almost creamy even, not watery at all. The carbonation is moderate with just the right amount of bite. The taste is somewhat complex, well-balanced, and overall just very well-constructed. This is a good example of Stone's good work."
"D - This beer seemed a little light in the beginning but became a very nice IPA by the finish. It dinks a lot easier than a 6.9% ABV IPA also. This could easily be an everyday drinker."
"Notes: I reviewed this from the tap a few months back. Sitting in my kitchen tonight, focused on what I poured myself from the bottle, I like this beer even more now. It's become my wife's favorite, and if only it were a little cheaper, this would be my ""house"" beer."
"This is a great all around IPA. IT pours a nice cloudy amber with decent head retention and a bit of lacing. The smell is rich with hops and very piney. A bit of citrus too. That taste is a nice balance of hops and malt, with some sweet caramel notes and profound hoppiness. It has a nice dry finish and pleasant mouthfeel. Very drinkable!"
"Pours a nice light amber with two fingers of foam. Retains head very well. Very herbal on the nose. Taste is unmistakeably hoppy, like a pine cone dipped in soap, definitely makes you pucker-up. Anymore hops and this beer would be outta control, but they managed to get it pretty much right for this style."
"In my spare time, I like to go to my local homebrew supply shop, go to the freezer, and smell the canisters of hop pellets. A twirl of the glass containing this beer elicits a similar aroma, as though the hop oils are activated. This is also present in the taste. As with every Stone product I've tried, and I've tried most of them, they pull this off in enviable fashion resulting in a hell of a treat to drink."
"I was expecting so much more. Run of the mill IPA for me. FFF pale ale had more hop character than this...gotta pad this...I didn't think much of arroagant bastard either, I've heard rave after rave for this BC...I must try more or another offering of this same brew, I wouldn't want to tarnish a good reputation."
"D - 100% drinkable. everytime."
"-Oelergud"
"D: Stone's most drinkable ale, this one does not overwhelm the tastebuds or wear you out with an intense abv."
"This beer has a deep golden hue with an aroma of grapefruit, gumball, and a slight hint of pine. The hops flavor is very pronounced and it balances out in the palate quite nicely. An easy beer to drink, despite the 6.9% ABV. A clear winner from Stone Brewery."
"Priced very well, so I will probably have this in my fridge most of the time. In a glass, it looks like a Hefe, but drinks a lot better if you like slight bitterness. I cannot say enough about this beer but why should I have to, it's Stone."
"D - Highly drinkable, especially for a great price."
"On tap. Pours with hues of golden straw, and firey orange. Topped with a resiny frothy with head. Strong pungent hop aroma. Mostly pine, and then some more pine, and maybe some pine. I think I get some peachy notes too. Very clean bitterness. Crisp. First class all the way."
"M/D- almost high carbonation...refgreshing...excellent representation of the style....its what Stone does best."
"Now, the challenge lays, were can I find more, good thing they come in bombers."
"Very drinkable, great session fare. May be too bold for the hop novice, but this is a tasty treat i'd love to drink again."
"Thanks Stone!"
"Finally got around to reviewing this great brew. For me, it definitely lived up to its reputation. I wasn't expecting such a balanced brew. This is definitely not just a hop-bomb a la Ruination. I'll once again appeal to Mr. Koch to start distributing to NC."
"A great beer. This one is going to be one of my standard in fridge favorites. Would be a great beer with any chicken pasta dish. Kudos to the boys and girls at Stone for making yet another wonderful offering."
"D: I drank most of the first pint, but poured the rest of my bomber down the drain. Ruination was a great beer, but this one...not so much."
"Delivers most of the character of the Ruination IPA for a lower price point. In fact, I prefer the balance of this brew to the Ruination. A must for fans of grassy hops."
"D: I want another, I could probably drink three of these bombers, just keeps getting better with every sip."
"Dangerously drinkable. Feels full and rich, but not too heavy. An elegant quaff."
"Very good all around drinker and IMO a staple in AIPA style. Will add to favorites."
"Carbonation is a little high, which dries the mouth, but that's a niggle really. Very drinkable, and my favorite of the ""standard"" Stone offerings by far."
"D- A nice treat for a few that enjoy good IPA's. The price controls how much of this slightly stronger beer you enjoy."
"Purchased during thanksgiving in Ohio at local wine and beer store. Poured into a pint glass. A nice rich white head developed, with decent retention. The lacing has coated the glass already. The body is a warm rusty, reddish, orange amber. The smell is wonder, vanilla mixed with floral aromatic hops and mild citrus. The taste is great crisp and fresh with a very pleasant mouth feel, but all the magic comes at the finish especially after the swallow the fruit really comes out. This one also makes my burps great.The whole brew emanates a very fresh and inviting presence. Its a really subtle nice IPA."
"Drinkability: Unsurpassed drinkability! An excellent IPA charged with great hop flavors and enough malt to remain well-balanced."
"Medium mouth with just the right amount of carbonation and the hop oils do not make me pucker and they wash away clean. Very tasty and equally drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is an exceptional IPA that I could have no matter what time of year it is. Despite the excessive hopping rate this brew was in fact quite well balanced. The alcohol of this beer is well disguised but after a few drinks seemed even more than its stated 6.9% as the warmth overtook me."
"All in all, this is probably the best IPA out there. It should surprise no one that Stone does an excellent IPA, and it's no coincidence that this is one of their flagship ales, not to mention a personal favorite of mine."
"D: Overall, an excellent IPA. Cherish this beer if you can get it. If not, find a way to get some. Among my favorites of all styles, highly recommended."
"A great IPA! Pours golden / light amber. Smells of hops and citrus. The hops are balanced well with citrus flavor. Very hoppy but not out of control at all. Nicely carbonated and smooth mouthfeel. It is also very drinkable for an american IPA. A fantastic beer for a hops fix. If I have any suggestion, it would be that a bit more intensity in the hops. Don't get me wrong though, this is one of my favorite IPAs."
"Wow, this may be the holy grail of West Coast IPAs. Pours a golden color and is surprisingly opaque for a beer of such color, with a big frothy head that diminishes slowly and retains a nice lace throughout. Smell is primarily hops and it's oh so nice. Big hoppy taste up front that's beautifully balanced with malt. Very smooth and well-balanced, in fact. Hoppy, bitter finish that lasts long on the palate. Mouthfeel is fantastic; a bit thick and very creamy. I could drink this all night (or until I succumbed to the abv)."
"Poured out amber, copper color. Small head, but good lacing. The nose is all about big grapefruit hops, citrus, sour, bitter, sweet on the end. Smells great.The taste is again all about hops, it definitely smacks you, followed by a little sweetness from the malt. Extremely hoppy, yet balanced. Mouthfeel is very good, and this is fairly drinkable, but a bit much for an all night buddy."
"got this bad boy from Ross. poured a nice amber with a off white head that left some good lacing. aroma big hops, orange and lemon, grassy, a sweetness that I cannot tell if it is honey or brown sugar maybe it is both. flavor dry hops, grapefruit with no sugar on it, pine, perfume and a slight ash tray taste but not in a bad way as it warms do get some sweetness. this is a good IPA"
"D: Very nice-bodied IPA, so smooth it can be enjoyed one after another, just be mindful of the abv. Other than that, an absolutely amazing IPA, one that I think for its all-around great qualities puts it head and shoulders above many others."
"A highly unique india pale ale here. The appearance is probably the only thing close to average about this one. Copper tones with a good head. The nose is terrific! Pungent floral and citrus hops explode out of the pint glass. The taste is pure hops as well. It seems almost misleadingly subtle at first sip, until I swallow the large gulp and find a ferocious blast of hops! Not sure I've had a more powerful hoppy beer ever. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, but the thickness creates an almost slimey effect, not a bad thing, just unique. Drinkability is great for one or two, but the tremendous flavor of this one would catch up to me in a hurry."
"D: Easy to drink if you can get past the carbonation. Did I say carbonation? My tongue feels numb and smooth. Not much warming from alcohol as one would expect."
"The taste is good with that typical herbal, bitter hop flavor. I would say it is above average but not out of this world. It is very smooth and creamy for an IPA. I could definitely drink a few of these. The alcohol is very understated. It has a good mix of sweet fruit flavors with the hops kicking in to warm things up. A good example of American IPA's."
"From a great trade with IntriqKen, thanks!! Pours a deep amber reddish color with a small head. Smells hoppy and sweet, nice combo. Great hoppy taste, very nice combo of citrus and pine with still some malt sweetness too. Overall I am impressed and wish that I could find Stone up here in Maine (just may have to go to Mass. this weekend.)"
"I poured this from a 12oz bottle. The color is sort of a straw color with very little red. One finger of head lasted quite some time with nice lacing throughout. The smell is fantastic, hops and more hops. Very citrusy with some pine but not overwhelming. The taste follows the smell very well. Beautiful hops flavor, and again not too piney. Not sweet at all but has a nice balance. The mouthfeel is great, smooth to start and dry at the end. I could drink this beer all day and/or night. This to me is the best (so far) AIPA I have ever had. Gotta hand it to Stone once again for a great brew."
"That said, I'm really a stout and porter guy, so ignore this review if your tastes don't run in the stout/porter direction."
"Color of clear golden honey  head medium off white  nose of pine and bitter hopps , smoky / toasty , mint , and cloves  taste is gummy hopps , tar , and toasty malts  light bright semi carbonated body  aftertaste chewy long lasting hops and smoky malts"
" This is an IPA with lots of character and one that I'll be looking forward to exploring further."
"This is one hell of a hop brew! A bit grassy, a ton of hops, yet it is not over the top for me, and I am more of a malty fella. This beer has made me understand what people say when they say a beer is spiced, and it is a very nice touch in this offering. Very drinkable, awesome."
"Great beer. Can easily see why Stone is touted for their IPAs."
"Pale copper colored body with slightly off white head. Moderately low cap of foam leaves quite a bit of heavy lacing. Strong citrus hop aroma overpowers everything with grapefruit and a hint of grassiness. Flavor is equally powerfull with a full hop bitterness, dry and fresh. Malt flavor is nearly totally overpowered, leaving only the slightest hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick, almost oily and slick. Carbonation is a bit lacking, but not a deal breaker."
"Overall, this is an excellent IPA with envigorating hops taste, but it feels like it could have delivered just a bit more on the malt sweetness on the finish to balance out the equation towards perfection."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with one finger of thick creamy head. There was a thin crown of foam throughout the entire drink with plenty of lace. The aroma is very complex, but primarily pine, citrus. The taste is great! when he beer fist passes over the tongue you taste the heavy malt flavors and the aromatic hops. The bitterness after taste is quite strong. It's great for someone like me with the worst taste buds in the world. It's a fairly heavy beer, lots of body. This is the second time I've has this particular brew, and the first I've drunk while dissecting it for beeradvocate. Lets hope the rest of this months selections are as good overall."
"I know I am going against the masses on this one, but I am really not that impressed. I like a more dynamic hop character in an IPA, I found this one rather powerful, yet lacking in complexities. A good beer, but I have had far superior IPA's."
"Notes: A fine IPA. Doesn't beat Two-Hearted Ale, but gives it a run for it's money."
"Slainte!"
"This one is for the hopheads, not surprising considering the style and the brewery. Glad to have tried it, and would probably pick it up from time to time were it available to me."
"Bitter hoppy taste, it varies some from citrusy and almost lemon-like to down-and-out bitter as my palate adjusts. There is just a hint of skunkiness as well, though given the location and lighting where I bought it I am not sure this beer has ever been light-exposed. While a pleasant example of an IPA, I think there are more interesting things out there, and will try some more things from this brewery before passing judgement."
"Nice mellow bitterness that increases in sharpness as the taste fades. Dry and finishes well. Mouthfeel is smooth but almost pulpy in thickness. Highly drinkable althugh the abv will get you if you're not careful. Not for rookies, buut definitely another quality pproducct from Stone."
"This is my go to beer living in San Diego. It is a really well balanced beer despite the xtreme hoppiness. I will miss having this cost $7 a sixer when i move back to NYC. This is perhaps the best example of a West Coast IPA. I would love to distribute this in Europe and see how they woudl deal."
"Overall a superior IPA. This beer is the standard for AIPAs. I am glad I finally tried it."
"Into a pint glass, pours a deep golden color with a decent beginning head, leaves a film and nice stringy lacing. Aroma seems a little one dimensional, not really a surprise, just wish there was more malt backing. Heavy on floral hops, a littel oily, grapefruit, like it. Taste is... well, quite tasty. Floral, bitter, aggressive, and slick, this is and IPA for IPAs, The key is, it isn't overwhelming, to the point of being offensive, but just on the verge that makes it great. Mouth is smooth, slick, full, warm but not apparently alcoholic. In sum, I still want Stone distributed here. Damnit."
"I don't notice the abv of 6.9% at all I would have guess 5.5%"
"Tastes great. Fruity with a good balance between hopp and malt. Might be a little too bitter for some, but I like it. Can't really taste the alcohol at all, I would have guessed it to be around 4 or 5 AbV. Fully body and goes down easy. Couldn't ask for much more from an IPA in terms of appearance, drinkability, and taste. The unique aroma bumps this one from good to great."
"Drinkability was superior. I'm glad I bought six. Because I had a strong hankering for another each and every day. Very memorable."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure how many of these I would want to drink. It's pretty damn good but it's a bit of a kick to the nuts."
"Overall, one of my favorite IPAs. It's not insanely hoppy so it keeps me interested with the other flavors. Goes down pretty easy and pairs really will with spicy food."
"Excellent IPA. Nice citrus/hop smell, pours amber/gold with nice head and lacing to the end. Has a great bitter hop smack with refreshing citrus notes followed by a malt backbone to balance things out. For an IPA I think this is a little on the mild side for hop bitterness. Very well balanced and exceptional in every aspect. So glad to have found this one!... especially since Three Floyds is on standby in Cincy..."
"D: Very drinkable despite the relatively high ABV. An excellent IPA. It's the benchmark for the style in my opinion. One of my all time favorites."
"This beer pours a golden amber color with a light foamy head that settled into a light lace. It has a sweet smell that tickles the nose with a spicy hops IPA tingle. This beer has a stronger bite then the Ruination IPA that Stone brews. It has a nice hops spice and a good blend of flavors but it doesnt have the same IPA qualities as its sister beer. Where that beer seemed strong and sweet this one is more crisp and biting. It is less forgiving to someone that doesnt know the power of an IPA. Its feel is hard and sharp. It cuts through your mouth with flavor and hits you with the IPA tingle. It finishes crisp and refreshing. In all this is a high quality IPA. It is not a masterpiece but well worth drinking if you like hops."
"This monster remarkably drinkable, especially given its heft, though it shouldn't really take too many to get you happy at ~7%. I had the DFH 60 Minute before this and crowned it the IPA by which all others are to be measured, but now I am not so sure. This is a stellar and unique take on the style. Bold, but not bold for the sake of shock value. Cheers to everyone on the West Coast who can get this without high effort and costs."
"Smells of floral hops with a sweet hint of malt. Taste is a great balance between the two even with a strong hop character. Grapefuit hop flavor dominates over hints of orange rind and light toasted malt. This is far and away my favorite American IPA out there, just finally getting around to reviewing it. It does a great job of satisfying my craving for hops while being incredibly drinkable. At 6.9% it can catch up with you after a bit, but overall this is an amazing beer, and the IPA that I compare all others to."
"Drinkability depends. Six pack can easily be drank by one throughout a session, but it's nice to follow up a few of these with Stones Ruination IPA a true liquid poem."
"D - Top-shelf IPA thanks to the classic Stone bitterness. This was my first Stone experience, and I enjoyed it before I knew how big the beer world really was. A very good introduction to the Stone taste and a wonderful IPA!"
"Thick and heavily hopped. Has a fizzy consistency that bounces off the tongue. Not a light beer, by any stretch. But highly drinkable. Has a very hoppy aftertaste, which means I probably couldn't drink two consecutively, but I could drink several in a night. Good beer."
"This is one of my favorite brews that I keep in the cooler all the time. Pours a light to medium body that had wonderful hazy golden yellow hue w/ a frothy 1 inch head that does not let down. What attracts me to this IPA is the intense hop and malt flavor. Starts off watery and bittersweet and ends w/ a long lasting dry bitter taste. Love the tartness it leave on my lips. The aroma is also great. A great blast of citrus grapefruit, malt and a slight hint of alcohol. Well- balance brew and goes great with a new york strip or prime rib entree, bbq or by itself. Enjoy."
"I really like this beer. Very glad to have it brought to me from the U.S. by my father. This just made me fonder of India Pale Ales."
"Moderately disappointed with this one, considering its reputation. Bought a six pack, and this was my first, so I may re-review later on."
"Pours a hazy orange with sticky off white head, leaving some lace on the glass as it recedes. Citrusy hops in the aroma with some sweetness, it almost smells like an orange. Lots of citrusy hop flavor, malty sweetness and bitterness (especially in the finish). Medium bodied, but it does seem lighter bodied than I would expect. I like this, unlike some other stone beers, the bitterness seems balanced well with the flavors. I wouldn't want more than one of these, but this is a very enjoyable beer."
"Yet another outstanding brew from Stone. The color is great, the smell is hoppy without being overbearing, and this is one of the best IPA's I have had to date. I could drink way too many of these, they go down smoothly and taste wonderful. The brewmaster at Stone never stops amazing me."
"Overall: A very nice IPA with lots of hop flavors and aromas that aren't overpowered by sweet maltiness."
"I am left feeling bitter that Stone beers are still not available in Missouri"
"Overall, probably the best American IPA I've ever had. A very unique brew among its rivals and it has a superb mixture of different hop types. A must have for IPA or hops lovers!"
"Overall, this is an excellent IPA and would certainly satisfy any hop-lover not looking for a roundhouse to the tastebuds from overpowering hop deliciousness."
"Have to thank Sidd for sending me a sixer of this. Poured into a traditional pint glass and first thing I noticed is the great orange hue and nice white head. Reasonable lacing left on the glass. The smell is very citrusy and floral hop aromas. One of the best smelling IPAs I have had to be honest, as the hop aroma was very evident, but not in the burn your nose hair kind of way. I found the beer to be very malty, semi-sweet, and with a solid hoppy punch on the back end. I though the hop profile was pretty much perfect as it had a great deal of flavor, but wasn't so bitter you were puckering up as you drank it. Has a very velvety smooth mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable beer, and one I just found is available neer me. Unfortunately with a $10.50/six pack price tag, it will be a rare treat. If you have a chance to try this, don't pass it up."
"This beer pours a pale orange with a frothy white head that holds for a good amount of time amd laces nicely as well. The smell is all piney and cirtrusy hops with some sweetness. Its almost like smelling right into centennial hops. The taste echoes the smell. The hop flavor dominates the taste. Its almost ke drinking hop tea. The mouthfeel is just the right body with a good amount of carbonation. OVerall highly drinkable, a great IPA. I wish I could always have this."
"D: This is 1 of my hot day beer's, I am not the hugest IPA fan, but every now and again I run across 1 that I really enjoy and this is 1 of em. A really great example of the style."
"As you pour it, the hoppy aroma is what strikes you about this beer. Did not pour with a big head - about thre-fourths of an inch. Excellent taste and mouthfeel - lives upto its promise of being deliciously hoppy. Drinkability is high - perhaps the best among all of Stone's beers."
"Really a tremendous beer. At first it almost seems a little light, but as your mouth becomes acclimated to it you start to notice the subtle nuances. The smell is very floral and a bit sweet. The taste is a tad bitter, but for the most part the floral taste takes center stage. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both through the roof, especially after the first few sips. A definite must try."
"incredibly balanced flavour. not as sweet as the nose suggested, a little bit tart after you take a sip and wait. Amazing that it doesn't need some food to tame it. just a exceptionally drinkable, clean beer. Reminds me of the ""whoop pass ipa"" but toned down with less alcohol and strong flavor."
"This beer pours with a nice fine-bubbled white head over a good coppery colored liquid, very inviting. The aroma is full of hops (floral or grapefruity). The initial taste is also of aggressive hops (in that ""west coast"" sort of style). The hops are balanced with a good amount of sweet malt character. Very nicely done, big & bold but smooth. The beer suffers a little on drinkability because it seems to be too much (too hoppy, too malty) & too strong (perhaps a % pt. too high) to make a good session beer if that's what you're looking for. Still, a very enjoyable pint (or two, they're small) to have during an evening out."
"The aroma is nice - not strong, but only with subtle floral and citrus hints, and a faint sweetness. It tastes goood. A delicious, subtly fruity flavor, with an underlying sweet note that balances the hoppy finish. And in the mouth, it is lusciously smooth and feels thick for an IPA, almost a little creamy. Just great. I could drink up more of this for sure. It ranks right up there with Bell's Two-Hearted as one of the best IPAs I've ever had."
"This is smooth, well balanced IPA. I enjoyed the subtle peach and fruit notes that set this apart from most basic IPAs. If you like resiny, piney hops in your IPA this is one for you. It breaks my heart that you cant buy Stone beer in my home state of SC."
"Let this beer warm. I could have a few at a time."
"Very fruity smell...a lot like honey...very crisp and hoppy as well...I don't usually drink IPA's and prefer much darker styles but have heard great things about the Stone brewery and was not let down by this tasting. A must trust try for all those who enjoy a good IPA"
"It's a great thing when a beer of any style can bring together all its elements so harmoniously, and Stone has done it here."
"Easy enough to drink one, but there's a bit too much carbonation and long-lasting bitterness to drink very many."
"Pours a peach-orange-nectarine with a kind of thin white and frothy head that leaves patchy ""lace"" spots on the glass. I don't get a lot of malty aromas in this, but that's ok. The hops are good enough for me. Big citrus notes with some grass and a little aspirin. Alcohol is apparent, but doesn't beat you over the head. Taste is of slightly toasty malt with gummi worms and fruit loops from the citric hops. The only way I can describe it. Hops bitterness lays way on the back of the tongue like you swallowed a crushed up pill. That last aspirin bit makes me knock off a little from the score, but aside from that, this is delicious. mouthfeel is of moderate body with soft carbonation and it lingers just long enough on your tongue. Not cloying, but it doesn't wash away too soon. If it didn't cost $4 a bomber, I would keep this in the fridge pretty often."
" A deep amber with a substantial head for the style it smells of crisp hops and and slightly caramel. The taste is of course very hoppy but better balanced with rich malt flavor than are most IPAs. The qualilty of the ingredients and skill of the brewer is unmistakable. It's a surprisingly light bodied beer with moderate carbonation and just the slightest of alcohol warmth in the mouth. Despite it's very bold presence it is a beer you will want more than one."
"I chose this IPA for a beer tasting I recently held for some beer neophytes. They absolutely loved it, and have declared that IPAs  specifically Stones  are their new favorite beer style!"
" I wish there was a style points catagory, as the beer seems to be like a Gargoyle swooping through the night, jumping off, falling, and then spreading his wings to soar upward. I may have gotten a less then stellar bottle, and I'll definiatly give this a shot again (if I did or didn't), but I""m sure this tastes much, much better on tap. Nice beer, and makes me look forward to the Arrogent Bastard sitting in my fridge."
"D - Yeah.... sadly, it'd be much more drinkable if it weren't an IPA... that abv does you in. I don't think they offer a 12oz version, but if they did, that'd make it just a little easier to session."
"Though I knew he malts were there, I was hoping for a bit more balance, but I guess that's why this is an IPA."
"Poured from bottle to tulip glass. Nice thick frothy head that reduces to a thin line of froth with lots of lacing. Nicely efferevescent with excellent mouthfeel. Aroma and flavor were a wonderful citrusy hop flavor with a little bit of sweetness in the end. The hop flavor isn't as aggressive as in Ruination but excellent and well balanced. High ABV is the only thing keeping this from being an excellent session beer. Another great offering from Stone."
"D-Recomended to anyone that loves a nce no thrills ipa."
"Smooth, Delicious, and I always want more, but the 6.9% keeps it from being a session beer, usually 2-3 pints and you are done."
"This beer pours a creamy golden orange with a frothy off white head. An outstanding looking beer. The smell is all hops. The citrus hop aroma totally dominates this beer. Grapefruit or orange are the citrus smells that are the most strong. The tatse is really in your face hops. The crisp bitter hop flavor is really amazing. Smooth and refreshing, this beer could be a session beer if not the higher alcohol. The m/f is light with all the flavors blending well. An excellant beer that should not be missed. Cheers."
"D: Insanely drinkable for the amount of crisp hop bite. One of the best IPA's ever IMO, but for the style alone it is an IPA on steroids."
"D- Very good but prefer the Ruination. Not bitter enough for me either."
"D- Hophead or not, try this beer its a masterpiece. Since Hop Knot by Four Peaks (in Tempe,AZ) is on tap only, i will be spending time with this IPA in between visits to AZ. Would love to put this and Hop Knot head to head."
"Clear golden, slightly orange in color. Frothy 2cm off white head. Some sweet malt in the background of the aroma, but its mainly floral and citrus hops, along with some other fruity notes. The taste is very similar to my favorite IPA, Bell's Two Hearted Ale (regionally biased opinion of course.) Just enough pale sweet malty backbone to balance out the outrageously awesome hops. They are mostly floral and perfume-y up front, but with a lot of citrus, orange and grapefruit, as well as some apricot. A few pine-y notes come as the beer goes down. Great silky smooth mouthfeel. Awesome representation of my favorite style? Of course I could drink these all night."
"Great choice, who picked up this beer ?"
"Pours a nice rich gold. One finger plus head, goes into a nice lace. Smell hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Pine,and citrus hops. Very nice. Body is fairly light, with just the right amount of carbionation. Taste is a smooth balance of hops and malt. This i the best IPA I've tried to date. Wow!"
" I felt the lack of sustained head or any measurable lace detracted from my numbers. Not bad overall."
"D-This isn't an IPA that scares me. I like hops but not in the quantities that most IPA's use. This is just right. Very drinkable and would be a session beer if the ABV wasn't so high. Bottle is just as good but has a more acidic quality in the hops and slightly quicker bitterness build-up. Both are good, I just prefer the draft.."
"Clear bright orangey yellow, with a one finger head that holds. Notably vapid carbonation. Teh aroma reminds me of 60 minute a bit, sweet, with floral and piney hops...smells complex, which for hops is a good thing. Taste is grapefruity bit penetratingly bitter. Not killer in it's bite, but the bitterness does linger. It's in amount of bitterness here not type, thing more like a lot of lower alpha bitterness rather than less high alpha bitterness...and its, again, complex with multiple kinds of hops I'd guess. Similar in style to 60 minute bit more straight bitterness and less in aroma. Leaves a tang on the tounge but it's not so cascade-like where it might linger infinitely past the point of enjoyment. Mouthfeel is not overwhelming but a bit high on carbonation, good for most. When I let this one stick around and decarbonate thought, I realizzed that it tasted mostly like hop water. the malt here is not that present. The complexity of the hop profile is what shines, and the alcohol is well hidden. This has good drinkability for an IPA, but one is plenty for me. I prefer 60 minute, but to each their own."
"Honestly, I think this is more bitter than Arrogant Bastard, but hey! It is definitely the best IPA to have ever graced my lips. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber with Stone's trademark ripping on the BMC idiots into a hefe glass and was pure orange with a nice head. In fact, the top half was all cream. Upon first whiff, it is all hops, wondering if you can finish the bottle! But you do because of the citrus and hop character found in about no other beer. The taste is amazing. The hoppiness lingers a good 30 minutes after you drink it (the buzz is another thing!). I was amazed at how well the head held throughout a whole 22 oz. bottle. It never dissipated to a ring, but left a good 2 cm of off white on top at all times, and I was very impressed by that. The mouthfeel is great and bitter, a definite sipper over time. Thats where the drinkability takes a whack, but the taste is by far the highlight of the beer! I am fast becoming a Stone fanatic, and living in San Diego is living the dream! Everyone needs to try this. An awesome, possibly elite? form of an IPA. And if you plan on drinking the bomber, have someone drive home!"
"i can see why this is a staple beer for many people, especially west-coasters.. and i'd love to try it on tap. good drink.. just not any better than local favorites including abijah rowe and hopmeadow. still, recommended session ipa."
"I had a weekend back home and found this at a local beer bar. When I ordered a Scottish started going crazy about how IPA's were his favorite type of beer. As a side note he also did very good impressions of Fat Bastard, and did more and more of them as the night wore on. Back to the task at hand though. I've never had an IPA before but knew it to be very well hopped. This was no exception to the style and was a very good beer by my standards. It poured a nice goldish orange color and I was immediately taken in by the nice smell of citrus and hops. The taste was awesome. It had a very crisp feel to it and the hops definitely came through. This is a style of beer I think I could grow to love very easily if they are all as drinkable as this beer."
"12oz. bottle. Beer was gold and faintly orange, slight haze may have been due to chill. Good size, off white head. Scent was of hops, with orange as the primary, but citrus in general. Malt was very faint. Taste was similar, but more balanced. Hops hit you first and well, but malt is sturdy and had a bit of honey in it. Body seemed medium to light, with medium carbonation. Very slightly drying. Overall and excellent beer, but not as hoppy as I expected given Stone's other offerings. I wonder if the sixer I purchased had some age on it. I have a bomber also on hand, I may just have to try this again."
"I could drink a couple bombers easy or tackle the whole six pack if I was so inclined. This would make a great session beer on it's own or paired with the less hoppy Stone Pale Ale, yet is great as a stand alone beer when you just want to sit back relax and have a beer that's truely special."
"Real nice selection by a member of my beer club that I had no confidence in to make a good choice."
"The best inheritance than learned the Americans of the British, an excellent formula done by one micro of the best ones in the USA, incomparable, special flavor, defined, feel as if they were chewing ""literally"" hops, exquisite for my taste, of the best thing than the gringos do, special for great occasions, recommendable 95%."
"Very drinkable, If I lived in CA, this would be my session beer."
"D: This is a damn good IPA and very easy to drink. It goes down so smooth and taste so good I'm tempted to chug it like Gatorade. This is the essential summer beer. Tasty and very thirst quenching. I couldn't ask for more in a beer."
"This isnt the ""death by hops"" experience many IPA fanatics drool over but it is an excellent IPA to be enjoyed by both fanatics and neophytes to the style."
"Very pleased with my first beer from Stone. Pours to a golden orange, with thick off-white head that lingers and excellent lacing. Hoppy aroma of citrus fruits.... grapefruit, lemons and oranges. Flavor of hops and fruits, and excellent finish, which actuaally included a warming sensation from the alcohol. I was expecting a lot from this IPA, and was not disappointed at all."
"To say i could drink this beer all day it a severe understatement. Great hops character and aroma, beautiful amber color and a great mouthfeel. Make me want to try every Stone beer out there."
"Wow! Unbelievable IPA. Hoppy is all hell. This beer doesn't need much description because it is damn near perfect. The best description of it would be this: Hops hops hops hops hops hops hops hops hops hops hops and more hops. Nice color, thick head sticks to glass. Excellent almost permanent retention. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste hops again. Although for the amount of hops it has, it is still remarkably balanced. Nice medium to full bodied feel. Carbonation on par. Drinkability is great as long as you like hoppy brews. Awesome IPA."
"The drinkability is pretty good but I may have to drink this again and assume that this bottle may have been a little old due to the lack of hop character I remember and the poor level of carbonation."
"Decent mouthfeel, but sometimes it feels a bit too carbonated. Very drinkable, especially on a hot summer night like tonight. I look forward to one day trying Ruination."
"The alcohol is very well-hidden. Overall, it is a smooth, hoppy - but, not ridiculously so - so the balance is wonderful - A great brew and a near-perfect example of the style. Very enjoyable!"
"Pours clear amber with some hints of deep orange. A nice head leaves shapes and patterns clinging to the side of the glass. The nose is straight up delicious with some fruity, herbal, IPA fragrances. The bitter hop taste is the focus of this beverage, though it is balanced a bit by sweet citrus. This taste keeps growing and changing as you drink. Mouthfeel = smooth and wonderful. Just a note: this is not necessarily a quick drinking beer and due to its intense bitter flavor some timing is necessary in regards to accompanying food and the beers to come. Im certainly contemplating breaking out a bit of cheese."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass mug. Gorgeous off-white clumpy head that made me smile with glee. A rich golden amber color, definately screams ""I'm an awesome IPA, drink me NOW!"" The smell was what I imagine a hops field smells like. Very grassy, hoppy, with that little hops citrus kick. The taste was AMAZINGLY delicious. The hops attacks, smooths, cools, chills, whatever. I loved it. it was so deep, citrusy, grassy, and all of the above. SO MUCH HOPS. The mouth feel was heavy, and dark. I loved it. The drinkability is way too high for something this hoppy. Glad I have 5 more, and a liquor store with half a dozen more six packs!"
"Hoppy and sweet taste, bitter aftertaste."
"All in all a really great beer that will probably become one of my standards."
"This beer sets the standard of a great all-around IPA."
"Just a fantastic IPA here. Drinkable beyond belief, refreshing as all get out. Impossible to complain about. Stone, you distribute in Wisconsin RIGHT NOW!"
"Drinkability: This is the epitome of a session IPA - lighter body balances a full-flavored hop bouquet. Every mouthful was a delight, even for a non-hop fan like me."
"Overall, a top-notch IPA. This beer really sets the standard on the style, and brings it's own little bit of uniquness to the mix as well. Another fine offering from Stone Brewing."
"Dark straw color with a medium head. The scent was very zesty/piney. Mouthfeel is smooth. The alcohol was noticeable but not overdone or overpowering. Malt was a little on the light side of what I like, even for an IPA. The hop flavor was strong and refreshing; a little predictable, but it's done right so it is hard to find blame with that."
"D: Mmmmm this is a tasty brew. I think I could drink another and another. The 6.9% abv is not prominent and I think I could bring the beer to my lips for the smell alone. Since it is a refreshing beer it helps the drinkability."
"This might be the smoothest IPA on the face of the earth. This is what it's all about. This is why I love India Pale Ale."
"If you've tried this one nothing needs to be said. If you haven't - go get one right now. This stuff is what it's all about. Perfect appearance, perfect aroma, perfect mouthfeel and drinkable beyond 95% of everything that's out there. I love it, you'll love it, we all love it. Stone is king. Mmmm, delicious... I gotta go..."
"Fantastic, one of my favorite regular IPA's. I absolutely love Stone's use of hops. This beer is unique, which is great in a world with so many similar IPA's. Highly recommended to anyone who likes hoppy beers."
"When it is poured in the glass it is a lite amber color with hint a hint of yellow at the bottom. A nice head forms, an inch high, and dissappates slowly down the glass. A nice aroma of hops hit the nose with earthy, piney, floral aromas. The taste surprisingly starts with jolt of malt, then the hops begin to take over, with that bitterness one expects for an IPA. In the mouth it feels a bit thin, but it coats the palate evenly, and has nice dry finish. This is very drinkable beer, a hop heads stand by beer. I am just glad I have another one to enjoy, this is an excellent beer."
"D - I find this a very drinkable IPA. It's gotta be one of the better ones out there."
"Heaven in a bottle. And it tastes better (that I can detect) from a bomber. And it's better than that on tap."
"Good, well balanced all around. This is the best of the Stone beers available in NJ. Of those I have tried, this is the only one that doesn't overdo the hoppy bitterness. While it does have a bit of a rough finish, it's not out of line with what an IPA should laste like. Light citris but a little short of how I like it, especially in the aroma. Good solid IPA."
"Overall: A quality ""big"" IPA that is well balanced and provides a good bitter bite for a hop head. The malts are matched well against the citrus and overpowering hops and makes this brew easy to drink. The IBUs are above 70, but dont let that scare you-it is well balanced and finishes clean. Not for the novice palate."
"A very tasty but highly hopped IPA. Hoppy bitterness makes it hard to drink much of anything after this. Kind of kills the pallate but in a nice way."
"If you like IPAs this one is one to not miss."
"Drinkability: Very high."
"D - high for thoe IBU-philes amongst us"
"Notes: By far one of the best if not the best regular IPA in the land. It took 2 weeks to get the keg from CA to PA, but well worth the wait."
"Not too oily and not too full. Appropriate carbonation and body. Medium-Full, closer to medium. Such a tastey brew that I could drink day in and day out. The last time I had this was when I first turned 21 and now I can really appreciate all of the flavors and aromas that this one brings with it. Truely a world class IPA in a world that is dominated by over-the-topness."
"D - an interesting brew, but way too sweet for an IPA, in my opinion. Alcohol content is also prohibitive of having more than a couple in a session. This appears to basically be a smaller version of Arrogant Bastard. I know alot of people rave about this beer, but I think it's pretty unbalanced and not one of the better examples of an IPA. I'll pass."
"I am not the biggest IPA fan, but this was pretty good. As noted, I didn't find it overly hoppy, so if that is what you are looking for, you may want to try something else."
"I like this one, though (apparently) not as much as some. The aroma is top-notch; just think it needs a bit more caramel sweetness to smooth it out."
" Eric"
"d - this is what i would call an ourdoor IPA. very good for a hot summer day when you're attempting to get away from the heat and just want to do some grilling."
"Clean and refreshing with ample body and a creamish mouthfeel. Fair ABV and a great hoppy taste, drink this one up hopheads! Enjoy!"
"Drinkability is its strength. I feel fortunate that I can buy this beer whenever I feel like it at the grocery store here in Vegasthat iswhen it isn't sold out."
"the beer poured a very light amber color and had a vairly wear head... about a half an inch or so. The head didn't last very long unfortunatly... but ohh well. anyway the beer smelt nice, hoppy hints of fruit. and it tasted about the same. the first bottle I tried of this I wasnt too impress4ed, but mainly cause I expected THE BEST from stone. second bottle though. very good. nice amount of bitterness and easy to drink. tasted great. I would no doubt reccomend this beer, if you can find it grab it. easy to drink, tastes great."
"The first taste is sweet up front. Nice and malty and spicy. Although very hoppy, I think the malt balances the hoppiness very well. There's a little citrus as well. This is a stronger beer, but not heavy in the least. As hoppy as it is, you'd think there would be more aftertaste, but there is not. Overall an outstanding IPA."
"Light orange in colour with medium carbonation. Strong aromatic notes of orange, grapefruit, and tangerine, mix with a bit of pine and some light caramel. Theres a definitely a green hop flavor that mixes well with the slightly bready malts. Solid bitterness, but the overall impression of the mouthfeel is rather soft and balanced. For all of their chest thumping and posturing about over the top hops, this is a VERY well balanced IPA."
"An IPA that's great ice cold or warmed up to let the bold flavors shine. Absolutely a classic, and would compete with Alpha King for IPA fridge-space if I could purchase this one locally. My only regret is that I don't have a case or two of this left for this summer."
"D: A solid, well crafted beer...not that I need to tell any one of you."
"Bought a case awhile ago and I finally have gotten around to reviewing it. I have drank at least one of these each day since I bought the case and I have to say that they all have bottled pretty well. The beer pours a rich amber color with a small head. Aroma is hoppy and quite citrusy. The taste begins with citrus fruits, with orange peel and grapefruit being the most prevalent. The aftertaste is clean with a nice hop bitterness, but not too bitter to be a bother. The mouthfeel is smooth with med carbonation. The drinkabiliy is high, I have had two or three at a time without losing the subtleness or balance of the beer. Perhaps the best offering from Stone to date. I would recommend this to anyone."
"Pours a slightly cloudy gold with an inch of white head. Lacing flows down the glass. Smells like a hop lovers dream. Citrus and pine with some bready malt in the distance. The taste is as good as the smell. Hop oils coat the mouth and the fruit and pine come shining through. Bitter, dry finish. Delicious. I could keep drinking this all day...if I only had more."
"This one also gives great hop belches."
"I was more of a malt guy before I tried this and the Sothern Tier Unearthly. Now I'm psyched for summer and big bodied, hoppy IPAs. If you want to taste what dry hopping contributes to a beer, try this. This beer shows why craft/micro brewers are engineers: it takes such knowledge of hops to pick the right combination for a taste so seamless."
"Very drinkable despite the higher 6.9% ABV."
"Drinkability: Stone IPA is highly drinkable. An outstanding IPA that is worth seeking out. Nice and hoppy but it doesn't hit you over the head with them. Alcohol is well hidden in the flavor profile, and I could definitely throw a bunch of these back, but the 6.9 % abv will suddenly make itself know. A fantastic beer that is always welcome in my DBF. Stone IPA is another reason why Stone is considered one of the best craft brewers in America."
"D: I'm a little underwhelmed with this, maybe I was just over-hyping it. Definetly would go for another IPA first, but this is still pretty good."
"A delicious brew, I plan to quaff many of these this summer."
"Musings: Obviously a highly drinkable IPA. The tastes are so well contrived that the result is close to being pedestrian. No over the top flavors here. What there is a high alcohol quencher that will easily get you in trouble."
"I hate to keep rating Stone brews so high, but DAMN they are consistently good...VERY good."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these, but it's no session beer."
"I wasnt expecting to like this beer going into it but I was swayed by another great beer from a great brewery. This beer is incredibly hoppy. If you dont dig on the hops, stay away. If you do, check it out. It is fantastic. Damn those cool bottles. I would probably buy cat pee if it was bottled by Stone in one of those awesome bottles! Hmmm..."
"Thanks to mattcrill for this gem. Wish I could get Stone in Michigan. I would definitely like to put a sixer of this in my fridge, alongside Two Hearted (it's that good). Bravo to Stone!"
"Pablo Piccaso would have trouble crafting a masterpiece such as this. The stiff white cream head finishes off this brew as you'd imagine a master chef with a perfect garnish would. Nose is massive pine, followed by a mix of grapefruit and caramel. I have to be honest, the smell is as devine as any beer lover could hope. Taste is a tour of hops ...pine, graprefruit, lemon, peach and finally caramel. This is probably the perfect IPA. Mouthfeel is suitably creamy and drinkablility is near perfect. A rugged yet sessionable beer that everyone with any sense will respect. Thank you Stone!"
"I've since tried several other IPA's with this in mind, and I've found that several of them do integrate other flavors, including caramel in one case and pear in another. I also drank about half a dozen 22 oz. bottles of Stone IPA in the intervening time. I now realize that the pure piney hop flavor of Stone IPA is superior to these attempts to enhance the complexity. I'm still keeping an open mind, but Stone continues to be the reigning champion of IPAs for me, and is probably the most drinkable beer for its strength of any that I've tried."
"Pours a clear golden color with a thick head of large white bubbles. Huge pine, yet sweet aroma. A touch of lemon citrus. Taste is more pine balanced with a sweet undertone of malt. Bitterness lingers long into the aftertaste. Sticky, resinous hops coat the mouth, but it is not astringent. This is what an IPA should be. Great craftsmanship in the design of this recipe. Infinitely drinkable."
"I could easily give this beer fives across the board, and might update it later. Until then, I'm still searching for the perfect IPA, but I think I may have already found it. Great beer."
"overall, one of my favorite IPA's very very nice, if i had access to this in Michigan i would buy it regularly."
"Deep orange in color with an nice white head that eventually just leaves a film. Medium carbonation. As expected, good aroma of pine, citrus, and resin. Quite a bit less than the Ruination. Overall, this is a good IPA, but not as good an IPA as Ruination is a DIPA."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a big rocky white head that leave fantastic lacing on the glass. Aroma is powerful citrus hops. Taste - wow this is some intense citrusy hop flavor! There is some great sweet malt backbone here too but I wouldn't exactly call it balanced but it's an IPA after all and it doesn't have to be balanced to be delicious - which it is. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy and creamy, nicely carbonated. This is a great beer and is quite drinkable despite it hugeness."
"Pours light amber with a big white head that fades to a light cover. Nice lacing. Aroma is pine and grapefruit, with some malt underneath. The flavor is good on the citrus and pine with a nice caramel malt backbone. Good balance and very easy drinking. Not quite up to the level of the top IPAs however."
"Overall- Another good IPA that I didn't fully appreciate in the past. I've since come around and can't get enough of these full bodied IPA's."
"I think I'm going to need some cashews and stilton cheese with this one next time."
"Overall a highly recommended IPA that is the standard for the style."
"Pours golden with an orange tint and excellent clarity. A white, one finger head of semi-dense foam shows good retention and leaves sticky lacing. Big american hop aroma of chinook and cascade like grapefruit/citrus with a mild grassy tone; background toasted pale malt. First sip is sweet toasted pale malt, followed by a rush of herbal hop bitterness. Slightly fruity, but not estery at all which I like. The aftertaste is dry and bitter with a fresh cut whole hop flavor. The pale malt is simple but strong enough for a great balance against the complex hop character. The flavor is dry, bitter, sweet and fruity all at once. Mild carbonation and medium bodied for a smooth mouthfeel that breaks up the bitterness without being overly carbonated. The finish is dry with a hop resin taste and alpha acid bite, but it fades quick enough and retains a high drinkability. A wonderfully satisfying American IPA."
"An all around winner of a west coast American IPA. As Bob Dylan would say: ""Everybody must get Stone."""
"22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass, this beer is a cloudy golden color with two fingers of off-white head which sticks around for a few minutes. Very nice rings of lace left behind on the glass. Nose is full of flowery and perfumy hops, slight amount of citrus, and a hint of doughy biscuits. Taste starts out with a rather sweet malt and then hits you with loads of flowery hops giving way to a gently bitter finish. Very nice delicate hops meld well with the strong pale malt for a very drinkable balanced IPA. Hop bitterness seems a little too subdued at first, but builds as you make your way through the glass. Medium bodied, medium/low carbonation, and an absolutely silky smooth feel. This is a nice enough IPA, solid and balanced, but really is something you'd rather have in 12 oz bottles than in a bomber."
""
"P.S. Had to go and buy a bottle of this beer for further investigation. I'm glad I did I'm drinking it now at a slightly warmer temperature and with the pour it creates a beautiful white dense head that leaves great lacing. With it warmer the taste of pepper really stands out to me right now. The hops have a grassier/ pinecone like smell to them. Gives my mouth a nice little burn. Wow this is a good IPA."
"This is a very VERY drinkable beer, with appealing aromas and flavors. The flavors are very well balanced. I wouldnt mind having several of these in a session. I would certainly drink Stone IPA again, and I wish I had bought more than one six pack."
"This is a great IPA. Instead of the immensely bitter and piney flavors of other IPAs, it has a subtle, flowery hop profile. This is unique to me, and impossibly drinkable."
"This is absolutely the best IPA I've ever had!! Lot's of grapefruit flavor and multi-hops. Very well balanced as well, as it is very malty up front, followed by a tremendous bitter hop freshness. Awesomely smooth and drinkability is outstanding. Very highly recommended."
"HAIL STONE! This is great stuff, and one of the best IPAs on the market."
"Another quality brew from Stone.... they really know what thier doing with thier hops over in California."
"A damn fine IPA. This is a very bittersweet IPA. The color is a semi cloudy amber. Not too much head. Has a very fresh, outdoorsy smell. The taste is deffinatly hoppy. There is a lingering bitterness that sticks to your tongue. A very drinkable brew. Too bad Stone isn't available here in NC. Thanks Wcudwight!!"
"Pours with a curdled-white head, dense, over a full inch in height, and a hazy straw-gold body. The nose opens with a slightly vinous pinch that immediately deepens into fully blown hops (straight-up grapefruit rinds and cut grass) held down by a thin but sturdy ballast of cracker-like yeasts and caramel-dense malts. Taste: Razor sharp zip of hop bitterness -- as if anything less was expected -- blasts off from the tip of my palate and arches back, with finesse, all the way to my molars. The middle reveals more complexity as the malts nudge through, caramel in character, same as in the nose. Thins out for the finish, leaving only a high-pitched echo of hops spinning around the center of the roof of my mouth like one of those obnoxious rotating fire-crackers that throws sparks everywhere and terrifies the elderly relaxed and immobile in lawn chairs on the fourth of July. The mouthfeel is perfect: not viscous, not watery, it holds everything up but washes down without over-staying its welcome."
"This is the 4th beer that I’ve had from Stone Brewing Co. and each beer that I try expands the respect that I have for them. This beer is an excellent representation of the style and while maintaining the Stone signature."
"by the way- like this? try Great Divide's Hercules Double IPA."
"this is a great beer!"
"Had this on draft at the Union Brewhouse in Weymouth the last two times I've been there. First off this is not what I would expect of the Stone beers I've had in the past previous Stone beverages have been ""extreme"" in flavor whether its the ruination,smoked porter or arrogant bastard.This appears to be a great session beer but hits you like a 10lb hammer when you aren't looking. My second game of Golden Tee was pint two and my handicao dropped about twenty strokes. On tap this pours a clear orange with a minimal head. I only had three of these on tap and I am happy that someone else was driving."
"Drinkability: As I am *not* a hop-head, I do not find beers this aggressive to be sessionable for me personally. That said, this bomber went down very easily and I will definitely drink 22ozs of this again. Even though I really enjoyed one I wouldn't drink it all night."
"I used to like crappy beers, or actually maybe I didn't even like them really... I just drank them. Until a friend got me trying some REAL beers and turned me onto Stone Brew. I've had their AB which is a treat, but recently decided to put Stone IPA on tap at my house because it's drinkability is better. This is a truely great beer. My most favorite part is the smell. After my first few glasses I can anticipate sniffing the hops and then getting a good taste of them afterward. If you want (with a tap anyway) you can make a nice head on the beer making quite attractive with a rich yellow/orange color. Has a nice smooth mouth feel as it slides down with a delicious hoppy flavor. Malt and alcohol are present but the hops mutes them. Definately has a bitter ending, which I've grown to like. It fades after half a glass, but can be quite aweful if you had anything sweet as it has a hint of grapefruit at the end. This is probably one of the first beers I take nice long draws from because it actually is that enjoyable. As a word of advice, I see this beer being hated by the average macrobrew beer drinker."
"D: Pretty good IPA, loved the smell on this one. I prefer an IPA that is slightly less bitter than this one however"
"What is everyone else seeing here?? I'll have to give this another try at some point."
"Drinkability: Very high marks for this one. No hesitation in reaching for several of these. Alcohol presence is well-hidden, mouthfeel is light, and the flavors aren't overpowering. This will be great on a hot summer night."
"D - A nice drinking, easy to quaff IPA."
"A total pleasure to drink and a unique pale ale, that doesn't break the mold per se but sure does stretch one's personal definition of what the tastes of a pale ale are."
"Solid Effort."
"Drinkability is good, but I had to quit when I did because LSU was out of basketball to play after beating Texas A&M. Don't know how many of these I could take because as I kept drinking I noticed I wanted to be drinking water more than beer."
"This is a great IPA. I really enjoy the fruitiness. I enjoy the complete hop monster IPA's but this is more complex and interesting."
"This is a solid brew that got much better as it warmed up and as I went further and further down my glass. I say that about most beers I enjoy, but this one had that quality about it magnified by quite a bit. The ABV is felt here, and the carbonation is a bit lacking, but overall, this was fun to try out and I wish that Stone's other beers were available locally. I would welcome the chance to acclimate myself to their other offerings..."
"Drinkability is very good on this IPA, it would be a regular in my fridge if were available in my area."
"Poured into a glass from a bomber. dark gold at the top fading to a golden color toward the bottom. Aggressive pour yielded about 2"" of sustained head. Lots of lacing as I drank it down. Smell is not as hoppy as the bottle claims. Flavor is, in my opinion, the perfect IPA. Hoppy flavor without an extreme bitter aftertaste. Leaves you wanting the next sip right away...nice and dry. Mouthfeel is hoppy oil and very smoot. Could drink 3 or 4 of these, but then i'd be....well I'd better get started. Another great job by Stone!"
"This is a great IPA. The aroma is in full and assertive; primarily citrus and floral. This is what I expect from an American IPA. The flavor is good and bitter with a little sweetness but definitely tilted to the hops. The mouthfeel is round and full with a medium body. This beer finishes clean but bitter and leaves me wanting more. Any hop head will happy with this one!!"
"I enjoy this offering from Stone. This was the first brew from Stone I ever had and I was sold after it on their brews. This IPA seems a bit over the top hoppy at first but after taking a couple slow sips the complex taste is exciting. I will never hesitate to purchase this IPA again, one of my current favorite IPA's."
"D: This competes with Hop Devil for my new favorite IPA. I thought it would have more potency than it does, but I'm actually glad that it doesn't. This makes it highly quaffable."
"A solid IPA. Hits on the IPA style's high points, but with a refreshing mode of operation. Certainly could have another."
"Not bad. I guess my standards are a bit high on this style as I can get Masala Mama on tap pretty much whenever I want, but this is a solid brew from Stone. Well-balanced but still awesomely hoppy."
"I love Stone's stuff more and more everytime I drink it. Pours a reddish amber in color with a thick creamy head. Smells of strong hops and citrus with a hint of pine. Taste is bitter and has a fairly strong alcohol flavor. Very crisp and refreshing though. Mouthfeel is very carbonated but more balanced than most IPAs. Very drinkable if like a good IPA as well as being moderately affordable."
"Notes: One of the best IPA's I've ever had. Milder than the big freakshows"
"Notes: I have come to love IPAs and I must say that this is definately one of the better ones I've had. I like an IPA that has more sweetness to balance the hop bitterness, which is why I love Dogfish Head's 90 minute, but this one does a great job for the style. The appearance of both of the Stone beers I have had were superb, and their flavor is excellent. Definately one of the best breweries in America."
"im no hophead, but i will definitely pick up this one again on occasion should i feel the need for a hoppy beer."
"12 oz. brown bottle pored into my favorite stone 9th anniversery pint glass. it pores a clear but slightly hazzy golden color with great head retention threw out the time. smell is just pure hops, nothing else. the taste is as of no surprise - great hops. a great balance between the hops and malts. no bitterness at all. just pure hop sweetness to my tounge. everything about this beer i love. it is allways a regular in my fridge. this beer will be near my side in my coffin."
" My favorite stone beer i've had. wait, i forgot about the Russian imperial stout. anyways, the only ipa that is perhaps better than this, is Racer 5 or mabey the russian river ipa( a draft verus bottle comparison isn't fair). or green flash, or anderson valley. uh yeah all those are good... stone, once tasted never forgotten."
"This in my view one of the best IPAs out there. The hops in the aftertaste taste great on the first one, but I think sometimes it can add up to be a bit too much after a couple/few, which is the only (and very minor) downside in the drinkability of this spectacular brew to me."
"A light tan head almost 1.5"" tall. Good sticky lace and retention on a bright copper body. Gentle carbonation. Citrus west coast hops with a hint of pine followed by a solid carmel malt aroma. Has a medium body with enough carbonation to move things along. The hops of course are up front and last to the finish. Overall I'm a bit surprised at the balance of this beer. Not overly aggressive but no wimp by any means. It is a Stone afterall."
"Mouthfeel is thin, a little watery. It helps drinkability, but is a little unsatisfying. I doubt I'll bother getting another one."
"Yum yum. This IPA could be other companies' DIPAs. It's such a wonderful definition orf the style, it deserves to be recognized as one of the best."
"This beer is a nice bright bronze-orange. It is almost clear. The head is big and bubbly. The smell and taste are both great. There is a floral and citrus hops aroma, a sweet bread malt smell. The taste includes these flavors as well. The mouthfeel is perfect, not watery, not thick or oily. There is plenty of carbonation. It is incredibly easy to drink."
"Extremely quaffable, drinks about 2abv lower than listed. Will get some bottles soon to compare, don't remember it being as tasty. I usually like draft better most of the time"
"Drinkability/notes  A serious IPA but still drinkable. Will satisfy a hop craving or the need for a nice sipping beer on a warm day. (no freshness markings)"
"I know ""session"" beers usually refer beers under 5% ABV. I could session this beer all day and all night."
"Drinkability: This beer is just an excellent IPA all around. The taste is very well balanced. I am looking forward to more."
"d - Stands up nicely to food and good by itself. Since I found this beer I have been drinking it regularily. It is currently my favorite regular beer."
"Poured a clear, amber toned copper color from a 22oz bomber. White half finger head diminished quickly to white light lacing. Aroma is fresh, floral and citrus hops, a hint of piny hops along with some stronger grapefruity smells present as well. Taste is a very balanced hop and malt infusion, yet allows a nice bitter hop bite at the end, tastes sweeter just before it bitters. This is an absolutely outstanding IPA, I love this brew. Mouthfeel is superb, carbonation is just where it should be, this brew slips off the tongue and leaves you wanting more. Highly drinkable, I could drink these all night long, given the chance. Would most definitely seek out again in the near future."
"One of the best IPAs I have had, surely a top 5."
"Bottle: Poured a orangey color ale with a medium head with standard retention. The hops and their nice floral aspect overpower aroma. Taste is quite bitter with some lingering sweetness in the back of the palate. Good body and alcohol level does a good job of keeping this beer together. Not my favourite style to begin with but this was very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Note: freshness really matters with this brew. When an older bottle is not going to be terrible it is really not the same beer as a fresh one. If you get it at a bar or store with low turnover/infrequent restocking you might not be getting the best Stone IPA available."
"Another great IPA. This one pours a clear, light amber color with minimum carbonation and a 1 inch off-white head that melts down to a long lasting quarter inch. Lacing is very pronounced, like a ladder pattern on the glass. The smell was strong, some hops, but also the type of fruity smell that I usually associate with hefe weizens. No hefe weizen/astringent taste though. Definitely a hops leaning taste, but not an ""in your face"" hops flavor like Hop Hog or Big Foot. The predominant tastes were hops and citrus, not much of the SNPA type pine aroma/taste. Mouthfeel is what I would expect in an IPA. Drinkability is high!! No hint of the ABF, a nice balanced (I call ""leaning towards hops"" balanced!) taste. This is something you could cheerfully swill until it catches up with you."
"One of the best IPA's I've had. Hops are in the spotlight, front and center, but the malt backbone is quite substantial. Highly recommended."
"Suprisingly this poured with little to no foam head, although it appeared there was adequate carbonation going on in the glass. The color was golden, leaning toward copper, with just a faint haziness. The smell was rich. Sugary malt aromas blended with dank resiny hops. Mmmmm. The taste was not as sweet as I expected though, the flavor is mostly domintated by the hoppiness, leaving behind a strong bitterness. The alcohol is readily detectible at times also Mouthfeels is OK, somewhat thin and with decent carbonation. A very drinkable beer for hop lovers, but I was expecting more balance for a Top 100 selection..."
"Pours a clear golden orange, thick white head forms, laces nicely, with good retention. Smell is citrus, pine and floral hops, a little caramel and a little alcohol. Taste is caramel, some wheaty dryness, grains, then a whack of citrus and pine hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to low carbonation. Has a considerable bitter kick in the finish, I was expecting a bit more from this one for its high rating. Thanks DrJay!"
"My local bar rotated Stone IPA into their taps, so I've been happily drinking this in place of Racer Five for a few months. The bottled version lacks some of the initial bitterness of the draft version, possibly due to the freshness of this sample. While Stone gets more attention, and rightfully so, for bigger offerings like Arrogant Bastard, this more balanced but expertly crafted IPA sometimes gets overlooked. A strong offering worthy of the gargoyle."
"Overall = A top notch IPA for hop lovers. It's all about the hops and if that's what you're seeking, you will be greatly rewarded."
"Tried this out as part of the best flight of beers I've ever experienced at the Flying Saucer in Addison, Texas. Overall, one of the best IPAs that I've tasted. Too hoppy for the rest of my table that night, but just right for the style. Stone continues to do a great job with their brews and this is a perfect example."
"Mouthfeel is light but substantial. Drinkability is only limited by your tolerance to hops. An excellent example of a lighter brand of American IPA, the only drawback being it's almost a one-trick pony with the hops. I could session this, but only for a while."
"All in all a fabulous beer.... and very fairly priced.... Stone continues to amaze me."
"D: It's quite drinkable, especially considering the strength."
"This beer would make a great session beer. It has a great non aggressive flavor, and it is only a little high in alcohol. This beer is very good and definately worth any price to get it."
"Drinkability: Wonderful brew, a world calss IPA, one of the best I have had in a while. Thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the bottle, par of BIF 24."
"Drinkability... gotta give it great marks. I liked it a LOT."
"D - This is a perfectly balanced beer, quite unlike (of course) AB, DBA or Ruination."
"Opinion: Well, if I said that this beer was my favorite, and likened it to the holy grail...I would be lying. It is a clean and well made beer, but I like to have at least a little contribution from the hops. Even DFH 90min IPA has a bold malt presence...where this one is just really hoppy. This isn't a bad beer, but I'll be sticking to the Bastard and some of Stones other products for the most part."
"I can't readily get this one in MD. However, it is the one beer I genuinely seek out when I travel."
"This pours a bright gold-copper hue with a large foamy head that only dissipates slightly. The aroma that is giving off is a floral citrus, spicy combination that is truly delightful. The taste is hop bite upfront and moves into a smooth buttery sweet malt finish. the mouthfeel is touch down from perfect due to the bitterness left on your tongue; after three of these you will not taste a thing! That lends to the drinkability not being perfect for the same reason. This IPA ranks right up there with the best of them; I would say that if I could actually purchase it on a regular basis (I'm in FL) it might be my favorite brew."
"This is much easier to drink then say Ruination. This is a great beer."
"Very strong hoppy smell, with a slight citrusy, fruity aroma. Lots of piney, hoppy bitterness on the tongue. Not as strong the more you drink. Smooth mouthfeel, with a slight oily texture that finishes clean. If you're a hophead I think you could drink this all night!! Very flavorful, yet bitter IPA. I'll have to make some trips to Toledo to pick up more of this great brew."
"This beer pours a golden honey color and leaves a very thick white lace that clings to the side of the glass. The floural hoppiness is ever so present along with the citrus, grapefruit, honey, grassy notes and cloves. This beer starts with a grapefruit hoppy bitterness on the palate then slowly takes you to a smooth sweet honey clove flavored finished with a mild citrus squirt. This beer is well rounded and amazing, by far one of the standards for American IPA."
"Very drinkable. My first of these was pretty intense (a year ago), but they're really not so bitter (not even the ruination is). Excellent with barbeque and the like."
"Medium carbonation. Smooth drinking. Overall very good IPA."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. One of the better IPA's I've had--would defintately have a bunch of these if I were at a bar."
"Overall a superior IPA - Definitely smooth enough to be a session regular. My second favorite after Southern Tier IPA. Now onto the Ruination...."
"Pours a beautiful 14k gold color with a big frothy head, aroma is hopalicious with some pineyness undertones, oh so good. Taste, this is what all other IPA's aspire to be. In my humble opinion this is one of the best IPA's on the market today"
"It had an incredible, yes incredible sweet hoppy taste which I could see being a little too much for the non-IPA lovers. The main thing I took away from this was the balance which was exquisite. It was sweet yet somewhat biting and bitter at the end. The alcohol wasn't even noticed. It was refreshing and crisp. I really can't think of a better IPA for your money."
"Overall: bitter bitter juicy IPA"
"Pours a dull orange copper with a big white head that falls quickly. Smells of mandarin oranges and pine with a slight grainy barley. Not as hoppy as anticipated. The hops present taste like juniper and orange zest. The malt taste like sweet caramel cornbread with an oat meal finish. Mouth feel is thin with a slightly creamy carbonation."
"This is a wonderful beer. An up front struggle morphs into a reasssuring base that leaves me begging for more. Hops return in the aftertaste to dry the throat. The finish is just divine. Md body and moderately carbonated. If I had another I'd drink it right now. Sad to see my my glass holding just one more gulp."
"A well hopped IPA that is sure to please big time!"
"D- This is a nice hop beer with a good base of pale malt grain. This bottle seems a bit over carbonated but it doesn't get in the way of the flavor."
"Pours a white, two finger-head that vanishes slowly leaving a good lace. Clear light amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is a strong hop. Starts with hops, somewhere there are malts - there is a trace of sweetness but the hops dominate, bitter finish that lingers. $2.30 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Drinkable, but ultimately too hoppy and bitter for my taste- I've had better."
"22 oz. bomber. Golden-honey with a frothy head that dissipates rather quickly but forms a nice cap and leaves sticky lacing (somewhat sparse, but there nonetheless) all the way down the glass. Nose is all floral and fruity hoppiness, very inviting! The taste follows the nose with a powerful bitterness at both the front and the back -- a great achievement in itself. There is a honeyed maltiness and the taste of peaches and flowery esters. The mouthfeel is full and juicy, very satisfying. Great drinkability...too bad this stuff is so expensive as a sixer. A bomber is enough for me, though. And at 6.9%, there's really no reason for more than one 22 oz bottle anyway. Superb representation of the style."
"Edit: As it warms, the taste and drinkability improves. I raised both by .5. I estimate the temperature at the end to be about 68-70 F."
"Pours a vibrant golden color with an inch or so of lovely, creamy white head that leaves maybe a little sooner than it should. Decent lacing on the glass. Aroma of spicy, floral hops mixed with a bit of sweet malt. Notes of pine and black pepper. Palate is outstanding - bold, assertive hops grab hold of the tongue and don't let go. The lightly sweet malt acts as a great foil. Body is rich and creamy, nice and substantial with only a subtle trace of the syrupy character that shows up in big IPAs. I could drink this all night, all week, all year."
"Cheers!"
" -Cheers2Beers"
"The drinkability of this beer is quite good. A sessionable IPA, though the alcohol content is rather high."
"Fills me with goodness."
"Pours a pale orange color with big foamy white head. Aromas are of grass, dried fruit, and hops. The tasts is of citrus bitterness and hoppy texture followed by a strong dry finish. Biting on the tongue, but very enjoyable for anyone liking bitter beers. Good drinkability. Overall, this is a good beer, but not my favorite IPA. I think this beers scores highly because of the reputation of the brewer."
"Start is smooth and slightly tangy without very much flavor. But there is an inviting texture right from the start. Stone IPA settles medium-bodied and from there the bottle basically says it all. Flavors are (or could nearly be) taffey, white grape, wheat, and perhaps more subtle others. In two words this beer is all about ""hop bitters"" just like any quality IPA should be. Finish is melty smooth and clean with an oily and sour aftertaste."
"This beer had a clear gold color with an orange tint and a creamy white head. I loved this smell, piney and floral, a bit of fruit. The first sip gives a hint of malt then a slow build with the hops, citrus then bitter with clean finish. Not too bitter just right. Medium body with lots of carbonation contributes to the clean finish. This beer is easily in my top ten."
"Just to be fair, I love, love, love Arrogant Bastard, find it to be one of the finest substances ever to touch my lips. That beer's just about as hoppy as this one, but it has such an invigorating mouthfeel and up-front splash of fruit that the hops seem balanced in comparison -- the extremes on both end mesh perfectly and create a brew that actually seems to strive to push the boundaries of what a perfectly-crafted beer can be. I'm not a hophead, so their IPA just seems to be, as another review put it, ""liquid hop juice"". Lovers of hop-bombs will love this one; I just happen to not be one of them."
"Overall this beer is fantastic. I could drink this stuff all day. I will definitely be checking out some more IPA's in the future."
"This is good stuff, I definitely don't mean to knock it--but it is kind of one-dimensional. If you need a hop fix (and sometimes I do), this is a good place to go, and it's definitely quality, but I don't think it's really a go-to beer for me."
"My love affair with Stone beer continues, too bad they are located all the way across the country. Luckily most of their line is available here in MA."
"We are talking about a beer here. So I don't feel dirty closing this with ""down she goes."""
"M&D I like a hoppy beer, but this one is a bit ridiculous. High marks for what it offers, but I prefer, more defined characteristics in my IPA's."
"This has to be the tastiest IPA I've ever had, and the most balanced. Floral hops hit you as soon as you pop the top off the bottle. The taste is resiny, and floral with a solid malt backing. This beer is too easy to drink at nearly 7% abv. I could see myself drinking 3 or 4 of these at one sitting. Definitely recommended."
"A little pricey, but worth every penny. A sure fire bet to be the tipping point for any drinker starting to indulge in micros. I'll still drink Titan IPA more often because I need to support the Colorado brewers. This is a hophead must."
"I've never tasted hops quite this good. Obvious, blatant and by no means overdone. These are quality hops that taste slightly bitter but more smooth and full of character. There is just enough sweetness to offset the hops and this makes the IPA one of the best I've ever had. I want another. Unreal."
"In my book, this de-thrones Bridgeport IPA as one of my all-time favorites. It's a close match, but I have to give the edge to this beer. Stone comes as close as possible to the edge of being too hoppy without crossing that line. If a good IPA should be considered ""balanced", then this is perfection. From the floral aroma to the citrusy hop bite and bitter finish, this is the best IPA, and the freshest I might add, I've experienced. Fantastic."
"It's about time I review this IPA, and it's a good thing too since there are only 478 reviews to date. The color is clear copper with a two-finger white head. Aromas are floral and sweet with notes of pines and grapefruit. The taste is hoppy, although this stuff tastes pretty subtle compared to Stone's monstrous line-up, with citrus and sweet malts. Not a huge beer, but a superb everyday treat."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a nice head, some carbonation, but not much lacing at all. Very hoppy with some sweet, citrusy scents. The taste is sweet and hoppy with a little bite at the end. Light to medium body. This ale is very drinkable. Glad to have found it."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a foamy white head. The head sticks around lacing the glass. The smell is sweet and strong with well.... hops and citrus. The taste is of.... hops and finishes with a grapefruit citrus. The mouthfeel is smooth and lightly carbonated. Drinkable.... yes."
"Not bad."
"Stone really can't do wrong. I have a special bone in my body for IPA, and this tickles that itch. It's just a good beer, flat out. I wish I could drink this more often, but I don't see it as often as I'd like in the stores. Keep em' coming stone, I know we'll be waiting."
"Without doubt one of my favorite beers ever. Just hoppy enough to give it some bite, balanced by sufficient malt to give it the sweetness it needs to balance the bitterness of the hops. Smooth, creamy, hoppy, piney, citrusy, resinous, all perfectly balanced. Stone doesn't seem to make a bad beer. Not the overwhelming hops of Ruination, not too much malt to make it too sweet. Simply perfect. If you have any friends who insist Bud Light is good beer, given them a glass of this and watch the reaction."
"This is a hoppy IPA without a substantial amount of malt body. The taste is dominated by a medicinal citrus injection. For the hop-fanatic in me this is a wonderland of bubbly bitterness that tickles the tastebuds long after I take a sip. For the IPA-lover in me it is too linear, and its focus on over-the-top hops denies the complexity of a malty base. Definately worth picking up again."
"This brew pours a nice strawberry orange, with a one finger marshmallow head which fades fairly quickly into a ring and island. The smell is citrus apple and a bit of pine. Taste is slightly sweet, big and hoppy as hell. Light ready malts with grapefruit and piney hops. Aftertaste is strong and hearty. Mouthfeel is surprisingly crisp and full. Great session beer and may I just say the burps are exquisite. A classic that'll never die. Everything about this beer is big."
"Golden color with a creamy head and nice lacing. Aroma was filled with citrusy hops, orange rind, and some grapefruit. Very hoppy, bitter, nice sweet finish. Very balanced, very good IPA, my favorite! I thought I had rated this too high, but upon revisiting, its really a top notch IPA."
"I hope that I can find some more Stone Brewing beers."
"I had tried this brew in a 22 oz. bottle a while back, and recently bought a six pack to try at home. It was a little late at night when I got home from work, went to the fridge, grabbed a bottle-opened it and took a swig. I suddenly thought to myself ""what am I doing?"" I grabbed a pint glass and slowly poured this delicate libation in. I brought the glass to my nose and took in the aromas. ""This must be what Bavaria smells like", I thought aloud. This beer has a golden hue and a nose of FRESH hops to it. I was once again, amazed by Stone, it smelled so fresh! The mouthfeel is heavy and the taste is quite strong, starting off hoppy and light like most IPA's but finishing with a little bit more bitterness than I was expecting. Which was a good thing. A perfect brew for anytime of year."
"This is a BIG IPA on all levels, not particularly overwhelming, just extreme in aroma and taste (which is certainly not a bad thing). This is what an IPA should be. Damn tasty...one should always have a few of these on hand."
"Nicely hopped, just as you'd expect from a West Coast IPA. The hops have a kick and are perfectly chosen, tasting good from the first sip through the end of the great aftertaste. I didn't experience any hops fatigue, which sometimes happens as a hoppy character comes to overwhelm other flavors in the beer as you drink it more and more. This one kept on tasting like it did on the first sip. A knockout IPA."
"Nothing special to look at. But upon my first sip, I proclaimed this the smoothest-tasting IPA in the universe. Layers-upon-layers of citrusy hops, with none of the lingering bitterness of some of my other favorite IPA's. Oh, this is a good one. The good folks at Stone Brewing never disappoint me..."
"I could 'temporarily' substitute this beer for oxygen...one of the best IPAs that I've had. Mmmm."
"Long Live Stone Brewery!"
"poured a beautiful orange color with nice head that fell to a spotty coating that lasted throughout the glass. Hops litterally flew out of the bottle and attacked my senses (not that I'm complaining). Taste is a bit over-powering at first, but gradually the hops and bitterness tone down to be very enjoyable. The dryness in the back of the moth is magnificent. Great beer, but one is enough if I need to do anything useful the next day."
"I can picture myself lying atop the fluffy cloud of a head that tops this clear golden concoction. Juicy citrus and piney hops are the most dominate aromas present. The mouthfeel starts smooth and then gives a lovely prick on the tongue as the hops take over for a somewhat dry and pleasantly bitter finish that lingers, but is not overpowering. Dry hopped, but certainly not overdone, this is an incredibly drinkable IPA. This would be a regular in my fridge if it were readily available in my area."
"The color is copper with a large and creamy off-white head. Retention is very good. The aroma is all hops, strong and citrissy. The taste is dominated by strong hop flavor with an above average level of bitterness. An underlying rich malt body gives this beer a bit more complexity. This is definently a great beer choice for a hop head, but this doesn't seem to be much better than the handfull of other IPAs I've sampled. I was probably expecting just a little bit more from Stone."
"Not the best IPA I've had by a long shot, and not the best beer I've had from Stone either, but still better than average."
"Taste is all hops. Sharply bitter hops offset with lighter fruity citrus hops. Medium bodied and lightly crisp. A dry long lingering bitterness. Good stuff, not a classic but good."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable and tasty beer. Sadly, Stone probably won't be available in Nebraska for quite some time. Thanks Mom for bringing a bomber back from San Diego! Highly recommended."
"overall: i love ipa's and this is definitely in my top 5. if you love them, the stone hops are a great change of pace to the typical ipa."
"I'd actually recommend this to a lot of people who drink BMC. It still has the familiar ""beer flavor"" that they're used to, but is so much better in every way. It's a great great all-around brew and one that's got me craving other great IPA's that are similar."
"Notes: My favorite Stone product. And I like every Stone beer that I've sampled."
"Drinkability is huge. The hops compell me to drink more and more. I like the contrast of the malt and hop on this beer. Might be my #1 session beer."
"Not much going on here, just another strong IPA. If they are your thing, than this is a good beer."
"This brew has a very creamy mouthfeel that is very pleasant. Hop bitterness is dominant and is coupled well with constituent ingredients. Has an almost floral taste in the middle that ends with a yeast laden aftertaste. Very tasty and quite drinkable. This brew could serve as the American IPA paradigm. Cheers."
"A great session beer, i could sit and drink this all night long."
"This will definately satisfy a hops craving and then some."
"I think Stone's Ruination IPA is overall a better quality and tastier, but this guy's not shabby at all. A good IPA."
"Drinkability: Great beer. I look forward to drinking lots of this in the future."
"12 oz. with no freshness date, but I've kept it for a several months to see what would happen. Served chilled in an enlarged flute. Pours an orangey color with a 1 finger tan head that leaves sticky lacing. Aroma consists of citric and piney hops with biscuity malts behind it. The flavor is the same but has an overpowering wet paper character that lets you know it is past its prime. It has a medium body and nice carbonation considering. When it was fresh it had a huge fluffy head and wonderful flavor - I will re-review when I get a fresh one."
"good lord this is fantastic! . each sip increases the desire to take another sip. wish i had better access to other highly rated ipa's to compare this with. but until then, this will have to be: 5.0 - exceptional"
"Reminders of the hops hang around for a while. Very drinkable beer, goes down nice for 6.9%. I could easily have another one of these, if there weren't so many others to try."
"Drinkability is great."
"As far as IPAs go, this is one of the better ones that I have tried. Not too fruity and the bitterness just makes me want more. This beer goes down way too quickly."
"Ut Vivat, Crescat, Floreat!"
"Stone IPA is wonderfully drinkable. It is ""The Nectar"". The English soldiers in India would have been ecstatic to pull this IPA off the boat!!"
"One personal caevet: well, 3F Alpha King is very comparable, and I can get that one locally without the kick in the sack shipping charges."
"Pours a light amber color, very clear, with a small head that falls quickly and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is all about the hops - US West Coast hops - citrus, slight pine, and slight spice. Reminds me of the DFH 90 min, in that the nose says big hops and the flavor is much more smooth and mild than expected. Some of the hop flavors come through after swallowing, but there is a solid caramel character and some bitterness. The body is moderate, but still full and interesting. Drinkability is great."
"Drinkability: not so overly hopped that it is undrinkable. This is very tasty and refreshing as long as you like bitter. MMM...can't wait till its sold in my state."
"Drinkability: For IPA lover such as myself....this one could be sessioned"
"For my money, one of the better IPAs around. Great for singles, great for sessions. This is a great example of how to make a beer with more character, but perfect balance. Cheers to Stone!"
"Drinkability is absolutely top notch. The standard to which all other American IPA's should be compared."
"Drinkable for sure but not overly so. I could have more than one in a sitting but would not be apt to push this beer too much. Very enjoyable and as such enjoyed in respectable moderation. All in all, a very good beer and one I'll go to again soon."
"A must try. I like how this breaks the mold a bit of the overly cascade laden west coast ipas and goes for a similar sweet, citrus mix w/o relying too heavily on the grapefruit."
"Was kind of surprised just now when I noticed I have never reviewed this beer. Pours a pretty pale copper. Perfectly clear. Lots of foamy head and substantial lace. Nose has more than just the hops that I was expecting, there's a nice malt base there too. Taste is a little piney, but very well balanced with the malts so the hops don't knock you over. The malts actually provide a pretty full body flavor to the beer. Not a dry finish at all."
"Had with a nice hard cheese akin to an aged cheddar. Went perfectly."
"This was the beer that accompanied my ribs on my first - and long awaited - trip to Redbones, and I couldn't have asked for anything more. Golden color with a soft one-finger head. Huge floral hop aroma. Very spicy with some cirtusy overtones. Great strong taste, but not so strong that it was overpowering. Great mouthfeel that could have very easily left your mouth very dry, but didn't. With such a high ABV, it brings the drinkability down a bit. This was a fantastic IPA that I would definitely buy again in the future."
"Overall, the best IPA I've ever had. Forget my allegiance to the Stone brewing company... this is a solid, GREAT IPA. If you're in the mood for a hoppy IPA and haven't tried this yet, buy yourself a couple!"
"Taste: Full hop assualt. Bitter, but not astringently so. The malt must be in there somewhere, but this tastes like liquid hops. I likes me some hops, so that's good. What sweetness there is seems to show itself after the initial hop taste and linger some. Usually I get the sweetness first, odd."
"Very nice example of style. Well done. The dryness and bitterness isn't always pleasant on the finish, but other than that..."
"This is a new IPA, sporting a gargoyle emblem. A transparent bottle that really shows big bubbles in there."
"Pours a clear yellow/bronze color. Fair amount of white head that leaves nice lacing for the entire glass. The smell is all floral hops. Just what you would expect from an ipa but nothing too complex. The taste is where things start to get really good. Again nothing too complex, just wonderful hops bitterness but it's not overpowering at all. Very nice balance of sweetness to control the bitterness. Very smooth finish for such a hoppy beer. This one gets added to my list of favorites. Because of the nice balance you could drink a lot of these in one sitting."
"Drinkability: I am so thankful I had the opps to snatch this in Indiana. I so wish we had this stuff in the Mitten. Delicious brew. I wish I were able to to put its drinkability to the test as well!"
"Wow, I'm surprised I hadn't tried this brew yet. This is right there with Hop Devil and Hop Walllop. Pours a light amber yeloow with a great initail head and some of the best lacing I've seen. Smell is extremely inviting floral hops...highly rated because it absolutely makes you want to drink it! Taste is eqaully impressive. Definite strong hop presence that last throughout, BUT has an underlying smoothness that makes the experience very enjoyable. The hops linger on the back palate with a pleasant lightly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a medium quality and drinkability is very good considering the strong hop presence...a must for hopheads!"
"Pours a nice translucent golden color. Quarter inch head that quickly dissipated. Very nice hoppy aroma. Leaves a lingering thin lacing on the inside of the glass. Awesome hop bite upfront and finishes with a nice malty undertone. Medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable IPA."
"Dark gold with a big head this beer has one of the better big hop noses out there. The taste is very refined for the style , with the hops allowing for the malt to provide the midbody. The finish is not as bitter as I would have expected. This is an IPA that shows muscles but does not flex them."
"Brought back to North Carolina from Western Mass bottle: gold yellow haze color, decent thick head, immediate hoppy smell, very smooth taste with great balance and super hop finish. very drinkable, wish I had brought back more, upset that we can't get here in NC. Will have friends in Ohio pick some up for me."
"Pour me another!"
"Drinkable, to be sure."
"Shouldve def bought a sixpack, Probably my favorite IPA right now."
"Pours a golden orange with a frothy white head, streaming bubbles and a very nice lace pattern. Smells of floral and citric hops, grapefruit, lemon zest, toasted malts underneath, and an earthy banana yeasty quality. Initial citric hop blast on the tongue, piney, good malt balance. Bitterness is not overwhelming, but does leave a lingering aftertaste. Slightly oily, moderate cabonation. Goes down pretty easily, but keep a palate cleanser handy if making this a session."
"High Hop Tide Warning! Be the bitter! Get ready for a hop kick. This ones good from 50 yards."
"Probably my favorite IPA. Not for the faint of heart, this beer has some serious hops. All balanced with a nice maltiness and caramel characteristic. Pours a golden amber. Aroma his very hoppy, kinda oily in a good way. Very floral. Tons of hops present in the taste, all very well balanced. Very drinkable beer. Excellent after a bunch of sweet beers to cleanse the pallete."
"Decanting this bomber reveals a pale golden colored brew with a thriving frothy white head. Some patchy lacing is left as this ale is greedily consumed. Aroma is nice and strong. Probably the best nose to any IPA I've ever experienced. The prerequisite hops are present to a large degree - citrous and pine notes are tantalizing, dancing with an herbal quality. What sets this aroma apart is a sweet, estery, floral aroma - quite wonderful really. There is also some caramel and pale malt smell present. Do they sell air fresheners like this?? The taste does not disappoint that which the smell put forth. The lovely product of dry hopping is immediately evident. Lots of clean citrous, grapefruit, and some pine nip at the tongue. Assertive hops? Yes sir. However there is a wonderful balance by smooth malt and sweet caramel. True to the IPA style, the malt holds back and allows the beautiful hop character to shine. A little spice and herbal notes dance around as well. Although the malts take the back seat, they never leave entirely. The flavor is exceptional in the fact that it is all about the overall flavor - not just a kick-in-the-nuts blast of hops. The hops are diverse, and the malt character is expertly contrived. Finish is a great blend of dryly bitter hop oils and the faintest of sweet malt. A little alcohol warmth in the finish drives this brew home. Mouthfeel is smooth, but a little thin. Overall, this IPA is so good, its probably sinful. Who cares - not me. I'll have another (and another)."
"I love this beer, I always get it because I am lucky enough to have a Vons a block away that carries it in sixers for 7 something. It looks nice, rich dark golden yellow, with a nice head if poured hard. The head doesnt stay but the lace does. Strong pine and spice aromas. The taste is smooth with the perfect bitterness for me. I can drink a lot of these."
"fine piney bitterness (though it didn't linger) and a beautiful brew. i don't often hand out 5s but there was something striking about a bomber of this stuff poured into a nice huge mug. brillirantly translucent golden amber with a fine head"
"Damn I wish Michigan could get Stone! I had to go down to Ohio before I could ever experience the Stone IPA. Beautiful pour. Copper color with auburn in the middle and an almost golden color around the sides. Huge fluffy white head. Tons of lacing. I love it! Aroma hits me upon opening the cap. Lots of floral hops, almost like walking through a garden. I get a slight pine sensation in the aroma as well. The body in this beer is rather thick for an IPA and holds the flavors of the hops very well. The hop flavor is very floral and that is the showcase here but a nice little hop bitterness comes through in a citric way. Juicy orange and grapefruit bitterness provide an excellent compliment to the floral flavors. Malt also is detectable. It seems rather bready, almost biscuity, with a honeyish sweet compliment. Finish is medium and lingers with a pure hop flavor but is not really too intense. Very drinkable beer here and it seems like there is no way this beer is 6.9% abv. Another excellent Stone offering."
"Conclusion: Less typing, more Stone IPA."
"Stone IPA pours a cloudy copper/gold, with very little head. Beautiful. It's aroma is one of the most pleasing in my experience --reminiscent of lush grapefruit and spiced strawberries. Thank goodness the flavor isn't nearly as sweet as the smell. This one starts out with a sharp hoppy bite -- then it mellows with notes of peach and pineapple, with mandarin undertones -- and it finishes dry and hoppy. This is an excellent IPA with many pleasant surprises."
"Wish I could get this one locally."
"Drinkability/notes: A superb example of a style that is not a favorite of mine, as I prefer an emphasis upon malt rather than hops. But excellent, nonetheless."
"Reflection: This is a pretty good beer but not what I was expecting from Stone. The hops never took over the beer it was very well balanced. Again great beer but not a great IPA in my opinion."
"22 oz. brown bomber with no apparent best before date."
"Reaching the end of this bottle is like loosing an old friend."
"Growler filled at the brewery. Despite a day in the growler it still poured with a great head, and nice retention. Left a nice lace down the glass. Aroma and taste are predominately hops, but there is enough malt to make this a nicely balanced beer. Amazingly smooth for a 6.9 % ABV beer. If you are a hop-head, this should be a staple .. otherwise avoid it."
"This isnt quite as hoppy as I would have expected, and I was a bit disappointed by that. The hit at the front is mild and spicy. The taste ramps up though out the trip through the mouth, and lingers strongly in the aftertaste. There is a slight grassiness most prevalent in the aftertaste. Despite lacking mouth-punching hops: it is a very well balanced brew."
"As for drinkability, I think it speaks volumes that I regret having bought a six pack of this before trying one. I'm about halfway through and my opinion hasn't changed - this just isn't an interesting IPA."
"Note: As good as this is, I prefer ruination."
"Wonderful. A classic in every sense."
"Overall, a decent IPA. There is some hop in the taste, though it's not as strong as I like and disappears too quickly. I was also disappointed by the lack of any hop in the nose. The mouthfeel isn't bad, though I think it could be a bit less thin."
"I am left with a befuddling gingery taste in my mouth."
"A fabulous strong IPA. Heavily hopped but well-balanced. Probably the best IPA I've had to-date. Too bad Stone isn't distributed in Georgia. At least Tennessee isn't too far for the occasional road trip..."
"This may or may not be a ""session beer"" due to the higher alcohol content. But it goes very well by itself or with some appetizers at the bar. I definitely would recommend this beer to anyone interested in IPAs."
"Very yummy IPA. Unique, too."
"Drinkability- Very...in one word. I can now see why this is tons of peoples choice for their favorite session beer. It's right in the middle of the hop range. Not super in your face (which can be good) and not on the watery thin side (which is almost always bad). If there was just a tad bit more hops (maybe another 10-15 IBU's) I would live off this beer. But, even the way it is brings great pleasure to my taste buds. Great brew as I expected from Stone. Haven't been dissapointed yet."
"Stone IPA is the modest little brother of Arrogant Bastard. It doesn't get the attention of its sibling. If it came from another brewery, this beer would be more garner more attention. As it is, it's a damn fine beer that just needs a little love."
"Translucent strawberry blonde, with a white cloud of of head that quickly gave way to clingly ring of lace, but with only a swirl the head came right back to life, giving away that incredible hoppy aroma. Pine trees, citrus, grassy, this thing has the whole nine yards. The first sip goes down dry and lip-smackingly bitter, but somehow the malt fights it's way through and holds on to the back of your palate after the first coat of hops saturates your tastebuds into submission. Maybe my sample was getting a little old (6-8 months I'd say), but I kinda tasted a little vanilla in the aftertaste, something I didn't notice when I had the first 2-3 from my 6 pack. Alcohol also makes it's presence known after about the half pint mark. For some people balance in a Beer is important, and I sort of fall into that catergory, but sometimes in life you find balance in inequality, order in chaos, yada-yada-yada. This Beer is the gold standard of American IPAs, and my personal favorite from Stone, regardless of the Bastards and the Ruinations and whatever. This one I could drink every day, I've enjoyed it this summer in the balmy heat of Florida and last night in the great Canadian winter. I'm a very seasonal drinker and rare are the brews that I crave year-round, but this one is on the list."
"When I drink any Stone beer, I have to put on Pantera (RIP Dimebag) as loud as I possibly could. For every beer that they make, Pantera has the perect song to go with it. For the IPA, it's F#*&ing Hostile. Why? because this beer really is hostile. A hoppy masterpiece. When you want a smooth, well-balanced beer, it would be in your best intrest to keep the hell away from this one. If you are looking for an over the top aggressive hop monster, you've looked in the right place. I love it. Pours a hazy orange colour with a thick white head. The aroma is grassy and very strong. The taste is as bitter as could be and is just full of grassy and citric tastes. I want more. Turn up the music!"
"Overall: Not my favorite IPA, and not one that my tongue could handle drinking every night, but a damn fine beer that I'll enjoy whenever I can get my hands on it. For those of us who like our hops, you can't beat it."
"Pours with a dark amber body, and a thin tan head that lingers. Very floral, almost menthol-y hops aroma, but still nicely balanced. Taste is definitely an IPA, with a very strong hops flavor up front, but unlike most IPAs this definitely has enough extra flavors (bit of malt, bit of yeast, bit of caramel) to really round it out. Nice body, very refreshing. Very dry, crisp finish. Very drinkable, probably one of the best IPAs I've had. Between this and Arrogant Bastard, I think I'll have to get some more Stone brews when the opportunity presents itself."
"Two words: big and citrus. This one isn't the most complex IPA out there, but it should be held as the benchmark. Big citrusy flavor cascade down the tongue with a malt balance. A dollop of lacing floats on the beer and the sides. I took my dog for a walk around the block and when I got back the pleasant aftertaste was still there, like a tattoo. Is it the best IPA? Probably not. Really fucking good? Yes."
"A fantastic beer, really amazing aroma and well balanced body....just have to get myself a bottle of ruination next"
"As soon as I hear the initial hiss from the bottlecap I'm enjoying more pleasant hop aroma than I thought could ever be possible. Wow. If I could give this beer a 6 for aroma, I would. It pours a pale, golden color - not as pale as a macro by any means or as filtered though. The taste of this beer matches the aroma with overwhelming citrusy, piney hop flavors. Stone must have thrown an absurd amount of northwest hops in this brew. There's an unusual amount of sweetness, but for an IPA, that's still not much sweetness. The only thing that keeps me from giving a 5 in taste is the bitterness. I wish this beer could be more bitter, but that's just because I'm an over-the-edge hophead. Perfectly drinkable as a session brew, but watch out!"
"Drinkability: Astoundingly drinkable!"
"Quite light in body with a crisp carbonation. Quite lovely. Very easy to drink quantity."
"Light orange amber body with a thick and rich creamy looking head. Nose is all hops and very enticing along with a sweet citrus aroma. Taste complements the nose perfectly. The hop flavor is the best I ever tasted. Big piney oily hop taste along with a sweet grapefruit flavor. Very light malt taste hiding in the background. Ends with a smooth bitterness and a very subtle bready/biscuit aftertaste that makes you really want another sip. This beer is not harsh at all. Just easy drinking all the way. Oh this baby is good! I can drink these all night long. If you're not a big IPA fan I would give this beer a try. It might very well convert you."
"Excellently ""balanced"" for a west coast IPA, with prominent pine and citrus hop aroma and flavor, but without punishing IBUs. Highly drinkable hop-juice, this is. And all backed by clean, solid malt. Goddamn. I do think this is my favorite IPA. It's emminently drinkable, delightfuly hoppy (and in a non-masochistic way). Kudos to Stone for some subtlety in this one."
"Taste is very hoppy, with a fairly strong up front bitterness flowing into very nice hop, malt, and slitely citrus flavors. Bitterness resides quickly and it has a good body and great mouthfeel, with great overall balance."
"Wow. I forgot how damned good this beer is. Blew SNCA out of the water in a side-by-side tasting."
"On draught at Barley's Smokehouse. I think this beer suffers unfair comparisons to Stone's other, bigger beers like Ruination. When trying this one I made it a point to judge it against other IPAs, not against other Stone beers. As such this is a pretty good IPA. Pours a dark amber color with a thick off-white head and nice lacing. The aroma is mostly hoppy, and after struggling a little I could smell some citrus as well. Medium-bodied and very smooth-drinking, with hops and spice at the forefront. Malt and a bit of citrus are in there as well. All in all, while not packing the punch of some of my favorite IPAs, this is an easy to drink and well-made IPA."
"Notes: Lots of dry hopping, great hop aroma, flavor, and bitterness. 6.9% is not detectable in the taste, but you can definitely feel it. Great pale ale with good balance."
"Ok, this is a great IPA, pours a nice reddish color, with a 1 inch head that dissipates to a nice lace. The taste, and mouth feel are amazing. The taste has a very nice fruity hoppy flavor, followed by a nice bitterness. The mouthfeel is creamy, and as smooth as a silk, with just the right amount of carbonation. Awesome beer, woo hoo"
"Pours out a hazy copper-orange color with an excellent off-white head that creates thick, lumpy bubbles. Makes a great impression right out of the bottle! The aroma is strong with both pine and grapefruit. Hops and malt take a backseat, but are still present underneath. The taste is as big as the bottle and Stone Brewery's reputation. The hops hit with a huge bang right from the first sip. Some faint hop sweetness works into the fold in the middle, then disappears as the lingering hops slam your senses to a bitter / sour finish that is quite dry. Mouthfeel is just about right: full bodied but carbonated just enough to dampen the blow of the hops. One area this offering scores just a little lower is the drinkability. It's just a bit too sour to drink much. One bottle is probably about all I could handle at any given time. However, all things considered, this is a truly great IPA that is worthy the Stone name."
"A rather light orange hue, thin yet well retaining head; pine and hops, hops and hops on the nose, intimidating as is the bottle. Creamy, twangy hops blast the palate, malt is there; very very well balanced; smooth and sharp, what an IPA should be. Grapefruit and orange in the tastings as well; whatever the ABV, its sneaky; read and heed; this is one darn fine IPA, the standard which all should be judged. Simple and to the point!"
"The definitive version of a West-Coast IPA...this is an awesomely pungent beast, yet balanced by beautiful malts, and is supremely tasty. It took me a while to get used to Stone stuff, but this is just one hell of a beer, and one of the top 5 IPA's I've ever had.Stupendous!"
"Ooh, needles the palate with a hop portfolio. Fantastic mouthfeel. There's grapefruit rind, and juice. White peppercorns. A malt wash, like a water color of malt. As it warms the malt is still present as a color almost as much as a sweetness. Hops mellow to a vapor. Man this is great with salty hot dogs and hot banana peppers."
"I wish the beer were a bit more full-bodied and less grapefruit juice. They may be personal preferences, but let's face it.... has not the latest hop craze been a bit cultish and gimmicky?"
"Excellent IPA."
"Drinkabilty: I might stick with this one for a while."
"12 OZ bottle (thanks Sam). decants a golden-orange color with a big sticky white head that laces the glass... minimal carbonation...scents of plumbs, musty caramel and ample floral hopping. Starts mellow with a nice whack of fruit laden malts....THEN the hops take over and make a complex floral/grassy/bitter mixture from those northwest cones melding with the ample cramel malts gives a buttery peach impression...finish is surpisingly thick with the bitterness restrained by the maltiness plays long on the aftertaste as a lingering bitter fruit impression. A big beer for the style."
"Resinous, piney hops, with grapefruit, orange, and slightly floral notes. There is enough malt backbone to keep this from becoming one of those ridiculous hop monsters, but there are plenty of hops, enough to satisfy even the most discriminating of hop heads. Mouthfeel is rather delicate, and the bitterness left on my palate lingers just long enough for me to take my next sip. Drinkability is outstanding -- if ever there were a session IPA, this would be it."
"Maybe my palate has changed since my original review 11/01/2004, but I find it difficult to enjoy this beer these days. Aroma is a bit sour, reminds me of homebrew for lack of a better description. Huge hoppiness with a grapefruit like twang, but the problem is that it lacks balance. A more assertative malt backbone would make it less of a one dimensional brew."
"pours a nice golden, clear body with a small bubbly head. smells of a nice medium floral hops, and something that reminds me of fruit candy. Tastes pretty good. This beer has a great balance, the hops are not too strong, and dont overpower a light roasted malt flavor. Very smooth and very drinkable. I was expecting some bitterness from stone, but I am pleasantly surprised at the overall balance. This would have to be one of my favorite IPA's, a must try. especially since you would have no clue it is close to 7%"
"Easy drinking IPA. Not on the top of my list, but it is quite tasty."
"I almost enjoy smelling this hoppy brew as much as I like drinking it. The sweet, musty nose stays with you even when you walk away from the beer. The taste is just hoppy goodness. It tastes like it should be darker than it is. Great spiciness. The mouthful is oh so creamy and the aftertaste makes me want to crack open another. I think I will. One other note, it's difficult to review this beer because I can't stop guzzling it for long enough to make any thoughtful observations."
"Thanks to HardTarget for sending me this one."
"Maybe it's because I've been drinking a lot of good IPA's lately (I had a Ruination much earlier in the day) but this beer struck me as solid, yes, it's obviously a good beer, but it doesn't really challenge the style as much as thier other beers do. A good beer to drink nonetheless."
"Beatuiful and pale with nice carboantion throughout the drink. Big, fluffy head which is white and leaves a lot of lace. The aroma is piney like a huge truck of hops was dumped straight into the biol. Taste is strong, a bit of alcohol and a lot of citrousy, astringent hop oils dominate the palate immediately. This is a good beer, worthy of a lot of admiration, but in the end I think its biting off more than I can chew. A little too bitter and carbonated."
"I have had this IPA from Stone several times and I finally decided to review it. This is an awesome American IPA that really amazes me. Recommended for anyone who enjoys IPA's with a major hoppy profile."
"Pours a golden copperish mixture with a nice white head that falls to ring of foam but laces nicley. Aroma is mostley floral hops with sweet caramle malt some citrus hints sneaking in. Taste is hops then sweetmalt takes over for an instant then more floral flavors with a bitter kick. This is a very balanced IPA malt and hops in the perfect blend being a Stone I was expecting hop overload but this is just a good solid IPA. If not for the bottle never would have guessed it as a Stone. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, it is a solid IPA, nothing extaordinary but very nicely done."
"Thanks Mrpicklerelish for the bottle"
"Mouthfeel is spot on and makes this brew easy to down. Big gulps make me happy. Drinkability is very good as well. If I had access to this I could down a few in a night and enjoy every minute. Thanks to my friend kmpitz2 for bringing this one by for me!"
"As an aside, I really need to do a side-by-side tasting of this and Smuttynose's IPA offering, because each time I drink one, I swear it's better than the other. Hooray for both."
"From a 12 oz. bottle pours a clear very light amber color with a white foamy head. The head left a little too quick, however there was a nice amount of lace on the glass. The smell of hops hits you immediately. This is more of a grassy, or herbal hop smell compaired to citrus or grapefruit that is common. Although, there seems to be a slight citrus note in the nose as well. The taste again hits you with hops that are spicy and grassy. There is a good amount of malt that keeps this beer from being too out of control. Medium body, carbonation is moderate. The alcohol in this can sneak up on you after a few, but still pretty drinkable. Overall this is pretty straightforward, hops and hops, with just enough malt. Great example of an American IPA."
"Pours an amber-copper color that is best described as orange. A couple of fingers of white head on top. Traces of lacing left on glass. The smell is an overpowering , yet wonderful hop aroma. Taste is of hops with a flavor Im not thrilled with. Okay, but not great. A little too much of the bitter aftertaste hanging around in the mouth. After finishing one, I dont really want another. I have 5 more to drink, and Im sure I will enjoy them, but its a very good, but not great beer."
"Light copper color, fluffy white head that lasts, nice lacing. Aromatics are very malty... almost worty with a floral citrus finish. Flavor is extremely well balanced between the hops and the malt. The bittering hops are up front and assertive but moves into a very hoppy flavor with a huge malt backbone, finishes slightly sweet. The mouthfeel is pleasant, medium and slightly dry. Very drinkable, the alcohol is a bit on the high end for a session beer... but thats okay, I enjoy it thoroughly."
"The beer pours a golden/yellow color with a nice, inviting white head. Good citrus hop aroma -- and definite American IPA profile. As the beer warms a bit, malt balance comes through in the aroma. Maybe could use a little more malt, but not much. Balance is what makes this beer for me, so I wouldn't want to mess with it too much."
"Had this on tap for the first time recently and Wow what a difference. Pours the same orange-copper colour. Not much of a head, but then again I dont know how long it sat before it was brought to me. The smell is lovely piney hops. Almost a bit medicinal in a good way. The taste is similar to the bottle, but the hops seem fresher and more pronounced. Mouthfeel is smooth with just the prickle of the hoppiness to let you know its still there. Drinkability is great. I could drink this off the tap all night. And WOW what hop burps."
"This came in the typical Stone 22oz silk-screened bomber with the gargoyle on it. This poured out a light orange with a tall rising out of the glass head of off white foam. Scattered lacing was left around the glass as this was consumed. Strong floral aromas rose from the glass that was backed by and equally string citric piney smell. Completely hop dominated nose but not to the point of being over done, there was a doughy malt presence keeping it in check. Citric bitterness hit the tongue first with a slightly sweet malt coming though shortly after. The after taste was mildly bitter with an earthy hop bite. A fairly balanced flavor that keep the emphasis on the hops. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp with about a medium body. I could drink this stuff all day, one of my favorite IPAs."
"Drinkability: I had no problem finishing the bomber. Would I buy more at $6 a pop? I can't say. I know I barely prefer HopDevil just for orginality, and it is much more affordable on this side of the country. Someone brings them to me though....watch out. Glug, glug, glug."
"Overall, a good IPA. A bit more malt would really make this a winner for me, but overall, not bad at all."
"Overall I like the balance of the beer (which is slanted decidely to the hops) and the crispness of the final product."
"This is my first Stone product. The appearance is nice. Pours a nice golden orange color, slighly hazy with a smallish white head. The smell is fairly strong with hops, hops, more hops and maybe a acid like citrous scent. The taste is fantastic. I am not a hop head but this is loaded with hop flavor and bitterness and I enjoyed it. Wow ! Holy hops ! The mouthfeel is good. Much thicker than I expected. It really coats the tongue and mouth letting the flavorful beer be enjoyed. There is a long lasting aftertaste of well...hops. This is a good IPA. This would be hard for me to drink all night but two or so is just right."
"this was, by far, the 'safest' stone brew i've had thusfar, and probably the most disappointing. was it still good? of course, but did not live up to the stone 'hype' so to speak. i expected a hop onslaught, but maybe i'll get that when i sample the ruination later on in the week. this one seemed tame by west coast standards, dare i say more like an east coast ipa. it pours an above average amber colour. nothing special, but better than average. head is fairly thin, but sticky. carbonation is abound throughout the body. the smell is a nice blend of bread, hop, butter and a touch of pina colada. very nice but it doesn't stray much from what you'd expect from an ipa. the flavour is a nice balance between juicy sweet and hoppy. it starts off sweet, moves into the hop attack and then finishes with a dryness that still has hints of juicy sweetness interlaced. the hop burps are quite flavourful. mouthfeel was a touch thin but this was an enjoybale and highly drinkable brew overall. is it strange to say that i enjoyed this one while being let down by it at the same time? well, i was, but i'd still happily sample it again any day."
"Drinkability: If I didn't care about my tongue, I would drink them all night! I don't consider myself a huge hop-head and I found myself loving this. It's really a finely crafted beer. Most people probably couldn't make a session out of it but it's refreshing enough that it would work for me. Even if you aren't into hoppy beers, you should try this just to make sure."
"Pours a dark golden to light amber color, very clear, wih a small white head that leaves a beautiful, thick lacing behind. The aroma is flat-out amazing... once again, I'm engulfed by fumes of new carpet smell (seems to be something each Stone brew I've had has in common with the next), grapefruity citrus smells and honey as it warmed. As expected of Stone, all tastes were huge as well... really spicy up front, honey-cereal sweet and citrus tangy in the middle and then a solid, dry bitterness that coated my tongue and lasted. Mouthfeel is slightly oily with medium body and carbonation, and overall, it's very smooth. One of the best IPAs I've ever had. Stone hasn't disappointed yet."
"22oz bottle. Pours out a deep orange/peachy color with a hint of golden color in there with a nice amount of carbonation that stays with you until the end. Smell consisted of lots of hops. I noticed on the back that it's dry hopped as well. Some background malts can be detected as well along with some citrus notes. Taste was quite nice. Big hops come across first along with some piney notes, but once you think the hops are going to have a huge bite, some nice malts hide the hops along with some citrus notes. Almost juicy-like in taste. Medium body with the right amount of carbonation blending in. Overall a nice well rounded IPA. First Stone I've had and look forward to many more."
"22 oz. bottle. The smell of fresh cannabis bud took me back to the days of yore with hydros and grow lights. Poured with no head. The taste was grapefruit bittersweet with enough of a malt presence to keep the hops from overwhelming. The full body of this brew carries the flavors nicely. Probably the best of Stones widely availible beers."
"This one pours a lovely orange color with a minimal white head. Smell is very hoppy and piney though not as assertive as alpha king or dreadnaught. Flavor, at first is predominately hoppy but the aftertaste lets some malt and piney notes come through. Very nicely balanced as I can have 2-3 without any palate fatigue. Excelent drinkablity for a 7 percent ale. Although it won't top alpha king or dreadnaught as my go to beer when I'm having a hop craving, I will definately be returning to Stone's IPA."
"Edit (3/30/05): I just reviewed my review, and I don't have any substantive changes to the review itself, except to note that I have found (as a non-hophead), that this really has become my beer of choice when I am in the mood for something hoppy (which does happen once in a while). It just fits the bill."
"Pours a beauty of a light copper color with a nice head and some nice lacing. The smell is of a nice hoppy citrus that when you smell you can't help but to say AAAHHH. The taste is smooth and hoppy which is what you want however here we have a nice balance and before you know it you are looking for another one. I only scored this one higher than the arrogance because it is a little lower than alcohol and I could probably drink several more of these before I started forgetting things. Stone Brewery I love you. Please come to Arkansas soon."
"Pours an nice amber-orange color into my Duvel tulip glass. The head is moderate, and dissipates quickly, leaving a bit of a ring of foam. The aroma is excellent. Floral hops, with a bit of that ""good marijuana"" smell, for lack of a better way to describe it. Like dark hydro. The taste is great. One of the better IPAs I've tasted. Very hoppy - a good balance of hops. A little floral. Just the right amout of bitterness. This is how an IPA should taste, in my opinion. The mouthfeel is good, but a bit weak in the carbonation department, in my opinion. A wee bit acidic, also, but that is to be expected in an IPA. Very drinkable. Easy to put multiple glasses of this one away. I highly recommend this ale to anyone who enjoys IPA and ESB styles of beer."
"Edit: I'm told Stone uses no Cascades in their beers. Perhaps I'm tasting Centennial or Amarillo... something is lending a citrus note. Whatever they're using... it's very tasty!"
"Wish this was available in Canada...if only it was."
"Not as overwrought as other Stone offerings can be, this is one I would gladly sit down with for a few hours."
"Many thanks to northyorksammy for introducing me to my first Stone product. 12 oz. brown bottle, green and white silkscreened enamel labelling, the blurbs on the back of the bottle are worth reading, the P.R. person comes across as having a personality and something to say with some substance. Pours out a cloudy marmalade colour, thickish foamy head which recedes to a ring and leaves some lacing. Hops are initially present on the nose, but seem to be biding their time, like a leviathan preparing to surface, grapefruit, pine and some spice, but enough malt in it's wake to not make it one-dimensionally overwhelming. Flavour is not as intense as I anticipated, some sweet malt at first triggers the explosion of hops that build and build and build towards and throughout the finish. Earthy and piney at first, then turning citrus, and the grapefruit rind on the finish. A well-contained IPA, the hops are not allowed to completely run wild and get out of control, there is method behind the madness, some direction. Mouthfeel is full and smooth. I think perhaps this would garner a higher rating if I had a fresher sample, but I'm enjoying this nonetheless, it holds up. Definitely worth further sessions."
"Had this on tap today at RedBones. I can't change much except the head was great, and the hops in the beer led to an even better retention of the head, and a nice lace. Great floral lead on teh nose. Maybe a little bit more of a bite from the hops than the bottle usually gives."
"What a great IPA. More drinkable than other beers of its style, for instance Magic Hat's HiPA. Alcohol is masked by the intensity of the hops. Dry and crisp, another beer that goes well with spicy food. Not overly carbonated, which is great. This beer is a work of art... now to find some ruination..."
"[ I see other have rated this higher- that is understandable. It is very good but did not knock me out]."
"Anyhow, in conclusion, it's my new favorite beer. If God were to choose a beer, He'd choose the Stone IPA. I firmly believe that."
"Very smooth IPA goes down easy. Very drinkable"
"Tough to review an interesting and very popular beer that you simply can't drink. In all the categories, smell, taste etc., I had the same reaction, ""wow this is really interesting, even complex", but in the end I did not want another one. I am not a ""hop head"" so I don't relate to being hit over the head with the overbearing, piney, almost tree sap flavor of hops, which is what this beer is all about. I guess I'm one of those who appreciates the balance of flavors in beer and not too much of any one. Very hard to score this ""interesting"" beer."
"This brew had the head of an IPA, but the body was a little on the light and clear side. The smell was classic, however. The two Gods of Hop scents, Grapefruit and Pine, came through with authority. The malt also made a strong showing, in a supporting role. On the taste front, no hops are spared. Citrusy-bitter and just bitter-bitter, all over the place. The malt keeps the brew semi-thick. The aftertaste is excellently piney. A very solid IPA that I will drink again."
"Pours an orangy amber color with a beige, fluffy head. Botanical, piney hop aroma with a bit of tea-like malt aroma, too. Balanced towards the hoppy side, this IPA is quite enjoyable. It's about 90 degrees outside and I could drink this all afternoon. A bit dry and a touch sweet in the finish, but wonderful. I like this IPA a lot. This flagship has some wind in it's sails."
"Overall a great IPA but a little more malt balance would have truly made this beer perfect..."
"At first taste, there is a hop explosion in the mouth, but once my taste buds recovered (midsip), this beer becomes startingly sweet due to some nice malts. There are some floral flavors as well. Overly bitter finish, but still the best IPA I've had."
"This is my favorite IPA. I love this stuff. The appearance is a clear, light amber color. The smell is beautiful, those flowery hops coming through nicely. The taste...right on for an IPA. It leaves that trademark bitterness on the back of your tongue. The mouthfeel is crisp, clean, refreshing. I like mine nice and cold, a perfect summer brew. The alcohol content is masked nicely, and the drinkability is good. This beer was my first IPA, and I've loved it ever since."
"Final Thought: This was my first IPA ever, my first Stone brew ever; and it won't be the last... ever...."
"Good beer. It's very hoppy, yet Stone still keeps enough malt character in the mix -- even though the beer is relatively dry -- to make is a well-rounded beer. The hops are aggressive, and have just enough of a harsh character (for lack of a less value-laden term), to make this a bold hoppy beer experience. If your fizzy -yellow-water-swillin' friends don't ""get"" hoppy beers, this could be the one that opens their eyes."
"Rich mouthfeel, but not overbearing, causing this to be very drinkable. For the price, one of the best IPA's out there."
"Beer is good. Happy IPA beering."
"I had to follow this up with nappy traffic to the shore. The hoppiness stayed in my mouth for some time. I'd definitely like some more."
"I now pray to the gargoyles of stone. This IPA is a powerhouse, steroid pushing machine that is off the charts terrific. Of course had this in the standard 22 oz bomber bottle. Pours a cloudy hazy gold with a cream white froth of a god head. Smell is potently hoppy, hops blast your nose, might singe the nose hairs right off, cleary sinuses for sure. Light citrus as will. The taste is a perfect balance of bitter and smooth. Fruity tones and a hop blast that blends perfect with the fruit and malts. Feels full and crisp and could drink and drink and drink. The beer was so special the moment of putting it to my lips will last a lifetime."
"Man, this stuff is good. Nice blend of hops, but smooth, with the good ol' IPA pucker. Suprisingly full bodied, this bad boy is one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure to behold, and every trip to Columbus (55 miles) has me bringing back a sixer or two."
"Hops in the taste, from start to finish. Nice bitter bite, without becoming acrid in the aftertaste. This is definitely an excellent representative of the style. you can almost imagine being a British soldier stationed in India, longing for the next shipment of this."
"A solid effort that I will buy when I find it. Currently, it is not available in the Chicago market."
"D&N: This is what an American IPA should taste like. So good, I'm wondering why it took me this long to try it."
"Authors note: I just learned today that Stone is a Cascade-free brewery...who would have guessed!"
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is exceptional! It has a beautiful array of floral hops which penetrate along with a solid malt scent. The taste is good. It has an intense hop flavor overpowering it's malt core. It goes down smooth and finishes quite bitter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great IPA. The aroma is awesome along with a really good hop and malt flavor."
"I wish I could say more about this beer, its really a fantastic beer. One of the best IPAs out there. I think the only problem with this beer is that its overshadowed by its big brothers. Its amazing, but compared to the ruination? Then you have the others in its family, the double bastard, and the imperial stout. Stone has just set the bar so high this one gets lost in the crowd. A great beer though. One Id have over and over again if the ruination didnt exist."
"Once again, Stone goes ahead and proves why they are one of America's finest brewers. Pours a rich opaque gold with light head. Smell is potent, thick with hops, tangy and sweet. Taste is outstanding. Lightly carbonated, the hops flavors dominate without overwhelming the tastebuds, which allows the beer's sweetness to shine. Aftertaste is primarily bitter, with a lingering sweetness. Absolutely delicious, would go great with a heart meal. Thumbs up!"
"Awesome beer, finally a chance to try a Stone brew and it does not disappoint. Now I need to try that bottle of Ruination I picked up. Yeehah!"
"Very inviting brew that will make you thirst for another and another."
"Had this brew on tap at Mahars the other night. Brew poured to a very nice brown/orange color with a slight head that broke down to light lacing. The aromas of this brew were all about the hops as I notice a piney, earthy smell with hints of grapefruit. The taste is very much about the pungent hopiness of this brew as you can notice it at the front and end of this brew. In the middle I am able to get a great biscuit (?) malt flavor that seems to keep things in somewhat of a balance. Over all a nice brew, definitely west coast and different from the IPAs that I am use to but a very good brew. Will looks for this brew in the future!"
"A better than descent India Pale Ale. Wonerful hops. Pours a beautiful rich amber color. There is a nice off-white head. A slight fruity nature to the smell (and taste). Taste is good: bitter with a fruity tinge. Definitely worth searching out and trying."
"Cheers."
" to start with the mortal apects- color only does so much for me as this beer is a yellow-orangish color, circa psychedelic 1971. We quickly take it to another level. In the sublime sense, clarity is wonderful and the smell is a heavenly sweet smel of floral hops. Excellent carbonation and wonderful head and glass lacing. this beer imparts a perfectly balanced beer drinking experience. taste is sensational with strong floral sweet tones of wildflowers and fresh cut grass. The sweetness balanced with an intense but mellow bitterness lingers, and flows, lingers, and flows on the tongue and through the palate. Drinkability is exceedingly dangerously high. A top notch, memorable representation of the style. a session beer for professional drinkers, with a connesouiers character profile. Easily in my top ten. My current sublime trip of choice. cheers!"
"Overall, this is probably the best IPA I've had to date. It's a nose ahead of Avery IPA and Victory Hop Devil."
"This is still the only Stone beer that I've managed to purchase by the case. I will have to pull the trigger on a case of bombers one of these days. This pours a creamy, orange-amber with a sticky, foamy off-white head and nice lacing down the glass. The smell is sweet citrus hop perfume with slight pine, grass and lemon. Oh what a wonderful bouquet! The taste is creamy, hoppy, soft, brittle... all of the above with a full malt backbone which tries to offset the hops, but just cannot win this battle. This is clearly a ""west coast"" IPA but so much more.... it's like a creamsickle it's so smooth and very nicely balanced overall. I wish I could find Stone products in quantities less than a case, but alas I will have to save up for my next foray into their wares. In the meantime, I have 23 more bottles of Stone IPA waiting for me in the fridge... gotta go!"
"It finishes very strong and is good to the last drop. I will buy more from Stone and can only hope they are all this good."
"Wyll-"
"Zum wohl!!!"
"A great IPA."
"So good it made me give money to a begger--and chat with him! That can't be such a bad thing."
"I just got my hands on another one and it was every bit of delicious as before. Had to come bump the scores a little bit."
"I truly love this one, but it's even better on tap. The hops are much fresher and the taste is cleaner, but that's a different review. Still a great tasty brew, and I love having it at home."
"All and all a very drinkable beer with great mouthfeel. As it warms it gets more and more character. What I liked about this beer was the fact that it was agressively hopped, but no so much that the hops took over the taste totaly. A very enjoyable beer."
"This is one of my favorite beers, definitely the best non-imperial IPA Ive tasted to date. To be honest with you I like this one just about as much as Ruination depending on what Im in the mood for. This one being a little more balanced and aggressively hopped yet still sessionable without destroying my taste buds or dehydrating my tongue. If I was rating strictly on enthusiasm Stone IPA would get straight 5s."
"Pale golden body with a massive beige head that refused to die due to nice natural carbonation. Aroma is floral, grassy, piney hops with an infusion of yeasty bready malt. The taste is a wonderland of hops with spicy-hot pine resin like quality to the beginning of each sip. Following that first assault by the hops, there are additional waves of grapefruit rinds, black pepper, marigold, and orange blossom. The malt adds a butterscotch like sweetness to the mix, and the yeast adds a grittyness to the mouthfeel. This is one of the absolute great IPAs anywhere. I look forward to the day when I can get this at my local store."
"A drinkable brew it is almost too much in the hops department."
"Pours a slightly cloudy light copper hue under an off white 1 finger head that lingers for a bit before settling to foam. There are some lace rings on the glass, but not much. The aroma is full of sweet flowery hopes - really full. Mouthwateringly full. The mouth is medium-bodied and slightly carbonated. The taste? Gosh, it's pretty good. Lots of sweet flowers and bitter hops, with a quite noticeable malt backbone. The finish is quite bitter, leaving a wonderfully crisp aftertaste that combines the malt with a hoppiness that makes you want to chew. Although I've had beers I thought were more bitter, this is definitely my kind of beer, and I can't get it where I live. Time to move!"
"Completely hoppy. Grapefruity all the way. Certainly crisp and appropriately taste bud annhiliating. But this has a real complex fruit presence, and the alcohol, perhaps, lends a hint of sweetness that more brutal, unforgiving IPAs lack. This is still a big beer, but somehow they manage to make it more quaffable. As a non-IPA lover, I say this is a damn fine IPA."
"It pours a bright orange color with a slight haze and a thin head. There is some decent lacing. The aroma has a lot of hops and some fruity grains. The bitterness is up front. The medium body is slightly grainy and sweet. It finishes with alingering dry bitterness. One helluva IPA."
"Notes: This is sooo drinkable. Not too bitter, but very malty."
"Notes: This one is just about the hops IMHO. Have you ever chewed on hop pellets...this is what it's like. I tried it at 50 degrees and on and off all the way to 60 degress and I can't get more of the malts. If you like balanced brews, this one is not for you. These kinds of brews are not hard to produce. It is okay, but not real good. It is rather one dimensional to come from a brewery of this caliber. Shocking to me that it is top rated when there are so many more complex beers out there. Cheers!"
"Yet another fabulous beer from this brewery. Greg...get this to Michigan, my friend... ;-)"
"A great beer that was more balanced at times than others. Some mouthfulls seemed to be all hops, and others seemed to balance out perfectly. Those that fell into the latter catagory were absolutely wonderful. I just wish that the citrus characteristics of the hops that came through in the aroma would have made it into the flavor. The flavor was all herbal."
"Absolutely, the hops are where it's at. The malt provides a notably subtle sub-layer, but it's there only to keep the hops from sucking the skin from the inside of your mouth. Still, for all the hop oils present, the bitterness is deliciously manageable. No person who craves hops could stop at one of thse, and in fact, I'm not stopping and refuse to count how many I've had. How many just doesn't matter, because satisfying a hops addiction is a timeless, unquantifiable joy when this nectar is around to do it."
"on tap at the gingerman: slightly hazy pumpkin orange-tinted brown. big creamy off white head the stayed around the whole time. tantalizingly huge spruce hop aroma with light fruity esters and citrus in the background. this is a very appetizing beer to look at and just inhale. perfect level of carbonation...sturdy medium body that is nice and chewy yet still perfectly crisp. crystal/bready malt flavors hold up rather well to an enormous pine needle hop bite. citrus tones are there but take second fiddle to the resinous piney taste. dry hopped to perfection. finishes super clean and dry and enjoyably bitter. hop burps last for hours. this is one helluva an IPA, i think i enjoy this one even more than the ruination. seems crafted with surgical precision, a hop-head's quaffing delight. delicious."
"Honestly, I was very underwhelmed by Stone's IPA. I guess I expected their signature (and wonderful) over-the-topness (yeah, I'll make up words, who's gonna stop me?). Once I got over that, I came to realize that this is a great beer meant for drinking, not knocking you on your ass. If this is locally available, you are lucky. If you are me, you have to drink 2 hours to get some more."
"Glad to see this in the 12oz bottles that have surfaced lately. Pours out a golden yellow with a stiff white head. Aroma of grapefruit and apricots. The hop flavor of this beer is tremendous, and should be a decent intro to hops seeing as the flavors are at the forefront, not the bitterness.Nice citrous hop blast with a mildly bitter aftertaste. There is some maltiness in there, but it provides a good base, not flavor. The Hops take over in this department. This is probably the best straight up IPA on the market for any hophead. Mouthfeel is slick then dry, and I could drink this all night. Top Notch!!!"
"The ""green-ness"" of this beer reminds me of Dogfish Head 60-Minute IPA, but this one is much better balanced. Yeah, its pretty much a one-note song--hops--but its balanced nonetheless. Exciting stuff."
"Wonderful citrus hop aroma, almost candy like, some grapefruit and oranges, damn! Half inch head, whitish yellow in color, leaves a smattering of broken lace above the clear, deep golden colored beer. The flavor is pretty intense, and actually increases after its swallowed. Light to moderate body with a pretty clean taste, the beer stops just short of being really bitter. Piney, citrus hop flavor up front , finishes like a bitter sugary grapefruit. At 6.9% abv it does a pretty good job of warming up my stomach. Theres a lot of flavor and aroma packed into this smooth drinkable beer, a really good (American) IPA. Hopefully once Stone is widely distributed in central NY the prices will come down because $5/22oz is a bit much to drink this often."
"This is my favorite IPA to date."
"Pours a clear copper color and is topped by a off white head. An immediate big hop aroma jumps from my glass and overpowers any malt presence that this beer might have. The aroma is grassy, herbal, citrusy, & it has a sweet hop nectar character. Quite simply, as I take my first sip, I know this is a hoppy bitter brew. The hops explode on your tongue. There is a balancing malt sweetness here that is required to carry this hop bomb. The hop character has strong notes of bergemot as well as some resiny overtones; this is just pure hop nectar. A very fruity beer, made more so by the citrusy hop character. Quite over the top in it's hoppiness. This beer is just damn good & I am so happy to get this on tap on a regular basis."
"This is just a great beer, I look forward to trying the Ruination to compare the two."
"ng"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden apricot color. Topped off with a reasonable amount of head that lasts and laces in pretty typical fashion. A surprisingly well-balanced nose for an IPA (though after drinking an Arrogant Bastard Ale beforehand, everything is relative). Floral hops are offset by plainly detectable light malts. This balance carries over to the taste, where the hops and malts play well together. Crisp, clean and very drinkable, this is a really nice IPA all around."
"This golden beer almost looks a bit too light under a modest white head. It offers a very hoppy aroma, which hints at the initial tastes - a symphony of well-blended hops. Unfortunately, the brew doesn't maintain it's complexity throughout the tasting, as it finishes thin and bland. For an IPA, the brew is a bit light but it is still quite drinkable."
"It pours a clear filtered? yellow with a small white head, this could be a pilsner and giving it 3 makes me wonder if I'm too kind just because it's Stone. Aroma is hop essence literally.. with a hint of fuel and quite salty as well together with the more traditional citrus, lemon and grapefruity profiles. A good sniffing which appeals me by its originality. Taste surprises right away being very citric. I simply don't understand how so many people can love it that much since it's so distracting? Neverthless, there's a touch of honey malt and it's very clean. Talking about balance is totally out of place though and it didn't seem particularly pleasant. The body is honest, a solid medium body, but not as mouth-filling as other Stones I've had. Basically, this was totally blown away by the Lost Coast Indica we've had just before. Just altogether way too citric sour for my liking, possibly the tartest IPA I've had to date and while it's a characteristic I truly love in many belgians, it didn't seem to fit here. Thanks Martin!"
"Great beer altogether. It may be the best IPA I have ever had."
"Nice measure of both hops and malt. The hops (of course) coming on strong and lasting straight through the finish, ending nicely with the malt. This is a great IPA."
"The beer as it cut and runs from the bottle a transpicuous golden amber color, the head supererogatory, the texture semi-creamy and the color a bright white, as it slowly erodes the lace forms a sticky sheet to smother the glass. Hop floral at the start, the middle sweet malt, citrus crisp, fresh and ever so inviting, a true portent of things to come this nose, start is nicely malted, somewhat sweet with the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its carbonations, the hops forthright in their spiciness; powerful but pleasing, aftertaste is desert dry, somewhat bitter, quite long lasting. One of several Stone beers I always have on hand."
"As I said, this is not my favored style, my tastebuds were a bit burned out on the hops by the time I was finished. Still an outstanding beer though, can't wait to try it again around mid-summer."
"This is a full body ale with wonderful carbonation. This may be the best IPA I've ever enjoyed. I am drawn to getting another even though I prefer variety."
"Bar none, this is the best IPA I've ever had. Wow."
"Pours a very nice (light) amber color. It had a modtly hop flavor to it right off the bat.the malt IS there, but this, by defiination is a hoppy beet. Smells nice a citrusy on the the pour, and it has a nice follow thouw when you go through it. All in all it has the prolific hop flavor that most Stone products have, and, all in all, it is a very nice brew, Find, and enjoy, it if you can"
"Special thanks to Bditty for this bottle I got on trade."
"tried this one on tap at the Blind Tiger in NYC, wow, awesome brew..minimal head, nice lacing .nice nutty malt center,very hoppy, alot of citrus and a snappy hop nose and finish, tiny bubbles, pleasantly low carbonation, soft mouthfeel, a pleasure on the toungue. IPA lovers should get to know this one!"
"Gotta have another"
"12 ounce bottle (stenciled)."
"This is a complex beer! A lovely copper-red color, a cream colored head, a lasting lace work on the glass, great humor on the bottle, massive grapefruit-rind hops, aromatic esters, a medium-light bodied ale, rich flavor, nicely malted, slightly sweet toasty flavors, followed by a dry knockout perfect bitter finish. Perhaps too strong for some, maybe not a session beer, but MAN! is this fantastic beer."
"Deep golden color with a white fluffy head. Detailed lacing goes down the glass as you enjoy this fabulous ale. Spicy hopped aroma hits your senses like a sledgehammer. The flavor hits the perfect balance between rich malt and bitter hop flavor. The flavor has you by the throat but the funny part is that this is the most drinkable IPA I have EVER tasted. You could drink this for hours contently except for the manly 6.9% ABV. Wow! This may be the most awesome ale ever except for SN Celebration Ale."
"A light gold color with some haze floats a very impressive, creamy, sticky, retentive head. The aroma makes me giggle like a schoolgirl. Huge grapefruit with noticeable peach and some resiny pine. Flavor is all about the hops. Sure, there is some breadiness, very light caramel flavor, and a certain sugariness, but the hops are clearly the focus. Very fruity in a citrusy way. The bitterness is surprisingly not harsh in any way, rather well balanced. Feel is extremely smooth, a bit creamy, and a hint of slickness. Alcohol is present mostly in its warming sensation. In the end it feels like sugary hops are stuck to your teeth. As with most hoppy beers, I enjoy this beer much more when served rather warm."
"Good looking painted (probably stamped) bottle. Pours with a slight haziness, golden amber but more golden. rich head. Aroma reminds me of raisins and citrusy mix. Tastes of a floral plum currant hoppiness finishing with a bit more maltiness. This is very close to Arrogant Bastard with less taste of alcohol. Very full bodied hitting hardest toward the back of the tongue. more drinkable than the arrogant bastard."
"12-ounce bottle, acquired via trade, thank you francisweizen!"
"Honey, lemon, wheat grass, grapefruit with a sweet cedarlike finish. This is fantastic! I had never known what wonderful flavors that little hop flower could bring to beer until I tried this. I really enjoyed this!"
"thanks for reading my review."
"Clear amber pour with a persistent beige head and sheets of lacing. Aroma of pine and lemon zest. Mouthfeel seems light to medium bodied, with plenty of hops bite. Taste is well mannered, quality hops with grapefruit and lemongrass jumping out of the glass. Well bittered without being offensive, and there is a solid malt background. Finishes crisp and dry, very pleasant aftertaste. If I had any more of these, I could drink them all day. I don't recall a more drinkable IPA."
"Tangy mouthfeel with a medium, if not a bit oily, mouthfeel. Alcohol is stashed away rather well making this a very drinkable beer. Good job Stone!"
"Not as good as the Ruination but a good offering from Stone."
"Paid $3.99 for 22 oz. Good smell, good taste, maltyness washed away by the dominating hops. You could drink a lot of this, but I'd spend your money on a cheaper IPA as this isn't anything terribly special. A great brew from Stone, but they've got many other far better beers than this."
"This beauty from Stone pours a deep orange color. A white head reached the top and left spotty lacing to the end of my beer. The aroma is a mixture of pine and citrus. Neither one overpowering the other, but making a nice mixture of the two. It is a fresh, crisp aroma with a hint of malt in the back ground. The taste is the aroma to a T. A floral rush of hops and a slight hint of malt, then a bitter after taste. A good bitter not a bad one, got to love that dry hopping thing! The hops cover any hint of alcohol in this brew, which makes it very drinkable and enjoyable to boot! Another great product from stone."
"I'm not going to re-review, but I am going to re-score now that I have quite a bit of IPA experience to reference. The taste score--I really hate to do this--falls to 4.5. (5/21/04)"
"I will certainly purchase this again if and when I see it."
"HopDevil and this are right there with each other, I can't even say which one I like more."
"Pale amber, with a bit of yeast/protein in suspension in this example. Flowery, hoppy aroma; white head which soon dissipates, but not entirely. Very hoppy taste - like an IPA should be - but not astringent on the palate; a nice, clean-drinking, flavoursome brew. Hops linger on the tongue for some time. To sum it up in one word: 'Yummy'!"
"""Please, Sir, may I have some more?"""
"Took a long time to get a bottle of this to Wisconsin, but it was worth the wait.Cloudy copperish color, not much of a head, inviting hoppy aroma with a beautiful bittersweet aftertaste. Every swallow you got a new fresh bold taste of hops and eventually a nice bitter film coats your tongue. Wish it were easier to get."
"Good mouthfeel. Not overwhelmingly thick or anything. Very drinkable for a beer this big, but I wouldn't recommend slamming back too many of these in one sitting. One bomber on a Sunday afternoon was enough for me, but I think I'll chase this guy down again one day for another kick in the tastebuds."
"Gourmet beer has a name."
"Medium sized off white head with a yellowish hue. Tons and tons of carbonation streaming like mad from the bottom of the glass. Small frothy bubbles form a sticky head which holds onto the sides of the glass all the way to the last drop. The head remains for a very long time, and eventually recedes to a thick lace. Some particles (hops?) can be seen settled on the bottom of the glass. The aroma is citric with considerable juicy grapefruit notes and a subtle backing of malts. Stone IPA is wonderfully smooth from start to finish. The malt backbone is ever-present despite the tendency for this brew to lean towards the direction of the hops. The hops are always well in hand and are never overbearing. Theres a slight bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. Medium bodied with a finely carbonated mouthfeel. Great IPA that is incredibly drinkable. I could drink this one all evening."
"Poured a bright, clear tawny gold with a fluffy white head and some sticky lace. The smell is big and strong floral hops. Taste is malt with a strong hop presence, citric and alcoholic notes.. The bitterness is just right, crisp bitter bite. Mouth is medium and round, smooth but also sticky on the palate, flurry on swirling in the mouth, medium to well carbonated. On the strong side for an IPA, but that is to be exected from this brewery. Holds yur palate hostage. Good and well done, but you wouldn't see me drink a sixer of this, not exactly a session beer."
"Yes, it's as good as folks say."
"Thanks to Gusler for the Bomber."
"Light straw color, small white foamy head. Aroma is spicy and fruity.A very hoppy beer, dry and crisp. Distinctive hop aroma. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are bitter and spciy. Beer is ""dry hopped"" for 2 weeks. A 60 IBU beer. Finish is clean and crisp. A nice bitter IPA. Good beer, etched beer bottle."
"Huge lychee, grapefruit and pine aroma, hops are very aromatic and sharp. Some nice sweetish malts quickly have the shit beaten out of them by a huge hop attack. The hops would have been delightful, if they'd used them in moderation. A lot of alcohol in the finish aswell. I mean its got a lot of flavour and all, but i just couldn't helped but be bored by the hops, overkill in this case made me- not disgusted, horrified or shocked- but bored, and that really surprised me. I was really dissapointed with how uncomplex it was."
"Finally got my hands on two bottles, and my expectations were high. It poured a nice golden orange color with a 1/2"" head. The head slowly disappeared to thin trails on top of the beer. The aroma was phenominal - strong floral with a sweetness that left me inhaling a few times before the first taste. The taste brought immediate bitterness that mellowed to a slightly bitter and sweet malt on the tongue. This lasted for a good minute or so. The hop and malt balance is perfect, even though both are bold. Being a regular Hop Devil drinker, this IPA is in an elite league."
"Drinkability: Hell yeah! And I'm not much of a hophead. Definite regular purchase. I hope the 12 oz. are this good."
"The initial flavor is not as hoppy as I would expect from the aroma, but wait, there it is. The bitterness starts to come in from the edges of my tongue. It has a great hoppy bite to it. Crisp, and very flavorful. Body is medium, and it is not missing anything in that department. Just a well-rounded IPA. Why can't I get more Stone in Jersey!?"
"Overall Impression: I got this because I’ve learned to respect Stone Brewery, and it ranked so highly on the “Top Beers” list. It took me a while to get past HOPPY, but I started to understand that this beer, with hops, hops, and more hops, wasn’t screwing my face into a, forgive me “bitter beer face”. The balance allows the entire hop flavor to come through, but backs it with enough malt to leave no edge at all. The smooth finish encourages another drink, and another, so drinkability is only slowed by the sizable alcoholic kick that creeps up on you. This is a liquid celebration of the noble hop. If this is what British soldiers got while serving in India, I think I’d sign up. While not for the faint of heart, this is a must-taste for any hop head."
"Notes: Big, delicious IPA; everything you'd expect of a Stone IPA."
"I'm getting the idea that Stone may be a good brewery. Another excellent, intense beer from those bastards. This one has an golden orange body with a medium-sized white head. Smell is ridiculously potent. I like. Strong candy toffee malts with an equally strong hoppy background. Taste is good. Malts up front, but not as sweet and toffeeish as the smell implies, with a sharp acidic hop bitterness carrying through to the finish."
"The body is generous making this beer surprising creamy on the palate, but not cloying. This IPA was so drinkable that I kick myself for not bringing another bottle back with me from my trip to the Westcoast."
"Cheers"
"Update  This is a staple in my house, so I decided to revisit my review in 04. It really is an excellent ale. I was trying to figure out what kept me from 5ing this one. I think its the lack of a good, strong, lingering finish. The flavors just seem to drop off the table. Otherwise this IPA is perfect."
"The beer pours a darker golden color. White head, but not too much of it. There is a nice citrus-pine/hop nose. Hops are fairly evident in the taste, but not as up front as some of their other brews. I was expecting more hops than I could handle, but even though they are strong, the balance is excellent. It has a crisp finish. A fine quaff!"
"Props to a Jeremy, a friend of mine, for meeting me at the lake with this, Arrogant Bastard, 1554 Black Ale, and Porch Swing (reviews pending). I can't get any of them in Oklahoma, so I have to rely on other methods. Also, he just gave them to me. Gotta love free beer. This one, bitter, full of hops, but balanced. Could definately drink again, and will, but it's not something I could drink tons of in one sitting. One is enough for one night. Overall, impressed, especially since this is my first Stone brew to try, looking forward to cracking open that Arrogant Bastard this weekend."
"I'd been looking forward to trying this beer for some time and was not disappointed. From the attractive painted bottle pours a nice semi-transparent light orange colored beer. A fairly thick (1 finger) foamy head tops off the beer and leaves some lacing on the glass throughout consumption. A fairly strong and pleasant aroma of hops is present and makes itself known during the pour. A very nice hoppy, fruity (citrus) taste, slightly milder than expected from the aroma, greets the mouth. Very smooth with a bit of an oily feel in the mouth. Overall this is a very good beer and certainly one I look forward to having again."
"Not too sweet. A bright bitterness. This is a good thing. Overall a fantastic IPA. The full hop flavor is right on but does not deaden the tastebuds. Likely to wake your mouth right up. I would like to try this on tap."
"Had this on tap at Redbones after I had a Summer IPA. Poured a cloudy tan-orange color with minimal head that left a perfect lace. Hoppy, citrus sweet smell that was very inviting. The first thing that I noticed about this beer was it's balance. Sweet, malt, hops and citrus were all perfectly blended. Each flavor came to the front when it needed to. Extremely drinkable as I could have had many more. A great beer from Stone."
"A crisp hop bitterness with top notch malt gives this IPA an excellent finish. When I'm at the Stone tasting room, this is always the best staple brew going, although everything is excellent. This is the benchmark for a good, hoppy and robust California IPA."
"The mouthfeel is very crisp and dry. This IPA goes down well with food, on a hot day or anytime you think it is drinking time. This IPA has great flavors and great drinkability. Very well done."
"The color was deep amber. Very clear and high level of carbonation. The off-white head persisted throughout the pint. The aroma was pine, pine, and more pine. It's gotta be the chinooks! The flavor is the same as the aroma - resiny pine. It left a bitter taste on my tongue that reminded me of the old Foghorn Leghorn cartoons where he painted the dogs tongue with green paint. Way too bitter for me but then again most of Stones brews are. I', glad I only bought one."
"$2.99 a bomber."
"Drinkability: I tried to be as objective as I could with this and it does have its merits. However, the over-the-top hopiness just doesn't work for me. I was still tasting it two hours later so I didn't need to drink another. I'm at a stage where I like a more balanced beer so I don't plan on getting this one again anytime soon. If you're into hops, though, this beer's for you."
"Wow. Honey colored, thick creamy white, effervescent bubbling. Smell? Wow. Sweet malt hidden beneath a comfortable thick blanket of hops. The taste is malty with a nice heavy hop finish. Mouthfeel is sweet but not cloying, and pleasantly hoppy without being bitter. Very drinkable, very enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel was nice with the tingles of carbonation and the tounge awakening hops. By the time I got to the last third of the bottle I had nothing but enjoyment from the carbonated lively mouthfeel and the malty sweetness off set nicely by the familiar crisp hops of an IPA. Good Beer!!"
"Got a good one this evening. Always a brewery to check out and see what the beers are up to."
"Brought this one back from a tiny gourmet grocery store, just down the street from the T-line in Cambridge, MA. The only beer they stocked was Stone and Concord Raspcallion. Does Todd do the ordering for this place ?"
"Damn near perfect. I will never deny my love for hops and Stone has plenty of them! Reverse cascaded into a hazy golden much like a midsummer sunset with bubbly white head and plenty of tiny bubble lace. The smell was tart and bursting with Chinook hops, honey and a faint toasted malt. But the smell was dominated by hops. The taste was the same. Huge waves of grapefruit hop bitterness rolled on the shores of my mouth leaving my taste buds in utter shock there was very little aftertaste as the nectar flowed dwn my gullet. The mouthfeel was thinly carbonated and syrupy, more to my likeing. This stands as one of the better IPAs I have had, and that is not just because this is Stone, but because it is damn near the definition of a west coast IPA."
"22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a clear orange-amber color with 2 fingers of head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is rich floral hops, maybe chinook, with some citrus. The taste is very well balanced, with sweet malt up against fruity hops. The hops are not overwhelming at all. The mouthfeel is fairly nice, just a little carbonated. The drinkability is extremely good. This must be Ruination's little brother."
"An outstanding American IPA. Lots of hop flavor and good bitterness. Stone doesn't use the Cascade hops like many American IPA's use. Not sure what they use but it gives it a unique taste. If you are a hophead you will love this beer. Also available in bottles but draft is outstanding. Strong but not overdone."
"This now ranks as 1 or 2 on my IPA list...mmmm...good stuff"
"** 7-8-03** This beer is still awe inspiring. One of my favorties. Greg is a Beer God**"
"I agree with most of these reviews, Wow!! I think this is the best IPA i've had to date. Im not one to seek out this style just for the hops and abv. I found this to be so well balanced and easy to drink, I beleave I found my new home stocker of this style. It pours a cloudy orange amber with a one & half inch white head. Lace is very good and sticks all glass long. The taste is hoppy yes, but not over bitter, but rather smooth. Stone takes thier time in the brewing process, and it shows. From the first aroma of floral citrus hop to the mouth that is left alittle tart, but not dry. Wow, a very drinkable IPA to be had."
"Nice golden color upon pouring this beer- the creamy white head has tight little bubbles that stay untilt the last drop. A clear hop aroma emerges as soon as I poured it. A nice strong bitter punch hits you as first, just to let you know there is an abundance of hops here. Citrus like flavors are balanced well with a slightly sweet malt and candy like flavors- but only for a moment. This beer is all about hops, but it backs off just enough to make this a great beer to drink anytime. Goes extremely well with spicey foods."
"The Stone IPA pours with a vibrant orange color, which is slightly clouded in appearance. the thick foamy white head leaves a thick, clinging lace around the glass. The first smell immediately presents a sharp hoppy scent surrounded by soy and citrus rind, with an underpinning of apples, pine and malt. The mouthfeel is smooth, although contrasted by the play of carbonation on the middle of the tongue. The taste is subtle, while not at all lacking. Starting with a fruity maltness, it builds to a hoppy bitter within about 5 seconds, with some citrus hints lingering. It blends to a bitter hoppy aftertaste which makes one want to eat something salty, which of course makes you want to drink more. This, of course, is always good. I put this ale high on my list."
"WoW. This is one amazing beer. I had been waiting for a while for more Stone brews to come to Texas, and got very excited when I saw the IPA at the store, sadly there was only one bottle left. The beer pours a nice golden color with a white foamy head. The beer is very bubbly and makes it quite nice to look at after it is poured. The smell of the beer is great, very very hoppy, with a fruit smell, possibly grapefruit. With the first taste the hops hit you like a hammer, then the fruit kicks in, all of the flavors meld terrific.The beer is dry yet wet at the same time, making this one great beer for hot weather. This goes on my list as one of my top beers. Hopefully more Stone brews become available here soon."
"MmmStone IPA This was the first non-Arrogant Bastard Stone beer I tried. I bought a boat load of Stone on a trip to Arizona, and drank the IPA first for two reasonsI expected it to pale in comparison with the likes of Old Gaurdian and Ruination and because at the time (March 2003) it was due to be available in Texas within days. Well, its mid-June and IPA is finally here! Anyway, Im sorry I so under-estimated this beer, because it might just be my favorite Stone. The brilliant, clear gold body sports a stylishly-contrasted white, creamy head and a massive aroma of fruity PacNW hops OTHER than Cascades. The nose isnt one-dimensional either, just like the beer itself. Under the fresh, floral, green hoppiness is a touch of earthy maltiness and a soft, fruity sweetness. The flavor is identical, with the bitterness being far from assertive, allowing the hops to be flavorful, not astringent. The pale maltiness shows even more of the fruitiness in the flavor than it did in the nose. The velvety smooth fruitiness glides effortlessly past the initial hop smack and doesnt end until a touch of alcoholic warmth reminds me that this is almost 7% ABV. How a beer thats this hoppy can maintain this kind of balance and still be as quintessential an example of an American IPA as Ive tried, I honestly dont know. Masterful brewing, simply masterful."
"I can taste a malt foundation with a tremendous hoppy body. The floral-citrus bitterness dominates to be sure, but there is far more flavor than you'd think. Although I am not a huge fan of overly hoppy beers, I believe I could have more than one of these. An amazing thing that I never would have guessed."
"I had to wait a while to get my hands on this ale; then, lo and behold, I go into Half Time Beverages in Poughkeepsie, NY (see beerfly reviews--this place is awesome!) and not only can I pick up bottles of this, it's also on tap. So I get a six-pack and a growler--I mean why not? Right now, I'm reviewing the bottled one, though they're not too different (a better mouthfeel from the tap, I think). Anyway, this pours a medium gold with a noticeable off-white head that left a modest intricate lace. The smell was complex--hops for sure, but balanced by just the slightest citrus and some sweetness, but I could not figure out from what. I was intrigued. The first taste was brash, good and powerful hops, but it mellowed quickly, too quickly even, as the finish I thought was nondescript. Nevertheless this has a pleasant, light mouthfeel (on tap there seemed to be just a bit more body). Very drinkable for an ale with such high alcohol content, so be cautious."
"This beer is very drinkable and hides it's 7% abv very well. I can't wait to get another bottle."
"Stone keeps making great beers, and next to the Bastard, this is probably my favorite of the beers they've made. Stone has created one of the truly great American IPAs."
"My second Stone experience, the IPA is a different beast than the Bastard, but just as respectable. I've been spoiled, and it's going to be tough to go back!"
"Hop head heaven. This beer had more hop flavors than any other IPA I have tasted. To start it poored a nice deep amber coloer and had a nice rich head. From the first sip you get a srucy, and piney and bitter hop taste. Oh yeah there is substantial malt backbone here to even off. This beer for me not being a true hop head yet but enjoying more and more powerful IPA's, started off bitter but by the end i thought it was great and was sad to see the bottle empty. I will have this one again when I can get it."
"Happy Drinking!"
"This is a great beer. I am new to stone brewing company ( i got my first 6 pack yesterday), but this beer was impressive. it is a hazy light orange color with a substantial not quite white head. the smell is awesome, something like citrusy freshly cut grass. the taste had a slight carmel nut malt flavor, that balances more than it first seems. hops dominate the middle and end coating your mouth with a big resinous spicy grapefruit flavor. Medium bodied, with a drinkabilty that, in my opinon is very high. i noticed it was very smooth for a bottled beer. a very, very good IPA."
"It's hop time. This hop monster looks great in a pint glass, and I'm glad that the bottle will top it off for a little while longer, I love the looks of this one: very orange in color with big,puffy foamy top that sticks around for the ride. The bouquet is citrus and flowers, many different kinds, with a good amount of malt in the backround. The flavor follows the nose's lead with a good dose of malt balanced nicely with a floral,citrus hop flavor. A very complex hoppiness about it, the malt could use a bit of complexity, but hey , that's what the Arrogant is about. The texture is nectar-like, which I love but may be thick and chewy for some. A great beer for the hop fix!"
"Poured a really nice peach color with small but rocky head that stuck to the glass,wow the smell,first whiff is freshly mowed grass it hits ur nasal passages like a freight train.Very citruisy taste hits u first but the maltiness in the background really balances this out nicely.Iam sometimes leery about getting west coast IPA's but this one is nicely balanced.Stone has to be a world renown brewery by now their beers are just so world class."
"This is another world class beer from Stone. Take it out of the fridge, let it sit on the counter for ten minutes or so before opening it, then lavish yourself in the beautiful floral aroma of hops. It's readily available in six packs in my area, so I'm spoiled. It has the hoppy, citrusy flavors one would expect from a west coast IPA. I've used this beer on four occassions to introduce a BMC type to real beer. Each time was successful."
"If these excellent ales were available in my area, you can be sure that my fridge would be stocked well with these! Tasty, and drinkable, and rewarding!"
"Pours a creamy, white head, that's uneven and thick and provides excellent lacing. The beer itself is a nice golden color. The aroma is strongly hoppy, and it tastes much the same. The mouthfeel is a little odd: somwhat cakey and off. It stils feels good on the palate, and is very drinkable. This is a very strong and imposing beer."
"Most drinkable IPA I ever had..very good indeed."
"If I could afford a case of this stuff at $3.79 a bottle, this would be my summer drink of choice and share a special place of honor next to the assortment of hefe weizens that crowd the beerarator when the thermostat gets over 90, usually beginning in March."
"Nice IPA but with the high ratings over this one I expected something more than exceptional. Has a nice marriage of malt/hop flavor and only a slight bitterness compared to most other IPA's I've had over the years. I still think the Alesmith beats this one though. I will definately drink it again, but there are many just as good as this one and better."
"Pours out a beautiful amber with a nice white head. I don't like this quite as much as ruination, but it is still an awesome ipa! The hops pack the punch here, but the grain taste adds its charm too. Sooo smooth and so creamy. Feels so good. Tastes so good. A nice big stone IPA for all of us!"
"Drinkability: Pretty good for the style. Believe it or not, I expected this brew to be bigger and with more hops... I much prefer their Ruination IPA to this. Still a damn good IPA though..."
"Although this is a wonderful beer,this is certainly not the best Stone has to offer. Then again, at the time of this review there are 5 stone beers in the top 50 so that's not really that negative of a comment. It's a golen color with a large white head. The aroma and taste is all hops. No surprise there. In my opinion, this isn't top 50 material. I always expect something big from Stone, but this is just simply a solid IPA."
"Hoppy, hoppy, joy, joy."
"I felt like I was strolling along a hop field when I pour this beer and got a hint of the aroma. Hops, hops, hops, the floral bouquet of the hops are awesome!! The beer looks great as well, a good head on top of the golden brew with a slight cloudiness. Oh man, the taste is gooood. The character of the hops just taste fresh and citrus aftertaste with a feeling of hops blossomming on the roof of my mouth. The citrus and floral tones feel like a slight burn but a good one. The beer is very drinkable and a great IPA."
"Outstanding! This brew and SN Celebration are my two favorite IPAs. It pours a light amber in the glass with a thin white head. The aroma is very complex, heavenly! Citrus, pine, grapefruit, and sweet malt wonderfully intermingled. You'd swear you're standing in a Washington hop field during harvest. Layer after layer of hops flavors dominate the taste. Pineapple and grapefruit seem dominant; citrus, pine, and spice mingle in the background. There's a nice malty backbone to this brew as well. Lightly sweet and bready, like hawaiian sweet bread. Hops nirvana in a bottle!"
"This is absolutely outstanding. The malty balance puts it ahead of Ruination for me."
"Thanks to NeroFiddled for the 2 bottles!!"
"(22 oz. bottle / $3.77)"
"Full bodied, nicely carbonated, and very drinkable for the true hophead. I can't wait to try the Ruination. Thanks again Gusler for the great sampler pack."
"The head on this IPA pours a little thin. The nose is amazing. There is a pineapple hint and an overall fruitiness to the aroma. The first taste is very floral and hoppy. There is a wonderful hop presence throughout the beer. The is an ever so slight dryness to the beer but overall it is quite complex. As you move to the middle of the beer you notice quite a lacing on the glass as well as a sweet maltiness holding its own. There is a good amount of carbonation in this beer and it has some refreshing characteristics that would make it great on a hot summer day. The alcohol content is rather high but the beer doesn't seem to taste high in alcohol. The beer finishes smoothly and has a nice, floral hoppy aftertaste. Well done, Stone!"
"Light amber pour, with a thick white head that laces very nicely. First pour from the bomber had some large carb bubbles that trickled to the top pretty quickly. Aroma had a strong pine smell to it, like sniffing a freshly fallen pine cone. Taste followed the smell quite nicely, with lots of hops and a long trailing aftertaste."
"The cask conditioning took away the salty tastes, made the sour more complex (yeah for the magic of wood), and rounded all the other flavors and scents together. This casking brought the classic IPA characteristics to an astounding height and smoother blend, and turned my highly unfavorable view of IPAs around. This beer floored me like none other - this is what happens when you take a top (the top?) IPA and cask condition (oooh, aaah) it. BRAVO."
"Pours a reddish amber color with a frothy white head that fades into a very sticky and clingy lace. Nose is dominated by strong floral hops with some underlying notes of fresh grains and Juicy Fruit bubblegum. Very smooth and creamy and while bitter hops are the key players here, they arent overpowering. In fact, the taste initially is sweet bready malts and lots of fruit that gives way to some notes of pine and raw hop leaf flavors that remain in the aftertaste. This is one damn fine IPA. Im very happy to see this beer finally for sale here in the Dallas area, and Im sure it will be a frequent purchase of mine. I cant wait to cellar a few bottles to see how they develop."
"A nice representation of the style. This shiny copper IPA is loaded with fresh whole hop flavors. The aroma is almost totally floral hop based. The medium/rich malt body doesn't provide much competition for the hops, but it plays a nice supporting role, while offering a trace herbal, earthy character. Full grapefruity, pine and citrus bitterness lasts. Lightly sweet with some noticeable alcohol kick that melds seamlessly with the hops. Lasting White Head and nice sticky lace."
"Bottom Line: As Goldilocks said after trying the Pale Ale and Ruination, “This is juuust right!”"
"F."
"The color is the pleasant and appetizing golden amber that is common for many IPAs. The carbonation level was just about right to produce a good level of head after a slightly vigorous pour, and lace remained for quite a while. The smell was pure hops. There may have been more complex smells there as well, but I was too happy inhaling the hops aroma to notice. The taste was mostly hoppy with a bit of sweet malt to balance. The taste buds were awakened nicely by the hop bitterness, yet it all finished very smoothly. Overall this is a very good IPA, and if you are a hophead you will love it. Considering this is just Stone's regular IPA, I can't imagine what their Ruination IPA is like, but I can't wait to try it."
"Magnifcant, how do they do it? Stone just knows how to make amazing beers that's all they make. I have never tasted one of their brews that I wasn't satisfied with. Pours a lucious copper tone with a screen of haze over it. My two finger head on the is a great complement of white clouds, and the retention is good here with lace already lining my glass I am ready to hop in. The hops are diffusing through the air coming for me like a trained asassin. Huge hop aroma with earthy tones I love it, some citrus and floral scents also intrigue my senses. First sip I love it, I am going to say right now this is my favorite all around IPA!!!! Yes, it's that good with the hops consuming most of my palate, the malt sweetness comes to save me from making a bitter beer face instantly forming a smile on my face. The hop resins make the mouthfeel a bit oily, but in a good way lubricating my palate to partake in one hell of a beer. Medium to light rediculously drinkable in every way imaginable. No off flavors only a hop head's dream beer is sitting in my pint glass right now."
"At 6.9 % abv. this one will sneak up on you. Overall, I very tasty brew, but I prefer Hop Devil to this."
"Well, I'm not a hophead, but you've got to give it's due; this is an impressive brew. The color is a cloudy, peachy amber; pretty. No head on this to speak of; light lacing. The aroma is complex as it immediately screams citrus, yet has buttery caramel underneath. The taste is a rush of hops with a strong start and a longlasting, pleasant bitterness to finish. Flowery overall sense. This grows on you, but slowly."
"Appearance: Pours a rich golden peach color with a fluffy, creamy, sticky white foam lace; with very good retention. Decent carbonation. On the nose the aroma of raw hops, and a hint of fruity esters. On the palate there is an intense hop assault on taste buds, sharp bitterness, light biscuit and grain flavor, light malt sweetness, pear, sour apple; fruity esters, and pine. Body is medium. Mouth feel is crisp, sharp/bitter, and smooth. A very good IPA... a hopheads delight."
"A hazy orange color that is just a shade too light for me, IMO, for an IPA. Great head, lasting and lacing through the bottom of the glass. Sweet citrus hop smell, slight alcohol, and a little hop aroma, to say the least. Hops lead off the first taste, mellow malts, and sweet, oily hops. Very nice, not overwhealming. Spicey, short and crisp mouthfeel and aftertaste, very nice and very drinkable. Stone is now my favorite West Coast brewery!"
"It might have been partly due to the lack of moisture in my mouth, but this made for an excellent sipping beer. I wasn't in any hurry while I enjoyed this. I'm actually starting to salvate again right now. What time do they open?"
"Another fine offering by the venerable Stone Brewing Company. Orange color with a big thick frothy head. Citrusy smell of hops with a little yeast background. Nicely structured with a medium bodied, creamy texture. Good strong hop flavor which is what I expect from a Stone brew. This is an American Pale Ale standard along with Burning River, Avery, Three Floyds, Hop Devil and other strongly hopped, refreshing and delicious examples of the style. A very drinkable beer."
"What a bold beer! Right from the get go I knew I would enjoy this one. It poured a light amber color with a great fluffy white head. The aroma of citrus and spice was in full force and smelled absolutly wonderful. To say this beer is hoppy would be an understatement...it is VERY hoppy. But this is a good thing because it is still very smoothe. Mouthfeel was perfect, and the taste was great. It had a bit of a pine taste at the beginning, then as it hit my tounge it flavors opened up and revealed a very spicy flavor, and finished with a little alchohol warmth. This reminded me a lot of Arrogant Bastard, but with more of a spicy flavor. This is a great beer and now they make it in six packs....awesome!!"
"Overall an excellent IPA. Hoppy, smooth, an alcohol punch, and pleasant in the mouth. I only wish that it had a wee bit more malt in its flavor profile. But hey, that's being very picky."
"Stone brews up some of the boldest beers in existance... their IPA is no exception. Pours a crystal clear light copper, with a thin but persistent white head that leaves a fair amount of lace behind. Aroma is all about the hops... pine, citrus, and just a touch of toasted malt. The flavor is bold and balanced... grapefruit and pine hit you over the head, then once you regain your senses, you notice a nice toasted malt profile that lasts for what seems like milliseconds, then you notice the wondefully bitter finish. Not a single flavor is out of proportion. The moutfeel is very smooth and creamy with a medium body. With this beer, I can honestly say I've crossed over... I'm now officially a hop head."
"I can't wait to try the other Stone beers I recently purchased. With an arrogant bastard, double bastard, and ruination IPA waiting to be consumed, I may be bitter the rest of this year."
"If it weren't so expensive I think I could just drink this IPA and be completely satisfied."
"If you've been to D's in Pittsburgh a couple times Im sure you've met Mike, hes a regular there and he recommended this to me early tonight. This IPA gives an exceptionally strong floral fragerance with a hint of citrusy scents. Head is white, fluffy, and disapates rather quickly. Its color is lighter than that of other AIPA's such as HopDevil. Flavor is very hoppy. First sip just smacks your face with the taste of hops and lingers throughout the bottle. Very hoppy beer. Taste is slightly bitter but very pleasant and tasty. A hophead's beer...Im gonna have to try arrogant bastard soon, which was characterized to me as 'similar to this but on steriods'"
"Fluffy on the palate. Perfect carbonation here. Intense flavors of sheep's milk ricotta, lemon, egg pastries, heavily toasted, and graphite dust...maybe even a little charcoal. Edgy, forward and commanding. Good entertaining beer. True to its genre. Maybe one of the best."
"This beer goes exceptionally well with shrimp and spicy cocktail sauce."
"Poured a light amber gold color.Wasn't much of a head,but left trace amounts of lace.Head dissolved quick to almost nothing.Has an immediate hop smell.Taste of hops is unmistakable and hefty.A medium body with an unusual high ABV for an IPA.The finish is very bitter with no presence of an alcohol taste.Leaves a dry feeling on the mouth.You'll be burping up hops for awhile with this brew."
"Clear orange-amber brew with a few lazy trails of C02. Nice, thick white head. Head fades a bit quickly, but leaves plenty of lace on the glass, and atop the beer. Smell of piny-grapefruity hops is strong. I didn't notice any malt in the aroma. Taste is a wonderful bitter hop bit, citrusy and herbal with a bit of caramel malt to keep it from being 2-Dimensional."
"12 oz bottle, light orange -copper color with a white frothy head, nice lacing. Clean citrus-pine aroma, medium body malty with a strong hop profile, nice balance, One hell of an IPA."
"Mmm... hops. This IPA pours a golden copper color with excellent clarity and a frothy, off-white head which holds up well. Nose is dominated by citric, floral hops. With 60 IBUs, the taste is big on hops, as well, with some nice malt support. Not overpowering, but rather fairly well balanced with a definite nod to the hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is smooth overall, and is fairly easy to drink for a brew of its ABV. Stone produces an upper-tier American IPA with this one."
"Poured a nice golden color with a good head. The first sip signalled what was to come as the taste of hops filled my mouth. Not extremely bitter, but pleasantly biting. The ABV could be felt as I continued to consume. Quite a pleasant IPA, and I will be buying more in the future."
"This is really a unique IPA. Pours out beautifully with a nice white head and golden yellow body. I expected more hop aroma but it was there along with a buttery malt nose. Light bodied while going down but the aftertaste is buttery with caramel, butterscotch, and vanilla flavors dominating. A cedery hop flavor is there and the bitterness complements the malt very well but does not overwhelm. When this beer warms it takes on belgian ale qualities which I am guessing comes from the type of yeast they use. A very fine IPA."
"This is a top notch IPA. Aggressively hopped. A wonderful hop aroma abounds. Very good flavor with the hops dominating, yet very drinkable and not too bitter. If you're a hop-head you need to find this one."
"Light copper in color with a smallish white head. Hop aromas of pine and citrus fill the nose. Light carbonation. The hops bite you right away and don't let go, although there is some toasted malt flavor to keep the hops from completely having their way. I haven't tasted many American IPAs that were better than this one."
"Notes: Simply put ... this is one insane IPA, and not for the weak palate. To compare it to other IPAs would be silly, however I think this sums it up ... Once Stone comes into a new market it's like a challenge to other brewers in the area: ""I know my big beers are bigger and better than yours, but let's see yours anyway. I promise not to laugh."" Oh ... and this is just their standard IPA doing the speaking."
"The nose says all hops the taste says big, grainy, caramel malt underlying the big time Pacific Northwest hop profile. The hops are so flavorful, bitterness doesn't really come to mind. The citric, piney adjectives don't seem to capture all the different complexities available in this brew. Anyone who loves hops and thinks they've had it all should try this beer."
"I am beginning to have the utmost respect & highest regard for Stone. I have limited experience of US Brewers, but if there are better ones out there I cant wait to try them!"
"The body is a hazy deep peach in color, topped by a frothy white head that holds well and leaves some excellent ""sticky"" lace. The aroma is of a fruity, sweet (almost sugary) malt, and bold floral & citrus hops (that combine with the sweetness to offer alot of pineapple - but also some lemon). The body is medium/full with a very fine, moderate carbonation that gives a light zest on the tongue and then becomes quite creamy in the mouth. The flavor offers a blend of rich, sweet, fruity, and lightly caramel & bready malt, and loads of citrusy, floral, piney & grassy hops backed by a solid bitterness. It finishes with a lingering combination of sweet floral malt flavor and dry bitterness. Although the bitterness is hefty, it's not overwhelming, and the sweet malt remains evident throughout the glass. The alcohol is beautifully cloaked, revealing only a light touch of ""spiciness"" in the flavor. This is a really unique and exceptional beer that's well worth seeking out. Well brewed. Outstanding."
"Stone IPA: Not Ruination, but rather Stone’s everyday IPA, bought in a six pack.  Very nice amber color, with a very thick sticky head.  The aroma was hops, the taste was a mildly pleasant hops tingle and the aftertaste was a very nice hops, with a slight residue of hops oils.  Very nice, with a decent alcohol warmth as well.  Very nice example of an IPA."
"I guess this is Stone's IPA light when compared to the Ruination IPA, but don't think this is anything light. Stone's IPA also has a strong hop pressence in it's taste. The appearence is a bit cloudy, yet still has that copperish ale look to it. The hop pressence is obvious in the aroma, so don't say you were not warned when you drink it. This is a good beer by Stone, although, I'm a bit confused as to why they would have 2 full-time IPA's on the market...not unless this is the budget version when compared to the Ruination."
"Pours a big, impressive froth that almost refuses to settle (which, of course, is a good thing). Leaves nearly enough lace to make it look like it didn't even settle! Copper to orange color. Absolutely beautiful hoppy aroma. Tons of floral and citrus character. In fact, it jumps out at you before you even finish opening the bottle. More citrus-like hop bitterness in the flavor, with some hints of spiciness and great malty undertones. Hops make it very smooth and crisp, and the bread-like maltiness underneath rounds it out quite well. Great balance of bitterness and sweetness as well. Dangerously drinkable! This is one wonderful brew. I'm loving every Stone brew I try with a passion! If you're just starting to love hops, this is a great step up from their pale ale if you're not quite ready for ""ruination"". And for the seasoned hophead, this is a wonderful treat and an exceptional brew all around! No matter who you are, try this! It will not fail to impress."
"Slightly hazy golden - hue topped by a thick, heterogenous head that leaves lace.  Aromatic citrus rind and pine hop nose perhaps from a Cascade / Chinook combination.  Malt aroma is subdued, and only a light caramel sweetness can be discerned.  The clean, but sharp hop bitterness upfront gives slowly gives way to honey - like sweetness and light bready grain, but hops nonetheless dominate overall.  Hop flavor is wonderfully all American, being comprised of pine, grapefruit & even a hint of lemon.  Although secondary to the hop profile, there's sufficient malt foundation to keep this AIPA from being one - dimensional.  Finishes pleasantly bitter.  A definitive American IPA.  Hops dominate, but they aren't overbearing or astringent.  Surprisingly ""balanced"" for a brew by Stone.  Reminescent of Ruination IPA ""light.""  Stone IPA is well crafted and very tasty."
"Thank you very much, Bighuge.  This was worth the 250 mile trip in itself"
"Some beers are big, but this one is gigantic.  Pushes the hops envelope with gusto!  Fantastic aroma of grapefruit with a tinge of sweetness (pink grapefruit/tangerine?)  Hops stake a claim in the flavor right from the start, but then back off just enough to let the malt shine through, then the hops settle back in for a slow, bitter finish.  Not over the top with hops, but teetering on the edge.  An outstanding IPA."
"Smell is unbelievable...fresh and spicy with some floral notes...the incredibly complex aroma of this beer is definitely a highlight of it..I could smell this damn thing all night without taking a sip..Taste is very goo..Definitely leans to the bitter side quite heavily, but there is a good malt backbone with some soft caramel undetones...strong bitterness on the long finish...taste doesn't quite match the smell but still very good overall.."
"I probably should have drank this first. It seems almost boring after the Ruination. Less floral than Ruination, with an intense smell of a christmas tree sap. Smell almost gives me a headache. Stone makes pretty beers and this is one of them. Good head with nice retention, good color. Flavor is surpisingly malty, nutty. Hops strong from the beginning and very short finish."
"258"
"The appearance is a deep golden with orange tinting.  A slight bubbly off-white head.  Nice lace patterns develop on the sides of the glass as I drink.  Citros, lemon rind, grafefruit and slight pine on the nose.  This is a very balanced IPA in taste.  the hops do not overwhelm, but rather, they are firm in their presence.  The hop-attributed tastes are lemon rind, citrus and pine.  There's some nice bitterness, but not quite enough for my liking.  Very quaffable IPA."
"Nice gold color, white thick head, and great solid lacing. First sip was very hoppy and refreshing. Piney, grapefruit aroma. One note of interst was near the bottom of the glass the hops were gone. good solid IPA though not spectacular."
"This beer poured out a nice copperish gold color and formed a nice fairly white head, that when subsiding, left some nice lace. Aroma had elements of hops and some citrus. The taste had a substantial amount of hops and slightly bitter aspect to it, which is good in an IPA. Good beer"
"Nice medium bodied highly hopped for flavor and bitterness.  Nice malt balance and very conducive to repeated consumption."
"As someone else said, this one is about the hops.  Apart from the hops, however, I found the flavor a bit on the bland side.  Nothing about this beer set it apart for me."
"Clearly what we have here is a West Coast IPA. That's a good thing if you're a hophead (which I am...I think). But seriously folks, this is good stuff. Hazy orangish/peach color with beautiful rocky off white head when poured from the 22oz. bomber into my favorite 20oz. pint glass. Big hop aroma. Big citrusy hop flavor that turns a bit milder when it warms (it was a challenge to let this warm as I wanted badly to quaff it down).  Some malt just peeks through and teases but is shut down by more fruity/estery citrus hop flavors. During any session, start with something less aggressive hop wise and work up to this, cause once you're here there's no going back."
"Old 2001 Review: Possibly the perfect west coast style IPA. Bursting at th e seams with everything you want in an IPA - Hops, malt and alcohol. All of it balanced really well with the hops winning out in the end. could drink this for days. Go Stone!"
"Heavy aromas of flowers, citrus fruit, and wild hops.  The carbonation bubbles ever so slowly float to the top of the glass.  Carries flowery notes as well as sweet malts, but the hops bitterness dominates the palate.  So smooth and creamy and filling!  A fantastic I.P.A.  Would expect no less from Stone Brewery."
"Notes: Wow now this is an IPA! Well attenuated and very bitter, yet still a little malt character to balance. Seriously ... if you don't like hoppy beers than this one might not be a good pick. If you are a hophead ... than buy a case! There was only one thing this beer said to me ""Don't be a whimp, drink a hoppy beer!"" Also this a quite deceiving brew topping out at 6.9% abv."
