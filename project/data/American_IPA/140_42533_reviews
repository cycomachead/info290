"Man... missed out by not having a smart phone for this one. Guy at the bottle shop told me that these were just in. Broke my cardinal rule of checking dates on IPAs... however, I guess that this one is still within the acceptable window (107 days since bottled)... I guess you always wonder what could have been. In his defense, I haven't seen it there, so... Anyways, here goes. Poured from a bomber ($7.99) into my snifter. Rich amber hue with a small head (lacing galore) with a unique lemon meringue hue. Really had to work for the aroma, and was able to detect some hints of citrus, almost like lemon peel, and a bit of booze as well. Crisp bitterness on the taste, nice clean (Sierra Nevada style) aftertaste. Would have to imagine that some of the hop flavor has faded. Great, continual carbonation and a nice light mouthfeel. Excellent after 4 hours in the yard, quite refreshing. Overall, there were some unique aromas and flavors going on, and I think that I will definitely want to try this around May next year."

"Picked up a growler, poured into a nonic pint. The nose is pretty malty, fair amount of citrus. Clear amber-orange. Good amount of head, and a TON of lacing, the glass is coated. The flavor is outstanding...citrus, floral, and pine. Good good, love these from SN every season."
"O - Can I say I love this beer! I had it on tap at a local bar and it grabbed my attention like no other beer that I have had thus far. I enjoyed it so much, I went on a wild goose chase looking for it at all the local beer stores with no avail, I asked a beer store if they would get it on the next shipment and sure enough it came in! I will be picking more of this up, that is for sure. The beer has so much to offer, and yet it is so smooth with a perfect blend of flavors and aromas. Its balance has no offensive flavors to speak of. If you want an excellent fresh hop ale look no further, this is a must get cheers!"

"O: Even without being super-fresh, this beer was highly enjoyable and offered a wonderful, although contained, bouquet of hop flavors. Some caramel and pale malts offer just a hint of bready sweetness that keep this balanced and palatable. The mouthfeel was superb and kept this extremely drinkable. Cheers to Sierra Nevada for another great offering."

"O: I should have had this the day I bought it. It would have had more hops for sure. Overall a must try for IPA lovers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great brew. Lot's of interesting flavors and really well balanced. Just not sure it's worth the $7.99. But I could see picking this up again."

"Overall, a good IPA but nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""

""

""
""
"in both the smell and taste; much more than what the ABV hints. Also, I think I'm getting some malt as well as citrus rinds from the taste. Total package, this is a great brew. I would definitely get it again. For whatever reason, I'm having trouble describing it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good, but not great. Better than most IPAs out there, but I prefer both SN Pale and Torpedo to this one."

"Amber in color with lots of thick white head. Smell is very subtle to start, but floral and citrus come out more as it warms. Flavor is led by pine hoods, but also has a nice make background. Overall lacking a bit on the aroma, but the taste is spot on."
"Even though I split this with a friend, I could have polished this off by myself. While not a session beer, this felt like one from start to finish and I'll probably give it a go in the near future. Different from it's northern hemisphere counterparts, any fan of IPA or Sierra Nevada or even the ""Enjoy by"" from Stone will love what they've done here. This went down so easily and had a great balance to it, which is something that I don't feel is the case with many IPA's. This stood out for all the right reasons!"
""
"Overall this is a lackluster IPA; not what I am used to from Sierra Nevada. Perhaps these Southern Hemisphere hops are not the way to go."
""
""
""
"Frothy pour down the middle trying to stir aromatics which are sadly lacking for style, of course never tried New Zealand hops before. Orange amber with cloudy activity, yeast or hops. Medium body, excellent carbonation. Fresh hops have a whole other flavorless bite & smooth. Sure some serious time & energy went into brewing this series which begs further exploration."

"BOD 4/24/14. Pours a clear medium amber with a moderate dark ruby cast. Massive head with superb lacing and retention. Moderate nose of citrus and pine hops over a light sweet caramel background. Almost medium bodied with a smooth texture. Slightly below average carbonation with very little effervescence on the finish. A very unique flavor profile that is complex and well balanced. Less bitter than it's Northern counterpart, this variant focuses more on hop flavor. It begins with a blend of citrus and pine, then flows into a bit of dankcentric with a spicy counterpart. Throughout all of this, a slight caramel sweetness is noted in the background. The finish is a bit dry which leaves a touch of sweet bitterness. An outstanding ale!"
""
""
""
""
"The aftertaste is serious - you know you are drinking a real, almost big beer. This is a nice treat that you should seek out. I look forward to a second glass a little later today."

"24 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/24/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep orange copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, lime, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good complexity and balance of citrus/floral hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, lime, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, lime, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a crisp malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice fresh hop IPA. All around good complexity and balance of bright citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to drink. It is not as bold as most IPAs, but is still a very enjoyable offering overall."

"2014 version is yet another let down in this new format of the series. This thing is packed with malt. Burnt caramels, weird soapiness. The hops are barely here. I just dont get it. Two years ago I remember this thing blowing me away."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is the second beer in this series being released this year and it is the second disappointment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great color, orange-amber, pretty clear. Smell is light vegetal hops, and Sierra Nevada yeast. Taste is spicy; lemon and sticky caramel malt. Very bitter and it finishes with a peppery tingle."
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't seem to get much out of Sierra Nevada's standard IPAs or brews, but their Hoptimum and Bigfoot are amazing. BA Narwhal is also great but unavailable. However, I can't wait for the Beer Camp."
""
""
""
""

"These fresh hop Hemisphere beers are very interesting and offer really unique flavor profiles compared to most IPAs on the market."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty tropical ipa"
""
"O: enjoyable, but not especially memorable;"
""
""
"Overall - perhaps I've been brainwashed by SN, as I seem to love everything that they brew; or perhaps they just have a great thing going!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very enjoyable IPA from Sierra Nevada. Like other beers from SN a good beer for a good price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good Fresh Hop IPA. Good mix of hop flavors with a solid malt backing."
"O- haven't had a SN fresh hop that wasn't of very high quality and this one follows suit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A well-balanced, drinkable, and interesting IPA. Great stuff."
"Note: This beer is a Fresh Hop ale with dried hops shipped from NZ within 7 days of harvest. The company makes a distinction on their website between fresh and wet hops: ""Wet Hops are un-dried hops, picked and shipped from the growing fields within 24 hours. Fresh Hops are the freshest dried hops to come from the fields, typically within seven days of harvest."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good example of an IPA. Smooth drinking, great hops flavor that keeps you anticipating the next sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Extremely drinkable. Fresh citrus hop notes with a good malt back as well. Quality that I have come to expect from this series of Harvest ales by SN."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, decent IPA, not great, does a good job of showing off the fruity New Zealand hops, but a little too sweet for me."
"Sierra Nevada does no wrong."
""
""
""
"Over all: I like it. It's fresh, hoppy, and big. I tried last years and thought it was great but it had aged past the 100 day s mark. This clearly says drink within 100 days. It is good and I would surely bang another one, but against SN's wishes I might hold on to another one and hold it back a few months to even out the sugar."
""
""
""
""
"This is a good IPA that clearly showcases Southern Hemisphere hop varietals. It doesn't do much outstandingly well, but everything comes together in a nice overall beer. Refreshing, but for such a limited, seasonal release, I'd prefer a bigger, bolder IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: I was not hot on this one when it first opened. It seemed like yet another Sierra Nevada beer, with lots of forest quality. Yeah, that's a great set of flavors, but Sierra Nevada imparts them in all their IPA's, it seems (kinda like the nutiness from New Belgium). However, as this one warmed, it became incredibly good. The incredibly aromatic and spicy New Zealand hops really worked well with the generous malting, creating and awesome boquet of flavors. If this beer could find a way to incorporate the amazingly fruity charactersitics of the hops with a more subdued malt billing, this beer would be almost perfect."
""
""
""
""
"This was a pretty good beer. I have to say I was slightly disappointed, though, but I’d still have it again for sure."
""
"Another excellent offering from SN. They can do no wrong."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - great normal ipa."
""
""
""
"O: Not a terribly complex beer. But that's okay for this brew, because going in this is a hopped up brew and on that...it delivers with a purpose. This is a nice brew to sit back and enjoy on a mild spring day. The hops used impart a very spring like character and make this a really neat beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: The aroma is definitely more NZ hoppy than the flavor, which makes the flavor a bit disappointing. Recommended, though I wish it had more of a NZ hop character in all respects."

"Atmosphere is really nice. Dark hue, persistent head, and thick persistent lacing. Nose is fresh hops and hay accentuated with a little lemon citrus. Pure hops... not much else. Crisp and pure. Overall, this is a really good quaff."

"O: Very happy with this beer, there was no bitterness or wood but plenty of floral and citrus. A great combo!"
"Appearance is copper in color with a finger of off-white head that left nice lacing behind. There is a heavier dose of malt than in most West-coast IPAs, but the hops remain the feature of this show. This is almost as tasty as its cousin the Northern Hemisphere version."
"O: A definite go to. I wish they sold these in six or twelve packs. Definitely a fresh hop forward ale. The unsung hero is the quality malt which buttresses the hops profile. Thank you SNBC!"

"O - The gorgeous label of Sierra Nevada's Southern Hemisphere Harvest sets the tone of this sophisticated and complex wet-hop IPA, begging for attention through careful consideration. It's fresh hops do the same with undercurrents of sweet caramel dribbled over pineapple and honeydew melon with a bouquet of delicate floral notes throughout. Bitter but balanced, this IPA is appealing across the board - another hoppy Sierra Nevada success!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer if you like hoppy and bitter IPAs. Could use a bit more balance but I enjoyed it."
"Was a good change, not sure I'd grab another."

"The twenty thirteen brew, having been released in summer it has sat on the shelf for about three months before I revised but here it goes: pours a cloudy burnt orange color with a thin head that lingers the whole time. Smell of heavy pine and hemp, may have been more complex on a fresher date. Big hop flavor, not super citrus more on the piney spicy side with some hints of lemon and grapefruit. A nice sweet malty backbone at the very end. Hops dominate but the malty sweetness at the end as a bonus. Have had this a few times, this being the first review. I imagine the caramal l malts to have more of a part in this brew when fresher but a solid brew still and for the price still totally worth it!"
""
""
"Had this on tap @ Pour Farm in New Bedford. A pretty, nice, solid IPA from Sierra Nevada. A little bit more bitter than the average IPA but not over the top. Pretty well balanced otherwise. Definitely would recommend to someone looking to get into IPAs or who is just in the mood for an IPA"

"O - Sierra Nevada has never failed to impress me. This is my first wet/fresh hopped beer, and it's fantastic. The NZ hops add a different dimension than I'm used to, and the caramel sweetness perfectly balances the grapefruit and piney bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sierra Nevada Southern Hemisphere Harvest Fresh Hop Ale ---4/5."
""
""
""
"O- Pretty nice brew, good New Zealand hops."
""
""
"Overall: Fresh hops tock. This beer truly represents those characteristics. I can't wait to try out the Northern version later this year."

"2013 release breaking in my new DFH IPA glass. Pours a clear golden-orange with a massive fluffy white head that barely fades at all, and leaves tons of sticky delicate lacing when it finally does. Smell is big aromatic hops; juicy citrus, leafy/herbal/minty, soft pine and citrus rind, nutty and spicy alcohol and malt, some caramel malt too. Taste is clean caramel malt at first, then blown away by all sorts of hops. Crisp leaf, spicy herbal and mint, juicy citrus and fruit, pine, and then a good bite of bitterness at the end. Finish is slightly sticky, with hints of the malt hanging around, but mostly it's bitterness. A hell of an IPA, just like its Northern Hemisphere Harvest sister; a must-try for hop-heads."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: An excellent fall IPA, although far from SN's most reasonably priced at almost $3 per 12 ounces. Certainly a better buy as a sixpack. Perhaps even better if an IPA lover can find Torpedo for closer to $1 per 12 oz. bottle. Here you are apparently paying for the two added New Zealand imported hops."
""
"An excellent beer with a big hop punch and base, with some nice malt flavours coming through to support it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Stellar beer; grab one if you see one. I could drink this one year round, unfortunately it is only available seasonally."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Outstanding value. It will be one of my go-to's as long as it's around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, pretty good. Perhaps it is different a bit fresher, but this tastes like a UK/American hybrid to me."
"great hop foundation with fruity mouth and aftertaste. prefect balance of hop in the finish. incredibly easy to drink, i loved this one. sierra nevada can hit and miss but this is up there as one of my favorites recently. similar maybe to ithaca flower power if i had to compare. bottom line, MUST TRY for any hophead or beer enthusiast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is definetly for fans of malt forward IPAs. Another solid offering from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste starts with sweet tangerine and lemon, then comes bread, ending in pine and a bit of grapefruit. Has a tangerine/pine aftertaste with a bit of breadiness. Pretty average carbonation and mouthfeel for an IPA, perhaps just a bit on the lighter side."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Why did I only buy one bottle of this??? I could drink this every day."
""
""
""
""
"The body is semi-dry all the way through. It has good smoothness and crispness working together."
""
""
"I like the pine/barky undertone and citrus aftermouth. Reminds me of pinion fire in the red rocks of Arizona. Good buzz from a pint. Let it air. This is a food beer. Pair with mesquite BBQ or rich mole sauce over fresh tamales. Drink with plenty of Indian flute in the background."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Not a real assertive IPA but unique enough and a real good drinker..."
""
"Pours dark amber, close to light brown with a 2 finger light tan head. Lacing hanging all over. The aroma notes are lemon peel, slight tropical notes, brown sugar, black pepper, a little woodsy pine. Lots of bitterness in the taste. It's all balanced very well, it almost tastes liked a sugar cookie that's been baked too long. It's a lot different than the major citrusy hopped beers always coming out. This is insanely drinkable and at a incredible price. I need to pick up a lot more of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. I hope to buy many more bottles of this beer, as it seem readily available, and it has a great price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a unique and very well made beer. It was completely about the hops and hop characteristics and each of them was well stated and full. It had a confident and presumptive malt character that never let the bitter steal the show. The malt was not terribly sweet and that was a big highlight in the drink. The spices were more intense as the beer warmed. Finished dry and with a touch of earthy grain. This was a potent IPA."
"Beer's body is medium in weight, with medium-low levels of carbonation, leading to a soft, comfortably foamy mouthfeel that drinks easily. Closes semi-dry, with substantial stickiness lingering on the palate and lips after each sip."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very nice brew. SN with another solid beer. I would expect no less."
"clear lightish red/brown. bit of pineapple is the first thing to hit my nose, then clean earthy grassy aroma. great head dies to decent layer, awesome thick clingy lacing. hops are very present, but not terribly bitter, and grass, too. bit of citrus, but not much. bitters up just a bit as it warms. would like just a bit more malt backbone, but that's just me. later on it picks a bit of sense you're on a farm - not in a bad way, just seems about as non-metropolitan as you can get. good effort on sn's part trying something different."
"Pours out a copper-amber with a thin, frothy head. Beautiful herbal/floral hop aroma. Caramel malts also in the nose. Caramel malts up front in the flavor. Hops star to come out in the middle: very tea-like, with floral notes. Some toastiness develops in the finish along with a bitterness that grows like a ""slow burn"" of some chiles. I almost pick up some watermelon flavors; not sure if it's the yeast or a character derived from the hops. Solid mouthfeel all around. Good carb and not thick or sticky. Very drinkable and very tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Tasty! Not too ""piney"". Great mouth feel and color. Pours a nice thick, creamy head that sticks around for a while. My palate isn't very developed yet. I usually prefer stouts and porters but this one will be had again. From a 16 oz. bottle, served in a pint glass."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a very well balanced IPA. The hops are blended nicely with the sweet malt. I would love to see an Imperial version of this one. It's strong in flavor, but it's lacking in alcohol intensity, but the complexity on the taste makes up for that."
"overall: Honestly this may be my favorite beer all time from Sierra Nevada. Very well balanced, and rather unique as I got some exotic hop flavors that I haven't quite tasted before. I would buy this again if I saw it, a damn good beer that beat my expectations."
"O: A very good showcase of each hop variety used in this beer. Will definitely be getting this one again and would recommend to any hop head."
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - very good beer but falls just a little short of what I expect from SN"
""
""
""
""
"Get it, my children. Seek it. Devour it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm glad I had a chance to try this as it was another solid IPA from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
"I could see having this beer with some thai, spicy wings or pizza. It's kind of like that perfect beer that doesn't get in way of the taste of the food and the food won't get in the way of the beer's taste."

"4.14/5.00"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Damn, this is very nice. Good wood, hop, citrus notes. Refreshing."
""
"Pouts a deep copper red with one finger off white head. Beautiful pour. Aroma is raw hops, very floral, pine, and candy sweetness. Up front floral flavor with a bit of pine. Strong malt backbone here, with hints of caramel sweetness. Ends dry and bitter, with some funk I am not sure I’m a fan of. Leaves a lingering feel that you just ate a hop pellet. Light to medium slick mouthfeel, adequate carbonation. Not bad, but was hoping for a bit more."
"I would recommend this one to an IPA lover who doesn't want there palate destroyed. Seems pretty sessionable for 6.7% abv. I really enjoyed this brew."
"Shared a taster on-tap as part of four flights at the brewery; Sierra Nevada Brewing Co, Chico, USA. Then ordered a half pint later. Yum! As part of a six-week West Coast beer tour. I rate to taste, not to style. See my blog for more details: carbeers.wordpress.com"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I only used half the beer to infuse and the other half to review. After reviewing the original bottle (which I held with a wine stopper in the bottle for an hour, so it held the carbonation), I poured it into the infused to recarbonate the dead infused one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one flavorful IPA without overkill on hops. I never thought I'd like having a malty IPA until I tried this. It's slightly spicy and earthy, which is what makes this brew unique. I'll be seeking this out in the spring every year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is just a delightful spring, early summer beer. Loved it."
""

"what an unreal brew, something so special to have a fresh hop ale in the spring months. the freshness of this beer is top notch. it pours a darker copper share, nice and clear, with an excitable off white head an inch high. the nose is citrusy hops, really juicy, but also plenty bitter, and the pale malt profile is just right as balance. the hops really shine in the flavor, and there is some pineapple type of tropical complex that I seem to always get from hops from new Zealand, although I am largely unfamiliar with these specific varietals. this beer oozes sierra Nevada quality, it is just a work of art. every bit as delicious as the northern, this is a beer I could happily drink every single day. the feel rocks, its soft and creamy, almost cask like, but well carbonated and very refreshing. the color is darker but the body is light, and I find 6.7% abv to be exactly what I like in an ipa I am going to drink all day. I just wish this was available all the time, its everything I want in a beer and nothing I don't, an exceptional product from sierra Nevada, who in many ways is still the kind of hop. I am going to buy more today!"

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Big, fluffy off-white head, high retention with soapy and clear lacing on a clear copper body. Aroma includes big notes of fresh grass and pine. Taste has a very satisfying bitter bite with some citrus/grapefruit notes, some sweet caramel malt in the background. Quite delicious...as per usual from Sierra Nevada."

"I wish they would release this in a 6 pack format. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to be reminded of what a truly balanced IPA tastes like."
"A chewy IPA, I'd say, a superb brew. So fresh you wanna slap it. (Someone mighta used that before, maybe Adirondack Brewing Co.) I think the Newzies' hops are coming into their own, and this is why SH Harvest continues to rise. Cheers!"

"O - OK for the try but not going to become one of my goto beers"
""
"on this then the Northern Hemisphere (from what I remember). The subdued aroma is quickly corrected by the surprising complex and rich flavor profile that follows"
""
""
""
"I was hoping that with the kiwi hops, this beer would be more complex, but the hops are a little subdued. Solid beer overall though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I loved it. I love the special things they are doing at SN and I love how size hasn't diminished passion. They love what they do, and they show that profits can be a good thing. Like shipping fresh hops from NZ on a turbocharged pirate ship to be brewed in Chico in a week's notice. A'hoy bitches!"
""
""
"A tasty and drinkable IPA."
""
""
""
"O: Nice brew and well balanced. Closer to an Amber Ale for me than an IPA but still nice."
""
""
"A good but boring beer. Nothing too special here."
"D: good, but not great. I have had better hoppy beers from SN."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.25 - another solid offering from my favorite brewery; although I was hoping for more based on my experience with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy, this is still a really complex tasting American IPA that showcases some of the lesser know South Pacific hop varietals like Motueka; and, for $7.99 for a >22 oz., the price is right, recommended fresh!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, light carbonation, slick and oily on the tongue."
""
"Overall, a very unique tasting IPA, utilizing NZ Motueka and Southern Cross hops on the finish. Kind of a hybrid between a german noble hop character and a more exotic NZ hop character. There is a pretty big malt balance to this beer, bringing it close to being a hopped up amber. Nevertheless, it is damn tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A super fresh nice drinkable ale that delivers what it advertises. The mouthfeel is strange but the flavor is on point. I remember enjoying the Northern Hemisphere better."
""
""
"O - A fantastic introduction to wet hop ales. It's not too brash or in-your-face, and it hits all of the right notes. I wish the taste was a little more hop-forward, but the characteristics of a wet hop ale are all present and accounted for. Solid brew."
""
"Somewhat lacking in aroma hops, but the flavoring hops were interesting. Bittering hops definitely dominate. It's a little too bitter for my liking, but the mint finish helps. And the bitterness isn't as offputting as some."
"MF - A smooth creaminess quickly morphing into a sharp bitter finish."
""
""
"This pours a caramel auburn color with great cottony foam. There’s an aroma that’s slightly peppery with a somewhat earthy caramel note to it. Tastes of caramel and pine with some earthy peppery characteristics and a dry finish. The hops in this don’t “stick out” in the way I’d expect from a fresh-hopped ale, nor do they exhibit the vibrancy I’ve come to expect from Southern Hemisphere (New Zeeland) hops. Reminds me of a SNPA with more malt/caramel and an earthier hop character."

""
""
""

""
""
""

"This is all about the hops, which I find are Southern Cross, Pacifica and Motueka from New Zealand. They are all new varieties to me, but it's a bitter blend. Spicy and on the acidic side. Almost severely woody, like it was strained through leaf mold. Drinkable enough, but not a brew to gulp. Medium body. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Barons Marketplace in San Diego."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent fresh IPA, but I prefer the Northern version a bit more. The 2 hop profiles are noticeable different between the N and S. The north has a bigger grapefruit taste."
"O: presents well and tastes nice - very satisfying and easy-drinking, but with some heartiness to it - lots of good hop and malt mixing, well-balanced and enjoyable. I'd buy this every season."
""
""
""
""
""

"A nice beer overall. Not mind blowing, and certainly not the hoppiest beer around. But a very pleasant and drinkable IPA, especially for the price point."
""

""
""
""
"O: One of the best single IPAs that I've had in a while. Very interesting mouthfeel that I don't see in many IPAs. Not very hoppy, but just enough hop on the taste to keep me interested."
"Overall, a very impressive beer, especially in the aroma. While the flavor falls a bit short, this is quite enjoyable and one I am glad I picked up."

"Overall, the best thing about this beer was richness of flavoring, and full, hearty glug to the feel. From the start of things, the look is inviting, but the aroma tapers off into metallics, adjuncts, and overpowering maltiness. This actually plays well into the flavoring, as the strong grain base is enough to balance the dark, bittering Pacific hop varietals. Thus, the flavoring remains robust and interesting throughout, helping in large part to make this guy a success."

"Compared to Northern Hemisphere, this is certainly a lower status brother. Taste and everything confirms that. Worth trying nonetheless. Some may like it for its mild hop presence."

"This is an oddly dry IPA. The malt presence isn't too strong - I couldn't really detect any sort of sweetness. Hops weren't pungent & and it was noticeably a wet-hopped beer. The hope profile was definitely unique, likely due to the hop selections. All in all I wasn't overly thrilled with it, but it's unique and worth trying."
"Body is moderate-heavy, not sticky though. I like them really light for pales and IPAs, so this is off my mark."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-awesome, thanks again guys you continue to be the best"
""
""
""
"Overall, an excellent beer, but not one I will buy again. By no means do I think this is a bad beer, but I have tried enough IPAs to realize that my personal preference is for those with very little detectable sweetness. I will have to try the Northern Hemisphere Harvest Ale. From what I've read, I think that one will suit my palate a bit better. Still, this one was a nice beer and by no means a disappointment."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great IPA. It has a very nice balance of hops yet remains lighter and goes down smooth. Very much like it."
"Somewhat a decent tasting beer, although Sierra Nevada has a lot of beers that are better than this and cost less and in 12 ounce and not 24 ounce containers. My advice on this one is to grab a six of Pale Ale or Torpedo from these guys and leave this for someone else."
""
""
""
""
""
"Lovely - tons of flavour and character. A robust malt backbone underpins an avalanche of hops. The aroma and flavour encompass a variety of hop notes, but the result is a fantastic balance with the malt. Smooth, juicy mouthfeel. I'm not sure when this was bottled or how old it is, but the character is superb. Fresh hops for everyone! Well worth sampling if you come across it."

""
""
"A brilliant beer. I'm no hopheads, but I can certainly appreciate this for what it is."
""
"Overall, this is a solid beer that only lacks in the scent department. Nothing special in the taste category, but still not bad. Great value for a larger format bottle."
"Hazy copper colour, nearly two fingers of white head, lots of lace here. Smell is hoppy, pine and citrus fruit, tangerine and pineapple with a little lemon, fairly big biscuity and malty presence as well. Taste is of bitter hop, drying tropical fruit and citrus flavours, grapefruit and pineapple, really big malt presence here as well that balances out the hop and never making it seem harshly bitter. Medium carbonation, medium body, fairly slick and resinous. Nice hoppy pale ale, never quite feels like an IPA though it makes an admirable APA, enjoyable stuff here."
""
""
""
""
"O- Really awesome. Hops are great. I love it. Just enough balance to keep the hops from running wild, while still letting them shine. I really like this beer."

"Overall this is a solid IPA however i can't recollect whether i enjoyed the Northern Hemisphere more. Either way another good one from trustworthy sierra nevada."
"D- I REALLY like this beer. This is seriously one of the best beers for the money for the summer. I like a lightly citrus beer with a lot of hops and a great taste and very refreshing without being weak or watered down or too citrus/lemony. This beer is the perfect summer beer. I'm going back for more. A must try for any beer fanatic. And it doesn't even cost that much."
"O: A really good harvest ale, hoppy and sweet with a rough, earthy quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very good IPA, excellent aroma with a good flavor profile. A bit heavy on the bitterness for being so malty at the beginning, but still refreshing, could use more depth. A good cool summer night brew."

"Zesty, fresh, lively on nose, citrus on nose, AIPA to the tee on the taste. Real hop bomb. Amended marks which I do not nortmally do - previously 4/3/3.5/4/3.5"

"Not a bad beer and this may not be the freshest bottle, but not my favorite either."

"Tastes well-balanced, with the malts up front and a tropical citrus/grapefruit twang at the finish. Absolutely superb and well-enjoyable, and a great value at the price (As I remember, $4-5 per bomber)."

"Pours a hazy copper with a 2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to a craggy cap on top of the beer. A foamy latticework of lace coats the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some earthy herbal hop aromas. Taste is of malt, herbal hops, and alcohol. There is a fairly high amount of hop bitterness that lingers on the palate long after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but the mouthfeel is off and the bitterness is quite high which lessens the drinkability in my opinion."
""

"Pours a clear golden copper small off-white head that has decent retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is earthy hops, some light grapefruit, white wine grape, caramel, and a light dankness. Taste has a bit of sweetness with some caramel, earthiness, a light mineral note, dank hops, and white wine grape. The finish has a decent bitterness to it with a lingering dankness. Medium body. Medium carbonation."

"O-a good IPA with rich full flavor"
"Highly recommend."
""
""
"Pours an a clear amber with a rich, two finger off white head. There many bubbles rising. On the nose I am picking up pine, a little lemon, pepper and a lot of malt. This is a very malty beer, not what I expected, although I have never had a beer focusing on fresh hops. I can imagine that the fact that the fact that the hops are fresh may effect the bitterness. There is little hop flavor, the malt overpowers all. It is refreshing and it does have a good mouth feel, but it tastes a bit much like a barleywine. This is one of the least bitter ales I have had from Sierra Nevada, not what I expected. Perhaps this bottle may be old or mishandled, I did by it off of a dry self from my local grocery store. Too bad Sierra Nevada obfuscates their bottle dates, I'm not in the mood to decipher their code."

"A fine, fairly enjoyable IPA."

"ovreall, another solid beer from sierra nevada, but like most of their line, nothing that knocks my socks off. price is right at under $5 for the bottle and i would pick it up again if ever looking for a priced right fresh hop brew."

"Overall: A delicate treat, and the best part didn't hit you in the pockets for a very super-premium brew. Drink up fellas (and ladies)....Salud!"

"I'm very pleased with this beer. The story behind the making of the beer is very interesting and it delivers on all accounts. It appeals to all my senses and is very cost affective."

""
""
""
""
""

"O- A good IPA. Quite drinkable and very interesting with complex hop flavors."
"Overall: I liked this one but the bitterness was a little much. Aroma was nice, borderline 4 to 4.5 rating. A nice one to try."
""
""
"The amount of effort they put into the bottle and artwork should translate a little better to the flavor side of things."
""
""
"O- Really lacking in the nose, weird hop flavors, not very good."
"O: Yum, great fresh hop beer. Good hop flavor and bitterness along with decent balance. Sierra Nevada never seems to disappoint. Another solid beer."
""
"Overall –This was a nice beer. While not quite as diverse and robust in the hop flavor as it’s Northern Hemisphere counterpart, it had nice characteristics with a good flavor blend."
""
""
""
"At Tylers in Durham. I had high hopes after Northen Hemisphere which was fantastic, but this was a letdown. A big letdown. It doesnt smell like much. Alot of balanc. no real hops to be found. The dominant flavor was bitterness, but thats even a stretch. It just seemed a bit light compared to its northern counterpart."
""
"I must apologize for my saddened inner Kiwi hop lover. I was able to get a much fresher bottle and I must say it does take me back. The scores have now been corrected."
""
"Poured into a brandy snifter. Pours golden orange with a thick, biege white head. The head dissipates very slowly. Lacing is left behind on the glass as the head dissipates. Some bubbles can be seen rising along the side of the glass and up from the bottom. Fresh citrus, piney, and floral hops as well as sweet malts hit the nose up front. It smells resinous and grassy. Bright hops are forward in the taste and are balanced by the just as forward sweet malts. Juicy citrus and resinous pine are well balanced here. It has a mild spiciness as well. The flavors are very bold and pleasing. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is an excellent beer with great flavor and drinkability. Sierra Nevada once again has another winner with this IPA."
""
""
"O - Sierra Nevada never disappoints with their hoppy beers. This one emphasizes tropical fruits and hops while maintaining balance. For about 6 bucks for 24 oz, this is a pretty good value. Not exceptional, but very good."
""
""
"I think it is great that a different offering would get such great reviews by other BA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very tasty beer that I wish was year round. It has so much flavor and the hops used in this beer are very intense. Just an all around great beer."
""
"O- An awesome IPA, well balanced and an impressive hop character. A big feel and very drinkable. Also I spent 4$ on a 24Oz beer, it makes me question the price of other bombers out there."
""
"O: A great brew, I enjoyed this beer thoroughly, had it on tap at the Stirling Hotel in Stirling NJ, Great beer and great food."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad IPA but by far my least favorite SN brew yet. It is still a good beer just not to my taste preference. Perhaps this beer is a bit too old (~1.5 months... ehh) or my palate is off tonight. Would probably buy again if it was ultra fresh because even though a miss, the price was great ($5)"
""
""
""
""
"The bitterness cuts the drinkability some, but its really not a bad beer, just something I would hesitate to pick up again."
""
"O: Man...I'd like to rate this one higher, but this one is a miss for me. Trust me, I'm a huge SN fan and I love everything they've done, but this one isn't doing it for me. The bitterness isn't balanced with much else. Maybe my allergies are getting in the way of tasting this, because I'd really like to like it at only $5 a bomber from one of my favorite breweries, so I'll have to try it again in the future. As of right now, I'm not really enjoying it."
""
""
""
"O: IMO this beer gets a rating of 5, everything about this beer is great, its easy to drink, balanced and the taste is amazing. I cant wait to try Northern Hemisphere in the fall."
""
""
"O- As always, a quality brew from Sierra Nevada. Made even better by the appreciation of the lengths they go through to get fresh hops all the way from new Zealand back to America, dried, and brewed in ‘a little over a week.’ Very impressive and very easy to drink. Looking forward to this years Northern harvest"
""
""
""
"O- Glad I picked one up. A very well brewed balanced beer, I've never seen head retention that is so thick and creamy. This is winner in my book."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: At times, this beer tastes like a cream ale; so smooth and creamy that it almost downplays the hops. And aren’t those supposed to be the showcase of this beer? Oh well, you won’t hear me complain that much – this stuff is good."
""
""
""
"I am a huge Sierra Nevada fan, and truly believe the brewery does things right. I have not been disappointed in any of the styles that I love from this brewery. So yes, I gave it 5's across the board as I love this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good, well worth seeking out while it's around."
""
""
""
"Overall- Brilliantly crafted with love and with such harmony between hops, malt and carbonation I hardly notice the ABV. Only wish I had a Five Guys burger and fries right now to complete this meal."
""
"I'm not gonna lie, I was expecting more of a hop bomb; maybe my palate has changed since last year. With that said this was one of the more clean, and balanced American IPAs I've ever had. I love SN because they keep quality high, availability high, and prices low; and at $5 for 24 oz bottle, I'll be getting another one of these this season. Cheers!"
"Solid IPA, big hop character and balanced but got progressively worse as it sat. The flavor contrasts the aroma. The aroma is diverse and floral though not very strong and the taste is bold, raw and one dimensional, odd. The alcohol was glaring which was also a bit surprising."
""
"Overall I had a wonderful time drinking this beer, great flavor and the color and head were I must say perfect. I must buy more."
""
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this offering from Sierra Nevada. It wasn't my favorite IPA, but it was definitely worth the price- only $5 for 24 oz.. It had a nice balance between the citrus hops and caramel malts and was easily drinkable. Would definitely consider buying again."
"O: Overall good, but not best fresh hop beer. It just didn't give me enough of the taste difference that fresh hop beers should have."
"O: a phenomenally well crafted and balanced brew with a solid hop character in the taste but not overwhelming in the scent, refreshing and drinks easily"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this brew does a great job of complementing the refreshing fruity hops with a sweet malt backbone. Another solid brew from SN."
"O - This is a terrific IPA. It looks great, has a terrific hoppy aroma and taste, and is very drinkable. I only wish that this came in 12 oz bottles, but really who am I kidding? I’d probably just drink 2 anyway. Hats off to Sierra Nevada on this one."
""
"O - Excellent IPA, killer deal at this low price point. I would drink this directly from the bottle - seems the resins are transient when poured. Pick one up today and enjoy!"
""
""
"O: An enjoyable experience of which I would gladly drink again but not seek out. I'm glad I tried it but the flavors become too cloying and there isn't enough to remember this beer by."
""
"Overall - Solid wet hop ale. Not big fan on the Sierra pine character making it's presence known here, and I find it strange since they're using different hops. Must be the whole cone approach and the way Sierra infuses them into their brew which releases these characteristics, rather than a specific hop, per se."
""
""
""
"o - I look forward to the Southern and Northern Harvest brews. The 2012 isn't as tasty as I recall the 2011 Southern Hemisphere to have been and definitely not as much to my liking as the 2011 Northern Hemisphere, primarily because of the lingering pepper spiciness in this batch."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled on 116 day of 2012. Pours a beautiful bright reddish orange with a one inch of white head, that leaves marvelous lace. Smell is tangerine, pine, grass, and hints of carmel. Taste is a very balanced citrus, with a grapefruit finish. Body is medium large, plenty of life, lush, and drinkable. The Southern and Northern are two beers that I love and at $4.29 a big beer, doesn't hurt the wallet."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really like this beers subtleties, but the total package isn't doing it for me. Sierra Nevada's Northern Hop Harvest a few months ago was light years better."
"Pours an enticing copper color with a good head and great lacing throughout session. A very hoppy aroma first whafts at me after opening. ( yeah I said it, whafts) with slight mud and earthy overtones. A smooth clean beer that is not overly bitter, with some sweetness. Medium light in the mouth. Very drinkable, and enjoyable. I will look forward to the release of these every year."

"O - Unfair review with a bottle this old. Not bad as I was given this bottle as a gift 2 days ago, but I would never buy one this old. Fresh on the other hand...yes I would buy and revisit...and revise my review when that happens. For the record, I have had this beer fresh a coupe years ago and remember it being noticeably better. Not many IPAs I can think of that hold up better than SN's after a significant amount of time IMHO for what it's worth."
""
""
""
"Overall - A very good IPA - nothing groundbreaking just a good, clean well made IPA... recommended..."
""
""
"Review from 6/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a clear medium to dark orange amber, nice two finger white head with excellent retention and nice lacing. A great presentation. Piney and herbal fresh hop aroma with a hint of malt. Creamy and medium bodied. Nice hops up front with a modicum of malt support. The finish is piney, herbal hops, slight earthiness with a quiet malt base, which presents the hops nicely. I like sweeter malt bodies on IPAs, but this seems nearly perfectly balanced. A very nice IPA. Will definitely buy again."

"Pours a murky orange color with a dense white head. Rather heavy on the citrus peel aromas, particularly orange. A nice floral quality along with a hint of pine in the background. A touch of sweet malt is also there. A bit of bready malt up front, quickly followed by orange peel and a solid floral and perfume quality. A moderate bitterness on the finish."

"Taste. Holy mecca of beer. Amazing hops taste of black currant, raspberry jam and slight green banana peel with only the gentleness of noble bitterness from the hops. This beer was very heavily hopped using either extremely late additions, whirlpooling or dry hopping. It has incredible hops flavor with only the softest hops bitter from the noble NZ hops. Holy crap. I love it. All the flavor and 1/8th of the bitter of a hops bomb. I'm in love."

"the giant stubster poured into a pint glass gives a nice transparent amber color with a very white 2 finger head that shows amazing retention. Leaves sheet after sheet of lace, quality. the aroma is of nothing other than fresh hop cones, very oily and pungent. a light caramel malt is initial then comes the oily hops on the palate, pine, very herbal and finishes bitter. great balance, the sweet caramel touch then complimented well by the hallertau, well done. the mouth feel is medium with good carbonation and very refreshing very easy to drink if you like hops. hammer time. overall i like it but its doesn't jump out which was expected. nonetheless a great offering."

"Overall: The fresh hops in this beer have a very nice flavor. The hops and malt balance each other well, but the hops are the star. I would definitely have another."

"Worth a try, but I'd rather down the Northern, Estate, Celebration and the Torpedo over this. But again, not bad."

"O- A damn good beer. SN can really do nothing wrong in my mind. I am going to try to find some more of this before it is all gone around here."

"This beer is a nice coppery orange color with a nice tall fluffy off white head with nice lacing and very nice retention. Aroma is all different types of fruity. Lots of tropical and floral notes. The flavor has a bit of bitterness, but not that much, and lots of the sane tropical floral notes. Also lots of caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel is nice. Nothing special, medium bodied. Mild carb. Overall good beer, great value @3.50 a bomber."
""
"The beer is relatively light-bodied--much more so than I thought it would be. The hops bitterness is also fairly subdued, but very well-balanced with the tang of grapefruit, and the grainy and sweet malts. Overall, one of the better IPAs I've had in a while."

"Overall- Great year for this beers first year. They were exceptionally lucky this year it seems. The taste and smell really shine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I really enjoyed this beer and I'll definitely have it again. This is a great example of a balance wet hop ipa. If you're looking for something that is more hop forward, you might be dissappointed but for what this beer is, it's wonderful."

"The taste didn't quite live up to the pour and nose but was good overall. It has strong earth and malt tones with a bit of bitterness that comes through the end. The bitterness stays with you and I picked up some floral notes while contemplating what just happened. I was expecting more hops on this one, being a wet hopper but I have to say, it was somewhat disappointing. Great beer overall but just not exactly what I was expecting. If I'm pulling a wet hop for Sierra I'm going to go with the estate over this."

"Semi opaque burnt orange pour in a tulip. Thick, lump head dissipated pretty quickly. Looks like a classic SN...beautiful for about 30 seconds, then well, messy. Spicy and very bright and floral in the nose (high grade marijuana buds) with malts present in the background. Dried fruits and spices...Big fruity hops are abundant. Earthy and grainy, the barley malts add a depth that surround the huge amount of hops beautifully. Pine nuts and a tangy finish. Dense, oily feel foamy on the tongue. This beer is really good. It really has the depth and hops of a double IPA. This is a well named brew. Tastes and feels like a harvest. Pairs nicely with turkey and cranberry salad. This is my second bottle this autumn and hope to have more. Great!"
"Overall Impression- A very nice brew from Sierra Nevada! The only other Wet Hopped IPA I've had was Founder's Harvest and this one rivals it! I knew this one would be awesome because of Sierra Nevada's reputation with their hops used in all of their brews."
"This is a wonderfully balanced beer. I tried this beer in the Spring and then in the Fall, and noticed the floral character had faded significantly. A really fine and complex beer, and without sounding to superficial, the label is fantastic (2011) - my advice is drink it as soon as its in the shops!!"
"This is one of my favorite seasonals. Definitely a complex hop character but still a very drinkable session beer. This is a very balanced beer. It has enough malt to temper the hops but the hops are still the star of the show. It is a difficult beer to rate because of its complexity. I don't have the vocabulary to really do it justice. Guess you'll just have to try one!"
"O: Apparently I liked this one much more in growler form than bottle as I thought this was a very good beer this time around. Great hoppiness, but still quite balanced."
"O= Overall, I really enjoyed this one the hops where really fresh and the beer was really good would try this one again."
"Overall: this is a very tasty beer and I like it just as much as its Northern brother. Both very good beers, the texture of the Southern tipped the scale in its favor for me."
"O- Nothing special. Not sure how old this is, so the hops may be faded a little."
"Like the hop profile, but I think I've been spoilt by much fresher NZ examples. Relatively drinkable nonetheless."
"o) Delicious, rewarding, interesting, and very more-ish. Fairly strong in flavour, so wouldn't have too many. But certainly a beer for slow contemplation."
"Nice to try and definately would try again and woould definately recommend as well."
"Overall - I love when this stuff comes out, it is incredibly refreshing, such a go to beer."
"Is this an IPA or a pale ale? Do I care? Not really. It's a unique beer in its own right, a pale ale with a subtle hops profile balancing the malt. This is pretty close to a perfect pale, probably because of the fresh hops. Delicious, delicious, and...incredible. Really great beer, recommended."
"O: A really good IPA with moderate (6.7%) ABV. Fresh hops have faded and perhaps lost some punch over 5-1/2 months. Will look for forward to it earlier next year."
"Overall, this is a nice change from SNPA, but definitely from the same family."
"With a good hard pour I got a huge pillowy head and a turbid tawny orange body. Good retention here and gobs of lacing all about the glass. Floral aroma, earthy, grapefruit, piney, zesty and vibrant on the nose. Bottle is a bit older but I still expected more on the nose in terms of potency than what was given. Solid dry malt body, caramel and toasted bread, solid hop bite, grapefruit an pine. Not very sweet, body is fairly average, with not a rich smoothness to it. I found this beer to be brighter than the northern hemisphere in its hop/beer focus."
"O- This was fantastic, great job everywhere. I likes how piney and bitey the hops and it looked unbelievable."
"O - It's not as hoppy as your normal IPA but it's a great change of pace. It's doesn't wow your sense or make you pucker it's so bitter. Very drinkable and should appeal to a wide audience."
"O - An interesting IPA all around. Balanced, but not in the traditional malt-to-hop sense. Instead, there's enough variety in the hop flavor to keep it from being overwhelming or overtly bitter. The result is a solid beer that manages to be complex and drinkable at the same time"
"O - Very nice harvest ale."
"O: A good IPA. Not as bitter as I usually like but love the oilyness of the fresh hop."
"Glowing amber hoppy citrus beer, this was a perfect hop juice--not too bitter, not too drying, just genuinely juicy and creamy and succulent. Very fruity--grapefruit, orange, pineapple--with some caramel malt, finishes with a peppery burst. I just loved this beer--ranks up with the very best of them."
"Highly recommended."
"O: a great beer, I look forward to this release each year. I don't see that changing anytime soon."
"Overall-Pretty world class IPA. Just amazing, drinkable ipa that won't put you totally on your ass but gives you that great fresh hop taste. I'm going back Monday for more."
""
"O--This is a great IPA from the guys at Sierra Nevada. Something I wish I could get year round. Love the bittering effect on the back end."
"This brew poured out as a copper colored brew with a nice strong thick white head on top. The lacing was very sticky and clung to the glass for dear life with every sip. The smell of this brew is very piny and citrusy, the fresh hops really smell fresh in this brew. The taste of the beer is a lot like the smell, big hop flavors with a good malty sweetness in the finish. The mouthfeel had a nice oily feel to it with a good carbonation to it also. Overall it's another damn good IPA from Sierra Nevada."
"This seems like it could have been a more balanced ale."
"All in all, this is not bad, though not terribly impressive either. I'm willing to give this brew the benefit of the doubt and I'll probably seek this out next year a bit closer to the release date."
"Overall, a fantastic beer, offering a grand opportunity to try some hops from down under. Cheers!"
"O: This is a really nice, well balanced IPA. It's nearly a DIPA, except for the fact that the flavours are rather subdued. 4"
"Pours a slightly hazy copper with an impressive three finger rocky head. The aroma is mostly flowers but it is very subtle. I am disappointed with the smell of this one. The taste on the other hand is fantastic. I get a nice strong hop profile with some citrus. There is a nice caramel backbone but it is overshadowed by the bitterness. The mouthfeel is light to medium and the carbonation is relatively high. Overall this is a fine IPA. The aroma is really lacking, but the taste makes this a good IPA. I want to try this fresher to see if the aroma is improved. Recommended for hop heads."
"O-Such a good beer. Strikes excellent balance and the hop characteristics explode out of the aroma and flavor. Highly drinkable, and highly recommended"
"O: really good beer, nothing special or crazy in a great simple way"
"O: A fantastic APA. If this used different hops it would clearly be an IPA or a lower abv IIPA but as is, it represents the APA characters and I would say is arguably one of the best that I have had in this style."
"D: Damn can SN do some fine hoppy beers. Fresh harvest hops – popping with flavor and character – noticeable leafy, chlorophyll aspect, but raw bitterness kept at the right level. I wouldn’t want to drink too many in a row as I think the leafiness might start to get to me. As something to try a couple of each year? Good stuff."
"Very well-balanced. Definitely the antithesis of an extreme IPA. Hop aromas are less on the citrus and more on the herbal with a touch of cocoa and pine. Initial bitterness peaks quickly and slowly fades for a good 30+ seconds. Sweet maltiness gives a solid body to the beer."
"O: This is a very nice AIPA, not so extreme as others can be. Highly drinkable."
"A huge miss from a usually solid brewer. I'll try another next year a little fresher, but this was so bad, I don't think it'll help much."
"Taste is not quite as hoppy as the smell; it's grassy and sweet with a nice balance of malt and hops with a bitter finish."
"O-herbalesque/grassy IPAs aren't my favorite, but this is quite tasty. its definitely a worthwhile IPA. it seems to get more complex as the evening goes on."
"o - Overall a really solid IPA. I've bought bottles of this many times and will continue to do so. I also think it's a great beginner IPA as I've had a lot of non-craft beer drinkers really enjoy this one. Will certainly have it again."
"O: Wow very satisfying balanced beer. Key feature is the persistent aftertaste. Defiantly worthy of my beer mantle. Defiantly would buy again and recommend. Very nice."
"Very nice IPA. Very very drinkable without being overdone."
"I had high hopes for this and have not been disappointed. Actually I thought the journey would harm it to the point of it not being as good as it is. Thankfully, it is THIS good!"
"Nice offering here. Pours a dark golden-amber, with a pillowy bulging head. The nose is all about floral and citrus notes. Flavors of caramel malt and citrus take a backseat to fresh bitter hops throughout the pull. Well-balanced, with a decent lingering bitter resinous finish. Smooth on the palate, with a medium body, easy creamy quaff. Excellent."
"o: great beer"
"Hops aren't as potent to the taste as they were for the nose, but this is still an impressive brew, flavorful, good body to it and a great collectable bottle to boot!"
"O: This was a great IPA. I'm not sure how I'd rank it compared to Torpedo, especially for the price. However, I like the idea of getting the hops from New Zealand. I'll have one again next year, for sure."
"Overall: A lackluster offering from Sierra Nevada. The play with New Zealand hops lacked some of the enjoyability I've come to expect from Sierra Nevada. Not a bad beer overall, and it's definitely an experience."
"Very good bitterness and hop character, a traditional Sierra Nevada brew."
"Glassware: growler into snifter"
"d/ Though the more subtle aroma hides it, this is a big beer, an Ale to be savoured over an hour of contemplative sipping. I think if I could try this fresh I would give it 5."
"O: Not at all dissapointing and perhaps even better than anticipated. The smell (or lackthereof) was really the only detractor from another fine Sierra Nevada effort. The hops here weren't overly bitter and complimented the malts very nicely. Sierra Nevada consistently produces really good hoppy beers without relying on the bitterness to cover anything up. Solid, solid beer here."
"Overall Impression: Very drinkable. I actually prefer extremely hoppy beers, but this one does well even with the heavy dose of malt. Almost closer to a Pale Ale than the typical overdose of hops contained in most newer American IPA's. Near-perfect balance. If I have one complaint it's that it isn't very crisp."
"D: Really delicious. Very simple, fresh, and refreshing brew."
"Finishing hops: New Zealand Motueka and New Zealand Southern Cross"
"O-- Think the bigger malt backbone really helps this out. balances it out well. Good amount of bitterness to this. Not as flowery as other NZ IPA's I have had are like. Nothing special but very solid."
"A nice, balanced IPA with a hefty bitterness and decent hop notes. The hop character could be brighter but it's still nice."
"Not particularly interesting stuff, I was expecting better."
"Overall: This is very enjoyable; I appreciate the work the fine people at Sierra Nevada do to bring us a wet hop beer all the way from the southern hemisphere."
"This beer's make strength lies within its balance, striking that elusive middle ground that so many beers strive for. I went in expecting a hopped up west coast IPA, which this does not deliver, but once you discover and accept what it really is, its damn good."
"This one pours a a nice and vibrant copper in color witha one finger frothy off white head that laces the glass. It smells of piney and resinous hops with a certain citrusy malt sweetness to finish. It smells pretty solid. The flavor consists of earthy and piney resins with a moderately sweet and dry malt backbone. Solid once again. It drinks light to medium in body and with a dry finish. It's a good beer overall and definitely worth a shot."
"Overall if floral hops smell and flavour rock your boat, fill your boots with this. Otherwise, while it is a hop specific style, it does fall a little short on balance and the total package."
"O- Nice, but not the best IPA I've ever had."
"The taste carries that that same earthy hop variety, with piney resinous oils sticking to the tongue and a tobacco-like essence stinging the tongue. The malts come to play with a rise in temperature. A very smooth drinking beer, I wish there were parts of the world where more autumns can be found."
"O - An Excellent beer, I would recommend it to anyone who already likes IPAs. Would also be a great beer to introduce someone to IPAs."
"O - A very good beer, I would recommend it to anyone who likes IPAs."
"Overall, this is delicious beer, intended for hopheads, and hitting all the right notes in that category."
"O: An impressive IPA, one of the better I have had recently, and would be enjoyed by any hophead."
"O: This is a true West Coast treasure. Don't miss out on this one!"
"O: I wish I had it immediately upon release, but it's still fantastic. I fully approve."
"This is a real treat for a hop head like me. Start to finish--inside and out--the hops command the experience of this ale. I was a bit surprised to find that the grassy and herbal notes won out in the taste, though citrus and pine are still well-represented. You've got to love that nice bitter bite at the end. This is a very engaging brew that is sure to satisfy fans of the IPA and APA styles."
"This brew pours a golden copper hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a two finger creamy head and heaps of lacing everywhere,the smell is wet grass,piney hop resin,peaches and passionfruit,the mouthfeel is medium bodied and has tastes of piney hops firstly followed by some bitter grapefruit,goosberries,a touch of caramel and finished off with a stonefruit bitterness that really puckers the lips and overall its nice but i thought the hop character would be totally different and more NZ influenced but no it feels like more of an American style hop taste and yeah its nice but not what i was expecting."
"Wow. Another brilliant job by Sierra Nevada. I'm not sure I like it more than the Northern Hemisphere Wet Hop Ale, but it's right behind it. Highly recommended for hop lovers."
"Since I started this pour, I waited for the flavors to pop - and waited, until they finally did at the end of the first long pint. Still, not enough for me to enjoy it fully - consistently, but just underwhelming for SN."
"Cheers!"
"Yet another nice beer from SN. Not as hoppy or bitter as some of their other offerings, but all around solid."
"Overall / Drinkability: Good appearance (very persistent lacing) and a solidly good AIPA, but if there is something special about the NZ hops in this beer, I'm missing it. Good malt level to balance out the hop bitterness, but I'm not thinking this is any more special than any other good AIPA I've had lately. One is enough per evening."
"O: A very good example of a west coast IPA. Not over-hopped, yet not under-hopped either. I like the consistency in all of the SN products. This one didn't disappoint"
"Enjoyed on tap at My Place in Newtown, CT this IPA just made my day. A deep copper color with light yellow-orange edges and a honorable light brownish head that holds pretty well. Lacing is solid throughout. The aroma tells you this will meet all your IPA needs with those lovable pine/floral hop combinations and maybe a wheaty overtone to take the sweetness out of it. The flavor marries well to the lead of the aroma, a bright citrus hop mellowed by edible pine and some trace hints of pumpkin I think, though that may be a stretch. This stuff is solidly mid-bodied with a effervescent feel that quenches supremely, goes down way to easily and delivers a nice dose of hop goodness. A classic, highly drinkable west coaster!"
"O - Nice, a New Zealand hop is used, and you can tell it isn't your everyday hop variety, but it is good."
"Enjoy!"
"D/O: This seasonal, wet-hopped ale from Sierra Nevada seems to change from year to year, with this installment in control of a heap of classic and endearing English qualities. Other than an understated and rather dishonest nose, there is not much that is out of place here. After enjoying many iterations of Sierra Nevada's various seasonal pale ales, I get the feeling that they have it as a goal to brew the ale that is the very definition of the word."
"M: Medium bodied, biscuity mouthfeel, I'm not getting a lot of carbonation in this one. Maybe this bottle isn't the freshest. I would have liked it to finish a little drier, but otherwise it is a good IPA."
"I enjoyed this beer, and the aromatic hops were exceptional. However, taste and mouthfeel were average. I would have toned down the carbonation a little, and used less malt."
"Overall this is a decent beer, but it's disappointing because it's so similar to so many other Sierra Nevada offerings and because of the price point, really not worth the extra dollars in my opinion. Worth a go I guess just to say that you tried it and but Sierra needs to do a better job of differentiating theses 22 oz offerings from their original pale ale."
"Copper colored, nice head on this one. Aromatic hops in the nose. Assertively hoppy taste bordering on the overly bitter, nice pine notes in there. Malt backs things up, booze is well hidden. Finish is long and lingering but stops just short of overstaying its welcome for me. I liked this one, and as another reviewer said, the price is right too. Not my top choice in the IPA dept. but certainly a quality beer. Prefer a little more subtlety and balance myself..too each his own though."
"VERY NICE, WORTH SEEKING OUT!"
"D - A very nice offering from Sierra Nevada... The best way to sum this one up is a hop forward offering with and outstanding mouthfeel... Much better than average, but not outstanding... Extra credit given for the value... At sub $5 per bomber, you really can't go wrong..."
"Overall - Very nice and tasty. This beer has more to offer then wet harvest hops which sets it apart from the others. Easy to drink, and good price for it also."
"This beer is perfectly balanced in the taste. The barley and caramel-like malts are oh-so-smooth and the piney hops are perfectly bitter. Slightly resiny with the hop oils coming through the whole taste, but not too in your face. The hop bitterness and smidgeon of citrus and grapefruit could not complement the malts better. This is the taste of fresh hops. Very complex, but clean and not at all heavy-handed. Same with the malts. I've had other IPAs that have a big barley and caramel malt taste, but they end up taking over the whole taste profile. This is the closest to perfection, as far as balance goes, in an IPA that I've had. I've always believed that Sierra Nevada is one of the most consistent breweries in the U.S. and this is a testament to that."
"This beer is much less in-your-face than a lot of harvest ales and I have to say I really like that aspect of it. It is very hoppy for sure, but it instead of punching you in the face with hops, it just provides you with very fresh and dank hop flavors. It has been a few months, but I would have to say this is far better than their estate fresh hop ale."
"D-Overall this is a great beer. Really loved the floral and cirtus notes. And just alittle bite at the end, gave this beer just something alittle different which i liked. Would like to get this again!"
"Final thought - sierra Nevada always puts out an awesome seasonal. Light ABV at 6.3% but the $5 for a 24oz is awesome"
"M: Bitter and dry, a little bready. Nice summer beer. Extremely hoppy and bitter, but nice. ..ultimately leaves a little something to be desired, lacks complexity, depth of flavor."
"Another stellar example from Sierra Nevada. Just the right balance of sweet malt to counter the 66 IBUs."
"Overall - I was really impressed by this beer. I think Sierra Nevada did a great job of bringing somewhat of a fall presentation to this beer while giving it a very unique IPA taste. Well done"
"O - It is a mild IPA. It caught me by surprise in a time of big IPA's. It's a nice simple IPA."
"O: I've had this in previous years, I don't believe this year's batch is up to par. This one is one dimensional in the hop profile (bitter and resiny). The malt is oxidized (cardboard). The beer has potential, but this year is not quite as good."
"the CPJ"
"Overall: Very good, certainly, but not up with the Northern Hemisphere version."
"O: Enjoyable, hoppy, readily available (during early summer) beer. I might not drink this one all the time but I anticipate picking it up again next year."
"Another solid effort from Sierra Nevada."
"A nice IPA with a hop profile that you certainly don't come across every day, nothing like the West or East coast IPAs of today. It is heavily herbal and floral but still drinks well, give it a shot."
"Overall: Excellent, worth the price. This feels very appropriate for the summer. Very refreshing."
"The beer is a cloudy copper color with orange-redd hues and a foamy, creamy tan head that left lots of lacing. Smells of cedar, pine and spicy hops with some caramel malt underneath. Bitter and spicy, piney and peppery hops followed by some smooth fruity/ bready flavors and a long bitter finish. Feels rich and thick, moderate carbonation and a dry finish. Another wonderful harvest ale from SN, this is an awesome beer."
"Mouthfeel: very smooth. Very slight carbonation. Finishes very dry with the hops."
"O: I would love to try this on tap to see if the added carbonation works alter the flavors. Amazing ipa! Another reason why I love Sierra Nevada! Thank you!"
"O: extremely hoppy and bitter, nice malt profile. I do prefer torpedo to this"
"This is a really nice way to showcase the hops from way below the equator. The patois (and I like to use that word for hops to piss off oenophiles (and I like to use that word to confuse drinkers of swill)) of the New Zealand soil lends an almost familiar flavor profile to the hops...they're almost piny but there's something different. Sierra Nevada does a nice job delivering that difference."
"Poured from bottle into dfh snifter. Assuming fresh bottle, not dated. Pours a dark amber orange color, fluffy but condensed head. Visibly creamy, has a thickness to it. Smell- buttery, citrusy, tropical fruit flavors. Taste- big citrus, almost tart sour effect. This is a super enjoyable celebration of hops. All the citrus effects are highlighted, none of the bitterness. The malt backbone to this plays second fiddle, but its not needed. Mouthfeel- creamy, rich, nicely carbonated. Drinkability- this is nice and refreshing. Perfect hoppy beer for summer, would probably pair perfectly with ceviche."
"Overall a pretty good beer. They did a good job on this one especially for only being a $4 bottle."
"Libation: A decent IPA, but not close to as good as the SN Estate Brewers Harvest Ale. I'm not sure I want to pick up a 24 oz bottle of this on the regular."
"This pours a really nice dark copper color and has a fluffy head with some larger bubble on top. The lacing is pretty nice, but this beer really isn’t all that thick and sticky…which adds to its appeal in my opinion. The nose definitely does not come on strong, but the taste isn’t a crazy hop bomb either. This is really more of a perfect balance of tart/bitter hops, crispness, and smooth malt rather than a crazy kick in the tongue. Don’t get this expecting some flav-o-ninja to captivate your senses. This is just a solid medium bodied IPA that isn’t all weird and spitty. Drink this beer and you will say, “This is good…the taste is a good taste.”"
"Light to medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable. A very good brew."
"I enjoyed the aftertaste of this brew, which I always make an important ingredient when rating beers"
"O- Has the drinkability of a sestionable pale ale but with a bigger hop character. It has been a very refreshing beer on a warm night and I would've liked a little more."
"The beer doesn’t have a big ABV, but that’s okay. Not all beers need a big ABV to be good. Having had the regular Sierra Nevada, I still think that one is better… but still, this beer is good. I just can’t get over that aftertaste. Maybe one of the longest aftertastes I have ever experienced. Good stuff!"
"Opinion: Overall this is a very well presented IPA no matter how you look at it. The malt, the hops, the water all goes, and the worked the fermentation to produce a very well balanced beer that holds its carbonation and is quite nice to drink if I do say so. I am not a big fan of hoppy beers for the most part, but still appreciate them. I will certainly be appreciating the rest of this bottle."
"Overall, a very pleasing, tasty, and easy to drink beer from Sierra Nevada. An incredible value as well since this 22oz bomber was less than 6 bucks out the door…I will get a couple more of these for the weekend. I am bbq’ing Texas style brisket (I am a Texan) this weekend and I think will work wonderfully. 8 of 10 and a nice thumbs up."
"Notes - I didnt enjoy this at first but after having a few sips, im really satisfied. The nose is just alittle disapointng. I wanna smell fresh hops!!"
"O: Not a bad beer. I'll definitely get this again and can easily drink about 2-3 of these. Good price and easy to find."
"But don't take my word for it! ( I'm thinking of a sign off line, Reading Rainbow did that didn't it? Lavar Burton thought of everything)"
"I’m not sure what I was expecting but it’s very traditional tasting. The best part? It’s cheap as hell. For a beer that flies its ingredients around the world, I’d expect the price to correlate, but you’ll find no argument here. Even if it was crap, a few bucks for a giant bottle of IPA is totally worth it. The fact that it’s decent is that much better. This won’t take the cake for king of the IPA’s, but it’s probably the best value per ounce you’ll find anywhere. And its ingredients are richer than you are."
"Rather enjoyable, but nothing spectacular. I imagine this bay go down hill fast..."
"O- really like this beer. Tastes a lot like Torpedo, but a little less abrasive and fresher. Plus, at 4.79 for a bomber, it was a STEAL 5"
"O: Unfortunately this one's a bit of a miss for Sierra Nevada. I loved their Estate fresh hop ale in the fall, but this one is just too one-dimensional and bitter."
"Pours a clear, brown tinted gold with less than a finger of frothy white head. Walls of lacing cling. The nose is pleasant. Some earhty hops and bready malt are hinting me towards a bitter tasting beer. Sure enough, big time crisp hop offerings akin to bitter grapefruit, maybe even some rind. Alcohol is tasted after the hops and is followed by a bready/sweet malt that balances this beer out nicely. Because of the intense bitterness, the mouthfeel is sharp and prickly at first and then smooths out at the end, creating a great finish. Overall, a great head-butt of bitter and sweet creates a damn tasty balance that I'm loving right now!"
"O-A solid American IPA, but nothing notable. I know IPA's are supposed to be bitter, but the bitterness lingers long after I swallow, but not in a pleasant way."
"This brew is medium bodied and an excellent summer beer."
"O- Average... Not enough flavor and bitterness is harsh for the profile... again, i'm not a wet hop guy, but this is alright"
"O: This is a great beer, a great basic IPA. It has its own unique flavors and aromas. Definitely going to buy again, probably several more bottles tomorrow."
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This is a nicely drinkable IPA which I’m glad to be having again and I’ve just expanded my shopping list to see about a repeat in the next week or so. My overall impression is that this is a typical SN beer in that it is well made, quite enjoyable, good value for the money."
"Great brew here, and most welcome for the time of year."
"O: Loved last years, but think I got a fresher bottle at that time. This years is not a complex in my opinion, and lacks depth, but it still balanced, and semi-refreshing."
"O - Overall this is a good American IPA. Not quite as good as others from Sierra Nevada that I've had, but its not that bad. Not sure if I'd buy again."
"made to drink. on tap leaves nice curtain. not bad to look at. taste lingers. quafable, made for a session. don't know the peticular hop use yet and do't care. just likeing the finish and taste.as a guy who's tired of the the movement against real beer (flavored with everything from agave necter to human hair and old tires)cool to see a well made adult beverage without trying to hard.true winner."
"Pours a clean copper red with a 1 finger head that turns to a bubbly lace. Super bland smell, light malt, almost grainy, faint hops, disappointed. Again on the taste, grainy, faint bittering hops, light malts, tangy, a tad citrusy. Light and medium on the body, feels good in the mouth light carb, crisp, very bitter. My buddy bought me this bottle and i thank him, however, this just wasnt that good, if i didnt see the bottle i wouldnt believe Sierra Nevada let this leave its plant, nope, not a fan."
"Overall not bad, but I was expecting some lingering aromas and bigger nose on this. It's an enjoyable beer, but for a fresh hop it's missing some punch that I am use to."
"Overall it's a good beer and can't make any real complaints. Worthy of another."
"Overall: Definitely will buy again. I will be tasting this one from year to year and hopefully the Northern as well."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and has an average level of carbonation. Nothing out of the ordinary there. Overall, this is a good brew; very drinkable and the flavor combinations are enjoyable. The freshness is evident in the flavors that are present. A good purchase and definitely another good beer from Sierra Nevada."
"O-Another solid beer from Sierra Nevada. There are better IPAs out there but it is worth a try."
"O- A good brew that is great for the price. $3.99/bomber is a steal. i will buy more. check it out. A few of these would be sooo much more enjoyable than colt .45 and wouldn't cost you a whole lot more. Get it while you can."
"O- Not too bad, a pretty good beer from SN. I enjoy this years better then the previous I've had."
"The tastes is excellent, not a whole lot of malt presence, yet the hop bitterness isn't overwhelming. Very smooth and drinkable, a really nice, almost light IPA."
"Overall this beer is always a pleaser, and a decent value too."
"Poured a clear amber color with light carbonation and a thick frothy head. Spotty sporadic lacing. Aroma is sweet, piney and citrusy. Tasted hoppy with a solid caramel malt backbone. This feels dry to the tongue but the sweetness of the malt balances things up. Not exactly my cup of tea but its enjoyable."
"Overall: Definitely an interesting IPA which I am glad a tried. An easy drinker for sure."
"This is pretty tasty, but not over the top. I think this would be an excellent beer for people that are afraid to venture beyond SA Boston Lager."
"O - This has awesome drinkability. It goes down easily and the taste is great. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall, I thought this was an awesome IPA, and I will certainly be enjoying it again. I recommend giving this one a try."
"Incredible IPA!"
"Overall: A nice limited release, with some flavors I've never had in a Sierra Nevada brew before. This didn't blow me away but it's a solid brew that I'm glad to have picked up. Especially in the summer heat I found it to be a lighter bodied, easier drinking alternative to Torpedo."
"Overall I'm quite happy with this beer. One of my favorites from this brewery without a doubt!"
"O: The taste may be slightly one dimensional, but all other aspects of this extraordinarily bitter beer are great."
"O - Over all this beer looks awesome and the balance is really great too. I like the way this one lingers on the palate and it's very enjoyable to drink."
"O: a very tasty, unique and complex drinking experience. A refreshing take on a style that you can only do so much with. I wouldn't expect anything less from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co."
"D - Very drinkable. The hop profile is super fresh and nice from start to end. The bitterness has a nice kick to it and the hop and malt balance feels really great."
"Overall: Great beer! I was blown away by this and I went in with minimal to no expectations. Worth the $6.99 for the 24 oz beer. Possibly my favorite offering from them to date."
"I think their normal wet hop beer is amazing, but these hops aren’t my thing. Still worth picking up a bottle every few years or having on top when offered."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but otherwise smooth. The drinkability is also fairly good. Overall, a good fresh hop ale. Not quite as good as the Northern Hemisphere, but still a solid brew."
"O: The only real knock is the over-carbonation (really big fizz) and somewhat soapy finish. I like the traditional malt bill and floral/citrus hop and it had a great balance of caramel/crystal sweetness. For the price, this is a good buy."
"O=Something I'll buy every year, but most of Sierra Nevada's other beers are superior to this. Not bad, but don't drive two states over to get it."
"O - An excellent fresh-hop IPA from the best in the business."
"O-> Glad I got to try this fresh this year. Really enjoyable and only more so as it warmed up. Enjoyed this on a freakishly warm day here in Boston and the flavors were even more pronounced in this brew after my tulip had stopped ""sweating"" even...take that for what it's worth and give this one a go...Cheers!"
"Overall, a really good IPA that focuses more on the hop/malt balance and pine aspects than most IPA's I've had lately. Very good and give recommend. Avail here in TX and glad I got it fresh this year after somehow missing it last year. Rotation - it's good for what it is but these days I'm in the hop bomb or at least more citrusy camp so wouldn't buy another this year. Would get on tap at least once and probably get a bottle a year. [O;O]"
"Mouth feel is well carbonated and not over the top. The beer is really enjoyable for me. I am impressed with Sierra Nevada. A ""large"" brewery with great quality."
"O - Every so often, you find that hoppy beer that truly has the ""perfect balance"" between malts and hop that is so often spoken of but rarely encountered. Another fantastic offering from Sierra."
"Reddish amber color in the glass with a frothy white head. Sticky lacing clings all over the glass and leaves a trail the whole way down. Aromas are piney and earthy, big robust hop character, but maintains a malty base. Flavor is bold and has a big malt front that quickly gets pounded over by a huge hop blast. Very earthy and sticky hop character, quite yummy. The caramel malt is well masked by a big blast of piney hops, and a very pleasant bitterness lingers for minutes. Mouthfeel is a bit prickly, but has a good resolution. A solid brew overall, not bad for $5 a bomber."
"Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this is one easy drinking brew. Unfortunately, the complexity of the flavors decreases the drinkability, but not because of the mouthfeel."
"Overall, Sierra Nevada does it again. This is a highly drinkable, well constructed beer. Really enjoyed it."
"Pours a dark copper, nearly amber color with a big fluffy white head which sticks to the top of the glass and all the way down. Smell is really grassy and full of pine. Very earthy aroma. The taste is bitter up front with a strong caramel finish. Honestly, a little too much caramel tasting malt for me. Even a little alcohol on the finish. The bitterness is not very flavorful, just bitter. This beer smells a lot better than it tastes. Overall - probably wouldn't buy again. I have no problem finishing it, and it is enjoyable to drink, but there are much better options out there. I'll take Torpedo for half the price."
"Dark copper in color with excellent clarity. Poured with an impressive beige head that reduced to a healthy cap. Lots of sticky lacings. Light floral and pine hop aroma with a touch of orange zest and fresh grassy and caramel malt undertones. Medium bodied with a smooth oily feel with a resinous feel at the end. Carbonation is somewhat subdued. Floaral and light cirusy orange flavors in the front and into the middle that transition to a bitter hoppy pine finish. Once the palate is conditioned to the intensity of the hops the caramel malt flavors stand out more. Sierra Nevada has yet to disappoint."
"Overall, this was a fantastic beer that I recommend to everyone. The smell, the taste and the appearance were all top notch and I will certainly stock up while Harvest is available."
"O: This year's Southern Hemisphere is excellent and a joy to drink...goes down very easy. I'll be getting another one or two of these before they're gone."
"O: Quite a nice beer. Balanced more like an APA than an IPA, but really well done and different from any other that I have had. Better get some more before the store runs out."
"A really fine brew. The vaguely candied citrus and tropical character of the hops provides a nice balance to the beer's intense bitterness. Gotta also love the effort of flying in fresh hops from New Zealand for this ale."
"highly drinkable, hides the booze, again refreshing but gives you something to taste and think about."
"Overall an unusual IPA. The strong bitterness from the hops has an unusual earthy character, rather that the piney or citrus hop from most American IPA. Seems to have more of an English character with plenty of subtlety. Definitely worth try."
"Overall its worth a try, I love anything with unusual hops in it, but I felt it fell a bit short."
"Overall: The name ""Fresh Hop Ale"" says it all. Huge hops all over the place. Not the easiest IPA to take down, but definately one to be enjoyed."
"O - overall, a very solid beer. Very fresh, which I suppose is the whole point. Definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and clean almost to a fault, with no malt feel contribution at all, but the hops are the point of the beer and they do the job well. Very easy drinking beer too - hops never get out of hand, give a nice dry finish, and the malt does a good job of staying invisible while keeping everything under control."
"Overall: Personally I would rather pick up a 7 pack of Torpedo. Good balance of aromatic and bittering hops. I would probably discourage drinkers from trying this unless they feel like drinking a hop bomb."
"I was a bit afraid after smelling it, but the taste redeemed this beer completely. I could see myself drinking all of this really quickly if I wasn't paying attention."
"if you see this, it is worth checking out."
"O: not what you would call a west coast IPA, but it is a very enjoyable, well balanced IPA could happily be ""forced"" to drink night after night."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is a crystal clear copper coloring with a chunky, fluffy, slightly yellowish-white head. The nose has a descent balance of citrus and hops aromas, and the hops are slightly subdued. Subdued is not the word for the flavors. Grapefruit tastes explode on the tongue, and the hops are actually balancing the citrus sweet flavors in this case. Hops are a dry flavor with some peppery highlights, and it does a good job of bringing some sharpness to the round, sweet and tart grapefruit flavors. The beer is slightly dry and very crisp in mouth, and it has a very subtle aftertaste of hops. The finish is surprisingly quick. I was actually expecting a lingerer for this brew with all the aromas and flavors, but it vanishes in mouth. Very tasty brew, and the quick finish makes this a fairly easy drinker."
"A really nicely done and incredibly drinkable IPA. I'm tempted to try and recreate something like this at home."
"Flavor-wise, this is very clean and the hops, from New Zealand, are more pronounced than most other pale ales. Bitterness is there but not in excess. The same can be said of the spicy bite of the hops. I appreciate the pine flavors, although it isn't entirely noticeable. So, like I said in the beginning, I like these beers, including the Harvest pale ale, but it's simply not extraordinary enough for me to laud it. The bottom line is that it's good, but it's not distinguishable enough from Sierra Nevada's regular Pale Ale."
"Not sure if this suffered due to a lack of freshness, but it was a pale imitation of the Northern Hemisphere, which I loved. Hoppiness was not there, and it was lacking in carbonation. not bad, but a little disappointing."
"Pint glass pour and I am met with an amber colored ale with a white head and nice lacing. Very malty aroma with orange peel, lemon zest and an odd rubber-like smell. The taste has a big malty flavor with some subtle grapefruit in the background. Bitter aftertaste lingers with a slight citrus splash at the end of the swallow. Easy drink at 6.7% but the taste got tiresome for me. The New Zealand hops just don't agree with my buds too much. A good beer, just not something I will seek out again."
"Pours orangey amber with a thick rocky head of foam and nice lacing. Aroma is musky citrus, pine, tropical fruit, and bready malts. Taste is big on hoppy, with resiny pine and grapefruit rind. Bitterness is big upfront, with some bisuity, caramel malts coming through in the middle. Finish is sharp juicey grapefruit. A bit of gingerbread spice comes through as well. Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and creamy."
"From my experience these fresh hop ales are really hit and miss. Although freshness is often paramount, I have had some with a couple months on them that are still really good. Others, including this one, are just average IPAs."
"A must try for every hop head."
"This a luxurious beer worthy to seek and find"
"Pours a deep copper amber with a huge foamy off white head. Nose is citrus hops , balanced though by an earthy undertone, piney, and hints of caramel malts. Sip reveals a very smooth/easy drinking IPA, bitter at first with a large malt character on the palatte to follow. A dry, crisp, pleasently bitter finish. On the heavier end of a medium mouthfeel, full bodied and well carbonated. This is a great tasting beer, and I'm convinced Sierra Nevada makes some damn good IPAs."
"D - I think this one is easy enough to drink but there are way better fresh hop choices out there. I may be in the minority here, but that's what I think!"
"Drink- I like the northern a little bit better but this was still a good brew from SN. The do IPAS and PA's pretty damn good."
"D = Very drinkable. Would have liked more aroma, but this was very light and drinkable, wish I would have tried it fresh."
"Nice flavor although mostly subtle but overall a nice flavor. I had trouble getting any real strong aroma and it is not overpoweringly bitter although the balance is noticeably tipped to that side for an easy drinking IPA."
"This beer pours a glowing copper color, with a thick frothy slightly off white head. The aroma smells of sweet biscuit malt and citrus hops. The taste is sweet, with interesting hop flavor and bitterness characteristics. The hop flavor is kind of piney, and citrusy. The mouthfeel is medium light, and overall is very drinkable."
"Overall impression: A very ""busy"" beer, but it works just fine. Enjoyable stuff."
"Overall I ignored getting this for the longest time since it was marked for 10 dollars and than 8. Figured the hops would fade finding it marked down to 6 but it's just as tasty and hoppy as ever. One of the better SN beers I had."
"Orange-copper pour with a big off-white head that fades to great lacing. Wet pine aroma with a healthy amount of orange peel. Loads of pine, grapefruit, and orange peel flavor. Nutty, toasty, sweet malts. Little bit of black pepper. Oily medium-full body."
"D- I really like these fresh hop brews and this one did not disappoint."
"Holy cow what an awesome beer. With over 900 reviews I'll spare the repetition of color and smell and that nonsense. Wet hop ales have got to be some of my favorites, especially when they are done correctly. And I have yet to find a better one (bottled none the less) than Sierra Nevada. DRINK THIS BEER!"
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma is dominated by citrus and bread notes. The flavor is more of the same, with a lot of bready malt along with some caramel malt. The hop flavors I get are orange and pine, with orange being the most prevalent. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, fresh citrus hops and a small pine like hint. In the taste, pine hops and nice malt backing. A hop bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry hoppy aftertaste. Nice fresh hop and balanced."
"D: Not a session by definition, but a really nice AIPA. Not overly complex, but this is easy to drink. I would have this again and would search it out."
"Upfront the beer is malty, with some grain, and then a citrusy grapefruit burst in the center with a grassy bitter finish. It has a resiny stick, and is highly quaffable. The fine balance of biscuity malt and bittersweet citrus makes it intriguing and delicious"
"O: High drinkability. Fantastic IPA"
"With the balance of sweet & bitter here, this is almost in DIPA territory for me -- the malt is very assertive, coming through loud & clear to make itself known. Not bad, a little too sweet for me to love it, but I'll have no problem finishing this big ol' bottle here."
"24oz bottle. Pours a murky dark amber color with a medium-sized thick head. Some lacing throughout. Aroma of hops, pine and a slight citrusy orange. Taste is a smooth flavor of hops. Nicely balanced and not in your face. Some roasted malts as well as some caramel. Slight bitter aftertaste. Pretty drinkable and tasty."
"great drinkabiltiy, not overly hopped or spiced, very pleasant. With the high abv you have to be aware that combined with the drinkability factor you could be looking at a nutty evening."
"Not an aggressive or heavily hopped beer but a very smooth and elegant one. Would certainly drink another."
"Imagine the normal Sierra Nevada Pale Ale more refined and flavors added. This is what you get. There is a very good balance between the amount of hops and flavors."
"great beer with big aroma. one of my favorite offerings from sierra nevada. i just love the nose you get on this beer. very aromatic and highly drinkable with a nice bitterness that doesnt hide the hop taste. i could drink these all day long on a hot day."
"Super drinkable!"
"A long pour from a fat double beer bottle produces a rust colored beer with good carbonation. Taste is delicious with pungent piney hops which cover up a higher level of alcohol which can be sensed. Has a distinct clean taste, but retains much of the same quality and creamy mouthfeel I've come to love from Sierra Nevada."
"MF & D- mouthfeel and drinkability are good, although I could not drink these all night because it is moderately thick for this style of beer."
"Bottle: Poured a light orangey color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of medium dry floral hops is pleasant enough. Taste is also dominated by floral hops with a floral undertones and a caramel malt backbone that is quite hidden in the mix. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well done though I was expecting a more prominent roles for the hops."
"D- highly drinkable! This is one of my favorite seasonal offerings from SN, I always make sure to purchase multiple bottles whenever I come across it."
"Overall: Yet another solid offering from Sierra Nevada. I would recommend trying this one."
"was last year. Taste more than less like a little more hopped up SNPA."
"An interesting and delicious IPA from Sierra Nevada. It's definitely worth picking up for its unique hop flavors."
"Pours a clear honey amber with a giant foamy head that lasts and leaves great lacing. The smell is only OK, with bread yeast,citrus hops,and somewhat earthy. The taste is a blast of bitter hops followed by citrus flavors,bread yeast,and roasted malt. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing very well. This is another great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Drinkability: Solid, that mouth puckering hop bite would make chugging down a bunch of them tough, but definitely had no problems getting through the bottle."
"Lots of very fresh hops, but not as much sweet exotic fruits as I had expected."
"Drinkability - This is an interesting beer. The fresh hops add a unique characteristic to this beer. Lots of fresh citrus bite as well as spicy zip in the hop department. Sweet and bready malts add a great balance. It's not something I would want to drink regularly, but I'm glad that I tried it. Fairly good drinkability, although one bottle was plenty."
"D: good and drinkable"
"A highly drinkable brew, it is is shame it is only seasonal and not sold in six packs. Would definitely get this one again."
"Notes: Its on the high side of the sliding beer price scale. Money per value I'd put this on the probably not list for any regularity. That being said it is a kick ass beer and will pick one up when the piggy bank is full."
"In the IPA family, this is the clean cut yet laid-back uncle: Tastes are clean, refined, refreshing and subtle which make this beer a very enjoyable spring/summer drink."
"Taste- lemon & orange with pine. Taste lingers."
"I don't know how I've managed to avoid drinking this beer for so long, but I feel a strong to go buy a lot more to make up for lost time. Worth seeking out."
"This is my second bottle of this and it really was a worth while purchase. Next time I'm heading south for more beer it will definitely be on my shopping list."
"Overall I like it. Very drinkable, quenches a hop craving but isn't a palate killer. Love fresh hops"
"Nice carbonation, dry finish, medium bodied, worth trying again. I just wish this beer was either more complex, or bolder."
"D: The beer is packed with flavors of hops and isn't that difficult to drink because it's not overly bitter. I definitely want to try this again because the fresh hops impart a unique flavor."
"Pours a deep amber color with a tanish, thin head. The smell is faint, at least from this bottle. I've had other bottles with a stronger hop smell. The first sip is soft. There is a hint of a citrus fruit, not sure which. Maybe some apricot as well. The end of the sip is bitter as the hops are strong. This is an older bottle, so perhaps the wet hop has aged a little, but it is still delicious. This is one of the best IPAs I've had. Highly recommended."
"Orange yellow in color. Scent is pine and lemon peel. Has a bit of a resinous mouthfeel. Taste is similar to the scent. I normally prefer IPAs with a more citrus profile but this was tasty for a change up. In my opinion not as tasty as their Wet Hop but overall a satisfying brew. I could have a few of these in one sitting no problem."
"Just because its not a juggernaut in the taste department does not mean it tastes bad. I would try this beer again."
"The finish is as you should expect; sensationally refreshing, somehow very smooth and calm, with a fresh ans short finish. This I would enjoy with anything grilled or fried, all sorts of pub food, big strong cheeses and beef stew."
"Sierra Nevada does it right. Go Chico!"
"Pours a beautiful rich golden amber hue. Color reminds me of summer afternoons. Transperancy somewhat cloudy and hazy. Waterfall lacing on the glass. Smells of tropical fresh hops and very pleasing to the nose. This beer has just the rite amount of hops to my liking. A very ballanced bitterness. Im so used to cascade hops that i can taste and detect the flavors in these exotic new zealand hops. Upon first taste i detected hints of lilikoi(passion fruit). This beer tastes like hawaii. This brew has an excellent mouthfeel. Very clean and fresh. Ballanced carbonation and tingly to the tounge. This beer is super drinkable. One of my favs of 2010. This particular beer holds centimental value to me because it uses new zealand hops like steinlager, my staple in hawaii."
"Update: 2011 Bottling tasted 4/5/2011..Taste is a bit more hoppy and seems less balanced? Hops are very pine-forward this year, the resinous oils stick to the tongue, finishes bitter. Downgrading the overall from 4.5 to 4.0."
"Poured a golden orange with a one-finger head which settled to a coating. Lacing was abundant and lasting. Nose was citrus and pine with some floral notes and some sugary sweetness. Taste was some citrus up-front but a heavy kick of sweet bready malts and only mild bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with little hop bite. Carbonation is moderate and appropriate. The alcohol is well hidden. This is a nice well-balanced IPA I would seek out again absolutely."
"Dr. Certainly! Very easy going beer. A very, very good beer."
"the use of fresh hops isnt greatly noticeable, also a variety of hops not too common in the U.S. were used in the beer as the hops were from new zealand. on a side note, i just harvested my own hops and i can only hope my ipa turns out as good as i am not the master brewer yet and this is my first time with whole cones."
"22 ounce bomber. I've always liked the idea of Sierra Nevada's Harvest line, beers brewed with ingredients from specific places. 2010 vintage. I really like the label on this bottle. Reminds me a little bit of a map from the 1600s. Poured into a basic glass. I like the head retention on this beer, it looks almost oily. The color of the brew is burnt orange, almost like the crayon color of my youth. Light aroma that I'm guessing may be due to the beer's age - the website states this was bottled way back in April. Interesting flavor profile. More malty than I was expecting, but again I'm betting this is due to the age. As my palate adjusts I get more hop character in the nose, but it's still not as much as I was expecting. Gets better the more I drink it. Pretty easy to drink really. The body and flavor of this beer is just really well balanced and quite delicious. It's a nice beer that straddles the line between their Pale Ale and their Toperdo. Nicely done."
"Beer is pretty thick with a nice back palate bitterness. Its not malty but it quite heavy for an IPA. Almost chewy on the palate. Its good and I believe I've had this beer for the past several years when it comes out. Definitely not my favorite IPA and I couldn't drink it everyday, but its decent."
"The drinkabilty was high for a hop ale because I drank another one when in most cases one hop ale is enough for me and then I am ready to fix my pallet with something less bitter."
"very drinkable."
"A pretty good IPA, even if the citrus components' hemispherical origins are lost on me. And the retail cost of the bomber form of this beer is a bit outlandish - I saw it at a grocery store for 9 bucks. Good thing I found it on tap, on a cheap pint night..."
"Very powerfully hopped in bitterness, flavor and aroma. And they were used fresh within 24 hours off the hop bines. Also New Zealand has very strict rules about organic farming, so it is almost guaranteed they used organic hops. Interesting beer. Although I could go for something a bit different now. I don't know that I would want to drink this all night long."
"This is a good summertime IPA. Great depth, great feel, refreshing. I'm going to pick up another few of these."
"I had a few, I liked it, will have again. SN makes good beer."
"Notes: Wow, I'm really going to have to reevaluate Sierra Nevada. I guess I just grew tired of SNPA in my younger days which led me to avoid SN offerings altogether (except for Bigfoot Barleywine). This tastes nothing like other SN beers I've tried, and it's surprsingly refreshing. A complete hop-bomp, but the hops don't wreck your palate like a Stone Ruination (I was actually going to the store to pick up Stone Ruination when I saw this). After Life-n-Limb and Estate, I'm a Sierra Neveda re-convert - this is a great beer."
"D: Very drinkable beer with an outstanding taste. Would pair well with a burger or a steak."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is rich and smooth and lacks the bite of most American IPA. This is reasonably drinkable but certainly not the best IPA for $5 a bomber."
"Salud!"
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Pours red-orange with a one finger off-white head. Maintains nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of hops and nutty notes. The flavor was of malt, nutty, and a slight hop flavor. It was light on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew that was very smooth going down. Giving it dangerous drinkability. This is one of the first IPAs where I have encountered a nutty flavor that wasn't upsetting the beer. It was actually kind of welcomed with this one."
"Pours a copper-orange colour with big white head. Great head retention and lacing. Smell is of herbal and citrus hops. Taste has a lot of citrus hops, with a little bit of bitterness. Nice bready malt too. This seems to be closer to an APA than an IPA I think, but still good either way. Very nice drinking beer, I could have a lot of this."
"Overall; is this a beer worth having? Of course. There are very few breweries doing what SN is doing with their fresh hop, and Southern Hemisphere is a great way to see what eventually might be. The whole Tom Friedman thing, hops from one corner of the globe being in another within a week of harvest, etc. But still, when it's all said and done, as an IPA, compared to the field, it's a middle-of-the-road effort, through no fault of the brewer."
"Drinks: delicately. Fresh Hop Harvest is all about subtlety. The hops don't smack you around, but rather settle in, like an old friend."
"Pours a hazy gold/amber with a creamy white head, two fingers deep. Smells better than expected: juicy, a little malt, but mostly sweet hops. Hints of pine linger as well. Pretty good, yet standard aroma. Surprisingly thin body and not much malt presence, some sips taste almost watered down (that could be from drinking too many DIPAs). Nice, mellow hop presence. A little citrus is a nice contrast from the aroma. This is a decent IPA, well done from Sierra Nevada. For a widely available, seasonal beer, this is worth picking up if you need a quick hop fix. There are definitely better one's out there, but this will do just fine. Definitely a good one for friends who are curious about hops, but aren't ready for DIPAs. Excellent for hot days."
"D - I would say that almost all of SN's regular hoppy offerings are better: Pale Ale, Estate, Torpedo, and Celebration..."
"D- Would have given this a 4 if it did not have such an end-to-end bite. I like it- but it's not an 'every day' IPA."
"SNBC does IPAs well - they are all unique, and each one packs a nice hop punch. Certainly drinkable, but the end of the 24 oz gets a little challenging. But tasty to be sure."
"Pours a medium copper color with a floral hop presence that hits right now.. Tight head that has some staying power.. Right amount of carbonation to give you maximum hop aroma.. What else can I say My opinion this is the best beer they make.. Run don't walk and stock up.."
"I like this."
"This beer was a decent example of the style. Nice hop character, fairly easy to drink."
"D - Although I was expecting a more pungent nose, Southern Hemisphere is a solid fresh hopped IPA that remains nice and bitter throughout and boasts a great, full mouthfeel. Drinkable? Yep."
"D: I really like this one. Would definitely buy again."
"for me this is another solid entry from the people at sierra nevada"
"D - Quite drinkable where I have no issue taking down the 24oz bottle solo."
"D - Awesome. Another fine beer from SN."
"D - I wouldn't have a problem drinking this all night, and it's especially good for a warm day if you want something fairly interesting on the nose but straightforwardly refreshing when you drink."
"Cheers!"
"Worth the $5 to give it a try but not worth repeating."
"D- Really easy to drink, the alcohol is masked well, not overly bitter, not too heavy. Not the best I've ever had, but it is definitely worth trying."
"Poured a clear, amber-orangeish color. The carbonation bubbles were larger than average and active up front. The head was thick, creamy, and sticky. It retained itself quite nicely throughout the whole beer with heavy lacing as well. Definitely strong hop aromas as expected along with some citrus and pine notes. The initial hop burst is quite powerful but it seemed to mellow out pretty quickly into a comforting bitterness that was pretty pleasant. This is not and APA where you're done and go, ""I really thought I'd get more hops out of that one"". Not here. I'd say a low to medium carbination with a nice medium-bodied feel. No really noticable hints of alcohol. Very smooth an easy to drink. Expect powerful hops that are balanced well with the malt flavors. I expected nothing else from Sierra. These guys are pros. Well done"
"pours a transparent copper color with extra large off white frothy head that remains, good lacing and flat carbonation. very fruity citrusy hop smell thats very potent. taste is much the same but much more mellow than the smell which was kind of disappointing. very clean dry and smooth, with a medium body. light creamy sticky texture and a moderate bitter finish. very long flavor duration. well worth a try."
"Pours a nice fairly deep copper, but with little head and no lacing. Very nice scent, a great malt backbone; interesting hop aroma that has a lot of sweetness as well as bitterness; maybe sugary. Nice flavor, a deep malt with a great hop flavor and aftertaste; sweet initial flavor, even with the hops with a very keep bitterness on the tongue after. Goes down quite well."
"D: You could down these all down long, very sessionable."
"Other Notes - if you like your ipa's towards teh floral end with some euro hop flair in there, pick this one up, if you like urs citrus and pine then you may want to pass on this one but this is in no way a bad beer infact its still quite good given my disposition towards ipas of this style"
"D: Very much an American IPA given the caramel malt and high level of hops, at the same time, the type of hops provide a non-standard flavor profile. A somewhat unique beer, well worth seeking out."
"D- Slippery and slick with a balance of flavors that showcase the brilliantly citric hops"
"Maybe it was the hot day, or just a craving for a good IPA. But SV hit the mark on this. By far a tasty brew."
"Flavor and aroma are filled with a variety of hop notes. The malt provides some balance while still letting the hops strut their stuff. It really straddles the line between IPA and APA, but no matter what you call it, it works. ABV is right in the drinkability wheelhouse. This one's a big time winner. Makes me want to fly to New Zealand every April."
"D - I could enjoy multiple of these in a session."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination making this a pretty nice drinking beer overall, Definitely worth a grab if you can get it."
"Drinkability: A very good value at $4 for a bomber. A nice alternative when you are burned out on SNPA and this is available."
"D-well balanced, good malt profile with a great hop presence. hops are the showcase but the malt profile makes itself pronounced with an inviting lingering hop bitterness at the finish."
"Well done, very well balanced, I am getting more. One of the better IPAs I've had in a while. Goes down very easy as well. Both refreshing and flavorful at the same time."
"Had a pint at Mad Mex. Pours an amber, copper color. Smells kind of off. Not sure if the tap lines were clean. Smells like vanilla; not getting any hop aroma for a wet hop beer. Ok: after checking other reviews it turns out what I might be getting is simply what was put into the beer. Strong grapefruit aroma present. The taste is just like the aroma. Strong grapefruit-like. More malty than hoppy or bitter. Mouthfeel not good. Tastes a little sour. I'm not really digging this one at all. I think either I had a bad batch or I just don't like this one. A rarity of a Sierra brew if what I had was the real deal. Would much rather prefer their fall wet harvest ale. Note: once I try this one again I'll re-review."
"Quite a nice well balanced beer"
"Drinkability is ok, I'm still not a fan of the American IPA style, and I was hoping SN was going to make a nice and light summer beer that was balanced, but I guess not. Drank the first one, couldn't finish the bomber."
"D - Pretty well-balanced, exactly what I'd expect from the makers of one of the favorite pale ales in the country. Interesting flavor and a smooth drink."
"Drinkability is exceptional. Wish this was around all the time."
"D: It is a very good pale ale. The flavors are great. Just the heaviness of the beer takes away from the drinkability."
"Thanks Sierra Nevada."
"2012 note: had the 2012 version and it's pretty consistent with the other years that I’ve had; I notice more herbals notes and toasted grains in the flavor, but that combo seems to be part of a refined balance that keeps this beer exceptionally smooth for such a hoppy beer. I found the 2012 bottle just as enjoyable as the other years."
"Perhaps I'm just in a good mood, but this sure strikes me as a darned nice IPA. Marketed as a beer with NZ hops and it's worth a mental note if that is part of what makes this brew fine."
"D-a really refreshing and not too overpowering IPA from SN; its clean finish and hops flavor is quite nice; the alcohol is virtually not detectable and it's just a nice summer IPA"
" A stellar brew, Thank you Sierra Nevada."
"Pours a clear deep amber with a thumb of cream-colored froth on top, which leaves some thick lacing as it dies away. The nose is citrus hops, orange peel, grapefruit, and raisins. Didn't see that last one coming, but I'm not really gonna argue here. The taste is loaded with hops, showcasing pine and sharp grapefruit flavors. The malt backbone of caramel and toffee comes through pretty well too. The body is, at best, a light medium, with a moderately active carbonation and a smooth, dry finish. A solid IPA from the venerable brewery out Californey way."
"Pure and simple, Sierra Nevada makes wonderfully crafted ales. Southern Hemisphere is no exception being a wonderful treat. I may just have to buy several more bottles before they disappear!"
"Drinkability: A refreshing IPA; well balanced and elegant, very drinkable"
"2010 bottle picked up State Spirits in Taylors, SC. Poured into a tall tulip glass. Very dark amber orange. A massive off-white head billows on top and cascades down the side of my glass. Big scents of grapefruit, pine, lemon cleaner, and toast. The mouth is thinner than I'd like. Maybe all the carbonation rushed to the head (?). Big bitter bold hops right away. Not scalding, just bitter. Drying a touch on the backend. Sweetness is not as prominent as I'd like either. This wasn't bad, but it's not one of SN's best."
"D - pretty good, though missing some nose and a little one-sided in that its straight grassy hops and not much else."
"Overall, this is another good hoppy ale from Sierra Nevada, but it's not in their top tier. The sugars are a bit too pronounced versus the hops for me to make this a regular. That being said, it is definitely tasty, and at the price point, you'd be silly not to try it."
"Poured into a tulip. This has a nice amber color and about two fingers of head that dissipates to leave some lacing. This smells great. Lots of citrus in the nose and the hops hit pretty well. The taste in full of piny hops and a citrus flavor leaves with this finish. Reminds of candied orange. it has a nice malt flavor that isn't completely hidden by the hops. It has a nice medium body that makes it very drinkable. The 6.7 ABV helps makes it a pretty drinkable beer."
"Overall a very good beer. Nice and big and hoppy. Another great one from SN."
"Generally not a fan of the American style ""pine sap"" IPA's, but this sounded intriguing to me when I first read the concept of this beer and I'm pleased with my decision to buy some. While the type of hop profile one would expect to encounter in this one is certainly there, it is a bit muted and a bit diluted with whatever hop varietal from New Zealand is in there. I thoroughly enjoyed this and will look for it again."
"Comes in big bottle shaped like the ones in New Zealand ( Emersons etc) to tie in with the New Zealand hops. Pours brown gold with a big head and a lovely hop nose. This beer is sorta like a cross between their IPA and the ESB. The hops taste fresh but not overwhelming the malt. Well crafted and easy to drink this is a great addition to the Sierra stable"
"Nice medium mouthfeel with decent coating and smoothness. Easily drinkable, a very good IPA without the huge price-tag. Worth seeking out, I'm happy I had it even though I paid $4.79 for the 24 oz. I'd probably pay $7.99 for it, so seek it out."
"Cheers!"
"The mouthfeel is light bodied despite the levelof sweetness. The finish is dry, with an average amount of carbonation."
"Super-enjoyable, and especially refreshing in the waning days of spring (already feeling like summer in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere). Was it worth shipping the hops all the way across the Pacific? Considering that it doesn't stand out distinctly from S.N.'s own beers that utilize U.S.-grown hops, maybe not, but hey, at worst they've released another damn solid beer. Complaining about that would be so much stuff and nonsense."
"D: I always pick up a few bottles of this because it's a good price. It's no Sculpin, but it's good drinking."
"2010 Edition. A shining copper color with a fluffy beige head. Subtle yet solid aroma that's piney and earthy. A very well balanced beer, less bitter than I remember last year's being. Notes of pine and dark berry fruit early on in the glass. As it warms, it becomes a little more chocolaty. A medium body offers a comforting creaminess. A beer to look forward to. Well worth picking up."
"The malts really mellow the bitterness to make this a really drinkable IPA."
"D- not bad. I really appreciate torpedo as an ipa. This is still a good brew"
"Drinkabilty depends on how my drain feels about the remainder of this bottle."
"Drinkability: easy to drink this one. I drank this down pretty fast and found myself hankering for another in no time flat. The result was not unlike the SN Estate hopped beers. But the quality was so good, that who could really quibble. Definitely a tasty beer."
"D: Crisp and refreshing. Mouthfeel is a bit light."
"Drinkability is solid. It's pushing the upper limits with its ABV, but the alcohol is not noticeable during my tasting."
"The feel of this beer was pretty even and well drinkable with enough character that it was one of my favorite beers of the night. It was quite refreshing and had a nice crisp finish."
"Full, creamy mouthfeel. Nice balance of sweet and bitter flavors."
"I suppose $5.49 for a 24 oz bottle is reasonable, however, the allure of the packaging and concept is the bait you take - different set of colors, but tastes not all that different from the rest of the rubber worms."
"A very good and drinkable ipa."
"Nicely drinkable IPA. It's just SN doing what they do, making good beers and drinkable ones at that."
"The body was decent, full and smooth. Drinkability was good,even though the beer was a bit meh. Overall, not one of SN's better beers, but worth a shot to see if you like it."
"D: Very approachable and drinkable brew. This is a very balance and soft IPA. Hops are not huge and bitterness is not overpowering, but everything is instead very balance. Sierra Nevada has done it again. I can't remember if I liked this beer as much last year, but I am certain to pick up another one of these before summer ends."
"Dark golden color with great carbonation and good clarity. Aroma is typical Sierra citrus with more bitterness than the pale ale and a little more interesting on the hop flavor. A good one when you want an IPA."
"Pours a nice, bright golden amber color with perfect cap of white head, good retention and lacing. Scent is of course hop forward - grassy, floral, piney, earthy and faint citrus. Wonderful fresh dried grain scent. Taste is a nice balanced grassy/floral/earthy/piney/citrus balance, bitter but not scalding to the tounge. Amazingly fresh dreied grain profile, the star of these Fresh/Wet hop beers from SN in my opinion. Medium bodied, slick, somewhat oily and bubbly. I can not stress enough how well SN balances the taste of fresh hops with fresh grains in their beer, wonderful."
"Overall a very nice ale that has so much complexity and flavour. GO FORTH AND DRINK (and drink fresh as this is how this ale is meant to be consumed)."
"Overall you really cannot go wrong with this one. Just a solid nearly perfect pale all around."
"D: Of the two harvest beers from Sierra Nevada, I like this one the least. Still, this is a very good quality American IPA."
"Drinkability: This years batch is very good. I recommend picking up a bottle or two."
"goes down well for a hop-lover. not the most hopped-up beer I have ever had, but the fresh hop flavors are unmistakeably represented in this beer. another strong, strong offering from SN."
"I must say, this is a very refreshing beer on a hot day. It poured and medium brown color, with a tan head. It smelled strongly of hops, with citrus notes present. Initial taste of of hops mixed with notes of orange. I must say this is one amazing beer, I could drink it all day. I got it in the bomber bottle, it was well worth the $5 I paid for it. Im going to get more this afternoon."
"Drinkability - Relatively drinkable. Glad I picked this up from the store. Wasn't too expensive and has a good, unique taste to it."
"6/28/10 Just an additional note. I got to try this on tap at Zeitgeist the other night and was still impressed."
"I bought the 2010 version of this beer a week ago and finally drank it last night. The color is amberish in color with a nice thick head to it. The smell of this beer is intoxicating. Fresh is the first thing that came to my mind. It also has a very nice hoppy aroma to it. I couldn't any longer so I took a nice big gulp of this beer and I was not disappointed. It was delicious and refreshing. The flavor is dense with pine and resin flavors, a good malt backbone, all very well balanced. I will be definitely be picking me up a couple more bottles for this weekend!"
"Bought this yesterday...nice new label for the 2010 release. Pours a nice orangish amber color with a nice big head. This smell...This smell is amazing! All I get is fresh hop smell...It's the hoppiness you expect from Celebration, Anniversary, or Torpedo...but like all of them combined. This bottle is so fresh and it shows. The taste is like drinking the offspring of the beers I just wrote about above. The bitterness is not the slightest bit overwhelming and the taste is tasty as hell. I love this beer. The mouthfeel is great and my Russian River glass has some beautiful lacing on it. Great beer."
"For pure value, Sierra Nevada is tough to compete with. That being said, I have come to expect a lot with my love for Torpedo and the original wet hop harvest. Pours extremely nicely with great color, good head and very good lacing. Smell is solid with a lot of straw and earth. First sip was underwhelming. As it warmed, the taste improved but never hit a high note. Definitely a value for the price but lacking, in my opinion, in its overall flavor and balance. I like my IPAs big and that is not a strength of this brew. Well worth the price of admission but unlikely to buy more."
"D: Good overall, but I do not think this is out of the world. Good, and it is clear that it is very well put together. But it does seem to be a little one note. Good, not great."
"Drinkability: Its a hell of a well made IPA. I'm not that familiar with or used to the hops used here though. I like it, but I prefer a strongly citrusy and piney hoppiness over the earthy and spicy hops that dominate here. I'll have to try the Northern Hemisphere again to compare."
"Drinkability- Pretty damned tasty brew especially for a fresh hop that has been shipped halfway around the world. The beer is fairly well balanced and super easy drinking. This is the first Fresh Hop I've had from Sierra Nevada and it probably won't be the last."
"Picked this up at Tops Liquors while at a conference in Phoenix. Clear copper, amber pour with nice caramel colored head and great lacing. A bit of a subdued nose from what I was expecting, but definitely complex and pleasant. Lots of caramel and vanilla with a nice malty sweetness and earthy undertones of fresh hops. The flavor is all fresh hops. Initially there's very little evidence of the sweetness that was present in the nose. This really lives up to the fresh hop ale name. It's easily the freshest hop flavor I've ever had. The caramel malt sweetness peaks its head out on the finish, but it's quickly overtaken by the hoppy bitterness. Very drinkable beer. I'm on my second bomber! Sierra Nevada does it again!"
"This poured a clear copper with moderate light tan head. It smelled like pine and citrus hops with a little earthy caramel malt. It tasted like earthy pine hops with copper and some caramel malt. It was slightly thick with a little carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this wasn't too different from any other Sierra Nevada pale ale, which isn't bad but it's not exciting. Good body and easy to drink. The earthiness from fresh hopping was subtle but noticeable. I personally prefer a cleaner and sweeter hops (Lagunitas?)."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beer has an almost sticky medium body. The beers carbonation works well with the beer. No trace of alcohol is noted in the mouthfeel. This is just a well crafted super easy drinking beer."
"D: I'd really like a bit more complexity out of this, but it's a decently drinkable APA. (NZPA?, given the source of the hops)"
"D - A bit on the hoppy and strong abv side for a regular pale ale, but the fresh hops definitely shine on this one."
"D-Can't really notice the 6.7%. It goes down very nicely. I always look forward to these fresh hop ales every sixth months. They aren't overly complex or the hoppiest IPAs on the market (kudos to Sierra Neveda for sticking with whole cone hops), but they are just solid easy drinking ales. Always worth picking up a bomber or two when it first comes out."
"Summary - If you like Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale, you'll definitely like this one. I get a lot more hoppyness from this and that's a good thing. Sierra Nevada has yet to disappoint me."
"More than makes up for the Glissade Golden Bock from a few weeks back. Well done SN."
"Drinkability: Interesting and a well made IPA. Easy to session, although I don't think I'd go out of my way to seek it out again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, It's a very nice beer. I really liked the caramel maltiness it had which I wasn't expecting in it. Really loved the aroma to it."
"D: A well made, drinkable APA."
"Drinkability is good. Well-rounded beer."
"overall: wow what an idea for a beer its so cool that Sierra Nevada continues to innovate I am going to say the idea is better then the beer in 2010 but maybe 2011 will be off the hook, I will try it for sure!"
"If your in the mood for hops and you can get this fresh this is the beer for you. 24oz of goodness, I should have grabed 2."
"drinkability - refreshing and smooth, some bitterness, mildly complex, good session beer"
"From the 2010 batch no. O-113-216-08. Sampled on May 18, 2010. It pours a nice looking golden-amber with a long-lasting, fluffy light tan head that remains steday throughout. On first whiff there is an anticipated note of hops but there are also blended malts in the aroma which balances the scent out. The hops burst open in the taste and take over the entire brew. The texture tends to have a creamy feel to it. Well-hopped but also well balanced and likeable."
"Nothing outstanding but completely flawless just the same."
"Pours an amber color with a frothy tan head. The aroma has some juicy caramel malt upfront, along with some piney and citrusy hops, fruity esters, biscuit, and some alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with piney, citrusy and floral hops, caramel and biscuit, fruity esters, minerals, and a little alcohol. The mouthfeel is moderate and drinkability is high. Nice pale ale here, nothing exceptional or particularly memorable but a fresh hop beer in the spring is a welcome change of pace from all the blonde ales and witbeers."
"M- Dry, medium body that might be a bit thick for my liking considering the style. Nice carbonation keeps it feeling lively and refreshing."
"Overall, its tasty and refreshing. The hops are a bit strong for me, but not terribly so."
"d-very drinkable despite the higher than normal abv."
"This is a great IPA, very drinkable and the flavors are well rounded making for a smooth, almost velvet-like brew. Definitely recommend giving this one a try!"
"D - This beer offers fresh fresh hopy goodness without being overly bitter, I love the fresh hop profile of this beer, it really comes out great in both smell & taste. I'd definitely buy this one again, very good value. A great brew from a great brewery. Recommended. Cheers!"
"Taste on the other hand is all hops! Nice rich bitterness but well balanced with a light sweetness. It's very smooth and rich with light caramel notes."
" Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, but has nice viscosity due to the oily fresh hops. The finish is dry and very refreshing. Overall, this beer is very easy to drink, and can be enjoyed on any occasion. Another great effort from the guys in Chico."
"D - Very high. Refreshing but not necessarily my favorite."
"A moderate but smooth mouthfeel really helps this one go down. Overall, a solid APA but with fresher hops than what most of us get this time of year. I think Sierra is on to something with the NZ hops."
"It is a very enjoyable and quite drinkable APA, although for the term ""fresh hop"" being in the name I was expecting a bit more upfront hoppiness."
"Very drinkable and over a very good beer."
"Notes: It´s a nice brew, and quite recommendable but it does not feel that fresh, at least not in a particular way. And compared to other ""fresh"" hop ales - I dunno, Great Divide for example, this feels a bit unremarkable."
"I really enjoyed this one, I wish I could have it fresh all year."
"Intense bitter earthy hops up front along with some sweet citrus fruit notes. Hints of grapefruit, mango, orange and lemon peel along with some pine needle and floral notes. Decent malt backbone provides a nice balance without diminishing the bitterness of the hops. Smooth and creamy mid palate with slight alcohol warmth, making this beer very quaffable. Slightly sweet bone dry finish."
"D: really enjoyed this beer, been getting into PA's, IPA's, and DIPA's lately. Good offering from sierra nevada"
"D - easy drinking, full flavored pale ale. This is a great beer but not one that blows my socks off. I would pick this up again in the future but won't go nuts trying to seek it out."
"i always look forward to getting my hands on the SN Harvest beers. while its nice getting fresh hop pale ale in the middle of spring, it'd be nice if they tried making an IPA with those New Zealand hops."
"Taste, different for Sierra Nevada, the whole cone Cascade hop thing isn't done, its a lighter feel than their other two versions of Harvest Ale. Still hoppy, but far from the hop bomb of their other harvest ales. More lemony and zesty like the aforementioned summer offering. Some neat stuff, but my least favorite of the 3 harvests. Great price though."
"Drinkability: At under 7% ABV this is a fairly drinkable hoppy West Coast style beer with fresh hops. I love if and it was pretty fun to take down a 22oz of this stuff. I just wish the price was a little lower so I could justify a second purchase."
"2010 batch from the bottle. It pours a clear auburn hue; once in the glass it's topped by a sustaining bone-colored cap. Hops are strong on the nose, herbal and earthy in character, faintly fruity and tropical, more malty and bready as it warms. On the tongue it's a harmonious blend of malts and hops, initially earthy and herbal, then bready and malty. Flavors of tropical fruit and bitter orange peel are faintly detected before a firm herbal bitterness picks up in the finish. It's medium-bodied, light yet substantial, and drying from start to finish. Another solid if somewhat underwhelming batch of this beer."
"Very tasty, it lacks in complexity, but what it does, it does well."
"Rated as a Pale Ale this one is really top-notch. In years past I thought the hopping was more in line with an IPA, but the 2010 seems more subdued and falls nicely into the Pale Ale category. Really superb, and the New Zealand hops are a great change of pace."
"D: A little bit dry overall; something I don't normally mind, but with the hop taste not being particularly overassertive, not something I keep reaching back for."
"A nice beer and well priced, but I believe I'd just as soon have a couple on Sierra Nevada Pale Ales (at least I kept it in the SN family)."
"D: Enjoyable. A good easy drink that would be well served to be drunk in the sun."
"D: In terms of sessionability, I would say this is a winner, even at 6.7% a.b.v. I had a 24 oz. bottle and enjoyed it, but despite it being a really solid A.P.A., it just did not scream ""repeat buy"" to me at $5.99 a bottle."
"enjoyable beer, i really liked it, but for a limited release deal i was expecting something...more. good either way though."
"D - A great hoppy ale. Drank a bomber and could easily drink another."
"D=3.5 I think because of the sweetness It make have been somewhat filling at the time. Good beer though, well balanced and lets not forget fresh!"
"Drinkability: This beer goes down quite easily. It definitely has that Sierra Nevada style to it...but the hops are definitely kicked up a notch. Overall I'd say I'm impressed."
"The Southern Hemisphere Ale pours a golden/orange color with a pillowy white head and lot of lacing align the glass. Smell is subtle, but refreshing. Lots of malts and citrus make up the nose as well as the palate. The quaff also brings out a big hop profile for an APA, with little alcohol noted. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. Drinkability is high in my opinion. A very smooth and tasty beer that is extremely sessionable."
"Pours a clear, dark copper color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of fresh hops, pine, sweet malt, hint of dark citrus (plum/fig), alcohol, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. There is an average bitterness level for a APA. Tastes of fresh hops, sweet malt, slight yeast, citrus, alcohol, and slight caramel. Overall, a good body, blend, complexity, and aroma."
"Although highly rated, I'm always a bit surprised this beer doesn't get more love. Nice, solid malt with moderate sweetness and a delightful fresh hops flavor without any green leafy notes often found in fresh-hopped beers. ABV is well concealed and the beer is quite (perhaps too easy, given the generous bottle size)to drink."
"D: Very nice product from Sierra Nevada. Superior to the Harvest Wet Hop I had recently IMO."
"Fine frosty for sure, the fatty 24oz bottle will serve me well this evening as I sip on this nicely done 6.7% brew."
"Poured a deep amber with a large off-white head that lasted and produced good lacing. Good earthy hoppy aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Moderate to heavy balanced hoppy flavor with a moderate smooth bitter finish of moderate duration. Good drinkable brew."
"Arrived with a finger of foamy medium-tan head exploding with CO2 bubbles and good retention. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a cool mintiness like spearmint. Mouthfeel was medium with a definite hop bite, but unlike the usual citrus flavor, this was slightly grassy and minty. On the mint front, the finish had a definite minty cleanliness. Seek this out!"
"T- It has a very crisp hop taste. It's very bitter, but there is a sweetness to it that balances it out. Truly exceptional."
"Notes: This, along with SN Harvest Wet Hop show that SN can produce solid artisan beers as well as excellent session beers like SNPA."
"D: There is basically no reason to stop drinking this one. Find it on draft if you can."
"O: Very fresh taste, obviously the goal. Really nice aroma. Would do it again."
"This beer goes down easily. So many new and interesting flavors with each drink. I'll look for it earlier next year and drink it fresher, if I can."
"Notes: This beer is absolutely outstanding. I really enjoyed the play between malt sweetness and the solid hop bitterness."
"Wasn't New Zealand once a British colony?"
"24 oz bottle to glass. This was the 2009, 2nd release. Reading the label, I notice this isn't a wet-hopped beer, the hops are dried in New Zealand and flown to the brewery. I still want to try a wet hop sometime. In any case, color is a cloudy honey-copper color. Smells rich and inviting but not as much citrusy hop as I thought. Taste is full flavored ale, strong on the hops, but I'm not good at telling apart different kinds of hops. Not sure I'm really getting the difference in the 'fresh' part, maybe if I tried side by side with a standard SN I could tell. Overall a solid beer though."
"Poured the deep amber that you'd expect from Sierra, smell was a bit grassy and malty if that makes sense. Taste was similar to what'd you expect from Sierra, hoppy, with a nice malty balance, couldn't really differentiate the New Zealend Hops though. I'm excited with what Sierra's doing, by far my favorite microbrewery, and I think whatever they do is solid, good stuff."
"Overall it is a decent beer, but overpriced. I'm not someone who really wants to pay that much just because they went through the exotic process to make this beer."
"Medium-bodied, slighly sticky on the palette. A very smooth drink with an appropriately low amount of carbonation. Extremely drinkable, and a great experience to taste the Southern Hemisphere hop varieties."
"Hops are lingering in a good way. beer is medium bodied and smooth. Aftertaste has a small bite to it. Would drink several of these. Another nice showing by SN."
"M&D: the carbonation is very very soft indeed, without unwanted artificial CO2, and the body stays decently moderate as far as the alc. is taken into account. All in all, this is a delicious pale ale designed to quaff."
"Wow what a beer! Probably one of the best APA's I have had to this date! Very refreshing and with such a wonderful taste and smell I could easily kill a couple of bombers. I cant wait to get my hands on next years!"
"Very drinkable if not sessionable. Not an everyday beer but a very drinkable special selection."
"D: Supremely Drinkable. One of the best beers I've had."
"D - Low because of the aftertaste."
"overall this is a nice offering from SN highlighting southern hemisphere hops as the star of this brew. as i said above, the hops used come off mostly spicy and herbal in contrast to the citrus centric NW hops used in most of the the other SN brews i've sampled prior. although this concoction lacks the wow factor of other hop bombs, i find it interesting, intriguing and recommended to try."
"Pours a nice coppery orange with about 2 fingers of fluffy off-white head. Smell is hoppy and citrusy. A good amount of some orange peel with a hint of grapefruit. Just a faint hint of pine. Taste is nice and bittery citrus up front, with just a hint of malt in the back. Leaves a nice bittery aftertaste, as well. Medium bodied, creamy with good carbonation. A bit dry, but not in a bad way. Drinkability is good. Great for this last hint of nice weather before it gets freezing in a few days."
"As usual, this year's harvest ale is a solid SN offering."
"D: You could easily session this one all night."
"Drinkability was good. A second (if I had one at the time) would have gone down well. Overall a lovely beer."
"A tasty beer overall, but it wasn't quite what I had thought it would be. I wouldn't mind grabbing another bottle for the price though."
"Sierra Nevada delivers again. Hard to say which is better. The Wet Hop or Fresh Hop. Big difference between the two. Always something to look forward to every year. Especially if you like hops but not too much to overpower you. Very well balanced."
"Overall- yeah i know this is a year old or whatever but i said what the hell.... when i mentioned the taste it seemed like the age just blended everything together more. i wanna try the 09 one and compare the two."
"If you like hops, find this beer."
"Drinkablity: Extremely drinkable, tasty and complex with satisfying hop presence."
"SN still fails to disappoint on Pale Ales."
"D: Goes down quickly. I could definitely drink this in larger quantities, and often."
"This is a great beer to show off different hop flavors! It pours a bright copper color, with a thick head which dissipates very quickly. It leaves a nice lacing on the glass as you drink it. Shines a deep copper/red in the light. The smell is all hops. Floral, spicy and herbal, the hops hit you right away. There is a bit of an alcohol bite in the end, and a slight feel of malt sweetness. The taste is, again, all hops. The hops are not overpowering, but there is citrus, flowers and slightly herbal. Nicely balanced. The mouthfeel is light, but thick in a coating sort of way. It's not overly carbonated. Overall, I would say this is a great celebration of hops. It's balanced by a slight malt sweetness on the end. Definitely not a session beer, though!"
"Recommended."
"D- High. Gimme more! Glad I got this bottle, your mileage may vary, but I love it."
"I thought this beer had a great malt-hop balance with good flavors from both elements."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice amber color, with decent carbonation, and a thin head that laced fairly well. The aroma was strikingly different for a Sierra beer; it was obvious that the hops weren't the usual WestCoast Cascade, as the aroma was less citrus and more herbal, woody, and a little grassy. The taste confirmed the herbal/grassy nature of the aroma, with a very dry finish. Medium-bodied, decently carbonated, and again, a very nice dry finish. I would session this beer, but I would prefer a little more citrus/fruity essence in my pale ale. Maybe I've been brainwashed by years of loyalty to the flagship brand."
"I wanted two or three more, this is drinkable and tasty. New Zealand hops deserve a reputation."
"This one will become a regular once a year purchase."
"D- Very drinkable on a warm summer day."
"A vigorous pour provides a cloudy copper color with a thick, fluffy head that slows disappears, leaving quite a bit of lacing on the side of the glass. Bright and clean aroma with light notes of citrus and pine. Generally well-balanced flavor, but definitely skewed toward the bitter end of the spectrum, with flavors of lemon, orange, and spice. The sticky hop bitterness lingers in the aftertaste so that by the bottom of the 24 ounce bottle, the tongue aches. In that regard, there's a limit to how much I could drink in a single sitting, but overall a very enjoyable drinking experience."
"24oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass at 47 degrees. 2009 - 2nd Release indicated on the label. Poured a translucent copper with a rocky, off-white, one inch head and copious tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Head eventually settles into a solid half-inch cap with delicate strands of sticky lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals grapefruit/citrus on a sweet malt backbone. Taste consistent with nose - sweet and malty, with a pleasant citrus current throughout, as well as some floral hops character. Mouthfeel is light- to medium-bodied with a bright background carbonation and a slightly oily texture on the tongue - does not finish clean, but is somewhat palate cleansing nonetheless. Simply delicious - by far one of the best IPAs I've had. Really flavorful without a punch in the face abv. Well worth your time."
"This beer is interesting. The hops have a different flavor to them, which makes this beer worth a try. I like it but it's not the best APA I've had. But it should be tried. I'd like to try it fresher too."
"Goes down rather easy, pleasant. Not a bad drinking beer, would have again."
"Mouthfeel is pleasant, very similar to the US version which is just slightly thicker than SNPA. Easy to drink on this hot, humid, southern day."
"D - Great drinkability. Could do this as a session beer. Everything works together well to create a great beer to drink."
"There's good carbonation on the palate, and enough malt to give it some balance, but clearly the focus is on the mouth-puckering hops. There are herbal flavors that go nicely into the finish, and bitterness pervades from early on, through the middle, and so forth. Rather easy drinking for an IPA."
"D - Very easy drinker. I could almost session this one, the big bottle went down easy. Not quite as hoppy as I would hope for a fresh hop (although it IS hoppy, especially when it warms up), but I'm guessing since this is the first ever beer that's been brewed on site with their own hops and malt, they couldn't load it up with the ingredients. The price of the bottle also reflects this. I understand what they're doing here, and I'm glad they did it. It's the wine of beer as far as ingredients to go. Way to go SN! Very bold idea."
"Conclusion: Simple, tasty fresh hop ale...the hop flavors are a little bit less than might be suggested by the aromas, but the clean crisp bitterness goes perfectly with the medium caramel malt presence."
"D: Extremely drinkable brew, really loved this brew! I was extremely impressed by the subtlety of the flavor and the overall smoothness of the brew. It had been a little while since I was really wowed by an APA but this was really distinctive and stood out as something other than just a ""lighter IPA"". SN deserves a ton of credit, they're blazing a lot of trails for large volume macro's and this is another feather in their cap. Find and try this brew, you won't regret it."
"Pairing - Spanish olives , Spanish Chorizo (not hot), fresh goat cheese."
"-Bye"
"This beer is very drinkable and at 6.7% you can drink this 24 oz by yourself with no problem."
"A bomber of this was enough. I don't think I would have any more than that at once."
"2009. Clear, tawny amber with a thick, beige/yellow cap. Great head retention with lots of sticky and chunky lace. The aroma was full of hops - spicy, floral, citrus, with a hint of mint - with mild malt in the background. The flavour was more of the same, but with soft bitterness and a bit of caramel sweetness. Hops really lingered. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation, a bit dry and quite smooth. The hop profile was very interesting and something that I wouldn't mind having again."
"Poured a dark amber, very clear. I thought the aroma to be light and floral. The flavor however delivered, very bold. This beer has two distinct stages. It first hits with a sweet citrus flavor. The sweetness being a bit maple syrupy. Next comes the bitter, with a finish that lingers nicely. This is a delicious very drinkable beer that is one of my new favorites."
"This is a big beer with more to celebrate than to fault. Drinkablity is limited only because of all that goes into it."
"A drinkable brew, considering how powerful its hop profile is. A massive effort from SN paid off."
"D- This is a good easy drinking beer. Not my go to as far as my wet hops fix goes though. I would get it again for sure."
"Drinkability is ok, not quite as good as i was expecting from SN."
"D - excellent balance and palatable, yet another solid hop-forward SN entry. Cheers Chico buddies!"
"On a side note: why did this hit the shelves in August? My idea of 'fresh hop' means weeks (or days) from harvest to bottle/tap, not months...just wondering."
"Highly recommended and cheap at $4 a bomber"
"This beer is simply incredible. I purchased a 22 oz. bottle, it was the last one in stock elsewise i would have gone back and cleaned the store out of it. I drank it with a meal of spicy sushi rolls which it complimented well. Big Big floral flavor, like an ipa with limited bitterness. Exceptional drinkability and smoothness, the hops used are shipped from new zealand in our off season and they are robust, fresh, earthy pine flavored and delicious. I can't say enough about how great this beer tastes if you get a chance to try it do so and if you love dried hop ale, like their celebration ale, but less bitterness you should enjoy this treat."
"2010 - I assume that this could vary to some degree year to year, so I'll add a review for 2010. Ended up with the same scores. Pours a mostly clear dark orange with big fluffy khaki colored head. Fades leaving a big dollop of meringue in the middle with thick blobs of lace clinging to the glass. Smell: spicy, slightly grassy, subdued orange citrus, over a toasty base. Taste: spicy, tangerine, orange, lightly toasted and caramel sweetness."
"Staggering hop profile. Another big win for SN."
"Go get some, easy to knock back and relax to."
"D=very enjoyable and drinkable beer, good taste, feel and moderate ABV."
"The carbonation is great, it forms a long lasting foam, but is still soft and not aggressive. This makes the beer very drinkable."
"D- Very drinkable. I put down the 24oz Bomber no problem. I will certainly buy this beer again!"
"I would probably not drink more than a bomber of this and would definitely choose the Wet Hop if I had a choice."
"This beer feels kind of thin due to a smaller amount of malt, but this causes the beer to be very drinkable. It is full of flavor without being thick or hard to drink."
"T - Very few beers cause me do drop to one knee and praise the Lord for beer, and this was one of them, just a wonderful beer by a wonderful brewery"
"D: Soooo easy to drink. A perfect note!"
"Delicious and light enough at 6.7% to make a bomber disappear quite quickly. A fantastic take on a pale ale and quite different from the run of the mill interpretation."
"Drinkability - As of today, my favorite from Sierra. This one's a keeper and I'll definitely pick this one up again."
"Final thoughts: A nice IPA, lots of fresh hop taste, starts light bitterness with low alpha hops, then gets a huge fresh bitter hop bite at the end. Could have used a little more dark malts IMO, but I'm a malty IPA kinda person."
"overall= I really really like this brew, it's clean and refreshing, with a bit of an unusual hop flavor and has a nice sweetness that balances it (but on the hoppier side of course). Great, I will have to get more of this befor it's gone for the year. I could drink this all day!"
"Freshness wasn't an issue, just couldn't get into it, and I really wanted to."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the clear orangey amber brew. Head is robust and lasts well, with lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is malts, citrus hops, a touch of pine. Taste is citrus hoppiness, sweet malt in the middle, then pine bitterness comes on in the end. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, and drinkability is very easy. Excellent brew."
"I could drink a few of these and not feel bored with the selection."
"Served in a 24 oz. bottle, who needs more than one??"
"Nice bomber, especially at the price. Its hard to go wrong with a Sierra Nevada APA. I think the hops may have faded a bit, but the balance in this bottle is something that a lot of pale ales should strive for. Its not Alpha King, but what else is?"
"I found it a tad too fizzy in the mouth, but it was overall an enjoyable experience."
"D: Putting aside it's strong bitterness, is a very balanced beer with enough to entertain the pallet. That will keep you going back."
"I'm not going to lie. I was hoping for more here. But it's better than a Budweiser."
"11 oz sampling, 2009. Second time having this SN offering - the first was their 2008 batch. Poured a hazy copper-orange color with a pillowy off-white head that held great retention and left a nice sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Aromas were of caramel malt, citrus, and pine - fresh and sweet. Tastes were full of flavor - pungent, juicy grapefruit backed by malty caramel sweetness. Finishes spicy with bitter grapefruit rind and somewhat dry. Mouth-feel was medium bodied, while being oily, coating the palate very well, although there was a sudsy/soapy presence as well. Highly recommendable and highly enjoyable!"
"D: Love it. It's pretty big for an APA. Malty and hoppy but I'd say although there is balance, my takeaway is that this is a very hoppy beer. I'm looking forward to my next one. How does Sierra Nevada do it?"
"Drinkability? Refreshing, complex, clean, bold, I could drink this nonstop till the next locust plague."
"D: As a whole a fine brew, but would venture elsewhere next time."
"Overall a nice APA. Interesting hop profile story, but really doesn't have a distinct or memorable impression, kind of gimmicky, but no big deal. A decent beer, and one i would be happy to drink anytime."
"drinkability: This is going down fast."
"Overall, this is a good beer and I can definitely enjoy it. It seems like there is room for improvement, primarily in the aroma. However, definitely tastey and pleasant to drink."
"D: A good beer, to style, but the fresh hop provides a bit more of a wallop than your average American Pale Ale."
"crispy mouthfeel. a little astringent from the resin notes. drinkable though."
"D: Very tasty, big and bitter."
"Overall, I'd say this beer is something that everyone should try atleast once. Even if you are not a hop head like myself, you could probably appreciate how true to the style it is while adding a minty, different type of hop to the reciepe. If this were real fresh and my nose wasn't running I would probably have been able to give it a better score on the taste and smell. A great beer that I wish could be brewed all year."
"i solid APA much better then the regular harvest ale"
"m/d - On the thick side for the body for what I feel a pale should be but this probably sits on the edge anyway and I expect that from their special releases. A little sticky and sweet, but not overwhelming. Really drinkable but borderline dangerous at nearly 7%. Very tasty beer that I look forward to sampling over the years."
"Cheers!"
"24oz brown bottle obtained at The Liquor Shoppe in Tygsboro, MA. Pours a murky dark amber body with nearly an inch of off-white head. Citrus (lemon, orange), pineapple, herbs, mint, and a bit of caramel and pith in the aroma. Orange, grapefruit, pineapple, berry, pith, lemon, mint, all presumably from the hops, dominate the flavor, with just enough caramel and biscuit to provide a bit of balance. Dry finish with hints of vegetal, fruity, and herbal hops. One of the most complex hop flavors of any beer I've tried. Medium bodied with ample carbonation to boot. No alcohol presence or warming to speak of. Extremely drinkable on account of every trait of this beer. I was expecting a lot from this beer and it did not disappoint. One of the best APAs around and for the price it's probably the best bang for your buck flavor-wise too! Bravo, SN!"
"D - I like this beer alot. It is sll in there. The hops and malt all come out and compliment each other. I wish I bought a few more of these."
"Crisp, good mouthfeel, carbonation isn't lively or over-assertive, just enough to be interesting. High drinkability for the style and in general."
"D- Definitely drinkable, the 24 oz. bottle was split between two of us but I could have easily drank the entire bottle myself. Definite recommendation."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours an impressive amber with a fluffy head that leaves insane amounts of lace on the glass. Smell is of earth tones in the nose with a bit of sweet malt character. Taste is rock solid, I was expecting more hops from this being fresh, but was shocked more sweet than anything with a earth weed hop taste on the finish. The overall drinkability of this fine offering is really nice, this beer does go down with a smoothness that I havn't had in sometime. Overall the smooth taste along with a nice hop profile and sweetness make this one of the better beers I have had this year."
"D - Goes down easy; not at all a bad one to try at least once, though I seem to recall their Wet Hop being more enjoyable."
"This beer pours a reddish gold color with a darker colored think head. The smell is very complex with plenty of hop aroma and also a pleasant malt scent. It tastes exactly like it smells, delicious. Nice hop profile with a great malt backbone. Great mouthfeel too, perfect for an ale."
"Realatively quick, rocky off-white. Some super sticky lacing stays strong at the top of my pint glass. Great amber color that reminds me of tea.The hops have an assertively mellow orange juice mixed with fresh baked biscuits. Very balanced aroma. The taste has just smooth combinations of hops and malt. Bready and biscuity malts, juicey hops with a resiny finish. This beer has one high flavor rpofile and just feels like silky juice going down the gullet."
"D -- Here's a conundrum -- while I know I'd never drink this all night, it's a very intriguing beer that makes you enjoy every swallow."
"Pours a beautiful clear copper with sticky tan head that grips the walls of the glass. Smells hoppy but less so than an average IPA; attractive aromas of lemon citrus and clover honey. Drinking this beer gives me a rush because it taste is immensely powerful. The flavor is perhaps best described as a barleywine-IPA hybrid. Very grapefruity and sprucey hops hit the palate upfront but layers of sweet malts come to rescue a second later and give it very well rounded finish. Am having a ball with this beer and plateful of extra sharp cheddar."
"O- Well rounded beer which brings out hop notes never before tasted with a dry hopped beer."
"interesting little story on the label, too."
"The beer pours a hazy amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale malt scent along with a nice hop aroma. It's not overly hoppy, but it has an appreciable bitterness level. The taste is great! It has a killer hop bitterness that hits you up front and lingers in the finish. The malts provide adequate balance without stifling the hop character. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good APA. It's well balanced with a tremendous hop taste; a well brewed APA."
"Drinkability is great, moderate ABV and a nice clean balanced taste that just rolls over the tongue nicely. Well done Sierra Nevada. Well done."
"*I love the label stating ""...journey to the only place on the planet where fresh hops are harvested in our spring, the Southern Hemisphere"". yeah, just half the planet. It's kind of a big place. Yes, I know the hops are from NZ...then why not say that? A hemisphere is pretty large."
"Medium body, with moderate to high carbonation. Overall a refreshing fresh hop ale, displaying all the expected characteristics. The aroma is invinting and has a nice complexity but seems a little mild for the style, so even though it has all the right elements, it's lacking some punch. Otherwise, a great example with a drinkability that makes it hard to put down."
"The drinkablility is outstanding because the beer does not overpower in any way and is delicious."
"The beer is excellently carbonated and the alcohol is barely evident at all. I have had almost an entire bomber in no time and wish there were more in the fridge. This beer ranks right up there with the Alpha King pale ale from FFF and the Bravo pale ale from Portsmouth as one of my new favorites. I am really enjoying the amount of hoppy bitterness that breweries are cramming into the American Pale Ale lately without all the alcohol that comes with a DIPA."
"One of the favorites to look forward to each year."
"Pour a clear cooper, huge head, amasing lacing. Huge hop aroma right at the beginning : floral, orange rind and musty grass. A faint ""pilner"" aroma in there as well. Flavor is pretty much IPA : lots of bitter hops and a solid malty backbone to handle it. Very good beer, and the fat 24 ouce bottle is sweet."
"Seems like I haven't tasted hops this fresh since I stood over the brew kettle."
"D: Easy enough, not hugely complex or bitter, but there are definitely some of those nice fresh hop resins that I wish I could taste in every beer. Nice drinking beer, but I think IPA is a more appropriate label for this beer. Will seek out again."
"not so bad, I feel I could drink this again, but it is really too dry considering the mild hop bitterness."
"This feels great on the tongue, slightly sticky but leaving the mouth refreshed rather than dry. Everything blends so well in the APA that it lends itself to some great sessioning."
"O - This beer has a high drinkability quotient and stays true to the American Pale Ale style. I will happily finish my 24 ouncer, but still it left me wanting more."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with some orange hues. A one inch off white head sits on top, decent head retention and nice sticky lacing left on the glass. Nose is of pine hops and citrus hops - mostly grapefruit, some earthiness - grassy, and I think that I pick up just a touch of lemon. Taste is bitter right of the bat. Excellent blend of citrus and pine hops. Taste is mostly of pine, but a nice blend in of grapefruit, a mild malt backbone evens out the finish. Medium bodied with medium carbonation, lingering bitterness and a dry finish. This is a well blended pale ale that hit the spot on a warm day. Definitely one to sit with for a while."
"Granted, given the price (I paid $3.79) you get a good bang for the buck."
"The alchohol doesn't show up and it's easily drinkable, but I found myself somewhat dissapointed because I was expecting more of a citrus and pine profile and crisp taste. This is more of a bitter and earthy feel."
"D - Very drinkable beer that's a nice departure from the usual American citrus and pine hop profiles. I'll be buying several more of these bottles while they're still available."
"Mouthfeel: Definitely high in the carbonation. Somewhat medium in heaviness."
"Drinkability: With the ABV sitting where it's at, I could see myself having two of these in an evening, although that would probably be pushing my limits. It's an enjoyable sipping beer, and another well crafted product from SN."
"Another delicious, well-crafted beer by Sierra Nevada. I'm not struck by fresh hops, but it's definitely a lively, hoppy beer; it just doesn't have that wet, pungent hop aroma and taste I've experienced in other ales. It's definitely worth buying each season, though I would rank it below their fall harvest ale."
"Drinkability - Just the 24 oz for me for now. I might have to try again though. Maybe this one wasn't as fresh as it could be."
"This is the third Sierra Nevada offering that I have had and once again I am very impressed. Sierra Nevada is steadily becoming my go to beer. I will continue to try more and more stuff from them and if the past three beers are any indication then they will be good brews."
"D- glad i got a hold of this one, need to find the chico estate to complete the trifecta. good n hoppy without pushing the envelope, focusing more on hop flavor than bitterness. smooth and drinkable."
"D: Goes down like an IPA, but its lighter than some others ive had."
"D: Drinkable but I don't think I'll be seeking out again."
"D: Great APA all the way! Would recommend to those who are fans of the style along with the IPA lovers too. Above average in all aspects..."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a rich amber color with a 1 inch head. Aroma is very hoppy. Taste is very bitter and overpowering with hops. Very bitter in the mouth. Drinkability is not good. I struggled to finish my 24 oz. bottle. As a lager lover this beer is just not for me."
"Overall, another great wet hop ale from Sierra Nevada."
"Taste is more of the same of the aroma. Citrus flavors of orange and lemon zest. A bit of tropical fruit in the background. And just hint of toasted malt in the background. Nice smooth mouthfeel and an easy drinker for sure. Between this edition and last year's, this is becoming one of my favorite releases of the summer. Another great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"It's well-crafted and the carbonation is even-keel, never obscuring the malt. Regardless, the hops are just not for me. I'd imagine that this is pretty similar to a traditional UK IPA just kicked up a few degrees. Interesting offering from SN."
"D- This is a very refreshing APA. It doesn't go too far in any direction other than the very obvious hop accent. I would definitely session this at a tailgate on a hot day."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Not as sharp as the domestic harvest ale, but still full of hops with enough of a malt backback to support it. A good one."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. To me this is much like their Pale ale only souped up with more and slightly different tasting hops. Its a hoppier APA however not quite an IPA. Very good if you like Sierra's pale ale which in my opinion is one of the most refreshing flavorful beers. This just offers more bite, its a great beer but for the price I don't know if I'd choose this over the Pale Ale. Go for it though while you still have the chance."
"Pours a clear effervescent light amber color with a big stiff off white head that fades slowly with a good amount of Belgian lacing, some 3D. The smell is timid yet orange citrus and sweet well balanced malt notes. The mouth feel flavor combo is light, tangy citrus, nicely carbonated. The fruity citrus leads to a piny hop that lingers appropriately. A real nice drinker...a bunch more hops than your daddy's APA...i'd go with it as more of a good ipa experience myself."
"MEdium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability on this is amazing. Not nearly as hoppy as Torpedo but clearly much more balanced and the alcohol goes virtually unnoticed so this is a real easy drinker. I wasn't particularly blown away by this but there's not really anything bad I can say about it either. Overall this was very enjoyable and there's a good chance I'll pick this up again sometime."
"2010 release: Seems fruitier than last year, with grapefruit and pine hop flavors. No alcohol flavor. Still a great IPA."
"A very good ale over all. Hops shine, as they should in a fresh hop ale. Good bitterness that is balanced well, but not overtaken, by the malt. Definitely something I will look forward to again next year."
"D-I can't see myself wanting to drink more than one."
"A good beer that stands up for a fresh hop ale, but there are still a few better out there, even still, always a good change from the usual."
"A good beer, but not that much of a ""hop lovers'"" beer."
"The mouth is slightly oily with low carbonation. Would go great with a burger or pizza."
"Verdict: Southern Harvest is a nicely bitter, yet well-balanced Pale Ale. I love the idea of having a beer hopped with fresh hops in the Spring, and it's a treat to try some of the best hops that the Southern Hemisphere has to offer in near-optimum condition."
"This is a drinkable APA, but it just doesn't quite live up to the regular SNPA or the SN Harvest. The hops aren't grapefruity or as piney as an APA really should be. That said, I do like the floral dry hops."
"D. Very easy to drink. Has a smoothness that makes it go down very easy. A very good APA."
"Beer poured a copper color with a nice tan head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is of the malt backbone and a hint of southern hemisphere hops. Taste is caramel malts, with hints of melon, that are quickly taken over by a pine resin finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied but extremely smooth. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a nice variation of the standard SN IPA style that is recommended to hop heads to try."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass to enjoy before having dinner. It's the same color orange as a sweet potato. Leaving a frothy head that leaves a nice lacing. I was surprised that this was not as aromatic as I thought it would be. Some pine and citrus notes but not much else. The first sip was filled with piney bitterness. Couldn't sense much else going on besides that in terms of taste. Its a little rough in terms of mouth feel but still fairly sessionable. If your not into hops then you won't like this beer. Overall this is a great value buy but a little more aroma and complexity would have been nice."
"Overall -- what a great beer. Aside from the fact that I love New Zealand beer (Monteith's, Speights, etc). This really shows the potential of their hops, especially when done very well. A great sipping beer for those who like the hops, but find an IPA to be a little too intense. It is crisp, refreshing, and very well balanced. I'll definitely be picking up a case of this before it runs out. One of the best beers in the Sierra Nevada line-up."
"How is it that this ""fresh hop ale"" isn't called an IPA on the label?"
"The beer pours a transparent amber color with a fine, white had. Plenty of lace tufts stick along the inside of the glass...nice. The aroma is very citric (lemon and grapefruit rind) and also a little resin like. Very fresh smelling, but not overwhelming. It's subtle, and could be a little more intense. The taste more than makes up for that, however....huge bitterness...full-on hop flavor. Slight malt character, but it's overshadowed by the hops. Sharp, grapefruit, bitter. The beer is firm and full in body. Very appealing and exceedingly long hop finish."
"Drinkability looking forward to the 2010 vintage very good beer"
"this beer pours a light cooper color with a 1 finger creamy off-white head that has some sticky lacing..the smell is hops first then some grapefruit and other fruits with a slight caramel malt smell..the taste is hop forward on the bitter side with a slight caramel malt finish..the mouth feel is medium to full bodied this SN offering is very drinkable but i like torpedo much better overall a good APA....recommended as a macro"
"Overall this is still a pretty good beer. A few distractions including the alcohol aftertaste, but the malts are delicious when they are detectable."
"Pours a nice copper / light amber with an off-white head; rings of lacing left on the glass. Aroma is a sweet pineapple hoppiness, with touches of other bits of citrus and a hint of caramel malt. Taste is hop dominated, citrusy, grapefruit rind, resinous - kind of like a suped up Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, a little bit of viscosity to it, big hop bite with a lasting bitterness. Fairly drinkable, but bitterness will eventually wear me out. Enjoyable -"
"Just tried the 2009 version. It poured into the glass to present a mild bronze color. There was a light tangerine citrus aroma. The mouthfeel reavealed a medium body. The first tast is mild and lightly cirtrus, but it advances to a stronger grapefruit bitterness in the mid taste and finishes with a floral hop aftetaste."
"This one is more of a bitter IPA, where the Torpedo is a great HOPPY IPA. Still this brew is great part of the SN group."
"The beer has a medium body, smooth with nice carbonation. The beer was very easy to drink and refreshing."
"Out of the bottle into a pint glass it pours a really nice copper color with a small white head. Head seems to have nice retention. The head leaves plenty of good lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is really good, almost more of an IPA smell than an american pale ale, a good thing I think. Smells of hops obviously, piney I think. Taste is also the same, piney and has a citrusy kind of aftertaste mixed with the pine. Kind of bitter up front but finishes very nicely. A really nice taste overall. Decent mouthfeel and pretty high drinkability, doing this 24oz bottle is no problem. All together just another great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Drinkability: Still good, but not 1st Edition good. I bought the first Edition until it ran out. I'll probably give this one another try, but as of now it doesn't touch last year's."
"D= great. Really a nice beer. Not qwhat I expected it to be but still very good. I like the fall release more."
"2009 edition, pours darker amber, with a dull reddish glow, long lasting typical khaki head, ever so slowly shrinks to a thick ring, and film, leaving nice thicksheeting/lace. Refroths upon a gently swirl. Fruity sweet and hopped up nose. Pleasantly hopped up ale. Hops emit tropical fruit notes and resinous goodness. Enough malt aas an undercoating, but the drying and pungent hops are the story here. Yet more quality and quite worthy brew from SN"
"D: This is an intriguing and refreshing beer, and I'd definitely like to drink some more on a hot day."
"This beer had a fantastic head on it when poured into my glass, as good as any I have seen on an American beer, and it retained it beautifully throughout. Although, having said that, ""throughout"" wasn't all that long! - I fair gulped this one down, faster than I can recall doing so with any beer in quite some time. Definitely a dangerously drinkable beer, and another most special beer from my favorite brewery. I can't wait for the Harvest Ale this Fall!"
"This is a good beer, but not knocking my socks off. I was warned that those New Zealand hops were a little different and that's the truth. Seems to be missing a layer or something. Still, a solid and very interesting beer."
"Over all this is a great beer. I look forward to it each year. This years wasn't quite as good as last years, but its still damn good."
"D-A good extra-hoppy IPA. Very tasty, a nice treat."
"Pours a clear copper color with a one-finger light tan head. The head recedes into a patchy layer on top leaving solid lacing. Amora is rich with malts, caramel and a balancing, citrus and pine. The aroma is very similar to the taste, a malty start with a citrus/pine bitterness. Some spice , but mostly citrus, haven't had such a well balanced beer in a while, in the hop/malt department. Great mouthfel of creamy, smoothness, with a great bitterness. Easy drinking for 6.7% and could def. polish off a few in one session. I had this once before from the bottle and don't remembering being this good. My guess is a fresh keg?"
"The intense finish drops the drinkability a tad, but one bottle at a sitting is plenty for me!"
"i love this. one of my favorite releases of the year. i am quite happy they decided to release this again in 09. at under $4 for a 24oz bottle, there is no better deal! 5.0 all the way."
"Overall, a good beer. Tastes more like an IPA than an APA to me. Not as good as SN's Torpedo or Pale Ale though."
"A 24oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams pint glass. The beer was a clear amber color with a thick ivory head and abundant lacing. Mostly floral aroma, also citrus and sweet malt. Pine taste, a little grapefruit, a little caramel. Pretty hoppy, great beer to drink."
"Taste is pine and maple with a light spice/citrus and a good bitter kick. Medium bodied throughout and good drinkability. I enjoyed this one. Will probably grab a couple more."
"For me, this is an excellent version of what I think an American Pale Ale should be. This beer is right up there with Alpha King."
"A 24 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop for around $5. Poured into my Sierra Nevada shaker glass. The ale appears a hazed golden amber color with two fingers of bone white head. Nose and flavor consist of notes of toasted bread, lemon peel and pith, mildly resinous pine, spicy, floral and fragrant, extremely fresh tasting. The ale is pleasantly bitter from start to finish and a tad oily with more than ample carbonation. All pale ale fans need to seek this one out before it's gone."
"Deep golden amber color that shines red when held to a light. 2-finger off-white head of large bubbles settles to 1-finger and becomes rocky. Smell is fresh and pungent, lemon and grass, honey, pine, lots of hoppy depth on a rich semi-sweet malt backbone. Taste is much the same, no surprises. The crispness of the hops is very nicely balanced by the fullness and body of the malts, which are much more felt than tasted. Creaminess is present on the palate, but tart dryness is what lingers in the finish. Foam clings heavily to the glass. It is thick and filling, hoppy and thirst-quenching, all at the same time. Unusual dynamics, something different, and very enjoyable precisely for that reason if none other."
"D- I think I'd like it to be more balanced. It was pretty much all hop, all the time. I know they're trying to showcase the fresh hops, but some more malt would be a nice addition in my opinion."
"Josh"
"Overall, a great beer. Super fresh and leaves me wanting more!"
"Drinkability is great, drank 3 pints in a row, and wanted more. Was awesome on draft if you can find it. I will definitely have to find a bomber or two of this. hopefully it will be just as great as it was on tap. A great Hoppy pale ale!"
"First review so here goes: Pours a pretty golden almost copper like hue. Nice foamy head. Smells floral with citrus. I could taste caramel hints mainly dominated by the floral/citrus charachters though. Lacing is evident. Smooth to swallow. Finish is a bit resiny with a almost woody aftertaste but enjoyable. The drink seems to mellow out and balances out as it warms up. This brew seemed stronger than what I anticapated but is a joy to drink. This beer reminds me alot of the 90 minute IPA I drank awhile back..."
"Pours a deep golden copper color with a bubbly white head that sticks around forever. Floral citrus minty hops dominate the aroma, but hints of caramel and bread peak through. Taste is slightly bitter with citrus and mint, hints of caramel and a bit of a mineral taste in there as well. Crisp bubbly carbonation, resinous slick sticky mouthfeel, medium body bit of a dry finish. Nice drinker, needs more aroma hops, but easy to drink. Great value at 4.49 for 24oz."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure to drink. Pours a rich amber with an incredibly thick white head that goes nowhere. Piney aroma with minimal malts. The taste reminds me of drinking my homemade cascade hopped ales out of the fermenter before bottling. Rich in very fresh citrus hops and balanced with a fine maltiness. This is a medium body beer that you don't just slam. Very very well done."
"I could drink a few of these, very nice beer. SN doesn't disappoint."
"D: Flavorful and easy-drinking, but not as scrumptious and deliciously fresh as Sierra Nevada's Harvest Ale. Still a solid beer, I'm glad I purchased this bomber."
"Enjoying this one right now. Pours a reddish amber color with little head and no lacing. Smells of light malts and earthy hops. Tastes of fresh hops with very light malty undertones. Smooth and just a teensy bit overcarbed. Very drinkable, glad I have a 24 oz. bottle."
"1144"
"D - All in all, pleasant and very drinkable. If given the choice, I'd probably take a Torpedo--or even the standard issue SNPA--over this, but it is certainly a very good beer that I'd like to enjoy again (especially to test against the quality of this particular bottle)."
"Drinkability: Wow. I am regretting only getting one bottle. If you are any bit a hop head, you will love this beer. Very hoppy, but not to the point of being overwhelming. I will be getting more of this."
"light amber color, large creamy head, roses/estery, later on in the drink the smell was skunky/malty...and not in a good way, very smooth mouthfeel, light citrus hop character. not that imaginative a beer from sierra nevada...probably liken it to a good pale ale with less bite and weight."
"M-D- Mouthfeel is medium with a oil feel and low carbonated finish. Nice balance for easy drinking. Drinkable for all occations."
"This is a perfect summer beer. Light and refreshing, but with enough character, complexity, and balance to be enjoyable even to the most well rounded and picky beer advocates. I could drink this all night...and probably will!"
"Overall this beer is a glorious celebration of hops and all the many nuanced flavors they produce."
"Overall this holds up surprisingly well as I remember having a bottle a few months past it's prime and was still impressed. Definitely worth a shot fresh or a few months old."
"This is really excellent. I've been somewhat underwhelmed by the fresh hop beers I have had previously, but this is bursting with flavor. The nose is more subtle, but there is nothing subtle about the flavor profile. It's even surprisingly bitter for a pale ale. All in all a fantastic brew at an outstanding price."
"A very nice offering; I like it better than the last Harvest release, and easily one of my favorites from Sierra Nevada. Will buy again."
"Brews Brother"
"Honey orange with a fine sand colored inch of foam that melts into a creamy disk that rests on top leaving behind plenty of sticky lace. The spicy resinous hop aroma hit just as I cracked the cap on this one, the fruity, citrusy hop aroma is nicely complemented by toasty grain and caramel. The flavor is pretty hop forward with grapefruit and lemon pepper spiciness up front with a nice chewy caramel malt backbone. Medium full bodied with a long finish. This beer is a real treat, get some while it's fresh."
"D: For a pale ale, perfectly commendable. I respect SA's attitude toward freshness, but I can't quite detect it here. Still, a nice pale with a good hoppy shift to it."
"i could easily have 2 of these 24oz bottles in one sitting while watching a baseball game...the smoothness of this one will keep me coming back for more....bravo Sierra Nevada"
"D - I expected a more complex hop profile than I got with this one. There is a strong hop note balancing the huge malt backbone, but the hops are one dimensional; pine and bitterness. The thick, malty body makes this beer seem bigger than it is and the sweet finish keeps it from being a session beer. A decent, drinkable beer, but I was hoping for something more."
"Overall, this 24 oz bottle took me a bit to finish, but eventually, it was gone. A lot of hops in this thing. I'd have it again, but I'd prefer only 12 or 16 oz."
"Cheers"
"d: Five bucks for 24ozs? Fantastic beer that I think I may have tried late in the season. I'll look for it sooner next year."
"4 very easy to drink at first but the bitterness tends to build whereas the flavor doesn't. the initial 8 oz or so i'm thinking ""i'm not worthy!"" but by the end i'm thinking this one could use more residual sweetness. still good, of course, just drier than expected. the alcohol is not hidden and i would have guessed 7.5% easy. unlike wet hop harvest, which is a pulpy overly willing slut of a beer, this one is firm and businesslike. wish the best of the two could be combined."
"D- Excellent. Another winner from SN, definitely worth a try."
"On draft in a pint glass. Copper orange color with a thick off-white head. Floral, grass-y nose. Fresh is the word, and this beer really delivers. Great hops and nice bitterness, but not overpowering. I know it's not classified as an IPA but it sure has all the aspects of IPAs that I love. Very drinkable, could have two of these in an evening. Glad I was finally able to try it and it definitely didn't disappoint. Another solid brew from Sierra Nevada."
"More hoppy than the smell would suggest; the malt only shows up on the initial sip. The rest is bitter, culminating in the swallow and the long, long aftertaste. This is one for the hop-heads. The body is full and round; light on the carbonation regardless of the head. An easy, if somewhat high in alcohol, APA to drink...could pass for an IPA easily."
"To me, Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. Are one of the finest brewers of craft beers around."
"This one pours a clear dark amber and does not have much of a head. Aroma is not strong but is pleasingly malty and subtly spicy. Flavor is quite strong and malty with a hint of cloves and a hoppy undertone with just a little bitterness. Texture is very thick and smooth, tingly and sassy, leaving a slightly biting finish."
"Pours a clear amber color with a booming rocky slightly off-white head that lasts forever. This beer leaves heavy, sticky lacing as you drink it. Aroma has a floral bouquet of hops with some touches of citrus and caramel malt. The flavor is full of citrus and pine hops and some sweet malt, very similar to the aroma and ends with a bitterness that creeps up on you but doesn't overpower. Its a light- to medium-bodied and is very carbonated. This is a very nice beer and its lightness makes the hops ever more present."
"Overall, Decent beer, no complaints, might buy again but not too soon, plenty of other beers id buy first."
"D - Keep it coming! This is a highly enjoyable pale that is big on flavor, without knocking you out with a high abv. You could easily put back a few of these, and not get too drunk. This is a nice beer to have when you're craving hops, but not looking for the alcoholic effects of an IPA or DIPA."
"Lots of agitation in the cream colored foam, plenty of variation in bubble sizes, hangs onto a half finger coating with generous lacing as well. Mild gauziness to the deep bronze color, suggests as much brown as orange, holds light inside the glass nicely. Fresh biscuity toast to the nose but it's really the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus which sparkles here, the strong floral dimension never gets heavy while apricot and peach fruit speak up now and then, field grasses present without any herbaceous bitterness. In the mouth it's full-bodied and manages to convey a dry texture in spite of the ripe sweet tang in the grapefruit, orange citrus. The hops have a sour tightness to them, some tea leaf and tar resin notes too. Carob and cocoa show at times but the malts mostly integrated into the whole package. Here the density inhibits the florality from spreading far and wide. As the name suggests, tastes very fresh and lively."
"This is a very decent beer but nothing about it is exceptional. Very drinkable but there is nothing about it that will stick out as especially memorable. Overall it is a nice beer and very drinkable. Not quite hoppy as I'd like it. The head dissipates quickly."
"I personally prefer the original Harvest Ale, but this one is as equally well crafted."
"In short a very good beer that just isn't wet hop ale, but still very good."
"Very nice, somewhat pale orange/bronze color. Huge head on top that resembles whipped cream. Sticky lace on down the glass. Freshly mown grass aroma. Moderate toasted notes. Huge hop flavor. Not a tongue stripping presence just big hop flavor. Touch of sweetness and caramel notes. The hop flavor lingers on and on. Really well balanced and not overly bitter. Good body-the trace of sweetness really balances the body out quite well. Overall a great, great beer. Goes down way too easy. Not overly bitter or hopped. Just a huge, pleasant hop presence. I will be getting more-lots more!"
"Just tried 2010's batch and it was really tasty. The criticism that i left last year must have been a bad bottle, because the hops stood out on this one, and the drinkability remained great."
"Easy to drink. Its a refreshing beer."
"Pours an amber color with a sticky off-white head. The aroma is malt and a good dose of fresh oily hops. The taste much like the aroma has a decent malt backbone but the fresh hop flavors clearly steal the show creating a lingering bitter finish. The mouthfeel is between light and medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. This one is far too drinkable and a beer that I come to look forward to every year."
"D- could drink this beer all nite..great session beer...no problem drinking the 22 oz bottle"
"Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is good. Very quaffable, doesn't feel like 6.7."
"D - I'll have no problem at all finishing the bottle, and I'm pretty sure I'll be sad to see it go. It's not as good as some pale ales and IPAs I've had, but it's still a really solid offering. SN doesn't seem to have it in them to disappoint. Not a bad price at $3.99, but Celebration can be had for the same or less, and I'd take it over this in a heartbeat."
"Overall this is a quality beer and I really enjoy the fresh hops present in this beer."
"Overall, a decent enough beer, but not anything I'll have again. Hops completely dominate w/o much other taste to go along with it."
"Taste is herbaceously floral with a mild resinous hop aftertaste. Some lime peel and grapefruit flavors come in there and maybe just a brief flash of malty counterbalance. Pretty bitter stuff, but not overly so. I would say this leans a bit closer to an IPA than a PA, but either way this is a pretty tasty brew. I think I like it just a bit better than the wet hop."
"If I re edited this after today's brew on tap at Piedmont Ale House it would be a very solid A. Between tap and bottle = no contest. Nice creamy head that lasted to the end, and a lot more flavor and hop kick."
"D - Quite drinkable brew - has a pleasant, refreshing hoppiness that's well balanced by the light malts. Could definitely drink a few of these."
"D - Exceptionally drinkable. This is one of my favorite Sierra Nevada beers since it's such a nice balance of hops and malts while bringing a lot of the hop flavors and aromas to the front."
"quite a pungent amber colored brew. odor is straight hop aroma. palate is immensely hoppy... to the point of soap like astringent. quite bitter. extremely even. takes the cake as of assertive hoppiness goes. very dry. constricting hop that sit there for a while. the malt comes in very mild and late. of walnuts and wood pulp. quite crisp and any less bitter in sips either. very mild alcohol but its seems that that wasn't really on my mind while drink it. don't plan on drinking something mild after this..."
"Pours a a clear ruby-tinted brown w/ a frothy, one-finger head that dies slowly and leaves lae around the glass due to some good carbonation. A good floral, earthy hop smell that is usurped by some caramelized and roasted malts - good balance. Taste is more of the same as the malts and hops hold each other in check - the beer is smooth and creamy with some chewiness, from bread malt I presume, as well as having a sturdy malt base of some roasted and toffee malts. Finishes dry with a good helping of herbal tea-like hop bitterness. A quality ale that is easy going and nice to have on a summer evening."
"D: Nothing wrong with this one at all. Another rock-solid pale ale from Sierra Nevada. I was excited to see this in the cooler - it was the last one left. I'm glad I grabbed it - this is a really good beer."
"I think I liked the 1st release quite a bit more, but maybe my palate has changed or something. Solid and reasonably priced session brew."
"Style wise, this is a conundrum. Seems to be halfway between an American Pale Ale and a Double IPA. Seems like that would mean an American IPA, but it's not - too grainy, too smooth, too hoppy without the accompanying bitterness. Seems to be a Double Pale Ale if that means anything. Oh well, it is damn good whatever it is."
"Very crisp and clean to drink. Carbonation was good and the alcohol did not hit too hard."
"If you're a fan of hoppy beers with earthy tones, this one comes highly recommended."
"- Super drinkable... bit on the bubbly side.. but given it's style, I would expect that. Overall a very nice offering from Sierra Nevada. Not disappointed."
"Definitely a special brew from a warhorse brewery!"
"D: very drinkable and yet another solid Sierra Nevada beer"
"It has a medium mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation. A nice offering from Sierra Nevada. Just curious if the hobbits brew this beer as well."
"A very nice beer, nothing earth-shattering, but very well executed and easily sessionable."
"I love the effort SN puts into a wide-range of creative beers throughout the year, and Southern Hemisphere Harvest Ale is a really nice hoppy ale. It just doesn't have eye-popping flavor."
"This one pours the normal caramel amber color I love so much with some sticky 3 finger head that laces nicely. As soon as the bottle was cracked, a pungent citra-pine aroma slaps you in the face. This is only followed by an intense slam of fresh hop goodness billowing through the air as I pour. The head is like a sticky, fluffy cloud that settles nicely. At first, the mouthfeel was just right, with yummy sweet malts to carry the fantastic hop flavor... But as it warms it almost seems like it should be a little thicker. I guess for an APA, its really quite nice. Anyway, that just enhances the drinkability. Goes down smooth and has the flavors and aromas that are still enough to get me excited each time. Beers like this one are hard to come by. You can tell that they put a lot of work into it to make it just right. As far as superior quality and product goes, SN does it again. While this reminds me of Torpedo in a way, its a very different beast and hop lovers should seek this out immediately! P.S. I dont think Ive ever enjoyed burping up hops this much! Fresh hops rule!"
"Although it's listed as a pale ale, it definitely reminds more more of an IPA. There are plenty of others out there I'd reach for before this, but it is a nice change of pace and the price was quite good."
"Finish - The beer is, as abovementioned, very well-balanced and surprisingly smooth. Gives you a lot up front, but mellows out so well on the back end. Wonderful finish."
"D - Though not quite as impressive as Sierra Nevada's wet-hop Harvest offerings, it does take a fairly unique approach with the hop flavor. This guy walks a fine line between APA and IPA; either classification would fit, though it doesn't feel nearly as sessionable as many above average beers in the aforementioned styles. A good beer, but I think it's flavor has been surpassed by Chico Estate and Torpedo."
"Feel was very smooth and deliciously resinous though the carbonation might have been a bit too high. Overall creamy and very drinkable for a beer that approaches 7 percent."
"D: Very tasty stuff, pleasurable to drink a 24 oz. bottle and something I would return to. A bit spicier and stronger than a standard pale, but also forces me to savor the fresh hops flown in from NZ. It is a letdown that prices are up 25% over last year though."
"CHEERS!"
"So yeah... this is a Weird Pale Ale (WPA) and one that appeals largely on its drinkability, solidness, and endlessly unusual hops. If you're a hophead, or a fan of slightly off-kilter beers, (like me) this will be right up your crooked little alley. And it's so cheap! $4 for a bomber plus. Yeah, I like it. Props to Sierra Nevada for keeping things real in Chico. -drains his glass, happily-"
"D- There is something a little off here and I can't put my finger on it. I don't know what happened to the beer or if it's how it is suppose to taste. I will get another bottle and try another but if this is how it's suppose to taste I don't know if I could drink this on a regular basis."
"I don't often give that many 5.0 scores to a beer but this one really is something special. It has a beautiful copper colour with plenty of rising bubbles and big white head that leaves plenty of sticky lace. As soon as the glass comes within sniffing distance of the nostrils I know I'm about to get a beer of the highest order. Citrusy, piney resinous hops are there, a slightly yeasty aroma, and a touch of fresh cut grass. The malt character of this beer makes itself known in the mouth, balancing the abundant hops nicely. When the beer falls down the back of the throat there's a bitter finish but the sweet malt remains on the tongue. It doesn't get much better than this. I'm glad this is only available for a short while - you really can have too much of a good thing. Like summer, an Ashes series against the Aussies, the day the clocks go forward, Wimbledon, Friday evening, standing on Waterloo Bridge watching the sun go down, and falling in love again, it's something to look forward to."
"Split a chilled bottle of the 2009 edition with my wife; poured into a standard pint glass. Reviewed from my tasting notes. The beer is a dark copper color. It is very pretty; it has a nice color and is quite clear. There are many tiny bubbles rising up to form a modest white head. The beer has a great hop bouquet that is noticeable as soon as you lift your glass to your face. The aroma is of fresh floral hops. It has a crisp, carbonated, hoppy taste. It is very bitter. This isn't necessarily a bad trait, it just took me by surprise. There is some malty sweetness to the taste hiding behind the strong hop flavor. It has a dry finish. Overall, I think this beer might be a bit to hoppy and bitter for me to drink all night; I prefer a less strong hop presence in a session beer, but I could certainly enjoy a bottle or two in an evening. Recommended, especially to you hop heads."
"Another stellar offering from SN. If you like hops, if you love fresh hop flavor, this is the beer for you. You can tell the hops are fresh as soon as you smell it. And the fresh hops are really apparent when this brew hits you mouth. Its as if the randal was invented to imitate this beer! Every time SN release a fresh hop ale, it delivers, and this one delivers as usual. Bravo SN, you did it again!"
"Pours a somewhat non-transparent amber orange colored body, with a big foamy off-white head, with good lacing. Very fresh hop aroma, green smelling almost. Some citrus, and some dryness. Cirtus, maybe columbus. Some slight bitterness. Bitter taste, some citrus and lots of nuttiness, maltiness. Bitter, grapefruity taste. Drying."
"Prost!"
"Very light mouthfeel for a whale of a taste. A very big beer for one that was so very smooth and satisfying to drink. I'd just finished mowing the grass, and it was thirst quenching in addition to be being very very tasty."
"A very satisfying pint. I'll probably buy a few more."
"D - I went to the store to try another style of beer but an employee at the store convinced me to try this instead. I am sure glad that I listened I am going to buy a few more and let them age for a while to see how it changes."
"Great feel. Medium body, very creamy texture. Smooth drinker."
"D - Really hop forward - bitterness is slightly harsh compared to some of the best pale ales and IPA's out there. Not as drinkable as some others, but still leaves you wanting another."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking, and a beer I enjoyed. In terms of value, it's difficult for me to say I'd choose this over SNPA, for instance, since I thought the tastes were fairly similiar. Still, an enjoyable beer."
"Pours a dark copper color with a slightly off white head. The head is large but not long lasting. Great lacing at the top of the glass. It smells of hops and butter with a bit of caramel. The taste is decently sweet with a bitter finish. Carbonation is perfect, but the beer is a bit thin. Solid beer."
"10oz serving on-tap at The Pit served a crisp bubbly copper with a frothy diminishing head. The aroma is a surprising balance of hops and sweet malts. The taste is loads of Earthy pine hops backed nicely by caramel malts. The beer is light, crisp and quite refreshing. Spring is the perfect time of year for a fresh hop beer, too bad nature makes go across the world to make one."
"Not a bad beer, I'm glad I picked it up to give it a shot, just not really my exact cup of tea (or beer as it were)."
"24 oz bottle from the second release. Pours clear copper with a large, off-white, meringue-like head that lasts quite a while and leaves nice lacing. Smells heavily citric, with lots of grapefruit-like hop character. Sweet overall aroma. Taste echoes this in that it's almost all sweet grapefruit, with only a mild resinous bitterness. Some biscuity malt character in the background. Light-medium body with medium-low carbonation."
"D: Its good... Don't get me wrong here... this is a decent pale ale, just was expecting a bit more from a beer with high reviews, and was perplexed by the lack of hop flavoring from a beer with ""harvest fresh hop ale"" in the name... oh well... i'll get my hands on a bottle and give it another shot since i like just about everything else sierra nevada has done between torpedo, harvest, chico, anniversary and celebration"
"A very nice pale ale, similar to SNPA but with a more resiny and hoppy characteristic bordering on an IPA. A great malty backbone counters the hoppiness producing a great beer. I also loved the New Zealand hops, something unique about them. Highly recommend."
"[2009 - 2nd release] Sierra Nevada Southern Hemisphere Harvest is a clear amber ale with a huge, yellowed, off-white head that's bubbly and foamy. It exhibits outstanding retention and leaves outstanding lacing. It has a fresh, spicy hop aroma of pine and orange peel and perhaps some mint. It has a smooth medium body with a clean finish. It is well bittered and well balanced. The full hop flavor echoes the notes of the aroma. The malt is biscuity. Man, this is so good-- I love Sierra Nevada!"
"The feel is milky and dense. Has the feel of a creamy Imperial IPA. It's a damn solid IPA. Nice-bodied and easy to slug down. No burn and very little bite."
"I've been to New Zealand and all I saw was lots of sheep. I would love to go back with the intent of checking out the hops. With out a doubt, one of the best places on Earth."
"Overall, this beer is somewhat more tame than I was expecting. Not all that complex for a beer advertised as a ""Fresh Hop Ale", which definitely keeps the focus on the bitterness. Nevertheless, the kind solid offering you would expect from Sierra Nevada."
"I much prefer the Harvest Wet Hop Ale over this release."
"I definitely enjoyed this, and the sharp freshness of the hops is clearly an asset, but the taste itself is very reminiscent of several of their other brews, including Torpedo and Celebration. Note: this is not by any means a bad ting, it's just not terribly original. Tasty. If you like Sierra Nevada's others for hopheads. you'll like this."
"Tasting really fresh and quite resiny and earthy. Not extremely pungent or floral, and I guess I prefer a more tropical mix of hops. Damn tasty though."
"D) Easy, too easy as large gaps in the tidemarks show. I got this bottle late for various unimportant reasons and was worried I would be tasting a faded glory, but this is still in great shape and enjoyable."
"This is a big beer, very filling and a bit dehydrating. It's got very good hop qualities but the huge malt body is a bit too bit to call it refreshing. One 24oz bottle and I am freaking full! A good experience for sure, but one is enough for me. Cheers!"
"Drinkability- Hop lovers will just love this. I do and have purchased at least six bottles since it came out."
"Drinkability is good. I'd give it a little bit higher, but the bitterness of the aftertaste lingers a bit too long on the back of the tongue."
"D: Easy drinker. I drank quite a few of these bottles when they first came out and now to revisit it on draft is a treat...I'll have another one please!"
"24 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Brewed with pale and crystal malts, bittered with Pacific Hallertau and finished with New Zealand's Motueka and Southern Cross; 66 IBUs. It pours a dark coppery hue, unfiltered, with moderate carbonation and two fingers of loose, tan head that leaves big sheets of lacing. Surprisingly light in the nose, with spicy and citric hops. Peppery and citric hops on the palate, with tropical fruits, tobacco, gentle orange pulp and strong citrus zest. Malts contribute light caramel and a little sweetness, while the hop's bitterness slowly becomes stronger and stronger. The body is almost medium, tingly and prickly, with a dry finish, and the flavor is a bit sharp to make it much more than a sipper. An interesting take on a fresh hop ale, but it wasn't as aromatic or complex as I thought it would be."
"D - Pretty good. I think I prefer the northern hemisphere wet hop ale, but this is very good."
"j."
"Great mouthfeel, full bodied and creamy carbonation that doesn't get in the way of the flavor. Really nice beer."
"Drinkability. High, not much else to say here. This is a great beer all around."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. and goes great with salty snacks"
"Taste - Great bitterness that wasn't overpowering. Nice maltiness to complement the hops. Some orange citrus flavor, but was very subdued. Highly drinkable beer."
"pours a dark copper color (almost cloudy) with a nice thick white head. Aroma is hops, honey and some citrus. Taste is an easy hop. Not strong or bitter, very easy to handle, and is very smooth. A little malt is present as well. A very good beer, easy to drink, little dissappointed that the abv is 6.7%, wish it was stronger."
"D - Drinkability of this brew is nice. I have definatly put down some of these over the summer and I'm happy to find it again in the middle of the arctic-land that is Michigan in January!"
"Pours with a large tight flesh colored head. Very light carbonation, clear dull copper color. Very grassy aroma, green and hoppy. Smells sweetly of french bread, not cloying. Medium light body. Very well balanced, easy to drink. Some hints of clover, black pepper and arugula. Lingering aftertaste is bitter and sticky. Overall very tasty."
"Date consumed: 29 July 2008"
"D: I really enjoyed this one. Proof that a hoppy beer doesn't automatically need to be hyper bitter too. Very nicely done."
"D- Very enjoyable, I wish I had tried one right after release to compare how it has aged. It seems slightly strong and malty to be an APA, though looking at BJCP specs it is only slightly over the upper 6.2%abv."
"Brew seems a little strong, almost like an IPA. The Wet Hop Ale, imo, is better. This however is still excellent, don't get me wrong."
"Definently my favoite IPA or close... very close. The fresh hops give a wonderful complexity to the brew. My first wet hop ale."
"D- Low ABV. makes it partly sessionable. Goes down very easy. Love the drinkability of this one."
"D- I could definitely see drinking a few of these in a sitting."
"7/4/7/4/15 (3.7/5)"
"A very strong IPA, borderline Imperial. Pours clear and oily gold with a puffy white head. Thick lacing. Crisp, clean aroma of pine, mango, pineapple, and oranges. Taste is very citrus, with more grapefruit. Some soapy hop flavors, as well as pepper and wood. Loved it."
"Overall: This is a nice beer. The hops were definitely different from the standard Sierra Nevada varieties. A nice treat."
"A beer I will look forward to tasting each year."
"Drinkability- Not great, not bad."
"Highly recommended."
"Despite all this, I think its a fantastic concept (southern hemisphere, etc) and it was by no means a bad beer, just not what I expected. Should we penalize SN for that? Certainly not; this is a great, refreshing and interesting brew."
"Overall this is one amazing brew and something that I look forward to having next year."
"Fantastic brew - I wish I'd picked up a couple more."
"Poured to a medium colored, ever so slightly hazy orange-red, with a medium off-white head that lingered well and left good lacing. Aroma was an immediate blast of hoppy citrus grapefruit. Mouthfeel was bitter to start, but as the beer warmed, this rounded well toward a bit of a malty sweetness. Flavor was a continuation of the nose and mouthfeel...bitter hoppy citrus to start and a warming, earthy malt taste to finish. A very good beer!!!"
"Drinkability - Solid drinkability. I was lucky enough to have this on tap a few times over the summer. It's a great beer on tap or in the bottle. Hop bite is razor sharp. Bitter, but not overpowering. Excellent brew. I love all of the harvest series."
"Solid beer. And I didn't even have it at its freshest."
"Drinkability is good but only if you like plenty of bitter hops."
"D - Nice beer."
"M/D - not a bad brew at all, the hop bite at the end was just a bit too much for me, not as smooth as i would hope for"
"Throughout I felt like I was drinking a top notch ale that I would only too gladly return to."
"A: Nice chunky head, lingering lines on the glass, vibrant peach color - 4.50, S: Some of the zesty and peppery hops, a little more earthy as one might expect from a fresh hop ale, not an overpowering aroma - 3.50, T: Lots of spicy and extremely bitter hops, sour grapefruit, a nice balance of malt, for a pale ale this is a solid beer - 4.25, M: 4.00, D: I recall first having a Sierra Nevada fresh hop beer at a tasting at the Brickskeller in DC and it being the best of the bunch, this one is quite tasty but not up to the same scale, still a solid beer - 4.00"
"I'll certainly pick up one next summer & try it soon after it comes off the shelf. Might be even better then."
"I'm very pleased with this Southern Hemisphere Fresh Hop Ale. The spice lingers in the back of my throat while the citrus is biting the tip of my tongue. All the while there is a sweetness from the malts. Really a nice beer."
"D: I'd have to say mediocre. Even to a hop fan, I can't imagine thinking this is very interesting. Probably the first and last one of these I try."
"Overall: I liked this beer quite a bit. I will buy it as often as I see it. I think that Sierra Nevada is hit or miss. This one is definately a hit."
"Overall, this is a fine fresh hop ale. Probably for hopheads only, though."
"D-Very high, very very high. very smooth, light and tons of flavor. Very nice brew."
"Drinkability is great. A well balanced pale ale with a moderately low-abv. Can't go wrong."
"In a world of gaudy, exaggerated engagement rings (read: most DIPAs), this classily styled offering strives for and achieves beautiful color and clarity over sheer ""look at me"" size."
"Poured a nice copper orange color with a nice off white long lasting head. Has a nice hoppy and citrus aroma coming from it with definite lacing left over. It is a delicious medium bodied beer that has a nice citrus and very hoppy taste to it. Hard to find though. I suggest that if you can find this one scoop it up. They are very easy to drink."
"Color is clear amber/orange with a good head a good lace retention throughout. Smell is hops and malt, the taste is the same with the hops taking the lead. A very good balanced brew and one I like to grab when I can find them. Drinkability is excellent, but due to the difficulty finding I wish I could find more on a regular basis."
"D: Excellent. I'd serve this as my late season barbeque beer. Great for tailgating. I'm considering buying a case before this runs out. Gives Sam's imperial pilsner, harpoon's leviathian IIPA, and lagunitas 13 a run for their money!!!"
"D-Drinkability is very good. A very comfotable, nice drinking beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with a solid creaminess from the steady carbonation, making this an easy drinking beer overall. Overall, I'd grab that original Harvest before this as I'm not a huge fan of the New Zealand hops apparently. Still, I'm glad I grabbed a bottle and gave this one a try."
"Poured from 24oz bottle orange-apricot in color with a one finger sized long lasting head. Noticable lacings left on the glass. Nice citrus and hop bouquet. Fresh hop spiciness throughout, from start to finish with some malt undertones which tend to be more noticable as I get through my first pour. Nice bitter bite with a balance of malt and hops on the finish. Crisp, clean and very tasty!"
"Overall: yummy"
"The beer pours an amber orange with an off white head that leaves a ring and wisps of foam that never fade. This foam leaves bits of lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is full of caramel malts and floral hops. The flavor is similar but also introduces some piney hops. I had had this on tap on a previous occasion, when it was admittedly fresher, and it tasted a bit grassy. None of those flavors are present here however. The Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a fair amount of carbonation, appropriate for a pale ale. Overall, a drinkable pale ale, borderline ipa, similar to a lot of SN beers. Quite enjoyable."
"D: Very high. Starting to disappear in a couple areas i frequent in N.& So.Cal. Think I'll be saying bye to this one until next year."
"This beer pours a brown color with a huge cream colored head. The aroma is fresh and piney with a definite degree of malt noticeable - the sweetness gives it a nice balance. This initial sip is all hops. It is bitter and again, the evergreen/pine flavor is noticeable. The finish is bitter as well. The mouthfeel is thin to medium, and seems to work well. Overall, this is a very good hoppy beer. One that I think would best be served FRESH!"
"5/16/09 edit: 2009 version. Still an excellent beer. It's a punched up SNPA with the sort of mild bitterness that lacks any astringency that only seems to crop up in these wet hopped beers. The hops coat the mouth with the flavor of pine resin and a touch of grapefruit rind."
"This is a straight up, enjoyable experience. This APA has the best of all worlds...A moderate ABV, Full flavored, with a great hop and malt balance, while retaining its smell throughout."
"Quite enjoyable with a bit of warmth. Tighter than expected but solid nonetheless."
"Crazy drinkable. This is a brilliant example of the style and, if available, you should not hesitate to try it."
"D - Excellent beer. One of Sierra Nevada's finest specialty beers. Fresh, complex, and very Sierra Nevada. Great beer!!!"
"This is a very good beer, with plenty of great Kiwi hop characters. As an Antipodean myself, it's a shame I have to come up here to get it."
"By about halfway through the double-size bottle, I feel like this is just a somewhat strong version of the typical American pale ale. The huge floral attack of the New Zealand hops is pretty good, but after that it's nothing particularly special."
"I thought this beer was going to be a hop monster, but was surprised by how well balanced it was. It's almost like drinking a 'lite' barleywine."
"I could drink this all night long -- or at least until the 6.7% ABV finally got to me. A wonderfully, distinctive APA that is certainly worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, citrusy, with standouts of lime and grapefruit clinging to the palate."
"This is a great beer. I really enjoyed it and would love to have it again."
"D - Overall great stuff here. I'm hoping this becomes a regular seasonal release. I split the bottle with my wife and I'm a little disappointed that I don't have another, but no worries plenty more beer to drink."
"Light amber hue with decent head sits in the pint glass. Floral, citrus aroma with hops hiding in the bushes ready to ambush. And here they come for your money and its worth every penny. Delicious sweet note hops initially, followed by spicy hops and desert dry finish create a wonderful appeal to this brew. This might be the freshest hops I've ever tasted in a beer. A tasty pale ale characterized by freshness."
"d: Another reminder that a Fresh/Wet hop style would be a useful addition to BA. Wonderful beer, I love the Harvest series from SN."
"D>sure!"
"Pours a clear orange/amber, thin white head forms, drops down to a thin ring, decent lacing on the glass, good retention. Smell is nice, fresh grassy hops, caramel, some bread, fruity, some grapefruit, apricot, some different hop character than normal, couldn't quite place the aromas but I liked it. Taste is nice too, again very fresh tasting, some caramel, melon, grapefruit, oranges and citrus, some grass, biscuits, nice fruity hops balance it out very well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth and goes down nice. I dug the hops they used in this, gave it a different element than a lot of other IPA's, it really tasted nice and fresh, good stuff."
"Big head, excellent lacing, big hop aroma, flowers, pine and citrus. The color is an orange/copper and cloudy. The initial flavor is creamy, back of the tongue bitter the hops just roll in your mouth, very nice. The body is medium, the texture creamy and the carbonation lively."
"D: Very drinkable. A solid. respectable APA."
"Pours out a nice amber brew slightly hazy with a one finger fluffy head.Medium carbonation rises slowly through the brew. Smells of grapefruity hops,,awesome aroma. Wow taste,,i had to give it a five.Some malty sweetness beautifully mixed with hop bitterness. No lingering effects,,just a nice clean brew. The last Harvest they had out was an exceptional beer,,this is a great seasonal and i hope they continue to produce it yearly.Mouthfeel is perfect,,not too thin,,not too chunky.What a great beer."
"I kept meaning to pick up a bottle of this and never got around to it, interesting that they brought hops all the way from New Zealand for this one, would drink again, recommended"
"Pours a copper color with a thick foamy off-white head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is floral, oats and malts but not all that exciting. Smooth citrus hoppy flavor combined with a solid caramel malt base make for a good tasting beer however. Nice hop bitterness. Very solid."
"Appearance has a nice reddish amber color with a healthy head leaving a nice lace. Smell has an orange sweet, buttery with malt and hops. Taste of malt, citrus, earthy pine with a good hop bite. Mouthfeel is viscous with smooth body. A dern good ale, the fresh hops are definately there, one might even consider it IPAish."
"Southern Hemisphere Harvest is a damn fine beer that hits all the high notes and leaves very little wanting. It goes down dangerously easy and was another great idea from Sierra Nevada. Cheers to them!"
"Drinkability was outstanding. I'm considering going out to buy a few more of these and making it a permanent part of my annual rotation."
"Mellows nicely with alcohol, hops & malt notes. Medium body & effervescence. Good brew, very IPA-like in body and flavor."
"A very tasty session beer and I'm happy I was able to try it this season."
"This one pours a darkish copper with orange hues with a frothy off white head that leaves nice lacing. A very nice citrus hop aroma with some sweet notes. The smell was underwhelming compared to the taste. The hop taste is super huge, not a super bitter taste, but the power of the hop is used well in this brew. The taste is not over the top, but still is full flavored. The mouthfeel is great because of the hop focus, the bitterness is expected but not experienced. A medium body and a good balance. This is a great beer, definitely for the hop heads, a great addition to the Sierra Nevada line-up."
"D: Wow. This is an excellent APA. The fresh hops are unbelieveable. I could (should) drink this for the rest of the night, but it's my only one. Decent ABV, but not overwhleming."
"I purchased a few extra bottles to store.. let's see how they mature over the next few months."
"A medium amber color with hints of gold along the sides of the glass. A half inch head forms, that is cream in color. The head shows tremendous retention. The scent of grass and earth are the strongest at first sniff, that is followed by a touch of citrus at the end. The taste surprisingly malty, with very mild bready flavor. The malt last till halfway where a grassy and citrusy bitterness takesover, it blends nicely from the malt and is not ovewrpowering. A medium bodied feel at the front and thinning out at the end. The back of the palate is left dry, after each taste. An evenly balanced beer, though it states it is fresh hopped beer. The title makes you expect more intensity in hops, though it does not reach those expectations, it is a very good beer."
"D - A fine drinker, and would do very well with a wide variety of foods. A hoppy instant classic pale ale from one of the great American craft brewers. I could do with another bomber."
"Overall this was a great brew that was probably even better when it was fresh seeing hoe its now mid august."
"MF&D - Slightly oily and sticky. A nice hoppy ale, but I'm not sure I could drink these all day. Overall a pretty good effort."
"Tan head but not much of it formed when I poured this beer and it retained very little. Dark amber or cherry wood color. Strong piney hops over alcohol aroma. Some intermittent lacing. Light to medium carbonated with a very forward hop heavy flavor. Cleary a fresh hopped brew, very 'green' in character and semi-spicy without being as sharp as an IPA. Could use a little more malted balance but GREAT for hopheads. Some sweet malt in the middle giving it a little body and depth. Bitter bite at the very end."
"Pours a hazy copper orange color, with a two finger head that settles slowly, leaving behind big, chunky rings of nice lacing. Plenty of carbonation keeping the off-white cap around for the long haul. Smell of wet, oily hop goodness. A bit of grapefruit, pine, and orange rind to round this thing out. Fresh hop flavor, a bit of sweet caramel malt, hints of orange and citrus, plenty of pine resin. Smooth, almost creamy in the mouth, goes down rather easily. A fantastic APA, most certainly more tasty and well balanced than their standard pale. Very good, and wish this could somehow be year round."
"D-Very good, crisp, light and enjoyable. A most well done job by the folks at SN to ship those Kiwi hops all the way to Cali and keep them fresh! Well done, barley able to notice any difference between this and the North American harvest ales which I love so much!"
"24oz bottle purchased for $4.45 from Wine Emporium in Boston. Pours a clear medium gold with little head but some lacing. Decent hop aroma, but was hoping for more from a ""fresh hop"" beer. Flavour is full and bitter, with hops that give the beer a warming sensation. Enjoyable stuff, though less floral and fruity than I associate with ""fresh hops""."
"Drinkability - This is a fantastic brew that I could sip on all night long. Unfortunately I only bought the 1 bottle, so that won't be happening all night long."
"D - What the dr. ordered for a hearty pale ale."
"D= Very good beer, but still disappointing because the bottle version is so much better. I recommend it to anyone wanting to experience fresh hops in all their glory."
"This beer pours a hazy burnt orange color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly leaving thick lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit with hints of pine and citrus. The taste is more rounded out than the aroma. Grapefruit, pine, and citrus all meld into each other. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and ample carbonation. Overall, with is a wonderful fresh hop pale ale. I could certainly drink this again."
"D: Highly drinkable due to the deliciousness factor. I'd enjoy another and would buy again."
"Not too drinkable because of the aftertaste, but a great taste nonetheless."
"i rather enjoyed this beer as a pretty sessionable beer."
"Displayed a nice clear copper color with a decent head when poured. Aroma was a very yummy (technical term) hop smell. Taste matched hop smell, medium carbonation bite, medium malt taste with slightly bitter aftertone. I really enjoyed this beer."
"The beer is clear golden-tan in the glass. Displays a few fingers of foam initially, though that quickly devolves into a creamy off-white sheen. Excellent lace retention on the glass. Very fresh, though not raw, aroma. The hops exhibit blended herbal, citrus, and pine tones. Flavor displays a nice balance of toasted malt and fresh hop notes. Tastes as it smells, with a bitter fruity finish. Body is rich, creamy, and filling; tending towards slippery oiliness."
"Poured into a true pint glass (Squatters) a very nice clouldy dark golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice one finger creamy slightly tan head, which leaves some nice thick creamy sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, with a nice touch of malts, some citrus. The taste is slightly sweet, hoppy, nice touch of malts, and citrus notes. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice APA, highly recommended, thanks Joe."
"Update: 2nd Release (2009) is earthier and a bit less lush than the inaugural offering, but still very falvorful and enjoyable."
"24 oz brown bottle I picked up for $3.99 at Greens in Columbia, SC. Pours a beautiful dark amber with a thick creamy head. Aroma is rich and complex, a good mixture of hops and malt. Flavor is all about the piney, citrusy imported hops with some sweet malts in the background. An outstanding beer. I hope they make this a regular."
"The flavor come across a little dry, malty and meaty with the hops feeling a bit like hay and grass with a spot of citrus blended in. The hops cling to the malt on the way down for a crisp flavorfull balance. Sweet dry hops at the end keep the glass tipping in your favor."
"This beer is extreme. Flying fresh hops from New Zealand to the US in under a week? Pow! Extreme indeed!"
"nice overall, and at the price you can't argue at all - glad i could try both ways."
" Very High quality stuff."
"I was told to expect something a little spicier with these New Zealand hops, and I can't say I got that at all. What I did taste was something quite similar to their Northern Hemisphere Harvest Ale, although a little more refined. The idea of importing hops from the southern hemisphere to brew a fresh hoped beer out of season was ingenious, but the beer itself was immaculate, and that is what truly impressed me."
"D- The bright hoppy aroma doesn't really follow through in the flavor. The burst of spicy hops is the highlight of this one but the flavor goes from slightly boring at first to awesome to a lingering bitterness that isn't really justified. I do like this one and probably will have it again-but it doesn't stand out."
"D: A damn fine brew. Here's hoping that this becomes an annual."
"This beer has most of the characteristics of an IPA, with an orange cloudy color, a slight head, and a modest lacing down the glass. The smell is mild, but the taste is bold, mostly coming in the hop-laden bitter finish that stays with you awhile after the last draw. It feels robust going down and leaves you feeling like you might want one more, but not two. At 6.7% ABV, two should be enough for a short evening session."
"Drinkability - This is an awesome beer, and every bit as good as the original Harvest as far as craftsmanship is concerned. I prefer the original Harvest as far as flavor and scent are concerned, but this will tide me over until the Fall season."
"D: I was expecting more of hop bomb than this turned out to be, and that is a very good thing. There's to many beers out there hopping a beer to death, the balance found in this beer was a great surprise."
"I've never had a fresh-hopped beer with hops so rounded, un-raw, and un-green, and it's a refreshing departure. No knock on the others, many of which I enjoy greatly, but the hops are multi-dimensional and mellow, and the ensuing balance is nicely enjoyable. It flows easy and drinks with a satisfying nature. It may not be a classic, but it's certainly fun while it lasts."
"Overall this Spring's Southern Hemisphere brew does not compare well to SN's utterly divine Fall Harvest release. I really want to love this beer as much as the fall release and it's definitely worth trying once, but the hop characteristics simply aren't very enjoyable for me. Bummer really."
"Poured a clear, reddish amber color with a substantial 2 inch head that hung around. Looks very similar to Celebration. Aroma reminded of fresh hop flowers. Taste was hoppy and citrusy, but with a good bit of fruity malts mixed in. A nice peachy, apricoty taste in each sip was noted. Mouthfeel was smooth and silky. making this easy to drink. Alcohol not detected at all. A very tasty beer indeed, similar to Celebration ale, but not as hoppy. Another winner from Sierra Nevada and it comes in a cool looking 24oz bottle!"
"Mouthfeel is on par with the style. Decent drinkability. Too bitter for a pale ale. I really enjoyed this but probably too much for an APA but a perfect IPA."
"Bought this at my local liquor store in a 24 oz bottle. Pours a reddish copper color with a two inch frothy head that leaves quite a lace on the glass. The beer gives off aromas of citrus and pine hops. The taste starts off real strong with the piney hops and a little citrus kicking in before a slight sweet malt taste hits the tongue then the hops come back. The beer actually finishes with a strong hop bitterness that leaves a strong aftertaste, but a nice one. The taste is exceptional and well balanced, another great beer from Sierra Nevada. The mouthfeel is very smooth with a nice light creaminess and slight oily feeling on the tongue. The hops are not overwhelming which raises the drinkability of this beer."
"BV"
"Notes: Another winner from Sierra Nevada. A bold and interesting APA with hops not normally found in American brews. The most smoothest and longest lasting bitter beer I've had in a while."
"Bring on the Chico Estate Fresh Hop!"
"This is my first go at any beer (as far as I know) that uses hops from New Zealand. I must say I am very impressed. I love the intermingling of different hop flavors. It's a touch on the bitter side (which I like) of being perfectly balanced. Great offering from SN."
"It poured a golden amber color and had a dense head. There were some very sharp, piney hop aromas at first, but they soon blew off. I was pretty unimpressed with the flavors at first. Tasted rather flat, but after some time in the glass, the flavor opened up into a nice balance of malt and hops. Very drinkable and refreshing. There is some real interesting hop character, but overall I was kind of disappointed after all the hype I had heard about it."
"great color and great smell, but the taste just dosent do it for me, the hops are a bit out of ballance, to tingley in my mouth, the malt could have been sweeter. i think that thay just missed on this one. i am wating for their cellabration ale to come out, that is the one i judge all their products to."
"M&D: Sliky smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation, makes for a great mouthfeel. The drinkability at 6.7% ABV is way up there. Overall, just a great beer. I think this the second best beer that SN puts out, next to Bigfoot, but for the style, excellent. Skal."
"Eric"
"Mouthfeel is rich and drinkability is excellent. I would like more of this stuff - get it while you can!!!!"
"D: Very drinkable, very delicious. Another great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"Sierra, bring this back next year please."
"Drinkability is excellent. Great for sessioning as the abv is not too high and the smooth balanced taste will keep you at the glass."
"not bad at all. that said, is it really all that unique?"
"The hop bite here is fresh as can be, with a real grapefruit and herb vibe. The malty caramel sweetness resides in the background, as to not interfere with the main event. Oily mouthfeel leads to a dry, flowery finish to create a hell of an enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"D- Drinkable- why yes, in fact I'm kicking myself for not buying more. Thank you Sierra Nevada. I'm looking forward to Telluride Blues and Brews because of the fact that they are the official brew for 2008. Yeah!!"
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a nonic. Light orange-amber with a frothy white head. Nice lacing. Aroma is a little light compared to other fresh hop ales I've had. Zesty spicy hops and some sweet caramel malt make up the aroma. Flavor is grapefruity and orangey with a spicy sharp zing at the finish. Pale and caramel malt underpin everything. Very good mouthfeel, hoppy and semi-dry, nice drinkability."
"The beer is a bit hoppy and spicy, but it's not as big as the fall version. The malts are quite tasty though with a nice caramel flavour. The hops have hints of citrus, but it's not too strong. The flavour is good, but isn't that tasty. The mouthfeel is creamy and carbonated. The beer is decently drinkable."
"D - this is really quite enjoyable. A seriously hoppy APA that goes down really nicely and doesn't seem like 6.7%. Would definitely recommend giving a shot, and look forward to finishing the 24 oz bottle"
"A good pale ale with a unique hop bite."
"D: It was hard for me to slow down with this beer. I found the piney and juicy bitterness so compelling that I felt like I guzzled it! This is an excellent APA."
"A nice, solid pale ale."
"Additional notes: Drinking the 2012 now (on 5/23/12) and it seems sweeter than I remembered. Bitterness lingers on the palate in the aftertaste, however, and there's a touch of spice that I don't recall from past experiences with this beer."
"D- This is quite nice for a pale ale which actually verges on being an IPA. The flavors are complex and big and its also light enough in body and alcohol to be very refreshing. Definitely a beer I could session."
"D: Good drinkability, a refreshing different hop utilization puts a good spin on the style. A very nice drinking apa and at the right price ($3.99 for 24oz) it's one you cant pass by."
"Very dirnkable, this goes good with just about any food or as a standalone. I just wish the aroma was more standout. All in all, a good solid beer."
"Overall, it had a medium body and was very easy drinking. Another excellent brew from our friends at Sierra Nevada."
"D This is a very drinkable APA-plenty of fresh hop flavor. I could drink a few and not get tired. I am glad this continues to be offered by Sierra Nevada."
"Overall I nice one-off I enjoy while it lasts."
"Fairly drinkable but didn't set my palate on fire."
"D: quite good."
"I have been enjoying Sierra Pale for a long time and this is even better in my opinion, a real treat if you can find it."
"I know that I would have this again. My nephew Zak liked it too but not as well perhaps as I did."
"A highly drinkable brew and a great Pale Ale. Very easy to knock back back the whole bottle."
"Drinkability: Very nice. I could drink a few of these. Another great beer from Sierra Nevada."
"For this hop head, 24oz of this guy wasn't enough. Only a shade under 7% and pretty easy to drink."
"Overall, pretty solid beer."
"D: a nice summer beer for a hot day. I really like this beer, and for $3 a peice I could really get used to drinking this."
"d: nice blend of hops and a decent hoppy beer but no big kick for hop heads"
"This beer, available for the first time in bombers, is pretty much all over the place by this point. I picked up a bottle of this before a radio show I do sometimes and it treated me quite nicely. Pours a beautiful dark gold color with a huge head and a very refreshing amount of carbonation. This is a balanced beer, not an over the top Hop Monster, and with a relatively low < 7%ABV, a very drinkable beer indeed. There's a lot of good malt, a lot of good hop spice, flavor, and aroma, and Sierra Nevada succeeds again in the realm of highly quaffable session beers which aren't boring, bland, or shallow. This is a truly great beer for Summertime when you want something a little on the darker side of a Pale Ale or Lager. Enjoy it while it's around."
"A light golden ale, darker than straw witha little ruby tint, witha clean, fluffy white head that lingers for a bit. Strong citrusy hop nose, orangey rather than grapefruit continues with a strong fresh hop bite on the palate. Light biscuity malt back bone that's a bit too weak for the hop, as intended, but for me the hop is a bit grassy, chewy, and takes away from the beer overall. Sharp, lingering grassy aftertaste as well. While a noble experiment that I'm glad to have participated in, it misses the mark compared to SN's previous fresh hop ales with American hops. Thanks for the hard work, but I'll stop at one."
"M: Smooth and somewhat creamy with a little puckering bitterness right on the end that carries into the aftertaste. Tannins really do some work on your tongue."
"All the flavors are light and in good harmony. Superior to the kegged version, I think, and a fine, fine drink."
"D- all summer long"
"Hey, I'm preety impressed with the NZ hops used here and in fact, pretty impressed with the whole drinking experience. I would buy this again, no problem!"
"Pours dark amber to maroon, mostly clear with big lasting offwhite head that leaves chunky lacing. Smell is fresh, spicy, sappy and fruity hops. Really nice. Taste is sweet and hoppy with a spicy, tingly and bitter bite to the hops. Very fresh, and nicely hopped and slightly sweet up front but leaves a light lasting bitterness in from the finish. Slightly rich body, nice somewhat soft carbonation. Really tasty. I like this one more than I remember liking their other fresh hopped beer."
"D- This is a unique beer for sure. Very enjoyable. Almost a little rich though."
"Poured a cloudy rust color with a thin layer of off-white head, sticky lacing. Smells of pine, caramel, biscuit, tangerine, orange peel, and a bit of alcohol as it warms. Tastes of grapefruit, orange peel, and tangerine up front followed by bread and caramel. Finishes with lots of pine notes along with dry grassy and spicy hops and a touch of alcohol. Medium in body with lots of bitterness. Not as good as their regular harvest ale, but pretty darn tasty stuff."
"Definitely recommended."
"D: Very high, however this is definitely not a session beer"
"drinkability: nice"
"Overall a good beer. Easily pairs with any American style cuisine. A refresher for a warm summer day. Good job on a bit of a adventurous attempt with Southern Hemisphere Hops."
"i have drank a few of these now since they came out and i dig it better now than i did the first time i drank it. i think it's worth seeking out. it does have a familiar SN flavor to it."
" I'm not sure if the hops used in here are american hops grown down there or if it's a local variety. This could rase some questions of terior with hops. i would also be interested in a harvest ale with southern hemisphere malts and cascade hops."
"I expected this one to be a hop bomb, but it's actually a refreshing beer, great on a hot summer day. I look forward to future releases of this. Recommended."
"This one is a nice bright glowing amber orange, with a hefty amount of white fluffy foam. Smells mildly of hops. I wasn't expecting a hop bomb after having tried their other harvest ale, and this isn't one. But it's a nice solid tasty pale ale, with a moderate dose of hops and bit more malt and ginger and cinnamon than you might normally expect. A great summer beer, and as it warms more flavors start to appear."
"D - Much what you would expect from a fresh hop pale ale - great aroma and pretty standard all-around pale ale. Good drinkability."
"Great amber honey hue with a lively carbonation welling up as the beer goes down. Nice bone white head laces down the entire glass. Nose is floral hops with a grainy base along with some grassy pine notes. The beer is very up front with sharp bitterness followed by herbal hops. There is a slight pine in here as well but the most interesting note is the peppered hop spice in the finish. Complex and easy drinking all at the same time with a subtle malt back that actually makes for more mouthfeel than expected. A fresh take with hop flavors that are nice a 180 from the heavy citrus bombs I've been drinking. Prost to SN for pulling this one off!"
"The best thing I've tasted from Sierra Nevada(and anybody else) in a long time. I hope they brew this every spring."
"Overall, an exotic beer. Different and well worth a try."
"Frank"
"A very well done fresh hop ale. Very similar in profile to a regular SNPA but the fresh hop profile comes through well enough to distinguish this one."
"Tasted on 5/28/08."
"GO GET ONE!"
"An all-around great beer!"
"Well done, fresh hop ale in the late spring - Thanks SN and Kiwis everywhere!"
"Very drinkable, especially considering the 6.7% ABV. Too big to be truly sessionable, but this would be a great beer to drink all night long with its flavour and depth. This is a nicely and almost aggressively hopped pale ale, that is highly recommended to those who enjoy hoppy brew or are looking at getting into hoppier brews. Hopefully this becomes a yearly seasonal offering, it was a pleasant surprise to find this at the Keyport in Superior."
"This is a mighty fine APA from Sierra Nevada. Clean, sharp, yet full-flavored and very easy to drink."
"Drinkability- This is edging on perfect drinkability, I'm very tempted to give this a 5. Smooth and very drinkable. This is one I look forward to trying again."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: I'll gladly pay the price for this at any bar or store, this is one to try, especially if you love hops. I'll be buying it again, too bad that the 2008(great 1st release) will most likely be gone soon. Hopefully 2009 is even better. Don't miss this one."
"This beer is all of what's best about their original Pale Ale, just scaled up to appease the more discriminating beer drinker. Amazing beer and price-pointed to move! Hat's off to Sierra Nevada!"
"Drinks really easy, can't really find any real fault with this offering"
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice amber hue with a large tight head. Mild carbonation that stays with the beer; it's unfiltered. The nose is of spicy hops, black pepper, and floral hops. The flavor is spicy in the back of the mouth. There is bitterness, but then peppery notes take over, closer to what you find with a tripel, but not the sweet malt profile. There is a buttery coating that seems to come from the hop oils. There is a malt taste that shows up to balance the ale. The body is full and hop oils coat the mouth quite well. I find myself being content with just one sitting of this. It is different in hop characteristic to their Harvest Ale, but that would be expected. The aftertaste of almost a toasted burnt consistency is hard to get out of your mouth."
"($4.79, 24oz, Oliver's Bev., Albany, NY)"
"Served in a pint glass from a 24 oz. bottle"
"D: I'm not an APA guy, but I could drink these all day."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer that is worth drinking for a whole evening."
"Nice."
"Quite a strong flavored Pale ale and is really a herbal IPA taste wise. Enjoyable and not a dumbed down beer. Only strike against drinkability is the strong flavor that might not be to everyone's taste."
"Find this while you can!"
"D: A very drinkable beer. A little pricey, but that is the way it goes."
"D - This was a really good APA. It is one of the hoppier APAs that I've had."
"I like what SN did with this. It's of course not the full blown hop explosian that the regular Harvest is but is instead a very nice counterpart to that style and beautifully shows another side of a diffrent type of fresh hops experience. What it does have in common is a great taste and big drinkibility. I'm sold!"
"Picked up at Olivers from their sole allotment of five cases. Nice amber/orange color with a fairly minimal head. Bringing the glass up for the first sip revealed a pleasant citrus aroma. The flavor is a nice hoppy, bitter one which you would expect from this type of beer. It finishes off with a pleasant, but not excessive, crispness. I like this one and am glad I picked up a case while it was available."
"Poured from a 24 oz. bottle, copper colored with a tan head formed of tight bubbles. A pleasant citrus (orange? tangerine?) aroma with hints of sweet malt. Nice pronounced bitter bite that also shows in the aftertaste. Medium body with a lot of carbonation - almost bubbly. Overall, a very enjoyable beer. Maybe too much character to drink as a session beer, but a balanced beer that showcases its hop profile."
"This beer pours a clear copper with some hints of a deeper red under a slightly off white head. The nose is very nice, as expected from a fresh hop beer, very floral, a little citrus, and some breadiness. The taste isn't up to the nose, there is an overall sweetness kind of candy like, but not as cloying, not a malty sweetness, I can't figure it out. There is a good spicy hop (peppery) bite at the end of each sip. It gets spicier as it warms up. The mouthfeel is interesting, like an oil slick riding on a clear lake. There are hop oils almost floating on the surface and then they get washed away by the clean body. Nice"
"Sharp and peppery flavor that showcases the fresh hops. Delicious, lightly toasted malt, with a zesty finish. Excellent beer to find on your taps."
"drinkability: I wanna take another sip, so I'd say it's pretty damn good."
"I definately say it's a drinkable beer. It's nicely balanced and not too hoppy or high in alcohol to make it one-and-done. Very tasty... only wish it came in a six-pack!"
"Pours a hazy burnt copper tone, with a frothy off-white head that laces nicely. Aroma is pretty straight forward, with fresh hops and a hint of buttery malt. Taste is a sweet toasted malt up front, that is quickly overtaken by orange peel bitterness, and a crisp floral hop bite that hangs on through the finish. Hop flavor comes to the front more and more as the beer warms. Slick on the palate and quite tasty overall. Very nice APA!"
"Poured a golden amber with active carbonation and fluffy white head that left sticky lacing down the glass. Smell is pretty good. Floral and spice with light malt. Kind of dry smelling, not as juicy hoppy as other fresh hop beers I've had. Taste is a bit better than it smelled to me. Still a spicy hop character but some good citrus flavors show up as well. Light caramel and biscuit. Also less dry in flavor than smell, with the fresh hop goodness coming through. Mouthfeel is pretty good with steady carbonation and almost creamy, just not quite like some of the better examples I've had when stinted by a somewhat dry lingering finish. Still, drinks like a champ."
"Southern Hemisphere is worth a try, but definitely fits its bill as a seasonal fun on occasion type of beer."
"24 oz bottle: Aroma has a nice pungent citrus hop note, some nice light malt characteristics, and some roasted malt notes as well. Appearance is a clear golden amber with a medium sized white head that lingers. Taste is up front wet hoppiness, citrus with a light pine twang, back end has a slight roasted malt characteristic. Palate is bitter on the tongue, lighting throughout with a decent hop finish. Overall, It's a nicely hoppy and pretty good IPA IMHO. It's doesn't measure up to Two Hearted or Centennial, but a nice drinker all around. Cheers!"
"24 oz. brown bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a slightly hazy reddish gold with a thin white head. Nice piney hop aroma that's not overwhelming. Also some caramel malt as it warms. Medium body with a decent malt backbone. Decent amount of hop bitterness with a slightly spicy hop profile. Good hop finish but not overyly drying. Very drinkable."
"This was quite enjoyable. If you're a fan of SN's other hoppy beers, I suspect you'll find this interesting. The southern hops were an interesting concept that I'd rate a success."
"Mouthfeel was dichotomous - smooth in the beginning but with a rough, husky finish. Thinner than expected despite the oily hops texture. Overall very nice."
"Clear copper with a long lasting rocky head. Nice lacing. Big piney citrusy hop aroma. Taste is thick resiny piney hops. Earthy. Very nice. Sweet malt backbone provides some balance. Pleasant bitter aftertaste. Full bodied coats the mouth nicely. Very drinkable even though it's big because it is so good. I'm surprised to find this classified as a APA instead of an IPA. Either way, an excellent beer."
"Wow!"
"Drinkability: A fresh and tasty brew that I wouldn't want to cellar at all. One of my favorite offerings from SN. I'd buy 6-packs of this if it were available, but the 24 oz. bottle is nice."
"Drinkability is very good. Not a huge beer and very flavorful. Makes you want more."
"For a fresh hop beer I definitely was not overwhelmed by hops on this beer. Instead it seemed to be a nicely balanced Pale/IPA. Recommended."
"Beer is good. Happy hoppy beering."
"As usual, the taste follows the smell fairly well. Up front is a big sweet caramel toffee flavor. Follows up with the nice piney hop flavors. Mouthfeel is about what is expected; medium bodied, well carbonated."
"Other than the hop nose being a tad tamer than I expected everything else about this beer was very enjoyable and unique. well woth seeking out."
"Not sure about pairings, but it went quite well with some fresh locally made cheese curds."
"D: The body cuts down on drinking a little bit. Low carbonation."
"D: The abv will not kill you but damn this is tasty. Definately a nice concept from Sierra Nevada. Normally I do not like their stuff but these fresh hop beers are great."
"This brew pours an orange/copper color, with a nice layer of foam on top. Smell is off sweet, caramel malt, and some spicy, slightly minty hops. Flavor follows suit, as a nice malt backbone comes through. The hops, while not as potent as the fall Harvest ale, are prominent, and are quite flavorful. Minty, spicy, and slightly floral hops are all over this one. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. This is a great brew from Sierra Nevada. A little gimmicky (Southern Hemisphere Harvest?), sure, but it's a well-crafted brew. I like the fall Harvest ale better, but this one is definitely worth trying. I'd love to have them both fresh to drink side-by-side."
"What a stroke of brilliance! Shipping hops from the Southern Hemisphere in order to brew a fresh hop ale during the Northern Hemisphere's spring. Since Sierra Nevada calls this 2008 release 'inaugural', it's obvious that they intend to brew it annually. Hallelujah! Hopheads rejoice."
"The beer pours a big fluffy head and the color has a orange/red glow. The nose: hints of mint and caramel. The taste: The malt flavor starts the show with rich caramel that leads to a spicy mint taste that fades into a mineral water mixed with dried cranberry fruit tones. Very unique brew cheers to Sierra thinking out side the box!"
"Very enjoyable, not quite as drinkable as the Celebration or last year's Anniversary ales, but a strong hop character with a well balanced, robust malt flavor. Yet another very good ale from Sierra Nevada."
"Nicely balanced ale, this...good sweet malt buttress, nice fandango of hop blitz, softly fading...Medium bodied, long, hoppy finish. Doesn't bother the tongue too much, which is good for some, but not for me. Very approachable ale, nice and even-handed."
"Though not quite as good as SN's regular Harvest Ale, this thing is pretty darn drinkable."
"Herbal bitterness and toasted malts up front. Bitterness holds as the malt becomes shortbread sweet with caramel edges. Light fruitiness and some anise in there too. Spicy, peppery hop flavors emerge. Minty, herbal, and just delicious hop flavors. Bitterness swells and lasts a long time in the finish. Medium body with a creamy feel. Very nice! Sierra Nevada just knows how to make pale ales!"
"Wont seek out further, not a favorite from these guys. Far from a bad beer, but a little one sided."
"I am a big fan of Sierra Nevada, and although this brew is pretty solid, I was a bit let down by its one dimensional taste and its familiarity with other Sierra Nevada brews (Pale Ale, ESB, Celebration Ale, etc...) and its inability to match their ingenuity."
"I like this beer. It is a bit heavier and more boozy than other alternatives so it somewhat limits drinkability. Glad I had the opportunity to try this beer."
"I just bought a case of 12 24oz bottles in PA for $43. A little over $3.50 a bottle and well worth it. I'm a big Sierra Nevada fan and this beer does not disappoint. A smooth/balanced beginning ends with a nice hoppy finish. I think its quite comparable to their pale ale, but a bit higher in ABV so watch out. More head than expected and little or no yeast left at the bottom of the bottle. That was a welcome surprise to me because I can have an allergic reaction if I consume too much."
"Overall, it was nicly balanced and it was not a too overly hopped beer. This was the first time I've seen this beer. I've never seen this in bottles before. I guess I have to look harder for this Sierra Nevada beer."
"Sierra Nevada Southern Hemisphere Harvest poured a deep amber color with a cream colored head. The head thinned into wisps but never completely went away. The smell was excellent with the hops being at the forefront of the aroma and the taste. The brew has a spicy nose with a subtle hint of caramel. The flavor profile is exceptional for an APA. Very hoppy up front with spicy notes and a lingering hop aftertaste that compliments the sweetness on the back of the tongue. This beer has a nice mouthfeel, not watery or thick. This beer is very drinkable if you pace yourself so to not be overcome by its 7% ABV. Overall an excellent offering from Sierra Nevada! To give a con for this brew; I think bottle conditioning it would have added a very nice touch and made the complexity of this beer even more prevalent."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades slowly and leaving some lace. Crystal clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Slight hoppy nose. Flavor starts almost sweet but like any IPA the hops are here but not overpowering. Slight bitter, lingering finish. $2.99 for a 24oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma also $4.25 for same bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Pair it with New Zealand cuising! Not sure what that is, but maybe some research would be fun."
"D: This one has fairly high drinkability but the bitterness is pretty strong. Still, one of Sierra's best efforts."
"Would buy again."
"D - Great beer. Not as forward as the tap version, but well worth seeking out, especially fresh."
"On tap at the 1st Street Draft House in W-S,came in a 12oz nonic a a clear copper with a tight clingy 1/2 white head.Citrus and pine wich wasnt unexpected dominate the nose along with a whif of caramel malt,a nice shot of fresh resiny hop really hits on the palate lingering into a biscuity slightly sweet malt base and then the hop profile shows through into a piney finish.I had this in the bottle and found it to be kinda boreing on tap the hop profile showed through much more."
"A very enjoyable hoppy brew. Hoppy citrus aroma, yes like an APA. Lots and lots of foam in my cup, that cushioned the mouthfeel and the hops were so pleasant and easily drinkable. Great summer refreshment. New Zealand makes the best beers in the Australian continental region, despite being a tenth of the population, is it the hops?"
"This would be ideal for drinking along with a cigar after dinner - once the temps cool off. In fact, buy a few of these and save them for the fall."
"Pours a slightly hazed copper amber hue with a khaki beige head, slightly dimpled texture going on billowing above the edges of my glass. Aromatics bring out ripened tropical fruit, citrus rinds, fresh cut green grassiness that just works in a cohesive force. It's like hop perfume basically very aromatic biscuit caramelized malts balance it out nicely. Flavors work so nicely, SN has been doing this for years, lip smacking bitterness fades as the malts blend so cohesively with the big hop layers going on. A perfect marriage of the malt and the hop, citrus rind, tropical fruit, grassy hops collide into a wave of fully fermented malts caramelized sugars breathe a bit of alcohol depth to add more complexity. Mouthfeel is slightly resinous medium bodied but refreshing with each sip, the dichotomy of drinkability and big beer in one glass. Overall I never pass on either version of Sierra Nevada Harvest, plus it's always pretty damn cost effective on top of the quality of each bottle I've tasted."
"Pours a clean copper with orange hues and a nice two plus finger light tan head that recedes slowly, leaving a chunky lacing behind. Smells of brisk hops up front with an undercurrent of citrusy goodness and an essence of pine. Tastes big on the hops up front with some astringency lurking behind along with a very faint taste of oranges and a modicum of chalkiness. After a few drinks some sweetness reveals itself. Mouth-feel is medium bodied and robust and it's fairly well carbonated. This one isn't quite as balanced as I remember the harvest ale, but is good nonetheless."
"D: Sierra Nevada does it again. Nice balanced hoppy brew."
"Orange color and looks about the same as Celebration or the regular Harvest Ale. Nice green hoppy smell. The taste seems to follow with a nice fresh hoppy flavor that is kinda grassy. This is very similar to the other Harvest Ale which I happen to prefer."
"Thank you Sierra Nevada!"
"Pours a clear golden amber with a creamy, light tan head. Smells of freshly cut flowers, with a hint of vanilla. Taste is surprisingly malt dominated, with a floral, piney hop taste to counteract. There is a hint of freshly cut grass as well. Bitterness is very dominate as well, but in a good way. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Very drinkable, especially at 6.7 percent alcohol. Different from your average APA, these New Zealand hops are a great contrast, and I plan to enjoy a few more of these this year, and await next years batch as well."
"Mouthfeel is silky and oh so pleasant. Everything about this beer screams soft, earthy, and balanced. I appreciate Sierra Nevada going that extra mile to bring this beer to the public year round. The original is still a little better, but I'm splitting hairs. Highly recommended."
"D - Another winner. A quenching hop bitterness and smooth feel make this one easy to quaff."
"almost makes me want to buy a plane ticket for later this summer when their own Chico hops go into the next Harvest Ale..."
"This one had nice flavour and balance overall. The fresh hops add a nice bitter quality to the flavour that's a bit different but good. Certainly worth a try and your time."
"Drinkability- Quite a fine brew. Hoppy for sure and worth seeking out."
"Sierra Nevada Southern Hemisphere Harvest Fresh Hop Ale (wow, that's a mouthful!) pours a golden copper witha fluffy, foamy head. The aroma is dominated by grassy, herbal and slightly earthy hops. Some caramel malt comes through, but just barely. The flavor is bitterness at first, followed by herbal, spicy and earthy hops flavor. Dry maltiness comes through, but just barely. Not quite balanced, but a pretty decent beer. I'm confused about the idea of it being a fresh hop beer. According to the label, the hops are dried, so I'm not sure what differentiates the beer other than their used very soon after harverst."
"Taste- is very much hop-centric, but has a fairly decent malt balance. Tastes very much like a typical sierra nevada brew but with a very pronounced hop profile, as expected. Very predictable, and as predicted, it's pretty darn good but not enough to blow me away."
"Drinkability is moderate. Alcohol is reasonable and flavor is decent. Bitterness may eventually overwhelm."
"a nice simple, but tasty pale ale."
"Drinkability - not enough floral presence for my tastes. Those bitter-mongerers among us may well like this, though."
"Like the other fresh hop pale ales I have tried in the past, this one seemed to be big on hop bitterness but rather low on overall flavor. It was definitely a bit of a disappointment."
"I really liked the hop profile in this one. It was like an old school pale ale on steriods. Gotta love the freshness of this beer as well."
"All told, I enjoyed this oodles more than last fall's US version, or really, any SN product I've had in a while. The intricacies of some unusual hops (here, at least) play out well against a sturdy malt backbones. Yet it sucks down like a session beer that you've had a million times."
"Drinkability: Really enjoyable, with lovely fragrant floral elements and a nice balancing element of bitter flavor"
"Pours clear reddish copper with a thiick off white head that leaves rings of continuous bubbly lace. Smells strongly of citrus hops with a slight malty base. The aroma is increaingly malty as the beer warms up and the hop aroma dies off, approaching a good slighly bready smell. It has a nice crisp flavor. The flavor is mostly citrus hops upfront, but not overwhelmingly so. Slow transition to a mildly bitter aftertaste. This aftertaste seems to increase in bitterness a little as you make your way through the glass. It is a good tip of the tongue bitter that goes nicely with the crisp and realatively highly carbonated feel. Light to medium bodied and well carbonated. This iis an easy drinker with more hops than the usual pale ale. Pleasant and worth a try."
"bottle. the color of iced tea with a floral aroma. my girlfriend, who is Korean, said it smells like Korean barley tea. it seems to be very well balanced and easy to drink. there are certaily hints of apricot and grapefruit with a bitterness that lingers on the tongue. the hops are continuously present and actually a little spicy, just as the description indicates. somehow seems much stronger than 6.7%. i could drink this all night! i also like the rustic label with the map of New Zealand."
"An interesting beer. Pretty well-balanced, with a nice citric/lemon touch. Not one of my favs. from this brewery, but a nice enough, different, one."
"Had this on-tap at Roman's Pub in St. Francis."
"D- Eh, im good with just one bomber, glad i tried this one but it definitely did not wow me."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a rocky off white head. Mild spicy aroma. Taste is spicier, but with fresh hop bitterness and light nuances of malts. Still, quite strong and robust, but with rather noticable carbonation and good flavor."
"Find this while you still can! Personally, i'll be keeping a close eye out in the fall for the Harvest Wet Hop Ale."
"Although I finished my pint rather quickly I preferred Sierra's Harvest 2007 over the SH."
"Murky looking copper brew. Thin ivory white head. Bubbly near the edge. Lace is spotty and sporadic. Very nice aroma. Lemony and oily. Citric and Floral. Great combination of aroma traits from these New Zealand hops. I've been thinking of brewing an IPA using New Zealand hops so I'm eager to dive in here to this one of a kind. The bitterness is soft, yet substantial. Pine needle and lemon peel lead the way in this area (Southern Cross?). I love the oily texture and slight orange marmalade feel to this (Pacific Hallertau?). And I also get a lemon/lime type of yin/yang thing going on with tropical fruit overtures (Motueka?). To me, this hop profile is very appealing. But why no Nelson Sauvin? Anyway, underneath all this hop goodness lies a bed of pillowy caramel malt. Quite easy drinking and a pleasure to have a fresh hop beer in June. Cheers to Sierra Nevada and New Zealand!!"
"This is a great beer if you need to free base some hops to get your fix. Personally, I love it but not as much as the original Harvest Ale."
"Overall I was very happy to see this on the shelves in late spring/early summer as I am used to having to wait for the hop trip until the fall. I would buy this beer again and it was a good value at $3.99 for 24oz."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkability. Not my favorite but another pretty solid brew from Sierra Nevada."
"I've never head a fresh hop beer like this befor. Sort of a different hop profile all together than the other fresh hop beers I've tried. I like it and could have a few."
"This is a very nice offering by Sierra Nevada. The beer pours a nice amber with plenty of frothy white head and lacing. The aroma is characteristic of an APA. Most notable in this beer is the very creamy mouthfeel and nice thick hoppy taste, slightly oily, slightly bitter and tea like, and quite traditional. The beer is solid all the way around and easily drinkable. I had this at a friendly gathering so I didn't have the opportunity to contemplatively drink this, but it is a very nice beer worth seeking out. I will review this in more detail at another time. L'Chaim."
"Another great 'fresh hop' style APA from Sierra Nevada. The hops explode right out of the gate, and tend to dominate the flavor profile, but there IS good sweet malt on the back of the tongue. My only complaint is that it's $5 a bomber. I guess I should really just keep my trap shut considering the cost of hauling those hops from New Zealand to Chico!"
"Pours a golden amber with a thin white head. Excellent retention and lacing.Aroma is of piney hops,and grapefruit. Body is medium with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is nicely hopped,with grapefruit and pine throughout. There is a sweetness in the finish. Excellent!"
"O'all - More balanced than the 2007 NH Harvest Ale - this tastes like a professional beer and not a hop experiment gone awry. Hops dominate, but don't overpower. Highly drinkable."
"Overall a unique APA. Very spicy and herbal."
"The flavor is a little stronger than SN's Pale Ale in the hop department, but otherwise unremarkable. I'm not saying the taste leaves me uninspired, but with such a long, luxurious name as ""Sierra Nevada Southern Hemisphere Fresh Hop Harvest Ale", I expected a bit more. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, with a well-placed hoppy finish and a carbonation level that envigorates the palate. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Although it won't go down on BA as one of the top 100, it definately hit the style perfectly, making for a drinkable beer that I'll be sure to buy again."
"Pours golden copper with a medium light tan head. Strong aroma of fresh grassy hops, with notes of caramel and spice. Grassiness presents right up front, flowing through some caramle malty sweetness leading to a lasting bitter finish. This beer definitely highlights the fresh hops, which taste great. Would like to see a bit more of a malt backbone, but even still, an excelent beer."
"This is a good fresh hopped beer from Sierra Nevada. It's a treat to get a fresh hop beer in the spring like this. I wouldn't hesitate picking this one up again."
"Taste: Bready malt throughout with a touch of caramel sweetness. Hop flavor & bitterness is far less timid than one would guess from the aroma, but still very mild. Resiny grass & spice flavors roll in and coat the palate into the finish. There's very little struggle for balance here, the flavors meld quite well. Finish is dry and fruity with hop oils coating the palate."
"Note: for an APA, this is quite hoppy."
"D- This beer has nice hops with an interesting nose and a good support by the malt flavors. The bitterness nicely finished the beer but was not a dominating force."
"24 oz bottle into pint glass-- obviously not the whole thing at once. This beer has many of the characteristics that you come to love from SN. Fantastic aroma of hops, appealing appearance with a light golden body and nice lacing. The taste and drinkability were a bit less than I had hoped for, as I absolutely loved the Fresh Hop Ale. This one is a bit more bitter and stale, limiting a bit in taste and drinkability. Good, but not quite to the very high standards of typical SN ales."
"Overall let me preface this by saying I am a fan of SN and they make some great beers. The fall Harvest Ale is one of my favorites, however this beer just didn't cut it. It's not bad, it's just...average. It almost reminds me of a Hop Wallop light, with all the floral hops flavors. Anyway I'm glad I tried it, but I think I won't seek it out again this year, maybe I revisit it next year."
"Drinkability: Very good. Nice and hoppy but still mild enough to not overpower. The low ABV will help here as well. Nice beer and definitely worth a try."
"pours almost the exact same color as SN pale ale from a sweet 24oz bottle thats going to make a nice addition to my home brew bottle stash. small laced head. smell floral hop and citrus, very clean smell with some nice toasty malt in the background. very nice hop aroma. taste is sweet toasty malt with underlying citrus then an massive hop bitter with alcohol hop oil resin. Wow! this is really hopped up and clean tasting brew! very enjoyable! definitely a different hop taste. massive hop bitter aftertaste that lasts for days. If you're a hop-head you need to try this. i'm really glad i bought this 24oz of this. I knew Sierra Nevada wouldn't let me down. this is just the hop explosion I was looking for tonight. Medium carbonation. I could probably handle about 2 of these 24oz bottles then i would be plastered. But, most extreme awesome brew!"
"The beer poured redorange into the glass with a thick, rocky, white head that lasted and lasted leaving sticky lace all down the sides. Smell was all hops, really fresh smelling with piney and minty grass notes. Taste was a hop explosion in my mouth. The first thing that came to my mind was weed. Up front it tasted just like weed. Pine sap and mintiness were the first favors noticeable, then faded into lemony grapefruity citrus with a good tongue-tingly bitterness that lasted. ""Fresh Hop Ale"" is how this was described on the bottle and it fits this beer perfectly. At 6.7% ABV, it's definitely drinkable, and it's not too badly priced; I got a 24 oz. bottle for $5.19 at Consumer's."
"Drinkability: Fresh and lively, this beer is both affordable and drinkable. Could do 3 of these big bottles to finish off the night. More grapefruit would be preferred but isn't necessary. A solid brew."
"On tap at Brickstore Pub in Decatur, GA. Arrives a darker brown than expected for the Pale Ale, but nice tan head and a clear complexion. Smell of some hops and fruits, some orange and pine trees - very hoppy upfront, well done harvesting those fresh wet NZ hops. Taste hides those hops a bit, nice caramels and citrus, grapefruit - bitterness is well concealed and the alcohol lets you know its there, but not too badly. Nice. The high carbonation knocks it down 1 point on mouthfeel, but its a nice beer, very smooth, and nice lingering citrus. I could have 2 or 3 of these, but the lack of crispness hurts."
"Quite drinkable due to an easygoing feel. Stronger than most APA's however. I look forward to surprising a few Sierra Nevada fans with a bottle or two."
"This is an excellent beer."
"Pretty good for a fresh hop ale. I like this one more than the other Sierra Nevada offerings."
"pours a crystal clear copper with a one finger head that quickly dissipates, & spotty lacing. Aroma is pretty mild, with pine, citrus, & grass as the predominant scents. Piney, grassy hops hit the tongue harder than expected, considering the nose, with grapefruit & some caramel sweetness to back it up. Crisp & refreshing; a great summer IPA."
"decent head out of the 24 oz. bottle that is very long lasting. The color is a pleasing red-orange but there is almost no aroma at all. This seemed odd considering the very hop-forward flavor and the whole concept of the beer. The hops are quite bright and intense the instant the beer is in your mouth but the flavor seems to almost disappear within a few instants. There is very little mouthfeel and a very bitter aftertaste from the large amount of hops."
"D = High, a great fresh hoppy beer for the summer."
"Smell is of hops and a bit of pineapple citrus. Taste has an earthiness to it, yet very clean and really crisp on the palate, notes of pineapple and slight lemony goodness finish out this beer. It does feel a bit hot on the back of palate, but all in all not a bad brew."
"Dark amber red, substantial and sticky off-white head. Hops strike a nice balance between lemongrass, pine and hay, and there's a faint smokiness in the background as well. However, the overall aromatic intensity/expressivity is not quite what I expected. Not overly aggressive flavors feature some well defined fruit tones but are still decidedly hop-driven, with a building bitterness that ultimately kicks the roof of the mouth. Great texture throughout the mouth and great length on the finish. Never shows the alcohol, although it certainly is not thin or lacking substance. A refined drink that will still satisfy a hop craving."
"$5.99 at Wine A While in Mt. Pleasant, SC"
"Crystal clear copper. Generous bubbly head gives way to a healthy sheet of lace. Nice sticking all the way down to the bottom of the glass. Citrusy aroma with some caramel and earthy malt tones. Hop aroma is more subdued than expected. I'm thinking balence. Again some citric and tea like herbal hops combined with a nice balence of caramel, toffee, and toasted bread malts flavors. Finish is just slightly bitter. Alcohol is not a factor here, in fact I was surprised at the 6.7% abv. Another nicely balenced beer from Sierra Nevada. I really enjoyed this."
"D: The ale has a moderate alcohol level, greatly increasing the drinkability. I think that this ale will no hold up well over time, so dig in to it now."
"Overall: An excellent brew, just what I'd expect from Sierra Nevada."
"Medium body, with appropriate carbonation. Very well balanced. This is very similar to a couple other SN beers, but with just a subtle twist. I loved the juicy flavors in this."
"24 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an amber/copper color with a 2 inch frothy off-white head (after a fairly hard pour). Head retention and lacing is excellent. Aroma is citrusy and piney hops, with some caramel malt in there too. The taste is similar to the aroma. It's mostly citrus/pine/grassy hops, along with some caramel and biscuity malt. There's also a nice lingering hoppy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, and it's coating, oily and a bit thick with low/medium carbonation. Drinkability is very good as it's smooth and goes down nice and easy. I think this is a pretty solid brew, I'll definitely have to pick up another couple bottles of this."
"Good bit of body, moderate ABV, nice carbonation all add up to a highly drinkable and enjoyable ale that is some what unique. Will definitely enjoy this one in the future."
"Edit: I try not to read reviews before I try the beer, and after reviewing this one I read mattcrill's review, and maybe I'm having the same issue with this beer, but don't quite have the palate to discern the problem....but something just a bit off with this one."
"Got this one on-tap at the Reef Bar the other night. The waitress tried to sell it like it was the second coming of beer. Pours a nice looking copper color with a smallish head on top that didn't really leave much lacing. Nose is lots of fruity hops, as is the flavor. It's not supper hoppy (the waitress advertised it as an IPA, so I was a little thrown off), but it's fairly balanced, and highly drinkable. I'm surprised it's so high in alcohol, cause it doesn't show up in the least. Feel is a little watery, in my opinion. Overall, not bad at all, although I still prefer the standard SN Pale Ale. Would drink this one if it was offered though, no questions."
"Overall impression: This one is lost on me. If it's truly the S. Hemisphere hops then it looks like I'll be drinking/brewing less hoppy beers and using my good ol' N. Hemisphere hops. To me, all the ""less than desirable"" flavors seemed mostly malt driven (DMS, saltine crackers, etc). I'm giving SN the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they rushed this to market or I just got a bad bottle. Either way, I won't be hitting this again soon. I need to go brush my teeth with some Bigfoot."
"Sierra Nevada, you've done it again! You guys keep churning out one terrific brew after another and I keep buying them by the truckload...between this and the Summerfest, I will be spending quite a bit of time with your brews this summer..."
"D: Another very tasty and interesting beer from the guys at Sierra Nevada. My dad said, ""Yeah, it's pretty good."" Dirt cheap when compared with other special releases out there, I'd definitely have it again."
"Anyway this beer pour copper orange, almost a pale cranberry, with a thick white head. taste is intensely hoppy with a sweet finish. Th I detect herbal notes and noticeable malt flavor as well as sweet pine with a hint of citrus and dark bread. The beer is smooth to the tongue, slick and oily with lite carbonation. Drinkability is extremely high i you like hoppy, bitter and sweet which this beer excels at all the aforementioned categories. An excellent APA, I prefer it to their flagship APA."
"Drinkability: glug, glug, glug.... Oh, drinkability is off the charts great."
"I fantastic Pale Ale chocked full of hoppy goodness. Highly Recommended."
"So much better then their EPA. That fact that the hops used in this beer were picked processed and boiled in the wort within ten days on the vine is amazing. Kudos Seirra Brewing!"
"M/D - Medium bodied and very crisp. Good carbonation. A good pale ale but I think I prefer their regular pale ale over this one. Just a little too funky of hop taste."
"Overall, a very tasty pint. I'm not sure what the bottles cost, but if they're a high premium over the regular SNPA, I'd try one of these just to see what you think, but stick with the excellent original."
"Notes. I love this beer.I expected to be disappointed after all the hype that was surrounding this release.It did not disappoint."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D- A very enjoyable beer, so well balanced that even non-hop lovers will enjoy the beer."
"D- Easy to drink for sure"
"D: Goes down very easy. I've refilled this and fast"
"Pours a clear amber with a decent creme head. Leaves a fair amount of lace on the way down. Flavor is bitter in the hoppy way you'd expect. It's pretty earthy overall and a minor salt edge is there as well. Pine character is here too and I felt it showed up as the beer warmed. Carbonation bites and the liquid is typical. A nice APA. Not sure exactly why we need a year round version of this style, but that's American for you. Who cares if we need it. We can do it, so let's just do it."
"0.5L mug at Hollingshead's Deli. Pours a clear caramel color with a big rocky off-white head. Somewhat similar and maybe a shade darker than the classic SN pale ale. The smell was mildly hoppy in the earth and leafy sort of variety. The taste was divided between the caramel malt backbone and a citrus wave of hops. The finish leaves a moderate bitterness, in fact it left somewhat of a lingering unpleasant bitterness to me that I find in the SN Pale Ale also. Anyway, the taste was actually more similar to SN's other beers that all use Cascade, Centennial, and Chinook. Since this beer doesn't use any of those it surprised me how similar it was."
"Definitely recommended..."
"Several of my friends raved about this, so I not only bought a case of it, but tried it on-tap at Frisco. The beer poured a clear reddish-amber with a thin, rocky white head into a pint glass. Not much of a hop aroma, which was a bit strange. The taste, however, was a fantastic blend of malt sweetness, big hop flavor, building up to a clean, crisp, fairly intense, high-alpha hop finish. SN really knows how to balance the malt and hop profiles in their highly-hopped ales. A great beer."
"Sierra Nevada Southern Hemisphere Harvest Ale pours a dark orange with a thick white head from a brown twenty four ounce bottle. The aroma is fairly mild, hops are definitely present though. As the beer warms, the flavors really start to come out, there is a very piney hop character and a very smooth mouthfeel. If you are looking for floral or fruity hops, you're in the wrong place. Very enjoyable."
"Pours with a deep red-amber color, with brilliant honeyed highlights and a head that leaves some thick lace in spite of not retaining its form very well. The aroma is certainly identifiable as an APA, but the hop character has an earthy, herbal character about it that is different from that of a lot of American hop varieties. Malts come through, too, with a big measure of honeyed sweetness. On the palate, full bitterness throughout, with bright but soft citrus elements midway through. The finish dries out considerably, and the overall level of fruitiness is low. Great mouthfeel that combines lots of hop bitterness with a substantial, balancing load of caramel malts. Overall, this is excellent stuff. Once again, Sierra Nevada proves that they really know their way around a hoppy ale."
"Drinkability is high, wow. Nice price on this bigger then a bomber bottle, Sierra Nevada has the best special release IPAs in the biz, and this is my favorite of the bunch. The Southern Hemisphere Harvest is really brewed to my taste. I just had a bottle of celebration yesterday to refresh my memory, and as good as it is, I definitely like this one better."
"cheers"
"Cracked and poured from 24oz bottle into Harp pint glass. Firm pour yielded very minimal head (sub one finger). Minimal lacing. Color is nice golden amber. Nose is very floral, light citrus hops. Light citrus hops on the palate, carbonation is very fine and contributes greatly to the taste. Very balanced, definite malt presence, bitter and slightly dry finish. Very Nice Beverage!"
"Drinkability: easy to drink this one. This beer is a bit different than the hop harvest which I prefer, but definitely a tasty beer."
"A very good hoppy brew, easy drinking and light. Could drink this for hours, like most of SN's pale ales. Keep em coming."
"The mouthfeel suits the beer. The body's medium to light, the carbonation is noticeable but not overpowering. Utterly drinkable and at 6.7, not to much of a bruiser ot drink the 24-oz. bottle of in one go."
"I'm going to get more."
"I could session this beer all the time during the hot summer months despite it being 6.7%. It is probably at the top end of my abv threshold for session beers, but it is very tasty and easy to drink. I will pick up another when i return to the store if there are any left :)"
"Body and drinkability are pleasant, very easy to drink but doesn't really stand out."
"Pours a nice bright orange-with rocky off white head. Citrus and pine resin aroma hits you hard in the pour. Taste is more mute than I expected-the hops are not overwhelming-but instead a wonderfully mute and the malt is able to come through. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation low. Drinkabiity is good-I can have a few of these-no problem"
"D - Not bad at all, but fairly boring. I doubt I'd seek this one out anytime soon. I suppose it's worth a try if you find it, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this one."
"A nice treat to have a fresh hop ale coming out in the spring. I don't know if they has planned to brew this for a long time, or if it was an idea spawned by the hop shortage - but it's a fantastic idea no matter what."
"A really great pale ale, with enough bitterness to call that classification in doubt, and one you should definitely try out if you're a hophead."
"Recommended."
"D - another good tasting, 'easy to drink' brew from Sierra Nevada."
"If there were a keg of this stuff at my local store I would buy a couple of growlers and session both bottles one right after the other."
"but i recommend this beer."
"Excellent drinkability -- nice and full on the tongue with bitterness just a couple notches under IPA levels."
"Poured a nice orange color with average head with average lacing and average carbonation. The dominate smell is crisp fruity citrus hops and mild malts. First taste is light, sweet, and somewhat hoppy. Lighter tasting than I thought it would be based on the aroma. It could use a stronger malt backbone. It had a bitter finish and I have drank many ESBs that tasted about the same. Not a pae to me. To much bitterness for a Pale."
"Pretty nice refreshing and enjoyable."
"Pours a clear orange-amber with a large off-white head that coats the glass with sticky rings as it falls. Big sheets of lace and a persistent bubbly cap. Gentle, peppery, noble-like hop aroma. Leaves, grass, lemon, pine needles, earth, and sweetness. Hoppy flavor, herbal and peppery throughout, hints of apricot, finishing with a solid leafy bitterness and sweet grain. Quite different from most American-made hoppy ales...not so much citrus and resin. Solid medium body, solid bitterness, and solid carbonation. Very nice all around...a different kind of hop bomb. Now that I think about it, it's pretty similar to their pale ale, only bigger."
"Pretty tasty offering and gives a subtle difference in flavor over the normal West Coast IPA's. Probably not worth the money spent to import these hops, but tasty none the less."
"Poured a 2"" beige head that has outstanding retention. Thick, foamy lace. Beautiful, clear, amber-copper colored beer. Floral and citrusy hops over a bready, light caramel malt base. Hops are herbal and spicy, spicy, and spicy. Resiny. They keep hitting until long in the finish. THe malt is present and doing it's job with some light caramel flavor...but obviously this is about the hops. Excellent. Medium body with a good amount of carbonation and prickly hop bitterness. I don't know that I have ever had NZ hops...thanks to Sierra for this tasty beer. Fabulous drinkability."
"D: I really wish all these brewers making fresh hop APA would step up and make a fresh hop IPA. I understand the fresh hops are even more limited then normal but I know the fall's fresh hop sat around well past prime.. at least in my neck of the woods. Easy to drink but nothing spectacular."
"An unusual bomber sized at 24 oz. and shaped just like the regular Sierra Nevada bottles. When poured the beer was crystal clear and the color was pale tinged with red (I guess we can call it a darker shade of pale). The head atop the beer was only about one finger thick, but steady carbonation kept it quite stable, The beer smelled milder than a typical IPA, which has been my experience with most beers using wet hops. Despite the mildness the grassy and floral hop presence was quite notable. The taste was spicy, herbal, and oh so juicy. The lack of aging made the hops taste quite sweet and delicate. The pale malts were sweet and unobtrusively clean. There was a drawn out soft bitterness in the finish. The body was only slightly thicker than their Pale Ale and not quite as thick as Celebration. The mouthfeel was creamy and sticky. I enjoyed this a lot, but I am a hop head, and a beer showcasing hops is going to win me over in more cases than not."
"Pours hued burnt orange head dipates quickly. Smell is not what i expected not much there. Hints of Pine, citrus hops but not nearly as pudgent as i would expect. Taste is subtle but refreshly clean. Pretty tastey similar to the smell but much more upfront. I was expecting something more from this brew but all in all not bad. Highly drinkable very clean dry taste. not worth going on a search for though."
"not worth crawling through 1.5 miles of foul smelling stench but worth trying if you see it out and about."
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a nice and clingy tan head, excellent lacing. The aroma is a bit disappointing. Some nice grassy hop smell but not very strong. The taste is of a nice honey pale malt with a grassy semi-fresh hop flavor. The hops are not big and bold like their normal Harvest but still have a fresh taste to them. I would say that SNPA has a more noticable hop presence. The feel is moderate with nice carbonation. The finish is quite good, nicely balance, with a perfect subtle grassy hop bitterness. Though not as good as the other hop oriented offerings, this one has great balance and a nice, yet subtle, fresh hop flavor profile."
"d - this beer is easy to drink, a good buy when its around."
"Overall, this a great beer. Okay, maybe even better than great. So, why don't I even give it a even higher rating? Well, this brew tastes much like a cross between SN's ESB & their Celebration Ale, both of which I love. That said, this beer could maybe stand just a bit more ""everything"" for it to be a special harvest release. However, it's still an awesome brew, but at $4.25 / 24oz., I will buy it on a limited basis."
"This is a beer I could happily drink all night. Another winnner from Sierra Nevada."
"Full and round mouthfeel, very creamy. Decent drinkability, but not as hoppy as expected based on other Harvest Ale releases."
"Prosit!"
"M/D: Medium bodied, a bit over carbonated in my opinion. Good drinkability, easy to go down, no real bad features. Not as impressed as I am with the regular version, but still pretty good."
"Drinkability: A fine, tasty beer. The best thing to come oughta New Zealand since those hobbit movies."
"very good, a must try if you like SNPA, this is better"
"If you're familiar with SN's other offerings you could do a blind taste test and easily pick this out as one of their brews. It didn't have quite the piney presence as some of their other beers, yet it looked and had the same body and overall ""thumbprint"" that almost all of their other beers have. I'll enjoy this again if available, a very nice and drinkable beer."
"Worth the effort. Sierra has come up with something very good and very worth the effort. Peter Jackson approves."
"Cheers"
"Pours nice and clear, a beautiful shade of copper. Thick three finger head with a rocky look to it. Good lacing and retention. Smell is great, of fresh hops with a touch of caramel. Taste is about the same, it packs a nice hop punch to it but does have a semi-sweet malt background. Leaves a pleasant but bitter and oily aftertaste. Moderate carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Overall a good beer. The only thing I did not like about this beer was that it didnt differentiate itself much from other offerings from the company. Lets just say I could not pick this one out blindfolded from probably 3-4 other SN products."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with a moderate carbonation. Very smooth and creamy. More balanced as it warms. Drinkability depends on your tolerance for hop bite. I like it. A lot."
"I really enjoyed this beer, almost as much as Celebration Ale."
"This is a very nice American Pale Ale that I would like to share with friends if I could find it in a case. I'd also be interested in sampling it from the tap as I'm sure it would only improve the experience."
"Lovely idea, I think this one is a nice addition to the SN lineup. Pours amber with a nice orange tint to it. Nice head with quite a bit of lacing. Very light herbal smelling hops on the nose and bit of earthiness. Light malt profile, wich is perfectly fine with the delicate nature of the fresh hops. Taste is very nice. Quite a bit of herbal character from the fresh hops but perhaps not as much as there other harvest ale, and a nice piney and spicy finish. Gentle biscuity malt on the finish. The mouthfeel is relatively light, but not thin. Very drinkable a delightful spring surprise."
"Drinkability is good. This harvest ale to me falls more into the pale ale realm, while the fall harvest ale seems much more american IPA like. This is a nice unique easy drinking brew. Not a great beer, but a very good one that is well worth trying. I would have no problem drinking this one again. All in all... it's just a tasty beer that won't blow you away, or bog you down with huge bitterness or high ABV."
"Pours a beautiful orange/red color with average head with average lacing and average carbonation. The dominate smell is crisp fruity citrus hops and mild malts. First taste is light, sweet, and somewhat hoppy. Lighter tasting than I thought it would be based on the aroma. It could use a stronger malt backbone."
"Pours a nice clear amber color with a thick off white head that takes a long time to settle as a film on top of the beer. It laces the glass alot on the way down. The aroma is of some nice roasted malts and a ton of piney and citrisy hops. The taste is mainly of piney bitter hops. It is an excellent taste for a Pale Ale. The mouthfeel is really fresh and crisp. The drinkablilty is good for this beer. It is definately worth a try."
"Was excited to see this one at From the Vine the other day. Poured into my Sam Adams pint glass a golden color with plenty of rich white head on top of the glistening body. Retention was very high with plenty of lacing sticking around. Aroma was incredibly fresh in the beginning of May. Plenty of earthy hops that smelled like they were picked just today. Hints of citrus intertwine with the biscuity malt. Taste is grapefruit with other citrus. Pale malt sweetens up the drink with every sip. Finish is not very bitter but surprisingly sweet. Mouth feel was very light and smooth. I did not find any problem polishing off this 24 oz bottle."
"Southern Hemisphere is a unique twist to the Harvest Ale releases. I don't think it's quite as good as the Fall release, but it's not too far behind. It lacks the crisp bite and ultra-smooth mouthfeel of that version. But, this is a very good beer that's certainly a welcome addition to the spring lineup. Hopefully, they'll keep this on the roster. Recommended."
"Verdict: A very drinkable pale ale in the Harvest series. I feel that it's a bit too dry but other than that, I would recommend picking it up."
"Many different hop dimensions on this one...very intersting. Spicy, mineraly, with that classic Sierra citrus taste. Long lasting hop flavor...very enjoyably and drinkable."
"Pretty rich, but not as oily as some fresh hop beers, moderate-heavy mouthfeel with a good (avg - slt. above avg) dose of carbonation. Maybe not quite as good as the regular Harvest, but damn drinkable."
