Both the smell and the taste are pretty weak, especially for a name like Hopsecutioner and stating that the drinker will loss their hophead over it. I'm pretty disappointed in it.

Smells hoppy, initial taste is hops but malty takes over and lingers with a malty bite rather than a bitter finish. Almost in agreement with another review that called this a pale ale. Maybe my review would be different if I tasted blind and was told this was a pale ale. Worth a bottle but maybe no more unless you like a malt hop combo leaning toward the malt side.","hotpauko","Feb 19, 2015"

Piney and floral aromas coming through as well as the hint of some bitterness from the hops. Clear, ringing pine flavor up front, light bitterness, and the thought that a bit more bitterness would really help with the balance. Light mouthfeel, only slightly oily, but in my opinion pretty much spot on for what an IPA should 'feel' like. Just as expected, well crafted. This was quite good. Could hit the regular 'warm weather' rotation if this becomes a little easier to find in the area.","Mikus","Sep 29, 2014"

Its is a cloudy ale, thats appearance does not strike me one way or the other, but it has a strong and wonderful smell to it. The taste is above average, but i would not call it out stating, and the mouthfeel is pretty average. Overall i would say it is a beer worth picking up.","JaredMarvel","Jul 10, 2014"

Nose of resinous hops and tart grapefruit forward, with a tangy caramel backbone, and piney highlights. Great nose! Flavors are grapefruit and pineapple forward, with a tangy caramel and roasted backbone, peppery herbal notes, and piney resinous tones throughout. Smooth and balanced, on a light, smooth body. The aftertaste is tropical fruit, with a subtle bitter resin character. Smooth, resinous, slightly dry finish. Very tasty and very drinkable.","GarthDanielson","Jul 09, 2014"

Initial taste is grapefruit with a surprisingly mild hop burn on the backside. It certainly does not ""execute"" your taste buds. The mouthfeel and overall taste is thin compared to west coast IPA's like Pliny Elder or Lagunitas Maximus, which I believe it is trying to emulate. Overall, it is a good effort and if you like the style it's worth a try.","tomfneph","0"

The head is a nicely aesthetic cap, and retains wonderfully to the last drop, helping to keep up the air of an open invitation. The flavoring, although sweet, relatively clean, and heavily malted, does raise questions for something labeled “Hopsecutioner”. Unless they meant that they were killing the hops here, then maybe it would be appropriate. Joking aside, the grain does go overboard in both the aromatic and gustatory departments, marginalizing and underplaying the hops. For a DIPA, in comparison, that huge grain bill with the dog food wash and grit would be much more appropriate, and somewhat expected from an American producer. Although this beer seems to sell itself on reputation alone, they might be better pressed, if they ever find the need for rebranding, to call this one double/imperial in the future to justify the recipe. That said, this is not a bad beer, but also not something you want to coddle all night. Our biggest complaint is that it lacks a certain inherent freshness of hoppiness to it, which again, might be expectationally altered with a rebranding.","TheBrewo","Mar 20, 2014"

Very nice nose of citrus hops - grapefruit with a touch of lemon over a slight sweetness. Almost medium body with a mouthfeel that is almost slick. Low average carbonation level. The flavor profile is quite tasty and is hop flavor based, rather than bitterness oriented. It begins with citrus, mostly grapefruit, over a slight malt sweetness. It progresses to a nice low level burst of bitterness and grapefruit tartness. The finish is smooth over a bit of effervescence that is sweet, tart and has a lingering soft bitterness. Quite nice!","tillmac62","Feb 10, 2014"

The beer's smell is unusually malt forward with very little hops coming through. The malt's smell is caramel malt. The hops that do come out are an orange and floral smell but are covered by the heavy malt presence. The taste is very similar to the smell with a stronger caramel malt presence than the hops. After the beer warmed up a little bit, the hops emerge but barely. The hop taste becomes a grapefruit taste but is still dominated by the malts. The hops are not as strong as one would expect from an IPA. The beer is medium bodied but on the heavier side because of the malts. Also, very little carbonation. The IPA is okay but it is very unusual in that the malts have a much heavier presence than the hops. I probably won't pick this one up again because of the lack of hop flavor. Given the name, I expected more hops.","HattedClassic","Nov 27, 2013"

It's very much a West Coast style, but not aggressive. Great fruity-hoppy-malty composite. Very professional work from Terrapin!","Cobrito","Dec 28, 2012"

Flavor follows with a nice light citrus peel, sweet pale malts, a hint of pine and bitter on the way down. Smooth and crisp finish makes this extremely drinkable. Light bodied, with medium high carbonation. Solid brew.","BMMillsy","Aug 16, 2012"

3.11,-18.8,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Found at World of Beers in Altamonte Springs, FL this IPA has a yellow amber color, clear and fairly quiet, with a very solid white head that sticks and leaves a hearty skin behind. The aroma has very light citrus, lemon wheat, not much else. Okay. The flavor follows with a bit stronger citrus hop and a bright malt biscuit backbone. I taste what seems like alcohol, which at 7.2 percent, it probably is. This edge seems to mask the hop qualities in my opinion and steels the IPA value I was looking for. Really makes it ordinary to me. This is medium-light bodied with a busy, small bubble carbonation that delivers a crisp feel. It ultimately turns entirely harsh and grassy to me and is more regrettable than memorable, but it’s not awful. Disappointing though. I don't think I had any problems with it in a bottle, but this one on tap has some issues.","Durge","May 15, 2012"

Taste is sweet up front with bready toffee malts that quickly fade to citrus and pine. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a resinous and sweet mouthfeel.

I like this beer a lot and would not turn it down, but somehow it was a little bit ""less"" than what I expected. To me, it seems very balanced (more of a pale ale), and not what I would consider a ""hophead"" beer. But, hey...pale ale's are my favorite style, so that's okay with me.

The hops give a little bit of a floral note which compliments the malty hint nicely. Tastes of hops, light malts, and a finish of hops. Carbonation seems right, smooth finish with a little hop bite.

The aroma offers pine resin, alcohol, and a hint of citrus. The flavor brings a robust malt bill, as well as some piny hops, with subtle hints of citrus. Alcohol is a bit too present in both the aroma and flavor for my liking. Still, an enjoyable brew. The body is thicker than is customary for the style. A light bitterness lingers on the tongue between sips. Overall, decent.","Huhzubendah","Feb 05, 2012"

Aroma is less forgiving, with mainly wheat bread notes and a whisper of orangey hops. Flavor is just about the same. With a name like Hopsecutioner, you’ve got to bring the hops. This falls short in hop aroma, flavor and bitterness. The one thing this beer has going for it is a pillowy mouthfeel. Really soft and smooth going down.","illidurit","Jan 31, 2012"

3.42,-10.7,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Hopsecutioner has a very light taste to it - hard to believe it's 7.3% ABV. It has a nice balance of citrus-y hops (nothing too distinct) with the malt-y backbone, although I would have preferred the ratio weighted more towards the former. The finish is sweet and dry, with plenty of malts that hit the back of the tongue. It doesn't pack much punch in the finish though - it doesn't have much substance to ""chew on"" for a beer that touts the hops. Another reviewer mentioned it has a ""tea-like"" taste to it, and I think that's right on. It is very drinkable for a stronger IPA, though. This would be a good summer IPA, although I can't help but thinking that ""Hopsecutioner"" doesn't quite live up to their name. I'd like to check out more from Terrapin.","brewsclues","Nov 14, 2011"

Fruity scents are nice but weak, giving the impression that this will be a pretty hoppy beer. It really isn't, for an IPA - malts are front and center; bready and nutty. There is a sweetness to it that is quite unique. A twinge of bitterness and citrus comes through in the finish. While the taste is good and balanced, I expect more of hops punch to rate it among the better IPAs.","DeltaGolfSierra","Nov 05, 2011"

Taste is citrus, light pine, oranges, and caramel. Slightly bitter but the malt balances it out masterfully. One of the most balanced IPAs that have passed through these lips. Very easy drinking and one that would be perfect for someone new to the style. Not a particularly complex or original IPA, but a delicious one. Good representation of an East Coast IPA.","hmf05","Oct 16, 2011"
4.15,8.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"I've had this beer many times now, and when fresh it's a very nice beer. I was particularly pleased with this version in a cask served at the Brick Store Pub. Pours a slightly hazy orange with a generous head. The aromas are a very nice combination of sweet malt, citrusy hops, earthiness, and some drying woodiness from the cask. The taste is similar, with a light citrus and paraffin profile to start and then some sweet malt and woodiness. A little thinner than I'd like for it to really shine- particularly with the oak notes, but overall it's very nice.","Georgiabeer","Oct 14, 2011"

Initial blast to the palette of hop bitterness. first sip don't get much other than the bitter and it lingers throughout the brew. the palette goes numb and the rest of the drinking experience makes way to sweeter malt flavors. slight hints of roasted barley...smokey flavors peek up, almost like a mild tobacco flavor in the tail end. This beer, though, is no joke when it comes to bitterness. Huge hop presence lingers 100% of the time during this. More of an east coast style of IPA, getting little any fruit bitterness here, but overall very well balanced after the intial sip. Mouthfeel is medium with a huge stickiness factor.

Even without the branding disappointment, there's not a ton of complex or overly great flavor notes out of this one.

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear, medium, orange-amber hue. A small head of ivory froth leaves sticky, thin webbing on the glass. The aroma explodes with dank hoppiness, showing loads of sticky pine resin, cannabis, dried grass, and juicy orange. Once the initial hop wave subsides, underlying notes of soft toffee and grain emerge. After the hop bomb nose, however, flavors just don’t measure up. There’s a strong and overwhelming graininess, almost like a stale cereal element, that tends to cloud or dull the resinous, grassy hop bite. It’s still quite bitter and hoppy, but that toasted grain just seems to get in the way. It’s almost like they were shooting for a west coast style and just got the malt bill wrong. Still pretty decent though. The palate is medium bodied and moderately carbonated, perhaps getting a little thin at the end. Grassy hop burps are sure to ensue.","ChrisSimpson1968","Sep 01, 2011"

4,4.4,4,4,4,4,4," Palate is hop-forward, with notes of grapefruit and a hint of grass. Pale malt emerges on the swallow, bringing a sweetness that helps balance the bitterness of the hops.

2.06,-46.2,3,2,2,2,2,"Tap: Sad to say, but an old bottle was not to blame before. This is simply a bland IPA. I'm curious about the reasoning of building such a mild beer at such a sizeable ABV. Exceedingly tame aroma with gentle notions of pine, citric and tealike hops. Taste is similarly frustrating; this stuff is lacking in any defining characteristics. Primary aroma and flavor seems to be alcohol. Terrapin is very much hit and miss for me, and I'm afraid this has to go in the 'miss' category. Not so much horrible as horribly boring.","PDXHops","Aug 19, 2011"

Tangerine, mango and lychee are suggested with some very piney bitterness; the taste is more of the same but perhaps lesser in intensity.

Nose is bitter orange and grapefruit hops with some bread malt and a hint of soy sauce. The flavors of this beer are very well balanced. The hops offer much more fruitiness than the nose would have suggested with more fresh citrus and even some tropical fruits coming through on the palate along with a very nice caramel and bread maltiness.

Had to check the ABV on this one when I felt some warmth. Alcohol taste is far from boozey and really adds to this one. Linger sticks around for a while.

Pours a delightful amber shade not typical for an IPA, with a 1/2"" bone white head. Smells of cascades without a doubt, floral and aromatic. For some reason this beer has a different level of hoppiness in the taste every time I try it. Tastes somewhat sweet this time around, with pale, light crystal, and a slight touch of biscuit malts making themselves known. On the swallow the aromatic cascades really march through causing quite a pleasant aftertaste. Bitterness is medium, and makes me wonder if they're substituting hops for this brew on a regular basis. I suspect galena or columbus are providing the IBU's for this brew but hey, I could be wrong. Standard IPA here this time around, maybe I'll grab one of the old bottles in the Jail Cell and see whats goin on with it.

Once some opportunity to acclimate to this beer is had, it becomes very pleasant and interesting--just unorthodox by typical IPA standards. The candy sweetness is a highlight if one is in the mood for a sweet IPA, reminding of Alpine's Pure Hoppiness. Carbonation was perhaps the biggest issue outside of the unexpected flavor profile, with the lack of it causing the beer to dwell on the palate more heavily than it should.

Upon the first sip the sweetness of the nice roasted malt hits you up front and then the green apple, citrus, pine hop flavors come into play leaving a long nice bitter dry finish. I love the potent resin like effect some IPA's give. This reminds me of a West Coast IPA actually. You can tell they put some different strains of hops in here too not just one dimensional at all. It also reminds me of the Samuel Adams Latitude 48 which you can take as a good or bad thing but to me I like that beer very much so its a good thing. Very well crafted beer. This is my first Terrapin and now I would like to try all of their product line... that tells you something right there. The thing that sets this apart from the regular East Coast IPA's like Latitude is that it has that potent resin like finish as I said before with a nice hop bite... plus the alcohol is very well masked at 7.3 so this beer will give you a buzz.

Just a touch of hoppy bitterness with each sip, body is fairly hefty on this one, no sign of alcohol that I could notice, even with the 7% + abv. A darn good IPA from the folks at Terrapin, drinkability is up there for sure.","jsdunlop","Beers"

An attractive beer in any case, good lacing as well. The smell is somewhat subdued, some fruity hops, not just confined to citrus fruitiness either. It hits the tongue with a nice varied hop fruitiness (grapefruit, maybe some lemon & apple), followed by some very subdued malt sweetness. Nothing lingers on the finish. It's very refreshing and dangerously drinkable, but a little underwhelming overall. It's pleasant, but not overly interesting or complex. Great entry-level or session IPA.","TJBAIHWL","Jan 15, 2011"

Other than the 7.3 ABV, this would be a very sessionable beer. It's super-easy drinking and, dare I say, better than Commodore Perry.

Lacing and retention are both average, I really would have liked to have seen this beer stand out a little more in some way in the looks department. Nose is solid (if not a little weak), a little bit of maltiness and a pine dominated hop aroma (though I can also find a little bit of citrus in there). The malt level on this beer is very nice, a dollop of caramel up front leaves Hopsecutioner not quite as bone dry as a west coast, hop showcase IPA, but also not as sweet as say 60 Minute IPA and its east coast brethren. Unfortunately the hop aspect of this beer falls a bit short. There's a solid bitterness bite to the beer, but I think some more late/post boil hop additions are in order as I had a hard time really locking on to the pine and citrus flavors I was expecting based on the aroma. The nice malt backbone yields a similarly nice body to the beer, and the carbonation level is also spot on, above average but not overbearingly high. Despite the lack of hop flavor, the appreciable malt influence as well as a smooth bitterness made this extremely drinkable, definitely disappeared from my glass faster than I had anticipated. Hopsecutioner has the makings of a great IPA, walking the line between the east and west coast styles, but the lackluster hop flavor is just holding it back.","axeman9182","Aug 10, 2010"
5,30.5,5,5,5,5,5,"A very nice IPA. I must say before this Terrapin my favorite IPA was from sweetwater but I like this one much better. It has a dark amber color with a lace that sticks to the glass. The smell very nice kind of a sweet smell but with a huge hops finish. The taste is great with a citrus hint on the hops but leads to a smooth mouthfeel which leads to a wonderful drinkability. I really enjoy this IPA.","kdawg105","Aug 09, 2010"

The taste was very bitter dry at first, with a very good malty midpalate, and a semi-dry malty orange peel finish. Overall, not very complex, but very balanced. Not much carbonation visually, but there is a sneaky hint of carbo in the feel that makes the medium body a little more pleasant. Tasty and very sessionable, but my only knock was that the presence of sweetness in the finish got a little much by my third pint.","donniecuffs","Jul 30, 2010"

Citrus notes, slight hop resin, faint orange rind towards the finish and light, alcohol-soaked fruit towards the end as well. Thick in body with light carb. Full of flavor but surprisingly unintimidating. I was expecting much more of the alcohol to come through but it hides well behind the big flavor. Another round of applause for Terrapin.

The bitter hop flavors are noticable, but they mix with the fruity hops flavors well so neither one overpowers the other. There's also a nice lingering bitter finish.

It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall, this brew is hard to beat for the price and it's availability (around here that is).

In the mouth it's medium-bodied, average carbonation and weight, pine and white grapefruit, orange citrus sweetens things some but the malts remain shadowy at best. A pinch of white pepper apparent. Meager apricot, peach, apple fruit. The grassiness and hoppy bite by far the strongest element, does stop short of reaching mouth puckering proportions.

Good smell of strong and piney resinous hops and a solid caramel malt backbone. Taste features both strong hops and malt but with a lack of good balance. There seems no method to the madness here. They are muddled together with neither shining or proving where they stand as a part of the beer itself. Hops win with an ever present bitterness but they are combined with an incessant sweetness that persists relentlessly at times. Finishes bitter and drying, though with a slight lack of carbonation, it seems a tad watery and nearly syrupy due to the competition with the malts all the same. Doesn't tickle my tongue or urge me to take the next sip. I'm normally a fan of almost anything Terrapin puts out there...this one is a bit of a miss.","ncvbc","Mar 08, 2010"
3.87,1,3.5,4,4,3,4,"The beer is perfectly clear, a deep orange color, with a very nice head. It is a little thin, but it kind of sticks around. Decent looking. The smell is nice - mango, mint, tangerine, and pineapple come to mind. Resinous and floral, citric and fruity. I kind of like this hop profile. And you can smell a bit of sugar in there too, from the malt. Decent smelling. The flavor can best be characterized by it's balance. Which basically means, that it won't impress you, but it won't leave you bored and wanting something else. The hop profile comes in with a flavor of underripe mango - which provides a distinct bitterness and resinous taste - with some citrusy orange flavors. The malt is bready and a bit nutty, and just a little bit more sweet than I would like - I think that's kind of hurting the floral hoppiness in terms of flavor. But overall, I would say it's got a good balance between dryness and sweetness, and it's fruity enough, resinous enough to be a beer I like - and it is very clean in terms of yeast profile - the slight nuttiness, and low esters - which I really like, though I suppose it's not as complex for it. The body is a little thin, with a bit of carbonation, not bad, about average I would say in the mouthfeel. The drinkability is probably the best aspect of this, the balance really makes this something I could drink a few of, but probably not too many at 7.2%, but I wouldn't be embarrassed to ask for it again. I think it's solid, but something seems to be holding me back from loving it.","taylorhamrick","Mar 08, 2010"

It's more of a balanced aroma. The taste is great! It's a smooth, well balanced IPA. The malt bill is really well done. It has a nice pale and Carapils malt flavor with a touch of crystal malts for some added complexity. The hops taste amazing. Again, they are well pronounced and quite bitter, but within range and not overly done. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a well brewed IPA.

Aroma has a great citrus peel bouquet with floral highlights with a slight tart sourdough bread malt character. Greeen with hops not as lively as the tap version I tasted at Fathead's but it was a bit fresher. I'm sure this one is coming around in their sampler packs but the label may just be the highlight. A hooded Terrapin pulling the rope on a guillotine with a hop plant poking through the gallows. Classic Georgia based hop imagery. Ample sweetness with vinous fresh hops citrus, herbs, and pine elements play nicely but the citrus/grapefruit tropical fruits really stand out what an amazing session IPA I'm glad to be lucky enough to live in driving distance to the Terrapin lineup great beers for sure. They need a cap that will represent them better than the plain shiny golden version. Mouthfeel is slick with hop oils a nice all around hop monster that doesn't overbear the palate in anyway.

4.03,5.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A fair amount of malts transition into a bright, delightful hop profile and punchy (without being overbearing or unnecessary) bitterness -- it's a good IPA. Terrapin can check off the India Pale Ale box on the ""to brew"" list.","ChainGangGuy","Dec 08, 2009"

3,-21.7,3,3,3,3,3,"I had this on tap at Taco Mac Metropolis. The beer is clear and copper colored with an off-white wet-looking thin head (less than 1/2 finger). The beer smells hoppy, more in a bitter way than in a citrus or floral way. Same with the taste, bitter and a little spicy, not really all that pleasant an after-taste. Overall, this feels like a generic brewpub version an IPA, not bad but nothing special. When will I stop expecting more from Terrapin?","TurdFurgison","0"
