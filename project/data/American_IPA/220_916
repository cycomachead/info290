I usually look for a well-timed release of a variety of flavors each as strong as the last, but this one is sort of monotonic. Not bad, but just not excellent.","hopphead31415","Feb 23, 2015"

If you're after a good, solid IPA then this would make a good go-to brew - perhaps not as 'homicidally hoppy' as the bottle blurb would have you believe, but definitely worth it for the sheer variety of the flavour palate.

It's got citrus and hops upfront, but they're light and don't have enough strength or depth to hold the flavor throughout the entire development. This gives you a beer that only has good flavor has soon as you swallow but immediately fades into a basic beer taste like Corona or the like. Not nasty, but not good.

Lagunitas brew is always both easier to get ahold of, cheaper, and just as good if not better. This beer tastes nearly the same as gumballhead, however slightly more grapefruit than citrus. Smooth, all day drinking kind of beer or session. I can't think of any occasion or season this wouldn't be good. Awesome citrus/grapefruit taste, kind of a bready orange peel nose. Taste doesn't linger or coat the mouth, something that I look for in all beers, and leaves you wanting more after each taste. I thought I liked lil sumpin', but this is smoother and you don't get that alcohol Taste at the end like lil sumpin'. 10/10 in my book.","UriaHeep","Nov 26, 2014"

Pine, citrus and caramel malt compete for your attention. Good body. Moreish and highly drinkable; I'm glad I've got more stashed away. A must-try beer.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 15, 2014"

Sierra Nevada Pale is widely available and is one of the best pale ales out there.  This is a top 10 IPA.  This is my first IPA and I think one of the  mount rushmore IPA's that opened the floodgates for this category.  What I like best about it is that it is smooth compared to the one sided dominant hop profiles that seem to dominate the landscape to the detriment of the beer.  Yes, I love hops but all hops and no balance does not a beer make.  Lagunitas is delicious and is one of those rare beers that actually taste better from the bottle than on tap.  It is a top 10 IPA.  Nuff said.","Smr7626","Nov 06, 2014"

The taste was an initial big  pop from the hops which then mellowed into a very drinkable finish that I thought was quite delicious. The mouthfeel was also very pleasant. Not too thick for an IPA but with a consistent body. I liked this one a lot.","WhiteHillsStore","Oct 12, 2014"

It's not too exciting, and I probably wouldn't have it again for myself, but might bring a sixer to a party for my friends to try out. Many will also enjoy the 6.2% abv, but you can get Torpedo, which is arguably better and higher in abv, for a dollar cheaper.","enjambed","Oct 11, 2014"

Its listed as June 2014 on the bottome of the bottle, so its already 3-4 months old which is more than I usually will tolerate for IPA purchases.  With that said there is still plenty of hop notes in the smell, nice mix of piney/citrus combo going on.  Taste is very solid and standard classic American IPA.  It's not SUCKS citrus hop slam, but more piney and malt presence.  Mnimal bitter finish.    Overall I find this very solid and respectable.  Would purchase again.","bubseymour","0"

APPEARANCE: orange amber body; diminishing, bubbly white head that leas beautifully arching lacing; strong cirrus swaths... AROMA: robust peach and pine cone--orange, melon, pineapple--grainy, demanding malts make this an intense, cagey meeting... PALATE: full-bodied, warming and thick--aggressive on the teeth and tongue; dry enough to slow sips; versatile ... TASTE: evenly balanced; with an intense hop bomb accompanying every sip; the intense pine comb produces ripples of orange, tangerine and mango and repercussions of the most palatably bitter ale ... OVERALL: in a three-way battle with Prism and Heavy Seas for roommate get-together IPA supremacy, Lagunitas asserts a dominant character--an irrepressible combination of drinkability and enjoyability...no doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had...","dacrza1","Aug 29, 2014"

3.94,1.3,4,3.75,4,4,4,"I’ve had this many times before, but, having just joined the site, I decided to write a review this time. The beer is dated 6/3/14 (about two months old). It pours a straw yellow that borders on copper under certain lighting. The aroma is pleasant with a subtle citrus characteristic, but predominantly earthy resinous hops. The taste has more citrus than the nose would suggest and is full of orange and lemon zest. The beer finishes with a sturdy, resinous hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue for awhile. It is medium bodied with a modest amount of carbonation, which suits the style well. Overall, a solid beer. At a reasonable price, it is a nice go-to beer.","thomda11","Jul 27, 2014"

A medium-light mouthfeel, with a hint of alcohol on the finish. For hop fans like me, the biting tang left by the hop taste is refreshing.","Jerrod-Scott","Jul 19, 2014"

I like a hearty malt presence, as long as it isn't too too thick, or has a bad taste. This beer, if I'm not mistaken, skips the malt, and just lets the hops come through - all without being too bitter.","jaketodd","Jun 23, 2014"

Smells of ripe grapefruit and dried apricots. Taste is much the same. Apricots and dried citrus. Grapefruit. Mostly hop forward with little malt influence.

It gives a lot of head when serving from the tap however the appearance is remarkable. The golden orange brew smells great and goes down like water. The taste is of course far from water- a nice, hoppy, semi bitter IPA. Mouthfeel is almost 10 out of 10. I would recommend this to a friend any day.","Gabriel_Vaughn","Apr 17, 2014"

3.93,1,3.75,3.75,4,4,4,"This ale pours a crystal clear golden amber color with a thick white head that slowly gives way to a nice film and lacing. The aroma is more subtle than most west coast ipas. It consists of a generous amount of citrus hops with a slight malt backbone and some pine and grass notes. This offering sips very clean, light and smooth with just enough mouth coating resin to make it very delicious. The flavor is much more forward than the aroma lets on with a substantial amount of citrus and pine resolving to a nice malty sweetness and finishing with a lasting hoppy bitterness. This is a very well crafted ipa and can stand up with Stone and Green Flash as some of the best widely available west coast ipas.","lochef81","0"

Understated malts add a semblance of balance in the end, but for the most part this is pure, unadulterated hoppy goodness that's easy-drinking and refreshing.

3.42,-12.1,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Anyhoo... poured a light golden color but with an unexpected orange hue. The head faded quickly and left little lacing. Fragrance was quite hoppy but less than would be expected from an IPA, yet replacing that was almost a honeyed or floral scent. Accordingly, this beer tastes like an IPA, but with less hoppiness and in its place more of a honeyed or even floral character. The mouthfeel was light, at least as light (if not more so) than I expect from an IPA, despite the additional sweetness (which in my experience usually leaves a beer feeling more viscous or even "oily"). Frankly, I quite liked it. If it were marketed as something other than an IPA, even given some creative name like the folks at Magic Hat give their beers and then by way of explanation "American Bitter Ale" or some such under it, I would probably have liked this beer even more. So as a beer unto itself, it is a good one, for sure. For an IPA proper, so-so. It's almost as if these guys were intimidated by the IPAs coming out of Stone Brewery and decided not to even try to make a hoppy beer. Or didn't want their beer considered too arrogant. I don't know. Try one for yourself. Either way, it's a good beer worth at least one try!","ItalianPisces84","Jan 20, 2014"

Light medium body with above average carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. The flavor profile is quite nice and well balanced. Toast malt, malt sweetness, citrus (mostly) hop flavor and a mild bitterness combine to produce a quite flavorful, but not over powering ale. The finish is crisp with a effervescent burst of sweet and tart flavor. A nice grapefruit flavor lingers. This IPA focuses on flavor, rather than bitterness and is outstanding.","tillmac62","Jan 08, 2014"

Tonight, trying it fresh out of the gate, I really like it. Ample one-finger head, white in color, lots of tiny bubbles, and very good lacing all the way through the experience. The nose is piney, piney, piney, with hints of orange and lemon zest. On the palate, the obvious hops are prominent, as is a certain orange/grapefruit dank. Good mouthfeel. The malt takes a back seat, but that's OK -- makes for a more lean, crisp finish. On balance, I really like this IPA and now appreciate the hub-bub I missed first time around. Would do this again.","JohnParadee","Dec 28, 2013"

Lately this beer is showing up across the province and tonight I finally had the bomber in my fridge, still pretty fresh after a few weeks. Color is darkish yellow falling just shy of orange, with a decent amount of whitish foam. Lagunitas has such a classic and unique character, allegedly due to inordinately warm fermentation temperatures, and this beer certainly captures that aspect in spades. Aroma is sweet grapefruit, lime, and tangerine citrus, very fruity and sweet with little discernible malt. You can taste the malt more clearly than you can smell it, although even here you have to concentrate. This is a hops delivery vehicle but said flavors are not uber-bitter and overpowering at all. The total package is fairly light, sweet, and fruity. Head was fairly impressive but carbonation on the low end, with a thinnish body and a subtle sweet malt background, maybe a hint of molasses and biscuit. Dangerously drinkable. Flavor starts with tons of mellow citrus pith, fresh orange juice and subdued but clearly detectable pine. There is then a bloom of pineapple and mango tropical fruit flavors along with fresh leafy green chlorophyll and some tree sap and resin in the wet finish. More of a showcase for hop flavors rather than the expected bitterness and it works on this level. Light, unassuming IPA but features some fresh flavors and a nice "starter" IPA for drinking in quantity.","CalgaryFMC","0"

Good hit of bitterness mid palate, turning to sweetness at the back of the mouth. Not a whole lot of malt is present, you get some hints of it but this one is mostly about the hops. Light to medium mouthfeel with a wet finish. It would be easy to pass this one by, but I always seem to come back to lagunitas. You get your money's worth here, I picked it up for 8.99 a six.

Brass crystal clear body. Highly carbonated and very active. Bitter hops bite with just a hint of malt and oats. Flowery full bitter flavor. Not overpowering like many West Coast USA IPAs. More full flavored and rich. Good ale note mid-palate as the hops nose depletes. Brassy and a bit of skunk cabbage. A little pepper and coriander. Degrades to lemon grass and a crisp hops note. A lingering flower note in the aftertaste. Dry. Smooth. Well balanced. On the verge of IPA perfection. Very good. Highly recommended. Best example of the West Coast IPA breed while remaining fully accessible to the masses. Simply a great beer. 4.0 out of 5.","digitalflood","Oct 06, 2013"

Funny though, I can smell biscotti and cookies, but just don't really appreciate those in the flavor.  Mouthfeel is fine - though the bitterness lingers.  Overall it's solidly built, but kinda not too polished.  It has stiff competition from the multitude of great IPAs available - try Harpoon!","TAMU99","Sep 10, 2013"

Taste, right upfront there is a malt sweetness, not what I expected. This fades into a lingering resin-like bitterness in the finish. I'll be honest there's not much to the flavor in my opinion. Medium body and medium carbonation. For my taste there is a noticeable lack of hop flavor. Overall a decent beer, however slightly disappointing.","scvance","Aug 22, 2013"

It has a nice color to it, amber/orange, which produced a nice light foamy head. The beer had a nice hoppy aroma and the taste was the same, but it is just a straight forward IPA. No complexity to it, just simply straight forward. The beer was really easy to drink, which might have been the best quality of the beer, and it left a nice dry aftertaste.

4.46,14.7,4,4.25,4.75,4,4.5,"Lagunitas beers face tons of competition here in Northern California. In the general vicinity are Moylan's, Marin, Bear Republic, Anderson Valley, and North Coast Brewing Companies. In my opinion Lagunitas makes a decent product but is just a notch below all of the above, still I do like to support them. This IPA poured a clear light copper and had a nice thick beige head. Lacing was smattered at the top of the glass, sheeted at the bottom half. Smell was on the restrained side however the the taste was full throttled. A blast of bitter citrusy hops greets the palate, mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. O.K. drinkability that actually grew on me as I emptied the glass. I would say it needs a bit more malt balance. Worth a try. I feel this beer has improved dramatically since my first introduction to it. It is now my go to IPA and one of the most drinkable by far. A perfect tasting IPA that invites you tto have one after the other. One of my three favorite domestic craft beers.","Mark","Aug 02, 2013"

Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, pine, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of citrus hop notes with a light-moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, pine, grass, light caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, floral, pine, grass, bread, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a light-moderate malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent IPA. All around great balance and complexity of hop flavors with light-moderate malt; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

More drinkable and sessionable than Torpedo, but 1) the lower ABV is deceptive, as it is closer than it may seem, 2) more malty and less floral, 3) SN 12s are 25% cheaper than Lagunitas IPA right now, with no promise of leveling out. I prefer this one for regular drinking ("thirst quenching") but no so much that I would spend more for it (and limiting to one Torpedo is cheaper in the long run ;-) ).","VictorWisc","Jul 16, 2013"

The taste has a nice floral bite, but is well balanced and the sweeter malty flavors are present. A bit too watery, and doesn't have the nice dry or hoppy aftertaste like other IPAS.

Clear golden color, nice lacing, sharp hop presence, with a bit less malt than expected. Malt is there in the nose a bit. Feel is ok, but a teeny bit thin for both the style and brewer.

The aroma is hoppy and intoxicating, especially from your empty glass - it will leave you wanting another! This beer is best enjoyed on tap and cold. As I've stated earlier it can be an acquired taste for some. But just like a good bourbon or scotch, once that taste locks in you will want more and more and more. If in doubt, drink about a dozen pints and then lets talk.","KJA","Jun 22, 2013"

Clear and golden with lots of carbonation and a medium-thick white head that fades quickly to a thick rim of suds that leaves lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of sweet citrus fruit with a bit of more standard hop smell in the background, over a hint of light crackery malt. Taste is smooth and clean, with lots of juicy hop flavor and a delicious wet malt/hop bitterness finish that almost forces you to take another sip. Flavor seems to be muted, but it's a great IPA.

Flavor is light citrus and tropical fruit, citrus and piney hops, sweet bready malt with an intriguing very light spicyness. Light to medium bodied. Flavors are not assertive, but well balanced. I would like a bit more hop assertiveness, but perhaps I did not get an absolutely fresh bottle (dating please…). A pleasant, low key American IPA.","LiquidAmber","Apr 06, 2013"

The bitterness rests at just the right level. It's enough to keep it approachable but still challenge a green palate and introduce it to what a real beer can be. Excellent quality for the price too. Lagunitas built itself on this beer, and it's a rock-solid foundation.","ryan1788a5","Beers"

Your typical west coast IPA, just not as bold. The taste was most of the same. It started out pretty well but sadly the taste dies too quickly. The balance between bitterness and flavor was definitely on the more bitter side, and I wouldn't even consider this a very bitter beer. It reminded me of a bitter, piney version of Corona, which isn't a particularly good thing. I think I'll just stick to Stone and Green Flash.","MisSigsFan","Mar 12, 2013"

Big "IPA" in the center of the label that looks to be painted through a stencil, set on a tea-stained label with some red text that gives it flare and danger. Makes me think of palm fronds, machetes, machine guns, and cocaine production. Poured into a glass, it has a nice, almost-white head over an amber body. Fresh pine and tropical fruit on the nose. It smells clean and simple. Hops and fruit on the palate, grass, simple and not big, and a clean finish. Nice carbonation. It's not a huge beer, but it's nice and clean for the style, with really no bitter aftertaste, and the 6.2 ABV is nothing to balk at. I could see getting another sixer of this and doing some BBQ-ing.

Quite a bit different than the hop bomb i was expecting. very smoothe, good mouthfeel, and after drinking two apparently there is some alcohol in there too!

Perfumey floral nose with hints of mango, orange peel, pine, lemon, and that odd, almost squashy smell I almost always seem to detect with Lagunitas beers. The taste is citrus dominated with hints of tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit along with pine, mango, caramel, and unfortunately, that squashy-pumpkin character again. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation and good balance between the sweet malt and bitter hops. The finish is crisp, tangy and dry. Overall this is a solid IPA, but I just can't get past that squash thing.","beerdrifter","Jan 27, 2013"

But taste is sweet malts, and fruit, mostly citrus and light pine that begins (the bitterness) mid to late and has a very pleasing sustain.

Golden orange color, a bit hazy, with a decent white head, fair retention and lacing. Grapefruit and piney hop aromas with a touch of sweetness, pretty familiar in the nose. Taste follows suit, somewhat more subdued hop character than I’d like, again, lots of grapefruit and pine, pineapple and orange, some malt sweetness underneath. Bitter but not overwhelmingly so. Smooth, medium bodied with medium carbonation, decently dry finish, just a little bitterness hanging around after. Good but not exceptional.","WoodBrew","Aug 11, 2012"

More resinous, floral hops, lots of grapefruit and pine with a mild caramel and baked cracker malt profile. Mouthfeel is crisp and drinkable, with a medium body and solid carbonation. Overall a superb "everyday" IPA, and it's affordable to boot.","jsanford","Jul 10, 2012"

The aroma is a solid citrus and pine hop. The taste is good, it's that kind of transparent "hop juice" style IPA that I can down like water. The malts step completely to the side, letting the hops take the wheel. The hops aren't an aggressive driver, they drive 55 on the freeway. It's a great drive for everyone. The mouthfeel is mellow and slightly drying, and the drinkability is very good. Overall, it's a great, drinkable IPA. It won't punch you in the face, but that's what Hop Stoopid is for.","shand","Mar 26, 2012"

Golden orange color, a bit hazy, with a decent white head, fair retention and lacing. Grapefruit and piney hop aromas with a touch of sweetness, pretty familiar in the nose. Taste follows suit, somewhat more subdued hop character than I’d like, again, lots of grapefruit and pine, pineapple and orange, some malt sweetness underneath. Bitter but not overwhelmingly so. Smooth, medium bodied with medium carbonation, decently dry finish, just a little bitterness hanging around after. Good but not exceptional.","tobelerone","Mar 08, 2012"

The smell of the beer was hoppy which is a good thing for the style. The taste of the beer was pretty solid, good bitter hops flowing nicely through this brew. The mouthfeel was pretty good, well carbonated and drinkable. Overall I think this is a pretty solid brew. I would drink it again.","Knapp85","Jan 03, 2012"

4.67,20.1,4.5,5,4.5,5,4.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a hazy gold/orange color. Very nice thick, off white head, very good retention and high marks for lacing. Aroma of this American IPA is wonderful highest marks. The nose is full of pine and citrus. The Hops are the star of the show with this brew. There is some slight grainy undertones that are able to sneak through the Hop Overload. The taste of the AIPA is as the nose suggests, lots of pine, citrus- Hops dominate the flavor. There is a malted grain backbone that gives way to a bitter, creamy smooth finish. This IPA is like drinking Silk. So So Smooth. You have heard of love making music? This is a love making beer- I will have this at the ready bedside the next time I take the wife to pleasure town. Very well balanced- Absolute treat for hop heads.","GossageBrewery","Nov 01, 2011"

A solid good beer.","damndirtyape","Sep 24, 2011"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"This pours hazy orange with light, fluffy head and active bubbles. There is only a little bit of lacing, but the retention is good. The nose is fresh and smells a lot like orange citrus with a little bit of graininess. There is enough of a crisp, bitter bite in the flavor…but a surprising amount of cereal malt in the aftertaste to balance it out. I like that the malt is presence, but not in a sweet syrupy way. This beer is very “approachable”. It’s easy to have a couple, and I feel like even a not-so-adventurous beer drinker could enjoy one. This is like a pumped up Sierra Nevada’s Pale Ale, very west coast in style and appearance.","beerdown77","Sep 23, 2011"
3.75,-3.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured into my 13 oz tulip. A light orange yellow with a 2 inch fluffy white head. Smell is grapefruit, lemon, some grass, and pine.

As always, a very good price.","SawDog505","Sep 20, 2011"

It's drinkable, and for many people, it would be a decent beer to have.

A little heavy in body for an IPA my opinion, but it is a 6.2% beer, so we expect a little bit of thickness. Looks pretty good in the glass, empties back out decently well. Definitely not a bad example of the style, but not really something Id hop around with my five dollar bill trying to get the bartenders attention for.","corylew","Sep 15, 2011"
3.58,-8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"have had a few of these over the years so i reckon i might as well write one up. drinking a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. coppery-orange color with a decent inch of head that hasn't totally subsided halfway through the glass. i smell a much earthier hop coming off this ipa; damp pine needles maybe, and something a little sweet and tangy though not quite citrus. the taste reinforces the earth qualities and molasses with respectable bitterness. creamier mouthfeel that doesn't dry out until the end. i personally prefer the aggressive west coast citrus style, so this one ranks lower on my list.","dannydetox","Sep 14, 2011"

Hoppy notes and some grapefruit/citrus. Smell is light a fresh. Taste is slightly hoppy and piney, but not very strong. Bitterness apparent in the aftertaste but the flavors die out real fast.

This beer doesnt attack the back of your tongue and stay there like some IPAs. Floats softly across your palate. Taste is hoppy at first but then it is subdued by a sweet malt. great combination of the two. Doesnt leave a strong aftertaste.

The smell falls a bit short in comparison to other lagunita brews and lacks the signature scent that most of their hoppy beers have in fact its a bit of a turn off as its a bit pissy. The taste is good for an IPA but again lacks the hop mixture I am accustomed to. Bitterness is there but a bit muted a little dry but some sugar cane comes through at the end. Very citrusy with lemon rind and pearish qualities but no caramel sweetness. Overall good but I like maximus and sumpin sumpin much better.","jizfiasco","Jul 12, 2011"
4.67,20.1,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"Overall Drinkability - A great balanced, mild IPA. Might be a good gateway IPA to get people into the style, if they've had poor experiences with hoppier, more 'arrogant' IPAs. Refreshing and laid back.

It has a beautiful copper color and a pleasing citrusy aroma. Taste was bracing and bitter up front and smooth on the back end. I really enjoyed this beer.

Bread and caramel malts back up the hops. A lot of malt upfront, more than I expected. Creamy. A lot of biscuit, lightly toasted and caramel instantly followed by fruity melon and grapefruit that finishes bitter with only subtle amount of that sticky pine present in the nose. A fruitier flavor than expected from the nose. Smooth and creamy body that finishes with a solid bite but doesn't cloy.","DrinkingDrake","Jul 07, 2011"

An impressive IPA, to say the least. While Lagunitas sometimes cranks out beers too similar in profile at times (for me at least), this blueprint is indeed pretty tasty and a fresh IPA from Petaluma will always be welcome in my fridge.

Lots of sticky lacings. Aromas are a balance of citrus hops, papaya and sweet caramel malt with a biscuity undertone. Aroma is a little less hoppy than most IPAs. Medium bodied, well carbonated and a very resinous, tangy hop feel. Hop character shines in the flavor. Huge grapefruit and orange flavors from beginning to end, tropical papaya toward the end with a nice caramel malty /biscuity undertone. Finished clean and dry with a citrus hop aftertaste.

Appearance is pretty typical of a hoppy pale ale, golden in color with a large and rocky head that had good retention and lacing. This tasty beer went down quickly.

When you take a sip you first experience some hoppy, pine bitterness, there is a grainy, bready flavor and some tropical fruit.

Copper orange color with a metallic sheen, about as red as yellow in tint, tiny bubbles drift around here and there, highly transparent. Clean, brisk hoppy nose of tangerine, pink grapefruit zest, pine sap, damp brown earth and sour grasses, honey, lavender and a dab of chocolate not going to take the edge off, however, it's on the sweet side anyway, has apricot, peach, nectarine fruit but doesn't get tropical. Medium-bodied, has an undeniable firmness about it, the carbonation is thick and pops of languidly yet there to the very end. Offers as much mineral water and tonic water as it does lemon, grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus, stays dry, even in the face of the extract of the primary material. The pineapple, nectarine, papaya, peach fruit dry, short of concentrated. Glimmer of cocoa or coffee bean, otherwise little malt presence. The pine and flowers curiously seem short-lived too. It's almost like a sharpened knife blade but without any food on it, having not cut into anything yet. The thought keeps nagging at you that it's, umm, just a little boring.","farrago","Feb 05, 2011"

I also get some very sweet citrusy grapefruit and light grassy notes. After tasting, this is definitely some fresh IPA I have here. Delicious hoppiness followed by seet malts and fresh grapefruit flavors. I also get a bit of orange and some grassiness toward the end. Finishes with bittering hops. This is by far the best Lagunitas IPA I've had. Mouthfeel is very crisp and full-bodied. Drinkability is high! Sometimes I wonder how fair it is rating these beers when it comes to IPAs and freshness issues. Because I would definitely not speak this way about the last Lagunitas IPA I had. If you find this beer fresh, buy it and drink it ASAP, because it probably falls off very quickly.","DovaliHops","0"

Not too much malt, and maybe a bit of lemon. The taste is a little bland for me, at least for an IPA, i just would like a bit more punch, but not having that punch makes it very drinkable.

Caramely toffee malts. Floral hops. A bit of citrus. Balanced. Taste is bright off the bat, citrus and pine, then melds into that malt backbone, followed up by a medium bitterness.

I generally prefer a more maltier IPA such as my Southern favorite Sweetwater IPA, but I must admit that this is a delicious beer. Most beer lovers know that Rogue beers have a unique yeast flavor.

3.76,-3.3,4,3,4,4,4,"It's interesting to note that Lagunitas uses short-neck bottles. Pours a hazy gold with a pretty bubbly little head. Nice lacing, too. Color is gold with just a hint of copper. Aroma is, at least at first, challenging for me to discern. All I can say is that it's got a faint hop nose, though I can't really get anything beyond that. Orange peel, perhaps. Maybe it will open up a little as it warms. Mouthfeel is lightly sticky and lightly carbonated, and the bitterness in this isn't as moderate as the Dogfish Head I had earlier tonight. Interestingly enough, I called that one a West-Coast style IPA from the East Coast. I kinda feel like this Lagunitas is an East-Coast style IPA from the West Coast. For me the taste is kind of inverted, especially for an IPA. Heavy malt sweetness starts things off, before hops finish things off. Sadly, the hops aren't pronounced for me, much like the aroma. They're just ... there. Maybe the aforementioned Dogfish Head fried my palate a little bit. Best way I can think of to describe the taste of Laguniatas is that of orange marmalade on white bread. It's less assuming than others in the style but a damn fine beer in it's own right. Looking forward to having this one again.","eclaycamp","Oct 16, 2010"

Pours slightly hazy to start, but clears a bit- probably just some chill haze. Grainy, rocky head that leaves some nice lacing. Gentle carbonation, but it's there. On the nose there are gentle aromas of grapefruit, orange, and sweet apple, and a hint of spiciness from the hops. The malt is purely background. The taste is gentle as well, nicely rounded. The hops are in the forefront, but they aren't absolutely dominant or too assertive. Nice citrus flavors coupled with some hoppy spiciness, and some sweet caramel malt. A bit coppery, right at the end. In the mouth it's grainy and hoppy, but the lovely understated carbonation and creaminess ties it together. Much softer version on cask , with hops that taste fresher, fruitier, and gentler. I really enjoyed this.","Georgiabeer","Sep 05, 2010"

The hops are there, the pine/citrusy kind, but it's all-in-all pretty balanced (having tried the Hop Stoopid I was expecting something along those lines).

Make it hoppy enough for hop heads to enjoy, but smooth enough for an average IPA drinker to like. The perfect amount of hops for a beer, in my opinion. Just enough of the hop bite on the palate to remind you that you're drinking an IPA. I actually found myself thinking that I could drink a few of these, which is a great feeling.

The taste is quite malt forward for a west coast IPA, but it still has the nice hop taste. I wonder if the 6 pack I bought is a bit old because I'm not getting the same hop punch that I expected, but they didn't have date codes on the bottles, so I'll have to assume it was fresh.

3.68,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"355ml bottle from Ormond Wine Co. in Ormond Beach, FL. Pours a fairly clear amber orange with a ring of white head and some lacing on the shaker. Smell and taste are seaweed, toffee sweetness, caramel, dark bread dough, lemon, lime (a bit sour), and a mild, citrus hop bitterness to end. Almost English in character, I'm wondering whether age has tamed this beer. Mouthfeel is silky, smooth, lighter than medium, nice bite midway, moderate bitterness through the finish. Very little aftertaste. For a West Coast IPA, I was expecting much more hops, a weaker malt base, and stronger IBU. Still, this is a solid, drinkable, and decently hoppy beer. Worth a try despite its flaws.","cratez","May 14, 2010"

It was pretty well balanced though if anything I found it to be too malty. Some bitter hops that were almost a little sprucey (with some citrus) but again, just a little too malty and not too bitter.

The nose is solid, bright and mildly citrus-like with a blend of orange, pine and a little grapefruit. A subtle malt character is noticeable with a little toffee and biscuit, this has a mildly fruity English yeast character. These flavors are replicated on the palate, with an enjoyable bright citrus hop character up front with a low level of bitterness. Flavors of pine are present, along with a mellow malt character with toffee and a little honey, but there's something about this beer on cask that makes it stands out.

NOW: Trying it again for the first time, this beer is amazing. It's everything I like in an IPA and more. Followed an Anchor Old Foghorn Barleywine with this magnificent IPA and it was like Heaven. (And I'd had a Hop Stoopid before the barleywine, so my palate was already exposed to a super load of hops for the eve). It's citrusy, piney, and oh so quaffable. A beautiful beer to look at and the aroma does not differentiate from the taste. Mouthfeel is awesome and the drinkability level is oh so high. My only thought on the reason the first sample underwhelmed is that it was old. The problem with Lagunitas' products is that there's no best by date anywhere (that I can find). So one never knows what one is getting: fresh or old . . . or should I say great or not-so-great?

Grapefruity citrus presence dominates the nose with a little bit of pine needle accenting. Very disappointed with the flavor as an unpleasant, sterile metallic flavor is present and overpowers, or at least undermines, the pine and citrus hop characteristics. Could have used a little more malt to balance it out perhaps. Mouthfeel is fine though with good carbonation garnering some points. Overall, I could drink it but it needs to be tweaked a little more.

2.73,-29.8,3.5,3,2.5,3,2.5,"This brew was first Lagunitas I had that I did not care for. The beer starts off well enough, but it takes a bit of a nosedive the more you drink. The smell is of citrus--grapefruity and orangey hops with a solid malt backbone, and the taste is hoppy enough, however I've come to expect more from this brewery. Halfway through the bottle, as your palate becomes accustomed to the hops presence, the beer starts to taste sweeter and sweeter, so that by the time you're done with the first beer it's hard to tell you just finished an IPA. I think this has to do with the low resinous/aggressive hops used in this ale. The beer is probably a good "starter beer" for people who want to work their way up to some of the massive hop bombs (i.e. anything by Stone, Lagunitas's Hop Stoopid) but if you're looking for a beer to cool you off and remain bitter sip after sip, this is probably not for you.","TheNapkin","0"

I had to give it a much deeper sniff than I really should have to. It actually tastes a little hoppier than it smells, which is good. It is still light on hops though. I think I taste a hint of grapefruit. It's got a mild bitterness that comes through. The taste, though not real strong, is well balanced.

A light medium bodied feel, that thins out at the back. A slight tingle from carbonation, it leaves the palate with a clean dry feeling.

But the taste is extremely hoppy. It hits your tongue with a prickly bitter taste and a strong bite that makes it almost painful to drink. The beer doesn't appear to be very carbonated but the combination with the hops is brutal. It's one of those beers that almost makes your mouth vibrate, which I found quite satisfying.

Flavors are complex, too: starts with a nice bite from the hops, then the bitterness on the middle of tongue. Finishes clean with a malty touch, then ultimately ends with a lingering hoppy bitterness. Moderate mouthfeel appropriate to the style.

The taste comes in sweet and bubbly with a wave of earthy dryness washing in behind it. Initially, there is a sweetness that stands out and slight vegetable flavours as well as the aforementioned pine come in behind. The mouthfeel is fizzy which works well in my opinion. A rather gentle dryness comes through in the finish. Overall this thing is very well balanced. There is nothing outrageous or exaggerated.

There is some balance here for the less enthusiastic hopheads. Didn't notice any strong citrus taste like many flavorful IPAs. Overall mouthfeel is fairly good, light but not too watery.

On the palate, the hops are quite aggressive; when I had my first of this 6-pack I must have served it quite cold, but at a warmer temp, the hops are much more enjoyable. The finish isn't quite candy sweet like most IPAs, it finishes with a hop bite and doesn't hold back. I like the bitterness quite a bit, but there isn't a freshness to the hop flavor, due to this sample's uncertain age or the hops they use. When I had this beer for the first time, it was, I think the second IPA I ever drank (the first being spat out for it's bitterness), and one I really enjoyed. 200+ beers later and I'm still enjoying it and wish it was available locally.","dreadnatty08","May 01, 2007"

It had an aroma of juicy fruits, a few citrus fruits, toasted malts, and a small whiff of floral hops at the end. When it warms up a great deal, a small scent of pine will emerge. It first started out with a mild crisp floral hop bitterness and then that was followed by the citrus fruits, a pinch of toasted malts, and a dash of pine. Just a common not over the top IPA. This is a light beer that happened to have a light dry aftertaste of floral hops and a slice of grapefruit. This beer is just a nice crisp affordable light beer that has session written all over it.

The aroma is floral and very clean citrus hop. The flavor is similar, with a bit of sweet maltiness in the finish. For some reason, most of the Lagunitas beers I've had taste "clean". That's the best way I can put it... Not astringent, just very clean (almost like a cleaning product smells).

Apparently the smell was not a good indicator of what the taste was going to be because my palette was attacked with God only knows how many IBUs. Very good; I enjoy hoppy beers, but I believe this APA may be closer to a double because the IBU content of it seems to be very high. I nice mouthfeel that was pleasant and very smooth as I drank it. Pretty drinkable beer; high IBU content make it that you can't really drink too mnay of these in a row unless you are a real hophead.

Piney hops cut through the middle, giving way to significant grassiness and leaving a lingering dry bitterness. The body felt just a little thin, along with the malt character, but this improved as it warmed. Carbonation was average, nearly lively, a little creamy. Pretty good stuff.

Bitterness from start to finish...citrus and pine flavors mixed with some brown sugar and bready malts. Nice feel in the mouth. Slick from the hop oils and a dry, bitter finish.","Imstillthegman","Jul 01, 2006"

Taste is hops towards the citrus, and I'm getting a little grapefruit sweetness here and there. Mouthfeel is a little below medium which fits perfectly considering the low-ish abv for the style.

While you can taste cascade and/or other West Coast hops, the bitterness is very subtle for an American IPA. That, combined with soft, fruity and creamy malt backbone, make this taste more like an offering from Fuller's than a California brewer.

Overall an unremarkable IPA, not bad, but definitely not something to write a request for the homebrew version of.

4.15,6.7,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The initial malt flavor is completely covered by the hop bite within milliseconds. For an IPA, this is a good thing. The upfront malt could be described as slightly fruity.

Carbonation is fine.","smcolw","Jan 28, 2005"
3.5,-10,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I like Lagunitas' use of stubbie type bottles with their 6's, and this sample was poured out of one of those 12 oz brown bad boys. The appearance is a hazy copper, with a lot of suspended particles, a thin off-white head to cap it off. Lemon and tangerine mixed with grass and pine on the nose, some sweet caramel malt to hold it up, along with a little bit of smoky character. The flavour is okay, a decent balance of the malt backing up the stronger hop presence, but it doesn't really stand out much from the crowd either. Unless my tastebuds have already been shredded from two of these today already, and a Maximus earlier on. These hops really hit you in the pit of your stomach after a while. A sticky pine residue begins to form on the aftertaste over time, yet overall the mouthfeel is fairly average, not quite watery, but lacking in fuller body as well. If this were a local beer I would probably buy it more often, but at the hefty price tag of $16.99 CAN currency for a 6 of this Californian import I'll stick to Alley Kat's Full Moon Pale Ale and Tree's Hophead IPA for my regional hop fix.","IronDjinn","Jan 27, 2005"

The aroma is wonderful - with the sweetness of a Valencia orange with a touch of the bitter orange zest. I knew immediately after the first sip that this was an awesome beer. Very smooth with a mellow bitterness that has small traces of piney hops and citrus tartness. All of the flavors are blended extremely well. The body has a medium dry maltiness.

The taste is also heavy on some sort of sweetness, of sugar cooked in some form, but not burnt. There is the underpinning of hops that comes out in the aftertaste, and an overall presence of malt, but nothing spectacular. Its a good taste once you get used to it certainlly. The mouthfeel is not so great however. It is too watery, with almost no carbonation except a bit on the front of the tongue. I almost thought someone had watered my beer down.

Instead of tongue-singeing hops there's a more balanced sweet grassy taste to this beer. A bit zesty, and floral. Mild sweet malts back up the hops.

The smell is good, though a bit weak, and contains pine, hops, citrus, and a tinge of malt. The taste to me is watery and weak for an IPA. It has the hops, and a bit of bitterness along with the pine and grapefruit notes, but it has a watery metallic taste that I find in some macros. The mouthfeel is good, just not substantial enough for me. Since it has an ABV of only 5.7%, you can drink many of these. All in all, not a good example of the style, in my opinion.

The malts are sweet and ample, flavors of caramel and maple syrup. Some smooth bread and butter elements. Invisible yeast. Hops quickly settle in with good herbal and pine qualities. Resin lingers on the tongue, perhaps a fraction too long, but if this beer had any less hops it would probably be a pale ale and not an IPA. It's not the intensely bitter, high-abv hop monster that many Pacific IPAs can be. Much more mellow and as a result, more drinkable. Excellent, soft mouthfeel. A session IPA if there ever was one.

Taste is very hoppy with nice citrus grapefruit bitterness to it. Slightly sweet finish from the weak malt character here, the taste defiantly stands out more than the smell.

Nonetheless...satisfying to all of the senses. Pours a slightly pinkish golden hue with a very nice, choppy, beige head. Good lacing, apparently moderate carbonation. The smell is mild, and is perhaps the weak link in an otherwise strong chain of features. Basically it is just piney/rindey Cascade hops with an interesting but understated malty sweetness underneath. The taste is what I like the best. A bready malt flavor makes an appearance, showing off a little bit of a buttery aspect. The hops soon take over, initially astringent, now lemony, and finally ultra-dry and piney. The mouthfeel is solid for the style and right up my alley. Slightly chewier than many hop-heavy beers, this brew has a nice alcoholic warmth and is perfect for chilly Spring and Fall evenings.

The taste is a lovely combo of floral hops and English malts in good proportion to one another. The mouthfeel is quite thick and almost "stout-like" for an IPA. This is definately one of the least hoppy and thickest/creamiest/smoothest west coast IPAs to ever cross the discerning palate of this BA. The drinkability was good, but the super creamy mouthfeel does get a bit "coating" or "cloying" after about half a glass or so...Overall this is a very "different" IPA from a brewery that has made a good first impression on me.

4.2,8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Nice golden pale color that is slightly hazy. Thin foam of head that goes away with time. Very hoppy bitter smell as expected. The taste is slightly malty with obvious amount of bitterness. The bitter smell and taste do not overpower the aromatic and flavorful qualities of the beer. Nice smooth, slightly sweet finish. Overall a good IPA.","Elemental","Aug 20, 2003"
3.88,-0.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Dark Amber color, small foamy head. Aroma is fruity and grapefruity. A nice hoppy full-bodied IPA. Malts are nutty. Hops are spicy and citrusy. Hoppy without being too bitter. Good flavor. Aftertaste is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is hoppy, mostly bitter","beerguy101","Aug 14, 2003"
3.6,-7.5,4,4,3.5,4,3,"This is a very hoppy beer, but unlike other west coast beers, it lacks an equally strong malty or sweet counterpunch. For some hop-heads, that might not matter. There is some sweetness up front, but it scuttles away almost immediately upon reaching the tongue, like a cockroach when the kitchen like is turned on.","Darkale","Jul 15, 2003"
4,2.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark ruddy amber, nice tight foamy head. The bartender at this place has presentation down to a T. Fresh grass and grove smell from the hops, and a very balanced and complimentary hop and malt taste. Its hard to find a balanced hop and malt IPA anymore. Nice bitter finish that means another drink. A nice self-perpetuating IPA.","freed","Beers"
4.1,5.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: A good oily resin on the lips and burps with zing to them. What more can you ask for? I like the almost "tingly" feeling at the end and the oily bitterness that remained. A very good IPA and one that is sure to be a hit with the hop-heads out there.","OldFrothingSlosh","0"

4.12,5.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"A hazy amber body with suspended soft-particulate is topped by a large off-white head of creamy foam. It drops at a leisurely pace to a solid 1/8" surface covering and leaves some exceptional lacing about the glass. The aroma displays, not surprisingly, hops. They're piney, floral, and grassy over a sweetish, caramel-tinged malt - fresh, exciting, and welcoming without hitting you over the head! The body is medium; and it's quite creamy in the mouth due to a very fine, natural carbonation. In the flavor the hop bitterness and piney/resinous flavors hold the upper hand; forcing the sweet malt beneath into submission. It's well-balanced to the point of losing some character. But it's also balanced enough that the bitterness doesn't cake the mouth. (It may mask the tastebuds... but it doesn't cake the mouth in dryness!). An enjoyable beer that can be paired with any number of full-flavored dishes; and an excellent night-cap on cool summer nights when the sun has gone down and the moist air lays heavily in the back yard.","NeroFiddled","Jun 04, 2003"
2.62,-32.6,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"The palate to this beer is flat with tea and honey. Back of the palate hop tannins become apparent. Finish is sweet and thick and wet.","drewbage","May 14, 2003"
1.97,-49.4,3.5,1.5,1.5,3,2.5,"Overall i would recommend this beer on a hot summer day or night when you have friends over who want a new beer but not one so intense as to make them puckered up. I probably would not buy this beer again as there are hoppy pale ales in my area in which i can find the distinct bitterness in a more diverse flavor profile.","RenoZymurgist","Apr 24, 2003"
3.58,-8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability/notes: A well-crafted IPA. While I am not particularly a fan of heavily hopped beers, this one is quite well done  the hops are strong but not overpowering. An excellent introduction to the IPA style.","Pegasus","Apr 15, 2003"
3.92,0.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Oh yeah baby, lots of Little Fernies a floatin in this beer, a hazy amber color the head modest, the texture frothy, the color and off white with a nice covering of lace. Sweet malt, light hop floral tone also noticed, quite sniffable, sweet malt start, the top moderate in feel. Finish has a definite acidic bite, the hops potent in their spicy bite, dry and long lasting aftertaste. A great beer from a great brewery got a couple of its bigger brother aging away, and that would be Maximus!","Gusler","Mar 20, 2003"

4.05,4.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"A very nice IPA. Lagunitas has created an IPA that does not create an overly strong taste for first time drinkers. The flowery hops are ever-present but not oppressively strong. This is a very drinkable beer that would go well with many different foods. Clever marketing descriptions and regional beer labeling create a nice overall package.","AtLagerHeads","Feb 21, 2003"
3.82,-1.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"From Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. Not a bad IPA at all. Pours a murky golden amber color with a thick off-white head. The foamy head lasted quite a while. Nice lacing as well. Floral hops aroma. Flavor is very citrusy, and the hops are really not as bold as the glass progresses. Nicely bitter finish. Doesn't have the "snap you with a wet towel" hops that the great IPAs have but otherwise this beer is just fine.","Dogbrick","Feb 19, 2003"
4.12,5.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Bad ass hops here. Excellent hop nose as well. Very nice hop flavor. Smooth mouthfeel as well with a light body. The taste is very bitter as should be expected in an IPA. This is one of the better beers from Lagunitas. I enjoyed this one and will occasionally drink it again.","AtrumAnimus","Feb 07, 2003"
4.25,9.3,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a huge thick and chunky white head that seems to last almost forever and leaves thick sheets of lace on the sides of the glass as you drink. Nose is floral and citrusy hops with only a faint hint of malt. Very inviting! Light to medium in body with a bit of a sticky mouthfeel. Only a small amount of sweet malts up front quickly overshadowed by bitter raw hop leaf flavors and notes of grapefruit rind. Finish is bone dry and hop resins are present in the lasting aftertaste. A very nice IPA, though I do prefer the Lagunitas Maximus IPA to this one.","Morris729","Feb 03, 2003"

3.78,-2.8,3,2.5,4,4,5,"First Lagunitas product that I have tried. It is definitely on the hoppy side as declared in the little message on the bottle. Poured a decent head and dissipated over a minute or two. The beer has a pinkish copper color to it. It also has very fine pulp floating around, I'm guessing grapefruit since the beer has a pretty distinct grapefruit flavor. Definitely different than other IPA's I have tried. I say its a good tasting beer despite the fact that I'm not a huge hop fan. Average aftertaste and good drinkability.","12ouncecurls","Dec 26, 2002"
4.27,9.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Orange amber in color. Ridden with particles. Hazy. Nice lace patterns left while drinking. Pungent, oily, flowery and sticky sweet maltiness on the nose. Very nice nose. The taste is more of the same...with a solid malt profile to handle the hop load. Hops are husky and resiny....herbal and flowery. Malt seems to be crystal/caramel based. Drinkability high. Overall a solid IPA. Yet another to add to the long list of IPAs I like from the West Coast.","Bighuge","Nov 02, 2002"

3.53,-9.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It's got a nice glowing appearance:  gold with a hint of red and a big pillowy head that looks like it could float a quarter.  The hops fill your nose, leaving little room for any other aroma.  The taste matches the smell, with hops really dominating.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really have the malt flavor to back up the intense presence of the hops.  It has a slight metallic taste and is quite a bit dryer than the typical IPA.  The hop bitterness detracts from the drinkability.  It's not bad, but I'll choose other IPAs in the future.","mickeymac","Sep 16, 2002"
3.73,-4.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy but brilliant orange/amber color with a massive large bubbled off-white head.  Citrusy hop smell to get the mouth watering.  Definitely hoppy with citrus undertones that give it a grapefruit like overall taste.  It is a light bodied brew with a slightly sticky yet dry finish.  Has a lot of character, yet not highly complex.  Another note:  It still had a 1/2 finger head left with only 1 1/2" of beer left in the glass!!!...and no, I didn't drink it extra fast ;-).  I'll give it a thumbs...uh...bottoms up.  Cheers!","BeerAngel","Aug 27, 2002"

4.03,3.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The label does not lie, 'homicidally hoppy ale', indeed.  This is a mighty fine beer. The appearance was mui appealing.  Very high head, light, foamy and sticky; topping a cloudy effervescent brew. Some nice lace on the way down the glass.  The veracity of the hops made it a bit like chewing on a piece of grapefruit rind, but that's part of the fun with this one.  There was a hint of malty sweetness up front, but it fades under pressure from the hops. I couldn't drink more than 2 at a time (I popped for a six-pack) but it's very well-suited for quaffing while you are kicking back and gnawing on some crusty bread.","ebraun","Mar 18, 2002"
4.25,9.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Slightly hazy copper color when poured from the 12oz. bottle. Minimal head that quickly dissipates. Citrus, grapefruity hop aroma. Fierce hop bitterness that mellows and becomes more estery as it warms. Semi-slick mouthfeel balanced by a prickly carbonation level. Good stuff...I could easily recommend this brew.","John","Beers"
4.68,20.3,5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"A potent and bold IPA.  Muscular hop character.  Very hazey amber-orange swimming with sediments.

4.44,14.1,3,4,5,5,4,"This west coast IPA has a wonderfully pungent and citrusy nose, most likely from a combination of American 4 C (Cascade, Chinook, Columbus, Centennial) hops.  If you pour out the whole bottle you will have a VERY cloudy, almost nasty looking beer filled with yeast sediment.  It doesn't bother me at all, but be forewarned.  Assertive hop bitterness w/ a floral and pungent hop flavor... great malt backbone... smooth finish... GREAT IPA!!  OG: 1.057, IBU's 47, but it tastes MUCH bigger than that.","marc77","0"
